[52:49] brother truck came back and asked me
[52:52] this morning like johnson's gonna be
[52:54] here i was like
[52:55] nope it's on you yeah y'all should tell
[52:58] her brother something
[53:00] so i said that's why i keep i keep a
[53:04] little list
[53:04] of songs you know in my song book
[53:08] and everything and he said man this list
[53:11] look by the old i say it is
[53:14] it is it's about three years old i say
[53:18] when i'm
[53:18] called on the spot i look down my list
[53:22] for some inspiration and uh
[53:25] from there you know things will start
[53:27] coming so amen we appreciate the lord
[53:30] appreciate i mean appreciate brother
[53:31] troy
[53:33] amen we appreciate his diligence
[53:37] amen his steadfastness and uh
[53:40] i don't know about y'all but how many
[53:41] enjoy brother troy on wednesday night
[53:46] amen amen i was sitting back there and
[53:50] uh i was just listening to this mess
[53:52] we're gonna be looking in the book of
[53:53] psalms chapter 25.
[53:55] i said man i know john put that thing
[53:59] together
[54:00] i was saying i told him he called me and
[54:03] uh because i i was just
[54:04] i told him i said uh i had to make sure
[54:07] i be here to be supportive
[54:09] you know we got to support one another
[54:11] especially in the ministry and i knew
[54:12] that
[54:13] you know brother jack was not going to
[54:15] be here and so
[54:17] uh brother quiku is not here and so
[54:20] you know i guess i'm i'm kind of
[54:23] one of the elders
[54:27] i'm probably the eldest in the ministry
[54:30] period
[54:32] so uh but with brother jack not being
[54:34] here i wanted to make it my business i
[54:36] cut out of work a few minutes
[54:38] early to be support because i know how
[54:41] it is
[54:42] amen when you're ministering to be able
[54:45] to look out and have
[54:46] you know just brothers there you know
[54:49] the pastor and
[54:50] different things to trying to cheer you
[54:52] on because sometimes you say things and
[54:54] the laity they don't cheer you on
[54:58] well y'all don't say amen it's the truth
[55:01] anyhow
[55:02] y'all just kind of give a person a
[55:04] little look a little stale
[55:06] roll of the head a little maybe a little
[55:08] roll of the eyes
[55:09] too so we have to sometimes pull another
[55:13] brother through
[55:14] so uh but he didn't need any help uh he
[55:17] had the holy spirit and
[55:19] i watched how god inspired him and i i
[55:22] told him i said i might have to take
[55:23] that
[55:23] somewhere and preach it as my own
[55:26] maybe throw out yeah i got a little bit
[55:29] of this from brother troy but i
[55:31] i just appreciate what i see in brother
[55:34] troy
[55:35] amen and how god has brought him from a
[55:37] mighty mighty
[55:38] long way amen uh
[55:42] let's remember brother jack and brother

[59:05] gracious father we just come to give
[59:07] thanks and praise this morning
[59:09] lord we have a little thought this
[59:11] morning but
[59:12] we know that the
[59:16] the gift is the ability to get yourself
[59:18] out of the way
[59:19] and so lord you know every heart this
[59:22] morning
[59:24] lord uh nothing is really premeditated
[59:28] we have a few things that we scribbled
[59:30] down but
[59:32] outside of that we don't know where you
[59:35] lead us this morning but we just want to
[59:39] trust us when it's all said and done

[1:00:13] the praise
[1:00:14] glory now in jesus name amen amen may be
[1:00:17] seated
[1:00:21] um i want to use as a little topic this
[1:00:24] morning
[1:00:24] um god's goodness to
[1:00:28] the reverent man i
[1:00:31] kind of heard this scripture and
[1:00:34] it just kind of stuck with me and i just
[1:00:37] kind of started praying about it
[1:00:38] knowing that we had to try to
[1:00:42] bring something that we trust that'll be
[1:00:44] a blessing to us this morning
[1:00:47] um i was thinking about i was thinking
[1:00:50] about
[1:00:50] david we know david in scripture he was
[1:00:53] king priest and prophet
[1:00:55] uh very gifted
[1:00:59] we know we know that uh he could play
[1:01:03] music and uh when his father-in-law got
[1:01:06] under a spirit
[1:01:09] he would just play play some music to
[1:01:11] kind of
[1:01:13] calm him down one thing about music
[1:01:15] music is soothing
[1:01:17] right i mean it don't take the place of
[1:01:20] the word but it has its place
[1:01:23] right sometimes you know you just find
[1:01:26] some good old songs you might be going
[1:01:27] through a little something and
[1:01:29] you might hear a little a song that'll
[1:01:32] just kind of really
[1:01:33] just settle settle your spirit down
[1:01:37] right because we we're living in the age
[1:01:39] where where folks
[1:01:41] uh uh anxious right
[1:01:44] anxious i might be tattled this morning
[1:01:48] and and and and just a real neurotic
[1:01:51] age everybody everybody is nervous and
[1:01:55] uptight and if you listen to the news
[1:01:58] media and all that they keep you all
[1:02:00] twisted that's why
[1:02:02] i don't get caught up in news i don't
[1:02:05] get caught up in politics cause i'm
[1:02:07] already
[1:02:08] so many other things that that want to
[1:02:10] keep me wound up
[1:02:12] and i want to be unwound i want to be at
[1:02:16] peace in my spirit i want to be at rest
[1:02:19] even amongst the things that just going
[1:02:21] on
[1:02:22] around me every day my my personal life
[1:02:25] my family and things of that nature
[1:02:27] things that
[1:02:28] you know i have no power to change
[1:02:32] i i was thinking about brother troy the
[1:02:35] other night and i thought that was
[1:02:36] powerful
[1:02:37] you know because i had some of the
[1:02:38] similar experiences i could understand
[1:02:42] you know when he was talking about the
[1:02:43] tender hand of jehovah my parents uh
[1:02:45] they separated that
[1:02:46] when i was six and you know when you
[1:02:50] young you know we don't really
[1:02:51] understand those different things you as
[1:02:54] a sinner we don't even
[1:02:56] begin to understand what the will of god
[1:02:58] is
[1:02:59] even sometimes when we finally get to
[1:03:02] god we don't really know
[1:03:04] what the perfect will of god is right
[1:03:07] we're going to go somewhere this morning
[1:03:10] amen but we i thank god that you know
[1:03:13] we've
[1:03:13] we've grown and we matured uh
[1:03:16] uh and we understand that amen god is a
[1:03:20] sovereign god
[1:03:21] you know you we used to hear the old
[1:03:23] timers say he's too
[1:03:24] wise to make a mistake and that's the
[1:03:28] truth
[1:03:29] is that right amen there's there's no
[1:03:31] knowledge that supersedes the knowledge
[1:03:34] of god
[1:03:35] right when when when god uh uh uh
[1:03:40] brought forth his plan he had a purpose
[1:03:43] there was nobody there that he could
[1:03:45] look to and consider
[1:03:47] right nobody is that right
[1:03:51] it was his plan and his purpose to be
[1:03:54] fulfilled
[1:03:55] so so you don't understand that apart
[1:03:58] from
[1:03:59] being redeemed though right
[1:04:02] we we kind of look at everything as a
[1:04:05] tragedy
[1:04:07] and we get to you know warm me and then
[1:04:10] you know sometimes people do do things
[1:04:13] with no regards to the people around
[1:04:17] them
[1:04:17] in their households and different things
[1:04:20] we we make
[1:04:21] moves and we do do things
[1:04:24] but god is in control
[1:04:28] god is it god is in control right
[1:04:32] regardless of our understanding or lack
[1:04:35] thereof
[1:04:37] god is still in control you know you got
[1:04:40] to thank god for predestination
[1:04:44] right as as much as much as i used to
[1:04:48] look at those
[1:04:49] uh situations that have a struggle
[1:04:52] i now that it was all working together
[1:04:56] cause that's the bible
[1:04:59] it might not be good but it'll work out
[1:05:01] for the good
[1:05:03] to them that love the lord and to call
[1:05:05] according to his purpose is that right
[1:05:08] that i was free that was from brother
[1:05:10] trump i was feeling inspired
[1:05:12] huh glory to god glory to god
[1:05:15] but but thinking of thinking about david
[1:05:18] you know in his ministry and his
[1:05:20] his gifts and and some of the things
[1:05:23] that the prophet of god
[1:05:24] he taught about gifted people
[1:05:28] right gifted people uh has to
[1:05:32] to to to climb up
[1:05:36] into a place in order to catch
[1:05:39] some inspiration and pin it
[1:05:43] and sometimes then i've heard sister
[1:05:45] burr say this
[1:05:46] some of her songs has been written
[1:05:50] out of uh despair
[1:05:53] hard times struggle
[1:05:56] most artists
[1:05:59] most artists write right
[1:06:02] out of of troublesome times pin
[1:06:06] some of the greatest songs amen out of
[1:06:10] trouble sometimes climb up to a rim and
[1:06:14] bring back
[1:06:15] masterpieces amazing grace
[1:06:18] how sweet the sound that saved the
[1:06:22] wretch like me
[1:06:25] uh uh eat the star spangled battle songs
[1:06:29] like that
[1:06:30] adversity right written out of
[1:06:34] adversity you know uh uh
[1:06:39] david no doubt being inspired because
[1:06:43] you know this is the book of redemption
[1:06:46] right and his inspiration
[1:06:49] right uh has to be in line
[1:06:53] with with god's patterns and god's plan
[1:06:57] my feelings good now
[1:07:02] just not something that's empty but
[1:07:05] something that's relevant something
[1:07:07] that's
[1:07:08] pertinent to uh our life
[1:07:12] right and and i kind of maybe want to
[1:07:16] read this scripture from a different
[1:07:19] translation
[1:07:20] you know sometimes i study from a little
[1:07:24] concordance uh uh on the internet to
[1:07:29] kind of
[1:07:29] get an idea because i'm not smart i
[1:07:32] didn't really go to bible school or
[1:07:34] anything like that so
[1:07:35] i have to use the tools at my resource
[1:07:40] where brother branham don't bring in
[1:07:42] things because we we
[1:07:43] i just want to get the thought behind
[1:07:46] the the writing sometimes and so
[1:07:50] uh this this scripture it read
[1:07:55] who is the man that fears fear if the
[1:07:58] lord
[1:07:59] right david david
[1:08:02] is written in the king james what man is
[1:08:05] he that fears but
[1:08:06] it's it's it's still in the form of
[1:08:10] of a question
[1:08:13] right and listen this question
[1:08:16] can only be answered from
[1:08:20] a a uh individual
[1:08:24] personal standpoint
[1:08:27] i can't answer this question for you
[1:08:30] i don't know y'all well enough to know
[1:08:32] amen
[1:08:33] whether or not you really feel or
[1:08:36] or uh the real definition is
[1:08:40] reverence it's not where oh god
[1:08:44] now that's not it it's it's a a
[1:08:47] reverence
[1:08:49] or a respect to the lord
[1:08:52] right and see only us as individuals
[1:08:57] uh can answer this now now
[1:09:01] and also i'll say this your life is an
[1:09:04] indication of how you reverence god
[1:09:08] come on right because the eyes of the
[1:09:12] lord is
[1:09:13] is everywhere and and just the
[1:09:17] life that that we live amen it speaks
[1:09:20] volumes
[1:09:22] you know i'm reminded of in a place
[1:09:25] brother branham say what what we need
[1:09:29] right is lived voices
[1:09:33] right because because he could see where
[1:09:36] where uh there was a lot of people that
[1:09:39] can quote
[1:09:41] quote scriptures if if you're
[1:09:44] knowledgeable or you know some people
[1:09:48] got photogenic memories i've i've heard
[1:09:51] brother danny reagan say one time where
[1:09:54] he could quote his entire bible verbatim
[1:09:59] page and and i'm like what
[1:10:03] i'm in thank god i'm in the paraphrase
[1:10:05] age
[1:10:07] you know what i mean age
[1:10:11] you know back back when when the prophet
[1:10:14] first went off the scene
[1:10:16] you couldn't get him brothers that you
[1:10:17] had brothers to come to the platform
[1:10:20] even when i first got converted
[1:10:22] in 1988 since the erica and all of them
[1:10:24] know
[1:10:25] brothers would come to the platform with
[1:10:27] a stack of books like this
[1:10:31] you had to you had to read it we had to
[1:10:33] know where it was coming from even if
[1:10:35] they misquoted it
[1:10:37] i mean misinterpreted it they at least
[1:10:40] they
[1:10:40] read it but thank god that we've we've
[1:10:43] grown
[1:10:44] and matured to a place uh
[1:10:47] to where we don't really have to do that
[1:10:50] now
[1:10:50] now anytime you want to ask me a
[1:10:53] question about anything
[1:10:56] i always have my material here for you
[1:10:58] to read it
[1:10:59] so you don't think i'm off the wall i
[1:11:01] just i'm crazy
[1:11:03] brother smiley don't know what he's
[1:11:04] talking about
[1:11:06] i been doing this a little while
[1:11:09] i do have some indication but we'll
[1:11:11] leave that alone
[1:11:13] all right so he he says
[1:11:16] who is the man that feareth the lord
[1:11:22] right and and i was thinking i was
[1:11:25] i was thinking about this and and and
[1:11:29] you know
[1:11:32] david could answer this question right
[1:11:35] because of the many experiences
[1:11:41] that he went through right
[1:11:44] uh a lot of times people don't
[1:11:47] reverence a thing or they don't
[1:11:50] reverence the lord
[1:11:52] because they don't have any real
[1:11:54] experiences
[1:11:56] that they can really
[1:11:59] by understanding look back and say that
[1:12:03] was god
[1:12:05] right even even though god is there all
[1:12:08] the time
[1:12:10] right god god is watching over his word
[1:12:14] to perform it
[1:12:16] but a lot of times because of people's
[1:12:19] inexperience
[1:12:21] right not being not being experienced
[1:12:26] they can't see god
[1:12:29] they can't see god amen at work
[1:12:32] working in their behalf right
[1:12:36] glow into his wonderful name so
[1:12:38] sometimes they can't really answer that
[1:12:40] question
[1:12:42] but but all the many experiences
[1:12:47] man ain't none of us had a javelin
[1:12:49] thrown at us
[1:12:52] come on you know your father-in-law
[1:12:56] thank god my father-in-law never threw a
[1:12:58] javelin at me
[1:13:00] you know you got father-in-law's do all
[1:13:03] kind of stuff
[1:13:04] but i i can say that my mother-in-law
[1:13:07] has been
[1:13:08] over the years just man great
[1:13:13] right but everybody can't say that
[1:13:17] right everybody everybody can't say that
[1:13:20] see but it's it's by his his
[1:13:24] many experiences
[1:13:27] and and seeing god at work
[1:13:31] and understanding that that was god
[1:13:35] that wasn't a man right
[1:13:38] now i said something then see
[1:13:42] the the reason why we we
[1:13:46] it i guess it's just carnal nature that
[1:13:48] we we
[1:13:49] we're prone to look to man right
[1:13:53] instead of god it i guess it just kind
[1:13:55] of goes with who we are carnally
[1:13:57] yeah the children of israel
[1:14:01] they had god and a prophet with them
[1:14:04] right but they they looked at was
[1:14:07] looking at the world
[1:14:10] and seeing what the world had and what
[1:14:13] the world
[1:14:14] had going on and and didn't see the
[1:14:17] depth of what they had
[1:14:19] they had the very creator
[1:14:22] they had the very god of the book they
[1:14:25] had the
[1:14:26] altar they had a mouthpiece from god and
[1:14:29] they said we want a man
[1:14:32] we we want a king to lead us
[1:14:35] really but you know
[1:14:38] it was because of their inexperience
[1:14:42] and and you know we people around church
[1:14:44] do that
[1:14:47] we want some man that we we
[1:14:50] we can follow some
[1:14:53] some quote-unquote big name preacher
[1:14:56] something man i want to follow god
[1:15:01] just just give me a man a vessel
[1:15:04] that's yielded to god
[1:15:08] right well he just started preaching
[1:15:11] i don't care if little brother joseph
[1:15:13] stop preaching tomorrow
[1:15:16] right amen it don't matter if he can
[1:15:20] yield his
[1:15:21] 10 year old
[1:15:24] amen that's the young man with the deep
[1:15:28] voice
[1:15:29] he told me he said i said man why your
[1:15:31] voice so deep he said
[1:15:33] uh i guess it's puberty
[1:15:38] you know i i i just like that little
[1:15:41] fella right there
[1:15:42] he's just so mature he might be so much
[1:15:44] of my son
[1:15:46] right but you i'm willing to
[1:15:49] hey man yield myself no matter how many
[1:15:52] years
[1:15:53] i've ministered because it's it's the
[1:15:57] gift of god
[1:15:59] it's god speaking through human lips
[1:16:03] is that right amen because that's all a
[1:16:06] gift
[1:16:06] is but see commonly we we look to
[1:16:10] the fleshly man and see no man
[1:16:13] has the ability brother branham said you
[1:16:16] know what
[1:16:17] i'm just standing in here when he
[1:16:20] does it is god using the voice
[1:16:25] god he says i got to go back sometime
[1:16:26] and listen to the tape for myself
[1:16:29] to know what i'm saying right because
[1:16:32] he's so caught up in the spirit
[1:16:36] see and it's by these experiences
[1:16:39] you learn to reverence god
[1:16:44] glory to god you learn you learn how to
[1:16:47] to reverence see amen
[1:16:52] you know the generation that we're
[1:16:53] living in is dip
[1:16:55] is different they are they want to be
[1:16:58] different i'll let them have it you are
[1:17:00] different
[1:17:02] if you want to be different right
[1:17:06] i don't want to bother nobody today
[1:17:09] all right but but you can you can see
[1:17:12] for me just the lack of experience
[1:17:16] and the and the lack of understanding
[1:17:19] though
[1:17:21] right amen the lack of understanding
[1:17:26] the lack of experience causes people
[1:17:29] to do a lot of the things that people do
[1:17:33] right amen and what's what it's an
[1:17:36] indication
[1:17:37] is the lack of reverence the lack of
[1:17:40] reverence in the home
[1:17:43] come on y'all it's it's a real
[1:17:47] disconnect right
[1:17:52] you know we we grew up in my my
[1:17:55] generation you
[1:17:56] learn to reverence respect
[1:17:59] elders you just knew that
[1:18:03] you you didn't stand around and try to
[1:18:05] hold conversation with old folk
[1:18:09] your mama be looking upside your head
[1:18:11] like boy
[1:18:13] they my grandma and them they just
[1:18:15] stayed they didn't have my grandmama
[1:18:16] didn't have to go through all that they
[1:18:18] just gave you the look
[1:18:24] that's all they did they just when when
[1:18:26] when they turned
[1:18:28] and then and your i caught they i
[1:18:33] you already understood what that was all
[1:18:36] about
[1:18:38] her eyes were speaking to you if you
[1:18:41] don't get
[1:18:42] out of here out of grove folk
[1:18:44] conversation
[1:18:46] boy i'ma tell you a new one
[1:18:49] you already knew that right generation
[1:18:54] now
[1:18:55] generations now you know but the bible
[1:18:58] say they'll be wiser but weaker
[1:19:01] right but but in in their wisdom
[1:19:05] you have to just challenge the wisdom
[1:19:07] that they they're getting though
[1:19:10] because writers become wrong and
[1:19:12] wrongers become right
[1:19:14] so you just really sometimes have to
[1:19:16] question
[1:19:18] what are people actually getting
[1:19:21] because when i was coming up the things
[1:19:23] that were considered wrong
[1:19:25] now is is becoming right
[1:19:29] and and and the things that people
[1:19:32] grew up with that that fed them and kept
[1:19:34] them and all of that
[1:19:36] now they got all of these questions
[1:19:40] see in 1988 we have all of these
[1:19:43] questions
[1:19:45] i'm still preaching right
[1:19:49] but but now it's it's the age of
[1:19:52] of we we question you question authority
[1:19:55] you
[1:19:56] question this see it shows it's a real
[1:20:00] inexperience and a lack of revelation
[1:20:06] now no let me stop him let me clarify
[1:20:10] if you don't understand something then
[1:20:13] then
[1:20:13] ask a question but have the right spirit
[1:20:19] right amen because this this this thi
[1:20:22] it's like being in school
[1:20:23] you know it's not disrespectful for you
[1:20:26] to raise your hand
[1:20:28] you know uh and and say well teacher so
[1:20:31] and so
[1:20:32] i i heard you but i don't understand
[1:20:36] that could you clarify cause you
[1:20:38] simplified a little bit better for me
[1:20:41] right but but to be challenging
[1:20:46] to be challenging disrespectful that's
[1:20:50] something different
[1:20:52] there's something different see
[1:20:54] everything
[1:20:55] watch this in association with god has
[1:20:58] got to be
[1:20:59] a man with the right spirit
[1:21:04] right it's got it's got to be lined up
[1:21:07] see and this is how i study so i can
[1:21:09] help you all out
[1:21:10] i watched amen everything by the spirit
[1:21:16] right because every fruit is
[1:21:19] known by what it brings forth
[1:21:22] right and so then if we're looking to
[1:21:25] god
[1:21:27] right and his spirit there's certain
[1:21:29] characteristics that's got to be on
[1:21:31] display
[1:21:33] you can't get around that i don't care
[1:21:34] how smart she is how much
[1:21:36] education y'all might have more college
[1:21:38] than me but you ain't getting around
[1:21:39] that
[1:21:41] if it's the spirit of god in you and me
[1:21:45] like i saw something i saw some i saw
[1:21:49] something uh this week i i had been
[1:21:51] hearing about
[1:21:52] a couple of preachers and i ain't gonna
[1:21:53] call nobody's name
[1:21:56] uh and and one preacher said something
[1:21:58] about another preacher
[1:22:00] and and this preacher he got on social
[1:22:03] media
[1:22:04] and he just went off and i said you know
[1:22:07] what two wrongs don't make a right
[1:22:10] and i was saying to myself you know
[1:22:14] even though the person might have said a
[1:22:18] particular thing and even called your
[1:22:21] name and doing
[1:22:22] it it's like i don't see the leading of
[1:22:26] god
[1:22:28] right if it's god it'll be done with
[1:22:32] with the right kind of spirit
[1:22:36] the the right type of attitude not
[1:22:39] a bolster is you know
[1:22:42] like how dare you
[1:22:47] i'm gonna crush you for that that ain't
[1:22:49] the spirit of god i don't care
[1:22:51] okay how long he been preaching where he
[1:22:53] come from
[1:22:54] and all of that the character other
[1:22:57] things
[1:22:58] that don't meet in the character of god
[1:23:03] right see the the the right
[1:23:06] the right thing would be to pick up the
[1:23:09] phone
[1:23:11] and say god bless you my brother
[1:23:14] i'd like to have a quick conversation
[1:23:17] with you
[1:23:19] right amen and and maybe you can
[1:23:22] help me with your statement
[1:23:25] and then maybe with the right spirit
[1:23:29] right you know you can get an apology
[1:23:32] and a retraction from the brother
[1:23:36] so that you don't have to go out and
[1:23:39] for me you damage your reputation
[1:23:42] right i'd be like that that ain't god i
[1:23:46] don't care i don't care
[1:23:47] how many scriptures and how much this
[1:23:49] and that another you bring
[1:23:51] right the the the the character of it
[1:23:55] the spirit of it is wrong
[1:23:57] and see brother branham said he'd rather
[1:23:59] be wrong in his doctrine
[1:24:02] then to be a modern day jacked up in his
[1:24:05] spirit
[1:24:07] right amen because god can we going
[1:24:10] somewhere
[1:24:11] god god amen we will reveal
[1:24:15] but to a certain class of people
[1:24:20] right y'all pray for me now i ain't like
[1:24:22] brother troy
[1:24:23] i do not have a timer up here
[1:24:27] i'ma preach to y'all wave the flag
[1:24:31] how long have i been up here i got about
[1:24:33] 30 minutes
[1:24:34] about 12 30 is when brother jack i think
[1:24:37] quit right
[1:24:38] amen no i ain't gonna kill him now
[1:24:41] but i i i think i got about 30 minutes
[1:24:44] i'm moving slow today
[1:24:46] cause i'm in i'm in a whole nother mode
[1:24:48] this morning
[1:24:50] right so he says who is the man that
[1:24:53] feareth the lord you gotta be able
[1:24:57] to answer that question for yourself
[1:25:02] right amen
[1:25:05] i i want to drop down and i want to i
[1:25:08] want to deal with something
[1:25:10] um also in those lines
[1:25:14] um because people try to get around
[1:25:17] things and i and you can't do it the
[1:25:20] prophet he
[1:25:20] he preached the messenger called
[1:25:24] respect right then i'm just kind of drop
[1:25:27] this in here and then we'll try to move
[1:25:29] along and get you out ahead of you
[1:25:32] but but i thought i thought that this
[1:25:34] was good and
[1:25:35] and just trying to uh dissect
[1:25:39] the scripture because now we we got to
[1:25:41] keep in mind we
[1:25:42] we're preaching from under the seventh
[1:25:44] seal every mystery
[1:25:46] has has been revealed and what's the
[1:25:49] scripture that i read i hope i can get
[1:25:51] to it right
[1:25:53] uh we've been given something and this
[1:25:55] is why i think a lot of people is
[1:25:57] missing it
[1:25:58] we've been given something in this age
[1:26:01] that other generations
[1:26:02] and other agents didn't get
[1:26:06] they didn't get the same understanding
[1:26:10] luther wesley pentecost they didn't get
[1:26:13] the same understanding that we have
[1:26:16] right how many can agree with that
[1:26:20] because luther had a message of
[1:26:21] justification
[1:26:23] amen you know not even saying the case
[1:26:26] he still
[1:26:26] drunk a little beer and smoked the pipe
[1:26:31] right went to the pub come on
[1:26:34] but then but then wesley comes on this
[1:26:36] scene and say uh
[1:26:38] right because your your body is the
[1:26:41] temple of the holy ghost
[1:26:44] right and even the prophet of god talks
[1:26:46] about how
[1:26:47] how uh mischievous people is when he
[1:26:51] preached a
[1:26:51] thinking man's filter right
[1:26:56] he said you know you put the filter on
[1:26:58] it and it takes
[1:26:59] more cigarettes to satisfy
[1:27:04] that thirst so it's false advertisement
[1:27:09] he said a thinking man won't smoke
[1:27:12] oh y'all don't preach with me i hope no

[1:27:19] i hope no drinkers are in here you know
[1:27:22] oh glory too is wonderful i know we've
[1:27:24] gotten to the place even around the
[1:27:26] reveal word
[1:27:27] where we say uh uh uh
[1:27:30] they'll quote quoting the scripture
[1:27:31] where it says a little wine for the
[1:27:34] belly sake it like bro
[1:27:35] that's a whole lot of wine you drinking
[1:27:39] you must be sick every day
[1:27:44] go to folk houses they got two three
[1:27:46] bottles of wine up in the refrigerator
[1:27:50] right and then the prophet of god tells
[1:27:53] the stories and we
[1:27:54] all some of us knows this i noticed
[1:27:58] personally how how alcohol
[1:28:01] has destroyed families
[1:28:05] alcohol relationships and marriage and
[1:28:09] things of that nature right alcohol
[1:28:13] alcohol was around way longer than meth
[1:28:16] and
[1:28:16] and cocaine and some of this other stuff

[1:30:39] oh and it was oh that's funny
[1:30:42] i'm telling you so we got to be careful
[1:30:46] i've watched people snicker in church
[1:30:49] and
[1:30:49] and make jokes and make fun and things
[1:30:52] of that nature thinking

[1:31:08] preach this morning
[1:31:10] i've watched people just be casualties
[1:31:13] of war
[1:31:15] right folk get folk getting caught up in
[1:31:19] things that they
[1:31:19] do not really understand spiritually
[1:31:24] put their mouth on the man of god put
[1:31:27] their mouth
[1:31:28] on the teachings of god and and they go
[1:31:31] right on
[1:31:32] and they wonder why why can't i amen
[1:31:36] be stable why can't i be anchored
[1:31:39] because you disrespected god you got out
[1:31:42] of your place
[1:31:44] right amen god was dealing with
[1:31:48] moses
[1:31:51] is that right glory to god that was
[1:31:53] god's
[1:31:54] vessel that was god's anointed
[1:31:58] oh that's funny because he married uh
[1:32:01] this woman
[1:32:02] that's funny to you all
[1:32:05] huh we need to talk about this then yeah
[1:32:09] i'm i'ma show you just how funny this is
[1:32:12] and see watch watch moses moses had to
[1:32:16] stand in the gap
[1:32:19] find him right so that god didn't wipe
[1:32:23] them out
[1:32:24] i was reading the quote brother madam
[1:32:26] say you know uh
[1:32:28] god god cleansed her but she ain't live
[1:32:31] long after that
[1:32:34] right god cleansed her but she didn't
[1:32:36] live long after that
[1:32:38] he purged him right glory to god
[1:32:42] you got to be careful what you putting
[1:32:44] your lips on
[1:32:45] you get out of place and you get called
[1:32:47] you'll pay for it
[1:32:49] cause everything is not funny to god
[1:32:52] look at
[1:32:53] look at the prophet of god's wife
[1:32:56] she was right she was
[1:32:59] right husbands do those things
[1:33:04] we go hunting we go fishing you know
[1:33:09] most of the time you know we we do
[1:33:12] little things
[1:33:13] but i still don't give you a right
[1:33:17] right oh hallelujah
[1:33:20] well well you always gone i always got
[1:33:23] to deal with these children
[1:33:25] and uh she was right
[1:33:28] but it was her attitude right
[1:33:32] that got her in trouble right it didn't
[1:33:35] bother the man
[1:33:36] it didn't bother the prophet he knew
[1:33:39] yeah yeah i know i know i know i know i
[1:33:42] know
[1:33:42] but god say yeah yeah they didn't
[1:33:46] may not bother you but that bothers me
[1:33:50] that bothers me you go to you you go
[1:33:52] talk to her you go
[1:33:53] tell her and the it's the thing that had
[1:33:56] been laying
[1:33:57] dormant kind of that tumor that had been
[1:34:00] laying dormant
[1:34:02] he was seeing it but it wasn't there but
[1:34:06] it was there
[1:34:08] but the moment she done that that thing
[1:34:11] materialized
[1:34:14] right why why it was that
[1:34:18] god god saw because god demands respect
[1:34:23] for his servants i'm gonna say that
[1:34:25] again
[1:34:26] god demands respect
[1:34:30] let me keep i'm gonna read this morning
[1:34:32] just a tad
[1:34:34] amen i hope it's all right
[1:34:38] i'm not here to hurt anybody i'm not
[1:34:40] here to belittle anybody i i just
[1:34:42] you know i have to preach what's on my
[1:34:44] heart right
[1:34:45] he says um he says now that don't mean
[1:34:49] you're you're afraid just talking about
[1:34:51] god right
[1:34:52] he said but that means that that you are
[1:34:55] giving him respects and reverence and
[1:34:57] when you respect god you fear god
[1:35:01] right you fear that and i like this next
[1:35:04] day he said you feel that
[1:35:06] in the message of respect uh i'm not
[1:35:08] sure what is
[1:35:10] quoted he says you fear that you might
[1:35:13] displease
[1:35:14] him in some way but i i
[1:35:17] i retract just a little bit or i'll back
[1:35:20] back just a bit
[1:35:21] these things come by experience
[1:35:26] right glory to god this is why
[1:35:29] we have to say the things that we say
[1:35:33] it's imperative that we say oh he just
[1:35:36] hurt my feelings
[1:35:38] i'm not here to hurt your feelings i'm
[1:35:41] here to try to keep you out of hell
[1:35:45] right i'm going i'm still preaching i'm
[1:35:48] taking my time but i'm trying to get
[1:35:50] there
[1:35:51] that's it i i won't hurt y'all for the
[1:35:54] life of me
[1:35:56] right but amen i'm mandated by god to
[1:36:00] preach truth
[1:36:02] they shall know the truth truth make you
[1:36:05] free error binds you up a lot of people
[1:36:09] think they free
[1:36:10] but they not free they got shackles
[1:36:14] they shackle and don't even realize
[1:36:16] someone realize it
[1:36:19] right shackles because of error
[1:36:23] error have you so bound and messed up
[1:36:29] see your your lack of understanding of
[1:36:32] doctrine
[1:36:34] right your lack of understanding of what
[1:36:36] god is
[1:36:37] doing right i don't know why brother
[1:36:41] jack doing this
[1:36:42] it ain't unless he reveals it to you it
[1:36:45] ain't none of your business
[1:36:48] come on come on why he said
[1:36:52] that if it wasn't for you it ain't none
[1:36:54] of
[1:36:55] your business

[2:01:40] that's the only way you're going to be

[2:01:43] i i'm reminded of um even before i
[2:01:46] started pastoring
[2:01:48] and i set up under uh brother james
[2:01:52] and it was times where it was things
[2:01:54] that i
[2:01:55] always understand
[2:01:58] right but i didn't
[2:02:01] fight him right
[2:02:06] my mindset was this i don't understand
[2:02:10] it all and i was
[2:02:10] i was a lot younger in the faith
[2:02:14] and in the ministry back then
[2:02:17] right uh but i always just
[2:02:20] wanted to give the benefit of the doubt
[2:02:22] and trust
[2:02:24] that he was being led to god
[2:02:27] right i did i i trusted
[2:02:30] i always gave him the benefit of the
[2:02:33] doubt
[2:02:34] you know it's like listen if god placed
[2:02:37] this man
[2:02:38] here to be my leader i got to trust the
[2:02:42] fact that god knows what he's doing
[2:02:46] right oh listen church
[2:02:49] just trust that god got our
[2:02:52] best interest at hand i've been
[2:02:56] just kind of uh watching brother jack
[2:02:59] and his
[2:03:00] leadership and uh i'm i'm impressed
[2:03:04] 110 i'm impressed i'm i'm glad
[2:03:07] i'm here for the ride
[2:03:11] i'm i'm on board for the ride and uh
[2:03:14] god is god is doing some great things
[2:03:17] and i miss
[2:03:18] and uh continue to keep him in prayer
[2:03:22] continue to keep us in prayer um
[2:03:27] i mean i'm here as long as god wants me
[2:03:29] to be here
[2:03:31] i have no plans on passing let me get
[2:03:33] this out here right quick and then i'm
[2:03:34] going
[2:03:35] i have no plans on pastoring another
[2:03:37] church
[2:03:38] well i asked you to be praying for me
[2:03:40] just pray for me
[2:03:42] right but i'm not planning on pastoring
[2:03:44] another church
[2:03:46] i don't i'm not trying to take another
[2:03:48] church i don't want another church by
[2:03:50] the grace of god
[2:03:51] now god forces me like he did before
[2:03:54] ain't got no choice but just pray for me
[2:03:57] basically it's it's my my work situation
[2:04:01] uh i've had to kind of go take a job
[2:04:05] didn't want to do that uh i don't really
[2:04:08] like working for folk
[2:04:10] i like being my own boss the liberties
[2:04:13] and
[2:04:14] not being tied down and and so
[2:04:17] when i had the church praying for me
[2:04:18] that was what it was all about was more
[2:04:20] or less about work
[2:04:22] and whether or not go get a job uh
[2:04:25] or you know continue to go on my own
[2:04:29] and uh right now i i had to just kind of
[2:04:34] that's what came the job came
[2:04:38] and uh i'm one i got to get my bills
[2:04:40] paid and i got to have
[2:04:41] money so i can't sit after two or three
[2:04:44] weeks sitting home i start
[2:04:46] like oh lord
[2:04:49] you stop putting putting out and ain't
[2:04:51] nothing coming in that ain't no good
[2:04:52] feeling
[2:04:54] you know i don't have it like that
[2:04:57] uh so so just continue to pray for me
[2:05:00] if god wants me wants me to go back on
[2:05:03] my own i
[2:05:04] he'll open the doors and make the way
[2:05:07] but right now
[2:05:08] um i'm you know i'm still trying to feel
[2:05:11] my way
[2:05:13] and just how god wants me to do it if
[2:05:17] if it's preaching you know he'll open
[2:05:20] the doors
[2:05:21] i don't know what to do this uh you know
[2:05:25] this is so different for me now i mean
[2:05:27] after pastoring i knew for 23 years
[2:05:31] what i was going to be doing thursday
[2:05:33] and
[2:05:34] and and sunday i knew what i was going
[2:05:36] to be doing

[2:06:15] and a half years
[2:06:16] before we started pastoring so you know
