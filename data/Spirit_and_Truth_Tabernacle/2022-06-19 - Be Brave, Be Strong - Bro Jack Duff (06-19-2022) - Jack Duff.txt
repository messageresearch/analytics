that brother troy was just mentioned that we are we're down quite a few uh this morning because they're like i said just an uptick of different ones that are testing positive but from my understanding many are getting in and getting over it just like that so we thank god for that but when we see an uptick like that we just encourage everybody to just mask up and just be very very not just protective of yourself but protective of others because we just don't want to see anybody pass from something like this especially something that we could prevent and uh you know and i know that uh you know by the grace of god all of us have been making it through i think some this is the first time and i think this thing been here since 2019 this is the first year that some of them just got it so god's been good to us i mean god's been real good and and we're grateful for that so i did want to thank the lord for uh sister meena tom wing amen being with us uh on today she um i know her from uh back in new york and going to the meetings and sister tom wing moved here to delray beach about a year ago and i just got heard about our church and said i want to come visit so sister cheryl

really wonderful job and seeing comments come on on our youtube channel people just enjoying the word of god so god bless you brother smiley amen on that and just just amen god is good and i want to reiterate brother troy's comments for brother simba and sister ruth thank y'all for just persevering and i saw the pictures and i was just very very happy to see spiritual truth 2.0 launch and uh you know just a fellowship just amongst the young people just look look very very good and i'm just happy about that and and even i know the the couples getting ready to start uh doing what they're doing this is all a part of our intentional amen plan so we're looking forward to seeing what god's gonna bring out of all of this amen praise god so we just really appreciate you all um all right i i just gonna be a real short scripture reading and uh first corinthians chapter 16 and uh verse 13 is where we will read from god's word amen on today amen first corinthians chapter 16 and and verse 13. it says watchy stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong amen uh we certainly want to wish a happy father's day to all the fathers and brother roberts so good to see you amen amen on the day god bless you uh let us just bow in a word of prayer and um we will uh get ready for the word father we thank you for the ability to read the word of god but we know it takes the holy spirit to quicken what has been read god we pray that you would speak to us and we thank you lord for um uh just being with us even during this time we know many of the saints some of our young ones some of our uh uh mature saints lord just just everybody being touched and impacted by uh lord just what's been going around and we just pray that you would continue to stay the hands of the enemy that you would touch each and every one that you would raise us up again and father we just trust that you would continue to get glory and honor out of all this we we know that you told us it would not come nigh our dwelling amen so as one brother said it came to pass it did not come to stay but it came to pass so we're thanking you for healing amen and each and every person even right now we act so god that as we enter into the word that you take control of every thought and that you god would just speak to us lord in only a way that you can we exit you to have your way here today in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the lord amen amen uh so happy father's day to all the fathers and and i just kind of felt in my heart that i i wanted to be intentional amen about uh speaking to uh the dads on today amen and just with a little sermon i want to title this be brave be strong amen be brave be strong and it's more of i would say just more of a a talk with uh with our fathers you know we we we often times uh as fathers we we're not encouraged that all the time right uh oftentimes always do this do that and people trying to you know shape you up and all kind of things but we want to try to say something that'd be encouraging uh to you uh today so just just just just bear with us be brave be strong amen is our thought and uh as i was just meditating amen on this uh little thought here for father's day you know typically what happens with me i'm always thinking about these different days and you know i know brother brandon when it comes to mother's day brother brandon say every day is mother's day you know and uh and i agree with what the prophet is saying but you know i i think it's good that we stop and take time to honor the mother's mother's day but also think it's good that we stop and take time to honor our fathers on father's day amen everybody in here has a father you wouldn't be here if you didn't have one right and uh and whether your dad was a good man a bad man he was still your daddy come on somebody all right and uh and and you know and the thing of it is i was just sitting here thinking in my mind um you know if we went through the scripture and looked at some of the different men that were in scripture which one would you choose as your dad right which one would you say i wish that was my daddy you know and i thought about different ones and said noah would you want noah to be your daddy come on somebody you would be building an ark if noah was your daddy you would be building an ark and you'd be on the ark hallelujah i mean i can imagine noah's children didn't go too many places amen they couldn't work too many other jobs they had to work on the ark hey come on somebody no quitting no no no no no no giving up no you're going to work on this ark with me amen this is for your protection this is for your future this is for your safety right i mean you're gonna have to do this with me and if you think about it some of the traits that are in your daddy now were in noah back then i'm raise you this way because this is going to be for your safety this is going to be for your future hallelujah all right now i mean you know just just different ones that we can look back in scripture amen and say if that was your daddy what would you do right amen moses having to apply blood on the door and and things like that what what what a great responsibility he had but my what what what pressure would have been to be one of noah i mean moses children glory to god amen amen amen so you know we we look we look we look at this and the one thing that we do know is that uh we uh we uh we don't we don't control who our parents are it's god that does that and god god god is the one that actually uh knew before you were even born which way you're gonna come through here hi i mean which which which womb you were gonna come through and that was god's great plan he knew which man he was gonna use to bring you glory to god that was god's great plan so what we want to do is at least take time and thank god for what he has done and placing fathers in our life uh oftentimes we hear of the terms deadbeat dad or absent fathers and and and and and in general terms i feel like uh these words are being sometimes used in general discussions used in the wrong manner and and and oftentimes maybe something in life that we've gone through and and we feel like if my daddy would have been if my daddy wasn't absent amen then uh i would be better you gotta understand some things you you make choices just based on it's not based on what your daddy did or what your mama did it's based on the choices you're making as a as a young man coming up i played football and and my dad was not interested in football he wasn't interested in it and and so my dad had never showed up to any of our games right but uh and we were baseball players and and and uh you know daddy would pay for us to get into the league and all that but he didn't he didn't he was not a sports man so he didn't he didn't get involved in a lot of that now i could allow that to just say well my dad never came to my game so i'm no it was okay as long as you pay for me to go i'm good dad praise the lord i'll come back and tell you about the the home run i tried to hit amen and a touchdown i scored i'ma come and share something with you right and daddy might not get in he might not get excited about it don't even don't even face him but it didn't bother me as long as i had the opportunity to be able to do the things that i could do and what you would what i come to understand my dad is different from me god made me made us different but he he still chose him to be daddy so i still respect him i still honor him in the place that he has in my life come on somebody all right so you know uh when we use these terms as i say loosely amen this general discussion we said my daddy was absent but but you gotta understand a man the real definition of an absentee father and uh you know and a dad beat dad the real definition is a a person that's avoiding child support that's the real definition they're not paying child support hallelujah so you got and and the only way that your daddy gonna really be paying paying child support is that something had to happen between him and your mama and he left all right somebody then he'd have to be paying child support glory to god but here i want to take a little further amen um you know and and i'm i'm using this from two different angles because you know we got to stop uh labeling our fathers negative with negative labels amen glory to god now i'm not here to i i i will say this i'm not i'm not blind that there are some fathers amen that are avoiding child support not necessarily in the money that they're paying but emotionally they are avoiding child support come on somebody amen uh sometimes a man we gotta look at things a little deeper than what they are we we're avoiding child support by being able to provide wisdom amen providing guidance glory to god amen it's not always just about the money that we provide but it's all these areas that a man must step up into in order to bring support to his child or his children many men thought it was just all about just the money the money the money the money the money but they missed all the other elements that was needed in the development of the child i thank god i had a daddy that was very intentional about taking us on vacation he's planted those seeds in us so when i when i got up i wanted to do the same thing with my children i thank god for that i had a daddy that that you know uh he actually want he had ambition he wanted to get out he bought a house with my dad and i remember when we when we was growing up we lived in an apartment i can take you and show you the street where we lived on over on wednesday amen we're living over there in an apartment but my daddy wasn't satisfied with just just that apartment my daddy went to work and he got us a house [Music] glory to god you gotta understand that as daddies uh continue to thrive as daddies continue to kind of uh want better for their kids it causes their kids to want better the next generation glory to god it perpetuates if we don't have vision as fathers then we can't expect our children to have it either let me go a little further let me go a little further see it's just it's avoiding child support it's great it's greater than just the financial responsibility don't get me wrong i mean i told you i'm here to encourage you and sometimes just just sharing truth with you encourages you all right let me go a little further all right so uh i want to say this i believe child support expands beyond just finances uh i think this is uh something uh all families have to fight and and uh you know one of the one of the reasons that that that that that fathers may kind of disconnect and you know maybe they they um they physically or you know financially not providing the child support it's maybe it's something that the the father and mother disagree disagreed about something uh divorce amen comes up into the family and uh and now they're and what happens is that it's the children that's impacted the most when things like that happen glory to god and what i'm here to encourage is that is because i mean everybody go through pressures and everything like that in their in their marriages but i want to encourage the fathers be brave and be strong be brave and be strong right don't don't be so quick to quit but be brave and be strong glory to god uh some of some of you kids have watched some of your parents go through some tremendous things tremendous pressures in their in their marriage but yet somehow they they they still glued together they didn't allow a man of different pressures to actually pull them apart it could have it could have other marriages have been ruined by but but some somehow god has allowed these parents to stay together your father and your mother were both being brave and being strong hallelujah glory to god let me go a little further my thoughts cause me to reflect on what what really is a father a father is not just a man that can produce children amen after he has children i was just thinking the lord just told me he needs to be available after he has children a father needs to be available yesterday you know i was i was traveling i did a really quick trip uh you know and when when i was invited to do this i was i was really hesitant about doing it because i knew i was just coming back from vancouver uh and i'm like lord i just i don't know if i can i can pull this one off but it was the minister's uh getaway and and just just want to kind of sit and talk about uh things that just pastors go through and sometimes you don't have other folk you can just kind of open up to so it's good to be in a safe place with other preachers that's going through the same thing and just open up and get direction and and get encouragement so i said you know what i'm i'm a sacrifice and i'm a go brother nathan asked me to come and i'd say i'ma come so i was there in lexington kentucky and um and flew in on on sat friday morning and came back in came back home last night and uh you know and as i was there i'm like okay i need to get my sermon prepared i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do that and i'm gonna do this but you know this brother brother let's talk brother let's talk brother you mentioned this and i i'm like oh lord i ain't gonna get my sermon together and then then i got a little text from my uh my son-in-law he say uh it says uh brother jack what time is your flight leaving i say six o'clock and i already had it in my head that you know what i'm gonna do uh at this time this brother gonna be gone and this time this brother gonna be gone so now i'm gonna start working on my sermon i'm gonna so he said what time you got your flight i'd say six o'clock and then uh he says well me and becca was thinking that we'd drive over there and take you out to lunch and say okay that just changed my plan on my sermon and then and then now i could i could have said you know what uh i need to work on my sermon right now so i'm gonna just cancel but then i it just kind of hit me this is where the lord told them say a father needs to make himself available in order to be a father you need to make yourselves and it wasn't even dawning on me because sometimes i get so busy i forget what day it is but i didn't realize the reason my son-in-law and my daughter trying to get to me because it's father's day tomorrow and they will not have a chance to be with you so they want to be with you today and they want to take you out to lunch and i allowed myself to go out to lunch with some preachers and eat some ribs and then when they got to me i'm like i'm full already but i will go to cheesecake and get some pineapple upside down i will i will have some of that with y'all and we just sat there and had some fellowship but i had to make myself available oh hallelujah and sometimes that is we got to learn it's going to be a sacrifice on our time it's going to be a sacrifice in our pockets but we got to do these things in order to sow the right seeds in our children hallelujah so the lord told me yesterday you need to be available a father is not just a man that can produce children after he has children he needs to be available available to provide emotional support available to provide wisdom available to provide guidance available to provide financial support and the most important thing that i think a father has to do is provide spiritual development a father has to be able to do that the father has to lead his family spiritually praise god right uh and i put it this way he must be available to allow all of god's attributes to be expressed through him to his children you gotta you gotta be able to express god's love oh somebody you got to be able to express god's love when your children just all all messed up and but you as a father you got to be the one to be able to express god's love you know i was i was reminded of something brother smiler's preaching i guess last month it was and he made a he said you know they tell you that um men shouldn't cry he said that's that's a lie that men don't cry he says men do cry men do cry and uh and and and i was just reflecting and said you know i i'm i'm a person that i i don't cry often but i have cried i have uh it is an emotion that i remember you know when my daughter um when she left home you know man that was a big one for me that was a big one i mean i i walked out the house and went walking down the street and i just let out tears crying to god lord i did this and lord i did that and lord lord this lord that and father how did this happen oh did i did i do something wrong what what you know and i mean your whole world is just crumbling you just crying but then i got to a spot where i dried up my tears and i looked myself and looked at myself in the mirror and i said god i did the best i could and if i know i did the best i could and and look i i'm not perfect i know i'm not perfect right and there's probably some things i could have did better but i did the best i could right and i said i did the best i could i can't cry anymore i'm just going to keep praying now oh hallelujah glory to god i mean yeah we may cry as fathers but you know what we still got to be brave we got to be strong all right all right all right amen we got to be we got to allow a man uh god's attributes expect to be expressed through us amen that means god's love has to be expressed through us you know i was just blessed you know i just i just love the way that god does things and sometimes you don't see it all but last week i was i came home and i told y'all we have a uh we we got a big thing thursday night all my all my local family we get together my my daughters amen and son-in-law we get together and just try to have fellowship intentional intentional right and uh and the other other night my daughter and my son-in-law they sitting there playing scrabble now they know they know they already know you sitting there playing scrabble you ain't got to ask me you know you know what i'm getting ready to do i'm coming here to lay some words down on you right and uh and they're sitting there playing and saying dad you wanna yeah i wanna play just just set me up a little some tie up some towels here let's play and sit there just enjoying fellowship as a father i have to be available god's love god's mercy god's forgiveness we got to be able to express that we got to be able to show that through our actions god's love god's mercy god's forgiveness but you know what a father also shows one of the other attributes of god he has a father has to show god's judgment some of the decisions that he has to make they're like god's judgment oh and sometimes it go against what we want to do and what we think what we feel but a father has to provide that type of guidance it's for your protection it's for your future as a father he's the defender he's a protector he's a sustainer he's the enforcer he's the provider and a man that don't provide for his family is worse than infidel i want to tell you this morning god is calling for men to be brave and to be strong i want to use a quote here out of here you hear ye him um god's calling for brave men brother branham's going to make this comment in this particular quote but let's look at this he's talking about a little time that he was up in the mountains and uh man he got a just just out there and god just began to reveal some things to him brother and just got to shout and praise god out there in that mountain and it says this it says then something begin to move it says um uh oh it's good to be here and the sun bathed the evergreen froze from the rain and the sun shining against them made a rainbow and i said oh god you live in the mountain the rainbow represents the covenant he was to look upon a revelations one the rainbow had jasper and starting stone benjamin and reuben the first and last he that he that was which is and shall come the root and offspring of david and the morning star it says and as i looked at that my emotions become to a place where i could not hold it any longer i screamed to the top of my voice i had to give vent and i suppose if someone would have been in the woods they thought there's a maniac there somewhere from someone from the insane institution around and around the tree i went screaming to the top of my voice well i was feeling that way i was worshiping god he says and as i worship the lord around and around the tree all of a sudden a little pine squirrel oh the noisiest thing you ever heard he jumped up on a stump and he looked up towards me again chatta chatter chatter chatter chatter i thought did i excite you little fellow why i thought you ought to worship god with me you are a creator of god a creature of god it says why don't you worship me i thought oh don't we love him and around the tree i went just as hard as i could go didn't care i was worshiping god oh my cup was running over not to make a mock not to be seen i was being drenched in my feeling as david danced before the ark of the lord and i said look at this little pine squirrel i thought it was barking at me and he's the policeman of the woods anyhow and he goes and says and i notice down under the blowdown the great storm had forced the big eagle down in that blow down and that's what he was barking at not the noise i was making but the eagle was in pine cones there and up on the limb just a great big graceful bird called the eagle and i i stopped and i thought well i know you're in that wolf call and the elk call you're in the sunset you're in the rainbow you're just everywhere but what about this what kind of seed is this so i watched him a little while and i said well wonder why god wants me to look at that and all of a sudden i noticed the big eagle wasn't scared and look at this brother branham said this god don't want cowards god wants men that's brave amen he can't use a coward that's a run down and afraid to testify of your healing or tell your neighbors your boss what god has done for you or give praise to christ ashamed to speak up in the hour when the trial comes and you're afraid to say that you're a christian god can't use you i like that i like that i like that when the trial come amen a father a man a brave man is not is not afraid to to go back and and tell people his testimony oh i'm i'm i'm saying something i'm saying something i mean i i um uh i've watched this amen and and especially my brother-in-law watch i watch this one of the things that uh he's been criticized for amen is that he always shares his testimony glory to god and but but the thing of it is is that that is uh the testimony is what makes him the person he is today he always tell you this is the man i used to be but when i came in contact with this it changed me right and i haven't been that way since that time had i been the man i used to be man it would be trouble but i thank god for what god did for me hallelujah and you get you gotta understand every person has to come to a place where they experience that type of change oh yes you have to come to your own individual spot where you experience that type of change i'm reminded of brother capers glory to god he would share with you his testimony amen how he used to be a particular way but one day on a boat glory to god his his his partner leaving to to go in and get something else and he said well i'll be here when you get back and when he gets up to walking all of a sudden he runs in contact with the same thing paul came in contact with a great light hit him on the boat and he's knocked out for an hour and when he gets back up and it's not brother cape was telling everybody he's changed but when his partner got back the partner recognized man what has happened to you out here in the middle of the ocean man something's you you have changed like like moses that had had they had to put a veil on his face brother came with that change everybody could have an experience like that with god and when you get your own experience your own testimony you'll let nobody take it from you you can't my my failures hey come on somebody my mistakes my past you can't take it from me because i know god has changed me a man that's brave or stand on his testimony when everything else is falling down around them i'ma stand on my testimony oh hallelujah that's why you got to have you got to have your own experience with god amen you can have your own testimony no matter what anybody else is doing i'm standing on my own two feet i know what god has done for me hey hallelujah hey when god does it that way i mean the whole world could be crumbling the whole world could be crumbling around you but god i got something you gave it to me god oh hallelujah god don't want cowards god wants men that's brave he can't use a coward that's run down and afraid to testify of your healing tell your neighbors your boss what god has done for you and give praise to christ ashamed to speak up in the hour when the trial comes you're afraid to say that you're a christian god can't use you i doubt he says such such as that uh that's right you're you're not much good for nothing for anything then he says but this eagle i noticed him being brave i noticed this eagle being brave and i thought i'll try out this bravery and i said fella those great big gray eyes looking at me and then the pie squirrel and i said do you know i could shoot you uh which which i wouldn't i admire him too much i said do you know i can shoot you he just kept moving his wings and i said i'll test it i grabbed my gun looked for the gun jumped and he looked at me and he kept moving his wings oh i said thank you father i see what it is you have provided that eagle with two wings and as long as he can feel that those those wings are in condition see he is blown down bone down by the storm but he's just testing his wings and as long as he can feel that those wings were in condition he knows that he can beat me into the top of them bushes he has confidence in his god given protection and if the eagle can have confidence in his god-given protection what ought the church should do with the holy spirit your god-given protection and tutor when sickness strikes or when trouble strikes oh i i i we got something we can lean on right and i was just thinking you know the the the storm forced the eagle down the storm forced the eagle down and oftentimes in life as men there are various storms that come into our life and they force the eagles down amen uh some of the storms in life maybe you lose a job or even your whole career right maybe loss of a marriage a divorce can force an eagle down a man maybe the loss of a child uh through death or either through uh being a runaway glory to god or maybe a child to drug addiction or alcoholism when you know you've raised them differently maybe a child that's uh determined to follow the things of the world and you want them to follow the word of god amen you lose a child these things can force an eagle down but an eagle when you're down just remember you can just kind of flap those wings amen god gave you two wings glory to god and and those two wings should keep you in action amen that's what brother branham told us that the cherubim were given two wings to keep them in action uh another thing those two wings amen uh provide to us glory to god is the wings of prayer glory and we know that when we can take things to the lord in prayer somehow somewhere god gonna change this thing glory to god another thing i thought about those two wings is one wing represent the old testament amen the other wing represent the new testament and somewhere between there i can find me a scripture that i can mount up on wings like eagles hallelujah and i'm gonna get through this situation somehow i'm gonna be brave i'm gonna be strong glory to god amen let's go back to the scripture here first corinthians 16 and 13. lord um we find something i just want to kind of break this break into this just for a little bit says watchy stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong uh just kind of looked at that word watch at the very uh beginning of this this scripture and watch means amen to be awake to be vigilant vigilant amen uh it says uh to watch metaphorically and i'm using greek lexicon definition here it must give strict attention to be cautious be active amen to take heed lest through remission and ambulance some destructive calamity calamities suddenly overtake one now i wanna i want you to catch this now um give strict attention to be active be cautious and take heedless through remission or and indolence some destructive calamity suddenly overtake one now what remission is is is led up so uh less through letting up if a father you know lets up sometime and he doesn't stay actively involved i'm talking about when you've been hurt that's when you've been hurt your children hurt you but somehow you still got to recognize you still daddy amen and they're not going to get no other daddy so daddy can't let up remember i told you hey man oftentimes when um uh uh uh when we get dad dad beat dads and somebody's not paying their child support it's because something has happened between the father and the mother and and the person that suffers the most is the children because of what happens between the father and the mother so father has to be intentional about remaining engaged not just with his money oh glory to god a father has to be intentional about engaging you know he can't let up he can't pull back from the children because oftentimes you know we see this in in many marriages uh you know sometimes uh uh a father he'll withdraw his financial support when he's trying to punish the mother a man a mother will dr withdraw her emotional support come on this is what happens in family and the children are the ones that go lacking you need both a father and a mother hallelujah there are times that my kids will intentionally get me involved in some of the you know choices that they got to make they want to know what my advice is they'll go to mama to get mama's advice but they also sometimes it's good i'm gonna also go to my daddy and talk to my daddy let's see what he think about this even if you already know what his thoughts are imagine noah was your father and noah and yuki's daddy you know i was they had a job over here and i was thinking about uh applying for it um you know no i got work for you to do right here you're gonna build this arc and you know the other thing about it you're not even gonna get paid imagine if noah was your father but not imagine if you would have left noah's house right running out there doing your own the daddy i'm tired of you and then the rain come because pride wouldn't let one of them boys come back home pride would not allow them to come back home pride is what keeps people out there today pride stops people from getting things right with god pride will not allow that boy but by him just subject himself to his daddy's counsel now now now you got to understand god did not speak to anybody else god didn't speak to noah's wife god didn't speak to noah's sons god didn't speak to uncles aunties teachers didn't speak to nobody the only one who had the word of the lord was noah and them boys had to subject themselves to what dad is speaking to my to to what god is speaking to my daddy it's the truth anyhow but if they would by by them just being obedient and subjective it saved their lives all right even if you know daddy gonna say something that's against what you want to do get his advice amen here look at this through remission that means let up and that's so dad is i wanna i wanna encourage you as fathers remain engaged no matter where your children are in their life remain engaged remain engaged they know what's right and what's wrong every time they look at you they know but just remain engaged another thing it says through remission and indolence indolence is avoidance i want to say that i want to make sure we get ambulance i mean is avoidance a father intentionally avoiding certain things because he don't want to be bothered but you have to understand that's a trick from the enemy because when you when when you when this description says watch right watchy so if you're not watching and you let up or you avoid he says then some destructive calamity suddenly will overtake one now you think it's bad now satan want to make it worse but but as a father a father can stand there a man just his presence keeps things intact let me just give you all a quick quick quick example you know i remember a few years ago my wife sharing this uh with me there was a a group of elephants that they wanted to do a um uh they want to just kind of do some testing with and and and you know experiment and so they they decided that with these this this pack of elephants that they were going to get all the older male elephants and pull them out of the tribe and kind of put them in another part of the jungle and um another country even took him flat flew him to a whole other country some kind of way and you know so they got these elephants there and they noticed that when they took the elephants out here the younger younger elephants younger male elephants with the mothers but they've taken the older males out and just left them there with the mothers and they noticed that uh they would come into that jungle area and they'd see different all the rhinos just dying off and they couldn't understand what was going on was like like somebody was taking a spear and just going right into these rhinos and killing them all and like well what hunters out here doing this who's doing this and uh they said no there's not nobody hunting this is this is this something else going on so they decided to bring the the male el the older male elephants back into the situation reintroduce them to the tribe and when they brought them back they noticed that the rhinos weren't dying anymore and what was going on is that the younger the younger elephants were the ones taking their their tusks and just going right through these rhinos and because they didn't have guidance the male elephants provided the guidance and i want to tell you this you know mothers can only do so much but you got to have fathers you got to have fathers begin to provide certain types of guidance and it's only when they brought those fathers back into the picture that the rhinos stopped dying the father's got to remain active the father's got to remain engaged the father's got to remain part of the whole structure let's look at this this uh next statement here in this scripture says watch he stand fast in the faith stand fast in the faith and and when we look at stand fast uh that means to uh to stand firm to persevere to persist and and i love it this this this greek definition to keep one's standing don't change your position as a father you got to be able to keep one standing when you standing on the word keep once now if you ain't standing the word change your position but if you when you stand on the word keep one standing don't let it down don't don't let down the daddies don't let it down amen you know it's going to take more than that from your son and your daughter in order to make it you got to be the one to hold that standard amen the world want to pull here in the world keep your standing all right look at this i want to just um i want to just uh read a little something here there's a a a a quote that i want to read out of expectation and i'll just kind of set this up for a little bit brother branham was talking about in vancouver they had a uh um they heard about a contest where they were riding bicycles and you had to be able to ride the bicycle across this wire with with no hands on the handlebars you had to be able to ride this bike and the swin bicycle company was going to was going to give any boy prize that could ride it uh so many yards without falling off and so some of the boys got to riding a man the um uh you know the bikes and everybody get up there they just fall right off they just fall right off and they said one of the mama's boys they call her my mama's boy he got up on his bike and he took over they just thought for sure this boy wasn't gonna make it a man a man a man but somehow the boy he wrote that thing all the way down to the end and they made a comment here here in the message expectations said fellas i tell you what you did say when you got on they give you a push you started off and you was watching like this trying to keep yourself on the board so that's what made you get wiggly amen and nervous and fall off he said i never looked down there i said i watched the m and just kept my eyes on the end and rode steady right to the end so yeah i watched the end hallelujah so that is when you're standing firm you're not making a decision for now come on somebody you're watching the end to see what's going to be the end of this decision see as a father i want to i want to do things that's going to cause my kids to go grow closer to god not get further away from god i want you to grow closer to god hallelujah watch this he says i watched the end and just kept my eyes on the road and rolled uh steady right to the end and one of the reasons i i want my kids to grow closer to god i realize the rapture is at hand there's destruction going to strike the land and i want to make sure my my my kids are ready for this right i want y'all to make this rapture jesus is coming in your generation amen i mean we might as well just tell our kid jesus is coming in your in your lifetime and and if he don't come he's coming in your kid's lifetime y'all need to be ready keep your eyes on the end jesus coming what will it be then no matter what people say about you now or how you're persecuted for all that live godly in christ jesus yourself for persecution being made fun of and mocked and so forth but watch what it will be at the end that's where it will pay off just hold steady and keep your eye on the end that'll be good for you all right this um scripture also says here watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong quit you like men be strong think about that quit you like men and what quit quit does not actually mean what you thinking in your mind quit don't mean quit in this portion of scripture quit action means to be brave quit you like men means to be brave to show oneself a man be brave hallelujah and what is brave brave is amen it's an adjective it's uh it's you're ready to face and endure danger or pain you're showing courage you're ready to face danger endure pain amen you're showing courage in the midst of whatever it is that you're facing uh obvious examples of somebody that was brave jesus went to the cross it showed us that he was brave david when he faced goliath it showed that he was brave amen david had a few men that would fight and br they went to get water fought through philistines to go get the water fought through phyllis got the water and went back to to take david to what had to fight through philistines on the way back it showed their bravery and david got the water and then poured it out didn't even drink it men almost i mean men almost lost their lives but it showed their bravery they were willing to endure the danger they were willing to endure the pain they were willing to show so show courage as fathers we got to be willing to endure pain and i'll tell you when you know when my it just seemed like my world just kind of turned upside down i mean i got my family got this got that got that and my daughter just decided she wanted to do something a little different i i got to respect her decision she's a grown woman i got to respect the city and then i can't withdraw my love i can't withdraw my support i can't withdraw i got to somehow overcome that and still be a part of everything when i see him now going on to college getting a master's degree i say oh i'm proud of you i'm happy for you glory to god amen i mean i'm happy for all the things accomplished but my greatest thing to see in all of my children is their service to the lords and you know what i'm going to always hold that position no matter what they accomplish in life i i thank god for for all my daughters all of them are doing doing very well you know and and what i call positive contributions to society you know one working in hr another doing uh uh upgrading i mean updating people's websites and and things like that and that that was me i worked in i.t so kind of following my footsteps my daughter here she's fixing people teeth dental hygienists you know and and i and i'm you know it's it's good as a father to be able to when somebody asks what your kids do oh this wouldn't do this it's good to be able to say yeah they they got professional jobs i'm happy about that i don't have to tell us well um um they they not working how old are they uh they they're not working well are they in between jobs no it's been a while they ain't they they they they they haven't worked in a long time you know you don't want to be able to you want to be a positive contribution to society amen right so i'm proud of him but the most the most important thing i want to see him serving the lord that's the most important thing amen i mean look because everything you accomplish in this world is going to come to an end when you reach the grave no matter what you no matter what you get it's going to come to an end once you reach the grave even the job that you get you're making a lot of money let me tell you something if you die today they will replace you they'll replace you right so so so the most important thing is is your relationship with the lord they used to have a song they're saying only what you do for christ will last amen only what you do for him will be counted in the end only what you do for christ will last so yes there's a balance we got to live in this world and i and i want you to live the best life you can live while you're here amen ain't no sense and uh uh let me just put it this way ain't no sense in us shortchanging ourselves on this side when i'm headed to streets ago right glory to god i'm headed the streets ago so i'm going to show them change myself on this side i'm gonna live the best life i can here but i'm gonna keep god involved i want to read the scripture here this uh quit you like men go to go with me in 2nd samuel chapter 10. praise the lord uh second samuel chapter 10 and uh verse 6 is where i want to start from this is a time in david's reign where he was um he's actually complimenting somebody and they took his compliment as a threat they misinterpreted the compliment and they thought it was a threat so um uh in thinking there's a threat they they responded in a in a different way like david sent these men to him sent some his soldiers and and and i think the bible said they cut the men's garments off and uh so they was walking down the street uh half covered half naked which a lot of people do today right but uh it was it was embarrassment they also shaved their beards and you know did all kind of thing and it was embarrassment to these to these soldiers uh so david you know say you know what we're gonna have to go here and and fight you know we gotta we we got to show them that they can't they can't handle things that way so joab a man one of david's uh military leaders is leading a group of um of soldiers out into the battle uh he and his brothers are leading to this battle so let's let's pick up uh in verse six what happens when the children of ahmad saw that they stink before david and what this means is that their actions were not approved of uh you know david didn't like that and david was gonna respond to it right they stink before david the children of amman sent and hired the syrians of beth harab and the syrians of zoba thousand foot men and a uh king maca thousand men and i've ish ish top twelve thousand men and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty man said the children of amman came out and put the battle and array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and the rahab and ishtab and makkah were by themselves in the field when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in a ray against the syrians and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them an array against the children of ahmad alright so they got syrians got the children of ahmad in the middle of this this great battle and he says um and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but the children of our mind be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee it's good to know sometimes as fathers that you got other brothers standing with you amen to fight with you in the battle amen here in verse 12 says be of good courage and let us play the man for our people amen let us play the men uh for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seem seen with uh him good and when they're playing the men this mean they're going to be brave amen they're going to be brave they're going to face this thing head on they're not running from it they run into it and and let me just keep reading here um verse 14 13. and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him and when the children of amman saw that the syrians were fled uh then fled they also before abhishah and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ahmad and and came to jerusalem a little stop there uh i just want to just kind of just share here um when david sent these men out joab and and and uh these other warriors out um joab recognized that they were surrounded you know and that this was gonna this is gonna be really something so we got the syrians on one side and we got children i'm out on the other side there's going to be something so you know when when um when he realized they were surrounded it would have been easy for him to just throw in the towel and sometimes his father's amen we find ourselves in situations where we realize we just surrounded surrounded with this problem surrounded with that problem surrounded with that problem i mean my god we're just foolish we just surround it and that's the time where fathers actually want to just throw in the towel right but i want to say don't throw in the towel be strong and be brave amen be brave be strong at the time and here's what here's what i felt and reading the story uh they made a decision to fight with what they had they couldn't go get no more uh but i'm a fight with what i got i mean i'mma trust the two wings like the eagles i'ma trust the two wings i'ma trust the old testament i'm gonna trust the new testament i'm gonna be active i'm gonna do everything i can and fight with what i got right and they made a decision uh to fight with what they had and and i want to the other thing that i i like is in the midst of them uh going through this this this great surrounding they devised a strategy to help them overcome the enemy glory to god it might have seemed like a it might have seemed like this ain't gonna work at all what i'm doing this little idea this little thought ain't gonna work at all but i wanna tell you fathers when you're going through your tough times come up with a strategy sit alone with god let god give you a strategy of something that you can do hallelujah amen and go forward with that strategy and watch it's going to help you overcome the enemy amen oftentimes uh as men we're surrounded by our failures we're surrounded by faith in business we're surrounded by choices we made in relationships and and some of the failures and relationships uh all kind of mistakes that we made uh in life but i'm here to tell you you can't quit be strong be brave amen devise and overcome a strategy and then stick to it here i want to uh just kind of bring i had a couple little things here that i wanted to uh mention but i'm i'm a move ahead here i'm gonna say this you can't rectify your past but you can certainly embrace your future commit to doing something different and watch what god does be strong mentally be strong physically be strong financially be strong be brave in every area every area of your life the quote that i want to read here from the prophet um oh my he talked about and i won't read this one but i'll just tell you he talked about arnold von winkelrit and how this man was so brave uh he was a gallant man and he realized that uh they were surrounded by the armies and they they knew that they were just on the way to defeat and you know and and arnold uh von winklery there in switzerland he was there in the battle and he did something that just uh just kind of inspired courage and all the men and uh he um the the weapons that they had were less superior than the army that they were fighting and it says you know they had these spears and they they were coming right in after him and he said you know we got to do something so he he uh he says you know what i i got a family over there i might not see him ever again i got a wife and kids i might not ever see him again but this day i'm gonna give my life for my country and they're like well what you gonna do arnold so you just watch me everybody just follow me and he took off into the middle of uh the where the where the toughest uh part of the battle was he took off running down start making a a big scene make way for liberty make way for the night what in the world is guy talking about make way for liberty it just took off running and as they took all these spears uh what they said this guy's a crazy man all of them took these spirits into going right at this guy arnold and arnold reach with all his arm reach with everything he had pulled the spears into him then realized that uh the the warriors by arnold taking on spears the warriors had nothing to fight with now his men could beat down those warriors he was brave he gave his life oh hallelujah brother branham says just the same as christ going to the cross to give his life for us he was brave sometimes fathers we got to be willing to give our life we got to stand in the gap as christ stood in the gap we have to be brave we have to be strong hearing this quote out of god had explained the prophet says this in my life i made many mistakes i've done lots of things that's wrong uh probably if i live much longer i'll do many more perhaps some of them will be stumbling blocks in your way i hope that you forgive me some of the things i've done it might might have been a stumbling blocking your way can you forgive me not just hold it against me but can you forgive me since i was reading of abraham and how that the flusterations that he had the things that he did he doubted god he lied about his wife and everything but when his divine commentary was written in romans 4 it never mentioned his mistakes but i said abraham never staggered at the unbelief through god but was strong all of his mistakes was all forgotten about when the divine commentary of his life was written says his frustrations wasn't even mentioned his mistakes wasn't mentioned brethren i hope that when my commentary is read that day that he'll rub mine out too and won't think about them i hope you do too god bless you and when brother branham says this then brother uh tommy hicks comes up to the microphone and he made the following comments and i'm glad that they didn't cut this part of the tape off because this is very good for brother tommy hicks he says i think that we can say this morning to sum up everything that's been said with these words christ in me the hope of glory is that satan please christ in me the hope of glory all right there's in and outs and overs in life of every man it says i have a message i'm not going to speak i have a message i believe that every christian has been jesus my heart is stirred this morning i believe that for many of us some things that that disturb us make us better men and women of god and they make this statement says babe ruth was known as the home run king it is but did you know that babe ruth was also the strikeout king he says he struck out more times than he ever made home runs he struck out 1 330 times he only made 860 home runs but every time babe ruth struck out he went back to the dugout when the old umpire holler you're out he went back to the dugout and he rubbed his hands and picked up the bat and pointed over the fence and he always said i feel sorry for that picture out there see there's nothing wrong in striking out but remember pick up that bat because christ and me the hope of glory say it again please christ in me the hope of glory he says it's everything everything that's right is everything uh arguing and fighting will never get the job done we're too close amen to the other side we've reached a point of no return it says how many times that i've heard the captain call back on the plane we've now reached a point of no return not long ago i heard a voice from another world that spoke to me this spoke to me and said son you've reached a point of no return that means i'm closer to the other side than i am from the point where i started from so i got to be brave i got to be strong i got to make it can i leave you just something here today as we wrap this up this is a statement that somebody had written um some
