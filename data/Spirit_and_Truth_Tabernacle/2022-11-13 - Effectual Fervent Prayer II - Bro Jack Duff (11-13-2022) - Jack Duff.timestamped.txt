[15:00] Psalms one
[15:01] [Music]
[15:16] praise the Lord
[15:18] Psalms 1 reads blessed is a man that
[15:21] walketh not in the counsel of the
[15:23] ungodly
[15:24] nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[15:27] sitteth in the seat of the storm
[15:29] but his Delight is in the law of the
[15:31] Lord
[15:33] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[15:35] night he shall be like the tree planted
[15:38] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[15:40] forth fruit and bringeth forth his fruit
[15:43] in his season his Leaf also shall not
[15:47] wither and whatever he doeth shall
[15:49] prosper
[15:50] the ungodly are not so but are like the
[15:53] chaff with the winning Drive of the way
[15:55] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[15:58] the Judgment nor sinners in the
[16:00] congregation of the righteous
[16:02] for the Lord nor the way of the
[16:03] righteous but the way of the ungodly

[1:21:04] effectual fervent prayer amen this will
[1:21:07] just be part two uh to our uh sermon
[1:21:10] from last week and
[1:21:13] um uh James 5 16 uh said confess your
[1:21:19] faults one or two another pray one for
[1:21:24] another that you may be healed the
[1:21:26] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:21:28] man a veileth much and I went home and
[1:21:32] just kind of looked at that same uh
[1:21:34] verse through the emphatic diet Glock
[1:21:37] amen and there uh this is the original
[1:21:40] translation into English uh there it
[1:21:44] says confess Therefore your sins to each
[1:21:47] other a man that says and pray for each
[1:21:50] other amen so that you may be healed
[1:21:54] glory to God and says the earnest
[1:21:57] supplication of a righteous man is very
[1:22:01] powerful
[1:22:04] glory to God the earnest
[1:22:07] supplication of a righteous man is very
[1:22:10] powerful this this just just the
[1:22:13] language of the scripture ought to tell
[1:22:15] you that everybody can't pray for you
[1:22:19] I mean man you can't just have anybody
[1:22:21] and everybody praying for you right you
[1:22:24] want righteous people praying for you
[1:22:27] Hallelujah I want somebody to live right
[1:22:30] hey man I'm not I'm not talking about
[1:22:32] all of us make mistakes here and there
[1:22:34] but I'm talking about people that's
[1:22:35] trying to live right before God I need
[1:22:38] that type of person praying for me come
[1:22:41] on somebody amen because of the earnest
[1:22:44] supplication of a righteous man is very
[1:22:48] powerful
[1:22:50] glory to God very very powerful you know
[1:22:54] so so when when we're talking about this
[1:22:56] amen this this effectual fervent prayer
[1:23:00] amen this type of prayer amen I said
[1:23:03] last week it activates Angelica systems
[1:23:06] amen and there's a a little something
[1:23:08] that I want to just kind of show how it
[1:23:11] activates it just Prayer Changes Things
[1:23:15] prayer prayer prayer is our weapon we we
[1:23:18] can't don't let the devil take that from
[1:23:20] you amen and why is it that always the
[1:23:23] devil fight our prayer life
[1:23:25] maybe he knows something that we just
[1:23:27] don't know if the weakest Christian
[1:23:30] could just get to their knees
[1:23:33] it didn't say how long they sat down
[1:23:35] there only but if they just got there
[1:23:37] they were in a position of power they
[1:23:41] were in a position of authority they
[1:23:43] were in a position to change something
[1:23:46] core I'm talking about the weakest
[1:23:49] Christian once they got to their knees
[1:23:52] Hallelujah and begin to open a mouth
[1:23:55] father
[1:23:57] in the name of Jesus man as they begin
[1:24:01] to pray something began to happen
[1:24:04] hey the heavens begin to shake
[1:24:07] L begins to shake Angels begin to get a
[1:24:11] sign demons begin to turn loose glory to
[1:24:15] God things begin to happen when the
[1:24:18] Saints begin to pray
[1:24:22] Glory Hallelujah
[1:24:25] why is it the devil fights this area in
[1:24:28] our life he realizes the power that's
[1:24:31] there
[1:24:32] there's so much power when we pray
[1:24:36] glory to God I was reading a man a
[1:24:39] portion of this son last week I wanted
[1:24:40] to just bring it back out of the message
[1:24:43] Jairus a secret believer
[1:24:45] uh the prophet says this he says could
[1:24:48] you imagine the position
[1:24:50] that uh put that that put Isaiah in
[1:24:54] here he comes right back through the
[1:24:56] gate again thus saith the Lord is going
[1:24:58] to live and we're going to read the
[1:25:00] scripture a little bit later right up to
[1:25:01] the soldiers thus said the Lord is going
[1:25:04] to live right into the celebrities thus
[1:25:07] said the Lord is going to live without
[1:25:09] imagine they'd say what kind of prophet
[1:25:11] is that what was the big difference
[1:25:14] because before the prophet had walked in
[1:25:16] say thus saith the Lord you are going to
[1:25:19] die
[1:25:19] and now the prophet has a turnaround
[1:25:21] before he can get to amen the furthest
[1:25:24] gate he has to come back through the
[1:25:26] courts and they want to they want to
[1:25:28] Prophet what is it Hallelujah why are
[1:25:31] you walking back in here now what you
[1:25:32] got to say he gonna live well what
[1:25:34] happened I'm not going to tell you what
[1:25:36] happened but I do know this much he
[1:25:38] gonna live
[1:25:39] glory to God I'll tell him when I get to
[1:25:41] him what happened amen glory to Gods
[1:25:45] amen so so he says he says what kind of
[1:25:48] property is that what was the big
[1:25:50] difference prayer
[1:25:51] change from Death To Life it'll do it
[1:25:55] for every sinner here tonight from Death
[1:25:58] to life if I could just pause there amen
[1:26:01] mamas that you believe in God for your
[1:26:04] children start praying right now
[1:26:09] because prayer could change them from
[1:26:11] Death to life sometimes all you want
[1:26:13] just Lord just get him into the
[1:26:15] atmosphere you remember brother Troy was
[1:26:17] Shannon's testimony say the reason I
[1:26:19] didn't want to go to church because I
[1:26:20] realize if I got there in that
[1:26:24] atmosphere
[1:26:25] glory to God he says I couldn't hold on
[1:26:28] in that atmosphere I couldn't keep
[1:26:30] sinning in that atmosphere something
[1:26:32] began to grip my heart in that
[1:26:34] atmosphere so mamas and daddies start
[1:26:37] praying
[1:26:39] things can change in the atmosphere like
[1:26:41] this we don't have to leave here the
[1:26:44] same way we came
[1:26:46] and even if your children not here start
[1:26:48] praying
[1:26:51] I'm gonna tell you some famous words
[1:26:55] that all of us like to hear
[1:26:57] amen some of us like to hear thus saith
[1:27:00] the Lord
[1:27:01] amen but another group of famous words
[1:27:03] that we like to hear your prayer has
[1:27:06] been heard
[1:27:10] you have reached heaven and your prayer
[1:27:12] has been heard
[1:27:14] glory to God
[1:27:16] glory to God God can give you the words
[1:27:18] today God can anoint somebody to speak
[1:27:21] to you your prayer has been heard you've
[1:27:23] been praying for this you've been
[1:27:24] praying for that God has heard your
[1:27:26] prayer man it brings a peace that passes
[1:27:30] all understanding
[1:27:33] glory to God here the prophet says this
[1:27:35] what kind of prophet is that what was
[1:27:37] what was the big difference prayer
[1:27:39] changed from Death To Life it'll do it
[1:27:41] for every sinner here tonight from Death
[1:27:42] To Life it'll do it for every sick
[1:27:44] person tonight not say today from
[1:27:46] sickness to health Prayer Changes Things
[1:27:48] So always bear that in mind pray without
[1:27:51] ceasing
[1:27:53] now I want to just stop right there with
[1:27:55] that quote amen prayer without ceasing
[1:27:57] that that's coming from first
[1:27:58] Thessalonians 5 16. that's what it tells
[1:28:01] us pray without ceasing you know and
[1:28:03] this type of prayer like I said it it
[1:28:06] activates Angelic assistance
[1:28:09] we want to just pick up a scripture here
[1:28:11] amen
[1:28:14] um to show you what prayer without
[1:28:15] ceasing and this disinfectual fervent
[1:28:18] prayer is all about I want to before I
[1:28:19] pick up the scripture I want to make two
[1:28:21] two comments this kind of prayer Works
[1:28:24] While others are not even expecting it
[1:28:27] to
[1:28:31] this kind of prayer effectual fervent
[1:28:33] prayer Works While others are not even
[1:28:35] expecting it to
[1:28:37] Hallelujah another thing I want to say
[1:28:39] about this type of prayer Supernatural
[1:28:42] results can be shocking to one that
[1:28:45] offers this type of Prayer
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:50] Supernatural results can be shocking to
[1:28:55] one that offers this type of Prayer
[1:28:58] all right amen glory to God in the days
[1:29:01] of Paul and Silas it caused an
[1:29:04] earthquake
[1:29:06] when they got they got the praying
[1:29:08] inside of a prison cell amen it caused
[1:29:12] an earthquake the other people were not
[1:29:14] expecting anything like that but the
[1:29:16] supernatural began to take place it
[1:29:18] activated Angelic assistance
[1:29:21] glory to God an earthquake and they were
[1:29:24] not only just a a Praying but they were
[1:29:27] praising God with their singing and that
[1:29:30] that activated Angelic assistance and it
[1:29:33] changed things
[1:29:34] I love what we we read last week where
[1:29:36] where uh Spurgeon said prayer and praise
[1:29:39] are the oars by which a man May roll his
[1:29:42] boat into the deep Waters of the
[1:29:43] knowledge of Christ
[1:29:45] Paul and Silas we can see an example
[1:29:47] that turn with me to Acts chapter 12.
[1:29:51] amen this kind of prayer works by others
[1:29:54] and not even expecting it and the
[1:29:56] supernatural results can be quite
[1:29:58] shocking to the one offering the prayer
[1:30:01] acts amen chapter 12.
[1:30:04] Glory Glory Glory Glory are you praying
[1:30:10] amen amen keep praying now even while
[1:30:13] you're in service be praying you ought
[1:30:15] to be praying Lord speak to me

[1:32:15] upon him and a light shine activating
[1:32:18] Angelic assistance glory god and amen
[1:32:22] and a angel of the Lord came upon him

[1:33:05] the angel said unto him gird thyself and
[1:33:08] bind on thy sandals and so he did and he
[1:33:11] said unto him cast that garment about
[1:33:14] thee and follow me

[1:37:19] together

[1:37:22] and ask Peter knocked at the door of the
[1:37:25] gate
[1:37:26] a dancer came to Harkin named Rhoda amen
[1:37:31] and when she knew Peter's voice she
[1:37:34] opened not the gate for gladness but ran
[1:37:38] in and told how Peter stood before the
[1:37:40] gate now can you imagine us popping

[1:37:51] most famous words you'll ever hear God
[1:37:54] has heard your prayer
[1:37:59] when I said I can stop praying about
[1:38:02] that I can find something else to pray
[1:38:03] for cause God has heard my prayer

[1:38:16] prayer can cause the results to be quite
[1:38:18] shocking
[1:38:20] yes sir Rhoda was shocked
[1:38:23] not only Roder but now she goes here in
[1:38:26] verse 14. amen and when when she knew
[1:38:29] Peter's voice she opened up the gate for
[1:38:31] gladness but ran in and told how Peter
[1:38:34] stood before the cape and they said unto
[1:38:37] her
[1:38:38] thou are mad
[1:38:41] these are praying people can I ask you a
[1:38:44] question do you believe what you prayed

[1:38:53] amen don't let it shock you now
[1:38:57] don't let it surprise you when you pray
[1:38:59] you activate
[1:39:02] Angelic assistance

[1:39:14] of Thou Art mad but she constantly

[1:39:19] they it is his angel

[1:39:25] jail
[1:39:27] look at this look at this amen it is his
[1:39:30] Angel but Peter continue to knock him
[1:39:32] and when they had opened the door and
[1:39:34] saw him they were astonished
[1:39:38] oh my I want God to surprise me with
[1:39:40] some things
[1:39:42] amen I want him to surprise me with some
[1:39:45] things I'm telling you this type of
[1:39:46] prayer can activate Angelic assistant
[1:39:48] there was no way Peter could have got
[1:39:50] out of this situation but while the

[1:40:38] Brother Branham
[1:40:39] things that he said about prayer
[1:40:41] so let's go and look at some of these
[1:40:44] praise God Amen this first statement
[1:40:47] that it says amen uh slot six is where
[1:40:51] I'm reading from says prayer is the most
[1:40:53] vital force that God ever put into the
[1:40:55] hand of mankind
[1:40:57] oh I like that prayer is the most vital
[1:40:59] force that God put ever put in the hand
[1:41:02] of mankind don't let the devil take this
[1:41:04] from you
[1:41:06] Hallelujah here's another one he says as
[1:41:08] you pray
[1:41:10] you lose sight of these Earthly things
[1:41:13] sit next the the right arrow
[1:41:17] um as you pray you lose sight of these
[1:41:19] Earthly things you sway out into
[1:41:21] somewhere else Way Beyond and on and on
[1:41:26] and on until you become uh into his
[1:41:28] presence
[1:41:29] I love that amen this next one that he
[1:41:33] says here Glory God says it's prayer
[1:41:35] that changes things
[1:41:38] oh hallelujah it's prayer that changes
[1:41:42] things all right here's another one
[1:41:44] glory to God he says with all true
[1:41:46] reverence there's not another force on
[1:41:49] the earth there's not nothing on Earth
[1:41:52] no matter what it is what kind of gift
[1:41:54] it is amen there's nothing in the world
[1:41:57] that will come ahead of prayer prayer is
[1:42:00] what does the work
[1:42:02] prayer is what does the word next one
[1:42:04] amen there it is glory to God all right
[1:42:07] here's another one that it says prayer
[1:42:09] is not exactly bringing God down to man
[1:42:12] is bringing man up to God
[1:42:18] hey prayers not you come having God come
[1:42:21] down to you is you good getting a godly
[1:42:23] perspective of what you're praying about
[1:42:26] especially when you're praying for
[1:42:27] somebody
[1:42:29] and I like to use the word for somebody
[1:42:31] you're not praying against nobody
[1:42:34] amen pray for your enemies not pray
[1:42:38] against your enemies
[1:42:40] God ain't hearing them kind of prayers
[1:42:41] God struck them dead for what
[1:42:45] for what
[1:42:46] they're not saved yet why you want them
[1:42:49] dead
[1:42:50] amen God help me to understand why they
[1:42:52] doing what they're doing
[1:42:54] Lord let me see what's going on in their
[1:42:56] life as as I get up into this atmosphere
[1:42:59] God you can show me maybe a little
[1:43:01] something about their life then I can
[1:43:02] then I can get why they did what they
[1:43:04] just did
[1:43:05] oh come on somebody
[1:43:07] oh Hallelujah you know remember uh
[1:43:10] brother Branham one time went to the
[1:43:12] restaurant and the the waitress was just
[1:43:15] treating them like I don't know what and
[1:43:17] some of them brothers like she won't get
[1:43:19] no tip for me
[1:43:21] oh some of y'all don't said that I guess
[1:43:23] and did that oh oh my Hallelujah hey
[1:43:28] Glory Glory Glory
[1:43:31] yeah
[1:43:32] Jesus
[1:43:35] hit a wall
[1:43:38] my God
[1:43:40] let's talk about it just for a little
[1:43:42] bit Saints
[1:43:44] of the most high God
[1:43:46] Christians
[1:43:50] we don't act like everybody else
[1:43:53] they don't have the spear to discernment
[1:43:55] like we got
[1:43:57] when somebody treating you all kind of
[1:43:59] ways don't get upset with them
[1:44:02] start praying
[1:44:05] God will help you to see okay uh brother
[1:44:07] Brandon said he was Darren the president
[1:44:09] oh she ain't gonna get no tip for me
[1:44:10] brother man say you know I'm gonna tell
[1:44:11] you something this morning she went
[1:44:13] through this at her house and because
[1:44:15] she went through that of the house it's
[1:44:17] it's what we call emotional leakage it
[1:44:19] is leaking over into this in the way
[1:44:21] she's serving us she don't mean to be
[1:44:24] this way it's just something that
[1:44:25] happened at her house it says so what
[1:44:27] we're gonna do is change her attitude
[1:44:29] and you know how we gonna change the
[1:44:31] attitude
[1:44:34] not just not just attempt but a real
[1:44:37] good tip
[1:44:39] something that got her attention whoa
[1:44:41] the way I just treated them and they
[1:44:44] treated me like this what kind of people
[1:44:46] is this we Christians and we praying for
[1:44:50] you
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:56] praying is not exactly bringing God down
[1:44:59] to man
[1:45:00] is bringing man up to God
[1:45:08] so some of y'all might need to go back
[1:45:10] to that restaurant
[1:45:14] find that waitress
[1:45:17] give her a tip
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] this next one says the Christian doesn't
[1:45:26] realize
[1:45:27] what a force he has when he kneels on
[1:45:30] his knees before almighty God In The
[1:45:32] Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize
[1:45:35] what power that is if the people could
[1:45:38] only realize that that was that what is
[1:45:41] given right unto them anything that you
[1:45:44] ask for will begin if you can
[1:45:46] appropriate the faith to believe it
[1:45:49] amen
[1:45:53] this last statement on this slide says
[1:45:55] one thing we can't do
[1:45:58] is pray too much
[1:46:00] as he said you can sing too much
[1:46:03] amen you can talk too much
[1:46:06] but you can't pray too much
[1:46:09] Hallelujah I'm telling you start praying
[1:46:12] it'll stop you from talking
[1:46:16] hello somebody cause you can't pray for
[1:46:18] somebody and talk about it at the same
[1:46:20] time
[1:46:21] you can't do it
[1:46:23] glory to God all right
[1:46:25] all right I'ma go on to uh another thing
[1:46:28] here in this word document
[1:46:31] um I just thank God for this uh pray uh
[1:46:34] when you said we can never pray too much
[1:46:36] reminded of Charles Spurgeon saying
[1:46:38] prayer can never be in excess Charleston
[1:46:41] Charles Spurgeon said that now here I
[1:46:43] want to bring you a little thought out
[1:46:44] of this message hear his voice now
[1:46:47] prayer
[1:46:48] certainly is uh is us coming into an
[1:46:51] atmosphere with God
[1:46:52] to maybe get his perspective on what it
[1:46:55] is that we're asking for
[1:46:57] sometimes God can let you know his
[1:46:59] purpose his plan his will when you just
[1:47:01] entering the prayer and prayer is not
[1:47:02] always you talking
[1:47:06] it's not always you talking
[1:47:08] Spurgeon told us last week he says you
[1:47:11] are before the Lord let your Words Be
[1:47:13] Few but let your heart be fervent
[1:47:16] now just look at what the prophet says
[1:47:17] here in this message hear his voice it
[1:47:20] makes a statement Amen in this sermon
[1:47:22] hear his voice it says then Moses just
[1:47:27] chucked full of theology
[1:47:29] amen he says he was to be the next
[1:47:31] pharaoh
[1:47:32] and we find him still not knowing god
[1:47:36] but one morning on the backside of the
[1:47:38] desert an old man of 80 years old his
[1:47:41] whisk is hanging way down low he's
[1:47:43] seeing a burning bush and he turned
[1:47:45] aside to see what was going on and when
[1:47:47] he got near the bush he heard a voice
[1:47:49] God had to quieten him for 40 years
[1:47:52] before he could ever speak to him
[1:47:54] and we don't and we won't stay quiet
[1:47:59] foreign
[1:48:08] 10 minutes
[1:48:10] so God can speak to us with all the
[1:48:13] rumble and Bumble we have of this day so
[1:48:15] when you start praying let me give you
[1:48:17] another little little thing you need to
[1:48:19] do when you're praying stop and listen
[1:48:24] don't don't get up too quick just just
[1:48:27] stop listen and brother random say we
[1:48:30] can't stop for 10 minutes
[1:48:33] our mind just gotta check this gotta do
[1:48:35] this gotta you ain't gotta do numbers
[1:48:37] stop and listen
[1:48:39] make your request known to God and now
[1:48:42] stop and listen for him to speak
[1:48:44] you know sometimes I come here on a
[1:48:46] Sunday morning and I'll be in prayer and
[1:48:48] you know I get the prayer and the next
[1:48:49] thing I start hearing God speak to me
[1:48:51] you know what I stop talking
[1:48:53] I get myself a pen and I start writing
[1:48:56] down whatever the Lord is telling me at
[1:48:58] that moment because you know the devil
[1:48:59] can try to steal that from me
[1:49:01] and it don't take God a long time to
[1:49:04] talk to you about some things
[1:49:06] oh Hallelujah somebody amen but you got
[1:49:09] to learn how to just get get in that
[1:49:11] channel be sincere in your heart
[1:49:18] and if if my words are gonna be few I'm
[1:49:21] gonna tell you right now the beginning

[1:50:01] Moses after 40 years stood there and in
[1:50:04] the presence of that bush and that one
[1:50:07] voice that called him he knew more about
[1:50:09] God in five minutes after that than all

[1:53:02] I'm telling you when you hear God's
[1:53:03] voice in prayer it changes you
[1:53:06] your decisions change your actions
[1:53:09] change your attitude changes
[1:53:12] everything changes when you hear
[1:53:15] from God
[1:53:17] here you know I I was telling you all
[1:53:19] last week that
[1:53:21] um Schofield had a note and he was tying
[1:53:24] the script to James 5 15 and 16 he was
[1:53:27] tying that into Mark 11 22 26 and and uh
[1:53:32] 22-26 but James 15 says in the prayer
[1:53:35] faith shall save the sick and the Lord
[1:53:38] shall raise them up and if he had
[1:53:39] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[1:53:41] him verse 16 confess your faults one to
[1:53:43] another and pray one for another that
[1:53:45] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:53:46] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:53:48] now when he ties that into Mark 11 amen
[1:53:51] uh this is where in verse 23 Mark 11
[1:53:54] says for verily I say unto you that
[1:53:56] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:53:58] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:54:00] the sea and shall not down his heart but
[1:54:02] shall believe that those things which he
[1:54:04] said should come to pass he shall have
[1:54:06] whatsoever he's saith therefore I say
[1:54:10] unto you what things so ever you desire
[1:54:11] when ye pray believe that you received
[1:54:15] them and ye shall have them now I want
[1:54:18] to just kind of go back to that there's
[1:54:19] a little statement that uh brother
[1:54:22] Branham made regarding that scripture in
[1:54:24] Mark 11 out of the sermon show us the
[1:54:26] father now the the scripture told us
[1:54:28] when you stand praying uh well so it
[1:54:31] says there what what things you desire
[1:54:33] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:54:36] them them and you should have them now
[1:54:39] it didn't say that as soon as you finish
[1:54:40] praying that you was gonna get it no but
[1:54:43] while you're praying you got to believe
[1:54:44] that you receive it I'm gonna tell you
[1:54:46] that that'll cause your prayer to change
[1:54:48] to Thanksgiving
[1:54:52] if you really believe you received it
[1:54:55] while you were praying your prayer would
[1:54:57] begin to shift
[1:54:59] to Thanksgiving
[1:55:01] and you'll start thinking God for it
[1:55:03] before you even see it
[1:55:05] amen and your thanks is what will bring
[1:55:07] it into manifestation
[1:55:11] amen all right look at it now show us
[1:55:13] the father look at what the prophet says
[1:55:15] it says Jesus
[1:55:17] had all the fine qualities of God in him
[1:55:20] do you believe it he said he had powers
[1:55:23] upon Powers but when he met Satan he
[1:55:26] never used his power he'd give an
[1:55:28] example for the weakest of Christian
[1:55:31] all right when he met Satan he said it
[1:55:34] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:55:36] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:55:38] out of the mouth of God the weakest
[1:55:40] Christian Christian can take that stand
[1:55:43] hold it sure God's in his word look
[1:55:47] every time when he met the enemy when he
[1:55:50] when he meet the enemy he said it is
[1:55:51] written I believe he had power to do it
[1:55:53] but he met Satan on the same grounds
[1:55:55] with the same word that you can meet him
[1:55:57] with everyone is written look at this
[1:56:00] you believe it why it's written
[1:56:02] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:56:05] pray believe you receive them he says
[1:56:07] now watch the order of the word
[1:56:10] believe
[1:56:12] now
[1:56:13] present tense believe now
[1:56:17] you receive it
[1:56:18] glory to God and you shall have it
[1:56:21] believe now you receive it and you shall
[1:56:25] have it believe now that you receive it
[1:56:28] and you shall have it I believe now
[1:56:31] we're going to have a church in a school
[1:56:33] and we shall have it I believe now that
[1:56:36] my family is coming in and I shall have
[1:56:39] it I believe now praise God I believe

[2:01:04] some of the famous words can you imagine
[2:01:06] a man being there maybe at a at a prayer
[2:01:09] line
[2:01:10] and I want to tell you something about
[2:01:11] prayer oh my I got in my notes Here
[2:01:14] might as well say it now prayer is what
[2:01:17] pulled the angel of the Lord
[2:01:19] from the platform to the person out in
[2:01:21] the audience with no prayer card
[2:01:25] the power of God is here and and brother
[2:01:28] brand I'm Discerning this and praying
[2:01:30] for this and praying for that but
[2:01:31] somebody's sitting over there
[2:01:33] glory to God just begin to pray God
[2:01:37] speak to me God I ain't got a prayer
[2:01:40] card I couldn't get here early enough to
[2:01:42] get no prayer cards I tried but my
[2:01:44] condition's just a little bit too
[2:01:46] challenging but I'm here in the meeting
[2:01:48] God would you please speak to me
[2:01:51] Hallelujah next thing you know the
[2:01:53] prophet said hey hold on wait a minute
[2:01:55] sister over there glory to God in the
[2:01:58] red coats and I put that one there
[2:02:00] specifically I know if somebody's gonna
[2:02:02] be here today with a red coat because if
[2:02:04] you had a red coat I would have claimed
[2:02:05] this one for me
[2:02:07] glory to God Amen your prayer is
[2:02:11] answered lady sitting there with the red
[2:02:14] coat that's got that high blood pressure
[2:02:16] amen God bless you God be with you you

[2:02:25] I'm telling you what if I would have
[2:02:27] been the sister there with a red coat I
[2:02:28] would have left their heel
[2:02:31] and I would have known even without him
[2:02:33] touching me glory to God that my prayer
[2:02:36] chains things
[2:02:37] amen
[2:02:39] the prophet says this prayer is not a
[2:02:41] perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer
[2:02:45] is talking to God prayers not get down
[2:02:46] shut your eyes and thinking about your
[2:02:48] washing or your word you're doing say
[2:02:50] Lord help me and John and heal Miss
[2:02:52] Jones and so forth that's not prayer
[2:02:54] that's a that's repeating some words but
[2:02:56] prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[2:02:58] where you realize that you're in the
[2:02:59] presence of God and you're moving to a
[2:03:02] movement to then in the deepest of
[2:03:03] sincerity
[2:03:07] let's look at this next one it says this
[2:03:10] oh my thank God for this
[2:03:13] you see when you go to praying for
[2:03:15] somebody for somebody something's going
[2:03:17] to take place
[2:03:19] something something goes to taking place
[2:03:21] there is where we fail friends not
[2:03:24] praying
[2:03:26] prayer is the keynote ask and you shall
[2:03:29] receive you have not because you ask not
[2:03:34] amen you asked not because you believe
[2:03:37] not ask abundance that your Joys may be
[2:03:42] full ask and believe that you receive
[2:03:45] what you've asked for then hold on to it
[2:03:49] don't leave it that's effectual fervent
[2:03:52] prayer don't leave it it's a promise in
[2:03:55] the Bible and it's been revealed to you
[2:03:57] that God is going to give it to you hold
[2:03:59] to it
[2:04:01] hey ain't gonna let no devil take no
[2:04:03] promise from me
[2:04:05] I got another one here
[2:04:07] When you pray
[2:04:09] and your prayer is not answered
[2:04:14] it's a good question
[2:04:17] do you still love him
[2:04:21] oh
[2:04:22] see that's when we have relationship
[2:04:25] God I love you anyway
[2:04:27] uh you got to be like them Hebrew boys

[2:04:39] here this my is this a testimony service
[2:04:41] I just want to tell you something say
[2:04:43] now we know that our God is able to
[2:04:47] deliver us we ain't got no doubt about
[2:04:48] that but if we choose not to we just
[2:04:52] want you to know we will not bow

[2:05:01] strongest man who gonna talk to me like
[2:05:04] that Believers can talk like that
[2:05:06] because they know they're God

[2:05:14] showed you how what was happening on the
[2:05:16] Earth but also what was happening in
[2:05:17] heaven amen and there was a conference
[2:05:20] happen in heaven Michael come up and say

[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:08] hey do you still love them
[2:06:11] yes Lord we love you here's another oh
[2:06:13] if you only knew that in your hand
[2:06:15] Christ gave us the authority with his
[2:06:18] name by being Christians the most
[2:06:21] powerful weapon the world has ever known
[2:06:23] prayer it it even changes everything
[2:06:28] here's another one the factual fervent
[2:06:31] prayer of a righteous man
[2:06:33] and I know that a righteous man is not
[2:06:35] righteous in himself
[2:06:37] but entrusting in the grace
[2:06:40] of Jesus Christ so even when the devil
[2:06:42] come to church like you know you just
[2:06:43] did this you can't pray you know you
[2:06:46] just did that you can't pray just make
[2:06:48] that thing right like brother Branham
[2:06:49] did when he couldn't pray for the little
[2:06:50] baby
[2:06:51] he couldn't he could die he said he said
[2:06:53] now you just lie to that man and told
[2:06:55] him that you wasn't in the house you
[2:06:56] can't pray you got to go get that right

[2:08:03] there is power When We Stand Together
[2:08:06] praying
[2:08:08] that's right
[2:08:13] you know me and my wife got to praying
[2:08:16] for a little situation and and and and
[2:08:18] I'm you know we just just looked at
[2:08:20] something we grab hands let's pray about
[2:08:21] it right now let's pray about this just
[2:08:24] begin to pray and I'm expecting God to
[2:08:26] answer my prayer there are some things I
[2:08:28] put in my prayer journal and I I still
[2:08:30] got them written down in it I'm
[2:08:32] expecting God to do it
[2:08:34] and as more come I'm adding more to it
[2:08:37] but I'm expecting God to do it
[2:08:40] Hallelujah here's a a thing okay I think
[2:08:44] uh yeah one more on that one how do we
[2:08:47] pray
[2:08:50] I missed that prayer is the key that's
[2:08:52] the answer now the next one how do we
[2:08:53] pray we pray in Jesus name don't we
[2:08:57] every prayer is in his name or there
[2:08:59] isn't any answer I need to put that in
[2:09:01] and just make a little Clarity but don't
[2:09:04] be cute
[2:09:07] with your prayers
[2:09:11] we pray in the name of your son
[2:09:15] we pray we pray uh
[2:09:19] in in in in in in in our great in our
[2:09:22] Holy Redeemer blessed savior we play in
[2:09:26] his name we pray in his name
[2:09:29] let me give you another one we pray in
[2:09:31] the name of the father
[2:09:33] the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:09:35] that ain't the prayer that's being heard
[2:09:37] Jesus said
[2:09:40] ask the father
[2:09:41] in
[2:09:43] my name
[2:09:47] that's right
[2:09:49] yeah ask the father anything in my name
[2:09:52] you better know his name
[2:09:56] and when you when you go to pray you
[2:09:58] better use his name
[2:09:59] because there is power
[2:10:02] in the name of Jesus
[2:10:04] demons have to back up at that name
[2:10:07] that's why we come in the name of Jesus
[2:10:09] and we always seal the prayer in the
[2:10:12] name of Jesus why you think they they
[2:10:15] blocking that name today they don't want
[2:10:16] you to pray in the name of Jesus just
[2:10:18] don't you you can say this you can say
[2:10:20] listen to any political prayer most of
[2:10:23] them are not using Jesus name
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:26] why are they blocking there's power so
[2:10:29] the devil don't mind you just going
[2:10:30] through the motion
[2:10:31] just don't use that name
[2:10:34] but me I'm coming and I'ma open my
[2:10:36] prayer in the name of Jesus and I'ma
[2:10:39] close my prayer in the name of Jesus and
[2:10:41] while I'm in the middle of my prayer
[2:10:42] I'll be rebuking devils in the name of
[2:10:45] Jesus
[2:10:48] I do everything in the name of Jesus
[2:10:55] how do we pray we pray in Jesus name
[2:10:58] don't we every prayer is in his name are
[2:11:00] there isn't
[2:11:02] any answer all right let me go back here
[2:11:05] let me go back
[2:11:07] all right
[2:11:08] I'm winding up I just thank God
[2:11:11] effectual fervent prayer
[2:11:13] oh yes all right here
[2:11:17] um
[2:11:18] this uh this scripture
[2:11:23] Second Kings 20.
[2:11:26] let's just read this
[2:11:27] we talked about a little earlier but
[2:11:29] let's read this from the script to
[2:11:30] Second Kings 20.
[2:11:36] that must start at verse one
[2:11:41] prayer can change anything
[2:11:53] in those days
[2:11:56] was Hezekiah sick unto death
[2:12:01] and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos
[2:12:04] came to him and said said unto him thus
[2:12:07] saith the Lord
[2:12:09] sat down house in order
[2:12:12] for Thou shalt die
[2:12:16] my God
[2:12:18] and not live
[2:12:20] then he turned his face to the wall and
[2:12:22] prayed unto the Lord saying and let me
[2:12:24] let me just just just drop something
[2:12:26] here really quick
[2:12:28] um notice a prophet going to tell this
[2:12:30] man he gonna die and not live
[2:12:33] now we have many people that prophesy
[2:12:35] today but they never tell you things
[2:12:37] like this
[2:12:39] every prophecy you hear is you're going
[2:12:41] to get a blessing
[2:12:42] God gonna do this for you and God you
[2:12:45] don't hear nobody saying hey you God
[2:12:47] just showed me you're gonna die
[2:12:49] they start rebuking the person right
[2:12:51] they don't want to hear nothing like
[2:12:52] that but here a prophet has to tell you
[2:12:54] both bad and good
[2:12:56] sometimes if you hear the bad it might
[2:12:58] cause you to pray
[2:13:01] look at what happened to Hezekiah he
[2:13:02] just heard from a prophet thus said Lord
[2:13:04] you set your house in order you are
[2:13:06] going to die and not live this sickness
[2:13:09] you got gonna take you out of here look
[2:13:10] at this then he turned his face to the
[2:13:13] wall
[2:13:14] and prayed unto the Lord
[2:13:17] saying I beseech thee O Lord
[2:13:21] remember now how I have walked before
[2:13:24] thee in truth amen and with a perfect
[2:13:28] heart this man ain't telling God what he
[2:13:31] gonna do this man is telling God what he
[2:13:33] already done
[2:13:35] amen I beseech the O Lord remember now
[2:13:39] how I have walked before thee in truth
[2:13:41] and with a perfect heart and I've done
[2:13:43] that which is good in our sight and
[2:13:44] Hezekiah wept saw
[2:13:47] man begin to cry amen before the Lord
[2:13:51] oh hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you
[2:13:54] might need a good cry before the Lord
[2:13:57] amen there's something about when you
[2:14:00] just have tears in God's presence oh
[2:14:02] hallelujah hallelujah he says it came to
[2:14:05] pass a for Isaiah Isaiah was going out
[2:14:09] into the middle court that the word of
[2:14:11] the Lord came to him saying turn again
[2:14:15] and tell Hezekiah the captain of my
[2:14:17] people thus saith the Lord see I now see
[2:14:20] look he got these two these famous words
[2:14:23] these famous words that most people love
[2:14:26] to hear everybody like to hear thus
[2:14:28] saying the Lord when you hear thus says
[2:14:30] Lord that means whatever you're asking
[2:14:31] for it's gonna happen
[2:14:33] if the doctor says not gonna happen you
[2:14:36] don't even care about the doctor you
[2:14:37] didn't care about what nobody said I
[2:14:39] just got thus saith the Lord
[2:14:42] this man didn't just get just the said
[2:14:45] the Lord he got two of the of the
[2:14:47] greatest phrases that a Christian can
[2:14:49] hear
[2:14:50] he got two of them in one situation
[2:14:55] I feel like shock
[2:14:57] he got two of it in one situation he got
[2:14:59] a thus saith the Lord look at this now
[2:15:01] amen verse five turn again tell Hezekiah
[2:15:04] the captain of my people thus say the
[2:15:06] Lord the god of David thy father I have
[2:15:09] heard thy prayer
[2:15:12] when you get one of them I heard your
[2:15:14] prayer you can just stop praying for it
[2:15:16] it is finished
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:19] I heard that prayer I have seen thy
[2:15:21] tears behold I will heal thee on the
[2:15:24] third day Thou shalt go up into the
[2:15:25] house of the Lord and I will add them to
[2:15:28] thy days 15 years and I will deliver
[2:15:29] thee in this city out of the hand of the
[2:15:31] king of Assyria and I will defend this
[2:15:33] city for my own sake and for my servant
[2:15:35] David say look he got blessing after
[2:15:37] blessing after blessing because he
[2:15:40] turned in prayer one time
[2:15:43] I'ma hear your body
[2:15:45] imma defend the city
[2:15:48] I'ma save your children
[2:15:50] imma do this I'm gonna do just from one
[2:15:53] prayer and see why the devil try to
[2:15:55] fight you from your prayers
[2:15:56] he realized the power that is released
[2:16:00] when you begin to pray
[2:16:07] I want to read this
[2:16:09] quotas rather lengthy maybe we'll bring
[2:16:11] it home in here
[2:16:12] tell you when people hear I've heard
[2:16:15] your prayer
[2:16:17] that that just changes everything prayer
[2:16:20] prayer I told you early prayers what
[2:16:22] pulled the prophet from the prayer line
[2:16:24] that he was conducting over to the
[2:16:26] audience prayer amen can cause God to
[2:16:29] speak directly to your situation
[2:16:32] some of the most encouraging words
[2:16:33] you'll ever hear after you prayed is God
[2:16:36] heard your prayers
[2:16:41] that lets you know that God is active
[2:16:43] God is hearing and and if God is hearing
[2:16:47] it and he's responding to it there's
[2:16:49] nothing that the devil can do to stop
[2:16:50] you from receiving
[2:16:52] what you ask for
[2:16:55] I'm telling you right now in this moment
