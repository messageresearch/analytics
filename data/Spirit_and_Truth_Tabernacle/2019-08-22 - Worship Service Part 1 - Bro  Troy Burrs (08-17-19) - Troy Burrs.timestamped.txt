[4:21] we going to love them in a dorm at the

[4:28] we'll get right into the message a man
[4:32] just grab your Bibles have a word of
[4:37] Prayer a man such a timely timeless song
[4:45] yeah Here I am to worship a man
[4:49] let us pray most gracious Heavenly
[4:52] Father we come to a God it's even in Oh
[4:56] father God before you Lord and just ask
[4:59] Lord God that you have your way o
[5:02] father's Lord speak to the hearts of
[5:05] those that might be that are listening
[5:07] those that are gathered here in this
[5:09] place Lord those that are listening over
[5:12] these streaming services or father God
[5:14] we ask you Lord God to just use my voice
[5:18] Oh Lord God and his thought Lord God did
[5:20] touch somebody's heart Lord God that
[5:23] they don't hear my voice but they're
[5:25] here the Masters called receiving Oh
[5:27] father Lord God that somebody your
[5:30] father God may recognize the law of God
[5:33] that their child of the king or father
[5:35] God and Lord God and answer that call Oh
[5:38] father God may it burned deep into their
[5:40] hearts Oh father God Lord God that they
[5:43] asked as they did that I ask men and
[5:46] brethren what must we do to be
[5:47] say the Lord God we asked you to just
[5:50] have your way behind me behind the cross
[5:52] Lord God said that she only you be seen
[5:54] Lord and Jesus precious name we pray
[5:57] amen
[5:58] I mean if you grab your Bibles will
[6:00] start at Matthew the fourth chapter and
[6:04] the eighth verse try not to a man get
[6:12] carried away just what would like a look
[6:13] whether Branham would say sometimes the
[6:16] Sunday School lesson amen
[6:21] Ben had this for quite some time
[6:25] the Lord gave me this and I think it's
[6:29] just very timely we'll read from
[6:33] Matthew's fourth chapter the eighth and
[6:35] again the devil had taken him up into an
[6:39] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[6:42] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[6:46] glory of them and he saith unto him all
[6:50] these things will I give thee if thou
[6:54] will fall down and worship me now we see
[6:59] here that this is the devil tempting our
[7:03] Savior Jesus Christ and he's asking from
[7:07] Jesus to worship him so we see here that
[7:12] the devil desires worship a man and the
[7:17] Lord said then said Jesus unto him get
[7:21] the hint Satan for it is written thou
[7:24] shalt worship the Lord thy God and him
[7:28] alone what I certa a man you may be
[7:32] seated
[7:32] a man in this little thought I would
[7:36] title a man worship service and when
[7:42] we're gonna just kind of take our time
[7:44] and just kind of look into this because
[7:47] we find you know especially I'm only
[7:52] mistake specially in this hour all
[7:56] through the Bible all through the Bible
[7:58] men
[8:01] have worshipped and have worshiped in
[8:05] era so many people believe well as long
[8:11] as I go to church and longest high I do
[8:15] to do this and I go on our worship but
[8:17] what are you worshipping you know Satan
[8:20] to take worship any way he can get it
[8:23] whether it's by deception or whether
[8:26] it's intentional Satan have received I
[8:29] worship but see Christ God is only going
[8:32] to receive worship in truth outside of
[8:37] the revelation for that dispensation of
[8:41] time that you're living in amen there's
[8:45] only one proof had a place for worship a
[8:48] man in 1965 a prophet preached he
[8:53] preached a message God's only provide a
[8:56] place of worship God's only chosen place
[9:00] of worship and he preached trying to do
[9:05] God a service without it being his will
[9:07] all in the last year of his life now I
[9:11] believe he was trying to drive a home a
[9:13] certain point amen
[9:15] that in order for us to have true
[9:18] worship it has to be grounded and rooted
[9:22] in revelation of the truth amen and we
[9:27] understand a lot of times here people
[9:30] confuse worship and praise amen Psalms
[9:36] 58 man says we praise them on the high
[9:39] symbol and praise them on the love
[9:41] symbol let everything that hath breath
[9:44] praise the Lord praise is wonderful and
[9:48] most definitely worship is a part of
[9:51] praise but praise and worship are two
[9:57] different things I worship God and how I
[10:00] treat my life I worship God and how I
[10:05] carry myself on the job I worship God
[10:09] and how I treat my neighbor
[10:12] I worship God in my daily woke it's more
[10:18] than just coming to church and lifting
[10:21] up our voices and things like that that
[10:24] is definitely a part of worship and it
[10:26] are more susceptible to the word of
[10:28] praise and we're giving them adoration
[10:30] and things like that you know but
[10:32] worship goes so much further beyond it
[10:36] is a lifestyle it is a commitment it is
[10:40] a dying out to oneself and taking on the
[10:46] wheel of our Lord and Savior
[10:49] will look into the Scriptures hear a man
[10:55] and and see some things we go back here
[11:00] Genesis 4 we'll take a look and we'll
[11:04] see where there was two brothers came
[11:07] enable both worshiped both built an
[11:15] altar and the Prophet said that if it's
[11:21] just going to church and and and
[11:24] praising the Lord and and all of these
[11:27] sort of things was enough then King was
[11:30] justified a man a man Cain had every had
[11:37] every he was he was right there and he
[11:39] was doing all of the things but the Lord
[11:43] did not accept his worship and and and
[11:48] and and i guess it would seem but well
[11:50] you know except able but see Abel had a
[11:54] revelation amen and and and at that time
[11:58] there was no Bible to read Amen I can
[12:02] assume that they were only talk from
[12:04] their parents you know and probably told
[12:08] the backstory on what happened
[12:10] Amen enable here in the story amen
[12:15] being this like his father was able to
[12:19] hear the Bible say in Revelations behind
[12:23] everything you say he that
[12:24] laughing ear let him hear what the
[12:27] Spirit is saying and we tell yourself
[12:29] and just be caught these two things on
[12:31] the side of your head everybody can't
[12:33] hear a man we should be grateful a man
[12:36] that we have something on the inside
[12:39] that was able to resonate a man with the
[12:43] Word of God that we were able to
[12:45] actually hear the hear the call was in
[12:48] the word see there's a there's a my God
[12:51] thank you Jesus see a desert there's a
[12:55] the our voice a sound that kid as a
[12:59] carrier Amen our voice is the carrier
[13:03] frequency and we and we project our
[13:06] voice and we these words are just words
[13:09] amen but see it's the revelation in the
[13:13] Holy Spirit that give these words life
[13:16] communication is is two parts it is a
[13:20] delivery of those words and it's a
[13:23] reception of the words if we're having a
[13:26] conversation I'm delivering a salt amen
[13:29] and that thought goat would go to my
[13:31] brain and I would use my faculties of my
[13:35] voice chords in my and my lips and all
[13:37] of these things to project that word so
[13:41] that thoughts so the words it's just a
[13:42] carrier of my thoughts now you have to
[13:46] be able to receive that so your ears
[13:50] come into play you hear it and then you
[13:53] feel to what I'm saying through your
[13:55] mind amen and in your filtering you feel
[14:00] to the good part should fall in your
[14:03] heart and that is what you hear I was
[14:07] recently talking to to a fellow and we
[14:13] was during the breakfast breakfast spot
[14:16] waiting on our grits and eggs and stuff
[14:17] and I didn't know he was a minister and
[14:22] somebody hadn't in the little place I
[14:24] can say ribs say to grace oh he blessed
[14:27] the food and I said what you a minister
[14:28] so we started a little conversation and
[14:30] he made a point he say we got the time
[14:32] of chopping it up a little bit and he
[14:34] said well how he
[14:37] was a part of the one of the big
[14:39] denominational groups here and how
[14:42] something must have happened and they
[14:44] kicked him out or he left for something
[14:46] he had some kind of shake up and I was
[14:48] just recently talking about why she got
[14:50] so many denominational churches and
[14:51] different things around here just
[14:53] because somebody got upset and split and
[14:55] started a on and and it just and it just
[14:58] keep going and keep going like somebody
[14:59] wants belief from not going to start
[15:00] they all and it just did just keep
[15:02] multiplying and multiplying but I see I
[15:05] was talking to him and he made a comment
[15:08] he said well you know what religion is
[15:09] and I say okay well he would tell him
[15:13] about his seminary education you went to
[15:15] college for so many years and got
[15:17] educated they did end up study on the
[15:19] word religion
[15:20] I said well religion is a covering he
[15:22] said well that's pretty good young fella
[15:24] he say but religion means back to
[15:27] bondage I said man I like that
[15:29] back to bondage he said that's what it
[15:32] is religion when you get religious you
[15:34] you you got to live just just religious
[15:37] you're going back to budget that's what
[15:39] the children of ejek wanted to do
[15:41] regarding to the wilderness there and
[15:43] they got you know some was really saving
[15:45] souls were just religious the minute
[15:47] things got tough they wanted to run back
[15:49] to Goshen and I said man you bring up a
[15:52] valid point there I like that I like
[15:54] that back to bondage just being
[15:56] religious is not gonna be enough and see
[15:59] that's what it is everybody you have a
[16:01] lot of people religious and they saying
[16:03] things like I hear things like uh well
[16:06] we'll understand that all once well you
[16:09] won't get there because he that worship
[16:13] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[16:15] truth you how you gonna get it let's
[16:18] look at this let's look at this amen
[16:22] Deuteronomy leave it's the fourth
[16:25] Deuteronomy fourth chapter don't be
[16:31] afraid to turn with me in your Bibles if
[16:33] you just put it up Deuteronomy fourth
[16:37] chapter the 14 verse
[16:42] a man Deuteronomy the fourth chapter in
[16:47] the fourteenth verse said in the law
[16:49] commanded me at the time to teach you
[16:53] statutes and judgments and you might do
[16:57] them in the land whither ye go over to
[17:01] possess it Tinky therefore good heed
[17:06] unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of
[17:11] similitude on the day that the Lord
[17:15] spake unto you in Herald out of the
[17:18] midst of the fire Leisha corrupt
[17:20] yourselves and make you a graven image
[17:25] the similitude of any figure likeness of
[17:30] male or female the likeness of any
[17:33] beasts that is on the earth the likeness
[17:36] of any winged fowl that flies in the air
[17:40] the likeness of anything that creepeth
[17:43] on the ground the likeness of any fish
[17:45] in the water
[17:46] beneath the earth let's now lift up
[17:50] thine eyes unto heaven thou when thou
[17:53] sees the Sun and the moon and the stars
[17:55] even though the hosts of heaven should
[17:58] be driven to worship them and serve
[18:01] which the Lord that God had divided unto
[18:04] the nations under the whole heaven amen
[18:07] so he's warning them to be careful amen
[18:12] to not put any other gods before him be
[18:15] careful of what you worship and we find
[18:19] that so synonymous in this hour in the
[18:23] message show us the father a man the
[18:27] Prophet was talking about how there's
[18:30] many people that do all kinds of worship
[18:33] they worship all kind of thing and some
[18:35] of the Indians and different things they
[18:37] they worship the Sun and and and they
[18:42] they believe that when they died I go
[18:44] over to this wonderful hunting ground
[18:47] amen and there's different ones who
[18:49] worship worship different animals and
[18:52] different things of that nature but we
[18:54] see
[18:56] that even in this hour man we would
[19:00] design we were made to worship in us we
[19:04] can't help it in us in it we were
[19:07] designed to worship something so whether
[19:11] we we know the truth whether we
[19:14] understand it or not whether we believe
[19:17] anything or not to come to check we will
[19:19] worship something we will either worship
[19:22] we will worship like he said here under
[19:25] a woman or will worship a man we worship
[19:29] athletic figures we worship athletic
[19:32] teams you worship things cars boats
[19:34] things like that make sure where we
[19:36] spend our time and our money in order to
[19:39] be a member of a certain church to
[19:41] properly say this how'd you become a
[19:43] member because you spend your time and
[19:46] your money and your presence we don't
[19:51] have no role for you to sign and wean
[19:53] doing the right hand fellowship you want
[19:55] to come come it's where you spend your
[19:59] time your money and your where you where
[20:03] you devote yourself to a man and some
[20:06] people devote myself to the bar
[20:08] afterwards every day so whatever it is
[20:11] that they go into that bar to get every
[20:13] day that's what they worship her because
[20:17] they spend they time and they money and
[20:20] that's her and it's a constant regular
[20:23] worship some religiously doing football
[20:28] season or a basketball season
[20:31] they got season tickets and they work
[20:33] and they go get their money and then
[20:34] they paid a season ticket be like tithe
[20:39] you worship that sports team and you go
[20:44] there you get there and they jump around
[20:46] and they praised and they have all kind
[20:47] of good time and a half church and they
[20:51] go whoo I feel better and they say oh I
[20:53] can't wait to the next game they men go
[20:57] wake up in the morning they look through
[20:58] the papers and they read the stacks a
[21:00] to know everything they reading a
[21:01] Bible they go back to work and then they
[21:05] talk to me buck man did you see the game
[21:07] let me tell you something
[21:08] happen and that happens but this person
[21:10] they can tell you some stuff like new
[21:11] people a witness they witnessing see so
[21:19] we come to church and we have a real
[21:20] good time we pray them everything if we
[21:22] go home and when we have a wonderful
[21:24] time we go back and we tell him about it
[21:26] oh do we go to work and we get around
[21:32] the water cooler let me tell you what
[21:33] happened in church oh but we worship
[21:41] worship is everyday worship is how you
[21:49] spend your time worship is the
[21:52] excitement that you put forth about what
[21:56] God has done for you we worship Him not
[22:01] just in these four walls we worship Him
[22:05] on the outside of these four walls
[22:06] that's what a true worship comes in and
[22:10] here we raise our voices in praise thank
[22:13] you for the goodness Lord thank you for
[22:16] the blessings O Lord God give me more
[22:19] Lord keep it more Lord it's so good
[22:21] thank you
[22:22] but when we leave him I'll give you a
[22:26] good example
[22:26] I don't want to get ahead of myself
[22:29] there was a woman who are parents may of
[22:38] toho had a good Bible stay good
[22:41] upbringing but she kind of you know hi
[22:44] y'all folks get some time they feel like
[22:48] they know more than everybody got off in
[22:51] there some things he probably should the
[22:52] got into and wound up in a position and
[22:58] she real how did I get out here
[23:00] how did I get in I selling a body and
[23:03] different things like that so she went
[23:06] one day to draw some water from the
[23:08] wheel and on the other side jesus said I
[23:13] have need to go to Samaria so as he came
[23:18] up he asked the lady that well draw me
[23:21] some water
[23:21] see she
[23:22] well versed in the scripture cuz she
[23:24] said it ain't proper for you to be
[23:26] talking to me me being a Samaritan you
[23:30] being a Jew he said if you knew who I
[23:34] was you would ask me for a drink of
[23:37] water
[23:38] piqued the curiosity so what was
[23:42] happening she before this encounter she
[23:48] worshiped something but she was
[23:53] worshipping in error uh she she
[23:59] worshiped she spent her time and I
[24:02] mother she was religious she was in
[24:06] bondage so as Jesus kept talking to and
[24:12] he said well I tell you whatever you
[24:14] know and I can't go get your husband and
[24:17] we know the story he said I have no
[24:20] husband said dollar said well you have
[24:22] father the one you wit not your own so
[24:25] what was he doing he was unfolding
[24:28] himself all of a sudden this young woman
[24:32] caught the revelation lord have mercy
[24:38] we remember talking about this in Bible
[24:40] study that wait a minute man that come
[24:44] and discern my heart and things that he
[24:47] you don't know me and you how did you
[24:49] know these things I perceive you to be
[24:53] the Messiah not see not too long before
[24:56] that he did the same thing they put a
[24:59] rag over his head and say hit a hit and
[25:01] tell tell us who hit you see she had
[25:05] even though it was covered up there was
[25:10] something on the inside and jesus knew
[25:13] that that something was dead and all he
[25:16] had to do was unfolding says now when
[25:18] she saw it what the first thing she did
[25:21] she got excited by the revelation
[25:25] she got stimulated about a revelation
[25:29] she had a bucket of water that she
[25:33] the Prophet said she dropped her creeds
[25:37] and denominational ideas and she ran
[25:42] through the city telling everybody come
[25:45] see a man come see a man she wasn't
[25:49] preaching he said he was testified she
[25:52] was testifying come see a man that told
[25:55] me the things that I have done and she
[26:00] went through the city and telling all of
[26:02] these people listen to people say well
[26:03] wait a minute I know that girl woman
[26:06] miss you I know they said it but they
[26:08] came and because of her testimony many
[26:13] more came to listen to what he had to
[26:17] say and were saying because she ran off
[26:23] she got stimulated spirit about a
[26:29] revelation truth she went off worshiping
[26:33] in spirit and in truth and minimo Cain
[26:39] so worship it's not it's more than Jess
[26:44] what we do here in these four walls it's
[26:48] what we do when we take it outside of
[26:50] these four walls how we handle ourselves
[26:52] and how we carry I said the excitement
[26:55] and the exuberance that we show about
[26:56] what we have we have something great we
[27:02] have the words of eternal life amen
[27:06] so we see Cain and Abel they did the
[27:10] same thing he told Cain if you worship
[27:13] like your brother I'll accept your side
[27:15] I accept yours too but see Abel had a
[27:18] revelation that he uh uh he say much
[27:22] like a you know they he got his garden
[27:25] all prettied up pineapples and bananas
[27:28] and all of the different pretty colors
[27:30] and he had labored in the fear probably
[27:34] labored a long time sweating he was
[27:37] doing nothing he was over there
[27:39] shepherding his sheep probably laid on
[27:42] up under the tree
[27:44] you know he makes sure he got them all
[27:46] one two three four five six yeah they
[27:48] all here you know watching that foot of
[27:50] wolves and different thing making sure
[27:52] they don't come get his sheep and and
[27:55] eats he went and he took his best his

[29:36] we see
[29:39] cincin and kami they multiplied the
[29:45] earth and different things and down
[29:47] through the lineage there or the
[29:49] president of King
[29:51] Dinah's can see there he had
[29:55] with him cush and Nimrod and and and and
[30:03] how they began to do some some things
[30:08] there see remember the serpent tricked
[30:14] or deceived Eve and I don't want to get
[30:18] into you know the whole nother message
[30:20] with this whole campaign but we know
[30:23] what happened there but and it went on
[30:27] down but the cccc when people pass on
[30:30] the spirit don't pass on so that same
[30:33] spirit was still in the land and and and
[30:37] and Satan still desire to be worshipped
[30:41] like the Most High Amen according to
[30:44] Isaiah 14 he said I will ascend up in
[30:47] the heights of the clouds to be
[30:49] worshipped like the Most High and Nimrod
[30:53] began to build this tower war battle
[30:56] amen and and and this is this Babylonian
[31:00] place said man this place he tried to a
[31:05] sidestep God he say uh you you flooded
[31:09] us out and killed a bunch of people this
[31:11] time we're gonna build the tower so high
[31:12] all we got to do was run to the top of
[31:15] the tower and we can avoid the flood
[31:18] when you do this again much like today
[31:22] they trying to take an astronaut and
[31:25] build a city of a skate place up in the
[31:29] fitness space they figured that that's
[31:33] going to be able to save them and once
[31:35] everything done there come back down to
[31:36] earth that's what they actually think
[31:39] that's this pastor who just to the space
[31:42] industry done they going up there and
[31:44] they freakin can man live in space they
[31:46] know this thing is gonna collapse I was
[31:49] there was a news report yesterday they
[31:52] say that this year was the hottest year
[31:54] on record hottest year on record it's
[31:59] coming close amen the the volcanoes of
[32:05] belching and
[32:08] it's just a time when when the the whole
[32:13] thing over there and Los Angeles
[32:15] slipping to the ocean a man and
[32:18] everybody gonna I'm gonna tell you
[32:19] what's gonna happen now thanks lip and
[32:21] ocean all make believers they waiting to
[32:25] see that gonna come back running you
[32:28] ain't gonna pay to find a seat in the
[32:29] church better get here early that day
[32:32] because they all go come on wait a
[32:35] minute maybe he is the Prophet brothers
[32:39] and sisters I don't know it might be too
[32:41] late then it might be too late then I
[32:44] don't know I'm just saying it might be
[32:46] too late then I wouldn't wait I wouldn't
[32:49] wait that long but it's important for us
[32:51] to understand who we worshipping in this
[32:54] out you know it's only one provided
[32:58] place of worship that's something to
[32:59] share blood of Jesus Christ but
[33:01] everybody's saying they worship the
[33:03] cross everybody is saying the same thing
[33:08] amen we're gonna get into some things
[33:11] and we're gonna by the help of the Lord
[33:13] really break those things down now here
[33:16] in impediment in this Babylonian concept
[33:20] it and everything they had
[33:22] Nimrod designed three things a man he
[33:29] decided he wanted to create a man a
[33:36] strong nation a man he wanted to start
[33:40] his own religion and he wanted to make a
[33:45] name for himself he wanted to make a
[33:50] name for himself and let me tell you
[33:54] that's when a lot of men make they
[33:56] downfall when they get to a point that
[33:59] pride get lifted up in their pride and
[34:02] and and they start wanting to make a
[34:04] name for themselves see this isn't about
[34:07] us this is about Christ I don't care
[34:11] about making a name for myself because
[34:13] the Bible tells me the way up is down
[34:17] if I could the more I can humble myself
[34:22] the more he's lifted up hey man the
[34:27] smaller I can get the bigger he can get
[34:32] so it's not you know in this aisle in
[34:35] the big eyes or little use and different
[34:37] things like that we have to understand
[34:40] the revelation that if we could there is
[34:43] a scripture that I believe it's in Luke
[34:45] I believe Luke 4 he says then why go
[34:48] into the synagogue and take the Chiefs
[34:50] seat looking for the Chiefs seat
[34:53] well I'm somebody I should sit here you
[34:55] ain't know what no well how about I give
[34:59] this part up to somebody who who who
[35:02] don't know the Lord just recently we was
[35:07] in a service and we can't sit this
[35:15] person
[35:16] oh they got pants on I said no we go oh
[35:25] you made me go argue about we go argue
[35:27] about but this is what I'm talking about
[35:32] you got okay yeah we understand that
[35:36] what you know is abomination for a woman
[35:37] to wear anything pertaining to a man
[35:39] well your spirit say you could get so
[35:44] convoluted in the law which is what the
[35:49] Pharisees and the Sadducees did they got
[35:52] so convoluted in the Lord a blitz who
[35:55] was standing right in front of them
[35:58] that's why it must be spirit and in
[36:01] truth they were quoting all of the
[36:04] scroll Jesus that Jesus and the
[36:07] Pharisees and the Sadducees read from
[36:10] the same Bible it was talking about our
[36:15] Father or the Moses and Abraham we just
[36:17] follow the law I am the law
[36:23] well you mean obviously you ain't
[36:25] following me cuz I'm here you got so
[36:29] convoluted in these kind of things you
[36:31] you missed the point and find yourself
[36:38] worshipping and no not what you worship
[36:41] Caesar to happen he's it a half a man
[36:47] one of these things you know Nimrod but
[36:51] in this Babylonian concept is where they
[36:54] started amen the religion of three gods
[36:58] and they started there this this
[37:02] religion of three gods and different
[37:05] things through the worship of the the
[37:11] mother of the child and the father and
[37:15] when he came out and he scattered them
[37:18] and confounded a language they took this
[37:22] doctrine throughout the world
[37:24] so I over in India they have a similar
[37:30] of religion what a worship is it's an
[37:35] image of a woman a man and a baby and
[37:39] the Buddhists have a three-headed Buddha
[37:42] with three years all of this come from
[37:46] that was propagated from there in
[37:49] Babylon and the Prophet there in
[37:52] Pergamos go back and read it if you like
[37:56] in the church ages and the Pergamon
[38:00] means the seat of Satan
[38:02] it's all right there where he said the
[38:06] most not as one is Father Son and Holy
[38:12] Ghost
[38:15] idol worship not realizing that that
[38:21] that he said you must worship the place
[38:25] that I chose to place my name in well we
[38:32] are we got these three guards his father
[38:36] and the son and it's and the Holy Ghost
[38:39] those are titles we're not the same time
[38:43] over in in in in in in Babylon we're
[38:47] dead
[38:48] just worshipping these idol worship
[38:50] three gods
[38:51] Abraham is over on the other side who
[38:55] see three people walking toward them and
[38:57] he said Lord one Lord one Lord so we
[39:04] still have a man here and in this time
[39:08] that same spirit people go on the church
[39:13] and worship it but no not but they
[39:17] worship no not what they're worshipping
[39:20] we must worship God in spirit and in
[39:25] truth it's not good enough to - to say
[39:29] well I'm just going to church king went
[39:32] to church Judas went to church they were
[39:38] all very religious but the worship was
[39:44] an error amen
[39:47] they worship was an error and I'm sure
[39:50] that many of us sitting here can
[39:52] understand these concepts but maybe I'm
[39:56] talking to someone over the street who
[39:59] don't understand and say well what's so
[40:00] different about this church and why they
[40:02] well it's because we have we're excited
[40:06] about what we're doing well what is it
[40:09] about these people that make them come
[40:11] to church all the time and what make
[40:13] them all so dedicated what make them
[40:16] what is it that's drawing them what is
[40:18] it that's making them so excited about
[40:21] what they're doing we are worshiping in
[40:23] spirit and in truth
[40:26] see we're like that woman
[40:28] the whale we like that woman like the
[40:30] well when that word came across and we
[40:33] heard we recognize that this is that
[40:37] this is God himself
[40:40] the Prophet said in the message it was
[40:44] that message trying to do God a service
[40:47] out of being his will
[40:48] plenty of time reading that he said
[40:50] Jesus is our prophet now I found myself
[40:55] talking to some people a while back and
[40:57] they that's it like they try to use that
[40:58] God at sundry times and doesn't spoke to
[41:00] the properties in times past saying may
[41:03] using that to say that God don't use
[41:05] process no mo well you go to Jesus
[41:09] Christ the same yesterday there forever
[41:11] and you said well what about that
[41:13] well it says did so now you had to stab
[41:17] me but the Prophet says okay he said
[41:21] himself he said Jesus is our prophet but
[41:26] every time brother Branham was in his
[41:29] fetches he said it's not me I'm just
[41:33] waiting on that angel it's not me who
[41:37] told you that your secrets
[41:39] it's that angel standing next to me it's
[41:44] not me so I tell you for he came down
[41:50] whispered into the ear of his prophet
[41:53] and said say this say this say this so
[42:01] yes Jesus was our prophet but he had to
[42:07] keep the scriptures Amos 3:7 surely the
[42:10] Lord thy God would do nothing less he
[42:12] revealed his secrets to the servants the
[42:14] Prophet first so they can't understand
[42:20] they can't see that it was God himself
[42:24] using the voice of William Brennan to
[42:28] call himself out of breath so that we
[42:33] can worship Him in spirit and in truth
[42:40] amen we see that that in Babylon it was
[42:48] the start of that polytheism form of
[42:52] worship and man and and and and and it
[42:58] was just seven things prophet that came
[43:01] and gave us the revelation they know
[43:06] slow at Jesus Christ come down through
[43:10] the time down through these seven Church
[43:12] ages it all got mixed up all got tangled
[43:16] up in each age that was a there was a
[43:19] small group that caught the revelation
[43:22] of their age but the first didn't know
[43:27] ii and ii didn't know the third amen but
[43:31] it came down to the intern that he would
[43:33] know all of it they bible say all the
[43:37] mysteries of be revealed amen
[43:42] a place that he chose to place his name
[43:45] that's where true worship must take
[43:49] place let us not take these things
[43:51] lightly my brothers and sisters amen a
[43:58] man reminded of the story the prophet
[44:04] was saying in the gods provide a place
[44:06] of worship that he said he one time he
[44:08] put it to the test and he was somewhere
[44:13] and i'm trying to quote it on top of my
[44:16] head but i'm sure many of you heard a
[44:19] story with the spiritualists and he was
[44:25] saying how if God is real he know the
[44:28] devil is real and they went to this
[44:31] service and they had this table
[44:32] levitating and the lady asked me say
[44:36] well you were preaching that this person
[44:39] was challenging people who can come
[44:40] fully God and he's man grabbed up and
[44:44] they couldn't pull this table down and
[44:48] she said well you see saying you think
[44:49] that's God he said that's the devil
[44:52] and they was challenging brother profit
[44:56] does you know do something you know and
[45:00] he was not the type to show off or
[45:03] nothing like that
[45:04] but he apparently saw a vision I can't
[45:08] recall it was a vision or he heard
[45:10] awards or something but he said in the
[45:14] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I
[45:16] command that table to come down he said
[45:19] it didn't budge and he in the name of
[45:23] something else I forget exactly but the
[45:25] last thing he said was the in the name
[45:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ I command that
[45:29] table to come down he said that Fang
[45:31] fell so hard about busted every leg or
[45:33] foot amen
[45:41] the one that bled and died for us under
[45:46] the shared blood of an innocent one his
[45:49] world we find worship and it's anonymous
[45:54] you know that many times people during
[45:58] the time of Jesus Jesus was right there
[46:00] and they couldn't see that who it was
[46:04] and it's the same thing today the
[46:09] prophecy Jesus is your prophet but
[46:13] because they couldn't visibly see him
[46:16] they feel like we talking about brother
[46:18] Branham he's just a voice
[46:25] I just gave these something the scenario
[46:27] of the voices just to care your
[46:30] frequency but you must receive the
[46:33] message on the inside there must be a
[46:35] filter that comes down to receive the
[46:40] message into your heart if there's
[46:45] something in your hearts and amen amen
[46:50] this is that that's the ear that he's
[46:55] talking about the ear is not on the side
[46:59] of your head the ear is in your heart if
[47:03] there's something about this this whole
[47:05] concept of worship and service that you
[47:10] can hear and and and and and you might
[47:14] say well I never heard anything about
[47:15] this the woman at the well she had never
[47:18] heard she had never seen a man like this
[47:19] before but she knew that there was
[47:23] something to it if something is said
[47:28] that stirs your heart that's not me my
[47:34] voice is just a carrying frequency it's
[47:38] the Lord Himself speaking to your heart
[47:41] I challenge you to stay my brothers and
[47:47] sisters to search out that place there
[47:51] are many places of the people worship I
