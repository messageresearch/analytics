[29:55] cancer is
[29:56] back uh I I know the God we serve is
[29:59] able and willing to do it
[30:03] again and uh says I'm requesting that
[30:05] the Believers stand with me in
[30:09] prayer for more faith healing and holy
[30:13] boldness to put this devil to a
[30:17] [Applause]
[30:20] [Music]
[30:26] flight say uh as I go meet with the
[30:30] oncology team on Monday please pray that
[30:33] God will go before
[30:35] me with me lead me and guide
[30:40] me and uh the name of this devil is beel
[30:45] lymphoma nun Hotchkins amen so this is

[32:00] Sister Tanya told Brother Troy I want to
[32:02] be prayed for today so she's calling for
[32:05] the Elders of the
[32:06] church and then the Bible tells us to

[57:54] and they've live it over the years God
[57:57] and I saw one sister in fact I took some
[57:59] the I on purpose took pictures with some
[58:01] of those elderly sisters 86 year old
[58:03] sister she had an open heart surgery
[58:06] when she was 80 plus years and she
[58:09] recovered quickly till the doctors were
[58:12] confounded and I could see some of them
[58:14] 86 they look like
[58:17] 65 and I saw that it's working for
[58:21] you so I remember I think I said
[58:23] something like that some some of us are
[58:25] me Laing but don't eat meat seven days a
[58:28] week reduces as much as possible this is
[58:31] not a Doctrine my disclosure is not a
[58:34] Doctrine it's just a health advice
[58:37] because the Lord want us to prop prosper
[58:39] in the spirit and also in the flesh as
[58:42] well because a lot of our meats are
[58:44] spread with everything you can think
[58:46] about radiations are in the meat that we
[58:49] eat now they want to inject a meat with
[58:51] a
[58:52] vaccination after covid so the meat and
[58:55] the chicken probably going to put covid
[58:57] vaccines in the meat so that the meat
[58:59] doesn't get the chicken doesn't get Co
[59:02] so you can imagine wow the little meat
[59:04] you want to put in your system Every
[59:06] chemical everything is pumped into this
[59:09] little flesh and then when you eat it
[59:12] the the the chemicals is in your body
[59:15] and with time it become casket of event
[59:18] sickness that we have so it it was
[59:21] something that I learned like I said
[59:23] it's not a Doctrine as a disclosure it's
[59:25] not a
[59:26] please I'm not saying don't eat meat eat
[59:28] meat as much as you want but if you can
[59:31] eliminate it as much as possible it will
[59:33] do your health good and let me use my
[59:36] own example I run I I'm kind of I call
[59:38] myself a crazy person I do crazy
[59:40] exercise I don't do in the daytime
[59:42] because if I do the day time where I
[59:44] live they going to call the cups on me I
[59:47] do it in the middle of the night I
[59:48] somersault I run I do kickboxing and
[59:50] different things all by myself so when I
[59:54] eat meat and I run run I feel like I
[59:57] need double twice the energy because I
[1:00:00] need to break down the meat first in the
[1:00:01] body to come back to myself and do my
[1:00:03] running and kickboxing and someting and
[1:00:05] those crazy stuff that I do but when I
[1:00:08] don't eat meat let's say fish it's much
[1:00:11] better and then when I don't eat any of
[1:00:13] them fish no meat and only plant food
[1:00:16] I'm like I fly like like I go like the
[1:00:18] wind just easy so I can tell you for
[1:00:20] myself that this meat if you can
[1:00:23] eliminate it as much as possible if you
[1:00:26] can do without it praise God hallelujah
[1:00:29] I was there for let's say eight span of
[1:00:30] 8 days I never miss meat or fish cuz
[1:00:33] they have vegan food which tastes like
[1:00:35] meat they have most of them are from H
[1:00:38] beans they use beans to make them they
[1:00:39] have chicken that tastes exactly like
[1:00:42] chicken they have even H what they call
[1:00:44] it they call it PRS and shrimps which
[1:00:47] taste like the same thing like the sea
[1:00:49] PRS but they meet them with with beans
[1:00:52] and it's more healthy options and
[1:00:54] Adventure because they meat that we have
[1:00:56] now is not maybe they made that 100
[1:00:58] years ago the one they grow at the
[1:01:00] backyard natural because these are not
[1:01:02] natural these are not organic the meat
[1:01:04] chicken which is will be ready by 45
[1:01:06] days could you imagine it's not natural
[1:01:09] for a chicken to be ready to eat in 45
[1:01:12] days so what do they do they put
[1:01:14] hormones they put antibiotics they put
[1:01:17] vaccines not vaccines yet vitamins for
[1:01:21] them to grow quickly and all those
[1:01:23] vitamins and the hormones stays in your
[1:01:25] body and in the course of time develop
[1:01:28] into sickness that sometime we do
[1:01:30] experience so that was one advice that I
[1:01:33] I'll give if you can as much as POS
[1:01:35] especially the chicken that we love the
[1:01:37] most even the restaurant chicken they
[1:01:40] put a lot of chemicals to taste sweet in
[1:01:41] your mouth but it's disease that we e we
[1:01:44] literally putting disease into our body
[1:01:47] they put so much quantity of salt into
[1:01:50] this food which the body doesn't need so
[1:01:52] your kidney is going to work overw right
[1:01:56] to get this salt out of the body and if
[1:01:58] you eat those uh KFC Wendy's you name it
[1:02:02] h Fried Chicken all the time every day
[1:02:05] of your life with chicken with with what
[1:02:07] do you call it salt and oil you are
[1:02:10] overworking your kidney and the because
[1:02:12] of now we do have our kidney failures
[1:02:13] and all those things but if you can
[1:02:15] drink more water take this things out of
[1:02:18] your body drink more water eat more
[1:02:19] vegetables exercise not everybody can
[1:02:21] run you can walk even if you can run
[1:02:23] from here to the back of the building
[1:02:25] keep the heart pumping keep the heart
[1:02:27] going it's a blessing to our health
[1:02:29] because the Lord want you to prosper so
[1:02:31] that he can use you for the ministry
[1:02:32] that is given to you amen so that is a
[1:02:36] little one of the things that I learned
[1:02:38] let's go to so the this trip came about
[1:02:40] the brothers invited me to go September
[1:02:43] I couldn't make it because I was going
[1:02:44] through a lot of transitions so there's
[1:02:46] a brother don't worry come March we're
[1:02:48] going to have a church anniversary so
[1:02:49] prep and come around that time so close
[1:02:52] to the time they asked me they told me
[1:02:54] that every year they pray for Israel at
[1:02:55] I think somewhere February so they were
[1:02:57] in prayer for I think so many days and
[1:02:59] after I said brother we are now going to
[1:03:01] go through three days of praying and
[1:03:02] fasting for your coming and when I went
[1:03:05] the brother told me even my 8-year-old
[1:03:07] daughter prayed the whole day and fasted
[1:03:09] without nobody instructing her and the P
[1:03:12] pastor's daughter was she's 14 she did
[1:03:15] three days fasting and prayer and said
[1:03:17] brother we in expectation so they gave
[1:03:18] me a topic to that is not being preached
[1:03:21] in Puerto Rico adoption and Redemption
[1:03:23] so said brother pray for that topic and
[1:03:25] then when you come tell us what you
[1:03:26] think so I prepare for the topic and I
[1:03:29] went the Lord put us all of us in the
[1:03:31] same frequency and the ministers will
[1:03:33] understand sometime you go for ministers
[1:03:34] meeting and nobody learns nothing
[1:03:37] because you go with what you know and
[1:03:38] you come back with what you know it's
[1:03:40] just about fighting and this one should
[1:03:42] that I know more than you ministers can
[1:03:45] understand but ja knows what I'm talking
[1:03:46] about so you go and come back empty you
[1:03:49] didn't learn nothing because it's about
[1:03:51] I know more than you this my quote this
[1:03:53] my scriptures this my understanding this
[1:03:55] my experience we bombard each other with
[1:03:57] coat and we don't learn nothing but this
[1:04:00] was on another level it's a different
[1:04:03] ball game all together we were in the
[1:04:04] same channel certain things that the
[1:04:06] Lord has revealed to me years when I was
[1:04:08] in Ghana they had the same understanding
[1:04:10] so we went through Friday in the morning
[1:04:14] everybody get 30 minutes or 40 minutes
[1:04:15] to preach and explain it was just easy
[1:04:18] just easy like that because Redemption I
[1:04:20] remember when I was in my laptop I right
[1:04:22] Redemption is a called to adoption
[1:04:24] because Redemption is let's say the
[1:04:26] mother and adoption is a fine tuning cuz
[1:04:29] adoption is positionally placing you who
[1:04:31] you are Redemption is go to what you
[1:04:33] were before the foundation of the world
[1:04:35] and adoption is your position on this
[1:04:37] Earth what God meant for you to do on
[1:04:39] this Earth so you could be redeemed you
[1:04:42] might not be adopted you might not
[1:04:43] fulfill your purpose on this Earth but
[1:04:45] adoption is God personally telling you
[1:04:48] that my daughter my son this is my
[1:04:50] calling for you in this life amen so we
[1:04:53] just the Lord broke it to us easy then I
[1:04:56] preach uh the Friday night I preach
[1:04:58] someone the Bible has become a new book
[1:05:01] I pick a cont from the pram where he
[1:05:03] talk about when the SE were revealed the
[1:05:05] Bible became a new book to him the same
[1:05:07] Kim James the same whatever version you
[1:05:09] use but the lord gave a different
[1:05:11] understanding that has not been unveiled
[1:05:12] on this earth right from Adam to William
[1:05:15] Braham that was the first time the
[1:05:17] almighty brought those understanding and
[1:05:19] that understanding is for you and I so
[1:05:21] we broke a little bit of that on the
[1:05:23] Friday and the pastor preached the
[1:05:25] Saturday he took uh the numbers of the
[1:05:27] Bible and then brought it from the
[1:05:29] Zodiac and you look at the eclipse that
[1:05:31] was going to happen in the US and it was
[1:05:33] just amazing so the Sunday we preach on
[1:05:35] the shba the queen of the South is
[1:05:38] rising and it was the past says brother
[1:05:42] there've been a lot of Minister that
[1:05:43] have come to pre from Canada from from
[1:05:45] us from Mexico and they were blessing
[1:05:47] but you're coming as reviv the whole
[1:05:49] church he said even look at this person
[1:05:51] look at this one look at this one
[1:05:53] everybody's Reviving The Church wow and
[1:05:55] so we we preach we finished on the no
[1:05:59] Sunday Sunday evening then we had a
[1:06:01] little get together they have an
[1:06:02] auditorium they are churches in the
[1:06:03] wooded area they have a place all by
[1:06:06] themselves in the woods on the mountain
[1:06:08] and the pastor's house is just close to
[1:06:10] the church so the pastor walk like 2
[1:06:12] minutes to the church just right there
[1:06:14] so and they have big land parking lot
[1:06:16] they don't have to compete with nobody
[1:06:17] they have an awesome natural atmosphere
[1:06:21] and they were telling me about Bram
[1:06:23] experience Bram had when he went to
[1:06:24] Puerto Rico 1959 he met their Pastor who
[1:06:27] has gone to be with the Lord called
[1:06:28] brother candelario and the brother took
[1:06:31] him to some mountains we went to tra in
[1:06:33] those mountains andam said he's been all
[1:06:35] around the world he's been to different
[1:06:37] places but the closest place that he
[1:06:39] knew to the Garden of Eden was those M
[1:06:42] mountain called Yun Forest excuse
[1:06:50] me so they were saying said he regretted
[1:06:53] for not taking his wife with him so when
[1:06:55] BR passed away his wife sister maida and
[1:06:57] the family went to Puerto Rico to visit
[1:06:59] their brother and they said the mountain
[1:07:01] competed for seven wonders of the earth
[1:07:04] it went through the competition to the
[1:07:05] last minute and then it dropped but then
[1:07:07] they found out there the mountain
[1:07:09] supposed to be the highest mountain on
[1:07:10] Earth even higher than Karo and Everest
[1:07:13] because part of the mountain is deep
[1:07:15] within the Earth and in those they
[1:07:17] didn't take account of those height and
[1:07:20] that is where the pastor was actually
[1:07:21] ordained a pastor that was a testimony
[1:07:24] I'll share with you and it will help our
[1:07:26] younger ministers that if you are
[1:07:27] faithful with the Lord you are faithful
[1:07:29] with the ministry God knows God Is
[1:07:31] Watching not just a man but God is
[1:07:33] watching so this brother was a regular
[1:07:35] brother and he lost his job he used to
[1:07:37] work with electricity company of Puerto
[1:07:38] Rico he lost his job and he went to tell
[1:07:40] the pastor Pastor I've lost my job I
[1:07:42] don't have they suspend me from my job
[1:07:44] he said don't worry today is Wednesday
[1:07:45] it's my day that I go to the mountain to
[1:07:47] pray and fast I'm going to talk to the
[1:07:49] Lord so don't worry they'll restore your
[1:07:51] job this same this this this same week
[1:07:54] they said don't worry so he went to the
[1:07:56] mountain to pray and the Lord told him
[1:07:58] that he's going to have his job so he
[1:08:00] came back and the brother didn't call
[1:08:02] him he called him on Friday he said
[1:08:03] brother I'm at work yesterday they
[1:08:05] called me that I should come back to the
[1:08:07] to my
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:11] work glory and that was a job that he
[1:08:14] did to retire he's a full-time Pastor
[1:08:16] now and so the Lord told the pastor
[1:08:18] candelario that go and anoint Jose osal
[1:08:21] as a pastor in your place so he called
[1:08:24] the brother his mother and his sister
[1:08:26] took them to the mountain I'm not sure
[1:08:28] whether he told them what he was going
[1:08:29] to do so they went to one of the highest
[1:08:30] PE they have two mountains they T abam
[1:08:32] to one of the mountain that's the
[1:08:34] highest called the uh the the Eagles
[1:08:37] mountain and then the other one is
[1:08:39] called the mountain of the Lord so they
[1:08:41] took him there and he read second
[1:08:43] Timothy chapter 1 as Paul read over his
[1:08:46] son Timothy and said you are the pastor
[1:08:49] of the church in my place and he brought
[1:08:51] him to the chair said the same respect
[1:08:52] that you give it to me give it to
[1:08:54] brother osalo he's my right hand man and
[1:08:56] not me the Lord asked me to ordain him
[1:08:58] as a pastor Wow and his ministry is just
[1:09:02] amazing wow the love one thing I learned
[1:09:05] from there when I went the first day
[1:09:07] they took me to the pastor's place to
[1:09:08] eat and then they took they gave me a
[1:09:10] tour i r a church they have a library of
[1:09:13] all the's message and their Pastor
[1:09:16] candelario their previous pastor's
[1:09:17] message and they print every message and
[1:09:20] the elderly sisters who are 80s and the
[1:09:22] 70s that's their Ministry so they have
[1:09:25] some to do every day they go and print
[1:09:27] let's say the message that is PR by Ja
[1:09:29] this week they will print it and then
[1:09:31] put in a they have a library put in a
[1:09:33] shelf so that you can go to the library
[1:09:35] and read the messages so they have all
[1:09:37] the messages stored in the churches it
[1:09:40] was just amazing and I could see our I
[1:09:43] said brother you people like the time of
[1:09:44] Solomon the harmony between them even
[1:09:46] there are brothers from Paraguay from
[1:09:49] Honduras uh Dominican Republic who are
[1:09:51] part of the ministry the love of Christ
[1:09:54] among the brothers there's not a perfect
[1:09:56] Church there's not a perfect Pastor
[1:09:58] there's not a perfect ministry but our
[1:09:59] Perfection is Christ but I could see
[1:10:02] that the epitome of what a church that
[1:10:05] should have the love of Christ and
[1:10:07] brothers and sisters coordinating as one
[1:10:10] everybody is a member of the church
[1:10:11] everybody is a body of the Christ
[1:10:13] everybody has a position in the church
[1:10:15] everybody know their Duty and they work
[1:10:17] in Harmony and I said brother this like
[1:10:19] in the time of Solomon and also the day
[1:10:21] of Pentecost when the brothers work in
[1:10:22] common Glory they support each other I
[1:10:25] me when it hit my brother it hit me when
[1:10:27] my brother is rejoicing I'm rejoicing
[1:10:29] and they all together when I me together
[1:10:32] so close together wow and it was just
[1:10:35] aming I said brother keep doing what
[1:10:36] you're doing because it's very rare in
[1:10:38] the message you know for CH to stick
[1:10:41] together so United with their pastor
[1:10:43] with the ministry and they supporting
[1:10:45] each other is is very rare so let me go
[1:10:48] to let me go to a a slide I probably
[1:10:50] will see a lot not too much let's go can
[1:10:53] we go to the second slide
[1:10:56] yeah I think that's the scripture that
[1:10:57] we read so you can read the rest of them
[1:10:58] when you get back home let's go to the
[1:11:00] next
[1:11:02] one the scripture is not new to you this
[1:11:04] is a Ministry of the wife of Christ that
[1:11:07] John was a type you should prophesy
[1:11:09] again to the nation to the people so
[1:11:12] that's your your scripture let's go to
[1:11:13] the next one you can read it when you go
[1:11:15] on your assignment that's right let's go
[1:11:17] to the next one you want to save time
[1:11:19] yes behold Revelation 1:7 these are
[1:11:21] scriptures that we fulfill them I'm talk
[1:11:23] about it it said behold he cometh with
[1:11:25] clouds and every eye shall see him and
[1:11:28] they also which Pierce him and all the
[1:11:30] kindreds of the Earth shall will because
[1:11:32] of him even so amen I'm the alpha and
[1:11:34] the Omega the beginning and the end said
[1:11:36] the Lord which is which is which was and
[1:11:39] which is to come the almighty so the
[1:11:40] first uh Revelation 1:7 was fulfilled
[1:11:43] when the Lord came on the Mount of
[1:11:45] sunset all right and talk about it we go
[1:11:48] some quotes just probably one quotes
[1:11:50] yeah that's it he said what is the
[1:11:52] attraction of the mountain and I want
[1:11:54] you to take this one personally
[1:11:55] that the Lord is with you eternity
[1:11:58] doesn't go you know sometime we talk
[1:12:00] about coming of the Lord the way human
[1:12:02] we count the Lord came the first time
[1:12:04] you come the second time you come God
[1:12:06] doesn't look at it that way he's always
[1:12:08] in
[1:12:10] you your flesh may start when you were
[1:12:12] born but God always forew you amen God
[1:12:16] didn't come and then husband you don't
[1:12:18] marry a wife and then go somewhere and
[1:12:20] come back and be with your wife and go
[1:12:22] but because we are human beings we look
[1:12:24] at a major event and call it comings of
[1:12:26] Christ but the Lord is here this morning
[1:12:29] the Lord is in your home when you having
[1:12:30] your morning
[1:12:31] devotion the Lord is in your heart when
[1:12:33] you were inspiring to S the sons of Zion
[1:12:36] the Lord is always with you but we count
[1:12:38] with numbers so we kind of make bridges
[1:12:41] but if you can go beyond the bridges and
[1:12:43] see the Lord as Eternal event Circle and
[1:12:45] cycle rolling all the time you see God
[1:12:48] all in your life it just even like the
[1:12:50] way we see the dimension when you count
[1:12:51] the dimension First Dimension is what
[1:12:53] the Earth the universe the space second
[1:12:57] is the Earth the third is time fourth is
[1:13:00] uh science communication uh technology
[1:13:02] fifth is demons hell Satan and what have
[1:13:06] you death and then six is heaven Angels
[1:13:10] Saints thees and the Seven is where all
[1:13:13] the fountain intelligence Christ himself
[1:13:15] come from but then if you want to flip
[1:13:17] it around the seventh is actually the
[1:13:20] first
[1:13:21] Dimension my God where did the Earth
[1:13:23] come from God where did the universe
[1:13:25] come from where did all the DI came from
[1:13:28] so the real First Dimension is the seven
[1:13:31] Dimension it's just like when they
[1:13:33] brought the picture of sunset to BR it
[1:13:35] was turn upside down and they said
[1:13:37] switch it your day round and they saw
[1:13:39] Jesus Christ even his beard his ears
[1:13:42] nose and everything so sometime when we
[1:13:44] count we use our human time events we
[1:13:47] limit God in our life all right but if
[1:13:49] you can say Lord you are Eternal you
[1:13:52] have no limitation have your own way you
[1:13:55] worry about nothing amen even we preach
[1:13:58] sometime when you going to preach but
[1:14:00] Jack probably will testify sometime you
[1:14:02] strug you pray and try to read you never
[1:14:04] get a sermon that's right and for why am
[1:14:06] I not getting a sermon sometime your
[1:14:07] sermon is not in West Palm Beach you
[1:14:10] have to go to wherever you're going to
[1:14:11] preach Puerto Rico Australia England
[1:14:14] when you step there the seron will
[1:14:16] develop it's just like a scene God has
[1:14:18] got something there so when you get
[1:14:20] there you just pray sometime you can get
[1:14:22] a skeleton skeletal structure of what
[1:14:24] you need to maybe one scripture maybe a
[1:14:26] quote sometime nothing brother Smiley
[1:14:29] you can tell me brother Troy you can all
[1:14:31] these brothers can tell me but when you
[1:14:33] get there the holy spirit will tell you
[1:14:34] this is the sermon this is what I want
[1:14:36] you to preach this I want to talk about
[1:14:38] and things begin to develop quickly so
[1:14:41] we have to let God have his own way and
[1:14:44] let's you brand for example there was a
[1:14:45] time God show him visions and dreams and
[1:14:48] things like that before he go to the
[1:14:49] place to preach but there was time he
[1:14:51] said no I'm not going to show you no
[1:14:52] vision and because he was so used to
[1:14:54] vision
[1:14:55] seeing you sister dressing in this color
[1:14:57] of dress with this hairo with this with
[1:14:59] his children and blah blah blah blah but
[1:15:01] there was time God said no you becoming
[1:15:03] dependent on what you see you are not
[1:15:05] going to see no vision you're just going
[1:15:07] to go just as you areall and believe
[1:15:09] that I'm in you and I will take care of
[1:15:11] you there was a time Moses used to see
[1:15:15] uh God changing what do you call it
[1:15:17] changing
[1:15:18] um what is it when he met God at the at
[1:15:21] at the at the at the desert the pill of
[1:15:24] Fire Lea right burning without consuming
[1:15:29] and a ro turning into snake and things
[1:15:31] like that but at the re SE there was
[1:15:33] nothing for Moses to
[1:15:35] see and he begin to look at his human
[1:15:38] senses and these are enemies coming and
[1:15:42] Rey are you going to drown the 2 million
[1:15:44] people you can't do it with Mother's
[1:15:46] children and soldiers were coming and
[1:15:49] you don't have even a sword you don't
[1:15:51] have nothing to fight with God wanted
[1:15:54] you to look on the inside of him to that
[1:15:57] as I'll be with you even in you am and I
[1:16:00] promise you that I the Lord taking the
[1:16:02] people from Egypt to kand I will not
[1:16:04] fail don't look at the circumstances
[1:16:06] around you don't look at what the doctor
[1:16:08] said don't look at what you are going
[1:16:10] through don't look at your bank account
[1:16:13] don't look at the US economy don't look
[1:16:15] at the dollar bill but look at Jesus
[1:16:17] Christ on the inside of you
[1:16:20] Hallelujah GL glory to the
[1:16:23] Lord thank you Jesus
[1:16:25] hallelujah
[1:16:27] amen so permit me to read this quotes
[1:16:30] that's the only quote I read and I want
[1:16:32] you to pay right attention is what is
[1:16:34] attraction of the mountain 147 said
[1:16:37] everything that shall never die what can
[1:16:40] never die is
[1:16:42] eternity even Jesus died as a human
[1:16:45] being but the pillar of the Christ in
[1:16:47] him couldn't die amen your flesh could
[1:16:50] die but the Christ in you will never die
[1:16:53] am so you are a etal being amen he said
[1:16:56] everything that shall never die it's
[1:16:58] constantly unrolling itself in other
[1:17:00] words unveiling itself from the very
[1:17:02] thing happening to the picture being
[1:17:03] Jesus standing looking at us and now
[1:17:06] exactly on Sunset Mountain so the
[1:17:09] prophet said that was Jesus looking at
[1:17:11] us was he Jesus amen it was Jesus right
[1:17:15] on S M 1963 that's right people we want
[1:17:18] to see Jesus with nails scar he finish
[1:17:21] with that
[1:17:22] Ministry he's not coming with nail scar
[1:17:24] anymore
[1:17:25] you want to see Jesus as a lamb he's
[1:17:27] done with that Ministry you don't want
[1:17:30] to go through what you went through
[1:17:31] you've never through do you want to go
[1:17:32] to become a baby with diapers anymore no
[1:17:35] you finished with that Ministry that was
[1:17:37] your ministry in diapers your mom and
[1:17:39] your dad cleaning you and you know
[1:17:41] drinking and milk and things like that
[1:17:44] you don't want to go into baby diapers
[1:17:45] anymore you want to be a full grown man
[1:17:48] or woman and that's what God want us to
[1:17:51] be it doesn't Jesus is not going to go
[1:17:52] back to Calvary to be crucified anymore
[1:17:54] no no it's not going to happen that way
[1:17:57] he said and the evening light has come
[1:17:59] God vindicating himself what is it it is
[1:18:01] the fact that God and Christ are one the
[1:18:03] white how many sees it the white wake
[1:18:05] upon him as we talk about in Revelation
[1:18:08] 1 and that's what we read reation 1: 7
[1:18:11] Revelation one the Supreme dity supreme
[1:18:14] authority no other voice no other God no
[1:18:16] other nothing in him dwells the fullness
[1:18:19] of godhead bodily the Angels themselves
[1:18:21] was his wake so the Angels were the Wes
[1:18:24] of Jesus Christ cuz it was a judge who
[1:18:26] are the
[1:18:27] Angels the ministry amen the theop the
[1:18:31] seven Messengers and the ministry who is
[1:18:33] judging West pal be but jackd all right
[1:18:36] he's not the senator he's not the
[1:18:37] governor Glory he's not the mayor of
[1:18:39] West pal right but the word that you
[1:18:41] speak the word is going around the
[1:18:43] atmosphere your life is judging the
[1:18:46] people around without you pronouncing
[1:18:48] judgment upon them amen amen if they see
[1:18:51] the Christ in you and love the Christ in
[1:18:53] you they will have a new life but if
[1:18:55] doesn't there they will go on as they
[1:18:57] are and they go into pedition he said
[1:19:00] the Angels God confirming his word what
[1:19:02] was it what what's the all the noise
[1:19:04] about is God fulfilling his promised
[1:19:06] word of Revelation CH 10 1-7 so two
[1:19:09] scriptures Revelation chapter 1 if you
[1:19:11] read the verse S he come in clouds and
[1:19:14] that was the clouds of Arizona amen and
[1:19:16] in the days of the sound of the Seven
[1:19:18] Angels messenger the mysteries of God
[1:19:19] should be finished the hidden mysteries
[1:19:21] of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to
[1:19:24] the last Church fulfills exactly in this
[1:19:27] age in this age St Luke 17:30 the days
[1:19:30] when the son of man shall be revealed
[1:19:32] amen it's not about the fantasy of the
[1:19:34] seven s revealed but what the Lord has
[1:19:37] in that Revelation personally to you
[1:19:39] amen what is the essence of Revelation
[1:19:41] is not to make our head big right but
[1:19:44] it's it has to swell your heart your
[1:19:47] Revelation because you go to certain
[1:19:48] trials your money will not help you in
[1:19:51] that in those trials your family will be
[1:19:54] of little help right you need what
[1:19:57] revelation of Jesus Christ and when you
[1:19:59] have the revelation of Jesus Christ you
[1:20:01] can become like Han Hannah right who was
[1:20:04] 70 years old but he said it was in her
[1:20:07] to have a child so regardless of being
[1:20:09] going after menopause Hannah said I want
[1:20:12] to have a child even the husband said I
[1:20:14] more than 10 children but that that
[1:20:16] didn't fulfill the heart of Hannah's
[1:20:18] heart God her faith fulfills her heart
[1:20:21] so Revelation beside eternal life God
[1:20:23] has given to you by grace
[1:20:25] but then God on your Earthly Journeys
[1:20:27] what you going to encounter if you don't
[1:20:29] have the reation of Christ you're going
[1:20:30] to crash that's right and we need the
[1:20:32] more revelation of Christ that we have
[1:20:34] the more we we walk we fly above the
[1:20:36] circumstances if you don't have
[1:20:38] Revelation little thing can upset you
[1:20:39] throw you off balance and we will and
[1:20:42] mourn and cry but if you have Revelation
[1:20:44] you see Way Beyond the circumstance amen
[1:20:47] glory to the Lord that this God
[1:20:49] permitted that circumstance for a
[1:20:50] purpose sometimes not even the devil
[1:20:52] don't worry about the devil who op the
[1:20:54] devil who allowed God does aen thank you
[1:20:57] brother Jack God allowed the devil to
[1:21:00] temp job without God Satan couldn't have
[1:21:03] done nothing so don't even worry about
[1:21:05] the devil but look at the Christ in you
[1:21:08] Christ in your brothers and sister
[1:21:09] Christ in the ministry Christ in your
[1:21:11] family and your Victory is just right
[1:21:13] there for you amen amen let's go

[1:35:01] move your shoes even your socks and just
[1:35:04] there was no prayer just forget about
[1:35:07] everything and focus on the Lord so we

[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:32] Shalom praise the Lord um you know I I
[1:39:38] think the scripture that
[1:39:40] brother quu read was just very perfect
[1:39:44] for what we just
[1:39:46] saw um there were multiple Nations that
[1:39:50] were represented there that were went up
[1:39:52] there into the mountain
[1:39:54] and even for him not realizing that he
[1:39:56] was part of a a prophecy uh uh a brother
[1:40:00] coming from Africa uh because brother
[1:40:02] quu is from Ghana and um and just going
[1:40:06] and just you know taking the gospel I
[1:40:08] don't know about you but it just does my
[1:40:09] heart great joy when I know that um uh
[1:40:14] that we're fulfilling a Great Commission
[1:40:16] you know the Lord Jesus told us to go
[1:40:17] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:40:20] and uh just to have brothers right here
[1:40:22] from our a church you know going out and
[1:40:25] and and doing some of these things it's
[1:40:26] just a it's a it's a it's a blessing it
[1:40:30] really is a blessing um I wanted to just
[1:40:33] mention because I wanted him to share
[1:40:35] that he'd be going there to Mexico now
[1:40:38] um is it Mexico yeah and uh so he and
[1:40:43] brother Mark were supposed to be going
[1:40:45] but I told brother Mark now that's the
[1:40:47] same weekend we had a picnic but I
[1:40:49] didn't mean that to stop you from going
[1:40:51] brother but uh if the Lord put in your
[1:40:53] heart to go please you know please go
[1:40:55] but I want to tell the church that um if
[1:40:59] brother brandom say if you can't go to
[1:41:02] the Foreign
[1:41:03] Fields then send
[1:41:06] somebody right and uh so you know when
[1:41:09] you know that these brothers are are are
[1:41:12] actually getting ready to go maybe you
[1:41:14] can just give them a little something to
[1:41:15] help them towards their ticket uh
[1:41:17] towards some of the expenses that they
[1:41:19] might have when uh when they go just
[1:41:21] just put a little something in their
[1:41:22] pocket right whatever the Lord would
[1:41:24] lead you but you know we want we want
[1:41:26] you to know when you know different ones
[1:41:28] are going out um and uh just keep them
[1:41:31] in prayer because uh the Lord is using
[1:41:34] uh these brothers in a very special way
[1:41:36] so I know when brother Mark first
[1:41:38] decided to come he told me he had a
[1:41:40] desire to go um into you know some of
[1:41:43] the foreign lands especially um a mon uh
[1:41:46] uh maybe in the South americ places like
[1:41:48] that so I said well brother brother qu
[1:41:50] could go quite often so we'll try to
[1:41:52] connect you with him him so you can go
[1:41:54] with him sometime but now we see Puerto
[1:41:56] Rico is another place amen that that
[1:41:59] that that that that we can go Puerto
[1:42:00] Rico is home to uh brother uh H amen
[1:42:05] that's where his family's from so uh and
[1:42:08] you know and
[1:42:09] there's I I I've known for years
[1:42:12] different Believers there but I know
[1:42:13] Puerto Rico has also been a place that
[1:42:15] has been um the enem has gotten in
[1:42:18] amongst the people there with some some
[1:42:21] strange doctrines and things like that
[1:42:22] so when you got somebody going in with
[1:42:25] the right word you know and it seasoned
[1:42:28] just right then it begins to make a
[1:42:30] difference there in the land so and
[1:42:32] they're very close to us it's you know
[1:42:34] very very close I don't know that
[1:42:36] mountain uh trip it's a wonderful
[1:42:38] wonderful wonderful experience but my
[1:42:41] God that brother said two something
[1:42:43] hours to get up three hours Saints y'all
[1:42:47] better stop eating that meat
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:54] and and and I'm going tell you something
[1:42:55] I like the way brother quu did that he
[1:42:57] say this is not a
[1:43:00] Doctrine it's not a Doctrine but but I
[1:43:03] am I mean most people don't know you
[1:43:06] know but but for for those of us that
[1:43:08] know brother quu we come out here we
[1:43:10] call him brother
[1:43:11] quu but the brother is a actual
[1:43:15] doctor the man is a doctor so he knows
[1:43:19] this stuff about the body he know what
[1:43:21] he talking about amen he he see
[1:43:24] patience right so so so you know had to
[1:43:27] work in the hospitals and seeing all
[1:43:28] kind of things and and so what he's
[1:43:31] saying for us is very very helpful now
[1:43:34] I'm I'm I'm going stand and just be a
[1:43:35] witness to what he's saying you know uh
[1:43:38] recently I just been fighting y many of
[1:43:41] y'all know that the devil attacks me
[1:43:43] with diabetes uh I don't claim it I just
[1:43:46] keep fighting against it but uh one
[1:43:49] thing I do notice is that every time I
[1:43:51] go on the Daniel Fast
[1:43:53] and my body changes I know it changes
[1:43:56] when I go to that vegan you know uh
[1:43:59] vegetarian uh type fast my body changes
[1:44:02] so you know recently at we come out to
[1:44:04] Daniel Fast we get back to our normal
[1:44:05] eating and I'm seeing my numbers just
[1:44:08] rising and rising and rising and Rising
[1:44:11] praise the Lord and um and and and
[1:44:14] actually brother Robles and sister
[1:44:16] Robles would get me special medication
[1:44:19] from Dominican Republic to help me and
[1:44:23] when when when when when I lost brother
[1:44:24] robless I'm like oh
[1:44:27] Lord but God maybe didn't want me on the
[1:44:30] medication so what I had to do is start
[1:44:33] going back to that that that Daniel Fast
[1:44:36] making it part of my lifestyle and it's
[1:44:39] something that I I just made that
[1:44:41] decision myself recently just to kind of
[1:44:43] do this I didn't know that brother going
[1:44:44] to come out here tell me a whole pastor
[1:44:46] and a whole church is doing vegan that's
[1:44:48] for me if it ain't for nobody else that
[1:44:51] was for me amen we can change our health
[1:44:57] by what we
[1:45:00] eat I'mma say that again if you going
[1:45:03] through different problems in your body
[1:45:05] right now you can change that by what
[1:45:07] you
[1:45:08] eat praise the Lord so I I've been
[1:45:11] watching myself as I as I just went back
[1:45:13] to and I never told nobody I just I
[1:45:15] start going back to what I was doing
[1:45:17] Daniel Fast my number's going down down
[1:45:20] down without that medication that used
[1:45:23] to
[1:45:26] get praise the Lord you see that

[1:45:48] um
[1:45:50] um the doctors and the pharmacist make a
[1:45:55] lot of companies make a lot of money off
[1:45:57] of us because of our dependence on
[1:46:00] medication and then there are certain
[1:46:02] medications they give you that cause
[1:46:03] your body to continue to depend upon
[1:46:08] it amen you know certain foods that you
