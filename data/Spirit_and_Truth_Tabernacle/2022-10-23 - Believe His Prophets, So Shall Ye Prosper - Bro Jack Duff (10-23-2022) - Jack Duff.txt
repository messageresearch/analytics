went forth from today and amen uh also grateful for the service on last week I certainly appreciate brother Quake who's standing and preaching on his birthday I did not realize it was his birthday but uh we're so happy that amen he came in and gave of his heart to the Saints and I was listening to Brother Joseph actually singing especially I was blessed by that on last week so God bless you all just really appreciation I bring you greetings from Florence South Carolina the Saints their sent their greetings to you and we had a wonderful time while we were away and I know some other saints were away brother and sister Capers told me to tell you um they're not here today because uh Sister Kate was just developed a little uh I guess nipples or something like that he said but we made it there and made it back home safely and they doing just fine uh just that they want to send their greetings to the church but trust that the Lord will touch her and that they'll be back in service uh shortly amen musicians think y'all very much appreciate a man uh your service to the Lord on today I won't take too much time I did need to mention so uh following and then following the service I just need to quickly meet with the church a couple things I need to mention to you so if you don't mind just everyone stay behind right after Services they have to meet with you quickly amen um this this morning and I want to go to the second Chronicles chapter 20 and as brother Solomon already said good to see brother friends so uh here in the house of the Lord on today uh good that good to have him I don't know if we announced about the upcoming meetings Okay so y'all know brother Danny got a meeting coming up um the first weekend and in December so we want to encourage everyone to try to be a part of that and I know we also have uh brother um uh Jason's meetings that are coming up at the end of this month um I believe it's next weekend and we got a few of our young people that are going up okay I know we saying the same thing so when I say this weekend I'm talking about right here but I'm when I say next week and I'm talking about next weekend so it's all right I know we're saying the same thing uh but I know that we got young people that are that are headed up that way and my prayer is that God would do something special for our young people uh you know when I was younger our parents used to send us to some of the meetings like that and they were life-altering experiences that we would have and I'm glad that you know there are churches that are picking it up my brother Jason was telling me um you know the one time he was a part of a church but in that church they just had no vision for the young people and I was telling some of the other brothers I said when you see a church that is just all young people you got a problem and if you see a church with all old people you got a problem uh you got to have a church that's mixed with both right that that's a living church right and uh so so it's very important that we continue to uh you know just try to put in our our youth you know put them in environments where God can get a hold of their life uh and you know coming to church is great and I mean but sometimes when you're just sitting underneath the the coattails of Mom and Daddy uh they not as free as they like to be sometimes so it's good to put them amongst other young people that's striving Amen to serve the Lord and and young people that want you know the right things so uh you know we want to encourage them and you know and and and and parents I I would just you know throw this out anytime you desire to send your kids to something like that and uh you know don't don't if you have a situation where we just we want to do it we just don't have the finances just talk to us just let us know something right because we want to help we want to put the kids in environments like that that is our desire amen and I'm praying that God will get a hold of them they'll come back changed and amen with a fire in their soul praise God Amen this is the next Generation so we got to sow into the Next Generation amen praise the Lord so let's just read a scripture here uh Second Chronicles chapter 20. and verse 20 praise the Lord amen Second Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 20. uh just says this and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said Hear Me O Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem uh believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe His prophets so shall ye Prosper amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read scripture uh but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us not only understand but even apply the scripture to where we are right now so we pray father that you would just uh speak to us and that you would Minister to each and every heart to every need here today may you be glorified magnified exalted father in this place and we'll be careful to give you all the honor and all the glory and all the Praises in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated amen um we want to take for a subject today believe His prophets and so shall ye prosper my man believe His prophets and so shall you prosper um we'll open amen our thought with a quote coming out of the message a greater than Solomon is here amen um I will just make mention that sometimes in just listening to the title of brother branham's sermons there was a sermon actually in the title uh and uh you know you you just sometimes just try to catch what the Holy Spirit might be trying to sing but hearing this message are greater than Solomon is here the prophet says this now and anytime that God ever sent a gift to the world and the people received it so it's one thing to send a gift to the world but it's another thing to receive the gift uh respect the gift a man uh appreciate the gift that God has sent us right he says uh any time that God ever sent a gift to the world and the people received it they become it was a golden age for them he says but when they rejected it good God Almighty they went into chaos all right watch this not a list they go to and disaster now look I I don't have to look very far Amen to see that what brother Branham said here this is 1961 that he's making a statement and when you just look around and you see people that have rejected the messenger amen right they rejected the message their lives go into chaos and disaster amen it's very very clear what the prophet is saying here anytime amen God sends a gift come on y'all not not a man coming with his own gift and his own what uh his own ideas and thoughts but when God sends the gift when people accept it it's a age it's a golden age for them but when they reject it it becomes chaos and disaster all right he says he says this they went into chaos and disaster and into punishment now your Bible historians just speak uh uh when one time that they ever rejected God's gifts and his signs and they ever prospered I I just look at the prophet saying this to these people preaching a sermon uh greater than Solomon is here create him inside great in Solomon is not coming amen the great and Solomon is here good God Almighty amen hallelujah says he says uh one time when they were going to battle he spoke God spoke to him says if you wish to prosper do my prophets no harm believe my prophets believe my prophets if you want to prosper well now we know that if this United States of America would accept the gift of God that sent to it which out of America has went evangelists and missionaries that started healing Revival worldwide as the angel Lord 31 years ago spoke down there the river when that light pillar fire hung there and the papers packed it Mystic light appearing over local Baptist Minister uh boy while baptizing 500 at the Ohio river and he said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ this message shall forerun II and here we are has it did it see from there it sparked from there from there amen it sparked Oral Roberts come on somebody amen it sparked Tommy Hicks it sparked T.L Osborne and so forth around and around the world they went you know there was a I was just listening to uh a brother just kind of share his testimony um there was just just uh you can take that down for a second he was um you know he's he's believing this message and and uh living out there in in Oregon I believe it was and there was a particular church that invited him to come in as a minister and everything they invited him to come it's like you know we really need you to to be here in our church we really want you to be in our church we really like feel like you'll be able to kind of take us to the next level and uh just just having you around here and speaking every once in a while we really feel like you'll take us to the next level it says but the only thing is now uh we just can't have you preaching about brother Branham right we can't have you doing that around here so he says well you know uh uh I believe the message amen and I'm going to preach that if y'all have me preach that's what I'm gonna preach so you know he knew at this church teal Osborne was very well connected to this group of people it says T.L Osborne was one of the people that actually helped get this church started and he says uh he knew T.L Osborne was coming to the church and there he was like the only one in the church believer in the message and he couldn't find another message church around so he was just going there he says now if I preach y'all know what I'm going to preach I'm gonna tell you what brother Branham said right so he says teal Osborne was coming and he said he was sitting there praying he said now T.L Osborne I know you've had some experience with this message he says I hope you would get up here and share with these people what you've had experiences with you know don't don't don't sit here and just kind of shirk your responsibility tell these people where it comes from your Healing Ministry and I had all God tell these people where it comes from so he was just praying Lord don't let them don't let them get out that Pulpit without sharing his testimony well teal Osborne got the talking and preaching he says I I just feel led to stop right here I feel like to stop I I want to just kind of take time and just kind of share this is how it all got started for me and it began to tell him about brother Brandon and this church was against brother Branham but they're here here he's connected to the church he helped get the church started but he had to tell him the truth as the weirdest thing got started Hallelujah glory to God if if if the nation of America would accept it the gift that God had the gift that God sent if the nation of America would have accepted where would we be today glory to God and then I want to go deeper in destination what about the church if the church would have accepted the gift that God had sent where will we be today all right let's go on a little further here amen he says um uh notice now it says if America would receive God's gift it would be a golden age for us if all of the American churches would accept God's gift what is God's gift to the church the Holy Ghost amen he says what if all the American people that believed in Christ would receive the Holy Ghost they wouldn't have to wonder who's going to be in the Sputnik now I like that brother Branham did not even put it on himself amen he said the gift is the Holy Ghost all right he says uh the Holy Ghost what if all American people believe uh that believed in Christ we received the Holy Ghost they wouldn't have to wonder who's going to be in the Sputnik or who's going to be in a machine 180 miles around that church would be in glory before they could get a Sputnik started Hallelujah glory to God I don't care what is going on with Russia we don't have to be worried about that it ain't nothing to be worried about church glory to God I mean you start don't don't don't feed on everything you you hear in the news because they're only telling you what they want you to know well I'm gonna tell you something for me I'm always watching prophecy and man I mean and I know that Russia is the King of the North amen I believe all that's happened in Ukraine is that they're forcing a man a portion of the 144 000 to get back to Israel that's all guys doing for us in a hundred a portion of the 144 000 to be back in Israel because he cannot deal with the 104 44 000 outside of Israel and now when he's Gathering that 144 000 to deal with them the bride has to be gone glory to God before he starts dealing with them blessed be the name of love so I'm looking for a rapture I'm under expectation for a change in my body all right church I'm not really worried about what's happening over there but watch this brother Brandon's going to say something here he says uh he says uh uh uh now that they're they're they the church would be in glory before they could get a Sputnik started that's right and you don't have to worry about now they're so scared if we would receive God's gift to us why we wouldn't have to try to dig holes to hide from the atomic bomb if we just receive the gift believe it's prophets and you'll Prosper all right he says uh uh uh you wouldn't have to they wouldn't have to dig holes to try to hide from the atomic bomb and put all the newscasts out to build a shelter to get into it I want to ask you something they claim this new hydrogen bomb that's the only ones we know of amen we don't know what they got back to sleep it says but they can stand in Moscow Russia and time a bomb right on this building by the stars and got it by radar and got them placed to every major nation in every major city in the world just pull on a string and There She Goes somebody's gonna drink too much vodka one day and there it'll be but you know what we we realize that uh you know they got stuff that they ain't even told us about amen and all the little threats going on back and forth everybody trying to prove who what that what they got we we realized that it could just be wiped out in no time but for me I'm looking for a Rapture of the church before the destruction come and the other thing I know about this is that they can't wipe out this whole earth I don't care what threats they make they can't wipe it out yet the reason being that 144 000 have not been called yet Mosin lies have not come yet Hallelujah somebody so there's scripture that must be fulfilled and there's nothing that nobody can do that to stop scripture from being fulfilled oh I'm holding on to every promise here you know looking at this word Prosper amen uh I just kind of pulled it up out of the Webster's Dictionary and uh and what prosper mean because the scripture tells us believe it's prophets and and we'll Prosper um the script I mean the dictionary uh definition is to flourish uh to thrive a man to do well uh to bloom to Blossom it said to burgeon or to progress and then and one different one one definition says to do all right for oneself amen that's what prospering means Amen to do all right for oneself to get ahead Amen to be successful glory to God believe it's prophets and you'll be successful can I uh uh you know how to not see that told everybody had to go to a certain City Amen in order to be successful you know amen you know oh Lord have mercy amen you know uh don't don't get caught up in that uh people tell you that you need to go to Atlanta to be successful come on somebody no you need to believe it's Prophets if you want to be successful right amen if you want a flourish if you want to thrive believe it's prophets all right all right now here uh I'm just picking up a couple scriptures that kind of flow with this this different dictionary definition Psalms 92 and verse 13 and 14. Glory those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish amen if you want to prosper if you want a flourish you want to bloom you want to Blossom amen be planted in the house of the Lord hey I'm a living Witness I've seen young people uh come up in life amen um you know and and some uh some will will after they finish a high school someone will go to college amen some won't go to college and that's perfectly all right to every I mean everyone got their own choice praise God but I've seen it you know because I didn't when I first come out of high school I didn't go right away to college I didn't do it right away but I still prospered I came out of high school and got a real good job at a at a big company uh Pratt Whitney I was still prospering as a young man not just me but I saw other young people that were in the same church serving the lord Faithfully planning in the house of God and they were flourishing so young people I want to tell you it's not about your education it's about how you serve God praise God if you would just stay planted in the house of God I even seen young people make decisions that when they even if they went to college they still stay close to a church some of them only with the school that was real so they could be back in church on the weekends they put God first even above their education this is how you flourish those that be planted in the house the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall still breathe still bring forth fruit and o h they shall be fat and flourishing I love that I'ma just put it in your your language today even when you collecting Social Security do flourishing your knees are still met come on somebody you even when you approach retirement you didn't know how you was gonna make it but because you were planted in the house of God you find yourself flourishing that every need it's always been met look God if God took care of you while you was working the same God we'll take care of you when you stop working that job was nothing but a resource but God himself was your Source has always been and will always be your source those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they should be fat and flourishing I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about you'd be surprised you know some of the Saints and and man they on a fixed income but they're flourishing [Music] amen that's God's promise to you let me go on a little further Psalms 1 verse one through three bless is the man that Walker not in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful look at this but his Delight I enjoy this walk that I'm walking I I I like this this life is better than any other life that I can live on this Earth glory to God his Delight come on somebody you know where I found my delight in the law some people find a delight in Grace but David said I found my delight in the law glory to God Amen his delighted in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night man I think about the word of God all the time I want to be I want to live a life that's pleasing to God amen and he shall be like a tree planted praise God Amen by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither that means even though it might be a winter time I won't experience it my leaf will not wither and whatsoever what a promise here church I like this whatsoever he doeth will prosper now you know uh you got to understand something it did just you know many of us got businesses amen that uh that are started we got to realize our businesses go through seasons amen there's gonna be a season where ain't no business coming at all glory to God it's gonna feel like winter amen a winter season for your business but your Leaf ain't gonna wither in a little bit when you're going through winter season that's when you just draw closer to God through prayer and when you are praying what you need to learn to do is always remind God of what he promised you and what God promised me in my winter season in my business he told me whatsoever I did whatever I do it's supposed to prosper if I cut grass I'm a prosper [Applause] hey man if I'm a janitor in the building I'm a Prosper God gonna give me the best building to be the janitor whatever my job is I'm supposed to prosper that is a promise over me because I Delight in the law of the Lord Isaiah 55 and 10. amen Hallelujah first of rain coming down and the snow from heaven in returneth not vivid but water the Earth and making it bring forth and budge that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater amen so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void that means empty God's word is not going to return empty amen but it shall accomplish that which I please and look at this and it shall prosper and the thing where to I sent it these are God's promises amen Believers prophets and so shall you prosper third John one and two can I read it amen glory to God beloved I wish above all things amen that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul prosperous now you know I I just want to say this you know uh Prosperity is something a lot of people look forward to amen and and that they want to succeed in just about every area of Life uh they want to succeed in business um you know those that play sports they want us to see it in sports those that have careers they want to succeed in career in their career music a man preaching everyday things in life we want to be successful but I want you to realize the most important thing that you can be successful in and the most uh the best thing that you can have prosperity in is when your soul is prospering hallelujah amen the Bible say what does it profit a man to gain this whole world and then lose his soul right so when your soul is prospering but in order for your soul to prosper you got to be planted amen amen and it's one thing to be planted in the house of God and to be potted in the house of God two different things amen I learned this when I was working at Christ Fellowship they say you want to be planted in the house of God not just pot it because a potted plant can be moved easily moved picked up and just drug away a trial coming you gone just like that but brother something that's planted you have to do some digging to get that up [Music] glory to God I'm I'm so glad we got Saints that's planted not just pot it here it is Greek Lexicon amen this word Prosper uh it it says to to lead by a direct and easy way amen uh to Grant a successful issue to cause the Prosper to be successful all right and they also use another definition to Grant a prosperous and expeditious Journey so you know when I look at it from the the Greek there are a couple things that I want to point out here and I want to get back to another scripture in a second but Ellie easer a man was the uh the faithful servant to Abraham and uh Elise or what caused his journey to be successful or what causes journey to be prosperous is that Eliezer found a wife for the promised son Hallelujah when Rebecca said that she would go back with Ellie he's all she heard was the testimonies of who Isaac was she never saw a picture of him amen and there were no Facebook connections amen no social media connections all she heard were the testimonies of what was going on in that house and she says I will I will go and be with this man I will be his wife so elieza had a prosperous Journey when he prayed that prayer at the well and Rebecca coming was an answer to his prayer that made his journey prosperous glory to God I think about Joseph amen and all the things that Joseph went through there uh in uh in his lifetime Joseph the Bible says was a prosperous man amen and Joseph prospered at home his daddy gave him the rainbow the seven color rainbow coat which was a little different from all his brothers and and and I I I I I I always when I talk about his stories always tell parents you'd be careful how you treat one kid over the other because you can cause a problem in your family amen don't don't be telling I love you more than I love no no don't be saying things like that I love you equally amen amen you want you want to want to minimize some of the troubles in your family treat them all equally now they all different but treat them equally some of them cut up some of them act up but you still gotta love them all they're yours praise the name of the Lord amen amen they see Christ through you come on certs amen you got to be Jesus to them children Hallelujah all right but but but but Joseph prospered at home Joseph even prospered in slavery that's why I got promoted in Potiphar's house Joseph Joseph was probably whatsoever he was doing Joseph was prospering not only did Joseph Prosper slavery Joseph's prospered Joseph prospered in jail [Applause] he became the head man over everybody in jail everywhere Joseph went he prospered and Everywhere You Go praise His holy name you're supposed to prosper believe His prophets and so shall ye prosper at home I'm a prosper Amen in slavery he prospered in jail he prospered on this job I Prosper on my next job I Prosper wherever I go I prosper and the reason I'm plus because I'm planted in the house of the Lord glory to God Amen the other thing I found is that Joseph also profited in the palace everywhere he went because he became second in charge to Pharaoh Joseph was prospering and I want to say this in Noah's day his family believed and they prospered amen they were the only ones that survived the flood of that time is because they believed a Prophets and they prospered and Moses Dave those that believed his message they prospered amen the firstborn received life praise God Amen later on you see in the scripture that Caleb was still holding on even though Moses was gone Caleb was holding on to a man of things that Moses told him it had not yet come to pass in the days that Moses was alive but because God was in Moses and everybody knew God was in Moses what he said it was going to prosper amen and Caleb said look I says uh I realized that Moses is gone and I've been waiting on this mountain for 40 something years he says I'm just as strong today as I was when I received the promise it says now therefore give me this mountain praise God Caleb kept us kept this focus on on that mountain that he knew Moses promised him keep your focus on the promises that God gave you you're prospering you'll be successful in it Caleb received his mounts another one that I I want to pick up because he believed the prophet Joshua believed the prophet and he prospered can we pick him up in Joshua 1 verse 5. glory to God look at this oh yes amen amen Joshua accepted his commission to take the people to the land and he also had the commission to divide it amongst the people and here he was told in Joshua 1 verse 5 says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of our life my this man was not gonna lose no battles amen as long as they follow the word of God as long as they follow what the prophet said they wouldn't lose no battles so there should not anymore and I love this you know uh uh here let me keep reading their son I need man to be able to stand before thee all the days of life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and you know and I think about that that promise that God gave Joshua that um you know I never let even though Moses did things that he wasn't supposed to do he when God told him to speak to the Rock he struck it struck it twice right and uh uh and it caused him to miss the promised land because he disobeyed God Amen uh Joshua saw Moses failed but God said look as I was with Moses I will not failed enough for safety Joshua saw Moses called for flies and and and all the plagues that hit Egypt and he saw God just operate in Moses life Hallelujah but he saw that same God come on the scene in his life glory to God because here Joshua had the opportunity to speak the word son stands still Moon hang over Angeline the same God that was with Moses was now demonstrating that he was with Joshua my Joshua held to the word that God told me hell to what Moses said look at this verse 6 be strong enough good courage For unto this people shall not divide for an inheritance the land which I swear into their fathers forgive them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded me I love these words Joshua do all the law not the parts that you agree with right but Joshua do it all yeah amen if you want to prosper just accept it all elujah amen we're not here to try to explain it away we're here to just accept it all amen all that the prophet said all right says this uh it says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou man subserve to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commandity turned not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with us so ever thou goest amen this book of the law shall not depart out of that mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night mode I mean Joshua meditating therein David meditating there and guess what we should also be meditating therein amen day and night that thou mayest observed to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous believe His prophets and so shall you prosper then shall I make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with us so ever thou goest you know Joshua uh given this Great Commission and he fulfilled it in his day and he prospered in the thing that God sent him on this Earth to do amen but he hailed to what Moses said he always reminded the people what Moses said Glory Glory Glory Joshua did not have his own message hello somebody he was still following Moses message even though Moses was gone amen we don't have our own message we're following a message glory to God even though our Prophet is gone believe His prophets so shall you prosper all right this uh I think we'll find in scripture there's so many people a man that had the opportunity to come in contact with a prophet in their day and they believe that Prophet May prospered uh one of them amen we find the story in in second Kings chapter seven and I won't I won't read it I'll just tell it tell it to you but this was a very um a a difficult time the prophet had already spoke that there was not going to be any rain until he called for rain and uh here he was impacted by his own words glory to God there was no rain and and the people are in a family and uh one day he's you know God sends him and and has some Ravens there prepared to bring him food glory to God he had not just room service but he had Raven service amen that probably was receiving food from the he never worked for it God just sent it oh I love God you know God would just send you business when you need it and you all your mark ERS would never get that sending you business when you need it hey he'll have the Ravens bring it to you Hallelujah you get an email find out about me God know how to get you what you need and here you know the prophet is is uh it's benefiting from the Ravens bringing them the food but that got to a point where the brook had dried up amen the Raven's not bringing uh any food and the other thing about the prophet now in order for him to get the food from the Ravens he had to be in the very specific spot amen that God had ordained the Ravens to go I I want you to understand you just can't be anywhere to get spiritual food you got to be exactly where God wants you to be in order to get your soul fed in order for your soul to prosper glory to God amen amen so you know uh hear the the the the brook is dried up and and now they're at a spot where you know God has told the prophet to move said there's no more water here the Ravens are not coming back but he says I got a woman that I have uh ordained to sustain you through this drought he said I want you to go down to her house and here he goes down to this this woman of zarephathy goes to Harrison and the seeds are out there going to maybe pick up some sticks to kind of get a fire lit so she can make her last cake Hallelujah and the prophet looks at it says now uh woman if you don't mind would you go and just fetch me some water and brother Brandon said she was feeling sorry for this old man she didn't realize this old man happened to be a prophet glory to God but she's feeling sorry to say you know what I think I can share my last thing of water with him but I'll eat I'll save the cake for my son and I but I'll give him the water Hallelujah and that she's going to get the water see here's a voice from the Bible say if you don't mind Hallelujah glory to God if you don't mind would you bake me a cake first in the start of the woman she said now wait a minute now I don't mind giving you the water but don't you see there's a famine in the land and I got one more uh a thing that I can bake a cake with and I was gonna give it to my son and to myself and then we were gonna die he says now don't you worry about dying sister says if you would bake me a cake first Hallelujah I'm here to tell you something that you've been looking to hear my sister you've been waiting on these words thus saith the Lord your Crews will not go empty and your bear will not run dry if you can believe His prophets then you will prosperized [Applause] the Bible says she was sustained through that because she believed the prophet her household prospered I want to pick up this a man these disciples in Luke chapter 5. let's pick him up here Luke chapter 5. believe His prophets you'll prosper and this has been something that people been doing all all since time began I'm telling from the days of Noah they believe the prophet they prospered those that rejected to the prophet they didn't Prosper this is going to be the same thing today glory to God God don't change his mind Jesus himself being the prophet of all prophets here's a we're picking up the story here in in in in in Luke 5. let's read it says uh and it came to pass as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of genocide now let's just try to put ourselves on the scene as to what's going on here I thank God that God sent us a prophet that can kind of give us some a panoramic view of everything that's going on this day he enters into Luke 5 and he tells us amen that what has happened is that the disciples have been out fishing all night and they finally parked there at their boats they they put them to dock in a certain spot and the Very spot that they put their their boats to dock in Jesus happens to come to that area and he's preaching to the people hallelujah and as he's preaching to the people you know uh the disciples that come to a spot where you know here they are absolutely discouraged amen of of of of of not catching any fish they're discouraged because this is their their livelihood they sell these fish and they make money they feed their family but here they're going out at night and they caught nothing amen so so the day that uh Jesus shows up I'm sure this is a day when the disciples are absolutely discouraged let's get it now amen the absolutely discouraged while Jesus is preaching amen the people are just approaching the Crowds Are Gathering and and brother Brandon say Peter's just sitting on a stop saying you know let me just hear what this man got to say so you know I heard about him I heard this I heard that but let me just hear what this fella got to say hallelujah he coming with an attitude to church glory to God Amen sometimes we come to church with the same old types of attitude we don't realize God can change our situation with just one word one action can change everything amen the power of the spoken word is here to change anything if you would just operate in faith God can speak to your condition let's pick it up here in Scripture he said something came to pass that as the people pressed upon him so he's been pressed out into the waters standing a short preaching about the people keep oppressing pressing now he's standing in the water now watch what happens it says upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of genocide and he and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their Nets it says and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now now what Jesus is doing is just I got to separate just a little bit from the land I don't want the people to kind of trying to come out here in the water to hear what I got to say imma talk loud enough so y'all can hear me right here from this ship now it's not an accident that Peter is in church this morning it's not an accident that he Parks his boat glory to God right where Jesus gonna meet up need a boat amen all these things are foreign by God everything you going through right now has been for ordained by God Pete is discouraged Jesus see the other disciples um uh getting their necks and everything all fixed up because they they want to go fishing again this is their this is their their trade but he's there on the boat he said just push out a little bit uh Peter I need to talk to the people just pushed out a little bit from the show so they don't press me and try to get in the boat either just just push out a little bit Hallelujah some Miracles are just for you [Music] putting a little distance between him and the people because he really need to deal with Peter come on somebody amen he really want to deal with your situation so sometimes he got to separate you from everybody just create a little distance because this miracle is for you look at it now it says in uh now when when uh uh verse three and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the lamb and he sat down and talked the people out of the ship now when he get left speaking his sermon was over he's in the boat still now the sermon is over and maybe Peter trying to figure out what no okay what we gonna do now Hallelujah Peter got something for you thank you for letting me borrow your ship I got something for you Peter glory to God Amen said now when he left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep Hallelujah don't get shallow now amen but launch out into the deep praise God believe God for the impossible let down your nets for a drought that mean a big catch a fish now now watch this and Simon answer said unto him master we have taught all the night he says and have taken nothing look I tried this before I got nothing I tried that before I got nothing and then you come to church and God will say do this and now you got to watch it because because if you don't believe that it's God you you sit there and you reason like Peter look I don't tried that before brother Jack I done did that before brother Chad and one brother Jack speaking to you it was God for speaking through brother Jack you got to be able to catch the voice of God look at look and say we didn't he says this we uh uh we have torn all the night and we have taken nothing now I don't believe I'm gonna get nothing but nevertheless and I love the Lord I love the Lord I love the Lord even with your doubt you can't stop him from blessing you [Music] your doubt can't stop God's blessings you trying to help him out and all that that that don't work Hallelujah believe it's prophets and you'll prosper nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net yeah amen and that's all he needed to do was add his words believe His prophets brother you're going to prosper watch he says and and when they had when they had this done when they had finally did it say when they had this done they enclose a great multitude of fishes and their net break and I I got another sermon I'm just waiting on the the Lord to give it to just give me all the inspiration but I want to tell you it's time for the Overflow it's time for the Overflow amen glory to God some so you got to go through your Seasons amen sometimes seem like a season of nothing but then there's a season of overflow and now when you get to the season of overflow you got to know what to do with the Overflow I'm hoping your overflow ain't just paying all your back bills hello somebody I'm hoping your overflow can actually put you at another level amen we're not waiting we don't we get tired of waiting on our tax return so we can pay off all our bills you ain't enjoyed nothing yet glory to God waiting for January I get get I gotta get it in get it in I need that money to do what with it hey man you ought to get that money to invest do something nice glory to God not pay somebody hello Church glory to God Amen Let the Overflow really keep us at a spot of overflow all right but here here he says um and when he had done this then closed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned them to their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and feel both the ships so much fish that it filled both the ships and not only that so that they begin to sink can I tell you something we all don't have problems and sometimes I like to classify like this there are some good problems to have I want my boat to sink with fish I went from not having nothing on my boat sinking but believe His prophets now if he would have kept arguing with the prophet he wouldn't have got this blessing but when he believed the prophet he prospered when Simon Peter saw it he fell down and Jesus knees saying depart from me I'm a for I'm a a a a sinful Man O Lord now Peter still don't even know how to pray this man just got on your boat and your boat sank and you accidentally leave no no stay for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes was he had taken all right let me leave that let me just uh give you a little quote here out of at Thy word and then I want to slip back oh God help us here uh at Thy word he says uh Peter said Lord we toured all night and we've taken nothing says that's discouraging uh they were fishermen they were they they just wasn't guessing they know where the sea and how the moon should be and where the fish was uh uh they they was raised on that seat Galilean and they tore it all night through the same through that same water and it hadn't taken a thing but he said Lord at Thy word I'll let down the Nets it says there's the secret amen there's the secret he says you've been you you've been maybe sane through every doctor's office there is in the country you might have been through prayer lines since you might have had your pastor praying you might have consecrated you might you might have consecrated Christians to pray says you might you might have tried everything that you know how to do but tonight say at Thy word Lord I'm gonna let down the net right now I'm gonna stop trying anything I'm just going to believe you right now and take at your words I'm gonna let down the Nets and it won't be long it won't be long when you're pulling till you feel the tug and the neck will be full of fishes and brother random said what kind of fish is joy salvation healing restoration Deliverance the Holy Ghost come on somebody amen whatever you need that's the fish that you need God got that kind of fish for you it says blessings from God Hallelujah I like that I I'm holding I'm holding God to his word I'm I'm a Believer it's Prophet so I can prosper I want to switch switch back to Jehoshaphat amen um here the um I was just reading the scripture now and I'm just I'm gonna have to pull this from the scripture let's go back to Second uh Chronicles 20. they were told to believe the prophets and they would prosper and um this is exactly what happened I want to uh pick up and and at the beginning of this chapter though so we can kind of get what was going on here hallelujah um it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of our mind and with them other beside the Omni ammonites uh came against Jehoshaphat to battle Then There came some that told Joshua saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from Beyond the Sea on this side Syria and behold they being haza santamar which is in Getty and Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and Proclaim to fast throughout all Judah now as I was reading this just the Lord just kind of quickened to me just a few few things uh this this is a threat that uh Joshua I'm so Jehoshaphat has received and um and and this threat is that hey you got these great armies armies have come I mean they they merging and they're coming to fight you they got they got I mean um these people coming to fight you right now you need to get ready for this Jehoshaphat and and the thing is is you know we get reports from doctors we get reports from lawyers we get reports from all kind of people tell us about different things that's going to happen and I want to tell you when you get the report take it seriously amen take the report seriously amen now now now now um you know uh uh even if a doctor is telling something you can still believe God for your healing but sometimes you need to know what you believe in God for so take it seriously and and I know some people say I don't go to doctors well now you got to watch that too brother Branham say anybody a man that is trying to help you get better is a blessing to you yeah now I realize there's some doctors out there trying to get money that's why you try to get do it two or three opinions but take it seriously glory to God and you know the way you've been eating you know how your body responding come on now the way you've been eating yeah you know your body ain't satisfied the way you've been eating you know that and now you're uh I believe God I I am too I believe God will help you change your diet some more practical teachers God can help you change your diet amen all right Church glory to God Amen but my daddy was doing good to brother Mike Cameron boy they went on the glory together boy I tell you my dad was doing good we all went up there to that place and my dad just eating sprouts and all kind of live foodie calling but we got up there to that that uh holy land and and a turkey leg and brother brother Mike so you almost had me brother Birds you almost had me I was almost getting ready to start eating them Sprouts but you eating the turkey hey man sometimes you need people that'll go along the journey with you you know hey man we all need it glory to God all right here but take it seriously I just wanted to say that verse 4 says and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah that came to seek the Lord and and Jehovah stood in the congregation of Jude and Jerusalem in the house the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers art not thou God in heaven and rule is not thou over all the kingdoms now these are his enemies he talked about but he said God you're still in control of my enemies amen he says the rule of not thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee look at it now and it goes on in verse 7 says art not thou our God who this drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever now look at what what he's doing as he's praying you can see he is reminding god of the things God has already done God you promised us this land we dwelling in our land and here come the enemy trying to take us from our land God we can't fight this battle but you can Hallelujah watch it now he goes on a little further says and they dwelt therein and have built their Sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestless or famine we stand before this house this is another reminder of what God had told him because he is actually quoting Solomon's Prayer my God you got to remind god of what he already promised you amen hallelujah and when you're reminding god of what he promised you the devil got nothing he can do then you stand on God's words do you believe it's Prophet prophets and you're going to prosper watch this he says uh if Will evil cometh upon us as a sword of judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house glory to God and cry unto thy unto thee in our fiction then thou will hear and amen singing We Serve a God they're not just hears but a god that is also able to help I thank God for the God that I serve yes it says it now behold the children of our mind and Moab and mount Sierra are whom thou with us not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of our possession which thou has given to given us to inherit look at it now he says uh uh uh oh oh our god without not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee sometimes you go through things in your life and you have no idea what the answer is you have to sit there and just you know just wait on the Lord and I want I just want to uh throw this out in verse 13 go to the next verse it says in all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children so what I want to get you to understand he prays and when he realized that lord I can't do nothing about this this great arm is coming against us and God I can't I can't me myself I can't handle it but I know you can so I'm bringing it to you and when after he makes his prayer the other thing he does is just just wait the Bible say they stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and they just stood there Hallelujah God knows you're waiting on them and God got a word for you when you're waiting now look let me tell you something you can't be waiting and scheming because I got a question for you which one you doing which one you're doing if you waiting and scheming God like to put you in a spot where you can't do nothing that that mean you ain't gonna get no glory in this God gonna get all the glory he puts you the spot where you can't do nothing but just depend on him and the Bible say Judah stood before the Lord and with their little ones and their wives and their children standing there waiting let's see what happens Oh Glory then upon jahaziel the son of Zachariah the son of Ania the son of Zaire the son of mananiah a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation while they're waiting go on Amen it says and he said hearken ye all Judah and your inhabitants of Jerusalem oh my mama I love this Thou King Jehoshaphat they're waiting on them famous words thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude [Music] for the battle is not yours but gods Hallelujah tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the clip of sins amen and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeril it says ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye steal but you got to show up now you got to have your battle gear on when you show up now but you ain't gonna need to fight in this Hallelujah says stand you steal and see the salvation of the Lord with you o Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you bowed his head with his face to the ground glory glory and all Jude and the habitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites of the children of the core fights and of the children of the Accord Heights stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high amen and they Rose early in the morning glory to God I mean after they got the promise they just began to worship and this is something that you need to learn how to do when God give you a word he speak to your situation speak to your circle then just begin to worship Him amen ma they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa and as they went forth to our house of that stood and said Hear Me O Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established but we want to go a little further believe His prophets and so shall you prosper and let's see how they prospered let's just read how Jehoshaphat and the army of Israel Prosper after they believe what God spoke through this prophet look at it oh my says and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and and uh and murder and and to say praise the Lord for his mercy and doeth forever and when they began to sing and to praise the praise the Lord set ambushments against the children amen that means God was already strategizing God was already moving God was already doing what he needed to do you know typically what that ambushment was is like like what would happen they would always uh send a few people out into the field right understanding that y'all are higher in the field they did this back in in Joshua's day y'all hide in the field and just stay stay on the cover and we're gonna run in a certain direction and then we're gonna draw them out into the field and they don't even know that y'all there and we're gonna surprise them they think they fighting just one little group of people but they're gonna be surrounded by a group of people God know how to set ambushments on your enemies God will shock them God will surprise them God will turn things around for you but you got to believe it's prophets you'll Prosper you might be running to something that's impossible for you to handle yes but believe His prophets and you'll prosper and learn how to just praise God in the midst of it hey you know the devil might take a lot of things but don't never let them take your praise my God my God my God hallelujah man y'all should have heard brother Smiley up there singing that special last week tow the church down amen but you know it's just it's just something about you know when we learn to praise God hey Hallelujah now I'm not praising because I'm always on the Mountaintop Sometimes the best praise comes from the valley that's the best praise when it's in the valley [Music] hey I'm not serving God just for my blessings hey I believe David said I will bless the Lord at all times he said his praise shall continually be in my mouth says magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together glory to God hallelujah hallelujah all right let me keep on reading here where am I verse 20 did I read verse 22 I'll read it again when they begin to sing and to praise the Lord said in bushments against the children of Aman Moab and mount Sierra which would come against Judah and they were smitten for the children of our mind and Moab stood up against inhabitants of Mount Sierra utterly to slay and Destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Sierra everyone helped to destroy another this means the children of Israel did not have to fight this great armor that was come they hired different nations to come we're going to go against and the Nations start fighting amongst themselves I'm gonna tell you now that that's uh that that's the way we want to see it let the Devils fight amongst themselves but don't let the devil see us fighting amongst ourselves brother random made a statement said he says uh branham's fight in the backyard [Music] not the front we don't let everybody see our squabbles and all that stuff fight in the backyard but not the front when you stand in the front we brothers and sisters glory to God all right I'm still reading my God uh it says uh verse 24 when Judah came toward the Watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold there were dead bodies falling to the Earth and non-escape and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they fought they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious Jews which they stripped off of themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days and Gathering of spoil it was so much believe it's Prophets you'll prosper see but you know you say believe in believe in the Lord your God you'll be established but you believe it's prophets you'll prosper see and here here you know all Joshua I mean Josh fat was just in a in a very very dire situation not like this God loves to operate God loves to operate when we got our backs up against the wall you know the drought came for the disciples they caught all them fish when they least expected it amen the drought came when they were the most discouraged and when they were doubting that's when God did his best work oh you some of y'all think about giving up on your careers and giving up on your business and giving up on this that's when God want to do something best did God give you that idea did God establish that did God put you on that job did God is God the one it wasn't your boss that hired you God hired you God is the one that made a way for you I don't quit and give up on that amen I'm not talking of you moving on to better you might have to quit to move on the better glory to God but whatever you do supposed to prosper but be willing to endure the seasons now all right I I I was I'm I'm gonna bring it home here um you know I was just thinking about a couple different people one of um I did a a Google I'm sorry A message search uh where brother random use the term you believe me to be his Prophet just at that term I found 316 times where he said that and there were times where he would say it and he'd kind of go back and say oh I'm sorry do you mean do you believe me to be his servant now he have to say that to unbelievers but to believer you believe me there is you believe me to be his Prophet yes I believe that you were God's prophet you were the gift that God sent to this earth and I'm going to experience my own golden age because I believe that you were his prophet amen here the one of the last times that this is recorded where he made that statement do you believe me to be his Prophet actually the last quote that I found was out of the message to choosing of a bride and I want to just read this amen because he said this to you he says you believe me to be his prophet and I say yes this the last time he's made that statement was in the message choosing of a bride it says this is a solemn warning says we don't know what time you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean is old Capernaum said Jesus thou who thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah it had it had uh it have had been standing to this day in Sodom Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and Capernaum is in the bottom of the sea now as I as I'm reading this quote my mind just kind of goes back to a little um situation I had some brothers that were telling me that you know brother Brandon made the statement says he he didn't tell the truth he says Capernaum is not in the bottom of the sea he says brother random is not a prophet because capernaum's not in the bottom CSA I say I said brother are you sure about that you sure so yeah I looked it up it's not in the bottom of the sea I said okay give me just a day or so I'll get back to you so when I went and found the scripture where Jesus himself spoke that Capernaum would be in the sea I first did the research and said now I know Jesus spoke it I say Jesus spoke and then I got to find where it was manifested so I went and did all the history I did I found found exactly where manifested now I didn't tell him where it was manifested all I gave him was the scripture I said now you say brother Brandon said that this was supposed to happen and it didn't happen I said now look at this scripture and do some research on it and when he uh he got back to me says good point no I'm not trying to make a good point that's not my objective for making a good point I just prove to you that if you're gonna say brother Brandon was a liar with this quote then you also are saying Jesus is a liar and I'm trying to get you to see that's the bad spirit that is on you amen and you need to be delivered from that Spirit I'm not trying to make good points I'm trying to bring Deliverance the Bible say you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free so here he's using this term you know you believe me to be his Prophet now he's prophesying about Los Angeles all right and it says Thou City who claims to be the City of Angels who is exalted yourself into heaven and send all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things to even the foreign country some here to pick up our filth and send it away to your your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea amen he says your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer he will hold this Sandbar hanging out over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there Plumb back to the Salton Sea it would be worse than the last day of Pompeii repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ let us pray says my brother sister I don't know what more to say if I found Grace in your sight by the power of God if you believe me to be his prophet he said this is the first time in public I've ever said that he says but I feel a strange warning of some sort I'm not prone to this you know I'm not I don't act like this I hesitated to speak that message and say those things I run sideways and everything else to keep from doing it but it's been said and it'll stand at the day of the Judgment as a witness that I've told the truth that thus saith the Lord God oh Pentecost run for your life lead to the horns of the Altar and cry out before it's too late for an hour will come when you can cry and it'll do no good for Esau sought to find a place of his Birthright and couldn't find it I commit you oh California oh Convention of the Full Gospel businessman who I love who I've who I've left and strung to with all my heart I commit you uh I commit you to Jesus Christ tonight flee to him don't let the devil ever cool you off from it from this stay right with it until you're everyone filled with the Holy Ghost in so much that will make you come to this word that will make you women straighten up that will make you men straighten up if you say you got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word it's another Spirit In You God's spirit is on his word the Messianic uh the anointed word the bride must be Messiah the anointed word you know as brother Brandon was you know making this and like I said the very last time that he uses these words you believe me to be his Prophet like he said he says he really never really made that statement publicly if you believe me to be his prophet he says uh you know and make it in that fashion um we've seen Justin brother Randall's Ministry he prophesied about America and where we would be he prophesied about a a a a a a a woman vice president or president and it has already manifested itself we are living in the day where we see it manifested and I am so shocked that all these people that heard that prophecy and knew it but too much pride to acknowledge that God's Prophet was right to drop all these funny ideas drop all these funny ideas and and because and just repent say Lord I was wrong this message is right God you sent you I'ma just accept what this Prophet is saying I'm surprised that people just weren't able to do that it's a spirit that's on the people that does that and I'm gonna tell you something else if we sing the vice president be a woman and like I say you know this is stuff that was pre 80s prophesied 87 years ago so when it happened it was not a surprise to me I also know that Los Angeles is going under and it won't be a surprise to me I mean I mean scientists may say anything that they want to say and and I mean the the they they see things that happen over there they know something they don't even know when but we know according to a prophecy that is going to happen and brother Adam said it'll be you know we ain't seen nothing yet we ain't seen disaster yet I mean just what they went through on the west coast of Florida here that was pretty bad that was really people's businesses people's homes swept away just like that and with a storm that came out of nowhere what what the prophet spoke about Los Angeles it's going down a prophet is spoken I believe it amen and what what I'm doing is living right I want to be ready because I know that as this destruction comes God has a Rapture awaiting his bride [Music] amen I believe is prophet and the greatest way I can prosper is to catch this rapture wrapped in faith is in these books and these tapes amen so I'm gonna stay I'm staying with it amen I'm planted not potted praise the Lord God bless you Church there's a gentleman I I um I'm gonna just read this last quote and I'm gonna let you I'm Gonna Let You Go this this is how to does God ever change his mind about his word um this is the brother you know people you know you get Blessings by by just believing and we didn't have the opportunity to to live in the day that brother Brandon was here but there were people that lived during that time and they received some mighty blessings but they had the right attitude towards God's profit look at this man and I'm gonna say this before I read this we we were Prosper because we believe we're going to prosper physically we're going to prosper spiritually we're going to prosper emotionally we're going to prosper mentally we're going to prosper financially we're going to prosper because we believe hearing this message that God does God ever change his mind about his word look at this uh this brother Earl Martin says brother Brandon would you lay hands on me ordain me to work as a pastor he says John Martin says Earl says how many knows Earl Martin says how many believe him to be a servant of Christ he comes to us I believe the the originally from a Pentecostal group and now I think he passes and does an independent work I've known Earl to be a real servant of Christ I'll never forget one act many has been but one act with Earl I remember one night they called him when I was in Dallas Texas but I believe you know a sister says Beaumont Beaumont Texas is right sister and they said his baby was laying dying and they thought it was already dead it wasn't breathing no more and Earl made his way around to my room as a daddy bending shoulders stoop down before me as I was in bed hear the prophet laying in bed rolled out he put his arms around me and said brother I believe you are God's Pride I've always believed that says if you'll just say the word though my baby is dead yet shall it live and his baby come back to life is living I believe is Prophets you'll prosper can I put it this way believe it's prophets even your family will prosper let's pray father we thank you for your word Jesus thank you Lord that we can look at scripture that's at a little different light to housefat in the and the Army surrounded not knowing what to do but they were waiting and depending on you and they began to praise you and thank you the prophecy went forth this battle is not yours but is the Lord's all you need to do is show up for the battle and God they the the prophecy did not tell them that they would be three days and gaining the spoils that were there that's how they Prosper because they believed and Lord just even showing how Earl Martin prospered not only him but his son that was dead came back alive Lord the word was spoken in Beaumont Texas his son not even being there but the word was spoken and God the young man came back alive because his father believed Lord we stand on these same promises uh the prophet's not here for us but we still believe that he was the prophet that you sent this gift that you sent to this age and God it becomes a golden age for us if we could just accept it and walk in it those that believed in in times past and God the days of Noah they believe days of Moses they believe those that did believe they they were blessed life was spared father our prayer Lord is that we would walk Amen in that same faith that we Lord with honor and believe this word as it has been given to us We Trust Lord Jesus Lord that uh that as your word has told us that we would be that we would Prosper we're looking for that prosperity to overtake us Lord in so many different areas of our life we're trusting you Lord we believe you father no matter what it is that we're going through as the disciples were told uh let down your neck get ready for the droughts get ready for it father we're getting ready for this great drought we're in situations we don't even know ourselves how to get out of but we know that you are a great God and there's nothing too hard for you so father we give you all the honor we give you all the praise we give you all the glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen you don't forget just want to meet with the church really quickly amen um before we

generations and generations since the death of the Lord Jesus and the Bible has been written it's been written over and over there's all kind of Bibles now but everybody has a Bible and they're religious but we don't only have the Bible we have the voice of the seventh angel we have a prophet so there's no reason for us not to prosper in every aspect of Our Lives praise the Lord I tell the young people all the time you can search the scripture there's not one promise in the Bible of us to have poverty it's always prosperity and sometimes Prosperity becomes a bad word to people because they think it's always riches people that's not serving God he'll send leanness to their soul but he didn't promise that for us amen he has already provided the character to handle Prosperity through the trials that we have gone through so take your limits off God emotionally physically financially your spiritual walk there's no limits to a believer you have the power within you now to create a world out there and go and live on it foreign [Music] brother Billy Paul used to always make a statement God thought it the prophet said it that settles it and I believe amen do you believe it amen amen let's bow our hearts almighty God father we thank you for every promise of God Lord that you have written in your Holy Bible for us Lord Lord and we believe it father we refuse to doubt you anymore Lord God we refuse to reason with your word anymore father you have brought your word to us this morning Lord we believe it with all of our hearts we thank you for our pastor Lord God getting himself out of the way thank you for speaking to him thank you for speaking to us delivering this message Lord God father We Believe father thank you for sending us a prophet Lord God while the world is looking at a sealed book lord you tore back the seals Lord and you got on a personal level and spoken to each one of us Lord you called us from all walks of life that we may sojourn together Lord before going home so father I pray Lord God as you have blessed us with your presence and with your word today that you'll continue to abide with us and as we meditate on your truth Lord God may you bless it to our hearts Lord and may it continue to transform Our Lives into the image of the Sons and Daughters of God that you said that we are and Lord we intend to manifest your your word it shall not return to you Lord we are the sons and daughters of God so I pray as we prepare to leave this place for not your presence Lord may you continue to deal with our hearts and lies and move on our behalf we love you father and praise you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord God bless you you may have your seats and our pastor will be back out to give you a word God
