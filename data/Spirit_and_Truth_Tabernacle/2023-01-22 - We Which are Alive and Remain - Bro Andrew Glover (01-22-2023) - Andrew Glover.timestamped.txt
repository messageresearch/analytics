[56:17] one little statement it says obedience

[56:39] doing what God wants us to do remember a
[56:42] yielding to the perfect will of God and

[1:02:07] Holy Ghost is a must amen and I tell you
[1:02:10] we sure have appreciated this fellowship
[1:02:12] and he's never never changed always been

[1:03:55] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[1:03:58] and all the Believers says
[1:04:00] amen and amen the book of First
[1:04:03] Thessalonians the fourth chapter and I
[1:04:05] want to look in the 13th verse I know
[1:04:07] this is a very
[1:04:09] a very familiar reading to the Bride of
[1:04:13] Jesus Christ in first Thessalonians 4
[1:04:15] and verse 13 Paul says but I would not
[1:04:18] have you to be ignorant Brethren
[1:04:20] concerning them which are asleep that ye
[1:04:22] sorrow not even as others which have no
[1:04:25] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[1:04:28] and rose again how many believes that
[1:04:31] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:04:34] will God bring with him for this we sing
[1:04:37] unto you notice how they say this how
[1:04:40] Paul says this by the word of the Lord
[1:04:43] so he's speaking to them by the word of
[1:04:45] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:04:48] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:04:51] not prevent them which are asleep now
[1:04:53] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:04:55] heaven with a shout where the voice of
[1:04:57] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:05:00] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:05:02] notice here Paul pulls these words from
[1:05:05] verse 15 again into verse 17 and says
[1:05:08] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:05:11] be called up together with them in the
[1:05:13] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:05:16] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:05:18] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:05:21] words amen I also want to turn to First
[1:05:24] Corinthians 15. and just pull one verse
[1:05:28] uh from First Corinthians 15 in the 22nd
[1:05:32] verse I don't know if you in the back
[1:05:34] there Brothers if you all can give me
[1:05:36] some more in this microphone in my ear
[1:05:38] and I'll control it on my side I'd
[1:05:40] appreciate it uh First Corinthians the
[1:05:43] 15th chapter and the 22nd verse it's a
[1:05:47] very beautiful reading speaking of the
[1:05:48] Resurrection
[1:05:50] the 22nd verse Paul says for as an atom
[1:05:53] all die but even so in Christ shall all
[1:05:58] be made alive amen I like that in the
[1:06:02] second Adam which is Christ shall all be
[1:06:05] made alive we asked Lord this morning to
[1:06:07] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:06:09] word as you I can have your seats here
[1:06:11] this morning I want to by the help of
[1:06:13] the Lord for just a few moments if I may
[1:06:15] as I said I had a direction on my heart
[1:06:19] for the service this morning and just
[1:06:20] praying yesterday and meditating the
[1:06:22] whole Direction Changed so this morning
[1:06:24] I want to by the help of the Lord to
[1:06:26] speak to you on this thought of we which
[1:06:29] are alive and remain
[1:06:31] we which are alive and remain I I know
[1:06:35] you probably called it in the song
[1:06:36] services in the specials you were
[1:06:38] hearing amen the the sounds of a Rapture
[1:06:41] Amen in the hearts of the people I
[1:06:43] believe if there's ever been a time Amen
[1:06:45] to look forward to the Rapture or the
[1:06:47] second coming or the catching away of
[1:06:48] the church amen I believe now is the
[1:06:51] time to do it now remember says I'm
[1:06:53] going to be on the camp 1964. he said
[1:06:55] we'll all be called up together to meet
[1:06:57] the Lord in the air think of it amen
[1:07:00] missing people they can't see you no
[1:07:02] more but you're getting together with
[1:07:04] the rest of the group and they which are
[1:07:06] alive and remain to the coming of the
[1:07:08] Lord shall not prevent that word hinder
[1:07:11] amen those which are asleep not dead no
[1:07:14] Christians don't die they're just taking
[1:07:16] a little rest see that's all and the
[1:07:19] Trump of God shall sound and the dead in
[1:07:21] Christ shall rise first and appear to
[1:07:23] many and all at once you happen to stand
[1:07:26] and look and well there's a brother and
[1:07:29] you know it ain't going to be long amen
[1:07:31] now notice this he's separating this
[1:07:33] from those that are asleep Amen to those
[1:07:36] which are alive and remain and he says
[1:07:38] you'll be standing there and in a few
[1:07:40] minutes you'll look and there'll be a
[1:07:41] brother and he said in a few minutes
[1:07:43] we'll be changed in a moment in a
[1:07:45] twinkling of an eye and together with
[1:07:47] him will be missing on the Earth but
[1:07:49] will be called up to meet the Lord in
[1:07:51] the air now amen this is the this is
[1:07:54] where the burden of this thought this
[1:07:55] morning is coming from he said and to
[1:07:57] think with all that we have seen in the
[1:07:59] scriptures and the clear-cut
[1:08:00] vindications of the hour that we're
[1:08:03] living in it could happen before this
[1:08:05] service ends amen it could happen before
[1:08:08] this service ends what I just read to
[1:08:11] you amen from first Thessalonians 4 amen
[1:08:14] could happen before this service ends
[1:08:16] what I just read to you amen from a word
[1:08:19] Prophet that you could see loved ones
[1:08:21] appearing amen it could happen before
[1:08:23] this service ends I I think it's a very
[1:08:26] powerful thing to realize that the world
[1:08:28] conditions amen they're not going to get
[1:08:30] any better as I'm matter of fact they're
[1:08:32] only going to get worse amen politics is
[1:08:34] not going to get better Republicans
[1:08:36] Democrats Independents liberals concern
[1:08:38] they meant nothing is going to change
[1:08:40] the conditions of this world Amen this
[1:08:43] world has fallen underneath Bible
[1:08:45] prophecy amen the conditions are going
[1:08:48] to get worse then as the conditions get
[1:08:51] worse I believe that that should cause
[1:08:53] the Church of the Living God Amen to be
[1:08:55] looking forward more and more every day
[1:08:58] amen to the Rapture or the catching away
[1:09:00] or the changing of our bodies now you
[1:09:03] know the prophet of God comes in 1965.

[1:09:07] brother Andrew what do you believe about
[1:09:09] the Rapture well I'll tell you it's in a
[1:09:11] tape called The Rapture 1965 Yuma
[1:09:14] Arizona go listen to him you want to
[1:09:16] know what I believe about the Rapture is
[1:09:17] what a prophet taught and he said we

[1:09:21] paragraph 28 We Believe amen there will
[1:09:24] be a Rapture all Christians believe that
[1:09:27] amen that Bible Believers believe there
[1:09:30] will be a rap sure amen how many
[1:09:32] Christians do we have here how many
[1:09:34] Bible Believers in Bible readers amen
[1:09:36] then all Christians believe there's
[1:09:38] going to be a Rapture paragraph 81 if
[1:09:41] there's not a Rapture friends amen then
[1:09:43] where are we at what are we going to do
[1:09:45] what age are we living in amen what
[1:09:48] promise do we have there is going to be
[1:09:51] a Rapture amen you didn't know you was
[1:09:53] going to help me preach but you are I
[1:09:55] mean look at somebody next to you and
[1:09:56] say there's going to be a Rapture amen
[1:09:59] amen there's going to be a Rapture I
[1:10:03] don't care what you're going through I
[1:10:04] don't care what you're facing amen
[1:10:06] there's going to be a Rapture I don't
[1:10:08] care amen what they're doing in the
[1:10:10] white house or what they're doing in
[1:10:11] City Hall amen there's going to be a
[1:10:14] Rapture I don't even care what they're
[1:10:16] doing around the ranks of this message
[1:10:17] and trying to change it amen and water
[1:10:20] it down amen a Bible Prophet has spoken
[1:10:23] there is going to be a Rapture and the
[1:10:26] Bible says there will be and it will
[1:10:28] only be for the elected lady the bride
[1:10:30] in the last last day amen that has been
[1:10:33] pulled out of the church amen then may I
[1:10:35] announce to you this morning that the
[1:10:37] time of the Rapture is at hand amen the
[1:10:40] prophet said a man asked me a few
[1:10:42] moments ago about the coming and the
[1:10:43] Rapture he said we've lived the time out
[1:10:45] the time of the Rapture is at hand and
[1:10:48] we're looking for a rapturing faith that
[1:10:51] can pull the church together and give it
[1:10:53] some Supernatural strength that can
[1:10:56] change these bodies that we live in when
[1:10:58] we see God raised the dead off the floor
[1:11:01] or out of the yard bring him back to
[1:11:03] life again presenting before us when we
[1:11:05] see a God who can take a cancer let's
[1:11:07] eat a man to a shadow and raise him up
[1:11:10] to a strong healthy man that ought to
[1:11:12] give a rap stream Faith to the people he
[1:11:14] said see when that light flashes from
[1:11:16] the sky and the trumpet sounds and the
[1:11:18] body of Christ will click quickly rather
[1:11:20] be gathered together and changed in a
[1:11:23] moment and taken into heaven
[1:11:25] there's got to be something like that
[1:11:27] happen and our schools of theology can
[1:11:30] never produce and I want to emphasize
[1:11:31] that our schools of theology can never
[1:11:34] produce it yet they intellectually are
[1:11:36] right amen but you've got to meet that
[1:11:39] light amen the only thing that can

[1:15:17] claimed your body they meant to perform
[1:15:19] a paradox and it's not going to be a
[1:15:22] paradox of the fishes and Loaves it's
[1:15:24] not going to be a paradox a men of a man
[1:15:27] building an ark and surviving a flood
[1:15:29] it's going to be the greatest Paradox
[1:15:31] that God will take humanity and it'll
[1:15:34] change him back into a glorified
[1:15:35] condition in the moment in the twinkling
[1:15:37] of an eye they said we're living in a
[1:15:40] Dying World Church amen but we have
[1:15:42] heard a voice of life and that voice of
[1:15:44] life amen did not come from this world
[1:15:46] it comes from another world the Bible
[1:15:49] said behold I am alive amen forevermore
[1:15:52] who is that speaking amen that's Jesus
[1:15:54] Revelation 2 8 he said unto the angel of
[1:15:57] the church and some earn to write these
[1:15:58] things saith the first and last which
[1:16:01] was dead and is alive among which was
[1:16:05] dead and is alive I love what the
[1:16:08] prophet says the first thing that
[1:16:10] happens to a man is he is born is alive
[1:16:13] and the last thing that happens is he
[1:16:15] dies so this is not a man speaking this
[1:16:19] is deity now watch First Corinthians 15
[1:16:21] 22 said amen that in the first Adam all
[1:16:24] die in the second Adam which is Christ
[1:16:27] shall all be made alive remember said
[1:16:29] the man Adam took life and turned it
[1:16:32] into death but this man Jesus Took death
[1:16:35] and turned it into life amen Adam took
[1:16:37] innocence and turned it into guilt amen
[1:16:40] but this one took guilt and turned it
[1:16:42] into righteousness Adam took a paradise
[1:16:44] turned it into a waste howling
[1:16:46] Wilderness but this one is coming back
[1:16:48] to turn an earth rocking and reeling
[1:16:49] with destruction into another Eden amen
[1:16:53] notice this this second Adam the prophet
[1:16:55] said and here he is amen he is walking
[1:16:58] in the midst of Those whom he has
[1:17:00] redeemed even his church what are those
[1:17:03] who were redeemed we're not many like
[1:17:05] Paul murderers and corrupters we're not
[1:17:07] many like the dying Thief robbers and
[1:17:09] Men Killers but all are trophies of his
[1:17:12] grace all have been brought back from
[1:17:14] the dead dead amen all are made alive in
[1:17:18] Christ Jesus
[1:17:20] all are made alive in Christ Jesus the
[1:17:23] Lord as the seed of fruit then is in the
[1:17:25] midst of the fruit so is he amen the
[1:17:28] Royal seed in the midst of the church
[1:17:30] amen see he was dead but is alive he
[1:17:33] paid the price the sole ownership of the
[1:17:36] temple of God he rules it he's worship
[1:17:38] tinted and he resends anyone taking over
[1:17:41] his lordship and Authority he said no
[1:17:43] doubt the reason he introduces himself
[1:17:45] to each age as deity is to warn and
[1:17:48] comfort the people he warns the false
[1:17:51] Vine but he Comforts The True Vine he
[1:17:53] said this is the one true almighty God
[1:17:56] Amen hear him and live amen so the first
[1:18:00] Adam amen took amen took a paradise and
[1:18:03] turned it into a waste hell in the
[1:18:04] wilderness amen the first Adam amen took
[1:18:07] health and turned it into sickness
[1:18:08] they've been the first Adam took peace
[1:18:11] and turned it into chaos amen but
[1:18:13] according to the Bible there was a
[1:18:15] second Adam that was coming upon the
[1:18:17] Earth amen now think if the first Adam
[1:18:19] had a first believe amen then the second
[1:18:22] Adam is going to heaven Eve and she's
[1:18:24] not going to be a denomination that's
[1:18:26] going to take the word amen and turn it
[1:18:28] into Creeds and dogmas amen but see for
[1:18:31] the power and the anointing of the
[1:18:33] second Adam is going to turn the screeds
[1:18:35] and dogless amen back to the pure word
[1:18:38] and by that word she's going to take a
[1:18:40] Rapture and by that word she's going to
[1:18:42] change her body listen friends amen
[1:18:45] you're not just citizens of Palm Beach
[1:18:46] County you're not just doctors and
[1:18:48] lawyers hey men and school teachers or
[1:18:50] whatever nurses amen you are the Bride
[1:18:53] of Jesus Christ and the Bible says that
[1:18:55] the wife of God has made herself ready
[1:18:58] you are the Lamb's wife now I'll just
[1:19:01] say it to you like the prophet said we
[1:19:03] know there's going to be a right we know
[1:19:06] there's going to be a bride and there's
[1:19:08] going to be a wedding supper that's
[1:19:10] going to be served in the skies amen see
[1:19:13] and notice this that's just as sure to
[1:19:15] be as God is amen and the bride is going
[1:19:18] to be his church and they're going to
[1:19:20] appear before him without Puerto Rico
[1:19:22] and they have the material Amen on the
[1:19:25] earth now to make themselves ready
[1:19:28] listen we are not sinen amen through
[1:19:31] denominations to find some material to
[1:19:33] prepare us for the change of our body
[1:19:35] amen but when a prophet walked off the
[1:19:38] scene contrary to popular belief he does
[1:19:41] not have to come back and release the
[1:19:43] Revelation that'll change her body when
[1:19:46] he walked off the scene amen he could
[1:19:48] say his tongue said amen I must decrease
[1:19:51] and now he must increase amen then who
[1:19:54] was the increasing in the church it was
[1:19:56] not the personality well I might as well
[1:19:58] preach since I'm here it was not the
[1:20:00] personality of William random and I'm
[1:20:02] just going to go ahead and say it amen
[1:20:04] I'll tell you what we've done around the
[1:20:05] message amen we've made a mockery out of
[1:20:07] things amen we have taken William
[1:20:09] branham's greatest enemy and made the
[1:20:11] biggest Idol out of him than I've ever
[1:20:13] seen you say greatest enemy he said my
[1:20:15] greatest enemy is William Branham we got
[1:20:18] people baptizing in his name we got
[1:20:20] people carrying suitcases like him and
[1:20:22] wearing belt buckles like amen this
[1:20:25] message didn't come they meant to make a
[1:20:26] bunch of man followers amen but this

[1:21:55] hour mean remember so what are they
[1:21:56] getting at is it's God's promise of this
[1:21:59] hour what he promised he would do
[1:22:02] the message of the hour is no more than
[1:22:06] God's Promise by scripture of what he
[1:22:09] said he would do in the hour that you're
[1:22:12] living in then we're living Church in
[1:22:14] the hour of preparation the prophet said
[1:22:17] Noah was working away Not only was he
[1:22:19] performing a miracle but he was looking
[1:22:21] also for a miracle and the church today
[1:22:24] is laboring away under the task of
[1:22:26] preaching the gospel with signs and
[1:22:28] wonders of following they are preparing
[1:22:30] for a miracle among they're preparing
[1:22:33] for a miracle he said what is that it's
[1:22:35] the Rapture of the church and the going
[1:22:38] home amen preparing people getting them
[1:22:41] alive unburdened from the things of the
[1:22:43] world getting their soul set in the
[1:22:46] presence of God that when Jesus does
[1:22:48] appear the second time in glory those
[1:22:50] who are ready will Rapture and be called
[1:22:52] up together to meet him in the air and
[1:22:55] be with him another place he says which
[1:22:57] the Rapture will be an easy thing when
[1:22:59] Jesus comes amen they'll be called up
[1:23:02] but because they believe in such then
[1:23:04] come on Friends amen the Rapture is not
[1:23:07] some it's not something you're working
[1:23:09] yourself into it's not how many books
[1:23:11] can I read how many songs can I sing how
[1:23:14] many tapes can I listen to amen how many
[1:23:16] meetings can I attend I'm on church this
[1:23:18] Rapture is not sure do and amen it's
[1:23:20] your going amen it's God kidnapping you
[1:23:23] it's God snatching you it's God carrying

[1:23:29] and Romeo is on his way and he's gonna
[1:23:31] snatch you away and he's going to take
[1:23:33] you out here what are you saying I'm
[1:23:35] saying Church to Living God there is a
[1:23:37] bride on the Earth today who is not
[1:23:39] working her way in this Rapture but the
[1:23:41] only reason she can shout about going in
[1:23:44] the Rapture is because Grace has made a
[1:23:47] way a man out of sin and out his Creeds
[1:23:49] Grace has made a way for this bride to
[1:23:52] go in this Rapture you ain't gonna work
[1:23:54] yourself into it you ain't gonna shout
[1:23:56] your way into it ain't no man gonna put
[1:23:58] you in it and there ain't no man can
[1:24:00] take you out of it it's the Sovereign
[1:24:02] Grace of almighty God
[1:24:05] it's the hour of adoption the promise
[1:24:07] said this is adoption time he said when
[1:24:09] the church in Christ will become so
[1:24:11] close together till Christ will become
[1:24:13] visible Among Us and he will raise the
[1:24:16] dead and we will go in the rapture
[1:24:20] Christ will become so visible among us
[1:24:23] that he will raise the dead and we will
[1:24:26] go in the Rapture brother Solomon I
[1:24:28] think that's powerful that when Christ
[1:24:30] and the church becomes one now we've got
[1:24:33] a whole message called the Oneness we
[1:24:36] got a whole message called the uniting
[1:24:37] time and the uniting China we got
[1:24:40] another message called United under one
[1:24:42] God right amen this message is a message
[1:24:45] of unity it is a message that is
[1:24:48] dividing you amen from the traditions of
[1:24:51] man and is uniting you with the
[1:24:53] Vindicated word of the Living God I love
[1:24:55] what Paul says he said he is the head of
[1:24:58] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:25:00] amen the firstborn from the dead that in
[1:25:04] all things he might have the preeminence
[1:25:06] somebody say preeminence that in all
[1:25:08] things he might have the preeminence
[1:25:10] remember said Christ the mystery his
[1:25:12] body was not held in the grave amen
[1:25:15] recognized with him in the resurrection
[1:25:17] same as he is now listen which means
[1:25:19] this he his word which he is has begun
[1:25:23] to be risen the word down to the age of
[1:25:26] Luther Wesley C has begun to raise up to
[1:25:28] its power there it began to move he said
[1:25:31] then it moved a little bit more he said
[1:25:33] but now somebody say now but now it's
[1:25:36] coming up to identification do you see
[1:25:39] amen now to the life in the body is a
[1:25:42] Vindication of the Rapture at hand when
[1:25:45] you see the headship and the body
[1:25:47] becoming one and the fullness of the
[1:25:49] measure of his manifestation shows that
[1:25:51] the body is about to be received to the
[1:25:54] headship when you see the life that was
[1:25:57] in the head manifested in the body it is
[1:26:00] a clear-cut Vindication amen that the
[1:26:03] time of the Rapture is at him look
[1:26:06] around I do not see a Corporal physical
[1:26:08] body of Jesus walking through this
[1:26:11] building this morning I don't see a
[1:26:13] corporate body brother Simon with nail
[1:26:15] scars in his hands or crowned The Thorn
[1:26:17] piercings on his head amen but I do see
[1:26:19] a body come on church I do see a body
[1:26:22] and what I see in that body is the same
[1:26:25] thing I've seen in the Corporal body
[1:26:27] when he was walking on the earth he's
[1:26:29] saying a corporate body in a corporate
[1:26:31] body he raised the dead in a corporate
[1:26:33] body he performed Miracles and a
[1:26:35] corporate body he spoke the word listen
[1:26:37] friends the prophet of God said this is
[1:26:39] the mystical Universal body of Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ then whatever was in the headship
[1:26:44] sister Erica was manifested Amen in the
[1:26:47] Corporal body and the same headship has
[1:26:50] come on to a universal body and with a
[1:26:53] hand done then to the body the head is
[1:26:55] to announce to the body the dead are
[1:26:57] being raised Sinners are being saved
[1:27:00] devils are being defeated sicknesses are
[1:27:02] being healed Revelation is taken over
[1:27:04] life you say how can you say that and
[1:27:06] when you see those things it ain't time
[1:27:08] to bury your head it ain't time to start
[1:27:11] following CNN and listening to Fox News
[1:27:13] it's time to lift up your head when you
[1:27:16] see life manifesting to the body it is a
[1:27:19] direct vindication and of warning that
[1:27:22] the Rapture is at hand
[1:27:24] what are you saying I'm saying all that
[1:27:26] was in God he poured into Christ and all
[1:27:29] that was in Christ he has poured into
[1:27:31] the church the prophet said those who
[1:27:34] are dead of the world they are alive in
[1:27:36] him we which are alive those who are
[1:27:39] dead to the world are alive in him and
[1:27:42] they are living in this present day they
[1:27:44] are making the word that God has used
[1:27:46] him for for oh that for ordained them he
[1:27:49] said place them their names in this
[1:27:51] bright book when the waters comes upon
[1:27:54] that seed that's in the heart it'll
[1:27:56] raise it up to be the bride of Christ
[1:27:58] now we've come to The Headstone which is
[1:28:01] the Capstone which is the ministry of
[1:28:03] cerebrum in Zechariah 4 where he says

[1:31:02] morning in a hot building singing about
[1:31:05] the Beauty Land worshiping God I'll tell
[1:31:08] you what that is amen that's not the
[1:31:10] gene of Capers that's not the bloodline
[1:31:12] of Capers amen that is a seed of the
[1:31:15] almighty God that was placed in there
[1:31:17] from before the foundation of the world
[1:31:20] come on Church you know every church
[1:31:22] that's got three kinds of Believers
[1:31:23] right every church has got three kinds
[1:31:26] of Believers there's a make-believer
[1:31:28] there's an unbeliever and there's a real
[1:31:30] genuine believer do you realize inside
[1:31:32] every believer there's three kinds of
[1:31:34] believers
[1:31:35] inside every believer right here there's
[1:31:38] three kinds of Believers amen you gotta
[1:31:40] you got flesh and it's an unbeliever
[1:31:42] your flesh didn't want to get out of bed
[1:31:44] your flesh didn't want to comb its hair
[1:31:46] your flesh didn't want to come to church
[1:31:48] your flesh right now saying it's too hot
[1:31:50] Amen to sit in this building you need to
[1:31:52] go somewhere else amen but then you got
[1:31:54] a spirit and that Spirit to make
[1:31:56] believer if your favorite songs being
[1:31:58] sung you'll be shouting all over the
[1:32:00] place if your favorite preacher's in
[1:32:02] town you'll be on the front row amen but
[1:32:04] if you wake up in the morning and it's a
[1:32:06] bad report amen that spirit will drop in
[1:32:09] the low of lows and you'll say well I
[1:32:11] don't know if I can make it I don't know
[1:32:12] if I can go another day amen but let's
[1:32:14] not talk about the unbeliever and let's
[1:32:16] not talk about the make-believer amen
[1:32:18] but let's go to the real you which a
[1:32:20] prophet said is your soul amen come on
[1:32:22] Church the real you is not your flesh
[1:32:24] the real you is not your spirit the real
[1:32:27] you is your soul that's why you can
[1:32:29] shout when you're in a hospital room
[1:32:31] that's why you can praise God when
[1:32:33] devils are surrounding you it's because
[1:32:35] there's a soul all in there and that
[1:32:37] Soul's got a seed and that seed is a
[1:32:39] dermatized seed and that seed don't know
[1:32:42] the word quits that seed don't know the
[1:32:44] word turn around that seed has been
[1:32:46] ordained and predestinated and set in
[1:32:48] direction for Rapture I say a house of
[1:32:50] hell you might as well give way you
[1:32:53] ain't gonna stop us you can try next
[1:32:55] year we'll still be here you can try two
[1:32:57] years from now and we'll still be here
[1:32:59] because greater is he that is in us than
[1:33:02] he that is in the world
[1:33:05] crazy man there's a force there's a
[1:33:08] driving force when I don't feel like
[1:33:10] preaching I preach anyhow when I don't
[1:33:12] feel like singing I sing anyhow when I
[1:33:15] don't feel like worshiping I break out
[1:33:17] right in the devil's face and I worship
[1:33:19] anyhow because I'm not a flesh Christian
[1:33:22] I'm not just a spirit Christian I'm a
[1:33:25] soul Christian
[1:33:27] I love him for my soul I sing for my
[1:33:30] soul I preach for my soul I believe from
[1:33:33] my soul I'm gonna take a Rapture from my
[1:33:36] soul

[1:33:43] door and kick that devil out we're not
[1:33:45] here on feelings we're not here on
[1:33:47] Sensations
[1:33:51] we're soul Christians
[1:33:55] there's a soul in you
[1:33:57] that flesh is giving you every reason to
[1:33:59] quit
[1:34:00] but you're still here
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:03] [Applause]
[1:34:04] hormones hurt I never hate you brother
[1:34:06] Troy that devil hates you you know why
[1:34:09] because you stayed under the anointing
[1:34:11] long enough that the anointing has baked
[1:34:14] all the greenness it's baked all the
[1:34:16] immaturity out and now there's a mature
[1:34:18] manifested Son of God I'm on Church you
[1:34:21] know what I'm talking about if you can
[1:34:23] stay under this anointing it'll bake all
[1:34:25] the immaturities out of you come on some
[1:34:27] of y'all are here and you're not here
[1:34:29] because you've got your favorite seat
[1:34:31] you're not here because you got your
[1:34:33] favorite parking spot come on but you're
[1:34:35] here because you're a worshiper
[1:34:38] you're a worshiper in the good times you
[1:34:41] worship God in the bad times you worship
[1:34:44] God come on sister Amen in the times
[1:34:46] when there ain't nothing you'll stand
[1:34:48] right up and say I'm still amen pressing
[1:34:51] my battle you're not pressing your
[1:34:52] battle from your flesh you're not
[1:34:54] pressing your battle amen from all the
[1:34:56] things of life you're pressing the
[1:34:58] battle from your soul and you're looking
[1:35:00] at Devil's Square in the face that devil
[1:35:02] says I'm gonna get you I'm going to get
[1:35:04] you I'm gonna get you in my immaturity
[1:35:06] since you know what I done I got scared
[1:35:08] and run back and said well maybe he's
[1:35:10] going to get me but I've laid under the
[1:35:12] anointing of a son of man long enough
[1:35:14] that when the devil says it now I swear
[1:35:17] my shoulders back and say devil if you
[1:35:19] was going to get me you should have got
[1:35:20] me when you had a chance if you was
[1:35:22] going to kill me you should have killed
[1:35:24] me when you had a chance if you was
[1:35:25] going to take my family out of the
[1:35:27] Redemption plan of almighty God you
[1:35:30] should have done it when you had a
[1:35:31] chance but the gene seed of God on the
[1:35:34] inside of you amen was stronger than the
[1:35:36] devil against you
[1:35:38] all right
[1:35:39] that devil ain't got you now he ain't
[1:35:42] ever gonna get you
[1:35:47] or say the deity in you
[1:35:49] saying I'm saying there's a seed of
[1:35:51] rapture in you the life is laying in the
[1:35:53] sea
[1:35:59] well that old depression devil don't
[1:36:00] want me to preach so it shouldn't have
[1:36:01] push back against me we're still here
[1:36:03] and we're still standing and we ain't
[1:36:06] going nowhere
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:09] we ain't going nowhere amen send us the
[1:36:11] back way and wreck our plane red plane
[1:36:13] directions wreck everything we'll fly
[1:36:15] here and there but we'll stand there and
[1:36:17] preach this message amen take our bills
[1:36:20] and we'll gather in a school room and
[1:36:22] we'll shout and sing until the Holy
[1:36:24] Ghost breaks out on the people this is
[1:36:26] not a church Revival this is not a
[1:36:28] temporary painful this is not a feeling
[1:36:30] Revival it's a word Revival
[1:36:33] then wherever you are brother Capers I
[1:36:36] think we ought to print up some T-shirts
[1:36:38] that says wherever I'm at there's a
[1:36:40] potential for a Revival to break out
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:43] wherever I go wherever I be there is a
[1:36:47] potential that the Holy Ghost might
[1:36:49] break out and discern the thoughts and
[1:36:51] intents of the heart and change the
[1:36:53] outcome of a situation you say how can
[1:36:55] you say that amen because I might not
[1:36:57] just swing in the Billy stick and
[1:36:59] somebody say where is Laurel's Revival
[1:37:00] where is the worst Revival I can point
[1:37:03] to myself
[1:37:04] you're looking at someone else Revival
[1:37:07] they say where's the bride's Revival
[1:37:09] where's the bride's Revival is it in
[1:37:11] Jeffersonville is it in the desert is it
[1:37:13] in Tucson it's here
[1:37:16] in West Palm Beach Florida the bride's
[1:37:19] Revival amen is thundering seven
[1:37:21] Thunders it's ringing out Seven Seals
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:27] hallelujah
[1:37:29] it's a season of deity in the church we
[1:37:32] are still here therefore
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] I can't get away from this thought y'all
[1:37:39] remember how it used to be y'all
[1:37:41] remember in our immaturity when the
[1:37:43] devil through something matters we got
[1:37:44] all scared and backed up and said oh no
[1:37:46] I don't know what to do
[1:37:48] but now in our maturity when the devil
[1:37:51] foes something at us we go over and pick
[1:37:52] it up and throw it back say is that the
[1:37:53] best you got
[1:37:55] is that the best you got amen amen is
[1:37:58] that the best you got well we're going
[1:37:59] to take your bill we're going to raise
[1:38:00] the rent amen we just picked it up and
[1:38:02] threw it back said is that the best you
[1:38:04] got amen we're not serving God because
[1:38:06] of a building we're serving God because
[1:38:08] of the word that has been released in
[1:38:10] the age that we're living in
[1:38:12] there's a seed on the inside of you it
[1:38:15] is a seed of rapture therefore the bride
[1:38:17] this morning is preparing for this
[1:38:19] Rapture by the appearing of the Lord he
[1:38:22] said the appearing is different from his
[1:38:24] coming he said the appearing is Luke 17
[1:38:27] 30. it's getting them ready for the
[1:38:30] Rapture for the coming of the Lord see
[1:38:34] when you see his appearing it is
[1:38:36] preparation for his coming
[1:38:39] when you see his appearing it is the
[1:38:42] preparation for his coming see this is
[1:38:45] the day because there may not be a
[1:38:46] tomorrow so what are we doing we are
[1:38:48] living in the expectations of the soon
[1:38:52] coming of the Blessed Lord then the
[1:38:54] prophet of God will sit like this this
[1:38:56] is the time that these things ought to
[1:38:58] be preached now people say to me brother
[1:39:00] Andrew why are you preaching the
[1:39:02] revelation of this message well I said
[1:39:04] like this if there's ever been a time to
[1:39:06] preach it now's the time to do it
[1:39:10] right now's the time Amen to say I was
[1:39:14] preaching the Church of the day brother
[1:39:15] Jack and I walked out and the guy met me
[1:39:17] at the back door he said well there's
[1:39:18] two things I can say about you when you
[1:39:20] come by here I said what's that he said
[1:39:22] well the first thing you're going to do
[1:39:23] is you're going to tell us where the
[1:39:24] bride he said in the second thing you're
[1:39:26] going to do is you're going to tell us
[1:39:27] what brother Brown said now he probably
[1:39:28] thought that'd be a little bit of a
[1:39:29] shame to me but actually it was a
[1:39:30] compliment
[1:39:32] because the first ever been a time to
[1:39:34] tell the people who they are Now's the
[1:39:35] Time to do it and if there's ever been a
[1:39:37] time to say what a word Prophet said
[1:39:39] about you
[1:39:41] well I'm here I might as well preach
[1:39:44] that that's why I don't understand
[1:39:45] people say well Amy we need to set all
[1:39:47] the ministry down and just play tapes we
[1:39:49] need to quieten the ministry I'll Grant
[1:39:51] it to you amen that 70 years ago half
[1:39:54] the sermons probably weren't less worth
[1:39:55] listening to a bunch of nonsense a bunch
[1:39:58] of confusion amen but right now there's
[1:40:00] a Ministry on the earth and for the
[1:40:02] first time they've actually got
[1:40:03] something to say and they want him to
[1:40:05] quit preaching
[1:40:08] well it's the truth in how you can like
[1:40:10] it whatever it's the truth and now they
[1:40:12] want you amen but I say if there's ever
[1:40:14] been a time to lay in what a prophet
[1:40:16] said listen if you ain't going to say
[1:40:17] what a prophet said then I agree take
[1:40:19] your preacher coat off and go flip
[1:40:21] hamburgers amen but if you're going to
[1:40:22] say what a prophet saying take the
[1:40:24] gloves off get rid of the panty ways and
[1:40:27] stand with the prophet of God in the
[1:40:28] face of every opposite hell glory to God
[1:40:31] it's the truth amen but I'll tell you
[1:40:34] what we got I might as well preach that
[1:40:35] got a bunch of 65 preachers that don't
[1:40:38] have a backbone anymore to stand with a
[1:40:40] prophet so it's a lot easier to put a
[1:40:42] tape player in the pulpit and let
[1:40:43] brother Brandon preach against
[1:40:45] televisions and let brother Brandon
[1:40:46] preach against makeup and let brother
[1:40:48] Brandon preach against high heel shoes
[1:40:49] and let brother Brown preach against
[1:40:51] boys wearing shorts it's a lot easier to
[1:40:53] put a tape player in there because you
[1:40:55] don't have to bear the heat remember if
[1:40:57] you was a real man of God you would
[1:40:58] stand with a prophet if it shook the
[1:41:01] height off of somebody you would stand
[1:41:02] with what a prophet said and say that
[1:41:04] ain't nothing but the truth and this
[1:41:06] church stands with it this family stands
[1:41:09] with it this preacher stand oh better
[1:41:11] get out of here David I got a sword in
[1:41:13] my hand I think it's time we stand with
[1:41:15] the message of the hour regardless of
[1:41:17] what it cost us
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:21] I say thank God for men of God like
[1:41:23] right here in this church that are
[1:41:24] standing with this message
[1:41:30] Mighty shout out
[1:41:32] ouch
[1:41:32] me amen
[1:41:35] it's the truth anyhow first ever been a
[1:41:38] time to say it now it's the time to say
[1:41:39] it because as I said before the prophet
[1:41:42] said the Rapture could happen before
[1:41:43] this service ends in other words brother
[1:41:46] Steve we are on the verge of the Rapture
[1:41:48] now you know what that word on the verge
[1:41:50] means to means it means close to on the
[1:41:53] brink of the term uses the Verge in the
[1:41:56] sense of the brink or the border of
[1:41:58] something now the problem of God telling
[1:42:00] you it could happen before this service
[1:42:03] is over and and Brass serpent 1953 I
[1:42:06] believe that we're just on the verge
[1:42:08] Lord of one of the greatest sakings that
[1:42:11] the world has ever received and will all
[1:42:13] say Amen to that Thurston for Life 58
[1:42:16] this Nation's on the verge of going into
[1:42:18] ashes at any minute
[1:42:21] right now and it could happen before
[1:42:24] morning
[1:42:25] Church we're 57 years since a prophet
[1:42:29] went off the scene
[1:42:30] seven major Visions 1933 amen six of the
[1:42:34] seven has been fulfilled come on Church
[1:42:37] the seventh one was I saw America as one
[1:42:40] big crater amen smoldering with ashes
[1:42:42] and listen we say Amen that could happen
[1:42:45] before morning then why can't we say
[1:42:47] Amen that before this service is
[1:42:49] dismissed this meeting in this church
[1:42:51] could turn into the meeting in the air
[1:42:54] now I'll say it like this on the verge
[1:42:57] amen means to go forward or to go
[1:42:59] backward if you're on the verge of
[1:43:01] something you're on the verge of going
[1:43:03] forward or you're on the verge of going
[1:43:04] backward according to Paul there are
[1:43:07] some who are on the verge of going back
[1:43:08] under Perdition but also according to
[1:43:10] Paul there are some amen who is on the
[1:43:13] verge of going on unto Perfection look
[1:43:15] at this word Perfection it means
[1:43:17] finisher one who has in his own person
[1:43:20] raised Faith to its Perfection see then
[1:43:23] I ask you the question amen here we are
[1:43:25] we're in 2023 amen the seals have been
[1:43:28] opened the word is in the bride the
[1:43:30] Revelation has come where do we go from
[1:43:33] here where do we go from here the
[1:43:36] prophet said we want to know where we go
[1:43:38] from here let's take the only book that
[1:43:40] can tell us the only book that can tell
[1:43:43] us where we go from here is the Bible
[1:43:45] the book of redemption the prophet of
[1:43:48] God called it a road map amen from the
[1:43:50] Cradle to the Grave he would say how can
[1:43:52] you have a map amen now watch this you
[1:43:54] can have a map and still go in circles
[1:43:57] without a god
[1:44:01] now I know some of us young people here
[1:44:03] probably have a hard time believing it
[1:44:04] but at one time they didn't have GPS
[1:44:06] cell phones to get from here to there
[1:44:09] at one time you actually had to stop go
[1:44:12] in a store buy an atlas
[1:44:15] come on Church go in there get it
[1:44:17] brother Smiley's Pizza with me amen go I
[1:44:20] remember one time we was on a trip years
[1:44:22] ago I was just a little kid I remember
[1:44:23] we got we was going somewhere I can't
[1:44:25] remember but I remember we was on a back
[1:44:27] road and we found a little gas station
[1:44:28] brother Capers my grandmother she went
[1:44:30] there and she got an atlas she brought
[1:44:32] that Atlas out I remember we sat there
[1:44:34] for a few minutes she flipped through it
[1:44:35] flipped flip through it amen she finally
[1:44:37] got up and went inside and said where am
[1:44:38] I at
[1:44:40] see you can have an atlas but if you
[1:44:42] don't have a God then you'll still be
[1:44:44] going in circles and for 2 000 years we
[1:44:47] had the Bible but we did not have a
[1:44:50] guide to tell us where we was had we had
[1:44:52] preachers placing Us in all seven
[1:44:53] Gentile ages we had them saying we're
[1:44:56] here and we're there but according to
[1:44:58] John 16 13 when he the spirit of Truth
[1:45:01] is come he will guide you into all truth
[1:45:04] the prophet said in other words he will
[1:45:06] be the one that will reveal the thing
[1:45:09] you see so you're looking at the map but
[1:45:12] you don't know where you're at but the
[1:45:14] God shall descend into the church and he
[1:45:16] shall take the map and he shall say
[1:45:18] here's where you are you are in the
[1:45:20] revelation of third chapter you're in
[1:45:22] the layout of sin age your seventh star
[1:45:24] is the star of Malachi 4 it's the star
[1:45:27] of Revelation 10 7 it's the messenger
[1:45:29] it's rubable Amen this is where you are
[1:45:31] now listen you're not going back to
[1:45:33] Luther's day you're not going back to us
[1:45:35] this day but I have clearly identified
[1:45:37] where you are and your next step is
[1:45:40] rapture
[1:45:42] well I feel like shouting right now your
[1:45:45] next step is the rapture so then he
[1:45:48] would come along and say now I'm going
[1:45:50] to preach to you on the Seven Seals
[1:45:54] right can I take some Liberty here in
[1:45:56] the seventh seal open in paragraph 43 he
[1:45:58] says now heavenly father as this goes
[1:46:01] forward now to preach or to teach on
[1:46:04] this Great Mighty event that's taking
[1:46:05] place in glory some 2000 years ago and
[1:46:08] was given to the great beloved Apostle
[1:46:09] John and tonight we're to speak upon it
[1:46:13] you ready for this let the Holy Spirit
[1:46:15] Come forward now in his mighty power of
[1:46:19] Revelation that he might reveal to us
[1:46:21] that thing which he wants us to know
[1:46:24] he might reveal to us the thing that he
[1:46:27] wants us to know he said as he has in
[1:46:30] the last few nights now you always throw
[1:46:32] the message no you can go to your seven
[1:46:34] seal tapes you can listen to the first
[1:46:36] to The Sixth Seal and hear them come to
[1:46:38] a point and say Here's my revelation of
[1:46:41] it like the first seal he'll say now
[1:46:43] here my Revelation it's the Antichrist
[1:46:45] Spirit seconds he'll hear amen but you
[1:46:48] come to the seventh seal and the proud
[1:46:50] of God says here is my revelation of it
[1:46:52] and starts talking about his own
[1:46:53] Ministry
[1:46:55] and so you say well I thought it was
[1:46:57] going to be a revelation of the seventh
[1:46:59] seal so you go back and listen again and
[1:47:01] you come back to the same point here's

[1:47:17] ministry amen do you realize amen that
[1:47:20] the seventh seal amen was the ministry
[1:47:22] of the seventh angel which was the
[1:47:24] Fulfillment of Luke 17 30 which was the
[1:47:27] preparing of the Lord the preparation
[1:47:30] for the bride listen friends amen I this

[1:47:48] already opened the prophet said when
[1:47:51] that sword come in my hand he said it
[1:47:53] was I was so inspired and I was so
[1:47:55] directed listen people say well someday
[1:47:57] brother Jack the book will be open
[1:47:58] according to a prophet who would dare
[1:48:01] say that wasn't the inspired word of God
[1:48:03] when he foretold it here and sent out
[1:48:06] yonder to Arizona brought it right back
[1:48:08] even with science everything else
[1:48:09] improved it so this book is already
[1:48:12] opened that's right now watch this just
[1:48:15] waiting for the seventh seal to be
[1:48:18] identified of the coming of Christ or
[1:48:20] the Capers he did not say waiting for
[1:48:22] the seven seal to be open he said
[1:48:24] waiting for the seventh seal to be
[1:48:26] identified amen which is the coming of
[1:48:29] the Lord now you know it'll start
[1:48:31] talking about three pools right and he
[1:48:33] will identify what those three pools are
[1:48:35] I'm preaching you the Rapture he will
[1:48:37] identify the first pool was healing he
[1:48:40] will identify the second at Paul was
[1:48:41] prophesied he will identify the third
[1:48:43] pool amen was the revealing of the word
[1:48:46] or the opening of the word and he will
[1:48:48] say remember the third poor was the
[1:48:51] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[1:48:53] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[1:48:56] the word no higher order to reveal it
[1:48:59] than a prophet now we talked about three
[1:49:01] kinds of Believers right in every Church
[1:49:03] believer unbeliever make believer do you
[1:49:05] realize that those three pools amen can
[1:49:07] actually be taught back to a prophet
[1:49:08] saying that you are a Triune being you
[1:49:11] are a body Soul and Spirit right amen
[1:49:13] that first pool was dealing with your
[1:49:15] flesh the healing of your body that
[1:49:18] second pull was the discernment of what
[1:49:20] was laying in your spirit that was
[1:49:21] causing the Affliction in your body but
[1:49:23] when you come to that third pull it was
[1:49:25] the reveal and not of the heart of the
[1:49:27] church but the revealing of the Heart of
[1:49:30] Jesus Christ amen of the back part of
[1:49:32] God's mind come on church amen we're not
[1:49:34] just the first bullbride we're not just
[1:49:37] a second pool bride amen but the first
[1:49:39] ever been a time to preach the Third or
[1:49:41] amen you are a third poor bride with a
[1:49:44] third puller 19 with a third pool power
[1:49:47] program said like this amen can I just
[1:49:50] take some Liberty they said everyone
[1:49:52] knows that amen the first one was
[1:49:53] identified second been identified and if
[1:49:56] you'll think you're closer you who are
[1:49:57] spiritual here he is the third is
[1:49:59] properly identified sea we know where it
[1:50:02] is the third pool is here
[1:50:06] the third pull is here uh oh my I never
[1:50:10] one time right when I first started
[1:50:12] preaching out on the field of traveling
[1:50:13] I was preaching out of the message is
[1:50:15] this a sign of the answer and in that
[1:50:16] date remember says these words he said
[1:50:18] is this that third poor he said they
[1:50:20] will bring the power of Christ back in
[1:50:22] the church he said you draw your own
[1:50:24] conclusion for the Capers I sit in my my
[1:50:26] room as a young boy studied and when I
[1:50:28] heard that something just surged through
[1:50:30] my body and I said it's that brother
[1:50:32] Branham and when I said that there was a
[1:50:34] power dropped in my heart amen people
[1:50:36] say well we want the power of God in the
[1:50:38] church amen listen the power of God can
[1:50:41] only come by God's provided way and
[1:50:43] God's provided way of ushering the power
[1:50:46] back in the church was not fancy
[1:50:48] footwork it was not fancy Keys it was
[1:50:51] not good music it was not well-dressed
[1:50:53] pliers it was the revealing of the word
[1:50:55] would be the road
[1:50:58] would be God's provided way to Usher the
[1:51:02] power of the Resurrection back into the
[1:51:04] church he said that watch the third pull
[1:51:06] then see amen will be absolutely to the
[1:51:09] total loss but it'll be for the bride
[1:51:11] amen and the church right there you can
[1:51:13] back every devil up and say Amen the
[1:51:16] third pool is to the total loss but it's
[1:51:18] for the bride it's to the total loss but
[1:51:21] it's for the bride I'm on Church who is
[1:51:24] the bride she is the rapture elect lady
[1:51:27] that third pull is your pull
[1:51:30] program said what is that seventh seal
[1:51:33] it was the coming of the Lord Matthew 24
[1:51:36] 36 at that day I'm going somewhere stay
[1:51:38] with me no man knoweth no not the angels
[1:51:40] of heaven but my father only first heal
[1:51:42] he says don't go down John and say now
[1:51:44] this is just what it is now what's under
[1:51:46] this seventh seal don't go down and tell
[1:51:49] that for if I tell John that then all
[1:51:51] down to the age the whole plan will be
[1:51:54] broke it's a secret
[1:51:57] if you want to study that you can go to
[1:51:58] sudden secret go in the way of the
[1:52:00] church 1958 and Jeffersonville retitles
[1:52:03] it the sudden secret going away the
[1:52:04] church but if you look underneath that
[1:52:06] title it says secret rapture
[1:52:10] oh God is this okay it'll be a secret he
[1:52:15] said nobody's gonna know when I'm coming
[1:52:16] I'm just coming see that's all it ain't
[1:52:19] for my business to know when I'll just
[1:52:22] be ready now I know since the seven
[1:52:24] chills come we've had all kinds of
[1:52:26] teachings we've had all kinds of
[1:52:27] doctrines all kinds of ideas but a few
[1:52:29] months ago I actually went through the
[1:52:31] seventh seal and actually began to find
[1:52:33] prophetic instructions when the
[1:52:35] revelation of the seventh seal was
[1:52:37] released to the church I found the
[1:52:39] prophet say this so paragraph 322 so the
[1:52:42] thing for you to do is remember that I
[1:52:45] speak to you in the name of the Lord be
[1:52:47] prepared for you don't know what time
[1:52:49] something can happen paragraph 390 he
[1:52:52] stops and says now do you notice on the
[1:52:55] opening of the seventh seal it's also in
[1:52:57] a threefold mystery now it's in a
[1:53:00] free-fold mystery okay now we can go to
[1:53:02] Christ the mystery of God how was that
[1:53:05] revealed in a threefold manner the first
[1:53:07] fold was he will reveal himself the
[1:53:10] second fold is he will take preeminence
[1:53:12] in the body by the revelation of himself
[1:53:15] and the third fold was amen by the
[1:53:17] revelation of himself having preeminence
[1:53:19] in a body he will lead a bright church
[1:53:22] amen back into the Garden of Eden
[1:53:24] condition again what are you saying I'm
[1:53:26] saying you can go to first Thessalonians
[1:53:28] 4 which the prophet preaches in the
[1:53:30] Rapture tape and says now here's the
[1:53:32] revelation of the Rapture the Lord
[1:53:34] himself shout his sin from heaven with a
[1:53:37] shout he said what is the shout it's the
[1:53:39] message it's the living bread bringing
[1:53:41] forth the bride he said then the voice
[1:53:43] what is the voice it's the voice of
[1:53:45] Resurrection the same voice that called
[1:53:47] Lazarus from the grave he said in the
[1:53:49] third part of the Rapture will be the
[1:53:51] trumpet which will gather the Bride As
[1:53:53] the marriage supper of the Lamb listen
[1:53:55] friends you cannot argue with this
[1:53:57] message you cannot argue with this
[1:53:58] Prophet among people say well brother
[1:54:00] Andrew don't stop there okay let's go to
[1:54:02] Revelation 10 shall we the seventh seal
[1:54:04] will be revealed in a threefold mystery
[1:54:06] he said watch he said Revelation 10 is
[1:54:09] the seventh seal do you realize in
[1:54:11] Revelation 10 there's three parts
[1:54:13] there's Revelation 10 1 which is the
[1:54:16] mighty Angel descending with an open
[1:54:17] book amen there's a second part which is
[1:54:20] revelation 10 7 which is an Earthly
[1:54:22] Angel receiving the open book from the
[1:54:24] mighty Angel but some people just stop
[1:54:27] there but let's not stop at the same
[1:54:29] thing so let's go to Revelation 10 8
[1:54:31] there was a man there named John who a
[1:54:34] prophet identified was a type of the
[1:54:36] bride and he said John said give me that
[1:54:38] book right there in Revelation 10 amen
[1:54:41] there's a mighty Angel there's a seventh
[1:54:43] angel and there's a bride receiving the
[1:54:46] Revelation which is putting her in
[1:54:48] condition to change her body
[1:54:52] her bones Church there's not a bride
[1:54:54] looking for the Revelation I predict I
[1:54:57] propose to you this morning you are in
[1:54:59] possession of the Revelation that'll
[1:55:02] change your body come on Amen you want
[1:55:04] to know how quick it's going to happen
[1:55:05] heard me remember to say this morning he
[1:55:07] said twinkle your eye he said just tweak
[1:55:09] their eye he said that's how fast amen
[1:55:12] the Rapture will take place well if
[1:55:14] we're waiting for a tent and we're
[1:55:16] waiting for an airplane and we're
[1:55:17] waiting for some brother Branham to come
[1:55:19] ride a white horse out of the West amen
[1:55:21] you cannot blink your eyes and all three
[1:55:23] of them things happen in the blink of an
[1:55:25] eye but I can prove by infallible proof
[1:55:27] in the word of God and I can blink my
[1:55:30] eye and when I open my eye you can have
[1:55:32] black hair again when I open my eye I
[1:55:35] could see my loved ones
[1:55:39] we're not looking for the Revelation
[1:55:42] we're in possession of it
[1:55:46] or are you saying I'm saying prophetic
[1:55:48] instruction from the seventh seal
[1:55:49] paragraph he says here paragraph 399
[1:55:51] when he opened it see he omitted it
[1:55:54] again he said but now until that time
[1:55:56] let's just all pray and live good
[1:55:58] straight Christian lives looking forward
[1:56:00] for his coming paragraph 400 and now if
[1:56:04] this tape would happen to fall into the
[1:56:06] hands of some person somewhere don't try
[1:56:08] to make an ism out of it the only thing
[1:56:11] you do is just continue serving God
[1:56:15] yeah
[1:56:17] I feel the preacher coming on don't try
[1:56:20] to make an earsom out of it you just
[1:56:22] continue serving God you say what are
[1:56:25] you saying I'm saying amen that the
[1:56:27] prophet said there's a symphony taking
[1:56:29] place do you realize what a symphony is
[1:56:31] it's composed in four major movements
[1:56:35] four mate can I am I going too long do
[1:56:38] you have a time limit
[1:56:40] four
[1:56:42] four major movements I'm gonna hurry
[1:56:46] Luther Wesley Pentecost but you come the
[1:56:50] fourth one which was what was the Life
[1:56:52] coming in the body the prophet said then
[1:56:54] what's the next thing people say well
[1:56:56] the next thing is there's going to be a
[1:56:57] squeeze well the next thing is there's
[1:56:58] going to be a tent well the next thing
[1:57:00] is there's got to be a Horse Ride well
[1:57:01] the next thing is going to come back and
[1:57:03] go around the world and preach the
[1:57:04] Revelation but according to a prophet
[1:57:06] the next thing is a change
[1:57:10] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:57:13] we'll have to have a changed body the
[1:57:16] next thing in order for the church now
[1:57:18] is a changed body right he meant us old
[1:57:21] people go back and be young so much in
[1:57:23] the whole but we will and we will be
[1:57:25] there but we got to have a changed body
[1:57:27] in order to receive the sun we're going
[1:57:29] to meet him in the air amen Rapture will
[1:57:31] come a change in a moment in a twinkling
[1:57:34] of an eye then what does brother bam use
[1:57:37] for his opening text I know I slowed
[1:57:38] down here but I'm laying some word in in
[1:57:40] his opening text for the Rapture he
[1:57:43] reads psalms 27 right
[1:57:45] right and says this he says in the time
[1:57:48] of trouble shall he hide me in his
[1:57:50] Pavilion go look at that word Pavilion
[1:57:52] in the secret place of his Tabernacle
[1:57:54] shall he hide me amen he shall set me
[1:57:56] upon a Rock Amen what is a rock a rock
[1:58:00] is a revelation amen if you study psalms
[1:58:03] 27 5 you will find the word tent in
[1:58:06] Psalms 27 so if you want to preach a
[1:58:08] tent let's preach at the way a prophet
[1:58:10] preached it he said he will be in his
[1:58:13] tent come on church where is his tent

[1:58:23] of the tent of the third pull

[1:58:29] this Trail again and a lot of I I pray
[1:58:31] this is okay a lot of guys have stopped
[1:58:33] right there but they never turn the
[1:58:35] corner with a prophet when he said she
[1:58:38] will ride this Trail again who is that
[1:58:41] she that she is the Bride of Jesus
[1:58:43] Christ who is going to ride this Trail
[1:58:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ what do you

[1:58:50] your pity party get off of your ass Heap

[1:58:54] get on this word and draw your sword and
[1:58:57] ride that devil down and cut that
[1:58:59] devil's head off you are in position
[1:59:01] this morning by the Revelation to do
[1:59:03] such
[1:59:05] the true bride he says we'll be waiting
[1:59:07] for oh God I'm stepping over so much the
[1:59:10] true bride will be waiting for the
[1:59:11] Rapture revelation we are now in
[1:59:14] possession of the Rapture Revelation
[1:59:17] first Thessalonians 4 15 then we which
[1:59:19] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:59:22] the Lord verse 17 we which are alive
[1:59:25] this word alive means can I preach a
[1:59:27] little bit here in closing to be among
[1:59:29] the living
[1:59:30] not lifeless and not dead to enjoy real
[1:59:33] life to have true life and worthy of the
[1:59:36] name to be active to be blessed endless
[1:59:38] in the kingdom of God I love this part
[1:59:40] brother Smiley to be in full Vigor to be
[1:59:43] fresh to be strong to be efficient oh

[1:59:50] raptures right he said now we which are
[1:59:53] alive and remain that's the bodies that
[1:59:56] are left on Earth

[2:00:20] of God and I took these pictures amen
[2:00:23] these are actually brother branham's
[2:00:24] notes on the Rapture if you ever seen it
[2:00:26] it's a powerful thing look at brother
[2:00:28] Jack I look at them notes and think man
[2:00:30] he preached that with just a few pages
[2:00:32] go the second page
[2:00:34] go to the third page you see here go to
[2:00:37] the fourth page then the fifth page see
[2:00:39] that was a prophet's notes on the
[2:00:41] Rapture if you can go back to the second
[2:00:43] one I'd appreciate it in the second one
[2:00:45] here he says now he says uh one more Yep
[2:00:49] there now the Rapture is only for the
[2:00:51] bride church I was looking at this
[2:00:52] brother Jack and it come out at me the
[2:00:55] elected ones in him from the beginning
[2:00:58] father spiritual genes which are
[2:01:00] attributes I got to look at this point
[2:01:02] right here he says now how do we get in
[2:01:06] him or come alive to it
[2:01:10] how do we get into him if you can leave
[2:01:12] that there how do we get into him or how
[2:01:15] do we come alive to it that's the same
[2:01:18] word that Paul is using in first
[2:01:20] Thessalonians 4 that we which are alive
[2:01:23] and remain which will be bodies on the
[2:01:26] earth will be called up amen and then
[2:01:28] the prophet in the Rapture tape says do
[2:01:30] you know there's only one term of the
[2:01:33] millions moving around that's ordained
[2:01:35] and there's only one egg that's fertile
[2:01:37] in the beginning way back before there
[2:01:39] was a time if you were a born-again
[2:01:41] Christian tonight you were in God being
[2:01:43] that's why you come in this life here
[2:01:44] and profess Christianity everything
[2:01:46] wrong you've wondered why this and all
[2:01:49] this and it's wandered at you but one
[2:01:51] day something struck you

[2:02:04] made you desired in the first place
[2:02:06] because down in your soul there was a
[2:02:09] predestinated seed which was eternal
[2:02:12] life it was always laying in the air it
[2:02:14] always was in there another paragraph
[2:02:16] what is it it's the germ seed word from

[2:02:50] people that's for ordained of God to be
[2:02:53] in the Rapture oh my then what is it
[2:02:56] it's the quickening power of the Holy
[2:02:59] Ghost it's the revelation of the message
[2:03:02] of the hour it's the appearing of the
[2:03:04] hormone church amen what did he say we

[2:04:29] in heaven today we are glorified in the
[2:04:31] presence of God we are just pushing out
[2:04:34] to it

[2:04:39] Vigor to be fresh to be strong so
[2:04:42] according to Paul and brother Branham
[2:04:43] there will be bodies on the earth that
[2:04:45] will be full of vigor they will be fresh
[2:04:48] they will be strong
[2:04:51] how many years ago was this 57 years
[2:04:53] since the Rapture was preached
[2:04:57] now how can I talk about being alive and
[2:04:59] fresh and not talk about a man named
[2:05:01] Caleb
[2:05:04] Caleb for 80 years had been waiting for
[2:05:07] his mountain and brother Capers when it
[2:05:10] come time for him to take his Mountain I
[2:05:13] love what the Book of Joshua says Caleb
[2:05:15] looked at all of them and said listen
[2:05:17] your negative report is enough
[2:05:20] Caleb got tired of all the negative talk
[2:05:23] come on Spirit true Tabernacle if you're
[2:05:25] going to be alive and going to remain
[2:05:27] and going to be fresh and going to be
[2:05:28] full of vigor and going to be efficient
[2:05:30] and going to be strong you got to quit
[2:05:32] all the negative talk
[2:05:36] come on Amen that be that'd be like you
[2:05:38] sitting there amen talking about taking
[2:05:40] your kids on vacation and all the things
[2:05:42] you're going to do all the places you're
[2:05:44] going to eat all the good things you're
[2:05:46] going to see and then stop right in the
[2:05:47] middle and say I need to make my funeral
[2:05:49] plans before we go
[2:05:50] what kind of damper does that put on the
[2:05:53] expectation that's why amen we're not
[2:05:56] talking about the grave
[2:05:59] the grave is not our goal the sky is our
[2:06:02] goal Caleb stood there I love this
[2:06:04] brother brother Solomon he's standing
[2:06:06] there look at this mountain and they've
[2:06:07] got all these negative reports and Caleb
[2:06:10] speaks up and says these words now
[2:06:12] behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he
[2:06:16] said these 40 and five years even since
[2:06:18] the Lord spake this word into Moses amen
[2:06:20] the children of Israel wandered in the
[2:06:21] wilderness now lo I am missed a four
[2:06:23] score and five years old brother Jackie
[2:06:26] says this but yet I am as strong this
[2:06:29] day as I was in the days that William
[2:06:32] Branham preached the Revelation I'm as
[2:06:35] strong today as I was in the days Moses
[2:06:38] sent it he has preserved me for a Time
[2:06:41] such as this what are you saying I'm
[2:06:43] saying Church lift up your heads get rid
[2:06:46] of the negative talk get rid of well I'm
[2:06:48] not gonna make it and I'm not gonna
[2:06:49] overcome you are in position right now
[2:06:52] this morning to take a Rapture by the
[2:06:54] revelation of the word
[2:06:58] give me my mountain
[2:07:02] give me my Mountain Caleb you can't have
[2:07:04] it give me my Mountain Caleb you're too
[2:07:07] old to take it give me my Rapture come
[2:07:11] on church then I don't have time to
[2:07:13] finish it I'll preach it I'm just
[2:07:14] preaching here real quick this message
[2:07:16] has changed our language because the
[2:07:19] Rapture is in us and we are in the
[2:07:21] rapture we are feeding upon the faithful
[2:07:24] Saiyans of the revelation of the word
[2:07:26] and the age we're living brother Jack I
[2:07:28] got to think about to the day we're just
[2:07:29] down there at Louisiana that brother Tim
[2:07:31] Pruitt's in his wife's funeral sister
[2:07:32] Karen's we was walking out of the
[2:07:34] walking out of the graveyard and there's
[2:07:36] probably two 300 Believers out there and
[2:07:38] they were all literally standing around
[2:07:39] I can't hear it over and over some
[2:07:41] morning between six and nine some
[2:07:43] morning between six and nine I got to
[2:07:45] thinking about that I bet Funeral
[2:07:46] Directors have got a private WhatsApp
[2:07:48] group if they all talk to each other and
[2:07:51] say there's some crazy people come
[2:07:52] around here every now and again and they
[2:07:54] all talk about some morning between six
[2:07:56] and nine I tell you why we talk about
[2:07:58] fan it's because the revelation of this
[2:08:01] message has changed our language and at
[2:08:04] any moment any second any hour we're
[2:08:06] going to be like Enoch we're going to be
[2:08:08] here one second and the next second
[2:08:09] we're not going to be
[2:08:12] what are you saying I'm saying this this
[2:08:14] is another Ephesians
[2:08:16] this message is the Revelation that'll
[2:08:19] put you in position for the changing of
[2:08:21] your body Birmingham come along very
[2:08:23] beautifully and says it in Paradox he
[2:08:25] says what is it it is a revelation of
[2:08:27] the Unseen I love this he says the
[2:08:29] Ephesus is here brother Troy how are we
[2:08:31] going to get there we talked about a
[2:08:33] Rapture we've got a tape called things
[2:08:35] are to be we got a tape called the
[2:08:37] future home we got a tape called beyond
[2:08:39] the curtain of time and the prophet says
[2:08:41] the Ephesus is here I love this brother
[2:08:44] Jack he said this is the thing that will
[2:08:47] bridge between denomination and the
[2:08:49] glory land this message is the bridge
[2:08:52] between denomination and the glory land
[2:08:55] in other words I'm saying how many wants
[2:08:57] to go to the glory land how many wants
[2:08:59] to go to the Future home how many wants

[2:16:20] and by my physical hands place it into
[2:16:23] the heart of the Church of the Living
[2:16:25] God but Lord your quickening spirit is
[2:16:28] here this morning
[2:16:29] Lord you can take these things
[2:16:31] and you can rightly divide him in the
[2:16:33] hearts of your children Lord maybe some
[2:16:35] here already knew some of these I'm sure
[2:16:37] most of them did maybe some here that
[2:16:39] are new that are growing in the
[2:16:40] Revelation and Lord your spirit can take
[2:16:43] it and positionally place him but father

[2:17:34] hearts of your children and Lord may
[2:17:36] they take the sword of the word and
[2:17:37] strike down every devil in the name of
[2:17:40] Jesus Christ father may they not let the

[2:18:33] close by not saying this I told this to
[2:18:35] brother Jack last night I only know if
[2:18:37] you remember it or not but I was about I
[2:18:39] don't know 16 17 and I met you brother
[2:18:41] Fred Mullins I've told this around the
[2:18:43] country around the world actually I met
[2:18:46] you at brother Fred Mullins and I was
[2:18:47] preaching that night on the fire of God
[2:18:48] and the revelation of this message and
[2:18:50] that man walked out back he didn't know
[2:18:52] what I was going through he didn't know
[2:18:54] that I was preaching in message churches
[2:18:56] that I thought believed the message in
[2:18:57] men tell me don't quote brother Brandon
[2:18:59] and don't say this and don't say that
[2:19:00] and I walked out of that building
[2:19:02] brother case were standing around back
[2:19:03] he said we've been coming this meet for
[2:19:04] years I think y'all had the same room at
[2:19:06] the hotel there every year in Florence
[2:19:08] it's been come this meeting for years he
[2:19:11] said like this he said you believe God
[2:19:12] called you the preach this message young
[2:19:14] man I said yes sir I do
[2:19:15] he said if God's called you to preach
[2:19:17] this message and you don't have one Lord
[2:19:19] to preach it and didn't have a clue what
[2:19:20] I was going through he said you go out
[2:19:22] in the woods and find you a rock and
[2:19:23] start preaching this message that rock
[2:19:25] and capers you said somebody I'll come
[2:19:27] sit on that rock and I was kind of
[2:19:29] looking at you
[2:19:30] you said because God don't send a
[2:19:32] message and not somebody there to hear
[2:19:34] it
[2:19:35] I've taken that testimony and that that
[2:19:37] experience with that brother and our
[2:19:39] Lord and whip Devils around this world
[2:19:41] with that this message is the truth
[2:19:43] somebody's going to preach it somebody's
[2:19:46] going to believe it somebody's going to
[2:19:48] overcome bad and somebody's going to
[2:19:50] change their body by some morning
[2:19:51] between six and nine brother Jack would
[2:19:53] you come
[2:19:54] it's real this morning Shake somebody's
[2:19:57] hand and say I'll see you in the Rapture
[2:19:58] it's real
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:14] let's give the Lord a hand of praise for
[2:20:17] the word of the Lord on today
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:22] um
[2:20:23] just um
[2:20:25] absolutely blessed amen by Brother
[2:20:28] Andrew and but just even that last
[2:20:31] comment that he made about brother
[2:20:33] Capers asking him are you uh do you feel
[2:20:37] called to preach this message and
[2:20:40] um
[2:20:42] to me that's very very important brother
[2:20:44] Branham went through ordination and he
[2:20:47] was he started to ordain this one
[2:20:50] brother or a couple Brothers next thing
[2:20:52] you know all these people just start
[2:20:54] standing up and like I want to be
[2:20:55] ordained I want to be ordained I want to
[2:20:57] be ordained and uh so he began to just
[2:21:00] kind of ask anybody know this person
[2:21:02] because I just can't ordain if I really
[2:21:03] don't know him anybody can vouch that
[2:21:06] this person got a call in their life and
[2:21:09] I think there was a brother that was
[2:21:10] coming from the Salvation Army and he
[2:21:12] says well yeah I want to be I want to be
[2:21:14] ordained
[2:21:15] and brother Brandon say well now um
[2:21:18] we have a message
[2:21:20] and we were ordaining people
[2:21:23] to preach this message
[2:21:26] he says uh you know we just believe
[2:21:29] God's called us to something and as
[2:21:30] brother brother Andrew said this in his
[2:21:33] in his uh closing there this is our lift
[2:21:37] this is our vehicle to get us into the
[2:21:42] Rapture it's this message that God has
[2:21:44] sent us and the messages come through
[2:21:46] the scripture
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:49] look how chapter four Revelation 10 7.
[2:21:53] Saint Luke 17 30. and they say the
[2:21:55] message is being able to recognize the
[2:21:58] the scriptures that are for your day
[2:22:02] see we're not living in Moses day if you
[2:22:04] see somebody putting amen Blood on the
[2:22:07] door and talk about they're getting
[2:22:08] ready for something something's wrong
[2:22:10] somewhere it's not going to be on the
[2:22:12] physical door but it will be on the door
[2:22:13] of your heart
[2:22:14] if you see somebody building a boat
[2:22:16] talking about jump in don't go get into
[2:22:19] that but I will tell you this when you
[2:22:22] can find yourself in the word of God get
[2:22:24] into that
[2:22:25] this is the vehicle
[2:22:28] we're not just
[2:22:30] ordaining people to ordain people we got
[2:22:34] a message
[2:22:37] and I tell you what I I I'm I've watched
[2:22:40] brother Andrew for a number of years
[2:22:43] he first came to us to preach he was 18
[2:22:47] years old and uh now he's 26 and you
[2:22:50] know you can just see the growth that
[2:22:52] has gone that has happened in this
[2:22:54] ministry and just you know many of the
[2:22:56] things that he laid out as a pastor I
[2:22:58] would probably take a whole year to go
[2:23:01] through some of those things that he
[2:23:03] talked about today right and and I'ma
[2:23:05] just this one statement that he made but
[2:23:07] I I just the growth that I see in him
[2:23:09] and just the the depth of the word uh
[2:23:12] man we we ate
[2:23:15] this was this was spiritual food
[2:23:19] in due season
[2:23:21] and I know sometimes some of these
[2:23:23] things can go over people's heads we're
[2:23:25] not just shouting just to be shouting
[2:23:27] but there's a reveal word that is coming
[2:23:29] our hour that's pulled this shout out of
[2:23:31] us we know we stand but he made a
[2:23:33] statement there
[2:23:36] um if you can stay under the anointing
[2:23:40] it will bake the greenness out of you
[2:23:45] keep coming to church we're here on on
[2:23:48] Wednesday nights we're here on Sunday
[2:23:51] mornings but just keep coming to church
[2:23:52] it'll bake the greenness out
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:58] I don't know why we're shouting
[2:24:01] this word this word this word this word
[2:24:03] we all come from somewhere uh my I was
[2:24:07] somebody was asked me the other day like
[2:24:09] um
[2:24:10] um our background yeah I was so you were
[2:24:13] Baptist right so no no my family on one
[2:24:16] side of the family on this side is
[2:24:19] Baptist but on this side is Pentecostal
[2:24:23] so we just caught in the middle of all
[2:24:26] this
[2:24:27] but when the word came
[2:24:29] when we understood by the word and I'm
[2:24:32] talking about by wait a minute what does
[2:24:34] it say right there I'll send you a line
[2:24:36] to the prophet before the coming of the
[2:24:38] Grateful Dead in the Lord and not not
[2:24:39] here's the other thing I'll send you
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:47] I I'll send you the very last scripture
[2:24:51] in the Old Testament
[2:24:55] Hidden book everybody want to go talk
[2:24:58] about ties and offers in the Book of
[2:24:59] Malachi but what about God sending you a
[2:25:01] prophet I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[2:25:06] before the great and terrible that's a
[2:25:08] prophecy in scripture so when is it time
[2:25:11] for that to be made manifest you know
[2:25:13] there was Elijah came amen at the first
[2:25:15] coming of the Lord Jesus his name
[2:25:18] happened to be John the Baptist but he
[2:25:21] come in the spirit of Elijah and if
[2:25:23] there was an Elijah that came at the
[2:25:25] first coming and we know we're living in
[2:25:27] the days of the second coming then Jesus
[2:25:30] Christ the same yesterday that day and
[2:25:33] forever there'd be another Elijah had
[2:25:36] ever come before the second coming of
[2:25:38] the Lord Jesus not to turn our attention
[2:25:40] to Elijah
[2:25:42] but to get our attention back on Christ
[2:25:45] [Music]
