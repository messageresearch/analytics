[42:49] month ahead amen it's always good to be
[42:52] busy for the Lord amen uh I want to just
[42:56] read from uh
[42:59] Hebrews uh chapter 11 uh just a couple
[43:03] verses and we will hopefully finish this
[43:07] thought and on today uh I've usually
[43:10] preached it but today is going to be
[43:12] talk uh so we'll have a PowerPoint uh uh
[43:15] slide here that you'll just follow along
[43:17] with me on praise the Lord uh the Bible
[43:20] says here in Hebrews chapter
[43:23] 11 um
[43:26] verse 8 it says by faith Abraham when he
[43:31] was called to go out into a place which
[43:35] he should after receive for an
[43:37] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[43:40] knowing whether he
[43:43] went by faith he sojourned in the land
[43:47] of promise as in a strange country
[43:50] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[43:53] Jacob The Heirs with him of the the same
[43:56] promise uh for he look for a city which
[44:01] hath
[44:01] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[44:06] god let's just have a word of prayer
[44:09] father we are
[44:11] grateful for the privilege and the
[44:13] opportunity that we have to come into
[44:16] the house of the Lord and we trust Lord
[44:19] that the spirit of God would just take
[44:20] control over this portion of the service
[44:23] as you have throughout the wor ship we
[44:27] ask God that you would uh allow us to
[44:29] hear from Heaven through the word may it
[44:32] bring strength may it bring correction
[44:35] May it bring Lord uh uh uh instruction
[44:39] God whatever it is that we need may it
[44:41] bring healing may it bring Deliverance
[44:44] father whatever the word uh that
[44:46] whatever vitamins we need from it may
[44:48] you bring it forth on today and we ask
[44:50] that you get the glory the honor out of
[44:52] the thought Lord that is being presented
[44:54] to the Saints in Jesus name
[44:56] we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen
[45:00] in the presence of the Lord amen praise
[45:04] the Lord so uh again our our uh title
[45:08] today is uh the city whose Builder maker
[45:11] is God and um this is part three of this
[45:15] of this series and you know I I have I I
[45:19] certainly as we started you know
[45:21] journeying through this I telling you
[45:22] all I've been teaching in the Book of
[45:24] Revelations on a little call that I was
[45:26] uh a part of uh for roughly 2 and A2
[45:30] years or something like that I would get
[45:32] on the phone at 8:00 in the morning
[45:34] sometimes to listen and comment on the
[45:36] other brother's calls and then um every
[45:38] Wednesday I would teach and then
[45:40] sometimes I have to fill in for other
[45:42] others that would not be available to
[45:44] teach and uh but at the beginning of
[45:46] this year I just kind of felt we I come
[45:49] to the end of revelation 22 with this
[45:52] group and um and I felt that it was a
[45:55] perfect time time for me to just kind of
[45:56] take a step back uh from that uh because
[46:00] I'm I I brought you know these teachings
[46:02] on Revelation and and and uh and I'm
[46:04] like I'm not sure exactly where they're
[46:06] going to be going next but one brother
[46:08] said they wanted to go through the Book
[46:09] of Genesis and I said oh my that would
[46:11] be I mean it was three years just to get
[46:13] through Revelation can you imagine how
[46:15] many years it would take to get through
[46:17] the Book of Genesis and I say having a
[46:20] church and you know other
[46:21] responsibilities it's very difficult for
[46:23] me to commit to that a longterm Journey
[46:25] Journey you know like that so I just
[46:27] felt it would be best for me to kind of
[46:29] back up and I'll just fill in where
[46:31] where I can here and there but along the
[46:33] journey we we gathered you know some
[46:35] real good things that I thought would be
[46:37] beneficial for our church not just for
[46:40] what I do online but for for for for us
[46:42] so uh this is for us amen this morning
[46:45] and uh and I pray it would be a blessing
[46:47] so um we were um mentioning you know
[46:53] just next there uh the
[46:56] next that um this city amen that that
[47:01] this city who's building make is God is
[47:03] a city where the scripture tells us that
[47:05] Jesus is the light of the city uh we
[47:10] were able to um um determine you know a
[47:15] couple things and we'll we'll just
[47:16] quickly go go through this but John 8:12
[47:19] tells us that then spake Jesus unto them
[47:21] saying I am the light of the world Amen
[47:24] and he that follow shall not walk in
[47:26] darkness but shall have the light of
[47:28] life now uh as we were mentioning
[47:31] yesterday you know you you can't even
[47:32] really start living to you have Jesus on
[47:34] the
[47:36] inside Jesus is the light and and and he
[47:39] we're going to show you that he was the
[47:40] light in Genesis he was the light in the
[47:43] beginning of the Bible he was the light
[47:45] in the middle of the Bible and he also
[47:47] is the light at the end of the Bible
[47:49] amen Jesus is the light amen and here in
[47:53] Genesis 1 the very next uh statement
[47:55] says in the beginning God created the
[47:57] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[47:59] without form and void and darkness was
[48:02] upon the face of the deep and the and
[48:03] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[48:05] the waters and God said let there be
[48:10] light and it says there was light now
[48:12] now we know uh just by reading the Bible
[48:15] that when God said let there be light
[48:17] that was not
[48:19] sunlight that was not s u n light that
[48:22] was s o n light that came out of God at
[48:27] that moment so so the very first thing
[48:30] that God creates is this light this Loos
[48:33] that comes out of God and that's how
[48:35] we're able to identify God amen amen so
[48:38] we find this is Jesus and and Paul met
[48:41] that same light on the road to Damascus
[48:44] I could also tell you that that same
[48:45] light took a picture over the prophet's
[48:47] head amen and it and we get a chance to
[48:50] see that God was identifying himself
[48:52] with his Prophet we're not following
[48:55] amen
[48:56] a man we're following the Vindicated God
[49:00] Amen vindicating a Ministry and God
[49:03] always uses the vessels of human beings
[49:06] to deliver his word hallelujah it was
[49:09] God showing the same light that Paul
[49:11] spoke to and we we can we can identify
[49:14] with it when we read scripture we see
[49:15] that light identifying itself with the
[49:17] prophet in this day so we thank God for
[49:20] light we are walking in light amen
[49:26] amen here this next uh scripture in
[49:29] Psalms 23 we brought this out to you
[49:31] that yay though I walk through the
[49:33] valley of the shadow of death I will
[49:37] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[49:40] rod and thy staff they comfort me this
[49:43] scripture here alone shows us that Jesus
[49:45] is the light amen because in the Valley
[49:49] of Death there would not be a shadow if
[49:51] there was not an element of light in the
[49:54] valley
[49:56] amen amen so so so when you're walking
[49:58] through the valley of the shadow of
[50:00] death you have nothing to fear because
[50:02] Jesus is right there to bring you
[50:05] through he's the light he's the light
[50:09] this other scripture here in Revelation
[50:11] 2123 tells us in the city had no need of
[50:14] the sun neither the moon to shine in it
[50:17] the city whose Builder make is God the
[50:19] city had no need of the sun neither of
[50:22] the moon to shine in it for the glory of
[50:25] God did lighten it and the lamb is the
[50:27] light thereof remember in Genesis the
[50:30] Sun and Moon did not come until the
[50:31] fourth day but the first day when God
[50:34] said let there be light that was the
[50:35] Lord Jesus that was expressed there Amen
[50:38] in light form and uh and now here the
[50:41] end in Revelation 21:23 we're right back
[50:44] to where we started the Lord Jesus is
[50:46] the light of this city amen hallelujah
[50:50] hallelujah amen I have this
[50:54] question that I keep presenting to all
[50:58] that would hear if one rejects the
[51:01] light of their day how can they expect
[51:06] to live in the city where the lamb is
[51:10] the
[51:11] light you can't reject the light in your
[51:14] day and then expect to make it to heaven
[51:17] now now now now don't get me wrong I
[51:19] there are some people that might not
[51:20] ever come in contact with what we have
[51:23] and I'm not saying that they can't make
[51:25] it
[51:26] amen the thief on the cross made it the
[51:29] thief on the cross made it and and I'm
[51:31] I'm I'm going tell you another thing too
[51:32] you know now now you can take this for
[51:34] uh uh for how you want to you want to
[51:36] take it but uh brother Brandon he had um
[51:39] made a statement he says that uh you
[51:42] know uh uh he was uh you know just
[51:45] thinking about heaven and things of that
[51:47] nature and and uh when God showed him uh
[51:49] something about heaven he said you know
[51:51] everything that you love and everything
[51:54] that ever loved you I have given to
[51:59] you now that's that's powerful right and
[52:03] and for me when brother brandom shared
[52:05] that I I took it personal and I say
[52:08] everything that I love and everything
[52:12] that that love me God will give me on
[52:15] the other
[52:17] side hallu that that's just my personal
[52:20] revelation amen and if you want it you
[52:23] can have it too but uh but that's my
[52:25] person that everything that I love God
[52:27] will give me on the other side brother
[52:30] random said in the message um Mother's
[52:33] Day he say he say heaven really wouldn't
[52:35] be Heaven if all Mama's children weren't
[52:41] there God God know how you love your
[52:44] your your loved ones God know I mean
[52:46] without them you wouldn't be here some I
[52:48] mean we got parents that probably never
[52:50] came into this truth grandparents that
[52:52] never came into this truth but God knows
[52:54] how you love them and God had to use
[52:57] them to bring you here so don't get
[52:59] discouraged about those things but but
[53:01] it's it's when you are presented light
[53:04] you as an individual have to walk in the
[53:08] light hallu and sometimes the only light
[53:11] they see is the light that's reflecting
[53:14] in you that's trth can I put it this way
[53:18] you are the
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:21] message amen amen yes sir
[53:26] Hallelujah we want to make sure that as
[53:29] light comes to us that we're not found
[53:31] rejecting the light that has been given
[53:33] to
[53:34] us here in this uh quote here this next
[53:39] quote uh brother brandom out of the
[53:40] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[53:43] and the Earthly bride he says
[53:45] Jesus going to prepare with Divine hands
[53:48] a Divine City a Divine architect for a
[53:52] Divine bought people for predestinated
[53:57] people uh he's going to
[53:59] prepare Abraham was looking for it and
[54:02] he professed that he was a pilgrim and a
[54:06] stranger for he looked for a city whose
[54:08] Builder and maker was God Amen that
[54:12] Prophet knowing it was somewhere John
[54:15] saw it coming down but Abraham thought
[54:18] it must be on earth right then Abraham
[54:22] was so convinced with you know just
[54:23] getting a glimpse it's got to be on
[54:25] Earth right now so he went looking for
[54:26] it hallelujah look at this now uh uh and
[54:30] and I love this part where brother brand
[54:31] said God I mean John saw it coming down
[54:34] coming down we're going to get to that a
[54:35] little bit later says but Abraham
[54:37] thought it must be on earth right then
[54:38] says while he met
[54:40] MDC the king of it and gave him a tithe
[54:45] which had no father or or no mother he
[54:48] had no beginning of Life or no ending of
[54:51] Life Abraham met him and they took
[54:55] communion right on the literal spot
[54:58] where the city will be raised up can you
[55:01] imagine that where Abraham met MDC
[55:05] brother brandham tells us that Abraham
[55:07] met him in the very spot that this new
[55:09] city would be raised up amen amen we
[55:13] know exactly where it's going to be the
[55:15] prophet told us that right it says it
[55:17] even gave us dimensions of it amen the
[55:20] scriptures say the angel measured the
[55:22] city well an angel measured it
[55:25] think about that amen the seventh angel
[55:29] measured the city and then told you what
[55:32] it was going to be like put it in a
[55:34] sermon called future home of the
[55:35] Heavenly bridegroom and somebody going
[55:38] to tell you not to listen to it this is
[55:39] your city I I tried to tell you amen
[55:43] many people put certain cities on their
[55:46] bucket
[55:49] list and they check it off when they go
[55:51] to this city and they check it off when
[55:53] they go to that City come on but if you
[55:55] don't have this city that Abraham was
[55:58] talking about if you don't have that on
[56:00] your list you need to get rid of your
[56:01] list that's right this City's got to be
[56:04] at the top of your
[56:05] list I got to make it to the city whose
[56:09] Builder and maker is God yes sir yes sir
[56:12] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen
[56:16] typically we pack and we get ready to go
[56:18] to different cities on different trips
[56:20] to get those those cities checked off
[56:22] the bucket list but brother bandam said
[56:24] when you go to this city you got to
[56:25] unpack yes sir that's right get rid of
[56:28] the things of the world Hallelujah you
[56:31] got to unpack to go here Lord we look
[56:34] forward to this Abraham met
[56:36] him and they took
[56:39] communion right on the literal spot
[56:43] where the city will be raised up the
[56:44] Holy Mountain of the Lord where the
[56:47] redeemed will live oh my that time just
[56:51] don't stop he says uh we'll we'll go
[56:53] we'll go to Eternity so so I'm I'm I'm
[56:55] happy about that because um uh when he
[56:58] says he was preparing a place one of the
[57:01] the the the scriptures that we use even
[57:02] when we're comforting families uh in in
[57:04] losses is John 14 amen says let not your
[57:08] hearts be troubled ye believe in God
[57:11] believe also in me in my father's house
[57:14] are many mansions if it were not
[57:16] so uh I have I I I would have told you I
[57:20] go to prepar place for you and brother
[57:22] brandom even had to give us
[57:23] understanding on that cuz how can a
[57:25] house have
[57:27] Mansions right it it's not a house to
[57:29] have Mansion but it's in my father's
[57:32] domain his his kingdom amen it's many
[57:37] palaces oh for me again it's my personal
[57:41] revelation if there's a palace that he
[57:44] has for me I'm going to enjoy
[57:48] it amen cuz Jesus said in in his
[57:52] father's house there was many mansions
[57:53] which means there's some something there
[57:55] for
[57:56] me oh come on somebody I ain't got to
[57:59] worry about paying the
[58:01] bills I ain't got to worry about keep I
[58:03] ain't got to worry about keeping the
[58:05] lights on because Jesus is the
[58:10] lightall in my father's house are many
[58:12] mansions if it were not so I would have
[58:14] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[58:16] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[58:19] I will come again and receive you unto
[58:20] myself that where I am there you may be
[58:24] also so and whether I go you know and
[58:26] the way you know Thomas sayth unto him
[58:29] Lord we know not whether thou goest and
[58:31] how can we know uh the way here's what
[58:33] Jesus response was Jesus said I am the
[58:36] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[58:40] unto the father but by me we don't want
[58:44] to reject the light sir of our day am
[58:48] here we go
[58:49] forward Jesus is the
[58:52] light if one Rejects the light of their
[58:56] day and that's very important I want to
[58:58] I I should have underlined that rejects
[59:00] the light of their day
[59:03] Lord a lot of people believe in
[59:06] Jesus lot of churches believe in Jesus
[59:09] they they they they preach about him
[59:10] dying on the cross and raising again and
[59:13] man that's like the climax of every
[59:15] sermon in chur and and most most
[59:17] denominational churches let me say this
[59:19] too while I'm here because I might
[59:21] forget it and most denominated church
[59:23] when when we're talking about
[59:24] denomination you got to understand
[59:25] denominations are not anything
[59:28] new they just start happening in our day
[59:32] no sir you know in Jesus day there was
[59:36] denominations yes
[59:39] sir where where from Brother Jack the
[59:43] Pharisees was a
[59:45] denomination the Sadducees was another
[59:48] denomination and the thing that they
[59:50] split on is that they didn't believe in
[59:53] the Sadducees didn't believe in resur
[59:54] Resurrection right and I remember a
[59:56] friend of mine say say say they they
[59:58] didn't believe in the resurrection so
[59:59] they're sad you
[1:00:04] see but they were split they were split
[1:00:07] you had Pharisees Sadducees you had
[1:00:09] other groups back then too denominations
[1:00:12] that Jesus had to preach against sir and
[1:00:15] so the Same Spirit trickled down to this
[1:00:17] day that's why we got all these
[1:00:19] different churches amen and nobody's
[1:00:21] walking in the pure truth anymore right
[1:00:24] brother amen but God had to send a
[1:00:25] prophet to bring us back to truth yes
[1:00:28] sir that's what this whole thing that
[1:00:31] that if I could just simplify the
[1:00:33] message that's that's as simple as as it
[1:00:35] can get God had to send a prophet to
[1:00:38] restore the truth and let me tell you
[1:00:40] when your heart has been turned uh as
[1:00:43] it's been promised in Malachi 4 then you
[1:00:45] can say I am the restoration sir
[1:00:49] Hallelujah yes sir brother my heart has
[1:00:52] been turned I'm convinced amen I know
[1:00:55] that this is what God had had in store
[1:00:57] but but denominations are not anything
[1:01:00] new it's a spirit that just keeps
[1:01:02] repeating itself over and over again but
[1:01:04] God always has to send somebody to bring
[1:01:07] them back to the word amen John was sent
[1:01:10] how to get them back to the word Jesus s
[1:01:11] trying to get them back to the word
[1:01:13] brother brandom sent try to get them
[1:01:14] back to the word that was the whole
[1:01:16] purpose very simple here if one rejects
[1:01:19] the light for their day that's that's
[1:01:21] the voice that God has given you to
[1:01:23] bring you back to the truth if you
[1:01:25] reject the light for your day how can
[1:01:27] you expect to live in the city where the
[1:01:29] lamb is light well brother Brandon gave
[1:01:31] us the answer to this question he said
[1:01:33] it in the massachus home of the Heavenly
[1:01:35] bridegroom and Earthly bride it says
[1:01:38] this is for only the
[1:01:40] Overcomers says do you know do you know
[1:01:42] uh you know that he said it isn't for
[1:01:44] the denominations
[1:01:46] hey this isn't for the denominations now
[1:01:50] let me let me back up I I don't want you
[1:01:52] to get lost on this it's not not saying
[1:01:54] that one person from a denomination
[1:01:57] can't make
[1:01:59] it but the denominations as a
[1:02:02] whole and see brother Brandon constantly
[1:02:05] said this I don't know why people didn't
[1:02:07] get it he said it's not the
[1:02:10] people in the denominations it is the
[1:02:15] system he was only preaching against the
[1:02:18] system not the people once we get that
[1:02:21] dividing line there are good people yes
[1:02:24] sir there are saved people in
[1:02:29] denominations there are people that love
[1:02:31] God in denominations and we're not
[1:02:34] coming against the people but we are
[1:02:36] coming against the system yes sir amen
[1:02:40] oh hallelujah it's a spirit behind the
[1:02:43] system Satan is behind the system so
[1:02:45] when he says for only to Overcomers do
[1:02:48] not do you know that it that that it it
[1:02:50] isn't for the
[1:02:51] denominations says you say you mean that
[1:02:53] brother R says let's turn to Revelation
[1:02:55] 2 just a minute and find it Revelation
[1:02:56] 2:7 let's find out now whether it's
[1:02:58] really the truth or not Revelation 2:7
[1:03:01] reads like this we have it there on the
[1:03:03] screen it says and he that hath an
[1:03:05] ear oh let him hear what the spirit
[1:03:11] saith unto the
[1:03:14] churches now even in that why would the
[1:03:16] spirit be talking to to
[1:03:19] churches what churches is he talking to
[1:03:22] he's talking to the true church church
[1:03:25] and the false church and the problem is
[1:03:27] they get into
[1:03:29] twine and when the true church and the
[1:03:31] false Church get into twine it's hard
[1:03:33] for you to decipher which one is right
[1:03:35] or not
[1:03:37] Hallelujah that's why God had to give
[1:03:40] you prophetic insight to be able to see
[1:03:43] which one is right and which one is not
[1:03:45] the one that's right going to always
[1:03:46] follow come on the word yes sir from
[1:03:50] Genesis to Revelation they going to
[1:03:53] follow the word amen let's go on a
[1:03:55] little further we got some teaching to
[1:03:57] do today he that hath an ear let him
[1:03:59] hear what the spirit sayth unto the
[1:04:01] churches to him that overcometh will I
[1:04:04] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[1:04:06] in the midst of the parag paradise of
[1:04:07] God and the overcoming I can tell you I
[1:04:09] I didn't put the rest of this quote up
[1:04:11] there but the overcoming is actually
[1:04:12] overcoming the denominational Spirits in
[1:04:14] your day amen amen amen you got to be
[1:04:18] able to overcome that yes sir okay keep
[1:04:21] that keep it uh but keep your line
[1:04:23] straight there on that it's not the
[1:04:25] people that's not what we're preaching
[1:04:27] against it's the people I believe
[1:04:28] there's people out there that love love
[1:04:30] God I had a grandmother that was in
[1:04:32] denomination she was she was a I mean
[1:04:34] she was a strict Pentecostal and even
[1:04:37] when the Pentecostal Church changed
[1:04:38] Grandma stayed the
[1:04:40] same yes I had another grandma that was
[1:04:43] a Baptist yes and and I mean she would
[1:04:46] come to church here and there but she
[1:04:47] never was able to really take all of
[1:04:48] this but you're not going to tell me
[1:04:50] come on you're not going to take my
[1:04:53] promise from me
[1:04:54] right I believe I'm going to see both of
[1:04:56] my grandmothers on the other
[1:04:58] side not just me amen amen and and I
[1:05:03] realized that they lived in the day when
[1:05:05] the prophet came and and all that but
[1:05:06] they just weren't able to cross over to
[1:05:08] that even brother brandom told that to
[1:05:10] one of one of the other brothers he says
[1:05:11] look brother he was so concerned about
[1:05:13] his family not accepting the message
[1:05:15] said look brother you can't put new wine
[1:05:18] and old
[1:05:20] bottles the brother's like what you just
[1:05:23] they they were they came up underneath
[1:05:25] another time and so you just got to let
[1:05:27] them come underneath that other age and
[1:05:29] remember now the ages overlap
[1:05:33] y'all amen but they came up underneath
[1:05:36] that overlap he say so don't worry about
[1:05:38] it you can't put new wine in Old bottles
[1:05:40] right see so you a new bottle so you can
[1:05:42] take this but don't worry about it just
[1:05:44] God God God got everything under control
[1:05:47] hall hallelujah amen
[1:05:51] amen here I want to
[1:05:54] bring in a scripture as we go forward
[1:05:57] revelation 22
[1:06:00] and4 says blessed are they see I told
[1:06:04] you you're going to be able to tell the
[1:06:05] difference because they're intertwined
[1:06:07] but you're going to be able to tell the
[1:06:08] difference the ones that are going to
[1:06:10] inhabit this city they're not going to
[1:06:11] be denominational people the system of
[1:06:14] denomination that's not coming in but it
[1:06:16] might be individuals that come out that
[1:06:18] might make it praise God I believe that
[1:06:20] all right however um since you have come
[1:06:25] into light we just want to give you the
[1:06:28] full light yes and and and and and and
[1:06:31] you know I I I I always you know get
[1:06:33] this argument you know you think God
[1:06:35] just going to let these people just go
[1:06:37] and you know and and and and they trying
[1:06:39] to do this and they trying to do they
[1:06:40] they love God you think God just going
[1:06:41] to let them go because they ain't
[1:06:42] following the message well it's not
[1:06:45] about them I'm not really too worried
[1:06:47] about them if they don't know no better
[1:06:49] they walking in all the light they got
[1:06:51] right the one that I'm concerned about
[1:06:53] is is the one that's asking the question
[1:06:55] right you have been given more than what
[1:06:59] they have you have been shown more than
[1:07:03] what they have you are not even in their
[1:07:05] category exactly right that's exactly
[1:07:08] right you in a totally different
[1:07:10] category let's talk about you come
[1:07:14] on and look at this the scripture say
[1:07:16] blessed are they that do his
[1:07:19] Commandments that they may have a right
[1:07:21] to the tree of life and May enter in
[1:07:24] through the gates into the city so if
[1:07:27] you want to go you going to have to
[1:07:29] follow the word Jesus said if you love
[1:07:31] me you'll keep my
[1:07:34] Commandments hallelujah amen so you have
[1:07:37] a responsibility as a believer that has
[1:07:40] been shown more light than the others
[1:07:43] you have to walk in the light and not
[1:07:44] reject that God will judge you for what
[1:07:48] you know he'll judge them for what they
[1:07:51] know amen amen I was teaching on this
[1:07:55] and I just uh was blessed just to kind
[1:07:59] of do a little search through the
[1:08:01] message and brother
[1:08:03] brandom took like four different
[1:08:07] things um that I found and then you I'm
[1:08:09] sure there was others but for the time
[1:08:11] that I found just for the lesson that I
[1:08:12] Was preparing four things that brother
[1:08:15] brandom uh uh uh um kind of connected
[1:08:18] this scripture to that we sometimes do
[1:08:21] and sometimes don't do and I felt that
[1:08:24] it would be very important for us to go
[1:08:26] back and refresh some of this and uh and
[1:08:30] then on top of refreshing uh as I'm
[1:08:32] refreshing you might not realize it but
[1:08:34] there's a
[1:08:35] restoration taking
[1:08:39] place I'm still in the channel of I will
[1:08:43] restore saith the Lord It's not brother
[1:08:47] Jack restoring it's it's it's God
[1:08:49] restoring and sometimes the restoration
[1:08:51] is us just getting back in line with the
[1:08:53] scripture that's
[1:08:55] it getting our hearts realigned sir and
[1:08:59] it's a good time to do that at the
[1:09:01] beginning of the year I feel so I want
[1:09:03] to just take amen the the next part of
[1:09:05] this uh Sermon Just to kind of talk
[1:09:08] about these four things that brother
[1:09:09] brandom brought to us we'll we'll read
[1:09:11] it so he says blessed are they that do
[1:09:13] his Commandments that they may have a
[1:09:16] right to the tree of life so this city
[1:09:18] and whose Builder maker God in order to
[1:09:20] enter the city people going to have to
[1:09:22] do the Commandments
[1:09:24] of God all
[1:09:33] right I want to just introduce this this
[1:09:35] this quote before we get started in the
[1:09:38] message the token brother brandom says
[1:09:39] but oh brother when the token is once
[1:09:41] placed in your heart and you know it's
[1:09:43] the resurrection of Jesus Christ in you
[1:09:47] something's happening there isn't
[1:09:49] nothing going to turn you you know where
[1:09:52] you belong and look at this
[1:09:55] full
[1:09:57] obedience to the whole word of God now I
[1:10:02] need to just I put that underline and I
[1:10:04] know you know sometimes people when they
[1:10:07] hear me say brother brandom said just
[1:10:09] please don't just hear the brother
[1:10:11] brandom said part hear the part after
[1:10:15] that hear what I'm trying to tell you
[1:10:17] after that don't get stuck on brother
[1:10:20] brandom said hear what he said
[1:10:24] hear what he said now dissect what he
[1:10:28] said come on cuz I mean now don't not
[1:10:32] not just to hear brother brother random
[1:10:33] said don't that that's a devil that's
[1:10:36] trying to put a a a stop there here if I
[1:10:40] say Paul said right don't just stop at
[1:10:43] Paul said hear what Paul said if I say
[1:10:47] Moses said that shouldn't be enough to
[1:10:49] get you shout you want well what did
[1:10:51] Moses say if I say Jesus said
[1:10:55] on Amen but brother Jack don't stop it
[1:10:58] just Jesus said what did Jesus
[1:11:01] say huh if I if I if I say if I say
[1:11:04] Spurgeon said all right all right what
[1:11:07] did he say if I say Billy Graham said
[1:11:12] what did he say if I say brother bradam
[1:11:15] said what did he
[1:11:20] say this is what he said right amen he
[1:11:24] said full
[1:11:26] obedience to the whole word of
[1:11:30] God entitles you to the
[1:11:34] Token listen and nothing else and look
[1:11:37] at how he ties the scripture in blessed
[1:11:39] is he that does all of his Commandments
[1:11:44] might have a right to the tree of life
[1:11:46] so the very thought if you've ever heard
[1:11:48] preachers preach on full obedience to
[1:11:50] the whole word of God entitles you to to
[1:11:52] the token brother brandham got that
[1:11:55] thought from the scripture in Revelation
[1:11:59] 22:14 Hallelujah yes sir yes this is why
[1:12:02] the scripture follows the thought so
[1:12:05] when we when we talk about the city
[1:12:07] whose building Mak is God in order to
[1:12:09] enter into that City you going to have
[1:12:10] to
[1:12:12] follow the whole word of God and full
[1:12:15] obedience to the whole word of God
[1:12:17] entitles you to the Token can I go a
[1:12:19] little further for little being to the
[1:12:20] whole word of God entitles you to get
[1:12:21] into the city yes sir amen
[1:12:26] hallelujah he says this blessed is he
[1:12:28] that does all his Commandments might
[1:12:29] have a right to the tree of life then
[1:12:31] when we pray we must have the token to
[1:12:33] present with our prayers now don't fail
[1:12:36] to get that he says when you pray you
[1:12:39] must have the token to hold over your
[1:12:42] prayer if you're not keep praying till
[1:12:45] the token comes that's the Holy Ghost
[1:12:48] cuz you're not promised to receive it
[1:12:50] see you've got to have this token first
[1:12:53] that's the paying price your faith to
[1:12:56] believe it all right let's go forward
[1:12:58] because we got to get some
[1:13:00] things uh connected here for us to come
[1:13:04] into full obedience full obedience to
[1:13:07] the whole word of God titles you to the
[1:13:10] Token full obedience
[1:13:14] full obedience amen I wish y'all would
[1:13:17] bring
[1:13:18] notepads and pens to church when the
[1:13:22] preacher emphas EXC is a certain point
[1:13:24] you need to write it down the Holy Ghost
[1:13:27] trying to tell you something full
[1:13:32] obedience not
[1:13:34] partial not
[1:13:37] halfway
[1:13:38] full we're going to talk about some full
[1:13:41] obedience areas can we go further yes
[1:13:44] sir
[1:13:46] yes I told you there are four things I
[1:13:49] want to deal with today so here's the
[1:13:50] first one out of the message God
[1:13:54] being
[1:13:57] misunderstood it says can a Christian go
[1:13:59] to
[1:14:00] heaven if he or she does not pay tithe I
[1:14:03] told you
[1:14:09] fool
[1:14:14] obedience can a Christian a
[1:14:18] Christian go to heaven if he or she does
[1:14:21] not pay TI
[1:14:24] now that's one that I could not answer
[1:14:26] scripturally look at the prophet now
[1:14:29] that's one that I could not answer
[1:14:31] script he didn't say your tithing was
[1:14:32] based on you going to heaven or hell and
[1:14:36] why is your tithing why you put your
[1:14:37] tithing on a level like that whether I'm
[1:14:39] going to go to heaven or hell if I'm not
[1:14:41] going to hell I'mma keep my money in my
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:49] pocket but you say heaven If Heaven
[1:14:52] depend on if it depend on me making it
[1:14:54] Heaven here go my 10%
[1:14:57] Lord that that's not what this based
[1:15:00] on this is based on whether you love God
[1:15:03] or not and do you trust God with your
[1:15:07] money on cuz he trusted you with the
[1:15:10] money now I'm going to tell you
[1:15:12] something the government don't trust
[1:15:15] you they take TI they take their TI or
[1:15:18] they
[1:15:19] tax before you even get it home and then
[1:15:23] they hold it on the interest fre loan
[1:15:25] and then maybe decide to give it back to
[1:15:27] you maybe at the beginning of the next
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] year let's just read what the prophet
[1:15:35] said see what did he say brother brandom
[1:15:38] said what did he say here we go go now
[1:15:42] that's one that I could not answer
[1:15:44] scripture now I want you to understand
[1:15:46] when a prophet telling you that he can't
[1:15:47] answer that scripturally that is a
[1:15:49] that's that's a blessing that he just
[1:15:52] not giv his opinion he wants to base it
[1:15:55] yes sir that's it you got something you
[1:15:58] can trust now yes sir look at this now
[1:16:02] he says um I cannot answer scripturally
[1:16:04] now this Father Son and Holy Spirit if
[1:16:07] the minister is sincere Les uh just let
[1:16:10] us let us uh know you see and be glad
[1:16:13] brother Neville myself brother biller
[1:16:14] brother Collins and any of these
[1:16:15] ministers here uh who ordained to this
[1:16:17] ministry and so forth can do so but now
[1:16:19] uh does a Christian not get to heaven
[1:16:22] because do not pay TI I could not say
[1:16:25] yes or no to
[1:16:28] that but I do
[1:16:32] believe that every
[1:16:34] Christian is obligated to pay ties
[1:16:40] because it is a commandment of the Lord
[1:16:43] he's standing right with the word right
[1:16:45] it's a commandment of the Lord and
[1:16:47] blessed are
[1:16:49] they right back to revelation 22:14 your
[1:16:53] tithing is connected to Revelation
[1:16:58] 22:14 and blessed are they that do all
[1:17:00] his Commandments that they may have a
[1:17:03] right to enter into the life the tree of
[1:17:08] life now I believe that P I believe that
[1:17:10] tithe paying is essential to a Christian
[1:17:16] experience yes sir since he was based on
[1:17:19] the word I felt that we should just read
[1:17:21] the scripture on what it
[1:17:26] say the the the the it tells us in
[1:17:29] Malachi 3 this is where we actually get
[1:17:31] it now now let me let me also just
[1:17:33] mention this full obedience to the whole
[1:17:36] word of God is going to entitle to the
[1:17:37] token and and we have people nowadays
[1:17:40] that tell us that you pulling that
[1:17:42] tithing scripture out of the Old
[1:17:44] Testament and that was under law but we
[1:17:47] under
[1:17:48] grace and uh since we under grace uh you
[1:17:53] know we don't have to do that anymore we
[1:17:55] just give whatever is in our in our
[1:17:57] hearts well um I just like to say it
[1:18:01] like this when John was presented the
[1:18:05] book in The Book of Revelation it was
[1:18:08] told by the angel to eat the book now
[1:18:11] John could not just
[1:18:13] eat a
[1:18:15] paragraph out the book Sir John can just
[1:18:18] tear a page out the book and eat that
[1:18:22] right hello somebody John had to eat the
[1:18:26] entire
[1:18:28] book every chapter every
[1:18:32] verse every
[1:18:33] line and and so if John was told to eat
[1:18:36] the book you know what we do we eat
[1:18:41] Genesis we eat
[1:18:43] Exodus we eat
[1:18:46] Deuteronomy huh we eat Matthew we eat

[1:19:07] we eat
[1:19:11] Habu we eat Amos we eat Malachi we eat
[1:19:17] the whole
[1:19:19] book amen hallelujah
[1:19:23] amen and in Malachi it said will a man
[1:19:27] rob
[1:19:28] God Pastor just taking the
[1:19:31] money it's God's money it's not the
[1:19:33] pastor's

[1:23:05] today I've already talked about one
[1:23:07] y'all know the one blessing that's
[1:23:09] connected to keeping the Commandments
[1:23:11] you know what the first one
[1:23:13] is yeah y'all missing
[1:23:16] it tithing tithing is number one tithing
[1:23:21] is number one get your notebooks out I'm

[1:23:47] brother Neville's wonderful message to
[1:23:48] the church the Lord bless it and add to
[1:23:50] it and as he left you hanging in there
[1:23:52] on a meditation that's good keep that in
[1:23:55] your heart all the time and now we're
[1:23:56] going to have the communion tonight and
[1:23:59] that's the time we all enjoy I'm sure I
[1:24:02] think it's the Delight of every
[1:24:05] Christian's heart is to know that he is
[1:24:07] coming to keep a Commandment that Jesus
[1:24:10] left us there's two Commandments that
[1:24:13] Jesus left us two material things one of
[1:24:15] them is the communion service and the
[1:24:17] other is water
[1:24:18] baptism otherwise there's no T there's
[1:24:21] no touch
[1:24:22] handle nothing else left in it see just
[1:24:25] no Penance and dragging on your knees
[1:24:27] all these other kind of things it's just
[1:24:29] water
[1:24:30] baptism and communion so we're always
[1:24:34] happy to come to this and I believe the
[1:24:36] Bible said
[1:24:38] blessed is he that does his Commandments
[1:24:41] you have a right to enter into the tree
[1:24:42] of life or into the city now brother
[1:24:44] brandham just tied water baptism and
[1:24:48] communion to this
[1:24:50] blessing think about that now yes water
[1:24:53] baptism and communion has been tied into
[1:24:56] uh uh uh Revelation 22:14 blessed are
[1:24:59] they that do his Commandments that they
[1:25:00] may have a right to the tree of life and
[1:25:02] may enter in through the gates of the
[1:25:04] city he says this blessed is those
[1:25:06] blessed is he that does his Commandments
[1:25:08] you have a right to enter into the tree
[1:25:09] of life or into that City the holy city
[1:25:11] for without are dogs whoremongers and so
[1:25:14] forth which is to be a cast away and
[1:25:17] then the communion service is always a
[1:25:19] real strict one because it brings us to
[1:25:22] a Showdown see as we'll read in a little
[1:25:25] while in the scripture now I I wanted to
[1:25:30] uh just uh bring out this he said there
[1:25:32] were two things one was water baptism
[1:25:35] and one was communion I would like to
[1:25:37] take a man uh this section on water
[1:25:40] baptism right now now if if you were
[1:25:42] listening closely I just gave you two
[1:25:45] more
[1:25:47] answers the first one was
[1:25:49] what the second one was the third one
[1:25:53] was
[1:25:55] hello I want to talk about water baptism
[1:25:58] first and then I'll come back and talk
[1:26:00] about
[1:26:05] communion we have a problem in
[1:26:12] church not this
[1:26:15] church but
[1:26:18] denominations there's two different ways
[1:26:21] that were taught in scripture to baptize
[1:26:25] and it's created a really really big
[1:26:28] problem in Matthew 28 we have uh what
[1:26:34] Jesus
[1:26:35] said and this is what Jesus
[1:26:39] said Jesus came and spake unto them
[1:26:43] saying all power is given unto
[1:26:46] me in heaven and in
[1:26:51] Earth
[1:26:53] I don't know if we caught it yet but if
[1:26:55] all
[1:26:56] power was given to Jesus who was
[1:27:00] standing on the earth what he was saying
[1:27:03] that the power that you think God got is
[1:27:07] now in
[1:27:09] me now the denominations of that day the
[1:27:13] Pharisees and Sadducees would have had a
[1:27:15] maor problem with that they actually
[1:27:18] wanted to kill Jesus because he said he
[1:27:20] was the son of God which me in their
[1:27:23] teachings that he was God yes
[1:27:26] sir and here Jesus is making all these
[1:27:29] claims and they was having big problems
[1:27:31] with this right now look he says he says
[1:27:34] and um uh uh say all power is given unto
[1:27:37] me in heaven go ye therefore teach All
[1:27:40] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:27:43] the father and of the son and of the
[1:27:47] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:27:50] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[1:27:51] and I'm with you always even until the
[1:27:53] end of the world Amen you go to the
[1:27:55] average church today to a baptism
[1:27:57] service they will be baptizing people
[1:28:00] according to Matthew 28 and9 sir and
[1:28:04] they will say we're doing this because
[1:28:07] Jesus said
[1:28:11] it Peter was standing right there yes
[1:28:14] sir and heard Jesus see this and then
[1:28:18] after Pentecost 10 days after Jesus died
[1:28:21] rose again I mean here here Peter comes
[1:28:23] along and comes up with this new
[1:28:25] doctrine in 10
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] days how did Peter get
[1:28:32] this Peter comes along and he says
[1:28:36] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:28:38] know sure that God ha made that same
[1:28:41] Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord
[1:28:44] and
[1:28:45] Christ it says now when they heard this
[1:28:48] they were pricked in their hearts and
[1:28:49] they said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:28:51] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:28:53] we do then Peter said to them
[1:28:56] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:28:59] in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:29:04] for the remission of of of sins and ye
[1:29:06] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:08] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:29:10] children and to all that are far off
[1:29:12] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:29:14] call did Peter have it wrong 10 days
[1:29:17] Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[1:29:19] did Peter have it right
[1:29:24] Peter had an
[1:29:26] understanding he knew who the son
[1:29:30] was how do we know Peter knew who the
[1:29:32] son was because a question was asked yes
[1:29:35] sir
[1:29:38] who do men say that I the son of man
[1:29:45] am some say you Elias some say
[1:29:50] Jeremiah one of the the prophets they
[1:29:52] don't know who you is he say I'm tired
[1:29:54] of even hearing what they got to say
[1:29:56] they don't even they they can't figure
[1:29:57] this out but who
[1:30:02] do who do you say that I the son of man
[1:30:07] am and nobody nobody had nothing to say
[1:30:10] nobody nobody you talking about a half
[1:30:12] hour
[1:30:13] silence cuz they was afraid to give the
[1:30:16] wrong answer but Peter there was
[1:30:18] something special about Peter man he was
[1:30:21] all over over the place but he was a
[1:30:22] special man yes
[1:30:24] sir y'all ain't going to say
[1:30:27] nothing I got something to
[1:30:33] say thou art the
[1:30:36] Christ the son of the Living
[1:30:41] God then Peter got a blessed are thou
[1:30:46] Simon bar
[1:30:49] Jonah Flesh and Blood have have not
[1:30:52] revealed this to thee but my Father in
[1:30:56] Heaven has brought this to you and
[1:30:59] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:31:04] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:31:06] that's right all
[1:31:08] right Peter knew who the son was and he
[1:31:12] knew if if I know who the son is he say
[1:31:14] baptize in the name of the Father the
[1:31:16] Son the Holy Ghost I know who the son is
[1:31:18] I guess I can figure out the other
[1:31:19] two because he also said all power was
[1:31:22] given to him yes the son had all the
[1:31:25] power that God had it was in him right
[1:31:28] so I got to figured out I know what the
[1:31:30] name of the father I know what the name
[1:31:32] of the son and I I know the name of the
[1:31:34] Holy Ghost the name
[1:31:38] isus Jesus Christ so he didn't have it
[1:31:41] wrong he had it right and the church has
[1:31:43] missed it all these years thinking that
[1:31:46] they doing God a service sir baptizing
[1:31:48] people the wrong way yes sir you know in
[1:31:50] the book of Acts 19 there were some
[1:31:52] people baptized under John's baptism and
[1:31:54] they were
[1:31:55] told you got to be re-baptized
[1:31:59] and I want to tell you if you've been
[1:32:01] baptized this way you need to be
[1:32:04] re-baptized
[1:32:07] amen you want to go to heaven you want
[1:32:10] the Holy Ghost you want the token you
[1:32:13] want the blessings of God
[1:32:16] be full obedience entitles you to the
[1:32:20] Token brother random made a statement
[1:32:23] and I'll just share this quickly says
[1:32:25] it's like you if I hired you to do some
[1:32:28] work for
[1:32:29] me and uh or you got hired by a boss or
[1:32:32] whatever and he they had you do some
[1:32:33] work and he says uh now I'mma pay you at
[1:32:36] the end of the week and you looking
[1:32:37] forward to that paycheck and then he
[1:32:38] write a paycheck and sign it
[1:32:42] boss he just signs it boss he said now
[1:32:45] take it down there to the to the to the
[1:32:47] to the bank now his name is not boss he
[1:32:49] he he is the boss but his name is not
[1:32:51] boss but tell you to take it down there
[1:32:52] and cash it in the name of the boss now
[1:32:55] you already know before you get that
[1:32:56] check to the bank the bank going to turn
[1:32:58] you around and say uhuh ain't no way you
[1:32:59] going to get this signed or let's say if
[1:33:01] he signed it with his right name but he
[1:33:03] wrote it out to
[1:33:04] you Jane do or John do your name is not
[1:33:09] Jane do or John do ain't no way the bank
[1:33:11] uncast that check right hallelujah amen
[1:33:14] so it's not it's a useless check if it's
[1:33:17] written in the name of boss or if it's
[1:33:19] written to the wrong name that's the
[1:33:21] truth brother all
[1:33:23] right the
[1:33:25] baptism is useless if it is not done in
[1:33:29] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:35] Christ brother brandom say this is what
[1:33:37] we need to do and see again another
[1:33:40] reason why God had to send a
[1:33:42] prophet to help us understand that even
[1:33:44] their baptism that they was teaching us
[1:33:47] was wrong God want to turn our hearts
[1:33:49] back to this and when you look in the
[1:33:52] book of Acts nobody nobody in scripture
[1:33:56] ever been baptized like this not one
[1:33:59] example everybody in the book of Acts
[1:34:02] was right here amen truth brother amen
[1:34:05] amen amen amen am and here's another one
[1:34:09] I I'm G come back to this one next week
[1:34:11] but I'mma say it now what yeah I'mma say
[1:34:13] it
[1:34:15] now John did not restore baptism that's
[1:34:19] right right right amen and I'm going to
[1:34:22] just leave it like that John didn't
[1:34:24] restore baptism because his baptism
[1:34:26] didn't even last until this came when
[1:34:30] this came they they told John they told
[1:34:32] John John's people that were baptized
[1:34:34] say you need to be re-baptized
[1:34:36] cuz a lot of people try to say John was
[1:34:38] the one that Jesus was talking about say
[1:34:40] there's Elijah coming to restore all
[1:34:42] things well John didn't even restore
[1:34:44] baptism
[1:34:46] true but I know a
[1:34:48] prophet oh Lord have mercy that happened
[1:34:52] to preach on this and when he preached
[1:34:55] it just by the mere fact that him
[1:34:57] preaching it and US receiving it it was
[1:34:59] restored
[1:35:06] AML let's go
[1:35:09] forward so we got tithing and we got
[1:35:13] baptism out the way so far I got two

[1:36:27] brother Brandon makes a statement says
[1:36:28] John said I
[1:36:29] saw the holy city the New Jerusalem
[1:36:32] descending Out of Heaven as a bride
[1:36:34] Adorn for her husband and where did it
[1:36:37] sett along just exactly like it did on
[1:36:40] there upon the Earth Jesus was part of
[1:36:43] that Earth that the Holy Ghost descended
[1:36:48] upon is that right and remain AED upon
[1:36:52] him forever it never can leave him it's
[1:36:55] always there he and God are one always
[1:36:58] has to remain and so John saw the holy
[1:37:02] city the New Jerusalem descending like a
[1:37:06] comet or a
[1:37:08] dove the same way a d that the spirit
[1:37:11] descended upon brother uh upon the Lord
[1:37:14] Jesus when he was baptized by John
[1:37:16] brother R said the New Jerusalem it
[1:37:18] descended oh my the holy New Jerusalem
[1:37:22] descending like a comet or like a dove
[1:37:24] the same way it descended on Jesus is
[1:37:28] descending on
[1:37:33] us look at this it says coming down out
[1:37:36] of heaven and setting Upon A redeemed
[1:37:39] entire Earth to do what to claim every
[1:37:42] attribute that he made the Earth for
[1:37:44] every man that was represented in the
[1:37:47] eternity and every woman is redeemed
[1:37:49] then look at it she's been scoured and
[1:37:53] burned by fire Jesus in his fiery
[1:37:56] Temptations in the wilderness for 40
[1:37:57] days and that after that notice it was
[1:38:00] ready for his ministry then now I like
[1:38:05] the way brother brandham used the the
[1:38:07] the description of it descended like a
[1:38:11] comet or a dove and I I just looked at
[1:38:14] that word comment the Holy Spirit Drew
[1:38:16] my attention to it and I looked at that
[1:38:18] word and um comment
[1:38:22] uh the definition is a a noun for and it
[1:38:25] deals with astronomy it's a Celestial
[1:38:27] body moving about the sun usually in
[1:38:31] highly Ecentric orbit consisting of a
[1:38:35] Central Mass surrounded by an envelope
[1:38:38] of dust and gas that may form a
[1:38:42] tail that streams away from the Sun so
[1:38:46] this Comet forms a tail as it streams
[1:38:50] away away from the Sun now I went a
[1:38:55] little deeper and I said what's the
[1:38:56] origin of this word Comet and uh and
[1:38:58] what we got here it's uh a middle
[1:39:01] English from 1150 to 1200 Middle English
[1:39:05] ketee which uh angl French or old French
[1:39:09] uh Latin is KES or
[1:39:12] Keta uh Greek uh uh in the Greek is
[1:39:16] ketes which
[1:39:18] means wearing long long
[1:39:23] hair so it descends from God like a
[1:39:27] comet
[1:39:29] wearing long
[1:39:32] hair Hallelujah and and then it says the
[1:39:35] other definition it's a varant stem of
[1:39:38] coming to let one hairs
[1:39:43] grow now I thought that was pretty
[1:39:46] unique that this city descends from
[1:39:48] heaven like a comet and a comet the
[1:39:52] original definition is to wear long hair
[1:39:55] or to let one's hairs
[1:39:58] grow this next slide says
[1:40:01] this and God's only provided place of
[1:40:03] worship brother random says but every
[1:40:06] little
[1:40:07] jot everything you must be faithful in

[1:43:01] Commandments of God that they might have
[1:43:02] a right ATT and do all God said if it's
[1:43:04] said for women to have long hair now the
[1:43:07] Bible say for me for women to have long
[1:43:09] hair but it tell men to cut their
[1:43:12] hair amen do all that God said brother
[1:43:16] bradam

[1:43:26] get I want you to get that and not only
[1:43:29] not not not not not not not only that uh
[1:43:31] I mean what what what what what we're
[1:43:33] going to read here in 1 Corinthians what
[1:43:35] it tells us there a man is tied to that
[1:43:37] too if you want to enter into this city
[1:43:40] you going to have to follow the word of
[1:43:42] God Amen remember I told you John John
[1:43:45] just didn't eat a page out the book he
[1:43:48] didn't just eat a chapter out the book
[1:43:50] he ate the whole
[1:43:53] book amen we gonna read it anyway I know
[1:43:56] it got quiet but it's it's it's
[1:43:58] okay 1 Corinthians 11 and and here's
[1:44:02] another thing I want to say because
[1:44:03] people think that when um they Le the
[1:44:07] message they think brother Brandon made
[1:44:09] all this stuff up hisself and came up
[1:44:12] like like like there was no Bible
[1:44:13] existing before brother brandom came no
[1:44:16] his job was to turn our hearts back to
[1:44:18] the Bible that means he had to read the
[1:44:21] Bible and do y'all realize God gave us a
[1:44:23] prophet that couldn't even
[1:44:26] read now that's that's a that's a
[1:44:29] miracle God give you a prophet that
[1:44:31] can't even read when the man first
[1:44:33] started preaching he had his girlfriend
[1:44:34] reading scripture for him he standing up
[1:44:37] there trying to preach and you know read
[1:44:40] look at what it say look at what it say
[1:44:42] read he couldn't even read it
[1:44:46] himself but somehow God got him some
[1:44:49] education that beyond the seventh grade
[1:44:52] because then the angel would come to him
[1:44:53] at certain times and tell them not and
[1:44:55] not only angel would tell them what to
[1:44:56] read but the angel would actually come
[1:44:58] and turn the pages of the
[1:45:02] Bible you read right here rain falling
[1:45:06] on the just and the unjust now you can
[1:45:09] understand
[1:45:10] that you can see why this in the
[1:45:12] Pentecostal realm the spirit will
[1:45:14] fallowing this one man and fall this
[1:45:15] other man and it's and it's it's right
[1:45:17] but one got an evil spirit one got a
[1:45:18] good spirit you see why yeah it's right
[1:45:21] here in the
[1:45:22] Bible exactly right oh glory to
[1:45:25] God let's go back and read what the
[1:45:27] scripture tells us be ye follows of me
[1:45:31] even as I also am of Christ now and let
[1:45:34] me just pref preface this by saying Paul
[1:45:37] said well what did he
[1:45:40] say
[1:45:42] hallelujah Paul
[1:45:45] said be ye followers of me even as I
[1:45:49] also am of of
[1:45:51] Christ now I Praise You Brethren that
[1:45:54] you remember me in all things and keep
[1:45:56] the ordinances as I delivered them to
[1:46:00] you even Paul call this an ordinance
[1:46:02] look at but I would have you to know
[1:46:05] that the head of every man is Christ
[1:46:07] amen glory to God and the head of the
[1:46:10] woman is the
[1:46:13] man amen amen amen amen I know that one
[1:46:18] I mean I remember that brother coming
[1:46:19] here he passed away brother brother
[1:46:22] Sorano but but before he went on the
[1:46:24] glory god let him pass right through
[1:46:26] West Palm Beach and he shared something
[1:46:28] that night with us that I'll never
[1:46:30] forget he he say he say he say uh sister
[1:46:34] God call you to be a helpmate to your
[1:46:37] husband and what that means is that you
[1:46:39] could have a job that's paying you
[1:46:42] $1,000 a week and your husband could
[1:46:45] have a job that's paying him $100 a week
[1:46:49] you know what your, a week is to do
[1:46:53] help your
[1:46:59] husband sir he ain't get too many amens
[1:47:01] that
[1:47:03] night but what the man said was the
[1:47:07] truth yes sir and when we recognize
[1:47:10] these things it makes it very easy for
[1:47:12] the houses to flow the way God ordained
[1:47:15] it to
[1:47:17] flow amen amen just talk to a brother
[1:47:20] the other day and and and you know you
[1:47:22] got to be careful now with these things
[1:47:24] because he was he he say you know my
[1:47:25] wife made more than me all my life and
[1:47:27] and a lot of brothers get offended when
[1:47:28] their wife make more money they said it
[1:47:30] didn't bother
[1:47:35] me and I was kind of weighing
[1:47:39] that it should have it should have
[1:47:42] caused you to want to do a little bit
[1:47:45] more amen maybe you should have wanted
[1:47:48] to go back to school or maybe you should
[1:47:49] have want to do something so you can
[1:47:50] take care of your family but not all
[1:47:52] these years of her doing that right I
[1:47:54] mean it might be a season but you ought
[1:47:56] to pray that God give you an idea that
[1:47:59] you can be a blessing to your wife the
[1:48:00] way she blessing
[1:48:04] youly because there's a spirit that gets
[1:48:06] upon men nowadays that they looking for
[1:48:08] women that'll take care of
[1:48:10] them come on your mama took care of
[1:48:14] you that's
[1:48:17] right now you're a man and you need to
[1:48:20] take care of
[1:48:32] us I would have you to know that the
[1:48:35] head of every man is Christ and the head
[1:48:36] of the woman is the man and the head of
[1:48:39] Christ is God every man praying or
[1:48:41] prophesying having his head covered
[1:48:42] dishonor his head now I'm going just
[1:48:45] inject this uh they used to use this
[1:48:47] scripture all the time men come to
[1:48:49] church with hats s in church M take your
[1:48:52] hat off when you come into the church
[1:48:55] any building you take your hat off right
[1:48:58] nowadays we don't forgot about this but
[1:49:00] you take you're in the House of Prayer
[1:49:02] take your hat off sir amen amen every
[1:49:07] man praying and prophesy having his head
[1:49:09] covered dishonor his head and your head
[1:49:13] is Christ right but every woman that
[1:49:15] pray or prophesy with her head uncovered
[1:49:17] dishonor her head for that is even all
[1:49:21] uh uh that that that is even all one as
[1:49:24] if she were shaven now now here we're
[1:49:27] going to we're going to see this because
[1:49:28] uh Paul Paul is telling us the what is
[1:49:31] her her uh her covering we're going to
[1:49:34] see that later it's not the Hat of the
[1:49:36] doily that they put that's not your
[1:49:38] covering but the scripture actually
[1:49:40] tells you what your covering is let's
[1:49:43] keep reading the Bible for if the woman
[1:49:46] be not covered let her also be Shor but
[1:49:49] if it be a shame for a woman to be sh or
[1:49:51] shave and let her be covered now we need
[1:49:53] to we need to understand back in these
[1:49:55] times it was a shame for a woman to have
[1:49:57] cut
[1:49:58] hair oh Lord let me go a little f it was
[1:50:01] a shame for a woman to have hair but in
[1:50:04] society today it is very accepted but
[1:50:07] yet it's against the
[1:50:09] Bible we want to come back in line with
[1:50:11] what the Bible say yes sir amen look at
[1:50:14] this now it says for a man indeed ought
[1:50:17] not to cover his head uh for as much as
[1:50:21] he is the image and glory of God but the
[1:50:23] woman is the glory of the man next it
[1:50:26] says this he says uh Paul says for the
[1:50:29] man is not of the woman but the woman of
[1:50:31] the man neither was the Man created for
[1:50:33] the woman but the woman for the man for
[1:50:36] this cause ought the woman to have power
[1:50:38] on her head because of the Angels
[1:50:40] nevertheless neither is The Man Without
[1:50:42] The Woman neither the woman without the
[1:50:44] man in the Lord for as the woman is of
[1:50:47] the man even so is the man also by the
[1:50:49] woman but all things of God judging
[1:50:52] yourselves amen is it commonly that a
[1:50:54] woman pray unto God uncovered do not
[1:50:57] even nature itself teach you that if a
[1:50:59] man have long hair that mean he's
[1:51:01] supposed to cut his hair if he have long
[1:51:02] hair it is a shame unto him but if a
[1:51:06] woman have long hair it is a glory to
[1:51:09] heren for her hair is given her for a
[1:51:14] covering brother brandham said in this
[1:51:16] New Jerusalem it was descending like a
[1:51:19] comet
[1:51:20] and the comet was like a streak going
[1:51:22] away from the sun which kind of showed
[1:51:25] long
[1:51:27] hair you remember that that that was in
[1:51:29] the definition and and and and in the
[1:51:31] original Greek is like it's it's to have
[1:51:34] long hair so so here God is even
[1:51:38] concerned about our looks sir even in in
[1:51:41] in Revelation he's concerned she comes
[1:51:44] down this New Jerusalem comes down from
[1:51:47] God and brother Bram says like a comet
[1:51:49] like like a woman with long hair let me
[1:51:53] just let me just this last verse but if
[1:51:55] if any man seems to be contentious we
[1:51:57] have no such custom neither the Churches
[1:51:59] of God but he said it comes down from
[1:52:02] God like a woman with long hair last
[1:52:06] week not last week not last week two
[1:52:08] weeks ago when I preached the last thing
[1:52:10] I did was I I I had us listen to a
[1:52:13] portion of the tape
[1:52:15] Masterpiece and and before I had y'all
[1:52:17] do that I I had this sermon already
[1:52:19] prepared with these quotes in it but I
[1:52:21] felt it would be a real good connection
[1:52:23] because if if New Jerusalem was coming
[1:52:25] down like a comet like a woman with long
[1:52:29] hair then the prophet actually goes on
[1:52:31] to show us that he saw the bride hello
[1:52:35] and when he saw the bride guess what she
[1:52:39] had let's just go let's go to the next
[1:52:42] slide here I'm just read I don't think
[1:52:44] I'll be able to read all this but let me
[1:52:45] just get get get as much as I can it
[1:52:47] says I fell into trance when I did there
[1:52:49] there was somebody with me I didn't see
[1:52:51] the person it was just a voice and I
[1:52:54] looked and as I looked this way he said
[1:52:56] the bride would come in view for
[1:52:59] preview and I looked coming to me and I
[1:53:01] seen the most prettiest bunch of clean
[1:53:03] dressed women I ever seen in my life but
[1:53:05] each one of them look like was dressed
[1:53:06] different they all had long
[1:53:10] hair now now I want to I want to I want
[1:53:12] to I want to just uh let me just finish
[1:53:15] reading this a little he says they all
[1:53:16] had long hair uh brother brother Donnie
[1:53:19] re made a statement he went to Africa
[1:53:22] one time to minister and um somebody was
[1:53:26] questioning him about you know some of
[1:53:28] the sisters over there in Africa had
[1:53:29] question him out you know you know
[1:53:32] um uh here the quote is saying you know
[1:53:34] they all had long hair and you know uh
[1:53:37] our hair is a little different our hair
[1:53:40] is a little different it's not like
[1:53:41] everybody else's hair and brother Donnie
[1:53:43] you know told the sisters something that
[1:53:45] I think every sister need to know he
[1:53:48] said un cut

[1:53:58] uncut hair see that's one you should
[1:54:00] have wrote down right there un uncut

[1:54:06] your your your what they call them your
[1:54:09] wigs
[1:54:11] your uh the the extensions braids I mean
[1:54:17] and I I'm not speaking against that
[1:54:19] sometimes we I I I'm not speaking
[1:54:21] sisters want to look pretty a't nothing
[1:54:22] wrong with you looking pretty but if you
[1:54:24] want to just be natural and you know
[1:54:27] that my hair ain't long as everybody
[1:54:29] else I want you to do I want you to

[1:56:54] in a mixed audience to say what was
[1:56:56] taking place and you'll have to read
[1:56:57] between the lines but when the women
[1:56:58] were coming the lead of the of them was
[1:57:00] a witch she had a great long nose and a
[1:57:03] great big mouth all of them was dressed

[1:57:10] strap they had something holding below
[1:57:12] them like this holding below them and
[1:57:14] all of this part was exposed and each
[1:57:16] one had hair cut up real short that was
[1:57:19] the church not the bride the bride John
[1:57:23] sing coming down it was like a comet she
[1:57:26] had long hair sir look at this amen they

[1:57:44] paper was what was hold in hold in front
[1:57:47] of them but when they passed the review
[1:57:49] stand in the back of them and to see the
[1:57:51] way they were going in the foremost in
[1:57:52] the back part how they were acting I
[1:57:54] said is that the church it just made
[1:57:57] brother brandom upset he he's like H how
[1:58:00] could I preach and only produce this
[1:58:02] brother brother um ansy said it last

[1:58:08] a gift to your
[1:58:10] pastor live what he
[1:58:14] preaching if you want to give a gift to
[1:58:16] your Prophet live what he preaching
[1:58:19] right amen he goes on and say he says
[1:58:21] and I just started to bow my head and he
[1:58:23] said
[1:58:25] wait the bride must come again and I
[1:58:27] looked and here they come again and they
[1:58:29] passed by sweet looking little ladies
[1:58:31] they was all looking right at me as they
[1:58:33] passed by I noticed each woman was dress
[1:58:35] different and one in the back had kind
[1:58:37] of long hair hanging down and had it
[1:58:40] rolled around like this might have been
[1:58:42] German or something like that and I
[1:58:44] watched them and then as they started
[1:58:45] leaving two or three of them in the back
[1:58:48] started
[1:58:49] to get out of step and I was going to I
[1:58:52] was going to holler at
[1:58:55] them but before he could
[1:58:58] holler they got back they were trying
[1:59:03] they was trying to get back and step
[1:59:06] again that's where we started the year
[1:59:08] off get back and step and I believe
[1:59:09] there's some folk in here trying to get
[1:59:12] back and step again God just brought you
[1:59:14] a word of encouragement to help you in
[1:59:17] your trying
[1:59:22] [Applause]
[1:59:26] Hallelujah I only gave y'all three but
[1:59:29] how many did you ask
[1:59:31] for all right here's the last
[1:59:35] one remember brother brandom said
[1:59:38] there's two Commandments that's just
[1:59:40] left us two material things one of them
[1:59:42] is is the communion service and the
[1:59:44] others water
[1:59:45] baptism and I believe the Bible said
[1:59:47] blessed is he that does his Commandments
[1:59:49] you have a right to enter into tree your
[1:59:50] life or into that City and the holy and
[1:59:52] the holy city for without of dogs wh
[1:59:53] mongers and so forth which uh is to be a
[1:59:56] cast away and the communion service is
[1:59:58] always a real strict one I'm at the very
[2:00:00] bottom of that screen a real strict one
[2:00:02] because it brings us to Showdown see
[2:00:05] we'll read it in a little while in the
[2:00:08] scripture so let's read it in the
[2:00:10] scripture and
[2:00:15] uh the reason a
[2:00:17] showdown can Comm Union 1 Corinthians
[2:00:20] 11:23 says for I received of the
[2:00:23] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[2:00:25] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:00:27] in which he was betrayed took bread when
[2:00:29] he had given thanks he break it and said
[2:00:30] take eat this is my body which is broken
[2:00:32] for you this do in remembrance of me
[2:00:35] after the same manner also he took the
[2:00:37] cup when he had s saying this cup is the
[2:00:39] New Testament in my blood this do you as
[2:00:40] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:00:42] me for as often as you eat this bread
[2:00:44] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[2:00:46] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[2:00:48] shall eat eat this bread and drink this
[2:00:50] cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty
[2:00:52] of the body and blood of the
[2:00:55] Lord First Corinthians uh 11 uh I'm
[2:00:59] going on verse 28 but let a man examine
[2:01:01] himself so communion is a very strict
[2:01:03] service because you're supposed to
[2:01:04] examine yourself where are you before
[2:01:06] you just you don't you you don't want to
[2:01:07] be living an ungodly life and taking
[2:01:10] communion you can lose your life that
[2:01:13] way you have to examine yourself make
[2:01:15] sure that you're living and you're
[2:01:16] following in the Commandments of the
[2:01:17] Lord in every area examine yourself
[2:01:20] because you don't want to drop dead in
[2:01:21] the church some people actually Avid
[2:01:24] Church on the communion service cuz I I
[2:01:26] know you know few things uh don't don't
[2:01:28] do just get them right if you need to go
[2:01:31] repent to somebody make it right with
[2:01:32] them and just come on take communion but
[2:01:34] make sure you're living the right type
[2:01:36] of life exactly right amen it says for
[2:01:39] he that eateth and if you know somebody
[2:01:41] ain't living right now don't go and yank
[2:01:43] them out the communion line they watch
[2:01:46] them go through but then after after
[2:01:47] communion service sit down sister
[2:01:50] brother you know you know and I know
[2:01:54] that post that you just put
[2:01:56] up Pastor probably didn't see that but I
[2:01:58] saw that and that ain't that's not
[2:02:00] becoming of a
[2:02:02] Christian if you're going to take
[2:02:04] communion you got to you got to be
[2:02:06] mindful of things like this amen let a
[2:02:09] man examine himself and so let him eat
[2:02:11] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[2:02:13] he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[2:02:14] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[2:02:16] and not Discerning the Lord's body for
[2:02:19] this caused many of weak and sickly
[2:02:20] among you and many sleep for I if we
[2:02:23] would judge ourselves we should not be
[2:02:24] judged and and notice that you get you
[2:02:27] give an opportunity to kind of do a
[2:02:28] self-examination but if you fail in your
[2:02:31] self-examination somebody be there to
[2:02:33] help you amen and I'm not saying pick on
[2:02:36] people for every little
[2:02:37] thing you ain't perfect either and when
[2:02:40] you're pointing one finger at one person
[2:02:43] if you do it like this if you do it like
[2:02:47] this
[2:02:49] for a pointing back at you so remember
[2:02:53] get the
[2:02:58] moat out your own eye before you try to
[2:03:01] get it out of somebody else's all right
[2:03:04] all
[2:03:05] right for this caus many are weak and
[2:03:07] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[2:03:08] we judged ourselves we should not be
[2:03:10] judged but when we are judged we're
[2:03:12] chasing the Lord that we should not be
[2:03:13] condemned with the world wherefore my
[2:03:15] brethren when you come together to eat
[2:03:16] ter one for another and if any man
[2:03:18] hunger let eat at home that you come not
[2:03:20] together unto condemnation and the rest
[2:03:24] will I set in order when I
[2:03:26] come just one more scripture I want to
[2:03:29] give you related to communion Jesus said
[2:03:31] this in Matthew 26 is so important for
[2:03:34] us to be able to do
[2:03:36] communion it it's it's it's it's keeping
[2:03:38] the Commandments of God it's keeping the
[2:03:40] ordinance of God and um and and and here
[2:03:44] you know the thing that reason it's so
[2:03:46] important Jesus tells us as they were
[2:03:48] eating
[2:03:49] Jesus Took bread and blessed it and
[2:03:50] break it and gave it to the disciples
[2:03:52] and said take eat this is my body right
[2:03:54] before he was getting ready to go to a
[2:03:56] cross they had the communion Supper The
[2:03:59] Last Supper uh and the Bible says he
[2:04:02] took the cup gave thanks and gave it to
[2:04:03] him saying drink ye all of it for this
[2:04:06] is my body I mean this is my blood of
[2:04:09] the new testament which is shed for many
[2:04:10] for the remission of sins but I say unto
[2:04:13] you I will not drink henceforth of this
[2:04:16] fruit of the vine until the day
[2:04:20] when I drink it new with you in my
[2:04:23] father's Kingdom that City whose Builder
[2:04:25] and make is God we going to actually
[2:04:28] join Jesus in
[2:04:30] communion so we got to have communion
[2:04:33] here if we're going to join him there
[2:04:37] and notice this and when they had sung
[2:04:39] in hymn they went out into the Mount of
[2:04:41] Olives when I was teaching this a few
[2:04:44] weeks ago and I and I I I brought this
[2:04:46] lesson out to the brothers in uh on the
[2:04:48] line uh I said my just a a conviction
[2:04:51] hit me because we haven't done communion
[2:04:53] in roughly three
[2:04:54] years it just hit me and and and I want
[2:04:57] to be blessed keeping the Commandments
[2:05:00] of the
[2:05:01] Lord so I just begin to pray about this
[2:05:04] and and I start talking in you know
[2:05:07] spiritual things uh God has uh given the
[2:05:10] church a deacon and not just Deacon but
[2:05:13] deacons is what we what we're looking
[2:05:14] for Spiritual things I always try to run
[2:05:16] spiritual things concerning the church
[2:05:18] by the deacons that's what I'm supposed
[2:05:19] to do not just take these decisions on
[2:05:21] myself we we sit and we talk you know
[2:05:23] and and and go through so I was uh I was
[2:05:26] talking you know with brother Troy about
[2:05:28] something and and before I made it to
[2:05:29] him I was just also from a financial
[2:05:32] perspective I'm looking like how can we
[2:05:33] do this communion how we I I feel
[2:05:37] compelled we need to do this and I don't
[2:05:39] know how to do this in this school this
[2:05:41] is our temporary location until God
[2:05:43] opens up our next door but while we here
[2:05:45] we might as well do everything God told
[2:05:46] us to do how how can we get this
[2:05:50] done Lord show us what can we do so the
[2:05:54] one thing we know about communion is
[2:05:55] that it was done in the evening time yes
[2:05:59] so if we rented the school on uh Sunday
[2:06:02] we have to have the janitor come back in
[2:06:03] the evening time to try to do communion
[2:06:05] said that's going to be very very
[2:06:07] difficult so what we looked at is a day
[2:06:09] that we already
[2:06:11] here in the
[2:06:13] evening Wednesday
[2:06:16] night and we decided
[2:06:20] that we're going to try our first
[2:06:21] communion on the first Wednesday night
[2:06:25] of
[2:06:27] [Applause]
[2:06:31] February and we're going to have
[2:06:32] communion feet washing and see how it
[2:06:34] goes but that'll be the service for that
[2:06:36] night it'll be a communion service first
[2:06:39] Wednesday in February and I come to find
[2:06:42] that there was so many other Saints in
[2:06:44] this same channel looking forward to
[2:06:46] trying to have a communion God is
[2:06:48] answered your prayer amen and we coming
[2:06:51] right here to this church and let me
[2:06:53] tell you something I Believe full
[2:06:55] obedience so the whole word of God
[2:06:58] entitles you to the Token you have time
[2:07:01] to do a self-examination right now so
[2:07:02] you going to be a part of that first
[2:07:04] communion service I think is going to be
[2:07:06] very special amen
[2:07:10] amen we'll be here on the first
[2:07:12] Wednesday of February communion spirit
[2:07:16] and Truth Tabernacle Hallelujah let me
[2:07:19] just read this last thing brother brand
[2:07:21] says this in a prayer testimony Los
[2:07:22] Angeles California says and you said I
[2:07:24] will drink more the fruit of the vine
[2:07:27] till I eat and drink a new with you in
[2:07:29] my father's Kingdom when we come there
[2:07:31] to that great wedding supper we look
[2:07:34] across the table at one another oh God
[2:07:37] just to slip a little handshake over
[2:07:39] while the tears of joy rolls down our
[2:07:41] cheeks the King come out in his Beauty
[2:07:44] and wipe all the tears from our eyes and
[2:07:46] said don't cry it's all over now now
[2:07:49] there'll never be no more healing
[2:07:50] campaigns up there no more tired
[2:07:52] restless nights no more wheelchairs
[2:07:55] Graves sickness oh for that great day
[2:07:57] and then you'll say enter into the joy
[2:07:59] of Lord oh I long to hear that at that
[2:08:01] day father and now while we're here
[2:08:04] together and all of us longing the same
[2:08:06] thing make us true stewards may we shape
[2:08:10] Our Lives by
[2:08:12] self-control that will know by the help
[2:08:14] of the Holy Spirit to have a full
[2:08:17] confidence that Jesus Jesus will
[2:08:19] say Well done my good and faithful
[2:08:22] servant at that day I
[2:08:26] learned when I was in school for my
[2:08:30] degree my teacher said when you're
[2:08:32] speaking before people tell them what
[2:08:36] you're going to tell them and then tell
[2:08:42] them and then at the
[2:08:45] end tell them what you told him
[2:08:49] blessed are they that do his
[2:08:51] Commandments that they may have a right
[2:08:53] to the tree of life and enter in through
[2:08:56] the graes into the city it's not the
[2:08:59] thing you do it's the little things you
[2:09:02] leave undone remember CH a chain is only
[2:09:06] strongest at its weakest length behold
[2:09:10] blessed are they that do all the
[2:09:11] Commandments of God that they might have
[2:09:13] a right to enter life we talked today
[2:09:16] about tithing
[2:09:20] we talked about sisters allowing your
[2:09:21] hair to grow and brothers cut your
[2:09:25] hair water
[2:09:28] baptism communion and feet
[2:09:34] washing blessed are they that do his
[2:09:36] Commandments that they may have a right
