we've heard in the book of Isaiah chapter one it says who had believed our report amen and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed brother sister there is power Amen in this report praise be to God is a battle amen of report I don't know what report You' have been given I don't know what has been spoken about your life but I'm here to tell you this morning that there is amen a report that surpasses any other report and this morning brother there's going to be a showdown between reports I don't care what report the doctor has given you I don't care what financial report you have I don't care what report you have from work brother I'm here to tell you there is a report amen that supersedes any other report there is a report brother sister that overrides any other report brother sister let me tell you this morning amen there was one time Amen in our church this you know the church that you know I was talking about down in K and working with our pastor brother sister there was a sister there she was given a report she was given a report and the doctor said she he needed to come for an operation brother amen and one day amen it was only a Sunday like this I preached a message that I titled looking to a Divine promise brother in this message amen I was quoting what the prophet says one time he was invited to go to a hospital amen and when he went to hospital there were I believe there was a child that was dying in hospital this child had de teria amen and he goes as he went into the reception they say no Mr brandham you cannot go amen because you know this is very very infectious you go and give it you you know so contagious you end up giving it to your family and he says but if a Roman Catholic priest was to come you would let him go in amen and then eventually they allowed him to go in they dressed him up amen with all the protective amen clothing and he went in and when he went into this word he went in and you know the Father the I believe it was the grandfather amen of the child was very very excited amen because they had called for him they had summoned for him to come to the hospital and then as they as he got in there amen this brother believed in the power of the report what the report say he says Believers shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and the prophet came in and he all he did he didn't see no vision he didn't see anything else he just came and he read amen the scripture and then he prayed praise be to God and then this father he said this old father he says praise be to God praise be to God for healing our child but the child was lying there dying the child was lying there dying and then the little Nest that was there could not believe he says what's wrong with you how are you celebrating and thanking God when your child is dying amen and he says no no no no and she was she couldn't understand it she kept on hammering on it saying why do you deceive these poor couple amen telling them that the child is going to come amen that machine that you see there amen there's a report that says when you you see that machine coming all the way to zero amen there's not a child there's not a man that has been ever known to come out of that situation amen and this old father amen looked at this little nurse and says Oh My Darling amen you are looking amen at that machine but we are not looking to the machine we are looking to a Divine promise we are looking to a Divine promise this morning we are looking to a Divine report amen I don't care what report the doctors have said I don't care what signs they said amen there is a report that is able to override brother and I was quoting this message Amen to this sister and I said sister there was a time she was not even a message believer amen I said there is a God there's God send a prophet one time and I read that quotation and I says upon the strength of this quotation if you can believe it amen you can receive it amen if you can believe the report you can have it amen I said my sister amen you don't even need to go for that operation if you believe this report to who has believed our report Amen brother sister amen I didn't stop her from going I belied that you know she had caught it amen and brother sister she was supposed to have a gold bladder operation amen a gold bladder removal and then this was now Monday I was telling about a message quoting back to a message I preached on Sunday and the operation was to be on Friday and you know little did I know she went on Amen we used to do Zoom meetings CU we you know we testify we like to testify one onone Amen brother sister if you have encountered the power of the report you cannot hold still amen you can't hold still and this sister now she went on with the operation and you know I completely forgot about it then the following Monday we used to do meetings every Monday and then on Monday night she said hey you know what happened something happened that was very strange says I went for that operation I said oh you did says yeah I ended up going for the operation Amen on Friday and I says okay what happened says oh the operation was performed by two doctors and they took out when they took out the Gold Blood they looked and they said there's nothing in there why have we taking it off amen why have we removed it brother sister I'm here to tell you amen by just believing the she disbelieve the report amen even your unbelief will not hinder God praise be to God they didn't know what to do with it anymore why because God had performed a bloodless operation my sister amen I hear about a sister who's going for an operation praise be to God but I'm saying when you believe the report whilst you're sitting where you're sitting him there's an invisible hand that is moving amen from chair to chair that is making amen an operation performing a blood operation but I believe in this report amen this report right now as I speak is able to override whatever report that you have I don't know what report you have got but I'm here to tell you brother sister I was not supposed to be here in in Florida today I was supposed to be in Manila amen it's only last week that we bought our tickets our holiday fell through last minute and I believe it's for a purpose I believe there's somebody that God has sent me with a report somebody that has got Amen to believe the report brother it's a battle of reports it's a battle of reports that's going forth a I don't care what has been said brother sister I'm saying this report amen is able to override any other report amen Amen brother sister this is the power of the report amen we as I was preaching a few weeks ago say speaking about the power amen the Battle of this reports brother we had a sister that had you know she she she she she they had had an internal inspection she's a manager amen she's a manager this sister and she was told you know as they did the the internal you know for their company amen she's K home manager it was there was a report that was very a damning report amen they said it was so bad and she was worried about even losing a job because of a report that it come through amen and she was worried brother and she came to church on a Sunday she came to church like you have come to church today and she came to church and as she came to church the word was going on Amen about the Battle of reports brother as the word was going forth she left church on a Sunday amen and then she went home she was believing Lord what what's going to become of me brother sister but this was a internal report right but there is a a national report there's a um a regulatory board that Reg that that um regulates the the the all the UK you know Health Systems amen CQC is called they only work five days a week Monday to Friday amen but brother sister for a sister that was sitting there amen receiving everyone received a ding report on a Friday she comes to church on Sunday Amen brother sister and then she goes home the following morning amen she goes she opens up her email she says the C you see they've also written their report and this is now the absolute amen they have written the report tell saying how amazing the company was doing Amen to override an internal report brother sister these people they don't work on a Sunday amen but brother when you begin to believe the report behind the scenes as you are sited there God will give a burden to somebody to go into the office even tonight to deal with your Affairs amen this is the power of the report that's how it does you can influence what happens your boss may be at home right now all you need to do brother sister is to believe the report amen as you are believing the report God is moving elements behind the scenes God is causing somebody to lose sleep God is causing somebody to be a Restless amen why because they feel like I need to going to the office there's a case that has been forgotten but tonight amen God will make sure somebody will not sleep amen so that your case is addressed praise be to God brother and you know what it was a battle of reports amen how many believe in the Battle of report amen praise the Lord let's get into the word god let's get into the word in the Book of Mark chapter 11 we find that the Lord when he had come to Bethany amen you know he was hungry and he saw a fig tree and he went you know sold the figs and he thought you know I going have some figs and there was nothing and he cursed the Fig Tree amen and the Bible said and the disciples heard it they continued on their Journey they continued on their Journey as they continued on their Journey on their way back as they were coming amen that's verse number 20 now they are turning back from Jerusalem Amen in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away Amen brother when he cursed this fig tree you know it remained green they continued on their Journey amen the reason why Peter is now surprised see look that very tree as you cured yesterday look now it's withered away that's on the next day right but when it was cursed it continued as if nothing was happening Amen brother such is the power of the spoken word it may seem like nothing has happened amen as you leave church it may feel like aen nothing has happened it may feel like nothing has happened it may feel like you know you are still sick when you walk out of that door it may feel like you know nothing you go home and your problem is still there pra be to God bad brother what did Jesus do he spoke the spoken word amen as he spoke the spoken word amen the Bible says as it dried from The Roots praise be to God though the leaves remained green amen but it was drying from The Roots brother sisters the word is going forth your problem is dying from The Roots amen your sickness is dying from The Roots it's dying from The Roots amen that on the way back amen tomorrow as you are walking by tomorrow you will say oh that problem is gone what has happened amen it was the Battle of report amen it doesn't matter how you feel now I'm here to tell you that that if you can believe this praise be to God Amen you are going amen you may go back with the same cloth you may go back as if you're the same person but something is already happened amen God is dealing with your sickness God is dealing with your problem from its roots amen and you will just see the withering away amen it's time goes praise the Lord am amen so who has believed our report I'm just laying my background I won't be here for long amen but by the time I finish amen somebody will have their breakthrough praise be to God sir in the message wisdom versus Faith the prophet tells us you know it depends on what report you believe right I want you to understand amen whatever that you're going to believe is what you're going to see there is a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan there is a certain amount of faith that goes with Satan in order to accept Satan you got to believe Satan are you getting it so for you to be able to accept Satan and you have got to believe in Satan are you getting this brother sister how many believers do we have of Satan Amen brother if you are fearful amen you are a believer of Satan praise be to God what is that amen why am I getting that that's perfectly scriptural yeah do you know fear produces results the same way Faith produces results amen do you know that fear is the opposite of Faith others those that define fear they say it's false evidence appearing real amen the things that you see amen they regardless of how real it looks praise be to God if it's contrary to this report it's a lying vanity are you getting this am so we know that God he send Salmons like this afternoon God seon is targeted to the six sense yeah the super sense amen it's a six sense Satan Salmons they are targeted to the five senses the things that you see the things that you hear amen so that Satan's audience your natural senses and God the audience Amen to God's word is Faith yeah the six sense so God appeals to the six sense Satan appeals to the five senses so when you are afraid of the things that you're seeing God does not care about what you he didn't say did you see it he says did you believe it so the things that you hear the bad news that you hear that your family is not going to be happy amen you know your your sickness the sickness that you have I don't want to say your sickness is not yours it's the devil's sickness amen you know Satan wants you to believe you know the feelings that you have when your body is telling you that you are dying amen that's Satan preaching his sermon are you getting this one time amen as the disciples were in the boat and Jesus started walking on the water they saw him walking amen and Peter say Lord if it is you beat me to come he never thought about it he never reasoned are you getting this he started walking on the water why because it was faith that caused him to walk on the water and then Satan came with his sermon the Bible says and the ways became bolers amen the things that he was seeing he began to believe what Satan was preaching so it was the faith you know the Simon that Satan was preaching that caused him to begin to sink he was afraid to sing amen why because Satan showed him that you're going to sink wow are you getting this yes sir and he believed the seon so much so it was his faith in the seon that Satan was preaching that began to cause results god brother job he says the things that I fear the most that's the thing that befil me are you getting this so brother sister if you believe Satan amen why there's an amount of faith that goes with Satan are you getting this in order to accept Satan you've got to believe Satan so what produces fear it's a faith in Satan it's a faith in the things that you see around you it's a faith of the things that you are hearing amen it is actually a faith it's a faith in a report that Satan is presenting amen that's why it ends up happening praise be why it is a faith wow wow God Amen you found the same thing happened with the spies yeah the 12 Spies they were sent 10 of them they came they brought an evil report God was not happy why they had it was faith in Satan God had already told them that that land I've already given it to you all they needed to do was to believe it amen you you know it's not yours because you feel like it's yours they were already Amen anakims on the land are you getting this but God says it is yours amen there may be anakims on your health amen but God already says it's your health praise be to God it's not yours because you feel like it's yours it's yours because God says it's yours are you getting this amen hallelujah so now we're talking about the Battle of report say Amen brother way had a sister a few weeks ago amen at our church this sister she was told she went for a biopsy and she was told amen that the results are not looking good you know it looked so wrong praise be to that was the doctor's report Amen brother we speaking about the Battle of reports praise be to God so the doctor's report said things are not looking well you have got to come she was given a date to bring all her medication and they wanted to start her on treatment amen she came to church again in that service amen where we were talking about the Battle of reports brother sister the reason why I'm speaking about this amen if you can read your name praise be to God into this sermon brother sister you are going to see it it's going to happen amen it is going to happen because this report is is unchangeable praise be to God brother once one time amen the prophet he you know he went he bought a gun amen it was a model 75 Winchester praise be to God and you know he was zeroing in from 50 yards and he was hitting the target he was hitting the eye from 50 yards amen and then after a little while you know this gun was not zeroing the way it ought to amen he took it back to the Winchester company says but you know what's wrong my gun is not performing the way it ought to perform and the people they looked at him they no no Mr Bram you are wrong amen why because this gun is designed to shoot from 20 yards you are saying you shot from 50 yards it was not designed to do that amen it can only hit from 25 yards and the prophet says no no no no no I know it has hit from 50 before I know it's zeroed him before it should zero in again praise be to God brother sister I want to tell you that this gospel this report is zeroed him before because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if it zeroed him before it should zero in again brother this is not a Winchester company now if it doesn't zero in we will take it back to the author we will take it back to God himself and God is not going to tell you that if it's zeroing the days of Malachi 4 that you know it's somehow it's lost its power if it's zeroed in in the gospel if it's zeroed in in the days of brother Bram it's going to zero in in your day amen if it's zeroed in Amen in in the testimony that I'm giving now if this gospel if this message zeroed in is is going to zero in this afternoon praise be to God whatever it is brother sister you ought to believe the report amen that's all it takes am so this sister now she's told that they've given her a report that you know that it's looking bad and she was worried amen and she was talking to me says I think you know I'm I'm going to die I'm okay I feel like my life is right I said no no no no no sister not so fast amen praise be to God because we have a report amen where the Prophet says do you fear cancer praise be to God do you fear cancer praise be to God that's the commission he was given amen cancer something that had troubled the people amen yet when the message came that's the one that was mentioned by name praise be to God brother so what's there to fear what's there to fear with you know what the doctors will say brother when we have this report Amen brother sister and I said to her amen I said praise be to God so I was preaching and I was preaching speaking about that Victory I was saying that on the way back as they were coming back on the way back on the May way back tomorrow on a Monday amen something is going to happen praise be to God and then a few after about a weeks or so they then got in contact with it they say you know what we we don't actually we're not supposed to do this on the phone we're supposed to write you a letter but we have already written you the letter but just to put you at ease you don't need to come for that appointment anymore everything is clear Amen brother sister God Amen a battle of report praise be to God brother I'm here to tell you that whatever report amen whatever report that you have God is able we have a report an absolute report that is able to reverse amen any other report that you have praise be to God

written that they may be destroyed yeah I think I've read that amen how many appreciate the Lord amen praise be to God brother sister one time how many are happy for me to share a few testimonies as going forth Amen brother because testimonies they are not baren they are not baring amen they give birth to other testimonies we've seen it amen it happens all the time amen it happen because it is the word it's not a men's program amen it's just about you believing the report it's not about me here speaking today it's about you believing the report brother sister it's all about the report it's not about no man a it's about the report yes sir are you getting this so we the sister that came to church one time you know she's there now this are like you know because it's an out she's new work that we're doing amen for the Lord so these are people that are just coming into the faith so she came with you know she'd been coming for a few months and then you know I'll just fast forward for the sake of our time amen then they they came to church on a Sunday and you know we had known that they are struggling to have children amen they you know so they had actually gone to the doctors on the on the Friday and they were told that you only option will be IVF amen but even that there's no guarantee with how bad things were so they said you know um it couldn't be done they never told anyone they just came to church they came to church amen on a Sunday and then I was speaking on the two reports amen and I said the doctor may have given you a report brother but if you are going to believe the doctor's report you will see the doctor as results Amen brother but I've got a great physician here that has got another report so if you believe my report amen it's my report now because I'm the one that is holding it amen it's my that's why the Bible says to who has believed our report not God's report amen our report so the report that you have about your life amen is much more powerful than someone just talking stories about the Bible are you getting this because it's the manifested word yes right amen so oh these guys they you know it was in November it was in November and they had been told that it was not possible so you know uh fast forward after about two months they they said to me and my wife they wanted to take they said oh we need to go out for breakfast guys let's go

so I want you to follow this so the spoken word has already gone forth the prophet has already amen it's not making any sense whatsoever brother sister the same way the word is not meant to make sense

lepers to start moving it was the influence of the spoken word yes sir so what came first was the spoken word the spoken word was spoken first amen and God behind the scenes he caused amen things dos to begin to connect are you getting this behind the scenes but what caused the lepers to move it was the spoken word they came under the influence of the spoken word they came under the influence of the spoken word and they CAU the inspiration brother sister you can come under the influence of the spoken word amen and you can catch an influence brother sister these lepers listen to this when the swen word went forth these lepers were not even in church lepos is a sign of sin it represented sin your loved ones they may not be in church amen they may not be in church but they can come under the

proceedings by believing in the report amen hallelujah amen so these four lepers they just quot that inspiration but it was the spoken word what am I saying I'm saying this message this afternoon is influencing amen your your circumstances amen right in you know in the in the Silence of things something is happening in the background now Elisha was not you know he didn't know how it was going to be oh he's just say that's said the Lord how God was going to bring it to pass it became God's responsibility brother when a preacher comes to preach it becomes God's responsibility to fulfill amen what the word has said to those that will believe the report thank you Jesus we are about to close amen listen and they rose up in the Twilight and to go unto the camp of the C Ian and when they were come to the utmost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there you see it's God you know started listen to this started just magnifying their footsteps so this reporter has got ability to magnify you they didn't even know that God was magnifying their footsteps they were limping as as usual but to the camp of the enemy it was magnified footsteps amen so you may not even know that something is happening now but I'm saying Amen in the Simplicity of this word behind the scenes something is happening I believe it for the Lord had made the hor of syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they say to one another Lo the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites so God will cause confusion in the camp of the enemy amen amen amen in the message what does thou here it's great things acquir things so brother sister things that Acquire you may feel like nothing is moving the greatest things in your life you may feel like you're stagnated you're not makinging progress in your life but I'm saying things that seem to be quiet those are the things that you have to keep an eye on are you getting thisise God did you know that friends listen the sign which gives life on the Earth to every living thing in botony life plant life tree life whatever more it brings forth life the sun does and it can draw a million gallons of water from the Earth the Sun and make less noise than we can get a bucket full out of a pump so me and you we can make a lot of noise but the sun is drawing out millions of gallons of waters listen Quiet Things are big things amen so the Quiet Things are big things did you ever hear the world turning did any of you here ever hear the world turning did you ever hear the planets as they pass through the obies do you ever hear one but what is it that's the big things did you ever hear the sunrise right so in the quietness of things these lepers Amen in the quietness of thing the spoken word had gone forth but something was happening behind the scenes that I'm here to convince you my brother my sister that right now as this word has been going forth behind the scenes amen things are happening you you just are not aware of it as these lepers went into motion it was the spoken word that caused them to go into motion but you know and he tells us did you ever hear the the the the world turning but right now my brother my sister the world we know that it it um it turns it it it revolves around the Sun it takes three 65 days in a quarter right to revolve around the Sun but you know what speed the world is revolving around at 67,000 mil an hour but do you feel like the building is shaking it's quiet the world revolves around its axis it takes 24 hours for them for world to revolve around its axis it revolves around its AIS at a, miles an hour right right now as you are sited there the world is moving at 1,000 mil an hour around its axis but do you feel it but is it not turning the world the Earth is turning around the Sun 60,00 7,000 M an hour this is real go and you know go and do this research you'll find that's true yeah but it's already turning yeah brother sister but you are there you feel like you are a child of God you feel like we are stagnant this world is revolving around the S the Earth is brother let me tell you you this Earth is revolving around the so n of God you may not feel that you are revolving but you're revolving amen because if this world was to be stationary it will crash out of orbit amen why because it's the gravitational pull of the s n that keeps it in orbit Amen brother is the gravitational pool amen of the s o n that keeps the bride in all be Amen brother you may feel like you nothing is moving in your life I'm saying but you know what this Earth before you know it seasons are changing amen it's Autumn it's winter amen summer but you know you don't hear returning brother before you know it amen when you believe the report you will find that your winter will be passed before you know it amen it feels like you are stuck in one place but God is moving amen things are moving behind the scenes in the quietness of things there's things that are happening praise the Lord so I'll just read this now amen how many are ready now amen to you know to to to to to do so much harm to this enemy amen because you know we want to make sure that by the end of the service amen just give me another 5 10 minutes we'll be done 1 Samuel chapter 17 and they went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of goth whose height was six cubits or in the span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and was armed with a coat of male I want you to was the language amen and he had Grieves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders amen verse number seven and the staff of his spear was like a waver beam and his Spear's head weighed 600 sheos of iron and one bearing a shield went before him look at the depth and the level and the trouble that the word went forth to describe how big the problem was you see how you know the they extend you know look at the level of description you know so this is what happens when doctors give you a report they will give you names a they will give you all the technical stuff about it amen why because they want you to be scared amen by the time you get to verse number seven you know you'll be very scared amen just by the description of the problem so that's what Satan's reports are there to do to describe a problem until you you you you you you are done before you even confront the problem my god brother are you getting this so this is how Satan works now these are the things that you see amen you know the report comes in a way that is explaining exactly you know it goes into unnecessary depth unnecessary depth Amen to try to cause your heart to faint that's all right but brother I have a report amen this report doesn't tell you how you should believe it it doesn't that's why the angel of the Lord loved that song only believe only believe Amen brother is that simple amen God did not want to complicate it any further only believe amen but when Satan comes he comes he magnifies his St he wants you to begin to faint just by reading amen amen now David was the son verse number 12 now David was the son of ephra died of Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse um I'll just leave that and he had sons and uh the men went among them for an old man in the days of Saw verse 14 and David was the youngest and the three Elders followed sa so the Bible doesn't even go into any depth about David David was just the youngest David was just the youngest are you getting this only believe are you getting this only believe is that simple amen but you did you see the level of depth amen the trouble that the word has gone forth in just describing Goliath including his clothes how he looked all these other things there are two reports amen I'm speaking about the Battle of two they coming to their climax amen as we get ready to close God I don't know what report you have but David went and turned from so he just now you not even describing David just you know giving a recounting uh just uh giving a listen says and David went and returned from so to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem yeah so the only description that David had was he was was the youngest yeah but David went and returned from so to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem and the Philistine Drew near morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and David spake to the man that stood by him saying what shall be done to the men that killed the Philistine amen how many Davies do we have here you know they looking at the reward they're not looking at the problem amen what you know they are looking at the Ultimate Prize is Beau don't focus on your problem focus on the reward amen and so said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine look yeah but look I like before we get there verse 26 says for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God so David identified a weakness amen he identified that this Philistine though he be he be but he's uncircumcised we know circumcision represented is a type of the Holy Ghost amen does your problem have the Holy Ghost so already you've identified that it's an uncircumcised Philistine already it's in trouble now it's already in trouble isn't it God and so say to David listen to this Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth so the reason why he brings it down to age you are just but a youth so you won't be able to go against this man what an irony and he now describing him a man of war from his youth so I am a youth I can't go against him but he has been a man of war from the youth from his youth from his youth he's acknowledging that he was already Warrior from his youth but he's saying you can't be a war because you're a youth so this is what Satan does amen he wants to convince you you can't do it but if he was a Warrior from his youth I can't do it because I'm a youth what an irony so that's how cheap Satan arguments can be are you getting this and David said unto so thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock so the prophet tells us that you know one trial makes way for another trial so if you are going from from trial to trial from trial to trial it's God is preparing you for an ultimate trial that will put you on the throne are you getting this the absolute trial so let me read that again thy servant kept his father's sheep speaking of himself and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock thy servant flew slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistin shall be as one of them I want you to identify your uncircumcised Philistine and he going to be is one of them but you see I heard something about ship that's quite interesting they say that before a ship goes forward to fight they say that it comes back to gain momentum so when it's moved back to gain momentum then it can launch for forward so we find David he understood the language of ship he started going back to his experiences as he spoke about the lion he was going back as he spoke about the bear he was going back he was ready to launch forward to the uncircumcised Philistine amen because it gave him momentum now to go after Goliath amen so sometimes my brother sister you've got to look look back amen at your life and see the battles that God has fought for you before if he delivered me amen is the god that healed me before he the god that delivered me before he's the god that made a way for me before brother if he did that before he's able to do this and brother sister amen so this uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of them listen to this now as we are closing oh my this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand he's now speaking to his problem I want you now amen I want you to stand your feet amen we're about to close I want you right now to begin to speak to your problem brother there is power in the spoken word David spoke exactly how he was going to defeat Goliath before they encoun they had the actual encounter amen so you can defeat your enemy by the spoken word I want you to begin to amen identify your problem as the word is going forth now we're about to be to to close amen say this day I want you to repeat and where he says you know this uncircumcised I want you to put your problem there I want you to read this with me you know your problem this day will the Lord deliver Thee the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will I will smite thee no no I no I want you to say that again I will smite thee where you say where he says the don't say the I want you to mention your problem amen if you don't want to shout it out you know you just say you know so that you are the one that can hear it say I will smile thee if it's sickness I will smile thee sickness amen and take thine head from thee this is before the fight are you getting this the spoken word as you are uttering these words you are moving them from being your words to the words of God because this is the written word and those words cannot return to God null and void are you getting this we are taking this out of your lips amen we are putting this in God's lips you are speaking this as because you're reading your name in the scripture amen it is not you speaking now it's the god that wrote the word I will smile thee and take thine head from thee so gol's head is coming with the problem your problem's head is going to come off amen not might be it's going to Amen brother if you believed if you have believed the report I can guarantee that that head is going to come off brother this report is powerful amen this

the sickness has been cast down we found out everything was under our feet my we're going to walk in Victory Hall oh my my God my God my God I tell you just thank the Lord for the word amen uh a couple things I needed to announce that I I I forgot to mention earlier um sister doson amen uh over at Rapture and Faith Tabernacle brother Mike called me on yesterday to inform me that the Lord had called her home she had been in uh in and out of um nursing homes and things of that nature and uh the Lord has called her home and many of you saints that grew up there amen uh you know Sister doson man been faithful for many years and next Saturday they'll be having uh her homegoing service there at uh uh Rapture in Faith Tabernacle and uh we um I don't know if I have the I might have the time let me just see here uh but we wanted to just mention it to you that if you're able to go and and uh support amen and just be an encouragement to the family uh I'm sure that they would appreciate it praise the Lord let me just see I think I have the time here uh while I'm okay there we go uh it's going to be 11 a.m. Amen on next next Saturday amen they'll be having the service there for uh sister doson and also um want to ask that you keep her her family in prayer and then also uh last Sunday uh there was brother Mike woodfolk Jr y'all saw him in church on last Sunday was sitting there and and he called me Amen on yesterday and he told me brother Jack my mom passed away on Wednesday and um and you know he was just um you know just wanting to mention it they have some arrangements that they're making they'll let me know what the arrangements are but we want to keep his family in prayer as well in the loss of of his loved one amen both of these families will keep in prayer praise God let's just bow our heads amen as um we prepare to dismiss father there is not much that we can say but thank you we appreciate you sending your man servant all the way from London God he he according to his own testimony he wasn't even supposed to be here to think think of how much you love us that you would bring a man so far to speak a word of this nature and this magnitude and the Word was simply given to challenge us as we said on Wednesday night there are things that happen in our life where Satan uses it to try to produce fear but God you use the same situation to produce a faith and father is to allow attributes to come out of us that you placed in us and God it's only through the circumstance it's only through the situation that that attribute can be expressed so Lord here today the spoken word that attribute has been expressed through so many lips and father we are under expectation to see a manifestation of what we spoke oh God Lord we appreciate you Jesus we realize how much you love us God and how much you care for us and how much you want us to have what it is that we're speaking for thank you for the anointing that comes and Lord we realize that I I believe uh um brother Benny Perry was preaching a sermon and Lord Brother brother uh Quinton called he said no you got to speak now you got to speak when this anointing come when the angel begins to trouble the water we got to jump in yes Lord father Hall there's never been a people that lived in a time like this where we have been given access to the power of the spoken word Lord we don't want to take this for granted we want to we want to we want to walk in all that you would have for us oh God we like like brother Jerry told us on Friday night we got untapped resources and Lord we want we want to step into all this that you've given us oh God and walk daily in it so we thank you Father for every request that has been made in this place and father even as we leave we may think of other things and we're going to release it into the atmosphere with an expectation that it will be done according to how we said thank you for that that scripture that told us to to write it in the way that we want it ask it the way that we want it and and put it in the king's signature we write it we ask it in the name of Jesus it's in the king's signature and once it's been wrote once it's been spoken it cannot be reversed so father we thank you for these things faith is risen to another level Lord we pray that you bless brother Charles bless his wife and his children bless the work that they've started oh god father use them For Your Glory use them for your honor L Lord we just give you praise father we want to lift up these families in their losses God our precious sister doson you've called her home Lord her children are left behind and grandchildren and great grands and so many God that need your encouragement and your strength during this hour so we pray that you would be with them as the as the Saints prepare for the service on next me week may it be a strength and encouragement to that family uh Lord bless brother Mike father also brother uh Mike woodfolk Lord called and said he lost his mother there this week Lord and we want to pray that you would give them strength Lord during this time and that you would help them oh God as all the planning and everything is coming together Lord just just sort it all out for them Father and I just pray that the spirit of God would get the glory from even this situation Lord as the Saints prepare to leave this place but not your presence may we go father meditating on what is happening here today and may the angel Lord go with us go before us surround us Lord may you bless our going out as you bless our coming in and may you keep us Lord until we're able to meet together in this place again on Wednesday night God we're careful to give you all the honor all the glory all the praise it's in jesus' name we pray amen amen amen can
