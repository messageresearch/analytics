[12:43] 42. I'm reading from verse
[12:46] one to 5.
[12:53] Then Job answered the Lord and
[12:57] said, "I
[12:59] know that thou can do everything." Amen.

[13:22] understood not things too wonderful for
[13:26] me which I knew
[13:30] not. Here I beseech thee and I will
[13:35] speak. I will demand of thee and declare

[14:44] narrative to change.
[14:47] Yes, sir. You must come with a
[14:50] positive that is testimony. Amen. Amen.
[14:55] I was hearing but now I see. Amen.

[16:03] of God.
[16:05] Let us come to that rock in a we weary
[16:08] land. Let us come there and beat upon
[16:12] the altar until the cross is
[16:16] broke and our eyes can see clearly Jesus
[16:20] again
[16:22] and the case of this world has passed
[16:24] away. Then the
[16:26] pressure will go off. He is a rock in a
[16:31] we a weary land. A shelter
[16:35] in a time of storm, a refuge, a heaven
[16:40] of rest for the weary. Let us come to
[16:44] that place. Amen. I believe that's why
[16:46] you are here.
[16:48] In perfect faith, the prophet said, why
[16:50] are you here? You are here to identify
[16:53] yourself with Christ. That's why you are
[16:55] here. Amen. Amen. That's why we have

[18:18] paragraph 71, but we can be a church
[18:22] member and morally right still not
[18:26] obtain eternal
[18:28] life not to know the word. Some of them
[18:31] are theologians and scholars and Sunday
[18:34] school teachers, Bible expos
[18:39] expositers, but that doesn't mean
[18:42] anything. Satan knows the Bible better
[18:45] than many of us. Amen.
[18:49] But the Bible said to know him is life.
[18:54] Not to know the word. That's right.
[18:57] To know him is is is life.
[19:01] It is Satan also believe and he
[19:05] trembles. But we have got to have an
[19:08] experience of death, burial and
[19:12] resurrection
[19:13] from our old life. Amen.
[19:17] to the new life which comes in
[19:20] Christ to come only by the Holy Spirit.
[19:25] The new life, that's what we are talking
[19:27] about.
[19:28] Hallelujah. Now, where did the prophet
[19:30] manifest the temple?
[19:33] He manifested the temple to prove to you
[19:37] sons and daughters of God that when you
[19:39] are restored
[19:41] when a son of God is restored you have
[19:44] power to speak
[19:48] and when we speak have faith in God it
[19:51] will come to pass because you have that
[19:54] creative power in you. Satan rob us of
[19:57] all our our rights but thank God we are
[20:01] being restored. Amen. Yes sir. Amen.
[20:05] Amen. Truth. We are restored.

[20:44] written word but by spiritual reveal
[20:49] truth. Amen. Oh blessed be his name. God
[20:54] reveals himself to an
[20:57] individual and quickly he becomes deity
[21:01] in the inside of him.
[21:04] Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[21:07] Hallelujah. Right? When it is revealed
[21:09] to you, when you know what you are
[21:11] talking about, when your testimony is
[21:14] not somebody told me, but I saw it
[21:22] deity has formed in you. Yes sir. Yes

[21:30] son daughter of God. He say speaks to
[21:33] this mountain. Don't doubt but it will
[21:38] move. Yes sir. Why? You get it? It is
[21:42] the day the oncoming judgment the
[21:47] heading of his people into the places to
[21:50] get away from
[21:52] judgment. Come out. It is time to speak
[21:56] the word.

[22:58] Amen. Amen.
[23:01] Why Jesus said in the message the inside

[23:20] momentum to speak. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[23:24] Because you have the power. You have the
[23:25] authority. Amen. You can enforce the law
[23:29] of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory.
[23:34] We have
[23:35] seen it
[23:37] manifested and manifesting in the
[23:40] prophet and in the bride ministry. The
[23:43] bread ministry. We have come to the
[23:45] table.
[23:47] Amen.
[23:48] This is the time for us to know that you
[23:52] have been restored. That's right. And
[23:54] faith has never seen defeat. Right.
[23:58] That's right, brother.
[24:00] Who can defeat faith? Bra said faith is
[24:02] the boss. He has got hair on the chest.
[24:04] And when faith speak, he is the boss.
[24:07] Everybody shall so shut up. Amen. When

[24:14] to all unbelievers, all whatever it is.
[24:17] When faith speaks.

[24:32] that is the those that God is dealing
[24:35] with in Isaiah 32. Isaiah

[24:44] place from the wind, and a coveret from
[24:49] the
[24:51] tempest, as rivers of water in a dry
[24:55] place, as the shadow of a great rock in
[25:00] a weary land. Amen. And the eyes of them
[25:04] that see shall not be
[25:07] deemed, and the ears of them that hear
[25:11] shall he hacken,
[25:13] and the heart also of the rash shall
[25:16] understand
[25:18] knowledge, and the tongue of the

[27:20] into that rest. But because they lack
[27:22] faith, they never entered into God's
[27:26] rest. They could not see the promised
[27:29] land. In Hebrews 4:1 to3, let us
[27:34] therefore fear le promise being left as
[27:37] of entering into his rest. Any of you
[27:40] seem h short come short of it. For unto
[27:45] us was the gospel preached as well as
[27:48] unto them. But the word preached did not
[27:51] profit them, not being mixed with faith
[27:54] in them that heard it. They heard it.
[27:57] Yes, sir. We are also hearing it. All
[27:59] right. Amen. But we have to get from
[28:02] hearing to seeing. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[28:06] That's right. Is right. Amen. They heard
[28:10] it like we are also hearing but they
[28:13] could not possess it. They were
[28:15] professors. They were not possessors.
[28:18] Abraham said don't always continue
[28:21] professing.
[28:22] Be a possessor.
[28:24] Possess the Holy Ghost. Possess Jesus.
[28:27] Let Jesus possess you. And said it is
[28:29] not you having the Holy Ghost. Is the
[28:32] Holy Ghost having you? Yes, sir.
[28:34] Hallelujah.
[28:36] Amen. Amen.
[28:40] God was taking Israel back to the
[28:42] promised land for them to see
[28:45] Messiah. In third Exodus, Rabb said in
[28:49] paradox 87, Arab said there is no way
[28:53] that God can reveal himself to Israel in
[28:56] Egypt. All right? He can do that.
[29:02] So also he cannot reveal himself to us
[29:05] in denominations. Praise God. Egypt a
[29:08] denominational country. God has got
[29:10] nothing to do with denominations. All
[29:12] right. He has to bring Israel to the
[29:14] promised land. Amen.
[29:18] Before he can reveal himself to them.
[29:21] So when they were coming from Egypt,
[29:24] they were coming to see Messiah. Praise
[29:27] God. Amen.
[29:31] Reb6 he was just at the border Egypt and
[29:35] he saw them packing their children and
[29:37] all those stuff coming said where are
[29:39] you going let me read that the
[29:41] handwriting on the wall and I see that
[29:44] picture and I see them bringing those
[29:47] Jews in coming down from Iran coming
[29:51] down from Egypt coming down from all
[29:54] over the world and there is packing them
[29:58] in boys packing their old mommy on their
[30:02] back and they went up to the interview.
[30:05] They interviewed
[30:07] them. When we landed just
[30:10] below
[30:11] and I landed in Caro, Egypt and I seen
[30:16] them big planes coming in loaded with
[30:19] those people woke up and said, "What are
[30:23] you going back to the homeland for? Are
[30:26] you going back there to die so that you
[30:29] can be buried in your homelands? The old
[30:32] Jews with tears running on their cheeks
[30:35] said, "No, we are going to meet the
[30:39] Messiah." Hallelujah.
[30:42] Handwriting on the wall.
[30:45] Hallelujah. We are going to meet the
[30:47] Messiah. That's right.
[30:50] The first Exodus they were they they got
[30:54] to the promise to meet
[30:56] Messiah. Moses spoke of them. When you
[30:59] get to the promised land, Messiah will
[31:02] visit
[31:03] you. But did they see him? They rejected
[31:06] him.
[31:09] That is why they are going through all
[31:11] these problems.
[31:13] Because they call the blood of Jesus
[31:15] Christ. Let the blood come upon us and
[31:17] our children. That's right.
[31:21] Refused to see the Messiah. They
[31:23] rejected him. You you call yourself a
[31:26] son of God, you blasphe. You call
[31:28] yourself Christ, you blasphe. That's why
[31:31] they kill him. But they predestinated.
[31:34] When
[31:35] he performed the sign of the Messiah,
[31:39] they recognized him.
[31:42] Amen. The woman at the say, "Hey, man, I
[31:45] know." He did. She did not say that we
[31:47] know. It's not a collective revelation.
[31:49] He said I know
[31:52] that Messiah cometh which is being
[31:55] interpreted Christ. He will do this job.
[31:59] He will know our heart. Who are you?
[32:02] Amen. That was Abraham's seed. He said I
[32:05] am here to reveal myself to Abraham's
[32:08] seed. I that speak to you. I am here.
[32:12] Amen. Praise God. That is why today you
[32:15] are here.
[32:17] You are not here. I don't think brother
[32:19] Dav is making church. Church ended in
[32:22] Pentecost. If you are here for a church,
[32:24] you are at the wrong place.
[32:26] We are here building the body of Jesus
[32:29] Christ. Amen. This the body of Christ.
[32:32] Amen. And the body of Christ, you don't
[32:34] join, you are born into it. Hallelujah.
[32:38] You join church, you can stop and then
[32:40] go out. You join.
[32:43] That is why we are moving from we join
[32:45] denominations.
[32:47] We are moving out. But when it come to
[32:49] the message,
[32:51] you cannot disassociate. You cannot
[32:55] leave the message. Why? You are born
[32:58] into it.
[33:00] [Applause]
[33:01] Hallelujah. You don't you you you you
[33:04] you cannot leave your family.
[33:07] You can even choose to walk on the
[33:08] street, but still you are a member of
[33:10] the family.
[33:12] You're a member. Amen.
[33:14] Exactly. Right. Amen. Amen.
[33:18] So it is time that they have to see
[33:21] Messiah. And the prophet said,
[33:25] listen in Leviticus 16, they refuse to
[33:29] see the sacrifice. And said Levitical
[33:31] 23, they will recognize him and then
[33:34] they
[33:36] will like the days of Joseph when Joseph
[33:39] revealed himself to his brothers. That
[33:41] is exactly what is going to happen very
[33:44] soon. Israel, they are going to weep.
[33:48] Amen.
[33:50] Now
[33:52] Job, why did Job suffer that kind of
[33:57] terrible test?
[34:02] Brother, the prophet
[34:05] said all the friends of
[34:07] Job, they thought Job has sin secretly.
[34:14] But every child of God must be tested
[34:19] and tri.
[34:22] That is God's training.
[34:24] Amen.
[34:25] But he will come to a place to where he
[34:29] will call being tempted of the Lord. But
[34:32] I will use the word being tested. You
[34:35] are not tempted. Every son that cometh
[34:38] to God must first be tested and tri.
[34:43] Amen.
[34:44] So James said James 1:12 he said blessed
[34:48] is the man that endureth
[34:51] temptation for when he is tri shall
[34:55] receive the crown of life which the Lord
[34:58] has promised to them that love him. Yes.
[35:01] So the prophet said when you are trial
[35:06] is a
[35:07] favor in the message victory day brother
[35:10] said when you are trial God is showing
[35:13] favor. Oh brother Thomas when I am in
[35:17] problem yes it's a favor.
[35:24] Because God he has confidence in you.
[35:29] Hallelujah. Exactly right. Amen.
[35:33] And I want you to notice
[35:36] that the confident that God has in a
[35:40] believer. In other words, God said,
[35:44] Satan, have you considered my servant
[35:48] Job? Why God has such confidence in Job
[35:53] until he told Satan, he put his bet on
[35:56] him. He said, "Hey my friend, you have
[35:57] succeeded. You have really oh made
[36:00] gains, but my servant Job,
[36:05] have you considered him?"
[36:08] Brother, Jesus is rejoicing. All the
[36:11] bread has failed. Right from the Garden
[36:14] of Eden, Israel failed. Pentecost
[36:17] failed. But today Jesus is saying, "Have
[36:20] you considered my
[36:23] bride?" Amen. Have you considered this
[36:26] end time bride that is going to bring
[36:29] perfection? That is going to bring the
[36:31] rapture. Friends,
[36:34] God is manful. Amen. Of this bride.
[36:38] Amen.
[36:40] Praise God. You understand? Yes, sir.
[36:43] When a man comes into contact with God
[36:46] and he's hooked to the promise of God,
[36:49] nothing can pull him apart. Nothing.
[36:52] Amen.
[36:53] That is why you here. Nothing can pull
[36:56] you from this message. If you are if if
[36:59] anything pulls you, it means you were
[37:00] incompatible to begin with.
[37:04] Praise the Lord. Glory to God.
[37:06] Hallelujah.
[37:07] That's why you have been pulled apart.
[37:09] When you see people being pulled apart,
[37:11] don't worry. The element of the magnet
[37:14] is not in them.
[37:16] It's not in
[37:17] them. That's why they pulling out. But
[37:20] if you have that magnet element in you,
[37:24] you'll be magnetized.
[37:26] Amen. Nothing can pull you away.
[37:30] It is time to know how to focus. Job, he
[37:34] was able to focus
[37:36] in. He found out that he has never done
[37:40] anything wrong. He examined his life. He
[37:44] examined his character. Everything was
[37:46] put on test.
[37:48] No, I never done anything wrong.
[37:52] You must know how to focus.
[37:55] Don't set your focus and look at your
[37:57] pastor. If you want to find fault, set
[38:00] you will see fault here. Focus your own
[38:03] life. Focus in and see your life.
[38:07] God. Yes sir. Yes sir. Focus in and see
[38:10] your own life.
[38:13] Not sit down and criticize people. Amen.
[38:16] If you want to criticize, you get a
[38:18] brother. If you come to church to
[38:19] criticize, you get a lot of things to
[38:21] criticize because that's why you are
[38:23] here. You came here to criticize. But if
[38:26] you came here to see Jesus, you will see
[38:28] Jesus.
[38:30] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Amen.
[38:32] You must know how to focus in. That is
[38:36] exactly what Caleb did and the other 10
[38:40] spires could not
[38:42] do because he has heard the message.
[38:46] Moses told them that the Lord will send
[38:50] a messenger before us. The angel of the
[38:53] Lord will lead us to the promised land
[38:55] and he will be a pillar of fire in the
[38:59] night and a pillar of cloud in the day.
[39:03] That was the message.
[39:06] So Caleb kept his focus set right
[39:10] and the pillar of fire was always in the
[39:12] view. He could see
[39:15] him. Yes, brother. If you know how to
[39:19] focus, focus in. You will see Jesus the
[39:22] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[39:25] Amen. That's right. Amen. Praise God.
[39:31] Now, search the
[39:34] scriptures that is John 5:39. For in
[39:37] them you think you have eternal life,
[39:39] and they are they that testify of me,
[39:42] and he will not come that he might have
[39:45] life. They were quoting the scripture.
[39:48] They were quoting Moses to Joseph. Moses
[39:51] said, Moses said like today people are
[39:54] quoting a prophet. Prophet said, prophet
[39:56] said, yes, you can continue to quote.
[40:00] But I want to tell you, you have to know
[40:02] Jesus.
[40:04] Amen.
[40:07] You have to know Jesus. Amen.
[40:11] Amen. Amen.
[40:16] When a man or woman get into position
[40:19] where their soul, their thinking, their
[40:22] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[40:26] God. That will be the most powerful
[40:29] church that ever existed.
[40:33] Entise in spirit. Now all things ought
[40:37] to be considered prayerfully.
[40:39] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[40:42] righteousness and all these other things
[40:44] will be added. I am positive sure this
[40:47] evening it was morning this evening if
[40:49] men and women could only get into the
[40:52] position of where their soul their
[40:56] thinking their attitude will be perfect
[40:58] in the sight of God that will be one of
[41:02] the most powerful churches that ever
[41:04] existed. Yes sir. Amen.
[41:07] That's where we need to come to. Amen.
[41:10] You understand?
[41:13] Prophet said God gives you a gift. He
[41:14] did not give you a gift for commercial
[41:16] purposes.
[41:19] Amen.
[41:21] Some people were look Abraham there is a
[41:24] treasure. We know you're a prophet. You
[41:25] can show a wedding. He said God did not
[41:27] give me the gift for commercial
[41:29] purposes. Yes, I know where it is.
[41:33] Amen. He said check your motive. and
[41:36] your objective. If your motive is right
[41:39] and your objectives is right, then God
[41:42] is obligated
[41:44] to do it. But most of us, our objectives
[41:48] is not right. Our motive is not right.
[41:51] God.
[41:54] Amen.
[41:56] Every child must hol steadily unto
[42:00] faith, confessing and anchor his faith
[42:04] in God's spoken word. Nothing will block
[42:08] his desires. Nothing. If you can really
[42:11] confess and then stand on your
[42:13] confession, nothing, brother, can pull
[42:15] you around.
[42:19] Hebrews 3:6, "But Christ as a son over
[42:23] his own house, whose house are we, if we
[42:26] hold fast the confidence and the
[42:29] rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the
[42:32] end." Yes.
[42:35] Hold it. Amen, sir. Firm unto the end.
[42:39] Yes, sir. Hebrews 10:23, "Let us hold
[42:42] fast the profession of our faith without
[42:45] wavering, for he is faithful that made a
[42:48] promise, and let us consider one another
[42:50] to provoke and to love and to do a good
[42:54] works, not forsaking the assembly of
[42:56] ourselves, as the manner of some, but
[42:59] exalting one another as much as more as
[43:02] we see the day approaching."
[43:06] But people choose to stay at home, let
[43:08] them stay at home.
[43:11] No brother say how can you be a
[43:13] Christian and you not go where
[43:15] Christians are fellowship
[43:18] how can you do that
[43:20] right brother
[43:22] and moreover if everyone of age you know
[43:25] what God has called you for what is
[43:28] sitting in you Job his gift was for the
[43:31] people your gift is not for yourself
[43:34] your gift is for the church
[43:37] amen Amen. That's the truth. Amen. Maybe
[43:39] probably you don't know your gift. Go on
[43:41] your knees.
[43:43] Yes sir. Hallelujah. And know why you
[43:45] are in this church.
[43:47] You are here as an asset, not a
[43:50] liability. That people will really get
[43:53] some benefit from you to edify the body
[43:57] of Christ. That's why we're here.
[43:59] Hallelujah. Your pastor will not he has
[44:02] a responsibility. He will come here and
[44:04] preach the word. You have a
[44:06] responsibility. You have to stay here
[44:08] and see vision. You have a resp you have
[44:10] to prophesy. You have a You have a
[44:12] responsibility.
[44:15] But it look like we are not committed.
[44:17] We are not serious. Many things has
[44:20] taken the president. Many many things.
[44:23] Wow. My Lordise.
[44:28] You understand? Yes sir.
[44:31] Now the channels of communication. Job
[44:34] opened the channels. Brother said he
[44:37] opened the channels of communication by
[44:40] inspiration. He understood how to empty
[44:44] out for God to come in. When you can do
[44:47] that, then God has the right of way to
[44:51] prove his
[44:53] word. Job was able to cleanse the
[44:57] channels. He said Lord he open the
[45:00] channels and God comes in his friends
[45:04] his wife reboke
[45:06] him. Why it is enough Job? It is time to
[45:10] curse God. It is time to speak against
[45:12] God and then you go you
[45:16] die. Sometimes you our wives may God
[45:20] have mercy on you.
[45:22] Let us tell you frank
[45:24] frankly sometime you pull us you pull us
[45:27] down. You must help the man. You must
[45:30] help your husband. You should not be an
[45:32] impended. You should not be a problem.
[45:38] Be part say you the woman you are
[45:42] building the family. When you go to a
[45:44] house and the children are spoiled, it
[45:45] is you the woman first.
[45:49] My
[45:52] Lord,
[45:54] that's what the prophet said. And it's
[45:56] true. The baby, he stayed in your birth
[46:00] 9 months. He knows you better than me.
[46:02] That's right. That's right, brother. You
[46:05] gave the baby breast. He knows you.
[46:08] While he was breastfeeding, he was
[46:09] looking at you. He He did not look at
[46:11] me. You
[46:17] truth. So Job understood how to get
[46:20] himself out of the channel and allow God
[46:23] to operate. And he did it. And when he
[46:26] did it, he was always confident that oh
[46:30] my friends, I have never
[46:33] sinned. Your opinion might be right, but
[46:36] I've checked my life. There is nothing
[46:38] wrong with
[46:40] me. when it is revealed to you like
[46:43] Simon when it was revealed to him that
[46:46] he is going to see the Lord's Christ
[46:49] brother he was testifying an old man I
[46:53] am not going to die you we are giving
[46:55] you where we you supposed to die you
[46:57] this old man said no I will never die
[47:01] until I see the Lord's Christ
[47:05] when it is revealed to you and then you
[47:08] know that you have heard but you have to
[47:10] See, nothing can stop you. That is
[47:14] Simon, he heard that Christ will be
[47:18] born. Yes, sir. But God said you will
[47:22] see him before you depart. Yes sir.
[47:25] Praise God.
[47:28] It is important for us to come to a
[47:31] place of seeing not hearing. It is it is
[47:34] harder. It is time for us to really
[47:37] evacuate that place of hearing and let
[47:40] us come to seeing. Yes sir. Amen.
[47:48] Simon, there were many uh women that
[47:51] brought their children for dedication.
[47:53] But the Holy Ghost will always is
[47:57] precise. Holy Ghost will never miss it.
[47:59] True. Simon walk. Simon, stand up.
[48:05] The old man walking through the
[48:06] congregation, they said, "Where are you
[48:09] going?" The Lord's Christ is right here.
[48:13] Amen. Amen. He pass said he passed many
[48:18] ladies that were holding their babies.
[48:19] But when he got to marry, the Holy Ghost
[48:21] stop
[48:24] stop because he could not could identify
[48:27] who is that one. There were many babies.
[48:30] Amen. But the Holy Ghost, Amen. stop
[48:33] him.
[48:35] And he got the baby on his hand.
[48:37] Hallelujah. He said, "My eyes have seen
[48:40] the salvation of Israel."
[48:44] Hallelujah. Not hearing now. His eyes
[48:48] have seen.
[48:50] We have to come to that place. Amen.
[48:54] Amen. Amen. Job had a gift and the
[48:57] people from the east and west they all
[48:59] came and Job the inspiration he has to
[49:03] really use the gift on the people
[49:04] because the gift was not for him it was
[49:07] for the people and God used it preside
[49:10] perfectly and the people rejoice. So
[49:13] when they see his adversity and
[49:15] calamities, ah what has happened to this
[49:17] man? God was training his
[49:20] son. Job want waited for
[49:24] inspiration. He waited for
[49:27] inspiration what he could say to his
[49:30] so-called comforters who had accused him
[49:34] as a secret sinner. At that time the
[49:38] channels were made ready for inspiration
[49:40] from God. And when it struck Job, he
[49:44] said, "I know my redeemer liveth." Amen.
[49:51] Friends, he waited for that
[49:54] channel. He waited for that
[49:58] inspiration. And when his eyes were
[50:01] open, he saw the just one. Praise God.
[50:05] He saw the
[50:07] resurrection. He saw Jesus. His eyes saw
[50:11] him.
[50:13] He said, "I know my redeemer liveth."
[50:17] Hallelujah.
[50:19] When inspiration hits you,
[50:22] brother. Praise God. You speak
[50:26] under inspiration.
[50:30] Amen. Job spoke it. The people could not
[50:33] understand what he's talking about. But
[50:36] he saw the just one. He saw the
[50:38] resurrection.
[50:40] and said, "Lord, I've been hearing all
[50:44] these years. I've been hearing of you by
[50:46] the hearing of the ear. But now my eyes
[50:52] have seen you. And I am confident even
[50:55] if this skin rot, if my skin won't
[50:58] destroy this body, I am confident Lord
[51:02] that I will stand in your presence."
[51:07] Amen. When that inspiration hit you
[51:10] brother, that is why we don't care. Let
[51:14] them denote their atomic wealth for
[51:15] whatever they want to do. We are
[51:18] fearless.
[51:20] Amen. We are fearless. Praise God.
[51:25] Because we have the power of God in our
[51:29] God has pack us with his
[51:32] power. Fear not.
[51:35] Amen. Whatever he run, whatever you
[51:38] American, you are your pope. You have
[51:39] got a pope now. Whatever he's going to
[51:41] do.
[51:43] Yes brother.
[51:46] We don't care. It is scripture our
[51:48] prophet has told us. He has fortold us.
[51:52] Hallelujah. Amen. And it has fulfilled.
[51:55] Amen.
[51:58] Our eyes have seen. Yes, sir. True. We
[52:02] were hearing but our eyes have seen.
[52:05] Amen. Amen.
[52:09] In all the trials of
[52:11] Job, God was pushing Job to the
[52:16] relatives from hearing to seeing. That
[52:20] was the the the journey that God was
[52:24] taking Job
[52:26] through for Job to see him. And when Job
[52:31] passed the test, oh my sister, you must
[52:33] also pass the
[52:35] test. God is pushing you to a a place
[52:39] that he can vindicate, prove himself to
[52:43] you. God
[52:46] that you can see him. Glory.
[52:49] Amen. Thank you.
[52:52] True faith is vindicated after it has
[52:56] been able to say through time crisis and
[52:59] challenges. If you say you have faith,
[53:01] faith must be tri. Faith must be tested.
[53:06] And before faith can emerge victorious,
[53:10] it must really pass through all this
[53:12] crisis. Glory to God. Yes sir. If you
[53:15] never face any crisis like Abraham said
[53:19] in the dispensation of the gentile
[53:21] dispensation, he said how can you say
[53:24] you have won a you are a hero without a
[53:28] battle.
[53:31] You never fought. You say you a hero.
[53:34] There may be a battle to fight. Right.
[53:38] Yes sir. So prepare to fight. Amen.
[53:41] Amen. When God engage you in a battle,
[53:44] you must rejoice. Amen. Rejoice when you
[53:48] come to the front
[53:50] line, that's where God is placing you in
[53:53] perfect faith. Think paragraph 177. He
[53:57] said, "Go move to the front
[53:59] line. Move to the front line. You are
[54:02] fearless. Don't look at the scarecrow.
[54:05] Don't look at that sickness. Don't look
[54:06] at that opposition." That's right. Look
[54:09] at what you have. Amen. Amen. Amen. When
[54:13] you have Jesus,
[54:15] you can move to the front line. My
[54:17] brother said, "Look at the face of
[54:19] Satan." I said, "Friend, my friend, you
[54:21] cannot let me disbelieve again. It's
[54:23] over."
[54:25] That's right. You can't let me
[54:27] disbelieve again. Amen. It's over.
[54:31] Glory.
[54:33] Cuz you know who is sitting in you. That
[54:36] day you shall know that I in the father,
[54:39] the father in me and I in you.
[54:43] That is where we have come to. Jesus in
[54:45] you the hope of glory.
[54:48] So if I want to see Jesus, I'll come to
[54:50] you and I will see Jesus. Amen. I am
[54:53] seeing Jesus.
[54:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let us not be
[54:59] hypocrites. Let us be genuine
[55:01] Christians.
[55:03] Amen. Amen. Ira D is preaching. He's not
[55:05] killing you. He's preaching. He wants to
[55:07] preach and then you must really listen
[55:10] to the voice of God
[55:13] to transform you into his likeness.
[55:18] Hallelujah.
[55:20] Amen. Amen.
[55:22] Job he came out victorious. His blessing
[55:26] was
[55:28] multiplied. And the God told his
[55:30] friends, "You are foolish guys. Take
[55:33] your bullets. Take your sheep, go to
[55:35] Calvary. Job was the calvary of that
[55:38] day.
[55:40] Go to Calvary. Go to Job for Job to make
[55:44] sacrifice for you guys.
[55:48] Because you guys has played a
[55:50] foolishness.
[55:52] Foolishness. May God have mercy on us.
[55:56] That's what brother is telling us that
[55:59] it is not you hearing hearing. It is you
[56:03] seeing it if you have come to a term of
[56:06] seeing God. You have to see
[56:09] him. It's good to read the Bible. It's
[56:12] good to read the message. It's good to
[56:13] listen to the message. Nobody is really
[56:16] saying that is not correct. You have to
[56:18] listen to the message. You have to hear
[56:21] the voice of the prophet. It's correct.
[56:24] But many people will listen to the voice
[56:26] but they don't have Jesus. Many people
[56:28] who play the t they don't have Jesus.
[56:30] Many people have agapo they don't have
[56:33] Jesus. Amen.
[56:35] True brother. True.
[56:39] So friends what is
[56:41] important? There will be an old lady and
[56:44] all he she doesn't know ABCD.
[56:48] He never even done any press and play.
[56:52] But she have Jesus.
[56:55] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Praise God. Jesus.
[57:01] He has seen Jesus.
[57:08] Class, he has walked with Jesus. He has
[57:12] at with Jesus. He has seen all the
[57:15] manner how Jesus conducted himself. But
[57:19] after his death he has foretold them
[57:23] when it is third day you guys should go
[57:26] to
[57:28] Galilee on the third day I have told you
[57:31] go to Galilee that's where you will see
[57:36] me but what business do they have to go
[57:39] to
[57:40] Amayos why are you going to we are going
[57:43] the wrong direction right that is why we
[57:47] have all these problems we We are moving
[57:49] the wrong direction. Friends, let us
[57:51] come in line. Yes, sir. Amen.
[57:58] But Bra said they were doing the right
[58:00] thing. They were talking about Jesus.
[58:03] Anytime you talk about Jesus, he will
[58:04] appear. That's right. Amen. So talk
[58:07] about Jesus. Amen. Glory to God.
[58:12] Amen.
[58:16] We have come to the I stage. Listen to
[58:18] the prophecy here. Christ is revealed in
[58:21] his own word. Can you put that for us?
[58:23] 65 tape number
[58:27] 0822.
[58:29] 0822. 65. 082. Paragraph 77. You see
[58:34] down through the
[58:36] age. We started off from the
[58:40] foundation from the first church age
[58:43] when the seed went in the ground. The
[58:47] complete seed then it come out through
[58:51] the feet Luther come back out then
[58:55] through Wesley then into
[58:59] Pentecostas the tongue. Yes in the
[59:03] lips. Now it is in the eyes.
[59:10] We are no more in the lips. We are no
[59:14] more in the tongue. We are in the eyes.
[59:16] Prophetic Malachi 4.
[59:21] Hallelujah. And so forth. And now there
[59:24] is nothing else left for it to come but
[59:28] himself to step into that because that
[59:31] is the last thing there is.
[59:35] Not in tongue, not in mouth. We are in
[59:40] the eyes.
[59:42] Amen. We have come to the eye stage.
[59:46] We have to see him. Class and his
[59:49] friend. They were talking about Jesus.
[59:52] And Jesus just
[59:53] walk. And then he started to journey
[59:56] with these
[59:58] guys. What is going on? They told Jesus,
[1:00:02] probably you, you don't know. Are you a
[1:00:04] stranger? Jesus Christ opened the
[1:00:08] scripture. Even from Genesis, he
[1:00:10] expanded. He preached and preached and
[1:00:12] preached and preach. They heard it. They
[1:00:15] heard it. They heard it. They said,
[1:00:17] "Master, we don't
[1:00:20] understand. We don't understand. You can
[1:00:23] preach, but we don't understand."
[1:00:26] Because Abraham is
[1:00:27] dead. Jacob is dead. Isaac is dead.
[1:00:31] Jesus is dead. That is it. It's
[1:00:33] finished. But our sisters come from the
[1:00:36] grave. They say he's alive. Brother, my
[1:00:38] friend, we can't take that.
[1:00:41] We can't take that.
[1:00:44] We can't take
[1:00:45] it. Say
[1:00:48] really friends. But when they got to
[1:00:52] Amaz said Jesus behaved like he wanted
[1:00:54] to go, but they constrain him. Now,
[1:00:57] master, you cannot do that. It is
[1:00:59] evening time.
[1:01:01] Anytime you come to evening time, you
[1:01:04] must expect something special. Yes sir.
[1:01:06] That is why the revelation is bust open
[1:01:09] at this evening time.
[1:01:12] Truth.
[1:01:15] They set the bread on the table. This
[1:01:17] stranger did not allow the house owners
[1:01:19] to bless the
[1:01:22] bread. But the stranger picked the
[1:01:25] bread and he bless it. That's right.
[1:01:28] And he broke it in a very special
[1:01:32] way. When he broke it in that special
[1:01:34] way that he has been breaking it before
[1:01:37] the the crucifixion, they recognize him.
[1:01:41] Sirmen.
[1:01:43] Exactly right, brother. He said we were
[1:01:45] hearing of him on the road, but our eyes
[1:01:48] have seen him.
[1:01:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:53] When your eyes see him, you'll be highly
[1:01:57] convinced. They
[1:01:59] run to Peter. Peter, we have found him.
[1:02:04] We have seen him. What the sisters are
[1:02:07] talking about is the truth. We have also
[1:02:09] seen him.
[1:02:13] Brother
[1:02:14] said when it comes to the court when
[1:02:18] they are calling somebody to
[1:02:21] testify you cannot go to the court and
[1:02:24] then they call you as a witness and say
[1:02:26] I heard
[1:02:29] it. Oh judge I heard. You
[1:02:34] heard. Who told you? Oh somebody. Why
[1:02:36] don't you bring the person that told
[1:02:38] you?
[1:02:40] Amen.
[1:02:41] You are not a good witness. Amen. They
[1:02:45] say step aside. If somebody told you you
[1:02:47] didn't need you here.
[1:02:50] But let the person come and say I saw
[1:02:53] it. I was there.
[1:02:57] I was there when the event happened. You
[1:03:00] are a witness. Testify. Tell us what
[1:03:04] happened. That is where we have come to.
[1:03:07] We know. We have heard this message. We
[1:03:10] have heard Malachi 4. We have heard Luke
[1:03:13] 17 30. But today we know Jesus.
[1:03:18] We have seen him. Amen.
[1:03:20] We have seen the manifestation.
[1:03:22] Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] We were to see Messiah. Abraham said the
[1:03:27] Gentiles it was not your day but this is
[1:03:29] your day to see Messiah. Amen.
[1:03:34] Israel they got their part. They saw
[1:03:37] Messiah. Samaria. Samaritans they saw
[1:03:41] Messiah but we were not
[1:03:44] privileged. Abraham said this is our day
[1:03:48] to see Messiah.
[1:03:51] That's why Abraham has to turn his back
[1:03:55] and say Gentiles bride you are receiving
[1:04:00] your last sign.
[1:04:06] Why? He was a man. But we were seeing
[1:04:09] Jesus.
[1:04:12] That was Jesus manifested in flesh.
[1:04:17] Yes.
[1:04:20] You have
[1:04:21] to understand the characters that really
[1:04:24] saw Jesus. Abraham, he heard about God.
[1:04:28] God has spoken to him. He knows the
[1:04:30] voice of God.
[1:04:34] But when Abraham attained
[1:04:37] 99, God said, Abraham, you have been
[1:04:40] hearing of me for all these years, but
[1:04:43] you will see your last sign. I will give
[1:04:45] you the last
[1:04:48] sign. But you must
[1:04:51] circumcise. 99 circumcise, brother. If
[1:04:55] you want to see Jesus, you need
[1:04:57] circumcision.
[1:04:59] Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] You have to circumcise before you see
[1:05:02] your last sign. You have to be
[1:05:04] circumcised. The Holy Ghost has to
[1:05:06] circumcise your heart. We need a fire of
[1:05:09] God to cut our hearts to cut all the
[1:05:14] hangings.
[1:05:15] All those stuff that is hanging on us
[1:05:18] when things last. We still have to carry
[1:05:21] on. We carry all this stuff along.
[1:05:25] Brother, it is time to cut them off.
[1:05:27] Amen. Praise God. May God help us
[1:05:34] in the midst of the church and this
[1:05:35] condition problem say many people they
[1:05:38] they they say they have their
[1:05:40] right. You
[1:05:43] Americans Africa we beat our children
[1:05:46] you don't have your
[1:05:48] right but you have your right
[1:05:53] but the prophet said you must forfeit
[1:05:56] that right. Sometimes that right will
[1:05:59] take you to hell. It's not good.
[1:06:04] Forfeited.
[1:06:06] He said look at the lamb. The lamb the
[1:06:09] wool belongs to him.
[1:06:12] It is his own.
[1:06:15] But when the lamb has got the wool, you
[1:06:18] see that say it is a hanging. It can't
[1:06:24] work. When you throw him on the table
[1:06:27] and then you share, you cut it, you cut
[1:06:31] it, he will lie down very calm for you
[1:06:35] to cut. After you cut it all, you throw
[1:06:39] this lamp off. See that he will jump.
[1:06:42] Oh, I am free.
[1:06:45] I am free. Glory.
[1:06:48] Amen. Yes.
[1:06:50] That was supposed to be done. My God.
[1:06:52] That's right. We have to use the sword
[1:06:55] the way the go to cut you to cut all the
[1:06:58] hangings. Not that your pastor hate you
[1:07:01] but he will he has to put you in the
[1:07:03] kingdom of God. That is his job. We are
[1:07:06] not here I'm sorry to take your money.
[1:07:08] We are here to put your soul in the
[1:07:10] kingdom of God.
[1:07:13] All right.
[1:07:16] So when we are cutting you don't cry.
[1:07:18] allow us to cut you
[1:07:21] because we want to put you in your
[1:07:22] appropriate place. Yes, sir.
[1:07:26] Abraham saw him. He said after
[1:07:29] circumcision then God told
[1:07:33] him Abraham a year like
[1:07:37] this just 28
[1:07:39] circle of woman ask Sarah what has
[1:07:44] happened at the time of life. See how
[1:07:47] the Bible at the time of at time of life
[1:07:50] is with the woman 28 days
[1:07:54] circle ask your wife. So Abraham and
[1:07:58] Sarah we have counted 28 days. What has
[1:08:00] happened to you? Say my lord something
[1:08:03] has happened. I'm
[1:08:05] changed. I'm carrying the seed.
[1:08:10] Hallelujah. Abraham saw God in human
[1:08:14] flesh. He was hearing of him but that
[1:08:17] day he saw God. Amen.
[1:08:21] And that is what produced Isaac. Abraham
[1:08:24] said we have come to the same
[1:08:27] place Isaac is coming. So that is why we
[1:08:31] have to see the promised son coming. We
[1:08:35] have to see Messiah manifested before
[1:08:37] our eyes. That's why we have got our
[1:08:40] last sign. We have seen a lot. Nothing,
[1:08:43] nobody can deceive this bride. Brother,
[1:08:47] we are really convinced about what we
[1:08:50] have seen.
[1:08:51] Now listen, Moses was also
[1:08:56] reading the scripture. He read that
[1:09:00] Abraham made a covenant with God. And
[1:09:03] God told him that 400 years after I will
[1:09:07] stretch my hand and bring your seed,
[1:09:11] your people to the promised land. Moses
[1:09:13] read it. He heard it. He read
[1:09:17] it. But one
[1:09:19] day when he made effort to deliver
[1:09:22] Israel by his own strength, Abraham said
[1:09:24] in the message prisoner, he said all
[1:09:27] Moses achievement was to kill only one
[1:09:30] man.
[1:09:32] Only one stinking man behind. He
[1:09:34] achieved in killing one man. Brother,
[1:09:39] what has been your
[1:09:45] achievement? But when he made a pillar
[1:09:47] of fire,
[1:09:49] hallelujah. You can break with your
[1:09:52] achievement. I did that. I But I tell
[1:09:55] you, if you have never made a pillar of
[1:09:57] fire, your achievement has got nothing
[1:09:59] to do. You have to come face to face
[1:10:02] with God.
[1:10:04] And when Moses came face to face with
[1:10:07] God
[1:10:09] change God said, "What is in your hand?"
[1:10:13] He said, "I just have a
[1:10:16] stick." What do you have in your
[1:10:18] hand? I have a speck of faith like this.
[1:10:22] It's enough,
[1:10:25] brother. You don't need faith like this.
[1:10:28] It's enough.
[1:10:30] Yes sir. Amen. Because that seed is a
[1:10:34] mustard seed cannot be mixed. You can't
[1:10:37] mix it with anything. Amen. So it is
[1:10:40] enough. Amen.
[1:10:43] Because let us close all these windows
[1:10:45] and doors and let thick darkness come to
[1:10:48] this room. Come with just a speck of
[1:10:50] light. Small light like
[1:10:52] this. It will defeat darkness here.
[1:10:56] Amen.
[1:10:57] Amen. You don't need a big light.
[1:11:01] Amen. If the Holy Ghost is sitting in
[1:11:03] you, it will push darkness away. That's
[1:11:06] what the Bible say. Arise and shine.
[1:11:09] Your light is come. Amen.
[1:11:11] That's right. Your light is come. It is
[1:11:14] time for us to see Jesus.
[1:11:18] If we all come to that place, I see
[1:11:21] Jesus, you see Jesus, there will be no
[1:11:22] fight. We will stop fighting. the truth.
[1:11:26] We stop accusations.
[1:11:28] We stop hatred.
[1:11:30] Cuz we have seen Jesus. Amen.
[1:11:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:37] Moses dropped the
[1:11:39] stick. He dropped it. Abraham said when
[1:11:43] he dropped it from his son, it was no
[1:11:45] more Moses stick again. It wasn't Moses
[1:11:48] rod again. It became God's rod.
[1:11:55] When you drop yourself at the feet of
[1:11:57] Jesus, it is not you again. Jesus
[1:12:00] possess you. Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] Take the stick. He took it. Moses, it is
[1:12:09] not your rod. This is my judgment rod.
[1:12:12] By this rod, you are going to judge
[1:12:14] Egypt.
[1:12:16] This road
[1:12:19] friends he was hearing he was reading
[1:12:22] the message but he saw the pillar of
[1:12:24] fire.
[1:12:27] Abraham said in Christ re Christ
[1:12:31] revealed he said what Moses lack was in
[1:12:34] the pillar of
[1:12:36] fire. What you lack is in the upper
[1:12:39] room. Amen.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:43] Thank you, Lord. Friends, you must wait
[1:12:47] until you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:51] We must hold the horns at the altar and
[1:12:54] say, "Lord, we are not moving. We are
[1:12:56] not even moving an inch. Until we
[1:12:58] receive the Holy Ghost, people are not
[1:13:01] desperate. People are not hungry. People
[1:13:03] are just they think that we can go in
[1:13:05] like this. We cannot go in like this. We
[1:13:08] must be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:12] You're exactly right,
[1:13:16] friends. When Israeli talking when
[1:13:19] Israel was ready to move, they did not
[1:13:22] come to talk about a message. It was a
[1:13:25] time of application. Yes sir. Apply the
[1:13:28] token. Apply the token. Apply the token.
[1:13:31] But blah blah say that is where the
[1:13:33] bread we have come to. Brother, it is
[1:13:35] not time to talk about the message and
[1:13:37] fight. When we want to talk about this
[1:13:39] way, we will
[1:13:40] fight. But apply the token.
[1:13:44] This is the time to apply the token.
[1:13:47] It's token application. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:54] When we all are playing the token and we
[1:13:56] know that we are moving out from
[1:13:59] here, then we will pack our stuff.
[1:14:02] Israel the midnight cry said when they
[1:14:05] got to the midnight cry they packed
[1:14:07] their stuff it is time to pack friends
[1:14:10] we are moving out
[1:14:13] we have heard the voice of our
[1:14:15] bridegroom he's screaming come up here
[1:14:19] he's calling us
[1:14:22] it is time to move out from here
[1:14:26] Peter when you are strengthened when you
[1:14:28] are converted help your bre
[1:14:34] Peter has walked with Jesus. Peter has
[1:14:38] drew a sword. Peter has cut an ear. He
[1:14:40] has done
[1:14:42] everything. But Jesus told them, "My
[1:14:45] friend, you are not yet converted.
[1:14:51] But go to upper room, wait in
[1:14:53] Jerusalem."
[1:14:56] And when the pillar of fire
[1:14:58] descended, Peter did not see flesh. He
[1:15:01] did not see Jesus in flesh. He saw Jesus
[1:15:03] in the pillar of fire. I tell you Jesus
[1:15:06] in flesh will not help you.
[1:15:08] We need Jesus in the spirit.
[1:15:12] That's what Jesus told him. It's
[1:15:14] expedient for you that I go. When I go,
[1:15:16] I will drop this flesh. This flesh will
[1:15:18] not help you here. I'll drop it and I
[1:15:21] will come naked fire.
[1:15:27] And when he descended in the upper room,
[1:15:29] the pillar of earth stood right there.
[1:15:31] Peter saw him. He saw Jesus in fire.
[1:15:36] Said, I was seeing you in flesh. But now
[1:15:39] my I see you in the spirit.
[1:15:43] And he broke himself, parted himself, my
[1:15:46] friend. And each one of them got a part
[1:15:48] of God.
[1:15:51] And when they got
[1:15:53] down, things changed.
[1:15:56] They were dead. They have been
[1:15:58] resurrected. Amen. By the power of God.
[1:16:04] And they were in harmony, my friend.
[1:16:08] That is the early church harmony.
[1:16:12] They were able to really come together
[1:16:17] to propagate, to preach the message.
[1:16:19] Amen. They sold all what they have.
[1:16:23] Sometime even if you are paying tithe,
[1:16:25] it pains
[1:16:26] you. Unless maybe you Americans, maybe
[1:16:29] they take it source from your salary. I
[1:16:30] don't know. But some people when they
[1:16:32] are paying ties, it is it is a a big
[1:16:38] problem.
[1:16:41] Friends, let us really understand that
[1:16:45] we are moving out from here.
[1:16:49] If you want to invest, invest in the
[1:16:51] kingdom of God.
[1:16:55] We are closing. The Queen of Sheba, what
[1:16:58] did he
[1:17:00] say? First Kings 10:6, and she said to
[1:17:04] the king, "It was a true report that I
[1:17:08] heard in my own land of the acts and of
[1:17:13] thy wisdom. How be it, I believe not the
[1:17:17] worst, until I came, and my eyes had
[1:17:22] seen it. And behold, the
[1:17:24] half was not told me thy wisdom and
[1:17:30] prosperity, exceeded the fame which I
[1:17:34] heard. Happy are thy men. Happy are
[1:17:38] these thy servant who stand continually
[1:17:40] before thee and hear thy
[1:17:44] wisdom. First Kings 10 6 and 8. The
[1:17:49] queen of Sheba I was hearing when they
[1:17:52] are coming from Palestine I ask them and
[1:17:55] they tell me the wonderful things that
[1:17:57] is going on that God has come to live in
[1:18:00] a man.
[1:18:03] Solomon said the one said I brought
[1:18:05] gold, I brought silver, I brought many
[1:18:08] things. I've come to see if it is true,
[1:18:11] I will support
[1:18:13] it. If it is not true, I'll go with my
[1:18:17] gift. You are here. Have you seen the
[1:18:20] manifestation of God? Did you bring any
[1:18:23] gift here? The Holy Ghost is in you. Is
[1:18:25] your gift. Bring that gift to support
[1:18:27] the work of God here. We need your gift.
[1:18:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:34] And this queen of Sheba he said my I was
[1:18:37] hearing but now my eyes have seen.
[1:18:44] That is where we have come
[1:18:46] to. Amen. Paul was
[1:18:49] hearing that Peter and the the rest they
[1:18:53] were preaching Jesus Christ, but he was
[1:18:57] a very strong
[1:19:01] opponent against the name of Jesus
[1:19:04] Christ.
[1:19:06] Guys, you can preach but please
[1:19:09] please don't mention the name of Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ for preaching. You have every
[1:19:14] liberty you can
[1:19:16] preach. But the name of Jesus, please
[1:19:20] don't mention it
[1:19:22] again. That is all what Paul was out
[1:19:25] there for. He was persecuting the people
[1:19:28] that were calling the name of
[1:19:30] Jesus. And when you read Galatia, Paul
[1:19:33] said, among my cos, my nobody's too tall
[1:19:38] like me, Paul, when it come to
[1:19:40] persecution,
[1:19:42] I was number one.
[1:19:46] friends. He had an authority note. So he
[1:19:50] was singing and rejoicing. Oh Lord, you
[1:19:53] know I am jealous about you. These guys
[1:19:56] in Damascus, I'm going to deal with
[1:19:57] them. They are calling the name of
[1:20:00] Jesus. I'm going to deal with
[1:20:03] them. But in the middle of the
[1:20:05] road, the pillar of
[1:20:08] fire strike
[1:20:10] him. And Paul said, "No, this fire is
[1:20:14] the Lord." Said,
[1:20:16] "Lord, are you happy with my
[1:20:19] mission? Are you happy of what I'm going
[1:20:21] to
[1:20:22] do?" Said, "Paul, why persecute
[1:20:31] me?" Things change. He was hearing, but
[1:20:35] Paul saw him.
[1:20:37] Agria, I can never be disobedient.
[1:20:42] My eyes have seen
[1:20:44] him. It is not somebody told me and said
[1:20:48] Paul did not go to the high priest and
[1:20:50] then consult the high pri what do you
[1:20:52] make of that? I met a fire and the fire
[1:20:55] fire strike me and the fire was really
[1:20:59] it was so powerful that even the midday
[1:21:03] night a light could
[1:21:05] not shine that.
[1:21:08] So, high priest, what do you make of
[1:21:11] that? Paul did not consult. He said, I
[1:21:14] did not consult flesh and blood. He
[1:21:16] don't need any consultation. If you are
[1:21:19] convinced that you have met with Jesus,
[1:21:21] whom are you going to consult?
[1:21:25] Amen. He was convinced.
[1:21:28] And when you read the book of Acts said
[1:21:29] right away after Ananas prayed for him
[1:21:31] and he was baptized and they gave him,
[1:21:33] he stood up and he preached Christ.
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:38] Preach
[1:21:39] Christ. Isn't it the same Saul that is
[1:21:42] persecuting people that are calling on
[1:21:44] this name? Say yes I am the same soul.
[1:21:47] The my eyes are open. Amen.
[1:21:51] When your eyes get
[1:21:53] open brother you will see differently.
[1:21:59] Amen. People will not understand you.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:04] Your wife will not understand you. Your
[1:22:06] husband will not understand you. Why?
[1:22:08] Your eyes are open.
[1:22:11] You see differently.
[1:22:13] Are you ready to pray?
[1:22:16] Our eyes have seen him. We were hearing
[1:22:19] of him, but now we see. Look at Gideon.
[1:22:23] When Gideon, God called him, Gideon, you
[1:22:26] are a man of valor. You a man that can
[1:22:29] really save
[1:22:31] Israel. Say if God be with us, where are
[1:22:33] the miracles?
[1:22:36] God said, "Gideon, you do
[1:22:39] it." Then Gideon, he saw the angel of
[1:22:43] God. He says, "Stay right there on the
[1:22:46] rock. I want to bring
[1:22:47] sacrifice." Gideon brought his
[1:22:49] sacrifice. He put the the the sheep and
[1:22:52] everything stuff on the rock. And the
[1:22:54] angel used his staff, touched the
[1:22:57] sacrifice. And fire came from the rock
[1:23:00] to consume the sacrifice.
[1:23:03] Sister, lay yourself on that rock. There
[1:23:06] is fire to consume you. Lay yourself on
[1:23:10] the rock of ages. Fire will come and
[1:23:13] consume you. So when the fire consumed
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:18] sacrifice, then Gideon said, "A
[1:23:21] last, I will die. My eyes have seen the
[1:23:24] Lord." But angel said, "You will not
[1:23:27] die."
[1:23:29] Kid, I was hearing of you, but my eyes
[1:23:31] have seen you.
[1:23:34] Are you ready to see God?
[1:23:37] Jesus is right here.
[1:23:41] You are his habitation.
[1:23:44] He's living in you.
[1:23:48] I don't need to go struggle to see
[1:23:50] Jesus. That is Jesus.
[1:23:52] Here we are going to pray.
[1:23:56] I've been hearing of you, but my eyes
[1:23:59] see you.
[1:24:01] Let us leave the the error of
[1:24:07] hearing.
[1:24:08] Move to the stage of seeing. It will
[1:24:13] change everything.
[1:24:16] Brother, let everyone go into his
[1:24:19] presence. Brother Bran said we are going
[1:24:21] to pull. If you have really got your
[1:24:25] policy, we are going to withdraw our
[1:24:28] dividends.
[1:24:31] If your policy is a right
[1:24:33] policy, just fall at the feet of Jesus.
[1:24:35] Say, Lord, look at my policy. I have
[1:24:39] invested in this business. It is time to
[1:24:42] draw my
[1:24:44] dividend. This is your day. Talk to
[1:24:47] Jesus.
[1:24:49] Lord, I have been hearing of
[1:24:51] you, but my
[1:24:54] eyes have seen
[1:25:01] you. The atmosphere is
[1:25:04] changed. When you come to the stage of
[1:25:09] seeing is is in the different
[1:25:12] atmosphere, the phenomena
[1:25:14] changes. You see
[1:25:17] Jesus, your testimony will
[1:25:20] change. Your faith will be
[1:25:27] anchored. We love
[1:25:34] Jesus. We must love him. and
[1:25:39] did I'm going to
[1:25:41] pray if there is
[1:25:45] anyone that want to come into contact
[1:25:49] face to face with Jesus you can be on
[1:25:52] your fa feet and say Lord I am standing
[1:25:56] on my feet why don't you be on your feet
[1:25:58] while I pray for you that
[1:26:02] Lord I've been hearing but it is
[1:26:06] Enough. It is enough with me. I want to
[1:26:10] see
[1:26:14] Jesus. Heavenly
[1:26:16] Father, the hour has
[1:26:20] come. That is your prayer on that
[1:26:23] faithful day. You said, "Father, the
[1:26:25] hour has come. Glorify your
[1:26:28] son." Lord, we have come to the hour. We
[1:26:32] need the glorification of God.
