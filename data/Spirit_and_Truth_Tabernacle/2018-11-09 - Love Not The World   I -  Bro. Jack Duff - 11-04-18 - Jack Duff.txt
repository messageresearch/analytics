are just need to do before we get into the word of the Lord wanted to first just think all those that were able to and then just come to be a part of the service on yesterday and those that just supported it through the prayers and the food and the things that nature we really really appreciate it as a family as I mentioned and I had to apologize to my wife and also to my mother-in-law a man last Sunday morning I should have announced that we had a death in the family and and I fail to do that like I had the ax for their their forgiveness but it was my mother-in-law's mother-in-law she made it to 90 years old and her birthday would have been yesterday she would have been 91 and as we mentioned that the homegoing service if there was a present that I could ask of my Heavenly Father to give me if I was 90 and turning 91 that that present would have been to be able to enter into his heavenly courts with Thanksgiving right and and I think she had an opportunity to do that so she celebrated her birthday in heaven and that that's the best place to celebrate a man so uh so we just appreciate everyone in their support for that a man on yesterday I been that his first Sunday I always try to give you all an update a man on where we are with our Building Fund and we are so grateful that the Lord has been working miraculous things a man here in our mitts and you know I'm just I'm just so so grateful so grateful a man for all that see him doing this this I believe this is our season a man I believe just a word that we just speak amen but I you know sometime you got to know when the seasons right you got a the waters being trouble you got to jump in you got to get everything that God got for you a man that season I just believed as a church since I season out and watch people and then here and there and they're natural just you know they're their natural life are just watching the blessings of God just all the tape they men the people of God and and and and I'm just watching things in minutes there's God move in here you know this is God doing some things and you got a purpose for what he doing and and I'm believing as a church we can all reap the benefits to what God is doing in the midst of his people Amen we're already are a man I think he has more in store for us but we are we're certainly we just want to share a man where we are right now and in our and our pledges if you just hit that light for me please as mentioned eight man we we voted earlier this year and we voted for raising a hundred and five thousand dollars for the next three years our goal is a hundred and five thousand dollars and we receive pledges people filling out the form saying you know what I'm gonna pledge towards that goal and based on the pledges that we receive fifty two thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars was received in pledges a man and thus far year-to-date what has been received on the pledges has been thirty has been thirty one thousand three hundred and six dollars and four cent let's give the Lord praise a man for for that about thirty thirty one thousand three hundred six thousand four cent I mentioned to all early in the year that that that transfer that you see there a man we fell short an hour offering and we had to transfer money from my building fund in order to cover our offering and you know that's something that we never want to do and you know so we were glad that it only happened once but I have to save Church that last month was a tough month a man and and you know I just want to encourage everybody please continue to give we we have a rent it's very expensive and what we had that well if ax is that an offering if we get 37 people every month just give one hundred dollars in offering eight minutes all we asking tithing that's 10% a man what that's what God requires but when it comes to offering this free will but our ask is that consist we paid almost 3:30 750 in rent if we got 37 people giving $100 a month then we would cover our offering I mean we'll cover our bills pretty much every month so last month it was it was tight a man it was tight I you know but but I do want to just encourage of her please you know just some if you commit it to giving $100 make sure you give a mentor dollars so our net is this $30,000 $30,000 under six dollars and four cent because we had to take $400 from that from this building fund so that's why we end up with a net over here thirty thousand nine hundred six thousand four cent and I have never never ever ever seen this church raise $30,000 in this in this amount of time so I'm grateful Church I I I'm telling you I'm so grateful a man and we have given out thirty thousand dollars to Jesus right and and and by putting it in this and see a little as much a man when God is in it and by us giving it to him we expect him to do some things that just just go you know beyond our expectations amen so just just please continue to you know just do all you can and you're Finn you're driving and I built a front drive and if you have not committed anything to say hey I wanna I want to be a part of this we have forms on the on the table out here you can fill that out and you can be a part of this this is a three year journey hey man this is a three year journey so we want everybody to just be a part a man of the blessing glory to God thank you brother amen praise the Lord a man a man tell you what oh I want to also just thank you all for your your prayers and everything last week had a wonderful time and fellowship there brother James and you know just just real real good service and I just appreciate everybody even even our pinnacle palms turned out real real nice you know I mean half the church came to pinnacle palms and that was real good you know I think we were we were there worshipping a little bit and lady was coming down to her mailbox and you know she heard the worship in there it's like mine let me count what's going on sir brother Josue went outside and and and and and God I'm like come on in come on in and you know she come in and she she got she got she got a got her blessing you know a we we were just so happy Amen for that but it was a it was a real real real treat and you know just just you know moving from there brother I mean brother Troy did an excellent job there as he ministered praise the Lord at Pinnacle Farms amen and we were just you know just real blessed and it just kind of flowed right to that evening service there and Boynton so we had up we had a great time in Jesus name and just you know I just appreciate all the church for their support and you know I was just less the Johnson family man they were there and I knew they had a two hour drive to get back home but they came and they stayed and I just appreciate that brother brother solid line god bless you all and God bless you all praise the Lord well I'm not gonna take any more time I want to read a scripture and and then we will we will settle in and to what the Lord has for us on today I'm gonna just love the Lord Jesus hey man y'all keeps us the brown in prayer though she's away this weekend there with her her granddaughter up in Columbia so uh keep keep them in prayer and as she's away praise the Lord stand with me we'll turn and read a passage here out of first John chapter 2 and I a couple weeks ago we bleep the halls for a moment and we read this scripture and verse John chapter 2 verse 15 and I ask everyone to just maybe take it and write something down as to how the scripture speaks to you a man and and I pray is something that you've been meditating on and just thinking about but I know as we we have various generations that are represented here in this congregation and as we read this scripture again today it should speak to us all a little differently but nonetheless a man it should have some type of impact on our lives here in 1st John 2 verse 15 it says love not love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen let's read it again love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen let's pray over this father God we approach your throne we thank you for bet you have given and/or Jesus our trust is that you would God that you would just suss to us through it that you would help us Lord to see what the Spirit is is desiring for us to see today even at this moment we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Spirit and we trust Lord Jesus that you would have Liberty a man and this portion of a service the Bible says that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty so God just take your take your rightful place take control over our thoughts kick take control over our a man our and attention span take control father over everything that Satan will try to use to prevent us from receiving from heaven on today God speak and only way that you can minister to every heart may go Lord beyond our flesh and may go to the depths of our soul let the word make a difference it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you let's feed it praise the Lord a man we want to just take for our title here today love not the world a man love not the world you know and I was there I guess a few months ago there in Tucson and I was in you know in the in my hotel room just kind of getting ready for service but I was doing my my daily Bible reading and the scripture was one of the scriptures for that day and as I as I read the scripture it just seemed like verse 15 just kind of lifted up you know out of the Bible and and man I felt like getting up and just running around the room you know over over that and and it was a reason you know I took me back to a message that brother Belton had preached here a man and and you know when we look at this it says love not the world okay but he had made uh he made a statement he asked the question to say here the Bible's telling us love not the world a man and but uh but Jesus said actually well I'm sorry not Jesus but the Bible says here in John which is a very very favorite passage you know you see it uh you know you go to football games and they just got the the the you know the sign all all out to everybody got this sign out basketball games got it they might even have it at hockey games I don't even know right but everybody just put this sign up you know it's supposed to mean so much and I mean if people didn't know one scripture they got at least know that without the Bible right John 3:16 says for God so loved the world a man that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so here you know I've thought about that and brotherbrother belted me to come and they say well what world right mean here here it's a God so loved the world but then over here in first John it tells us love not the world but now so yeah we got a conflict here if God so loved the world the question is what world what world does God love right a man and and you know the other thing I won't just kind of take a journey here through if we could just bring up Hebrews chapter one a man verse one through three a man Hebrews chapter one verse one through three and it says this God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son okay who me hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's alright so we see something in Scripture Amen that there are there's not just one world but there are world right and and any other thing here a man that we see here is that uh since this after these last days spoken unto us by son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's okay who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he when he hid by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high so I I just kind of I kind of got stuck there on that Scripture when he said when it says that whom he also made by whom also he made the world's so this tells us here that there's uh there's multiple worlds that we're dealing with a man there's this seen world it meant even in this room right now there's another world hallelujah you can't see with your eyes Amen but it's another world and uh that's operating Oh hallelujah you ever ever come to church sometimes that you feel like Amen you can ship house down huh and that the times you come to church and you can barely lift your hands huh amen you feel like something is stealing your praise that's because inside this church there's multiple worlds that are happening hallelujah and there's an influence that comes from those worlds sometimes it's a heavenly oh my god even if I could just put it this way you got really at one world a man you got this disarmed this just this demonic must fear that's another world a man indeed you got what you living in right now it may praise the Lord Amen you got you got what you're living in right now just where your physical being is that's another world now that that's all these different worlds that God has created and we got to be able to recognize amen where we're getting the pull from because there's only one world that God loves hallelujah amen and I believe it's that heavenly atmosphere that God loves right amen God though I mean God though when they say when they say I hate God so loved the world but then he also said love not the world hallelujah amen so God don't love everything about this world and you know what as believers we not supposed to love everything about this world amen hallelujah I want to just you know kind of take a little time and just read a few things here amen to you let me um let me I want to maybe read it pick up another scripture here out of Colossians hallelujah Colossians chapter 1 and i'ma start at verse 12 let's just pick this up oh my god my god a man thank you Jesus he says giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness so that's that's a world right the power of darkness that's a world and you don't realize sometimes you can be influenced from that world they man they limit us pal darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son hallelujah so that there's an elevation that should happen when you leave the world of darkness to come into a world of light right listen he says in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all three three we're all things created that are in heaven hallelujah and that are in earth visible and invisible amen so there's an invisible world amen there's a natural world and there's a spiritual world and in the spiritual world that's an elderly room and a demonic room amen there's many worlds that we're talking about here so what world did God love listen visible and invisible whether whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or power all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is beginning the firstborn from the dead and in all things that he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all do awfulness well hallelujah so I mean really the world I think that God really loves is the one that he could have preeminence in oh my god amen the one he can really have preeminence because a man of things of this world plot does not have preeminence in that a man we see the devil at at work in the things of this world so here Paul I mean John ourselves love not the world or the things of this world right that in the world If any man love the world the love of the father's not in him now let me just start here with a quote out of who was God who was God look at this he says I and then we're going to make the second man the first man you can't see him you know I was I was you know just recently talking with somebody about this you know when you really look at it Genesis 1:26 27 that man was a spirit man made after the the image of gods all right say but in Genesis 2:7 I believe when he took flesh and wrapped that spirit man in what we see on the outside is just the flesh hallelujah but there was a spirit in there that was made after the image of God now let me tell you something glory to God you can just see a man even in your own makeup there's a pool of different worlds that happen a man worn your spirit man pools for the things of God but your flesh cuz Adam did not fall into he came into his flesh right and so what happens sometimes your flesh becomes a mess and what happens to your flesh is that it's always been influenced by a different world your spirit man is trying to be influenced by heaven where this flesh is being influenced by hell let's go further he says this it says and then we're going to make a second man the first man you can't see him second man was a halo and now he now he takes a third man and makes him like a little white cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down he's all man that's the soul of man eternal then he says then after this man sinned he marked that soul blackness darkness coming to it and then God came down and lived in man suffer with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that blackness and sin away from him and brings it back into perfect fellowship a part of God and now we see by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sin we become Sauron sons and daughters of God who is God the one that stood there and rolled stars off of his hand and roll and and rolls world's I like that rolls rolls out of his hands and may the things which do not appear deity and deeds himself lives in man the creator that made heaven and earth lives in mankind God created worlds hallelujah so you know the spiritual world we're talking about God created this natural world that we're talking about God created a man all of this is created by God but when he says that he loves a man God so loved the world he's not talking about all of that a man is that heavenly that heavenly atmosphere that he's trying to pull us into when you come into church what the word is supposed to do is to pull you out of this earthly atmosphere and pull you into a heavenly atmosphere and you know what that's not something that you live in amen on Sunday morning only amen that's that's that's the reason you got to feed yourself when you leave the church because you were happening you're hearing from a different world do you realize when you get the word going to your car we're going to get the word going in your house that it invites the presence of angels huh hey man you can act sometimes you feel tears coming down your eyes it's the presence of God wherever you go you can have a presence of God in school you can have the presence of God on your child people can be impacted by the presence that you create at your desk huh amen because because you're living in a different world now you can also take rock music and create a different atmosphere and demons will be present demons will be welcome in that atmosphere it's a different world and God don't love that world guess what we as believers should love that world either oh I don't understand I've seen folk do it you know because we you know I got a quote here but imma just kind of you know brother branham saves some time when he weet here in a prayer line and he's praying for different people and here catch a vision and when he catch the vision and he's just kind of sharing you know you did this and you did that and this is why you got the condition that you got and he just said hey say what happens that he's living in two different world he's living in two different worlds so there's one world where you see him just kind of talking to you but what does that elevate him and allow him to speak what happened in the person's life that's another world that's a heavenly atmosphere all right now he says say I'm living in two different worlds but you know what now we might not be seeing visions we I mean now God want us to see it but we might not be in that spot where you know where we surrendered to God where we can see that but I can tell you right now that people even though they not experiencing spiritual things like that they still live in to two different worlds hallelujah and sometimes we bounce in and out of them depending on who we win right depending on who we wit glory to God a man if you wit the boys and a man and eights they got maybe they got certain language that they use you start bouncing over into that world you cursing like they curse huh a man you just left Church in a heavenly atmosphere but now you get out there with the bullets and you don't change everything how you come to church with you with your belt on hello somebody right but but but when you leave Church glory to God now your pants a hat sagging see you living in two different worlds and you got that you got you got a you got a do what John I mean what just say lovin the world which one you think God loves the one where the pants are pants are sagging I don't want witness get where you got his pants up which world is God love huh I mean you know let me just just share these things right you know cuz you know we like I said we living in two different worlds you know folk folk dressed like Christians when they come to church huh that to you you're a Christian only when you come to church you think God don't see that huh and but but when you leave church it's a whole different story don't catch them in the street you might be surprised at what you see now wait a minute I thought uh-oh and see you say no I thought that was only for church no no no no no no no it's not only for church this is a 24/7 life that means 24 hours a day seven days a week we live this holy life what happens that you get trapped you get a pole from a different world and there's an anointing there and if you're not careful you'll fall underneath that anointed can we just talk to you a little bit this morning huh I mean you know uh you know sister she might not wear her heels so high here at church you know and I wish that we was kind of like like it wasn't in Africa I went to Africa one time you know the preaching and the pastor say the sisters came to church the week before with these high heels don't say the Deacons met him at the DOE told him that they could not come into the house of God like that now you know some of y'all I said that in the first thing with you minds that that happened to me I won't be coming back to that church that's sure what were you living in that show exactly because the Bible say love not the world or the things of the world because if you do that the love of God is not in you all right so the brothers don't know we had to tell them not say you know what ask Africa we need to bring it right here to the US we need to bring it right here to the US I mean so you know see where where certain things to church but then we you know we got we got this other side of the closet can I just talk this morning we got this other side of the closet that we go to when we think we not going to see those things oh god I'm gonna have to preach to myself I'm gonna say amen to me right amen but we got this other side of the closet and you know you don't realize that other side of the closet amen that's it you even in your closet is too different [Applause] in your closet there's two different worlds and let you see when God said he's so loved the word he what he don't like that other side of the world that's why you don't bring it into the house of God what you gotta understand not just coming to our God you are the house of God you represent God everywhere you go and I can tell you but God don't love that part of your world hallelujah that that's the part that he action will he tell tell us love not that's the part that he you know he hate himself that's the part that's gone you know just like like in Sodom and Gomorrah there was one part that burned it was there was so many worlds in Sodom in Sodom right kind of Abraham was living in a world Abraham happened to be in one world living in a particular world in the world Abraham lived in allow God to come and visit him and reveal secrets to him if you not hear secrets from God if you die Aaron secrets from God maybe you are living in the wrong world now lot also lived in a world his world was counted in between right yeah I mean I can say man with Abraham but I can also pull out my wife to do stuff down here that made me grieve my spirit but because she my wife I go see nothing huh not only that allowed his kids to get involved in all kind of stuff huh it's all kind of Wars happening and then it got so bad to the sodomites they were in a different world now you know even a lot being a made believer it grieved him what the sodomites was doing it grieved him but it did change them because if he was really impacted by he would have got up on there I think not knew that his wife weren't going nowhere look at the Bible the Bible the Bible make it plain when it when it I didn't just just just three words when it talked about the days of Sodom and say remember Lot's wife nine I ever did Lee Lot's wife had a lot more going on then just turning her head back to Sodom I think she had a certain pool a lot made it maybe Lot's wife was what we would call a dominating female spirit and she lived in a different world huh glory to God maybe maybe she's happy that her husband wants the mayor if see that's why you gotta watch certain jobs that you get because it puts you at a certain level where you got to conduct yourself a certain way and you got to live a certain way in that world you got to live a certain way in that work and you get so mixed up a man so confused because when you come to church you hear something different you hear in the Word of God right and when you hear the word of God this article victory buddy when when Judge they love not the world what is he talking about see see see see see see you looking like you look at his wife you look at the sodomites you look at you look at Abraham you look at all them everybody was living in this world but they had they were live in different worlds in this world you know you know the Bible say that we are we as Christians we are in the world but we are not of the world you know you know why we not well because the Bible also say that we are citizens from another Kingdom that's why don't that's why I don't walk around with my pants down huh amen you know it's just as you know I mean I'm just I'm just hitting these things you know when you when you when you when you when you when you think a man when the devil just just bothering you a test and you're trying you bite them high heels because the Bible speak of it y'all might not know that but you know the Bible also it actually prophesied that women will walk with stressed-out necks and what causes a nexus Trek it's the high heels man you can't even you can't even you can't even enjoy yourself in them Hills yeah I mean you wear them can I can I just be honest you ran because you want people to see you right but then when you when you get to where you're going you can't wait to take them off now I want to actually question where did the influence come from which world cuz there's many worlds the world the worlds we're freeing all these worlds we'll pray now God is trying to see which world you're gonna live in hallelujah somebody right but you know which world a man are you getting the influence from because I got it all right here but but you can't you either be an influence from the world underneath or you being influence from the world above hallelujah you've been influenced from one of those words either heaven is influencing you or hell it's influencing you so you think you get the idea from you you know you see no I mean you go back to the old days the holy holy women with God didn't dress like that if it's too tight where you get the influence from huh if it's just letting all your tests where you get never that's brother or sister huh sisters to me walk around with HSI light and brothers to me walking around with HS all out either hello somebody a man see a brother a brother look at up now back in my day his name was Tony Atlas sermon of saints from my time saying man you know who Tony he was mr. USA mr. universe you know you Lou you look at this muscle magazine huh and then they cut real good are you looking at the muscle magazine then you start looking at yourself Oh hallelujah when you go to the gym you can't get out the mirror you you sit down the gym you just hallelujah I'm talking so I'm talking real good right now right and the people that come to the gym they are influenced on the different world so you get that same anointing on you and you want to come out to the house of God to so much again brother and sister what and there's certain clothes that you can wear the highlight certain areas a yoga preach to me this morning some things that you can do that will highlight certain areas right and make it look if I do say so myself and all along you are being influenced from a demonic atmosphere [Applause] [Music] see I'm not doing it because brother so-and-so did it or because sister saw so did it are you doing things because you saw it in the world what world the haircut that you might wear you know because we know sisters now now you know can I y'all just I'm just all over the place right now sister you know the Bible speak to you about not cutting your hair you ain't read that if you ain't ready see me after church I will show you in the book of Corinthians where God says it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair I'll also show you in that same book of Corinthians that is wrong for a man to wear long hat so when you catch a man with long hair and you catch the woman with shorter have you asked the question which world it's the truth in half see the world that God loves it's the one that's gonna follow his word the word that God love is the one that can have preeminence amen ask you a lamp a scripture it used to be a time if somebody showed me in the Bible that that's all it took for me I want arguing no mo because God said it now you know you could take one scripture out of context and we're gonna need to see it from from from Genesis all the way to Revelation which word you you been influenced by let me tell you something God only have to say it one time in order to judge you he only have to say it once alright hair styles haircuts I mean cuz it's so now after Bible speak against the haircut which word you think you're getting the influence from because the Bible tell you not to do it but you saw it probably some magazine or you know and light like brother Brahim say you notice the sister she won't she don't cut her hair but she wears it bobbed remember that quote he said this is to here she don't cut it but she wears it bobbed and I looked at that I said now what does that mean I had to go deep into the mind of God to get an understanding and what the Lord did was help me talk to my wife and when I talk about why she said oh that's what that mean and I said oh I've never looked at it like that but but you say say what happened that the wigs that the young ladies wanna wear it has a it shows a bob hairstyle which world are you being influenced from I mean you know you know myself now I told y'all I mean even even brothers even brothers some time he's here cuz every haircut is not of God some of it is coming from hell and you know you got the influence from some movie star our basketball player right you got the influencer you know another thing you know you look at people that that that that you know I mean oh my god the world the Bible speak against tattoos huh so you got this desire to get a tattoo which word you've been influenced by huh which word you've been influenced by I'm telling you that there's a demining influence right and that's the world that God created and there's a heavenly influence which one you've been influenced by you can all you can always say remember the story brother Branham had the story he was talking to this Indian chief it just got converted and and and he was uh you know they start you know and man how you getting along how you doing how you doing I say you know I'm pretty bad pretty good he can speak very little English pretty bad pretty good like what pretty bad pretty good so yes let's say you know it's pretty bad pretty good say well what you mean by pretty get bad pretty good he said you know everything I got this little black dog on this shoulder speaking to me thanks he said then I got a white dog on this shoulder speak it to me things right say say the black dog always trying to get me to do the wrong thing and the white not trying to get me to do the right thing he said so their attacks mmm chief well which when I notice notice he got one speaking on this shoulder one speaking uncial that means he's got something influencing him from two different worlds and he's stuck in between oh god I hope we see that right he's stuck in between so sorry he got this thing something from the underworld and something from up above amen both of them trying to speak to him at the same time right so so sorry I said which one we in chief which one the black dog gonna like though he said depends on the one I feed the most how you think you feed the underworld how you feed down the world the music you listen to the television shows you watch i han't got no televisions the websites you go to the apps you got on your phone how you think you feed the underworld [Music] and can I just you know let's just be honest most of us only get to church once a week so your spirit man really ain't getting fed let's just put it this way you get about two and a half hours of church a week and the rest of that time I can't even add up how many more hours there is the rest of that time the devil get but here the Bible say love not the world nor the things of the world because the love of God not in you all right all right all right all right y'all just let me get it out every specie of every animal is living in the world that God created for a bird has a different world that he lives in than what we live in the bird has the ability to fly right a fish lives in a different world and let me tell you something a fish has the ability to swim and if you take a fish out of his world that fish will die and you take a bird and trying to stuff it down underneath the sea that bird will die right and let me tell you something spiritually if you out of your position you will also die see that that bird understands that he's created to soar in the Himalayas that's his world he's not trying to be no fish the fish understands that you know look look God made me that way to did this body's desire then I got to stay inside this water I got a I got a constantly a man be inside the water that's where I'm gonna live if I get out of this condition I'm in trouble how come a man can't see that if you get out of the condition of a position where God bless you you'll die all right undeveloped countries consider themselves third-world countries that mean they live in a different world on what you living in huh it meant but the other thing that I mean even though they live in a different world they might not have all the same amenities that you have but the other thing that I found is that they still impacted by an unseen world right hallelujah amen in a fully developed country the rich and the poor live in different worlds can I tell you another thing heaven and hell are different worlds right there's a natural world and a spiritual world just as there's a natural body and a spiritual body a natural man and spiritual man says when we talk of galaxies we're talking about worlds right when we talk of dimensions we're talking about worlds now look at this the Prophet makes this statement here it says in questions and answers part two he makes a statement it says here as I've often said I believe in the church here there's a role here like and in here in here lives mortal beings and each one is in this great conglomeration of gaiety of blackness and darkness turtles live in here now they are influency out when I talked about that man having a the black dog and a white dog now he's living in between glory to God this is where you live in so mortals living here now they are either influenced from this away or from that way so either from this way or that way either below or up right say you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or Saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world I want you to think about that so this is not just something that that saints go through alone sinners also are either influenced from above or below hallelujah when you think that sinner a man is feeling the need I got to go to church I don't know why but I just feel like man I just I just need to be in church even though I just finished sin and I still need to get the curve Church where you think they being influenced from you think the devil tell them to go to church huh or if you know hear that hear that you know they filling that tub to go to church but then they also don't go to church today you too tired you too tensed due to that now I don't go today I mean not not now next week where you think they got that from hallelujah see that came from the underworld but but when you when you feeling that that that press the press right through that's coming from the above world that's coming from God but you got to be the one to make the decision as to where you're gonna live and it's a daily decision where which way you gonna live which way you gonna lean which way you're gonna go huh because so every thought didn't come from God sometimes there's thoughts that come to your mind you just be one to act on them that came from hell my god and if you follow through with that you'll end up in jail somewhere that's why you got to even bring your thoughts make them subject it to the Word of God you gotta bring your thoughts into captivity hallelujah somebody see because you always been influenced there and that's why when brother Branham say to either's from the underworld or from the above world that lets you know that there's multiple worlds that we living in multiple dimensions that we living in your cell phone operates in a different dimension than what you operate so you can you know your cell phone is in that fourth dimension of science and that's why that's why text messages can come right to your device and you never felt it you didn't see it and the only reason you hear it now you didn't hear the text message you heard the the effect or the end result of it right and all the reason you can hear that is because you got a little bus on your phone oh my god but as it was coming you didn't hear it can I take some it pass right through you and let me tell you something else demons pass right through you angels pass right through you but what what do you yield yourself to cuz the Bible say don't love the world or the things of the world all right I'm just I'm just highlighting that today there's more for me to say there but I want to highlight that part today what are you using yourself to your thoughts what are you yielding them to a man so you know this thing you know I mean you know what what what people tell you is like you know just you should read a message or listen to the message every day and and IIIi believe I agree with that but I don't I don't agree with it from the standpoint of just doing it to do it you got to know what you doing when you're listening to the message when you read your Bible those are things that actually influence you from that above world because you have to understand you are in a struggle and like I like this I said daily the same saying every hour every minute and I agree with that hallelujah you know you've been fought right now oh my god i'ma leave some of y'all alone I'm leave yellow but you can see how the devil just get you soon as you get to church soon as you get soon as you get a church get a comfortable seat look at what the devil do t come on church I mean it's the truth in it hi you'll leave here go sit down and watch a football game for hours and never wink never even not not one time what do you think is influencing you but let me try mean you know oh my god in it I'll help me Lord Jesus you know if you ever had a sleeping problem a sleeping problem now just can't sleep at night I just can't sleep at night you know what I tell people put on the Prophet I put on the Prophet you want to know why the devil don't want you to hear the voice of the Prophet so the devil girls show that devil that actually stop Bob remembers bother you from stopping you from sleeping he leave quick and then he let his friend come and I put them asleep cuz they don't want you to hear that word now I'ma tell you can you now you'll win two ways one you'll get some sleep and if you don't get no sleep you'll get the word I mean you gotta play game I remember pastor tell him he gave me some advice they say he say brother Jack sometimes you're gonna be studying and I'm just you know I'm just sharing this I hope they said this off just don't hurt nobody cuz you know sometime y'all think the past is so spiritual no the past is just like you he just got a call on his life but he just like you he get tired just like you oh I just like you right and I remember brother toasting our brother Jack sometime you're gonna be studying if sending the devil gonna come he's gonna be fighting you asleep while you're studying he say brother let them win that's wisdom see how in the name of Jesus there's no sleep man go ahead and sleep God anoint you when you get up that's why you don't wear yourself out like that Oh God right but but Church I'll tell you what you know we got to understand that it is we're living in we're living in this world in between but we've been influenced from one of the other one side of the other and I'm gonna tell you I mean even as you go from from from the side of um you know from front front from this underworld it actually more worlds underneath that first that first world and from this side there's more worlds I mean brother branham talked about how you know even in that fifth dimension he put three different areas up there it's just showing you there's all these worlds right and we're trapped and all of this just trying to find my way now you know let me read this other oh I didn't finish this quote right here is that right that was not reading um yeah let me just finish reading it all right he says not they are either influenced from this away or from that away you cannot be a spiritual being sent on st. without having an influence from the underworld from the above world if you're influenced from here you're from above right your celestial body is waiting up here but if you're wicked and hypocritical and indifferent now you understand that's three different worlds there's a hypocritical world there's an indifferent world there's a wicked world but all of them are being influenced from the underworld right said you're including your celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think is up there because the fruit that you bear before people proves where you're from the fruit that you bear before people who's where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else you are here what you are somewhere else your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here the actual question do you understand I know that that's heavy his head is hard to read at all I got ten pages of quotes like this but it's hard to read at all because I mean Jeff says just this one a little bit just got you know what is this I'm trying to get you to see that you are under attack and the only way you can overcome a man is through the Word of God hallelujah Church right you're not gonna win you can't you that is plain is simple love not the world and I actually I'll say right what does that mean to you what does that mean now what you got to do is go back and just kind of look at this and these are some things that's you know the Bible tells us the last side every every weight and every sin there's some things that are not sin but it's a way and if it's a weight where it where is it pulling you from now you know we sing the song I feel the pool you feel both of them you do you feel a pool but it's coming from two different directions one is to try to pull you up one trying to pull you down you know this uh um man one time was sharing with me so you know uh when you look at like a telephone telephone poles you know on the street and said you got one pole sticking up here and they run that line and then you got another poll here to kind of connect the line to you say but every once awhile to get a little drew in the line and the only way to get the dru pot is to take another poll stick it right in the middle and that it take the droop out the line that's what the wins the night service do for you it's taking the droop out your line right because you just you got a Sunday Sunday to Sunday and some are saying doing Nance you got some serious troops in the line right but but but your Sunday to Sunday we put a droop in a line that's why God gave you Wednesday night so you can take the droop out your line [Applause] let me just read some mo let me read a little bit more this is I'm coming out of smyrnaean church eh paragraph 1 20 3-1 let me let me just read this this is deeper than what I'm actually saying to y'all right now but but I want y'all to get this part then I can go further with it this Myrna Church ad says how tragic that was little did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him they talked about Israel and one in a king not might not understand that the he's saying just by them desiring to walk I've designed a king they're rejecting God but by them design a king they actually want to be like the world so you ever get the influence from God then want them to have no king god was their king but where they get influence they looked around they saw what everybody else was doing and let me tell you something that's how all of us act we see what other folks are doing and we want to be just like them do you realize you're rejecting God when you do that I want to be like the word let me go a little further with this he says to be like the rest of world they were rejected him because God had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world and they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world cannot just this is what it say God's people they are not of the world and they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world they are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto this it's a 24/7 religion it's a 24/7 relationship right we don't look like the world that you want to know why we dress the way we dress we don't look like the world not because you know what sometimes you can't tell whether they Christian or whether they say based on how they dress you can't tell now I'm gonna take it used to be years ago you knew who the Christians were they absolutely dress different I thank God for the sisters you know I remember my wife and a man's sister Tina and sister Shonda a man they used to stand out there on the corner and and walk the kids cross and you know some of the times they got criticized the most is when it was wintertime when that weather was changing they spent out there in this skirt and the people come up to us then I ain't your cold what kind of question is that ain't you cold are you cold of course I'm cold right well but they sent it to set them up aren't you cold yeah well why don't you put on some pants are you cold and you still got no pants the reason that they can stand that's because they've been influenced from an a world they can stand and sister Rachel did it too they what they were out there in nature and I thank God they did every time somebody passed by they had many Stoppers say you know I used to I used to be like that used to oh there was a world that got ahold of you and stop you from being what you used to be and I'm gonna tell you the word I got a whole date ain't no one that God loved cuz that world that got ahold do you actually pulls you away from doing what God wants you to do Danny and the one he loved and ain't know when he died I'm going on there crucified to the world the world is crucified unto them 2nd Corinthians 6:17 3:18 says wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you not just come out from them don't even touch what they got Oh glory to God because what they got is gonna infect you it's gonna impact you I want to just share a little some here let me just let me there's a quote that I want to read I want to go to God's power to transform now III got a imma just get here but I gotta bring out something else in this particular scripture it's deeper than just things of the world and when we were in Pentecost that's all we could preach but now that we got a man the fullness of the word we can go further than that however however I think it's necessary that we talk about these things too because the influence of the world come in and I guess if the preacher don't never say that and people think it's okay and it's not okay God sent love not the world or the things of the world he said the things they say if you do that the love of God is not in you I don't care how much you say oh but they love God they do and they manifest in the world that's not what I see it that's what that's what that's what that's what God said is work you see in the world you see fruit the world if fruit coming off this tree and they say they love God now I got a question which God alright let me just let me read something here and i'ma come i'ma you know I'm gonna bring it to a close the day but I got motive see so you know like I like I told you they're sisters from Africa when they got sent home they actually came back to church the next week different well no why they came back different not just because it was going to get sent home they knew there was been influence from the wrong world and when you realize know that your brother Jackie right and you know what some of y'all I watched some of y'all change right here before my very eyes y'all used to didn't do that who you got the influence from where you got it from did you get it from the word I doubt it you got it from somebody and she was watching all right the might as well be truthful amen let me go on God's power to transform now I want y'all to get this cuz we just gonna turn corners night and I won't be able to hit it all today but God's power to transform he says this see something here the first spirit the first veil was a holy veil and she wasn't supposed to look out of that when Satan beginning to talk to her about knowledge she just had to take a little peep at the world he's talking about Eve let's just stop and think about this Adam and Eve were living in bliss this was like the perfect place paradise on earth now I mean they went the way that this was set up is that they would they would enjoy themselves during the day every day evening time come in God would come settle down and have church with Adam and Eve I mean it was a beautiful they went to church everyday it was a beautiful place to live this this Garden of Eden but here brother branham is saying you know that she took a peep at the world where where was the world in the Garden of Eden see they have no problem no high-heeled shoes in the garden see they have probably tight clothes actually seem to have a problem and you want to know why she didn't have a problem with clothes because they had a holy veil can I tell you something we an got that no mo so put your clothes on we ain't got one of them so don't don't don't dress like that not just in church when you out of church don't dress like that amen oh my god can I just take that down let's these things coming to me like this you know I I know it's your house I know it's your house then you can dress any way you want to in your house but if you invited me to your house could you dress appropriately so I don't have problems I know you ain't got a problem but I don't want a problem well we just getting ready for bed you can still cover yourself you ain't got to come out to a room looking like that if you like the way it is right just don't invite me I won't come but understand you know look we trying to keep the devil at so you got you got even watch how you do things hey man oh my god ho the Holy Ghost go home with y'all in it the holy ghosts are going to your bedroom if you let them in here coming to your bedroom just don't let them get a shame all right I'm just I'm just talking okay I'm just talking praise the Lord in any huh we talked about holy life glory to God that's how you keep the devil lot yeah I mean I wouldn't expect that to happen you weren't expected what you was doing over there if you weren't expecting it to happen well I was jet you want just nothing you was being influenced from underworld praise the Lord anyhow all right I'm coming boy I just love the way God do things I love him I love him so much he'd give you awesome everybody come up distant we gonna shot it God do that for you he gonna he might give you one of them next week but this week he wanted to tell you love not the world but you know what folks shout over this type of stuff and say you know I told you my spirit was bothered by what I was seeing in the fourth generation and then you know the other thing I realized is that they didn't hear these type of sermons I grew up listening to this and I went back to church the next week well that's what it went up when the pastor said you can't say a man say ouch hi the eve take a peep at the world in eating this this perfect environment perfect atmosphere I mean look I mean Eve went looking at no bad magazines eat eat when watching TV even when listening to Tom Joyner on the radio were laughing at Steve Harvey huh and from from my day Richard Pryor no she went doing all that Eve 1/2 a little dance yo y'all call that comedy and they cursing like sailors and you call it comedy which world you think you being influenced from huh huh you want to play your jazz and wonder why you got a lot spirit I can't get rid of this less spirit it's in the music hello somebody you know I mean that yeah yeah don't get me wrong I believe folk can come up here we can lay hands on they can get delivered but the question is can they stay delivered what you do when you leave here hi how did she take a peep at the world when none of this stuff was there but but the prophets say Eve took a peep at the world all right well let's just let me just read let me read let me read first thing I will tell you this the way she took a peep at the world is that she went against the word you want to know when you start taking the people at the world when you go against the word Satan began to talk to her about knowledge she just said just take a little peek at the world and that's exactly what her daughter the church has done you have to see you have to dress like some movie star or young men have to act like Elvis Presley or Pat Boone or some of those people under the under the name of religion Pat Boone is a Church of Christ Elvis Presley as a Pentecostal look at this to demonize characters Elvis Presley Pat Boone to demonize they actually came out of the church now you know why the devil brought them out of the church because he can influence a church now with the people that came out of the church mmm see when they forsake the word they've taken a peep at the world that's deeper that's deep when you when you when you leave the revealed truth and go to a non-denominational cuz you know yeah I gotta put it like that right because we know denominations is bad but done on denominations carry the same spirit all you did was take a peek at the world I know what I'm talking about I got the quote here to prove it you know you know when brother brother Branham say when when them two angels went down Amen to Sodom you say they was preaching down in cosmos he say they were preaching in the world oh my god that meant Billy Graham and Oral Roberts was preaching to the world and the Bible stay loved not as heavier is heavier it's much heavier it's much heavier it's much heavier love not the world I don't care how much you tell me you love God you do not let me finish reading the quote now I'm gonna tell you something read the book of John not just first gentleman read the book of John you know we was bringing out this talk last week John 6 Jesus has this problem with the with his doctrine and the people walk out on his doctrine John 6 is 21 chapters in John how did they get I mean it would be honest John 6 we don't in a sixth chapter and they were gone so I'm just telling you this this deeper than what we actually think right I mean let's start with things of the world and you if you can see the types just on the natural then hopefully you can follow me spiritually but I'm gonna tell you something if we saw involved in things of the world it's gonna be hard for y'all to come and say man it is this is just as good as last week it's just as good as the week before I mean I mean this one should have brought the house down yeah I'm just I need you to understand this you know and I'll bring the quotes right and you know so you understand where I'm coming from right and and and this is why it's important that we even read the quotes because people don't understand the spirit that they be under you influence one way or the other every decision you make it's being influenced by one one either heaven or hell is influencing it bottom line it ain't no ain't no in between either the devil is behind it or God is behind it all right let me finish reading this it says to demonized characters that's throw the world in a no and a worst chaos than Judas Iscariot did it betraying of Jesus Christ they don't know it them boys don't know that nothing that I have against those boys man it's the spirit that's motivating and can I tell you ain't got nothin against nobody but I do hate spirits and I know what spirit is behind that you need to see the coming from one way or the other up or down praise the Lord and look this way I say Eve Eve was in a perfect place perfect but how does she take a peep at the world in Eden y'all gotta think about that you I mean you're in Eden but you takin a peep at the world I can see Lot's wife I know how she took in the people at the world I could see the condition there in Sodom and Gomorrah I mean she was living in world but Eden Eden a perfect place of perfect paradise but the prophets say she took a peek at the world the only way she could do that is when she forsook the Word of God God gave him specific instruction and when they went against God's Word they were looking at the world well I don't know what it is maybe the sermon is just not I don't know but I hope and I don't want nobody's mind to be blown I don't want none of that I want to make sure folks getting this because people I got I'm going back remember it remember I was telling y'all about Nimrod I'm coming back to God's power to transform you singing but remember I was telling me all about Nimrod on last week I told y'all Nimrod had three things that he wanted to do three things he wanted to build a strong nation he's taking a peep at the world he wanted to propagate his own religion he's taking a peep at the world he wanted to make a name for himself anybody now I'm that all tied back to something I got a stick I got to get out of that I can't let me get away from that right now I'm coming back with that one let me finish this quote cuz that that that ties into something that I came I can't I can't talk about the day let me finish this just step over on that side one bit let that creeper just get one little hold around the shuck of that corn one time watch what takes place the corn is gone oh yeah it's done it's done got him and that's the way it'll do it it'll do it every time Eve had to take just one peep at the world they say and let me say something to you brother and sister in first John the second chapter fifteen verse we can read it if you wish the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in us now look at what they say here now the world the word there is not earth it's a greek word cosmos which means the world order see how deep that is now I started y'all on some basic things but this go deeper it means the world's order if you love fashions of the earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time or we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong look at this it is perverted by the devil that means your thinking was influenced from the underworld and and not only is it a thought but it become actions your actions I pervert it by the devil it is perverted by the devil for if you love the world's order and the things of this present world is because the love of God is not even in you remember that Oh God look what we're looking into I'm gonna leave it there I got more to say the unfortunate thing I can't come back next we can see it but I be here I'm coming back and I'm just leaving you something I want you to meditate on that Scripture right I want you met first let it deal with you from a personal level right and and and and if you know like I said there are things that you wrote down that was God dealing directly with you you need that you some of y'all send me out products that television was one of the things of the world get rid of it summer radio get rid of it right sumit something might have been fashion might have been clothing get rid of it whatever it was that was affecting you you get rid of it but here's one thing we know love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father's not in him all right it's what John said and we know he got so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son but what world is he talking about because this one right here that John tell us don't love the ain't the one got love and that's not the one he died for cuz that one won't receive him that went getting further and further away from him amen that's the underworld he not talking about that that can't even be converted praise the Lord but he talked about the one that's caught in the middle of them two worlds that he's trying to get Redemption to him right but which would you know what just which one you're gonna take the pool from you gonna take it from above there you gonna take it from beneath let's pray father this is what you've laid before us we all have decisions that we have to make we have choices this is real the Bible tells us to love not the world the things of this world because if we do the love of God is not in us father and and and as you just just really put it in my heart as I thought a lot about this fourth generation there's so many things are going through God I also know that this is something that that they feel the attack in right here and they need to know how real it is the influence from either the world above or the world underneath we want to be influenced from above see what what's beneath us is actually trying to pull us down but what's above us is trying to pull us up you said come up hither so Lord that's exactly what we desire to do but help us to lay aside the sins and the weights that so easily beset us I know that revival fires are burning in this place but a real revival will watch trash onto the shore god that's what that's what revival supposed to do it washes the trash out of our lives onto the shore so what we pray that you would help us O God help us Lord to hear what your spirit is speaking to us God we trust that you would just you would get the glory and you would get the honor out of our lives we we Lord we don't want to a man be pulling in the wrong direction influenced by demons we don't want that God we want heaven to be pleased won't heaven to be welcome wherever we are Father send a mighty name of Jesus that we pray amen amen the song says I surrender all and if this is just a time where maybe the Lord is just dealing with your heart and maybe there's something that you just want to surrender I want to invite you to do that I want to invite you to do that even right now the altar is always open for anyone that wants prayer but also like to let you know that the real altars the one that's in your heart and as you hear the word of God is how you respond heaviness has heaviness trying to come down and pull pull us out of the conditions and situations that were in heaven is trying to do that today it's the voice of your Savior that speaks it's the voice of your God that speaks through his word he loves you more than you can imagine and all he asks you to do is respond to his love [Music] want to sing a few courses of this song and I want you to meditate what are those things in the
