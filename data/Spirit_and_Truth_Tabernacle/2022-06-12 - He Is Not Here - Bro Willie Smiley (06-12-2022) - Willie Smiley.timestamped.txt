[57:10] not ye
[57:12] for i know that you seek jesus who
[57:15] jesus which was crucified
[57:18] he is not here
[57:21] but he has risen
[57:22] as he said
[57:25] come see the place
[57:26] where the lord lay may the lord add a
[57:29] blessing to the reading of his word this
[57:30] morning you may be seated
[57:33] i want to use as a topic this morning he
[57:36] is not here
[57:38] uh and i'm not gonna preach an easter
[57:41] message this morning it's it you know i
[57:44] know um
[57:45] oftentimes ministers they take these
[57:48] scriptures and they
[57:49] they they preach a
[57:51] easter sermon and things of that nature
[57:54] which is appropriate for easter but i
[57:56] know easter has passed but we've been
[57:59] inspired since easter
[58:02] one of the things i've learned in
[58:04] studying scriptures
[58:06] there's there's a real depth of
[58:08] scripture
[58:09] and i think i said it last time there's
[58:11] so many layers
[58:13] to scriptures
[58:15] it's that writing it and i think it's
[58:17] it's so easy
[58:19] um um
[58:20] when we look at scripture to get become
[58:23] historical right
[58:26] i'm glad brother branham preached a
[58:28] message raising him out of history
[58:31] um i'm i'm grateful that for just the
[58:34] inspiration of the holy spirit and i
[58:37] think too this this for all of us as you
[58:39] study in the scriptures and studying the
[58:42] message i mean i know you're not
[58:43] ministers you probably don't get
[58:45] inspired like a minister
[58:47] but uh i'm grateful for the holy spirit
[58:50] that
[58:51] we we can be inspired and see
[58:55] see things that a lot of times people uh
[58:58] do not see as it relates to the
[59:00] scripture
[59:02] and
[59:03] i just try to be able to be inspired by
[59:05] the holy spirit um and we i just kind of
[59:10] as we we build want to look at the life
[59:12] of christ
[59:14] and and and just try to bring out some
[59:17] things that we hope that'll help us as
[59:20] as believers is that right we need help
[59:24] is there no matter no matter how long we
[59:26] we we we've uh we've been in church and
[59:30] things of that nature we we all need
[59:33] help we all need something to to just
[59:36] kind of elevate us a little bit more
[59:38] like brother troy was just saying
[59:40] brother jack has been talking about
[59:42] change i i got inspired off with that
[59:45] too but uh i guess inspired by hearing
[59:48] the brethren um
[59:50] uh and and we we all do it's it's it's
[59:53] the scripture says um
[59:56] it's it's here a little there a little
[59:58] in in the old testament talks about uh
[1:00:01] the the children and going in there and
[1:00:04] he'll give him the land not all at one
[1:00:07] time
[1:00:08] but he'll give it to him just a little
[1:00:11] bit
[1:00:12] by a little bit by a little bit
[1:00:15] but now let's stop a minute
[1:00:18] he's going to give you
[1:00:21] a right it's not like you're not getting
[1:00:23] anything i can't stand to hear people
[1:00:26] that talks about ain't nothing going on
[1:00:28] and ain't nothing happening in church
[1:00:31] and well i don't even know what church
[1:00:33] you go to
[1:00:34] i just haven't i have to wonder what
[1:00:36] your feet know
[1:00:38] amen that that you have this this
[1:00:40] mindset that there's nothing happening
[1:00:43] there's there's nothing going on if
[1:00:45] that's the case we ain't never gonna
[1:00:46] make a rapture
[1:00:48] we're never gonna get a body change
[1:00:52] if there's nothing going on amen we'll
[1:00:55] never change
[1:00:57] we'll never see any sort of change
[1:01:00] but sometimes y'all just ought to pray
[1:01:02] for me now sometimes change just
[1:01:06] takes place
[1:01:07] in increments
[1:01:10] you know sometimes we want to see big
[1:01:13] changes
[1:01:14] dramatic dramatic no
[1:01:16] no it don't happen like that because
[1:01:19] sometimes we get ourselves in positions
[1:01:21] and places
[1:01:23] over time
[1:01:24] and you know we find ourselves just out
[1:01:26] here but that's not what i come to
[1:01:28] preach on this morning y'all keep
[1:01:29] praying for me um we i as i was studying
[1:01:33] the scripture
[1:01:34] um
[1:01:36] i realized church you know the the
[1:01:39] modern day society they want to mirror
[1:01:42] uh individuals
[1:01:44] right we want to mirror athletes you you
[1:01:47] find young kids out you know on the
[1:01:49] court and they want to
[1:01:52] you know mimic step
[1:01:54] you know uh uh
[1:01:55] lebron
[1:01:57] you know
[1:01:58] they they got all of these mimics and
[1:02:00] they want to mirror these individuals
[1:02:03] that you can do that but that won't
[1:02:05] never make you that
[1:02:07] you know patting your chest and throwing
[1:02:09] your
[1:02:10] your three up won't make you step
[1:02:13] is that right he's a he's uh filthy and
[1:02:16] wonderfully made
[1:02:18] but but i i think that when when we look
[1:02:21] at scripture
[1:02:23] uh
[1:02:24] and if we really want and i don't you
[1:02:26] know i'm like troy i love church and i
[1:02:29] want to i don't want to mirror a man you
[1:02:31] know i've sat the men as ministers and
[1:02:35] and i just don't want to be like anybody
[1:02:37] else
[1:02:38] i don't like to be put in no box
[1:02:41] don't try to force me into something
[1:02:43] that i'm not
[1:02:45] because i'm fearfully and wonderfully
[1:02:47] made
[1:02:48] but but if if i mirror anybody i want to
[1:02:51] mirror jesus christ
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:53] [Applause]
[1:02:54] i want to i want to mirror the the
[1:02:57] because when we look at christ we see
[1:03:00] the great masterpiece
[1:03:03] is that right how many believe that
[1:03:05] christ was the great masterpiece if you
[1:03:07] don't go back and read the masterpiece
[1:03:09] and listen to the tape he's the he's the
[1:03:12] the greatest example that humanity has
[1:03:15] ever had is that right
[1:03:17] uh is is jesus christ and and one of the
[1:03:21] things that
[1:03:23] uh
[1:03:24] maybe if if we could pull up the quote
[1:03:26] from perfect faith um 1963 i want to
[1:03:29] maybe read this
[1:03:32] uh quote before we get started to lay a
[1:03:34] foundation because if i don't i'll take
[1:03:37] off and then probably never read it
[1:03:40] but it'll be okay if i didn't uh i i
[1:03:43] want to read us something that just to
[1:03:45] get
[1:03:46] give us a a a little background i think
[1:03:48] it'll be important for us as as we go
[1:03:51] along um this morning
[1:03:53] uh
[1:03:55] because
[1:03:56] when we look at when we study the
[1:03:58] scripture and we look at at christ as
[1:04:00] things that you know i see that's
[1:04:03] important for me as a person
[1:04:07] in my spiritual life and in my natural
[1:04:10] life um
[1:04:11] we'll start at at um
[1:04:14] verse 63 i'm y'all bad with me my
[1:04:17] printed on work i'm
[1:04:18] troy told me
[1:04:20] oh
[1:04:21] and i
[1:04:22] i need to get like them and um
[1:04:27] this just be too much work for me
[1:04:29] this stuff don't be wanting to act right
[1:04:31] and i've been got vexed up up here uh
[1:04:35] but here here in the message of perfect
[1:04:38] faith and
[1:04:40] here's the background of it but there's
[1:04:42] a part that i want to get to where jesus
[1:04:44] christ was talking about the the
[1:04:47] disciples
[1:04:49] and and how they they failed in
[1:04:52] situations and things of that nature
[1:04:55] right he says now remember
[1:04:57] uh they had the word
[1:04:59] and the word was flesh then that was
[1:05:02] christ christ was walking with them he
[1:05:04] wasn't in them yet
[1:05:06] and i'll be the first to tell you
[1:05:08] without christ you automatically gonna
[1:05:10] fail amen as a christian
[1:05:13] is that right
[1:05:14] amen you can't have it up here
[1:05:18] you know that won't be enough you just
[1:05:20] can't have it in your spirit be
[1:05:22] religious and traditional you gotta be
[1:05:25] born again you gotta have a birth is
[1:05:27] that right
[1:05:28] we we've heard those things okay he says
[1:05:31] um
[1:05:33] and the word told them i give you power
[1:05:36] amen he said i give you power and they
[1:05:38] had the power
[1:05:41] but they didn't have the faith to
[1:05:43] operate
[1:05:44] uh the word
[1:05:47] that was in them
[1:05:49] right see you
[1:05:51] you you can have something
[1:05:53] uh but but it's it's like benjamin
[1:05:56] franklin he said i got it
[1:05:59] he was all excited
[1:06:01] he didn't have a clue of what he really
[1:06:03] had he knew he had something but
[1:06:05] somebody had the amen come on the scene
[1:06:08] and just kind of put things together
[1:06:10] thank god for it
[1:06:12] we got lights we ain't got to worry
[1:06:14] about candles we got ac praise the lord
[1:06:17] hallelujah because you know us we with
[1:06:19] ac we'd be around here fanning
[1:06:22] right so but he had something
[1:06:25] right and we have something but but we
[1:06:28] we just need to learn more about it
[1:06:30] right and how and how to operate
[1:06:33] uh
[1:06:34] in what we have
[1:06:37] is that right glory to god
[1:06:40] i i'm glad god has bought us from a
[1:06:42] mighty long way is that right
[1:06:44] uh uh because if we were still in some
[1:06:47] of the places
[1:06:48] we we just we just have our names on the
[1:06:51] book
[1:06:52] right and we won't know how to operate
[1:06:55] what we got we got something and it's
[1:06:58] and it's powerful
[1:07:00] all right
[1:07:02] uh but he says i give you power they had
[1:07:05] the power but they didn't have the faith
[1:07:07] to operate the word
[1:07:09] that was in them see what i mean
[1:07:12] but jesus had it
[1:07:14] this is the part i wanted i want to get
[1:07:16] get to
[1:07:17] jesus had it
[1:07:20] he was the word right and and see
[1:07:25] we are too and we are also
[1:07:29] y'all real quiet on me
[1:07:31] we out of word
[1:07:33] is that right we are the word
[1:07:35] all right i don't want to leave you out
[1:07:37] there on no island
[1:07:38] no
[1:07:39] we we got to get a
[1:07:41] perspective of if we're born again if
[1:07:44] we're not just religious and things of
[1:07:46] that nature
[1:07:47] right
[1:07:49] we ain't we're not here preaching
[1:07:50] religion and church membership
[1:07:53] i heard brother jack kind of kneeling
[1:07:55] that down i said boy i'm glad better you
[1:07:58] than me cause that was me preaching
[1:08:00] everybody to be shut down
[1:08:02] i'm glad the pastor was saying those
[1:08:04] things so i could amend the pastor
[1:08:06] i could i could
[1:08:08] come back but he said oh bring him here
[1:08:11] how long would i suffer you
[1:08:13] uh he had faith with his power
[1:08:17] how did he he said i can
[1:08:20] i uh can do nothing in myself why
[1:08:23] now he said he relied upon and this is
[1:08:26] the part that i kind of want to maybe
[1:08:28] get us into the layer foundation as we
[1:08:31] we go along right
[1:08:33] uh because a lot of times what we find
[1:08:36] people don't know who we are
[1:08:38] we we we really don't
[1:08:40] we don't know who we are as an
[1:08:42] individual we don't know what we got
[1:08:44] you know uh and things that people walk
[1:08:47] away from from from truth and and this
[1:08:51] is just because of a lack of knowledge
[1:08:54] or lack of understanding is that right
[1:08:57] glory to god but that was not so for him
[1:09:02] he said uh
[1:09:03] why he relied upon what he was
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:08] now i'm not i'm not just attaching that
[1:09:11] to him
[1:09:12] we got to be able to rely upon
[1:09:15] who we are it's so it's so important
[1:09:18] right who are we
[1:09:20] right now i'm not going to do the
[1:09:22] natural i'm going to do the spiritual
[1:09:23] this morning who are who are we as as
[1:09:27] individuals in this building this
[1:09:29] morning
[1:09:30] right that's that we say we're part of
[1:09:32] spirit and true tabernacle and we are
[1:09:35] but but who are we by the word it's the
[1:09:38] most important thing right
[1:09:41] he says uh he relied upon what he was
[1:09:46] he relied
[1:09:47] in knowing that he was the word
[1:09:51] important points
[1:09:53] right important points
[1:09:56] these things are so important for when
[1:09:58] when we when we're faced with with
[1:10:01] trials when when you know we're faced
[1:10:03] with situations when our children are
[1:10:06] sick
[1:10:07] well i gotta call the pastor why
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:11] i i know the scripture the scripture
[1:10:14] that says you know for us when we run
[1:10:16] into problems to call the elders
[1:10:19] but the bible also says they shall lay
[1:10:23] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:10:27] well praise the lord now now what y'all
[1:10:30] going to do brother jack is in canada
[1:10:34] right now
[1:10:35] probably with no connection maybe what
[1:10:39] thank god we got all this technology
[1:10:41] because in times gone by you couldn't
[1:10:43] have been able to reach him now we got
[1:10:45] what's happening all this you might be
[1:10:47] able to give him a call but think about
[1:10:49] it what it was you had to rely upon who
[1:10:52] you were
[1:10:53] and what's been given to us amen uh as
[1:10:56] christians is that right
[1:10:59] he said who
[1:11:00] uh so he says he had faith in god who
[1:11:03] made him
[1:11:04] the word
[1:11:07] he was god
[1:11:08] the word
[1:11:10] and they was in him
[1:11:12] and and
[1:11:13] that give him faith because
[1:11:17] he understood his position
[1:11:20] right all of these all of these things
[1:11:23] are so important for us right
[1:11:27] we have positions outside of this
[1:11:29] building
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:32] as husbands as wives we have positions
[1:11:36] outside of the local church outside of
[1:11:38] the local body
[1:11:40] and and and we gotta learn how to
[1:11:44] uh uh uh
[1:11:46] and rely upon that and understand our
[1:11:49] position and understand what goes along
[1:11:51] with that because jesus did
[1:11:55] and this is the reason why in the age
[1:11:57] that we let me finish this and then i'll
[1:11:59] i'll move on i'll pick up some speed and
[1:12:01] we'll we're going out of here right
[1:12:04] um
[1:12:05] and that gives him faith because he
[1:12:08] understood his position
[1:12:10] he know what he was because the
[1:12:13] scripture had said he was this and he
[1:12:16] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[1:12:18] was exactly what the scripture said he
[1:12:21] would be
[1:12:22] and he knew what he was therefore he
[1:12:26] relied upon what god had made him
[1:12:30] and if he did that then can't we rely
[1:12:33] upon what god has made us as believers
[1:12:38] i'm about to do a brother digs i felt a
[1:12:40] brother digs on that
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:43] see it's it's so important for us amen
[1:12:47] to know who we are and understand all of
[1:12:50] these things because these things is
[1:12:52] important
[1:12:53] listen jesus lived
[1:12:56] and and operated
[1:12:58] under
[1:12:59] conditions about like we
[1:13:02] under the the climax of the old
[1:13:05] testament
[1:13:06] we could see
[1:13:08] for the most part
[1:13:10] uh
[1:13:11] laotian conditions
[1:13:13] blindness
[1:13:15] right the the people were blinded the
[1:13:18] the evils of that day
[1:13:20] just look at how how
[1:13:22] uh
[1:13:23] evil the age that jesus christ operated
[1:13:27] in was so much so that when a man got
[1:13:29] his ear cut off
[1:13:31] right jesus picked it up and put it back
[1:13:33] on and they still cried for his blood
[1:13:36] that's that's a real evil
[1:13:39] that's real evil
[1:13:41] right so much that when when i'm
[1:13:44] watch the spirits because spirits don't
[1:13:46] die a man that was right according to
[1:13:49] the word of god
[1:13:51] and they still cried for his blood
[1:13:54] crucify him
[1:13:55] let's get rid of
[1:13:57] watch this so much so they were willing
[1:14:00] to take the wrong for the right
[1:14:03] is that right and we we right here
[1:14:06] we we right here wrong has become right
[1:14:10] and right has become wrong now
[1:14:12] and people will fight you tooth and
[1:14:15] nails
[1:14:17] regardless of of of
[1:14:19] you could present to them all of the
[1:14:21] bible that you want to and answer all of
[1:14:23] the questions that that they have but
[1:14:26] once people get up under a spirit it
[1:14:29] takes
[1:14:30] god to
[1:14:32] a man quick and uh or like you know uh
[1:14:36] paul knock them off of the high horses a
[1:14:38] whole lot of folk need to be knocked off
[1:14:39] for their horses is that right it's it's
[1:14:42] the truth glory to god but when when we
[1:14:45] look at jesus right he relied upon
[1:14:50] he knew positionally
[1:14:52] who he actually was so he was not
[1:14:56] deterred
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:59] now i'm preaching this morning
[1:15:02] right because see so often
[1:15:04] with
[1:15:05] we're thrown off
[1:15:07] with with
[1:15:08] uh little happenings and different
[1:15:10] things that take place in our life they
[1:15:12] throw us off they shake us we we shake
[1:15:14] them to the core people get so shook up
[1:15:17] sometimes they can't hardly come to
[1:15:18] church
[1:15:20] we we we christians as long as as as the
[1:15:24] power of god is moving and and we're
[1:15:27] being pulled down and preached with
[1:15:29] somebody
[1:15:30] right and and we we we're happy and
[1:15:33] things of that nature but when we leave
[1:15:36] the building and the front we we kind of
[1:15:38] like the children of israel the first
[1:15:41] little thing first a little attack of
[1:15:43] the enemy and we just ready to quit
[1:15:45] we're ready to throw our hands up and
[1:15:47] we're ready we're ready to go back and
[1:15:49] things of that nature but you don't find
[1:15:52] that when when you look at the
[1:15:54] masterpiece
[1:15:57] show me one place in the scripture where
[1:16:00] jesus christ was ever deterred by
[1:16:03] anything
[1:16:05] he was never he was never traumatized he
[1:16:08] was never moved by anything that that
[1:16:11] amen uh came in his life
[1:16:14] nothing nothing bothered jesus christ
[1:16:16] why
[1:16:17] he he understood who he was
[1:16:21] listen jesus
[1:16:23] understood scripture
[1:16:26] now i'm preaching to me when when i look
[1:16:28] at these things i'll be like ouch
[1:16:31] wow
[1:16:32] right because i mean
[1:16:35] and here's the thing jesus jesus
[1:16:38] uh
[1:16:39] lived in in the same elements that we
[1:16:42] live in
[1:16:44] come on
[1:16:47] he as as much as
[1:16:49] deity was veiled he was human
[1:16:52] he ate he cried
[1:16:54] at the grave of his friend
[1:16:57] is that right
[1:16:58] so so he had compassion he had feelings
[1:17:02] his homie died
[1:17:05] come on
[1:17:07] his homeboy died i got to bring it in
[1:17:10] 2022 on for y'all his homie died and you
[1:17:14] know i don't care gangsters cry
[1:17:19] let the homie you see him they might be
[1:17:21] in the cut with it
[1:17:23] right
[1:17:25] but he wasn't detoured
[1:17:29] got to a place and say take me where you
[1:17:31] laid him
[1:17:34] why
[1:17:35] you know what at all at all times at and
[1:17:39] every point
[1:17:40] jesus had a confidence and who he was
[1:17:44] and he had a confidence in scripture
[1:17:48] we one day we're going to realize we
[1:17:50] it's so important for us to be
[1:17:52] scripturally sound
[1:17:55] right
[1:17:56] and and not emotionally dependent
[1:18:02] well praise the lord
[1:18:03] i'm gonna get some praise up in here
[1:18:05] after a while
[1:18:07] right
[1:18:08] see
[1:18:09] and i'm learning this more and more as i
[1:18:11] go along
[1:18:12] right because i ain't no different than
[1:18:14] y'all
[1:18:15] i get in my feelings in a heartbeat
[1:18:18] right and that's a real battle for all
[1:18:21] of us
[1:18:22] come on
[1:18:23] that's a real battle for all of us i get
[1:18:26] offended
[1:18:27] i get insulted
[1:18:30] come on now
[1:18:32] right
[1:18:34] y'all y'all the same way y'all gonna
[1:18:35] feel offended and all of that and things
[1:18:37] of that nature but you know i come to
[1:18:39] realize
[1:18:41] man that's just a part of of what i got
[1:18:43] to go through as a christian but i gotta
[1:18:46] constantly try to and it's a real battle
[1:18:49] remain
[1:18:51] amen uh uh scriptural
[1:18:55] at all time
[1:18:56] understand scripture one of the things
[1:18:59] that i realize in and looking at at
[1:19:02] jesus's life
[1:19:04] jesus had an ultimate
[1:19:07] destination
[1:19:10] come on
[1:19:12] sometimes people in church don't know
[1:19:14] where they going
[1:19:19] that's naturally and spiritually we
[1:19:22] don't know what we're doing and where
[1:19:24] we're going i'm i'm i ain't trying to
[1:19:27] hurt your feelings but can i preach this
[1:19:29] morning
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] it's the truth
[1:19:35] it's so important because see
[1:19:37] jesus realized
[1:19:40] he was destined
[1:19:42] to certain things
[1:19:44] right
[1:19:45] it was only one point in scripture
[1:19:48] and i i can't say i fully understand
[1:19:51] that in gethsemane and maybe that was we
[1:19:54] could say that that was the flesh part
[1:19:56] of the man
[1:19:57] that that that actually prayed boy if
[1:20:00] there's any way you know
[1:20:02] possible come on we didn't all been
[1:20:05] there
[1:20:05] let this thing pass
[1:20:07] but but he got to the point where he
[1:20:10] said well
[1:20:11] once he find found out
[1:20:14] this going to be a real powerful
[1:20:15] statement
[1:20:16] once he found out what the will of god
[1:20:19] was he said you know what not my will
[1:20:23] wow
[1:20:25] wow
[1:20:26] now i set a mouthful then
[1:20:29] because a lot of times we we can no
[1:20:32] we we get kind of like uh
[1:20:36] balaam
[1:20:38] right he had the perfect word
[1:20:41] of god but
[1:20:43] uh he would rather be in the permissive
[1:20:45] will of god than the perfect will of god
[1:20:48] he had the perfect will of god don't
[1:20:50] don't touch it don't bother with it and
[1:20:52] things of that nature but
[1:20:55] he was willing and sometimes we do that
[1:20:59] we'd rather be
[1:21:00] in the permissive wheel
[1:21:03] because you ain't one or the other
[1:21:06] you're either operating and walking in
[1:21:08] the permissive wheel
[1:21:10] or the perfect wheel
[1:21:12] right that's the entire world
[1:21:15] right come on i mean
[1:21:18] you you you deal with different subjects
[1:21:20] scripturally
[1:21:22] and and you we look at the nominal world
[1:21:24] we look at all of these different things
[1:21:26] and what we find is either the the
[1:21:29] perfect will or the permissive will of
[1:21:32] god
[1:21:33] right but we we want to be scripturally
[1:21:37] in the uh perfect will of god is that
[1:21:41] right that's why you you have to
[1:21:43] appreciate amen uh elijah's ministry son
[1:21:47] of man
[1:21:48] brother branham however you want to
[1:21:50] place it
[1:21:51] you you have to appreciate it because of
[1:21:54] what what he taught
[1:21:56] scripturally
[1:21:58] right
[1:21:59] amen and there's a difference
[1:22:03] right
[1:22:04] it's a will
[1:22:06] but what will
[1:22:08] permissive or perfect
[1:22:10] jesus never operated in the permissive
[1:22:14] will of god he was always in the perfect
[1:22:17] will of god he understood a man
[1:22:20] from the very beginning amen what the
[1:22:24] will of the father was for him
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:28] right
[1:22:30] and and if you got after the word he
[1:22:32] would correct you
[1:22:34] because when his mother in them came
[1:22:37] your father and i whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:22:39] whoa
[1:22:40] whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:22:42] right
[1:22:44] i'll say that again
[1:22:47] right he like listen man if joseph was
[1:22:50] my father i'll be building
[1:22:53] but but
[1:22:54] you know what
[1:22:55] the what the will of my father is is
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:00] uh
[1:23:00] with the right kind of sacrifice
[1:23:03] right
[1:23:05] we the right kind of example for the
[1:23:07] church
[1:23:09] is that right glory to god
[1:23:11] my my life will show
[1:23:14] the church
[1:23:16] how to
[1:23:18] operate right
[1:23:21] glory to god
[1:23:22] you know i when i look at the the life
[1:23:25] of christ sometimes i get ashamed of
[1:23:27] myself as a christian
[1:23:30] well i ain't gonna get much praise this
[1:23:32] morning i'mma preach to y'all whether
[1:23:35] you say a man or not i don't really need
[1:23:37] them
[1:23:38] i'ma give you something to go home with
[1:23:41] is that right
[1:23:43] it's sometimes when we look at when we
[1:23:45] look at our life's lives based upon the
[1:23:47] word we should spiritually be ashamed of
[1:23:50] ourselves
[1:23:52] because because you know what it it it
[1:23:55] kind of shows us
[1:23:57] that that um we're not on the level
[1:24:01] that we should be
[1:24:03] amen as saints of god that have been
[1:24:06] around the gospel
[1:24:09] for for as many years as we we've been
[1:24:12] around the gospel
[1:24:14] is that right and and so when when hey i
[1:24:16] can use me as an example when i look at
[1:24:19] myself and i see things like this in the
[1:24:22] scripture
[1:24:23] it's like lord help me
[1:24:26] right
[1:24:27] uh
[1:24:28] i don't try to make any excuses when i
[1:24:31] go down in prayer
[1:24:32] when excuses start coming out like lord
[1:24:35] i ain't here to make no excuses
[1:24:38] come on
[1:24:39] what i did this because of this no don't
[1:24:42] make excuses and don't make people your
[1:24:45] excuse
[1:24:47] is that right i did it because i chose
[1:24:49] to do it right and wrong was before me
[1:24:52] and i made the conscious choice to do
[1:24:56] the thing that i did so so i'm not going
[1:24:59] to use my husband i'm not going to use
[1:25:01] my wife i ain't going to use my boss
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:05] no you did it you made a decision you
[1:25:08] made a choice to do it you over you
[1:25:12] overrode the the perfect will of god to
[1:25:15] do it
[1:25:18] come on we're full of excuses now
[1:25:21] god i ain't be trying to hear it though
[1:25:23] but we be trying to
[1:25:24] you know
[1:25:25] give it to him
[1:25:27] you know
[1:25:28] doll it all up and
[1:25:30] you know
[1:25:32] god this guy like look man
[1:25:34] just be real with yourself just say come
[1:25:37] i just come to the lord say lord help me
[1:25:38] i i'm just
[1:25:40] i'm still a work in progress
[1:25:44] huh
[1:25:45] we all are
[1:25:47] we all are we all still work in progress
[1:25:51] right
[1:25:53] gloria we might be looking good this
[1:25:55] morning and all that but
[1:25:57] you know we still are working but ain't
[1:25:59] nothing wrong with that you know what
[1:26:00] church i'm not ashamed to say that i'm
[1:26:02] i'm a work in progress
[1:26:05] glory to god wow
[1:26:08] right we all i was i was i was looking
[1:26:11] at
[1:26:12] uh td jake's talking to his daughter in
[1:26:15] this little some kind of little segment
[1:26:18] that they was having
[1:26:19] and you know
[1:26:21] here's a here's a man that
[1:26:24] man clearly probably
[1:26:26] is above me
[1:26:28] that's where the way the world looks at
[1:26:30] him and in a manner you know i know he
[1:26:32] nominated we we like to bash bash
[1:26:35] denominations and things of that nature
[1:26:37] but i i think we can learn some stuff
[1:26:41] right
[1:26:42] from from different people and talking
[1:26:45] with different
[1:26:46] different people you you can you can
[1:26:49] still
[1:26:50] grow and learn
[1:26:52] see i'm you know why i ain't afraid you
[1:26:54] know what i'm not really afraid of
[1:26:56] anybody because i know who who i am as a
[1:27:00] person
[1:27:01] i i understand scripture right so so
[1:27:05] i'm i'm not afraid sometimes i hear
[1:27:08] brother jack talk and he said it
[1:27:10] sunday but folas about how he he read
[1:27:14] such and such books
[1:27:16] and see you don't read other folk books
[1:27:19] and some people are crucified for that
[1:27:22] but that's just to me nonsense
[1:27:26] right
[1:27:27] but he said he read uh i can't think of
[1:27:29] a guy's name i know i was actually with
[1:27:32] brother jack when he bought them books
[1:27:35] right we we we uh we went out
[1:27:38] i don't know it's a minister huh
[1:27:41] yeah y'all helped me
[1:27:43] right now did he say it
[1:27:45] now now do we crucify him for that
[1:27:50] right
[1:27:51] because it's it's all info information
[1:27:53] that's needed but he made it he made a
[1:27:56] statement being married to his wife 37
[1:27:59] years right
[1:28:01] he still saw
[1:28:02] where he still needed after 37 years to
[1:28:07] grow
[1:28:09] kids out the house and everything else
[1:28:12] but but you know he realized in areas
[1:28:16] that still room for growth
[1:28:19] let's never get to the point or place
[1:28:22] where we feel like we don't need to grow
[1:28:25] you're only kidding yourself
[1:28:28] you're only kidding yourself that's the
[1:28:30] youngest i mean you know i've been
[1:28:32] around for a while that don't mean much
[1:28:37] right that don't really how long i've
[1:28:39] been around what i understand what means
[1:28:42] more to me is how much of what we're
[1:28:45] understanding we're applying
[1:28:48] that's becoming tangible
[1:28:52] not just intellectual because with a
[1:28:54] gift i can preach
[1:28:57] from one level to the next
[1:29:00] just depending on the inspiration of god
[1:29:04] but how much of it is a reality how much
[1:29:06] of
[1:29:07] is see
[1:29:09] when we look at jesus jesus life was a
[1:29:12] living
[1:29:13] breathing reality of what a lighthouse
[1:29:18] looks like what salt
[1:29:20] looks like
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:24] see jesus could come in in a community
[1:29:27] and people get thirsty
[1:29:30] well praise the lord
[1:29:34] jesus met the woman by the way
[1:29:37] right and all of a sudden she was coming
[1:29:40] to get some water but he had he had
[1:29:42] something that was far beyond and think
[1:29:45] about it
[1:29:46] think about it
[1:29:48] by being
[1:29:50] influenced by by being in the presence
[1:29:52] of of of jesus christ she forgot what
[1:29:55] she was coming for
[1:30:01] her whole life was transformed she
[1:30:04] forgot about the pot
[1:30:06] she probably forgot all her worries
[1:30:09] all of her cares everything was can can
[1:30:13] people say that about us
[1:30:16] come on now
[1:30:18] now cause we're looking at the
[1:30:19] masterpiece
[1:30:21] and if it and if it was good enough for
[1:30:23] christ
[1:30:24] and then if it's christ in bright form
[1:30:27] what about us this morning
[1:30:30] oh glory to god
[1:30:32] glory can can the people
[1:30:35] leave our presence and say come see a
[1:30:38] man
[1:30:40] right
[1:30:41] come see a man
[1:30:43] now you know
[1:30:45] we everybody's in that
[1:30:47] category well i'm a female no can see a
[1:30:50] man
[1:30:51] the man is christ
[1:30:54] come see a man
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:58] a man that that could influence people's
[1:31:00] lives right
[1:31:02] so much and let's think look at the
[1:31:04] conditions right because
[1:31:06] we we get bothered by
[1:31:09] laid out of sin and lay out of sin
[1:31:11] conditions
[1:31:12] these things were
[1:31:14] pathetically spoken to be here
[1:31:19] right the all of these agendas and
[1:31:22] everything things that brother jack been
[1:31:24] preaching on these things has been
[1:31:26] pathetically spoken
[1:31:28] right before these
[1:31:30] conditions ever
[1:31:32] ever fully come to maturity the bible
[1:31:36] said as it was in the days
[1:31:40] so shall it be
[1:31:43] right and and sometimes we get all
[1:31:46] throwed off for what why am i throwing
[1:31:47] off about it the bible say these things
[1:31:49] will be here
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:53] jesus wasn't moved why he was reliant
[1:31:59] see and this this is the thing when we
[1:32:01] leave here this morning it's it'll be
[1:32:03] important for us to really fully a man
[1:32:06] sit down
[1:32:07] and really look at ourselves from a
[1:32:10] scriptural standpoint get a
[1:32:12] have a scriptural absolute
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] have a scriptural absolute
[1:32:19] knowing scripturally amen who i am
[1:32:23] and and why i am
[1:32:24] based upon this little bull
[1:32:27] cause if it's just emotions and my mama
[1:32:30] take me to church buddy those things go
[1:32:32] those things gonna fall off i'm telling
[1:32:34] you
[1:32:35] look at this look at the amount of
[1:32:37] people we've seen over the years right
[1:32:40] that have come to church and where they
[1:32:41] at
[1:32:42] that's right
[1:32:44] and see
[1:32:45] by the grace of god we still here
[1:32:50] i'm grateful the blood ain't lost his
[1:32:53] power brother quaker
[1:32:55] right glory to god i'm grateful for that
[1:33:00] huh
[1:33:00] but but
[1:33:02] but think about it right
[1:33:04] it's important
[1:33:06] to be able
[1:33:07] in the midst like sister bird singing
[1:33:09] song when i don't feel nothing
[1:33:13] see
[1:33:15] regardless of what i feel
[1:33:17] i can look at the word and the word says
[1:33:19] i'm this
[1:33:21] i'm king and priest
[1:33:23] i am
[1:33:26] now am i a son of god
[1:33:28] not down the road right now i'm a son of
[1:33:31] god
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:33] and i just went off
[1:33:36] come on
[1:33:37] oh whoa we were at a quick church
[1:33:39] because we just went off we just we just
[1:33:42] yelled at somebody that pulled in front
[1:33:44] of us i do that all the time
[1:33:48] but i'm still y'all do too
[1:33:50] but i'm still a son of god
[1:33:54] huh i'm still a son of god
[1:33:57] you cannot take that away from me
[1:34:02] when we make bad decisions we still got
[1:34:05] to know i'm a son of god
[1:34:10] we all make bad decisions bad choices
[1:34:14] in so many areas but that that that see
[1:34:18] one thing about it
[1:34:20] is what
[1:34:21] flesh and blood didn't reveal this to me
[1:34:25] right
[1:34:27] so flesh and blood can't take this away
[1:34:29] from me
[1:34:30] hallelujah when i don't and sometimes
[1:34:33] man i don't feel
[1:34:35] i don't feel good in the flesh i don't
[1:34:37] feel good mentally
[1:34:39] psychologically
[1:34:41] but
[1:34:41] something that's real deep
[1:34:44] yes
[1:34:47] right come on i hope y'all got that that
[1:34:49] deep that deepness
[1:34:51] that that depth in the soul
[1:34:54] that that helps you to override because
[1:34:57] i'm quite sure jesus christ living in
[1:35:00] the flesh
[1:35:02] right
[1:35:03] and coming and
[1:35:04] not light
[1:35:08] right being different
[1:35:11] come on
[1:35:13] because we we're different and people
[1:35:15] don't like to be different especially
[1:35:17] young people
[1:35:19] right now
[1:35:21] i'm a little older now i got a few more
[1:35:23] weeks and i'll be joining the 60 clue
[1:35:28] god but i feel all right
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:34] you know i was talking to somebody he
[1:35:36] said man it feel good to be a blessing
[1:35:37] because i got friends in the past who
[1:35:39] passed away and everything else
[1:35:41] and i'm still here by the grace of god
[1:35:43] but you know the the hardest thing is to
[1:35:46] live in a society
[1:35:48] where everybody is is is going one way
[1:35:52] and you you you going upstream against
[1:35:54] the current all right
[1:35:56] that ain't easy i'm gonna say that again
[1:35:58] y'all didn't get that
[1:36:00] right
[1:36:02] cause constraint is the gate
[1:36:05] broad is the way
[1:36:08] right
[1:36:09] your broadway's a lot of folk on
[1:36:11] broadway
[1:36:12] go to new york city you'll find a lot of
[1:36:15] folk on broadway
[1:36:17] been there several times in my lifetime
[1:36:21] you know i used to live i used to be
[1:36:23] paul i'm gonna leave that alone
[1:36:26] we stayed in new york doing something
[1:36:27] foolish but i was foolish then 20.
[1:36:31] but narrow is the way and few that right
[1:36:34] and and these are principles you know uh
[1:36:38] that that our young generation needs to
[1:36:41] know it's okay to be different
[1:36:44] it's okay to sound different
[1:36:47] to talk different
[1:36:49] you don't necessarily have to have all
[1:36:51] of the the street lingo
[1:36:54] and be polished
[1:36:56] in that and and empty
[1:37:00] well praise the lord
[1:37:02] these things
[1:37:03] as parents you need to tell your
[1:37:05] children
[1:37:07] right my kids were you know they they
[1:37:10] you know they different and i mess with
[1:37:13] them and they don't especially
[1:37:15] one of my children boy they don't like
[1:37:17] that
[1:37:18] and not be just be kidding
[1:37:20] because they
[1:37:21] believe that alone children they because
[1:37:23] they sound different than me
[1:37:26] you know
[1:37:28] but
[1:37:29] can i just preach to y'all
[1:37:33] i'm black too
[1:37:36] i'm black
[1:37:37] you know but you hear them talk you'll
[1:37:39] be like
[1:37:41] put you behind that wall
[1:37:43] i'll be wondering wondering who back
[1:37:45] there
[1:37:46] then you come from round the wall oh
[1:37:49] that's all i'm saying but
[1:37:51] i'm saying that to say there's nothing
[1:37:53] wrong with that
[1:37:55] and sometimes kids need to know that you
[1:37:58] don't have to be versed
[1:38:01] right and and
[1:38:03] you know the the
[1:38:05] black american culture
[1:38:09] right
[1:38:10] it's okay to be different it's okay to
[1:38:13] teach your children
[1:38:14] see nobody told me coming up i'm just
[1:38:18] preaching that that you know it was
[1:38:20] gonna be okay for me to be different
[1:38:23] you know could i always want to be
[1:38:24] identified with with the homeboys and
[1:38:27] things of that nature
[1:38:29] instead of
[1:38:31] living a life and letting the home boys
[1:38:35] right be like me
[1:38:37] i was listening to this guy he was
[1:38:39] talking to uh i can't i can't remember
[1:38:42] the
[1:38:43] black reporter name and uh they was
[1:38:45] having conversation of the kid with the
[1:38:48] went to jail he not a kid now about 50
[1:38:50] something
[1:38:51] he went to prison when he was 19 for
[1:38:53] drug trafficking got 15 years he did six
[1:38:56] years uh
[1:38:58] in prison and the rest
[1:39:00] uh on paper to it till he got off
[1:39:03] and he was saying when he got to prison
[1:39:05] he said it was buckwild
[1:39:08] he said he was so wild
[1:39:10] he said but the oh geez he said they got
[1:39:13] together they said
[1:39:15] they saw something in him that was
[1:39:18] different
[1:39:20] right and and and
[1:39:23] he said they said if we could if we
[1:39:26] could get this one individual right here
[1:39:29] we get the rest of the young fellas in
[1:39:31] prison
[1:39:33] that's real that's real insight
[1:39:36] right that's that's real insight
[1:39:39] if we could
[1:39:40] transform this and they say
[1:39:43] they got it
[1:39:45] and when they got him
[1:39:47] he was able to change the prison system
[1:39:50] in texas
[1:39:52] because of the knowledge
[1:39:55] that he obtained he was able to
[1:39:57] influence uh sit-ins and things of that
[1:40:01] nature
[1:40:02] and they would move them around because
[1:40:04] they don't like you to have that kind of
[1:40:05] influence and power
[1:40:08] right come on preach with me somebody
[1:40:12] see
[1:40:13] the devil does not want us to recognize
[1:40:16] the power and authority that's been
[1:40:19] given to us right all power's been given
[1:40:24] to us
[1:40:25] right
[1:40:27] when he descended but sometimes we
[1:40:30] operate like we powerless
[1:40:33] and jesus right we we ran the call he
[1:40:36] never operated that way
[1:40:40] you know
[1:40:42] jesus christ had had a
[1:40:45] praise the lord
[1:40:47] i had to take up some abroad trust true
[1:40:50] our time i've been moving slow
[1:40:53] now ain't going to be that long
[1:40:54] right
[1:40:56] um um um
[1:40:57] but i lost my train of thought
[1:41:01] jesus you know
[1:41:03] i enjoy
[1:41:04] watching this jesus
[1:41:07] understood
[1:41:08] who he was
[1:41:11] right he understood his surroundings yes
[1:41:15] yes
[1:41:16] right come on church
[1:41:19] people don't
[1:41:21] these things trouble me sometimes just
[1:41:23] on on different on different level
[1:41:27] levels
[1:41:28] it's so much going on out here where you
[1:41:31] gotta understand your surroundings and
[1:41:34] the people that you're dealing with
[1:41:36] right jesus christ
[1:41:39] was was so powerful he could discern
[1:41:43] uh uh
[1:41:44] the hearts of different individuals
[1:41:47] the young rich ruler
[1:41:50] right the woman at the well
[1:41:53] see
[1:41:54] we got to have
[1:41:55] real discernment especially in this hour
[1:41:58] that we're living in and and young
[1:42:00] people and young girls and young guys

[1:42:13] by
[1:42:14] looks and features and things of that
[1:42:16] nature
[1:42:17] where where
[1:42:19] we we lose our sense of
[1:42:22] discernment
[1:42:23] vice versa
[1:42:25] of preaching
[1:42:27] don't teach this kind of stuff hardly no
[1:42:29] text books

[1:43:32] sake of folk
[1:43:33] i guarantee you that
[1:43:37] i try not to put my foot in my mouth
[1:43:41] about things but i'm i'm not gonna be

[1:43:50] all right this this won't get you
[1:43:51] shouting
[1:43:52] but i guarantee you to get you thinking
[1:43:56] we and
[1:43:57] realistically we're living in a society
[1:44:00] where we we got people interacting with
[1:44:02] people these young sisters my little
[1:44:04] nieces and things of that nature my
[1:44:06] daughters and my sons and and and and
[1:44:10] you know
[1:44:11] they got to be told these things
[1:44:14] right
[1:44:15] these young fellas that ain't married

[1:44:24] right
[1:44:25] you you gotta you gotta operate amen
[1:44:28] under another spirit
[1:44:31] right
[1:44:33] discerning things is happening dude look
[1:44:36] at the world we living in people
[1:44:38] kidnapping and all this kind of stuff
[1:44:40] and you got to teach folks something
[1:44:45] well i feel like i feel like peter said
[1:44:48] in the scripture well as long as i'm
[1:44:50] here
[1:44:52] i guess i'll just have to teach on these
[1:44:54] things that won't make you shout but but
[1:44:57] it'll give you something when you leave
[1:44:59] here to hold on to
[1:45:02] is that right i
[1:45:03] i say that i shouldn't say that i told
[1:45:05] the lord lord help me bother with folk
[1:45:07] by shout because i don't necessarily
[1:45:09] need y'all to hey man i'll shout right
[1:45:12] but i just bother with y'all
[1:45:14] i i like to pick a little bit
[1:45:16] but i don't really need it
[1:45:18] but i said lord help me not to do that
[1:45:21] because i don't know people might take
[1:45:23] offense to it and i'm not here to be
[1:45:25] offensive i'm here to educate us
[1:45:28] right but let me move on can i get about
[1:45:30] 15 minutes to just wind this up because
[1:45:32] i always have a lot to say
[1:45:35] right
[1:45:37] you know
[1:45:38] cincinnati should always tell me pastor
[1:45:40] and when you say you're gonna be short
[1:45:44] then the times you'll be real long
[1:45:47] i said i was going to be short but i
[1:45:49] might be real long
[1:45:52] she's always you could hear in the back
[1:45:55] huh
[1:45:56] she would hit me with she would hit me
[1:45:58] with one of them
[1:46:00] like not
[1:46:03] but i'm a i'm but but let's let's kind
[1:46:05] of
[1:46:06] maybe wind up because i it's so like i
[1:46:09] say it's it's so many layers and it's it
[1:46:12] is so so much to say it's so much need
[1:46:16] to be said it's so much it's so much
[1:46:19] going on
[1:46:21] that that
[1:46:22] we just need to talk about it be be real
[1:46:27] and talk about it everybody want to be
[1:46:29] hush-hushing and don't say this and
[1:46:32] don't talk about this why not it needs
[1:46:35] to be talked about
[1:46:38] why wait why wait till you
[1:46:41] to folk in jail or folk pregnant or
[1:46:44] folks messed up or folks mentals is gone
[1:46:49] before we talk about anything
[1:46:54] you know the prophet of god he talked
[1:46:56] this he talked about the young girl who
[1:46:58] lost her mind
[1:47:02] over a boy i don't want to see nobody
[1:47:04] losing their mind over old nappy head
[1:47:07] boy
[1:47:11] who don't even understand who he is
[1:47:16] right
[1:47:17] glory to god
[1:47:19] come on but you see it all the time
[1:47:24] like i say this layers there's layers to
[1:47:26] life
[1:47:28] right and you know what i'm i'm finally
[1:47:31] realizing you know what what my uncle
[1:47:33] meant when he was trying to talk to us
[1:47:35] when we was 20 and he was 40 and we
[1:47:38] didn't give him the time right to listen
[1:47:41] i realized boy i'm up now
[1:47:45] right i've got some years and some
[1:47:48] experiences you know i was working i was
[1:47:50] working with with one of my
[1:47:52] my
[1:47:54] youngest first cousin's son
[1:47:56] this week and he's not a kid he's 25
[1:47:59] years old
[1:48:00] and man that kid caused such a ruckus
[1:48:04] on the job
[1:48:06] that
[1:48:07] not that i was scared of him
[1:48:10] because i don't i ain't scared of a man
[1:48:14] but i i was i was afraid because if he
[1:48:18] would have did the wrong thing that
[1:48:20] would by by us being family
[1:48:24] it would have caused a domino effect it
[1:48:26] would put his daddy in a position
[1:48:28] and then it would put me in a position
[1:48:30] because that's my cousin but that's his
[1:48:32] son
[1:48:33] and he was blowing up at everybody and i
[1:48:36] was saying to myself look
[1:48:39] you don't want the old man and
[1:48:41] the kid the guy he was was talking noise
[1:48:44] to it's like you don't even know that
[1:48:46] man
[1:48:47] that man a preacher today but he ain't
[1:48:48] always was no preacher
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] see you don't even know his story
[1:48:59] you just see him as some older guy
[1:49:01] working on the job and you blowing up
[1:49:04] and you tense and you feel like you're
[1:49:05] ready and you know to do a will smith
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:12] he tell my he was all huffing and
[1:49:14] puffing i'm trying to i'm trying to you
[1:49:16] know defuse the situation and he you
[1:49:20] know blowing it up and
[1:49:22] i feel like just slapping him and
[1:49:24] walking away and i'm saying to myself
[1:49:26] you ain't gonna slap that dude right
[1:49:27] there and walk away
[1:49:29] so let me walk away so i'm gonna be
[1:49:31] busting you upside your head will smith
[1:49:33] got away with that because he was on
[1:49:35] primetime tv
[1:49:38] but you if you hit that guy and walk
[1:49:41] away you're gonna be in trouble and you
[1:49:43] know but these things need to be said
[1:49:46] okay let me let me get on track
[1:49:48] here here
[1:49:50] watch
[1:49:51] watch
[1:49:52] the leadership of god
[1:49:55] the destination
[1:49:57] of god
[1:49:58] look at look at the environment
[1:50:03] you you always got three kinds of
[1:50:05] believers
[1:50:07] right
[1:50:08] and and here jesus
[1:50:10] i'ma say this and it's gonna hurt
[1:50:13] there's times where
[1:50:15] believers
[1:50:16] not making believers or unbelievers
[1:50:19] believers don't understand prophecy
[1:50:24] times where believers do not live under
[1:50:27] uh a scriptural expectation
[1:50:33] believers not make believers or
[1:50:35] unbelievers because believers
[1:50:40] right it's and i'm saying this
[1:50:43] for a reason we gotta live under
[1:50:46] a scriptural expectation
[1:50:51] we gotta live
[1:50:53] pathetically
[1:50:57] y'all with me
[1:50:58] right because that's how jesus lives
[1:51:03] if you notice jesus said all times jesus
[1:51:05] went to church they gave him the bible
[1:51:08] he turned to the to the scriptures that
[1:51:10] were pertaining unto him
[1:51:12] it was it was all and i thought boy that
[1:51:15] was masterful
[1:51:17] jesus gave a master class on living like
[1:51:22] a son of god
[1:51:24] and all the times he could turn to the
[1:51:27] world
[1:51:29] and say this here is pertaining unto me
[1:51:32] and and this is pertaining to somebody
[1:51:35] else
[1:51:36] at all times
[1:51:38] right he was just gave a master class
[1:51:42] well we ought to really get in the book
[1:51:45] right and really study the class
[1:51:48] right so so that we're not failing
[1:51:52] at what we call christianity
[1:51:55] and being a christian
[1:51:57] right because jesus never did show me
[1:51:59] one passage
[1:52:01] right
[1:52:02] it was not by chance
[1:52:05] right that that jesus you know found
[1:52:08] himself a man in the position that he
[1:52:12] was in
[1:52:13] amen with the romans and and and and
[1:52:17] having to go to pilate and things like
[1:52:19] that that those things wasn't by chance
[1:52:22] right when pilar said listen like man i
[1:52:25] got power to
[1:52:26] you know dude jesus man you ain't got no
[1:52:28] power over me but what my father's
[1:52:30] giving you
[1:52:31] right jesus understood scripturally
[1:52:36] that's what he relied upon
[1:52:39] i just said to my fool
[1:52:42] that's what he relied upon
[1:52:46] he relied upon the scripture he spoke
[1:52:50] pathetically
[1:52:53] is that right
[1:52:54] he told he told the disciple he said
[1:52:56] it's a lot of stuff that i'd like to
[1:52:57] tell you but he said y'all ain't even
[1:52:59] ready for it
[1:53:01] huh
[1:53:02] there's a lot of things sometimes you
[1:53:04] know you can preach but you'll be
[1:53:05] wondering and the people ready for it
[1:53:08] right
[1:53:08] because you kind of sometimes you just
[1:53:10] wonder if i say this how they gonna take
[1:53:12] this
[1:53:14] come on preach with me somebody
[1:53:16] right listen let me tell y'all something
[1:53:18] i don't never have no ill will towards
[1:53:20] anything or anybody
[1:53:22] right but sometimes i i'll be hesitant
[1:53:25] because you know
[1:53:27] you know people take you wrong sometime
[1:53:30] but but i just can't help
[1:53:32] looking at things based upon the
[1:53:35] scriptures
[1:53:36] i was taught by a prophet i don't know
[1:53:38] who you always talk about
[1:53:41] come on
[1:53:42] well praise the lord likes
[1:53:45] i was taught by a prophet and and i
[1:53:47] realized even brother branham and his
[1:53:49] ministry amen it it was the same thing
[1:53:53] the people attitude see we got to watch
[1:53:55] our attitudes
[1:53:57] because it really shows us who we are
[1:54:00] not what we say we are but who we are
[1:54:04] right
[1:54:05] because when when when you know he
[1:54:08] preached he got the same results and
[1:54:10] that's william brown me crazy look at
[1:54:12] all the story go on the internet and
[1:54:14] look at the things that they said about
[1:54:15] her right
[1:54:18] and then people come to you and you got
[1:54:19] any problems with the message no why i
[1:54:22] don't see what you see
[1:54:25] i just don't see what you're looking at
[1:54:28] when i when i see look at the world i
[1:54:30] see life
[1:54:33] right
[1:54:34] when when i look i see myself i see what
[1:54:36] he's try he he brought to us right
[1:54:40] glory to god
[1:54:42] amen but but jesus in in his life
[1:54:46] that was an ultimate
[1:54:48] destination right
[1:54:52] and the grave wasn't it
[1:54:56] right the the grave was a a temporary
[1:55:01] stopover
[1:55:04] the grave had a purpose
[1:55:07] right you said why you say that to say
[1:55:09] this sometimes you know
[1:55:12] uh
[1:55:13] and i'll say this
[1:55:15] as christians
[1:55:17] every
[1:55:18] segment of our life
[1:55:20] right we've always got to keep in mind
[1:55:24] there's a purpose if i'm here there's a
[1:55:26] purpose in me being here
[1:55:28] just like you look at joseph
[1:55:31] right you look at daniel you look at the
[1:55:34] three hebrew boys you look at you look
[1:55:36] at jonah even jesus told him about jonah
[1:55:39] as jonah is it was three days in in the
[1:55:44] the the belly of a whale so shall the
[1:55:46] son of man be
[1:55:48] right
[1:55:49] he was speaking pathetically
[1:55:53] right
[1:55:55] there there's a
[1:55:56] power
[1:55:58] associated in prophecy
[1:56:03] and see we have got to be
[1:56:05] prophetic at all times
[1:56:09] we got to see ourself
[1:56:12] in the scripture from a prophetic
[1:56:15] standpoint
[1:56:16] and we gotta prophesy
[1:56:19] cause life and death is in the power of
[1:56:22] the tongue
[1:56:24] see and so we have got to be pathetic
[1:56:29] in what we're saying regardless of where
[1:56:31] we're at
[1:56:34] come on
[1:56:35] come on cause we get down and you know i
[1:56:38] ain't nothing and i ain't isn't it that
[1:56:40] would be saying show lane
[1:56:43] you right
[1:56:44] you're dead right hundred percent right
[1:56:48] right
[1:56:49] and instead of
[1:56:51] and it's so easy to say
[1:56:53] i'm the head and not to tell
[1:56:57] you ain't got two nickels to rub
[1:56:58] together
[1:56:59] you feel like you're the last person in
[1:57:01] line but i'm the head and not the tail
[1:57:04] i'm above and not believed
[1:57:08] and you wonder how you gonna pay your
[1:57:09] next bill
[1:57:12] huh
[1:57:13] pathetically
[1:57:15] the power of prophecy we don't
[1:57:18] understand that sometimes
[1:57:20] or we we lose sight
[1:57:24] and and the first time something come
[1:57:26] i'm a living witness i do it
[1:57:30] but but i'm still growing right
[1:57:33] 30 something years
[1:57:34] it's this right here that gives me my
[1:57:36] problems but i thank god for this
[1:57:40] that gives me my solution
[1:57:43] right amen glory to god see jesus
[1:57:48] jesus was was pathetic at all times and
[1:57:52] speaking jesus understood his final
[1:57:54] destination
[1:57:56] he told him in the book of saint john he
[1:57:58] said boy in a little while the world
[1:58:01] won't see me no more
[1:58:03] they'll be searching everywhere
[1:58:06] wander into it but you'll see me
[1:58:10] right
[1:58:12] he said
[1:58:13] it's the coming of time i ain't just
[1:58:15] gonna be with you but i'm gonna be in
[1:58:16] you
[1:58:18] and then i'm gonna lead you and guide
[1:58:19] you into all truth
[1:58:21] so so
[1:58:24] death had its purpose here's the problem
[1:58:28] here's the problem
[1:58:29] you cannot let or allow
[1:58:32] folks to be your expectation
[1:58:39] watch this watch believers
[1:58:43] right
[1:58:44] when they got there
[1:58:46] right we know the people around them the
[1:58:48] ones who put them there they was
[1:58:50] expecting them to stay there they didn't
[1:58:52] understand the power of prophecy
[1:58:54] right they didn't understand scripture
[1:58:57] they couldn't see his ministry
[1:58:59] he was all the time fighting carnality
[1:59:03] they wanted him to be a natural king
[1:59:05] with a natural kingdom he said but if
[1:59:08] that's the case then my people will be
[1:59:10] fighting
[1:59:13] but this ain't that
[1:59:16] right
[1:59:17] glory to god i didn't come to establish
[1:59:20] uh a natural kingdom on this earth in
[1:59:23] this condition i'm gonna be king of a
[1:59:25] kingdom after a while by and by
[1:59:28] after this thing has been renovated done
[1:59:31] away with burnt up by fire
[1:59:33] right but not now
[1:59:35] i come from the work of redemption
[1:59:38] right
[1:59:39] glory to god
[1:59:41] they
[1:59:41] these individuals need to get paid
[1:59:45] huh
[1:59:46] and so and so
[1:59:48] as much as the grave was necessary death
[1:59:52] was necessary sometimes it's necessary
[1:59:56] for god to allow us to be in the states
[2:00:00] and the positions that we're in
[2:00:03] but but it's not the end goal of god
[2:00:08] see
[2:00:09] death is necessary in the natural we're
[2:00:12] all going to go there set for if you're
[2:00:13] lying remaining
[2:00:15] but it's just it's just it has its
[2:00:18] purpose
[2:00:20] right
[2:00:21] but it's not the in destination
[2:00:25] right
[2:00:26] glory to god
[2:00:27] death was necessary he needed to take
[2:00:30] some keys
[2:00:34] see calvary he took the stinger
[2:00:37] he needed to get some keys
[2:00:39] see there was a work being done and all
[2:00:42] of the people around them weren't doing
[2:00:44] number crime
[2:00:47] they was in depression
[2:00:50] come on
[2:00:51] that's us
[2:00:52] sometimes it's duel
[2:00:55] church for crying
[2:00:58] depressed
[2:01:00] right jesus hadn't got a grave and a
[2:01:03] group of brethren were walking around
[2:01:06] all sad in a moping moped spirit and
[2:01:10] everything else he eased up on didn't
[2:01:12] even know who he was
[2:01:15] see
[2:01:16] that's church folk
[2:01:18] sometimes you realize how much people
[2:01:21] really know about scripture when you get
[2:01:23] to talking
[2:01:26] jesus stopped talking to them about
[2:01:28] scripture
[2:01:30] the things that were pertaining to him
[2:01:34] they didn't get it
[2:01:36] all they were doing were crying
[2:01:39] these people had no expectations for
[2:01:41] jesus outside of the grave
[2:01:44] come on
[2:01:47] and here was they come they come down to
[2:01:50] the grave five minutes
[2:01:53] they come to the grave that day after
[2:01:54] they had crucified that was just a
[2:01:57] temporary stopover sometimes our
[2:02:00] situation is just temporary stopovers
[2:02:05] god ain't gonna leave you in that place
[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:11] no matter no matter what people think no
[2:02:14] matter what people feel
[2:02:16] all
[2:02:17] all of what roman and and the the make
[2:02:20] believers you know thought god was not
[2:02:23] going to allow his son a man to stand
[2:02:26] that's that spot right
[2:02:28] his body would not rot because of
[2:02:30] prophecy
[2:02:32] the rotten ability was there
[2:02:36] but because of the word of god god said
[2:02:38] it ain't gonna be salt
[2:02:42] and see sometimes people around you
[2:02:44] expect you
[2:02:46] to be in a certain spot
[2:02:49] see
[2:02:50] when mary and them got there they was
[2:02:53] expecting jesus
[2:02:57] to still be in the grave
[2:03:01] huh
[2:03:02] these are believers they were expecting
[2:03:05] him sometimes
[2:03:07] this why you got to know who you are you
[2:03:09] got to prophesy over yourself
[2:03:13] and sometimes when you do it people may
[2:03:15] not get it right
[2:03:16] i said my food
[2:03:18] jesus was prophesying all the time of
[2:03:21] himself getting up
[2:03:23] they were not getting it
[2:03:26] huh they were just under this limited
[2:03:30] insight
[2:03:31] they they were expecting when we get
[2:03:34] there he gonna be there and we gonna go
[2:03:37] over there we gonna weep over him and we
[2:03:40] gonna cry cause they took our king
[2:03:45] they ain't here fang he said y'all know
[2:03:47] what i'm talking about y'all got
[2:03:49] children
[2:03:51] y'all got children sometimes sometimes
[2:03:53] you
[2:03:54] you talk to him
[2:03:57] like don't seem like nothing registered
[2:03:59] he's registered they just ain't got it
[2:04:01] yet sometimes
[2:04:02] right
[2:04:03] amen they got there
[2:04:05] thank god thank god and just say
[2:04:08] well i know how y'all here
[2:04:11] right
[2:04:12] i know where y'all come
[2:04:14] you ain't here
[2:04:17] right
[2:04:18] amen see that's the key phrase he ain't
[2:04:21] here
[2:04:22] having left from a given place too
[2:04:26] right
[2:04:27] or in some other place or places
[2:04:30] he's not there
[2:04:32] why wasn't he there prophecy said
[2:04:36] he wasn't going to be there
[2:04:39] right
[2:04:40] he says listen he's not here
[2:04:43] just like he said
[2:04:46] right right
[2:04:48] and listen church
[2:04:50] that's good for us if we ever gonna make
[2:04:52] it
[2:04:53] as christians out of layout a seer we
[2:04:56] gotta be pathetic we gotta think on a
[2:05:00] pathetic line
[2:05:02] we gotta see scripture pertaining to
[2:05:04] ourselves right if if we don't we'll
[2:05:08] always be the tail
[2:05:10] and never the head but that ain't what
[2:05:12] the bible said
[2:05:14] he said i'll be a i
[2:05:16] i'll be a lender not a borrower well how
[2:05:19] i ain't got no money right now that has
[2:05:21] nothing to do with it
[2:05:23] tomorrow
[2:05:25] amen three days brought a change
[2:05:28] come on now
[2:05:30] let the musicians make their way three
[2:05:32] three three days brought about a change
[2:05:36] the old timer say on the third day
[2:05:40] heroes
[2:05:42] and he did
[2:05:44] right
[2:05:47] but that wasn't the end
[2:05:49] because he had already told her i come
[2:05:51] from god i go back to god
[2:05:55] he he was going back to a position in a
[2:05:58] place
[2:05:59] but look at the people see in in and
[2:06:02] this is why as as believers
[2:06:05] we can't allow circumstances
[2:06:07] and situations
[2:06:09] to dictate to us
[2:06:11] we gotta dictate to situations and
[2:06:15] circumstances
[2:06:16] we got to be pathetic
[2:06:20] right
[2:06:21] you know what i
[2:06:23] i was saying this uh up in carolina man
[2:06:25] i'm in a position right now
[2:06:28] and i'd be like lord i i
[2:06:32] and his human reasoning
[2:06:35] right
[2:06:36] i need a roof on my house
[2:06:39] that man told me fifteen thousand
[2:06:41] dollars i could have passed out 15 what
[2:06:45] right
[2:06:48] faced with situation you don't know your
[2:06:51] way out
[2:06:52] you got to be prophetic
[2:06:55] come on
[2:06:57] you there's no way possible i could get
[2:06:59] out of
[2:07:00] where i am just looking at the situation
[2:07:03] and crying
[2:07:05] don't cry to me speak
[2:07:08] say something
[2:07:10] put a scripture amen on your lips and
[2:07:13] say it
[2:07:16] god don't want us crying
[2:07:21] god don't want us crying
[2:07:23] well
[2:07:25] no no no don't cry
[2:07:28] huh speak
[2:07:30] say it
[2:07:32] take the word and say it speak and stand
[2:07:35] there
[2:07:36] [Applause]
[2:07:41] see that's got to be your expectation
[2:07:44] right glory to god when you say it
[2:07:48] know that the same power
[2:07:51] that you
[2:07:52] prophesy is it's it's you know think
[2:07:56] about jesus i'm finna go
[2:08:00] god in the beginning say
[2:08:02] let there be light
[2:08:04] but with no light
[2:08:07] it was nothing
[2:08:09] it was nothing it wasn't nothing
[2:08:12] but there was a power
[2:08:15] that got behind the word yeah
[2:08:18] and hoovered
[2:08:19] that's what the prophet talked now i
[2:08:21] ain't got to read all these quotes to

[2:08:25] cause my computer won't work back there
[2:08:28] hoovered over the word
[2:08:30] and brought it forth

[2:08:38] if you the word
[2:08:40] you got to rely upon what god has made
[2:08:43] you
