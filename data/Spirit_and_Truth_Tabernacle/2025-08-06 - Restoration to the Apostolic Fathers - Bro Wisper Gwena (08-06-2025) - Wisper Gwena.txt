So good to be here in the house of the Lord on tonight. And um by the grace of God um we still got one more preacher hanging around. [Music] And uh by uh just just lower the the the um keyboard there for me uh in the monitor. Um but by the grace of God, we were able to just ask him to um if he would just preach one more time for us before he goes home. But brother Gwyn, amen, is with us uh on tonight. And uh I know that he as well as many other saints from UK have been with us on this journey as we have been um transitioning. and he was just telling said, "Brother Jack, this is a really nice place." I said, "But we so thank God for opening up these doors uh for us to be here." And and uh I was just reminding him in the meetings. He he said, "Let me let me speak to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle." And he said it multiple times to make sure we were catching cuz that was something specifically for us. He was telling us that, you know, as we were making this transition, a change right after meetings, it was a sign that God was elevating Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. And I I just take that as a word from the Lord. Amen. I take it as a word from the Lord. Praise God. I'm I'm very very very pleased with what the Lord is doing. So good to have the Murangamis. Amen. Back with us. They were away uh in Zimbabwe, but they made it back home safely. It's so good to have them. Amen. With us. Praise the Lord. So, let's just u maybe we'll turn change that to uh Amazing Grace. And uh let's just prepare our hearts to receive uh brother. He text me early. He said um said, "Brother, uh how much time do I have?" And I knew what he was asking me because we have always we've been on time limits for the last four years. And uh I said, "Well, for tonight, brother, we can stay till midnight." And I I just put a little smiley face next to that. So he knew that that meant no time limit tonight. Take take the watch off. Uh but uh but but I know, you know, he won't keep y'all here at midnight. The Holy Ghost might, but he won't do that. So, but we uh we thank God just to have this freedom, amen, to be able to worship the Lord and just enjoy uh his presence. Amen. I hope y'all come ready to eat tonight. Amen. One more. One more round. One more round. One more round. Once more, Lord is our prayer. Let's sing. Amen. Amazing grace. Amazing [Music] grace. How sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. I once was lost.

Well, praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. Shall we just bow our heads for a word of prayer? Precious heavenly father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we approach your throne of grace, Lord, tonight. We thankful, Father, for this amazing grace. Oh, how sweet it sounds, Lord. Father, you saved us when we were unsavvable. You saw something in us that nobody could see. And you pave for a way for us to be called your own. We're grateful tonight to be called the children of the most high. And father, how so thankful we are for the amazing grace that you've given to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Lord to be in such a place Lord surely is the doing of the Lord and Father we join them in saying thank you for what you have provided indeed Lord your grace is ever sufficient Lord we don't want to be like those lepers Lord that fail to come back to say thank you but we want to be like that one that came back to give you thanks, Lord. So tonight, we just come to join them, Lord, Father, in giving you thanks to what you have done. Father, believing that this that you have done is a sign that you can do some more, Lord. Father, for I read in the Bible that Lord, you asked and you said, "Because I have said this and you have believed and you said because you have believed, you shall see greater than this." Father, because we have thanked you for it, we shall see greater than this. We appreciate you, Lord, in your goodness. Come tonight, Lord, and have fellowship with us. We commit this service into your hands. We ask you that you can have your way in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. What a beautiful place this is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you really realize where you are? &gt;&gt; Amen. This this is really really beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we thank God for what he has done for spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord just knows how to fix things for us, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for his goodness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh glad that we don't have time limits as well. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I hope not to take too much time. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just going to go straight into the preaching of the word. I don't know whether you've got any projector. &gt;&gt; Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much. Praise the Lord. Amen. Um, Praise the Lord. Glory. In the book of Malachi chapter 4, behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. And then in the book of Hebrews chapter 4, the scripture says, "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." We may be seated. As we bow our heads here again, Father, we thank you for the reading of the word. We come now to this sacred moment. Father, the part that we just depend on you and you alone. Consume Lord, Father, my weaknesses, my inabilities, Lord. And Father, speak to us tonight. have fellowship with us is my prayer. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask that you can increase as we decrease in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I want to speak on um uh something that we've just been fellowshipping on in in in London and I want to speak on restoration to the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I would be looking at personal faith at some point. Amen. So, as I say, this is something that we've just been fellowshipping around um back back in London. I've preached a number of services around this. So, I won't be able to get into much of it. &gt;&gt; Um, but just, you know, I was just thinking we're coming out of our restore meetings. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how it's just fitted in quite well with what we've been fellowshipping around. &gt;&gt; So, I thought I'll just bring a little bit of this. &gt;&gt; Um, and u then we see how far the Lord will take us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me start from the commission of the prophet which is the scripture of Malachi 4 that I have read. The scripture says, "Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he shall tend the heart of the children to their fathers." I'm just reading the part that is very specific to us and that's the part I've marked in red there. Now we find in here the turning of the heart of the children to the fathers was the real commission of brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that this was fulfilled in our prophet brother Brham. &gt;&gt; So we we have a definite promise according to the word that our hearts will be turned back to the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the question that I've got is what is it that produced the apostolic fathers? &gt;&gt; Our hearts have got to be tended to the hearts of the apostolic fathers. But what is it that made the apostolic fathers? &gt;&gt; We we know that it was the apostolic blessing. But what is the apostolic blessing? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "Renew into us, Lord, O Lord, such faith. give unto us the great apostolic blessing of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the apostolic blessing, it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it is what produced the apostolic fathers. Are you with me? Now, if this message is to restore us back, is to turn our hearts back to the hearts of the apostolic fathers, then I've got to be able to conclude that this message is all about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Because what produced the Pentecostal fathers, what produced the apostolic fathers was Acts two. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And if that is what produced the apostolic fathers, if our hearts have got to be turned back there, then what is got to take us back there is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Outside of the Holy Ghost, we have no restoration to the house of the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; We've got no way to get back to where the apostolic fathers were. &gt;&gt; But then I find in the message in some message quarters, amen, where you know the Holy Ghost is probably not one of their majors. &gt;&gt; All right. You find in some quarters of the message where people are talking this is the time of the word and the word is got to be the word. &gt;&gt; But that's not quite exactly John 4:23, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it says the hour cometh and now is &gt;&gt; when he seeks those that will worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I'm speaking about this in spirit and truth tabernacle. So I feel at home right here. Amen. Let me say that this message starts with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This message proceeds with the Holy Ghost. This message will end with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; How does it end with the Holy Ghost? Because it is the oil that will take us into the rapture. It is the distinction that was between the foolish and the wise virgin. So this message starts with the Holy Ghost, proceeds with the Holy Ghost, and ends with the Holy Ghost. Are you there, church? Amen. and and the Holy Ghost was the principal theme of the message of brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Until when brother Brham was missing that at the early part of his ministry, it ended up costing him a lot. &gt;&gt; It caused the death of his wife. &gt;&gt; It caused the death of his daughter. What do you mean preacher man? You know when sister Hope was was dying and then brother Brham walked in and then he said, "Lord, won't you just allow her to speak to me one more time?" Then she came back. What did she say? She said, "Billy, that Holy Ghost that we've been talking about." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And she carried on and she said, "You know why I'm going, isn't it?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "We shouldn't have listened to mama." &gt;&gt; When mama had said, "Don't go with those holy rollers. Don't go with those Holy Ghost people." He says, "We shouldn't have listened to mama." And he says, "I know exactly. We shouldn't have listened to mama." Amen. But then Sister Hope said something. She said, "Billy, promise me something." And he says, "What is it?" He said, "Promise me that you will preach this gospel of the Holy Ghost until you die." &gt;&gt; And brother Brham said, "I promise." &gt;&gt; And when you go into the message, no matter what spoken word you read, &gt;&gt; Brother Brham talks about the Holy Ghost. No matter what it is, he does not finish any message without preaching about the Holy Ghost. Why? Because that's the commission of Malachi 4. When God saw that he was missing the commission, the commission had to be accomplished. Amen. By the Holy Ghost. The turning of the hearts had to be by the Holy Ghost. And when he was missing that commission, God had to come take his wife, take his daughter until he was lined up to come right in line with the word. &gt;&gt; So this message is about the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was the purpose of God giving us the Holy Ghost? The prophet of God says God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God's purpose of sending the Holy Ghost is only one purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that one purpose is that God himself might continue his work. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord in the highest. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so powerful, church. If you can get to understand this, amen, that it is God intending. Amen. For the church to continue his work, it is God himself that is going to continue his own work in the church. &gt;&gt; If you can catch this, you can know why God so much wants to give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to receive him. &gt;&gt; Because it's not about our plan. It's not about me. It's not about you. It is about God and God alone. He's the one that devised the plan. He's the one that started it all and he's the one that is going to finish it all. If you can catch this, brother, sister, there is no devil that can stop you from receiving the Holy Ghost. You can receive the Holy Ghost even now. If you catch that, this is not about you. It is about the program of God. It is about the purpose of God. He started it and he will finish it. And I'm so glad that my God what he starts is more than able to finish it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So the turning of the hearts is a God program. That's why he had to send Malachi 4. So in this day and in this hour, hearts will be turned. &gt;&gt; Whether the devil likes it or he doesn't, but hearts are being turned. Hearts have been turned because he sent the message of Malachi 4. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Then in 1954, the prophet says, "Brother, I'm telling you, it's the evening lights are shining." The apostolic doctrine, the same apostolic baptism, the same apostolic feeling of the Holy Ghost, the same apostolic signs and wonders are peeping through to the Gentiles like they did the Jews back there at the early morning. Here it is in the setting of the sun. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory. So 1954, the prophet of God begins to tell us that the same apostolic doctrine had now come back. The same apostolic baptism had now come back. The same apostolic feeling of the Holy Ghost had now come back. And not only were these Amen. But he also says together with the same signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Why is it important that it gets to the signs and wonders? Because it is the proof of the pudding. Glory to God that what you are saying you have got it is producing the results. When it starts to produce the results then I don't care what critic would want to rise because then God will speak for himself. &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; Amen. See this was his purpose to continue his work &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; in his church. That's right. Then in 1958 he stood and he said we believe in an apostolic church &gt;&gt; teaching apostolic blessings &gt;&gt; for the people for the peoples of this day. We believe in the full gospel &gt;&gt; and we believe that all the signs and the wonders that were spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returns. We believe in those things and believe that they are to be set in order. That the church has its order. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like this. We believe &gt;&gt; in an apostolic church. &gt;&gt; We believe in the teaching of an apostolic blessing. &gt;&gt; We believe in the full gospel. &gt;&gt; And we believe these things have got to be set in order. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or do we believe in the full gospel? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say this must be the doctrine of every message church. &gt;&gt; Because this is not brother whisper saying so. This is not brother Jack saying this. This is the prophet saying this. And this is in church order. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So this has got to be the doctrine of every message church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when you believe something then you state what you believe. Not only do you state what you believe, then you teach what you believe. &gt;&gt; And when you start to teach what you believe, you create an expectation of what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then at some point, you will receive what you believe. &gt;&gt; Or you didn't hear what I said. When you state what you believe and when you teach what you believe, you create an expectation of what you believe. Then one of the fine days what you have taught, what you have believed, what you have stated, what you have expected, you will experience it somewhere along the way. I believe one of these days we will see the full apostolic church back in action again. But we got to keep saying it. We got to keep believing it. We got to keep teaching it. Can you say amen? Then one of the fine days there will be a full manifestation of those things that we have believed. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God tells us there was a time he was a little confused about you know the different denominations that were out there. It says there was some 900 and something different denominations. This one says we've got the truth. This one says we've got the truth. Everyone was saying we've got the truth. And the the prophet says, "So where do we find the truth then?" Then one day when he was talking to his mama, he said, "Mother," this is now in the message uh a true sign that's overlooked. I said, "Mother, I went back to the Bible and I found out the way those first apostles, what kind of a church they had, how they taught, and the things they did. I did it just exactly the way they did it, the way the Bible said, and I got the same results. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when the prophet now was wondering what is the correct direction, then God said to him, go back into the Bible, &gt;&gt; see what they were doing in the Bible. And he says, I went back into the Bible. I found out what type of a church those first apostles had, what kind of a church they were running, what is it that they were teaching. I taught exactly the same. I did exactly what they did and then I got exactly the same results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got the apostolic results &gt;&gt; when he went to apply the apostolic formula. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But out of this journey, then the prophet also found out now he's within the Pentecostal people. Then he found out those that were seemingly believing in the apostolic blessing, but he still found out that there were certain things that were not in the church. So the prophet then comes in everlasting life and how to receive it. And he says, "Look, see, everyone has always said, "Brother Bill, nobody understands you." Well, I I may be just a little queer, but you know, I I don't mean to be, but I have ideas of things and my convictions. I'm thoroughly convinced that many things that's in the scripture that's apostolic that we don't carry out this day. &gt;&gt; He says, "I have ideas of things and my convictions." This was a real conviction of the prophet. And he says, "I've got ideas and I've got convictions and I'm thoroughly convinced that there are things that's in the scripture that's apostolic that we don't carry out this day." &gt;&gt; And that brings a question, what are those things that are apostolic? &gt;&gt; And yet we were not we're not being carried out back then. &gt;&gt; Next question is, are we carrying them out in the message of the hour? All right. &gt;&gt; Do we find those things in the message of the hour? Am I reading the prophet church? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, when I begin to see something like this, then my heart begins to hunger. &gt;&gt; My heart begins to ask, Lord, what is this all about? If if it is about the apostolic church, if these things are apostolic, then I want to be able to experience it because my heart is got to be turned back to the apostolic fathers. And if my heart is to be turned back there, I want every apostolic attribute to be part and parcel of the church that I am in &gt;&gt; to believe anything less than this is to shortch changing ourselves. &gt;&gt; And I'm tired of living underprivileged. I not even want to be part of a church that is living underprivileged. I want to climb to the right level. If these things are promised in the word, it means they are there for the taking. It means they are there available for us to have them. Can you say amen somebody? &gt;&gt; But what are they and how do we get them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if they are apostolic then it means that they must come with the apostolic blessing. &gt;&gt; Therefore they must come with the Holy Ghost. Therefore they are hidden in the Holy Ghost. They are a package of the Holy Ghost that when you dwell in the Holy Ghost somewhere along the way, it will lead you to the apostolic things that need to be carried out in the church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or can we identify these? &gt;&gt; Now, each one of these is a sermon in its own right. So, I'm not getting very much into them tonight. Amen. But I'm just hitting the highlights here. The prophet of God in the message thirsty says, "And in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local body, the local church." That's apostolic. &gt;&gt; That's right. Glory. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's apostolic. If I ever knew of it, that's right. &gt;&gt; So it means when a church becomes apostolic, then it will have the nine spiritual gifts working in that local body. And he says that's apostolic. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; In another place he says in every local assembly this must be there. &gt;&gt; Is that right church? &gt;&gt; Amen. And it also means Amen. If if this is what is apostolic. Amen. He says that's apostolic. It's it's got to be in there. Hallelujah. I'm still on the message thirst. He says that's apostolic. If I ever knew of it, that's right. And if this is apostolic church, it means anything that is not that is not yet hitting the mark of apostolic church. &gt;&gt; It means we are still under privilege somewhere. &gt;&gt; But he says in the message, God's provided way of dealing with sin. He says the church is to be operated by nine spiritual gifts, &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. He has gifts and signs and wonders in the church. That's God's provided way of perfecting his church. &gt;&gt; We try anything else, theology, teaching, anything else, it will never work. It never did and it never will. &gt;&gt; That's powerful, church. &gt;&gt; But it's thus sayith Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; That's apostolic. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've identified one. Can I bring another? &gt;&gt; Amen. We take another one here. He says in the message, I I'm the resurrection and the life. And God still has angels &gt;&gt; and they visit the people. &gt;&gt; Not a worship of angels, but angelic beings who are attributes of God sent forth to minister to the church through the people. Oh my, how short we are of the real apostolic church today of the blessing. That's good. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, angelic visitations &gt;&gt; is apostolic. &gt;&gt; And how short we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But church, we can't create angels. &gt;&gt; We can't send them to us. &gt;&gt; God sends them. &gt;&gt; But it has to take a people that have hit a certain atmosphere. It has to take a people that are expecting certain things. You get according to expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, this is a real shocker to many. &gt;&gt; In a day, amen, where we have had a message where the angel of the Lord came to the prophet, the moment you start to want to talk about angels, Amen. It looks like you want to go into the prophets area. No, I'm not going into the prophets area. I'm going into what he taught that we must have as the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Is that right, church? &gt;&gt; Let me read another quote. He says, "Now angels has always been ministering spirits that sent to the church." Is that right? &gt;&gt; All through the apostolic age or apostolic age, they had ministering angels that went with the apostles, the disciples. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And most always they appeared to them in a form of a light. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So all down through the apostolic age, they had ministering angels that went with the apostles, the disciples. &gt;&gt; Now our hearts are to be turned back to the apost apostolic father's hearts. And if our hearts are to be turned back there, then these are the things that we've got to be expecting. &gt;&gt; Now somebody says, "Oh, that that was the apostles and it's got to end with the apostles." It's like the people who says, you know, the the the Pentecostal blessing ended with the apostolic age, but the brother Brham would ask the question, can you tell me where it started? &gt;&gt; It says, I can tell you when it started now. You tell me where it ended. &gt;&gt; If you can't place a finger of where it ended, then it means it is still going on even right now. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Back then, Amen. They had angelic visitations. Where does the prophet take this? Right in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Can I take one apostolic example? &gt;&gt; Amen. And this we find in Acts chapter 8 26. The Bible says, "And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philillip, saying, arise &gt;&gt; and go towards the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert." &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord spoke unto Philillip. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. Who spoke unto Philillip? &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord spoke unto Phillip. &gt;&gt; Well, I can pull several scriptures right here because the angel of the Lord also spoke unto the centurion. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord. Now, if I had taken Paul or if I taken Peter, you probably say, "Oh, those were apostles." But I have just taken Philillip who was a deacon in the church and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him. Then I text as the centurion who was not even in the message. &gt;&gt; He wasn't even in the message but he was destined to be in the message. He was hungering for something that is right. And the angel of the Lord spoke to him and he said send for Peter. And at the same time the angel of the Lord hallelujah through the Holy Ghost ministered unto a Peter to say I'm sending people to come to meet you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, angelic visitations are apostolic. &gt;&gt; Can I take another? &gt;&gt; I'm just laying a background to where I'm going to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then in the 70th week of Daniel, he says, "And the messenger of this age was to come in the power of Elias." That's right. And he was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. bring the Pentecostal remnant that's left back to the true apostolic faith. &gt;&gt; So I see an apostolic faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the apostolic fathers, they came with an apostolic faith. &gt;&gt; And for that faith to have been identified as apostolic, it means that there was something peculiar about this faith. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that that faith that was an apostolic faith was in two parts. &gt;&gt; What are the two parts, preacher man? I believe that the there was the faith. &gt;&gt; Because Jude comes and he says, "Let us earnestly contend for the faith." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And the faith, the prophet of God teaches us that it stands for the religion. &gt;&gt; Their way of worship, the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was the faith that came with the apostolic fathers. Then there is also faith which is the substance of things that are hoped for. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And then there is the gift of faith which is one of the nine spiritual gifts. &gt;&gt; So that's the gift that then works miracles in the church. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's the faith that produced miracles. Amen. It is the faith that was inside of John and Peter when they went to the gate called beautiful and they said silver and gold have we none but such as we have give we unto you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? It was the faith that was inside of Peter that when the prayer lines were getting too long and there was not enough time to lay hands on the sick. They just said line them up on one side and the shadow of Peter was healing the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; This the the faith of Peter was even in his shadow. &gt;&gt; I wonder where is our faith church. If the faith of Peter was even extending into a shadow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. It was the faith that was in Paul that when aprons were taken out of his body, when they went to be laid on the sick, the sick got healed. So the power of her healing was even inside of the clothes of Paul. &gt;&gt; Aprons that came from Paul, they went and they started to minister healing. Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that that was the faith of the apostles. But I want to zero it in and say that faith has got to get to a place where it becomes a personal faith. &gt;&gt; It should not be a group faith. It's got to come to a place where it becomes an individual faith where it is a personal faith. And that's what I want to speak on tonight. Speaking about a personal faith &gt;&gt; and let's start it from the book of Malachi 4. Amen. It says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet." Now, I want you to watch the focus of the scripture here. It is you. So in other words, the ministry of Malachi 4, it is a personal ministry that identifies every individual. God sending you Elijah the prophet. God is not talking about your next door neighbor. He's not talking about your mama. He's not talking about your papa. God is addressing you directly to say, I will send you Elijah the prophet. What for? and he shall turn your heart back to the heart of the Pentecostal fathers. Are you with me church? &gt;&gt; So the focus of the gospel of Malachi 4 is God will come to an individual level. Is God will come to a place where it becomes personal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the gospel becomes personal, then the gospel will produce inside of individuals the same attributes that we find in the book of Acts. I want to say church of the living God, I don't want a God of history. &gt;&gt; What good is a God of history? We want a present day God. &gt;&gt; We want the God of yesterday to be the God of today, he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Can you say amen? What he did for Peter, he can do for spirit and truth. What he did for Paul, he can do for somebody in here. what he did for Philillip he can do for somebody in here say amen somebody &gt;&gt; brother he's got to get to a place where the faith amen becomes a personal faith &gt;&gt; hallelujah so as the gospel is being preached you've got to come under expectation that God is going to deal with me as an individual I'm forgetting who is sitting next to me I'm forgetting who I came to church with I want God to deal with me as an individual. &gt;&gt; But the danger that we find church is people get used to the gospel. &gt;&gt; We come to church so many times until when the gospel is being preached, we don't appropriate faith personally. &gt;&gt; We can easily hear things and we say, "Oh, we have heard about that one before." And I like always to say that message people like to finish the quotations &gt;&gt; that whilst the preacher is preaching on they know exactly how the quotation ends and they can begin to recite it upon their hearts and they know exactly which way the quotation is going. You know what? You're getting too used to preaching. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells me of the story of the old salt. &gt;&gt; He tells me of a certain man that was going to the sea. And this man was under so much expectation. He had never been to the sea and he was longing to see the sea. And he met this man who was the old salt who was a sailor. Amen. Had been a sailor from his youth. He was born on the seas. And this man said, "Oh, where you going, man?" And he says, "I'm going to the sea. I he started describing what he was expecting to see." And the old soul said, "There is nothing to eat there. I was born there." &gt;&gt; That's right. And the prophet says he had gotten so used to it until it did not intrigue him. &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says here, you see, he had saw it so much and enjoyed it so much until it become common. That's what you Americans have done to Christ. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I'm speaking to Americans. That's what you Americans have done to Christ. He's been so good to you. You seen him open the eyes of the blind. Some wouldn't walk across the street to see it again. You have seen him heal the sick. You've seen him perform miracles. You've done all you've done all this and it's so common. It doesn't you &gt;&gt; people get used to it. The prophet here was talking about people getting used to miracles happening. But let me rezero it down and say we getting used to preachers. &gt;&gt; We're getting used to pastors. We getting so used to good preaching &gt;&gt; until you just know how to say amen and it ends right there because you're used to good preaching. Brother, let me tell you, never never get used to preaching. &gt;&gt; Never get to a place where the gospel becomes common to you. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "It's been my great mystery in my life." How can the scriptures be so plain and the people sit there and know that the spirit of Christ is in the room and can hold your peace? &gt;&gt; I can't understand it lest their eyes are not open. He's so good. &gt;&gt; Or do you hear what he's saying here? How can the scriptures be made so plain and then the people sat there and know that the spirit of Christ is in the room and yet you hold your peace? &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to be moved by the gospel. &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen. Not to be spectators in the church, but to be a people, hallelujah, that are taking the word, that are chewing the word, that are feeding upon it as it is coming forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says the thrill, the blessedness of knowing the reason Lord Jesus Christ stand in our midst should send every soul to the heights beyond anything this world could thrill. It should do something to you. It should take your faith to you would open every door of faith and everything else. Say, "Lord Jesus, take full for possession of me." Nowise &gt;&gt; the preaching of the gospel is got to shake somebody. The preaching of the gospel is got to shake your faith &gt;&gt; until it should take you to a place where all things become possible. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about every service that you come into church. That the preaching of the word, it should elevate you to such a place that if you came sick, you should go back home healed. &gt;&gt; That if you came with an expectation, that expectation has got to be met in the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet tells us of the story of another woman that had a little boy. &gt;&gt; This boy the when the boy was born the woman thought that the boy was just normal. &gt;&gt; But at a certain point the prophet of God started to realize that this woman amen or this woman started to realize rather that this child there was something abnormal about her. So the the woman went into a shop and she started picking some things that would amaze a child and she would shake it before the child and the prophet says the woman said that child would just sit and stir. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Then she jumped to the next shelf, picked something else, waved it before the child and that child would just stir. &gt;&gt; And then jumped to the next shelf, picked something else, waved it before the child and the child would just stir. And somewhere along the way, she let out a scream. And the people rushed and said, "What's going on?" She said, "The child just stares." &gt;&gt; And the prophet then turns it. Amen. And he brings it to the church to say, "It's like us in the church, people just sit and stare." &gt;&gt; No matter how much the preacher preaches, Amen. No matter how much the preacher is sweating, Amen. But the people sit and stir. &gt;&gt; The prophecies, I think that's a great deal with the church today. God has shook every kind of a gift and things that could be put before the church and it just sits and stares in space. &gt;&gt; Well, that was a very nice meeting, &gt;&gt; but it don't move them at all. They're waiting for the service land and come say to the pastor, "Oh pastor, that was a beautiful sermon." &gt;&gt; But when they were in church, they were sitting and they were staring. I say to the church back home, I've been preaching for too long now that I don't even want you to tell me that the sermon was good. I'm not looking for your accol for your echoes. Amen. I'm looking for a people that as the gospel is going forth, they are ready to jump into the waters. The purpose of the preaching of the word, it is to stir up the waters. And when the waters are stirred up, somebody's got to jump into the stirred waters. Somebody's got to jump in and say, "That was for me. That was God dealing with my situation." Can you say amen, &gt;&gt; brother? As the gospel is coming forth, it must shift your position. &gt;&gt; It must change your belief. &gt;&gt; It must change your faith. Hallelujah. It must prick your heart until it gets to a place where you will begin to say, "Oh my, God is dealing with my case. &gt;&gt; God is speaking to me directly." &gt;&gt; But alas, it is not so. What is the problem? &gt;&gt; The problem is what we find in the book of Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews 4 says, "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it." &gt;&gt; For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them, but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The scripture here was talking about the prophet Moses time. And during the time of Moses, Amen, they had the pillar of fire with them. They had miracles everywhere with them. The word that was preached at that time was thus says the Lord. &gt;&gt; What Moses preached, God came and he backed it up. &gt;&gt; When Moses said we are going out of Egypt, God came with the plagues in Egypt, but he spared them in Gosh. &gt;&gt; God reigned plague after plague and they were witness to it all. They went through the Red Sea. Amen. Until it parted and they went on dry ground. God showing them that he was with them. &gt;&gt; Then when they were in the wilderness, the pillar of fire was present with them. &gt;&gt; They were led by a cloud by day, by a pillar of fire by night. &gt;&gt; But they were so used to it until it became common to them. They thought it was an ordinary cloud. And they thought the pillar of fire was just an ordinary light that was giving them light. I wonder church, how could those children of Israel rise up to play when the pillar of fire was on top of Mount Si? &gt;&gt; How could they rise up to play when the cloud was covering them every day? &gt;&gt; How could they rise to play when the pillar of fire was their guiding light? &gt;&gt; But yet they rose up to play. God help us &gt;&gt; getting used to the things. Amen. Now Paul comes and he says the word that was preached unto them, it did not profit them. And what was the reason why it was not profit? Why it did not profit them? Because it was not mixed with faith. &gt;&gt; Let me say many times the prophet of God comes and he says don't mix the word. &gt;&gt; Don't mix the word. You can't hybrid the word. But I'm saying there is a place in the scripture where we are supposed to mix the word. &gt;&gt; And this is the only place I find where we are supposed to mix the word. What do you mix the word with? You mix the word with your faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; You've got to mix the word with your faith. What does it mean to mix the word with your faith? Oh, I love the message. The prophet of God says, "Remember the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." Oh my brethren, let me stop here for a minute. No matter how much the word is preached, how well you like the way it is preached, unless you yourself are a partaker of it. &gt;&gt; It won't do you one bit of good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the word is good. You may like the way the word is being preached, &gt;&gt; but unless you yourself becomes a partaker of that word, &gt;&gt; it does not profit you in any way. &gt;&gt; So the purpose of the preaching of the word is that every individual can get to a place where they become a partaker of the word. &gt;&gt; So the gospel has got to move you from just hearing the word to becoming a partaker of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to come to a place where you handle what has been preached. &gt;&gt; You have to have a manifestation of what has been preached. &gt;&gt; Until there is a manifestation of what has been preached, you have not yet seen the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It means something is still lacking. Amen. What is it that is lacking? Amen. The prophet of God, he goes on and he says, not being mixed with faith by them that hated. &gt;&gt; They seen the miracles of Moses. They said, "That's pretty good." And they walked over. They seen him perform miracles and they seen the pillar of fire maybe or heard them talk about it. Oh, that's all right. But it wasn't mixed with personal faith. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't mixed with personal faith for as soon as they got to the wilderness, the everyone begin to murmur. &gt;&gt; So what makes you a partaker of the gospel? It is when you begin to mix the word with a personal faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not talking now about faith that comes to the entire church. Yes, it can be in the entire church, but it is working individually. It is a personal faith. We talking now of a faith that is in you as an individual &gt;&gt; where you as an individual when the word is coming forth. You are mixing the word with your personal faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And God said because they have doubted it, it was sin. Don't doubt nothing. &gt;&gt; Believe. Don't doubt. No matter how hard the case is, believe it. Well, let me say to somebody tonight, I don't care what you're going through. &gt;&gt; I don't care how hard your situation is. I don't care what the devil has been trying to say to you, but don't doubt nothing. You start to believe that God is able. All things are possible to them that believe. Or do I have a believer in here? No matter how long the case has lingered for, but I want to say as the word is going forth, start to mix it with faith, personal faith. Hallelujah. And say to yourself, "My God is visiting me. &gt;&gt; Nothing is too hard for my God." &gt;&gt; There's got to come an hour when God steps into your home when God says, "I'm now solving your prayer request." You have prayed about it for a little while, but now the hour for you to see the manifestation of your prayer request has now arrived. Who here has a prayer request? Who here has been longing for something? I'm here to say to you tonight, no matter how long you have waited for, when you mix the word with your personal faith, God will come to deal with your situation. Even tonight, &gt;&gt; so I believe tonight can be a different night. I believe tonight can be a night where somebody can have a personal experience with their God. Where somebody can walk out of this church with a personal testimony to say it was on that Wednesday night God he spoke to me in a special way and I mix the word with my personal faith and God did something to me. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is what we find with Cornelius that when Peter went to the house of Cornelius, my Bible reads in Acts chapter 10, while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because on that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit. Or let me just take you to the house of Cornelius. Brother, while Peter had speck, I don't believe Cornelius was just sitting down and staring. I don't believe Cornelius was just staring into the air. I believe Cornelius, as the word was going forth, Cornelius was taking that word, he was mixing that word, mixing it with faith. While Peter yet spent, hallelujah. than the gospel. Amen. It hit the heart of a Cornelius. And Peter, glory to God, whilst he's carrying on preaching, then he sees the Holy Ghost come and fall even on Cornelius. &gt;&gt; Remember this man had not been baptized. &gt;&gt; He was not even baptized. Can you say amen? Yet the Bible says, "Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." But it was not so with Cornelius. Cornelius did not wait to be baptized. As he started to mix the word, as he started to mix the word and as he mixed the word with personal faith, God said, "Yes, I know what I said in Acts chapter 2, but because you are mixing the word so much with your personal faith, I'm going to jump some processes. I'm going to jump some processes. I'm going to jump the requirement of baptism and I'm going to take you to the Holy Ghost." Oh, let me say to somebody tonight, if you are mixing the word, God can jump processes. God can jump processes. Oh, come on, somebody believe here. Let me prophesy and say, somebody shall get a job that they've not even applied for. Somebody shall get a promotion that they've not even looked for. Before you even ask for it, God jumps some processes. Can you say amen? Can you say amen? Somebody can receive a house without even applying for it without even going for a mortgage. God can open up a door. If you are mixing the word tonight, God can jump some processes. Oh, can I have a believer in here? Can I have a believer in here that while Peter had spake, the Holy Ghost started to fall upon the people. Whilst the gospel is going forth, may the same Holy Ghost come upon somebody tonight. May the same Holy Ghost Oh, come on. Mix the word with your personal faith. Mix the word. Let God visit your home. Let God step into your househ. May the God of the Bible come and visit you directly. Come on, let's mix the word. As you mix the word with your personal faith, then the word becomes an appropriated message. [Applause] Glory to God. Glory to God. I believe in such an atmosphere, anything can happen. Anything can happen. You came to church with a prayer request. You can receive your desire. You can receive your answer. While Peter yet speck you don't need to wait for the end of the service. Cornelius did not wait for the end of the service. While Peter yet speck the Holy Ghost fell upon the people and the Holy Ghost came and anointed the people whilst the message is going forth tonight. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive your heart's desire. Receive Amen. that which you have been longing for. Oh, come on. Give the Lord a hand of praise somebody. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God in the highest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen and amen. You know the other thing I like about Cornelius. Oh, I love this Cornelius. Cornelius was a gentile. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He was a gentile. He was not a Jew. So, he was testifying of the coming of a gentile faith in an apostolic age. Brother, let me say God had to make sure that there was also Gentiles &gt;&gt; that broke through &gt;&gt; in the apostolic age so that we Gentiles can see that it is possible. &gt;&gt; And Gentiles have a gentile faith. &gt;&gt; Do you know what a gentile faith is? A gentile faith does not wait for the laying on of hands. &gt;&gt; That's a Jewish faith. Gyrus said, "Come to my house and lay your hands upon my my my daughter." But when it came to Cornelius, hallelujah, or rather to the centurion, the centurion said, "Just speak the word only and my servant will be healed." Somebody say, "Brother, whisper, just preach the word only, and I'm going to receive what I desire." Yes, you can receive it. If you hear the word, the word has got everything for you. Whatever your heart's desire is, the word has got a solution. Just mix the word with your personal faith. And as you mix the word with your personal faith, things will begin to take place. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. We are Gentiles, man. We We are Gentiles. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord in the highest. Glory to God in the highest. That's a personal faith. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you the Bible says faith cometh by hearing, hearing by &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; So the level of word you hear &gt;&gt; will determine the level of faith you get to. [Music] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? The level of word you hear will determine the level of faith that you get to. Let me say in this message we have the zenith of the word. That's why it is only the bride that will make it into the rapture because it is the word that will give us a rapturing faith because what we are hearing is got enough capacity to change our bodies &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, if this message has the capacity to turn our bodies in the twinkling of an eye, let me say it has got the capacity to snap you out of sickness. It has got the capacity to change your condition in a second &gt;&gt; until people will wonder was this the same person that we were with yesterday. &gt;&gt; You might have come from work. Amen. But when you go back to work something is different and they say what happened. You tell them I was in church and I met Jesus. &gt;&gt; I met Jesus. Oh, glory to God in the highest. I don't care what the situation is. God is depending on you &gt;&gt; because he knows inside of you is enough capacity to be able to rise above that which you're going through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you that you cannot get out of your situation. &gt;&gt; You know, you know the reason why people end up committing suicide is because they've given up. &gt;&gt; Brother, as a Christian, you cannot give up &gt;&gt; until God says it's over. It's not over. And God can only say it's over when he takes you out of this world. As long as there's still breath in you, keep believing that any moment Jesus is going to step in. &gt;&gt; The devil tells you, "You've been waiting for this for too long." Tell them, "Father Abraham, waited for 25 years. I've not even got to 25 years." My God will step on the scene. My God will change the situation. Oh, you can rise above your condition. The devil is a liar. Don't allow that devil to lie to you. I don't care what the situation is, brother, sister. God is going to do something for you. &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet of God says here. He says, "Watch what's taking place now. The church is rising, brother. The power of God, the tide is high. Moving on. We are going from deeper depths and higher heights. The oldfashioned apostolic power of God that once dwelled in the disciples is coming back in the disciples again. That's exactly right. And I believe that things that you have never heard about is right now in the making. [Music] I can pause right there and I can prophesy to spirit and truth and I can say things that you have never heard about is right now in the making. Right now, God is fixing something that you have not even heard about. Something new, &gt;&gt; something that you have not even imagined. God is going to send it your way that you already have been given a sign that God has paved the way for you to have a new place to worship. It is a sure sign that something that you have never imagined. Maybe I take you a few months ago, maybe last year or wherever, did you ever imagine that you could be here? But tonight you are in here. Let me tell you what you are not imagining in your home is coming to your home. What you're not imagining for your daughter is going to happen to your daughter. What you are not imagining for your son is going to happen to your son right now. Things are in the making. I want you to start thanking God for the things that are in the making. Or give him some praise for things that I or you don't need to know what they are. Just thank him to say, "Lord, I thank you that there is something that I've never heard of. Something that has never happened. Something brand new is fixing to happen right now. Oh, give him some praise, somebody. Give him some praise, somebody as you worship him, as you give him some praise. He's baking it right now. A cake is about to tumble into your own camp." Hallelujah. A cake is about to tumble like it tumbled. Amen. In the camp of Gideon, [Music] &gt;&gt; good news is coming your way &gt;&gt; where you have been hearing a lot of bad news but things are turning around somewhere. Mix the word. Mix the word with your personal faith and say it is me that you have been speaking to Lord. It is me that you send the preacher for. It is me that is receiving this tonight. God bless you. You can receive it if you believe it. &gt;&gt; You can receive it if you believe it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says no matter how much the word is preached, how well you like the way it is been preached, unless you yourself are a partaker of that, it won't do you one bit of good. But it wasn't mixed with personal faith. &gt;&gt; Now I, as I'm beginning to close, I want to ask, what is personal faith? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is personal faith? &gt;&gt; Personal faith is a faith that personalizes &gt;&gt; promises. &gt;&gt; Ordinary faith &gt;&gt; will say, I believe that promise. and it stays there. &gt;&gt; But personal faith &gt;&gt; says, I believe that promise, &gt;&gt; but I'm the person &gt;&gt; that shall fulfill that promise. &gt;&gt; Am I speaking to somebody in here? &gt;&gt; Personal faith personalizes things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Personal faith. The prophet says here, Joshua stopped the sun. Is that right? Somebody says, "All things are possible with God. Nothing impossible but all things are possible to you also. &gt;&gt; That's personal faith. &gt;&gt; All things are possible is ordinary faith. &gt;&gt; But personal faith says all things are possible to me. &gt;&gt; I want you to shout it out tonight. All things &gt;&gt; are possible &gt;&gt; to me. &gt;&gt; To me. &gt;&gt; To me. &gt;&gt; To me. &gt;&gt; To me. As you shout it out, let it happen to you. That's personal faith. &gt;&gt; Personal faith will take a scripture and and bring it to pass in your own life &gt;&gt; is what happened on the day of Pentecost. Peter took a scripture. Acts chapter 2. For these are not drunkers as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that &gt;&gt; which was spoken by the prophet Joel. Personal faith will say this scripture &gt;&gt; this that you are seeing in my life &gt;&gt; is that scripture &gt;&gt; that has been fulfilled in my life &gt;&gt; or can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, God can give you things. &gt;&gt; God can make something that you have never experienced. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I believe in a God of the impossibilities. I was giving our testimony another time. Amen. You know, we we we left Zimbabwe and we came to live in England and when we're living in England, uh I was running a business back then and then something happened and they stole my money and we were not able to buy the home that we needed to buy. &gt;&gt; And when we able to buy the home that we needed to buy, it got to a place where we lived in that place for 9 years. We had an option to buy. But one day the guy came and he says, "Hey, you failed to buy, so we're kicking you out." &gt;&gt; Me and my wife, we said, "Okay, let us go and start looking for houses without money, without price." [Applause] &gt;&gt; We said, "This time they gave us two months notice &gt;&gt; and we said let's go and start looking for a house." &gt;&gt; We started house viewing &gt;&gt; left, right, and center. And because we did not have money, it then meant we did not have a budget. So we could dream as wild as we wanted. At times money is the problem. But when you don't have it then you are not working with what you have. You are working with what God can do. So we were not limited by budget because we did not have a penny. So we said let's look for what we want and what is available. &gt;&gt; Until we found something and when we found it we went and we put an offer and they said when do you complete? We said h give us 5 months. I was hoping that something would happen on what I was working on and it never worked out. 5 months came the man got angry &gt;&gt; and he says you've wasted my time for 5 years. I'm taking this back onto the market. He was so angry. We said okay you can carry on and do it. But we still said let's hold on. &gt;&gt; But somewhere along the way God sent a certain white man &gt;&gt; who was a businessman. He came and he gave us an equivalent of $850,000 &gt;&gt; to pay deposit without money, without price. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about where we live. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the reality of faith. So I'm saying to somebody in here, you don't even need money. What you need is personal faith. &gt;&gt; You don't need something to be able to get to where you want to do. What you need is faith. Faith can do anything. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Faith can do anything tonight. Do you believe it tonight? Do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; So I can say Mark chapter 10 said they came to the Lord Jesus and they said, "What shall happen to us? We have left father and mother. We have left everything we had." What did Jesus say? He says, "There is no man that has left father or mother, houses or lands, but that shall receive in this lifetime a hundfold houses, lands, brothers, sisters, mothers. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?" &gt;&gt; Now tonight I can say this that you have heard in the scripture &gt;&gt; is that which I live in. So you can also say this that you have heard in the scripture is that that I am handling. &gt;&gt; Take me to the next quotation. The prophet of God says here sometimes God lets things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is fulfilled that he promised to do. The prophet preached the message this day this scripture is fulfilled. But brother that has got to become a personal testimony. You've got to get to a place where you yourself can say this day this quotation that the prophet promised is happened into my life. God bless you spirit and truth. God bless you. God bless you. This is that is got to come to a place where it has got to happen. You got to get to a place where you identify a scripture and you start to love that scripture until you see yourself in the scripture. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Auntie Jeremiah, &gt;&gt; she believed a scripture and she said, "Where is your Elijah?" God said, "Because you have mixed the word with your faith, I've got an Elijah. I'll stop the plane." Brother, God will do something for you. &gt;&gt; When you start to believe a scripture so much, &gt;&gt; it will end up happening in your life. &gt;&gt; It will end up materializing in your life. It's got to get to a place where things become personal. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your heart's desire is, &gt;&gt; but as I close, receive your heart's desire in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Look for a scripture that speaks to your situation. Look for a quotation that speaks to your situation and God will give it to you. &gt;&gt; God bless you as I ask brother Jack to come. Until we meet again, the Lord be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Come on, let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Thank him for speaking to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're mixing this with personal faith. &gt;&gt; My God, I believe situations are changing. &gt;&gt; Because of what you said amen to tonight, &gt;&gt; my God sent the preacher with a thought in his heart, not knowing what you were going through. And and I know that that happened uh last week with brother Banaya. He came and he was speaking to some some situations. Brother Whisper come back and speak to the same thing about jobs &gt;&gt; and different people going through things on their jobs and you know but here uh we heard the Lord say to us that God is getting ready to give somebody a promotion without you even asking for it or or even you know applying for it. &gt;&gt; If if I was working I would take that and run run with that. [Applause] I I would not let that come from God strong and just float around the atmosphere. I would make it personal. &gt;&gt; I'd be getting ready for a promotion. Get ready for the office with the window in it. Come on, somebody. You ought to get ready for your blessing. My God. My God. My God. What more does God have to say to us? This is nothing but the hand of the Lord speaking to us. And if you're looking and believing God for a house, I mean, put a steak down tonight. Put a steak down tonight. A testimony like that. &gt;&gt; And and and and brother Gwyn don't share testimonies like that all the time, &gt;&gt; but but when he share a testimony like that, you got you better listen. And and then you have to say, "Lord, if you did it for him, &gt;&gt; I know you have no respect of person." &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "Without money, &gt;&gt; and that fit my situation, &gt;&gt; but I got personal faith to believe that God would speak that to me." &gt;&gt; You ought to start looking for a house. &gt;&gt; I say you ought to start looking for a house. Don't wait for your bank account to get to a certain level. Start looking for a house. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Last week, Sister Tina testified about a new car. &gt;&gt; If your car giving you problems, &gt;&gt; you ought to jump in. Say, "Lord, praise God. I heard what you just did for Sister Tina, and I know you have no respect to persons." Amen. It's my turn. Hallelujah. Woo. &gt;&gt; And if you are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; or a refilling of the Holy Ghost and you hear about somebody else being filled or refilled, you ought to get up and say, "I'm next. I'm next. I'm next. I'm next. I'm next. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My God. Woo. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord another hand of praise, church. But I I tell you the truth, y'all. Y'all be seated if you can. I I was I was leaving here on on Sunday and um as we were just making preparation for um Eagles Rest to come in and and have this service, there was a a young man that kind of came in a little early and um he was, you know, just sitting and and um you know, so um after service, he didn't really know who the pastor was, but he certainly wanted to try to find out who the pastor was and and um he walked up to me and he says, "Are you the pastor?" Said, "Yes, sir. I sure am." He says, "Well, um I hear the Lord saying um get ready for a revival." [Music] &gt;&gt; And um I I say, "Well, okay. Thank you. I appreciate that." And and I know that, you know, um the denominational thought on what revival is versus what our understanding of what revival is, it's probably two different understandings, but nonetheless, I received what he was saying. And and and what I felt here tonight was a revival atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's what I felt here tonight. And and and what revival does, we know it just it washes the trash onto the shore. And uh and it's something that happens to you personally. &gt;&gt; And what I see God is doing some things personally to some people. We're mixing it mixing our personal faith with this and and I'm under expectation. &gt;&gt; I'm just under expectation. I I I'm I'm grateful. I'm grateful. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a season that we have entered into. Amen. And you know, we we we ought to just enjoy what God has done. I mean, since the meetings, even before the meetings, uh, cuz we had, you know, different ministers and and the different brothers that were calling me and saying they wanted to pass through, and I'm like, "Oh, my the timing, the timing, it's just not a good timing." But, but come on, brother. Come on. And um and and as uh we had the two brothers from uh Nigeria and and you all know brother JZ came and and and when he finished preaching just what a a mighty &gt;&gt; mighty presence of God that came, you know, into the building. Those chairs will never be the same. That that room will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Right. And I mean that people could feel the presence. I know after that and and you know just God just um you know uh just meeting us just one more time you know there at the school but then we come here and u and with all the brothers just kind of staying over just a couple extra days we're able to just kind of bathe in the atmosphere from the meetings. &gt;&gt; We just bathe in that atmosphere and and I'm going to tell you this. If you would come to church with a personal faith &gt;&gt; and mix it with whoever's preaching up here, &gt;&gt; we can have meeting atmosphere every time we come together. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to wait till July to have a meeting atmosphere. Every time we come together, we can have that type of atmosphere. And when there's an atmosphere like that, then this then it it puts God in a place where you you take the limits off of him. &gt;&gt; He can do whatever he want to do. and and and and I mean my God. Um quickly and let me just share this testimony and I'm I'm going to try to move on. But um as brother Gwyn was just talking, you know, this this this restoration of the apostolic uh fathers, you know, that the apostolic blessings, things of that nature. And I love the way he brought out we knew the gifts. We knew that because in in in a lot of churches, they don't even preach that anymore. &gt;&gt; We know that people don't even believe in that. They they feel like you have to keep the gifts under control. Well, is that what they did in the in the Bible? Kept the gifts under control? If if they did, we would have never read these things in scripture. &gt;&gt; No, we realize the Corinthian church got online, but we're not the Corinthian church. &gt;&gt; All right. So, so, so I I'm happy when we see that. But then how he brought out uh the visitation of angels &gt;&gt; is also an apostolic blessing that we should be looking for. And you know, uh, I was reminded of of a couple situations there and in, and uh, Brother Brandham's, uh, day. I remember there was a brother one time over in Africa and he was concerned about Brother Brandham coming over there to preach. He had heard some negative things regarding, you know, God's prophet and uh, and he was believing what the negative people were saying. So as he was praying um uh you know actually had a friend I believe praying for him about the about receiving brother Brandham and somehow the man was uh was there and a hand touched him on the shoulder and when his hand touched him on the shoulder he went running to his friend said you know I'm going to be there at the meeting you know he just had this experience and he said his hand touched me on the shoulder and and when his friend looked cuz it was on the back of his shirt and when when the friend looked The friends say, "Man, that's the print of a of a man's hand." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And come to find out, it was the print of the prophet's hand. &gt;&gt; That was on that man's shoulder. Tell him and and giving him some confidence. Don't worry, it's going to be all right. The meeting God can still do supernatural things like that. &gt;&gt; You all heard the testimony of of brother uh Brooks and how he was in his house. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know what state it was, but there was a brother in Virginia going through &gt;&gt; a a a terrible uh uh lawsuit. The man was going through a terrible lawsuit. The man saw himself losing everything. &gt;&gt; But brother Brooks, God come to him in a dream. Actually, he sent brother Brandham to him in a dream. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "You see that couple? They look a little uh uh they they they they they look like they're really going through a lot, don't they? I mean, they're really discouraged. Yeah. He says, um, when you wake up out of the dream, I want you to write this telephone number down, &gt;&gt; and I want you to call this telephone number and tell them it's going to be all right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brooks wrote the number down &gt;&gt; and by faith &gt;&gt; just dial the number. &gt;&gt; And when he dialed the number, it happened to be the the the the children. I mean, the daughter of the of the couple answered the phone and and um and brothers, you know, asked asked, he didn't even know who to ask from. He says, uh, you know, this is what happened. Brother Brandon came to me in a dream and uh I wrote the number down and then I I just dialed the number and what he told me to tell you is that it's going to be all right. &gt;&gt; So the daughter say what? The daughter start cleaning up the house and her parents were in the court right at the time that she got the telephone call and and she started cleaning the house and got a a good meal prepared. when her parents came home so despondent &gt;&gt; and she just looked at him and say, "Uh, daddy, I got your plate ready." He said, "Well, honey, today was a rough day. I need to tell No, just go ahead and eat, Dad. It's going to be it's, you know, it's going to be okay. Just just get you get your shoes off. Let me get you some Kool-Aid. Let me let me just take I mean, she was just just buttering up daddy and did not reveal what had happened. And when daddy finally got some food in his stomach, she said, "Now, I need to tell you something that happened today. I know you went through a rough day, but I want to let you know I got a telephone call from a brother from a whole another state. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Brandom came to him in a dream and he saw y'all going through what y'all was going through. He said, "Write this number down and call this number and tell them it's going to be all right." &gt;&gt; So, I'm just letting you know, daddy. I don't care what your day was like. It's going to be all right. [Applause] And you know, just just just them three words, it's going to be all right. That changed everything in the situation. &gt;&gt; The lawsuit was dropped. &gt;&gt; Look. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God God still moves. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; God still moves. He He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I mean visitation from angels &gt;&gt; that is that's part of the apostolic blessing &gt;&gt; and and and I I trust that we caught what the Holy Spirit was telling us tonight because we can have that if we would be sincere. &gt;&gt; If we would be sincere and God can do that and so much more. &gt;&gt; Testimonies be going every week. &gt;&gt; This happened, brother. This happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm under expectation for that. When when it when it's released out there like that, when that seed has been planted, I know what to expect to come forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; My I feel I feel all right, church. &gt;&gt; I feel all right. I feel all right. Feel all right. Let me let me get uh tonight's announcements. And um and and again, we we're not pressed for time to get out of here. So um you all know Wednesday nights we always leave space for people to share testimonies and uh we'll certainly give you space to do that uh tonight.

So, we'll we'll have to figure that out. And I appreciate some of my sisters for just kind of helping. We can't do like permanent things cuz it's not our space.

I went through depression like I've never been any y'all know I'm happy I'm happy I'm lucky but I went through a whole lot of depression I mean straight it was a feeling that I had never felt before in my life so I didn't know how to deal with it um I've been dealing with all kind of sicknesses I've been to the doctor more this year than I've been through in my life &gt;&gt; u everything was just shutting down um spiritually. I had lost the joy &gt;&gt; of my salvation. &gt;&gt; And I wasn't going to go to the meetings. Um I was going to go, but I wasn't going to go to every last one of them. I was just like, uhuh. And y'all know I've been hitting and missing because it was just I go, "No, I don't feel like going." It was a It's just been a real battle this past year. And um a lot of other stuff had happened that I you know when I went to the meeting I like the brother say when you come under expectation I say well Lord I'm going to go to this meeting and I need you &gt;&gt; to talk to me &gt;&gt; all right &gt;&gt; and when I went in the meeting the first minister he just started talking to me Right. &gt;&gt; And it was as he was preaching and he was saying stuff, I said, "Okay, Lord." &gt;&gt; Okay. All right then. It was such a weight &gt;&gt; lifted. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And a freedom given. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. to I mean I in this past year just you know something comes along any kind of test any kind of tri trial God always gives me a song. &gt;&gt; I didn't even have a song to sing. &gt;&gt; I mean after the meetings and and brother Diggs coming back and and preaching about you know um the restoration and what it's supposed to look like. All right. &gt;&gt; It was just a freedom, &gt;&gt; a release, &gt;&gt; a higher coming up. &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, this I I mean, this is what I've been doing. I was looking at people and what people were doing and things and stuff instead of looking at your word and getting down in your word. Hallelujah. and and the joy just came and I I mean it's just been a song in my heart and a a song on the and I say well y'all know I don't come to Wednesday night services so this I I was like Calvin called me he was like okay what we having for dinner what you going to cook for dinner I said I'm going to church tonight &gt;&gt; glory hallelujah &gt;&gt; just for the brother to come and preach about the faith and stuff I I just wanted to give the testimony that my God is a good God Yeah, &gt;&gt; he will meet you right where you at. If when you call him, he come under your expectation. I just want to give that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you, Sister Nelly. Thank you for sharing. We we we said uh before the meeting start, somebody going to be restored. Thank God for him meeting you at those meetings. Thank God. This is what restoration looked like. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anybody else want to testify tonight? Come on, Spis. Come on. Come on. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I like the other way to center. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. But &gt;&gt; no, we got more space here. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; this wasn't going to be said because it was like in the middle of the day, but Sister Nelly was saying that it was just been the worst year and we were at a barn today and there was a lady and she was saying she was like, "This has just been the worst year." And I was like I was well I didn't say it out loud but I said it in my head and I was like well I don't know what she's talking about because for me this year has been like the best lately. But um I I don't know. I was just going to say that because sister Nelly was talking about that. But what I actually came up here for was two things. Number one, I wanted to give a praise report that we like I don't know how long ago. I think it was like a month ago. We were driving and our the trailer, my dad's trailer opened and we had a garbage can in there that we didn't know how much we needed it, but we needed it. And we lost the garbage can when the door closed. Luckily, we were leaving a friend's house and he told us that, "Hey, your doors open after the garbage can fell out." So, we were like, "Well, there goes that." So, um, we've been just like, "I can't believe the trash can fell out. I can't believe the trash can fell out." And one day, like, this was like a month into it. We were like, one day we were just driving past the road and Aby's like, "I think I just saw the trash can on the side of the road. It was like a stop sign and it had two poles and it was like in between the poles. Abby was like, "I think I just saw the trash can." He's like, "Bro, stop." That was like a month ago and we were and he was like, she was like, "No." So, we were actually late to go. We were going to a Bible study and we were late. So, he was like, "Don't make me turn around and the trash can's not there." So we turned around and the trash can was there and we were like, he said after the meetings there was going to be restoration and that trash can is here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And the thing I most likely came up here to say was that another praise report that God actually protected me, it's small, but it's big to me. Um he we were riding our horses last Saturday and my horse got loose because I don't know how he got loose. He I think he was going to go eat some grass but I didn't think he was going to go eat some grass. So, I went like running after him and I was on the side of him and he's running like this and I guess he thought we were playing or something and he kicked me right here and it could have been way worse than it was and it just took my breath, but no side effects. There was no redness, no bruise, nothing. It did hurt for a little bit, but I was praying to God. I was like, "God, you can res you can heal me because if if if that happened and it wasn't that bad, then I think you can heal me from a little bit of pain." So that's what I wanted to say that he healed me from the horse and he also restored our garbage can. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Won't he do it? Thank you, Sister Linda. Certainly appreciate, you know, you sharing and certainly a a kick from a horse. &gt;&gt; Uh, that could be something serious. So, thank God for his divine protection. Um, anybody else? Okay, come on up, brother Joe. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So, um, the this is it. It like Lynn said, it might be small, but it's something big to me. So, a so so a new video game console came out and it it was really expensive and stuff. And we went to the store and the way it was going down was like really fast because it was like it just came out. They didn't make enough basically. So, we went to the store. They said they didn't have it, but the lady told us, she said, "Go on July 1st, get there early in the morning, and they'll have about 32 in stock." So, we go there. I was the first one to be there. I got one, and the we we got it, but we had to pay for like a bunch of like uh more stuff as well, like member the not membership, sorry. Um the year plans and stuff like that. Um screen protectors and stuff. But I just want to um thank the Lord for allowing my parents to get me a $750 game console. So yeah, I say I just want to thank the Lord for that. All right, Joe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that that that was his desire. So praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Any anybody else want to want to share? Okay. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's concerned about everything. &gt;&gt; Everything. Even garbage cans. &gt;&gt; God bless your church. Um, I want to thank the Lord for the meetings because I didn't think that God care about me, but he really does. &gt;&gt; Um, I think the service that we had when brother Jesus came in that morning when I woke up, I had a terrible dream and then I was telling my husband how bad it was and then he said, "Okay, let's go to church and then let's pray about that." But I was so tired from the Saturday and then I was like when I first got up I forgot about the gym and then I said, "Okay, I'm not going to go to church today." And then out of nowhere, I put my clothes on and then I find myself in church. And that day, if I didn't go to church, I that was that was it for me. That could be it for me. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit come down and then I it was a blessing. And then he took that that burden away from me. And then I thank God for that. And also something terrible happened again before the meeting. And then he was I was down. I'm like this is it for me. I am not going to the meeting. And I said that but I know like I couldn't miss that. And then one more time God came into the scene and then he showed mercy to me personally. I didn't miss one bit. No crumbs for me. If somebody left scrums, it was not me. I got every last bit of everything. I want to thank God for that. Yeah. I got I told brother Jack and Sister Erica, I'm going to bring my suitcase. I brought that thing and then I got my blessing. I want to thank God for that because it was so discouraging the the Sunday before and then that um it was on on Tuesday. I didn't even work because it was so bad. I was depressed. I'm like, what what where am I? What am I doing? Because I thought everything was going well, but now I find myself in this situation. Let me just give up. But something inside me said, you girl, you know you got to be at the meeting. That's where you need to be. And then God showed mercy and then I'm going to leave everything behind me. I I really thank God for that. And being a part of spirit and truth tabernacle, that's also my blessing. And I want to thank you for all of that. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sister Melissa. Amen. We certainly appreciate that. Anybody else want to share? Come on, sis. Yeah. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So during the week of testing for school, I was going back and forth to Palm Bay to do my testing and it was the chemistry test on a Monday and I went to that and then on Wednesday I was like, "Dad, do I have another day of testing?" I was like, he was like, "No, I don't know." So, I go check my mom's email and it said I had testing that day, but I was, it was at 11 and it was about 12 when I looked at it. And I could have possibly been retained or stayed in that grade and could be kicked out of the school I was going to. And my dad was like, "Don't cry. Like, it's going to be okay." And I'm like, "Dad, I'm going to fail. I can't I'm not going to make it." And he was just like, "It's okay." So, we called my guidance counselor. She's not answering. Um, we called the school. They're like, "We can't do nothing for you." And then there's this one lady. My teacher was like, "You have to call her words pass." So, I called her and um I have to do law studies this year and she was like if you if like the way you have to get in is like you have to go to a school in your zone. So, we have to change our address because it was still the address in Palm Bay. So, we had to change it to our current address. And they found a school and they had to open dates for me to take my algebra and my history test. And I'm going to the ninth grade. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't worry. It's going to be all right. &gt;&gt; Won't he do it? God is good. Amen. God bless you, Sister Shalom. Anybody else? All right. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Um, I just want to share this testimony and tell you how blessed we are to have brother Jack as our pastor. Um when I first started my job, he came in and prayed over my class and it eventually um one or two more people, you know, it has come to the point now where he's walking from one side of campus all the way to the other side, all the way out that door around in other buildings because I sent out the the message, "Brother Jack is coming." They they call him Pastor Jack. And so I I sent out the message, "Pastor Jack is coming today." And the the the the message is coming back. Make sure you come to my room. Make sure he comes to my room. Make sure he come to my room. And then it was one one teacher said, "Make sure he hits this room, this room, this room, this room, this room." He don't have to go in. Just have him to stand at the door and pray over the door. And you all just it's something just to see how much the people respect his prayers, want him to pray and stand there so reverently while he prays where God has opened that door for him and he is literally praying throughout the whole school. And I just thank God that he has led such a life and people have so much trust in him to pray over our school and I just thank God for that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Certainly thank God. I I got two more hands. Come on. Uh mama, you you first. Amen. Thank God. Thank God. Bless your saints. I've been holding off sharing this testimony and I trust that it's okay. But uh I'm so thankful to the Lord for this message. I thank God for showing me that I had a gift. And this gift of being able to write songs, it was it came through the message. I didn't I had little diddly tunes I would write before then. God really just increased my walk in him that I was able to write songs and even to the point of also recording songs. Well, I I had a lot of them that were packed away and I I got discouraged many times because I couldn't see what was going to become of those songs that I had packed away. Many of them I had forgotten. And I had approached brother Jackson some years ago about recording some of them, but he didn't seem to be interested. He just didn't seem to be ready to do that. And uh just over a course of time, the Lord began to change his heart. And within the last six months, a little beyond that, we got serious about doing something with those songs. I thank the Lord for the end product. Finally, [Music] [Applause] I thank him that we waited until such a time as this. And I feel like this is the best way that those s songs could have come forth. And it's just been such a blessing to me. Every time I listen to the different ones, I think about the humble musings of my heart and see what they have progressed to become. I'm just blessed all over again. I I thank the Lord for how he did this. And I sure hope you've listened to them. Listen to some of those songs. And I'm not trying to sell it. God God knows I'm not try it. It's It's not something that needs to be sold. either you have a desire for them or you don't. But I I just thank God for what he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh he took those simple writings in my heart and has produced something so great that's going to just bless the world around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Certainly thank God uh for that. A lot of those songs, mama gave them to me over 20 to anywhere between 20 20 to 25 year old songs that just got new life in this season. So, it it's something about waiting on the Lord. Uh when you wait, he he has this perfect timing for for everything. So, we thank God. I saw my wife's hand up. We'll have her. So, good to have her in service tonight. Amen. Thank God. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you um to all who prayed for me. I'm doing much better. Thank you. Um just um two things I wanted to mention. The first was um some not everybody but um some people know that I've been having problems with my knee um lately, the past couple months. And um and I just really was putting it off going to the doctor because I was just like um it'll get better. And I um I really didn't want somebody to tell me I would have to have surgery or something like that because I knew it was whatever it was. I knew it was serious, but I was just like, nah, you know, I'm just going to trust and believe God that that it'll get better. And um finally, I mean um I've been really really I mean it's it's been excruciating. I have a very very high pain tolerance and it was excruciating. I was taking 800 mgram ibuprofen every night just to go to sleep. Um because it it ju it hurt that bad and unfortunately I have a very high metabolism when it comes to medication. So it would literally wear off in 3 hours 800 millig. So, I would just hope to be really really good good in sleep um so that I could just get through the night, you know. But um finally, anyway, I went to the doctor. I went to the doctor today and um really I just I found them out of the kind of out of the blue. I um I had been referred to someone and I called them and we went back and forth and apparently they didn't get my referral. So, it was just like, okay, well, I don't want to go to them anyway cuz it was like down in Deerfield or Delray or whatever. So, I found this doctor and he had an appointment today. I called yesterday, he had an appointment today. Went in and I was just he just made me feel so very comfortable and you know, I was just worried about what he was going to say and um but he made me really comfortable and never once said anything about surgery. Not one time. Didn't even didn't even say you're a candidate for it, but we could try other things. Nothing. He said nothing. And he was just like, "A series of injections and I need you to do some exercises, build up your your quad muscles, do this, do that, and take some, you know, um supplements and you'll be good." And I was just like, "Thank you, Jesus." So to um to to some that might be small, but I have absolutely never had any type of surgery. I have never been under anesthesia, and that is something I do not want to do. So I thank God for that. Um, number two, I just kind of wanted to piggyback off what Sister Tina was saying and actually what uh, Brother um, Whisper was saying tonight. Um, how we really don't know what we have. We really don't know what we have. Um, today, you know, and how it's so common to us. Um, today I was telling brother Jack that um I saw someone on social media and um it it's a young man and apparently he uh he's dancing from being a woman into a man. And um I I think um the video I saw I believe it was today and he was saying that this is day 56 of him being a Christian. And this young man, I I I've I've I've seen him through the week and um really one of his videos, I was sitting there watching it and I'm looking at it and he's just going to churches. He's just he doesn't know anything about anything. He doesn't know anything about God. He doesn't know anything. All he does is just read his Bible and whatever he sees in his Bible, he believes. And um and he so so he's just kind of going around in different churches trying to find, you know, some place where he feels comfortable, someplace where he feel that the Lord is leading him. And I told him, I said, I was watching one of his videos where he was talking about going to church and how he feels and all this stuff like that. And it literally brought me to tears because I was I was sitting there like the wonder that is in his eyes, you know, knowing where he came from and where he is now. And although he's on a journey, he's on, you know, he doesn't know what where he's going or what he's going to do, just the wonder that was in his eyes about just God doing simple things for him. Just just simple things. He was saying one time he went to a Bible study. Well, I I think that was today or yesterday. He went to a Bible study and he was sitting in the Bible study and he felt like the PE he didn't feel welcomed. He he really didn't feel welcomed. And um and he and it was one specific lady that that just kind of kept eyeballing him and his he has a girlfriend and his girlfriend and it just kind of kept eyeballing him. And so he started feeling anxious. He got up. He walked out. He went to the bathroom. He prayed and and he prayed for the lady and he said he said, "Lord, I don't know basically what's going on with her. Um you know, only you know, but if there if it if she has an evil spirit, Lord, I ask that you take it away from her and let her be joyful. And if but if it is an evil spirit and you don't want it to be around me, I ask that you just have her get up and leave, you know, whatever. And he was like, he said more than that, but he was earnestly praying for this lady. And he came back from the bathroom, sat down in his seat. He said as soon as he sat down in his seat, she got up and walked out. And he told his girlfriend that later on. And both of them was it was it was like totally shocking to them that God would actually answer a prayer just that quick. And and and I say that to piggyback off of what brother Whisper was saying because it has become so common to us. You know, we pray for things and I mean even even small things. I mean I'm driving through the parking lot. I'm like, "Lord, I need a closed park space cuz I'm lazy, you know, and and I find one, you know, and and I do say I say, "Thank you, Lord," you know, and and and go on about my business. But I mean, these are things that should be happening. They should be happening every day. But as they happen, we should definitely every time, I don't care what it is, every time it happens, we should be at wonder just like this young man is. He I mean, doesn't know anything. and it's everything to him is beautiful. And I I believe that we all had a time and a place where we all felt that way about Christ. And and it's just it it really is refreshing to hear what what Brother Whisper said tonight because it's true. We've we've all been at that place where it's common to us. It we really have. And just like I said, just to see this young man and where he is. It's like, Lord, place that wonder back in me, you know, place it back in me to actually see the world in a totally different light to be able to have somebody you feel like is judging you or eyeballing you or whatever and you genuinely praying for them and not Lord, you know, that's a demon and I bind that. No, you know, literally praying for them and I don't know what the problem is, but Lord, I just ask you to touch them, you know, place that back in us. And I I I I truly believe that if we got back to that place, that's where we can begin to see things take place. We can begin to see the apo apostolic blessings take place in our midst. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for for that, brother Solomon. Uh and I think he'll be the last one tonight. Brother Solomon. All right. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I was uh sitting there thinking about giving a testimony about how we we actually moved here. And I was like, "No, I I'm coming up there every Wednesday about testifying and I I don't want to, you know, you know, I become common, I suppose." But my uh my wife, she put on the phone, why don't you give the testimony of how we moved here? So, I thought, yeah, it it's probably the right time. But I wanted to give another testimony before that. Um, sometimes we don't count our blessings like we should. Brother Whisper, he pulled up a a scripture that I was holding on to while we was moving. Whosoever forsakes father, mother, sister, brother houses, lands, I'll give him fathers, mother, sister, brother houses, and land. And I was holding on to that. And just earlier today, I was listening to uh well, I've been listening to the CD all day. My blessings are too many to number. And as I was listening to that that song, I I got to thinking back where the Lord found me. And when the Lord found me, I was up on stage with Five Guys singing. And we had just finished recording two singles. And I sat back and I was like, "My Lord." During the meetings, I was on the platform of five gods singing. &gt;&gt; And I actually sung on Brother Jack CD. I said, "Where the Lord found me, he has restored me back to that place." &gt;&gt; And I thought, "My blessings are far too many to number." &gt;&gt; What I was doing for Satan, he turned around. &gt;&gt; And now I'm doing it for the Lord. And &gt;&gt; I wanted to thank him for for showing me that little thing that &gt;&gt; restoration comes in so many different forms. And sometimes we're not looking for it, but it's there. But um I want to say uh last April or May um it was on my heart to actually just once our uh lease was up in Palm Bay to move in September. But um we kept delaying and one of the reason we kept delaying it was like uh I guess the inflation had hit our clients. Normally, you know, we have them on payment plans and it seemed like everybody just stopped. It's like, well, hey, where the money where the money going? So, I'm out here hustling, trying to get a job here, get a job there, back up somebody here, back up somebody there, and just working, working, working. And all these people just stopped paying. So, September came and went. October, November, December, me and my wife, we decided we was going to leave. But it was after we was listening to some meetings over in Dubai and there was a young man that gave his testimony that he shared tonight. And from Brother Whisper's testimony, we said, "Okay, we're going to move." So, we were supposed to move January 25th, and that was on a Wednesday. I believe it was the 25th. That Tuesday, we had a we had a home lined up to go to. That Tuesday, we got an email. We decided to go a different direction. So we had already had everything packed and in a storage here and we were leaving in the morning. That night we had brother's prayer. Brothers prayed and everything. So we came and we were in a hotel for a while. We were uh Airbnb for a while. Brother Quinton's for a little bit and then it's like these people still not paying. Finally we find find a a home. Uh and that this by this time it's now uh what was March? Yeah, it was in March. Two months had two months had gone by and we still just living in you know we just watching all the money that we're getting just going. So it was going to cost quite a bit um for us to get into the place where we are. And right when we're about to get in there, everybody decide to pay. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But brother Whisper said there had to be a Cyrus somewhere. So there was a a Cyrus that helped us. And I was just I wanted to thank the Lord for how he he's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things get so dark and you're just looking, Lord, how is this going to take place? And he makes a way. And when we were laying in the bed um one night, one morning, my wife looked over at me and she said, "We were crazy." And I looked at her, I said, "Yeah, we were crazy. What we just been through was simply crazy, but God made a way." And I want to thank the Lord that we are here with you tonight. Something we couldn't do before. So God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I certainly thank God for for making a way and and um it it means it means a lot just to hear what God is doing in the midst of his people. uh you never know who need to hear the testimony that you shared uh how it encourages them just to mix their faith and know that God can do the same for them. So, thank y'all so much. We uh we just appreciate the Lord. It it's something about having this freedom that we ain't had in a long time. uh and just being able to enjoy the presence of the Lord. And and and like I say, Sunday is our only little challenge, but um God going to work all that out. God going to work all that out. Praise God. Saints, we we thank God for you. Um let's have a word of prayer and uh we'll have the brothers come uh to dismiss us on tonight. We'll be back on Sunday morning 8:30 for prayer. Father, we thank you uh for all that you've done here tonight. Thank you for your word that went forth to strengthen and encourage our hearts. Uh thank you for your servant Lord that just yielded himself to minister once more uh to to this body, we trust Lord that as he prepares to return home that you would bless him in his journey, his church there waiting for him. I pray God that you bless the church and God may you uh just continue to get glory and honor out of all uh that they do. We also pray father that you would um uh bless the saints as they leave this place tonight but not your presence. May we go meditating and thinking on the things that you have spoken to us mixing our faith uh with it and living uh lives of expectation Lord just believing that you'll meet us in in supernatural ways. uh we we believe, oh God, that everything that was promised in in the book of Acts, Lord, is something that we are supposed to be striving for. So wherever we're falling short, God, we pray that you'd help us to align ourselves with the word that we might see the manifestation of all that you have spoken. Uh we trust, oh God, that uh you would just continue to get glory out of all that we're doing. Thank you for this little spirit of revival that you're giving to the church and restoration that's happening on on a daily basis right before our very eyes. Don't let it become common to us, but let us, Lord, always get the thrill uh from seeing what you're doing. Thank you, Father. You're doing mighty things right here in our midst. And uh Lord, we uh we have enough to to praise you for. So pray, Lord, that you would keep us until we're able to come back together again. It's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Uh the brothers will come at this time uh to dismiss us. God bless you.
