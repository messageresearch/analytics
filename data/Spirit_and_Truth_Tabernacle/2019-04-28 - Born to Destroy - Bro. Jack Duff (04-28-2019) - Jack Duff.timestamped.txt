[1:12:15] we turn our attention now to the word
[1:12:17] God set capital screen here and God if
[1:12:20] there's one that needs to Holy Ghost
[1:12:22] fell over the Holy Ghost God whatever
[1:12:24] the need is we read into a meter
[1:12:25] somebody's sick may bring healing in the
[1:12:28] place
[1:12:29] today we invite to take complete control
[1:12:31] over this portion of the service God be
[1:12:34] glorified be exalted be magnified right
[1:12:37] here and right now
[1:12:40] we love you Jesus we praise you Jesus
[1:12:45] Jesus bless our reading of the word and
[1:12:50] bless our hearing of the words in Jesus
[1:12:53] name we ask you no mind standing to your
[1:13:05] feet with me and then we will read a
[1:13:08] portion of the scripture I want to read
[1:13:11] from first John chapter 3 on today a man
[1:13:16] 1st John chapter 3 glory to God a man
[1:13:21] first John chapter 3 start here verse 1
[1:13:29] behold what manner of love the father
[1:13:32] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:13:34] called the sons of God but therefore the
[1:13:38] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:13:40] not beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:13:44] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:13:48] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:13:50] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:13:52] him as he is and every man that has this
[1:13:57] hope in him purifies himself even as he
[1:14:01] is pure whosoever committeth sin
[1:14:04] transgresseth transgresseth also the law
[1:14:08] for sin is the transgression of the law
[1:14:11] and you know that he was manifested to
[1:14:14] take away our sins and in him in him so
[1:14:20] you got to be in him in him is no sin
[1:14:23] right right
[1:14:25] whosoever abideth in him sinneth not who
[1:14:29] service in it hath not seen him neither
[1:14:32] known him little children let no man
[1:14:37] deceive you he that doeth righteousness
[1:14:40] is righteous even as he is righteous he
[1:14:46] that committeth sin is of the devil for
[1:14:50] the devil sinneth from
[1:14:53] the beginning for this purpose the Son
[1:14:55] of God was manifested that he might
[1:14:58] destroy the works of the devil
[1:15:02] a man the Lord had a blessing to the
[1:15:05] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:15:21] certainly also appreciate can't said
[1:15:26] enough but the services on last week I
[1:15:28] felt were very very precious a man
[1:15:31] something special here for the church
[1:15:33] for services that we did and seemed like
[1:15:37] the devil didn't like it what he went on
[1:15:43] a rampage after the after the meekness
[1:15:46] was over but by the grace of God we're
[1:15:51] all still standing right here in the
[1:15:55] same place and all I can say is was a
[1:16:11] loser
[1:16:12] man you are a winner by still being here
[1:16:17] you win huh
[1:16:18] already God we thank God for for being
[1:16:22] on the winning side and thank God for
[1:16:23] victory
[1:16:25] in our in our lives I wanted to just
[1:16:28] take for a subject today a man born to
[1:16:31] destroy a man born to destroy let's just
[1:16:38] look at a couple of things here a man
[1:16:43] see here just kind of think about where
[1:16:47] we want to jump in a man you know we
[1:16:50] were where we're gonna look at this from
[1:16:53] a couple angles we just read here in the
[1:16:55] scripture where it says he that
[1:16:59] committeth sin is of the devil but the
[1:17:02] devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:17:04] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:17:05] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:17:10] works of the devil so here we see Jesus
[1:17:14] was was brought a man on the scene in
[1:17:18] order to destroy the works of the devil
[1:17:21] and and if I could just give you a brief
[1:17:24] definition it's to ruin a man anything
[1:17:28] that that was trying to do
[1:17:30] in your life Jesus not just
[1:17:33] counter-attacks the enemy
[1:17:35] Jesus destroys God you know I'm one that
[1:17:42] I want to see the devil destroyed hey
[1:17:44] man I want to see him wiped out one day
[1:17:47] I'm gonna fight my final battle hey man
[1:17:50] ain't gonna be no mo battling with the
[1:17:53] devil right it is finally over and you
[1:17:57] know and you know and and and and and
[1:17:59] just kind of thinking about battles and
[1:18:01] things of that nature
[1:18:02] I was recently listening to a quote
[1:18:05] where the Prophet was talking about how
[1:18:06] you know we kind of go from trial to
[1:18:08] trial and things like that and you know
[1:18:10] he was uh he was talking about this uh
[1:18:12] you know because often times we go
[1:18:14] through trials and we ready to quit we
[1:18:15] ready to give up we you know we don't
[1:18:18] understand what our purpose is amen in
[1:18:21] the midst of that trial but you know he
[1:18:23] was saying you know there was a soldier
[1:18:26] one time a leader of the of the army and
[1:18:28] he and he he he had some soldiers and
[1:18:32] you know he was the soldiers were coming
[1:18:34] man these guys was getting wiped out you
[1:18:37] know they'd show up at one place they
[1:18:39] get wiped out and he was sending word
[1:18:41] back so Simmons among soldiers and so
[1:18:43] the next group would come and they would
[1:18:45] get wiped out and and but he still lived
[1:18:47] him and he's still given commands sent
[1:18:49] me some old soldiers and so you know
[1:18:52] finally the third group come and say hey
[1:18:53] look you keep asking for soldiers you
[1:18:55] lose and all these men you know
[1:18:57] something something wrong you know here
[1:18:59] he say he say look I might uh lost some
[1:19:02] battles but I ain't lost the war say the
[1:19:06] war still going on hey man so send me
[1:19:09] some months old just send me some
[1:19:12] soldiers and then the soldiers coming
[1:19:14] because they don't heard about all these
[1:19:15] men dying with him as a man leading a
[1:19:19] man they heard they heard a little noise
[1:19:22] in the camp they thought maybe a bullet
[1:19:24] went flying these guys went ducking and
[1:19:26] they went hide and running and all kind
[1:19:28] of stuff in the man say y'all y'all go
[1:19:31] back
[1:19:32] and tell them to see me some old
[1:19:34] soldiers say well you know everybody -
[1:19:36] they say look I won't mean that's not
[1:19:38] afraid to die for the cause hallelujah I
[1:19:41] will free I mean that's not afraid to
[1:19:44] face the enemy if freedom is worth
[1:19:48] fighting for that you might as well
[1:19:49] start fighting if your freedom is worth
[1:19:54] fighting for
[1:19:55] you wanna start fight your freedom from
[1:19:58] sickness your freedom from man say don't
[1:20:19] send these guys send me men that's
[1:20:22] really that really want to fight for
[1:20:23] something and glory to God they ended up
[1:20:26] winning the war glory to God they lost
[1:20:29] some battles but they won the war and I
[1:20:32] want to I want to taste so you know
[1:20:34] we've got to look at this from a couple
[1:20:35] different angles because Jesus was
[1:20:38] manifested to destroy that means to ruin
[1:20:41] or demolish ruin or demolish that was
[1:20:45] his whole purpose amen to ruin and
[1:20:48] demolish see glory God but I want to
[1:20:51] tell you something as well Satan is
[1:20:53] trying to ruin or demolish you a man so
[1:21:01] I would rather be on the Lord's side he
[1:21:03] ain't never lost one battle I have
[1:21:07] serious doubts that this gonna be his
[1:21:10] first battle he ever lost in a he's
[1:21:12] all-time undisputed undefeated champion
[1:21:18] of love I doubt he's got to lose this
[1:21:21] one glory to God so I'm gonna stand on
[1:21:23] the Lord's side the Bible says in John
[1:21:25] 10:10 the thief cometh not but for to
[1:21:27] steal and to kill and to destroy
[1:21:31] but Jesus said I am come that they might
[1:21:34] have
[1:21:34] and that they might have it more
[1:21:36] abundantly more ready God so the devil
[1:21:40] is trying to steal kill and destroy amen
[1:21:42] but Jesus is giving you life and he's
[1:21:44] giving it to you more abundantly now
[1:21:46] let's read a little something out of the
[1:21:48] infallible proof of the resurrection
[1:21:49] this sermon that the Prophet gives us it
[1:21:54] says this it says and now when God
[1:21:57] promised a royal seat that would come
[1:22:01] forth as a savior it's been the work of
[1:22:05] our or God's enemy to the devil to try
[1:22:09] to destroy that seat all the way down
[1:22:12] it's been the work a man of God's enemy
[1:22:15] or our enemy the devil to try to destroy
[1:22:18] that seat all the way down the first
[1:22:23] thing when the righteous son was born
[1:22:25] Abel and the unrighteous was born Cain
[1:22:28] first he slew Abel thinking he was
[1:22:32] getting that right to see hallelujah for
[1:22:36] he was standing there when God
[1:22:37] pronounced everlasting earthly judgments
[1:22:40] upon the people and upon the Serpent and
[1:22:42] upon the ground and he promised through
[1:22:44] the woman would come a seed and this
[1:22:46] seed would bruise the Serpent's head and
[1:22:49] the serpent brought and the serpent
[1:22:51] thought at that seed all down through
[1:22:54] the eight and he's still fighting it
[1:22:58] hallelujah amen
[1:23:00] sometimes you know glory to God if we
[1:23:04] can just put it like this it's not you
[1:23:06] that The Devil's coming after but it's
[1:23:08] what you possess somebody breaking into
[1:23:14] your house that breaking into your car
[1:23:15] it's about what you possess not
[1:23:18] necessarily you a matter what you
[1:23:20] possess is
[1:23:21] seed of God come from God are you going
[1:23:25] back to God and when the devil trying to
[1:23:27] do is destroy that see how are you yeah
[1:23:30] alright let's go on a little further he
[1:23:32] says he's still fighting it
[1:23:34] then when he slew Abel he thought he got
[1:23:36] it because he destroyed the only
[1:23:38] righteous part of the sea the only
[1:23:41] righteous part of the sea now he never
[1:23:43] did go after Cain right he went out for
[1:23:46] a glory to God and it shows that Cain
[1:23:49] was not Adam son this nature that was
[1:23:52] inside Cain to even be used in this
[1:23:54] manner he was not Adam son right Adam
[1:23:57] was not a murderer no sir how are you by
[1:23:59] Satan is a murderer he was of the wicked
[1:24:06] one the Bible declares day man
[1:24:08] hallelujah
[1:24:09] he said now now then we need slew and we
[1:24:11] thought he got it but because he
[1:24:12] destroyed the only righteous part of the
[1:24:15] sea then God raised up Seth to take his
[1:24:19] place
[1:24:19] a beautiful type of death of the death
[1:24:21] of Christ and the resurrection of Christ
[1:24:23] and then he thought he had him when he
[1:24:25] got the prophets he thought he had him
[1:24:28] when he got John but when he finally
[1:24:31] slew the righteous seed and he was
[1:24:33] buried on the third day God raised him
[1:24:37] up from the dead the Lord Jesus
[1:24:39] hallelujah he thought he had him and
[1:24:42] will go through this you know you can
[1:24:44] pull it down there we'll go through this
[1:24:46] in an again a little bit but you know
[1:24:48] he's constantly coming after that seed
[1:24:50] trying to destroy trying to destroy it
[1:24:52] trying to destroy you know he thought he
[1:24:54] had Christ but you know and like I say
[1:24:56] everything I mean sicknesses of the
[1:24:58] devil I've seen it I mean sickness is an
[1:25:01] attribute of sin glory to God
[1:25:03] so whatever you might be battling if the
[1:25:05] doctors say there's this is incurable
[1:25:06] Jesus can take care of that yes Jesus
[1:25:09] wants to destroy a demolished that down
[1:25:12] hallelujah the same devil is trying to
[1:25:14] destroy you Jesus supposed to take him
[1:25:16] out you got to give him a chance
[1:25:18] amen the one thing that the devil had no
[1:25:21] matter what he used the one thing he had
[1:25:23] against all men is its death once he got
[1:25:25] them in the grave he knew it was over
[1:25:27] and
[1:25:28] me thought you said it's over that but
[1:25:30] God would raise up another man to kind
[1:25:32] of carry it all and then they'd be
[1:25:34] getting a launch an attack against the
[1:25:35] enemy hallelujah
[1:25:37] but when Jesus came along even death
[1:25:39] itself lost his sting a man even the
[1:25:42] grave itself lost its victory the Bible
[1:25:44] said in first Corinthians 15 26 the last
[1:25:47] enemy that shall be destroyed is death a
[1:25:52] man thank God for what Jesus did at
[1:25:54] Calvary because death itself has been
[1:25:57] destroyed hallelujah glory to God death
[1:26:01] itself has been ruined
[1:26:04] how can you say that brother death I
[1:26:06] mean even the Prophet gives us a
[1:26:09] different she won't death he said that
[1:26:13] becomes a buggy
[1:26:17] what a slave driver to drive me into the
[1:26:23] presence of God yes so I see myself a
[1:26:28] man in the chariot part of this buggy
[1:26:30] and telling them pull me into the press
[1:26:33] huh Paul me antenna threatens take
[1:26:36] control
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:40] somebody amen
[1:26:42] we're not afraid of death that is afraid
[1:26:45] of us hey man death has been ruined when
[1:26:55] we look at it a man from the eyes of
[1:26:57] hope we got that hope through Christ's
[1:26:59] glory of God and I look at this he says
[1:27:01] this in the in a sermon God I mean the
[1:27:03] spoken word its original seed he says
[1:27:05] this God is taking the elect out of out
[1:27:09] of that Pentecostal church that hybrid
[1:27:12] pulling it out and finishing up the word
[1:27:14] and it's got to be so close until the
[1:27:19] word itself did I I'm starting at
[1:27:24] paragraph 326 on that I might I might a
[1:27:27] give you the wrong paragraph 326 God is
[1:27:32] taking a length out of that Pentecostal
[1:27:35] church that hybrid pulling it out and
[1:27:37] finishing up the word and it's got to be
[1:27:40] so close until the word itself will
[1:27:43] blend with this word hallelujah
[1:27:45] and it goes on said there comes the
[1:27:48] headstone crying grace grace Amazing
[1:27:51] Grace the headstone here you are like
[1:27:54] this see on there see how it is way
[1:27:57] white down here and it keeps getting
[1:28:01] closer closer closer to ministry after

[1:28:14] gifts now God is taken from their
[1:28:17] holding out a bunch to make a ministry
[1:28:21] just exactly like that word there
[1:28:24] because it's got to fit with the words
[1:28:26] there's the bride take her out
[1:28:28] he goes on setting out Christ was
[1:28:31] manifested glory to destroy the works of
[1:28:35] the devil I say a man tonight
[1:28:38] you believe that yeah said now I can't
[1:28:40] explain all this I'm just going to go
[1:28:43] through it just quickly now hit the hard
[1:28:46] place
[1:28:46] so you won't stay too long glory to God
[1:28:49] I was reminded a man of the scripture
[1:28:53] glory to God where he says Jesus say the
[1:28:56] spirit Lord is upon me and he has
[1:28:58] anointed me a man to recover the side of
[1:29:02] the blind a man - you know I can't think
[1:29:05] of it alright now to find up the
[1:29:09] brokenhearted it's there in Luke 4 find
[1:29:11] out the brook I set at liberty those
[1:29:14] that are in bondage those that about
[1:29:16] Jesus came to destroy he does not want
[1:29:20] you in bondage gonna break I mean God
[1:29:23] don't get no glory
[1:29:25] come on Odyssey you in bondage praise
[1:29:28] God remember how the Prophet went to the
[1:29:31] Cincinnati Zoo and they say he wished
[1:29:33] she can let all the Eagles go free
[1:29:35] because he hated sin that eagle
[1:29:37] constantly trying to get above a Mantha
[1:29:40] the neck or the case that they had in me
[1:29:43] always trying to get a bumper winning
[1:29:45] when he get enough amen I'll strip
[1:29:47] 'mentally to try to fly above that thing
[1:29:49] he went in the top over to come right
[1:29:51] back down many times in life we try to
[1:29:54] get up out of a situation we're trying
[1:29:56] to get up out of something that the
[1:29:57] devil galaxy if we know content say he
[1:30:04] say just like that he was constantly
[1:30:06] going up or down we have the same
[1:30:08] struggles and I like with counseling
[1:30:09] going up and comes to going down but
[1:30:12] it's time to break free from that oh all
[1:30:15] he say if I can just take the
[1:30:16] from exactly when he was bored to the
[1:30:46] hospital when you're doing the work he
[1:31:32] goes on he says this he says Christ was
[1:31:35] manifested as straw that works to the
[1:31:36] devil you believe that now I can't
[1:31:38] explain all this I'm just gonna go
[1:31:41] through it just quickly now hit the high
[1:31:43] places so you won't stay too long
[1:31:45] Christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:31:47] works of the devil is that right you all
[1:31:49] believe that that's why what was he
[1:31:52] God's Word which destroys the works of
[1:31:54] the hybrid the devil is that right he
[1:31:57] was done he was not born to do that he
[1:32:00] was born to be net to destroy the works
[1:32:02] of the devil now listen now his body is
[1:32:06] to do the same yes sir his body which is
[1:32:13] you is to do the same
[1:32:16] if Christ was born to destroy guess what
[1:32:19] you were born for born to destroy I
[1:32:25] didn't say he was born to play PT pact
[1:32:27] with the devil huh
[1:32:30] I didn't say you were born to make the
[1:32:32] dirt devil one of your buddies
[1:32:34] what are your homies now you were born
[1:32:37] to destroy that fella and let me give
[1:32:39] you some piece of advice you better
[1:32:41] destroy any glory his body is to do the
[1:32:53] same because the body is head and body
[1:32:57] is together that's right if Christ is
[1:32:59] the head was the word his body has to be
[1:33:02] the same thing as the Hat was that's
[1:33:04] right
[1:33:05] a church of the word born of the word
[1:33:08] virgin born from the word
[1:33:10] nondenominational now a virgin born from
[1:33:13] the word the way the body operates is by
[1:33:17] the hand that's right say my body can't
[1:33:20] move until my head tells it to move
[1:33:22] well what if my head is flesh in my body
[1:33:26] is concrete haha can't move
[1:33:28] hair can say move move move move but
[1:33:31] there there's nothing to send a message
[1:33:34] to hallelujah and the reason that
[1:33:37] someone else is bound because there's
[1:33:39] been nothing to send the message to oh
[1:33:41] hey man we got our heart of concrete the
[1:33:44] Bible say you have to take a way out
[1:33:47] throw many hearts and give us a heart of
[1:33:49] flesh glory to God if we want to move
[1:33:52] with the head amen hallelujah we gotta
[1:33:55] have something a singing station I
[1:33:57] believe brother Troy was chosen about
[1:33:59] that he said those three things have to
[1:34:01] line up when you know say when a ship is
[1:34:03] moving it's not the man that's up in the
[1:34:06] top of the tower there that's
[1:34:07] controlling how to ship moves that man
[1:34:09] is sending a signal to a man that's all
[1:34:12] the way down in the Lord level the boat
[1:34:15] but the man that's in the lower level
[1:34:17] cannot hear the man that's up at the top
[1:34:19] they have to use a man in the middle man
[1:34:23] in the middle is what says the message
[1:34:25] back and forth if the message is wrong

[1:34:33] we got the man at the top the man in the
[1:34:36] middle and the man at the bottom gotta
[1:34:38] be all aligned up together with that
[1:34:47] what God's Word say hallelujah get your
[1:34:50] spirit aligned with his spirit did
[1:34:52] something happen

[1:35:06] uh-huh
[1:35:08] I love it brother now tell you I like to
[1:35:10] preach on some of this for a while the
[1:35:13] way the body operates is by the hip and
[1:35:15] the head is the word that's right the
[1:35:17] head is the word now let me just kind of
[1:35:20] go on a little further here you know the
[1:35:23] destroy like I told you a man is to ruin
[1:35:26] or to demolish and we were looking at
[1:35:30] how Satan hurt in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:33] with God gave out the punishments a man
[1:35:36] after the sin to place and and if you're
[1:35:39] not aware of what took place in the
[1:35:41] garden of eatin you know Church is still
[1:35:43] trying to figure this out
[1:35:44] hallelujah you go to one church and
[1:35:46] they'll tell you they ate an apple can I
[1:35:51] just ask a question anybody ever heard
[1:35:53] that before a date after Peter um
[1:35:56] estranged me and he heard a tap alright
[1:35:58] I heard it too
[1:35:59] what they I found out that was a lie
[1:36:02] because the question is if they ate an
[1:36:05] apple and an apple helped them to
[1:36:08] realize that they was naked why don't we
[1:36:12] start passing apples again
[1:36:14] to help people realize their naked right
[1:36:16] it was not an apple that they ate
[1:36:18] another thing about this so-called fruit
[1:36:21] that they ate right evened up having
[1:36:23] children come on somebody right right
[1:36:26] two sons were born Cain and Abel were
[1:36:29] born a man from something that happened
[1:36:30] in the Garden of Eden right and if

[1:37:04] devil we hit a destroyer work to the
[1:37:06] death hi

[1:37:14] actually say it was the muggle doll
[1:37:16] living however it did not say that Adam
[1:37:20] was the father of all living because he
[1:37:23] wasn't right there was two children born
[1:37:25] and guess what they happen to be twins
[1:37:27] right I think there's this word they use
[1:37:31] super second nation of something like
[1:37:36] that right and and recently something
[1:37:38] just came out of the news where a woman
[1:37:41] had two kids hallelujah and one was one

[1:37:54] imagine being in the hospital and the
[1:37:58] baby comes to babies comfort in the what
[1:38:02] is this this is not my boy a little
[1:38:09] mixture in my blood

[1:38:19] to trick me into make them think that
[1:38:21] there was paper that is not fake child
[1:38:23] and when they do blood tests they begin
[1:38:26] to recognize this is not the father then
[1:38:29] the mother has to come out and tell the
[1:38:31] truth being the stories that happen all
[1:38:34] the time it's not consistent but it does
[1:38:41] hallelujah and then the mommy I'll say

[1:39:06] happened in the Garden of Eden yeah oh
[1:39:08] we gonna go a little deeper
[1:39:11] Adam had this baby through where how
[1:39:15] does she get pregnant by the others by
[1:39:16] something else well Baba say what's a
[1:39:18] serpent what do you mean well let's look
[1:39:21] at Genesis 3 and you'll see that there
[1:39:24] were three people or three items that
[1:39:26] were individuals are three something
[1:39:28] that got in trouble is that Alright hey
[1:39:33] there Laurie to God and then we saw Eve
[1:39:36] get in trouble we saw Adam get in
[1:39:38] trouble how come the elephant they get
[1:39:41] in trouble how come the tiger did get in
[1:39:43] trouble a man they only got in trouble
[1:39:46] because Adam was in trouble a man but
[1:39:49] God dealt with the serpent so what does
[1:39:51] that tell us that tell us that the
[1:39:53] servants stood on two feet look just
[1:39:56] like a man talk just like a man walk
[1:39:59] just like a man

[1:40:54] now destroying she didn't get pregnant
[1:41:02] this just because something they see
[1:41:05] what's supposed to do it's okay to say
[1:41:11] that in church they're right he's
[1:41:16] committed adultery with the serpent with
[1:41:21] the serpent now I want to taste some has
[1:41:23] she done this with in her marriage god

[1:45:40] job to try to kill the righteous seat
[1:45:42] that's all he want to do is kill her
[1:45:44] actually that was Satan's attempt
[1:45:46] because he knew that the seat was coming
[1:45:48] through the Worman and here he saw the
[1:45:50] right to see Adam's right to see coming
[1:45:52] through Eve as Abel and Cain reaches out
[1:45:55] to try to kill him from the beginning of
[1:45:57] time Satan has always tried to kill the
[1:46:01] right to see look the enemy tried to
[1:46:04] destroy the seed and Abel but God raised
[1:46:06] up raise it up itself if you all
[1:46:08] remember the story of Moses what was he
[1:46:10] trying to do kill the right to sea at
[1:46:13] Moses birth hallelujah amen
[1:46:17] the devil was trying to kill the
[1:46:19] righteous see in the red sea glory to
[1:46:22] God the devil thought he had him there
[1:46:23] but God made a way for the right to see
[1:46:25] a man Pharaoh's army coming behind him
[1:46:28] trying to kill the right to see when the
[1:46:30] Hebrew boys got trapped in the fiery
[1:46:32] furnace what were they trying to do
[1:46:34] trying to kill the righteous see where
[1:46:36] Daniel winter Lyons
[1:46:38] they were trying to kill the righteous
[1:46:40] Caesar when David went out there to face
[1:46:45] Goliath here the same end we tried to
[1:46:47] keep them under bondage and kill all the
[1:46:49] right to see the right to see that the
[1:46:51] righteous nation of Israel but when
[1:46:53] Goliath thought he had the upper hand
[1:46:54] God made a way out of no way I love that
[1:46:58] church I love that now let me just share
[1:47:00] one other with you Joshua was born to
[1:47:02] destroy Joshua was born to destroy a man
[1:47:07] all at ease all these other ones David
[1:47:09] was born to destroy Daniel born to
[1:47:11] destroy the Hebrew boy was born to
[1:47:13] destroy a man you you're born to destroy
[1:47:15] Jesus born to destroy we're all born to
[1:47:18] destroy demolish ruin wipe out the devil
[1:47:23] Josh was born to destruct destroy now
[1:47:25] one of the things that God told Joshua
[1:47:27] as they were going into the Promised
[1:47:29] Land him saying I don't to make any
[1:47:30] alliances with these people over there
[1:47:33] in this land don't do anything because
[1:47:35] these people a man will actually be
[1:47:37] cause you ought to do some things you're
[1:47:38] not supposed to do they'll cause you to
[1:47:39] serve gods that you're not supposed to
[1:47:41] serve he say destroy them when you went
[1:47:43] when they went it - winner - Jericho he
[1:47:47] told him destroy everything
[1:47:48] utterly destroy everything except rehab
[1:47:52] and those that are inside rehabs house
[1:47:53] but everybody else had to die if they
[1:47:56] were not underneath the toolkit they had
[1:47:59] to die my god now you might wonder why
[1:48:02] does God want to kill all the little
[1:48:04] babies why would God tell Joshua - go
[1:48:09] ahead kill all these little babies look
[1:48:10] look babies from Jericho well I mean
[1:48:13] just a little baby that's just that's
[1:48:15] just wrong why would God do something
[1:48:17] like that you just don't understand see
[1:48:19] one day these babies grow and when they
[1:48:22] grow up they're gonna want to know what
[1:48:23] happened to their mamas and daddies and
[1:48:25] when they realized you killed a momma's
[1:48:27] and daddies even though you fed them
[1:48:30] they'll be ready to destroy you
[1:48:33] hallelujah already God let's look at
[1:48:36] this a quote out of presuming the
[1:48:39] Prophet makes this statement a man a man
[1:48:42] says after after while when Joshua took
[1:48:45] the land God told him utterly destroy
[1:48:47] everything there is don't leave nothing
[1:48:49] why could you imagine some of them it's
[1:48:52] all right women picking up a little baby
[1:48:53] oh isn't he cute look at it he ain't
[1:48:57] even got teeth yet Joseph said kill it
[1:49:00] oh that's so me kill it
[1:49:06] I can imagine right now taking a sword
[1:49:09] out drawing it on the baby Johnson to
[1:49:13] kill it the mother said oh I'm a mother
[1:49:15] I can't kill that baby you must hand it
[1:49:18] here he says says why it might look cute
[1:49:23] now but it'll grow up and be just like
[1:49:26] his daddy you you you can't babysit it's
[1:49:46] got to be handled not with gloves but
[1:49:48] bare hand it we want we want to be nice
[1:49:51] everybody does but what is nice we want
[1:49:53] to be humble what is humility we want to
[1:49:56] be full of compassion what is compassion
[1:49:58] she needs a cement will of compassion
[1:50:01] pass through two or three thousand
[1:50:03] people water had babies crippled blind
[1:50:05] hole with he had compassion what did he
[1:50:08] do walked over here the father showed
[1:50:11] him a man that may be prostate trouble
[1:50:13] or something and healed him and walked
[1:50:16] away
[1:50:16] and let the rest of them a man full of
[1:50:18] compassion now people today are English
[1:50:21] words turns the people around see that's
[1:50:24] human sympathy that's not compassion
[1:50:27] there's a lot of difference between
[1:50:29] sympathy and compassion there's
[1:50:31] - there there are two different words
[1:50:33] all together and we use them the same
[1:50:35] now the word doesn't use any compassion
[1:50:38] it's got to be your pain stay with that
[1:50:41] word no matter how bad it cuts glory how
[1:50:47] would you think in a destroyed babies
[1:50:49] and innocent women and things like that
[1:50:51] so come one little leaven leavens the
[1:50:54] whole lump that's the same thing that
[1:50:56] started back there with Eve it looked
[1:50:59] awful cunning well you'll be washed
[1:51:02] surely you'll not that he's too good see
[1:51:04] God is too good to kill you he wouldn't
[1:51:07] kill you but surely you're not you're
[1:51:09] not dying but God said you would die
[1:51:12] that started the whole thing right there
[1:51:14] see you got to stay with the word
[1:51:16] regardless hey man then he might not
[1:51:19] have died right then but they died later
[1:51:21] on yeah they were broken a man the
[1:51:24] eternal fellowship with God was broken
[1:51:26] because of what happened in the Garden
[1:51:28] of Eden
[1:51:28] now I want to just kind of shift our
[1:51:30] attention because there's another
[1:51:32] gentleman in Scripture that was born his
[1:51:37] whole purpose for being born was so he
[1:51:40] can destroy all right God brought this
[1:51:43] man out his mama's womb his bride can
[1:51:45] even have kids mom couldn't me have
[1:51:47] children and one day she got visited by
[1:51:50] the angel the Lord and I want you to try
[1:51:53] to stay with me on this because if she
[1:51:54] got visit by the angel Lord an angel or
[1:51:56] told us say now you're gonna have a son
[1:51:59] and I'm gonna give you a son and his
[1:52:02] whole purpose is it is a gift for these
[1:52:03] Philistines that's been bringing y'all
[1:52:05] under captivity and in bondage for years
[1:52:08] y'all have been in captivity but I'm
[1:52:09] raising up a boy from your your womb and
[1:52:14] gave the mama bear specific instructions
[1:52:17] don't cut his hair right and while he's
[1:52:20] in the womb don't drink
[1:52:23] okay Wow while he's in the womb mama
[1:52:29] don't drink right all right
[1:52:32] can I tell you you carrying something
[1:52:34] because the church is also represented
[1:52:37] as some woman and you're carrying the
[1:52:39] Word of God yes and since you're
[1:52:41] carrying the Word of God don't drink
[1:52:47] don't drink
[1:52:49] you might harm the baby so smooth
[1:52:52] you might harm the baby hello somebody
[1:52:56] told play we're seeing glory we got a
[1:53:00] man you don't want your baby coming out
[1:53:03] with some addiction and they get the
[1:53:05] addiction from the momma hit something

[1:53:13] you want a mommy that's gonna take care
[1:53:15] of her body when she pregnant
[1:53:18] you can't keep acting like things ain't
[1:53:21] change something has changed come on
[1:53:26] somebody we don't understand

[1:53:40] [Applause]
[1:53:55] mama don't drink that's what they are
[1:53:58] you saying on threat and not only to
[1:53:59] each other mama - mama mama went home
[1:54:01] and told her husband and when the
[1:54:03] husband you know I heard about Islam
[1:54:05] it's just kinda hard to believe say if
[1:54:07] that's of God let that let him come back
[1:54:09] again let the man come back again and
[1:54:10] while she was either feel you know
[1:54:12] working here come that angel again and
[1:54:15] she went ran and got I love him say he's

[2:14:34] begin to feel himself again and he
[2:14:37] twists it out and and when it did the
[2:14:38] big wall fell all we need to do today to
[2:14:42] see these denomination walls fall is get
[2:14:45] deeply sincere before God to heal these
[2:14:48] blinded eyes that's been blinded from
[2:14:51] the Word of God that was stamps ins
[2:14:54] greatest victory he ever had because he
[2:14:57] was willing to confess over every enemy
[2:15:02] first that he was brought up to destroy
[2:15:05] him oh Pentecost stand up to post this

[2:18:09] life where you would specifically
[2:18:11] challenges to bring us back to a place
[2:18:17] where we can accept you Lord our only
[2:18:21] hope is in you
[2:18:25] our only trust is in you and father how
[2:18:30] we even heat we need you we realize that
[2:18:33] we can't make it without you you have
[2:18:37] protected us from the hands of the enemy
[2:18:39] time and time again and God you've done
[2:18:42] that in order to bring us to a place of
[2:18:43] complete surrender those that were in
[2:18:48] Jericho all died utterly destroyed there
[2:18:51] was only one house that was spared and
[2:18:54] that was the house of rehab because she
[2:18:57] had the token own display father I pray
[2:19:03] that as this word has gone forth that
[2:19:05] somebody recognize that they don't have
[2:19:07] what it takes to make it and that they
[2:19:11] got to bring themselves underneath the
[2:19:12] covering of the blood of Jesus I trust
[2:19:18] Lord Jesus
[2:19:22] that you would now just take control of
[2:19:24] hearts and then your word would make the
[2:19:28] difference
[2:19:33] while your has about I want to just give
[2:19:36] an opportunity for anyone that might
[2:19:40] feel past that a date is discernment
[2:19:43] that was for me and I'm being destroyed
[2:19:48] by the any might find myself like Samson
[2:19:51] bound to things that I should not be
[2:19:53] bound to but today I want to be free and
[2:19:56] the presence of God I believe what the
[2:20:00] word says that Jesus came to to destroy
[2:20:04] the works to manifest the work of God
[2:20:07] destroy the works of the enemy and the
[2:20:08] enemy has certainly worked in my life
[2:20:11] but I want to see him destroy it today

[2:21:00] how much you need tell them how much you
[2:21:04] want before I pray I want to give
[2:21:12] another opportunity you know there's
[2:21:15] gonna come a day in time where God will
[2:21:17] replace these services back to us

[2:21:24] nothing like watching it in the inn and
[2:21:25] the heavenly sky because we've had
