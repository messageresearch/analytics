[1:37:20] i call him the bishop
[1:37:24] and our sister west
[1:37:26] hey man and before i go verify i just
[1:37:30] also would want to
[1:37:32] appreciate those that have been behind
[1:37:34] this uh brother jack
[1:37:36] brother fredo brother mike
[1:37:38] and uh brother kobe um we really
[1:37:41] appreciate all your brothers for
[1:37:43] everything that you've done
[1:37:45] amen
[1:37:48] as brother jack said yesterday
[1:37:51] these meetings the way they came about
[1:37:52] was when i came for um sister rebecca's
[1:37:56] wedding and brother aaron
[1:37:58] amen oh yeah
[1:38:00] by the way we we have unresolved
[1:38:03] business
[1:38:04] [Laughter]
[1:38:07] amen he knows what that is
[1:38:10] he didn't pay lobola
[1:38:17] praise the lord
[1:38:21] so we we we just got to talking about
[1:38:23] this and um we were talking about
[1:38:26] brother weskos 80th birthday and
[1:38:30] how that you know it will be good for us
[1:38:33] to to come to be together and i really
[1:38:36] wanted to come for brother weskos 80th
[1:38:39] birthday
[1:38:41] but
[1:38:41] when we go to talking together with the
[1:38:43] saints in london because of our school
[1:38:46] calendar it was not possible for us to
[1:38:49] be here on the 4th of july because
[1:38:51] schools would not have been closed our
[1:38:53] schools were only closing i think on the
[1:38:56] 15th or 16th of july something like that
[1:38:59] so because of that we then made a
[1:39:01] request that
[1:39:03] if we can have this
[1:39:05] this weekend
[1:39:07] and we so glad that the brothers made a
[1:39:10] way for that to happen let's just
[1:39:12] appreciate them for that
[1:39:16] amen
[1:39:19] but the real event was really the best
[1:39:23] the celebration of
[1:39:25] a brother wesker
[1:39:27] and it's one birthday that i really
[1:39:29] really wanted to be around for
[1:39:32] so
[1:39:33] i want to say
[1:39:35] happy birthday reverend westgale
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:40] we we just want to
[1:39:42] unwind to go back to the 4th of july
[1:39:46] amen because that is when we were
[1:39:48] supposed to be here
[1:39:50] so we we we we kind of like shortchanged
[1:39:54] ourselves
[1:39:55] so because of that we want to take
[1:39:57] advantage of tonight
[1:40:00] amen now i first met brother wesko i
[1:40:04] think it's more than 20 years ago now
[1:40:07] when he came to minister for us in in
[1:40:09] zimbabwe
[1:40:10] and during that time i would drive
[1:40:12] brother wesker around take him to my
[1:40:14] house and
[1:40:16] we used to have fellowship
[1:40:18] and
[1:40:18] then when i moved over to to england
[1:40:22] he invited me to come over here so in
[1:40:25] the united states
[1:40:27] this was the very first pulpit i first
[1:40:29] preached in
[1:40:30] in the usa
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:34] and that to me is is not a small thing
[1:40:38] amen
[1:40:39] and again apart from
[1:40:41] our home church uh
[1:40:43] zimbabwe and the uk in our home church
[1:40:46] um
[1:40:48] this is probably the pulpit that i've
[1:40:49] preached the most from
[1:40:52] outside of the home church
[1:40:54] i've preached more services visiting out
[1:40:56] of this place than anywhere else
[1:40:59] in as much as i've gone in a lot of
[1:41:01] other places but
[1:41:03] this place just keeps repeating
[1:41:06] there's just something about it
[1:41:08] something about south florida
[1:41:11] amen we
[1:41:13] we call it our second home now
[1:41:17] the first time i came here is we're
[1:41:19] probably going back now about 16 years
[1:41:22] or thereabout
[1:41:23] so it's been a while
[1:41:25] and we we thank god for
[1:41:27] um how far he has brought us
[1:41:30] um when brother wesko would come to
[1:41:33] preach back then
[1:41:35] wow i saw this man come to the pulpit
[1:41:38] and i saw how he would take the
[1:41:41] quotations
[1:41:42] and how you just stay with the courts
[1:41:44] and then he would be ministering around
[1:41:47] those courts i said my i like this style
[1:41:52] i just want to say to the saints from
[1:41:54] london that that is what shaped me
[1:41:57] that's why i caught a lot i learned it
[1:42:00] from brother wesko
[1:42:02] amen it changed the way i approached the
[1:42:05] message
[1:42:07] we used to court but not that much
[1:42:10] but when brother wesco came
[1:42:13] i picked up
[1:42:14] a new dimension
[1:42:17] and that's how much the influence has
[1:42:19] been
[1:42:19] [Applause]
[1:42:21] that's why i call him bishop westfall
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:26] praise the lord
[1:42:29] so
[1:42:30] on behalf of
[1:42:32] the saints of my my my country friends
[1:42:35] in zimbabwe the saints in london
[1:42:38] our church the spoken word ministries

[1:46:36] for thou we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:46:40] war after the flesh
[1:46:43] for the weapons of our warfare are not

[1:46:48] pulling down of strongholds
[1:46:52] what a scripture
[1:46:55] and then in the book of hebrews chapter
[1:46:56] 11
[1:46:59] it says now faith
[1:47:01] is the substance of things hoped for
[1:47:04] the evidence of things not sin for by it
[1:47:08] the elders obtained a good report
[1:47:12] through faith we understand that the
[1:47:14] worlds were framed by the word of god
[1:47:16] so that the things which are seen were
[1:47:18] not made of things which do appear
[1:47:22] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[1:47:25] excellent sacrifice than cain by which
[1:47:28] he obtained witness that he was
[1:47:30] righteous
[1:47:31] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:47:35] being dead
[1:47:36] yet
[1:47:37] speaketh
[1:47:39] we may be seated
[1:47:42] as we bow our heads for a weight of
[1:47:44] prayer
[1:47:46] mighty god
[1:47:49] father we
[1:47:50] now come to that sacred time
[1:47:54] the time lord father that we gather for
[1:47:58] the time of the ministration of the word
[1:48:02] unable
[1:48:05] but looking to the able god
[1:48:08] feeble
[1:48:10] but looking to the o strong and mighty
[1:48:13] god
[1:48:15] father i confess my inabilities
[1:48:19] and i ask oh god that you can step right
[1:48:22] in now
[1:48:24] father is your children
[1:48:26] we are ready
[1:48:28] we ask you that you can speak to our
[1:48:30] hearts tonight
[1:48:32] lord
[1:48:33] we thank you father for bringing us yet
[1:48:36] again into this place
[1:48:39] but father our gathering will be in vain
[1:48:43] unless lord you speak to us
[1:48:46] we therefore ask that you the great one
[1:48:48] might take over now
[1:48:51] may we decrease
[1:48:53] and may you increase
[1:48:55] have preeminence in this place
[1:48:58] we'll be careful in all to give you the
[1:49:00] honor the glory and the praise
[1:49:02] and all the church shall say
[1:49:05] amen and amen
[1:49:07] praise the lord god bless you
[1:49:11] i mean under expectation
[1:49:23] how many is under expectation
[1:49:28] there's one thing that i know about
[1:49:29] south florida
[1:49:31] they know how to say amen
[1:49:35] that even if you came without a salmon
[1:49:38] when the brothers start to say amen
[1:49:41] the same one will come
[1:49:44] hey do we still have that
[1:49:47] are we still the same
[1:49:50] praise god in the highest
[1:49:52] i want to take a title and the title
[1:49:55] that i want to speak on i want to speak
[1:49:57] on
[1:49:57] the center
[1:49:59] with unlimited power
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:05] just for us to get where i'm coming from
[1:50:08] i want to start by reading a statement
[1:50:11] that the prophet makes concerning this
[1:50:13] scientist that was called einstein
[1:50:17] how many of you have heard of einstein
[1:50:20] i'm sure a lot of us have heard of this
[1:50:22] scientist for those who do not know
[1:50:24] einstein he was one of the greatest
[1:50:27] scientists that ever lived
[1:50:30] a highly decorated scientist
[1:50:33] with walls plastered of qualifications
[1:50:36] remarkable scientists who made some
[1:50:38] remarkable discoveries
[1:50:41] now we we want to take our title and our
[1:50:43] inspiration off out of what the prophet
[1:50:45] says concerning this man
[1:50:48] the prophet of god says
[1:50:50] if ainston had only had the spiritual
[1:50:54] application
[1:50:55] as he had the physical application
[1:50:59] as he studied the laws of light and so
[1:51:02] forth he could have told us something
[1:51:06] as powerful
[1:51:09] when i heard his message on that great
[1:51:12] center some way into the skies that ever
[1:51:16] contracted with the center you could
[1:51:18] create earth
[1:51:20] and do anything and the power would be
[1:51:24] unlimited
[1:51:27] he had seen that
[1:51:31] now this is powerful
[1:51:37] but i want you to look at this saints
[1:51:40] though this man was a great scientist
[1:51:43] though this man was highly decorated
[1:51:46] with probably wars plastered of
[1:51:48] qualifications degrees and phds and
[1:51:51] whatever he had
[1:51:52] but we read here what the prophet is
[1:51:55] saying and the prophet is telling us of
[1:51:57] a limitation that this man had
[1:52:02] though great as he was
[1:52:05] but the prophet is telling us that the
[1:52:07] man had a limitation
[1:52:10] and the prophet is telling us that the
[1:52:12] limitation was because of the way and
[1:52:14] the realm in which he operated
[1:52:19] and the prophet is telling us here that
[1:52:21] the limitation was because the man was
[1:52:24] operating in a physical realm
[1:52:29] and the prophet says here if only he had
[1:52:32] the spiritual application
[1:52:34] as he had this physical application so
[1:52:37] we can begin to see here that man has
[1:52:40] got a limitation as long as they are
[1:52:43] still operating in a physical realm
[1:52:46] [Applause]
[1:52:49] and the only way to break out of that
[1:52:51] limitation it is for men to climb a
[1:52:54] little higher it is for men to live the
[1:52:57] physical side and get into the spiritual
[1:53:00] side are you with me church
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:04] the prophet of god says now if we who
[1:53:07] are acquainted with the supernatural
[1:53:09] would just take a man where the man in
[1:53:11] his senses is limited to his senses
[1:53:15] but a man and his spirit
[1:53:18] is unlimited
[1:53:23] now when we are talking about the senses
[1:53:24] we we're talking about the five senses
[1:53:26] here
[1:53:27] and we are talking about how we contact
[1:53:30] our earthly dimensions
[1:53:31] we're talking about the body here
[1:53:35] and the prophet of god says a man in his
[1:53:38] senses is limited to his senses but a
[1:53:41] man in his spirit is unlimited
[1:53:46] therefore let me say church that
[1:53:49] whatever you want to achieve in life
[1:53:52] if you want to achieve it from a
[1:53:53] physical realm you will always have
[1:53:55] limitations
[1:53:57] now the prophet of god tells us that any
[1:54:00] man that ever amounted to something had
[1:54:02] to set some goals
[1:54:05] they had to tie themselves to certain
[1:54:07] goals and say this i believe and thus i
[1:54:10] tie myself to it
[1:54:12] now many times those goals as we are
[1:54:14] going through this life's journey they
[1:54:16] are physical goals
[1:54:19] but i want to say that though your goal
[1:54:21] is physical but if you try and approach
[1:54:24] it from a physical perspective
[1:54:27] you're not going to get very far
[1:54:29] so no matter whether the goal is
[1:54:31] physical but let your approach be
[1:54:34] spiritual
[1:54:37] that's why paul writing in the book of
[1:54:39] corinthians he says for though we walk
[1:54:42] in the flesh we do not woe after the
[1:54:45] flesh
[1:54:47] yes we might leave in this flesh but let
[1:54:50] our warring amen let our fighting not be
[1:54:53] fleshly let it be spiritual
[1:54:57] though we walk in the flesh but we do
[1:54:59] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[1:55:02] of our warfare they are not canal but
[1:55:05] they are mighty through god to the
[1:55:08] pulling down of strongholds
[1:55:12] so a christian strength hallelujah is
[1:55:15] not in the fleshly
[1:55:17] relying on the flesh is limited by how
[1:55:20] much muscle power you got
[1:55:23] relying on your intellectual power is
[1:55:26] limited to how much education and iq you
[1:55:29] have
[1:55:30] but when you come to the spirit praise
[1:55:32] god
[1:55:34] we step into a realm that is unlimited
[1:55:38] [Applause]
[1:55:41] now in order to understand why we end up
[1:55:43] with this limitation let's look at
[1:55:46] genesis chapter 1 26 and genesis chapter
[1:55:49] 2 7 because we have to look at how man
[1:55:52] was manifested upon this earth
[1:55:55] when we look at genesis 1 27
[1:55:58] the bible says so god created man in his
[1:56:01] own image in the image of god created he
[1:56:04] him male and female created he them
[1:56:10] so we find here that we have a created
[1:56:13] man
[1:56:15] but when we come to the genesis 2 7 man
[1:56:18] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[1:56:21] of the ground
[1:56:23] so we have a created man and we have a
[1:56:26] formed man then god amen breath into his
[1:56:30] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:56:33] became a living soul
[1:56:37] now the first creation that god had what
[1:56:40] was the first creation it was a spirit
[1:56:44] man
[1:56:46] and then after the spirit man then we
[1:56:48] find that god then he formed man
[1:56:52] out of the dust of the earth
[1:56:54] but what god then did amen the mystery
[1:56:57] of the breathing of the breath of life
[1:56:59] into this man was when god amen then
[1:57:02] combined this man together with that man
[1:57:08] and man became a living soul
[1:57:14] are you with me saints
[1:57:16] praise be to god
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:19] that's how god did it
[1:57:22] but i want you to watch amen that this
[1:57:25] man when god originally created him when
[1:57:28] the spirit man and the body the formed
[1:57:30] man when they were different amen this
[1:57:33] here
[1:57:34] was what god created
[1:57:37] and this was what god formed
[1:57:45] and there is a difference
[1:57:47] [Applause]
[1:57:48] and the reason amen why this man is not
[1:57:52] limited it is because he is created in
[1:57:55] the image of god
[1:57:57] in the likeness of god here's the dna of
[1:58:00] god here's the capacity of god here's
[1:58:04] the capability of god he has the great
[1:58:06] abilities of god because he's the ship
[1:58:10] of the old block
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:15] now with that god ability this man amen
[1:58:19] all things
[1:58:21] are possible to him
[1:58:24] not some things
[1:58:26] or glory to god but all things that
[1:58:29] become possible to him
[1:58:31] cannot have what they are cannot how far
[1:58:35] they have gone cannot how impossible it
[1:58:38] looks but i want to say with god all
[1:58:42] things are possible
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:46] or we can almost begin to preach right
[1:58:48] here
[1:58:49] that when god's ability steps into a
[1:58:51] human being i don't care where you are i
[1:58:54] don't care how hard it looks i don't
[1:58:57] care how difficult it sounds but when
[1:58:59] god steps in praise be to god all
[1:59:04] things
[1:59:05] are possible
[1:59:08] it might be at the red sea
[1:59:10] and pharaoh is saying the god of moses
[1:59:14] is a poor general but what he does not
[1:59:17] know is that the core of moses
[1:59:19] hallelujah when he steps on the scene
[1:59:23] even when there is no bridge there shall
[1:59:25] be a bridge
[1:59:28] even an uncrossable red sea becomes
[1:59:30] crossable all things become possible
[1:59:36] it might be at the river jordan and it
[1:59:38] looks like it is flooded but when god
[1:59:40] steps in
[1:59:42] all things are possible
[1:59:44] it might be shadrach meshach and
[1:59:46] abednego that are in a fairy fairness
[1:59:49] but though they are in a very fairness
[1:59:51] all things are possible
[1:59:54] they are coming out
[1:59:56] or i don't know who is a shadrach today
[1:59:59] i don't know who is a mischief today i
[2:00:01] don't know who is in a bad today
[2:00:03] you might be sitting in a fire but i
[2:00:06] want to tell you you're coming out of it
[2:00:09] i got some good news for you
[2:00:11] you coming out of it
[2:00:13] say amen somebody
[2:00:15] hallelujah
[2:00:17] you might be in a lion's den but very
[2:00:20] soon the lions then will become the den
[2:00:22] of the of of daniel
[2:00:25] the tables will turn
[2:00:28] o praise the lord when satan puts you in
[2:00:31] prison hallelujah but when god is inside
[2:00:34] of you you end up imprisoning the devil
[2:00:38] that tried to put you into that prison
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:44] so church of the living god where we
[2:00:47] become powerful it is when we climb into
[2:00:50] the spiritual realm
[2:00:52] when we get into the spiritual realm we
[2:00:55] have territorial advantage
[2:01:00] when we are in the flesh
[2:01:02] we have a territorial disadvantage
[2:01:05] that's why paul says though i walk in
[2:01:08] the flesh but i do not woe after the
[2:01:11] flesh because i don't have an advantage
[2:01:14] in the flesh
[2:01:16] [Applause]
[2:01:18] i'm reminded of an ego
[2:01:21] that when an ego is attacking a serpent
[2:01:24] a snake no matter how big the snake is
[2:01:27] the ego comes from the highs and it
[2:01:30] comes sweeping hallelujah and he just
[2:01:33] comes and he picks up that snake and he
[2:01:35] takes it up into the air the moment the
[2:01:38] snake is in the air it is disoriented
[2:01:41] because it is not meant to be in the
[2:01:44] eyes
[2:01:47] the moment the snake comes up into the
[2:01:49] air it is completely disoriented the ego
[2:01:54] hallelujah a bird of the air now has
[2:01:57] territorial advantage it can do what it
[2:02:00] wants with that devil let me tell you
[2:02:03] you are an eagle of god if you take your
[2:02:06] problem into the spiritual realm you can
[2:02:09] do what you want or tonight you can do
[2:02:12] what you want with your situation
[2:02:20] when the eagle is up there with the
[2:02:23] serpent hanging on his feet amen then he
[2:02:26] just looks for a rock
[2:02:28] oh glory to god and when it identifies
[2:02:31] where the rock is then it drops the
[2:02:34] serpent
[2:02:35] and by the time it hits the rock the
[2:02:38] serpent is gone
[2:02:40] hey hey hey identify your serpent and
[2:02:43] identify the rock the rock is jesus and
[2:02:46] drop him right there he will be finished
[2:02:49] before the service is over
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:53] let's learn to take it
[2:02:56] to the spiritual realm
[2:02:58] because that's where we have our
[2:02:59] advantage
[2:03:01] why
[2:03:03] because the spirit man
[2:03:05] this man here
[2:03:07] is a seventh dimension
[2:03:10] this one
[2:03:12] is the three-dimensional man
[2:03:15] this one
[2:03:16] he came from god
[2:03:18] but this one
[2:03:20] came from the dust
[2:03:26] glory to god
[2:03:29] now let me just come back to einstein
[2:03:36] now
[2:03:36] they say that einstein
[2:03:39] he had a very deep quest to understand
[2:03:42] how this world was formed
[2:03:46] it is said that he had a quest
[2:03:49] to know god's thoughts
[2:03:53] and i was reading an article that was
[2:03:55] published by another scientist highly
[2:03:57] decorated to call don lincoln
[2:04:00] and this is what the man says about
[2:04:01] ainston
[2:04:03] he says in 1925 instant went on a walk
[2:04:07] with a young student named esther
[2:04:09] solomon
[2:04:10] as they wondered he shared his
[2:04:12] co-guiding intellectual principle
[2:04:14] i want to know
[2:04:16] how god created this world
[2:04:20] this was ancient
[2:04:22] i'm not interested in this or that
[2:04:25] phenomena in the spectrum of this or
[2:04:27] that element i want to know his thoughts
[2:04:32] the rest are just details
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:38] so this is what ainston this is what
[2:04:40] drove him
[2:04:42] he says i want to know how god created
[2:04:44] this world
[2:04:47] i'm not interested in this and that
[2:04:49] phenomenon this spectrum of this and
[2:04:51] that element all i want to know is his
[2:04:54] thoughts
[2:04:57] and he says the rest are details
[2:05:00] he goes on and he says the phrase god's
[2:05:03] thought
[2:05:04] is a delightful up metaphor for the
[2:05:07] ultimate goal of modern physics which is
[2:05:09] to develop a perfect understanding of
[2:05:12] the laws of nature
[2:05:15] what physicists call
[2:05:17] a theory of everything or the t-o-e
[2:05:22] and they say ideally a t-o-e would
[2:05:25] answer all questions leaving nothing
[2:05:27] unanswered
[2:05:29] like why is the sky blue it is covered
[2:05:32] why does gravity exist
[2:05:35] that's cover two
[2:05:37] stated in a more scientific way a theory
[2:05:40] of everything would ideally explain all
[2:05:43] phenomena with a single theory a single
[2:05:46] building block and a single force
[2:05:50] and he says in my opinion finding the
[2:05:53] t.o.e could take hundreds or even
[2:05:56] thousands of years
[2:06:02] this is what science is looking at
[2:06:05] and this is what science is trying to
[2:06:06] drive it
[2:06:08] and einstein made this famous statement
[2:06:10] and he says all i want a man i want to
[2:06:14] know god's thoughts
[2:06:17] the rest is not important
[2:06:22] no wonder why the prophet said these
[2:06:25] scientists shall find god
[2:06:27] before we the preachers show him to the
[2:06:30] people
[2:06:35] and the scientists they go deep into
[2:06:38] probing in science
[2:06:40] they spend sleepless nights they crack
[2:06:42] their brains they dig deep trying to
[2:06:44] understand trying to find out how was
[2:06:46] this world created
[2:06:49] they are looking at the thoughts of god
[2:06:52] and that's what ainston was looking for
[2:06:53] he was looking at the thoughts of god
[2:06:56] but i want to say church what science is
[2:06:59] looking for
[2:07:01] we already have
[2:07:06] what science is struggling to get we
[2:07:09] already know what it is we have the
[2:07:12] thoughts of god
[2:07:14] what are the thoughts of god the thought
[2:07:16] of god amen the prophet says a word is a
[2:07:20] thought expressed so now when you look
[2:07:23] at the evolution of the word or the end
[2:07:26] morphing of the word
[2:07:31] that's a new word right
[2:07:34] but the prophet taught us amen about god
[2:07:36] and murphy
[2:07:38] god changing form
[2:07:41] i'm talking about the enmorphing of the
[2:07:43] word
[2:07:44] when you look at the enmorphing of the
[2:07:46] word we look at the word stages the
[2:07:49] first stage that we find it is the
[2:07:51] thought of god
[2:07:53] in the back parts of the mind of god and
[2:07:56] then when god wants to reveal what is in
[2:07:58] the bad parts of his mind what does he
[2:08:00] do then god amen he makes his thoughts
[2:08:03] known in visions and in dreams to his
[2:08:07] prophets
[2:08:08] then when the prophet catches the vision
[2:08:10] then the next thing that the prophet
[2:08:12] does is he speaks the word
[2:08:16] habakkuk then says write the vision make
[2:08:20] it plain upon the tables so the vision
[2:08:22] amen it comes from the word form and it
[2:08:26] comes into the written form
[2:08:28] are you with me saints
[2:08:31] write the vision and make it plain way
[2:08:33] upon the tables
[2:08:35] but in this last day praise be to god
[2:08:38] god then says but in the days of the
[2:08:41] voice of the seventh angel so in this
[2:08:44] days god made sure that his word was
[2:08:48] kept in voice form
[2:08:50] [Applause]
[2:08:53] the thoughts of god
[2:08:55] when you go to playing the message what
[2:08:58] you are listening to glory to god are
[2:09:01] the thoughts of god revealed in our day
[2:09:08] glory to god
[2:09:10] but let me say sayings that that is not
[2:09:12] the highest form of god
[2:09:15] can you see or this is blocking somebody
[2:09:20] all right
[2:09:21] the last stage amen it is the manifested
[2:09:25] word
[2:09:26] so in as much amen as we love the
[2:09:29] visions but that was not the highest
[2:09:31] form of god's word in as much as we love
[2:09:34] the written word but that is not the
[2:09:36] highest form of god's word in as much as
[2:09:39] we love the spoken word but that is not
[2:09:42] the highest form of god's word because
[2:09:44] god's purpose was not to keep his word
[2:09:47] here
[2:09:49] god's purpose was for us to eat the book
[2:09:53] and to become the book
[2:09:56] so when we become the book the book
[2:09:58] comes inside of you you become the
[2:10:02] manifested word of god let me tell you
[2:10:05] the highest form of the word i'm looking
[2:10:08] at it now when the word becomes flesh
[2:10:15] glory to god in the eyes
[2:10:18] amen and amen
[2:10:21] so what ainston was looking for i want
[2:10:23] to say things we already have
[2:10:27] and where is it amen we already have it
[2:10:31] and it is in the form of the spoken word
[2:10:34] it is in the form of the holy bible the
[2:10:38] thoughts of god what science is trying
[2:10:41] to dig into i don't have to go to
[2:10:43] university i don't need a phd i need to
[2:10:47] be in church and when i'm in church what
[2:10:50] i'm hearing is the thoughts of god
[2:10:56] [Applause]
[2:11:00] praise god in the eyes
[2:11:02] then paul comes along and he says for we
[2:11:05] who have known the mind of the lord that
[2:11:08] he may instruct sorry for who had known
[2:11:11] the mind of the lord that he may
[2:11:13] instruct him but we have
[2:11:16] the mind of christ
[2:11:19] oh come on give the lord a hand of
[2:11:20] praise
[2:11:22] we have
[2:11:25] oh i wish i would leave in the days of
[2:11:28] einstein i'll say mr einstein what you
[2:11:31] are looking for we have
[2:11:34] oh come on saints
[2:11:36] shout it out we have
[2:11:39] the mind of christ
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:41] [Applause]
[2:11:45] i don't need no book to tell me
[2:11:48] we have
[2:11:50] the mind of christ i only need one book
[2:11:53] that is the bible the spoken word the
[2:11:57] thoughts of god i don't need no
[2:11:59] physicist i don't need no scientific
[2:12:02] explanation i don't need no phd book i
[2:12:06] need the word we have the mind of christ
[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:14] praise god in the hearts
[2:12:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:12:19] now why was einstein looking for the
[2:12:21] thoughts of god the reason why he wanted
[2:12:23] the thought of god is because he wanted
[2:12:26] to know how this world
[2:12:28] was formed
[2:12:30] is that what he said
[2:12:32] but we already know
[2:12:36] because paul tells us
[2:12:38] and paul says through faith
[2:12:41] glory to god
[2:12:43] we understand
[2:12:45] that the worlds were framed
[2:12:47] by the word of god
[2:12:52] finished
[2:12:55] through faith
[2:12:57] we understand that the words were framed
[2:13:00] by the word of god hey mr einstein don't
[2:13:03] waste your time
[2:13:08] so that the things
[2:13:10] which are seen were not made of things
[2:13:12] which do appear
[2:13:16] but let's just get a little deep into
[2:13:17] this
[2:13:19] to me this scripture is a double
[2:13:20] entendre
[2:13:24] it is a scripture that has got a
[2:13:25] compound meaning
[2:13:27] because when you look at that scripture
[2:13:29] the scripture says through faith we
[2:13:32] understand that the world were framed by
[2:13:34] the word of god
[2:13:36] and the first meaning that you derive
[2:13:38] after out of that it is that through
[2:13:40] faith
[2:13:41] we who were not there
[2:13:44] when god framed the world we understand
[2:13:47] it by faith
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:51] our faith
[2:13:53] we understand
[2:13:54] that the worlds were framed by the word
[2:13:57] of god
[2:13:58] that's the first meaning
[2:14:01] but the other meaning
[2:14:03] is
[2:14:04] through faith
[2:14:06] the words were framed by the word of god
[2:14:10] we have come to understand it
[2:14:18] let me say it again
[2:14:22] through faith
[2:14:23] the words were framed by the word of god
[2:14:26] we have come to understand it
[2:14:30] in other words the faith that framed the
[2:14:32] word of god is the faith that framed the
[2:14:35] world is the faith of god
[2:14:40] that god used his faith
[2:14:45] [Applause]
[2:14:46] through faith hallelujah that was the
[2:14:49] instrumentality through which god
[2:14:52] created the world
[2:14:56] let me bring you to the message the
[2:14:57] prophet of god says god said let there
[2:15:01] be
[2:15:02] and it was
[2:15:03] he believed his own words
[2:15:08] now when you believe your own word you
[2:15:11] have faith in your own words
[2:15:14] [Applause]
[2:15:17] and every material thing comes from the
[2:15:19] supernatural god spoke the world
[2:15:23] into existence
[2:15:25] when he said let there be he was
[2:15:28] anchoring it on his faith he said my
[2:15:31] word will not return unto me null and
[2:15:33] void but it will accomplish that which
[2:15:36] it purposes i have spoken it it will
[2:15:39] materialize hallelujah i don't need
[2:15:42] nobody to interpret that word the
[2:15:45] manifestation thereof becomes the
[2:15:47] interpretation of it
[2:15:55] so the faith of god hallelujah it is
[2:15:59] what created the world
[2:16:02] so science is looking for a single
[2:16:04] building block science is looking for a
[2:16:06] theory of everything but we are here to
[2:16:09] say we already know the theory that they
[2:16:12] are looking at what is that theory it is
[2:16:15] faith
[2:16:21] now ain't saying he believed that there
[2:16:24] is a center somewhere that if contacted
[2:16:27] that center would produce an unlimited
[2:16:29] power
[2:16:32] the prophet says here
[2:16:35] as he started the laws of light and so
[2:16:38] forth he could have told us something
[2:16:40] when i heard his message on that great
[2:16:42] center somewhere into the skies that
[2:16:45] ever contacted with that center you
[2:16:47] could create aids and do anything and
[2:16:50] the power would be unlimited
[2:16:54] so einstein believed that there is a
[2:16:56] certain center somewhere that if you
[2:16:59] contact that center
[2:17:01] you will have unlimited power
[2:17:06] or did you get what he said
[2:17:08] einstein is saying if you contact that
[2:17:11] center somewhere
[2:17:13] you will have the power
[2:17:15] to create another earth
[2:17:21] that's the power to create a brand new
[2:17:23] world
[2:17:25] but insane was looking at this power
[2:17:28] from a physical perspective and that is
[2:17:30] where his limitation was and that is why
[2:17:33] the prophet of god says if only he had
[2:17:35] the spiritual application of it
[2:17:39] because the signs they can only go this
[2:17:42] far
[2:17:43] the prophet of god says the tree of
[2:17:45] knowledge can only climb so far and it
[2:17:48] breaks back but the tree of life goes on
[2:17:51] forever
[2:17:53] so science can only progress until it
[2:17:56] gets to a certain place but science has
[2:17:58] a limitation
[2:18:00] so ain't saying was looking for the
[2:18:02] center amen that if it is contacted it
[2:18:05] will produce an unlimited power and he
[2:18:08] believed that that center was somewhere
[2:18:10] in the skies but i'm here to say no mr
[2:18:13] einstein it is not just somewhere in the
[2:18:16] skies we know where that power is it is
[2:18:19] resident with the god of creation it is
[2:18:22] resident with our creator
[2:18:25] [Applause]
[2:18:27] he created this first earth therefore he
[2:18:30] has the capacity to create any other
[2:18:32] earth if he so decides
[2:18:36] and how did he create this world he
[2:18:39] created it by faith through faith we
[2:18:43] understand that the worlds were framed
[2:18:46] by the word of god
[2:18:49] so that the things that which which are
[2:18:52] seen were not made of things that do
[2:18:54] appear
[2:18:58] are you with me saints
[2:19:01] god spoke his word and when god spoke
[2:19:03] his word his word could not return unto
[2:19:06] him null and void it had to accomplish
[2:19:09] that which it had been said to do
[2:19:14] so the center a man is not up in the
[2:19:17] skies but the center is in god
[2:19:21] but now that god who had that creative
[2:19:24] power
[2:19:25] he then transfers that power
[2:19:30] and to his own
[2:19:33] the very same power amen that created
[2:19:36] this earth hallelujah god transfers that
[2:19:40] power into his own children
[2:19:44] when you are born in the natural you are
[2:19:46] born with limitations
[2:19:48] but when you receive the second birth
[2:19:50] amen then god gives you another ability
[2:19:54] he plants inside of you another sense
[2:19:58] that is now a supersense
[2:20:01] can you say amen
[2:20:04] a sense that does not consider what the
[2:20:06] eyes are seeing
[2:20:08] a sense that does not consider what the
[2:20:11] body is feeling
[2:20:12] a sense that does not consider what is
[2:20:15] contrary to whatever you are trying to
[2:20:17] do
[2:20:18] when you have that super sense it does
[2:20:20] not matter how impossible a situation
[2:20:23] looks that super sense will speak and it
[2:20:26] will say shut up
[2:20:30] i'm a believer of the word
[2:20:32] and it will put the five senses of the
[2:20:34] body under subjection it is a super
[2:20:38] sense
[2:20:40] when the body begins to feel some excess
[2:20:42] that sense will rise and it will say i
[2:20:45] said shut up
[2:20:47] and the devil says oh you are not
[2:20:48] feeling well then the super saiyan say i
[2:20:51] say shut up
[2:20:53] i feel well
[2:20:55] let the weak say
[2:20:57] i am strong
[2:20:59] let the poor say
[2:21:00] i am rich speak contrary to what the
[2:21:04] eyes are declaring speak contrary to
[2:21:07] what the feelings are declaring speak
[2:21:10] what faith is declaring to you that's a
[2:21:13] supersense
[2:21:16] but i want to ask you sayings have you
[2:21:19] ever really studied the message
[2:21:21] to know what this supersense is
[2:21:24] we know the supersense is faith
[2:21:26] is that right
[2:21:27] but have you ever really studied to know
[2:21:30] what faith is
[2:21:33] that's super sense
[2:21:35] the prophet of god says in the message
[2:21:37] of supersense and the supersense
[2:21:40] is the holy spirit
[2:21:44] wow
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:47] the supersense
[2:21:49] is the holy spirit
[2:21:52] the faith of god
[2:21:54] that dwells in you
[2:21:57] so supersense
[2:21:59] equals
[2:22:01] holy spirit
[2:22:02] holy spirit equals
[2:22:04] god
[2:22:08] [Applause]
[2:22:10] give god some praise right there
[2:22:12] [Applause]
[2:22:16] so the supersense which is faith is the
[2:22:18] holy spirit
[2:22:20] can i take it further
[2:22:23] in the message the supersense he says by
[2:22:25] that same sense god spoke when there was
[2:22:28] nothing
[2:22:29] what is that sense that supersense is
[2:22:32] god
[2:22:34] amen so faith is
[2:22:38] of finish it sense faith is
[2:22:42] then he says the faith of god in you
[2:22:46] the path of god
[2:22:48] that comes into you
[2:22:52] so faith is a part of god
[2:22:58] that comes in you
[2:23:01] oh glory to god
[2:23:03] by that same supersense
[2:23:06] god framed the world together with
[2:23:08] things which was not and did not appear
[2:23:11] he spoke his word and believed his word
[2:23:14] and the world shook into existence glory
[2:23:23] are you with me saints
[2:23:25] so faith is god
[2:23:26] faith is the holy spirit
[2:23:28] faith is that part of god that faith
[2:23:31] that comes inside of a believer
[2:23:35] or we can prove that faith is god
[2:23:38] we can get a little further into the
[2:23:40] scriptures
[2:23:41] and we can see that faith is indeed god
[2:23:45] because when we look at the stature of a
[2:23:46] perfect man the prophet of god came and
[2:23:49] he preached the stature of a perfect man
[2:23:52] and he says unto your faith ed
[2:23:57] but you start with what foundation
[2:24:00] faith
[2:24:01] but faith is
[2:24:03] the holy spirit
[2:24:06] did i just read that
[2:24:07] so faith is
[2:24:09] the holy ghost
[2:24:11] that is why when you read the message
[2:24:13] the stage of a perfect man the prophet
[2:24:15] of god says have faith and be born again
[2:24:22] is that what he says
[2:24:24] so have faith and be born again faith is
[2:24:27] the holy ghost faith is the foundation
[2:24:31] but when you climb high and go to the
[2:24:33] top of the stature of a perfect man then
[2:24:35] you come to life
[2:24:37] beloved let us love one another for love
[2:24:41] is of god and he that loveth is born of
[2:24:44] god but he that loveth not know it not
[2:24:47] god for god is
[2:24:52] faith is
[2:24:54] the holy ghost the holy ghost is god
[2:24:58] god is love so he is the alpha he's the
[2:25:02] omega
[2:25:03] faith is the same
[2:25:07] is
[2:25:08] love
[2:25:10] and it is all god
[2:25:13] can we look at any further
[2:25:16] in the book of hebrews amen chapter 11
[2:25:19] verse number four the bible says by
[2:25:22] faith abel offered unto god a more
[2:25:25] excellent sacrifice than cain
[2:25:29] so we can see that this man as he was
[2:25:31] walking a man he had a faith
[2:25:34] and his faith manifested itself and amen
[2:25:38] he then ended up offering a more
[2:25:40] excellent sacrifice unto god
[2:25:43] but paul does not stop there because
[2:25:45] paul then carries on and he says god
[2:25:48] testifying of his gifts and by it what
[2:25:52] faith
[2:25:53] he being dead
[2:25:55] yet speaketh
[2:25:58] now come on church
[2:26:01] come on church
[2:26:04] this man is dead
[2:26:06] just take me to my diagram
[2:26:09] this man had faith when he was alive but
[2:26:12] when he died
[2:26:14] this was buried
[2:26:15] and when this was buried
[2:26:17] but yet
[2:26:19] through faith
[2:26:20] apple continued to speak
[2:26:24] [Applause]
[2:26:27] where is he speaking from
[2:26:29] in other words the faith was not buried
[2:26:32] with him when he was buried but the
[2:26:34] faith it went with him when the body
[2:26:37] when the ghost left that body the faith
[2:26:40] was here there
[2:26:42] therefore i give you to understand that
[2:26:44] that faith had to be
[2:26:46] zoey it had to be eternal
[2:26:50] it had to be a part of god and you can't
[2:26:53] bear god
[2:26:54] therefore when even when he is dead
[2:26:57] hallelujah he is still speaking amen
[2:27:01] because faith is yet alive
[2:27:04] [Applause]
[2:27:08] praise god
[2:27:10] hallelujah
[2:27:12] glory to god
[2:27:14] it is yet alive
[2:27:18] amen
[2:27:19] so you cannot bury faith
[2:27:21] once you have faith faith is eternal
[2:27:25] faith is that part of god that comes
[2:27:28] inside of you
[2:27:32] can we go a little deeper
[2:27:34] hallelujah
[2:27:36] romans chapter 10 how does faith come
[2:27:39] then
[2:27:40] amen
[2:27:42] romans chapter 10 the bible says so then
[2:27:45] faith cometh by hearing
[2:27:48] and hearing by the word of god
[2:27:57] faith cometh by hearing
[2:27:59] and hearing by the word of god
[2:28:02] now what you are hearing is the word
[2:28:08] but as you hear the word o glory
[2:28:11] there is a mystery that takes place that
[2:28:13] when that word hits you
[2:28:16] then the word when it comes in you it is
[2:28:19] conveyed from being the word and it
[2:28:22] changes form to become faith
[2:28:25] [Applause]
[2:28:30] and the word they've got to be exactly
[2:28:33] the same thing
[2:28:34] as you are sitting here amen what you
[2:28:37] are hearing is the word but when that
[2:28:39] word hits your soul there is a mystery
[2:28:41] that is unfolding there is a change of
[2:28:44] what you are hearing and that is sitting
[2:28:46] in you as faith
[2:28:50] therefore the word and faith must be one
[2:28:56] john chapter 1 verse 1 then he tells me
[2:28:59] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:29:01] word was with god and the word was
[2:29:07] now let's just look at this scripture
[2:29:08] again
[2:29:11] we read it so many times but in the
[2:29:13] beginning was the word and the word was
[2:29:16] with god and the word was
[2:29:19] now is god playing with words here
[2:29:23] god cannot play with words
[2:29:25] but the scripture is saying in the
[2:29:26] beginning was the word and the word was
[2:29:29] with god
[2:29:30] now if i am with this word
[2:29:36] it means at a certain point
[2:29:39] there is an ability with what i have
[2:29:41] with me
[2:29:43] to be able to leave me
[2:29:48] but yet where it goes
[2:29:50] it still remains god
[2:29:54] oh get me right here church
[2:29:57] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:29:59] word was with god why is the word with
[2:30:02] god because it is the ability to live
[2:30:05] god
[2:30:06] but when it leaves god it does not
[2:30:08] change his form it remains god
[2:30:14] and that's why the bible says amen my
[2:30:18] word will not return unto me null and
[2:30:21] void in other words the word is the
[2:30:24] ability to leave god to go and carry out
[2:30:27] a mission
[2:30:28] [Applause]
[2:30:30] and when it goes to carry out the
[2:30:31] mission
[2:30:32] it does not return until it comes with
[2:30:35] an answer mission accomplished
[2:30:38] [Applause]
[2:30:39] and for re to accomplish the mission it
[2:30:42] has to be god
[2:30:43] [Applause]
[2:30:45] oh glory to god in the eyes
[2:30:48] so faith cometh by hearing hearing by
[2:30:51] the word of god now watch what is
[2:30:53] happening here we have got god which is
[2:30:56] the word amen but as the word is being
[2:30:59] preached something is taking place a
[2:31:01] word coming into the soul and as the
[2:31:04] word is coming into the soul word upon
[2:31:06] word word upon word at a certain point
[2:31:10] that word it now comes to live inside of
[2:31:14] you and it becomes a part of you
[2:31:17] [Applause]
[2:31:20] oh glory to god
[2:31:23] oh glory to god
[2:31:24] when god steps into you amen and amen
[2:31:29] now i can begin to preach
[2:31:32] when god steps into you you have now
[2:31:35] found that center praise be to god
[2:31:38] because this is the god that created the
[2:31:40] heavens and the earth this is the god
[2:31:43] that created this earth when that god
[2:31:46] steps into you you have now found that
[2:31:49] center of unlimited capacity of an
[2:31:52] unlimited ability you have now found
[2:31:55] that center that einstein was looking
[2:31:57] for
[2:31:59] and the prophet of god says and the
[2:32:01] power that will raise us up is right in
[2:32:05] us now
[2:32:08] we are now in heavenly places we are now
[2:32:11] in the power of the resurrection and if
[2:32:13] there wasn't a law to that sons and
[2:32:15] daughters of god would create them a
[2:32:18] world out there and go live a private
[2:32:21] life what is the prophet saying here
[2:32:23] he's saying what einstein was looking
[2:32:25] for it is inside those that have the
[2:32:28] baptism of the holy ghost there is
[2:32:30] enough power inside of them to create a
[2:32:33] brand new world and go live in it
[2:32:37] you have the power to do it
[2:32:39] oh let me speak until you believe it you
[2:32:42] have the power to create a brand new
[2:32:44] world
[2:32:45] [Applause]
[2:32:47] and it says if you have got a shadow of
[2:32:49] the power of god in you you've got power
[2:32:51] to do it god is omnipotent see what i
[2:32:54] mean
[2:32:56] the power that's in you will make you
[2:32:59] could speak a world into existence and
[2:33:02] go live on it hallelujah there you are
[2:33:07] what einstein was looking for that
[2:33:09] center that is out somewhere he said it
[2:33:12] is in the skies but i am here to tell
[2:33:14] you tonight it is not in the skies that
[2:33:17] center of unlimited power it is in the
[2:33:20] heart of the sons and daughters of god
[2:33:24] that which einstein was trying to find
[2:33:27] it is not in the skies it is in the
[2:33:30] heart of a true believer you could speak
[2:33:36] a world into existence and go live on it
[2:33:40] there you are
[2:33:41] that's what power is in the church now
[2:33:43] but it is controlled by a law and that
[2:33:45] law is not keeping a bunch of
[2:33:47] commandments it is a law of faith
[2:33:51] oh praise be to god
[2:33:53] when you have that amen when you have
[2:33:56] found that supersense when that god amen
[2:33:59] that portion of god that is called faith
[2:34:02] when it steps inside the heart of a
[2:34:04] believer now you are no longer a natural
[2:34:06] being
[2:34:08] now you are a supernatural being when
[2:34:10] that supersense comes the prophet of god
[2:34:13] says you walk by the sixth sense
[2:34:16] you talk by the sixth sense you live by
[2:34:20] the sixth sense you will die by the
[2:34:22] sixth hands and you will rise by the
[2:34:24] sixth sense that super sense something
[2:34:27] that's in you that's different from
[2:34:30] what's in the natural man
[2:34:32] oh come on church of the living god when
[2:34:34] that supersense steps in the heart of a
[2:34:37] believer when he's inside of you you now
[2:34:40] walk by that supersense you now live by
[2:34:43] that supersense you now talk by that
[2:34:45] supersense you will die by that
[2:34:48] supersense but you will rise by that
[2:34:50] supersense why because you can't bury
[2:34:53] god
[2:34:55] when he steps inside of you you can
[2:34:58] start to believe that all things are
[2:35:00] possible
[2:35:01] not some things but all things are
[2:35:04] possible
[2:35:06] can you say amen
[2:35:08] you can then start to believe that
[2:35:10] anything amen can be accomplished
[2:35:13] and i want to say anything tonight is
[2:35:16] possible
[2:35:18] oh let me repeat that anything tonight
[2:35:21] is possible
[2:35:22] the bible says in hebrews 11 1 now faith
[2:35:26] is the substance of things hoped for the
[2:35:30] evidence of things not seen
[2:35:32] but when you look at it from the
[2:35:34] amplified version
[2:35:36] it then says now faith is the assurance
[2:35:41] title deed confirmation
[2:35:44] oh glory to god
[2:35:46] faith is the title deed
[2:35:49] confirmation
[2:35:50] what is the title deed it is an evidence
[2:35:54] that you own that property
[2:35:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:36:00] when you have faith you have a title
[2:36:02] deed
[2:36:03] now it does not mean that when you have
[2:36:05] the title deed no one is living on your
[2:36:08] property
[2:36:09] there might be squatters there
[2:36:12] but i'm talking about who has the title
[2:36:14] deeds
[2:36:15] i'm not talking about who is staying at
[2:36:17] the house i'm talking about who the
[2:36:20] owner is when you have faith you have
[2:36:23] title deeds
[2:36:25] to that property
[2:36:26] i don't know what your property is
[2:36:28] tonight but i want to say you have title
[2:36:30] deeds to your health
[2:36:32] you have title deeds to your heart's
[2:36:35] desires you have title deeds to your
[2:36:38] children
[2:36:39] you have title deeds to your relatives
[2:36:42] you have title deeds to all that you
[2:36:44] ever need
[2:36:45] now if you have title deeds you have to
[2:36:48] take action and say now i'm serving
[2:36:51] notice
[2:36:52] for those quarters to vacate
[2:36:55] i want to say this evening you get ready
[2:36:58] to serve notice on any squatter that is
[2:37:01] living on what you have titled this for
[2:37:03] it is your right to tell the old man
[2:37:06] satan you don't have a right to live
[2:37:09] here this is my house
[2:37:13] this is my house
[2:37:15] i have a title deed to this place
[2:37:21] and when you cut title deeds you can
[2:37:23] give eviction orders
[2:37:25] and tonight i want you to give eviction
[2:37:27] orders
[2:37:28] oh let's not spare that devil
[2:37:31] you have enough power inside of you to
[2:37:33] create a brand new world i'm not talking
[2:37:36] about you creating a brand new world i'm
[2:37:39] talking about you possessing your
[2:37:41] property
[2:37:42] [Applause]
[2:37:44] satan is gonna let it go
[2:37:47] he's gotta give it up
[2:37:49] why because i have the title deeds
[2:37:54] and then it says divinely guaranteed
[2:38:00] in other words we are not talking about
[2:38:02] if you might get it
[2:38:05] it is divinely
[2:38:07] guaranteed
[2:38:08] we are only talking about when
[2:38:11] not if
[2:38:13] it's just about when
[2:38:15] and when you can decide
[2:38:17] you can decide tonight
[2:38:20] that tonight is the night
[2:38:22] i'm not waiting for tomorrow
[2:38:24] i'm saying tonight
[2:38:26] this is my when
[2:38:28] oh you say it according to the way that
[2:38:32] you believe it
[2:38:34] it is divinely guaranteed
[2:38:36] it is already a given
[2:38:38] it is yours if you desire it can you say
[2:38:42] amen somebody can you say amen somebody
[2:38:46] oh glory to god
[2:38:48] and the evidence of things not seen the
[2:38:51] conviction of their reality faith
[2:38:53] comprehends this fact what cannot be
[2:38:55] experienced by the physical senses
[2:38:59] though you are not experiencing it by
[2:39:01] your physical senses but faith declares
[2:39:03] it that it is possible
[2:39:06] now we can understand luke chapter 17.
[2:39:10] luke chapter 17 says and the lord said
[2:39:14] if you have faith as a grain of a
[2:39:16] mastered
[2:39:17] you might say unto this psychometry be
[2:39:19] thou plugged up by the roots and be thou
[2:39:21] planted in the sea and it should obey
[2:39:24] you
[2:39:27] now watch jesus says if you have faith
[2:39:30] as small as
[2:39:32] a mustard seed
[2:39:34] you can say to this psychomantri
[2:39:37] plugged up by the roots and be planted
[2:39:40] over there
[2:39:41] you can exercise the same ability that
[2:39:44] adam had in the garden of eden but
[2:39:46] though your faith is as small as a
[2:39:49] mustard seed
[2:39:51] why does the bible talk about a faith
[2:39:53] that is small
[2:39:55] and yet achieving big things
[2:39:57] the reason sayings it is because faith
[2:40:01] is a
[2:40:02] part of god
[2:40:04] and there is no weak part of god
[2:40:07] [Music]
[2:40:07] [Applause]
[2:40:09] there is no weak part of god
[2:40:12] if you have the tiny ounce of god
[2:40:15] brother that is enough
[2:40:18] because there is no weak part of god
[2:40:21] can you say amen
[2:40:23] if you have faith as small as a mastered
[2:40:25] seed when that faith praise be to god is
[2:40:28] anchored inside of your heart brother
[2:40:30] sister things begin to change you now
[2:40:33] have the center
[2:40:35] of unlimited power
[2:40:37] the moment god comes into you oh i wish
[2:40:40] somebody can get what i'm saying here
[2:40:43] when that steps inside of you it is
[2:40:46] unlimited what you can achieve
[2:40:49] but that faith cometh by hearing hearing
[2:40:52] by the word as you hear the word
[2:40:54] whatever your soul is led to believe the
[2:40:57] prophet says soul footprints of
[2:41:00] possession
[2:41:03] if your soul is led to believe that this
[2:41:05] is mine you can walk out of this church
[2:41:07] tonight holding that thing
[2:41:10] whatever it is call it your baby and say
[2:41:13] i'm walking out of this place with my
[2:41:15] baby in my hands i'm not walking out of
[2:41:18] this place empty-handed whatever god
[2:41:22] leads your soul to believe
[2:41:24] that he will give it to you
[2:41:26] [Applause]
[2:41:28] amen
[2:41:30] that's why saints when god wanted to
[2:41:32] give us the ultimate weapon by which we
[2:41:35] can destroy satan
[2:41:38] what did he give us he gave us the word
[2:41:42] faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[2:41:45] word because god knew as you hear the
[2:41:47] word the word will convert in you to
[2:41:50] become a faith
[2:41:52] and that is the highest form
[2:41:55] of any weaponry
[2:41:57] that all god ever gave to human beings
[2:42:00] the prophet of god says now what is the
[2:42:02] word of god the word of god is god
[2:42:05] himself
[2:42:06] so god gave the believer himself
[2:42:10] amen
[2:42:13] it's god himself he gave the believer
[2:42:17] himself to attack the enemy by
[2:42:22] oh come on church of the living god
[2:42:24] god gave you himself that you can attack
[2:42:28] the enemy by
[2:42:30] or are you hearing me church
[2:42:32] are you hearing me church
[2:42:34] when the word comes inside of you god
[2:42:37] has given himself to you that you can
[2:42:40] attack the devil
[2:42:42] now that changes the picture
[2:42:44] it is no longer about you
[2:42:46] but it is about who is inside of you
[2:42:49] it is no longer about your height
[2:42:51] it is no longer about your complexion it
[2:42:54] is no longer about your accent it is no
[2:42:56] longer about where you come from it is
[2:42:58] no longer about your background it is no
[2:43:01] longer about how you were born you might
[2:43:03] have been born in timbuktu or whatever
[2:43:05] but brother sister when the word of god
[2:43:08] comes inside of you
[2:43:10] oh
[2:43:12] he that is born of god
[2:43:14] when she is born of god brother sister
[2:43:17] it changes the picture you can now go on
[2:43:20] the offensive you can now begin to say
[2:43:23] i'm not waiting amen for a problem to
[2:43:26] come my way i'm actually going out there
[2:43:29] to look for the problem because i have
[2:43:32] the solution i have god inside of me
[2:43:36] to attack the enemy by
[2:43:39] not to defend
[2:43:42] are you following me church
[2:43:44] many times as christians we are always
[2:43:47] fighting a defensive game
[2:43:49] but the tables have got to change
[2:43:50] tonight
[2:43:52] we are moving from a defensive mode to
[2:43:54] go to an offensive mode
[2:43:56] [Applause]
[2:43:59] when god comes inside of you you will
[2:44:02] start to take the initiative our god is
[2:44:04] not a reactive god
[2:44:06] no no no our god is an offensive god
[2:44:10] he attacks
[2:44:12] when he walked in the garden of eden and
[2:44:14] he saw before it was an eden there was
[2:44:16] chaos and he looked at that chaos and he
[2:44:19] says i am a god that takes initiative
[2:44:22] let there be
[2:44:24] and chaos started to ship
[2:44:27] until he produced the garden of eden
[2:44:29] when you find chaos in your life don't
[2:44:32] wait for somebody to tell you you
[2:44:34] address the chaos that is in your family

[2:44:40] church you address the chaos that is

[2:44:54] you've got god inside of you you step
[2:44:57] onto the offensive
[2:44:59] i look at david amen when david got to
[2:45:02] the battleground david skander and he
[2:45:05] saw a goliath that was busting us and
[2:45:07] everyone was afraid david did not wait
[2:45:10] for this man to come and attack him
[2:45:12] david went and he says what shall be
[2:45:15] done
[2:45:16] unto the men that shall tackle this
[2:45:18] giant
[2:45:21] and they all said oh yeah you will

[2:50:55] you have the thoughts of god that are
[2:50:57] now resident inside the soul of a
[2:50:59] believer or never never underestimate
[2:51:03] this church
[2:51:05] that when you know who is inside of you
[2:51:07] there is no giant that should make you
[2:51:09] afraid there is no situation that should
[2:51:12] make you hopeless there is no
[2:51:14] circumstance that you should say you
[2:51:16] know what i'm giving up on this
[2:51:18] when you have god inside of you it gives
[2:51:21] you options
[2:51:23] you become a jewish being
[2:51:25] because you are still in the body but
[2:51:28] inside of you is the power of heaven
[2:51:31] so when you are a jewel being you have
[2:51:33] an option of how to approach things
[2:51:37] when jesus was here the prophet of god
[2:51:39] says he was a jew well being
[2:51:42] and as a jewel being he had the ability
[2:51:45] to choose
[2:51:47] whether to approach things from a
[2:51:49] physical perspective or to approach
[2:51:52] things from a spiritual perspective
[2:51:55] what do you mean preacher man one day he
[2:51:57] wanted to preach and he had to look for
[2:52:00] a boat because he wanted to go in the
[2:52:02] middle of the water and start to preach
[2:52:04] from there so he borrowed the board
[2:52:07] and he stepped into a borrowed board
[2:52:10] but one day he was left with the
[2:52:12] disciples when he had gone up the
[2:52:14] mountain to pray
[2:52:16] and the sheep had gone away and there
[2:52:18] was no other boat to borrow what did he
[2:52:20] do he says i'm now choosing not to do
[2:52:24] what i did on that day this time around
[2:52:27] i'll step on the water
[2:52:29] and he started walking on the water
[2:52:31] that's what i call a jewel being
[2:52:34] can you say amen
[2:52:36] when jairus came to him jairus said i
[2:52:39] would want you to come and lay hands on
[2:52:41] my daughter
[2:52:44] jesus said aha if you want physical i
[2:52:47] will come
[2:52:49] and he started his journey and he
[2:52:50] started going
[2:52:52] but one day he became a centurion
[2:52:54] oh glory to god
[2:52:56] and the centurion said i don't want you
[2:52:59] to come physically just speak the word
[2:53:02] and my servant will be healed he had an
[2:53:05] option
[2:53:06] can you say amen
[2:53:09] it hallelujah
[2:53:10] he had the option after finishing
[2:53:12] baptizing the eunuch to jump into a car
[2:53:16] and go to the other place but in a
[2:53:18] moment in the twinkling of an eye he
[2:53:20] found himself preaching at the other
[2:53:22] place
[2:53:24] he was late to go to the next meeting
[2:53:26] because he had to preach to this unit
[2:53:28] which was out of the schedule
[2:53:31] but as soon as he finished preaching he
[2:53:33] just disappeared hallelujah and the next
[2:53:36] moment he jumped onto the pulpit and he
[2:53:38] says hey brother how come your clothes
[2:53:40] are wet
[2:53:42] he says oh no i was just baptizing
[2:53:44] someone where were you baptizing this
[2:53:46] person oh i was just in dallas
[2:53:50] now i'm in florida
[2:53:52] are you crazy
[2:53:54] with god all things are possible
[2:53:58] [Applause]
[2:54:00] oh what is it that the devil is trying
[2:54:02] to tell you it is not possible tonight
[2:54:05] i'm here to tell you it is possible
[2:54:08] it is possible
[2:54:10] it is possible
[2:54:12] we have seen far too much of god for us
[2:54:15] to begin to doubt god our god can do all
[2:54:18] things
[2:54:23] when i preached this message at our
[2:54:24] church i preached it in two series the
[2:54:26] first time on part one when i preached
[2:54:28] it
[2:54:29] we just had a testimony of a
[2:54:33] the sister was following our services
[2:54:36] when she was still out of the country
[2:54:39] and she was
[2:54:40] you know in south africa at that time
[2:54:44] and then the doctors diagnosed her of
[2:54:47] having a tumor in the spinal cord
[2:54:52] and they say that this tumor is an
[2:54:54] aggressive tumor
[2:54:56] and they said we need to have an agent
[2:54:58] operation on this tumor
[2:55:00] so they referred to a specialist and
[2:55:02] they say there's only one specialist you
[2:55:04] don't miss disappointment
[2:55:06] so she went to that specialist they did
[2:55:08] all their scans and everything and that
[2:55:10] specially says okay i have seen there is
[2:55:12] a tumor in your spinal cord we need to
[2:55:15] operate on this tumor as quickly as
[2:55:16] possible
[2:55:18] because it is an aggressive tumor
[2:55:20] they made preparations and they go there
[2:55:22] ready to be operated on that tumor
[2:55:25] and then they went to operating on here
[2:55:27] but when they opened it up on the spinal
[2:55:29] cord then they found that that tumor had
[2:55:32] now spread so much
[2:55:34] until they said we cannot do anything
[2:55:37] with it
[2:55:39] because it was on a very delicate place
[2:55:42] so they saw the up
[2:55:45] and they left here to go to palliative
[2:55:47] care
[2:55:48] and they said we can't do anything about
[2:55:50] it
[2:55:51] the sister of that sister is here she's
[2:55:53] right there
[2:56:00] that one called me and she said pastor
[2:56:02] my sister has got so much faith but how
[2:56:05] can god neglect someone with so much
[2:56:07] faith and she was crying
[2:56:10] i said okay let's call another brother
[2:56:12] that prays for the sick
[2:56:14] because i know he has got so many
[2:56:16] testimonies around cancer so we
[2:56:18] contacted that brother
[2:56:20] his name is brother mike modi
[2:56:22] and when he contacted that brother then
[2:56:24] the brother offered prayer over the
[2:56:26] phone
[2:56:30] when the prayer was offered over the
[2:56:32] phone then the doctor said let's take
[2:56:35] this sister back
[2:56:36] to an mri scan
[2:56:38] and let's see what is happening
[2:56:40] they took her back to the scan
[2:56:42] and when she was going through the scan
[2:56:46] the people that carried it because the
[2:56:48] neck had been operated and it would be
[2:56:50] so delicate you can't just move the body
[2:56:52] they have to be so careful how they are
[2:56:55] carrying this body around
[2:56:57] and then they lay there on there and
[2:56:59] then they put it onto the scan they took
[2:57:01] it out
[2:57:02] the doctor said he called and he said
[2:57:04] put it back in
[2:57:06] add some more died
[2:57:08] you know that which makes the tumor to
[2:57:10] show he said ed some more
[2:57:12] they added some more and the men she
[2:57:14] said they she heard them complaining to
[2:57:17] say doesn't this doctor know that this
[2:57:18] is a delicate someone that we are
[2:57:20] holding
[2:57:21] but the doctor said put it back in
[2:57:24] they put it back in
[2:57:26] and they took it out
[2:57:27] and then they took here to your hospital
[2:57:29] to to award
[2:57:31] when they took you to your ward the
[2:57:33] nurses said you are not supposed to move
[2:57:36] you are not supposed to do anything
[2:57:38] because now the next thing is you're
[2:57:39] gonna get a wheelchair
[2:57:42] they ordered a wheelchair for hair
[2:57:44] and then they ordered a wheelchair for
[2:57:45] her this was now gonna be a life
[2:57:49] until she dies
[2:57:51] and it wasn't going to be long after
[2:57:52] that because the tumor was aggressive
[2:57:56] but one morning one nurse walks in
[2:57:59] she found this sister standing up
[2:58:02] brushing her teeth
[2:58:05] and she was in a shock and she said hey
[2:58:07] what are you doing
[2:58:09] and she says i feel strong
[2:58:12] i can stand and i can brush my dis says
[2:58:14] you cannot do that with your neck
[2:58:17] says no but i can
[2:58:22] glory to god
[2:58:24] with god
[2:58:25] all things are possible
[2:58:28] hallelujah

[2:58:37] that you create there
[2:58:39] praise be to god
[2:58:41] oh i like that
[2:58:43] [Applause]
[2:58:45] they took her there
[2:58:49] then when she was waiting amen
[2:58:52] she wondered what had happened
[2:58:56] one morning
[2:58:58] the doctor walks back
[2:59:00] and the doctor walks with a report
[2:59:03] and the doctor starts to read the report
[2:59:05] she the doctor woke her up
[2:59:08] and the doctor said hey
[2:59:09] mrs janna that was the name
[2:59:12] and she woke up and the doctor said i
[2:59:15] have some good news for you
[2:59:17] and they said what's the good news and
[2:59:19] the doctor said
[2:59:21] that tumor
[2:59:22] has disappeared
[2:59:30] i'm talking about a center
[2:59:32] with unlimited power
[2:59:35] that when doctors had failed when the
[2:59:37] doctors had said it is impossible when
[2:59:39] the doctors had said we can't do
[2:59:41] anything about this situation but god
[2:59:45] reaching mercy
[2:59:47] god rich in mercy he operated
[2:59:50] without any medical assistance
[2:59:54] he performed the bloodless operation
[2:59:57] [Applause]
[3:00:01] if you come to our church you will see
[3:00:03] her
[3:00:04] she's walking and she's free
[3:00:07] with an operation that was done
[3:00:10] by a miracle
[3:00:12] you can ask all these people that come
[3:00:14] from our church it's a reality
[3:00:16] all things are possible
[3:00:18] when you have found that faith you have
[3:00:21] found that center with an unlimited
[3:00:23] ability
[3:00:26] about the same time
[3:00:29] the daughter of this very brother called
[3:00:31] brother mike dory
[3:00:33] she she got married and they were
[3:00:35] expecting a baby
[3:00:38] they went to the doctor and they looked
[3:00:39] the doctor did a scan and when they did
[3:00:41] this gun the doctor said oh we have a
[3:00:44] problem
[3:00:46] the baby has got short limbs
[3:00:49] and the baby does not have a nose
[3:00:53] and they gave advice and they said let
[3:00:56] us terminate the pregnancy
[3:00:58] because this child will not survive
[3:01:01] but they said no let's carry on
[3:01:05] they waited and they thought by the time
[3:01:07] we got to the next car something will be
[3:01:08] about right
[3:01:10] they went
[3:01:12] and when they went
[3:01:15] still the baby did not have enough
[3:01:18] weeks went by it got to 38 weeks
[3:01:22] and they did another scan
[3:01:24] and the baby did not have a nose
[3:01:27] they brought the best doctors in uk
[3:01:31] and they started looking at this case
[3:01:33] and they said we are going to be we want
[3:01:35] to see what shall be the end of all this
[3:01:39] and as they were looking at the
[3:01:40] situation they wondered but how can this
[3:01:42] mother say i want to have the child
[3:01:44] anyhow
[3:01:46] one day the sister is listening to the
[3:01:48] message and i'm preaching in the church
[3:01:50] and as i'm preaching in the church i
[3:01:52] take the quotation where brother branham
[3:01:54] had this sister that came with a face
[3:01:56] tower or a hanky over her nose and
[3:01:59] brother branham said oh sister don't cry
[3:02:02] and she said i'm not crying and she
[3:02:04] lifted up the hanky and there was no
[3:02:06] noise
[3:02:09] brother branham prayed for that sister
[3:02:11] and then a few months later the sister
[3:02:13] walks back into church and said brother
[3:02:15] branham do you recognize me and brother
[3:02:17] branham says i don't recognize you and
[3:02:19] she produced the picture when she did
[3:02:21] not have a nose and now she's standing
[3:02:24] there with a brand new nose
[3:02:27] [Applause]
[3:02:30] as the sister was listening to the word
[3:02:32] she jumped up and she said my husband
[3:02:34] did you hear this quotation
[3:02:37] and the faith started getting boosted
[3:02:41] they prayed about the situation and they
[3:02:43] say this will not change
[3:02:46] we are not giving up on this
[3:02:49] they called on the father the father
[3:02:51] prayed and the prayer was there to
[3:02:53] holding 38 weeks the baby is about to be
[3:02:56] born they call for their finals karna
[3:02:59] and then they see the doctors they begin
[3:03:01] to turn they say oh ten this way they
[3:03:04] turn this way turn this way oh the
[3:03:06] doctors are looking surprised on the
[3:03:08] faces and after a little while they
[3:03:11] announced the baby has a nose

[3:03:19] the baby was born

[3:03:23] ass
[3:03:26] our god is still able

[3:03:32] unlimited power
[3:03:34] of glory to god
[3:03:36] oh glory to god

[3:03:40] that same power
[3:03:43] the prophet says that christ hallelujah
[3:03:46] let the fundamentalists let them people
[3:03:48] who deny the power of god say it's wrong
[3:03:51] but that same power that sparked the
[3:03:53] world into existence is in those people
[3:03:56] that's got the holy ghost that's right

[3:29:54] praise the lord we enjoyed the word of
[3:29:56] the lord tonight
[3:30:01] you know i think um
[3:30:02] there was a a quote that brother gwynna
[3:30:05] read
[3:30:06] said when the anointing
[3:30:08] the anointing strikes that's when you
[3:30:10] have to release it you have to speak
[3:30:12] and uh you know even if you don't see it
[3:30:15] some of us can see it immediately
[3:30:18] others it may take time before we see it
[3:30:21] but you have to just remember it was
[3:30:22] underneath that anointing
[3:30:25] that i spoke it
[3:30:27] because i know who lives on the inside
[3:30:28] of me
[3:30:30] the same god that created the the
[3:30:33] universe
[3:30:34] that god lives inside of me and i just
[3:30:36] love that because i was just sitting
[3:30:38] there thinking i said you know the same
[3:30:39] god that said let there be
[3:30:44] you know brother branham told us that
[3:30:45] when he spoke it
[3:30:48] it didn't come immediately
[3:30:51] he said it could have took billions of
[3:30:52] years before it actually came but you
[3:30:54] know what god never doubted one word he
[3:30:56] spoke
[3:30:58] at some point in time that sun was going
[3:31:00] to come
[3:31:01] some important time that moon was going
[3:31:02] to come but god never doubted and you
[3:31:04] can't doubt what you spoke tonight
[3:31:07] i don't care what you go through in your
[3:31:08] body what you go through your situation
[3:31:10] don't you doubt what you spoke tonight
[3:31:13] your god is able to change the situation
[3:31:17] man i'm receiving all that god got for
[3:31:19] me i'm reaping the promises god promised
[3:31:22] me reaping the harvest god promised me
[3:31:24] taking back what the devil stole from me
[3:31:27] and you know when i'm gonna rejoice not
[3:31:29] tomorrow
[3:31:30] i'm not gonna wait till next week
[3:31:32] i'm not waiting to the next meeting but
