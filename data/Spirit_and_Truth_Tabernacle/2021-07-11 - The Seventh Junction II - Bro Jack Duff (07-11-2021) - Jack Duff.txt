him i said oh my say i don't know brother and i appreciate you pressing through and amen and just bringing it out you know and as i was sitting i got rebuked in my thumb uh because you know you're sitting there you're thinking oh brother i don't know if you're going to be able to do that and while the devil giving that thought i said i'm supposed to be praying for him right yes that's just the devil attacking his voice and uh so just pray and you know i'm glad that you pressed through because somebody need to hear the song somebody need to hear the song [Applause] bless it be the name of the lord sometime so kernel right and we got to become spiritual uh understand that there are things happening here everything means something every special means something let gonna say that again every special actually means something you don't just come up here and just sing what you you know just whatever you're thinking you're gonna sing every time you come god has put something in your heart and you present what god put in your heart amen and there's a message in the song to somebody praise god amen i can't i'll share it tonight i mean it's this this morning i got a testimony i need to share but it's it's through a song but somebody got their healing through a song hey hallelujah and oh lord you know saul was bound with spirits until david showed up with a heart right and as he played his heart through a song saul got his healing and you want to know why the devil fight gives because he realizes his kingdom will be tore down if somebody finds their place in christ my god lord help me jesus [Music] [Applause] all right um musicians i appreciate y'all thank y'all so much i'm a i'm a just read a scripture and um and i'll i'll let you be seated um i got all kind of comments that i just want to make but um god is good amen it's so good to be back home we were away on last weekend there in arkansas and the lord used brother smiley greatly amen uh while we were there and um and just um grateful you know just to kind of be alone um and just just watching what the lord was was doing i believe supernaturally god did some things there and brother brother smiley's ministry and then we've gotten a lot of good reports from things that we shared and we're grateful that our ministries could be a help to the people and you know we're just appreciating the lord amen there was a group of believers that had come and they made a statement that they had never seen any african-american believers never you got some here we believe yeah we believe god sent a prophet and uh we follow that prophet you know hallelujah we follow what he said you know so uh but it was it was good you know so good to uh meet some some new saints and you know and uh you know through those meetings there are other opportunities that kind of come so just be prayerful with us that god would just show us a man what he what he wants done his brother um um uh solomon uh mentioned there's many saints that's out today uh up at brother um armstrong's meetings and we want to just keep them in prayer that god would just give them travel and mercies back when they come back and i know some others out for other reasons but uh nonetheless it's good for everybody to be here this morning amen so let's just and i i see sister sanjay so good to see you tim temtem tim tim tim that's tim that's liz she looked like her mama i saw the picture of him the other day in the car and i'm like boy y'all look at y'all looking like i know her daddy told me that he was uh thinking about coming but sorry liz sorry it's good to see tim amen and and just we haven't seen tim in a good while so so good to see him amen praise the lord thank you all for correcting me you get older i start you know amen that's liz all right she's still sister sanjay amen all right uh let's read here in acts chapter two uh certainly good to have the morales family back with us they were away for a little bit and then came back in the enemy attacking their body and as i mentioned uh while i was away i typically when i preach because of the sweating i always take a a changing shirt and t-shirt with me um and after the preaching i always change and i had in my closet that service i i i had my shirt all prepared forgot to take it to church with me and um and that night after i preached the weather changed and uh dropped a little bit and next thing you know the devil had done jumped on me and uh so if y'all see me you know doing a little bit here don't don't worry it's not covet it's not covet and man i promise you that and uh but uh but nonetheless you know we want to persevere and press through um uh this morning so acts two is where we're reading from and starting at verse 14 praise the name of the lord um says but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them the amen up to dee and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be the stone unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as jesus opposed seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel uh and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wanders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come that shall come the past that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord had a blessing to reading of his word let's just bow on a word of prayer father we are grateful for this um privilege we have to read the word and we trust oh god that you would just help us lord to comprehend spiritually what you're speaking to us through your eternal word today i bless every ear that we hear those o god that have come into the house of the lord lord we come with an expectation acts that you would meet each one in their respective expectations and uh god we've felt your anointing through the worship and now lord as we uh as we enter into the word may we feel that same anointing and i want to pray for all the saints of god that are traveling this weekend there in the meetings and brother armstrong's blessed them abundantly the others lord that had other family union activities bless them oh god and just ask that you just ministered to every heart and those that would be joining online uh meet them right where they are may they feel the anointing of the holy ghost right in their room god uh wherever they're listening uh in may they feel the anointing of the holy ghost may you just be glorified and magnified and all that's done today in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated i'm gonna need uh just uh a little detail on this mic sometimes i just need you to mute it for me just all i want to do is just mute it and then uh to set it back up because um hey man i i got a little something a little drainage right so i don't like to blow my nose in the mic just mute it so then everybody ain't a listening to all that you get you get what i'm saying amen hallelujah sometimes you know people can't hear the word because they're just looking at you know man he's he's going through up there i ain't going through amen amen i ain't going through i got victory praise the name of the lord amen so just give me one second here we want to um continue our journey through the seventh junction we started this a few weeks ago and uh want to come back to it when i started this i was mentioning that um it's let's see here i think i might have this um yeah um so i was mentioning i mentioned a quote where brother random say the world is climaxing in a cr in a great drama and um climaxing and a great drama and as we were going through this um the seven junctions brother branham said he saw seven that he could identify in scripture these were things that actually would uh change the course of the world uh different events that happened in the bible that would just really really be significant amen to to where we are right now that's what we mean by by a junction a turn was made uh we can say even god himself kind of made a turn as he began to deal with mankind in particular ways uh but the first one that brother branham identified what would have been noah and the ark and i was sharing with this great drama is as if you were standing there uh looking at a play and uh and then the the curtains open up and when the curtains open up somebody steps out and they start doing some things and the first person that comes out is noah and his ark and you're looking at this and and as you're looking at especially if you look at it from a scripture perspective you knew that there was destruction that occurred in the land right and uh i mean a great flood came because of the sin problem that we had in the earth and there were multiple issues you know and noah's day and and and and and you know one of one of the primary issues is that marriage and divorce marriage and divorce marriage and divorce you can see the stress and everything that was upon marriages and jesus told us that as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and and let me just drop that off amen to to all the marriages you got to stand guard the devil is against your marriage the devil hates your marriage the devil wants to make your marriage another statistic amen another failed marriage that's what satan wants to do so you have to stand guard you have to watch it it's a spirit that is coming against your marriage and the only way you can you can survive it you're gonna have to use the the the strategy of prayer hallelujah i want to tell you this right now it's not enough psychiatrists out there to deal with the marital problems to keep things together but prayer prayer can keep everything together prayer causes you to sacrifice yourself prayer caused you to sacrifice your thoughts and don't always pray that god would change your mate ask god to change you give me strength god amen you brought me together for a reason help me just endure till we get through this right but but that's that's the spirit that was coming against the people in that land uh that day so jesus said it would be it would repeat again today so we see um the the scene closed it looked like the world has been destroyed because of of this great flood but when the scene closes god opens it up again and when when it opens up again we see uh moses and the children of israel coming out on stage and all the great events that happened uh there as moses was the prophet to that second uh junction and and all the great miracles the the the plagues and all that that struck and and death that struck the land and my what uh what a a powerful demonstration of the the the power of god uh here we see the uh the red sea opening up and we know it could be nobody else but god opening water like that hallelujah sometimes we have red seas in our own life and mama can't open it daddy can't open it brother and sister can't open it amen but when god opens that thing up you begin to walk through on dry ground hallelujah amen we thank god for the supernatural that was done there but god wasn't finished yet scene closes and brother brandon say abraham and lock come walking out amen and now we look at this and abraham being the prophet for that generation hallelujah god revealing the secret things to abraham and we are abraham's sea and in this hour god is revealing i can't help that god didn't come to your tent that that ain't got nothing to do with me hallelujah that he didn't come to your tent but he showed up at my tent and since she showed up at my tent i'm gonna do something to satisfy him sarah gets tough ready we got to feed god hallelujah amen we got fellowship with god he gonna reveal secrets to us but there was a great problem in that day and the reason that god was there is to bring two things one was a promise that he made to sarah oh i feel jesus in this place because sarah was barren couldn't have children glory to god but he was there to manifest a promise to sarah i said sarah thy wife will have a child hallelujah and one day sarah moved from a promise to a manifestation one day sarah stepped into a vision and i believe we come to a time where the church has also got to step into the vision sarah was there to receive her promise but also there was a problem going on down in in sodom and gomorrah and god come down with investigating angels of judgment amen to see exactly what was happening before he destroyed the lamb he said uh abraham i want to tell you what i'm about to do now now it's a promise to sarah she get ready to give birth to a promised son but it's destruction to to the people of sodom and gomorrah i want you to think about that we could be on the revival of florida rain a spiritual rain you know what the florida rain is it could be raining on this side and ain't no rain on that side hey it could be raining in this church and ain't no rain in that church we underneath a florida spiritual reign hallelujah glory to god but by here he said now i'm visiting sarah with this promise at the time of life she gotta have the promised son but i'm also going down here to destroy sodom and gomorrah and the reason he was going to destroy him is because of the problem with amen homosexuality this is just bible and what jesus said in his words as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so i i you know we can't sympathize with sin sin is still sin and god gonna judge the world of sin he's gonna judge homosexuals he's gonna judge adulterers he's gonna judge liars he gonna judge sin we don't compromise with liars we don't compromise with adulterers we don't compromise with homosexuals we don't compromise with sin he gonna judge people living together not being married anything else you can think of he gonna judge can we go further but this was the problem of that day so you know here destruction comes solomon gomorrah sin closes but god is not done it's going to open up again the curtain and this time we have elijah and the 450 prophets of baal the children of israel so confused they don't know which god to serve jezebel got them in a real really bad condition actually the reason they are where they are with jezebel's because they fear her this lady ain't got no respect for nobody she killed prophets this lady would kill prophets she i mean she's gonna try to silence every voice she can right but she couldn't get to elijah hallelujah god will hide elijah way and church we don't have to fear anything listen jezebel represented the government we ain't got to fear nothing god will hide this pride away elijah comes and he challenges said now look let the goddamn ass about fire let him be god and here you know he said you know we tired of y'all uh you know you you got bail on this side you got god on this side now let the god answer my father forget this we're going to set this thing once and for all and when god came down and asked about fire elijah himself took care of them false prophets but even after he got rid of all the false prophets jezebel said he won't live by this time tomorrow he won't live by this time tomorrow i i i get him for getting forgetting my prophets elijah took off running hallelujah god met him in a little cave and that still small void spoke to him while he was in the cave hallelujah and there he was given some instructions and and and i loved i loved that because when elijah was found himself in a place of discouragement god thought that was a perfect opportunity to give him an assignment elijah found himself in a place of discouragement but god thought that was a perfect opportunity to give him an assignment so i want i want you to get it when you find yourself in a a good place of discouragement this happened that happened i feel discouraged it's god the tender hand of jehovah that's coming to give you an assignment that's our god oh he's a loving god hallelujah but here you know after this great demonstration of the power of god the scene closes but it opens back up and brother branham tells us the fifth juncture is when jesus christ himself comes walking out and uh my what a junction that was uh uh uh i mean a great junction but not the greatest it was a great junction when jesus came on the scene and and what words can we use to express uh what we feel about our savior what we feel about our lord what we feel about our master oh church it means so much to me you know people say let's just preach jesus every time i'm preaching i'm preaching jesus glory if i'm sharing your testimony it's because jesus gave you the testimony if i share brother branham's testimony it's because jesus gave him the testimony every time i preach i'm preaching jesus oh hallelujah you got to just know where he's working and how he's working amen amen you got to recognize those things but when our lord and savior came uh he he left us thrown in glory to bring to us redemption story i mean there went to a cross and died for our sins and and did not just die but he rose again that's what separates christianity from any other faith the god that we serve he lived in flesh amen and i mean it's a god that would die for us who wouldn't want to serve a god like this hallelujah right so so so christianity amen received his birth when jesus comes on the scene blessed be the name of the lord but but but after he died and after he rose again you would think that would be the climax but it wasn't because the curtains are closed amen and out amen now when the curtains reopen we go to the sixth junction and here comes martin luther and john wesley with with messages of of justification and sanctification it shook the world it changed the way that we uh we thought about how we lived as christians we thank god for these ministries that god used and and one day they they they message came to an end they went off the scene the curtain closed and we get to the same junction now the curtain opens and who do we see well i can tell you who i see glory glory i see you i see me i i see the prophet i see us all on the stage at this time glory in everything that's going on in your life amen is already acting out what god had in his mind hey can i tell you something you are not a mistake you're not making a mistake didn't brother gene tell y'all last week all things are working together for good i thought it was just a beautiful confirmation when brother brother gene was talking about david and he was talking about the prodigal son exactly the same thing i was preaching in arkansas that was the supernatural god vindicating his presence here so it's not a mistake church all things are working together for good your sickness is an opportunity for god to get some glory your way with son and wave with daughters an opportunity for god to get some glory the story about the prodigal son would have never been written had the man never went away and come back home we needed to get encouragement from that story that's why god allowed that thing to happen everything that's happening in your life it has a purpose brother brother brother troy when he's preaching on on uh the tender hand of jehovah he starts sharing a testimony and how god delivered him from some things but you know what he would if he had not gone through those things he would have never been able to speak to them guys the way he spoke to him in the back back there that was no mistake and he i just love how cool calm and collective he was collected he was i mean he said just kind of walk parked his truck in in the middle of him let him know he's there and they knew it so they started talking to him a little bit and then they they just kind of he wasn't going to say nothing but now when you open up the door i'ma push the door down and he start coming in and start sharing his testimony see now i i don't have the same testimony so it wouldn't have been effective but but he was able to just go right where they were and a seed was planted and when you really think about it you're not even supposed to be next to a church even doing that but i got what we call the holy ghost police that'll go after you a seed was planned i don't think the young man would ever be the same again see god uses your what you think is your failures god uses it for his glory all right they say god will take your mess and make a message out of it all right so here we are we're on the scene this seven junction is the greatest of all junctions amen this junction is uh considered the second coming of the lord uh i've mentioned to you all that at every junction of time god sends forth prophets angels and he gives a warning and we know the prophet that came in this junction was william marion branham he was the prophet uh you know uh he says god always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous we've been talking about this throughout all uh the sermons on the junction and i'm just going to read just a couple things here and um and then i'm i'm going to just kind of slip into something if i can oh i forgot to set my timer uh give me a second here um and i i i i know i've been up here for a little bit but y'all just bear with me i want to go this quote out of junction of time paragraph e4 praise the lord how long y'all say i've been up here about about 15 minutes amen i appreciate all these christians that's telling the truth and the house of god i love you all i love you all so much i'm gonna tell ain't no church like spirit and truth tabernacles i really appreciate amen this fellowship uh but here the prophet says my subject this morning if we should call it such would be the message to the church the junction of time it says that always in the days gone by the dispensations has always come to their end and we hit a junction there's junctions on that oh that's not where i want to be i'll ke i'll read it while i'm there there's junction on the highways the junction on the roads that we travel in this world they junction on this grand old highway that we travel to glory and always it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence now you know let me just inject there really quick um i i mentioned god gave us this thing at the very beginning of the year and uh and and i in the church we had we had a merge of two churches amen and i thought it was very appropriate for the holy spirit to just kind of settle us on this thought at the beginning of the year because all all both churches went through a junction amen and you know we were warned amen by a dream that be careful what decision you make at the junction oh hallelujah i got to go back into all this if y'all don't mind amen we're warm by a dream be careful what decision you make at the junction because all of us are here at a junction this hap this is more spiritual than you realize not just somebody just coming to a fault right hey man you know uh it took a harley davidson to to generate this you understand what i'm saying that the church in okeechobee still be gone had the building not been bought 20 something years right that was the hand of god that did that oh my and and i'm convinced that it was god right because i'm watching even you know i i just take that down just for a second i'm trying to get get to something here but i i can't get in there but but i'm convinced that it was god because amen in this junction miraculous things are supposed to happen and i've been watching amen brother smiley who's the who's the pastor of the church i'm watching some of the miraculous things that happened in his life supernatural i mean we've been friends for a long time brother-in-law for years and and i ain't never seen some of these things happen what is going on here my brother see i'm talking about the supernatural god on the scene we got to pray for uh i'm going to call her uh sister grieves not just my bad i'ma give her a respectful name sister grieves glory to god we went to pray for her four brothers four different cars right up to the house on father's day and we just want to pray because we heard she wasn't able to get out to get out of the house for a year so we gonna pray for her that god will raise her up and i share what i say i know i know uh uh at 75 years old you know maybe we would think that god has a limit on what age you can be to get healed but god don't set no age limit on healing if a 90 year old woman can have a baby then a 75 year old woman can get up and walk praise god that's the god that we serve while we went to pray for her you know we're just sitting there praying and our brother brother kraku have just come back from sharing some some powerful testimonies of what happened in mexico i said brother let's go with these testimonies let's anoint our faith and then let's anoint it with oil let's pray we went out there and we prayed and and brother troy said let's take brother smiley too i said okay he said he said he said my mom she really liked him she really really appreciated him i said okay let's take him brother smiley go out there he just alone for the ride that's all just alone it was not planned it was not it was not uh uh conjured up we just went to pray and while we praying a rumbling began to happen and we started noticing that what's going on here and brother smiley just just start speaking in tongues right there now now i'm like now after it was done i said brother i know you had the gift to talk to i don't i i ain't no i had it either supernatural things happen at the junction while we're in arkansas brother smiley was preaching and um while he's preaching and just being himself nothing nothing you know just the same brother smiley we know but while he's there a vision begins to show begin to be shown to him while he's preaching if the vision was so vivid that he said i can't i can't not i can't do nothing with this he turned and just gave the mic to the past he kind of stepped away from the vision but the pastors say oh before you gave me that mic you had already called out the exact situation that a man had come to my house everything the man said you said it back to him in the pulpit and it was the only time that brother had come to church that night after a whole year that night brother brother brother brother smiling picked up the whole conversation and preached it out and and all they could look at they say oh this is the hand of god the supernatural god is on the scene you know we you know i'm talking about this let me let me let me come back let me come back here because i got i got some more to share uh let me go back to this quote let me just kind of finish this so the prophet say um always takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence omnipotence is all-powerful and it takes a miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that teaching of the word is a very fine thing it says and it comes faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous now you know i i've been i've been reading this just about every time i preach on this junction because i i can go through each and every junction show the miraculous that's happened in everybody's ministry but if you're on the stage i got to be able to show them a rock that's happening with you if he's the same yesterday today and forever i got to be able to show him happening in you so i'm gonna just do that right i was gonna take some time and go through brother branham and and and his ministry and everything like that but y'all already know that i'm preaching to believers believers glory to god we know god used this prophet but let me just try to pick up amen a little thought here oh jesus jesus jesus my god all right um there was a statement made by the prophet i i when i preached on the on the fifth junction i talked about the 39 miracles of jesus but i didn't go through all 39 miracles but i want to just show something amen and brother branham's ministry here uh the token if we'll go to that message the token just bear with me amen i got some things i want to share got to go back pick up some things got to come forward put it all together if we can but let's just look at something that the prophet said here 39 miracles that i said about jesus but here in the message to token the prophet said now being in that we become part of the word being in that we we not me but we us we're on the scene now we become part of the words and then take the token the spirit over the promise i am the lord that healeth thee says now get ready for the healing service tonight see take that token hang it over the word on your unmovable faith in the word amen and and and he'll get out it says uh now um you say that that's the thing that puts him out cause in him there is no such wish i could testify a little bit now to some things i've seen happen just in the last few weeks i'm gonna testify but i'm just setting you up with a quote wish i could testify amen a little bit now to some things i've seen happen just in the last few weeks see oh what i could testify of you know and luke said if all jesus done will be put in books there wasn't enough books in the world to write them just what i've seen in my own ministry seeing him done you couldn't pile the volumes on this platform here if i wrote it in details what i seen him do just in my own ministry seeing him do it now one brother brandon doing it was christ doing it amen he said seen him do it he had more success in my ministry than he did in his home now i remember i said yeah i'm talking about 39 miracles of jesus but brother branham say he had more success in my ministry a man that can yield himself to god god had more success in his ministry than he did in his home now now i i don't want to leave it at the prophet i want to bring it to you because you're on the stage god will have more success in your ministry than he did with his own if you could just heal yourself the works that i do say you do also that's his word that's a promise from jesus hallelujah we in the word church all right he says now remember he had more success now not me he had glory it says hallelujah he had more success in jeffersonville than he did in nazareth he did it in that wicked city and this wicked city amen glory because he could perform no miracles there but he did here he finally broke through here i want that to be our testimony he finally broke through here i mean i've been trying to get certain things to to churches for years amen but he's finally trying to find a place that he can break through and the fullness of his glory can be poured out i want that to be our testimony that he finally broke through here everything is in order the way the prophet said it's supposed to be oh glory to god glory to god glory to god amen he finally broke through here i say yes lord yes he got it done here amen he might have to have to get people somewhere else but he got it done anyhow so he had more success right here than he did uh than he did um uh in capernaum or nazareth and that how he done more miracles right here in this tabernacle than he did in the in the entire ministry on earth that's right he did it now what about the rest of the world glory oh my now that's what he done now remember he done it never said i done it amen no because i didn't do it i just didn't i just loved him and just submitted myself to him and said what he said and the holy spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said and then then he done the work that's all if he can get all of us believing it what would he do right now if he can get all of us believing it right now right not just believing it but believing it right amen there wouldn't be a feeble person around the town that's right if he could get everybody to believe it it'll all be over see hold your token over your unmovable faith in his promised word satan will go i read that quote and we had a prayer line amen a few weeks ago and and uh and and i just believe god moved in that uh in a very very special way but i wanted to just try to go back and just kind of share because this you know to me uh when we're reading acts 2 i was i was just always struck by brother branham choosing that scripture to preach the junctions why would he read acts 2 what was the purpose of reading acts 2 and i just couldn't i couldn't i couldn't understand it as a minister you know you try to follow certain things when another preacher is preaching you try to follow his thoughts saying now why did he pick up that scripture for that because the minister looking look is looking for inspiration off that same scripture maybe he can preach a sermon from it right so when i when i saw brother branham pick up acts 2 and start preaching from that about the drunks of time say well where did he get that from but i think what he was trying to emphasize was the supernatural that's supposed to happen at the junctions and here if we are in the seventh junction then we should see the supernatural now what did the what did the scripture say let's go back in this just look at that amen acts 2 verse 16. uh peter had to just kind of straighten him up on a little bit he says this is this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel so joel 2 actually speaks to these things joel prophesied and now they're they're actually in the midst of a manifestation of what joel prophesied and if i if i could just borrow those words again we are also in the midst of a manifestation of what joel prophesied it says look it says verse 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old man shall dream dreams now uh again this is the scripture that brother branham is using to talk about the seven junctions and i say lord now now now there's got to be something to this and then as i start putting it all together as we're preaching this by faith now the promise is that god gonna pry out his spirit now i can't do nothing but just read what his promise said i can't make the spirit come you can't make the spirit come it's god himself doing it whenever he wants to do it but i know what to expect because this is a promise oh hallelujah now you know uh i read this and when i preached on the second junction we had a number of dreams i believe there were roughly five dreams uh that that come out of it and and i don't i don't have time to go back in and hit all of them today but i'll tell you go back to the second junction you'll be able to get it all but the one i did want to bring out is the brother said that he had a dream stated there about 15 saints from the church assembled but not at our specific church says as the saints were fellowshipping he noticed one of the sisters was standing in line and she had a bump she was expecting and now the brother told me who the sister was in his dream and i called her sister and i told her you know uh uh what was what was shared but i didn't tell the church not that's not everybody's business that's that's that's between them right and and i think that's the way we should handle things right glory to god but but i believe and as i was sharing this with just some other brothers our brother troy specific it's just it's not that that's uh only a physical dream for that that one sister this has spiritual significance if the sister has a bump that means she's pregnant and she's expecting something and on the spiritual side a woman in a dream always represent the church the church is expecting what is the church expecting the supernatural hallelujah and i'm going to tell you something when when when a woman reaches a final stage and that baby's ready to come then one thing that mother can do to stop that baby from coming out when that baby is ready to enter into this world it's going to go through all kind of pace in order to get here but that baby's got to come out she better get to the hospital fast because the baby is determined to come out hallelujah and i'm here to tell you you can't stop the supernatural you can't close up the supernatural it's time for the supernatural to be born in this church and i believe it's here at the seventh junction oh hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory god was showing us these things in dreams letting us know where we were what to be expecting uh you know and i already told you all about i had a dream about us that brother brother brother clinton came there and gave me the key say pastor's all done the church is finished we got the church and i told him the dream he said pastor had the same dream three to three days ago i say oh my number the confirmation old men shall dream dreams i can't help but that's what the bible say i'm not in the young people group no more hallelujah i passed 50. amen old men shall dream dreams and that's exactly what happened here brother smiley had a dream and his dream was that i'll show you how to get over that vertigo and you know the manifestation of the dream where it occurred when we went to arkansas because usually when he fly that thing comes back on him but when we went to arkansas no problems at all supernatural gods [Applause] oh i'm gonna let brother smiley close the service because i think it's some other things he can share but uh i'm just showing you some other supernatural things that is that that's that's that's that's happened during this journey like i said i could go talk about brother brandon but i want to talk about us in the midst of this journey when we got to the fifth junction i preached three-part series on the fifth junction the second part i uh preached um and i introduced something that happened on march 30th in our church we had our first terry service and in that terror service amen march 30th we had uh three manifestations of tongues and then four interpretations in that terror service hallelujah and through the interpretations what we got was yield and i will speak my glory is here you are no longer bound you are free in jesus name it is done what i say i will do this is my word to you that's for our church it was all this happened during the junctions i want y'all to understand this during the series of the junctions we never even had a terror service before i asked somebody say brother uh could you tell me all the churches you know i went to a number of churches have you been to any church where they've done this say not one church have we ever done it i said well wow this is something new and and what i what i'm what i'm saying is that brother branham said he finally got a group that he's got it all together and they now i'm here and they pray i got them doing exactly the way that i want them to do it the way that the scriptures say for them to do it now i finally got now i can do more in their midst than they ever imagined if we would just learn to heal we come back amen here june 29th our secondary service hallelujah and notice the first terror service came as part of the fifth junction which was a great junction but the second service secondary service came in the midst of the seventh junction and both represent the first coming of the lord and the second coming of the lord fifth junction first coming of the lord second seventh junction is the second coming of the lord watch this and this become a man and and what we got this time was two manifestations of tongues and one interpretation now as we were you know we we had uh uh uh brother branham said you gotta have brothers that are spiritual that we're discerning that can judge and when we got the brothers together just kind of talk about you know what they felt the lord was saying and men say yeah this is of god this is of god and just sound like the the two manifestations of tongues was just two different languages saying the same thing so that's why there's only one interpretation i want to tell you something else we will not box god in when we come here and we say god you've got to do it this way god can do whatever he want to do when we come all we want to do is yield but this message that we got this time says i am that i am i am i am your provider i have given you everything that you need i am that i am ask and seek and i will give i am that i am i am that i am now i thought about that and i'm going to tell you now i'm just i'm going to be honest with you i want to be honest but i want to be careful and being honest because the devil hallelujah can use sometimes these things against you i knew that that i am that i am when it says uh i uh ask and seek and i will give i knew that that connected to scripture and there was a scripture that uh brother brother simba came up and read to us at prayer say ask seek knock hallelujah ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and the door will be open i say now now here brother simmer gave us that scripture i took that scripture to arkansas and the people were blessed by it right ask seek not i also took that scripture for myself and i told y'all i told y'all that there was a meeting taking place about a building that we want to get well that sunday that i told y'all the meeting didn't take place but the meeting did take place after this prophecy i'll give you results later ass seek knock and he told us that i've given you everything that you need so i'm rotting this i'm riding this prophecy while we were going through this series another sister sent a testimony we had a wednesday night service and on that wednesday night service i started going through a quote where brother branham say somebody's going to get healed tonight y'all remember that and we ended up having a prayer line here at the church on wednesday night and uh while before we had the prayer line uh i felt led just to pray for the people that were streaming there was a sister streaming in tennessee and she sent her testimony and she said uh since at the end of the service brother jack was moved to pray for us that was streaming online god's power started moving on me uh something very warm started in my stomach and i could feel the pain lift him as he just calmly prayed i thank god for your obedience to the holy ghost i just felt like i could go no further but god jehovah rapha came in in my sick room he's an on-time god every time a very present help god is always concerned for his people i give all the praise and glory to almighty god glory hallelujah i'm healed this is my praise report precious sister vicky she got her healing while she was listening online that happened on i got that testimony on april 18th go to arkansas and come back and it's a testimony in the mailbox june 26 this was written see the supernatural got to happen at the junction so this says greetings pastor jack and the saints a spirit and truth tabernacle i greet you in a name that is above every name the lord jesus christ i'm so grateful to see the lord is keeping you all and moving us all forward in his kingdom through the preaching and believing of the word says 2020 revealed itself to be a very trying year for my family our 15 year old son was diagnosed with kidney cancer after a series of tests i don't want the devil to get in in the middle of this says our 15-year-old son was diagnosed with a kidney cancer after a series of tests i had to surrender this to the lord it was more than i can bear god gave me peace in this storm now you know i'm liking this because we had some saints here had to go through some procedures during this time and god still heals through medicine god can use whatever method he want to use to bring healing so if he has to go through medicine it's fine don't don't don't don't brother brandon had to rebuke somebody one time because they didn't want to go to the doctor say no don't do that god can use the doctor to be a help to you amen hallelujah all right look now it says um uh she said i i can i i had to surrender this to the lord it was more than i can bear god gave me peace in the storm of coveting cancer through christ i wrote a prayer request to you all during the prayer line the visiting pastor prayed and i put it on put it on a speaker so it could permeate the atmosphere our son has since had surgery and completed radiation and chemotherapy right as scary as this was a 15 year old boy as scary as this was uh i had to trust that god loves him even more than we do and would take good care of him and he did glory to god there were also several elements that i was dealing with one of which was a nasal uh uh granuloma now let me um before i go further this um let's just stop and praise god for bringing this young man through chemotherapy and radiation only god could touch his body to bring him through that a 15 year old boy oh hallelujah god did that for that young man now he had to go through the radiation you had to go through the chemotherapy that's okay god can use that for his glory oh hallelujah and i just want to show you see god got different strategies the way he brings healing watch watch the rest of this now she says uh and now she stopped when she said um when she made the comments says god loves him even more than we do and would take good care of him and he did right she says uh glory to god that was a praise right there now she's moving on to another thought there was there were also several ailments that i was dealing with one of which was a nasal uh granuloma this growth in my nasal cavity blocked my airway causing sinus headaches and sleep apnea i had prayed and asked god to heal it but i but i was growing weary because uh that had been over a year i finally saw a doctor while my son was still going through treatment he told me he would surgically remove it so i could have relief and proceeded to schedule the removal all right says a few weeks later i ended up canceling the surgery because i felt i should have wait i should wait until my son was finished uh finished uh finished up and then i would reschedule one sunday evening i was outside on the back patio listening to your service from earlier that morning while sweeping up a bit now i want y'all to get this because as i read this i want to say to our sound engineers what you do is important to our singers when you prepare a song to come here and sing it's important to the musicians getting ready it's important to brother solomon creating an atmosphere it's important i appreciate each and every one one of y'all for what y'all doing when the ministers come it's important we don't realize who's depending on what happens here at spirit and truth we don't realize that and when you when you when you're not able to go to church and you want to get plugged in somewhere you want to get somewhere where there's a norton floor not just an anointing in that church but an anointing that can come through the line listen at this since i was outside on the back patio listening to your service from early that morning while sweeping up a bit a young sister and i mean let me also say after we finished the service brother simba go home and he put all the the artwork with it and then they get it released out there to youtube brother we appreciate it amen we appreciate it because there's other people waiting on that listen says i'll listen to your service from earlier that morning while sweeping up a bit a young sister sang a special that said your goodness is running after me y'all remember that song y'all remember the anointing that came on that song where sister charisse was singing it your goodness is running after me now the lady got a clog i mean something in her in her nose there clogging things up and the doctor want to take it out hallelujah and she just listening to the anointing of the song oh i feel jesus says a young sister sang a special that says your goodness is running after me i was rejoicing and singing along you that are online don't just sit and look but enter in oh i feel jesus you know there's a i'ma just stop here y'all just y'all bear with me i'm i'm still preaching but the brother told me a little statement amen while we were there in in arkansas it says there was a preacher come up to him and say brother i don't know why i'm just falling asleep in church tonight i don't know why i fell asleep like that i'm sorry they say brother do you fall asleep when you preach and say no i don't fall asleep when i'm preaching say well you shouldn't fall asleep when somebody else preaches say well it's just a little different he said no no it's nothing different he says because the reason you don't fall asleep while you're preaching is because you're participating he said and if you would just participate when somebody else is preaching then you won't fall asleep so when you come to church participate don't spectate participate [Applause] even at home participate glory to god so this sister start participating she heard the song she started singing a song right along uh at our house hey glory to god look at this amen says i was rejoicing and sing along the dust from the sweeping i was just sweeping and i got into the spirit i was just cleaning up right and i would just i was just just just doing this but i heard that song your goodness is running after me and i just start singing say but the dust from the sweeping caused me to sneeze twice i went inside to blow my nose and i saw something that looked like a big red bean it scared me until i realized i could breathe hey hey hey glory the supernatural at the chuck shot you are on the stage praise god can you see that sister blowing her nose and that red bean coming out [Applause] she was healed praise god without surgery god uses different strategies her son went through chemotherapy but she went to a sneeze in the same family god is moving [Applause] [Music] [Applause] glory to god amen i know where we're standing church i know where we're standing she says it scared me until i realized i could breathe hallelujah i went back to the doctor and told him i think i sneezed it out and you know what the doctor did the same thing y'all just did laughed he thought it was comical now that y'all didn't think it was comical you this just why why why is the doctor laughing you don't believe what we believe right it says he thought it was comical he proceeded to examine me looked in both nostrils before saying it's gone [Applause] i'm going back to this statement that was made in the first terror service you know you're no longer bound you're free in jesus name it is done the doctor tell her it is gone and notice what it says this now he says uh uh it's gone you don't need surgery she said i asked him is this coming he said i've never seen that happen if you ain't never seen it happen and it's not common it's a hallelujah it's a miracle the miraculous will occur at the junction he says i was uh he says it's gone you don't need surgery i asked him is this common he said i've never seen it happen i was wearing my cross necklace and held it out and said i'm counting this as a miracle i heard the nurse say that must have been some sneeze i said no it was some miracle give the glory to god says it was a great position in my case and my sons whether it was by medicine or miracle and i say amen says i believe that that's the message we believe hallelujah says my son whether it's by medicine or a miracle god's goodness was running after us glory be to god and she said i'm enclosing an offering to go towards your building fun stay in your postal duty saints brick by brick god bless [Applause] her name is sister sarah amen and and i i was just blessed by her testimony supernatural god moving supernatural ways um i want to give room for one more testimony today i wanted to do this uh because we're on the stage we are here at the seventh junction we're looking at ourselves and every part of our life is a part of what god wants to express through us for this time it's one thing to look back in the scripture one thing to look back at what happened in brother branham's mystery but it's another thing to look at what's happening right here amongst you right now people are being healed set free delivered supernatural things are happening right here in our midst early this week i got a text from brother frankie and some things that he was going through and he asked for prayer and uh and we prayed and the lord did some something there for him i said brother franken he was sharing some other things with me i said brother frankie i i'd love for you to be able to share this in church on sunday and um it'll just go right along with my sermon he says pastor pray for me that i can be there in church on sunday i'm not feeling but pray for me because i want to be there and it come this morning preston's way and it's here and i want brother frankie to share his testimony praise the lord let's take this mic right here [Applause] god bless you um so i'll i'll start with um yeah i'll start with my my dad first um as you know you know my family was here um i believe three weeks ago and they weren't just here to visit um my family in fact wants to move out here um and they we're from arizona and they moved to arkansas my dad you know kind of wanted to semi-retire moved to arkansas and keep doing what he was doing and you know just kind of be financially free and so they did that built a house well not everything worked out the way that they wanted it to work out and fell into hard times and you know but the lord still took care of them in that and um talking to my mom she had kind of hinted around it you know maybe we'll move to florida and told my dad like why don't ask frankie see if he can get you a job out there which i had you know no doubt in my mind that i could do that with whoever i was working for [Music] so the people that i work for now which me working there is a testimony of itself because i never applied to this place they found my resume online and they gave me a call and offered me the best job that i've ever had [Music] [Applause] and so one day the manager comes up to me and starts questioning me about my dad and uh just you know your dad's a mechanic and whatnot and he asked me a couple questions like you know he's a good mechanic you know i told him hey you know he trained he's better than me so uh he he walked away and i had called my wife and was like hey he's asking about my dad i wonder why um and she's like well you should have told him you know hey if you guys look for somebody you know you can hire him and he come back out and ask a couple other things i'm like why are you asking you know what do you why do you want to know about my dad um you know you guys looking to hire somebody and he goes where i was looking and he kind of he used the analogy like a baseball team if there's an all-star out there you know you tried to get the all-star and get him in here i was like okay and uh he uh he kind of he walked away and then he comes right back well he he's a he smoked so he was out on a smoke break and he walked away to finish the smoke break he was walking back to me and he goes terry daddy's got a job out here and i'll pay him the same exact money as i'll pay you and so he he leaves which that in of itself is insane because you know not to you know like boast or anything but i am paid at the highest payment of my trade which is unheard of um so i called my father i told him that and you know right away he's you know he's like yeah like i would like to do that so when he came out here he talked to him and before he moves out here he wanted to go back home to arizona and visit his family and while he was back there you know he was worried because the guy that he works for now in arkansas had been planning this big expansion with his business i'm gonna add bays and we're gonna take over and including my father and all this and so he was distraught like i'm gonna leave this guy hanging in this guy's planning a future with me being there with him so in arizona you know he was thinking about that the whole time and finally he goes back to goes back to arkansas and he um he was out grabbing parts for a side job that he was doing and he goes in the parts store and the guy's like hey um good so the guy who works for his name is frank uh he goes hey frank's closing his business down and he's like what and he's like yeah so he went back talked to me like what's going on with your business he's like i'm done i'm i'm done working on people's cars i'm closing my business this is it like i'm i'm no longer in business so my dad didn't have to tell him anything again yeah with freedom freedom from all that so my dad's got a job out here and uh he didn't have to worry about leaving this guy hanging with anything and my father will actually be out here this [Music] friday so the second thing that i wanted to share is my own personal thing that happened to me this week so last sunday i woke up and it's feeling kind of achy and i had some pain in my lower back and i don't know i guess this might just be me but if i start getting sick i won't tell nobody until it's too late you know uh so i don't want to tell my wife anything she's worried she'll freak out and quarantine me even even before covet it was she would have haunted me uh so uh i didn't want to say anything and after a while it was i'm feeling you know bad enough that i was like i'm not gonna go to church because you know i don't know what i'm coming down with um so sitting home finally you know complaining a little bit aching and and so she's like you're getting sick i was like yeah i think i think i'm getting sick so um you know we started doing our own little things and and just tried to remedy it um and so it i mean it's a little personal but it started to to burn when i went to the bathroom and um anything anything of it and i didn't think they were related and then that night i had woke up in even more pain started burning a fever come into monday in the morning i pumped myself full of medicine told myself i'm fine but it was still too sick enough to go to work until monday i started to burn a fever and i believe i believe it was a monday that i did text you so i text brother jack on monday and i told him you know everything else was going on and by that point like i started to bleed as i was going to the restroom and fever got worse i got up to 101 and that's when i i text brother jack and i text my family as well and and um so obviously you know when something when you're at that point you know you're in a little bit of a panic and brother jack i text brother jack and i you know i just expect him to you know just kind of remember me in prayer i didn't i actually didn't expect him to call me um and so he called me and and when he called me i told my wife you know brother jackson called me to pray for me and she came in the room she actually knelt down um by the bed as he prayed and and so he prayed for me and then i shared the testimony of my father but as soon as i hung up the phone then she looks at me and she's like i believe that you're healed i believe i'm healed too my fever maintained for about 20 minutes after that and then just dropped off and um i um i went the restroom and i started go to the bathroom and you know halfway going to the bathroom the blood stopped and [Applause] it's been like it's been you know good since and i still had a little bit of pain enough to keep me out of work um i went on went to work on thursday but you know i was 100 and um being that i don't have insurance yet through my work because they're still working on it obviously i didn't want to go to the doctor or go to the hospital or pay hospital bills um so on on friday morning uh my wife was like why don't you just go online and find like a like an online doctor that you can pay a couple dollars for and and you know talk to him see like get your prescription so i go online i just googled something real quick and found an app and filled it out and just answered a questionnaire and the doctor contacted me and was like oh yeah you know it sounds like you have an infection and here's some medicine for it and sit between the 20 cost talk to the doctor and 16 obviously it's significantly less than even if i had insurance so you know god even took care of me in that with no insurance and you know he gave me exactly what i had made of and healed my body so god bless you all [Applause] um as brother frankie was sharing his testimony i could just see the play just playing out right in front of me and brother frankie walks up to take the mic and begins to share his testimony right supernatural things that are happening right here in our midst oh i just thank god church and and i'm on the expectation for so much more right i mean sister gina he didn't tell me that part but since jesus said declare after the prayer i believe you're healed god does what he wants to do when he wants to do it oh hallelujah let me just finish amen by reading your quote here from god has a provided way should be the last uh quote on the second page there and um this has been some journey through these junctions hallelujah hallelujah says now we're moving right on into another great age coming for the rapture of the church and in this we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts and that's what brother branham say we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts and uh and i just i'm i'm grateful that in in this season god has begun to use the gifts the way that he wants to use them in our midst uh no one trying to make themselves do anything um it's just a very unique way that i've just been watching god and and i know he got so much more i want to tell you no matter what your gift is uh everybody got something that god has given them if you would just yield it to the lord don't don't give it to the devil give it to god right let let god use whatever god is giving you just yield that to the lord and watch god i i've already proven everything is important here your son your singing is important the sister didn't get healed through while i was preaching the sister got healed from the anointing that came from a song the anointing calls her to sneeze no don't don't don't think that strange remember there was a little boy in the bible the prophet laid on top of that boy and the boy sneezed seven times and it came back to life right we in the bible with these things and if i'm not mistaken that was elisha right is that right elisha not elijah elisha you know who elijah represent elisha represents the pride come on church it says we're living in the time of the restoration of the gifts i was i was i was sitting there um watching sister dixon my brother brother frankie was testifying it just it just felt like sister dixon probably get ready to get up and run a little bit i tell you i say boy just something going on in this place i i feel god in here amen oh my ah [Music] all right sis don't you let me if i finish this i'ma let you testify i'ma let you testify right after i finish this amen yeah i think god is moving i i i really believe that i really believe that my jesus my jesus um let me let me just say this real quick before i go there while we were there in in um arkansas there was a brother tim hayden was after he finished preaching he had a prayer line and there was a sister coming through the prayer line and brother tim before he prayed for he just backed up and he looked and said sister the lord told me to tell you that he's already told you what to do you just need to be obedient to what he told you to do uh i don't know what that mean but you just need to be obediences and he went ahead and prayed for and sent on through the line one of the brothers say he walked to brother tim said did you know that sister he said no i don't know her from nobody i don't know he says uh do you know what you told her so yeah god told her he already done told her what what what she need to do she just need to be obedient so do you know what her testimony is no it said a few years ago that sister and her husband had laid some fleeces before god about whether to move to this church or not whether they should be in this church or not and they asked god to do three things for them well god did all three things that they asked for and they still say it wasn't the will of god for them to move so they went back to wherever they were and within a year two years the husband died gone just like that suddenly young man gone has no idea what happened to him well after this happened the sister still prayed lord do you really want me to move and go to that church come to the prayer line in the church and been told i already told you what to do just be obedient see the angel lord is still here and he's still speaking to people that was just too precise and i don't and i shared that because i don't know what god might have told somebody in here but you need to be obedient to what god spoke amen amen when i go to a church like that and see something like that happen in the prayer line i say you know what we don't know what happened up in here we don't know come to church with your life clean the days of ananias and sapphira are back actually never left they're still here so be careful church amen all right let me finish reading this it says um the rapture church in this we're living in the time of the restoration of gifts it stumbled many of the big fine churches it sent nazarene backwards it made fanatics out of a lot of the pen a lot of the a lot of pentecost but just as saying god's moving right on bringing in the rapture and faith for his church that's right so tonight i represent that faith brother branham's ministry represented that faith and we are contending for that faith i represent that faith the faith that was once delivered to the saints in the way of a divine gift which to my opinion gifts and calling is not my opinion but the bible says that gifts and calls are without repentance there's nothing you can do about it you can't make yourself with blue eyes when you got brown you're just what you are by the grace of god now we know um not naturally you can't but people doing all kind of stuff to themselves nine days amen but if god gave you a certain colors because he wanted you to have that color amen you can't even come to god without god calling you first you can't seek god without god seeking you first and calling you no man can come to me except my father draws him so god is seeking and god is set in the church i am grateful for our journey through these seven junctions and uh and i'm happy to see uh god is still moving the way that he moved in every junction he's moving the same right now our god is an awesome god our god is a mighty god hallelujah amen let's bow in a word of prayer father we're so grateful for what we see you doing in our midst thank you for your anointing that destroys yoks thank you for the changes that are taking place in our lives lord and uh we know that it's nothing but you as the prophet said you did more in his ministry than you did in your own and he realized it wasn't him doing anything it was you doing it all father we have um so much that we see uh here at this time sometimes we we see things we take them for granted but oh god we don't want to miss what the holy spirit is doing in this hour help us lord to be sensitive and in tune and with a life full of expectation god that you would get glory and honor uh in our generation as you have gotten it in others lord we want you to be glorified we want you to be magnified we want you to be exalted we love you father and we just praise you for all that you're doing for your people it's in jesus name we pray amen amen amen praise the lord um brother smiley i'm gonna have you come and close us out amen on today and and uh we want to give just a little time for sister dixon just to kind of share um testimony you know that testimony i shared with the sister her son going through chemotherapy and radiation got used in that means to bring a miracle and she i love the way she put it the balance in it because she said whether it's through medicine or through a miracle it's still god right at the beginning of this this this series uh we watched sister wayson was going through a little something in her body but we saw the supernatural god just touch her and i mean she would she could barely walk and and and everything like that but one day i was coming to prayer and her desire was to get back to get back to a point where she can walk into the house of god for prayer services so i saw walking across the parking lot so fast to get the prayer say praise god a miracle right in our midst right uh we watch god bring sister capers through amen it's just tremendous surgery that she went through the best patient that the doctor ever seen hallelujah and and by being there though some of those young nurses got a chance to see how a husband's supposed to treat his wife they were they were they were coming from other floors to see the capers right i mean just a tremendous testimony of what god was doing watch god watch over sister birds amen take us through a procedure huh we we we've been seeing god just manifest himself amen it's the supernatural god moving in the seventh junction oh i love him i love them i love them i love them praise god brother smiley why don't you come and hey man y'all give us a little song and amen and then we'll we'll give sister dixon amen just a little time to share uh here this morning as well [Music] amen that's a good one [Music] amen jehovah is your name [Music] is [Applause] [Music] great [Applause] [Music] your name one more time your name [Music] jehovah [Music] [Applause] [Music] great and bad is your name [Applause] amen let's get a lot of hand to praise this morning hey man amen i i thank me and brother jack kind of got the same thing i i kind of had a hearing congestion uh myself um also i just like for y'all to be in prayer for some old friends of mine uh one of the older older brother passed away and uh we did the uh eulogy on yesterday and boy i tell you what we had a good time hey man we had a real good time and we just kind of uh laid some things in there and uh i know a lot of the older older guys that knew me when i was a little boy you know because that group they they're a little bit older than me i think when they graduated i was probably from high school the uh uh bo he was graduating high school i was in the fifth grade and um we we were there my wife and my son nathan and we were just there to be uh servants you know because that's what what christianity is all about being being served servants and just god gave me a little thought and and we expressed it and even i was i was walking to my i was walking to my car after everything was over and i could hear some of the older guys who've known me since uh like i say i was a little kid they was like really smiling boy that young man i tell you that young man preached this than the other i just i didn't turn around i just kept going to my car you know i said uh lord lord i thank you that you you you allowed me to be in this position so that we can express jesus christ because that's that's really what is what it's all about how many just appreciated brother jack this morning oh my when i when i came in brother troy say boy bro jack stirred up back there well i can see i could see why um can i can i read y'all just one thing um and then i assistant there she goes i'll tell you what i'll let her test testify and then uh i'll uh give sister dixon to mike and we'll share a quote and we'll get out of here god bless you soon i'm thankful for more than one thing but that how this worked out i had one of my teeth to fall out in the front and i'm so embarrassed [Laughter] and my siblings that makes it happen for me i'm already nervous and it's a long testimony but i'm going to make it show and i promise i'm not going into all detail but the main part i wanted to share was you know when i was out for so long over a year um i was suffering with congested heart failure and afib and i had so much fluid build up in my body until it was i was on my way out of here and i knew it within myself and uh when my cardiologist find out how bad it were my daughter chantery who's the physician she was there with me she always liked to go to my appointment now and in a way he when he did test that day and he saw how bad it were and he told her about the research doctors that they have here now not too long ago a few years ago chantery said about three years ago they started here in west palm beach with the uh they put when you have that when anyway the right side of my heart the doors were so badly damaged until the fluid was building up in my body couldn't pump the blood and fluid through my body and i had so much fluid in me until i just the least little walking to from a different room the bathroom i'm so short of breath and it was uh it was just getting worse and now they put me in this research program and uh in chantal they explained to me what they was going to do and i had to qualify for it but i had so much fluid in my body until i didn't qualify they first had me in there and then i had to go to so many get so many tests done and at one point they said no you we got to drain that fluid out of your body and uh can everybody hear me okay they had to drain that fluid out of some more fluid i had been in the hospital a month so before that when my cardiologist was drawing drawing fluid out of my body but he didn't didn't nearly get it all but anyway they had to put me back in now they had to stop the research program and i had to go back into the hospital and they really drained it out then and so they put me back in there i qualified then for the research and i started to get nervous about it i'm like a researcher i'm like you don't know about that and i started praying about it and i said well lord i know who i belong to i know that you are and you real and you are with me you're in me and i say well and i know another thing when the devil cannot take me out of here until you get ready to call me and so that gave me some consolation but i still was a little nervous to tell the truth and uh so my daughter so coming up close to time uh chanter i asked her about it what you know exactly do they do and she put on a big screen tv which i have from a safari i mean my uh you know the fish thing the aquarium but anyway she showed it on the tv that what was going on in my body and uh and uh that helped me a lot and it was like like and she's describing so like when i uh you know like when we have a gas problem and the cars is like coming a storm coming or something happened with the gas the cars make long line miles long you know and she said that's what's happening in your body your fluid backing up and it just like just like that and i'm like and that that didn't sound good and so but anyway when they put me back in the hospital and drew that fluid really drew the fluid out of my body the fluid and uh and then i went on from there you know they started making preparation to you know put me in the hospital to do the triclips i think they call it they had to go in from the right side they had to go quite a few times to take pictures within my groin right groin and then down my throat taking pictures of checking out their right side where they was going to put the clips in it and uh which was a real chore uh so anyway coming on to the day they did the procedure you know just leaving out some parts to making sure uh when i was coming after they had finished which it took a little longer than they had anticipated and uh you know sometimes because i've heard some of the doctors when they do a procedure or something they that makes a recording of it and because i've heard them quite a few times and uh i come out i was waking up coming from under the anesthesia just in time to hear the last part of that recording he was making and uh when i first heard him i'm thinking to myself wait no i didn't hear all of that but i did hear that last part that last word he said and he uh so at first i didn't know how to put this but anyway he had to try six times i suppose to get to that seventh time i said it had to have been one two three four five six and then seven but he said i heard the doctor say that seven times it worked that seventh time it worked and i got i thought a long time about that i'm like oh my goodness so he was trying to put the clubs in the two triclips or whatever they call it in for six times apparently and uh it didn't work i heard that loud and clear but that seventh time it started started working and the more and then i'm thinking and i think seven junction he was today and i like he said i didn't realize myself i know i was about to lose but i know inside something was going on and uh i'm like oh my god and none of them nobody knew i were you know living here because i know i couldn't live like that the way i was feeling was just you know it was just you know about to you know but then i prayed about it and got to think and i said satan you cannot take me until god get ready for me and that give me some consolation and then but by the research thing that was still a question in my mind but god is good and so i knew he was in this so i won't say i'm living on borrowed time god intervened i'm a miracle and the miracles i wrote truly i can truly say i have experienced a miracle at this seven junction god bless you appreciate that testimony amen um i i tell you what uh me and brother jack we had um some wonderful wonderful wonderful uh services um in arkansas we just really saw the hand of god and um you know i was i was the lead man and god gave me a little inspiration in the services and i was telling them i'm just kind of laying the foundation because before anything can really happen if you're building anything and you're doing anything you got to have a foundation and uh god really really used us in a real special way i'll just just maybe share this one little thing uh a couple of things i i really believe that uh we we we're right where god wants us to be at i i really believe that being here has really been a blessing for me um i'm uh starting to kind of get back to my old old old self i'm starting to i'm starting to uh i was telling brother burleigh and say i think at one point i was starting to get a little callous and uh now i'm getting back to the place where you know i can be in church and feel the spirit and uh i weep you know it's hard to give me a mic because they don't tell them i'm not gonna cry in a minute that was my old self you feel the presence of god but i had started getting callous but now i mean i cried up a storm up in arkansas boohoo like a baby but uh um on that thursday night um i was ministering and uh god was really really you talking about discerning and just speaking direct to people and after every service they're like brother you don't even have a clue i said well i i don't have to have a clue the people who god speaking to they got to know that is god and he said man you was the pastor was like he couldn't even move i said i've been there too he said man you were saying things so direct he said i know the people was thinking man brother dave told brother he said but he didn't he didn't have to i've seen god use me for 20 some years but um and i had called them musicians up to uh come i was trying to quit and they would just steady pulling and i just kind of remember myself um uh moving to to my left and when i got to my left it just seemed like the room got brighter and i seem like i was kind of elevated a little bit it kind i told brother jack i said it kind of scared me i said it kind of scared me because like i said you know i i ministered i've ministered i've been preaching for almost 28 years and uh i don't feel like i'm an overly um spiritual guy tongue these things is just happening it's not something that i'm trying to make any these just things that's happened i think it's been because of uh brother jack's being inspired and and just and i'll read this and i'm gonna get out of here we let us go uh but as i as i i got to that plate like i say it scared me and i i said a few things and and and the brothers they was like whoa this is this is something special but it kind of scared me to a place where i i kind of turned and i i gave brother dave to mike i said man here take this thing uh out by hand but i i i thank god for for using us in a special way and i feel like god is is doing great great great thing um this this is a quote that the first quote i used up that i i think i read it here it means more to me today because it's we're on the seventh junction and and it says give me a church this out of the junction time uh give me a church ready visualize to see signs and to see the omnipotent god and the great power of god moving amongst the people you give us a church like that i tell you what where you could just visualize things happen visualize your really see i ain't gonna preach but i i might feel good just really like i was saying uh the sunday before just visualize like like with with sister rachel see yourself holding the baby see yourself changing the you got you if we as a church visualize ourselves with these things what a what a what a what a what uh what a what a winner what a water what a water i know y'all y'all giving me that y'all give me that quick brother smile we ready go home eat some chicken but i'm gonna let you go then amen i tell

them they don't they on fire man spanish folk mexico i've gotten invitations to go to different places in africa so y'all just prayed it um because you know i realize it's not about us you know we're not going to try to project ourselves but we just going to really really be a blessing to god's people amen let us bow our heads and the brothers um get ready to dismiss but we are preaching let's give brother jack another hand this morning amen we we thank god for his leadership and you know i i thank god for him because he makes traveling for me easy he he really does he take he takes care of

you just continue to keep him in prayer gracious father we just thank you this morning lord um for the service you know it might be the ending of a series of sermons um but lord god i think we're

supernatural uh take place amongst us you know i'm i'm grateful to be here for such a time as this to be a partaker of what you're doing in this hour oh god and uh just being a part of this ministry
