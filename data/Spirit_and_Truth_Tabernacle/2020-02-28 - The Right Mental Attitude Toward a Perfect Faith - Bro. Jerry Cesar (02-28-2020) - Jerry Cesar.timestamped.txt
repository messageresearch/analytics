[20:33] we thank you Lord and we commit all
[20:35] things into you tonight father in Jesus
[20:37] Christ and we pray amen god bless you
[20:41] church I trust that everybody had a
[20:45] prospering day it's been a it's been
[20:51] quite the day for me but uh I think the
[20:55] Lord anyhow he allowed me to make it
[20:58] here tonight and he allowed us all to
[21:00] making it tonight
[21:01] which means you got a plan and he's got
[21:03] a purpose now I won't take too much time
[21:08] I would like to turn to a verse here
[21:12] Genesis chapter 22 and we'll start at
[21:17] the first verse so we reads and it came
[21:28] to pass after these things that God did
[21:32] tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham
[21:35] and he said Behold Here I am and he said
[21:40] take now thy taking out our son thy only
[21:44] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[21:47] into the land of Moria and offer him
[21:52] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[21:54] the mountains which I will tell the
[21:56] other and Abraham rose up early in the
[21:59] morning and saddled his ass and took two
[22:02] of his young men with him and Isaac his
[22:05] son and clave the wood off for the burnt
[22:09] offering and rose up and went unto the
[22:11] place of which God had told him then on
[22:14] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[22:16] and saw the place afar off and Abraham
[22:21] said unto his young man
[22:23] abide here abide ye here with the ass
[22:26] and I in the lad will go yonder and
[22:30] worship and come again to you I just
[22:35] want to stop there you see he said and I
[22:42] and the lad will go yonder and worship
[22:47] and come again unto you you see Abraham
[22:53] knew not only that he was coming back
[22:57] but his attitude was that he was going
[23:01] to worship he goes on to say and Abraham
[23:06] took the wood of the burnt offering and
[23:09] laid it on pond Isaac his son and he
[23:12] took the fire in his hand and a knife
[23:15] and they went both of them together and
[23:18] Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and
[23:21] said My father he said Here I am my son
[23:26] and he said Behold a fire and a wood but
[23:30] where is the lamb for a burnt offering
[23:32] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[23:36] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[23:40] they both so they so went both of them
[23:43] together I also want to read a scripture
[23:46] in James chapter 2 verse 22 it reads
[23:53] seest thou how faith fraught with his
[23:58] works and by works was faith made
[24:01] perfect
[24:03] may the Lord a blessing to his reading
[24:07] now if I couldn't you guys may have your
[24:10] seats thank you if I could use as a
[24:13] title the Lord inspired me just place
[24:18] this in my heart it would be the right
[24:20] mental attitude towards a perfect faith
[24:24] now I believe is going to take a perfect
[24:29] faith for a perfect rapture
[24:32] and just going through the story of
[24:35] Abraham what I really like here is that
[24:39] Abraham had a big trial after 25 years
[24:42] of a promise son he was put to a final
[24:46] test and God didn't give him a test
[24:50] without knowing the result God gave them
[24:53] a test knowing that Abraham was going to
[24:56] overcome but Abraham had to realize
[24:59] himself that he was an overcomer and
[25:03] Abraham's attitude towards this test was
[25:08] quite remarkable and to me Abraham's
[25:11] faith was bigger than his trial right
[25:14] the reason why Abraham's faith could
[25:17] stand bigger than the trial was because
[25:19] his faith was in the big of God you see
[25:22] ever hams attitude has hit the right his
[25:26] the fact that he had the right mental
[25:28] attitude allowed God to show him that in
[25:33] every situation every trust in God God
[25:36] will always make a way now faith asks no
[25:41] question right when when Abraham was
[25:44] asked by God
[25:46] to go in and take his only son Isaac
[25:50] Abraham's response was his reaction the
[25:56] scripture says he rose up early in the
[25:58] morning right and he sat at his ass and
[26:02] took two of his young man and with him
[26:05] and Isaac his son and cleaved the wood
[26:07] for a burnt offering now Abraham didn't
[26:09] waste any time he rose up early in the
[26:12] morning and he saw first God's command
[26:16] and not only does faith ask no questions
[26:20] but faith moves faith moves and expects
[26:24] God faith moves the doubt out the way
[26:27] faith moves the sickness out the way
[26:29] faith moves that the feet out of the way
[26:32] faith moved on but
[26:34] out of the way and it expects God the
[26:37] the objective of faith is expecting God
[26:40] to come down seen the objective of faith
[26:43] is knowing that God has already
[26:45] completed the work now I like what the
[26:52] Prophet says here he says in the message
[26:56] the sin of unbelief
[26:59] 19:58 zero 5:17 he says and there's only
[27:05] two spirits that control a man there's
[27:08] that's either it's faith or unbelief
[27:11] when you catch Christ in the heart no
[27:14] symptoms bother you from then on no
[27:16] matter what takes place you still call
[27:19] God's Word the truth and when a person
[27:22] finds that place in Christ that faith
[27:25] that says by His stripes I'm healed
[27:28] there could not be enough doctors in the
[27:30] world tell you he was fixing to die no
[27:33] matter what your symptoms are you
[27:35] believe in anyhow he says faith is
[27:38] positive faith needs no booster faith
[27:41] knows what it's talking about faith is
[27:44] strong faith has hairs on his chest
[27:47] it speaks and the rest of them shut up
[27:50] symptoms can't even speak at all when
[27:52] real godly faith speaks it's got the
[27:55] floor I know where it's at it's had an
[27:58] experience but you know there's
[28:00] something about faith doesn't know any
[28:02] fear and faith is calling you you don't
[28:05] consider any fear any doubt you just go
[28:08] on God is calling you and I like this
[28:11] how the Prophet put this because when
[28:15] when when faith is standing before God's
[28:18] Word something's bound to have to us
[28:21] right because God's Word as a seed is
[28:24] supposed to produce after its own kind
[28:27] and if God says that by His stripes we
[28:31] are healed out of the out of our own
[28:33] confession God is bound to move right
[28:37] because a God honors faith now with
[28:41] faith it has its associated with the
[28:43] right mental attitude right because you
[28:46] can
[28:46] you can misrepresent hope with faith now
[28:50] there's a difference between having hope
[28:52] and faith when you have faith you use
[28:54] the Bible says faith is the substance of
[28:56] things hoped for the evidence of things
[28:59] not seen
[28:59] so with faith is the fact that though
[29:02] what you're believing for is already
[29:04] accomplished what you're believing for
[29:06] is already done if you if you're wanting
[29:09] something from God it's the very fact
[29:12] that what you're wanting from God you
[29:13] already have it right now
[29:16] a perfect a perfect way to put this is
[29:18] the Bible says everything was crew
[29:20] everything we see was created by things
[29:22] not seen
[29:23] but it was by faith that the world was
[29:25] created right and the reason why we can
[29:29] believe that is because by faith and
[29:33] it's the same faith that can allow us to
[29:35] believe in something we don't have now
[29:38] the right mental attitude I'm gonna take
[29:43] this out of the message the hour is come
[29:47] the Prophet says the right mental
[29:50] attitude all you along here do you
[29:52] understand what I mean when I say the
[29:55] right mental attitude you right meant
[29:58] your right mental attitude towards God's
[30:01] divine promises will bring any promise
[30:04] to pass now maybe you don't believe that
[30:07] you say well my faith is weak
[30:09] I wouldn't confess it see don't let the
[30:13] devil know that always say I've got good
[30:17] faith I believe God with all my heart
[30:19] now that's something you see though
[30:22] that's the right mental attitude even
[30:25] though your faith is weak what's coming
[30:27] out of your mouth even though your faith
[30:29] is weak what is your actions like even
[30:32] if your faith is weak what kind of
[30:34] atmosphere are you setting because the
[30:36] right mental attitude has everything to
[30:39] do with God with with with with the
[30:42] result of the situation that you're in
[30:45] so God honors faith and and in faith
[30:49] though it's to believe but you're right
[30:52] mental attitude about it will bring the
[30:54] word to pass and the Prophet says he
[30:58] said
[30:58] if if you don't have if your faith this
[31:01] week he says I wouldn't confess it don't
[31:03] let the devil know I always say I've got
[31:06] good faith I believe God with all my
[31:07] heart don't testify nothing of the devil
[31:11] and when you accept them as your healer
[31:13] don't never act like you're sick or
[31:15] crippled anymore believe that you're
[31:17] healed take him at his word then it's
[31:21] all over it's all then it's all over on
[31:23] God then and it's not on you as long as
[31:26] you take God at His Word then the word
[31:28] will produce what it promised to do is
[31:31] that right now you have faith to believe
[31:33] him with all your heart and while
[31:37] reading this it kind of strike me it
[31:40] kind of strike me because there's so
[31:43] many things that that that can take up
[31:46] our attention whether it's we whether
[31:49] it's just things that we are listening
[31:52] to or things that we're watching and
[31:54] just just this little thought just came
[31:57] to me and it was it's time to put the
[32:00] world on mute you see it's trying to put
[32:04] the world on mute and and put the word
[32:06] on live because when the once you put
[32:08] something on mute it's characterized by
[32:12] spite by absence of sound something you
[32:14] don't even see something you're only
[32:15] here and I was reminded of what on what
[32:19] the Prophet went to a store and they
[32:21] were playing music and he was so in tune
[32:24] in such a channel he didn't even hear
[32:27] what was being played right so what
[32:29] would that be said I want to say put
[32:32] your symptoms on mute if you have a
[32:34] sickness put that on mute if you have a
[32:37] trial going on right now put that on
[32:39] mute and turn the word on turn the word
[32:42] on and turn your attention to God's
[32:44] promises right put your defeat on you
[32:47] and walk in the victory that God has
[32:49] promised to you and I want to continue
[32:53] to say here the Prophet goes on the same
[32:57] message the sin of unbelief no I'm sorry
[33:03] I just read that I want to turn the
[33:06] attention to another story here
[33:10] it's in Daniel chapter 3 starting at the
[33:16] 15th verse want to read about story of
[33:21] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[33:23] it says here starting at the 15th verse
[33:28] now if you be ready that at what time
[33:32] you hear the sound of the cornet flute
[33:34] harp sackbut psaltery or the dulcimer
[33:38] and all kinds of music you thought you
[33:41] fall down and worship the image which I
[33:44] might have well but if you worship not
[33:48] ye shall be cast the same hour into the
[33:52] midst of a burning fiery furnace and who
[33:55] is that God that shall deliver you out
[33:57] of my hands
[33:58] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[34:01] and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we
[34:06] are not careful to answer thee in this
[34:08] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[34:12] is able to deliver us from the burning
[34:14] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[34:18] of that hand O king but if not be it
[34:22] known unto thee O king that we will not
[34:25] serve that gods not nor worship the
[34:28] golden image which thou hast set up now
[34:32] anybody want to tell the devil be it
[34:34] known unto thee now I like this because
[34:41] many times the devil comes in different
[34:45] ways
[34:46] and if you're not careful you'll find
[34:50] yourself subjecting to the devil without
[34:52] even knowing it
[34:53] right and sometimes it's all a matter of
[34:58] fear doubt right maybe worried right
[35:03] worrying is subjecting yourself to the
[35:06] enemy's trap and if we're not careful
[35:10] we'll put God's promises to the side and
[35:12] say I'll just come back to it later when
[35:15] really in the way that that that
[35:18] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego right they
[35:20] had in the
[35:21] surance not only an assurance but a
[35:24] decision a decision that if God didn't
[35:27] show what they knew that they would find
[35:30] more pleasures with God than the
[35:32] pleasures of anything that would conquer
[35:34] would be contrary to God and I'm gonna
[35:38] continue reading here it says but but if
[35:42] not be it known unto thee O king that we
[35:45] will serve we were served that we were
[35:47] not served by God's nor worship the
[35:49] golden image which thou has set up then
[35:52] was never Knesset full of furry and the
[35:55] form of his visit was changed against
[35:58] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[36:01] therefore he spake and commanded that
[36:04] they should heat the furnace one seven
[36:06] times more then it would then it was
[36:09] wont to be heated and he commanded the
[36:12] most mighty man that were in his army to
[36:16] bind Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and
[36:19] to cast him into the burning fiery
[36:21] furnace and that didn't that servant the
[36:26] fact that the fire was heated seven
[36:28] times more was was nothing why because
[36:33] it was a God that that had already
[36:36] placed something greater in Shadrach
[36:38] Meshach and Abednego right the scripture
[36:40] says greater is He that is in you than
[36:43] he that is in the world and I and and
[36:45] the prophet said something imagine the
[36:49] devil trying to burn a holy ghost out of
[36:51] a man that's just not possible
[36:53] why because the Holy Ghost itself is
[36:56] what burns a man within right it's what
[36:59] burns our desperation it's what burns
[37:01] within us the joy the salvation and I
[37:06] want to continue here and the 23rd verse
[37:11] I'll pick up it says now after they the
[37:17] the three Hebrew boy the Shadrach
[37:19] Meshach and Abednego after they went
[37:22] into the fiery furnace the scripture
[37:26] says that never kanessa the king was
[37:29] astonished and rose up in haste and
[37:33] spake and said unto the
[37:35] counselors did not we cast three men
[37:37] bound until the midst of the fire they
[37:40] answered and said unto the king trullo
[37:43] King he answered and said lo I see four
[37:46] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[37:49] and they have no hurt and the form of
[37:53] the fourth is like the Son of God you
[37:56] see it goes on to say then
[37:59] Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of
[38:02] the burning fiery furnace and spake and
[38:04] said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego ye
[38:06] servants of the Most High come forth and
[38:09] come hither then Shadrach Meshach and
[38:12] Abednego came forth of the myths of the
[38:14] fire and the princes governors and
[38:17] captains and the Kings counselors being
[38:20] gathered together saw these men upon
[38:22] whose bodies the counselors the fire had
[38:26] no power nor was in hair of their heads
[38:28] singe neither will their cloaks change
[38:32] nor the smell of fire had passed on them
[38:36] now they they went through all of this
[38:40] and yet they were not affected not even
[38:44] a little bit and I can say this much
[38:47] that the their faith and God allowed
[38:53] them to overcome the symptoms or their
[38:58] faith in God allowed them to see beyond
[39:01] the fire right because at the point of
[39:05] death you realize that death is only a
[39:07] vehicle and oftentimes death is what
[39:11] what comes with many fear before us
[39:14] wince wind when it's sickness death is
[39:18] right there standing out the door right
[39:20] and when you see death and you're face
[39:23] to face with death you realize that
[39:25] there's only a vehicle death is only
[39:27] what draws you closer to God why because
[39:31] we also have to die to ourselves and the
[39:35] Prophet says and our and the message the
[39:39] hour has come he says now that's what
[39:43] the devil tries to do all the time
[39:46] burn you up on something
[39:48] makes you sicker when you're praised for
[39:50] make you think you've lost your
[39:52] experience with God he's lying to you
[39:54] the time comes when you have to stand on
[39:57] God's Word stand alone but when that
[40:00] time comes stand there
[40:02] there's got to be a time when you've got
[40:05] to separate yourself between your
[40:07] feelings and your faith that's the time
[40:09] it is tonight
[40:11] and I believe Shadrach Meshach and
[40:15] Abednego had to separate their feelings
[40:18] base with their faith right because
[40:20] their faith was connected to God
[40:23] now we don't serve God out of feelings
[40:25] we serve God by faith why because we
[40:28] can't please God
[40:29] outside of faith and the time also came
[40:33] not only for them to separate their
[40:35] feelings in their faith but they had to
[40:37] seal their faith and theirs they sealed
[40:40] they were able to seal their faith with
[40:42] their testimony and that's what happens
[40:44] you seal your faith with the testimony
[40:47] and God comes immediately and he's the
[40:50] one that seals it now
[40:53] I want to continue here the Prophet says
[40:57] he says could you imagine burning the
[41:02] Holy Ghost out of a man can't be done
[41:04] notice I can't I can see the king
[41:08] himself upon a throne the hour time came
[41:12] they bound these Hebrew children book
[41:15] them in the front of the spear and
[41:17] started walking up a platform that they
[41:20] were to fall into a great furnace
[41:23] I can hear Shadrach say to me Shaq say
[41:26] you sure you pray through sometimes when
[41:29] Satan puts the heat on we have to stop
[41:31] and check up Lord do I truly believe you
[41:35] I hear Shadrach say yes it's all prayed
[41:38] up now
[41:39] the guards say you want to take that
[41:41] back boy there were a time of decision
[41:45] he says no willing to seal our testimony
[41:48] with our own life we're ready now
[41:50] I can hear King never kissed King
[41:53] Nebuchadnezzar say
[41:54] now if you'll bow down to this image
[41:57] I'll take it back
[41:58] no we've took our way what the Lord
[42:01] despised phew
[42:02] I'm going through with it the time was
[42:04] for decisions just a few minutes left I
[42:07] can hear him say alright walk them up
[42:09] now that heat began to get a little bad
[42:12] don't worry if you accept him tonight as
[42:15] your healer saying we'll put the heat on
[42:17] tomorrow don't you worry about that
[42:20] now I'm gonna say the same thing the
[42:23] very minute that we take the stand for
[42:27] God's Word that he turns up the very
[42:31] minute we take a step towards God
[42:32] promises the he turns up and when the
[42:36] heat turns up it's like whenever
[42:39] whenever that whatever the devil is set
[42:42] loose God always sets his angels Luc's
[42:45] whenever all hell is set loose all
[42:47] heaven is set loose and many times when
[42:52] we take that stand of faith to
[42:57] acknowledge God in the midst of the
[42:58] trial God Himself becomes that fourth
[43:03] man in the midst of our trial he becomes
[43:06] the very son of God in our very trial
[43:18] profit goes on to say here he says I see
[43:30] coming to his right hand a great angel
[43:33] his name Gabriel great at great
[43:36] Archangel he comes running he comes
[43:40] running up pulls his swore he said
[43:42] master you have looked down at babbling
[43:45] your peoples taking a stand for you down
[43:48] there the hour has come for them to
[43:50] stand and they're taking a stand but
[43:53] that bunch of people there is going to
[43:55] push them into the fiery furnace let me
[43:58] go down there I'll clean that thing up I
[44:00] believe he could have done it yes sir he
[44:03] said he will give his angels charge over
[44:05] those and I believe the angels of God
[44:08] are encamping about those who fear Him
[44:12] I can hear Gabriel say I go down there
[44:15] and strike babbling off the map if you
[44:17] let me go down there have you considered
[44:19] them I can hear the master say yes
[44:22] Gabriel you're a wonderful angel you've
[44:24] obeyed me and set at my right hand ever
[44:27] since the day I created you but I can't
[44:30] let you go just can't let you go and I'm
[44:34] gonna fast forward the Prophet goes on
[44:35] to say oh he goes on to say in paragraph
[44:41] 26 have you considered them yes all
[44:44] night long I've been watching them
[44:46] brother his eyes is on the sparrow I
[44:48] know he watches me he's watching you
[44:50] he's seeing how much faith you got how
[44:53] much you got he wants to see what kind
[44:56] of stand you'll take the hour has come
[44:59] what are you going to do he said I've
[45:02] watched him all night I've heard every
[45:04] prayer they pray your angels have been
[45:07] good angels but I can't let you go for I
[45:10] am going myself God comes to the scene
[45:13] himself and many tar God is waiting for
[45:17] us to act he's waiting for us he waiting
[45:20] to see what we're going to do what kind
[45:22] of actions is going to come out of the
[45:24] trial or test that's being put upon us
[45:26] many times the test is meant to prove
[45:29] what's already been placed in us
[45:31] and God has confidence in you tonight
[45:34] that whatever situation you're facing
[45:36] you're gonna be you're only going to be
[45:39] proven to be a manifestation of God's
[45:42] Word because God's Word says the sons
[45:45] and daughters of God are led by the
[45:47] Spirit of God and I believe tonight that
[45:50] if you're led by the Spirit of God then
[45:52] victory is leading you healing is
[45:55] leading you whatever it is that you need
[45:58] God has already have it for you now I
[46:02] believe God has already made the deposit
[46:05] and when God makes the deposit it's your
[46:08] responsibility to cash it right if he's
[46:11] made a deposit for your healing then you
[46:13] have to cash that check if he's made a
[46:15] deposit for your deliverance or for your
[46:17] victory you've got to be able to cash
[46:19] that check now I'm gonna take this out
[46:25] of message whatever he says to do do it
[46:29] paragraph 11 this is 1953 0 6 or 1 it
[46:36] says now perfect faith just like perfect
[46:40] love cast out all fear
[46:41] all doubting if you believe it no matter
[46:44] what the symptoms are or what the
[46:46] results you believe it's just the same
[46:48] do you ever have something you just knew
[46:51] was going to happen no matter what it
[46:53] looked it looked like it was not going
[46:56] to happen but it's going to happen
[46:57] anyhow because you believe it that way
[47:00] now when Jesus says anything his word is
[47:03] a seed and every word would bring forth
[47:05] after his kind if it's a seed of promise
[47:09] for your salvation it'll work for
[47:10] salvation if it's for healing it'll work
[47:13] for healing if it's for joy peace
[47:15] anything that you have need of all the
[47:18] reduce all the redemptive blessings is
[47:21] in Christ and he's setting tonight as a
[47:23] high priest of your confession sitting
[47:27] at the right hand of majesty and heaven
[47:30] to make intercession upon your
[47:32] confession now your confession gives God
[47:35] permission to move when you can confess
[47:39] God's Word now you allow God to move
[47:42] upon your situation
[47:44] and faith when you can have faith in the
[47:49] mists of your situation now you're
[47:51] giving God the authority to take control
[47:53] and faith knows no defeat because faith
[47:56] is perfect right faith brings things
[48:00] that when there are no things to be
[48:02] brought faith creates so whatever you're
[48:05] in need of you actually have the
[48:07] authority to create out of the faith you
[48:09] have in God now we've been redeemed to a
[48:14] promise and we the promise we've been
[48:16] redeemed to is the promise of this time
[48:21] prophet says then it is a fact that
[48:26] God's Word is eternal and the very world
[48:30] that were sitting upon tonight is
[48:32] nothing more than the Word of God
[48:35] materialized he spoke the word and said
[48:39] let there be and the world came into
[48:41] existence all things that you see was
[48:45] made by faith in the spoken word of God
[48:48] God said let there be and he believed in
[48:51] his own word well after Redemption a
[48:54] taste of God in our souls and hearts how
[48:57] much more are we to base our faith on
[48:59] the God on what God give us the promise
[49:02] for and sent Jesus to die to redeem us
[49:05] to that promise now what promise
[49:10] I believe he redeemed us to the promise
[49:13] of his word right the word itself was
[49:18] promised to his to us and we are that
[49:21] word scripture says if we abide in him
[49:25] and his word abiding us we can ask
[49:27] whatever we will and I believe that
[49:30] places us as as as as heirs with Christ
[49:34] to ask and the word that that we are
[49:38] that we are carrying the word seed we
[49:41] have the rights to ask according to
[49:45] God's will and I believe God will
[49:46] fulfill it now we are the very word
[49:50] because before the word was a word we
[49:54] were already on his thoughts
[49:56] and we were there before the word came a
[49:58] word and the beautiful thing about that
[50:01] is that God has made us a promise that
[50:08] the word itself will bring forth after
[50:10] its own kind and if the bride has at the
[50:15] brightest supposed to bring forth after
[50:17] its own kind we are producing the very
[50:20] word of Christ and the very word is as a
[50:24] person of Christ right now in the
[50:29] message the perfect faith the Prophet
[50:32] says in paragraph 213 he says this is
[50:37] coming into that third pole I'm
[50:39] believing it I'm working out something
[50:42] see it's taking this charge of faith and
[50:46] going right back to begin and come in
[50:49] see it's a kind of race faith and a
[50:51] bracket where you've never noticed it
[50:54] that way before
[50:55] not a faith but a perfect faith build it
[50:59] up here and watch perfect God with a
[51:01] perfect heart keep a perfect promise by
[51:03] His perfect word which is sharper than
[51:06] to any two-edged sword and a discerner
[51:09] of the thoughts of the heart what we're
[51:11] coming now to the perfection because the
[51:14] people has come to this in order for the
[51:17] rapture that's what's holding it away
[51:20] right now is waiting for that church to
[51:23] come into that perfect raptured faith
[51:25] looking for it
[51:26] it means a lot of shaving down for me it
[51:29] means a lot for you but together we'll
[51:32] make it by the grace of God amen and I
[51:37] believe we're gonna make it by the grace
[51:39] of God because it requires a perfect
[51:42] faith and having the right mental
[51:45] attitude will provide will grant us that
[51:48] perfect faith having the right mental
[51:50] attitude will allow us to know that God
[51:53] has an expectation of us his expectation
[51:57] is that his word is going to carry us
[52:00] through no matter what the situation is
[52:03] his word has already given us the right
[52:05] and we've already been
[52:07] the place to confess what his word has
[52:11] already done and I believe as we near
[52:14] the rapture doubted waiting for our
[52:17] faith to be perfected and what's going
[52:19] to perfect our faith is a perfect word a
[52:22] perfect or perfect Christ a perfect God
[52:25] a perfect promise and as an
[52:29] encouragement is whatever you're going
[52:32] through tonight know that every step
[52:37] that you take that was right under your
[52:38] feet know that every step you take
[52:41] you've already stepped all over what the
[52:43] devil has put in your way God has
[52:46] already made a way and if God has said
[52:50] it then you have the right to receive it
[52:52] because it sent His Word and if it's in
[52:55] his word then God is waiting for your
[52:57] faith to believe it god bless you have a
[53:11] quick with a prayer dear Heavenly Father
[53:17] loyal God we thank you for a perfect
[53:20] word we thank you Father for a perfect
[53:22] faith Lord God we know at this time it's

[54:01] to know who we are Lord that God
[54:04] whatever the devil would come in our
[54:06] direction with your
[54:08] Lord God just like Shadrach Meshach and
[54:11] Abednego father
[54:13] even if Lord God will know they will not
[54:17] serve or bow down but that God would
[54:20] continue Lord and the fight of faith
[54:23] father God just like Paul says we fought
[54:26] a good fight we've kept the faith the
[54:29] Lord God that's what we want our
[54:30] testimony to be doing
