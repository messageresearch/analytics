[1:12:12] these 10 commandments was the
[1:12:14] instructions on what you get in this
[1:12:17] land this is how you supposed one of the
[1:12:24] first things now I brought you out with

[1:12:48] I don't prepare the land for you
[1:12:51] get over there and get beside yourself
[1:12:54] and start watching another god yeah but
[1:13:01] see these haters this Seder calls Satan
[1:13:06] he's a slickster yeah you gotta watch
[1:13:09] him he will burn you don't even know if
[1:13:22] you're not keeping your eyes on the
[1:13:26] Prophet on the message if you're not
[1:13:30] staying focused on the world of the idol
[1:13:36] worship and you won't even know it
[1:13:41] you're many people today think that
[1:13:45] they're worshiping God you're saying the
[1:13:49] name Jesus but you're not what God is
[1:13:54] not accepting that let me give you some
[1:13:57] example we're gonna do a little
[1:13:58] backtrack then we're gonna move forward
[1:14:00] y'all some of you have been here always
[1:14:02] at night encounter I'm kind of just
[1:14:04] working in the same line here we see
[1:14:08] back in the beginning amen Cain and Abel
[1:14:14] they will both come from a good family
[1:14:18] they was raised the same way went to the
[1:14:23] same schools both they went to the same
[1:14:27] church amen and they and they both had
[1:14:33] to worship
[1:14:35] tutto to sacrifice under God and then
[1:14:40] when we see that Abel you know winning
[1:14:45] he got a lamb you didn't just get any
[1:14:48] lamb he got his best land
[1:14:51] and he took that lamb and he went and he
[1:14:56] and he found him oh nice Rock altar yes
[1:15:00] and he got him another smaller Rock and
[1:15:04] he took that and he just I he beaten the
[1:15:09] throat that's right he's sacrificing his
[1:15:13] best lamb to God right this spotless
[1:15:18] right this blameless Lamb he speak miss
[1:15:25] lamb he the blood all over the white
[1:15:32] fire at a lamb
[1:15:34] Abel standing there with blood on his
[1:15:37] clothes blood in his hands now another
[1:15:43] hand came he brought another form of
[1:15:49] worship right he he he till the soil and
[1:15:52] and he grew in a garden and he had
[1:15:54] fruits and flowers and different things
[1:15:57] and they were beautiful and he took the
[1:16:00] time and and him any built this
[1:16:04] elaborate altar right with the
[1:16:07] pineapples in there and the different
[1:16:10] color fruit and flower it was gorgeous
[1:16:15] beautiful able stand to know where that
[1:16:18] would blood dirty and God told him I
[1:16:25] can't accept that if you worship like
[1:16:32] your problem I'll accept your work Cain
[1:16:38] was sincere in what he was doing
[1:16:42] he was truly worshiping God with all he
[1:16:46] laid he walked in the field of sweat day
[1:16:50] after day to grow DS him and he the Wiis
[1:16:53] and he any any any water them anything
[1:16:57] and he did all of this work said I can't
[1:17:02] accept conscious not within the
[1:17:08] revelation see Abel had a revelation and
[1:17:13] understood that did sacrifice
[1:17:16] represented the sacrifice of the Lamb
[1:17:19] that would come in the future and Abel
[1:17:25] I'm contained didn't have that right he
[1:17:30] did what he thought in his mind was good
[1:17:37] sort of law couldn't accept that and we
[1:17:43] see that uh the Bible say that he was
[1:17:46] wrong he got angry yeah yeah he got
[1:17:50] angry and slew his brother yeah I put
[1:17:56] that one on the Shelf and we'll come
[1:17:57] back to that later
[1:17:59] cuz we go see the same thing happen back
[1:18:02] in at another time yeah was the same
[1:18:06] kind of spirit took place
[1:18:10] God didn't accept they worship and they
[1:18:13] got angry and they killed a brother man
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:21] moving forward we looking and seeing
[1:18:22] okay Noah had sons and and and and we
[1:18:32] see that going down
[1:18:37] he's one of his grandson sons of ham
[1:18:42] Nimrod and they nama and they built the
[1:18:47] tower
[1:18:47] you see when when when God was so
[1:18:50] disgusting
[1:18:51] with the sins of that current time
[1:18:54] because the sons of God looked upon the
[1:18:59] daughters of man and and took upon them
[1:19:02] wives and and and and and and and he he
[1:19:07] said I'm going to destroy this it
[1:19:09] grieved God that he made man and so he
[1:19:12] that we know about the Great Flood and
[1:19:15] things like that so so so this fella
[1:19:17] said well well well well I'm gonna I'm
[1:19:20] gonna I'm gonna do come about that and
[1:19:22] he built the tower a very tall tower
[1:19:27] enamored just huge huge thing and at
[1:19:31] that time he pulled all of the small
[1:19:33] countries in and he and he and he built
[1:19:35] this tower that then he said well if God
[1:19:38] have a flood again we'll just go up in
[1:19:41] the top of the tower yeah and and be
[1:19:45] safe but God had other plans but we see
[1:19:50] this fella here Nimrod he was a great
[1:19:53] warrior and and and uh he was he was an
[1:19:56] evil man yeah he was an evil man and he
[1:20:00] tried to do things outside of the will
[1:20:05] of God he wanted to he wanted to go his
[1:20:08] own way so he was being led by another
[1:20:11] spirit the same spirit that when God
[1:20:14] told Cain if you worship like your
[1:20:16] brother I'll accept oh why couldn't he
[1:20:18] just do that right no because there was
[1:20:20] another spirit that was controlling them
[1:20:23] and this fellow kind of had the same
[1:20:25] thing see the spirits don't die the man
[1:20:29] died but the spirits live on we're gonna
[1:20:33] by the help of the Lord walk you all the
[1:20:35] way down to did day and show you the
[1:20:39] same spirit right we're still here today
[1:20:44] Naim wrong they built this and then
[1:20:50] there was the the place of idol worship
[1:20:55] there was three things that this fella
[1:20:58] wanted to do we noticed that he said he
[1:21:03] wanted to build a strong nation he
[1:21:06] wanted to start his own religion and and
[1:21:10] he wanted to make a name for himself now
[1:21:14] we find here in this location here that
[1:21:16] it was the basis of every system this
[1:21:20] was the beginning right the seat of
[1:21:24] every system of idolatry yeah the one
[1:21:31] thing that gods don't have any other
[1:21:33] gods before me
[1:21:35] amen and Satan
[1:21:37] we realized that has always wanted to be
[1:21:41] a worship right oh man and and and just
[1:21:46] like God well he watched and then and he
[1:21:49] was cast out and he saw God in the
[1:21:54] Garden of Eden and he kind of saw how he
[1:21:57] did things and and how he it took him
[1:22:01] six thousand years a man in the seventh
[1:22:04] he rested in and in all of these things
[1:22:07] and he he and he said what I want to do
[1:22:09] the same thing I want to be worshipped
[1:22:11] just like that I want I want I want
[1:22:14] people to be in awe of me you know so so
[1:22:18] he began to figure out a way so how can
[1:22:20] i how can I pull the worship of from
[1:22:26] from from him to me
[1:22:28] so he began to come up with these these
[1:22:31] different ways and and and and and he
[1:22:34] began to introduce this idol worship
[1:22:37] right this worship of other things but
[1:22:40] see you got the rememba see here the
[1:22:43] devil impersonates Christ almost to the
[1:22:47] letter
[1:22:49] almost to the letter the Bible says that
[1:22:52] it'll be so close to the deceive the
[1:22:56] very leg if it was possible to see the
[1:23:01] fella if it was possible so he's gonna
[1:23:04] he's Easy's whitey
[1:23:05] he's watched he is he he's watch Connie
[1:23:09] and he tries to stay right close and
[1:23:11] kind of mimic everything that he do now
[1:23:14] we see that Babylon it was established
[1:23:17] in Hamsterdam Nimrod firm the first call
[1:23:20] it was called the gates of paradise
[1:23:26] later called Babylon which means
[1:23:30] confusion there was idolatry there and
[1:23:34] set up that was set up there amen and we
[1:23:43] see that that in this time that one of
[1:23:46] the things that they thought they did
[1:23:48] was the worship a man of those the
[1:23:55] system of polytheism form of worship
[1:23:59] which which which means a man that these
[1:24:03] three gods they they they instituted
[1:24:05] this this three cars type of worship of
[1:24:08] multiple gods one being mainly the
[1:24:16] worship of saints or of a family with
[1:24:21] the mother the father and the child and
[1:24:25] and pushing the mother of a front above
[1:24:30] the child and you see this in all
[1:24:34] different forms of religion and and
[1:24:37] different things like that across the
[1:24:39] world today amen I'm gonna get into some
[1:24:43] things but I don't want to put the cart
[1:24:44] before the horse so y'all pray for me
[1:24:46] that uh we see here that bear let's
[1:24:55] let's go to Jeremiah Jeremiah seventh
[1:24:58] chapter will Jeremiah the seventh
[1:25:01] chapter
[1:25:06] want to look at some things here and
[1:25:09] just kind of walk you through and see
[1:25:10] how this seat for this fella a manager
[1:25:17] might a seventh chapter say man when you
[1:25:21] have it we're gonna start from the tenth
[1:25:25] verse and and come and stand before me
[1:25:38] in the house which is called by my name
[1:25:43] and say we are delivered to all these
[1:25:48] abominations in the house which is
[1:25:52] called by my name become a den of
[1:25:55] robbers in the eyes in your eyes behold
[1:26:00] even I have seen it saith the Lord but
[1:26:06] go ye now I went through my place which
[1:26:09] is in Shiloh where I which when I set my
[1:26:14] name at the first and see what I did
[1:26:18] what I did and for this wickedness for
[1:26:21] the wickedness of my people Israel and
[1:26:25] now because ye have done all these works
[1:26:29] saith the Lord and I spake unto you
[1:26:32] rising up early speaking but you heard
[1:26:37] not and I called you but you answered
[1:26:40] young therefore will I do unto this
[1:26:44] house which is called by my name where
[1:26:47] when you trust and unto this place which
[1:26:51] I gave to you and to your father's as I
[1:26:56] have done in Shiloh and I will catch you
[1:27:00] out of my sight and I have cashed all I
[1:27:04] have cast out all of your brother in'
[1:27:07] even the whole seed of ephraim therefore
[1:27:11] preg not thou for
[1:27:14] these people need to lift up cry nor
[1:27:17] prayer for them neither make
[1:27:21] intercession to me for I will not hear
[1:27:24] thee see it's down not that they do in
[1:27:29] the cities of Judah and in the streets
[1:27:32] of Jerusalem the children gather wood
[1:27:36] and father Kindle and the and fire and
[1:27:39] women need their dough and make cakes to
[1:27:44] the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink
[1:27:49] offering unto their gods that they may
[1:27:53] provoke me to anger they do provoke me
[1:27:58] to anger say as the Lord of God now we
[1:28:02] see what what they was doing here is
[1:28:06] they had done got into idol worship and
[1:28:12] Bell was one of the most noted Idol gods
[1:28:19] of all the ages and and he was the Sun
[1:28:24] God and and then he had a wife who was
[1:28:28] the moon goddess I can't hardly
[1:28:33] pronounce her name I think it's a steer
[1:28:35] or something along those lines and it
[1:28:38] was its own a Roman coin and see she was
[1:28:43] called the goddess of the moon goddess
[1:28:46] the Queen of Heaven a man she was the
[1:28:52] mother of God and the Sun s you in God
[1:28:57] was Balaam well all of these was pagan
[1:29:02] worship they worship the Sun now we find
[1:29:06] that this displeased God this angered
[1:29:10] God this was a dark time because they
[1:29:16] had went to idol worship and and what
[1:29:19] they was that the needing of the door
[1:29:21] and the poor not doing they was
[1:29:23] what they was doing was taking communion
[1:29:26] they was taking communion with these
[1:29:29] idol gods and they was they was they was
[1:29:33] worshiping they was worshipping a god
[1:29:36] but there was worshipping an idol God a
[1:29:40] man and see sometimes if you're not
[1:29:45] careful if you're not careful and if
[1:29:48] you're not if you're not searching and
[1:29:51] if you're not hungry and not thirsting
[1:29:54] for the knowledge of the truth you can
[1:29:57] get something to idol worship not
[1:29:59] knowing it in anger God because he said
[1:30:05] I have no other God before me amen he
[1:30:14] says we see that the American Indians
[1:30:18] and the different ones this kind of
[1:30:21] worship just kind of promulgated a
[1:30:22] spread throughout the world where there
[1:30:26] was a queen of woman amen worship amen
[1:30:37] go to Daniel the third chapter Daniel
[1:30:44] the third chapter look at some things
[1:30:48] there
[1:31:09] then you the third chapter to seventh
[1:31:12] verse I'm sorry the third shot that
[1:31:18] we'll start reading from the third verse
[1:31:20] then the prince and the governors and
[1:31:23] the captains and the judges the
[1:31:26] treasurers and the counselors in the
[1:31:28] shares and all the rules of the
[1:31:31] Providence well gather together unto
[1:31:34] this dedication of the image that
[1:31:37] Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up and
[1:31:40] they stood before the image that
[1:31:44] Nebuchadnezzar had set up then and held
[1:31:50] cried aloud to you it is commanded o
[1:31:55] people o nation and languages that are
[1:32:00] what time you hear the sound of the
[1:32:05] cornet flute the harp the sight view the
[1:32:10] salt the psaltery dulcimer and all kinds
[1:32:15] of music that ye fall down and worship
[1:32:20] the golden the golden image that
[1:32:26] Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up and
[1:32:29] whoso falleth not down and worship shall
[1:32:35] be saying I will be cast into the midst
[1:32:38] of the burning fire therefore at that
[1:32:43] time when all the people heard the sound
[1:32:45] of the cornet flute the horror the sack
[1:32:50] ball the sultry and all kinds of music
[1:32:53] all the people in the nations and the
[1:32:57] languages fell down to worship the image
[1:33:00] that Nebuchadnezzar had set up brothers
[1:33:05] and sisters were living in a day where
[1:33:09] Satan has done the same thing
[1:33:13] we have now they used to be a time where
[1:33:19] in order to listen to music I think you
[1:33:24] had to go and you had to turn what they
[1:33:27] call that thing a start off some kind of
[1:33:29] a phone or whatever and and and and and
[1:33:33] the music would come out and it was
[1:33:37] didn't have high definition and all of
[1:33:40] that it was just some music so we went
[1:33:45] from there and I think they were maybe
[1:33:49] the 8-track was next I mean I know some
[1:33:53] remember the eight-track so maybe don't
[1:33:56] remember the eight-track remember the a
[1:34:00] track and the the record player and it
[1:34:08] moved on and Satan got even with the
[1:34:15] music he says well I gotta get him to
[1:34:19] worship now he's remember he's trying to
[1:34:23] promulgate this worship he won't he
[1:34:27] won't dis worship so he said I gotta get
[1:34:30] more people I got more people into this
[1:34:33] music I can control them I can pull them
[1:34:37] with this music so then I come up with
[1:34:41] uh well we got the cassette player in
[1:34:46] the little portable box on the shoulder
[1:34:50] yeah and they walk with the big box I
[1:34:53] were back in the 80s some of y'all
[1:34:56] remember that some of y'all don't
[1:35:00] another device she said well I'm agimo
[1:35:03] but the little bit black hole a Walkman
[1:35:07] you can put your tape in there and clip
[1:35:10] it to your belt no your headphones on
[1:35:12] and you're listening to your music your
[1:35:16] country your route right and all
[1:35:20] whatever you wanted to listen to and all
[1:35:23] of it
[1:35:24] messages and different things just going
[1:35:27] to you speed no The Devil's song service
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:37] you just haven't fellowship with the
[1:35:40] devil all day long right and he got even
[1:35:46] slicker he said well I'm gonna put these
[1:35:49] things on CD and get them even smaller
[1:35:52] what ain't got it's easier to carry
[1:35:55] we're gonna go all the way or they might
[1:35:57] be streaming it's on your phone oh the
[1:36:04] whole music industry yeah it's 24/7
[1:36:10] constantly worshiping just like they was
[1:36:16] here yeah in Daniel the image this
[1:36:23] worship of Satan now we look at another
[1:36:29] interesting thing here that it became to
[1:36:34] a point well it became law that if you
[1:36:40] didn't worship right you'll be dealt
[1:36:44] with now it's gone from a deception to a
[1:36:49] forcing right yeah no man and we hit it
[1:36:55] right there my brothers and sisters
[1:36:57] right first it's a deception Amen now
[1:37:04] going back to Jeremiah we see we see
[1:37:07] here how they they they begin to talk to
[1:37:10] talk to worship falsely this Queen the
[1:37:14] moon-goddess in this bill and and and
[1:37:17] and and and and said taking had another
[1:37:19] trick he had another trick up their
[1:37:22] sleeve he say well I introduced this
[1:37:26] music in and and and I and I
[1:37:28] and I'll write I mystic Minds up with
[1:37:32] this music get them in and it is
[1:37:35] framework and get him into this flow of
[1:37:37] this idol worship so Dan he began to the
[1:37:45] music y'all hear me mind begin to
[1:37:50] degrade the morals of the women it began
[1:37:59] to DT now now not now not now through
[1:38:03] the music through the music through the
[1:38:05] music you began to see the the women
[1:38:08] began to be affected right not a man are
[1:38:15] being affected to Waseca said is it a
[1:38:17] devil he tricked them here Jeremiah to
[1:38:23] work of the Queen of Heaven see in the
[1:38:29] beginning he deceived Eve to create the
[1:38:37] original fall and and and even therein
[1:38:43] in Babylon here place the the muzzle
[1:38:49] over the child so it has always been
[1:38:53] about the worship of a woman always been
[1:39:00] about the worship of them hey that's the
[1:39:02] same secret weapon just I can use cccccc
[1:39:10] the man not God God made man in his own
[1:39:17] image
[1:39:21] and the woman was a byproduct she came
[1:39:28] from the rib of a man so he said if I
[1:39:34] can I can I hear something I can use
[1:39:38] because this was not part of the
[1:39:40] original creation I can get in here
[1:39:45] and I can use this Avenue to pour
[1:39:49] worship towards me I can use this
[1:39:54] tallest Avenue to make millions phone
[1:39:58] right yeah y'all stay with me we're
[1:40:02] gonna work with this a little bit so we
[1:40:06] see a man mainly here in the United
[1:40:12] States amen
[1:40:15] the god of this society and the god of
[1:40:20] this nation how the woman has been
[1:40:26] through the music and through Hollywood
[1:40:28] and television and different things like
[1:40:31] that just the basic morals have have
[1:40:36] just deteriorated to a point to where
[1:40:41] it's just it's just a collapse of
[1:40:43] society used to be that narrow that the
[1:40:52] mother is the child's first teacher
[1:40:56] right but we find in this day that the
[1:41:00] mother is not teaching the child be
[1:41:05] putting headphones on material give them
[1:41:08] something to occupy a time right well
[1:41:11] we'll sit him in front of the television
[1:41:13] and that's a good mother cause the bad
