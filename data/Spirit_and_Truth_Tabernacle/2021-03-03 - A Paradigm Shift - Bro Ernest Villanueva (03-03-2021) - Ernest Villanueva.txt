service there we are in the midst of our time of fasting and we thank god for this and just want to encourage the church to continue a man uh during this and just i believe that god will just do special things for us uh i was telling somebody one things i have noticed and even um a little bit before the fast but even through this just there is a genuine uh revival spirit that is in this sanctuary and um i mean when you talk about uh omnipotence doing something special uh when you have a revival spirit like that there's an anointing a faith that elevates where people just begin to believe for the impossible and uh we just we expect the impossible amen because our god is a god of the impossibility so uh i just i just thank god for the anointing and i thank god that you know when it's like when you come here you know you're gonna hear from god amen you know you're going to hear from god and i just i just appreciate that amen so we want to continue this time of fasting amen and stay prayerful uh during this time and uh trust that the lord will just do something special for us as far as our giving amen those that are in the sanctuary we have a wooden box down the table that you have the ability to uh give amen there those that are online we have two forms uh um of giving there on online one is through cash app the other through paypal a cash app our handle is dollar sign

all things are possible if we only believe oh all things are possible oh if we only believe believe well now [Music] are possible [Music] [Music] believe [Music] all things are possible god bless you saints it's a great privilege to be with you once again i was thinking as i was driving down to west palm beach that last year the last assembly that i was able to be with was your assembly and when i went home they closed the border down in canada and i live on the u.s side only one mile from the canadian border and i have not seen my pastor since january of last year and in our church the only ones that can be present are is the ministers and the song leaders and the technicians but nobody can be in the church and they're serious in in canada in fact three times they came in the middle of the service the police came to make sure everybody had their mask on and everybody was socially distant so as i was speaking with brother jack that that scripture i was glad when they said let us come into the house of the lord and we're all looking forward to the time where we can be rejoined thankfully we have a campground on the u.s side so we have a chapel there so the believers on the u.s side can gather and we stream our service back to canada and on sunday morning they stream the service up to where we are so i'd like to have your seats just for a moment before i read a scripture i want to just give my own testimony that i believe with all my heart that we are the most blessed people who have ever walked on planet earth to live in the time that we're living in to see what we see and to hear what we hear and to know what we know and to see we have tomorrow's headlines today and it seems like day by day by day by day the prophecies that brother branham laid down are coming into manifestation i've also done a lot of studying about the age that we're living in and there has been an invasion of insanity that has struck the world brother branham said in 1964 that if time were to go on for 50 years the whole world will be in total insanity so that would have been 2014. and here we are seven years down the road from that and the the only way that i can rationalize the world that we're living in we know there's only one same mind that is the mind of christ and so it is impossible for a sane mind to understand an insane mind any more than an insane mind can understand a sane mind and the world has been bamboozled by the devil and it's it's sometimes it's hard to come to grips with but 99.9 of the people in the world do not know what you and i know they have no idea that god has come again for a second time this time in word form which is a more powerful form than the time he came the first time because now in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mysteries of god hath been revealed you know you think back when brother brandon the first message that brother branham ever spoke was faith is the substance that was the first message that was recorded and was printed the first seven words that brother branham spoke said now we're getting some gadgets for recording now think about that brother branham at that time in his ministry he there's no way he could have known the extent and the magnitude and the scope that his message was going to have all over the world but god had the first seven words he spoke as a little as a little signal from me i hope it is for you now we're getting some gadgets for recording recording the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen now you and i every one of us we are in a great battle brother branham called it the greatest battle ever fought and your battle is not my battle and my battle is not your battle some may be going through a physical battle a financial battle a spiritual battle an emotional battle maybe it's a battle with family maybe it's a battle at work all different kinds of battle but it's the greatest battle ever fought and in ephesians 6 it says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers and evil spirits in high places now these are real supernatural entities it's the army of the enemy it's like he has his generals and captains and sergeants and privates and they know each one of us they have a script on each one of us they know where we're weak they know where we have fallen in the past and sometimes it seems like they organize a swat team and that swat team comes after us and it battles us and you can feel that eerie presence of of the devil sometime when you know you're getting ready to be attacked and that's the time to get on our knees and brother branham as i was reading he was given instructions on how to fight the enemy he says that we should cut them chop them whack them slice them name them kick him out cast him out kill him now brother branham he was talking about taking the sword of the spirit the armor of god you know it's more important when we wake up in the morning to put on the armor of god than it is to put on our natural clothing [Music] when i wake up in the morning there's got to be two deaths i gotta die and the devil's gonna die first thing in the morning bind that yapping dog before he can even get started take control over him let him know who you're going to serve let him know the power of god is greater than all the power that he can muster amen glory think about the the billions of people that are walking around on this world and they have literally become puppets of satan he tells them what to look at he tells them what's important he tells them what to give their time and their attention to he tells them that the stars of the world whether they're business stars or political stars or sports stars or music stars or any kind of stars he tells them that those are the kind of stars that they should be looking at but i'm so thankful that god has sent the seventh star in this day and that seventh star has given us a blueprint of god's word of what is important to us and if we keep our eyes fixed on that like a pit bulldog on a meat wagon i'm gonna follow your word god i know this word leads to eternal glory what greater thing could we ask for than eternal life could you imagine if somebody could say i've got a bottle of elixir here and i can get guarantee you a thousand years of life what do you think some of these billionaires what do you think they would give an auction if they could be guaranteed a thousand years of life in a thousand years of life it cannot even be measured against eternity because there's no time in eternity and so we're down here on the earth for a very short time even solomon in all solomon's glory after he had backslid after he had finally come to grips with what he had and who he was and where he was richest man in the history of the world up until that time he said vanity vanity all is vanity a mere chasing after the wind and so here we are friends on a supernatural mystical journey god has captured your attention and god has given us the privilege of opening this bible this bible friends this is a supernatural book 66 books 40 different authors and yet every one of those those books they dovetail the jews had hundreds of prophecies of messiah and that messiah was coming and yet when he came they missed him they called them every kind of a foul name you could think about and finally they took them and they put them on a cross i have listened to probably 50 or more testimonies of jews who became christians i'm not talking about message christians but just christians and and when they are converted they look back and they say oh isaiah 53 isaiah 9 6 how could our ancestors have missed it how could they have crucified their own messiah and they go back to family and they go back to friends and they try to testify and they try to witness to them and many of them are put out of their family you know the worst thing that can happen in a jewish family is for one of their children to get married to a this is how they say it a christian a pagan christian one who worships three gods how could my son how could my daughter have been so deluded to follow after pagan paganism and many of those rabbis have never darkened the first page of the new testament because they know it's a lie they know it's wrong in their own minds but one day 144 000 of them are going to be quickened by moses and elijah and as we stand i'm going to have you read in the word with me in luke chapter 24 but i think of what happened in texas just last week god sometimes you know that brother brandon preached that message the flashing red light of his coming do you know in texas they experienced a mini tribulation in texas they went without electricity some of them for five days in the midst of the most brutal cold they can remember since back in the 1980s no electricity no heat the generators didn't work and those little children running around mommy i'm cold mommy i'm cold and they were hungry and they didn't have any fresh water they didn't have any fresh water to to brush their teeth or to bathe with and we can't even imagine what those people went through but but that that that is just a warm-up that's that's a many many many amateur tribulation for what the world has got you know my pastor who brings greetings to you brother biskell and brother tom ray and brother john andes and all the other ministers with us brother bischo when i would travel with him all around the world at special meetings when he was under a severe anointing and he was trying to get the word and just nail the word down he said this is god's word he said you have two choices you can either receive it or welcome to the tribulation as we turn to the bible in luke 24 verse 1 and before we read let's pray father how thankful i am that brother jack has opened the door to have me come and visit with the saints how much i enjoyed our fellowship the last time and our trip down to boynton beach and he took me around the president's white house down there and brother clinton allowed me to drive in a tesla and i went back home with so many wonderful experiences but this is a new experience god it's a new day it's a new hour your children have new needs tonight and i pray that you would meet those needs the bible said that you would give us the desires of our heart and lord as long as those desires are centered upon the revealed word the redemptive blessings of the resurrection you are obligated to your word a prophet of god said you're the high priest sitting at the right hand of majesty waiting to make good all the redemptive blessings of the resurrection so we come to you tonight lord confessing that your word is true confessing that we are your children confessing that we are a needy people and confessing that we believe all that you have promised in your word would come to pass thank you lord for this day for the hour for this gathering and we ask all these blessings with a great confidence for we ask it in your precious name of our lord jesus christ amen now this this message that we believe it is spoken to us in a language that it takes the token to understand it and like i said this is a supernatural book and god has to open your eyes to it to see it the bible said he's a rewarder of those who diligently search after him so once god opens our eyes it was him that called us we didn't go looking for him he came looking for us but when he found us then he says now go and search my word and you will find me and so in luke chapter 24 verse 1 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered in and they found not the body of the lord jesus amen god bless you and you can have your seats i'd like to speak to you tonight a thought entitled a paradigm shift and many people they have they have known the definition of a paradigm for a long time we've known that a paradigm is a model or an example like if you would say about a senior sister in the church that that sister she is a paradigm of virtue in other words she's a model or an example of virtue but probably about 20 years ago it came into our vernacular the word a paradigm shift so a paradigm shift is a radical change of thought brought about by a very unusual event or a keen insight into a matter if i can repeat that a paradigm shift is a radical change of thought brought about by a very unusual event or a keen insight into a matter now the story is told of a man in new york city at six o'clock in the morning he was with his two children four and six years old and the subway came to a stop and the man got on the subway with his two children and there was only one seat available so the man sat down and each one of the children sat on his lap and as the subway began to proceed the man just kind of nodded out so as children being young and they just got up and they began to play and they began to run up and down the aisle and as they ran their little elbows one hit a newspaper one of them hit a man's elbow and it tipped over coffee all over his suit and tie and and as they continued on this the people who were looking at them they were angry in fact if looks could kill those children they would have been corpses and finally one man walked up and he got right in the face of the sleeping man and he said sir and the man jumped up startled he said what's wrong he said your children your children are causing a ruckus here they are juvenile delinquents and you are apparent delinquent and now the man got up and looked and every eye on that subway was trained on him and and he began to apologize she said please forgive me he said i i should have been i should have been taking better care of my children i'm so sorry he said but i've been through a horrible experience he said last night we were at the supper table and my wife began to get a horrible headache and and finally we had to take her to the emergency room and they took her in and a couple hours later they came back and she was gone she'd had an aneurysm and he said and now it's just a few hours ago and my mind is is just spinning he said i don't know what i'm going to do i don't have any family here and and i don't know about my children how they're going to go to school and who's going to take care of them and and so please forgive me and all of a sudden those people that had looked upon that man with anger and disgust all of a sudden that man had only spoken less than two minutes and their minds had been turned 180 degrees and and one man walked up with this thermos bottle and gave him a cup of coffee another man walked up and put some money into his hand and then it seemed like a parade of people coming up there and trying to comfort the man and and giving money [Music] and and the women were reaching into their purses and taking out gum and candy for the children and talking to them [Music] and finally one man he walked up he said sir he said i don't i don't mean to you know try to be a big shop but i do have a large company here in in town and i don't know what kind of work you do but whatever kind of work you do i will find a position for you in my company and whatever kind of salary that you are earning i will increase it to make up for the additional spences you're going to have being without your wife and so you think about how quickly a man's mind can change if they get the right information that corrects what they had initially looked at you know the only exercise some people ever get is jumping to conclusions so let's talk in the bible about some paradigm shifts in the bible the first one we can talk about is the angels that rebelled against god rebelled against the one who created them and they were listening to one of the created ones and when they got kicked out of heaven they got a real paradigm shift right they left glory they left heaven they left paradise they left a place where you know they were they were worshiping god and they saw they had been deceived and now they had lost their inheritance then the next paradigm shift we see is adam and eve there in the garden every day god would come down in the cool of the evening they were amateur gods had control over all of the garden control over all the animals the lions the tigers the elephants the bears all the way down to the smallest animal and when satan who had been cast down there is a term it's called epigenesco and it's a greek term which means having a knowledge of the principles of life and satan now who had been cast down he is observing god in creation and he's watching and watching and watching and because he had a knowledge of the principles of life he was able to discern that the serpent and eve could procreate i believe at one time that serpent he might have been just a harmless serpent walking around the garden until satan came and entered into him and he began to speak to eve he said yay has god said you can't eat out of all the trees in the garden she said oh no we could eat out of all the trees in the garden butter the tree in the midst of the garden god said you shall not eat it or touch it lest you die so the serpent he comes back and he quotes the word back to her almost perfectly he said you shall not surely die so he inserted the word not and cain was of the product of the not and therefore he came to naught adam and eve were put out of the garden put out of their close fellowship in contact with god the serpent he got a paradigm shift right after his success he was probably like a lawyer he was probably walking around he was probably pretty happy with what he had done pretty happy with his success and when god came he said adam where are you and he wasn't asking him what tree are you behind he was asking him where are you in your spiritual life look where you have fallen from what happened now remember adam entered into that sin because of his agopo love for eve he loved her didn't want to lose her so he enters into the sin then when god asked them what happened he said that woman that you gave to be with me she gave me of the fruit and i did eat what happened to his agapo love [Music] he had a radical paradigm shift [Music] and then god said to the woman what is this you have done she said the serpent beguiled me or he seduced me or he deceived me and i did eat now here's the serpent standing there brother brent said great big tall fella about 10 feet tall and god said because you have done this he didn't say because you have said this because you have done this on your belly what from a 10 foot tall i don't know how long that snake was brother jack might have been a ten foot snake paradigm shift how about noah and his family they went from a very advanced civilization with billions of people on the earth i was showing brother jack a quote where brother branham said in noah's day there were more people on the earth than there are now wow and only eight went in the boat they left one civilization and when they landed on dry ground it was a brand new civilization they were the only human beings left out of billions how about abraham and sarah one day old man an old woman next moment young man and a young woman abraham probably said sarah what's happened to you he said i don't know abraham but whatever happened to me i think it's happened to you too jacob had to wrestle with the angel of the lord and the angel touched his thigh and after he touched his thigh he limped all the rest of his life he was now israel and everybody that saw him said see that that used to be jacob but now it's israel because the angel of the lord touched him and now he walks different he talks different he thinks different everything about that man is different why he wrestled with the angel of the lord and every one of us here tonight if you are a true believer of this message you have wrestled with the angel of the lord and you have had a paradigm shift from the religious world that you were once in or the worldly life that you once had to this brand new supernatural life i think about the philippines the philistines when david went there and cut off goliath's head they went from being you know yeah yeah yeah we're the best we're the most powerful but when david cut off his head changed him and they ran for the hills that's right when samson when he had a paradigm shift when he's there and he's grinding away grinding at the mia the wheel and and and the fuzz started growing back on his head and the more fuzz grew back the faster he grinded and he grinded and he grinded you know if that was me if i was one of those philistine leaders he would have got a buzz cut five times a day there would not have been a chance for one bit of peach for us ever to grow back on that head and he said lord just once more and in his death he killed more philistines than he did when he was alive and brother branham said when those philistines before they captured him and took his eyes out when even the name of samson was mentioned they would quake and they would tremble and finally how about elijah and elisha elijah he had a paradigm shift taken up in a chariot right before elisha it was a paradigm shift for him because he he was told if you see that cloak you'll have the double portion and he had the double portion and he did exactly twice as many miracles miraculous sign as elijah had done and now we go back to luke 24. verse 2 and they found a stone rolled away from the sepulcher and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed there about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them now here's the two angels speaking to the women that are there at the tomb they had not been able to dress the body on friday because the sabbath was entering in so they had to wait until the beginning of the end of the sabbath and they entered in and the angel said to them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but has risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again verse 8 says and they remembered his word i wonder how many times jesus had repeated those things to them while he was yet with them but they had spiritual amnesia [Music] and they returned from the sepulcher and told all these things throw all these things onto the eleven and them that were with them now we know who the eleven were right now was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostle verse 11 very astounding verse and their words seem to them as idol tales and they believe them not so how many times had the lord spoke to the apostles the women hear the two angels and they believe and they come back to the apostles and they don't believe then arose peter and ran unto the sepulcher and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by himself and departed wondering himself at that which was come to pass now i'm sure peter is thinking well i don't know what's going on here but even if this is true even if he has risen from the dead he's not going to want to see my sorry face after what i did denied him three times and cursed that i even knew him and so he walks away wondering and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlong brother ram said it was about a six hour walk and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him now this is my own thought the jesus that came and walked with them he was in a totally different form than he was just a few days before he was in his young body maybe excuse me i guess something caught in my throat so maybe all the gray hairs were gone maybe jesus was stooped over from bearing all the burdens that he had being a homeless man all that time and because of all the ministry and brother branham talked about the weakness that came upon him the same kind of weakness that came upon jesus and the bible said if all the things that jesus said and did recorded all the books in the world could not hold him so now jesus went with them but their eyes were holding they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad in other words he said what's this negative communication all about what's this bad attitude about and the one of them whose name was cleophas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem in other words hey pal did you just get here did you just arrive don't you know the things that have happened in jerusalem the last few days and jesus said unto them um what things so he's checking their revelation checking to find out what they know and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed before before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but now they're given their testimony but we trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were was went to the sepulcher and founded even so as the women had said but him they saw not now just try to imagine if you were simon and cleophus and the lord had to speak to you like this and he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken do i get a bottle of water brother jack hmm excuse me he said ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory now listen this is very powerful and beginning at moses and all al all the prophets remember this is a six-hour sermon he expounded unto them in all the scriptures concerning himself and as they drew nigh under the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further in other words he was saying see you guys bye-bye yeah nice knowing you i'm leaving but they constrained him brother ren said their character began the show and they constrained him and they said it's late come on in we've got to have fellowship with you we want to feed you so they wanted to feed jesus but what they didn't know was that jesus was not done feeding them amen amen and it came to pass and you sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and their eyes were open paradigm shift the man that they were walking with the man that they thought they knew was this young man all of a sudden their eyes were open and they said it's the lord amen and he vanished out of their sight that's right disappeared now try to imagine if you were simon or cleophus and the lord had to speak to you and said oh fools and slow of heart you know maybe you're temporal who do you think you are don't you know who i am i was with the lord i spent three plus years with him all right baby simon said to cleopatra you ever see this guy around in the meetings nope never did he ever said no i've never seen him either who's he think he is talking to us like that but listen and for six hours he expounded him and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripture and they rose up the same hour i don't believe they said well you know it's been a long day we've walked six hours maybe we ought to rest a while and maybe you know we'll head out tomorrow and and we'll tell the apostles what we've learned no they rose up the same hour and i don't believe it took them six hours to get back they were running now with a message they returned to jerusalem and they found the eleven gathered together and them that were with him and now here's a testimony to them saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of bread now buckle your seat belt we're coming down to a close now and as they thus spoke jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you here's their response but they were terrified and are frightened and supposing they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit had not flesh and bones as you see me have he didn't say flesh and blood the blood had already been shed he said flesh and bone and when that's a good stick in my in my throat and as he had just spoken he showed them his hands and his feet in other words he said look right here that's where they nailed me and he lifted up his garment he said right there see down there that that's where they nailed my feet so here he is in another form appearing unto them after the women after simon and cleophus had testified unto them and this is one of the most amazing verses in the bible and while they yet believed not what you mean jesus is standing right in front of them showing them his hands showing them his feet and while they believed not for joy and wondered he said have you hear any meat and he gave them a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb and he took it and did it before them probably whoever got the the bread and and and the honey and the meat they probably didn't want to get too maybe they just lobbed it to them still afraid what's going on here why they are in the middle of a radical paradigm shift a supernatural paradigm shift the greatest supernatural paradigm shift that had ever taken place is the lord jesus christ risen from the dead in his body with his apostles and he said unto them these are the words i spoke unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and to the prophets and in the psalms concerning me now jesus could have said go get a blind man or go get a death man or go get a leper or go get a bowl of water and i'll turn it into wine he could have done all those things but he had done them for three plus years and brother branham said all he had to show for it was a group of mechanic filled cowards before the paradigm shift here they were wondering terrified a frightened even the lord jesus christ appearing right in front of them [Music] after all they had heard in the ministry and after all these things start coming back to them they're still terrified and the bible says then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures you see folks unless the lord opens your eyes to this supernatural message it will just be intellectual knowledge and thinking and you think you understand it and you think you know it but there comes a time in your life as a true believer when you will know that you know that you know that you know that you know i'll never forget i had come out of the religious merry-go-round from catholic to baptist assembly of god ptl bible school upc had all this religious leaven inside of me and i'm reading and studying the message and one day i'm listening i'm struggling with the serpent scene struggling with a prophet and brother branham is speaking to a woman he said now sister i don't know you and you don't know me but there is one here that does know you and he does know me he said now when he listen brother braham is saying when he and his spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away and he gives me a temporarily resurrection by my spirit and he wants to use my body and i'm so happy to loan it to him anything he can get out of it and it was then friends i understood a son of man revealing the son of man let's stand to our feet father the greatness and the magnitude and the power of your word cannot be adequately expressed through a human vessel but we love you we believe you with all of our heart we've had our eyes open as simon and cleopas had their eyes open as the apostles had their eyes open to a wonderful supernatural mystical world as jesus was a mystic the people didn't understand him and so the people don't understand your bride where oddballs were strange if they really knew what we believe they'd probably try to throw us in jail or even worse in an insane asylum but father i thank you for your word and how you have unveiled it to us i thank you for each believer present here tonight and i pray that you would continue their journey in this word and i pray that you would give them a passion a deeper understanding and a knowledge of who they are and and understanding of what you have done in our lives and what you have prepared for us throughout all of eternity and lord let us count the price of our salvation count the price of our revelation i want to ask you friends if you would testify tonight that you have had that great paradigm shift in your life and that god has changed you from what you were to what you are and this is an ongoing evolution like the caterpillar that goes into the cocoon and comes out the beautiful butterfly so we are lord we're coming out we're coming out as beautiful creatures with a wedding garment that is snow white prepared for the wedding supper lord we thank you for all you've revealed to us and i pray that you would bless each one of my brothers and sisters here tonight if they have a need i pray that you would meet it i pray that your divine love and grace and mercy would so over shatter them and supercharge and electrify and illuminate and quicken and stimulate activate motivate revelate them lord to the core of their very being where all they see and all they want to see is jesus christ can we sing that song i want to live the way he wants me to live and brother jack i'm going to ask you to come and take the song service [Music] sorry about my throat the way i'm this one brother he wants me to live i want to give just nothing to give [Music] can never i want to live the way who wants me [Music] [Music] just no more to give i want to love love to you there's just no more love for i can never oh i'll love the lord let's sing it one more time oh i want to live the way he wants me to live yes i want to give until there's just no more to get hey i want to there's just no more love for i can never amen just continue to play softly how many appreciate the word of the lord on tonight [Applause] man just uh the the thought of paradigm shift and just a number of examples there that brother ernie gave us and i just love the definition it's a a radical change of thought brought about by an unusual event or through keen insight and um you know just a real or really um i mean you think about what the brothers on the road to emmaus went through and that was a tremendous event to see the lord jesus risen from the dead and you know how it just it shifted everybody's thinking and i uh i appreciate that but the story he started off with of uh the people being on the subway and uh how they were just criticizing a man for how his children were acting on the subway but once he shared his story to share this testimony everybody there that heard it went through a paradigm shift and i tell you anytime anybody truly hears the gospel of the lord jesus christ when they hear the word of god and uh we've heard uh how god has sent uh something a revelation through a prophet that caused a paradigm shift for us too you know that's why we could never be satisfied in denominations ever again because we have experienced a paradigm shift a radical change we thank god for it we certainly thank god for it amen let's give the lord another hand to praise for the word of god tonight [Music] [Applause] hallelujah man let's just bow in a word of prayer uh father we just want to appreciate you taking us through this paradigm shift lord the testimonies of the brothers on the road to emmaus and god just uh all the other disciples that that were missing it they they misunderstood they didn't catch it but god uh after um but we have the opportunity to kind of read these things and what we can see a little bit more in scripture but i pray that in our day that we don't miss a man what you're doing for us and the revealing of the word of god how it should have triggered a paradigm shift in so many uh god we can even we can even look lives of some of the people lord and uh god just little events that have happened here and there that's caused them to shift their thinking lord i just believe that the holy spirit is able to restore all things and and give them another paradigm shift i pray o god that you would just do lord only what your word says that you can do and we trust god that you would just get all the glory and all the god thank you for our brother uh laboring to bring this thought here tonight and we know the enemy was fighting him but god we thank you that he has the victory and acts that you just completely touch him lord and uh father uh the devil doesn't like when this word goes forth even tonight we don't know who was listening those online and those that are inside the church still going through paradigm shifts the devil wants to fight that but he can't stop it he didn't start it so he can't stop it so lord i pray that the word would reach its destination tonight and god that people would be able to hear what the holy spirit was speaking uh to them and god that a change would take place in their hearts and in their lives god as we prepare to leave this place but not your presence may we go fellowshipping on the word of god and may you come as the stranger in luke 24 may you come amongst us again father and and speak to us once again even as we're traveling home uh prepare our hearts lord for another day on tomorrow and and all the different events that'll be coming over the next few days and as we come back on sunday morning speak once more to us god we're careful to give you all the honor the glory and the praise is in jesus christ's name that we pray amen and amen hallelujah god bless you you can be seated amen the brothers will come at this time to dismiss you god bless you [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] you
