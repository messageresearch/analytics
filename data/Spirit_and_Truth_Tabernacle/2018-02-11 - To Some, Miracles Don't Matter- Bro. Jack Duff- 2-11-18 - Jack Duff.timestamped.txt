[31:34] testimony for the last couple of weeks I

[31:46] before then I was just really really
[31:48] sick I was in a bed the entire weekend
[31:50] and I said Lord that's that's not me not
[31:54] to even be able to get out of there to
[31:56] come to church but I was just so
[31:58] sickened so weak that I could not get up
[32:00] and Friday I was really extremely sick I
[32:05] mean just so sick that every bone in my
[32:08] body ate every bone I had an ingrown
[32:12] fingernail and I just pulled it out just
[32:14] normally pulled it up it aches so bad as
[32:16] if though somebody just took my fingers
[32:18] shut it up in a door and I got home
[32:21] really late Friday night and I knew we
[32:23] were having prayer and praise service
[32:25] and I said lord I don't want to miss
[32:27] this
[32:27] and I was talking to one of my
[32:29] colleagues on the way home we had a
[32:31] business adventure that we needed to go
[32:33] to on Saturday and he says why are you
[32:38] pressing your body so hard to just get
[32:40] up and go to church then inspired and
[32:42] ignited something in me and I said let
[32:44] me tell you something if God allowed me
[32:46] to get up this morning and stand on my
[32:48] own two feet I'm able to get up and go
[32:52] to church after I finish working
[32:53] throughout this entire day and I am so
[32:56] glad that I pressed my way to come on
[32:59] out to the house of the Lord and I was
[33:01] as I was praying and as we were entering
[33:03] in it was just such a wonderful
[33:05] anointing and such a wonderful blessed
[33:07] service for refilling and feeling and
[33:10] deliverance and healing and as hard as I
[33:13] was praying and hard as I was fighting
[33:15] to pray the harder the devil was just
[33:18] fighting me and just pressing me and I
[33:20] just stopped and I said our Lord let me

[33:25] and I'm not trying to overrule your
[33:27] authority but I'm praying for healing

[1:12:32] we've been having some really really
[1:12:34] wonderful services and stuff as of late
[1:12:36] just God just Minister into our hearts
[1:12:38] and like we in our own personal revival
[1:12:42] a man just I personally violently we
[1:12:45] thank for that
[1:12:47] today I have a sermon that's in my heart
[1:12:50] it might go against the grain a little
[1:12:53] bit but I hope that the Lord will just
[1:12:56] bring it out to us a man just something
[1:13:00] that he just kind of laid him a spirit I
[1:13:01] think I've hurt my daughter saying how
[1:13:04] she had multiple stalls that was in her
[1:13:05] heart to sing and it's the same way with
[1:13:09] a preacher sometimes you got two or
[1:13:11] three messages and you just don't know
[1:13:12] which one to go with and but you you
[1:13:15] know however the Lord wants to do things
[1:13:17] that's how you do things and and we just
[1:13:19] try to be obedient to that so I'm gonna
[1:13:23] read a scripture they're familiar
[1:13:25] passage of Scripture and I asked
[1:13:27] everyone to stand with me as we just
[1:13:28] read the Word of God and and then we
[1:13:31] will allow our pray and I'll let you be
[1:13:33] seated
[1:13:34] mark 16 verse 14 through 19 14 through
[1:13:40] 20 and man March 16 verse 14 through 20
[1:13:47] and says afterward he appeared unto the
[1:13:53] eleven as they sent at meat and abraded
[1:13:56] them with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:13:58] heart because they believed not them
[1:14:00] which had seen him after he was risen
[1:14:03] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:14:06] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:14:07] creature he that believeth and in his
[1:14:11] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:14:12] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:14:15] signs shall follow them that believe and
[1:14:17] my name should have cast out Devils they
[1:14:19] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:14:21] take up serpents and if they drink in a
[1:14:24] deadly thing it should not hurt them
[1:14:25] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:14:27] they shall recover so then after the
[1:14:30] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[1:14:32] received up into heaven and set on the
[1:14:34] right hand of God
[1:14:35] and they went forth and preached
[1:14:37] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:14:38] and confirming the word with signs
[1:14:41] following amen the Lord had a blessing
[1:14:44] to the reading of his word let's just
[1:14:45] pray over this father we thank you for
[1:14:49] the ability to read Scripture but we
[1:14:53] know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us
[1:14:54] deceive what it is that we have read so
[1:14:58] God as we would just develop a little
[1:15:00] thought here today and we present it we
[1:15:02] pray that the Holy Ghost would go before
[1:15:04] us and just make make it so clear to the
[1:15:07] people and that you got would just get
[1:15:09] all the glory and all the honor and all
[1:15:10] the praise from Lord what happens in
[1:15:14] this portion of service thank you for
[1:15:15] your spirit that's been here through the
[1:15:17] the worship and just the songs of Zion
[1:15:19] and God just the people in an atmosphere
[1:15:21] of praise and an adoration and now God
[1:15:24] what the word is certainly the most
[1:15:26] important thing that we need in order to
[1:15:28] overcome the enemies so god help us to
[1:15:30] receive revelation even right now is our
[1:15:33] prayer we take every spirit that is
[1:15:35] against the Spirit of God underneath the
[1:15:37] control of the Holy Spirit it's in Jesus
[1:15:39] name that we pray amen claim that God
[1:15:43] bless you can be seated
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:51] I'm going to use a title a man that
[1:15:58] might strike you a man a little
[1:16:01] different but I pray that it'll help us
[1:16:04] today the title is to some miracles
[1:16:08] don't matter and to some miracles don't
[1:16:17] matter they do not matter let's just
[1:16:20] kind of work our way through this to me
[1:16:24] this is a very controversial title to
[1:16:28] speak in the midst of believers because
[1:16:32] I've noted I'm standing in the midst of
[1:16:35] a group of people that do believe in
[1:16:37] miracles they do you can't tell them no
[1:16:42] different because they have experienced
[1:16:44] them their self it's impossible for you
[1:16:48] to tell them that God is not real when
[1:16:51] they have experienced the Living God
[1:16:53] they're not talking about a God of Bible
[1:16:56] days they're talking about a God that is
[1:16:59] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:17:03] if he did it in Scripture that he ought
[1:17:05] to be able to do it again today a man if
[1:17:08] he's not dead and yell alive then we
[1:17:10] ought to see the same same responses the
[1:17:13] same actions and reactions coming forth
[1:17:15] my Lord and Savior and and I know I'm
[1:17:17] standing in the midst of a group of
[1:17:19] people that have experienced that we
[1:17:21] have seen the healing power of God right
[1:17:24] here in our midst
[1:17:25] my own dad was healed of cancer a man
[1:17:29] sister Samantha was healed of cancer
[1:17:35] sister Tonya was healed of cancer if I
[1:17:40] could also save my friend brother Don
[1:17:42] was healed of cancer right where I'm
[1:17:47] standing in the midst of a group of
[1:17:49] people that know he's the same so so to
[1:17:52] tell them that miracles don't matter I
[1:17:54] would be a liar but that's why I titled
[1:17:57] it to some I'm not talking to you
[1:18:01] to some miracles don't matter
[1:18:05] hallelujah glory to God we you know III
[1:18:09] know that for myself a man and hearing
[1:18:13] the message of the hour the Lord uses
[1:18:16] prophet to to you know just to share
[1:18:20] different testimonies in and there's
[1:18:22] been various testimonies that that I've
[1:18:25] heard that have been a blessing to me
[1:18:27] that that disturbed my faith you know if
[1:18:30] God could do this 50 60 70 years ago
[1:18:33] then I know that God was still doing it
[1:18:35] even right now and and one of those
[1:18:37] things weren't when I heard the
[1:18:39] testimony of the lady in Memphis
[1:18:40] Tennessee right and and this this woman
[1:18:43] was reading in the Bible and and she she
[1:18:46] saw herself in the scripture and you
[1:18:48] know she said she had this you noticed
[1:18:50] one boy he took sick because he wasn't
[1:18:52] living right hallelujah amen and let me
[1:18:56] tell you sometimes your sickness is
[1:18:57] God's amen
[1:19:00] God's Way of getting your attention
[1:19:03] right because this board went living
[1:19:06] right and and and and and and with them
[1:19:08] not living right it his mama begin to
[1:19:10] pray for them and and and as my mother's
[1:19:12] prayers it's like she's like Lord I'm
[1:19:14] I'm your Shunammite I see myself in the
[1:19:16] scripture I'm the shooter my sin said
[1:19:18] but but where is your Elijah that was a
[1:19:21] prayer where is your life if I'm your
[1:19:23] shooting if I'm if I can see myself here
[1:19:25] there's different players in this
[1:19:28] portion of Scripture
[1:19:29] I see me but where's him right so so
[1:19:32] where it where is your Elijah and and as
[1:19:35] she's praying here a plane is flying
[1:19:37] over the top of her City
[1:19:39] I mean maybe 20,000 feet up I don't know
[1:19:43] how it is but as the plane is
[1:19:45] approaching Memphis God's not got an
[1:19:48] answer to your question you want to know
[1:19:50] where my Elijah is I'm getting ready to
[1:19:52] drop is playing right into your city and
[1:19:55] God calls that plane to come down with
[1:19:58] mechanical issues just the answer one
[1:20:01] lady's prayer everybody else had to get
[1:20:05] off the plane
[1:20:07] everybody had to be inconvenience are

[1:20:13] be put up in a hotel for a night every
[1:20:16] everybody else had the delayed way Emily
[1:20:18] was going to because God was concerned
[1:20:22] about one person's prayer wait wait wait
[1:20:27] wait wait wait you're like she had no
[1:20:28] idea playing that come down and here she
[1:20:31] is sitting there praying and then the

[1:23:21] so see these testimonies that God was
[1:23:24] giving through His Prophet was something
[1:23:25] to anoint our faith we believe in
[1:23:28] miracles we believe in miracles let me
[1:23:33] go on a little further here you know I
[1:23:35] was I was thinking you know you all know
[1:23:37] the testimony of John Ryan a man and
[1:23:39] what a powerful testimony let was this
[1:23:41] man was blind and and and he's out there
[1:23:44] selling newspapers and you know and it
[1:23:47] come through the prayer line and got
[1:23:48] prayed for about a prophet and and and
[1:23:51] here he was prayed for and and brother
[1:23:53] Branham and told him his condition he
[1:23:54] said yeah I believe and he went off the
[1:23:56] platform and just you know think about
[1:23:57] first healing or whatever but he got a
[1:23:59] little confused before he got his
[1:24:00] healing and he come back to the prayer
[1:24:02] line I made it a couple days later said
[1:24:04] now I thought you told me brother
[1:24:06] Branham that I was healed and brother
[1:24:08] Branham said I thought you said that you
[1:24:10] believed so there was a little
[1:24:14] disconnect between are you saying and
[1:24:16] I'm healing and me saying I believe
[1:24:18] that's a disconnect here what do I need
[1:24:20] to fix this problem he saying say I'll
[1:24:22] tell you what to do God is already
[1:24:24] pronounce your healing sort of thing for
[1:24:26] you to do right now is beginning to
[1:24:27] thank God for your healing and slow
[1:24:30] viola in that process
[1:24:32] right now will you need to start
[1:24:33] thanking God for what he can't read it
[1:24:36] is you
[1:24:37] he's already pronounced that it will be
[1:24:40] done now you need to start taking him
[1:24:42] for it being tongue
[1:24:44] you ain't gonna wait there to happen
[1:24:46] before you give them praise you can
[1:24:49] start placing him right now
[1:24:54] so John Ryan said I got it I got it put
[1:24:57] down this rosary beefs and if salmon
[1:25:00] just stop hanging out I ain't got to sit
[1:25:01] there and pray with no rules or be some
[1:25:03] of this Lord
[1:25:03] lord I thank you for healing me so as
[1:25:05] they stood out there with its newspaper
[1:25:07] and they start giving that to different
[1:25:09] people say extra extra read all about it
[1:25:11] by stripes I'm healed he added something
[1:25:15] else to the newspaper adds extra extra
[1:25:18] read all about it
[1:25:19] by His stripes I'm healed and it just
[1:25:22] kept saying over and over for weeks he
[1:25:24] went on saying this and then it went
[1:25:27] through the barber one day has sat down
[1:25:29] in a chair and the barber began to try
[1:25:31] to reason with them the Bible say man
[1:25:34] you you causin shame to come on the on
[1:25:38] on the gospel of Jesus Christ you talk
[1:25:40] about God is heal you and you ain't
[1:25:42] healed you still blind you got to stop
[1:25:44] talking like that junk judge I said no
[1:25:47] no I'm not gonna stop talking like that
[1:25:48] I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you
[1:25:50] just like I tell them extra extra read
[1:25:52] all about it by its stripes I'm healed I
[1:25:55] like this because one time you gonna say
[1:25:58] that the right time one time they're
[1:26:01] nautical strike what you saying
[1:26:03] hallelujah and when the northen struck
[1:26:06] John Ryan he jumped up at the barber's
[1:26:09] chair took off running down the street
[1:26:11] yeah hold on its faith extra extra read
[1:26:15] all about it
[1:26:16] biased writes I am he
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:19] bah bah chasing them down the street
[1:26:22] turn you're gonna get hit by calm no no
[1:26:24] you don't get it I just got here while I
[1:26:27] was in the Poppa chair see to him
[1:26:32] miracle mattered but to some miracles
[1:26:35] don't matter
[1:26:36] Oh God let me read something here for
[1:26:40] you
[1:26:40] Laurie to God out of the message
[1:26:42] expectancy a man who say well isn't it
[1:26:46] strange look at Simeon the Holy Ghost
[1:26:50] promised him you're not going to see
[1:26:52] death till you see the Christ why they
[1:26:56] said David look for him and this one
[1:26:57] look for him and that one look for him
[1:26:59] no matter what they look for no matter
[1:27:02] what they look for him the Holy Ghost
[1:27:03] has told me so he was expecting to see
[1:27:06] him he didn't care what people said he
[1:27:08] was expecting when Jesus was born in
[1:27:12] Judea in Bethlehem there were a few
[1:27:14] stargazers seated across a scene cross
[1:27:16] observatory but stylistics none of the
[1:27:20] men at the observatory of the
[1:27:21] planetarium they didn't see it they know
[1:27:24] nothing about it but my Bible said they
[1:27:26] followed a star
[1:27:27] I believe it they see that it was for
[1:27:29] them divine healing today is not for the
[1:27:34] unbeliever is for those who believe the
[1:27:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit today is not
[1:27:41] for the unbelievers it's for those who
[1:27:44] believe Jesus died for believers not for
[1:27:48] unbelievers it's for those who believe
[1:27:51] the supernatural foes whose supernatural
[1:27:55] mindette you give the supernatural
[1:28:00] follow those at a supernatural mind ed
[1:28:04] come on church amen that the
[1:28:08] supernatural follows through
[1:28:09] supernatural magnet that's right when
[1:28:11] the husband and thurston when you got an
[1:28:14] expectancy when you read God's Word
[1:28:17] expect to see God before what he said he
[1:28:19] would do God will do it that's why
[1:28:23] that's why I precious sister Michelle
[1:28:25] could come here on Friday night being
[1:28:27] attacked all day but she expecting God
[1:28:29] to do something and when she got here
[1:28:31] did exactly what he said he would do and
[1:28:33] every time the devil come that reminder
[1:28:36] more God already did
[1:28:38] hallelujah somebody see I was thinking
[1:28:41] on this as I was in Israel back in
[1:28:45] November we were we were there in the in
[1:28:51] the garden of gethsemane
[1:28:52] and as I was just kind of you know
[1:28:54] standing there at in the garden of
[1:28:56] gethsemane just kind of brother brother
[1:28:58] George was giving a little devotion and
[1:29:00] and he was just kind of talking about
[1:29:03] some things there in the Garden of
[1:29:04] Gethsemane and I was just it just kind
[1:29:05] of hit my mama and I believe he might
[1:29:07] have said this statement to some
[1:29:09] miracles don't matter and I've said well
[1:29:11] you know that that's that's really
[1:29:12] something when you really think about
[1:29:13] that because in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:29:15] there was a miracle that took place and
[1:29:19] it didn't matter right yeah it
[1:29:22] absolutely did not matter here this man
[1:29:26] you know they come up with this scheme
[1:29:28] that they gonna get Jesus they ready to
[1:29:30] kill him right they they gotta find them
[1:29:32] in and and for some reason I can't tell
[1:29:35] the reason because the Sunday School
[1:29:37] class might get it but for some reason
[1:29:39] they didn't know who Jesus was some
[1:29:43] reason they needed help trying to figure
[1:29:44] out who Jesus was
[1:29:46] so the acts are you know that they made
[1:29:48] a little deal with a man with Judas and
[1:29:51] Judas they the one that I kiss my god
[1:29:55] how high is it that they even amongst of
[1:29:57] this cycles they could not recognize who
[1:30:01] Jesus was
[1:30:05] because the disciples were doing some of
[1:30:07] the same things he was doing and if they
[1:30:13] were confused in that day Sydnee also be
[1:30:18] confused today come on somebody they
[1:30:23] should be confused right now as to who
[1:30:25] Jesus is because I see him in you am i
[1:30:29] see him in here
[1:30:30] Am I
[1:30:32] everywhere I turn I see Jesus here they
[1:30:39] are wandering so now how we gonna be
[1:30:41] able to tell which one is Jesus so Judas
[1:30:45] said I tell you what I'm gonna betray
[1:30:46] him with the kiss and the one that I
[1:30:47] walk up to and I give them a kiss that's
[1:30:49] how you're gonna know this is the woman
[1:30:51] and here you know they walk up and Judas
[1:30:55] gives this great kiss of betrayal and in
[1:30:59] the disciples say Lord what you want us
[1:31:01] to do you want us to fight with a smart
[1:31:03] and Peter before he can even get an
[1:31:05] answer from Jesus took the slow light
[1:31:08] and just went whacking now the Bible say
[1:31:13] cut the man's ear off now I don't know
[1:31:16] about you but if I had a sword this
[1:31:20] close to my hand
[1:31:21] and then it got my ear miracles would
[1:31:26] matter it would matter to me but rather
[1:31:32] than this man I made it here here to
[1:31:34] hear his ears off on the ground maybe
[1:31:36] gravitylight long and then Jesus just
[1:31:38] stopped the battle everybody put your
[1:31:39] swords down reach down and pick up the
[1:31:42] man here and just put it back on life
[1:31:49] but this man when his ear just being
[1:31:53] healed
[1:31:57] this man's okay now we're going to take
[1:31:59] you to Pilate
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:04] I'll get this man to that me that day I
[1:32:17] don't know about y'all but I'm talking
[1:32:20] about me
[1:32:21] this man chest heal my ear I was this
[1:32:26] close to death whoever side of my mom
[1:32:36] on pilots I'm here I am you know coming
[1:32:38] to take this man to his to his death but
[1:32:41] he just think saved me from my death
[1:32:44] it's a shame but to some miracles don't
[1:32:50] matter
[1:32:52] stay with me here today
[1:32:55] glory to God it should have mattered to
[1:32:58] to now cos that's his name his name was
[1:33:00] Malchus it should have mattered to him
[1:33:02] but it didn't matter to him see I want
[1:33:05] you to understand the supernatural does
[1:33:08] not impact everybody the same way see
[1:33:13] the supernatural only follows those has
[1:33:15] a supernatural in mind it if you're not
[1:33:19] expecting supernatural you'll never see
[1:33:21] supernatural oh my god
[1:33:25] I believe the Songwriters say that we
[1:33:27] are we are supernatural beings having a
[1:33:29] natural experience they don't even know
[1:33:32] what they're talking about but we are
[1:33:34] supernatural beings having a natural
[1:33:36] spirit we come from God we go back to
[1:33:38] God hallelujah our God is supernatural
[1:33:41] so so soon I mean we've never even heard
[1:33:44] of anything supernatural once we see it
[1:33:46] something strikes on the inside and we
[1:33:49] identify with that look at this oh my
[1:33:54] let me let me let me let me let me yeah
[1:33:57] let me let me skip down to something
[1:33:58] here oh my see the supernatural doesn't
[1:34:01] impact everybody the same way I want to
[1:34:03] come back to that in a second let me
[1:34:05] read it something out of Jesus at the
[1:34:07] door the sermon Jesus at the door look
[1:34:09] at this Oh God stay with me here today
[1:34:12] what I mean it should have mattered to
[1:34:15] this man going through such a close
[1:34:19] experience now I'm not wondering how
[1:34:20] many people have been this close to
[1:34:22] death this close and you ain't start
[1:34:26] serving God yet I mean you know and even
[1:34:31] thought about going to a church and to
[1:34:33] be the first one said what God spared me
[1:34:34] from this what why did he spare you what
[1:34:39] was the prayer I didn't he take you at
[1:34:40] that time look at it Jesus that the door
[1:34:46] says if that ain't the condition of the
[1:34:47] church today God showing Billy Graham
[1:34:49] or robbers great signs and wonders and
[1:34:51] the church says that's not my
[1:34:52] denomination just there become
[1:34:54] spiritually insane just stare oh this is
[1:34:57] my church that's not the science that
[1:35:00] follows a believer they listen to their
[1:35:02] church and forget the Spirit of God that
[1:35:04] makes you act christ-like that makes you
[1:35:06] love him and believe him
[1:35:08] but what's happened their eyes are
[1:35:09] blinded they can't you say I have 20/20
[1:35:12] but you see the blindness he's talking
[1:35:14] about is spiritual blindness and fella
[1:35:17] said to me some time ago of a certain
[1:35:19] church that don't believe that they say
[1:35:21] they speak where the Bible speaks and
[1:35:23] silent where it's silent and I said well
[1:35:24] sir what about a certain he said I don't
[1:35:27] care what you say mr. Branum I don't
[1:35:30] believe it I said I it wasn't made for
[1:35:33] unbelievers it wasn't sent to
[1:35:35] unbelievers it was sent to those who
[1:35:36] believe you're an unbeliever and what a
[1:35:39] pitiful you shape you are that the
[1:35:42] devil has blinded you he said to me
[1:35:44] smack me blind then I said you're
[1:35:47] already blind sir
[1:35:48] he said my eyesight perfect I said but
[1:35:52] your spiritual sight he said oh oh
[1:35:54] blindness means your regular eyes so he
[1:35:58] took them to the Bible it says I said
[1:35:59] what about Elijah down at Dothan that
[1:36:02] day when they woke up that morning in
[1:36:03] the series have surrounded the army have
[1:36:05] surrounded the city to come in and get
[1:36:07] Elijah because he was telling their
[1:36:09] secrets and so forth and they hated him
[1:36:11] and gauzy woke up and said oh my father
[1:36:13] said looking here the series has a hole
[1:36:15] a city surrounded and we're in the
[1:36:16] middle of them and they lie shouldn't
[1:36:18] that old prophet raised up and rubbed
[1:36:20] his eyes he says but there's more with
[1:36:22] us than there is with them I love that
[1:36:26] so you got to be able to see that you
[1:36:29] got to see that greater is He that is in
[1:36:32] you than he that is in the world greater
[1:36:37] is show God in the midst of that trouble
[1:36:41] then the devil that you see running
[1:36:43] roughshod hallelujah he said you wrote a
[1:36:48] lot but there's more with us than with
[1:36:49] him Ghazi look around said I don't see
[1:36:51] nothing nobody but you and I
[1:36:54] he said God open this boy's eyes not
[1:36:59] evidently the boy was seeing but he was
[1:37:02] missing something it was a different
[1:37:06] eyes like that the boy needed if he ever
[1:37:09] played up open his eyes he just saw the
[1:37:12] Syrian army he just saw the Prophet but
[1:37:16] what was he missing and I'm praying the
[1:37:20] Kaaba open our spiritual eyes that we
[1:37:22] will see the things that we're missing
[1:37:26] he says he said and he says our God open
[1:37:30] this boy's eyes and when his eyes come
[1:37:31] open around that old prophet stirred
[1:37:33] angels of fire and chariots of fire by
[1:37:36] the millions
[1:37:38] Sica hozy was blind and then he said
[1:37:42] come go with me
[1:37:43] now these a day actually the Syrian army
[1:37:46] can see - and here they come into live
[1:37:48] today looking for Elijah they get two
[1:37:51] lives you and then they X they actually
[1:37:54] said do you know where he lives
[1:37:57] they're looking for Elijah they get to
[1:38:00] your lives and they asked do you know
[1:38:02] where Elijah is they were blind look at
[1:38:06] this and then he said come go with me he
[1:38:07] walked out to the chief captain and
[1:38:10] raised up his hands he went to the Gator
[1:38:12] said Lord smite them blind and he walked
[1:38:14] out to the chief captain sent are you
[1:38:16] looking for Elijah say yes sir we are
[1:38:19] said come follow me I'll take you to him
[1:38:20] here Elijah is leading them the one that
[1:38:24] they looking for is leading them but
[1:38:26] they blind and can't see them laugh they
[1:38:29] able to follow
[1:38:34] they can see some things but not all
[1:38:36] things and what we're trying to do is
[1:38:39] get the church to be able to see all
[1:38:41] things you make decisions on your
[1:38:45] partial sight but when God can open up
[1:38:50] your full sight you'll make different
[1:38:53] decisions so that take you to them it
[1:39:00] says it says I'll take I'll take I'll
[1:39:02] take you to blind and looking right at
[1:39:04] them blind at seeing Elijah that's what
[1:39:07] it is tonight to church what that's what
[1:39:09] it is tonight to church God be merciful
[1:39:11] they're blind know that Jesus Christ is
[1:39:14] here on earth today the same that he was
[1:39:16] yesterday and will be forever they're
[1:39:18] spiritually blind they don't know that
[1:39:20] the devil has blinded them now that's
[1:39:25] what you know revelation 3 tells us that
[1:39:27] the church would be in that condition
[1:39:28] that they blind and not even realize
[1:39:30] that they were blind they can see
[1:39:31] certain things but they're not seeing
[1:39:33] the whole thing can go further in
[1:39:37] Christianity there's people that can see
[1:39:40] certain things in Scripture but not able
[1:39:42] to see the entire thing oh my so that's
[1:39:48] a heavy statement right because you know
[1:39:50] like you know just baptism in the name
[1:39:53] of the Lord Jesus Christ versus baptism
[1:39:55] in the name of Father Son and the titles
[1:39:57] Father Son the Holy Ghost
[1:39:58] right I mean they can see Jesus said
[1:40:01] that but what what was the name of the
[1:40:03] Father what was the name of the son what
[1:40:05] was the name of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:06] it was Lord Jesus Christ so that Peter
[1:40:08] didn't have it wrong Peter had it right
[1:40:10] he had a revelation of what Jesus saying
[1:40:14] and let me tell you something you'll
[1:40:15] never understand God's Bible without
[1:40:17] revelation you're gonna be reading the
[1:40:21] Bible from cover to cover and never
[1:40:23] understand what you read unless God give
[1:40:25] you a revelation alright so what I'm
[1:40:29] what I'm getting you to see here a man
[1:40:31] here this man approaching the Prophet
[1:40:34] said smite me blind smite me blind and
[1:40:36] you know to him miracles didn't matter
[1:40:38] you like no matter what you do no matter
[1:40:40] how many people get healed I'm not gonna
[1:40:42] change the way I think I'm not going to
[1:40:44] change the way that I am it's a person
[1:40:46] that doesn't matter but when you run
[1:40:48] into a person like that that's when you
[1:40:49] realize these times will follow them
[1:40:51] that believe not them that disbelief hey
[1:40:55] man I love the way the Prophet handle
[1:40:57] himself when he ran into situations like
[1:40:58] this he just kind of it's not for you
[1:41:00] it's only for believers glory to God let
[1:41:02] me go a little further here see if the
[1:41:04] supernatural doesn't impact everybody
[1:41:07] the same way I think about Elijah when
[1:41:11] he stood out there with the prophets of
[1:41:13] Bill and when he said he said now you
[1:41:16] know what we tired of y'all halting
[1:41:18] between two opinions we go we gotta
[1:41:20] figure out who gonna be gods of Israel
[1:41:22] right here I'm serving the God of Israel
[1:41:25] and y'all serving baled and all this
[1:41:27] they say Ahab you don't introduce all
[1:41:29] this stuff because you know I married
[1:41:31] the wrong woman all right it happen era
[1:41:34] Jezebel you say you should've never did
[1:41:36] that you know marry her now not her the
[1:41:39] thing that she worship or the gods that
[1:41:41] she worship not even they all inside
[1:41:43] Israel and you know our God is a jealous
[1:41:46] God
[1:41:47] you don't want he don't want no other
[1:41:48] God before I'm saying now we got all the
[1:41:49] sin now we're gonna have a showdown
[1:41:51] today the god that asks about fire let
[1:41:54] him be God they all agree to say yeah
[1:41:56] okay got the next best fat little be God
[1:41:58] and when it went out there and a man and
[1:42:01] they begin to set up the altars Elijah
[1:42:03] had invited 850 you go back and read 850
[1:42:08] were invited at 400 prophets of the go
[1:42:09] groves 450 amen a bale but when that
[1:42:13] when they came to the showdown only the
[1:42:14] 450 prophets showed up the other four
[1:42:17] kept eating at the table of Jezebel
[1:42:19] another 400 they kept eating at the
[1:42:21] table of Jezebel but he invited 850 one
[1:42:25] man willing to stand against 850 he knew
[1:42:31] his God he knew his God was a God that
[1:42:34] worked miracles and here he was standing
[1:42:37] there and the 450 shows they okay we
[1:42:39] believe so you know we'll start we'll
[1:42:42] put up our offering and we put up our
[1:42:45] all truth and you put up your altar we
[1:42:47] agree in the god that ends on fire
[1:42:48] that's gonna be the God of Israel they
[1:42:50] got out there in the morning time and
[1:42:52] they set up their their altar and
[1:42:54] nothing happened with their prayer
[1:42:56] oh my had a prayer meeting and nothing
[1:42:59] happening
[1:43:00] amen when we afraid we want to see God
[1:43:03] do something right they had a prayer
[1:43:05] meeting and nothing happened and because
[1:43:07] nothing happened it got a little excited
[1:43:09] they begin to take lancets and cut
[1:43:11] themselves in and bleeding all over the
[1:43:13] Alton just trying to get their God to do
[1:43:15] something
[1:43:16] Elisha looked at him say y'all a lot of
[1:43:17] scream a little hard a nice eight it's
[1:43:19] 450 are already crying out cry and do
[1:43:23] more to try to get his attention he's
[1:43:25] just picking at well the evening time
[1:43:28] was coming to God God's in a many lies
[1:43:31] it down then he had his altar built in
[1:43:33] the evening time and that the evening
[1:43:34] sacrifice this is when he takes me
[1:43:36] Elijah and they say now now I want you
[1:43:38] to later all to a certain way I want you
[1:43:40] to dig a trench around the altar I want
[1:43:42] you to pull water in there three times I
[1:43:44] want you to do it exactly the way I told
[1:43:46] you to do and one man standing that
[1:43:48] gives 450 did exactly what God told him
[1:43:51] to do in a God that answer by fire came
[1:43:54] down and consumed the sacrifice that
[1:43:59] should have settle things in Israel when
[1:44:02] God did that you know the children is
[1:44:04] ready to begin you go back and look at
[1:44:05] it and first Kings 18 maybe in the turn
[1:44:08] back to God some of them was turning
[1:44:09] back but there was one that I know of in
[1:44:12] particular it didn't matter to her so
[1:44:16] how the miracle didn't matter
[1:44:18] Jezebel her husband home so she said you
[1:44:21] know of the day when 450 promised a bear
[1:44:25] came and I hate the taking and I'm with
[1:44:28] us no more now that after God answered
[1:44:31] by fire then Elijah took him all down he
[1:44:33] slayed them all
[1:44:34] I saw the spot waste later he took him
[1:44:37] down to the river he killed him 450 of
[1:44:40] them bent and and he told her the whole
[1:44:43] testimony how God answered by fire but
[1:44:46] high response tomorrow I'm gonna have
[1:44:49] his head just like he had their hand it
[1:44:51] showed that to her a miracle did not
[1:44:54] matter I don't care what God do I'm not
[1:44:58] going for that you know and you gonna
[1:45:00] run into people like this that something
[1:45:01] sometimes you know we always feel like
[1:45:04] man I think it's that see the power God
[1:45:06] just some people it does not matter
[1:45:13] well I'm glad that's not me
[1:45:18] cuz it matters to me and here's what I
[1:45:22] believe about miracles I believe
[1:45:24] miracles are used to attract the
[1:45:27] attention of the believer
[1:45:29] Moses was attracted by the miracle of
[1:45:31] the burning bush
[1:45:33] the disciples were attracted to the
[1:45:36] feeding of five thousand and four
[1:45:37] thousand and seeing a man say peace
[1:45:39] peace feel to a wind and waves I mean
[1:45:43] they were attracted to these miracles
[1:45:46] Church the very things that we've seen
[1:45:48] God doing his property different
[1:45:49] testimonies that we've heard we've been
[1:45:51] attracted to this message a man
[1:45:53] it's the supernatural that we heard that
[1:45:55] actually attracted our attention but now
[1:45:57] once God gets your attention there's a
[1:45:59] voice behind the sign and he wants to
[1:46:02] speak to you can I tell you something
[1:46:05] the reason that that miracles matter to
[1:46:08] us and I don't have time to read it but
[1:46:12] you'll find it in the book of Matthew
[1:46:14] chapter 15 and what happened in Matthew
[1:46:17] chapter 15 verse 23 to 28 we won't read
[1:46:20] all of this but but what happened was
[1:46:21] that there was a woman that approached
[1:46:24] the Lord Jesus and as she was coming to
[1:46:27] Jesus she had a daughter that was sick
[1:46:30] and should be in the prayer I'm just
[1:46:32] beginning approach dorset lord please
[1:46:34] you know I'm coming on behalf of my
[1:46:36] daughter with you would you do something
[1:46:37] for my daughter would you well you know
[1:46:39] it she says she believed in the
[1:46:41] supernatural and not not now not now now
[1:46:44] now as she approached you know she like
[1:46:46] Laura I really I I need you to do
[1:46:49] something and that's as s as she's
[1:46:51] approaching Jesus Jesus begin to tell us
[1:46:53] say now not now your people are dogs and
[1:46:56] we were not sent to the dogs I was sent
[1:47:00] to dogs I'm sent to the lost sheep of
[1:47:02] Israel but not to not to dogs and when
[1:47:05] she heard that rather than heard getting
[1:47:06] offended
[1:47:07] she should she see she had a different
[1:47:09] attitude and she said she said you're
[1:47:12] right Lord that you might sit the dog
[1:47:14] but you say
[1:47:16] even the dogs she say even the dog
[1:47:21] should get a crumb from the master's
[1:47:24] table right in which when she said that
[1:47:27] it just it just shook Jesus same woman
[1:47:31] great is your thing you can have what
[1:47:34] you're asking for not even Jesus could
[1:47:39] shake that lady's face
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:46] see the devil can do a lot to try to
[1:47:49] shake our faith but when Jesus speaks
[1:47:51] and says that I'm not said to your
[1:47:54] people not even Jesus could shake her
[1:47:59] face
[1:48:01] jesus said great is your faith great is
[1:48:04] your faith this is he'd say this is what
[1:48:06] I'm talking about this what I'm looking
[1:48:07] for and they told her statement he said
[1:48:12] I'm not sent to your you know your
[1:48:15] people says I'm sent to the lost sheep
[1:48:17] of Israel and he also said they say
[1:48:19] he'll healing is that is the children's
[1:48:24] brand this don't belong to you this is
[1:48:28] for the to see so what I'm saying is
[1:48:29] that meant to some miracle something
[1:48:31] don't matter because healing is for the
[1:48:34] children and maybe maybe you might not
[1:48:41] be a child because if you're a child of
[1:48:43] God you got won't healing because
[1:48:46] healing is the children's bread then we
[1:48:53] get we rejoice when we see God do things
[1:48:57] hallelujah somebody wee wee wee wee wee
[1:49:00] wee that caused a shot to come on when
[1:49:04] we see God do things all right let me
[1:49:06] read something here out of paradox this
[1:49:08] is why you know I mean I mean just I
[1:49:10] said to some but not to me right it
[1:49:12] matters to me I thank God for what he
[1:49:15] does I thank God for him proving himself
[1:49:17] to be the same yesterday today and
[1:49:19] forever
[1:49:20] Oh glory to God let's read something
[1:49:24] here out of paradox
[1:49:27] since that now billions probably give
[1:49:29] out some prayer cards which I think yeah
[1:49:32] I told him to and I believe he told me a
[1:49:34] while ago that he said somewhere along
[1:49:37] I'll call a few to the prayer line after
[1:49:39] a while to be prayed for and if your car
[1:49:41] does not call and it's called rather and
[1:49:43] you're not sure that God is the healer
[1:49:44] and he is going to heal you it won't do
[1:49:48] no good to come up here because you
[1:49:50] won't be healed you if there's one
[1:49:53] question you say well now if there's
[1:49:55] something in my life I really ought to
[1:49:56] straighten this up you go make that
[1:49:58] right first and then come back to the
[1:50:00] prayer line see because healing is the
[1:50:02] children's branch we realize that it is
[1:50:06] in the atonement and the atonement first
[1:50:08] is applied to our souls and healing has
[1:50:11] always will run every message and it's
[1:50:14] also been a means to gather people
[1:50:17] together let me just stop right there
[1:50:19] just for a second but see healing four
[1:50:23] runs every message and it's also a means
[1:50:26] to gather people together decide God
[1:50:28] gets you attention it's through healing
[1:50:32] let you know that he's the same
[1:50:34] yesterday that there forever it's
[1:50:35] through healing I'm you can put that
[1:50:39] down for a second but but what happened
[1:50:41] amen there was a time and brother
[1:50:43] branham's ministry where he was the
[1:50:46] angel lot was kind of telling him about
[1:50:47] different different phases of his
[1:50:49] ministry and you know and and and he
[1:50:52] said there was a time where he went out
[1:50:53] and he was he saw some some man fishings
[1:50:56] a vision that he was looking at saying
[1:50:57] he started been fishing and they were
[1:50:59] fished and they say he saw some some
[1:51:01] there was they catch a little fish here
[1:51:02] a little fish there and they catching
[1:51:04] this they catching it he says but he saw
[1:51:06] some rainbow trout and they say now now
[1:51:09] the rainbow trout he said I think I can
[1:51:11] catch them now I'm not just trying to
[1:51:14] catch a little fish here and a little
[1:51:16] fish there I'm going after the big stuff
[1:51:19] so so as he was looking there you know
[1:51:22] and the angel beginning to tell him say
[1:51:23] now you know as he was explaining to
[1:51:25] them the different pools and it's
[1:51:26] michellene out now don't try to explain
[1:51:28] to these brothers what you're doing
[1:51:30] don't try to do that because you're just
[1:51:31] gonna make a big mess out of it right so
[1:51:33] he said he'd say wet fish and he said
[1:51:35] now now he told him out you know jerk it
[1:51:37] this way and jerk it that way and do a
[1:51:39] little bit of this and do a little bit
[1:51:40] of that say but
[1:51:41] try to explain I listen and brother
[1:51:42] branham got out there and start fishing
[1:51:44] in the vision and the brother said oh
[1:51:46] yeah you can do it we know you can catch
[1:51:48] one and he got all puffed up in the
[1:51:51] vision Oh glory we got to watch that a
[1:51:54] man because pride come before a great
[1:51:56] fall don't allow the devil to get you
[1:51:59] pumped up stay humble lorry to God and
[1:52:04] the more you stay humble the more God
[1:52:05] will lift you up but as soon as you
[1:52:07] think you don't do something on your own
[1:52:09] God got away bring you right back down
[1:52:12] hallelujah somebody right so here he's
[1:52:15] in the kitchen and then the brother said
[1:52:17] oh you can do this you just start
[1:52:18] fishing and just grinning it and let's
[1:52:20] say he didn't do nothing that the angel
[1:52:22] the Lord told to he caught a fish but it
[1:52:24] was so small in the vision say that's
[1:52:28] that fish swallow the whole look and
[1:52:30] said man this is uh that the angel walk
[1:52:33] around him with his own arms photos
[1:52:35] saying that you didn't do not one thing
[1:52:37] I told you to do if you want to catch
[1:52:39] the big fish you're gonna have to do it
[1:52:41] this way now what was he saying
[1:52:43] God knew the big fish was us the big
[1:52:47] fish was us and let me tell you it one
[1:52:50] just I mean the message God used that
[1:52:52] the the miracles and the signs that want
[1:52:55] us to get our attention but the message
[1:52:58] was when the word was being revealed
[1:53:00] right when the word began to open up in
[1:53:03] that beginner you know make sense us
[1:53:06] that's when God got our attention we
[1:53:08] were a rainbow trout we were the big
[1:53:10] fish that God was looking for and if
[1:53:14] you're gonna get them you're gonna have
[1:53:16] to do it a certain way
[1:53:17] hallelujah see healing is the children's
[1:53:22] Brent see the summit don't matter but to
[1:53:24] me it matters it matters
[1:53:26] he said healing it I'm going back to the
[1:53:28] quote because healing is a children's
[1:53:30] bring we realize that it's in the
[1:53:32] atonement and the atonement first is
[1:53:34] applied to our souls and healing as
[1:53:36] always for run every message and it's
[1:53:38] always also been a means to gather
[1:53:40] people together and many people will
[1:53:43] sponsor a healing meeting many will come
[1:53:46] to a healing meeting or to a song
[1:53:49] festival now you know that number the
[1:53:50] truth you tell somebody you having a
[1:53:53] prayer line service folk come from every
[1:53:54] but we're looking for it to stick but we
[1:53:59] have to use that debate people will do
[1:54:01] will use that debate people because
[1:54:03] after God give you your healing he
[1:54:06] touched it go and sin no more so if you
[1:54:09] don't even have to be a Christian to get
[1:54:12] a healing I just saw that it happened I
[1:54:15] ain't gonna tell you all everything but
[1:54:17] it just happened you don't even have to
[1:54:19] be a Christian to get it healing but if
[1:54:22] you want to keep your healing you got to
[1:54:25] become a Christian all right let me go
[1:54:29] on says many people sponsor healing me
[1:54:31] the minute will come to healing me nor
[1:54:32] the song fester but when it comes to a
[1:54:34] poor lost soul to get saved there's not
[1:54:36] many people interested in that but
[1:54:39] that's the that's the main thing divine
[1:54:41] healing and singing festivals and so
[1:54:43] forth as brother Bosworth Easter say
[1:54:45] it's bait on the hook and you show the
[1:54:47] fish the bait not the hook and that's
[1:54:51] just a thing to get people to listen a
[1:54:53] while so you can really present to them
[1:54:56] your message see the healing and all
[1:54:58] that is just to get the people in so you
[1:55:00] can present to them your message
[1:55:02] God has did that in every age through
[1:55:05] every age there's always been a healing
[1:55:07] campaign and if it's a genuine healing
[1:55:09] campaign behind that campaign always is
[1:55:12] a message there never is a sign given
[1:55:16] just for sign it's for running a message
[1:55:19] and I believe the same thing is 17 years
[1:55:23] ago 18 years now that the Lord sent me
[1:55:25] out to start praying for the sick I made
[1:55:27] a great revival amongst the people many
[1:55:29] great servants of God has went forth in
[1:55:31] healing campaigns and but the healing
[1:55:33] campaign in itself if you still stay in
[1:55:35] the same old trend of what you always
[1:55:37] was there is something wrong that
[1:55:40] healing campaign wasn't sent from that
[1:55:42] healing campaign wasn't it from God it's
[1:55:44] got to attract attention first see get
[1:55:48] the attention and then there's a message
[1:55:51] Jesus when he came forth healing the
[1:55:53] sick and so forth he was a great prophet
[1:55:55] to all of them but when he began to tell
[1:55:57] them the truth of the gospel who he was
[1:55:59] and what he come for he was not popular
[1:56:03] after that see when he starts saying eat
[1:56:04] my flesh and drink my blood
[1:56:06] no part with me that's that's shook them
[1:56:08] right before then there was outcast not
[1:56:10] Devils and it was coming back rejoicing
[1:56:11] and Jesus even at the tone say stop
[1:56:14] reducing that the Devils are subject to
[1:56:16] you he said but rejoice because your
[1:56:19] name is written in heaven glory to God
[1:56:24] look look at this he says he was not
[1:56:26] popped after that and that's the way it
[1:56:27] has been through every age and it will
[1:56:30] continue that way see for some miracles
[1:56:34] don't matter but for me it does matter
[1:56:38] seeing what the Prophet was told by the
[1:56:41] angel when he was you know it kind of
[1:56:43] taken him through that tenth vision and
[1:56:45] some of the things that happened before
[1:56:46] the tip vision as he was just trying to
[1:56:48] you know explain to people say I told
[1:56:50] you don't don't explain this he said you
[1:56:51] cannot teach Pentecostal babies
[1:56:55] supernatural things you can't teach them
[1:56:57] that understand what happens that church
[1:57:00] will run into people where you know you
[1:57:02] won't be able to teach them certain
[1:57:03] things they can they can go so far they
[1:57:05] can see so much but then they can't see
[1:57:08] the rest of it God trying to get people
[1:57:10] that can see the whole thing and walking
[1:57:13] all of it not just the supernatural
[1:57:15] miracles but the supernatural word Oh
[1:57:19] glory to God alright let me uh let me
[1:57:22] just kind of share a couple miracles
[1:57:24] here with you that just blessed me and
[1:57:26] then I want to end it up a man with one
[1:57:29] last quote to some miracles don't matter
[1:57:31] but to me it does cuz I'm a believer I'm
[1:57:35] a believer let's look at a couple of
[1:57:37] miracles here are the expectations a man
[1:57:40] look at this now just so that you know
[1:57:44] when it comes to miracles some of them
[1:57:48] happen immediately and some of them
[1:57:51] happened over a span of time they don't
[1:57:54] matter how long it take it's still a
[1:57:56] miracle and a miracle is something
[1:58:00] that's out of the ordinary oh my god
[1:58:04] it's not something that don't happen all
[1:58:07] the time
[1:58:07] praise the Lord but you know when God
[1:58:10] does it we ought to be quick to give him
[1:58:11] praise Amen quick quick to honor him and
[1:58:15] thank him a man for what he has done
[1:58:17] this is
[1:58:18] out of the message expectations and
[1:58:21] these are some miracles that that
[1:58:23] occurred look at this says the person's
[1:58:25] faith is a pulling then when it lifts up
[1:58:29] it's over and and that's how sometimes I
[1:58:31] can tell out into the audience of how
[1:58:34] the people are healed it's because I
[1:58:36] feel it tugging and pulling and just
[1:58:39] it's like someone pulling mine and let
[1:58:41] it lifts up sometimes I just want to
[1:58:44] turn around because I got my mind on
[1:58:46] something else I'm watching every move
[1:58:48] and I just let it go because I know the
[1:58:50] person will notice in a few days that
[1:58:52] something's happened to them see a man
[1:58:55] was just testifying of something I met
[1:58:57] him in the hotel lobby he said brother
[1:58:58] branham I was just sitting in the
[1:59:00] meeting said something just come all
[1:59:02] over me he said I went home and I said
[1:59:05] Lord Jesus what's the matter what's
[1:59:07] happened to me and he'd been wearing a
[1:59:10] trust for 30 years and he said that he
[1:59:13] laid down there a little bit and went to
[1:59:15] sleep again and said he dreamed that he
[1:59:17] was at the meeting again and he said
[1:59:19] he's seen the Lord walked through and
[1:59:21] porns towards his trust he woke up and
[1:59:24] took his trust off there it was all gone
[1:59:29] praise God see God had showed him in the
[1:59:31] he was at the meeting something came
[1:59:33] over him got reminded him through a
[1:59:34] dream when it happened to him in that
[1:59:36] meeting and the trust was everything was
[1:59:38] gone he was healed of that condition
[1:59:40] look a lady said she had but she was
[1:59:43] been she was she was she was at her home
[1:59:45] she returned back from a meeting she had
[1:59:47] a stomach trouble that bother her for a
[1:59:49] long time she couldn't get in the bread
[1:59:50] line
[1:59:50] she said truth surely he'd know about
[1:59:53] the rest of it would be true so so said
[1:59:56] she just believed God and she was it was
[1:59:58] about it was about a day after she had
[2:00:00] been at the meeting she was washing the
[2:00:02] dishes and said all of a sudden
[2:00:04] something happened and a real cool
[2:00:06] feeling went through her she began to
[2:00:08] cry she's getting crying and she said
[2:00:11] didn't know what had happened and she
[2:00:12] run over and taken some sweet milk and
[2:00:15] usually the sweet milk the stomach so
[2:00:18] hot with fevers she'd vomited right up
[2:00:20] she drank a glass of sweet milk and
[2:00:22] really felt fine said she run over to
[2:00:24] tell her neighbor and her neighbor was
[2:00:26] just on all fours thinking God that
[2:00:29] she'd just been healed to what it was
[2:00:31] the
[2:00:32] God had seen her faith and was passing
[2:00:35] through the neighborhood oh he wants to
[2:00:42] Jesus is passing this way these people
[2:00:46] had come and been pray for at the prayer
[2:00:48] line two weeks later the angel or went
[2:00:51] to confirm the word to them see these
[2:00:55] people that's holding onto the Word of
[2:00:56] God to them healing matters and no
[2:00:59] matter what anybody says to them the
[2:01:01] doctor could sing it to you but God made
[2:01:04] me a promise and by His stripes I'm
[2:01:06] healed I don't care how long I have to
[2:01:09] wait it's still a miracle what it was
[2:01:13] the angel of God has seen a faith and
[2:01:15] was passing through the neighborhood
[2:01:16] confirming his word with signs and
[2:01:18] wonders there there was and those two
[2:01:20] women were just so happy rejoicing the
[2:01:23] other one had a female disorder said it
[2:01:25] struck her at the same time what or what
[2:01:28] what what I can imagine that
[2:01:30] neighborhood was not the same after them
[2:01:33] two ladies got together start testifying
[2:01:34] they was in the same prayer life pray
[2:01:38] for at the same time and they went home
[2:01:40] neither one of them healed in the prayer
[2:01:42] line but two weeks later they're there
[2:01:45] at their house and the lady one later
[2:01:46] can't eat and she just got to spot with
[2:01:48] manna I just feel like going to eat I
[2:01:50] want to eat and usually she eat
[2:01:51] everything come up but she's not gonna
[2:01:53] eat I won't eat she started eating
[2:01:54] nothing coming up she's a minute I think
[2:01:56] I'm healed and she going to testify
[2:01:59] about it and by the time to get to her
[2:02:01] neighbor to testify I want to take what
[2:02:03] she says she was going down to encourage
[2:02:05] you I want to let you know what God did
[2:02:06] for me
[2:02:07] but before she could encourage her she
[2:02:09] was being encouraged because the growth
[2:02:11] that her neighbor had and she know her
[2:02:13] neighbor had to say the growth fell off
[2:02:15] and couldn't find it don't know where it
[2:02:17] went
[2:02:18] I wonder if we've ever seen that before
[2:02:30] no I'm not gonna be like the fella that
[2:02:33] had his ear chopped off and put back on
[2:02:35] and they're gonna carry Jesus to Pilate
[2:02:38] I'm not gonna be like that to some see
[2:02:41] miracles don't matter to some but maybe
[2:02:43] he said I just I'm sorry I got a job to
[2:02:45] do I would have quit my resignation I'm
[2:02:50] turning it in right now and if y'all
[2:02:52] gonna take my life I have a feeling this
[2:02:54] man will be able to raise me back up I'm
[2:02:58] working for him you know
[2:03:06] all that God has done for us he deserves
[2:03:10] our lives he deserves it I mean totally
[2:03:15] sold out surrender to living for him
[2:03:23] this quote is my last quote I want to
[2:03:25] bring to your attention today out of the
[2:03:26] message testimony God's prophet visit
[2:03:29] right here in West Palm Beach Florida in
[2:03:31] 1953 and he spoke this a man here in our
[2:03:36] city says Jesus has risen from the dead
[2:03:41] and if he's here tonight he can do just
[2:03:44] the same he works through people now he
[2:03:48] can't unless you believe he can't work
[2:03:51] through something people unless you
[2:03:52] believe that minister said to me brother
[2:03:55] Branham I don't care what would take
[2:03:57] place I wouldn't believe it I said it's
[2:04:00] not for unbelievers it's for believers
[2:04:03] they didn't believe Jesus and they
[2:04:06] surely won't believe his servant see I
[2:04:09] said it's just it's just for those these
[2:04:12] signs shall follow them that believe not
[2:04:15] unbelievers believers so Church to me
[2:04:20] miracles do matter and this is a church
[2:04:23] we believe in praying for the sick we
[2:04:26] believe that when we lay hands on the
[2:04:28] sick that the Bible say they will
[2:04:30] recover we believe that right we have
[2:04:35] seen 2-minute testimonies in our own
[2:04:37] miss we gotta wing
[2:04:38] tell you what God did back in Bible days
[2:04:41] we ain't gotta tell you what he did and
[2:04:43] brother branham's damn we can tell you
[2:04:44] what he's doing right now we believe and
[2:04:48] the reason that we believe and the
[2:04:50] reason that we get more of this I mean
[2:04:52] like I told you my father and God's
[2:04:55] called him home but my father was healed
[2:04:58] of cancer before he left here right I
[2:05:00] mean I mean and we got we got doctors
[2:05:03] reports showing that he was healed of
[2:05:05] cancer but even though God called my
[2:05:08] daddy home he didn't stop healing after
[2:05:10] heal my daddy he come and got my daddy's
[2:05:13] daughter-in-law in heel about two of
[2:05:16] kamsa right and before he did that he's
[2:05:20] popped in the sister Sam's house healed
[2:05:22] her of cancer and say yeah he passed
[2:05:26] through the neighborhood yes he will
[2:05:28] and the one thing that he told God's
[2:05:30] promised say is you can kiss up people
[2:05:33] to pee leave not even cancer well stand
[2:05:38] in the way of the frame see healing is
[2:05:43] children's friend you supposed to eat
[2:05:46] from this you supposed to enjoy this God
[2:05:50] got a few just like he brought your
[2:05:52] salvation he brought you healing when he
[2:05:54] went to the cross healing was also
[2:05:57] involved in your salvation I don't know
[2:06:02] why you know churches don't preach it
[2:06:04] that way no more but God God is that
[2:06:06] he's the same church he's the same man
[2:06:09] that's why I said there's a
[2:06:10] controversial title but I said to some
[2:06:13] because I'm not talking about me and I'm
[2:06:16] not talking about you but to you this is
[2:06:20] children's branch and whatever you need
[2:06:23] God's got it whatever you need God's got
[2:06:28] it and as believers we should not be
[2:06:31] confessing how sick we are that should
[2:06:35] not be a believers confession you ought
[2:06:38] to be confessing how healed you are
[2:06:41] don't let the devil hear you talking
[2:06:44] like that
[2:06:44] well yeah I got this and I got in and
[2:06:46] running my family
[2:06:52] that's how you talk to the devil right
[2:06:55] if I'm right it's gonna bypass me oh
[2:07:01] okay
[2:07:02] some of y'all don't believe that I read
[2:07:04] it for you let me I don't believe it's
[2:07:11] gonna bypass me like this doesn't just
[2:07:13] say keep on runnin it running the family
[2:07:15] let it keep running right on past me
[2:07:17] and I'm not I'm not receiving it glory
[2:07:22] to God hallelujah
[2:07:24] musicians y'all prepare to come we're
[2:07:26] gonna close here but maybe I'll just
[2:07:28] read something out of Scripture for you
[2:07:30] yeah yeah turn with me to Psalms 19:1
[2:07:42] Ori
[2:07:45] somebody won he that dwelleth in the
[2:07:50] secret place of the Most High shall
[2:07:53] abide under the shadow of the Almighty
[2:07:55] I would save the Lord he is my refuge
[2:07:58] and my fortress my god and him will I
[2:08:05] trust surely sound like this surely
[2:08:11] there's not a possibility it's not a
[2:08:14] maybe surely is certain surely he shall
[2:08:17] deliver thee from the snare of the
[2:08:19] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[2:08:22] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[2:08:24] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[2:08:28] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[2:08:31] the way you're gonna defend the devil's
[2:08:33] by quoting the Word of God that's gonna
[2:08:36] be your shield and buckler right thou
[2:08:38] shalt not be afraid for the terror by
[2:08:42] night nor for the arrow that flieth by
[2:08:45] day nor for the pestilence that walketh
[2:08:47] in darkness nor for the destruction that
[2:08:50] wasteth at noonday the Bible says a
[2:08:53] thousand shall fall at thy side and ten
[2:08:57] thousand at that right hand this is the
[2:09:01] reason we can tell the devil to keep on
[2:09:02] running because it's shell but it shall
[2:09:06] not come nigh thee only with our eyes
[2:09:14] shalt thou behold and see the reward of
[2:09:16] the wicked because thou has made the
[2:09:19] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[2:09:23] high the habitation there shall no evil
[2:09:28] befall thee neither shall any plague
[2:09:32] come nigh thy dwelling loose me flu
[2:09:36] symptoms
[2:09:41] I know I just read in the paper by some
[2:09:44] other time with the flu that ain't gonna
[2:09:46] be my testimony I believe in miracles
[2:09:54] hallelujah there shall no evil befall
[2:09:58] thee neither shall a plague come nigh
[2:09:59] thy dwelling for he shall give his
[2:10:02] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[2:10:04] all thy ways they shall bear thee up in
[2:10:07] their hands lest thou dash thy foot
[2:10:09] against the stone
[2:10:10] thou shall tread upon the lion and the
[2:10:12] ad of the young lion and the dragon
[2:10:13] shalt thou trample under feet because he
[2:10:16] have set his love upon me therefore will
[2:10:18] I deliver him I will set him on high
[2:10:20] because he have known my name he shall
[2:10:23] call upon me and I will answer him I
[2:10:26] will be with him in trouble I will
[2:10:29] deliver him and honor him and I love
[2:10:32] this if the devil trying to take you
[2:10:34] before you turn 70 because God promised
[2:10:38] you threescore and ten years but the
[2:10:41] devil striking your body before you turn
[2:10:42] 70 you got to take the devil back to the
[2:10:44] word he says with long life will i
[2:10:47] satisfy him and show him my salvation
[2:10:51] that's one thing I'm always i'ma just
[2:10:54] always appreciate you know my dad even
[2:10:57] when the Lord called him home he has
[2:10:59] showed him in a dream he says it showed
[2:11:03] him in a dream he looked at his whole
[2:11:04] life and when he got to 70 he said went
[2:11:06] dark he saw nothing at 70 it just it
[2:11:09] just went dark and he couldn't
[2:11:11] understand he went back as a little boy
[2:11:13] and through his childhood through his
[2:11:14] teenage years through his young adult
[2:11:16] years just just so many things got
[2:11:18] showed him at 70 it just it just went
[2:11:19] dark and when I went dark he's like oh
[2:11:21] well I'm not sure that is he just kind
[2:11:24] of left it left it to be and when he
[2:11:26] when he took sick mom had food - so you
[2:11:29] remember that dream you shared with me
[2:11:30] years ago you say yeah I do remember
[2:11:33] that I'm just just just wondering what
[2:11:36] the Lord is saying there and God allowed
[2:11:38] daddy to see 70 and we had ourselves a
[2:11:41] nice little celebration with his yellow
[2:11:44] and black
[2:11:48] but at 71 got called daddy home and
[2:11:52] exactly the way he showed him in the
[2:11:54] dream that was it but you know before he
[2:11:56] left
[2:11:59] miracles matters
[2:12:01] and he stood and gave his old testimony
[2:12:04] at his 70th birthday party but how God
[2:12:08] healed him a cancer
[2:12:11] oh my church that gave the devil a
[2:12:15] little black eye
[2:12:16] glory to God ain't going nowhere - God
[2:12:19] finish with me right and before I go I
[2:12:22] want the people to know what God did for
[2:12:24] me
[2:12:25] church I was I was just I was just I
[2:12:28] love sharing his testimony I'm always
[2:12:30] grateful for that God is still good and
[2:12:32] in the midst of whatever we're going
[2:12:33] through a man he's still got to some
[2:12:37] miracles don't matter but that's not me
[2:12:40] because he'll the healing is children's
[2:12:43] brand and I'm gonna eat as long as God
[2:12:46] say I can eat I'm gonna joint praise the
[2:12:51] Lord
