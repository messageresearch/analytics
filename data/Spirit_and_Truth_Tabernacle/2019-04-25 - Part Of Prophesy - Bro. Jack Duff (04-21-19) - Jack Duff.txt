like that little opening to service a bass morning it's a really really wonderful introduction amen and just been feeling the presence of the Lord all all weekend and we started some services here on Friday night Good Friday and we had a service on Saturday night brother Troy spoke on Friday night and we certainly enjoyed his sermon on proof of the resurrection amen and then last night we had but the quake who come and he ministered to us on the truth Easter today right because some people still stuck two thousand years ago but he's still the same yesterday today and forever and if he rose again that he should be doing the same things he did when he was here hey man so we we're experiencing that and we we appreciate the true Easter today and then this morning we had a sunrise service and brother Jerry did a wonderful job the quickening spirit has not lost his power has not lost its power you need to be quickened today he can do that to you a man we thank for that I am blessed and honored today to have my dear cousin a man Reverend Thompson and man Reverend Olson y'all let's just just just stand to stand them up they don't just just just stand me just for me it's really busy busy making these these are this is my family and and I have them stand both of them because they are instrumental to me standing in this place today and there was I don't know if I shared with you all the testimony but there was a time in my life I was just kind of going through some things and and just didn't didn't know what my next turn was I didn't know which direction I was I was headed I felt lost and I you know was fixing computers and that was my job and so he knew that and he had a computer problem so he called me into his house I went out to his house for a night to fix his computer it was a normal thing we always did that but this night he began to ask me some questions about service and how his church how was this in that particular day that he asked me about church I hadn't gone to church the day before and he knew right being real quick say something wrong with that you know I know jack they go to church and if Jack didn't go to church something wrong so he just kept you know prolem and kept rolling kept rolling and I'd say look this is what's going on this is what's happening he said okay okay okay they say the Lord calling you I say what you say yes the Lord is calling you I see so you know I told his wife what had happened and man she got the Bible app and they turned to Joshua chapter 1 and they began the read you know he would tell a read and she would read and then he started preaching read man I was to the house one o'clock in the morning here in Joshua one and I sit there under the presence of the Lord and I knew that God was speaking through them to me and if I would have denied that I would have been denying God all right and God was using them to speak to me and I left that left that house gonna days that night you know and you know and I went on and he before I left he asked me he said now when you gotta come preach what I'm like you know you know I came to fix the computer I didn't come to get no invitation to preach you know and I say I pray about it now you know when when when Christians use the words I'll pray about it that's a that's the Christian form of saying if you haven't yet Christians say I pray about it you already know where they telling you right you already know what he meant no they just don't want to say it that way sort of Hughes you know biblical terms I'll pray about it right so so you know he said he said okay I give you some time to pray by him he called me a couple weeks later say when you coming to preach when I say uh and they say I want you to come preach for me and the openness pulpit and I went and I preached and and I remember preaching the sermon you must be born again they're at their church and after I finished preach and I felt so ain't no just wait all over my shoulders I didn't know what was going on so I called him up in the same reven Dawson I don't know if I said something wrong in the pulpit or what but I just don't feel right I want to apologize he's saying you said nothing wrong you preached the word you see just a young preacher you'll get over it I say well praise the Lord and and and I realize later on what the weight was the weight was God was calling me to be a pastor and the pastor has the carry load sometime right and so I understood that and and then he called me up and say now my people say when your cousin coming back I said your people say my people want you to come back they want you to preach on Mother's Day I say what I say well okay a la outcome and and and I went with a sermon give it keep it keep it lose it and and and and at that time my brother and my sister-in-law it came to that service you know that and and and we have some other family members that came and and you know we had a we had a wonderful time but that was the beginning of my journey to get to the point that I am today so I always say this a man and when I'm with him and some of his events and I want to say it today hear that of any credit that God would give me for my ministry a man will be associated with a reverend Dawson and lady Dawson a man it would be associated [Applause] and whatever the Lord does I'll never forget that I'll never forget that moment that's what it that was what I call a defining moment in my life it really meant a lot to me and it still does and I can I can never you know there's there sometimes God give you your testimony and and you know and Caleb I to take it from you right they weren't there was only three of us there right and we know what happened that night so I'm just just so happy and he's retired now from ministry and so he can get around and you know do a few things in there so they surprised us today and it's a wonderful surprise to have him here Spirit of Truth Talent raise the Lord amen hallelujah and I'm uh you want to say something rather Dawson you want to say something you sure a man man man I appreciate you I really do appreciate you so good to see family and friends a man here on this day and we wish you all a Happy Easter I know for those that have been going through the this is the fourth service this weekend and some of y'all may be a little little tired and I will do our best to kind of preaching it out the way I know y'all got food at the house that's waiting on y'all and a man and things like that but uh but you know we got some food here too that's been waiting on years away oh so we just expecting God just just to feed us on today I want to just take two scriptures amen this morning and this certainly being Easter we want to try to talk about the resurrection it's a story that cannot grow old a man it can be told over and over again and still have impact and in our lives so but we'll use just a little a different angle Amen today and trust that God would get glory amen out of it but I want to read from 1st Peter chapter 1 and then I also want to read from mark 16 man first Peter chapter 1 verse 3 and then from mark 16 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead I want to just kind of catch that he says Peter says this according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope and in the way that he came into this hope is by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Dan a man and if you're here this morning without hope as we turn over to mark 16 if you hear without hope all you need to do is meet Jesus a man and he will give you the hope that you need aid me here in mark 16 verse 1 through verse 8 it says and when the Sabbath was pass Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome II had bought sweet sprites sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week that came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great a man and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted and he saith unto them be not afraid it ye seek Jesus of Nazareth amen see there was Jesus was a common name during that time so he's being very specific about the Jesus that you're looking for right a man he says you seek Jesus of Nazareth and maybe there was another one from Nazareth but there was only one which was crucified hey man you see Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen hey man he is not here behold the place where they laid him all right and agogo says but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man but they were afraid the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray amen over what we've read it here father we are grateful for the reading of the word but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarification to the things that we are reading Lord as we go through this sermon today let me let let it not just be routine let it not just be tradition but God somebody here needs a resurrection in their own lives somebody needs hope and all the way they're gonna find that hope is to get to know you so lord help help us to present you in a way where people will realize a man who you really are to them so take control over this portion of the service as you have done the prior part of the service get glory and honor to thy name is in Jesus name that we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated praise the Lord we want to use for our title today part of the prophecy and also what I'm really trying to show is that you're part of the prophecy a man part of the prophecy so bear with me as we just kind of get through this on today we as a church are coming out of 21 days a fasting amen and we we did that we typically do that right before Easter and it was a time lay man that we had through this time of fasting and just you know just felt like we're getting closer to God and I just feel like the Norton has been in the services God's just been moving and I'm it's and and we're very grateful for his presence that has been here fasting is really when you when you're denying yourself God is actually feasting when you're fasting hallelujah a man and I felt like God was actually feasting with us and you know just just so much that I've got that I've seen God do just these sermons that have been coming I love the way brother Solomon put it these you know the four beasts there that you know he typed that the lion the Ox you know the man and the eagle and you know just those four different anointings you know so we thank God for that but God has God has been doing some great things through this time and we thank God for giving a strength to come through that but as we were in the fast a man and being that it was set for 21 days I went back and just began to reflect on the scripture there and Daniel where Daniel had to wait for an answer from God for 21 days a man he was uh he God had showed him something and he was looking for more revelation he was looking for more understanding a man of this vision that he had and and as he prayed and he was beginning to seek God about this somehow what we find the scripture God heard the prayer soon is Daniel prayed God God heard the prayer and I want to tell you this morning that maybe you've been praying about something right and I want to know God is not hard-of-hearing gosh I heard the prayer as soon as you pray hallelujah and maybe you might find yourself even on today like I know God heard it but he ain't done nothing about it hallelujah glory to God but like brother Troy told us sometimes maybe his wife was sent him to the store to get some milk amen and he went he has every intention to go get the milk and he's going to do exactly what his wife acts to them but but when he gets there he gets him to a conversation with somebody gets held up that's not that the milk is not coming amen it might not be coming right now but imma get there with the milk I got milk and I'm bringing home I just got held up come on some not that God can't reach you but you gotta understand that when you pray somebody else hear you pray and there's a devil Amen try my block that player from reaching your destination in the midst of the devil block in the prayer you've got to have confidence and you've got to have faith that the God that you pray to it's able to to send you the answer and no matter when the answer get here it's gonna get here but in Daniels day this prayer was held up the scripture says by the Prince of Persia this is none other than the devil the devil's holding up this prayer and and sometimes things are happening in the heavenlies a man and they happened in the heavenlies but then they're coming down to this natural rim in which we live in right and there was a battle going on in the heavenlies in and and Gabriel shall have a say say Michael the Great Prince right he had to come and and when it came I was able to kind of get released from the Prince of Persia and I was able to bring this answer to you I was able to kind of start showing you some things so so I began to just think them that I said now you're not not not that we're necessarily fasting and praying that you know God will reveal something tremendous to us but but I know that there are many Saints here today that need a release hallelujah and I want to tell you even the property remained as they would say the greatest treasure that a man could find is to find release amen some of us amen might need a release financially hallelujah and I'm praying amen this season that you would receive your release a man some might needle are released spiritually and I'm praying that in this season you'll receive your release whatever it is that you need I'm trusting that God could give you the release just like he gave it to Daniel we're asking God for the release of both spiritual and natural blessings hey man I I mean while I told you this scripture here in Joshua 1519 is why I say that you know this is where I get this Josh with 1519 this was Caleb a man had a daughter by the name of accent and and and he had already said that you know whoever would concur particular City they would get his daughter for wife a man and when that when Caleb gave her to opt Neil a man if when he gave it off the nail she was getting ready to go and and before she left she jumped off a horse and she she asked her daddy for something her daddy asked the question saying uh let's leave read this tonight in Joshua 1519 she had to say who answered give me a blessing but thou has given me a Southland give me also Springs of water and she's and he gave her the upper Springs see that's the spiritual things that come down from God he gave her the upper Springs and the nether spring so I want I want I want to release hallelujah I'm some spiritual things amen I'm expecting Oh non spiritual gifts to be an operation in this church hey man these are the blessings that are in the upper springs we want to see the word of wisdom amen we want to see the word of knowledge we want to see the gift of faith yes we want to see the gifts of healing we heard about it last night amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday God is able to heal we want to see amen the gifts of healing we want to see the working of miracles we want to see prophecy we want to see discernment we want to see tongues and we want to see interpretation of those talks o night spirits of gift enter in the upper Springs let it be released thank God for the cause thank God for the new church in the new school thank God for the jobs but let that those are blessings in the nether Springs but we won't both blessings from the upper Springs blessings from the never spring [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we can have it yes we can have it I'm looking for it some of y'all need houses we praying for it a man God done blessed several others blessing your blessings on the way but don't just stop and just serve you better press in and get more of God somebody need to hear themselves to the Holy Ghost allow God to use some sometime hallelujah stay stay stay prayed up you don't see a lot of folk they get their blessing then they stop serving God we're not talking about that hey man you'll get your blessing and lose your blessing you better keep God first the next thing you know you broke is I don't know what and you won the winner money wins because you took your eyes off God so I want to just kind of shift here a little bit you know it kind of talk about the first view of Easter the first person that actually got a view of Easter would have been Joe Joe would have got the first view of Easter Jove is the oldest book of the Bible and I want you to understand that you know when when Joel got his view of Easter amen it was because he was actually going through something Jobe had reached a point in his life a man where you know he would he had achieved so much he was a very wealthy man a very wise man I mean people come from everywhere just to sit and talk to Joe right and but my job start going through in his body job didn't realized that there was a conversation that was had in heaven right where God even challenged Satan and say have you considered Joe and the devil's answers like no I haven't considered him because you got a bit big hands around the man is too blessed for me to consider anybody too blessed to be stressed the man is too blessed for me to consider him I know since I'm even trying nothing because Joby I told them keep worshiping DC say well why do you know why don't you consider doing some say I'll take the heads from around I take all this and take all that and I'll let you try to say but he gave the devil a man what we call boundaries you say you can do this and you can do that but you can't take his life he might get real close to the brink of death but you cannot take his life and if God gave the devil boundaries concerning show is in this situation and his body is being attacked he's lost his children his lost animals he's lost a man just about everything he owns him and a good thing about Jobe is that when he when he got to the spot where he lost he meant everything what job did was by his face to the ground and begin to worship God hallelujah I love I love his attitude in the midst of his trial he began the worship God but why he was there a man in this song in this trial his wife my lord if I was gonna be recorded in the Bible if there was only gonna record one word that I said out of my mouth while I was living on the earth I wouldn't want it to be the words that jobs wife had recorded the only words she has in the Bible is to go into the husband's room and say why don't you just curse God and die [Music] and job had to say something to say than you he didn't call her a foolish woman he didn't I knew foolish woman get out my room he didn't say that he say he say he said you speak like you talking like the foolish women jobs attitude was what was right at this time of trial and I want to just kind of just brief bring this in just a little quote here from the message I know my Redeemer liveth this being the first Eastern I want you to just kind of catch this a man says that first few of Easter I'm sorry I'll go to paragraph 39 to scroll down since that first view of Easter made a profit screen and the thunders roared and the lightning splash he's so Easter his first time when did he see it not when he had his well broom close up not not when he had his his hair comb perhaps to the top not when he was enjoying the very birth the very best of health that's not where job saw Easter look but when he was in trouble I want to say something there because a man often time folk from the church on Easter because they are in trouble hallelujah but I want you to understand that if you coming at a time a man when there's trouble your life God wants to give you a resurrection come on you part of this prophecy hallelujah amen it's one thing to celebrate what Jesus did 2,000 years ago but he is still resurrecting people from the grave of sins hallelujah look it says but when he was in trouble when he was laying in a trouble at the hour and almost up his death that's when he saw Easter that's where he saw the first resurrection now you know he says always been similar to you and I it's been when we laid at all to somewhere until we were ready to die and said Lord God do something for me it was then that God raised the curtain and we seen Easter say we see Easter not in a way of theology so much we never seen this piece as wearing new clothes we've never seen he says little rabbits and colored eggs we see Easter in the power of the Resurrection other Lord Jesus Christ that was a real Easter and when he screamed God handsome a quick-fire see when he say he pulled the curtain back cuz Joubert's not what I would call a little discouraged he was going through some things and he was a little discouraged a man at what was happening this life but but what God did a man with jobs almost even cursed in the day that he was born I wish I wouldn't even born right I mean he got a little skirts because of his trial but but by God just kind of pull the curtain back and let job look at Issa and when job looked he said I know my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and he got he got more revelations say though after my skin worms destroy this body so let the testimony said don't know the skin words might destroy this body I'm I'm going through something nothing but I'm still going through skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see Connie Jo got a view of East alright Joe got a view of Easter and i'ma tell you if you can ever get a view of Easter it a change your perspective Easter you wanna Norman the power of his resurrection now not just the story of his resurrection but you wanna Norman the power of his resurrection cuz if he's get a lot the way we can tell he's alive because he's doing the same thing he did in Bible days [Music] let's go in a little further job was a little discouraged and we also pick up here let me just see something here I just want to bring something to you oh yes yes yes bear with me just bear with me I'm a coastal ooh beat this is coming out of go tell my disciples I won't try to catch this look at this he says then when went along come King Jesus they've done to him what they said they would when he was born in Bethlehem he came in by the way of a stable door went out through capital punishment this is our Lord and Savior while he was here on earth he never made out this is a powerful statement he never made a 50-mile journey everything Jesus did he did within 50 square miles everything was done within 50 square miles never went past a 50 mile journey think about that right he says he he he never made a 50 mile journey in his life he never went anywhere around Palestine yet the message of his gospel has traveled to every crack in corner of the world he never wrote a book in his life yet the book was written of him has outsold every book in all ages the Bible he says and yet it said never went to college in his life talk about the Lord Jesus never went to college life and yet there's been more colleges erected in his heart than any other thing has been put upon the face of the earth or any other name or any other man he never went very far he lived a humble low life he was made fun of stuff laughter and he said that he had power to lay his life down and power to reason up and men and any man can make boast like that anyone can but he proved his contention when he rose only some mornings you see if I could just you can you can leave that right there I'll stop there if I can just tell you what separates Christianity from any other faith because people get involved in all kind of stuff but what separates Christianity the reason I say Christianity is right it's because our Lord and Savior proved what he said yes when Confucius died he died when Buddha died he died but when Jesus died he rose again and that separates I mean the Christian faith separated from every other faith because our leader did what he said he was going to do hallelujah now I want to just kind of share with you because you know that Easter that he rose there was still some discouragement in the land job saw his first Easter at the skirt at a time of discouragement and and and the first Easter you know that the disciples experience was was when Jesus appeared and there was discouragement in the land then I want to just you know there was two brothers one by the name of Cleophus and he had a friend the Bible calls in Luke 24 and they were on the road back to Emmaus and man they were just discouraged they were down trotting that they couldn't believe what had happened to Jesus they could believe it a man a lot of them with the skirt not just Clea puss and his friend but all the disciples were discouraged the women were discouraged every bottom of the spirit I want to tell you something a man the devil has one secret weapon and you know everybody here don't have to fight cancer everybody here don't have to fight diabetes everybody here don't have to fight high blood pressure everybody here don't have to fight you know the same diseases but there's one thing everybody real fights and it's what I like to call Satan's secret weapon right and I heard a preacher said say Saint got one weapon and he and he took a guy took one of his demons in the room and said now he had it covered up you know if you put namesake saying I'll win it when they overcome this and they overcome that I got this one right here for you saying I watched my son beneath I said I saw Gina and in due time but I got this room this is my secret weapon no matter what they overcome in like this one right here would get them they say I said now what is the d-max that that will say well what is it say you know this one right here when I pull to come on this one is called discouragement everybody go face of discouragement and when you're facing discouragement hallelujah that's when you want to see a nice time to discouragement but I mean you can Easter in your health in your finances you can have an Easter income families you can have an easy you can experience the power of Easter the resurrection in any situation in your life his brothers on the road to emmaus were going through some things they were discouraged after they begin to talk with Jesus I love the way that I would say how he was hide behind a bush and it's kind of jump site and begin to talk to her a little bit and the problem is is that they didn't recognize right it was Jesus you know folks on the church today or still don't recognize Jesus with him can I say something else they were talking about him but they did not recognize him yes sir so here is just going through you know different things now not a way that Jesus got them to recognize him the first thing he did he begin to break down Scripture hallelujah he beginning to break down enough didn't the scripture say anything didn't the script to say that and then the skipper saying and as they were listening to the scripture amen that spirit of doubt and gloom and discouragement beginning to kind of move away Oh glory to God Hey got to the poor like man this man says stuff that we never heard and then they were actually headed back to the old church they come out of before they started following Jesus so here they are they said I'm not this bad guy so so if that Sun was going down and they were getting ready to go into the room it and they they begin the bag saying I don't leave us come on into the room and stay with us tonight it was only after they got behind closed doors that Jesus did something and when he did these boys knew only Jesus can do something like that begin the break bridge they so breaking bread like that woman's there five thousand they saw breaking bread like that we need four thousand let it be me defeat true he'll break bread the same [Applause] this morning he wants to break a little bit with you glory to God man half a fee broke bread the boys the boys they lit up like but it took off running back to the city we have seen the Lord he is risen you can take the test after they had experience with the Lord Jesus after stay with me here stay with me here I have I want to go a little further I just I need to drop this drop drop drop something else off to you the infallible proof of his resurrection sometimes we don't know he's with us we don't know he's with us we like the brothers on the road to emmaus this is out of him fallible proof of the resurrection he says and how many times have you many times like those in my last reading coming from Emmaus have you walk with them and didn't know it it's the beautiful Easter morning the first one that first Easter Jesus was alive abroad in the world says I'm closing now that's that's what he said I'm not saying that I want to ask you something - that loved him walk with Him and didn't know it who got you out of that sick bed not long ago that you give over the priest to the doctor you should have shook his hand and said thank you doctor for your kindness but it was Christ who kept you from that accident you might have praised the driver no doubt with his quick mind his intellect worked swiftly to know how to swing the wheel at once that might have kept it but it was Christ it was Christ said certainly it was says who was it during the time of depression on his way back right when you had no flour in the barrel and the kiddies were needing some kind hearted neighbor come and give you something to eat you thanked him you should but it was Christ working in man you didn't realize him many times they fail to do that these men fail to see it they were lovers of Christ and they woke with a sad heart brokenhearted because they thought the Messiah that they had believed in was in vain and he was dead and go not knowing that that was him walking by them we don't realize sometimes that he's walking with us he's there keeping you he's proving that he's alive when you when you were in that accident know it all you could even have time to pray all you could say was Jesus he was right there brother brother quick who told us last night he say he was at the light and you know he didn't even realize that his car was moving and and as the car was going for he was getting ready to hit another car he thought he had stopped he was caught up in the spirit just singing and worshiping but he didn't realize he was there and and say all of a sudden he felt like a power and hit his leg and he hit the brake real hard like what in the world happened it was Christ oh he'll walk with you he'll talk to you he'll do it whatever some of y'all should have been dead a long time ago but it was Christ with somebody pulled a gun to your head it was Christ hallelujah somebody you need to know it's him all the time they're protecting you but he wants to give you a true resurrection yes I want to just read a scripture a man because there was a there was there was this discouragement hid job this discouragement hid the brothers on the road to emmaus discouragement also hid the disciples and here in Matthew 26 I just want to read a scripture because Jesus prophesied a man about his death and prophesied what would happen glory to God but I want to tell you that two part of the prophecy look at this in Matthew 26 verse 31 since then staff Jesus unto them all ye so this is all to decide we always talk about Peter and how he did not Christ but this is all the disciples right hallelujah it says all ye shall be offended of me this night for it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I would go before you into Galilee now I like this because he's prophesying that you know hey there's gonna be a death there's gonna be some things that happen but imma rise again and after I'm rinsing I'm gonna meet you in Galilee that is all he says now if you go go back and when you get home and you read more of the scripture you'll see you know where Peter Conner comes in say oh no not me I hang on I'm not gonna do this and I'm not gonna do that in 2 Peter said Peter you gonna deny me three times before the the crow twice you're gonna deny me thrice he said no no not me everybody else might do but not me and and Peter did exactly what Jesus said he was gonna do and the problem is is a man when Jim went when Peter did it a man he began to weep he thought about what he did and he began to weep he got discouraged got discouraged now I want to tell you something that every body is not part of the prophecy there are other people that you know there was another man during this time that did something wrong he began to be provided to hallelujah but he could go to another room his name was shoes it was prophesied that all the disciples would forsake him it was prophesied that was gonna happen but I but when Judas prophesies I mean when Judas fulfilled his portion of the prophecy Amen I wanna Judas couldn't return the money hey man he could he couldn't do anything everything had changed to have to do this Judas did this and he can return them on that they wouldn't even take it back now empty are the Pharisees don't want you they don't work to deal with you but not II don't want you I want to say this because if the families don't want you if there is there is no possible way that you can go back to most the disciples and Peter not have a problem if Peter go take out the ear of women of service what you think he woulda did the Judas Judas had nowhere to step he couldn't go back he couldn't go forward all they could do is go off the earth that's why we didn't hung yourself because he had no where to spare don't put yourself in a position where you got nowhere just what to do watch the decisions that you make if you're gonna sell out anybody don't sell out Jesus [Music] PETA was different Peter I thought about this and Peter wept because he had let the Lord down but it was prophesied that he would do it and he did exactly what Jesus said but but I got I just walked through this just walked through this with me I was thinking at least Peter was in a place when he got there to see you know you know what was happening to Jesus and the little mate come out and say you were one of them and people start accusing Peter before he start cursing I want to say at least Peter was ever placed to see what was going on in the palace course right he wept regarding how he failed Jesus but I want to say at least he was broken enough to realize he did feel right all the times we fail the Lord but we keep acting like nothing ever happened but at least Peter was broken enough to realize he did fail yeah I want to just keep going Jesus already told Peter he would be he would be betrayed but he would be delivered to the hands of wicked rulers and they would kill the son of son son of man but in three days he would rise again and meet them in Galilee Jesus gave them a mess say now this got happened this got happened but in three days I'll meet you in Cali I want y'all to just just just meet me there in Galilee and I thought about this I want you to follow me here amen because he told say in three days I'll meet you in Galilee and I say all right the Lord gave me this negative treatment it's only temporary cuz in three days things are gonna change the spit on us on his beard it's only temporary because in three days everything will change the mocking than the name-calling it's only temporary because in three days things about to change can I say this - it's only temporary because in three days Peter I want to taste something you're discouraged rich it's only temporary because in three days things are going to change I like I looked at that that's why the scripture means a lot to me that we were reading earlier from first Peter 1 and 3 notice his words blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy how can Peter write this because we're what Peter experienced that's the resurrection right and the reason I'm telling you Peter was a part of the prophecy what was the prophecy I'm gonna rise in three days and I'ma meet you right in Galilee alright you know what that means no matter what the devil did with discouragement it could not stop Peter and not just Peter but the other disciples from meeting the Lord Jesus in Galilee [Music] see see he was a part of the prophecy hallelujah amen and then just like the devil tried to get them the devil Minh trying to get something up but in your discouragement God wants you to experience a resurrection look at this look at this Peter was a part of the positive prophecies just as well as the negative or I haven't finished reading that scripture according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again hath begotten us again unto a lively hope now it was only after the resurrection that Peter even got this new hope look I have begotten us again unto a lively hope a man by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead let me go on here Peter was a part of the positive prophecies just as well as the negative therefore when Christ rolls no matter how much Peter had failed he was still part of God's plan and how do i how can I say that because Peter was gone I don't know what he I know he was ready ready to go back fishing and do all those things Peter said man I'm a fail there's no system even going on with this I might as well just give up on this but but when Jesus rose told women go tell him out of cycles and maybe Peter felt like he wasn't a disciple not anymore he said man I I don't know what I told him that I wouldn't do this and I wouldn't do that and I did exactly what he told me I was gonna do so so Jesus put word out amen to the to the to the women he said go tell my disciples and Peter he knows exactly what Peter is going through and if you knew what Peter was going through he knows what you're going through Peter only got hope after he saw Christ resurrect and you will only receive hope after you see Christ resurrected go tell my disciples and Peter look at it says maybe I was thinking maybe Peter then feel much like in the cipher but it wasn't based on Peters feelings it was based on God's promise it wasn't based on what how Peter thought about himself right but it was based on what Jesus thoughts worth of Peter right ultimately amen I love this because there was something else that Jesus that said before all this happened right he told Peter he told Peter he asked the question who do men say I am so the disciples you know well you know giving him generalife some say thou art Elias and Jeremiah you know one of the prophets that's what they say they wanted to know where they actually influenced by what other standard did they have their own understanding as to who he was right so he asked a direct question who do you say that I the Son of Man but Peter Peter say thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus turning to see blessed art thou simon barjona flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my father heaven has and the blessing was the gates of Hell will not prevail against you upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail it was the rock of revelation that Peter had of who Christ was just because Peter had that revelation this this this this this the spirit of discouragement that came into his life at a very critical time could not overcome him you know discouragement will lead people to commit suicide discourage me that's why I mean it's a I want to our battle with that spirit I wanna I wanna I want to put discouragement where it belongs underneath the feet look you a part of the prophecy he died for you it's not just a good story he did this for you and you'll never have hope until you come in contact with him Peter lost his hope but when he when he when when he saw the resurrection when he came in contact with the Lord Jesus he had a renewed hope that's why I say begotten us again look at this Peter was standing at the gate of depression but it could not prevail Peter was standing at the gate of discouragement but it could not prevail the devil desired the symptom that's weak but Jesus said I pray for you that your faith would not fail so this is why I love the statement go tell my disciples and Peter I'll meet him in Galilee Peter as well as the other side was that for sukham they were all a part of this prophecy now when they got to Galilee there was something else happening the Lord just didn't want to meet him in Galilee justice just to meet him in Galilee but he has some instructions for them and and and he gave them some instructions there and Galilee that that that I think is important for the church because see this was really the beginning of a man of the Christian faith this is what this is what began the faith and and let me take some the faith didn't stop when Jesus died faith actually began then the Christian faith begin and if it started there when did it in right it hasn't that's why I say the same thing that you saw him doing and Bible days you should expect him to do today yes I want to read your script you now you know people don't believe you know there was a story one time this woman she was uh the Prophet told how this woman she was sick and she had a son that was in Bible School and and and they said to him say hey man you better come home your mama dying your mama is dying you better get here as soon as you can and now he said oh I got to get home again I don't know what I'm doing didn't got another the message state don't worry about it mom was okay they say what so you have to stay in school Mama's okay now she was dying now she's okay Tucker okay so he didn't he didn't know what had happened so he came home you know for a break one time and when he got home me up he told uh they said mom and I they told me that she was dying and then they say that you okay what happened mama he said she said oh oh that little church up the hill up there he say uh you know there was some sisters in the church that came down and they come to visit me I was sick they come to visit me and they said that they had a church that believed in praying for the sick and and he say they say oh yeah they said I got the past it he came down me pray for me and i ne read the scripture the real one I'm gay get ready to read he read the scripture and when you're ready I actually I got him I got him and they say he said mama what scripture sorry to begin the reading a man mark sixteen oh how can I read it for you he was reading this him and mark 16 verse 15 because when he Sam amici and Galilee they were part of the prophecy this was not the end of Christianity this was the beginning glory to God verse 15 says and he said unto them go ye into all the world now he only went 15 miles about 50 miles but he's sitting the disciples Amen it's all the world they are part of the prophecy and he said to them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and I want you to extend preaching the gospel is not what I'm doing right now this is not preaching but Richard it's when you demonstrate [Music] [Applause] when you demonstrate that he lives with people seeing the power of his resurrection Cinda can have a nice go here to all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe then that's eating this right amen amen them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils hallelujah so what's his name his name is Jesus and we cast out Devils in the name of Jesus I in my name shall they cast out Devils listen he says they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick is this Jesus words yes is it in read in your Bible they shall lay hands on the seat and then Jesus said they shall recover Peter when you pray for somebody they're gonna get healed I know you saw that in my ministry but nice time for you to exercise this in your ministry now before I go into that you know the Sun grant he read the scripts a old mama I was in Bible School you know they told us this scripture mama and what we found in in Bible School you get you know you don't understand mama what we found out in Bible schools that this is what we call the uninspired part of the Word of God this is uninspired anything Jesus Saves inspired right but they say it's the uninspired part of work so the mama when she heard her son say this is the uninspired part of the Word of God the mama say oh yeah begin the praise car and if she had a tambourine maybe should be in the kind of beat it a little bit glory to God and so successful so that the son say mama you acting like them people up on top of the hill it said mommy you need to sit down and stop that shake shake no son I just I just had a thought yeah but what you thinking mama said you just said that this was uninspired and the thought is that if God could heal me with the honest by a word then what could he do with the inspired work praise His Holy Name Laurita cards so you couldn't take our healing from she needs something that changed and they based it upon the Word of God I want to taste them whatever you face and you stand on God's words if Jesus that we shall lay had you know that did you know and I want to say another thing lay hands on the sick don't even mean pray for lay hands mean just [Music] [Laughter] Jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see the ministry went over the ministry was just getting started [Applause] [Music] that's why he couldn't let discouragement keep Peter in the place that he was that's why he would use Peters name said go tell my disciples and Peter now you ain't going back fishing I'm gonna make you fishers of men gonna prove that God that Jesus was with them the prove it Peter was so anointed you read it in the book of Acts right he was so anointed acts 5:15 let's read it so anointing I could be wrong when I see this and if I am I will out glad to come up here say I'm wrong and I'll make that right but I don't remember what I'm getting ready to read I don't remember this happening in Jesus ministry I know about a woman that just to hem of His garment but I don't know about this happening in Jesus milk yeah what I'm trying to taste that it's supposed to get great greater works than these shall ye - because I go to my father but you still part of this prophecy now look at this in acts 515 in so much that they broke forth the sick into the streets and laid them on bed in and couch it's not not now now look at this just get this in your mind they got beds and they are couches in the street while the sun is shining they got it lined up hallelujah they got it lined up dancing and couches industry than at least the shadow he didn't even touch them didn't even lay handsome but at least the shadow leads the shadow apena the same man that was discouraged [Applause] join the tower he can do it because he was part least a shadow a PITA passing by might overshadow some of this man if his shadow hits you you gonna get up Jesus was saying that I beat ya and if they can say that about people Wow what should they be saying about us you parted as prophesied by his resurrection was to bring these things forth out of us see it's not bunny rabbits it's not Easter egg hunts we talk about a resurrection we stop we talk about something that got put in man before he was even born because you were made in God's image see when Jesus Jesus Jesus told him now and brother brother Jerry hit it this morning how there were different people that would have risen from the dead you know and even in the Old Testament they threw a warrior on the bones of the Prophet and the warrior a man fighting in the battle and they just we're gonna just throw them throw them on the bones Tommy wouldn't even know who buried there and he ain't got no grave marker let's keep going boys and before they know anyway a man that was dead all he did was hit bones but the bones have to be anointed and the man came back to his feet ready to fight in the battle then you touch the prophet's bone I want to tell you it wasn't his bones it was the noid that was in the boat do you know if I died before Jesus return there's gonna be an anointing in my bones so we know your way up wait for me I'm coming there's gonna be an anointing praise God no the skin worms destroy this [Applause] and I'm just blessed when I think about what the Lord did this was not the what happened that Calvary was not the end it was actually the beginning and it should still be going to this day now I'm tell you something my cousins say you didn't you forgot me that's like that's like the woman that the blood issues cuz you don't know what he going through that's right brother Troy read some quotes here on Friday night he read some quotes about you don't know what's gonna happen in this place you don't know who God gonna send to this place you don't know what they going through but what you need to do is come here under expectation but I lay hands on and I'm expecting him to come I only do things that please my cuz this body is not mine these hairs are not mine
