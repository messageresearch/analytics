[1:00:27] 2nd chapter 16
[1:00:31] man familiar Scripture we've been going
[1:00:35] over that but
[1:00:36] it says love not the world neither the
[1:00:40] things that are in the world If any man
[1:00:44] love the world the love of the father is
[1:00:48] not in him for all that is in the world
[1:00:54] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[1:00:58] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[1:01:03] the Father but is of the world and the
[1:01:08] world passeth away and the lust thereof
[1:01:13] but he that doeth the will of God
[1:01:17] abideth for ever amen
[1:01:20] go to Matthew 16
[1:01:28] with Matthew 16
[1:01:35] we'll begin reading from the 24th verse
[1:01:39] then Jesus said unto his disciples If
[1:01:42] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:01:46] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:01:49] me for
[1:01:50] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[1:01:54] it and whosoever will lose his life for
[1:01:58] my sake shall find it for what is a man
[1:02:04] to profit if he gain the whole world and
[1:02:08] lose his soul or what shall a man give
[1:02:12] in exchange for his soul
[1:02:16] dear Heavenly Father Lord we come before
[1:02:19] you this morning Lord God we ask you God
[1:02:22] so just anoint Lord God had me become
[1:02:25] the heart that Oland you may be seen no
[1:02:27] father God speak to the hearts of the
[1:02:28] people Oh father God the big may go free
[1:02:30] Lord God we expose the devil in this our
[1:02:33] Lord God we ask you Lord to have your
[1:02:36] way in Jesus precious name Amen
[1:02:38] we want to take a little thought this
[1:02:40] morning taking it from first John a man
[1:02:45] and we see here what Paul was talking
[1:02:48] about three particular
[1:02:52] spirits share the the luster the lust of
[1:02:56] the eyes of the lust of the flesh and
[1:02:58] the pride of life we would like to to
[1:03:01] focus our attention this morning on one
[1:03:05] particular we want to deal with the
[1:03:08] pride of life we want to deal with the
[1:03:13] pride of life so if I have to title as
[1:03:16] much as our toilet the pride of life
[1:03:19] so we see a
[1:03:22] you know
[1:03:24] pride this is this the spirit this
[1:03:29] spirit of pride you know is a sneaky do
[1:03:34] oh
[1:03:35] the spirit of pride is a tricky one to
[1:03:40] figure out you know a lot of times in in
[1:03:43] warfare you have certain army go in and
[1:03:48] their uniform dumpin they call them
[1:03:50] boots on the ground but before you do
[1:03:53] that you have one next that day that
[1:03:55] comes in sneakily
[1:03:57] they come in under the cloak and they
[1:04:00] kind of blend in with the community they
[1:04:03] kind of hide themselves to get
[1:04:06] information and to to break down things
[1:04:10] from behind the scenes
[1:04:13] that sneaky devil called pride
[1:04:18] sometime he's hard to figure out he
[1:04:22] disguises himself as a good thing
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:30] the definition Webster describes right a
[1:04:34] feeling or a deep pleasure or
[1:04:37] satisfaction
[1:04:39] derived from one's own
[1:04:42] achievements
[1:04:44] the all the achievements of others of
[1:04:49] those who which a one is closely
[1:04:53] associated
[1:04:54] see so it doesn't even have to be your
[1:04:59] accomplishment it can be an
[1:05:02] accomplishment of someone close to you
[1:05:05] and all of a sudden you get Alice DIF
[1:05:11] sure
[1:05:14] those it says or associated or from
[1:05:19] qualities or possessions that are widely
[1:05:23] admired
[1:05:26] we don't deal with this this one
[1:05:30] because it one thing we gotta understand
[1:05:34] pride is a demon
[1:05:39] pride will keep you from being healed
[1:05:45] pride will keep you in bondage
[1:05:50] Brad will keep you from recognizing
[1:05:55] your day in its message
[1:05:58] it's a filthy and ugly spirit that hides
[1:06:04] itself
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:06] behind something that appears good
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:14] sometimes we we find ourselves when
[1:06:18] things are going good
[1:06:21] God is blessing you and we find a prat
[1:06:27] sort of sneaks in
[1:06:32] from the blessings of God I
[1:06:36] got the quote I got quotes all on it
[1:06:40] let me tell you something my brothers
[1:06:42] and sisters you
[1:06:44] cannot let me read some scriptures here
[1:06:48] proverbs 8 3:13 says the fear of the
[1:06:53] Lord is to hate evil
[1:06:56] he says I hate pride
[1:07:00] arrogance evil behavior perverse speech
[1:07:05] proverbs 11:2 says when pride comes then
[1:07:11] comes disgrace but when humility comes
[1:07:15] is wisdom
[1:07:17] proverbs 1310 says where
[1:07:21] very strife very surprised but wisdom is
[1:07:26] found in through those who take advice
[1:07:29] prize pride will get you to feeling
[1:07:33] sorry for yourself pride will come in
[1:07:37] and get you to build up a complex
[1:07:44] we look at the rich young ruler
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:50] he knew who Jesus was
[1:07:54] he said good master yeah he
[1:07:59] Jesus told sell all you have and give to
[1:08:03] the poor and come follow me
[1:08:08] pride
[1:08:10] was in his heart to what he could do it
[1:08:14] it was a demon
[1:08:17] let me read something for you
[1:08:21] in the message go tell my disciples
[1:08:25] 5304 old five yes he says talking about
[1:08:32] man he said so she had seven dollars
[1:08:35] cast out of her pride Envy and she
[1:08:41] thought she was so pretty and
[1:08:45] there was no one like her listen now but
[1:08:50] when Jesus spoke and saying be bousley
[1:08:54] and that left her she became a new
[1:09:00] person
[1:09:01] she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own
[1:09:06] sight
[1:09:09] but she wrapped herself in the robe of
[1:09:13] meekness and gentleness and followed the
[1:09:17] master
[1:09:19] she loved him
[1:09:22] Pratt will keep you from following Jesus
[1:09:28] pride will keep you from following Jesus
[1:09:33] we had a profit coming this out who
[1:09:37] preached against shortpants
[1:09:39] priests against make up preached against

[1:11:25] walk away from the message walk away
[1:11:30] from Christ
[1:11:34] because of pride
[1:11:36] oh
[1:11:37] we go deeper
[1:11:39] he hides himself in
[1:11:43] Christianity he hides himself in
[1:11:47] religion oh
[1:11:49] my
[1:11:51] you might say one may say well I don't
[1:11:58] associate with them holy rollers let me
[1:12:02] tell you something the Prophet pointed
[1:12:05] out in his life
[1:12:10] documentary that his first wife
[1:12:14] his first nice mother they don't take my
[1:12:19] daughter on the fellowship we wake up
[1:12:21] holy rollers
[1:12:24] didn't want to be associated with those
[1:12:27] holy rollers
[1:12:29] I got a certain air to keep up you're
[1:12:34] different you your pride
[1:12:38] you know the story yeah caused him to he
[1:12:42] loves his wife and his child
[1:12:47] he said I never do that again
[1:12:51] never do that again that was pride
[1:12:56] that caused that
[1:12:58] amen thank you my brother let's look at
[1:13:02] something here oh
[1:13:04] lord help me
[1:13:06] the Prophet said
[1:13:09] amen in question-and-answer
[1:13:13] 53:7 29 says he said the two thirds of
[1:13:18] the earth is in sin and more than that
[1:13:22] which tooth which two-thirds of the
[1:13:25] Angels was kicked out and those demon
[1:13:29] spirits come into people and habitate
[1:13:32] their bodies so you see what I mean
[1:13:35] they're demons that once they was once
[1:13:39] existed and they came into the people
[1:13:43] and gave them a nature
[1:13:47] Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary
[1:13:50] Magdalene pride both big people you see
[1:13:54] unclean filthy vulgarity Emily the
[1:13:57] strike and all these things there was
[1:14:00] spirits that was made up back there when
[1:14:04] God began to make men of his own image
[1:14:08] created those supernatural beings those
[1:14:11] spirits and then he put men in the dust
[1:14:15] of the earth which was the first man
[1:14:18] adam and
[1:14:20] man was made after the image
[1:14:24] this human man here
[1:14:27] is made after the image of animals now I
[1:14:31] want to stop right there we realized
[1:14:34] that the serpent meant was an animal so
[1:14:38] if that spirit can infiltrate and use
[1:14:42] that animal he can infiltrate and use
[1:14:47] your body he works on your emotions he
[1:14:52] works on your feelings he works on your
[1:14:56] your hearse he works on your pain
[1:15:00] he works on your discomfort to get you
[1:15:04] to carry out his evil will he is trying
[1:15:07] to destroy you he is trying to get you
[1:15:11] to lure you away from the promises of
[1:15:14] God
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:16] that spirit yeah call pride
[1:15:21] which like I say sometimes
[1:15:26] we get up and we put on our good clothes
[1:15:33] put on
[1:15:34] Dolce but the whatever it is
[1:15:37] perfume
[1:15:39] smelling good
[1:15:41] and we come to the house of God
[1:15:46] to keep you from lifting up your hands
[1:15:53] will keep you from letting go
[1:15:57] and letting go
[1:16:00] you were right at the threshold of a
[1:16:03] breakthrough in Pride
[1:16:08] man better
[1:16:10] keeps you quenched in
[1:16:14] Pride
[1:16:16] some wonder well why can't I get a
[1:16:19] breakthrough why I came out why I came I
[1:16:21] just in the back prime
[1:16:25] you have to you have to love you have to
[1:16:28] love God more than
[1:16:30] you love you sins
[1:16:35] more than you love yourself
[1:16:40] revelation 12 and for the fall first and
[1:16:44] his tail drew a third part of the stars
[1:16:47] of heaven and did cast him down the
[1:16:49] earth and the dragon stood before the
[1:16:51] woman which was ready to be devour which
[1:16:54] was ready to be delivered
[1:16:56] for to devour her child as soon as it
[1:17:00] was born
[1:17:01] that third of those angels I was no
[1:17:04] demonic spirits now you can't see them
[1:17:08] they're in another dimension but
[1:17:12] just rest assure that they are always
[1:17:15] they are here
[1:17:18] people are bound with these spirits and
[1:17:22] don't know it about a help of the God
[1:17:26] we're gonna expose that done
[1:17:27] we want people to be able to go free
[1:17:31] understand that that Pride devil is
[1:17:34] trying to take you to hell
[1:17:37] amen and the message believers to
[1:17:42] audition he says god don't look at your
[1:17:45] money he don't look at the way you dress
[1:17:47] he looks at your heart
[1:17:50] he says glad that this old-time
[1:17:54] salvation will make a pair of overalls
[1:17:57] and they took Sedo suit hug one another
[1:17:59] and called him brother
[1:18:02] will make a calico dress and a silk set
[1:18:05] together and call each other sister
[1:18:08] takes away pride that's what's the
[1:18:11] matter with the church today it's got to
[1:18:15] start you
[1:18:17] too much pride he says let down your in
[1:18:22] 6 foot of dirt in half
[1:18:25] that's right God you got a soul got to
[1:18:31] meet God you got a soul that has to meet
[1:18:33] God
[1:18:36] that's what's the matter with our
[1:18:38] Pentecostal churches I hold in his
[1:18:40] churches
[1:18:41] they got up to too much pride
[1:18:45] not I'm sure some of us can attest today
[1:18:49] could attest today and uh they get up to
[1:18:54] too much pride they get up after they
[1:18:57] get to pattern themselves after the
[1:19:00] world he says they get a church and a
[1:19:03] nice place and they think we want to
[1:19:06] pattern after the world
[1:19:08] that's where God's people always got in
[1:19:12] trouble when they pattern themselves
[1:19:14] after rest of them he's up high
[1:19:22] that many say one to me you may paint
[1:19:24] day steps read and see if the neighbor
[1:19:27] don't paint in step three
[1:19:28] when they fire mercury and seeds the
[1:19:32] neighbors don't wanna mercury they want
[1:19:35] to match I don't care whether my pants
[1:19:38] match my coat
[1:19:40] and my shirt and tie that's my suit I
[1:19:44] want my Christians I what I want my
[1:19:47] experience to match God's but that's the
[1:19:50] kind of match the church and I got a
[1:19:54] little one although that's the kind of
[1:19:57] match that Christians ought to have
[1:19:59] not whether the Jones has got a big
[1:20:03] church boy or a little got a little one
[1:20:06] I want Christ Halloween that's right
[1:20:09] there's where it comes in friends that's
[1:20:14] what we want
[1:20:15] amen so we're not we're not from this
[1:20:19] world
[1:20:20] so we don't pattern ourselves after this
[1:20:24] world but what happened he said there
[1:20:26] back in the beginning that Satan chose
[1:20:29] to hate Wow so he can use your eyes and
[1:20:32] you begin to look on the things of the
[1:20:35] world and desire

[1:20:41] heart and you'll hit a pastor from the
[1:20:44] pulpit speech oh certain things in Pride
[1:20:48] would cause you to say I just can't do

[1:26:43] pride
[1:26:44] let's look at we want to look you don't
[1:26:48] have to turn to it but Matthew the third
[1:26:51] chapter
[1:26:52] the prophets say God
[1:26:55] takes a man but never his spirit
[1:27:01] we see
[1:27:03] here
[1:27:05] about John the Baptist he says he says
[1:27:09] in those days John the Baptist preaching
[1:27:11] in the wilderness of Judah Judea and
[1:27:15] saying repent the kingdom of heaven is
[1:27:18] at hand
[1:27:20] for this is he that was spoken
[1:27:24] by the Prophet I say us saying the voice
[1:27:29] of one crying in the wilderness prepare
[1:27:31] ye the way of the Lord make his paths
[1:27:35] straight
[1:27:36] and the see John had his raiment of
[1:27:41] camel's hair
[1:27:43] and they anin leather and girded about
[1:27:47] his Lawrence and his meat was locusts
[1:27:51] and wild honey and
[1:27:54] were baptizing baptized in the Jordan
[1:27:59] confessing their sins now let's let's go
[1:28:03] stop right there let's let's just look
[1:28:05] at this
[1:28:06] we have
[1:28:09] the spiritual
[1:28:12] Pharisees in them sad to see the of that
[1:28:16] day and they're going on and they were
[1:28:20] that's our Father
[1:28:24] is Abraham
[1:28:29] we've been doing this for a while
[1:28:32] we know we we know what we're doing we
[1:28:36] got this all figured out
[1:28:38] and they missed
[1:28:42] the forerunner of
[1:28:45] Jesus because they was puffed up in the
[1:28:50] pride let me put it to you this way they
[1:28:53] were blinded by
[1:28:55] pride
[1:28:57] pride will blind you
[1:29:02] pride will blind you to the truth
[1:29:06] because he didn't come to wait that they
[1:29:09] were looking for in the company
[1:29:12] he was a wild man come out of the wood
[1:29:15] screaming repent
[1:29:18] baptizing people in some larger
[1:29:23] wild man untain
[1:29:27] preaching from his convictions
[1:29:30] but he knew who he was
[1:29:33] and he knew what his job was to do
[1:29:37] but those Pharisees and the Sadducees of
[1:29:40] that day
[1:29:41] couldn't accept him
[1:29:44] because they were lifted up in their
[1:29:46] pride
[1:29:47] and uh he say uh but when they saw many
[1:29:52] of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
[1:29:54] his baptism and he said in an AMOLED you
[1:29:56] generation of vipers
[1:29:59] her you talking to me
[1:30:02] [Laughter]
[1:30:12] who has warned you to flee from the
[1:30:16] wrath to come
[1:30:18] bring forth therefore fruits meet
[1:30:22] for repentance
[1:30:24] for repentance
[1:30:27] and think not to say within yourselves
[1:30:32] we have
[1:30:33] Abraham to our Father and I say unto you
[1:30:37] the God is able to of these stones to
[1:30:42] raise up children unto Abraham and
[1:30:46] now also the axe is laid at the root of
[1:30:50] the trees therefore every tree which
[1:30:54] bringeth not forth good fruit it's home
[1:30:58] down and cast into the fire he says I
[1:31:01] indeed baptize you with water unto
[1:31:03] repentance but he that cometh after me
[1:31:08] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[1:31:12] worthy to bear he shall baptize you with
[1:31:15] the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:31:18] see and in their pride and they and they
[1:31:22] lifted up they couldn't see that the
[1:31:25] very redeemer
[1:31:27] that they had been
[1:31:30] looking for
[1:31:33] was coming in that this was the man to
[1:31:36] introduce them to that very redeemer
[1:31:40] but pride
[1:31:43] he didn't come in silk rolls
[1:31:46] he didn't have on a three-piece suit
[1:31:50] came out of the woods hunting
[1:31:55] like a wild man but he was preaching
[1:31:57] thus saith the Lord
[1:31:59] but because of a pride they were unable
[1:32:04] unable to see unable to recognize pride
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] we talked about here
[1:32:16] Luke the seventh chapter
[1:32:21] you don't have to go to the cane if you
[1:32:23] like but we see that Jesus was invited
[1:32:30] to a feast
[1:32:33] a certain Pharisee invited Jesus to
[1:32:36] feast and
[1:32:39] let me tell you something my brothers
[1:32:41] and sisters we come and we pray we get
[1:32:46] up on Sunday morning and I say Sunday
[1:32:50] morning cuz that's when we get up but
[1:32:51] anytime we come to the house is low what
[1:32:52] are we praying for what are we asking
[1:32:54] for God meet us there
[1:33:01] we all have to be able to recognize that
[1:33:05] Lord I need more of you I need you daily
[1:33:11] I
[1:33:11] need you every hour
[1:33:14] Lord I want to be closer to you you have
[1:33:18] to have that earnest desire
[1:33:21] oh
[1:33:21] my the closer you get to him the closer
[1:33:26] you want to get to you
[1:33:29] so you invite your me
[1:33:32] we pray we should pray either at home or
[1:33:35] at service lord I need you so we're
[1:33:41] inviting him to this
[1:33:43] bountiful feast
[1:33:45] see the table has been spread when Jesus
[1:33:49] comes sup with me
[1:33:52] come sup with me
[1:33:55] but we see here in this story
[1:33:59] they invited Jesus and I appreciate
[1:34:02] brother Quaker
[1:34:04] you say he said Elohim came down a
[1:34:08] man to earth now I want you to look at
[1:34:13] something
[1:34:14] he destroyed the earth in Noah's day he
[1:34:20] said the sins of the world stuck to his
[1:34:23] nostrils
[1:34:27] if the sins of Noah's day stuck to his
[1:34:32] nostrils and
[1:34:35] in Jesus day
[1:34:38] he came down
[1:34:40] he left his clean throne and glory to
[1:34:46] walk amongst the filth of this world
[1:34:51] see so jesus walking
[1:34:56] feet sweat
[1:34:58] the dust from the ground and the dung of
[1:35:04] the animals
[1:35:06] between his toes on his feet it stopped
[1:35:12] to his nostrils
[1:35:15] but he came
[1:35:17] because we invite
[1:35:22] I'm here because I heard your crying
[1:35:28] let me take a side path
[1:35:31] in Moses State Amram
[1:35:35] prayed for deliverer
[1:35:39] he would go out and he would see the
[1:35:41] suffering of the people and he would
[1:35:45] come home and say y'all should read nah

[1:35:51] to the room and pray just keep the kids
[1:35:54] down here let me pray
[1:35:57] I'm tired of seeing the suffering of our
[1:36:02] people

[1:36:07] would pray all night long she
[1:36:11] be concerned
[1:36:14] you gotta eat I think you gotta eat Oh
[1:36:18] Lord Church
[1:36:20] we should have it we should pray for the
[1:36:25] suffering of the people of this present
[1:36:30] day
[1:36:32] we should be like Emery
[1:36:35] we realized that he has sinned deliverer
[1:36:39] but Lord if you could just take the
[1:36:41] scales off of the people to hide if we
[1:36:44] can just take that spirit and rebuilt
[1:36:47] that pride back to the pits of Hell from
[1:36:50] whence it came the people will go free
[1:36:54] the people will go free I for one sick
[1:36:58] and tired of seeing my family
[1:37:06] I
[1:37:10] see my family in bondage
[1:37:14] not a taskmasters will
[1:37:18] serve in his will to build his kingdom
[1:37:22] I'll pray Lord that
[1:37:25] they see the deliverer
[1:37:28] throw em round
[1:37:30] one day the angel the Lord came to
[1:37:35] and told him you
[1:37:38] will but your wife is gonna bear son and
[1:37:41] he shall be
[1:37:43] the deliverer
[1:37:46] but he had to go through some things
[1:37:49] see the king did the Satan knew that
[1:37:53] deliverer was coming so now he's trying
[1:37:55] he's killing all of it he's got these
[1:37:58] evil witches
[1:38:02] to kill all of the babies
[1:38:06] so I can fret Amram said the Lord told
[1:38:10] me what to do
[1:38:12] if you lose it
[1:38:15] put them on the river you
[1:38:18] give you keep it ya

[1:38:26] that River I give him away give him back
[1:38:30] to the one who gave
[1:38:33] so let me come back
[1:38:36] we invite Jesus since armies
[1:38:40] the preaching of the gospel and God is
[1:38:43] dealing with our hearts
[1:38:45] he come
[1:38:47] he's sit in the corner
[1:38:49] we see in the store how the
[1:38:53] young prostitute
[1:38:56] she was the only one recognized
[1:39:00] that Jesus was here with dirty feet
[1:39:06] the only one that recognized the
[1:39:09] Pharisees he but he invited all of his
[1:39:12] uppity friends those that have been
[1:39:16] blessed
[1:39:18] well-to-do and
[1:39:21] they just going around and
[1:39:25] eating drinking and being merry
[1:39:28] fellowshipping with one another and
[1:39:30] ignoring Jesus is that
[1:39:46] what keeps us from seeing
[1:39:48] Jesus if you invite him he will come
[1:39:56] he will come
[1:39:58] recognize that he's here wanting to meet
[1:40:03] your knee wanting to deliver you from
[1:40:07] whatever you were bound with wanting to
[1:40:09] set you free
[1:40:12] but you won't
[1:40:15] clean his feet
[1:40:17] so this prostitute came and she
[1:40:21] recognized her heart was so heavy
[1:40:23] she went and she spent all she had to
[1:40:28] get the most expensive oil that she
[1:40:31] could possibly purchase
[1:40:33] she came back and she anointed him
[1:40:38] with a priest
[1:40:42] and cleaned his feet with tears of
[1:40:47] repentance
[1:40:48] on her knees Lord
[1:40:54] I'm sorry
[1:40:57] but Lord I know I've heard what you did
[1:41:00] for a woman at the will
[1:41:05] Lord I desire to be free I
[1:41:08] desire to be free
[1:41:12] she washed his feet
[1:41:15] but tears of repentance
[1:41:18] dried of his feet with her hair and
[1:41:23] she the host woman your sins which are
[1:41:26] many I'm now forgiving my brothers and
[1:41:31] sisters let us not get so caught up in
[1:41:38] just coming to church and we miss Jesus
[1:41:44] he's here
[1:41:46] but you have to let go of your pride
[1:41:50] open that door of pride and let him in

[1:41:57] let him in your secret place that pride
[1:42:01] will keep you on bondage and he's here
[1:42:06] wanting to set you free
[1:42:09] one in the set you free
[1:42:13] but we just have to yield a
[1:42:17] man

[1:42:26] feet

[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:43] praise the name of the Lord we certainly
[1:57:47] appreciate the Word of God today big man
[1:57:50] as it
[1:57:51] came from brother Troy the pride of life
[1:57:54] and I believe all of us here
[1:57:57] should be able to identify was something
[1:58:00] that was spoken a man in that in that
[1:58:03] message causes you to just kind of do a
[1:58:04] little checkup and on yourself and it's
[1:58:08] so easy so these is he was just kind of
[1:58:10] talking about this beginning you know
[1:58:12] the definition of the gave us a feeling
[1:58:15] of a pleasure of a deep satisfaction the
[1:58:18] one's accomplishments or the conference
[1:58:21] mentor somebody close to you because I
[1:58:23] was just thinking on that and you know
[1:58:25] I'm just thinking about you know we were
[1:58:26] believing God for
[1:58:28] a church for for spiritual time and I
[1:58:30] got nothing wrong with that but I tell
[1:58:32] you what we don't want to go in there
[1:58:34] with a spirit of pride
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:41] not only did it tell us a man to avoid
[1:58:44] the spirit of pride but to overcome it
[1:58:46] that he gave you a solution and the
[1:58:49] solution to overcome prior is you have
[1:58:51] to give God praise
[1:58:53] constantly stay in a place of praise
[1:58:56] don't don't ever think you accomplished
[1:58:58] nothing on your own everything you have
[1:59:01] God did it God did it
[1:59:05] Thank You Menzies bringing the thought
[1:59:07] of how the Pharisees and Sadducees and
[1:59:11] Pharisees miss the forerunner because of
[1:59:14] their pride and you know if you missed
[1:59:17] the forerunner then you're gonna
[1:59:19] actually miss the coming of Christ you
[1:59:21] understand those in that day they missed
[1:59:24] a forerunner John the Baptist so they
[1:59:26] also missed Christ's and today if they
[1:59:28] missed the Prophet they're gonna miss
[1:59:30] Christ they're not gonna make the
[1:59:32] rapture if you reject the forerunner
[1:59:34] you're not gonna make the rapture right
[1:59:36] you're gonna miss the second term so so
[1:59:38] I'll tell you what church this is
[1:59:39] something that we want to be sure that
[1:59:41] lord I don't want that if that's in my
[1:59:44] heart God search me hey they used to

[2:15:36] the first pope that was read it was
[2:15:38] talking about Mary Magdalene how she was
[2:15:43] the Bible says that Jesus cast seven
[2:15:46] demons out of her and we had a prophet
[2:15:50] come along and tell us what those demons
[2:15:51] were and now one of the demons was a
[2:15:54] demon of pride a man that she had to be
[2:15:57] free from him what pride does you all
[2:16:01] might not realize that a man we were
[2:16:03] talking about that in Sunday school this
[2:16:04] morning his self-love reduces his
[2:16:08] self-love and and and and and and and
[2:16:11] and when you actually the Prophet told
[2:16:13] us that we when we turned to our
[2:16:15] self-love we actually move away from the
[2:16:17] love of God
[2:16:19] self-love is what calls you to post
[2:16:21] selfies they're all about you and Mannie
[2:16:25] looks at you have because god bless you
[2:16:27] with them all right but it's not for you
[2:16:29] to flog in front of everybody
[2:16:31] that's not look I mean you flaunt your
[2:16:33] body that's not what you do if god bless
[2:16:36] you belong here you don't fly bad just
[2:16:39] thank God for you but but self-love is
[2:16:41] what's actually caused us to turn away
[2:16:43] from the love of God be careful these
[2:16:46] areas these are small demons but big
[2:16:49] penis
[2:16:52] god help us is my forever don't let this
[2:16:56] go in when they are not together receive
[2:16:57] it today is it's from heaven heaven I
[2:17:01] want to just read a scripture here
[2:17:04] on Friday night we had our business
[2:17:07] meeting and and I'm gonna read from pack
[2:17:11] six
[2:17:12] we did a couple things a man and one
[2:17:16] that I need to we voted a man
[2:17:20] Deacon
[2:17:21] and also
[2:17:22] brother Quinton was voted in as a
[2:17:24] trustee here at the church but we own
[2:17:28] that as far as the deacon is concerned I
[2:17:30] want to read the scripture and I told
[2:17:31] you all I wanted to lay hands my
[2:17:34] precious brother Troy he was it was
[2:17:36] voted in and what happened is that I was
[2:17:38] going by a scripture where it says that
[2:17:40] the Deacon had to be first proven and
[2:17:42] and we read that out of Timothy where he
[2:17:45] had to be first proven so we took that
[2:17:47] year proving but this morning I found
[2:17:49] out that I was I was wrong but proven
[2:17:51] time went for the last four years should
[2:17:53] only been a few weeks and I had to
[2:17:55] apologize to brother Troy for that I
[2:17:57] shouldn't I did it that long and but I'm
[2:17:59] glad that he's so patient with me amen
[2:18:01] but as we go forward in the future
[2:18:03] proven won't be a year Amen it's gonna
[2:18:05] be only a few weeks but I think for this
[2:18:07] past year I want to say that I watched
[2:18:09] for the Troy
[2:18:10] everything that I laid before him that
[2:18:13] we wanted to do even down to just him
[2:18:16] being able to present the word apt to
[2:18:17] teach and if he did not demonstrate that
[2:18:20] this morning and just throughout the
[2:18:22] year he's apt to teach and I'm grateful
[2:18:25] for what I see the Lord is doing in his
[2:18:27] life and I'm just I'm just so happy I've
[2:18:30] know where God has brought him from know
[2:18:32] where God has brought over from and
[2:18:35] and when you see the handle or just so
[2:18:37] it's so precious amen and we got such a
[2:18:41] faith in such a hope that we got family
[2:18:44] that's not ever they come in a man they
[2:18:46] come in my brother always somebody say
[2:18:48] just just look at me look at where I
[2:18:49] come from don't give up on nobody God
[2:18:52] got a way of doing things
[2:18:54] amen so this morning we want to
[2:18:56] officially they man pray over our
[2:18:58] precious brother we want to do it
[2:19:00] according to Scripture Acts chapter 6
[2:19:02] verse 1 says and it was in those days
[2:19:04] when the number of the disciples was
[2:19:05] multiplied there arose a
[2:19:08] murmuring of the Grecians against the
[2:19:10] Hebrews because their widows were
[2:19:12] neglected in the daily ministration
[2:19:13] but then the twelve called the multitude
[2:19:16] of the disciples unto them and said it
[2:19:18] is not reason that we should leave the
[2:19:21] Word of God and serve tables
[2:19:23] wherefore brethren look ye out among you
[2:19:26] seven men of honest report full of the
[2:19:28] Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may
[2:19:30] appoint over this business but we will
[2:19:33] give ourselves continually to prayer and
[2:19:35] to the Ministry of the word and the
[2:19:38] saying please the whole multitude and
[2:19:40] they chose stephen a man full of faith
[2:19:42] and of the Holy Ghost and Philip and the

[2:19:58] laid their hands on their
[2:20:00] the Word of God increase the number of
[2:20:03] the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
[2:20:05] greatly and the great company of the
[2:20:07] priests were obedient
[2:20:09] to the faith a man brother trophy would
