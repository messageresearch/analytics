no weapon formed against me [Music] it won't work no weapon formed against me shall prosper it won't work god will do what he said he would do he will stand by his word he will come through god will

will stand by his word he will come through no matter formed against me [Music] it won't work [Music] praise the lord we i guess that song came across my heart uh the other morning that was a part of our devotion and just reading that scripture and seeing the challenges that were set right before right now actually i believe it's isaiah 54. maybe i'm wrong yes that's correct i'm sorry but when i got to reading this this chapter i i'm gonna start at the 13th verse and it was just a blessing to me it says and all thy children shall be taught of the lord [Music] and grace shall be the peace of thy and children shall thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me said the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord i don't care what comes away no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper amen i don't care what kind of squeeze they try to bring forth upon us it shall not prosper he said they shall gather together but it's not of me hallelujah we're not a part of the world council of churches when they do gather together and they have they come against us it won't work praise the lord when you get the squeezing of orange you squeeze the orange one time whatever's on the inside goes up praise the lord it's rapturing going home [Applause] [Music] he's not a man that he shall lie he will come through say god will do what he said he would do he's not meant that he shall lie he will come through no weapon formed against me shall prosper it won't work no weapon fund against me amen do you believe that this morning [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord you may have your seats amen we don't have

and some of the saints from uh beaufort amen south carolina praise the lord and we say god bless you pastor watkins amen and the saints there in beaufort we appreciate you all streaming i was telling brother jason i said you know there are so many other churches uh that's having services one that could they could stream but they chose to join us uh they had a uh uh someone test positive there in the church so they just decided to shut things down very similar to what we did a man just to keep everybody safe and and uh so they decided it was gonna shut things down and and and stream you know our church service this morning so i'm very very happy amen to to have them join us uh in fellowship praise god and i and i trust that as the lord if the lord tarries we'll be able to have brother jason come and actually preach for us praise the lord amen it would be a real blessing to our hearts i i have the the wonderful privilege of being able to be in fellowship on in the mornings um and we just get around and kind of talk on the word of god going through the book of revelations and and uh just you know listening to the different brothers speak it just blesses my heart each one comes from a different angle and and i'm just always leaving their little full so i thank god this morning brother jason had the opportunity to speak and you know just just really appreciate just how the lord uses his ministry he he has the ability to be able to give us a lot more personal experience of kind of growing up in the tabernacle and around those that grew up in the tabernacle and things of that nature so uh very very uh uh you know precious brother just to be in fellowship with so i thank god uh for him uh this morning you all know we haven't been here for a couple weeks so there's a lot of things that i hadn't done that i need to do and one of those things that i didn't do um was the building fund report so i want to do that and before i uh go too far y'all can get that ready for me i want to thank the lord for brother cuicu i praise the lord i want to thank the lord for brother jerry and i want to thank the lord for brother troy [Applause] uh while i was not able to come because of quarantine these brothers carried on the service of the lord and did a wonderful job in bringing the gospel to us so we we just really appreciate appreciate all of them and just uh just all how the lord just used them so we thank you brothers amen for yielding yourselves but let me uh give this building fun update we usually do this at the first of the month and we are coming to uh the close a man of our uh uh building fund drive we had a three-year plan uh of things that we were doing and now we are we're reaching the end of that so next month will probably be the last update that i'll give you like this but uh we thank god for what he has done for us uh our purpose of even raising this money is so that we can get our own church and own school and uh and just so that you know that scripture that brother solomon read here out of isaiah 54 in the school that's going to be the scripture that's going to be on the wall like we have this scripture on the wall back here you know it'll be it'll be the scripture that uh your children be taught of the lord that's going on the wall praise the lord all right so uh we're believing god and you know we we i know that the time is short and hours late but we're gonna be found occupying until jesus comes amen we're gonna be doing something for the lord so uh this is our desire so we had a goal this year uh this is what we said as a goal three years ago a hundred and five thousand dollars a year we were going to try to raise we had pledges towards that goal of fifty four thousand and nine dollars and then what we have received towards our goal year to date is 34 725.96 and i say praise god uh for that i say praise god for that uh i i i only see positive when i look at this these numbers i only see positive everything is growth growth growth amen so i just thank god for that but we received so far year to date 34 000 towards our goal for this year uh 725.96 also in interest we have received 282.46 uh which gives us a total for this year thirty five thousand eight dollars and forty two cents god is good god is good you know um you can take that down um there was a precious brother reached out to me recently and he said um brother jack i just wanted to help you all with your building fund i said okay brother i certainly appreciate that and and um he's in a whole other state and he just sends something via i think um not the other one paypal and he just sends something just you know just keep saying something and the last time he sent something he put a message in there saying i hope brother jack is feeling well and i just want to let my precious brother brother gary know i'm feeling fine amen and and i really appreciate that god gonna get his work done i said god gonna get his work done and uh and i'm on the expectation for god to do great things i heard brother quake who say god got much more in store for spirit and truth tabernacle i said amen i was on the other side y'all couldn't hear me but i said amen brother quaku i i believe that amen god's on the other side of the pandemic just waiting for us to come through amen so i'm on the expectation uh we uh also just last month wanted to just share the lord has also blessed us to uh have this pantry and uh as i as we go to the pantry uh this week you know just kind of struck me this is a place that god has given us to be able to do multiple outreach things and you all know that we do a back to school um uh giveaway and things of that nature and um you know so we're gonna be doing the back to school giveaway there when we do backpacks there's enough kids in the neighborhood for us to serve those kids right the other thing you know when as as we're you know preparing the food to give to the families uh sister ralon uh the daughter of the house a man she lives there in uh north carolina now but she's still a daughter this house and sister roland has this gift of witnessing not only witnessing but she puts together uh things like this she designs the cards and she puts different things on it uh just to encourage people with scripture and uh so with her gift like that you know she she she takes she'll take something like this she'll she'll uh design it and then she'll print it out herself and then she'll send it here to the church first pay for it print it out pay for it send it to the church and all we got to do is take it and put it in a box so every time somebody gets something you know um you know just a box of something there's also a message of hope going inside that box praise the lord [Applause] and uh there is you know there's uh other people that are finding out what we're doing outside of the church and they're saying tell us when we did this turkey giveaway you know they said you should have told us because we would have wanted to give the turkeys right and i'm like you know the lord just kind of seemed like god got his hand on this right and uh and and as as we just get involved and we do what the lord called us to do then god will do everything else so i'm gonna be certainly coming and just letting the church know what is going on because um uh you know we we even our like typically we do christmas giveaways and um you know and this year we didn't do it because we did the turkeys but you know we may have to modify that a little bit i heard of somebody that come through the line and amen and had a little need just to get some gas and uh my wife had told me you know about it i said oh i wish i would have told me right there i would have i would have took some money out of my pocket and gave it to the person right there right down the spot uh but uh the lord just led me to give a little christmas card and i did that and uh you know we have a way to impact lives um you know and you never know when people are hurting and and need hope you have a way to offer them some hope right just through your actions you offer hope to the people and and and ultimately what we're looking for is that these people be sensitive enough to the spirit of god to want to come to church amen if we only get one it's worth it all right praise the lord if we only get one it's worth it all so i want to encourage you church let's continue to do what we're doing for the lord i know the lord will bless us last month we um we gave out 170 boxes of food uh 47 turkeys and we served it looked like we served 500 individuals last month amen from the food pantry praise god praise god so uh you know what we're doing matters it's making a difference and you know those of you that can't come please keep us in prayer you know out there uh that god will just continue to bless the efforts this is uh you know this is something that represents spirit and truth tabernacle amen and we just we just really appreciate the lord uh so i uh also bring you greetings from sarasota uh brother danny steeman pastor there and amen the saints we were there fellowshipping last week and what a time we had in the lord um you know there i i i i was just so blessed you know seeing the saints just entering to the word of god and mine just an explosion took place on sunday morning and just everybody on their feet worshiping and praising god and saints running all through the church and i'm like this is church i can't do this at home in a stream i can't do that but it's an anointing you feel when you get with the saints of god and it just it just pulls things out of you right so i was just i was just so blessed to you know just to see how uh how the lord just moved amen in our midst there and and certainly the saints said they missed you all so much they missed you so much they understand you know these times are a little difficult for us to do what we used to do but i trust god amen that we won't have to wait till we get to heaven where it's completely sanitized i trust god we ain't got to wait till we get to heaven to have fellowship like that i i i'm looking forward to fellowship like that right here praise god amen amen amen i know one preacher tried to blow on the virus that never went nowhere amen but we just gonna keep praying that god will give us deliverance amen all right uh y'all just bear with me amen all right let's um i think i got everything out of the way so let us um stand we'll read the word of god musicians thank you all so much we appreciate you and amen and those that are joining us online god bless you so good to have you forgive us for the time that we're taking today but we haven't been in church together for roughly two weeks and uh we miss each other we miss each other just miss coming and and fellowshipping together so so good to be back in the house of god amen i want to read um a couple scriptures here and this is um somewhat lengthy uh and i want to just maybe um maybe i'll read one i'll let you be seated and i'll pick up the other one uh but uh we uh want to turn to john three verse 26 through 30 and i think i have to go back to john 1 as well and just read a portion of that um we we read this red drum one just a couple weeks ago but i think it's going to connect with what we have to share today uh it will connect john 3 verse 26 through 30 reads as follows it says and they came unto john said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan uh to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him now um what we see in this portion of scripture is um someone is actually trying to bring uh the spirit of division into the church and they want to divide over baptism now we see you baptizing but the one that you baptize not baptizing more people than you right so you know they want to bring division they want to bring competition into the church and uh and the church is not built on that right that that's the devil that does that he divides and conquers but we don't want to allow the enemy you know to to get any glory amen and and that so uh watch this spirit watch how people talk amen even in the church watch how people talk what is your motive for saying what you're saying come on church hey man why why are you saying that what are you trying to build up here amen we all together in this thing all right so so here you know um verse 27 says john answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven right we can't do anything lest god give it to us uh and he says you ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bright groom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bright groom because of the the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease amen i'm just picking up over here in john 1 um i don't want to read all of that what i've had what i had here started verse 19 but let me just kind of um slip down i think um let's let's skip to verse 26 uh verse 25 it says um and they asked him and said unto him why baptize us thou then if thou be not that christ nor elijah not neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptized with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not he it is who is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latch it i'm not worthy to lose these things were done in in beth bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptized in the next day he said the next day john see of jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh the man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and an abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on remaining on him the same as he was baptized with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god shall we

bless you you can be seated we want to take a a title this morning uh behold the lamb of god coming in glory as you saw there what we just read here in john 1 uh john being the first forerunner he made this statement when he saw the lord jesus christ amen coming there after he was answering the questions of the uh the the religious leaders of that day uh pharisees answering their questions and and and then you know he uh he's after they come to church ask the question about you know john who are you we know you we got you got a very unique ministry uh we can see all the people are responding to it there's got to be something about you so they wanted to know they knew that certain scriptures were to be fulfilled and and they were watching john's ministry and they began to ask questions and and they're are you are you that prophet are you a liar so are you this you're like no no i'm not this i'm the voice of one crime in the wilderness you know and here he identifies himself in the scripture but yet they didn't want to believe that part right so uh so here john comes along and and and he says uh he's he says look i'm not he but he is standing in your midst amen the one that you're looking for the one that you're searching for the one that you you're looking to fulfill these scriptures i'm letting you know that man they went to a prophet the prophet told them that man that you're looking for is here now glory to god amen john the prophet identified that jesus was on the earth right then even though john himself didn't even know him can you believe that john didn't even know his own cousin was the fulfillment of this hallelujah to the lamb of god but but but as um you know as john told him this he says he's on the earth the very next day here comes jesus to church and he wants to be baptized of john and uh and john notices that as he sees the spirit of god descending and abiding on christ he knew this was the one this truly was the son of god so john screamed out to the people behold the lamb of god the first forerunner screamed out behold the lamb of god but our title today is behold the lamb of god coming in glory praise the lord stay with me here i want to just start reading from this message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and before um i i i i i go too too far let me just um back us up just a little bit amen this has been a wonderful year [Music] praise the lord hallelujah this has been a glorious year hallelujah church right you know so i i mean i was praying this morning i said i need to have an attitude of gratitude right forget about everything else that has happened i thank god for bringing me through this year amen and that hallelujah so much the lord has done for us you still got uh you still got food in your amen in your cupboards god has provided you got gas in your car god has provided you got a roof over your head god has provided amen they could not take your job god has provided this has been a glorious year amen so you know but as i as i begin to reflect on this year we started the year on a journey amen this being 2020 we started a year on the journey of step into the vision amen and and we brought out how you know everybody got vision for all kind of things and god uh disrupted a lot of people's visions this year amen disrupting their visions now some people actually got new vision because of the disruptions come on somebody some people actually end up in a blessed position because of the disruptions right so so so we thank god that amen he had everything under control and he still does right so so you know we we started out the year saying step into the vision not just your own personal vision of your life and you know your personal vision for your business no but what is god's vision for me as an individual i want to step into that vision and what the lord showed us is that the vision that god had for us was where the prophet was told by the angel of god pick up your pen and write hallelujah and as we just begin to go paragraph by paragraph just trying to break that vision down get inspiration from each paragraph the lord has finally brought us to the last paragraph and we're closing out the year still stand step into the vision glory to god but in this last paragraph as we get to this you know we'll read this quote in a little bit if the lord would allow us but uh we're coming our inspiration of behold the lamb of god coming in glory is coming out of that paragraph we're still in the vision all right now let's pick up this message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever uh here the prophet says we've had years now it says there hasn't been too much done but uh but i truly believe that we're entering into the greatest time this world has ever seen amen i'm saying amen to that they ain't seen nothing yet but we are entering into the greatest time that this world has ever seen i certainly believe that there there uh he said their comet there is coming a time and it's at hand now of god going to make himself manifested what hallelujah to the lamb of god it's at hand now where god is going to make himself manifested now you know church let us not take things for granted amen we um uh we come here a few weeks ago and the lord just began to show us how um you know david uh wrote he says uh uh uh i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart and then i will enter his courts with praise and as the lord just begin to break that down say david as a king could only go as far as he out of court that was as far as he can go so when he came through the door with thanksgiving that was an attitude of gratitude but when he really began to think about what god had done for him danny entered into praise where you know and praise uh involves multiple things praise involves the clapping of the hands praise involves the raising of the voice praise involves just waving your hand like this sometimes praise will cause you to dance a little bit come on somebody praise when you just begin to think about how good god has been to you you can't help but give him praise praise record because of you to lift your voice and sing i will come into his house with singing praise god praise will do that for you right amen but see that's as far as david could go was he out of court amen but we know since jesus died that the temple veil was read from the top to the bottom and brother branham told us that before jesus death if any man went into that holy place a most holy place especially it was good as death if you went into that most holy place he says but now since jesus died if you stay out of the most holy place you'll die praise god so so when we got to that we realized that god we want to go beyond just entering the gates with thanksgiving we want to go beyond just entering the course with praise and what we found brother branham said god will take you into the pentecostal shekinah amen hallelujah and we're still underneath that anointing every time i come through the church tours i am looking for the pentecostal shekinah [Applause] see when i read this quote where it says god gonna make himself manifested we saw god do that right here in our midst praise god and i'm looking for more like like like the man that was eating watermelon they said did you enjoy it say yes i enjoyed it he says but it's got to be more where that came from and yes i enjoyed that service where god amen met us here through speaking in tongues and interpreting but it's got to be more where that came from hallelujah church glory to god let me finish reading this he says believe that there is coming a time and it's at hand now of god going to make yourself manifested the greatest the greatest he's ever done in all ages this is the ending up of the time time will be no more one of these days we come out of eternity stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time back into eternity we was before there was a world i like that we was before there was a world we were in god's thoughts right it says then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown uh to us now glory to god i want to read that again he says we was before there was a world there then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now glory and now in here we've had our savior come here to the earth god himself made himself manifested to us and give us the hope of everlasting life eternal life and also in there he promised us joy and happiness and contentment which is the earnest of our salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance now look at that promise he promised you joy and happiness and contentment if you don't have that this morning tell the devil to give it back because god promised it to you blessed be the name of the lord he promised me joy and happiness and contentment it's the earnest of our salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance praise the lord let me go on a little further here amen this is coming out of the sermon uh trying to do god a service without it being god's will amen uh i'm reading from there paragraph 219 it says now we find out glory to god that uh when these thoughts come uh stop uh when these stalks gathers come when when these thought gathers comes together they form their own idea and no matter when the new issue as they call it come forth out of the assemblies of god what did they do they couldn't receive it no matter how much truth it was the baptism in the name of jesus christ they were already the general counsel man had done took it over the spirit had done left them amen right and this come forth i've talked to some of your best leaders they say well what what uh well what would we do now they would embarrass themselves when they know it's the truth if they don't they're spiritually blind and ignorant to the bible not saying that nasty now saying that reverently because there's not a place in the bible where anybody was ever baptized using those titles look at this father son and holy ghost and never was used to the after the economical council the roman catholic church their own catechism witnesses the same thing it's a catholic dogma not a bible doctrine but a catholic dogma and you methodists brought out your catechisms and everything just like they had just gradually growing out of it and now when you come to pentecost and spread out some of those dogmas you still held on to them look at this and but now is the bride calling now is when the seven seals has been open now when the complete things that's the that the reformers left has to be open and only malachi 4 can do that because it takes the revelation straight from god to an individual to do so that's right it can't come to a group never did one man that's what god promised in the shadows of the coming for his pride and eliezer see oh i love that see behold the lamb of god coming in glory now you know i i had that quote there and uh i was so blessed because brother troy just walked right up here on wednesday night and just walked right into my sermon i love when god does that i love when god does that it just vindicates where you're supposed to be and there were some things that you know he was just bringing out and and and i just want to kind of go back and hit this and in uh genesis 24. uh let's just kind of pick this up glory hallelujah thank you jesus now he says uh god was gonna sinner eliezer and what we realized is that brother branham's message brother branham's ministry was to be the eliezer and what his purpose was amen is to identify a bride a man to find a bride there was a time in brother branham's life where he kept having this dream of going back to the public service company he used to work for the public service company he kept having his dream of going back and he remembered some things that happened he remember uh paying for a breakfast and and maybe he didn't pay enough money for the breakfast and he just couldn't figure out why god kept bringing this dream wasn't something that he needed to make right and he just it just bothered him so much he began to pray and just seek the lord so finally one day he asked god uh for something he said god i asked for a vision you wouldn't give me a vision i asked for a dream you wouldn't give me a dream he says i'm gonna do something then and before he told the church what he did he told the church saying now don't do this don't do this he says but i i just needed something from god and it says uh he just closed his bible hallelujah it says god this this this this dream that keep coming and and i can't get the interpretation i don't know why you keep saying it if it's something i need to make right i'll make it right but god i just don't know what to do so lord i'm going to close my bible it says and when i open it hallelujah let me find a place somebody in scripture that i could identify with somebody that i can see myself in and say when i see that character in scripture then it will satisfy me then i know i got an answer to my dream hallelujah if you want an answer to your dream you better find it in the scripture praise the lord somebody amen don't find an answer in your feelings don't find an answer in your emotions you better find the answer in the scripture hallelujah glory to god right so so brother branham had his eyes closed and just opened up the bible and when he opened up the bible here he landed on genesis chapter 24 and when he saw the story of genesis 24 he knew what his job was as a public servant oh hallelujah get this as a public servant his job was to find the bride amen that was his whole job find the bride find the ones that want to get married to jesus oh glory to god amen i'm so glad that he chose me church i'm so glad that he that he had confidence in me that he would want to marry me blessed be the name of the lord amen let's pick this up now in genesis 24 because we're talking about lebron now now as i read this i want you to get you are represented in this scripture this wasn't just the story that happened in the bible but you are represented in this scripture brother branham's ministry is represented in this scripture we're going to read it but you know when when eliezer found rebecca and he got rebecca back to amen back to isaac you know eliezer was not found anymore he was not talked about anymore amen but we got to get rebecca connected to isaac and until we can get rebecca connected to isaac then we got to talk to elieza we got to hear what eliezer is saying until we can get rebecca connected to isaac until we can get the bride connected with christ until we can get you following the word of god living the word of god expressing the word of god we got to tell you what elise is saying because eliza has a very specific job hallelujah hallelujah his job is go get my son a pride let's pick this up let's pick it up let's pick it up this is us this is us in scripture amen i was gonna try to skip around this but i can't skip around it just let me start at verse one start at verse one and abraham was old well stricken now abraham is representing the father in this god the father abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things now i took that when i say what wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute don't read that too fast don't read it too fast i'm abraham c praise the lord if i'm abraham's seed you know how i'm supposed to be blessed and where i'm supposed to be blessed in all things not just some things whatever my hand touches i'm supposed to be blessed praise god amen wherever your foot treads god is going to give it to you if you tread a man in some business looking for business god will come god gonna give it to you come on somebody hallelujah whatever you touch supposed to be blessed blessed are blessing your house blessed on your job come on blessing your family blessed amongst your friends blessed in your neighborhood bless bless bless [Music] amen blessed in all things amen look verse 2 says and abraham said unto his his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had he says put i pray thee thy hand under my my thigh and i will make the answer amen i'll make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of cain of the canaanites among whom i dwell now abraham can see how these people live abraham say i don't want my son marrying one of these women now look at this amen said no i don't want and and and i i might as well say this because i feel it's it's necessary our parents it's okay for you to tell your children no i'ma say it again it's okay for you to tell your children no no not that one it's okay to tell now if they go out and do it on their own that's on them praise the lord but it's okay for you to stand up and say no that ain't the one for you and someone said well i don't want my child to be upset with me no no no no it's okay if they get us upset they will get over it amen praise the lord amen abraham was very specific don't you give my son one of these women around here it's going to be trouble for him hallelujah to the lamb of god let's go on a little further in this he says verse 4 but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac hallelujah now look at eliezer says and the servant said unto him adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me until the land uh mo uh must i need to bring my son again into the land from west alcamus so he's saying this he says now if the if i go to try to find a wife for isaac and the woman won't follow me to this land because i'm i'm coming a long way how i know this lady gonna walk by faith come on somebody gonna trust me one man and maybe a few servants with him i know this lady gonna trust my story and come back with me he said he said he said now if she don't do it will i need to come and get isaac and then take isaac as proof this is what he's saying now look at abraham's response here in verse six glory to god and abraham said unto him beware that thou art thou that thou bring not my son this again i love that statement abraham is telling telling eliezer saying now look if the woman won't come we'll deal with that but one thing i want you to always remember eliza i'm old i'm well stricken and aged don't you ever praise god hallelujah to the lamb of god don't you ever take my boy down there to that land where he came from now abraham knew it was worse down there abraham had already come out of idolatry abraham had already been delivered so he did want his son to go down and get tangled up in that thing that he got got delivered from hallelujah that's why it's okay for you to tell your children no don't let them go get tangled up in the things that god has already delivered you from god look some careers you need to tell your children no every career is not of god the devil is sitting there waiting for them to get involved in some things hallelujah somebody amen it's okay to say no i don't think that's the will of god right no i i don't see that as god i don't see and sometimes people look at you and they think uh you're just so hard you're so no no no no i'm trying to keep you i'm trying to spare you from some trouble down the road you can't even see what the devil got got you set up for sometimes our youth only think about the money they don't think about the spiritual side of it you only think about the money you can have a big fat bank account but the bible asks you a question the bible got a question for you with a big fat bank account what does it profit the bible says what does it profit a man to gain this whole world and then lose his soul see i'm gonna watch over my soul before i watch over anything else amen i i i thank god you know i thank god for people that got conviction praise the lord i i thank god i mean everybody ain't got conviction you know i i'm just i'm gonna have to share this on one of my sisters i'm gonna call her name but i i must say i thank god for i've called at different times while she's been away and she's on her way to church i'm driving going to church trying to find the church wherever it's the city that she's going to i thank god for that type of conviction because i know some young people that don't think about church when they leave and then when they get back they don't forget about church that's why it's okay parents to say no i'ma say this um some of y'all want to be uh uh social media uh models social media models that's what you want to be i'm saying i'ma say this in the message you know brother branham had a brother that that was uh that he knew he said that the brother was approached by some uh organization they just want to take a picture of his daughter and put it on on front of something and the brother said no you will not take my daughter and and advertise her like that you won't do what the back then those people knew that there were spirits that was behind that stuff i know a pastor that had a daughter that wanted to be a model and the pastor couldn't get this thing out of her head couldn't get out of here so he told all he can tell us they say say dear what you need to do is set yourself some boundaries he says when you drive in a car you know especially when you're driving in the mountains they put a guard rail around the mountain that's to establish a boundary so you don't go off to go off the edge of the mountain so they put a guardrail saying what you need to do is put out your own guardrails how far are you going to go so that's all he could leave with her so one day while she was modeling praise the lord they uh they invited her to come to something and then and they uh they said now you're gonna walk the runway you're gonna walk with this dress on and you're gonna walk with this and next thing you know it got tighter and tighter shorter and shorter to eventually almost nothing and uh and when she got back from walking down the runway and should get back and see what the next thing they wanted her to go out she had a guardrail and she'd say i quit [Music] you got to establish your own guardrails amen because i'ma tell you if the holy ghost was a guard rail in your life you wouldn't get involved in some of the things that you get involved with it's okay parents to say lord amen no sir all right church can i keep on reading about abraham and amen eliezer because eliza and his my imma take isaac to a certain place and abraham say whatever you don't take my boy down into that environment isaac i'm gonna tell y'all another thing isaac was 40 years old right amen do you talk about being grown isaac was grown but his 90-something year old 100 something your daddy still said amen i'm gone i can do what i want yeah no praise god i'm still saying no and i'm gonna tell you i'ma say no because god gonna hold me accountable so i'ma lift my voice and i know to tell you no so god won't hold it over me god i told him no i told him that ain't right y'all gonna let me preach it ain't right praise god amen it's all right to tell them no amen amen you know you can't just be buddy buddy with your children they only got one parent they you can get a whole bunch of friends they all over the place you get all kind of people to follow you on social media those are your friends praise god amen but i'm your daddy i'm your mama and you ain't got but one of them all right amen amen amen all right i'm gonna try to go on see this what happened when you don't preach for weeks hey man hey man stay with me i'm cut i mean i today i i wanted to try to get to that friend of the bridegroom but i i i doubt that it's gonna happen i'm explaining to y'all what that's all about i read that for a reason but uh but if i don't get to it i'll be back next week amen by the grace of god but let me read this says uh verse 6 says and abraham said unto him beware that thou that thou bring not my son to dither again the lord god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and and uh and that swearing to me saying unto thy seat will i give this land see i don't want my son to go down there and get confused with them people hallelujah what he was also saying that look if she won't come he ain't going to get her he ain't going to compromise the go-getter can i say it again he's not going to compromise to go get her she gonna have to leave where she at to come to him not only she gotta leave it by faith oh rebecca are you ready to leave what you doing are you ready to trust that isaac is better for you than the things that you're going through glory to god a man you never met before back then you can see no picture of isaac now i mean what were they going to do carve it on a stone this was isaac it wasn't in color praise the lord amen amen amen you you can have amen the johnson's taking a picture saying now send that down at a rebecca no she had to go by faith and i want to tell you something amen when you following this word you have to come by faith even though you don't understand everything even though you can't see everything but are you willing to trust god by faith hallelujah glory to god look at this he says uh uh from the land my kindred and were speaking to me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will i give the lamb he shall send his angels before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not he's repeating it only bring not my son dither again whatever you do you'll be free from the oath but never take my son down there now you go with my to go with the testimony that i'm going to share with you but don't take my son into that environment now you know i mean uh uh let me just uh interject this had isaac ended up down there where uh where rebecca was it it's a possibility that isaac would have got connected with rebecca's brother y'all bible readers in here isaac could have got connected with rebecca's brother and rebecca's brother had a very strong influence oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me he had a he had a really bad influence praise the lord amen i mean and i mean sometime he blessed in the lord because when he heard about eliezer oh praise the god come on praise god i'm so glad to hear that you're here we got we got things worked out of the house come on down to the house oh my god and i'm glad elijah was the type of man that he was i don't want to stay here come on somebody preach back to me this morning elita said i ain't staying here i come with a purpose give me the pride i'm sharing my testimony will she go but you realize that daddy had nothing to say about whether rebecca was leaving or not according to the scriptures only two people speaking on rebecca's behalf until rebecca spoke for herself that was her mother and her brother and brother branham say the mother represent the church but the brother represent the preacher in the church come on somebody sometimes that's what you dealing with the church and the preacher in the church but rebecca you got to stand up on your own you can't let mama talk for you you can't let your brother talk for you you got to talk for yourself the question come to rebecca will you go the answer was yes i'll go here here here here her brother laban what we see about him you know is that he trying to delay the thing he tried to delay this testimony don't delay don't whatever you do don't delay when god speaks to you get in a hurry about what he's doing he tried to delay things but but laban got got something else in his mind how can we tell that how can we tell that because it comes out later in his life amen here comes jacob he ends up in laban's house amen and when jacob get down at a labor house he go through all kinds of trials with laban he the bible says that his wages was changed ten times can you imagine working for a man like that you show up the day to work y'all gonna let me preach you show up the day to work and he and i yesterday he told you i'm gonna pay you 25 dollars an hour you're like praise god and then you show up the next day i'm giving you ten dollars an hour you said 25 and then they come back not well okay i'm gonna give you i know i know that one right i'm gonna give you 35 an hour okay praise the lord all right it's working out i'm dropping that back back to 15. 10 times going through stuff like that and you know what right with all him going through that he didn't quit now i know you're going through some trials on your job but don't quit i'ma tell you i was never quit on a job never quitter actually what they had to do is fire me and when you fire me i know god doesn't close the door praise the lord and i'ma find something else to go to but i ain't gonna quit i'm gonna just sit here and go through why god is shaping and forming my character in the midst of this trial believing jacob shows up down there and and jacob uh see a uh uh uh uh one of his daughters you know he sees uh he sees rachel's like oh yes yes yes yes yes i i will work seven years for her and he and i let me just drop this insisted if a young man won't work if a young man won't work you got a problem on your hands [Music] praise the lord don't marry him unless he's working now he may lose his job and you got to stay right there with him but you ought to see work ethic not him saying well how much you make [Laughter] how much you make you know we can do this we we can it don't sound like we sound like me i sound like i'm doing it praise the lord amen amen so if he ain't working you better watch that glory to god any high right so so so you know but the thing of it is is you know he'd get down there and he said yeah i'll work for her i got no problem working for her i i i will i would give everything i got to work for her i swept many a dates with her he said okay all right seven years well come the wedding day this is what would have happened to isaac had he been down there in this type of environment come the wedding day and you know they got the veil over the face oh lord help us jesus they put that veil over the face so you can't see your wife and the only time you lifted the veil was actually when you got into a secret place then you knew who the wife was well they dressed up this woman it wasn't rachel it was her sister leah they dressed up real good and made her smell real good and jacob just like man just just i can't wait till i see my wife tonight when he get there to his tent and take the veil off he realized he had been tricked hallelujah this is the type of man laban was not only that amen when when they finally got things worked out he had to work a seven more years amen in order to have both leah and rachel as his wife well when it was time for him to leave leaping when it's time for him to leave laban now praise the lord there was something happening inside laban's house and then his daughters actually say you know what we're going to leave with you jacob but they went to daddy's house and stole daddy's gods see what would happen if if if if if if abraham would not have established do not take my son into that city where i come from hallelujah it's sometimes it's good for you not to go back where you came from it's good to not go back where you came from well let me just ride down no don't ride down nothing don't be going back where you came from i'ma just go check them out don't check nobody out hallelujah when rebecca left that city she never turned back and when you leave where god brought you from never go back praise god see abraham had to establish some things don't you take my son down there i know my people look you know your cousins you know your uncle you know your auntie the main people you should be hanging with [Applause] praise god i know that that sometimes that don't go over well but you know they send in you know them people sinning and you get caught up in the midst of something like that no god i ain't hanging out here no no no no no no no no no no no no and that's why i say it's okay to tell you to know you ain't going to that house right you're not you are not spending the night i can't preach my sermon today you you are not spending the night well

people was down there god damn brought me out of god promised me this over here god ain't promising me nothing where i come from praise the lord so i ain't going back my land that's not my land praise god so so as as as laban you know uh jacob decides to leave and takes both his wives rachel and leah with them rachel steals the gods amen and when laban come to find where the gods were rachel was sitting on top of the gods praise the lord amen uh deceiving on daddy it was not the only reason she would deceive her own daddy because her daddy was a deceiver apple didn't fall far from the tree her daddy deceived her husband all right somebody glory to god any high right but but but but rachel amen and leah knew that daddy served false gods idol gods abraham say don't let my son get caught up in that idolatry i wonder what are some of the idols we have in our lives today some of us idolize ourselves it's the truth anyhow amen the this this selfie society you know selfie wasn't even a word until this day amen it was not even in the dictionary until this day just going to get gas the other night and as i'm pulling up in the gas station i see this young lady and a young man i don't

surprised at what they you know it's drugs and i mean people get people high to do certain things amen amen get them high go don't lay something with drugs and now you you don't even you out of your mind praise the lord amen and you don't like oh lord help us jesus you don't you don't start it out real simple next thing you know you're in a porn video and you wonder how you got there that's why this is why abraham was so specific don't you let my son go down there parents keep your kids out of certain places let me keep reading let me keep reading all right amen um uh what verse was i on okay verse eight it says and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nehor and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water now he that's very strategic what eleazar's doing taking my camels i'm taking 10 camels and i'm just going to make them kneel down right here you know outside the city now look at this it says uh and he made his camel to kneel down without the city by well of water at the time of the evening glory even the time that women go out to draw water now he knew that this was the time of day in the evening time the closing of the day this is when the women would come out of the city to actually get water now he's looking for a wife he's looking for a wife so he positions himself he's uh the women are coming now but but but but you know when they come i'm looking for a very specific woman it's got to be a kinsmen she's got to be kin to abraham watch this watch this look at this oh lord help us jesus um he says uh verse verse 12 and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham i even liked the way he prayed notice what he said oh lord god of my master abraham that means he done seeing god answer prayer for abraham hallelujah you might not answer my prayer but i know you the god of abraham would you please would you please he says i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water lord i'm in position now for a blessing get yourself in position to receive a blessing amen amen glory to god amen amen amen it says and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down that picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed i love the way brother troy brought that out on wednesday night rebecca was just not any type of woman rebecca was actually an appointed woman rebecca had already been designed the things that she had gone through in her life had made her the woman she was she grew up a certain way so so when she came to the well she was already appointed or should i say predestinated by god amen hallelujah this one's just any type of woman there was a lot of women that was getting rid of a lot of young ladies i should say get ready to come to the well but he wanted the one that was appointed and he said i'm going to be able to tell her by this sign look at it again verse 14 and let it come to pass that the dancer to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has shown kindness unto my master it goes on in verse 15 and it came to pass now look at this came to pass before he had done speaking while he was praying come on y'all and this is what this is this is what we talk we call immediate results anybody looking for some immediate results i'm going to tell you something why are you praying god can answer amen before you even say amen the answer's coming knocking at your door that's what we're looking for some immediate answers look at this and and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethuel son of milker the wife of nehor abraham's brother with a picture on her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon she's pretty a virgin she's pure amen neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up look at this and the servant ran to me to eliezer ran to meet rebecca it said random meter and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy picture so this is the setup question can i just have a little bit of water from your picture but look at her response rebecca is a woman of character glory to god look at this now it says uh and verse 18 and she said drink my lord and she hates it and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink glory and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and notice this in verse 20 she wasn't a lazy woman praise the lord somebody she was not a lazy woman amen hey amen praise god praise god that's one thing sis that your husband is out working all day but he should not have to come home to a dirty house you're not working he coming home to a dirty house the cook i mean ain't nothing on the stove and what what you want to eat what do i want to eat we just went grocery shopping yesterday you couldn't find nothing what do i want to eat yeah i mean just put something together ain't ain't no way i should be coming home cooking and you ain't even working what were you doing all day laying around being lazy what were you doing all day praise the lord right that should not be the case amen amen glory to god got the man working like that well i just wanted to see what you gonna put together what imma put together amen amen church amen sometimes we wonder why marriages have problems because we just don't do the little things amen we just don't do little things now you know and then we then you know and don't give me you know i know that uh uh brother branham teaches us that it's it's you know if if the wife doesn't have to work if she doesn't have to work right it's good for the husband just kind of take care of that and then also let her be in a position where she can take care of the kids that's what brother manatee that's i think that's that's that's a blessing sometimes especially here where we live sometimes that's not possible so that's why i don't force that on people right i don't i don't come and preach that as doctrine that your your wife shouldn't work i don't preach it as doctrine if you if you're in position and some brothers are in position to take care of their family but they still push their wife out there to work yeah praise the lord and now you pushing her out there to work and now she ain't got i'm not she all wore out working all these extra hours trying to get money in your bank account and now you wanted to come home and do all this other stuff praise what no now you do it you pushed out there you do it praise the lord hey man you make enough money where she ain't got to be working like that that's not where she should be now that you go through seasons in life god help me here you go through seasons when you got kids the mama want to be home to raise her kids and let me tell you something in a day like now you're gonna want your wife to be home raising kids not sending them to school amen the bible say all the tables are full of vomit and i'm telling you even in school it is full of vomit so you want your wife to be able to be home and raise them kids praise the lord amen if you're in position or if you ain't there pray that you can get there now there might come a later time in life where all the kids are gone and now your wife might want to work just to get a little extra money nothing wrong with these things praise the lord church nothing wrong with these things but all i'm saying sis is don't be lazy be a proverbs 31 woman always got something going great lord you got a little side business at home that you running amen amen you can sell just about anything anywhere lord help us god i can't even preach today my wife used to help us out all the time but i mean you know she wasn't working but she she'll find something and sell it and and she was shipping packages all the time but she made a little money it helped it helped help out the house praise god i appreciate that amen oh lord i know i know a young couple hear the the husband struggling trying to make it i mean he didn't know how the bills was going to get paid he like i don't know what's man i i don't i'm trying this i'm trying to then didn't realize what was going and the wife just like we're going to be all right we're going to be all right um she had received ten thousand dollars from a relative and then tell him nothing about it and said to myself i just got to keep this just in case you know things don't work out between him and i i'ma tell y'all that mindset is a divisive mindset i mean i hear i'm working struggling trying to get these pain you just sitting on the money gaining interest on it well i can't tell him everything why did you marry him you got to keep secrets from them why did you marry them same thing for a husband if you got to keep secrets from your wife i can see keeping secrets from other people but from your wife no you don't do that no she should know everything honey this is oh lord have mercy there used to be stories show up in the news that man die wife didn't know he had accounts here and accounts there and you know who get the money the state your family your family broke church got to bury you and don't nobody know you got all this money stashed in an account over here your wife shouldn't know that i can't tell everything she'll spit it off you got to work through that praise the lord any high amen i'm just trying to read the bible but you know we shouldn't be this way church you know i mean if there's anybody you can be transparent with that is with your spouse if you're not transparent with your spouse y'all really do not have a relationship amen you fake phony hypocrites amen praise the lord put her name on all your accounts sister put his name on all your accounts don't let the state get it amen praise god i don't even know what verse i'm on i'm i'm i'm i'm i am i think i was trying to stop on the verse i think i was trying to stop um okay well let me just read the uh uh was it uh 20. and she hasted and emptied a picture into the into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and and and drew for all his camels now he took ten camels i heard a preacher one time say that a camel would actually drink 20 gallons of water one camel one camel drink 20 gallons of water now she going to a well and now the bible says she went hastily that's exactly right can you you got to see rebecca running to the well getting what dropping this picture down there getting getting the water out and then running to just pour it in a trough and i know there ain't gonna be enough of that camel run back costly now i wanna i want you to know a camel will drink 20 gallons of water by himself 10 camels meant 200 gallons and rebecca didn't ask for no help rebecca can handle this on her own 200 gallons very used to this can you imagine all the other girls coming to the well at the same time them seeing rebecca just run back and forth hallelujah i want to tell you something rebecca was rewarded for her efforts she got rewards right there on the spot i mean eliza gave her some gifts right there on the spot gave her gifts i'm telling you my god my god the holy spirit is here giving us gifts rewarding us for our faithfulness blessed be the name of the lord rewarding us for our faithfulness church right and so so here eliza you know is watching this and he's like oh and after she finished he just let he didn't even help her you know oh come on church the reason that eliezer would help us because it was an answer to his prayer he got to see how she does things and by watching her and that instant he can see what type of character rebecca has he can understand so this is kind of oh i know my master gonna be pleased with getting i noticed bible said that she was uh um she was fair to look upon which means she was pretty she had three characteristics bear to look upon she was a virgin and she was a worker see i mean he didn't just want her just because she looked pretty oh lord you better watch what you married just because she looked good now i'mma say the same thing about the brother sister you better watch what you married just because he looked good now things will change praise the lord hallelujah all right leave it like that but ellie's was watching her character you know through this whole process and and when she finished actually getting uh everything together he said he said now whose daughter are you because he already knew what he prayed oh glory to god now as i was reading this story amen eliezer say after she revealed you know i'm i'm the thule's daughter and and you know and we got we got we got we got uh a place for you to stay just come on to our house the bible said she took off running to her house and she went to go tell everybody you know what it just happened to her but but she never actually hurt glory to god before she took off running she never actually heard eliezer's side of the story [Music] praise the name of the lord it was only after eliezer came to the house amen here uh uh uh uh her brother laban comes back to the well where the camels are and then he says he says you know we got we got room for you come on to the house he said he said well i'm pleased to come with that set down eight and then he began to explain why he was there he said this is the prayer that i prayed i say lord you know send this uh i know the women are coming out at a certain time but send one that's gonna not only give me drink but also give my camels drink and when i said amen to my prayer before i could say amen rebecca was there doing exactly what i asked god for her to do when rebecca heard the testimony say oh my i didn't realize i was even apart i didn't know i was a part of the prayer i know i was a part of the vision i want to tell you church you are a part of the vision pick up your pen and write you are a part of the vision and that's why i've been saying all year it's time for you to step into the vision rebecca brother mama began to say well you know just wait just a little bit before you try to take us i know i'm ready to go now please release and i just need to know where she go with me because he already knew if she won't come i'm released from my responsibility i'm telling you this is a tight because brother branham's job was to go and get a rebecca and rebecca has to make her own decision as to whether she's going to follow the word or not i'm going to present it to her i'm going to give her the truth i'ma tell exactly what you said to say and i'm gonna give it to a i'm gonna give it to a wrong i'm gonna give it to her straight now it's up to her to make her decision here she was being influenced by mama her daddy had nothing to say mama and her brother is speaking up for the church and the preacher in the church is trying to keep her from going to meet isaac did i i told you she had no picture of isaac all she had is a testimony of his character glory to god glory to god i um i want to just slip down i'm trying to maybe i can just try to find a way out just bear with me here i want to read this quote out of spoken words the original seed rebecca went rebecca went to isaac she was blessed to go with isaac and um and and the lineage of jesus christ even comes through all of this so we thank god for this testimony we are found in scripture as that rebecca amen look at this spoken word is the original seed says uh the messenger of malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time where all we we are all looking for him we believe he will come this that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see uh he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by god's word and vindicated god will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth and this is what you know uh the message he saw brother branham here's the angel actually saying this about brother branham's ministry brother branham didn't have to vindicate his ministry god did and i'm going to tell you something i don't have to vindicate brother brandon's ministry amen god did you don't have to vindicate brother brandon's ministry god already did it god did so many supernatural things that only god could do no man could do those things god did it amen says um he says uh uh he would be correctly dedicated to the word uh as they have always been indicated by god's word and vindicated god would vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did elijah for it is elijah coming making ready for the mount zion rapture jesus said in the last days it should be like lots time now i could drop in there real quick jesus said the last day to be like last time this election this election is bringing that scripture to pass praise the lord i'm just letting you know that this election will bring scripture to pass and when it comes to past what we're looking for is the coming of the lord i'm not looking to stay here this land is not my land praise the lord but one day this is going to be purged then i'll come back and live on it amen amen amen but he says in the last days it would be like lost time his preaching will be with the spirit and strength line of god's word because so much has been called god's truth many will misunderstand this messenger i got wrote here p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y prophecy because uh so much has been called god's truth by fakers many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger true ministers will misunderstand the messenger can you get that true ministers good men misunderstand amen no it wasn't he didn't brother branham didn't deceive nobody you just got a misunderstanding praise the lord look at this as the end time prophecies we'll repeat i believe and this is the last paragraph of this uh uh pick up your pen and write i'm reading it from the original time brother branham shared it out of spoken words original seed part two this is the last paragraph of it but i haven't got to you know the uh the church age book we'll save that for a later time but we'll come back next sunday we'll finish it off because i got some other things i got to share about the friend of the bridegroom but here uh as the as the end time prophecy will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and crime behold the lamb of god the second forerunner which is brother branham's ministry the second foreigner forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people now look at this statement pointing the people to a word born bride i like that statement pointing the people to a word born the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god will come forth from his lips god help us to be ready for this near event i better leave it from right here now that when i was just thinking on the the statement there that will be pointed uh they point the people to a word born bride not point to people to anything else not pointing to people you know i mean you would think he might say point the people to jesus he says point the people to not wasn't even brother bran i'm saying that that was the angel said that point the people to a word born bride what that tells me is that we as individuals got to recognize who we are see when when when rebecca recognized that she was a part of the vision she quickly got in step with the vision and when we recognize who we are we're going to get in step with what god has called us to be and a word born bride i want to just read these things about about what what this lord just kind of showed me say that the same word this is the quote that's coming out of the comforter but i won't read it the same word that was made flesh talking about jesus christ now the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh i'm talking to the word born bride the word that became flesh has now become our flesh let me go in with another statement that the prophet said uh if we don't compromise with that word we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when he was made flesh because your flesh holds it your flesh is holding the promise it may not look like it but i'm reading to you i'm reading to the word born bride your flesh is holding it right now it ain't coming you're holding it i got something else to say to the word born blind here's the secret of it the word is in the bride as it was in mary the word ain't coming in the word is already in just like it was in mary i'm talking to the word porn pride here's another one i hope you're ready for it i want to tell you something because he was looking for uh he was looking for uh this woman with character and what we found out is that rebecca not only had character a man she was she was pretty and she was a virgin glory to god and i want to tell you something you are the pure virtuous sinless pride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sin at the first place you are perfect [Applause] this is the word born bride that he's talking to can i give you another one the bride has the mind of christ but she knows what he wants done with the words she performs the command of the word in his name for she has not gonna get but she already has thus saith the lord and since you have just said the lord why not open your mouth wider and wider and wider please god amen amen the word is quickened by the spirit and then it comes to pass hallelujah here's another one that i want to give you my god when a spirit born word born amen spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart places it upon his lips oh my talking to the world born why that is the same as deity speaking i love this promise every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man that's the word born pride we must recognize who we are i got one other statement i need to make to you the word born brought is ordained to destroy the works of the devil amen [Applause] there's a quote here where brother branham brings it out of spoken words original scene i'm going to paragraph 328 in this and it's a quoting from first john 3 8 first john 3 8 says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for the purpose for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil in this quote he says now christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil do you believe that he says now i can't explain all this i'm just gonna go through it just quickly now hit the high place so you won't stay too long christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right do you all believe that that's that's why what was he god's word he was god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil look at this now his body that mean don't run from no devils don't don't be running from the devil now you're the body of christ and if he was born to destroy the work of the devil then guess what your job is that's right and that that means don't pity pat with the devil if you see the devil destroy his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that's right if christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as he as his head was that's right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head that's right see i thought about this story and i'm gonna say this in closing um we're born to destroy the works of the devil you know only only the bride only the bride the body of christ can can actually destroy the works of the devil on our little call that we have in the mornings when brothers are preaching and bringing out things and one brother brought out the story of of esther you know and esther's day heyman had developed this plot that he was going to kill all the jews he said man i'm killing everybody say you know i'm tired of this and he went to kill everybody because of one guy that would not honor him by bowing to him i'm gonna tell you there's always gonna be one that ain't gonna bow even in the days of the hebrew boys there was a couple that would not bow everybody else on the face but hebrew wasn't no i ain't going down like that no i i whatever fire or throw me in fire i mean but i ain't going down like that i'm not gonna forsake my god and we need people with conviction like that but here in haman's uh uh uh haman and mordecai mordecai just would not bow to haman so heyman come up with this plan said we're gonna kill all the jews we're just tired of this because of what mordecai's doing we're gonna kill all the jews now i want y'all to catch that because i i'm gonna be a preacher that's probably i'm not gonna bow i'm not gonna bow i'm not bound to the homosexual agenda i'm not bowing man we don't bow to women preachers we don't power it has to be in the word if it's against the word we are not bowing to go against the word of god that's just this church praise the lord right a lot of other stuff we just we're not going to bow so you know i don't know what that's going to mean someday but we're not bound and um so you know uh uh mordecai mordecai wouldn't bow so hey and say you know what uh we're gonna we're gonna destroy them all because this one guy won't bow we're gonna we coming against everybody well mordecai gets word to esther nestor like i don't know if i should go and do this and you know i mean i could dive to kingdom come and say look um you know ain't nothing but a miracle for you to be in the presence of that king he said who knows that god might have brought you into the kingdom for such a time as this she said oh okay let me think i said all right y'all y'all fast and y'all praying and saying and after after we fast and pray in three days i am going before the king no matter if he called me or not i'm going for the king and she said if i perish let me perish but i'm going to go before the king and esther went now esther represents the bride right so esther goes before the king and and uh and she invites the king to a banquet and you know and the king like well what's your request i want to invite you to banquet not just you but you and haman invite to the banquet and uh and they come to the banquet and uh and they're just having a good time and and and the king said well what is it that you want as to what is that you want i've already stretched out the step to t and everything tell me what you want say well actually i just one more day i want to have another banquet tomorrow and would you you and haman come oh haman thought it was the world i've been invited by the queen and the king to sit there at a banquet but in the meantime he's just coming up with a plan billing gallows to destroy esther's uncle mordecai got the gallows built comes to the banquet the next day and he was before we come to the bank when he'd come to the king that morning to try to get permission to be able to hang mordecai but before he can get the words out of his mouth king said you know i've been reading i'm glad you're here i've been reading what is it king i've been reading what would you do for a man that that has that did something for the king but never got honored a man that did so for the king it never got honor i'm sure i'm the man well uh i would do it this way i would take a horse i would send my greatest man before him i'd take a horse and put him on top of the horse and i would just let him ride through and say this is how the king honors those that honor the king king that's what i would do he said that's what you do say now go do that for mordecai and i want you to walk with the horse the very man he was coming to destroy that day he just walking through the city so down and out by the time he finished he'd go home and somebody knock him down it's time to come to dinner time to come to dinner has to say you want to do he couldn't even get a spear so king environments come into the house with esther and esther bring both the king and haman in and king eat again and what's as to what is that you that you want king i just want some kind of way for you to reverse this now i want you to understand this esther was the only one as the bride that could destroy the work of haman that's right amen amen amen i got that from my that that study that i'd be in on the mornings i think brother eugene braun brought that out but esther was the only one that could actually destroy amen the work of haman amen nobody else in the kingdom had that place of authority but esther was brought to the kingdom to destroy the work of haman amen and you've been brought here to this earth to destroy the work of the devil amen while they're revealing haman has come up with this plan to destroy all my people what people who's your people all the jews you're a jew yes i am and i am queen too praise god amen haman didn't know what to do did he almost the king say now you're gonna force my wife in my presence you gotta he's trying to beg for mercy and all this and i'm sorry you put this on yourself amen and then somebody came and revealed to the king you know what haman just last night built these gallows he was gonna kill mordecai the same guy he was walking through the city he was planning on killing him king take haman to the gallows himself and hang him on his own gallows born to destroy the works of the devil amen the word born bride i'm speaking to you amen this is part one we'll come back to part two behold the lamb of god amen coming in glory god bless you let's have a word of prayer musicians can come also brother solomon i'll just turn the service right over to you god we thank you for your word thank you father for your truth help us to see lord what where we stand the hour in which we live it's a great time greatest time of all history help us to see lord the where where all these different characters fit in scripture these stories are not just stories if we just go and just meditate and just just start putting people okay this is i'm represented as rebecca we look at her character and we see how we have to have that same type of character in this hour we can see abraham representing the father

message we were born to destroy the works of the enemy amen this brother jack was just preaching that you know earlier in the week i was thinking as brother branham said god hates a powerless church and as i thought on as i posted this in in the brothers chat i guess it was wild brother kwaku it was while brother quaker was actually preaching and we were streaming and he hit a point i don't remember exactly what he said but this thought hit me that god hates a powerless church and the scripture came to mind now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and god hates a powerless church but the church that's here now already has power and we haven't woken up yet to use it but we were here at this appointed time for a purpose and we heard that purpose this morning to destroy the works of the enemy amen let's stand to our feet and we'll just sing this chorus a little bit before we leave this morning i'll say yes lord i agree my desire is to be what you've called me to be and that's what i will be [Music] come on help me sing it again i will be what you've called me to be i'll say yes lord i agree my desire [Music] passion and lead is to be what you've called me to be and that's what i will be [Music] i'll say yes yes [Music] i agree amen if you're called this day to destroy the works of the enemy you'll say yes i'll say yes yes i agree [Music] i will be i will be what you've called me to be i'll say yes [Music] lord i agree my desire [Music] that's what i will be that's what i will be [Music] oh that's what i will be that's what i will be amen let's give the lord a handcuff of praise praise the lord you know i i'd like to apologize today um normally before church we normally get here about 30 minutes early you know we pray and do everything but today i ran in here right straight from the car straight to the pulpit that's something something that normally doesn't happen well in doing that i wasn't properly prepared you know had a very busy week and you know i have songs in my heart and we have a hour and 30 minute drive so i get things begin to move all the time and i come in and we just float but this morning it didn't happen like that you know we were actually here all day yesterday and we were up with the some of the saints from the boynton church last night pretty late photographing a party we got up and my wife had to had to do some things and just didn't get my family ready in time to come to church so we ran into the house of lord all rushed and everything so when i came in and sister rebecca was already playing so i whispered over in the ear sister i need you to just flow and that's what she did sister rebecca began the song service and i like to thank the lord for our musicians because they can get into a place where they are just anointed and they helped they helped me out so much here so as she began to play and she put me she was already in the first song we began to sing that song and then we read the scriptures she put me in another song and when she put us in that second song then finally i was able to get in the channel where i was supposed to be in order to have songs lined up to complement the ministry of the word and i'm grateful for the musicians that we say it all the time we bless the lord for our musicians but they put so much into the service and while the lord is moving sometimes they're just sitting here they don't get the opportunity to enter in like like they should but i'm so glad that they're able to rotate sister rachel she can stand back then just rejoice in the presence of the lord next week it'll be sister rebecca out there and sister hadassah i'm so glad as brother jack put things in order replication so when you pray and always pray for our musicians they do a great work and i'll miss and i just want to want to say that this morning god bless you sister rebecca sister sarah sister dancer brother nehemiah sister rachel sister cobb brother josiah god bless you we love you we need you we appreciate you all and saints i want to thank you all for the prayers that you always do whether it's a brother's prayer night sister's prayer night or whether you're just praying for one another at all time it shows it shows in everything that we do while our past was out we had brother kwaku brother jerry and brother troy doing a tremendous job they were they were appointed for those services to bring the messages as they brought them brother troy just entered in writing to brother jack's message we got to catch those little things god is moving god is moving we're a blessed people amen let's bow our hearts almighty god we can't be we can't help but be overwhelmed
