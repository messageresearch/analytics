you cannot be here tonight amen so let us really rejoice and be glad that indeed we are part of God Amen okay well I we are standing I want you to tell your Bible with me to the Book of Numbers so I have a lot of stuff okay okay number is 14 okay let me this way [Music] number is 14 I'm reading from 37 to 41. even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the Lord but Joshua the son of noon and Caleb the son of Josephine which were of the men that went to search the land live still and Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel and the people moaned greatly and they rose up early in the morning and got them up into the mountain into the top of the mountain saying Leo we'll be here and we and they will go up onto the place which the Lord has promised for we have sinned and what he said wherefore now do you transgress the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before you are enemies all right may the Lord add blessing to read of his word you can have used it [Music] did you want to put anything in them I salute each one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh I'm very glad also to set my eyes on my good friends at the we're in a church broadcasting was here in Washington DC anytime I come around I visit the church and I preach for them all right and it's wonderful to meet them here so I've been coming to Florida I've not had not even come across any Ghanaian in the world but it's good to have my brothers here with me oh he's not here tonight okay that's great it's good to have somebody here in Florida that's great so we are very grateful to be together and then those of you that has been with that for a long time at least you you can recognize the face that way I've spoken to you once and you attend the law and brother also has been to Ghana although I couldn't get opportunity to know him when he came to our country but I come to know him here and we have become friends anytime I'm coming around I give him a shout out brother but it looks like God has Wicked this season for me today amen God bless each one of them now we want to just speak on the subject the message that you said 62. and I step number zero four zero eight this program preach presuming presuming I want us to talk on that subject all right now the way presuming you are Americans we are we are African so you you you are English people so you understand what you are talking about presuming he said the dictionary said that's to venture without authority to do something that you don't have what it takes to do it right but you anyhow your persistent you you will force yourself to do it and eventually you force yourself to but it will come up it won't come out right because you don't have any technical know-how you don't have the the knowledge to come or to do it better but you are just persistent you are you are presuming or you are assuming that you can do it better all right so that is presumption and anything anything that comes with presumption there is consequences it is dangerous to presume yes you might be very certain what you are doing right if you are certain you know for sure that it will surely come out right yes because you see the end from beginning right you know what you're doing but this subject that we read in the scripture we know God has shown his kindness to Israel he wanted to prove his love to them that's why he allowed them to stay in Egypt they stayed in Egypt because God wanted to prove to them that he's a savior amen amen just to prove to them that he loves them so whatever you are going through is not that God has denied you or decided you no God sometimes permit you to go into a situation that he want to express his love amen that is why that boy that was born blind day asked Jesus a question what happened who sin in this situation say nobody right nobody don't attribute anything to any man here this is the purpose of God God wanted to show his glory god wanted to prove that he has come to open people's eyes amen so that guy he was there for a purpose amen so that is exactly how God works right you might go into a difficult situation but God is in it all glory the prophet said it is the people that left The Rock The Rock will never leave you right God will never leave his child right amen it has never recorded in a Bible so whatever we are going to remember he is watching you it is it depends on your attitude all right God is looking at your attitude towards the situation amen are you going to I tell God that regardless of whatever is happening you still love him yes that is where that is the problem comes people are sometimes disappointed when small things just fly up and then you see them just throw their hands in the air yes no it's right God has brought them from Egypt's really and they are going to the promised land and he told them that my angel will lead you yes that is Exodus 23 20. I will send an angel you are not going alone that angel that Pillar of Fire that make Moses will never leave you amen he will surely lead you and bring you to the promised land right amen so it is not you you just lost I am doing it all right it is not your business to go to the promise it is my business to put you there the prophet said it is not your business how you are going to cross the river you are businesses you must walk to the river not your business imagine how do I cross that is not your problem your problem is to obey that is God and move forward praise God to Israel they try to figure things out how could we really come into the Wilderness and suffer all these problems all disturbing we don't have food we don't have water we don't have this stuff why God was looking at their attitude God you mean God doesn't know that people supposed to drink water you mean God doesn't know that people should want to eat hold on amen but so that he leave his people in such a situation so that he can express his love he wanted people to show that that kind of appreciation that Lord we love you regardless of whether we know we have to really wait on God and when we wait on the Lord we shall see God manifesting his love so now Brethren Israel they started to Rebel they were talking things that they were not supposed to against Moses the prophet the Lord is stayed on the mountain when they go to that is a mountain cell they stayed there for quite a long time why because God wanted to prove them God wanted to work on them if they could really repent and then come to that that their right senses that the god that brought them from Egypt is the same God that will take them to the promised land Moses told them you guys are sin against God although you are carrying the ACT although the ACT is still in in the camp but I want to tell you God is annoying with you you have come to Academy God is annoying because I ask you guys to go and spread the land right you came with a bad report right none of you could really come with any good save Caleb and Joshua right amen and these people stayed in line they stayed with the promise they stay with the pillar of fire their focus was set on the promise right and these are the people that can come to the promised land but you guys God is going to waste you all off he's going to deal with you regardless of what you have really presuming that you can make it it will not work amen so stay away don't go God is not with you this is almost we are Israel we are Abraham children all right so God cannot do that God cannot be nice so please you go you go to the battle in the house say don't go God is not with you but the Bible said they presume that as long as they have a good history it is not you yesterday we are talking of you today you understand people lean on yesterday's experience amen people think of you yesterday I was a good Christian I was this I prophesied yesterday I was did I did that what about today amen we want to see God today not God yesterday all my friends God bless you you see wow that is what we want to see that these people they were just leaning always on their past experience thinking that God will stay with them but brother you must examine yourself in the situation the environment that you have come to if indeed God is with you amen God was not with them but they presume they will go in the house let us see what Peter said here that's second Peter foreign this thing he said wherefore the radar burden give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things he shall never fall make your calling an election sure right it is not something you must presume it's not something that you must be very sure right that you are calling praise God it's really in line with what your confession is you don't confess things that you don't have amen amen so you must make sure that you are election and your confession is perfect amen so Israel look at what they did they say Moses we are going in hell and brother said they made a fatal mistake trying to work with god without face bringing God on the sin wow God has really deserted Israel because they have failed him they have denied God they have sinned and really brother said they confess oh they Cry Oh Lord yes you have sinned but it depends on your approach sometimes people make confession it's not right confession is that they were crying unto the law oh Lord we have sinned but it was not a genuine repentance because they still insisted that they would do things without God God was not with them and the prophet Moses is the one they have to listen to Moses told them if you have really repented I am telling you that sir the Lord don't go amen don't go God is not with you but the Bible said they they refuse the warning they say we will go anyhow and when you read they were beaten they were seriously beaten Israel was big and it is not God's promise that his children will really be beaten by their enemies no that's right amen God never made a promise nothing can destroy a son of God and nobody can take you for your place amen if only you will believe and stay with the word of God nothing can root you yes amen so Israel you know the brother said the men of old the the the the great Fighters God has to destroy them all that is where today we have a new generation this message is the new generation that is being born out of Pentecost we are coming out of Pentecost this is the new generation that is why Pentecost the Bible said we must walk through their land that's the mobias and the edomers don't really meddle with them we are moving to our promised land that is the fact that they can go they cannot move yes that is why we are crossing over we are crossing the land and exactly this Israelite for them to stay with the word of God they refuse to stay with Moses word they presume and the Bible said they were completely destroyed by their enemies anytime someone presume without getting the actuals or would that get a a proof that God is in the picture brother you destroy every program yes that is why are we suffering today if he she presumed he told you it was okay oh a little bit of this a little bit of that there's nothing wrong with that oh it's okay it's okay let us miss it a little oh God said we we will surely that but we'll come with a fantastic that is news you should not you will not surely die it's not good news to you you anything that really makes God's word contrarily to God it is something that you have to stay away from but if thought it will give knowledge it will give understanding and to give him some that he will come to some category or some startups just like God and that when Pride set in and he said that is a good message uh and that is what the bible let us pull Paul Paul said Brethren that's the second Corinthians chapter 10. second Corinthians chapter 10 verse four it's a for for the weapon of our welfare is nocturnal but Mighty true God to the pulling down of strongholds casting their imaginations and every heightened that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when you or your obedience is fulfilled do ye look on things after the outward appearances If any man trust to himself that he is Christ let let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are we Christ for though I should boast somewhat more of our Authority which the Lord has given us for edification and not for your destruction I should not be ashamed he has the authority that is why we are talking of presuming Paul he knew what he was holding he knew that he God has given him a Ministry and that is why you come you sit here you listen to your preachers God has given you ministers to preach to show you the way of God to establish you in your position because you don't you you cannot move to your position right away when they got to the promise that it will Joshua that divided alive you cannot go and move until I I want to claim this area amen right that is the wake of this ministers here they have to position you in your Promised Land wow blah blah says sometimes when they are cutting you and fixing you right there is painful when there is a captain if they cut in his favor but we have to cut you yes if you don't cut you cannot fit into it so sometimes you see that people oh why why the pastor is against me this message is yes it's for you because it has to slim it has to cut and then get that Surplus flesh do stuff that hangings it has to be cut off because you have a place and the pastor he knows he is the mercy you know how to cut the rock praise God he knows amen and put you in your appropriate Place amen so you must really appreciate when you are being cut [Applause] the prophet said when you are doing anything remember it is you and God only you understand it is not you and anybody you and God so everything that you are doing be very certain that God is with you right amen let me read what the prophet said be certain that God with you if you amen amen that's it now he said if you any perhaps any room it can only contain only two it contains you and God only all right it is you and God it cannot accommodate anybody when you are dealing with God make sure that that room can only accommodate you and God you don't need anyone you don't need any reason you don't need any consultation the room can only accommodate two of you it is you and God so you must stay and then reason with god without reasoning with any other person Israel they try to listen among themselves that they can make it and that is why they made the Fatal mistake because the prophet in the campus want them not to do it but they say no we are going to do it anyhow we will surely Venture and you'll Venture without Authority it is very disastrous it is really death when you want to venture without Authority that's right no so we have to cast all imaginations anything that comes to you blah blah says if anything comes to your mind warningly anything that is not according to the message he said consult your pastor people want to really Venture do things without consulting their pastors their ministers the pastor God has already ordained him he has lifted him to a higher Dimension you cannot be there in a message in his presence said no nobody can be in the in the level of the pastor wow wow because he is the Watchman of the place so he's always on the tower amen that is why it is important to really stay and conserve your part ever any movement you want to make if it is business if it is Mary consult your pastor let him go to the Tower and pray for evil the Lord this your shape this your daughter want to go this way father what is it and God will really let your pastor know what is good for you but today people want to venture they want to build their own thing and when the problem said do not come to God when it is Battle come to God God when it is good time all right but after people has messed up then they bring the problem to the pastor all right you ventured without Authority all right all right you understand the prophet said listen I'm reading from uh who do you say Jesus they followed the pillar of fire to the promised land those that went all the way through did you remember Caleb and Joshua they are this perish notice they wanted the word mess with the world call them to error and notice what did uh what what it did to them they miss it because they wouldn't accept the anointed word you see you have to have the content feed if you refuse the original they got the contents the first you have to have the real one to make a Content fit or out of it and the day they had it and God showed that he wasn't with them we were present with it they had the original word Moses told them don't do it God is not with you but they really insisted that they would do it and they brought a contemplative idea which is contrary to dance here the Lord and that is what messed they come and they all perish in the wilderness they all died the prophet said Satan has thrown all kind of content feats of shaking hands and evidences and everything like that forget it the hour has arrived that the token itself not some content feed not to make believe not substance substitute anything no you don't substitute anything it might be the genuine holy ghost that is why you must not Venture be very sure to yourself that you don't come you sit on this seat because you want to be a member Brian said if you want to be a member of a church you can be a member and you remember right but when you come to church don't stay as a member move further and be a member of Christ all right you don't come here to be a member of this church all right you are here to be a member of Jesus Christ amen so if you stay you want to remain a member you will stay here and be a member and after you have been a member you remember you you you you you your membership will remain in here and the others will go in the Rapture are they because you are not part of Christ so what we have to do you don't stay and play membership here all right but go right to your position that is you see me are set in Heavenly places in Christ there you know what uh that is a Ephesians said set in Heavenly places in Christ what is the believer's position that is your position is in Christ amen that is your position in the word so when you come to church I don't stay there move further and enter into Christ yeah look at it we are talking of presuming the Bible says that is uh first Samuel first Samuel 13 verse 8 and he carries seven days that was uh Samuel according to the set of time Samuel had appointed but someone came out to gigal and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring him that event offering to me and a piece of friend and he offered the bent offering and he came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of the offering that Ben offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he must salute him and someone said what has that done and so said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and that that came out not within the days appointed and that Philips Philistines gathered themselves together at a match therefore said I the Philistine will come down now upon me in Giga and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a bent over it is this all right I force myself you see it can't be you can be me forcing yourself to do things that we are not supposed to do amen he was not supposed to make any sacrifice someone has delayed but it is not your business it is his spirit that gives I right it was someone that's supposed to offer the secret he is a he's a prophet amen you are a king that is not your business right so if someone has delayed God is taking care of the problem let the Philistines gather let problem gather let all the problems come against you and test on your problem it is God's problem yes only have faith in God Don't Run Away around and say Lord because the problem was so tense I thought this this YouTube man can help me I thought this man can help you you remember I did it one time when he fell down and he broke his uh uh he sent to consult Akron why should he do that because he thought maybe Elijah will come and then just just put fire you know Elijah was a no-nonsense man when you sin Elijah will get to rebuke you right there so he didn't want to hear any rebook so he said go to Akron then consulted the woman for me brother Saul was not supposed to do what he did but he said oh someone I forced myself why should I force yourself all right to begin why should I force yourself you know what is right but deliberately you are doing what is wrong there is nobody here that doesn't know what is wrong we know what is wrong because the whole does God in you will always let you know what is right and what is wrong so when we sin it is not somebody that you tell you that you are in wrong your heart if you have any conscience it will condemn you that it is wrong and then you put it right it is not a pastor Justin oh sister come and confess nobody will pull you here to come and do confession praise God nobody will pull you here praise God if indeed you're a child of God the Holy Ghost will rebuke him your heart will be broken down and then you put it right he said someone else told him oh soul I'm sorry for you God wanted to establish your kingdom but now it's finished that's right he's finished amen because he couldn't wait amen wait when you read the book of her that is a Sam say wait on the Lord I say wait on the Lord if you cannot wait on the Lord then it means you are going to miss that's a golden opportunities you miss it again he said I just read it that is a festival 15 . you see he has gone he he has made sacrifice and now he's going to battle and someone told him my friend when you go utterly destroy everything he say okay that's fine and someone came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be that of the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord and someone said what minute then this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowering the lowering of The Oxen which I hear and son said they were brought from they were they have brought them from the amalekitis uh for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the ozin to sacrifice unto the Lord Our God and the rest we have utterly destroyed and someone said and and someone said unto Soul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord have said to me this night and he said unto him stay on yeah what is he going to tell you your kingdom is finished it's finished that's right brother beloved we must obey the voice of God stay in God's word do not try to mix anything that is why we have this message there have been a lot of mixture all the ages they could not get this original message like this but we have come out with Grace Malachi 4 has given us the whole staff this is what Paul said when that is perfect is come now we have received Perfection this message is profession this is Christ so all the days of error is finished we are no more in error we have the true message that is correcting every arrow all right so Paul uh someone is telling a soul go and destroy everything he said okay when we went we found that this ship they were very very good for sacrifice and we thought it is not good to destroy these ones so we brought them in for sacrifice let me tell you when someone got there they were bleeding of the ship he he got he said he said why this bleeding let me tell you your sin will be bleeding you you cannot hide wow wherever you have said it will be bleeding foreign amen so somewhere told him my friend to obey is better than sacrifice to sacrifice yes why should we presume blah blah said the the sky is full of that is good things why should you take account of it listen friends he said listen friends let me tell you this will take a substitute when the Pentecostals are loaded with the written where I try to lay upon some fanaticism of a or some fantastic well try to rely upon some little emotion on some latest something another there is nothing today when Pentecostal skies are just crowded with the written don't take a substitute when you can get delayed amen you understand when we can get the wrist up the true word of God without mixture where do they take things that is contrary things that is not original why do you think those things but that is Satan's really a lie he won't be really oh just drop all those kind of stuff upon the people and if you are not vested grounded in the word of God you'll be swerved they will give you that is stuff that is not original and that is what all the ages Satan succeeded to do that but at this end time it will be difficult for him let it be difficult for Satan let it be difficult because you have Christ the original word and when he attacks you any Dimension you can use their weapons it is written it is written because we have the what it is to defeat Satan we have it blah blah said brother well take a substitute when the genuine is here why should you something different when the reaction is here at hand then when you get that mainspring working within you Christ the love of God your heart working within you then it will begin to express these kinds of uh taken love joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience Faith Mercy oh man it will just take right with those because the Holy Ghost has come to its right place it is encoding your soul it will be pushing all this kind of fruits it will come automatically you are not going to really force yourself to Bear the fruits it will come automatically so you must not take anything content for it you must take the original take the original why we should not presume I mean Moses look at Moses Moses a prophesied Moses the only thing he could do was to kill one Egyptian he presumed Moses thought he could do it by himself you remember he thought he could do it by himself and when he went to the camp let us see what happened he saw Egyptian and then an Israelite any problem and she said no no I would not allow this to happen in my presence in The Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 and he came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out into his burden and look on their burdens and he is pride and Egyptian smiting and Hebrew one of his burden and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and hit him in the Sun Moses he knew that he was anointed for a job brother you must know you don't sit here without knowing you are calling every one of us you should know where God called you for you must know what why you are in this church where are you brother why are you in this church you are in this church for a purpose there is a reason God put you here and you must really exercise everything that it takes for you to be a good that is Christian here you must really adopt it you must do it here because that's the reason God placed you here amen now Moses knew his anointing so when he went to the camp he said no I will not allow an Egyptian to to to destroy an Israelite and the Bible said he killed the Egyptian hit him with the son and his own Brethren betray him his own breading this message you see the betray us it is not somebody coming from outside it is within people in this message they are betraying this message they are really putting all those stuff against the prophet so the same They Carried a a wrong message that is Pharaoh that that your boy has killed an Egyptian but let me tell you sometimes you'll be in your comfort zone God will let something happen to you so that you run to God all right Moses was just in the palace God was wanting him God was wanting him but message okay well I will let you be declared wanted so when they kill an Egyptian he became a wanted man all right so he has to run away right so sometimes God will put something on you and then you become a problem and you will run to God you write to God so one Moses in the process of running for his life because they were looking for him then God was loving after this guy now I've gotten you you were staying your comfort zone now you kill Egyptian now you are running to me and in the wilderness the prophet said there was something that Moses lack he lacked The Authority he wanted to venture without so it was presumption Moses presumed that he could do it by himself that was his his mind but he got to know that it was not his within his capacity to do it and what did he lack he like The Authority he lacked the power to do it and brother said that power was in the burning bush that's where the Burning Bush was pulling him what Moses like was in the burning bush amen that is exactly what you like what I like brother what we like is in the upper room if you don't have any power to operate there is a stance you must climb go to the upper room the Holy Ghost is waiting is available the powerful print is available that is where Peter gives Peter Peter is the the part of that manner empty Peter said it's never empty it is available this part this manner is for you and for your children children and as many as the Lord shall call so brother it is not empty go inside and receive your portion every priest you remember in the Old Testament Every Praise that come to the priesthood they have to carry a handful of that original Manner and give to him so that he will eat and understand what the original manner was that is what we have to do you will ask something the reason you like you cannot overcome is because you don't have the power to do it and that power is invested in God going to the upper room go on your knees pray and let God give you the power and when you receive the power you will be a true Witness hey you understand so Moses the prophet said by faith Faith by experience and one day when this old man was back there on the backside of they just said heading his father-in-law ship Jethro he saw a bush on fire and he went up in the presence of this bush now he was 8 80 years old and he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that bush that he learned in 80 years in the school of Egypt you see sure what Moses lack the burning bush had it and what the seminaries like tonight the Holy Ghost has got it amen the same fire of God what the schools need is fire Holy Ghost Fire in the presence of the fire he had an experience he was running from Egypt before now he was going back to Egypt that problem you were running from that sickness that you thought you were running from it you will come and pacify that God has given you power to conquer that sickness Moses he was running from the person he was running from the princess of pharaoh but when he made the pillar of fire what he lack was vested in him sometimes dramatized he said look at Moses he was just on a meal or maybe a donkey with a baby with the wife and then with just a a a a a Shepherd staff yes just as stakeholding and say Moses where are you going to say I'm going to conquer I'm going to conquer Egypt with what are your soldiers I don't need it so yeah why you have your machine I don't need any machine what do you have I have a steak amen half a stick brother when you meet God that is why it is important to go away the lacking is what is causing the problem you lack but go in the presence of God and when you are filled with the Holy Ghost when Peter came out from Empire brother he was not presuming he was not just a put on he has really met with God and the pillar of fire he has got a portion in his heart Christ in him there was no fear there was no doubt he knew that what God told him to do he would do it not by him but God will do it so when you when you meet the Holy Ghost sister and the Holy Ghost is right in your soul you are a dilemma Force there is nothing that you fear because you know God will surely operate even in difficult times he will prove that he is with you so that is where you cannot really Venture without the actress or without the authority you know that you know what you are doing when they came to the the gate beautiful it was not a trial Peter was not making a trial don't make a try be very very certain what you are doing that it will really go in Conformity with what you are holding the Holy Ghost in you will operate perfectly to bring the beauty of God and Peter he said my friend we don't have money to give oh I thought I'm going to get some view guys say no no we don't have that but I am coming from upper room I am coming from the bedroom and I am not by myself Peter is dead I'm dead in the upper room it is Jesus that is alive so in the name of Jesus Christ rise up brother from Apple room you are a dead man and that descend from epic we were dead amen that is why Peter was not afraid of death when they said okay it's okay you can hug me put my head down no problem go and kill me right tell me right brother they were Fearless because a Son of God a child of God you are already dead the life you live now is not you it's Christ that is the life that is where we have to come to and when you come to that place you will be Fearless you don't care whatever happened to you because you know who you believe presuming you don't presume anything be very honest be very sincere what you did and when Moses got that Pillar of Fire he was different Moses when he went to Pharaoh he was a different the same muscles that they were they were looking to arrest when he went to Pharaoh Pharaoh could not see that Moses again it was a different Moses Hallelujah it was a different Moses praise God that was like Jacob Jacob when Jacob met Esau he just he was a different Jacob he was Israel yes and so thought he was meeting Jacob but he met Israel so beloved when you meet with God something change things change there was one time to kill Hosea he also wanted to make that he take the prince office he has been blessed when God blesses you it doesn't make any room for you to come and preach because you have money this message I am very honest to you this even Ghana many places people has got money to support the ministry or have money I can build my church and there may be too many streamers they build a big church he has the money and then he jumps into the puppet preaching rabban said if a business might remain a businessman stay in your business and support the work of God because that's why he said why is it why why why why is it that it's always Shepherd God always take igorithm people he always the people that you don't put you don't place any value on them that's the people God use God doesn't use people that are really that is in the community people that has got big name blah blah said if you have a name God cannot use you God wants to use people that have no name all right only Jesus has a name so if you want to have a name brother step out you God cannot use you praise God he was blessed listen in the book of second chronicles 20 says he said but when he was strong his heart was second chronicles 26 16 but when he was strong his heart his heart was filled up with his destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and Azaria the priest went in after him and with him first called Praise of the Lord and that day that were valid Valiant men and they withstood ozia the king and said unto him it opportunity not unto thee ozia to bring incest unto the Lord but to the priest the sons of Aaron that are concentrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for that has trespass neither shall it be for that honor from the Lord God then uzia was rough he was rough and had a sensor in his hand to Bear insects and while he was rough with the priest the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the prince in the house of the Lord from besides the incense Altar and Azaria the chief priest and all the priests look upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they trust him out of dance yet he himself hasted and also hasted also to go out because the Lord has smitten him amen that's right he was a king he was prosperous he has many inventions when you look at his story he was prosperous but he just don't pretend for it but he presumed as long as God has bless me I can also be a place as long as God has blessed me I can also preach it is I can also preach like a brother told me in Washington we can also know I said nobody is saying you can't preach go and preach what something that you can jump in and do it it is a Ministry it is God's Ministry this ministry is the ministry of God himself that is why brother William Brothers if you're not careful and then people are speaking dangerous things that they don't know brother Ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ all right now so if you're speaking against this you might be very careful very very careful otherwise it will not be forgiving you in this world and in the world to come and pardonable sin don't speak again this message if you don't agree you stay here there's nothing wrong with that but to speak against the message brother is dangerous I can preach I can preach people let me warn you and I say I've got a lot of money keep it to yourself if you don't want to support the ministry keep it but to jump into the minister I can preach I can pray brother that you see what happens here I can also preach I can also preach I can also burn he says he went and in the process he became leprous Jesus you know the story any leprosy cannot stay in Israel he he run away to the to be on the camp you have to run away because God has touched him you understand amen presume we know the story of Samson go SS anointed him God anoint you when the anointing leaves you brother you must go for that feeling don't think you are the same man people think they are always the same but you must know where you are you must look back make inventory and know if you are still the same man the same woman if anything is wrong if you fix it if you don't face it and you presume that you are oh like Israel you remember when God went to the king of Adam and the king of Judah and he fetched the three kings let us go and walk again that is the serials because the lamb belongs to us problem said they took a compass and they looked seven days you know what they were doing they were looking seven days oh we are Israel we are chosen Nation we conquered these people we conquered just people we conquered that Nation we conquered this one so we are still Israel brother but God was not with them they have come to a Wilderness they have come to a desert that God was not with them but they they presumed yes it's just presumption they presume that is the level Something did Samson God has made a covenant with you there is a comment between us and God and that confidence is the only the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the Covenant said God making Covenant with his people what did God do he cheered Jesus apart and he gave us the best of the land what's the best of the land the Holy Ghost go to the body and give him the best you understand so he gave it the Holy Ghost he took the body of Christ and he gave it the best of the land the Holy Ghost so you must be very careful anytime the Holy Ghost take his flight you must look for him call him back before you venture don't try to do anything without him that's right in a message he's that's a a deceived Church by the world that is right to do he thought he was the same Samson when the Holy Ghost he's very timid he's very very scary he's afraid he doesn't he doesn't want to see any kind of a error when you do anything that is wrong he runs away but he has never deserted you he has never gone away brother said you'll be sitting on a tree something or a storm looking at your attitude if you call him back he cannot leave you forever because he is your comfort your comforter cannot leave him you understand so you'll be staying there right there watching your attitude yeah watching you and when you come to the altar oh Lord I am sorry I did it how I spoke to my pastor how I spoke to my wife how I spoke to him oh no it wasn't right it wasn't right to do it Lord forgive me I'll go and make it right I'll go and face oh brother I'm very sorry I was not supposed to speak address you it was the wrong thing I actually addressed you in that manner that was wrong brother can you forgive oh sister I forgive you you see the sickness of the Holy Ghost coming back to you again because you put it right you understand then go and Venture one time I think you remember when he was he wanted to pray for that that that sick person and when he he's tried to lay he said God said you are not fit to do it benefited it not why he said you were condemning somebody you were condemning somebody you're not free to do it you understand then blah blah has to go and fix it put it right praise God he has to go and visit put it right you understand yes he went to the attachment fix it right Amen on the telephone wrong I was right in the home but it was too much on me the questions too much so I just walk out and I told my wife tell them I'm not around you understand yes if it were you it was it is a white light there's nothing wrong with that eating is okay but to the prophet very sensitive he God said you are not fit to pray for that baby you are not Faith amen and then he confessed to him sorry I did it oh my wife said we were just going out yes I told her to tell you that I'm wrong so forgive me that's right you look at my mom I've respected you oh despite I respect you them all that's right brother better sometimes when you are confessing you think that it will degrade you you think that it will bring him to you but it will bring glory to you amen yeah Hallelujah to glorify God anything that glorified God it brings glory to you as well so if you confess yourself God is glorified but what is sad because we try to really cover our sins we presume nobody saw this we presume it's okay we presume it's okay sister it is not okay if your heart doesn't condemn you then there's something wrong with you let God come in and condemn us every moment every time we make error and when we are condemned we will fix it and put it right you see so Samson here he is the anointing is on this man look at a Jawbone he held it when and the the Bible said he looked for when the feeling sent by a thousand of them came upon him he looked for a tool he looked no two he grabbed a job bone he said well it's enough brother blah blah whatever is in your hand is enough if it's a special whistle it's enough if it's clapping it's enough whatever you have use it to the glory of God it is enough you don't need an organ you don't need if it is traffic club and everybody will know that God is you are worshiping God you understand amen it is not how many Organo how many drums you have but if the worship is coming from your heart we will know that we are worshiping God worship people what we have so when you got the the wow and when it got anointed man's hand blah blah said it depends upon the person with the bow it depends upon the person with the sword when the sword gets into an audition you will see how it will drive you see how it works you will need the Holy Ghost to push the word of God when the Holy Ghost is fixed right and then you are operating in that confound brother I want to tell you there is nothing that can stand against you but something one day he stood up something there on you again he shook himself I am Samson I'm going to do it again the loss were not there oh you have destroyed the Covenant the coming between you and God is completely out you are a naked man you are just something there is nothing with you again you understand but he presumes I will stand up again as something brother let us not presume let us be very honest to ourselves where there is really lacking you must get back to God and face it let God fill you with the power before you venture otherwise you'll be completely defeated and then you'll be very you'll be put to shame Satan is right there and then you'll be a defense laughing at you look at him you think you can make it you are empty many of us you are empty but we feel be within that we have failed you cannot go for refilling when you are driving your car whenever you drive your car when anytime you see the the yellow sun also so no my fuel is going down you go for a refueling it is also reverse sometimes you see that the the yellow sun is telling you that you are you are going down go back and refer Holy Ghost and then when the Holy Ghost is thrilled right there then you know that it is not a put on you are not just making a trial you know what you are doing something he presumed and they did not help him brother let us not presume let us have the address let us have the the what it is for us to make it we'll be closing very soon look at the healthy one time the health also presume why should our Master leave this man to go with all this stuff Naaman has come we have healed him you Prophet you have healed this man he has got a lot of money the man had brought a lot of money and you say you should go with the money that you go and be a rich man overnight so he chased neyman lemon stay right there oh who is that I am crazy the the the servant of the Prophet oh come do you have any word for me yes he said the prophet said this message is this happening Prophet said Prophet said Prophet said you understand using the word of the Prophet to make Grace to make money the prophet said yes yes many people behind the puppy Professor making money yes listen we are reading this before we close second Kings chapter 5 verse 19 and he said unto him go in peace that is Elisha just dispatching uh neyman go I've finished my work I don't need anything from God so he departed from him a little way but the head Z the seven Elisha the man of God said behold my master has spared name and this Syrian in not receiving at his son that which he brought but as the Lord leave it I will run after him and take somewhat of him so guys he followed after neyman and when Neymar saw him running after him he lighted down from the child to meet him and he said is everything well and he said all is well my master have sent me oh is it not is it not ridiculous he's not shameful sent me Seoul heavy come to me from Mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the Prophet give them a pretty a talent of silver and two charges of changes of garment and Neymar said be content take two talents and he urged him and the bound to a talent of silver in two bucks and two changes of garment and lay them upon two of a seven and they bear them before him you understand presumption I will make money from this ministry why should I follow Elijah and then there's just a bountiful and she said your Bounty just these goodies has come right in my face look at money I followed this man of God for several years look at money and you allow this man to go with that that no no that is wrong right that's wrong he chased him and then he said the prophet said Prophet never said anything that's right that's what people are doing today professor professor sometimes they are quoting wrong they are cutting wrong the prophet never said anything the prophet said just to make money Prophet said he said why if if Prophet there is everything for you I gave everything to you he said no no then he wrote that even the Lord was too much that he has he could not carry he has to help him to carry the stuff he became a rich man overnight presumption yes they really stay and just have faith in God God knows your level any stage that you get to God know what he has to give to you that you'll be able to cope with some people can be rich and then they will run away from God that's exactly right some people can get money and then they will never think about God again some people can get a good job and that job will take them from God that's right brother so mostly God knows what is good for you you are his child he's giving you maybe Millions will really make your soul perish he'll give you hundreds all right all right so that he can maintain your soul otherwise he is going to lose you blah blah blah said there was a minister he tried to cheer his old nose I will not preach again he started drinking because ah [Music] he's not going to hell but he was trying to bring reproach to the name of God that's right so God took him so God cannot lose a child so brother let us not really think that we can really make it in our own way stay in line with God don't presume anything don't think you are smart just stay with God God knows what is best for us and let us obey the voice of God and let us humble ourselves and let us respect this ministry this message that we have really got is really it it is the best that we can talk about because this is our destiny amen this is what is to put us in the kingdom of God and right as you sit there with the message in your heart you are already set in Heavenly places let us not presume anything may God help us to walk with God regardless of whatever circumstances whatever the problem might be stay with God God is looking or he knows everything he knows all our problems he know everything that we are going through don't think God is not looking on but what God is required from you is your faith in his promise just have faith in him and tell God lord I wait for the appointed time whatever it is I am waiting on you and I believe you come on the scene let nothing just kick you out Satan is the kicker you want to kick you from your territory but stay and be very persistent because God will really take the glory let us really give glory to him let us not bring shame to this message let us not allow people to laugh at God because by by so doing our attitude our Behavior will make people to really reproachfree speak against this message let it not be you like you remember what David said I know Nathan told David he said David by so doing this thing that you have done it has given room for evil people to speak against the Lord this thing that you did you did it but you have repented anyway God has but it is has become a scar it has become that is a a a a a band on the name of God that this thing that it has given room for any Miss to speak against God may God help us let us not presume sisters Brethren whatever we are doing let us get the authority let us consult God speak to your pastor that's the course are there in the Revelation Revelation chapter as in chapter four part two problem said anything that comes to you consult your pastor Don't Do Anything by yourself and when it escalates it gets off hand then you will come with tears oh Pastor I was trying to do this and no don't do that all right come to him let him give you advice because he is the man that can really encourage you to the problem unless you don't have confidence in your pastor if you have confidence in him know that he is the anointed to lead you to the promised life may God have mercy on us we are going to close now I want to encourage somebody here we are going to just make sure that we have godliness the Holy Ghost is not something that is just a put one on your flesh it is something you have had to do to get inside your soul so if you come to church to warm yourself and then the next day you are in problem you I think that that was what I was talking about yesterday you see like the people at the actor called they always come to warm themselves in the church but after warming and you see when problem comes oh my next Sunday they come hallelujah praise God you're gonna mind the problem oh why me oh listen Hallelujah brother the Holy Ghost has not settled at the right place let the Holy Ghost settle in your soul Monday there will be Joy Tuesday there will be Joy Wednesday they'll be dry because you don't care whatever opposition that rises you are certainly sure that the Holy Ghost in you is an overcomer that is what we need let us not really come and be Perpetual or a frequency that come you warm yourself next day you are off you go no don't do that let the Holy Ghost get a place to live and then it will settle in your soul and you'll be Overcomer every day people will really admire your faith people will come to you and then you can is zero people will come to you and then you can advise them because anybody that's a filled with the Holy Ghost go around that person he has got what it takes to give you the green light he can advise you he is filled with the Holy Ghost so anyone that you see that the Holy Ghost is really vested in him said when you meet that person he has got the solution advisable we are going to talk to God I want to ask you what what what what have you been doing all this time that it has not clicked or it seems not receive you are not being Overcomer why the reason is this you are making that Venture without Authority don't presume again let us go to where we can get what we lack after music got what is like after Peter got what he left Peter that denied God he got what is he lack at the upper room he came and he was a different person now we are going to pray what do you like tonight why have you been failing why have you not been being successful why is it that there's problem in home why is it that problem in marriage why is there a problem that's a husband and wife why why why all this problem why why is it that children you are disobedient to parents why the problem is that you need God you must go back to God say Lord I cannot really make it I need what it is to be an obedient child and need what it takes to respect my parents I knew what it takes to respect my husband any what it takes to love my wife we need it it is the holy God that will help you when my brother said when you go to any place when you see kicking kicking kicking around it means there is a problem the the problem is that the Holy Ghost is not there wherever the Holy Ghost is there is peace there is Joy there is forgiveness there is love you understand you love your brother you love your husband you love your wife you love your daddy you love your children you learn how to forgive and then forget but most of the problem because we don't we don't have the Holy Ghost let us not deceive ourselves anyone with Holy Ghost will always forgive right every body with Holy Ghost will always forgive when you see any person holding holding tight no no no no I cannot leave this I can't I can't forgive him okay brother if you cannot forgive him forget about heaven all right forget about heavy you you can never be a candidate if you cannot forgive you can never be a candidate let God help us that is why we have found a lot of problems even in this in the church the message people fighting people doing things that you're not supposed to do the reason is the Holy Ghost is not operating in their hearts we are going to pray that God should help you tonight let us talk to Jesus the Lord we are not going to make this Venture without having there power what it is for us to come Victorious we have made some error we have made some mistakes if we have really registered a lot of failures the reason is that we
