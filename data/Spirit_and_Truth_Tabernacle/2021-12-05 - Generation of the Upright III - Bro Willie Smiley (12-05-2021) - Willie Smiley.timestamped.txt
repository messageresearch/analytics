[44:39] range but uh i remember
[44:42] um
[44:44] she'd um
[44:45] come to my desk one day while i was in

[1:09:55] because we know that you're a provider
[1:09:57] and we just keep before you the promises
[1:10:00] that you've made us lord in jesus
[1:10:02] christ's name amen amen you may be
[1:10:04] seated
[1:10:06] we um
[1:10:07] we this morning we want to preach on the
[1:10:09] generation of the upright part three
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:13] um
[1:10:14] there's some other things that uh we we
[1:10:17] i guess we have
[1:10:19] on our heart to preach but i just felt
[1:10:22] led to just continue on with uh what
[1:10:26] we've been uh ministering on because for
[1:10:29] me i think it's uh
[1:10:31] it's been a blessing to me and trusting
[1:10:34] that it's been a blessing to to all of
[1:10:37] us um
[1:10:38] because you know um
[1:10:41] it's it's righteousness versus
[1:10:44] unrighteousness
[1:10:45] you know there's there's always uh what
[1:10:48] people don't understand is always a law
[1:10:50] contrast
[1:10:53] in every age there's been a law of
[1:10:55] contrast
[1:10:57] when when jesus was on the scene
[1:10:59] uh there was a law of contrast down
[1:11:02] through the history of the scriptures
[1:11:04] from from the sea chapter of the bible
[1:11:06] there's been a a long contrast and uh
[1:11:10] man we we and i'm not sure how far i'm
[1:11:14] gonna get but um
[1:11:16] i'm just gonna go until my time is up
[1:11:18] but there's a lot of things that we we
[1:11:20] want to just kind of kind of deal with
[1:11:22] because you know we we've we had a
[1:11:25] prophet on the scene
[1:11:27] and i think we're still up under the son
[1:11:30] of man ministry under this eagle
[1:11:32] anointing and there's a lot of things
[1:11:35] that's been preached
[1:11:38] and and i just like brother brother
[1:11:40] jack's um last couple of messages
[1:11:43] just trying to
[1:11:45] um get us to a place that
[1:11:48] uh if we don't understand we're gonna
[1:11:50] understand glory
[1:11:53] right i remember the first time i ever
[1:11:55] heard that quote
[1:11:57] uh i heard that back in the thunder in a
[1:11:59] thunder meet with brother coleman
[1:12:01] brother coleman read that quote and i
[1:12:03] was a real young convert and and i i
[1:12:06] just i just couldn't really fully grasp
[1:12:09] it but but as i i started ministering
[1:12:13] over the years you know i would always
[1:12:16] say that you're go
[1:12:18] you're gonna understand it
[1:12:20] but watch this if you're predestinated
[1:12:22] all right
[1:12:23] because everybody's not going to
[1:12:25] understand it
[1:12:26] everybody's not ordained to understand
[1:12:29] it
[1:12:30] is that right but the predestinator
[1:12:33] those that were in the mind of god
[1:12:34] before the foundation of the world amen
[1:12:37] uh they're gonna understand it amen
[1:12:41] is that right right because they were
[1:12:44] they were a part of god they come from
[1:12:46] god and they're gonna go back to god
[1:12:47] right right
[1:12:49] amen so so you know whether we we want
[1:12:52] certain people to get it especially in
[1:12:54] ministry you'd be wanting folks to get
[1:12:57] it right
[1:12:58] and sometimes folks just don't get it
[1:13:02] right that's right right that's right
[1:13:04] but the elect is going to get it amen
[1:13:07] that right
[1:13:08] because it's it's here for us uh in in
[1:13:12] our first couple of segments we we was
[1:13:14] trying to help us to you know
[1:13:17] identify ourselves see see where we
[1:13:20] where we where we are
[1:13:23] sometimes we don't realize
[1:13:25] certain uh uh ideologies and things
[1:13:28] carry spirits
[1:13:30] amen right things things carry spirits
[1:13:34] and in the wrong kind of spirits
[1:13:38] that right
[1:13:39] i want to be up under the right umbrella
[1:13:43] the the right thing
[1:13:45] is that right
[1:13:46] amen i don't know about you
[1:13:49] right regardless of what the wall is
[1:13:51] doing see one of the things i realized i
[1:13:54] come out of the world
[1:13:56] right right amen i come out of the world
[1:13:59] and and bro god brought me into
[1:14:02] something that i believe is pure
[1:14:07] right i believe the the
[1:14:09] the opening of the word the revealing of
[1:14:12] christ is pure
[1:14:14] the understanding that's been revealed
[1:14:17] is pure all right now now man has
[1:14:20] tainted it but it's things that i hold
[1:14:23] on to the brother man he he said man he
[1:14:26] he was going on for
[1:14:27] for some time and and and the thing
[1:14:30] never denominated one thing i realized
[1:14:33] you cannot denominate the word
[1:14:38] brother jack been talking about this the
[1:14:40] word cannot and will not be denominated
[1:14:46] amen people may try to
[1:14:50] but there's a people that's ordained of
[1:14:52] god for this hour not to be denominated
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:14:58] see
[1:14:59] not to come under a denominational
[1:15:02] spirit not to have a denominational
[1:15:05] attitude we even have to be careful
[1:15:09] because of what we have that we don't
[1:15:11] have this this attitude
[1:15:15] glory because we do we walk around with
[1:15:17] it with an attitude like we feel like
[1:15:20] we it's not that
[1:15:23] right we just thank god that we're
[1:15:25] chosen
[1:15:27] right we're chosen by god
[1:15:30] to live in this hour
[1:15:33] and and be the light of the age
[1:15:36] well i don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:15:38] let me put my glasses back on so i can
[1:15:40] read the bible a little bit
[1:15:42] because i i tell you what i feel good
[1:15:45] this morning
[1:15:46] with all this anointing up in here

[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:55] glory
[1:15:57] oh my but but but let us just kind of uh
[1:16:00] get a handle on some things this morning
[1:16:04] um
[1:16:05] here here we we kind of left off right
[1:16:08] here and and this one we want to start
[1:16:10] out in in psalms uh 111
[1:16:13] and uh
[1:16:15] because he he talked about we were
[1:16:17] talking about the works of of of god and
[1:16:20] all of the things that he'd done
[1:16:22] but but he says in the ninth verse he
[1:16:24] said he sent redemption unto his people
[1:16:27] thank god for that right amen right
[1:16:30] thank god for redemption because if it
[1:16:32] wasn't for that we'd still be
[1:16:35] like john on the out of patmos crying
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:39] right if nobody stepped step forward
[1:16:43] we we we'd be in a mess is that right
[1:16:47] when the angel called john
[1:16:50] john looked and he didn't see anybody
[1:16:52] worthy the bible said he wept
[1:16:54] yeah that didn't last long thank you
[1:16:56] jesus for that
[1:16:58] a lamb came forward aren't you glad
[1:17:00] about it
[1:17:02] boy that didn't feel good i'm gonna say
[1:17:05] that again aren't you glad about it
[1:17:08] i'm gonna say that again aren't you glad
[1:17:10] about it
[1:17:12] i don't know about you i'm tickled to
[1:17:14] death to be redeemed
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:17] i have i have no desire
[1:17:20] amen to to want to live in the world and
[1:17:23] do the things that i did before christ
[1:17:27] i i thought in the beginning those
[1:17:29] things were
[1:17:30] were fun and entertaining but i realized
[1:17:34] you know what that's just like the enemy
[1:17:38] right things start out subtle
[1:17:41] you know you might still little weed
[1:17:43] here and a little sip here next time you
[1:17:46] know you find yourself out there
[1:17:48] prostituting and everything else
[1:17:51] oh glory to his wonderful name so i'm
[1:17:54] glad for redemption this morning
[1:17:57] he sent redemption unto his people
[1:18:00] he has commanded his covenant forever
[1:18:03] holy and reverend is his name now now
[1:18:05] this is part we we really want to start
[1:18:08] out uh it says the fear of the lord
[1:18:12] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:18:15] a good understanding have
[1:18:18] uh have all they that do his
[1:18:20] commandments his praises and do endures
[1:18:25] uh forever
[1:18:28] now
[1:18:30] you can't advance
[1:18:32] forward
[1:18:34] without a starting point
[1:18:37] right
[1:18:38] you cannot advance forward without a
[1:18:42] starting point and our starting point
[1:18:46] is is reverence
[1:18:48] all right to almighty god
[1:18:50] that's that's the it's because it's the
[1:18:53] beginning it's the starting point
[1:18:55] you can forget going on to adoption and
[1:18:58] all these other things if you do not
[1:19:01] respect
[1:19:03] god and god is his word
[1:19:09] see we we try to we try to divide things
[1:19:13] is that right he and his word is the
[1:19:16] same
[1:19:17] right see he and his word is the same
[1:19:20] you can't love him without loving his
[1:19:22] word
[1:19:23] you cannot separate him from his word
[1:19:27] right right
[1:19:28] amen
[1:19:29] so he says the it's the reverence of the
[1:19:33] law is the beginning that's the starting
[1:19:35] point that's that might be the reason
[1:19:37] why people don't go that far and go
[1:19:41] right because a lot of times we try to
[1:19:44] attribute it to a man
[1:19:47] all right
[1:19:48] man is only god's agent
[1:19:52] right
[1:19:53] he's just the instrument that god chose
[1:19:57] amen to to use as a channel to express a
[1:20:03] uh what was in his mind
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:07] that right he could have chose
[1:20:09] to win he could have chosen duncan
[1:20:11] duncan spoke one time
[1:20:13] is that right
[1:20:14] a ducky did speak so god could have
[1:20:17] chose that but he chose man to identify
[1:20:21] with man
[1:20:23] is that right
[1:20:25] glory to god but but we we gotta have
[1:20:28] reverence amen man i'm gonna tell you
[1:20:30] something we're living in a gener
[1:20:32] amongst a generation
[1:20:35] because i'm a part of the generation
[1:20:37] upright but we're living a part i'm a
[1:20:39] generation that has no reverence
[1:20:42] that that has no respect they have their
[1:20:45] own ideas and their own way
[1:20:47] of thinking about things and and i'm i'm
[1:20:50] real
[1:20:52] i'm old school but but old school is new
[1:20:56] school because the scripture says he
[1:20:58] required that which is past
[1:21:01] and and i realized that you know
[1:21:03] uh uh uh the true starting point is to
[1:21:06] go back to the bible back to the
[1:21:09] beginning and see what god started the
[1:21:12] thing out with yeah
[1:21:14] see because we we we got so many i i
[1:21:18] maybe i'll get to it this morning
[1:21:21] because we we have so many so many
[1:21:24] things and so so many uh uh uh outlets
[1:21:30] that that people are using but people
[1:21:32] are causing a lot of damage doing a lot
[1:21:35] of damage
[1:21:37] right and and in every setting you got
[1:21:40] to be
[1:21:40] careful uh
[1:21:42] uh with what you hear
[1:21:46] because people spew out their their
[1:21:49] their their ideologies and their
[1:21:51] opinions and things of that nature that
[1:21:53] amen i find a lot of times that's
[1:21:56] contrary to the word of god
[1:22:00] come on come on it's the truth anyhow
[1:22:03] and you know i know uh i said blogs last
[1:22:06] time but y'all know what i'm talking
[1:22:08] about podcast right i mean
[1:22:10] right amen
[1:22:12] uh uh we we're using these things but
[1:22:15] we're using these things out of context
[1:22:18] all right
[1:22:19] out out of out of order i hope i can get
[1:22:22] to where i want to go this morning
[1:22:25] because because one one thing you know
[1:22:27] in studying i realized everything falls
[1:22:30] up under a man an umbrella
[1:22:34] and an order and things that we cannot
[1:22:37] get away from we can't bypass we can't
[1:22:40] go around right
[1:22:42] is that right
[1:22:43] but this is the thing that we find
[1:22:46] but this is why we got chaos
[1:22:49] if could you imagine god's heavenly host
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:53] getting out of order
[1:22:55] all right
[1:22:57] it'll be it'll be oh chaos yeah yeah
[1:23:00] that's right right it'll be chaos that's
[1:23:02] right if the moon decided he didn't want
[1:23:04] to do his job if the sun decided he
[1:23:06] wouldn't want to if the stars start you
[1:23:09] know falling and we got chaos it's mass
[1:23:12] chaos
[1:23:14] and see this is what we have today we
[1:23:16] have mass chaos because every everything
[1:23:19] and everybody's moving out of amen it's
[1:23:22] intended position
[1:23:25] right worry the from that from the men
[1:23:29] to the women to the children everybody's
[1:23:32] out of position and this is why we got
[1:23:35] amen gross darkness
[1:23:38] but thank god this is why we
[1:23:41] ought to thank god that we had
[1:23:44] the voice of god to summon thank angel
[1:23:47] to come
[1:23:48] and to line up things amen
[1:23:51] uh
[1:23:52] based upon the word
[1:23:55] the thoughts in the mind of god not his
[1:23:57] opinions not his feelings i'm so tired
[1:24:00] of people's opinion opinion
[1:24:02] and feelings and and all of that you
[1:24:04] know i'm a pretty easygoing guy for the
[1:24:07] most part i i shirt things off some a
[1:24:09] lot of times but i'd be like man you're
[1:24:12] not pulling that over on me right that's
[1:24:14] that's not
[1:24:18] you know
[1:24:19] that's that's foolishness we we want to
[1:24:22] be in in in the will and word of god
[1:24:26] right we want to understand what god's
[1:24:28] for
[1:24:29] perspective
[1:24:30] is
[1:24:31] in all things
[1:24:33] uh let us let us maybe read the
[1:24:35] scripture or so and uh we'll we'll try
[1:24:38] to pick up some more speed
[1:24:41] right like i say uh
[1:24:43] i'm not uh brother jews you should say
[1:24:45] he was a helicopter but i'm not a
[1:24:47] helicopter
[1:24:50] psalms 119 verse one
[1:24:52] it says blessed are the undefiled
[1:24:56] in the way who walketh in the law of the
[1:24:59] lord
[1:25:01] blessed are they that keep his
[1:25:03] testimonies right
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:06] these things mean something to god
[1:25:09] and that seek him with their whole heart
[1:25:14] glory to god
[1:25:15] see
[1:25:16] the problem that a lot of folk have
[1:25:19] is that we we we
[1:25:21] we want the world and we want we want
[1:25:24] we we just want a little bit of church
[1:25:26] to make us feel good all right
[1:25:29] we don't want anybody calling us up on
[1:25:31] the phone and
[1:25:33] i just wonder
[1:25:36] when a person gets the baptism on the
[1:25:38] holy ghost they can't hardly work to the
[1:25:40] church door's open
[1:25:42] it's just something about going to
[1:25:44] church man it's like boy i can't hardly

[1:25:48] i don't know how people lay in the bed
[1:25:49] on a sunday morning i can't do it my god
[1:25:52] my eyes has been so trained to pop open
[1:25:54] at a certain time
[1:25:57] and if i try to lay down would be
[1:25:58] miserable i just got to get up put on my
[1:26:00] clothing and hit the road yeah
[1:26:02] is that right
[1:26:04] sometimes folk just have all kind of
[1:26:07] excuses why they not going all right

[1:26:58] and leaves
[1:27:00] a lot
[1:27:03] couldn't make it
[1:27:05] huh
[1:27:06] once they kick in i feel like i'm 20
[1:27:09] years old but when they start wearing
[1:27:11] off
[1:27:12] oh love but we do that all week long and
[1:27:14] sunday morning all right
[1:27:16] i know sometimes when you're sick and
[1:27:18] can't make it you just can't make it i
[1:27:20] ain't saying that yeah but let's not
[1:27:22] give god okay let me let me keep moving
[1:27:24] uh
[1:27:25] he said uh uh third verse you say uh
[1:27:28] they also do iniquity they walk in this
[1:27:30] way he says uh thou has commanded us to
[1:27:34] keep
[1:27:35] thy precepts
[1:27:37] diligently
[1:27:39] that's commandment by god it's it's not
[1:27:42] something that we we throw to the side
[1:27:45] right
[1:27:46] amen he said oh that my ways were
[1:27:49] directed to keep his statues what a
[1:27:52] powerful statement
[1:27:54] come on
[1:27:55] because a lot of times people wait see
[1:27:58] we we got to realize uh the generation
[1:28:01] that we're living in
[1:28:03] uh did and i think me and brother troy
[1:28:05] was talking about this in this hour that
[1:28:07] we're living in here's the bad part we
[1:28:09] have had a mouthpiece we have had a
[1:28:13] prophet but people are doing what's
[1:28:16] pleasing in their own sight though
[1:28:19] right
[1:28:20] right like we've not had a prophet
[1:28:25] watch watch the spirit that's moving
[1:28:28] amongst the church
[1:28:30] because when i got saved back in 88 you
[1:28:32] know uh uh
[1:28:35] i was i'm a little bit older than
[1:28:36] brother jack and brother troy and uh
[1:28:40] we we
[1:28:42] we had a reverence and a respect to our
[1:28:46] pastor
[1:28:48] they
[1:28:49] trump brother troy was mad by the time
[1:28:51] you know i met him and brother jack
[1:28:53] wasn't married and i wasn't married and
[1:28:56] but i was older i was an adult i had
[1:28:59] kind of grew up the rough side of the
[1:29:02] mountain
[1:29:03] kind of raised myself and and but when
[1:29:06] brother westco called for the young
[1:29:08] people i was identified with them
[1:29:11] right whether whether i knew what was
[1:29:14] going on or not
[1:29:16] when he said young people brother smiley
[1:29:18] had to go all right and and knowing that
[1:29:21] you know what
[1:29:22] uh i'm you know of this mind that man
[1:29:25] who this man is the name man he'll tell
[1:29:27] me who what to do and where to go and
[1:29:29] what to do
[1:29:32] for all that all right you know
[1:29:35] you know i had that was my my mentality
[1:29:38] at first but then when the holy ghost
[1:29:41] drops in your heart you humble yourself
[1:29:45] amen to authority this is the problem we
[1:29:48] had
[1:29:51] the problem we're having in the home
[1:29:53] this is the problem we have in the
[1:29:54] church we're having this problem in the
[1:29:56] school we having this problem everywhere
[1:29:59] right
[1:30:00] everybody's doing what's pleasing and
[1:30:02] and nobody wants to be under the
[1:30:04] authority but that scripture
[1:30:07] that scripture
[1:30:08] come on
[1:30:10] you know the women in this day say well
[1:30:12] you know uh all we want is to take your
[1:30:15] name but we want to wear what we want to
[1:30:17] wear we want to do what we want to do we
[1:30:20] want to be our own head we want to be
[1:30:22] our own boss because now we make our own
[1:30:25] money and we strong uh
[1:30:28] african-american women all right
[1:30:31] and we strong caucasian women not too
[1:30:34] right and and we strongly and we
[1:30:36] educated and we got our own credit cards
[1:30:39] and we got uh and and we're smarter than
[1:30:42] you and all that you might be
[1:30:45] intellectually most smarter
[1:30:48] but that don't mean you smart all right
[1:30:50] all right
[1:30:52] cause you got see sometimes
[1:30:54] here's the problem we have even in
[1:30:56] church as lay members relate to to
[1:30:59] pastors
[1:31:00] because you think you intellectually
[1:31:02] smart you think you're smarter than the
[1:31:04] man all right
[1:31:05] right
[1:31:06] come on right now pastor for 23 years
[1:31:10] and i know because people feel like they
[1:31:11] can use bigger words than i can
[1:31:14] that that they're smarter than that than
[1:31:16] me all right not so all right
[1:31:19] see because i have experience i have a
[1:31:22] gift and i have the holy ghost revealing
[1:31:26] all right i have a here's the crazy
[1:31:28] thing
[1:31:30] people that you teach feel like hey man
[1:31:33] they're smarter than you all right and
[1:31:35] you there because you've been the
[1:31:37] instrument
[1:31:39] that have taught them and that have
[1:31:41] brought them to the place that they had
[1:31:43] right
[1:31:44] people come to church with their lives
[1:31:47] in a wreck messed up and everything else
[1:31:50] and god by inspiration using the tools
[1:31:55] transform your life transform
[1:31:58] relationships transform marriages and
[1:32:02] then we get to a place we get puffed up
[1:32:04] and we feel like man we no more
[1:32:06] he's like really wow
[1:32:08] i remember you when you first came in
[1:32:10] the door
[1:32:12] just how jacked up you was yes
[1:32:15] how messed up amen we were in our mind
[1:32:18] in our thinking is that right
[1:32:22] because amen we had a worldly way of
[1:32:24] thinking
[1:32:26] a kind of way of thinking and and that
[1:32:29] thinking
[1:32:30] was was was uh built because of our
[1:32:34] environments and because of uh you know
[1:32:36] our traditions and i'm i'm jamaican and
[1:32:39] i'm haitian and i'm american and that's
[1:32:43] nonsense you got to lay those things
[1:32:45] down i don't care if you come from the
[1:32:47] other side of the world you got to lay
[1:32:49] those things down because there has no
[1:32:52] place in the gospel amen
[1:32:54] well praise the lord amen
[1:32:56] well i might have to have a part 4 and 5
[1:32:59] before i get finished with this
[1:33:02] but but i'm just built a little bit
[1:33:04] different i just i have a lot of stuff
[1:33:07] but i go get to it when i get to it
[1:33:10] but it's a lot to be said amen
[1:33:14] brother branham preached the god of this
[1:33:16] evil age he preached satan eating
[1:33:19] what for what reason to identify for us
[1:33:23] amen to spirits
[1:33:26] right
[1:33:27] glory to god satan is the god of this
[1:33:30] evil age
[1:33:32] and and and
[1:33:34] we have to be careful we see this why i
[1:33:38] thank god that he came down with an open
[1:33:40] book
[1:33:41] handed it to his mouthpiece and he
[1:33:44] handed it to the ministry
[1:33:46] and it's constantly being unfolded to us
[1:33:51] amen uh sister lewis used to say in this
[1:33:53] song uh beat us strong and little by
[1:33:56] little
[1:33:58] and the bible says it's here a little
[1:34:00] there a little line upon line preach up
[1:34:02] upon precept is that right right glory
[1:34:05] to god
[1:34:07] amen hallelujah yes all right i'm uh i'm
[1:34:10] a leader
[1:34:11] and see if i can get back over here
[1:34:14] okay y'all all right amen
[1:34:16] glory to god i'm gonna talk fast cause i
[1:34:20] talk fast when i get
[1:34:22] get anointed but y'all go back and
[1:34:24] listen again i have i have to do it
[1:34:26] myself hallelujah
[1:34:29] okay so he says the fear the lord is the
[1:34:31] beginning of wisdom
[1:34:32] a good understanding
[1:34:35] have
[1:34:36] have all they
[1:34:38] that do his commandments
[1:34:44] see when when you find people
[1:34:49] not doing the word it shows they lack
[1:34:52] spiritual understanding all right
[1:34:54] all right
[1:34:55] all right
[1:34:58] and this be this be i i the battle of
[1:35:01] the ministry
[1:35:02] right and like brother brothers jack and
[1:35:05] i realized you know this is tying in
[1:35:07] with brother jack's previous two
[1:35:10] messages right yeah
[1:35:13] you're going to understand it right see
[1:35:16] it like like
[1:35:19] raising children the first thing that
[1:35:21] they ask you because they lack spiritual
[1:35:23] understanding or they just like
[1:35:24] understanding it is why
[1:35:28] right come on church y'all like like
[1:35:30] y'all ain't had no ain't got no children
[1:35:32] some of y'all may not but
[1:35:33] y'all with children and y'all ask y'all
[1:35:35] mama why
[1:35:37] why can't i
[1:35:39] why can't i go over to you know jimmy's
[1:35:42] house and why can't i do this and why
[1:35:45] can't i wear this and why why why why
[1:35:49] the reason why you ask why is because
[1:35:51] you lack understanding
[1:35:54] when when our understanding becomes
[1:35:56] fruitful you stop asking why you you
[1:36:00] understand i understand why my dad
[1:36:04] does not want me to go here
[1:36:07] why he does not want me to go there why
[1:36:10] he does not want me to deal with this
[1:36:12] person
[1:36:14] right why my mama won't let me do this
[1:36:17] why she want to keep me away from there
[1:36:20] right right but but when we like
[1:36:23] understanding
[1:36:24] like you know you know for me
[1:36:26] it's things that i fought in raising my
[1:36:29] children it's things that i did not let
[1:36:32] them do
[1:36:33] and i was constantly constantly under
[1:36:37] the microscopes and you know my family
[1:36:40] members and i got five boys
[1:36:42] huh
[1:36:43] and and and you know what i don't boys
[1:36:46] playing sports
[1:36:48] you know it's a hard thing to tell a
[1:36:52] sports oriented
[1:36:54] family that you'll find boys especially
[1:36:56] knowing that i played sports all right
[1:36:59] right and possibly could have gone
[1:37:01] somewhere
[1:37:02] uh because of sports
[1:37:04] that i'm not allowing my kids to play
[1:37:06] sports
[1:37:07] i did not
[1:37:09] allow christina to play sports
[1:37:12] you say well why because i saw the
[1:37:15] spirit
[1:37:17] the spirit
[1:37:19] right because the all of these things
[1:37:21] carry a spirit
[1:37:23] and when people don't think nothing up
[1:37:26] we take our little you know uh doll out
[1:37:29] there and we get we got out there
[1:37:31] playing ball yes he can shake and bake
[1:37:33] and all that
[1:37:36] huh yeah see
[1:37:38] she's crossed over a man into a
[1:37:40] masculine people don't know nothing
[1:37:43] people they cross over into masculine
[1:37:45] domain you take on masculine spirit and
[1:37:48] so instead of you liking boys you start
[1:37:50] liking girls
[1:37:53] watch the percentage
[1:37:55] what's the percentage of women athletes
[1:37:59] and who they date
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:19] y'all don't talk to him up in here don't
[1:38:20] get cried on me today
[1:38:24] huh i understood these things
[1:38:28] see i wasn't trying to produce idols
[1:38:33] you know i looked at my boys anyway and

[1:39:35] justin is the intellectual
[1:39:38] i knew i didn't even realize i was
[1:39:41] prophesying over him
[1:39:43] when the day
[1:39:44] that he was born
[1:39:46] when he came out
[1:39:48] you know i was my wife was talking to me
[1:39:50] about you know what if you have a girl i
[1:39:52] was like okay yeah what if we have a
[1:39:54] girl you know that's fine that's right
[1:39:56] as soon as what she said is they say

[1:40:03] i had already my wife looked at me she
[1:40:06] was like i thought you said yeah i know
[1:40:09] i did say that but when i said when i
[1:40:12] saw the boy you know automatically and i
[1:40:15] watched him i watched him grow in the
[1:40:18] church as a little boy
[1:40:21] right his whole life he sat on the front
[1:40:24] row
[1:40:25] two years old sitting on the front row
[1:40:28] and would fight with you amen because he
[1:40:30] wanted to wear a suit he didn't care how
[1:40:32] it looked the tire could be one thing
[1:40:35] the past could be one thing the jacket
[1:40:37] he just wanted to make sure that
[1:40:40] yeah huh sitting there with his little
[1:40:42] sippy cup
[1:40:46] huh
[1:40:46] justin never sat in the back of no
[1:40:48] church never
[1:40:51] and he you know his older kids and he
[1:40:53] gravitated towards the older kids and
[1:40:56] and and the musicians and man he started
[1:41:00] playing music he just had a gift
[1:41:03] i watched him yesterday at the funeral
[1:41:06] while gina was struggling i had called
[1:41:08] him up because i seen him standing in
[1:41:10] the back i told him going up here and uh
[1:41:14] he came up
[1:41:15] and i know i should probably shocked him
[1:41:18] like
[1:41:19] you you're my son i don't care where you
[1:41:21] go what you do
[1:41:23] those things don't matter
[1:41:25] you're going to be my son till the day i
[1:41:28] die
[1:41:29] right
[1:41:31] amen and so i called him up and and my
[1:41:33] wife she was struggling on that piano
[1:41:36] and i said
[1:41:39] go help your momma
[1:41:44] he just walked down there
[1:41:46] it won by two minutes he
[1:41:51] that was it he was riding with it
[1:41:54] and mama was looking at him i'm like
[1:41:55] yeah
[1:41:57] yeah
[1:41:59] he's a little more elevated because he
[1:42:02] listened to more stuff it's normally my
[1:42:05] normally my wife you know when she was
[1:42:08] playing all the time she don't play as
[1:42:10] much as she probably used to she would
[1:42:12] give her a second she got you sang
[1:42:14] whether it's country you know blue
[1:42:18] y'all know everybody don't say the same
[1:42:21] she got you
[1:42:24] but you you you know you you just kind
[1:42:26] of have to
[1:42:27] have this understanding
[1:42:30] right they couldn't understand what i
[1:42:32] was doing
[1:42:34] right it's a lot of things that that i
[1:42:35] kept them away from they couldn't
[1:42:38] understand it but i understood that you
[1:42:40] know what i have to follow the precepts
[1:42:43] and the commandments of god right amen
[1:42:47] right
[1:42:48] amen see there's a reproach that goes
[1:42:52] along with serving god
[1:42:54] there's a reproach that goes along with
[1:42:56] me and and no matter how much i preach
[1:42:59] it's it's everybody families in the
[1:43:01] church their sons playing sports but i
[1:43:04] knew the first time amen i would allow
[1:43:06] one of mine to play that's it
[1:43:09] that's it
[1:43:10] i remember i remember a brother told me
[1:43:12] that he said brother man i'ma tell you
[1:43:14] somebody said you ain't telling me
[1:43:16] nothing i don't already know i've been
[1:43:17] doing this for a little while i already
[1:43:19] know
[1:43:20] but i had got to a a point where i was
[1:43:24] kind of pressured
[1:43:26] and trying to hold everything together
[1:43:29] i i
[1:43:30] i had to make a decision
[1:43:34] i can't say today was the right decision
[1:43:36] but i had to make a decision
[1:43:39] to try to try to keep my family together
[1:43:43] amen
[1:43:44] right
[1:43:45] i i made a decision you know because i
[1:43:48] could have really
[1:43:49] been dog and then you know i would make
[1:43:53] statements right
[1:43:55] like i know i'm allowing it something to
[1:43:58] happen that i don't fully agree with
[1:44:01] but but i'm at a point and i'm i'm a man
[1:44:06] as much as the holy ghost is in me maybe
[1:44:09] i'm making this decision
[1:44:11] uh from from my manly standpoint by
[1:44:14] being a man by being a father
[1:44:18] from the word i don't think i'm making
[1:44:20] the right decision but i'm trying to
[1:44:23] hold together i'm trying to hold the
[1:44:24] church together see
[1:44:26] i made decisions and choices that the
[1:44:29] church folk didn't know that i was
[1:44:31] making
[1:44:33] it wasn't just for me it was for them
[1:44:35] too
[1:44:39] sometimes the shepherd got to do things
[1:44:42] amen for the sake of the people
[1:44:45] sometimes you got to be
[1:44:47] be looked at amen
[1:44:49] and take the wrong knowing you right
[1:44:52] right
[1:44:54] for the sake of the gospel right
[1:44:56] sometimes you just you just can't say
[1:44:59] something about everything
[1:45:02] there's times you you you make decisions
[1:45:05] and you do things and and
[1:45:07] you know people don't understand right
[1:45:10] right and and they they get to looking
[1:45:13] at yourself righteous and they say how
[1:45:15] could you be self-righteous at me and
[1:45:17] all y'all got all y'all children
[1:45:20] flipping on their head
[1:45:22] running track playing ball doing all of
[1:45:25] this but then i'm criticized the moment
[1:45:27] one of my children do anything
[1:45:29] right
[1:45:30] i gave you all the word y'all made a
[1:45:32] choice
[1:45:33] but the moment i tried to make a choice
[1:45:36] for all of us i got criticized
[1:45:39] i'm gonna leave that alone all right but
[1:45:42] i'm saying this just to kind of show us
[1:45:45] show us something how how folk
[1:45:48] lack spiritual understanding
[1:45:52] right
[1:45:53] amen for some things there's i mean we
[1:45:56] we got a manual
[1:45:58] right yeah we we got a manual

[1:46:28] see
[1:46:28] glory to god you got the manual but but

[1:46:34] so see see i'm saying something this

[1:47:00] growing up under brother jack and
[1:47:02] hearing brother cuico and brother troy
[1:47:04] and them and
[1:47:05] trusted after a while behind by we'll
[1:47:07] hear more brother jerry
[1:47:09] but but but i'm i'm growing i'm i'm
[1:47:12] sitting back you know you have to be a
[1:47:15] crazy person to get to a point where you
[1:47:17] stop learning
[1:47:20] you stop growing you can't this is
[1:47:23] inexhaustible
[1:47:25] right and and i'm gonna tell you
[1:47:27] something
[1:47:28] you know you you grow as a as a minister
[1:47:32] cause some things that i would have
[1:47:34] hammered
[1:47:36] when i first started
[1:47:38] that that
[1:47:39] you know you you get a little bit more
[1:47:41] easy
[1:47:43] i i i got friends that said why brothers
[1:47:46] i
[1:47:46] blasted them and i kind of cringe
[1:47:48] sometimes i say no i'm not trying to
[1:47:51] just blast people
[1:47:53] i'm trying to help i'm trying to help
[1:47:55] people grow
[1:47:58] they think different
[1:48:00] look at look at things from a more
[1:48:03] biblical yeah complete standpoint out of
[1:48:06] work
[1:48:08] right
[1:48:09] i'm just going to say this because i
[1:48:11] feel led to say this this morning right
[1:48:13] quick and i was going to try to bring it
[1:48:15] in a certain point but but something
[1:48:17] that i heard yesterday right
[1:48:20] uh as as it relates to to young people
[1:48:23] and you know i i say i was saying to
[1:48:26] myself uh
[1:48:28] if you say something to me
[1:48:30] i might not say nothing back to you
[1:48:32] about it
[1:48:33] but don't think you pass something over
[1:48:35] by me
[1:48:37] because it's very i it's just a lot that
[1:48:39] i just don't miss i may not say anything
[1:48:41] about a lot of things i'll laugh with
[1:48:43] you and have a good time and and just
[1:48:45] let you going on thank you fooled me
[1:48:47] with that
[1:48:49] but you know i was listening to the
[1:48:50] fella and uh i'm gonna try to just do it
[1:48:53] discreetly and just some of the comments
[1:48:56] i was like no i don't know
[1:48:58] some of that sounds good but
[1:49:01] when you look at that thing through uh
[1:49:03] the eyes of the word it's not good
[1:49:07] stop parenting your children what that's
[1:49:09] not scriptural
[1:49:11] that ain't scripture
[1:49:13] that's not scriptural that's right
[1:49:15] we've been we've been we've been called
[1:49:18] if i can i don't know how much time i
[1:49:20] get
[1:49:22] we've we've been we've been called
[1:49:26] to train up a child
[1:49:28] and the way it should go
[1:49:31] right
[1:49:32] i think sometimes the worst
[1:49:34] the worst
[1:49:36] mistake that my mother did she did the
[1:49:38] best that she could and i'm not i'm not
[1:49:40] condemning her for what she did was
[1:49:42] giving us so much leeway
[1:49:46] right
[1:49:47] i remember i i spoke to an old friend of
[1:49:49] mine uh maybe a few months back
[1:49:52] and he was saying he was saying will he
[1:49:54] said man man my daddy my daddy didn't
[1:49:58] let didn't let us do all of the things
[1:50:01] that y'all got a chance to do
[1:50:03] right i said he was a smart man
[1:50:07] he was a smart man for not allowing you
[1:50:10] not allowing amen you guys to do the
[1:50:14] things that we were doing because we
[1:50:17] were doing things at a young age that we
[1:50:19] should not have been doing
[1:50:22] i shouldn't have been smoking weed at no
[1:50:24] 11 years old come on
[1:50:26] come on
[1:50:27] i shouldn't have been gambling and all
[1:50:30] of this kind of stuff as a teenager
[1:50:33] right
[1:50:34] but but but because i had so much leeway
[1:50:39] right
[1:50:40] as a kid
[1:50:42] right you ain't even developed enough to
[1:50:45] make the right decisions for yourself
[1:50:49] praise god
[1:50:51] right most of the decisions that young
[1:50:53] people make
[1:50:56] ain't right
[1:50:58] the truth
[1:51:01] glory to god glory to god most of the
[1:51:04] decisions and and the people that are
[1:51:07] associated with
[1:51:10] bad choices
[1:51:12] right bad choices
[1:51:14] see so so
[1:51:16] think about this if i would have had a
[1:51:18] man there
[1:51:20] right
[1:51:21] a man there
[1:51:24] right with my mother
[1:51:26] that was spiritual
[1:51:28] that had good understanding let me let
[1:51:30] me just get right here right quick
[1:51:33] i'm gonna jump i'm gonna skip over
[1:51:35] right
[1:51:37] let's go to
[1:51:38] uh psalms 112. it says praise you the
[1:51:40] lord
[1:51:41] uh
[1:51:42] blessed is the man
[1:51:43] that feareth the lord that delighteth
[1:51:46] greatly in his commandments
[1:51:48] okay all right
[1:51:50] watch this
[1:51:52] blessed is the man
[1:51:55] notice
[1:51:56] this ain't no word play that's there's a
[1:51:59] reason why
[1:52:00] it said just like that
[1:52:04] right
[1:52:06] because there's an order to god amen
[1:52:10] that you can't get around
[1:52:13] see as as men
[1:52:15] we we got to realize
[1:52:17] we've been given uh a tremendous
[1:52:21] responsibility
[1:52:24] right
[1:52:25] i'm telling you church we've as as a man
[1:52:28] you know
[1:52:29] we have to make decisions
[1:52:32] and and we we got to be looked at funny
[1:52:36] and and all of that that right
[1:52:39] see brother browner makes a statement he
[1:52:40] says you know what uh i want y'all to
[1:52:43] understand it at that day you're gonna
[1:52:46] be hell responsible for her not her
[1:52:49] responsible for you
[1:52:51] amen well praise the lord
[1:52:55] i'm i'm right where i want to be at now
[1:52:57] amen
[1:52:58] right
[1:52:59] see everything else has to come up under
[1:53:02] this umbrella
[1:53:04] in order to be right it matters
[1:53:07] right
[1:53:07] the
[1:53:08] mark had a quote by lord help me
[1:53:11] help me if i have to do a part for i
[1:53:13] will
[1:53:14] right
[1:53:15] see
[1:53:16] as the man
[1:53:18] we've been given a position
[1:53:20] and a place
[1:53:22] in the economy of god
[1:53:26] in the perspective of god
[1:53:30] right
[1:53:31] see god had a perspective
[1:53:35] way back before let there
[1:53:39] yes sir be
[1:53:40] see when we look at genesis
[1:53:44] we see the expression
[1:53:46] of fatherhood
[1:53:49] come on
[1:53:50] we see the expression of fatherhood
[1:53:53] we see a man creating
[1:53:55] an environment
[1:53:58] right
[1:54:00] amen a place of protection
[1:54:03] right
[1:54:04] all all of this takes place when he was
[1:54:07] saying let there be this
[1:54:09] let there be that
[1:54:10] let there be this
[1:54:13] and then placing his children in a
[1:54:15] positioning place
[1:54:18] that wasn't for naught all right
[1:54:20] all right right amen
[1:54:22] god had had a plan in his mind god had
[1:54:26] thoughts god god he wanted to be a
[1:54:28] father right
[1:54:30] he wanted to express himself from
[1:54:31] fatherhood
[1:54:33] under
[1:54:34] understanding real true manhood and real
[1:54:37] true fatherhood you know watch something
[1:54:41] right
[1:54:43] as a man as a father he gave his
[1:54:46] children commandments
[1:54:50] right when they broke those commandments
[1:54:54] he come and he judged them
[1:54:57] yes yes
[1:54:58] right
[1:55:00] glory to god as a that's manhood
[1:55:04] right right brother branham talks about
[1:55:07] it in shalom he said these things are
[1:55:09] being broken down
[1:55:11] right it's in there i got the quotes but
[1:55:13] i know what's on here
[1:55:15] right all of these things is being
[1:55:18] broken down women want to be man man
[1:55:20] want to be women
[1:55:22] come on yeah right right
[1:55:25] and and sometimes like and i ain't even
[1:55:28] talking about uh uh where the man trying
[1:55:31] to dress like a woman and this and that
[1:55:33] the other and the woman taking off the
[1:55:35] skirt not even in that
[1:55:37] right we talk about domineering spirits
[1:55:42] being dominant
[1:55:44] being controlling right
[1:55:47] didn't i tell you
[1:55:53] i know i'm a clam up
[1:55:56] you what
[1:55:58] lord jesus
[1:56:00] help me
[1:56:02] oh lord i need you to help me
[1:56:07] help me on my journey
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:11] help me on my way yeah you did not do
[1:56:15] that
[1:56:17] right

[1:56:21] i get the
[1:56:24] sup get the moving in me like
[1:56:26] lord jesus
[1:56:29] that's that man part right
[1:56:33] right
[1:56:34] you you see it's kind of a role reversal
[1:56:37] and then we we
[1:56:39] we we put it on we make excuses
[1:56:42] and and i know it's a lot of it's a lot
[1:56:44] of women raising their children without
[1:56:47] a man a lot of that your fault
[1:56:52] well
[1:56:53] because see if if we were to stay with
[1:56:55] this commandment marriage is honorable
[1:56:58] and the bad is undefiled it'll be a
[1:57:01] whole lot of women married
[1:57:07] all right
[1:57:09] instead of all this

[2:03:37] he said but i know honey but i just saw
[2:03:40] that and i just thought that you you
[2:03:42] know i did that many times i don't know
[2:03:44] how to do it now
[2:03:45] but i did it
[2:03:47] huh
[2:03:48] and sisters be like such a gina girl
[2:03:52] right and all she could do is say yeah
[2:03:54] he did it again
[2:03:56] like i said everybody ain't built like
[2:03:58] me
[2:04:00] huh that's just this is just what i like
[2:04:02] to do something in my spare time
[2:04:06] but i'm a man
[2:04:07] well mans man i don't don't don't get me
[2:04:09] twisted
[2:04:11] cause you you cross me the wrong way
[2:04:13] it'll take the holy ghost fire and power
[2:04:18] i'll tell you quick i'm six three and a
[2:04:20] half 275
[2:04:23] i'm gonna leave that alone
[2:04:26] i ain't forgot how to fight even though
[2:04:28] i had one in about 30 years
[2:04:31] i think i could pull out what
[2:04:35] just enough to get you off me
[2:04:39] all right
[2:04:41] but blessing is how much time i got
[2:04:46] see that there's a there's a position
[2:04:49] and a place i'm trying to go somewhere
[2:04:51] i'm gonna hit this and i'm gonna go
[2:04:52] maybe i'll pick it up again we'll see
[2:04:54] next time uh uh
[2:04:56] and this is why when when i heard that i
[2:04:59] was like
[2:05:02] see you can't leave them to their own
[2:05:04] devices
[2:05:06] right you can't leave them to figure it
[2:05:09] out on their own
[2:05:11] right
[2:05:12] see that that's why god allows you to go
[2:05:15] through what you go through so when you
[2:05:17] have children see i never wanted my
[2:05:20] children to get high
[2:05:22] and do drugs and sell drugs and all of
[2:05:24] that
[2:05:25] they never saw me do that

[2:05:34] i've never cussed out their mama
[2:05:37] i've never argued they never
[2:05:40] me and since gina been together we've

[2:05:51] it might have been times i might have
[2:05:52] felt like it

[2:11:28] we're supposed to be
[2:11:30] the generation of the upright
[2:11:33] right but look at the influences and
[2:11:35] what's around
[2:11:36] us right and and all the young people
[2:11:40] you know they say where you don't parent
[2:11:42] amen yes

[2:11:54] yeah you know y'all paying i got
[2:11:56] something else to say don't don't parent
[2:11:58] that's nonsense that ain't biblical
[2:12:01] it's not biblical
[2:12:02] i would tell them today i say you know
[2:12:04] brother branham one time at the choosing
[2:12:07] over brad
[2:12:08] he was talking about going about cattle
[2:12:12] with with this fella and he said he was
[2:12:14] wondering why why he was always looking
[2:12:16] the cattle in the eye
[2:12:18] he said boy you got a lot to learn fella
[2:12:21] got a lot to learn
[2:12:22] he said because if he said listen here's
[2:12:26] the thing
[2:12:27] if it's a female
[2:12:29] and and it got that cow got that wild
[2:12:32] stare scary ripped out of look in her
[2:12:35] eyes he said she will not make a good
[2:12:39] mother to a calves
[2:12:41] right
[2:12:42] glory to god
[2:12:44] amen he said i'm gonna teach you
[2:12:46] something boy she will not
[2:12:50] he said the reason she fat she in a pen
[2:12:54] huh see sometimes you got to keep them
[2:12:56] in the pen
[2:12:58] to keep them from being undefiled i know
[2:13:00] what i'm talking about
[2:13:03] the hardest thing that has been
[2:13:07] is letting my children
[2:13:09] have a choice because they growed up
[2:13:11] that's been the hardest thing for me
[2:13:14] that's been the hardest thing for me i
[2:13:15] got one daughter
[2:13:18] one daughter
[2:13:20] and it takes everything in daddy
[2:13:25] see
[2:13:26] but but i realize she's an adult she's
[2:13:28] got to make her own decision
[2:13:30] i don't like him
[2:13:35] i don't like him
[2:13:37] she know i don't like him
[2:13:40] but i love her
[2:13:42] i love her as a daddy
[2:13:46] but i don't like him
[2:13:48] huh i don't as a daddy but i love her i
[2:13:52] got to let her make a decision i got to
[2:13:54] let her make her the choices but a lot
[2:13:56] of things i don't like my boys this
[2:13:59] thing i don't like
[2:14:02] i don't fuss with them about them i
[2:14:04] ain't trying to hurt them or nothing
[2:14:05] like that
[2:14:06] they already know they grew up under me
[2:14:08] so they know you know uh i do not like
[2:14:11] them but they do it anyway
[2:14:14] right they do it anyway
[2:14:20] it was it was hard letting christina go
[2:14:22] off the the university of miami
[2:14:26] see that that
[2:14:28] you want them to get an education and
[2:14:30] and all of that and and those things
[2:14:32] look good
[2:14:34] some of that i don't be even looking at
[2:14:37] right
[2:14:38] i'm looking at scripture i'm looking at
[2:14:41] what the word says in the mind of god
[2:14:44] and and all that and i know we got
[2:14:46] promises for our children and all of
[2:14:48] that
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:50] yeah i know all of that
[2:14:52] but but i i you know i also look at the
[2:14:55] fact that you know i did marry my wife
[2:14:57] and she didn't go that far she could
[2:14:59] have went to yale
[2:15:01] she didn't
[2:15:02] right

[2:15:06] that you look at you'll be like you know
[2:15:09] you'll be like
[2:15:10] lord i'm gonna leave it alone jesus
