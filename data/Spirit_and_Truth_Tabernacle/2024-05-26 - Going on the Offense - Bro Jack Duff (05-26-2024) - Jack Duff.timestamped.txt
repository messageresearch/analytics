[48:36] I'm sorry the um ministers
[48:38] meeting um on um morning and we used the
[48:42] topic of
[48:44] empowerment uh for adoption and you know
[48:47] had a wonderful time and then on Sunday
[48:49] morning there brother belon and uh we
[48:52] ministered on their Rock it's not like
[48:54] our Rock and and uh after the service um
[48:58] sister belon just was feeling the

[49:06] just giv words of exhortation but a real
[49:10] mighty presence uh come into the
[49:13] sanctuary just as um a real mighty
[49:15] presence came into this
[49:17] Sanctuary amen uh but it was it was just
[49:21] a a joy after I finished watching the
[49:23] service on last Sunday here I I couldn't
[49:26] help but uh think to myself I'm so happy
[49:31] that God has allowed me Amen to be a
[49:35] part of spirit and Truth
[49:37] Tabernacle
[49:39] amen
[49:41] amen
[49:43] amen you know people people get bumper
[49:46] stickers and they put on their cars I
[49:49] love my church and and I say I would get
[49:51] a bumper sticker but I don't like put
[49:53] them bumper stickers on my cars don't
[49:55] mess up my car like that but if I had a
[49:57] little sign or
[50:00] something I put it in the window or
[50:02] something but I love my church amen I
[50:05] thank God for my church praise the
[50:08] Lord praise the Lord but while we were
[50:12] away amen I was just uh the sermon that
[50:15] brother chore brought on last Sunday I
[50:17] was just so blessed by it the transform
[50:20] uh transformative power of love and uh I
[50:24] just thought just the way he he brought
[50:25] it out and some of the quotes that he
[50:27] used uh he was talking about how this um
[50:32] uh man was in the hospital I believe it
[50:34] was and uh there was really no hope for
[50:36] him but the church had gathered at the
[50:39] hospital and began to pray we don't do
[50:41] things like that no more but uh but but
[50:45] we need to right the church had gathered
[50:47] there began to pray and they I believe
[50:49] brother brandom showed up and the Lord
[50:51] didn't give brother brandom nothing they
[50:53] were looking for a vision God gave him
[50:54] nothing and then all of a sudden it
[50:56] change and and brother brandom say the
[50:59] reason that this man is going to walk
[51:00] out this hospital is because the love
[51:03] amongst the
[51:04] people their love has been demonstrated
[51:07] the love of the people touched the heart
[51:09] of
[51:10] God and brought healing to that man I
[51:14] tell you what that's that's some trans
[51:16] transformational power in love and the
[51:21] devil's job is to try to keep us divided
[51:24] amen but uh we got to fight that spirit
[51:26] and just stay in love with one another
[51:29] amen
[51:31] amen praise
[51:35] God so brother Troy thank you so much

[52:22] just up trying to make sure I I got a
[52:25] chance to to listen listen to that

[52:30] lot to me amen some sometime there's a

[53:11] here um brother Brandon say he had 1,000
[53:15] invitations and there ain't no way he

[53:21] Direction on where you want me to go
[53:23] what you want me to do and and I don't
[53:25] have a thousand but but I do get a lot
[53:27] as a pastor and uh and and and I I'm

[53:56] anything right and Cu uh it just I just

[54:04] this is his church it's not mine amen

[54:09] my part that I play but this is God's
[54:11] church amen and he's dealing with his

[54:39] to say have been going into a certain
[54:42] direction you mentioned a scripture in
[54:44] the sermon before on U be still and uh
[54:49] that scripture was a scripture I had
[54:50] been meditating on and waiting to preach
[54:52] on and then you came and uh you preach

[55:01] read Ecclesiastes 3 uh there's a time
[55:04] and season for everything and uh there's
[55:07] a time of war and there's a time of
[55:10] peace and praise God I believe we in a
[55:13] time of
[55:14] War amen and you can look at it in the
[55:17] in the in the natural there's a there's
[55:19] Wars going on but what about in a
[55:22] spiritual amen there should be a war
[55:24] going on we we got to recognize and like
[55:26] brother Solomon said we not on a picnic
[55:28] right now we'll do that tomorrow but in
[55:30] here is
[55:32] war and if the devil got any of your
[55:35] family

[1:03:07] church amen but but but we need to bring
[1:03:10] that gift back into the church too where

[1:03:58] is when they intercept or get a
[1:04:00] fumble praise God but they always moving

[1:12:32] yes sir that are sons of God are amateur
[1:12:38] Gods sir it says how many ever know that
[1:12:43] how many knows that Jesus said so the
[1:12:46] the the Bible Jesus said didn't not your
[1:12:49] law say itself that you are gods and if
[1:12:53] you call them Gods which God said in
[1:12:56] Genesis 2 that they were Gods because
[1:12:58] they had full
[1:13:01] domain over the Dominion of the world he
[1:13:05] gave him dominion over all things and he
[1:13:08] lost his
[1:13:12] godship he lost his
[1:13:15] sunship he lost his domain and Satan
[1:13:19] took it over look at this now but
[1:13:22] brother we are waiting for the
[1:13:26] manifestations of the sons of God Romans
[1:13:28] 8 we're waiting for the manifestations
[1:13:31] of the sons of God who will come back
[1:13:35] now Watch What Happens what they do now
[1:13:36] when they come back they take it over
[1:13:39] again yes sir and that mean the devil
[1:13:42] not going to just give it up to you sir
[1:13:45] but you're going to have to do something
[1:13:47] in order to take it over again and this
[1:13:50] is why the scripture said the kingdom of
[1:13:52] God has suffered violence but the
[1:13:56] violent praise godu take it by
[1:14:01] force Lord glory to God let's go back
[1:14:04] into that Amen in a little bit but I
[1:14:07] just just just just just just just he
[1:14:08] said we're waiting they're waiting for
[1:14:10] the sons of God to come and take it over
[1:14:13] again waiting for the fullness of time
[1:14:17] when the pyramid gets up to the top when
[1:14:20] the full sons of God will be manifested
[1:14:22] when the power of God will walk out
[1:14:24] Hallelujah and will and will and will
[1:14:30] take I like that brother sister I like
[1:14:33] that will
[1:14:35] take every Power that Satan got away
[1:14:39] from him yes sir belongs to him now now
[1:14:42] we seen our Lord do this yes sir our
[1:14:44] Lord amen uh during the time of his his
[1:14:49] crucifixion amen and uh brother brandom
[1:14:52] gives us a a better scene like when he
[1:14:54] went into the grave he actually went
[1:14:56] down into the pits of Hell amen and he
[1:14:59] described these three different regions
[1:15:01] down there right you know region of loss
[1:15:03] and Hell itself and you know there was
[1:15:05] one other I can't think of the name of
[1:15:07] it right now but but it described three
[1:15:08] different regions but when when Jesus
[1:15:10] went down there he didn't go and ask the
[1:15:13] devil for no keys he took the keys of
[1:15:19] death hell and the grave sir so so when
[1:15:24] I realized that these keys are in Jesus
[1:15:26] hands anything that ever happened even
[1:15:28] when it comes to death it's not the
[1:15:30] devil that's why that's why the prophet
[1:15:32] could tell us that death was just a
[1:15:34] buggy yes sir come on somebody amen it
[1:15:38] was just a buggy amen a tool in the
[1:15:41] hands of God to pull the believer right
[1:15:44] into the presence of his maker yes sir
[1:15:46] amen so we don't even give amen we don't
[1:15:49] even give the credit to the devil even
[1:15:51] in death we look the devil in the eye
[1:15:54] like Paul all de death where is your
[1:15:59] sting grave where is your Victory
[1:16:03] because we know who owns and who conquer
[1:16:06] death Hell In The
[1:16:08] Grave
[1:16:09] Hall you got the keys to it and he took
[1:16:12] those keys yes sir brother brandom say
[1:16:14] he he he took them from him then he gave
[1:16:17] Satan a
[1:16:19] kick man can you imagine that somebody
[1:16:21] coming into your house taking the keys
[1:16:23] to your house
[1:16:26] but that's the god that we
[1:16:28] serve that's that's who that's who our
[1:16:30] savior is he took it from the devil we
[1:16:33] taking it from the devil we taking it
[1:16:35] back we taking it back glory to God
[1:16:38] glory to God let me go on here amen uh

[1:16:49] dropping some of these things in we
[1:16:51] we're going on the offense now I I want

[1:16:59] you're go on an offense that you that
[1:17:01] you're going to do one is you're going
[1:17:03] to use the word of God to fight the
[1:17:06] devil and let me tell you something you
[1:17:07] don't need no Supernatural power to
[1:17:10] fight the devil brother brandom told us
[1:17:12] that Jesus himself used it is written
[1:17:16] Amen in order to defeat the Devil with
[1:17:18] those three wild attacks that Satan gave
[1:17:20] him so we got to pick up amen pick up

[1:24:37] his knees before almighty God In The
[1:24:41] Name of Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ he doesn't realize what power
[1:24:46] that is if the people could only realize
[1:24:50] that what is given right unto them
[1:24:52] anything glory to God God anything that
[1:24:56] you ask for will be given if you can

[1:26:28] encore and sister Bernice's life yes sir
[1:26:31] we ain't taking de feat
[1:26:33] nowhere praise
[1:26:35] God he says now when Jesus was here on
[1:26:38] Earth I believe he was well he was
[1:26:40] Immanuel God was in Christ reconciling
[1:26:41] the world to himself so all the great
[1:26:43] qualities of the father was in Christ
[1:26:45] Jesus the son when he was here on Earth
[1:26:47] all the father
[1:26:48] was all the father has was his and all
[1:26:52] the fine gifts that's in God and all
[1:26:53] that was was was in Christ but when he
[1:26:56] met Satan he never used any of those
[1:26:58] gifts he just uh he he just to be your
[1:27:01] example he brought it to where the very
[1:27:04] weakest of Christians he had the power
[1:27:08] right then to rebuke Satan and send him
[1:27:10] away but what what he did he never
[1:27:12] referred to his own to any of his power
[1:27:15] Satan said if thou be the Son of God
[1:27:17] there is always a question mark across
[1:27:20] God's word by Satan so J so so he said
[1:27:23] uh so now Jesus said it is written in
[1:27:25] the father's word man shall not live by
[1:27:27] bread alone he taken him up on the
[1:27:29] temple and and uh the top of the temple
[1:27:31] and said to to hold him to cast himself
[1:27:33] down he said it is written right back to
[1:27:35] the scripture then he taken sat Satan up
[1:27:37] to a mountain showed all the kingdoms of
[1:27:39] the world said I'll give it to you if
[1:27:41] you Bow Down and Worship me Jesus said
[1:27:42] it's written so constantly it's written
[1:27:45] it's written it's written that's right
[1:27:47] Hallelujah and this is this is this goes
[1:27:50] with what brother Jerry said when you
[1:27:52] can hit Satan with the scripture
[1:27:55] hell hello yes sir that's right brother
[1:28:00] Hallelujah when you can hit Satan with
[1:28:03] the
[1:28:04] scripture he's just as
[1:28:08] powerless as he can
[1:28:11] be we going on the
[1:28:13] offense we going to rise up and start
[1:28:15] using our weapon we're going to use the
[1:28:18] word of God and we're going to watch
[1:28:20] that little itty bitty devil get smaller

[1:28:37] this theme for this year's restoration
[1:28:41] and when I first came out I'm going to
[1:28:43] the restoration of Bri tree when I first
[1:28:45] started the year off the Lord just gave
[1:28:47] that to me we started with this sermon
[1:28:49] restoration Bri tree and and in in that
[1:28:51] first sermon I said uh this is a year
[1:28:54] here that we'll go on the offense I
[1:28:56] mentioned something like that and and I
[1:28:58] said I had a I was just a little um in
[1:29:01] my heart I just didn't know which way to
[1:29:03] go with that first sermon do I preach uh
[1:29:06] the the the get back in step or do I
[1:29:08] preach going on the offense and I just
[1:29:10] made a few statements about going on the
[1:29:12] offense but the Lord just kind of saved
[1:29:13] it until now where we can actually
[1:29:15] preach it but I want to show you where I
[1:29:17] was getting that inspiration from out of
[1:29:19] restoration of the Bri tree praise God
[1:29:22] now look at this brother brandom just to
[1:29:24] uh reiterate some things that we've
[1:29:26] already learned but it's is there's
[1:29:28] there's there it's always good to uh
[1:29:30] reinforce it because I think sometimes
[1:29:33] it starts settling down in the people do
[1:29:35] y'all realize that ever since we took
[1:29:38] this theme on restoration that's what
[1:29:40] God been doing

[1:32:28] that in church and hug our brother and
[1:32:30] hug our sister and and and if we had
[1:32:33] something in between us we make that
[1:32:34] thing right let me also say this I was
[1:32:37] so apprecia to brother brother Solomon
[1:32:39] standing here and apologizing to brother
[1:32:41] Jimmy
[1:32:44] publicly some of us need to do that
[1:32:46] privately but he was willing to do that
[1:32:48] publicly what he's doing he's actually
[1:32:50] clearing out the amen clearing out
[1:32:52] anything that the devil could try to use
[1:32:55] against us but we used to do that we
[1:32:56] would go and just Slob on each other's
[1:32:59] shirts and dresses and blouses and I
[1:33:02] mean you you you you had to go put it in
[1:33:04] the
[1:33:07] cleaners but we really meant it from my
[1:33:10] heart brother I'm sorry sister I'm sorry
[1:33:14] I just don't want nothing to hinder amen
[1:33:17] the the the spirit of God in this place
[1:33:19] I don't want the devil to use
[1:33:21] me but I want God to use
[1:33:26] me but all that was part of the
[1:33:29] restoration you know a few weeks ago I

[1:34:24] amen praise the
[1:34:26] Lord amen y'all just get ready get
[1:34:37] ready brother Randon makes a statement
[1:34:39] in the sermon the restoration of the
[1:34:41] Bride
[1:34:42] tree
[1:34:43] says to restore means to bring
[1:34:48] back I just told you things that have
[1:34:51] been lost they coming back but to
[1:34:53] restore means to bring back now you
[1:34:56] can't call it a restoration if nothing
[1:34:58] don't come
[1:35:02] back but if God gave us that thing for
[1:35:04] the year then we got to see restoration
[1:35:06] all around us Amen to restore means to
[1:35:10] bring back to restore a claim can be
[1:35:15] enforced now
[1:35:21] right to bring back to bring anything
[1:35:24] back to its rightful owner where it
[1:35:27] belongs therefore some way it went away
[1:35:30] from its rightful owner and look at this
[1:35:33] now can wander
[1:35:35] around anywhere now y'all know this this
[1:35:39] the prophet telling the truth you keep
[1:35:42] up with people on social media they
[1:35:44] leave the message and can't find nowhere
[1:35:47] to settle their
[1:35:49] feet they in this church this month then
[1:35:52] they in that church the next month and
[1:35:55] then they they wander over here and then
[1:35:57] they wander over there can never find
[1:36:00] any
[1:36:01] satisfaction amen good God Almighty amen
[1:36:04] because the message brings you
[1:36:06] satisfaction yes right
[1:36:09] amen the the revealed word is what
[1:36:11] brings you to satisfaction amen right it
[1:36:14] says but they can wander around
[1:36:17] anywhere but to
[1:36:19] restore is to bring it back to who it
[1:36:22] really who really owns it amen or to
[1:36:26] bring it back to its natural estate
[1:36:28] where it was at the first time bring it
[1:36:31] back into its natural condition in order
[1:36:33] to do this now in order for the
[1:36:35] restoration to happen in order to do
[1:36:38] this we have a right to
[1:36:46] enforce let me go a little further with
[1:36:49] this cuz that word enforc y'all going
[1:36:51] y'all going to need to use that one
[1:36:52] that's that's got to become part of your
[1:36:54] your
[1:36:55] prayer oh my my I'm here to
[1:36:59] enforce my
[1:37:02] claim when I'm on my knees and praying
[1:37:04] I'm here to enforce my claim sir hallu
[1:37:09] hallelujah look at this
[1:37:12] now he says um uh uh we have a right to
[1:37:16] enforce it if there's a law to enforce
[1:37:18] this rightful condition of restoration
[1:37:21] enforce this right
[1:37:24] rightful condition of restoration that
[1:37:26] means if they're doing something that
[1:37:28] that God did not call them to do the
[1:37:29] devil got them out there doing that
[1:37:31] that's that's not where they belong the
[1:37:32] rightful conditions that they belong
[1:37:34] right here amen amen
[1:37:38] hallelujah oh my God watch it now watch
[1:37:42] it the rightful condition of restoration
[1:37:44] to restore he goes on like if somebody
[1:37:46] stole some property and they're holding
[1:37:49] the property captive then you can take
[1:37:52] the law and go to this person and the
[1:37:55] law
[1:37:56] forces enforces this person to restore
[1:38:00] this property back to his natural owner
[1:38:03] to his first estate
[1:38:06] enforcement now look at what he say he
[1:38:08] says oh what a
[1:38:10] text I like to have two days on that
[1:38:14] inforce and when I thought about I said
[1:38:16] now we going to end up getting two
[1:38:17] sermons out of this I'm going to let you
[1:38:19] know that I'm not going to get through
[1:38:20] all this today but but but this enforc
[1:38:23] me a lot now watch he says enforcement
[1:38:26] oh how what a what a text if I I'd just
[1:38:28] like to have two days on that
[1:38:31] inforce now I want to just give you real
[1:38:34] quick that word
[1:38:38] enforce it's to
[1:38:42] compel um uh compel observance or uh
[1:38:46] compel observance of or compliance with
[1:38:50] I mean we're going to compel observance
[1:38:52] of or compliance ience with and I'll
[1:38:54] just use an example when you when you
[1:38:56] you know in your house you set certain
[1:38:58] rules certain regulations one of those
[1:38:59] regulations we going to go to church in
[1:39:01] this
[1:39:02] house sir and I got to enforce it is my
[1:39:06] house we going to go to
[1:39:09] church in here ain't going to be no
[1:39:13] drinking that's right ain't GNA be no
[1:39:16] smoking not in here hello somebody
[1:39:21] exactly right brother you have to
[1:39:22] enforce certain claims in your own house
[1:39:25] and when when the children I don't care
[1:39:27] how old they are they could be 60 that's
[1:39:31] right in your
[1:39:32] house but if they in your house it's
[1:39:35] still going to be the same rules and you
[1:39:37] going to respect the rules of my house
[1:39:39] if you don't want to respect this house
[1:39:42] go
[1:39:48] get you won't pay you don't pay no
[1:39:50] mortgage you don't pay no rent
[1:39:54] you going to live by the rules of this
[1:40:00] house it's enforced like that sir ain't
[1:40:03] going to be no questions asked amen you
[1:40:07] if you break the rules you might find
[1:40:08] your stuff out on the side of the roads
[1:40:11] and the locks
[1:40:15] change so compel observance or
[1:40:19] compliance with that's
[1:40:21] inforce another one and they they use an
[1:40:23] example that the role of the police is
[1:40:25] to enforce the law amen now another
[1:40:29] definition they give in this word
[1:40:30] enforce it means to cause something to
[1:40:33] happen by
[1:40:35] necessity or by
[1:40:40] force to cause something to happen by
[1:40:44] necessity or by force and remember the
[1:40:47] scripture the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:40:49] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:40:53] it by brother and sister glory to God we
[1:40:59] you know that when you when you're
[1:41:00] taking something by force there is no no
[1:41:03] no
[1:41:04] compromise there is no no no no we're
[1:41:06] not we're not going to sit and talk this
[1:41:08] over no we ain't talking nothing over I
[1:41:11] I I'm claiming my right as a son and as
[1:41:14] a daughter of God and I'm enforcing my
[1:41:17] claim amen I'm taking it by force by
[1:41:20] necessity or Force
[1:41:23] Amen brother random goes on to say this
[1:41:26] in the message the restoration of
[1:41:27] rapture he says
[1:41:29] enforce then says uh we have the

[1:42:54] there with an ox goat and here come
[1:42:55] these Philistine Soldiers with all their
[1:42:57] equipment beat down 600 of them sir I'm
[1:43:01] going tell you something there's an
[1:43:02] anointing that comes upon you when you
[1:43:05] ship
[1:43:08] positions when you when you stop
[1:43:10] operating in fear and jumping back but
[1:43:13] when you say boo back to the devil
[1:43:15] there's an anointing that comes upon you
[1:43:18] the Bible say if you just resist the
[1:43:21] devil
[1:43:24] he'll flee the devil start running if
[1:43:27] you just
[1:43:28] resist I remember my daddy told a little
[1:43:31] fell cuz this fell was trying to
[1:43:32] overcome
[1:43:34] cigarettes and my daddy had overcome it
[1:43:36] by the grace of God smoked for a number
[1:43:39] of years but but when he really came to
[1:43:41] Christ my daddy uh uh defeated the
[1:43:44] cigarette demon and uh and the little
[1:43:46] fellow was asking how did you overcome
[1:43:48] these cigarettes how did you do it my
[1:43:52] dad looked at him say now he says okay
[1:43:54] young man let me just share something
[1:43:56] with you say you know you you bigger
[1:43:59] than me he says but if I was standing
[1:44:02] here and you were standing there and I
[1:44:04] was I was trying to when he asked my dad
[1:44:06] a question I had never heard his
[1:44:07] testimony I wanted to hear how he
[1:44:09] overcome
[1:44:10] it you say you bigger than me say you
[1:44:12] stand there and I stand here say now
[1:44:14] with you being bigger than me you just
[1:44:16] walk over to me and just push
[1:44:19] me he says and most likely you probably
[1:44:22] pushed me down with you been bigger than
[1:44:23] me he says but if I could just put
[1:44:30] up just just a little
[1:44:33] resistance just a little resistance then
[1:44:35] you might not be able to push me over
[1:44:37] that easy and what we need to come up
[1:44:40] with is a strategy not to back up
[1:44:43] but just just plant
[1:44:46] yourself
[1:44:48] amen and once he
[1:44:50] push just push back a little bit
[1:44:53] and here's what the Bible say if you
[1:44:55] just and you ain't got to use all your
[1:44:57] strength don't don't don't hurt yourself
[1:44:59] just a little resistance if you just re
[1:45:02] resist the devil just a little just I'm
[1:45:06] not talking about like this just all
[1:45:08] that just just just a this or just a
[1:45:14] this just just a little something just
[1:45:16] just just if just a little that will
[1:45:20] cause the devil to take off running
[1:45:23] and the prophet told us when the weakest
[1:45:24] Christian hit their knees oh hell begin
[1:45:27] to shake
[1:45:30] yes thank you Lord that thing you going
[1:45:32] through have you prayed about
[1:45:35] it I'm toing about got on your knees and
[1:45:37] prayed about
[1:45:42] it this word is true yes it and all we
[1:45:46] got to do is just follow the word we'll
[1:45:47] see God manifest in our lives let me
[1:45:51] just keep reading here I want we we got
[1:45:53] to enforce some things upon
[1:45:57] Satan we have a privilege to enforce
[1:46:00] upon Satan the claims that God give us
[1:46:02] the next
[1:46:04] paragraph says God has a law and his
[1:46:06] word is a law and God this in in this
[1:46:08] word made certain claims to the church
[1:46:10] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:46:13] claims upon Satan and say give it back
[1:46:16] he has to do it he has to do it no
[1:46:20] choice he has to do it because we can
[1:46:22] take God's agent the Holy Spirit go
[1:46:26] right down on our knees and see this is
[1:46:27] where our power amen comes for us when
[1:46:29] we're on our knees go right down on our
[1:46:32] knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:46:35] he's got to give it up and that's all
[1:46:38] cuz the holy spirit is there to make him
[1:46:40] do it the law of the land is to enforce
[1:46:43] is by the land for the
[1:46:45] land but the law of the spirit of God is
[1:46:48] is to force Satan man I tell you I like
[1:46:52] this the law the spirit of God is to
[1:46:54] force Satan to give up that which he has
[1:46:56] unrightfully
[1:46:58] deceitfully taken from
[1:47:01] God Souls of men he took from God Souls
[1:47:06] of women children sickness of the body
[1:47:09] he placed upon people where God Made
[1:47:12] Them In His Image to be like him and the
[1:47:13] church is given the rightful legal right
[1:47:16] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[1:47:19] Spirit and enforce this upon them take
[1:47:23] it by force
[1:47:25] church now this is
[1:47:27] where brother brandom gives
[1:47:31] us um this going on the offense this is
[1:47:34] where the inspiration comes from this
[1:47:36] next this next quote the and and and
[1:47:41] um what what had
[1:47:43] happened and I I'll just let me just let
[1:47:46] me I'm going just uh I won't read this
[1:47:48] one but what had happened in the next
[1:47:49] part of this quote he's talking about
[1:47:51] the story of uh brother
[1:47:54] Evans brother Evans was a brother he was
[1:47:56] very faithful he would drive roughly 750
[1:47:59] miles one way to go to
[1:48:09] church now most of
[1:48:13] us and especially
[1:48:15] nowadays y'all y'all y'all y'all
[1:48:18] streaming
[1:48:23] brother Evans wasn't thinking about
[1:48:26] streaming brother Evans would get in his
[1:48:28] car with his family and drive 750 miles
[1:48:31] just to get in one Sunday morning
[1:48:34] service turn around and drive 750 miles
[1:48:37] to go back home so he can get to
[1:48:39] work and this man was doing this
[1:48:41] faithfully and and one time he comes to
[1:48:44] church he gets there and you can imagine
[1:48:48] the sacrifice this man made all his
[1:48:50] luggage in the car everything in the car
[1:48:52] and he get the church and out of all the
[1:48:54] cars in the parking
[1:48:56] lot the devil decide to take his
[1:49:02] car brother brother Evans you know a
[1:49:06] little distraught brother Brandon say
[1:49:07] now what he did is he went to the police
[1:49:09] to try to get the police to do something
[1:49:11] about it but they said you know what
[1:49:13] there there's a racket going on in this
[1:49:14] area and what people doing they stealing
[1:49:16] cars redoing the titles and doing all
[1:49:19] kind of stuff and and it's hard for us
[1:49:20] to find these cars now the police might
[1:49:23] not be able to get to
[1:49:25] it but brother Evans knew he had
[1:49:28] something higher than a police
[1:49:30] officer that he could go to and we can
[1:49:32] get this situation solved so the
[1:49:34] brothers was you know uh crying and and
[1:49:37] doing all kind of things and then
[1:49:39] finally they got to brother brandham say
[1:49:40] brother brandham you know brother Evans
[1:49:42] had his car stolen we just feel so sorry
[1:49:44] for the brother and and brother brandham
[1:49:46] said that what they did is that you know
[1:49:48] he just begin to to think about
[1:49:50] scripture
[1:49:53] even before he prayed he began to think
[1:49:56] on certain scriptures glory to God and

[1:52:50] this down the message that we believe
[1:52:53] it came

[1:53:03] couldn't find it in here I wouldn't be
[1:53:04] believing
[1:53:06] it but I I found it here yes sir Malachi
[1:53:10] 4 Revelation 10 St Luke
[1:53:14] 17 uh Matthew
[1:53:18] 11 is all over the Bible sir deuteron
[1:53:24] omy where is that in Deuteronomy Moses
[1:53:27] said the Lord your God going to raise up
[1:53:28] a prophet like unto me
[1:53:31] sir and brother Jack that's Christ it
[1:53:34] is but the Bible has
[1:53:37] duel
[1:53:39] manifestations and the same way God
[1:53:41] Called Moses out to deliver people from
[1:53:43] a desert he called a prophet out today
[1:53:46] to deliver people from a desert
[1:53:48] condition right
[1:53:51] right thank you Lord if you abide in
[1:53:54] me and my words abide in you now this is
[1:53:59] this is important you got to First abide
[1:54:01] in him and then his word got to be
[1:54:03] inside of
[1:54:05] you then and only
[1:54:09] then you shall ask what you will now I'm
[1:54:12] going to tell you why Jesus put it that
[1:54:13] way abide in me and my words abide in
[1:54:15] you if his word is abiding in you you
[1:54:18] won't ask anything outside of his will
[1:54:23] that's well how do you know his will his
[1:54:26] will
[1:54:28] is his
[1:54:32] word and if you don't know the word you
[1:54:35] don't know the
[1:54:37] will
[1:54:40] Lord if you abide in me and my words
[1:54:43] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:54:47] and it shall be done unto you brother
[1:54:49] brandom took this scripture
[1:54:53] and prayed for a brother to receive his
[1:54:56] car
[1:54:59] back they got down on their
[1:55:03] knees father we come you told us if we
[1:55:06] abide in you and your word abide in us
[1:55:08] we can ask what we will and it'll be
[1:55:10] done unto us God we need brother Evans
[1:55:12] car
[1:55:14] back soon as he said amen a vision
[1:55:17] came and he saw the man a backslider had
[1:55:21] stole the man 's car he says your car
[1:55:24] going to be found I think in a city near
[1:55:26] Bowling Green you're going to get
[1:55:27] halfway halfway back here and it's going
[1:55:29] to be found over here it's going to have
[1:55:31] half a tank of gas but everything will
[1:55:33] be in it
[1:55:35] brother the way they went on the offense
[1:55:38] is when he went down on the knees yes
[1:55:42] sir cuz it's so much
[1:55:44] power I said there so much power when a
[1:55:49] Christian goes down on their
[1:55:54] the devil don't know what to do with you
[1:55:55] when you get to that
[1:55:58] position hell just begin to shake and
[1:56:01] you realize the devil be doing
[1:56:03] everything he can he wear you he wear
[1:56:05] your body out all throughout the day at
[1:56:08] work and all kind of other stuff all
[1:56:09] these other activities just where you at
[1:56:11] where you can't hit your
[1:56:14] knees but when you get there good God
[1:56:18] Almighty things begin to change
[1:56:23] brother Brandon went on the offense and
[1:56:25] they begin to cry out and he use that
[1:56:27] scripture if you abide on me my words
[1:56:29] abide on you you can ask what so he
[1:56:30] start asking for that brother's car and
[1:56:32] I just thought to myself I thought to
[1:56:34] myself you mean
[1:56:37] God is that
[1:56:39] concerned about your
[1:56:43] car you know you know your car
[1:56:49] depreciates your your car breaks down
[1:56:52] your car got all kind of problems and
[1:56:54] and eventually you get to a point where
[1:56:55] you just can't drive that car no more
[1:56:58] but God is concerned about it I mean
[1:57:00] he's so concerned that that he had a a
[1:57:02] man come up with an idea to build a car
[1:57:04] that you got he put the seats in a
[1:57:07] certain way and and certain uh uh things
[1:57:10] inside the car that he knew that you
[1:57:11] would enjoy the car was specifically
[1:57:13] designed just for
[1:57:17] you whatever car you want to drive if
[1:57:19] it's a Cadillac if it's a BMW whatever a
[1:57:22] a Chevy a Ford whatever car you want to
[1:57:24] drive it was designed specifically with
[1:57:26] you in mind right God allowed them to do
[1:57:28] that yes
[1:57:31] sir but if God will bring a man's car
[1:57:38] back if you abide in
[1:57:41] me my words abide in you yes Lord you
[1:57:46] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:57:49] unto you I I believe God actually has
[1:57:53] um I I I I say this he probably puts
[1:57:56] more
[1:57:57] value on things that are more
[1:58:02] eternal so if you got a loved
[1:58:06] one that has somehow wandered
[1:58:11] away it's time to go on the
[1:58:14] offense for your loved one when you hit
[1:58:18] your
[1:58:18] knees take take this scripture keep it

[1:58:22] scripture I if you ain't wrote nothing
[1:58:25] down today write this one down take a
[1:58:27] picture of it but this is what you want
[1:58:29] to pray God you told me yes
[1:58:32] sir if I was to abide in you and your
[1:58:36] words were to abide in me that I can ask
[1:58:39] what I will and you
[1:58:42] said oh my God my God ain't no maybe in
[1:58:45] there ain't no
[1:58:47] possibility no no it shall be done unto
[1:58:52] me amen I'm tired of the devil running

[1:59:39] my loved ones and let me tell you
[1:59:42] something when they went on the offense

[2:04:31] I don't know what to do about this I'm
[2:04:35] Lord but God gave him that
[2:04:37] business so he just going through
[2:04:40] and going back and forth to court and
[2:04:43] just realize the case that was against
[2:04:44] him like he just needed God to intervene
[2:04:50] somehow praying
[2:04:52] one day he goes to court and it's it was
[2:04:54] a big big court day while he at court
[2:04:58] his daughter's at
[2:05:00] home the phone
[2:05:02] run daughter picked up the
[2:05:05] phone and
[2:05:09] um she said God bless you said yeah God

[2:05:19] brother Brooks how you doing say you
[2:05:20] know sis I don't I don't know why I'm
[2:05:23] calling but last night I had a
[2:05:26] dream and uh in the dream I saw this man
[2:05:30] and this woman and they were really
[2:05:32] really uh distraught about some things
[2:05:34] they was going through and brother
[2:05:36] brandom came to me in the
[2:05:40] dream and he said uh that family look
[2:05:43] really discouraged don't he he said yeah
[2:05:45] he says okay uh when you wake up call
[2:05:48] this telephone number and tell them

[2:06:06] by obedience called the telephone
[2:06:09] number he called and told the sister the
[2:06:12] dream told her brother brandom told me
[2:06:14] to tell you in the dream it's going to
[2:06:15] be all
[2:06:18] right and you see God had to do that
[2:06:21] that way way you got to understand
[2:06:23] things God had to use the prophet even
[2:06:25] in the dream because he knew Believers
[2:06:27] over here and Believers over there they
[2:06:29] had something in common right there so
[2:06:32] when he used that then it settled their
[2:06:34] spirit and and and and and and and the
[2:06:36] father and the mother come back home
[2:06:37] from court they oh my God we don't know

[2:37:56] amen amen amen
[2:37:59] amen praise the
[2:38:01] Lord when you go on an offense it's a
[2:38:05] mindset it's a mindset brother Jack was
[2:38:07] speaking said he played
[2:38:09] cornerback from the time I was little to
[2:38:12] the time I I graduated I played
[2:38:15] quarterback and as a quarterback you're
[2:38:18] never on a defense
[2:38:20] my first year playing little leag
[2:38:22] football they let me play defense after
[2:38:25] that they never allowed me again when
[2:38:28] you are a
[2:38:29] quarterback your main objective is to
[2:38:33] score you can't stop
[2:38:36] me your mindset is I don't care who you
[2:38:39] put in front of me I'm going to defeat
[2:38:41] this person cuz we have a goal and that
[2:38:43] is to
[2:38:44] finish
[2:38:45] amen my brothers used to tease me a lot
[2:38:48] because as a quarterback back and we
[2:38:50] master that triple option they said Mo
[2:38:53] ain't never going to pitch it he's
[2:38:55] always going to run it so they had to
[2:38:57] root for me but they without us cannot
[2:39:00] be made perfect until we finish so we
[2:39:03] got to March we got to press we got to
[2:39:05] fight we got to finish this race amen we
[2:39:08] got to get on the offense you cannot be
[2:39:10] stopped you're an invincible Army amen
[2:39:14] when you recognize who you
[2:39:17] are Satan's in trouble
[2:39:21] amen God Bless You
[2:39:23] Soldiers god bless
[2:39:26] you
[2:39:27] Hallelujah I'm so grateful I could be
[2:39:30] fighting with you amen God saw something
[2:39:33] in each one of you that he put you at
[2:39:35] the end right at Satan's Eden when Satan
[2:39:38] had mastered everything he had he had
[2:39:41] confidence that you would overcome amen
[2:39:44] let's bow our heads almighty god father
[2:39:47] we thank you for your visitation this
[2:39:49] morning Lord whenever you come on a
[2:39:52] scene it's never in vain father God you
[2:39:55] put your people on the office this day
[2:39:57] Lord Jesus the word was preached a
[2:40:00] mindset was created and then right here
[2:40:02] at the end of the service Lord you put
[2:40:04] your soldiers Lord the men of God that
[2:40:06] come and stand behind the sacred desk
[2:40:08] you allow them all to come forth and get
[2:40:10] on the offense to pray for your
[2:40:12] believing children Lord because of the
[2:40:14] needs and the afflictions that the enemy
[2:40:17] tries to put on your people but father
[2:40:19] God he can't stand before the weakest of
[2:40:21] us Lord Jesus you have given us some
[2:40:24] something to fight with so father as we
[2:40:26] go throughout this week May we as the
[2:40:28] Sons and Daughters of God recognize this
[2:40:30] is the hour for the manifestation of the
[2:40:32] sons of God lord you have given us your
[2:40:35] word to live by now we must speak oh
[2:40:38] Father we want to March forward
[2:40:40] according to your will according to your
[2:40:41] word so I pray almighty God that you
[2:40:44] would anoint every vessel Lord God to
[2:40:46] move forward in you oh Lord Jesus May
[2:40:49] Satan Lord not get the upper hand in any
[2:40:51] place oh Father I believe it one of the
[2:40:54] prophets Isaiah Ezekiel one of them said
[2:40:56] when we finally see Satan we'll look at
[2:40:59] him with narrow eyes and say is this the
[2:41:01] man this little bitty Old Devil is this
[2:41:04] the
[2:41:05] man that destroyed kingdoms overcame
[2:41:09] them but father God we are the ones that
[2:41:11] say boo and he gets smaller we are
[2:41:14] victorious Lord with the word father so
[2:41:17] may this word continually be in our our
[2:41:19] hearts in our minds as we meditate on it
[2:41:22] upon our lips Lord Jesus that Victory
[2:41:24] Lord may be won in Jesus Christ name we
[2:41:27] ask that you go before us as we leave
[2:41:29] this place Lord bring us back at the
[2:41:30] appointed time father bring energy and
[2:41:33] strength back to your servant restore it
[2:41:35] to him Lord Jesus we pray we thank you
[2:41:37] for this hour of restoration it's in
[2:41:39] Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen amen
[2:41:43] God bless you you may have your seats
[2:41:44] and our brothers will come dis dismiss
[2:41:46] you at this time God bless you
