come back I say all right you keep on coming God is good amen I'm going back to a scripture from last week um Romans 12 and and while we're just getting that I got a quick call yesterday from Brother um uh Marcus he lives there in Port St Lucie and um he was just telling me that he had a situation where he got a ticket and he was you know he said he know he was wrong because he was driving with the speed of traffic and he said he never really had never gotten a ticket before and uh he says this will affect my job and since I really need to get this kind of thrown out some kind of way and he just began to pray over it and he says um I felt they had to go talk to there was a police officer that lives in my neighborhood so I went to talk to him and explain to my situation and say look I know I'm guilty I'm not trying to get out of exit but I just can't take those points if you can just help me some kind of way just help me navigate this so he said let me talk to the guy that wrote you the ticket and um and so it waited a couple days and he had never gotten with him he says I tell you what to do what you need to do is ask for an extension on it it says because when you get the extension uh that guy won't even be around to show up to go to court so it'll be thrown out and you won't have uh you won't have to worry about that he said well that's what I was praying that I wouldn't have to get no no no no points on my life cases and I just need it I I need to keep my job I don't need to lose my job he said so God he said God answered my prayer and Pastor I just want to put in a praise report so I say well praise the Lord I see what God is good amen and I want to solicit your prayers for brother um Pastor Lewis out of Jamaica he lost his mother this week and um in Miami she passed away and he called me this morning actually called me a couple days ago and told me about it and reminded me this morning uh to just you know have the search the church pray for his family and on next next um uh Saturday they'll be doing the funeral service down in Miami and he asked me to to actually preach the services so keep me in prayer uh that God will just help us as we navigate uh that and that God would just give strength to this family amen let's read quickly out of Romans 12 we read this on last week and um tell you this morning brother uh Simba kind of shared a little something just might just blessed our heart um talking about the three churches that he's been a part of and and the different words for each church one church had the word of Miracles for the year now the church had the word of growth for the year and it says in this church came up with um yielding to the perfect will of God it says I'm gonna get Miracles I got to yield if I'm going to get growth I got to you amen so we just thank the Lord for for that amen I'm expecting all of that amen so Romans 12 verse 1 and 2 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amellus bow and a brief word of prayer father we thank you o God for uh all that has happened thus far in the service and we thank you for allowing us to be able to gather I want to remember brother uh Robles who called and said Lord it just wasn't feeling his best the medications Lord are just kind of um just creating a few issues for him so Lord we pray that you would touch our brother we know that he's watched online God remember him right where he is right now and Lord made healing virtue begin to flow from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet and and father we just claim victory for our brother even right now in the midst of all of this and Lord we want to remember our precious brother Lewis who has lost his mother the family there God going through this time of suffering trust that you would give them strength and comfort Lord and even as we would go to try to present a sermon to that family give us the right words that we could say that would be encouragement and strength and maybe call somebody to come closer to to Christ so father our prayers that you would use this in a mighty way thank you for all those things that have gathered here today those that are not with us Lord look upon them those that are online bless them take control of the word of God as it goes forth to your people today speak to our hearts for we need to hear from you it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated Amen in the house of the Lord amen um I want it to continue where we were last week and I want to just kind of uh start by making a a statement here one of the things that the Lord kind of put in my spirit uh uh for this year was to to be practical amen last week we kind of started that a man uh last year I should say especially coming through the book of Ephesians uh practical teaching practical teaching uh very very important you know um like you know like I told you all um I I have to teach on Wednesday mornings and even I talk this morning going through the Book of Revelations and we get into some really deep things you know when it comes to that and and I'm grateful that we get a chance to do that and I've taken this church through the Book of Revelations I've taken you know through the church ages and just a number of things that we've looked into but uh but what the Lord has been rest of my spirit is practical things and I think our brother Stephen came on Wednesday night and he said we need to get back to the basics say brother ain't nothing but the truth because you know you can preach up here and people living here amen all right and and we don't want this just for head knowledge we want this to produce change in our life right it has to have an impact in our life if it's not having an impact in our life uh what good is to have it in your head hello somebody you know what good is for you to read the Bible but not follow the Bible amen and there's many people that I read the Bible but are you following the Bible are you living the Bible right because evidently I can tell you you read it but you read right over the top of some of these things you need to go back and read it again and now let it get deposited into your spirit to you and the word become one amen all right and you know last week I brought to you all just a few things and and I mentioned in the sermon it was something that I wanted to uh Circle back around and do and I'm going to do that today it's going to be very very practical uh so you know I trust that you'll get something out of it and uh and we'll just get started in a channel then I'm gonna kind of change a little gear but I'm just gonna talk to y'all this morning if that's all right amen I'ma just talk like a pastor I'm not an evangelist I'm a pastor so I'm gonna talk like a pastor I mentioned last week the church is cooling off I read you a quote on that the church is cooling off and and when we use the term cooling off I want to uh just just uh go a little deeper in that the things that used to bring conviction are now becoming acceptable the things that used to bring conviction are now becoming acceptable and I want to just make mention it might be acceptable to society and in some instances it might be acceptable to you but it's still not acceptable to God praise the Lord amen we know that there are two wheels we talked about that last last week There's a permissive will of God and there's a perfect will of God and and our objective is not to dwell or not to live in the permissive will of God our objective in life is to live in the perfect will of God Amen he put you on the earth with a purpose amen praise God if you didn't have purpose you wouldn't be here amen but God put you here on this Earth because he has a he has a purpose and he wants you to walk in that perfect Divine Purpose that he has for you and we talked about this um uh uh yielding you know we're talking about yielding to the perfect will of God this is part two to that and uh yielding requires Letting Go amen and allowing your heavenly father to to put you where he wants you to be um it allows you to yield and allow I mean allowing him to put you into amen into the position that he wants you to be in this is what he had in his mind for you at the beginning amen before the before the beginning of the world before the foundation he had certain things in his mind certain qualities that he placed in you and you got to be able to yield to his perfect will so those qualities can be expressed oh hallelujah amen uh and and I want to also just reiterate this you know I was I was uh talking to somebody on yesterday and they were asking me say well they were talking about sports and you know just I guess uh I don't even know what it was I think it was the playoffs the football playoffs are getting to happen down there who you got Jack who you got it was actually who you got see actually I ain't got nobody I said I ain't got none of them none of them so who your favorite team would say I don't I don't I don't have one what no I don't have one and see the reason I don't have one because I'm trying not to follow it that close uh where I need to have a favorite because see that all that did just generate conversation that ain't meaningful oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me I'm gonna take my jacket away and and I'm gonna be practical amen but I said no I don't I don't have a favorite team I say I'm gonna be honest with you see uh I am actually trying to uh uh uh pull back more from Sports I'ma say that again I am trying to pull back from Sports hey man I don't want to follow it that close I'm going to tell you something um ain't gonna be no Sports in heaven hello somebody uh all them things that we just look Netflix won't be in heaven pure flicks it won't be in heaven hello somebody what else y'all like what else y'all YouTube it won't be in heaven social media and I can I can guarantee you right now you will not be in heaven posting up can you imagine yourself being in heaven like that praise the Lord so if you're gonna live like that there why don't you start living like that here practical all right amen but but but you know you know a lot of these things that that that we get involved with I want to tell you right now it's not sin right it's not sin it's not sin I won't call it sin amen but it is a weight and what the Bible actually tells us that is to lay aside every sin and every weight that's so easily besets us YouTube easily percepts us come on somebody amen uh following I mean uh when you get on Instagram or somebody's story you go from one story to the next door to me it just easily besets you hello you ain't spend the time with God that you said you was gonna spin and sit down in a football game and watching for three hours how much time do you spend in prayer amen and can't wait to get to a football game hello somebody amen these things these things are are awaits so what I'm trying to do is get rid of my weight that's what yielding to the perfect will of God is all about get rid of some of these weights sir all right all right amen thank you thank you I get one or two amens that's I I don't really need that many to preach but because I got an amen on the inside of me I will amen myself all right I want to read just a little something here a couple couple of statements amen uh one from this message the seven Church ages um and then I'm gonna read from questions and answers part two just a couple things and then we will get started in something here this and the Seven Church ages the prophet says this and this is 1954 that he's making these statements it says no matter how saintly you are it says there's no matter how saintly you are how Godly you are how much of a minister or lay member whatever you are he says you'll never be able to get anywhere with God till you get in the spirit you'll never be able to get anywhere with God until you get in the spirit say that's right I don't mean get in Emotion right right Hallelujah I mean get in the spirit see see you get an emotion to anything but when you get in the spirit I like this when you get in the spirit you see things that's right and and this is what we're trying to get to a spot where we can see things I was telling y'all last week how brother brother Billy Parker see things and he could have fellowship with his daddy till his daddy would make a statement that his ministry can be greater than my Ministry it's because he could see things Oh Glory to God the church ought to be at a spot now where it can see things spiritual things let's stay with it let's stay with it let's stay with it amen I want to read from questions and answers uh part two amen number two glory to God here is a statement from the prophet and as I'm going through this particular quote I think you're going to be able to see some of the things that he's talking about he says and I believe my brother sister I say this with Godly respect and with a fear of God in my heart I believe America's sunk it says she's demoralized she's gone low to stooping it's a Pity it goes forward he says just think here as I say in answering this scripture seven women grab a hold of one man now that's the Bible in the first four first world war he says the Second World War I got a clipping at home out of the newspaper you read it yourself said what happened to the morals of our American women two out of three soldiers was divorced by their wives that went overseas in the first six months look at this two out of three was divorced these women just took off and run out why is it if you understand friends it's the spirit of time he says we've got to get it we got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here you go to a dance hall you go you've got to get in the spirit of dancing amen or they or or they won't dance you go to the church you got to get in this in in the spirit of worship before you can worship that the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come look at this and we're in the spirit of the last days and God's promise that these things would be here and that's what we've got where in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it I'm trying to wake

it be in the coming of the son of man and all you got to do is go back and read your Bible to see what happened in the days of lot amen homosexuality was out of control so far out of control that angels from Heaven came to Earth and the man in that City want to get to know angels it was perversion it was sick it was wickedness all over that and you tell me we don't see that in the land today praise the Lord Everything Jesus said is happening but what about the church are we in the spirit of the coming of the Lord are we getting ready are we getting closer to God or further from God let's go on a little further here it says in the morals I met a young boy here the other day over uh some time ago the last fall and we were coming into the city and he was telling me a young high school boy that was married he said I married this girl because she was a good girl and had to marry her before she completed High School said we haven't had one turned out a virgin as far as I know in high school for years around here she just so demoralized actually you get picked up for being a virgin nowadays actually God honors you right and let me tell you something here you know uh when when it was time for Christ to be born on the Earth they couldn't go find a woman that had been been with every boy in the school the Angels looking for a virgin Hallelujah and he's still looking for Virgin Hearts today amen that will yield themselves to the word of God and allow Christ to be expressed all over again look at what he says so so just tomorrow look in Paris don't be a uh don't be ashamed of of helping your your children keep themselves until they get married don't be ashamed to talk to them about keeping themselves until they get married don't share yourself with everybody like that keep yourself I don't care what your your so-and-so doing you keep yourself until you get married and that's boy and girl young man you keep yourself until you get married young girl you keep yourself until you get married amen it'll save you a lot of headaches down the road amen glory to God you ain't got you got to show yourself with everybody amen just because your friends in school doing it and when you go out there and do it next thing you come back with a disease amen don't don't follow it follow the word of God amen the Bible Bob actually tell us to flee fornication it actually say run from it you don't sit there and talk with fornication you don't sit there and play with it hello somebody you don't sit there and communicate with fornication you run from fornication all right some young man trying to talk to you and and they start easing some of that that language that you know he don't mean no good amen tell them you believe you got to put a ring on it before you get anywhere and he ain't got no job you didn't get you you can't put no ring nowhere hello somebody and if he ain't a Christian you shouldn't be talking to him in the first place well I think I can no you ain't gonna you ain't gonna win them you ain't gonna win them he gonna win you all right hello practical teaching look at this now look at what happened here it says uh just so demoralizing down in California I went through the streets this is 1954 he's saying this I went through the streets in a place where the policeman would tell you to keep off the street police been telling the prophet don't walk the street keep up the street there's more danger for a man to pass through the street then it would be a woman this is in California in 1954. now that is Sodom conditions if it's there it's dangerous for a man to walk the street more dangerous for a man to go through the street than it is for a woman think about it he said there's there's more danger for a man to pass through the street than it would be a woman dark Alice oh God have mercy don't you know the Bible said those things would come he says and just before you give the shadow of an in Sodom Gomorrah went down there the same thing took place uh taking place rather than God sent fire down and burnt the place up a very signpost to show that the world over when it comes to that place will receive the things so you know they're gonna they got destruction in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah destruction will be coming again amen it's gonna be uh this this world going to be baptized on fire amen listen here uh we asked you to just stop for a moment last week and just ask God lord show me something I can lay aside this year that would allow me to draw closer to you and I want to encourage you to continue to do that I mentioned something on last last week about you know um I was reading an article recently and uh in this article it talked about 10 online sins that we are apparently okay with and this was written by a man by the name of Aaron Berry and um and I was just uh you know as I was reading it I said you know wait a minute let me just kind of you know look at what this guy's saying here and uh you know I'm gonna read to you all some of the things he said and I was I'm not gonna rush through this I'm gonna just say some of the things that he said and then we're going to bring some scriptures so y'all get your Bible where we gonna read a lot today we're gonna read a lot a lot amen this is just practical teaching I know you you know maybe you picked up your Bob maybe you forgot the Bible said that so we're gonna remind you what the Bible say we Christians right we follow the Bible right hello somebody the way the reason I dress the way I dress because it's in the Bible the reason I look the way I look is because it's in the Bible and I'm we're not a church that that look at the Old Testament say it's just law so we don't follow no more so okay it was just long so that means people should you know not follow the ten commandments what was that was that the words that God gave to Israel in the form of the Ten Commandments was that a good word for every age thou should not kill is that good enough for every age thou said not steal thou should not commit adultery are those words good enough for every generation anytime somebody comes to her is that a good enough word to live by so we can't pick and choose what scriptures we're going to follow and which ones we're not going to follow from Genesis to revelation we believe it [Applause] not just believe it I'm trying to live it from Genesis Genesis 1 to revelation 22 I'm trying to live it all right this man says these 10 online sins that we are apparently okay with and the first one that he put online and when we talk about you know maybe there's something that you can give up I'm just suggesting I told you it's not a sin but it could be a weight yeah suggestions watch this Indulgence and he made a statement he said should we really be bragging about how much we binge on Netflix it says if we didn't have the reassurance that literally everybody else does it we probably would be ashamed to admit it so we might as well say I have no self-control and my priorities are way out of whack when you indulging right and there's a there's a there's a um uh a scripture here a man uh second Peter one let's just read it brother Steve walked right in and read this on Wednesday night so I'll pick it up again and and we'll just continue to Second Peter one we'll talk about Indulgence hallelujah what does the bible tell us about these things second Peter 1 verse 4 it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust listen and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith uh virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance amen see when you when you got Temperance that means you got self-control you don't indulge hello somebody amen this is if we talk about the character of Christ be informed Dennis Right add to your knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godless brother countenance and brother count as Charity for if these things be in you glory to God and not just for one day not just for one post glory to God Amen be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful Amen in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ I've just listened to something this week and you know I ain't even I didn't catch this till now but a brother was teaching on the line he says you know um when we when we get the spirit of God in us it makes us neither Barren nor unfruitful he says now notice that um in the in in the beginning there was two trees a tree of knowledge good and evil amen and also this tree of life and and Eve decided to eat from the Tree of knowledge good and evil amen and and spiritually spiritually she became barren but when we take on the character of Christ no longer are we Barren and unfruitful amen now we can we can yield fruit to to to his service but it's only when we take on the character of Christ hello somebody for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off can I just tell you right now sometimes you know when we can go back and look at lot he made a decision that I'm going to go down here and start them he couldn't see it far off he didn't realize later on Sodom was going to be destroyed hello but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see it far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins I love that when we talked about Temperance and you know again this guy's talking about Indulgence uh the opposite is to be temperate right uh uh and and brother Brandon when he talks about Temperance and the statue of a perfect man we just read the scripture that he preached from he said this about Temperance says Crown my soul with self-control I wanna I wanna I wanna encourage you let God Crown your soul with self-control even as you're going through a man's social media here's another one that the guy said amen that is a sin that he just saw their materialism and he says the more attention you give to materialism the less attention you give to Eternity can I say that again the more attention you give to materialism the less attention you give to Eternity sometimes you can tell whether you're involved in materialism is a Amazon box showing up at your house daily them people know you by name do you really need that much stuff Hallelujah are you here sister so and so God where'd you get that from I'm gonna get me one material you ain't even got the money to get it someone's borrowing money to get it materialism y'all ain't gonna talk to me today but I'ma still say it anyway Matthew 6 19 and 20. let's look at what the Bible says Matthew 6 19 and 20. hello somebody Jesus says lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and Russ Dove corrupt you don't even have room in your closet to put that stuff lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth hello somebody Y'all Gonna Make me talk to y'all today and some are so so so uh uh so stuck up we won't even wear one outfit twice come on somebody I mean we we got to have something fresh something new you know you can't even wear the same outfit twice something wrong with you hello somebody amen materialism that's what that is that's a spirit on you amen glory to God Hallelujah I mean you're gonna wear it once and do what with it no no no no no no no no I mean look I got shoes like brother brother Troy told her brother he said he said they have shoes um that's been on my feet longer longer than you've been born I like that lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon Earth where moth and Russ doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust of corrupt and where thieves do not break through or steal and I just thought about you know you see all the stuff Amazon packages getting picked up taking off people's front door taken from I mean you but but see our Treasures in that and we get upset when somebody take it away I I I remember a time brother Branham lost a suitcase had all his belongings in the suitcase and um and he was going through a neighborhood somehow they left the suitcase on top of the car and uh and it fell off and and as they were going through and they got to somewhere it's like oh I realized I ain't got my suitcase he said and that the brother say brother that that neighborhood that we drove through I can almost guarantee you ain't gonna get your suitcase back brother random say you know it's okay maybe they need it more than I need it I wonder if y'all could say that by some of y'all Amazon packages maybe they needed it more than I needed come on come on [Music] I wonder if we can have that type of attitude maybe they needed it more than I need it so let them have it but we just get fire upset checking out checking our rings and and everything like who who took it I'm going to get them get my package see if you didn't have that many packages coming they wouldn't know you was caught up in all that see they can't break through and still if you got Treasures in Heaven but the things that we're doing here on the earth is only here for the Earth all the stuff we get involved with here on Earth is only for the Earth but what we're trying to do is get you connected to something that's eternal can I keep going the third one is pride a sin that's committed on social media has just become acceptable Pride this is what the guy said he said social media is a great place to subtly brag about your accomplishments recently you know we we had a couple opportunities we and and when I read this it just really got me thinking like oh Lord I don't want to be bragging you know I I want to show people what's going on but I don't want to be bragging well we had we did the uh the the the giveaway for Thanksgiving and uh when we did that giveaway for Thanksgiving we posted on social media account and somebody from the Palm Beach Post sent us a message and say send us this video to the Palm Beach Post we want to promote you now you know what I said no that's not why we're doing it right that's not what we're doing it we don't we don't want the Palm Beach Post promoting us so they they follow they troll us they follow us so we put another thing out there uh you know that one with the turkey then the next one was when we did the Christmas cards we just put just two or three pictures they sent us another uh send us this to this this uh forward to this uh this account and we'll post it for you that's not why we are doing it that's not why we're doing so I ain't said nothing to nobody praise the Lord social media is a great place to subtly brag about your accomplishments when you post something online ask yourself if you're being if you're bringing unnecessary attention to yourself or if you're hoping to elicit comments that feed your ego this what this what this guy's saying hello somebody right he says uh to God pride is one of the ugliest sins because it seeks to receive the glory that he alone deserves amen social media provides you with an exciting opportunity to spread God's Fame to a huge audience don't try to steal the spotlight Proverbs 16 18. let's just see if these things in the Bible what'd that say Pride God Before Destruction and look at this in our heart is spirit before fall you know what our Holy Spirit does when a sermon like this come out you get a holy spirit he can't tell me huh yeah all right okay all right you go on with your Holy Spirit get and get ready for your fall number four slander a sand on social media that just becomes so acceptable this this fella says the greatest revealer of our hearts are the words we say and that includes the ones we type if we only knew the pain that one slander's work can cause if we only knew what trials people are already facing before we start verbally tearing them down we would think twice about spewing Venom online he says this use your words to heal and to strengthen not to test somebody down use your words to heal and to strengthen can we just read a few scriptures on slander Matthew 12 36. Matthew 12 36 you got to watch what you say what you post just because everybody else posted don't mean you can Matthew 12 36 but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment Psalms 101 and 5. who so privily slanderth his neighbor him will I cut off him that hath in the high look and a proud heart will not I suffer God don't want to have nothing to do with you James 4 11. you're talking about slender here it is speak not evil one of another and I like what he said this speaking of either one of another look at the comma brethren anybody in the church you should not be online trying to tear down a brother or sister in Christ speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judges the law but if thou judge the law Thou Art not adore the law but a judge land is something that we want to avoid and see I'm gonna tell you something you know as we as we yield into the the perfect will of God we might have to pull back from some of this stuff maybe you following too many people yeah folk that influence you with to do the wrong things maybe you need to unfollow them and then they're going to get on you know they're gonna call you a DM you uh why you don't follow me because I wanted to I wanted to and you know what people actually get anxiety they get they get you know who who they want to know who following and who why did they stop following why they not we're not supposed to live like that hello somebody I got another one number five online quarreling quarreling this is what this fella says Aaron says this winning an online argument might make you feel wise but the Bible says you might be broadcasting your own foolishness and this is this is this ain't none of the truth but when this fella said this I I had to agree with him and uh you know I I have seen where people intentionally put certain posts out in order to generate an argument and they love arguing and sometimes I be right with that phone in my hand and my finger bee and then I say and I'm gonna tell you where the Spirit came from when I read it if I would have never read it I would have never thought nothing about it but just by reading it an anointing comes on me and I and I just I got to say something and God don't want us acting like that especially with our own brothers and sisters you know if they if they bring it to you then what I mean by bringing to you like at your house or something you got a right to say something but you know if even somebody put something on your page well you shouldn't have put it on my page you shouldn't have put it you know you still have a the ability if it's on your page you can delete it you ain't got to respond to it but I know there are certain people that they all they want to do is quarrel and they intentionally put things out there to see how people are going to go back and forth on it y'all know it's the truth and what it is it's a trap that they setting for you I've seen it happen to a brother recently I you know looked at looking at all the comments and and this fella um he put something out knew it was going to create a little a little controversy and then one guy came fine back at him firing back and then he's fired back at the guy and they just going back and forth quarreling quarreling you know just going back and next thing you know before he knew it he done what he was arguing was gone and he was saying exactly what that guy was saying that guy has weakened him in the argument see the word of God not supposed to be argued over the word of God just supposed to be live if you don't see it you just can't see it but I'm not going to sit and argue with you about this amen only God can give you this the the the the the the ability to see and then he tell didn't he tell uh Peter say flesh and blood have not revealed these things unto you but my Father in Heaven has so God got to be one to give Revelation I'm not going to go back and forth with you on social media about that quarreling is of the devil he says this do you know what takes far greater wisdom walking from a fight without saying a word it says most online debates are pointless because all the wise voices are the ones refraining from getting involved when you hoping that somebody say something about the wise people they don't even say nothing it's okay I'm gonna just put it in layman's terms it's just fools going back and forth yeah I said brother Jack Don't Call Him a fool I'ma call them what the Bible say look at this in Proverbs 20 and 3. Proverbs 20 and 3. I'm just read what the Bible it is an honor for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be medley fools metal wise people take the honorable way and don't say nothing but I'm gonna tell you after you read it it's still getting your spirit that you might not say nothing online but you're going to say something to everybody around you I was reading this and obviously if you weren't reading it if you weren't reading it you wouldn't have to meddle right come on brother Titus three and two we talk about Coraline Titus three and two to speak evil of no man to be no Brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men we don't get online with quorum we're Christians I'm going further number six another online sin that just becomes so acceptable he called it vanity and y'all gonna sit here and act like that ain't the truth this fella just said the truth Vanity now I don't know I don't know because first thing we say is he a message believer uh I don't know but are you Mr believer because you should be living this about hello vanity this man say selfies selfies everywhere he said you have to admit we overdo it sometimes bathroom mirror selfies inside my car selfie at

pretty today selfie I feel pretty this outfit I just got from sin I feel pretty today let me take me a selfie we dressed a lot today let's take another selfie yeah I remember the truth we ain't took this many pictures all our life used to be they only took family pictures once a year y'all ain't gonna talk to me yeah it's it's practical preaching he said it just just felt pretty today selfie does your Instagram document your life or your face he said there's nothing wrong with taking a nice picture of yourself but social media can easily become an outlet for your own vanity come on brother second Timothy chapter three verse 1. this no also that in the last days perilous times shall come in those dangerous times dangerous but now when we go to the next verse it's still talking about the last days and something else supposed to happen in the last days this is prophecy in chapter chapter 3 verse 2 says for men shall be lovers of Their Own and the word selfie just came out in the last days that one that one that wasn't a thing in the days of Paul he didn't write about selfies it wasn't even a damn brother Brandon's day but it's a it's a thing today for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters so you're boasting uh Indulgence all that uh both is proud we talked about Pride blasphemous disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy the way you dress is Unholy amen without natural affection truth Breakers false accuses us incontinent Fierce ready to fight despise us of those that are good Lord have mercy Jesus I used to tell my daughters this and I'm gonna tell you all this as a church well I just tell my daughters everybody ain't happy to see you succeed all right and I'm gonna tell y'all that at Spirit and truth tablet everybody ain't happy about seeing your business succeed everybody ain't happy about seeing you blessed and as you post some stuff out there people looking for a way that they can scheme against you amen I I remember brother one time I asked him he had a business and um you know he was you know doing okay in the business I asked him say I say how many customers you got I said oh brother oh brother let's see I said why you say brother I don't count my customers what you mean you don't count your customers they say whatever God sent me I just take but I don't count them he says he says because David one time counted his army and he got in trouble with God having a former Godless but denying the power thereofs from such from such from such a Mr verse give me I go back to four Traders Hattie uh oh look at that one high minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God see we're trying to get to the perfect will of God I want to love God more than I love anything in this world anything I don't need nothing I mean nothing holding me back all the things this world are temporal let me tell you something you know we you know uh when I was younger I played football and all of that I played basketball did all that but you know what it's temporal as I got older I couldn't do that no more amen ain't nothing on this Earth is is that that we can adjoin ourselves to if something's going to take us into heaven nothing nothing I want to put God first now I'm gonna tell you another thing there was a time and and especially my day you never took a sport event over Church let me say that again never take a sporting event over Church you always put that sporting event in its place I mean that why you think the NFL uh uh put it out on Sunday NBA put it out on Sunday why do you think and and I love my sister was telling me so you know when you look at some of these uh stadiums and and especially some of the basketball when you look at it looked like a really large Temple and everybody going there to praise hands up all kind of stuff going on inside of there you all know it's the truth it looked like a big Temple everybody walking into the temple to worship the ball going in the hoop or the pigs getting going across the Gold Line we get so much excitement out of somebody that's going to touchdown but sit here in church like I ain't preaching nothing told y'all last week the Lord told me that some of y'all give a man intellectual amens we just say that we just say that but I don't really mean it sometimes you give it from your heart other time it's just intellectual I'ma still keep preaching Traders handy High minded love is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power from such turn away now that's something you got to do yeah amen for of this sort are they which creep into houses why y'all creeping in I want to tell you who they going after too come on brother when they creep into the house who they going after they lead captive silly women and these women ain't just silly these women also have problems they Laden with sins and led away with divers lust you know I know sisters have problems sometimes it just don't come out like that but they have problems up just recently I saw this little post on next door can I just say see these things so I was on next door it was a lady driving I mean writing she say uh to all my sisters out there she said if y'all don't mind tell your husband to keep on his clothes when he running down the street because she say because you know we about to get an accidents out here looking at these men running down running down the street they let you know what's really in a woman that's right lust so I'm looking at this man running down the street and he's I'm about to get an accident so tell your husband put on clothes I'm like well wow she's saying put on clothes I say put on clothes because it's holy and don't just tell don't just tell the the the husbands but don't tell everybody put on your clothes you know you know it was only a Madman in the Bible that took off his clothes but when he was clothed and in his right mind he put on clothes oh my you young people y'all going to school just let me just let you know you're in the midst of demons and don't don't you be trying to Aspire to be like a demon for this sort of they was creeping the houses lead Capital silly women late with sins LED away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth doing all that Bible reading but still can't walk in truth now it's Janice and Jammers with stood Moses so these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they should proceed no further for their father shall be made manifesting to all men as theirs also was let me read a quote uh with this one here I want to read from questions and answers on Genesis amen this is this Vanity Vanity we got to fight this one look at what the prophet says here it says now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we are returning back to that image I like that statement we are returning back to the image of the first man so that's right to our first created image we're returning back he says when God created me William Branham I was before the foundational world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but I was there he says oh I don't believe you're getting it but now just just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me Orman Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began he says and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit a part of these Angelic beings spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven it says and two-thirds of the earth is in sin and more than that which two-thirds of the Angels was kicked out and those demon spirits come into the people and habitate their body see what I mean they're demons that they once they were they was once existed and they come into the people and give them a nature Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene Pride boast big people you see unclean filthy vulgarity emulations Strife all these things see it says there were spirits that was made up back there when God began to make man off of off of there in his own image created those supernatural beings those Spirits so that's why I was telling young people you don't follow the influence of a demon even in the music that people choose to listen to they're influenced by demons can I go a little further some of the Christian music that we listen to influenced by demons demons impersonating Christians [Music] Donnie McClurkin just revealed it all yeah he he put a statement out they said they go to these these stellars and whatever the what what the one that they try to Dove Awards and all that he said they're going to get their Awards and talk about giving glory to God in the back room they drinking and smoking and cursing and everything else demons impersonating Christians we want we want Holy Ghost feels sanctified people that are yielding their gifts yielding the oil to God we want to say nay songs I'm still still pressing my battle I know I know that song is something they're not going home to drink I got three more discontentment that's saying that's online discontentment and this is what Aaron says this is no matter how good you have it it's so easy to think everyone else's life is better than yours and the internet is here to make that possible and I I want I want to just pause there sometimes you see some online somebody just got blessed with a house somebody just said oh wow that meant that many bedrooms wow you know they blessed well you know the state that they live in or the city they live in it's a lot the the the the the cost of living is a lot cheaper and let me tell you something hello my apartment is just as blessed as they as they 10 bedroom house I'm not going to be discontented and and now I start lusting after what they got now covetousness is coming out of me and I'm working I'm working like I don't know what to try to get all this what they got you you might not be able to get all that living here in Palm Beach and now the devil stop telling I got to move I got the move you ain't got to go nowhere I I I I learned this a long time ago I'ma just share this with you God told me this because I thought one time in order to be blessed I'm gonna have to leave West Palm Beach that's what I I thought I had to do it so I'm gonna have to go to here and I have to go there but everywhere I was going gonna take me further from church so then the Lord revealed to me says No you're going to be blessed in the city and you're going to be blessed in the field you're going to be blessed when you go out and when you come in I say wait a minute I'm gonna be blessed in the city I said I'm gonna take that person I'm gonna be blessed in my city where I live but I'm gonna have to wait for my blessing I ain't gonna go out there and try to keep up with the Joneses who live way out somewhere else and Podunk hoe somewhere the the price of being is different over there than it is here but I ain't got to go to Podunk hole to get my blessing I'ma stay right here in West Palm Beach and God gonna bless me but Imma wait on the Lord practical teacher no matter how good you have it it's so easy to think everybody's life is better than yours and the internet is here to make that possible for Paul contentment was Source in Christ himself not in his circumstances you may not have the perfect house perfect engagement of the perfect man but you do not have a perfect but you do have a perfect Savior and he has given all things that pertain to life and Godless and this man was saying on this one I didn't bring it to you but I read it he was saying Pinterest has a way of helping people create this fantasy world you know um I'm gonna create the perfect engagement I'ma create the perfect house I'm gonna create the perfect relationship that's Pinterest in real life it don't work that way Philippians 4 verse 11-13 this is for this this discontentment don't be discontent be content in whatever state you're in the Bible says not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and whatsoever State I am I am there with to be content if I got five customers I'm content if God sent me seven I'm content and I've been in a situation where my customers dropped off I lost two or three but you know what I was I was still content and I just wait on God to keep acting and keep blessing amen whatever whatsoever States I'm content I'm content and and oh you that's all yeah this is what I got this is what God wants me to have well if you just did this you could have it no no no no no no no I don't need to do none of that I'll need to move nowhere to get that I got what I need right where I'm at not that I speak in respect of what if I have learned in what sort of State I am there with to be content I know both how to be a beast and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things hello everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need and I love this part right here I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me um amen two more here's another one uh three more hypocrisy Aaron had a question that says are you living two different lives are you trying to maintain a social media Persona that is completely different than real life and you know he's absolutely right I'll just come back from this Youth Camp and brother rap cook did a wonderful teaching if you notice your social media name that you take on has a different personality hello somebody we don't use our names in social media we we come up with some other other thing hello pretty young thing uh they want one late saved and sexy that don't even sound right man we just come up with these names I mean just think about what's your what's your what's your your your name is on social media I can give some of y'all y'all names I know some of y'all names but just but are you a different person underneath that name you got a different personality you know what they call that uh that people that that kind of they they one way okay you spiritually spiritually bipolar he says instead of trying to maintain your social media media personality maybe take some time off to maintain your walk with Christ I mean you just look at them and and and this great platform they have to be an influence for God they choose it to be an influence for themselves I need more followers I need more business I need more of this anymore let God be the one to give you all of that did God give you the idea for the business guess what God gonna give you the customers and you'd be surprised that customers would come yeah I I I had a customer at one time and and um man she was uh she just she would go on next door for me and she would pose like she was my company and she'd tell people about my company and I was I mean she's selling my my product because she liked what we were doing for her she stole for us so then another another another person reached out to us say you know we having problems with company we need this we need that you know uh we saw your post like well I want to recommend this company I want y'all y'all should go with them I think y'all gonna really love them but God blessed us we got that customer and we had him for roughly almost two years and we were just doing business with him at night we had a night shift and weekend shift that we were covering for about two years and we had some struggles getting through trying to get the right people on there but recently they called us and said you know from eight to five Monday through Friday which is another 45 hours of care so we had first 60 hours of care now that's another 45 and one client 105 hours of care and so our primary caregivers leaving we need y'all to find us somebody and they only gave me a week to do it I said Lord I need the right person and God you got the sin yet and then I walked in here on Wednesday night and brother Steve said blessed is the man that walketh not in the council ungodly and then he starts he gonna bring forth his fruit in his season and then whatever he do will prosper I said Amen brother you're reading that too but it's for me that's the Lord I receive and and on Thursday I left church on Wednesday on Thursday God sent the caregiver had them trained on Friday and they ready to start tomorrow [Applause] so he's a mighty God and all you got to do is be content with what you got ta bless that [Music] but I ain't got to lower my standards to get business the above above my title and anything in this life above my my title in the organization or title and anything I'm a Christian and I want to display that to the world first John 2 verse one through seven let's read this and and I'm I'm I'm winding up I promise you I'm winding up hypocrisy is something that we want to avoid we don't need two different personalities my little children these things right unto you that you sin now and if any man's sin we have an advocate with the father Christ Jesus Christ is I mean Jesus Christ the righteous um and he is a propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know hereby we do know that we know him and the way that we know him is that we if we keep his Commandments he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments it is a liar and the truth is not in him but we but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby no we the we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he what we're supposed to be like Jesus Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which we had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you've heard from beginning and uh just again these scriptures are are there to reiterate we don't need to be Hypocrites let's follow Christ in everything we do I got two more this other one that the guy wrote back wrote and said was saying that somebody people just kind of accept it hatred that yeah he says if there's one Unwritten rule that I have discovered on social media is that it is completely acceptable dispute hatred toward others if they hate you first that this is completely unchristian Jesus Christ Jesus Christ called us to a radically different manner of life loving your enemies is your light shining online can I give you Matthew 5 for this Matthew 5 verse 43. look at this this is how Christians are supposed to act this is how we live ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy I was sitting in you know uh at the barbershop and the guy was talking about the law and Jesus coming to Grace I said Jesus came to magnify the law right not get away with not not do away with law he came to magnify and you'll see right here in the scripture he magnify you heard you you heard it say it Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you this is magnifying but I say unto you love your enemies is that in the Bible bless them that curse you have you ever just thought about you know somebody just doing something so bad and saying something online and you just write back I just so I love you God bless you I appreciate you no you ain't thought that I know you ain't thought that you thought to say other things but this is what Jesus say to say that's right bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you send them a love offering and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sineth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you foreign have you do not even the publicans the same year no different and if you salute your brethren they ain't said nothing to me I ain't saying none of them I'm gonna walk right by him I ain't got nothing to say to him I ain't got nothing to say to him and I've been doing that for years ain't no different than an unbeliever okay all right if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so and here's what Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect one more one more thing that's online that's a sin that people are just accepting one of it's jealousy and he asked this question to say do you spend your leisure time watching the insta stories of people who are living your dream life you live in my dream you live my dream so you need to get out of that and be be more content with Where You Are you growing bitter because the success and prosperity of others he says beware you'll find yourself despising those who have a better life than you and you'll find yourself questioning God's goodness and all the while you will be missing the story that God is writing for you right before your eyes don't let jealousy clouds review God is writing a story just for you and I say rejoice in it yeah amen let me read you a couple scriptures here Galatians 5 21. oh my my Galatians 5 21 and I just you know I did kind of a little search and said what what scriptures in KJV will we find about jealousy and it just kind of gave me a few of them here in Galatians 5 2 1 Ambience murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the witch I tell you before as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God can I put it this way you ain't going to heaven like that James 3 16. for where envying and strife is there's confusion and every evil work another scripture that they gave for this was out of Romans 12 verse 1 and 2. we end up right where we start I beseech you I'm begging with you I'm pleading with you as your pastor I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God not unto man but is it acceptable to God not to society is it acceptable to God I'm not asking much because Paul say this is your it's the least you can do be not conformed to this world please be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you might prove what is that good and acceptable perfect will of God good means to be upright and honorable acceptable means to be well pleasing perfect means to be full grown mature it's time for us to start maturing in God I told y'all last week and I'm gonna keep saying it as long as the Lord put it in my heart to say we are closer to the coming of the Lord than we've ever been and we need to get into the spirit of what of the coming of the lord we can see everybody else getting into the spirit of it but what about the church we can't be cool enough we got to get hotter we got to get on fire for God yield to the perfect will of God let's pray father we if a given Lord what you have wanted us to give today my prayer is that the church would respond Saints would respond Lord to what you were saying it's not the words

have to yield to that yeah it's going to cause some death to some things separations for some things sin is pleasure voice but it's death behind all the pleasure God help us to realize that living for
