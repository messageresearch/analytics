[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. He holds it all together. Let's
[46:30] have a word of prayer.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Had a prayer request come in as well for
[46:39] uh cousin of mine, call him uncle, very
[46:42] very instrumental in in um helping us
[46:46] get started in ministry. Just some of
[46:48] the words of encouragement and strength
[46:49] that he gave us. But understand he's
[46:52] there in the hospital and he streams the
[46:54] services quite often and just asks the
[46:56] church just to pray for him. um he's
[46:59] having a he had a a surgery but they're
[47:02] still having a few complications. So I
[47:04] just want to remember him in prayer.
[47:06] Amen. His name is Stan. Father, we come
[47:09] in the name of Jesus
[47:12] on behalf of uh Reverend Dawson.
[47:16] God uh the surgery that he recently went
[47:20] through but now Father just having some
[47:22] complications from it. Uh we know that
[47:25] you are holding it all together
[47:28] and we ask that you would just move
[47:30] there in the hospital room.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Father, whatever the issues are that
[47:35] they would be settled. We claim you to
[47:38] be our healer. We know, oh God, that you
[47:40] were wounded for our transgressions,
[47:42] bruised for our iniquities, the
[47:43] chastisement of our pieces upon you. And
[47:45] with your stripes, you said we're
[47:48] healed. So, Father, we speak that word
[47:51] over Reverend Dawson even right now that
[47:53] what the doctors and nurses can't do, we
[47:55] know you can do all things. So, we ask
[47:58] that you would intervene, Father, on his
[48:00] behalf. Show yourself strong, God. In
[48:03] the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's get our
[48:10] Bibles and we'll turn to a scripture
[48:13] this morning. Amen. So good to be back
[48:17] in the house of the Lord.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe David said, "I was glad
[48:25] &gt;&gt; when they said unto me, let us go into
[48:29] the house of the Lord."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good things happen
[48:34] &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Strength can happen in the house of the
[48:39] Lord. Deliverance
[48:42] &gt;&gt; happens in the house of the Lord. And
[48:45] you can get your joy back
[48:49] &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Healing occurs
[48:54] &gt;&gt; in the house
[48:56] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read a passage from uh
[49:05] Isaiah 55.
[49:07] Amen.
[49:10] And I only really want one verse out of
[49:13] it, but because the Bible's so good,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the whole chapter.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] Here in Isaiah 55, it says, "Ho everyone
[49:27] that thirsteth,
[49:29] come ye to the waters, and
[49:32] he that hath no money, come ye by and
[49:34] eat. Ye come by wine and milk without
[49:37] money and without price.
[49:40] Wherefore do ye spend money for that
[49:42] which is not bread and your labor for
[49:46] that which it which satisfaith not.
[49:48] Hearken diligently unto me and eat ye e
[49:51] that which is good. And let your soul
[49:54] delight itself in fatness.
[49:58] I like that. Delight yourself in
[50:01] fatness. You know, at our meetings, I
[50:04] told everybody that God made them a
[50:06] promise.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And his promise was that you was going
[50:09] to eat in plenty
[50:12] and be satisfied.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Now, just because the meeting is over,
[50:19] &gt;&gt; don't mean that God's promises stop
[50:21] being manifested.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; That we can delight ourselves this
[50:26] morning in in fatness.
[50:29] Incline your ear and come unto me here
[50:31] and your soul shall live and I will make
[50:34] an everlasting covenant with you, even
[50:37] the sure mercies of David. Behold, I
[50:39] have given him for a witness to the
[50:43] people, a leader and commander to the
[50:45] people.
[50:47] Behold, uh, thou shalt call a nation
[50:49] that thou knowest not, and nations that
[50:52] knew not thee, shall run unto thee,
[50:55] because of the Lord thy God, and for the
[50:57] Holy One of Israel, for he hath
[50:59] glorified thee. Seek ye the Lord
[51:04] while he may be found. Call ye upon him
[51:09] while he is near. uh let the wicked
[51:14] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[51:17] his thoughts and let him return unto the
[51:19] Lord and he will have mercy upon him and
[51:23] to our God for he will abundantly
[51:25] pardon. Uh for my thoughts
[51:29] are not your thoughts. Uh neither are
[51:33] your ways my ways sayeth the Lord. For
[51:38] as the heavens are higher than the
[51:40] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[51:43] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[51:47] And and I just need to inject we we need
[51:49] to get the thoughts of God
[51:52] &gt;&gt; in every circumstance and situation. We
[51:54] need the thoughts of God.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in verse 10, "For
[51:59] as the rain cometh down, and the snow
[52:01] from heaven, and returnneeth not
[52:04] thither, but waterth the earth, and
[52:06] maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it
[52:09] may give seed to the swore, and bread to
[52:12] the eater. So shall my word be that
[52:17] goeth forth out of my mouth.
[52:21] It shall not return unto me void,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I
[52:28] please,
[52:29] and it shall prosper in the thing
[52:32] whereto I sent it.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to keep reading, but our
[52:40] title today is, it shall prosper.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. It shall prosper. Verse 12 says,
[52:47] "For ye shall go out with joy and be led
[52:51] forth with peace.
[52:54] The mountains and the hills shall break
[52:56] forth before you into singing, and all
[52:58] the trees of the field shall clap their
[53:00] hands. Uh, instead of the thorn shall
[53:04] come up the fur tree, and instead of the
[53:07] brier shall come up the myrtle tree, and
[53:11] it shall be to the uh and it shall be to
[53:14] the Lord for a name, for an everlasting
[53:16] sign that shall not be cut off. The Lord
[53:20] a blessing to the reading of his word.
[53:23] Just quick word of prayer. Father, thank
[53:25] you for the reading of the word. May the
[53:28] Holy Spirit now uh bring clarity to what
[53:32] we've read and help us to apply this for
[53:35] where we are living. We take control
[53:37] over every spirit that's against your
[53:40] spirit. And Father, I ask that you would
[53:42] just uh anoint the ears of the hearers,
[53:45] the mouth of the speaker, God, that you
[53:48] would just get glory and honor from all
[53:49] that would happen in this place today.
[53:52] It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[53:56] And you can be seated. Uh again, our
[53:58] title uh for today is it shall prosper.
[54:03] Amen. And just a little inspiration
[54:06] uh it won't return void. Amen. It won't
[54:10] return void. I've had a number of
[54:13] thoughts um crossing my mind and um
[54:19] um but I know kind of just some things
[54:22] that are coming up on the schedule and
[54:24] trying to place things properly. Uh so
[54:28] just ask the Lord just for a little
[54:30] something here today to kind of help us
[54:32] as we you know get into this next area.
[54:35] I I I believe restoration is still on
[54:37] us.
[54:39] I I believe overflow is still on us and
[54:43] uh you know we're just navigating the
[54:45] season, you know, the best we can. But
[54:48] um I I wanted to just drop this little
[54:50] thought in. Amen. Today as the Lord
[54:52] inspired it to me, uh I want to uh read
[54:56] from a quote out of Jehovah Gyra part
[54:59] two. Uh brother Brandham makes a
[55:01] statement here to us. He says, "Let me
[55:04] give you uh a scripture
[55:07] first." It says, "With with what we do,
[55:12] it must be scriptural." It says got to
[55:15] be scriptural. God won't honor nothing
[55:18] else. God won't honor a lie. God won't
[55:22] honor a lie. And I like that statement.
[55:24] If if Brother Brandham so far off, why
[55:27] was God honoring it?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about man honoring, but
[55:31] why was God honor? Because God won't
[55:33] honor a lie.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; All right? It says, you know, that you
[55:36] you couldn't attach that to him. He
[55:38] don't honor lies. He actually hate those
[55:42] that lie. Say he don't honor lies. He
[55:44] only honors his word. But he promised
[55:47] that my word will not return to me void.
[55:52] It it'll accomplish that which it was
[55:55] purposed for. And we see the word that's
[55:58] laotted today. No matter how much
[56:01] unbelief rises in the camp, God will
[56:04] honor his word when he find uh when he
[56:08] find faith to honor it by. And you know,
[56:11] as I was just meditating and thinking on
[56:13] these meetings that we just had, uh as
[56:15] we were approaching the meetings, we um
[56:18] were praying, you know, for the
[56:20] services. And one of the things that we
[56:21] knew the inspiration the Lord given us
[56:24] of our restored sayith the Lord, we knew
[56:27] somebody
[56:28] had to be restored,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; right? There was no way we could go into
[56:33] those meetings and not see restoration
[56:35] on the other side of it.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And I believe we saw a lot of
[56:39] restoration
[56:40] &gt;&gt; and and not only not some of it has been
[56:42] complete, but some of it got started
[56:44] during the meeting. So we're going to
[56:45] see the completion of it. The seeds were
[56:47] sown during the meeting time. Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And and and and when when when when God
[56:52] uh makes a promise in his word, we can
[56:55] we can uh uh uh we it's like putting
[56:58] money in the bank,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; right? We we can we can drop our weight
[57:02] on it knowing that what God has spoken
[57:04] to us, it cannot fall to the ground and
[57:06] return void.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God speaks something to you,
[57:09] it's got to accomplish.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may be delayed,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; right? But just because it's delayed
[57:16] doesn't mean that God forgot about his
[57:18] word.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be able to take God at
[57:21] his word and when he has said something,
[57:23] know that it shall come to pass. No
[57:25] matter what we see, no matter what we
[57:27] feel, no matter what we hear, if God
[57:30] said it, amen, it is already settled.
[57:32] Whether you believe it or not, it's
[57:34] still settled.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But this word void, amen, simply
[57:38] in the Hebrew lexicon, it means uh when
[57:41] it says that it won't return void. It
[57:43] won't return empty,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; right? It won't it won't it won't be
[57:47] spoken just in vain.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It there's a purpose behind
[57:51] what God speaks and and it's not going
[57:53] to just return to you empty or they say
[57:56] in an empty condition. My God, without
[57:59] effect. That's what they say. That word
[58:01] void is without effect. It's going to
[58:03] have an impact. That word uh when God's
[58:06] word goes forth, it will have an impact.
[58:08] This word prosper, I love that it shall
[58:11] prosper the in the thing where to send
[58:14] this word prosper, it simply means to to
[58:17] make progress, to succeed, to be
[58:20] profitable.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those are those are positive words
[58:24] to me.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not it it's not we're not going to
[58:27] lose with God.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; It's going to we're going to profit.
[58:31] We're going to succeed. We're going to
[58:34] advance.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; We're not going backward. No, not after
[58:38] the meetings. We're not going backward.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Hey, we are going to prosper. Which
[58:43] means we are going to advance. We're
[58:46] going to go forward.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what the opposition
[58:52] is, we are still going forward.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, somebody. You're going
[58:58] forward in your finances. You're going
[59:00] forward in your business. You're going
[59:03] forward in your health. Praise God.
[59:05] You're going forward. Every aspect of
[59:08] your life, you're going forward.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, you don't have to receive it if you
[59:14] don't want it, but I'll take it. I'm
[59:16] going forward.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm going to advance.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. No retract and no subtract. No
[59:24] going back. Going forward. I only know
[59:27] one direction to go.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Forward. Praise God.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to prosper.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Is to advance.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; My God. And in order for these words to
[59:46] Amen. to to come alive in our life, God
[59:49] got to do something
[59:51] &gt;&gt; in order to bring his word to pass, he
[59:54] told us that it shall prosper.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm just quoting what he said. I
[59:59] believe it. Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He says um in this
[1:00:03] message, the impersonation of
[1:00:05] Christianity,
[1:00:06] he gives a a statement. He says, "Now
[1:00:09] Christ
[1:00:11] doesn't anoint ministers to preach the
[1:00:14] gospel just to have it returned back to
[1:00:17] him void."
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; So God inspired minister with a message
[1:00:21] and he come out here and preach it.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And you know you needed what that
[1:00:24] preacher said.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; God met you with the word that you
[1:00:27] needed at the time that you needed it.
[1:00:29] Don't just let the word fall to the
[1:00:31] ground. No, this word got to prosper.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My God. Brother Gwyn
[1:00:37] come here a few Wednesday nights ago and
[1:00:39] start telling us about a testimony of
[1:00:41] somebody giving him enough money to to
[1:00:44] uh to buy a house. No. No. We I don't
[1:00:47] know if we get what what what what
[1:00:49] people be saying to us. I'm not talking
[1:00:51] about somebody walking down the street
[1:00:52] and giving you $20 to get you a burger
[1:00:55] or something from Burger King.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; No. No. somebody comes along and says,
[1:01:00] "Here's 800,000."
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And and and he's the second one I'm
[1:01:08] hearing from Zimbabwe with testimonies
[1:01:10] like that.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; I I I I met another brother, went to his
[1:01:13] house.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; I I I was there sitting in his house.
[1:01:15] They invited me over there and I say,
[1:01:17] "Okay, well, praise the Lord. Good to go
[1:01:19] to this brother house." Um and the
[1:01:21] Lord's called him home, Brother G, you
[1:01:23] know. Um, and we go there to the house
[1:01:25] and and they set us all in this one
[1:01:27] little room and probably when my god uh
[1:01:31] probably about big as this stage and we
[1:01:33] all sitting there in the room and and
[1:01:34] I'm like we all just kind of crammed up
[1:01:36] here, chairs everywhere, you know, and
[1:01:39] and they say, "Well, we just want to
[1:01:40] share the testimony with you how we got
[1:01:42] the house." I said, "Okay." And um I
[1:01:45] said, "Well, uh so the brother's sitting
[1:01:47] there." He says, "Yeah, I I was I'm a
[1:01:49] minister and and I went to uh uh Russia
[1:01:52] to minister and um I said, "Okay." He
[1:01:55] says, "And you know, they don't have
[1:01:57] many ministers there." So they was just
[1:01:59] looking for somebody to come in. So I
[1:02:00] got sent over to preach for these people
[1:02:02] and just have some service with them. I
[1:02:04] said, "Okay, praise the Lord." And it
[1:02:05] says, "And when um I finished
[1:02:07] ministering, the brother asked me, did
[1:02:09] my did my wife like candy and my family
[1:02:12] like candy?" And I said, "Yeah, yeah,
[1:02:13] they like candy." He says, he said,
[1:02:14] "Okay, just wait a second. I'm going to
[1:02:15] go get you some candy and and then, you
[1:02:18] know, you'll be able to go onto the
[1:02:19] gates to your uh catch your plane." So,
[1:02:22] they gave him, you know, the the the the
[1:02:24] bag of candy and uh this man uh the
[1:02:27] preacher had the bag of candy and he
[1:02:29] carried it from airport to airport
[1:02:31] because there was many flights that he
[1:02:32] had to catch to get back home to
[1:02:34] Zimbabwe. and he catches um you know one
[1:02:36] flight and and catches another flight
[1:02:38] and he has his bags that he's just took
[1:02:40] long and had gotten a bag of candy and
[1:02:43] uh he he told the stranger said I need
[1:02:45] to go to the restroom would you mind
[1:02:46] watching my bag for me and he says yeah
[1:02:49] sure I'll watch it man watch his bag of
[1:02:51] candy and his other bags and and while
[1:02:53] he used the restroom and he finally get
[1:02:55] all the way home and tired wool out and
[1:02:57] his wife says uh you know let me take
[1:02:59] all your bags and get you get you all
[1:03:00] set up why don't you go ahead and rest
[1:03:02] and and the wife said what's what's in
[1:03:03] that bag he say the preacher just sent
[1:03:05] y'all some candy. Y'all can have some
[1:03:06] candy. So, he went to lay down and the
[1:03:08] wife uh looked inside the bag and she
[1:03:11] say uh
[1:03:15] uh she said, "Honey, you said this was
[1:03:17] candy." And um he said, "Um it is."
[1:03:22] That's what the preacher told me again.
[1:03:23] Say, "No, this ain't candy. This ain't
[1:03:26] candy." And I say, "What?" He say uh she
[1:03:29] say this is more than candy. And when
[1:03:31] they counted the money, I think it's
[1:03:33] about $400,000 cash that was inside that
[1:03:37] bag that he let strangers watch.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Well, there's there's there's something
[1:03:44] that we need to know right there. When
[1:03:46] God got something for you,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; brother, not even a stranger going to be
[1:03:51] able to take it.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And $400,000, I believe, cash that was
[1:03:59] in the bag. and and and the man had been
[1:04:01] praying for a house
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; that God would provide him a house. One
[1:04:05] deal fell through. He didn't understand
[1:04:07] why it fell through, but God had given
[1:04:09] him enough cash from from a preacher,
[1:04:13] not a preacher, but a real estate agent
[1:04:16] that was in Russia that said, "The next
[1:04:18] preacher that come here, I'm going to
[1:04:20] give that preacher my tithing."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And he had a commercial real estate deal
[1:04:25] that went through and was very, very uh
[1:04:28] lucrative. and he paid tithing on it and
[1:04:30] gave the man $400,000.
[1:04:34] Paid for his house in cash.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And I'm sitting there in this and I
[1:04:39] thought this was all a house.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And the brother said, "Now that you
[1:04:42] heard the testimony, let me walk you
[1:04:45] through the house."
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; And as I started walking through the
[1:04:51] house, I said, "Oh my."
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, "Is he only God
[1:04:56] in Zimbabwe?
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] No, he not only God in Zimbabwe,
[1:05:04] brother, he's still God in West Palm
[1:05:06] Beach. And if you need blessings like
[1:05:09] that, God can give you blessings like
[1:05:11] that.
[1:05:13] Hey, if he speaks his word over you, it
[1:05:16] will not return void, but it shall
[1:05:20] prosper.
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:23] [Applause]
[1:05:25] Hallelujah.
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'm getting myself out
[1:05:32] here on a limb.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; It's time to elevate our thinking,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; brother. We ain't got to live beneath
[1:05:40] our privileges.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:05:48] And I I'm not going to live beneath
[1:05:50] mine. If you want to live beneath yours,
[1:05:51] that's up to you. But I ain't living
[1:05:53] beneath mine.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; But I I done heard some powerful
[1:06:00] testimonies come out of Zimbabwe.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Powerful.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; So, you know, I I I when I listen to
[1:06:07] these brothers say, "Well, my God, he he
[1:06:09] the same God. I just need to mix my
[1:06:10] faith in
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; with what my need is,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to see God do exceeding
[1:06:16] the abundant above all I can ask or
[1:06:18] think."
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:26] Oh God, help me. Let me try to stay on
[1:06:27] track here.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The brother brother preached a
[1:06:32] sermon I was listening to. He say uh
[1:06:33] brother Brandham was a poor man
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; with two houses.
[1:06:41] Let me let me say
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham was a poor man
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; with two houses
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; and multiple cars,
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; but he was a poor man.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you forget that
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; he was a poor man.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what would a rich man look like?
[1:07:06] If a poor man got two houses,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; he had one in Jeffersonville and he had
[1:07:12] one out in in in Arizona,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; right? Did he have it?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; He was a poor man.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; All right, let me just keep on reading.
[1:07:30] Now, Christ doesn't uh uh anoint
[1:07:32] ministers to preach the gospel just to
[1:07:35] have it returned back to him void.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; But he expects you to receive the word.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And in receiving the word, in receiving
[1:07:46] the word, be ready.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's that's a key thing now.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Be ready.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ready to do something with
[1:07:56] what you got.
[1:07:57] You know it it it and let me tell you
[1:07:59] the first thing that need to change.
[1:08:01] Amen. Is is your faith.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; God can change situations just like
[1:08:07] that. But it's your faith. You got to
[1:08:08] mix it with the word that's coming to
[1:08:10] you. And that's how things start
[1:08:12] changing.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the word of God that
[1:08:15] created everything we have right now.
[1:08:17] That seat you sitting in was created by
[1:08:18] the word of God. That car you driving in
[1:08:20] to get here created by the word of God.
[1:08:22] Right. Everything we have by the word of
[1:08:24] God. It starts with the word.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And once you mix faith with
[1:08:28] the word, then you'll see results.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; All right. Oh my Lord, I'm I'm trying to
[1:08:35] I'm trying to just I'm trying to just
[1:08:37] stay in this channel, but I I I just
[1:08:40] when you hear of other people being
[1:08:42] blessed and you realize there's
[1:08:45] something that I'm missing,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; something I'm missing. How How is this
[1:08:49] brother walking like this? How how why
[1:08:51] is they business like this?
[1:08:55] Lord have mercy. I'm going back to
[1:08:56] Zimbabwe again.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way back to Zimbabwe. I'm
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; We were We were We were invited to go to
[1:09:05] a house for dinner.
[1:09:09] Pastor said, "Yeah, we're going to take
[1:09:10] you down to this brother's house." And
[1:09:13] says, "Okay, all right. No problem.
[1:09:14] We'll we happily, you know, go and and
[1:09:17] uh and fellowship with them." So when we
[1:09:19] pulled up on the property, fenced in
[1:09:21] like um
[1:09:23] um
[1:09:24] uh concrete fence all around. And uh so
[1:09:28] there were two houses on the property
[1:09:31] and one of them was like look like about
[1:09:33] four bedroomedroom, you know, uh four
[1:09:36] bedroomedroom uh threeb home, you know,
[1:09:40] nice size house. I say, "Oh, that's this
[1:09:42] where the the saints live." And that's
[1:09:44] me. I'm always talking ahead of time.
[1:09:46] Oh, this where the saints live. Praise
[1:09:47] the Lord. That's good. The pastor said,
[1:09:48] "No,
[1:09:50] that's where the workers live.
[1:09:55] The brother lives over over here." I
[1:09:58] looked at that house, it was a mini
[1:10:01] hotel,
[1:10:03] three levels.
[1:10:05] And as you walked up the steps of this
[1:10:07] house, I said, "Oh, Lord."
[1:10:10] I said, "Now they telling us in Florida
[1:10:13] that there's hungry people over here
[1:10:16] that need our money.
[1:10:21] We the ones hungry.
[1:10:24] We need we need this.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; I couldn't believe my eyes.
[1:10:33] I asked the pastor. I said, "What what
[1:10:34] you do for a living?" I said, "At
[1:10:36] first," I said, "How how many how many
[1:10:38] saints in your church?" I mean, uh, how
[1:10:41] big is a church? He said, "I got a small
[1:10:44] church." I said, he said, "About a
[1:10:46] thousand people.
[1:10:49] Well, that was he was small because the
[1:10:50] pastor that took me there had about
[1:10:52] 6,000 people in his church. So, he knew
[1:10:54] that that's why he called it small. I
[1:10:55] said, "Well, what do you do?" He say, "I
[1:11:00] sell oil to nations."
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He not just selling oil to
[1:11:07] this one little gas station.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; No, the nations
[1:11:13] need oil. and I sell oil to the nations.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Now, what you think his bank account
[1:11:19] looked like?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to sell? Wouldn't you
[1:11:28] just like one transaction like that?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It can happen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; It can happen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; This ain't just for people over there.
[1:11:41] We need to hear testimonies like this
[1:11:43] right in our midst.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; We got to take this word and do
[1:11:49] something with it.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[1:11:52] Oh Lord have mercy. God help me. And he
[1:11:57] says he he expects you to receive the
[1:11:59] word and then receiving the word. Be
[1:12:00] ready. Take that old cow hide you've
[1:12:04] been living in over there in that old
[1:12:06] former condition and swap it off for a
[1:12:09] sheep skin that's flexible to the word
[1:12:12] of God
[1:12:13] and everything the Bible says you'll say
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:12:20] But it come it it must come from the
[1:12:23] Bible for the new wine only fermentss
[1:12:26] uh for the for the new wine only
[1:12:28] fermentss wine. It only verifies the
[1:12:30] elements that's in there. The yeast only
[1:12:33] presses forth the bulb of the alcohol
[1:12:36] which makes it a bursting profession.
[1:12:39] As the yeast burst is it it's little
[1:12:42] bubble to make it a more perfect to give
[1:12:44] it uh the better taste to give it a
[1:12:47] better substantial holding to make it
[1:12:49] more stronger to make it so it can sour.
[1:12:53] Amen. So here he says the minister is
[1:12:56] not coming to preach something and God
[1:12:58] anoint them with something and then have
[1:13:00] that return void. All that we heard in
[1:13:03] the meetings, God ain't letting that
[1:13:04] return void.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; No, it's going to prosper.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; It's going to prosper.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; It will not return void.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's go on
[1:13:16] a little further here. Amen. In this
[1:13:18] message, God's provided place for
[1:13:21] worship.
[1:13:22] The prophet makes a statement. It says,
[1:13:24] "God's only provided plan for any age in
[1:13:29] his word. His son came and manifested
[1:13:32] every promise that was promised for his
[1:13:35] age." Jesus manifested every promise
[1:13:38] that was promised for his age. All the
[1:13:41] prophets came just exactly on time. Uh
[1:13:44] they was God's word living on earth.
[1:13:47] They was the word. Jesus said uh that
[1:13:50] they were gods. Jesus called them
[1:13:52] prophets. Those prophets gods. A man met
[1:13:55] me in the last meeting. He said, "You
[1:13:57] are a poor theologian."
[1:13:59] Uh he says, "And I said, I don't claim
[1:14:01] to be one." I said, "The word don't come
[1:14:03] to to a theologian. Theology does.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; The word uh word comes see I said just
[1:14:09] theology comes to a theologian." But I
[1:14:11] said, "We're talking about something
[1:14:13] else." And he says, "Now we find that in
[1:14:16] each age when God said a certain thing
[1:14:19] would happen, here come that man along
[1:14:23] and manifested that.
[1:14:27] Here come their people along and lived
[1:14:32] that that was God himself living in the
[1:14:36] people because it was an answering of
[1:14:39] his word."
[1:14:41] See? So, so when we say it shall not
[1:14:43] return void or it shall prosper,
[1:14:46] somebody's got to be an answer to God's
[1:14:48] word.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. When God allow allows
[1:14:53] a minister to pick it up and preach it
[1:14:55] to you, somebody got to mix their faith
[1:14:57] with it so they can become the answer to
[1:15:00] that word.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be an answer to the word.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I want to be the fulfillment of God's
[1:15:06] promise. I want to see I want to see
[1:15:09] advancement and prosperity. I want to
[1:15:12] see that in my life.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; If he said it shall prosper, then let it
[1:15:16] prosper.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah, church. Amen. He goes on
[1:15:23] to say this. Says um now God's only
[1:15:26] provided way and only provided plan
[1:15:28] today is his son uh through his word for
[1:15:31] this age quickened by the spirit of life
[1:15:34] quicken. Now, uh, and I know this this
[1:15:38] quote can be tied in so many different
[1:15:39] ways, especially when God sends a man,
[1:15:42] we know God sent us a prophet. And, um,
[1:15:44] in order to have a prophet, uh, just
[1:15:46] like in the days of the Lord Jesus, when
[1:15:48] Jesus came, God had to have somebody on
[1:15:51] the earth that would believe who he was,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Peter happened to be one of them people
[1:15:56] that believed who he was,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; right? and and and and and in this day
[1:16:00] when God would send his word through uh
[1:16:02] the ministry of William Brandham, uh
[1:16:05] there have to be somebody on earth that
[1:16:07] would have to believe that that was God
[1:16:09] sending his prophet.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah. That's God
[1:16:16] sending you, which is me.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll be honest. Amen. If uh I'm
[1:16:22] glad that God put you in the scripture
[1:16:26] because that include all of us.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; But he could have wrote it like this.
[1:16:30] Behold, I send Jack Dove, Elijah.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God already knew
[1:16:36] that Jack Duff was going to believe who
[1:16:39] Elijah was.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; I hope you can put your name in the
[1:16:42] scripture.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; But since he put you, that included all
[1:16:47] of us.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, now here's the thing.
[1:16:51] Amen. Uh that I want to just kind of uh
[1:16:54] uh get from this because God have to
[1:16:56] have somebody on the earth that would
[1:16:58] believe. Now this this believe uh I was
[1:17:03] just kind of looking at the scripture,
[1:17:06] these signs shall follow them that
[1:17:08] believe, right? And and and and I just
[1:17:10] went to the um the the Greek lexicon to
[1:17:14] just kind of get the meaning of that.
[1:17:16] And in the Greek lexicon, that word
[1:17:18] believe means to commit unto
[1:17:21] uh to to to put in trust with uh to
[1:17:26] commit to one's trust. Another
[1:17:28] definition to think to be true, to be
[1:17:32] persuaded,
[1:17:34] to credit, place confidence in. Amen. Uh
[1:17:37] and and and I also got uh another
[1:17:39] dictionary that I was looking in, my key
[1:17:42] to the Bible dictionary. And that that
[1:17:43] word believe means to credit or to to
[1:17:46] credit a record or report as true. So
[1:17:50] when when I say I believe, amen, I might
[1:17:53] hear something and even though I wasn't
[1:17:55] there,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; my God,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; I still believe that's true.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example. Praise the
[1:18:04] Lord. Hallelujah. Uh, I was recently
[1:18:07] just listening to a tape in my car and
[1:18:11] uh and I heard brother Brandham telling
[1:18:12] a story of him flying in a plane and
[1:18:18] somehow as they were flying in the plane
[1:18:21] uh over Tennessee uh the plane got
[1:18:24] grounded
[1:18:25] because of some mechanical issue
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; and uh they couldn't explain what was
[1:18:31] going on but actually it was more than a
[1:18:33] mechanical issue. It was a spiritual
[1:18:35] issue.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a physical issue.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And there was a woman that had a prayer.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And she her prayer was strong enough to
[1:18:45] cause a plane to come down.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Cuz she had a question for God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And her question said, "Lord, I I I'm
[1:18:55] your sunomite. I can identify myself in
[1:18:59] the scripture." She said, "But where is
[1:19:01] your Elijah?
[1:19:03] I I I'm a shootite, but where is your
[1:19:05] Elijah? Had no idea that Elijah was
[1:19:09] flying right over the top of her city.
[1:19:12] And it just so happened that God would
[1:19:14] make this this plane settle down in her
[1:19:17] city,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; put the prophet in a hotel that would
[1:19:20] cause him to walk through a certain
[1:19:22] neighborhood.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While he's singing, I'm one
[1:19:26] of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad I
[1:19:29] can say I'm one of them. had no idea why
[1:19:31] he was walking. But the Holy Spirit, cuz
[1:19:35] those that are led by the spirit of God,
[1:19:37] they are the sons of God. The Holy
[1:19:39] Spirit said, "Keep walking."
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And as he kept walking, he passed the
[1:19:43] house singing. And the lady was standing
[1:19:46] there.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; She said, "Good morning, Parson."
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "How you know I'm a preacher?"
[1:19:52] He wasn't carrying a Bible. He wasn't
[1:19:54] doing that. But how do you know I'm a
[1:19:55] preacher? Say, "God showed me that you
[1:19:57] was coming."
[1:19:59] That same God lives today. I'm telling
[1:20:01] you right now
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; begin to tell a situation. I got a son
[1:20:07] that got wrapped up with amen the wrong
[1:20:10] uh wrong in the wrong crowd and now he's
[1:20:12] in here laying here dying. And I don't
[1:20:14] need him to to be made whole. Amen.
[1:20:17] Physically, but I just want to know that
[1:20:19] his soul is saved.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; She said, "You ever heard of my
[1:20:25] minister? My my ministry say he see she
[1:20:27] say no I never heard of you. Never heard
[1:20:29] of you. Say but I did ask God where his
[1:20:32] Elijah was
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; and he sent you.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; They went in that house and they begin
[1:20:38] to pray. And brother Brandham said you
[1:20:40] pray first. He said by the time he say
[1:20:43] that sister prayed. He said tears was
[1:20:44] all over his eyes. He said I ain't never
[1:20:46] heard nobody pray like that before.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; He says then he prayed and while the boy
[1:20:52] was in the house saying it's dark in
[1:20:54] here. It's dark in here in that bed.
[1:20:55] It's dark in here. It's dark in here.
[1:20:56] And he say he say all of a sudden but
[1:20:58] when he finished praying the boy said,
[1:20:59] "It's light in here. It's light in here.
[1:21:01] It's light in here." And brother
[1:21:02] Brandham got into the car and took off,
[1:21:05] got a cab and made it to the uh airport
[1:21:07] and caught his flight and he was gone.
[1:21:08] Now I'm going to tell you something. I
[1:21:09] wasn't there.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You weren't there either.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; We weren't in We weren't in Memphis,
[1:21:15] Tennessee.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; None of us was nowhere around. Some of
[1:21:18] us weren't even born. But when I heard
[1:21:21] the story,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; something on the inside of me
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; agreed with that story. And that's why I
[1:21:30] say I believe I ain't got to be there to
[1:21:33] believe it. If it sound like something
[1:21:36] God will do, brother, I believe it,
[1:21:39] sister. I believe it. And ain't nothing
[1:21:41] you going to do to take that from me.
[1:21:46] Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there when he opened the Red
[1:21:54] Sea.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. I just read it in the
[1:22:00] Bible
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; and I heard another preacher talk about
[1:22:02] it before
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; and I I wasn't there. But you know what?
[1:22:05] I believe it.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there when ar Pharaoh's army
[1:22:11] drowned in the Red Sea,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; but I believe it. I was nowhere to be
[1:22:17] found
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; when they threw them three Hebrew boys
[1:22:20] in a fiery furnace.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; I I was not around.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; But they told me about it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; And for some reason,
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; come on, somebody.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; I believe it,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; brother. Whether I was there or not, I
[1:22:36] still believe it. And God had to have
[1:22:39] somebody on the earth with that type of
[1:22:42] faith
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; that whether they were there or not,
[1:22:44] they still believe
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; because his word can't return void.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there to see Daniel go in the
[1:22:58] lion's den and come out the next day.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; But they told me that Daniel went in,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; he came out unharmed. And then they say
[1:23:07] the people that came up with this scheme
[1:23:09] got thrown in the lion's den after
[1:23:11] Daniel.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; They never came out.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; But I believe it.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there to see Jesus walk the
[1:23:24] earth
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and all the miracles that he did and all
[1:23:28] that's recorded in the Bible. I was not
[1:23:30] there
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; physically. I wasn't there. But I
[1:23:33] believe Jesus came.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe Jesus died
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; and I believe Jesus rose again.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I went there,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; but I believe it.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I was there in none of the brother
[1:23:53] Brandham's meetings. I didn't attend
[1:23:54] one. Not one.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He was gone before I was born.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; But when I heard about what God did in
[1:24:02] that man's ministry,
[1:24:04] And I heard some of the testimonies that
[1:24:06] came forth. I could line those
[1:24:07] testimonies up with what was happening
[1:24:09] in scripture.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And I say, I wasn't there.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; But I believe it.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got confidence in it.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I'm committed to it.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I put my trust in it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; That's what it means to believe.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I think it to be true. All
[1:24:33] right.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; It just sound like something God will
[1:24:37] do.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Here we we we we we
[1:24:45] uh let me read a quote and then maybe
[1:24:47] I'll try to jump through the scripture
[1:24:49] here. out of three kinds of believers.
[1:24:52] And brother Random is is taken
[1:24:57] um his thought for three kinds of
[1:24:59] believer taken from the scripture out of
[1:25:01] John 6
[1:25:04] and and I I I'll catch that first in a
[1:25:06] second. John 6 uh and get ready verse
[1:25:08] 66. Just get that prepared. But um what
[1:25:12] happened here in John 6 is that Jesus
[1:25:16] was
[1:25:18] talking to the people that day and he
[1:25:21] made a statement. He says uh unless you
[1:25:24] eat my flesh and drink my blood you have
[1:25:28] no part with me. He took a sermon very
[1:25:30] difficult difficult uh subject because
[1:25:34] he knew that it would be misunderstood
[1:25:36] by the people. And that's why you have
[1:25:38] to be so careful when you come to
[1:25:40] church. Uh make sure that you in the
[1:25:42] right channel because you can
[1:25:43] misunderstand something.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; You can miss it if the devil got you off
[1:25:48] in left field somewhere. You can really
[1:25:49] miss what God trying to tell you. So
[1:25:51] make sure you're in the right channel so
[1:25:53] that you catch what God saying. And that
[1:25:54] way it don't throw you off cuz cuz Jesus
[1:25:56] said, "Sless you eat my flesh and drink
[1:25:58] my blood, you have no part." They said,
[1:25:59] "Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1:26:00] No, no, no, no, no, no." They told us
[1:26:02] this man was a little little. It went
[1:26:05] right to their mind what people said
[1:26:06] about him. They told us that he he not
[1:26:09] he not he ain't got it all together. He
[1:26:11] he he kind of off a little bit. He he
[1:26:13] teach false doctrine. They told us this.
[1:26:15] They told us watch out for this. Eat his
[1:26:17] flesh. Drink his blood.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Is he think we what do he think about
[1:26:23] us? So, so the, so the Bible, the Bible,
[1:26:26] you know, said what happened there in
[1:26:27] John 666.
[1:26:32] After the people heard this sermon in
[1:26:34] John 666, it says, "From that time,
[1:26:39] many of his disciples went back."
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Now, after one sermon, they they forgot
[1:26:46] about all the miracles. Some of their
[1:26:48] mamas had been healed. Some of their
[1:26:50] daddies had been healed. They forgot
[1:26:52] about all the good things that God had
[1:26:54] did and they went back.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. When the word is
[1:26:58] prospering, it doesn't go back.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; The word advances.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Believers will advance with the word.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said he says from that time
[1:27:11] many of his disciples went back and
[1:27:14] walked no more with him. And here in
[1:27:16] John 6:67 it says, "Then said Jesus unto
[1:27:20] the 12,
[1:27:22] we also go away." Now here's the here's
[1:27:23] the here's the thing because when in
[1:27:25] John 666
[1:27:27] they walk I mean I mean now notice the
[1:27:30] scripture say disciples left.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; These were key individuals. And if I
[1:27:37] could just put it this way, these were
[1:27:38] people that cast out devils in his name.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He had given them power to cast out
[1:27:44] devils. sent them out two by two. But
[1:27:46] when they heard one sermon,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; oh my God, it shook them.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Don't let one sermon take you out.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let just one. Don't don't don't.
[1:27:59] Now, when you're a believer, I'm telling
[1:28:00] you, one sermon can't take you out.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Not not one. No, it's going to take a
[1:28:06] lot more than that. I I I I'm We too We
[1:28:09] too quick to pull the trigger.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Heard
[1:28:15] No, just give him a break. Hold on. Slow
[1:28:17] down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. You know,
[1:28:23] somebody did that to the prophet when he
[1:28:25] when he quoted uh uh I think 700 rather
[1:28:28] than 7,000. I mean, oh, he said it
[1:28:30] wrong. Now, don't be so quick to be
[1:28:32] jumping like that.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's the devil that got you anointed
[1:28:35] like that.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; But believers can't be shook by just
[1:28:38] anything.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Give the man time to explain what he
[1:28:42] talking about. And even if he don't
[1:28:44] explain it,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; because Jesus never explained, "Eat my
[1:28:50] flesh and drink my blood."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Never explained it. But here comes, you
[1:28:59] know, these 70 that done cast out devil.
[1:29:01] He say he they say, "Well, you know
[1:29:03] what? I I knew something was wrong here.
[1:29:05] I'm gone. I'm I'm out. I'm out right
[1:29:07] here." And then the next verse, he looks
[1:29:10] and he asked uh the disciples that was
[1:29:13] left,
[1:29:15] will you also go away? It was about 82
[1:29:19] people in church.
[1:29:22] 70 the majority walked out. 12 left. And
[1:29:26] he asked them just looked at and I mean
[1:29:28] Jesus wasn't in tears.
[1:29:31] Jesus wasn't uh depressed.
[1:29:36] Jesus was not I mean he just he looked
[1:29:38] at the other 12. Will you also go
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; because he wanted to see what was in
[1:29:45] them?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And and and see believers got this extra
[1:29:48] thing on the inside of them that it's
[1:29:52] going to take a little bit more than
[1:29:53] that. Like like my auntie my auntie sung
[1:29:55] it. She say it's going to take
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; but she was she she just she was she got
[1:30:02] we got caught in a hurricane.
[1:30:05] and and and them hurricane force winds
[1:30:07] you got to be careful with. It'll take
[1:30:09] your house away.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; But but when she made it through the
[1:30:12] hurricane, God gave us some. She said,
[1:30:14] "It's going to take a stronger wind than
[1:30:16] this to keep me from my promises.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a stronger wind than
[1:30:24] this
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; to keep this eagle down."
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You got to understand something about
[1:30:31] eagles. They don't get affected by the
[1:30:33] storm.
[1:30:35] Not not eagles. They they made different
[1:30:38] than any other bird. A eagle has the
[1:30:42] ability to get himself above the storm
[1:30:46] and ride that thing out.
[1:30:49] Come on eagles. I know you got some
[1:30:51] storms in your life, but get up, mount
[1:30:55] them wings, and get up above the storm.
[1:30:58] Ride that thing out. Praise God. Ride
[1:31:01] out that financial storm. Ride out that
[1:31:04] storm in your health. Ride it out in the
[1:31:06] name of Jesus. Set your wings and fly.
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] [Applause]
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; We got to know that we big and better
[1:31:28] than that.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. I ain't I'm not
[1:31:31] going to be defeated.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Brother West Brother West Wesco is
[1:31:34] singing. I will not be defeated. No, I
[1:31:36] won't.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; All All the All them uh what do they
[1:31:43] call them words? No. And won't and uh
[1:31:47] two two they're like two negative words.
[1:31:49] I forget what they're not negative and
[1:31:52] how a double negative something like
[1:31:53] that. You're not you're not supposed to
[1:31:55] put that in a sentence.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; No, I won't. But for believers,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; we know exactly what that mean.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And brother Brother Wesco made a run out
[1:32:05] of that thing. No, I won't.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; No, I won't. Now, I'm telling you, when
[1:32:10] you get it in your spirit like that, it
[1:32:13] don't matter what the devil doing. No, I
[1:32:15] won't. I ain't going to be defeated.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I ain't going down. I'm advancing. I'm
[1:32:20] moving forward.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Woo! Jesus.
[1:32:29] My God.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; But here he he he puts them in a
[1:32:33] situation with believers. And and now
[1:32:35] now look, you identify yourself
[1:32:40] based on your own actions and reactions.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; The the makeeliever was in this group.
[1:32:49] The unbeliever was in this group.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; And the true believer was in this group.
[1:32:54] Now, now, now, now you see the the
[1:32:56] unbelievers, they showed themselves soon
[1:32:57] as he said, "Eat my flesh, drink my
[1:32:58] blood," they didn't wait to get no
[1:33:00] explanation. They just took off.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; They just walked with him no more. I
[1:33:04] mean, never came back to church.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; The makeeliever was Judas. He actually
[1:33:13] stayed there
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; to see what was going to happen. But he
[1:33:17] knew. And this why Jesus could say, you
[1:33:19] know, I know I see all 12 of y'all, but
[1:33:21] one of y'all still ain't right.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And God, he said, "This guy just make
[1:33:26] believe, right?" But but but but the
[1:33:28] true believer,
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; even after he saw everybody leave,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; huh? Even even after they heard about
[1:33:39] the negative websites,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; even after they they even they see they
[1:33:47] see friends and family members getting
[1:33:49] impacted by it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Huh? But a true believer
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; ain't got his eyes on none of that.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; My eyes is on the word.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be there to believe it.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; If if he said some men died off a
[1:34:06] bridge,
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; I ain't got to go searching Google.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; If he said he didn't get a black bear, I
[1:34:14] I ain't got none. I just believe it.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. what that got to do with the
[1:34:21] message
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to tell you the message is
[1:34:24] not about the testimonies.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; The testimonies is only to build your
[1:34:28] faith.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And and and it's to build your faith to
[1:34:32] to prove one thing. The the theme of
[1:34:34] brother Brandham's ministry was Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; We needed to know that the same Jesus of
[1:34:45] the Bible still lives today.
[1:34:52] He said that God gave him three
[1:34:54] squirrels two different times. You don't
[1:34:57] have to show me the squirrels.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But I believe it.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Abraham was in a mountain.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; It's and God told him offer his son. And
[1:35:15] Abraham while he was preparing to offer
[1:35:17] Isaac, God spoke say,"Abraham, I know
[1:35:19] you believe me now."
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "You know what? Stay your hand,
[1:35:22] Abraham. I have provided a ram in the
[1:35:26] bush
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; in order to you to sacrifice that ram
[1:35:29] rather than sacrifice your son. I was
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I was nowhere near that mountain.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I I wasn't there.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; You wasn't either." That's right.
[1:35:44] But
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; you cannot tell me that Abraham didn't
[1:35:50] try to offer Isaac
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and that a ram showed up in his place
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; because in the scripture it actually
[1:35:56] said Abraham when I I said now daddy I
[1:35:59] see wood I see this I see this I see all
[1:36:01] now where's the sacrifice Abraham said
[1:36:03] the Lord will provide himself
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; that's what brother Solomon told me say
[1:36:07] not for himself the Lord will provide
[1:36:10] himself
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; and you You know that that belief is so
[1:36:14] strong. That belief is so strong. I know
[1:36:16] it happened. I wasn't there, but I you
[1:36:19] couldn't take it from me.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Abraham tried to offer Isaac and God
[1:36:24] provided a ram.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I'm standing on that.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Come to find out when I got to Israel,
[1:36:34] the the uh tour guide said, "Welcome to
[1:36:37] Mariah." I said, "No, we going to
[1:36:39] Jerusalem, my friend." They all said,
[1:36:41] "We're going to Jerusalem." He says,
[1:36:43] "Yeah, welcome to Mariah."
[1:36:47] I said, "You realize what you're
[1:36:48] saying?" He said, "Yeah, I know exactly
[1:36:50] what I'm saying. I'm I'm from Israel. I
[1:36:52] I know what I'm talking about here.
[1:36:54] Welcome to Mariah. My first time in
[1:36:56] Israel. I'm trying to correct him."
[1:37:01] I said, "Well, where's Calvary?" He
[1:37:05] said, "Just up the hill over there." I
[1:37:06] said, "Now, see, I I don't know nothing
[1:37:08] about just up the hill. I ain't never
[1:37:09] been here before. I don't even know what
[1:37:11] the up the hill mean. He said, "Just up
[1:37:14] the hill." I said, "Okay, all right. I
[1:37:16] got something for you."
[1:37:19] I pull out my phone. I say, "How far is
[1:37:23] Mariah
[1:37:24] from Calvary?"
[1:37:27] And Google came back and said, "It's a
[1:37:30] fourminute walk."
[1:37:34] And right there in that moment, I said,
[1:37:38] "You mean to tell me
[1:37:41] that Abraham
[1:37:43] brought Isaac
[1:37:45] to the same mountain where Jesus Christ
[1:37:48] himself would die?"
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Before I even knew that, I believe
[1:37:58] Abraham had offered Isaac.
[1:38:01] But when I found out it was the same
[1:38:03] mountain
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; and not only that, then I found out the
[1:38:06] prophet said he read it and when he read
[1:38:08] that statement in a book, he took off
[1:38:10] running around. He say even if it ain't
[1:38:12] true,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; even if it ain't true,
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; what a wonderful God we serve
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; to see how perfect God could be.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; I was nowhere to be found. I wasn't
[1:38:24] there. I wasn't there. I wasn't there.
[1:38:27] But I believe all that.
[1:38:33] I was reading something and I don't Oh,
[1:38:35] okay. Uh I was telling you these three
[1:38:38] kind of believers when
[1:38:41] the next verse uh in John 668 God he had
[1:38:45] asked them where you also go. He was
[1:38:46] just doing this to set them up to see
[1:38:48] what their response was going to be. And
[1:38:49] look, look at Simon Peter. See, God
[1:38:52] gonna always have one
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and this one will be judgment to
[1:38:57] everybody else. But this one, Simon
[1:39:00] Peter answered him, "Lord,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; pretty much uh go where?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; What? What? What you mean go?"
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Now, didn't you see your cousin and your
[1:39:17] uncle and all these other people just
[1:39:19] left? Will you also go?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Huh?
[1:39:26] He said, "To whom shall we go?
[1:39:30] Where am I going?"
[1:39:32] "This right here,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; these are the words
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; of eternal life."
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And and Peter said this without even
[1:39:45] having an understanding of what eat my
[1:39:47] flesh and drink my blood was.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't know what the thunders
[1:39:52] are,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; do you still believe? If you don't even
[1:39:55] know what the seals are. Do you still
[1:39:57] believe?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; God has done enough. Amen. To settle our
[1:40:02] faith.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Well, we know there's nowhere else to
[1:40:05] go.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; This right here has eternal life. Your
[1:40:08] life couldn't even be changed by nothing
[1:40:10] else. You know that
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; your life couldn't be there's not enough
[1:40:16] power out there to keep you. You know
[1:40:18] that.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; You know that. But there's just
[1:40:23] something about the power that's inside
[1:40:25] this word. Cuz this word that we have,
[1:40:27] this revealed word we have,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; is the words of eternal life.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; And rapturing faith is found in these
[1:40:34] books and in these tapes.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. All
[1:40:39] right, let me move on. I'm I'm way out
[1:40:43] of my
[1:40:46] area, but God knows here. Um
[1:40:53] the message um three kind of believers
[1:40:56] actually I can probably skip on let me
[1:40:58] move on let me go to have not I sent
[1:41:03] thee
[1:41:10] there is I just got
[1:41:13] no
[1:41:15] I got a scripture I want to read 2
[1:41:17] Chronicles 20 now uh I Want to just
[1:41:21] throw this out here. I was going to stop
[1:41:23] at 2s 2020, but I think I want to read a
[1:41:26] little bit more than that. Uh, church,
[1:41:28] it's something about
[1:41:31] being a believer. And and as I was just
[1:41:34] just thinking on this subject, that song
[1:41:36] just kept hitting me. Yes, I'm a
[1:41:39] believer.
[1:41:43] I'm a believer. And as I was telling
[1:41:45] everyone on the night of worship,
[1:41:48] people can write songs
[1:41:50] and to them it it has a meaning which
[1:41:54] you know we can identify with what
[1:41:56] they're singing because I'm a believer
[1:41:58] in Jesus Christ. Uh most people think
[1:42:00] that the battle is against like you know
[1:42:02] people that believe in Buddha, people
[1:42:04] that believe in Krishna and u you know
[1:42:07] just all the other uh false gods that
[1:42:10] they have and and they they just they're
[1:42:12] steadily trying to fight that battle,
[1:42:14] right? But um the battle's greater than
[1:42:17] that because even in Christianity
[1:42:20] there are so many different crazy
[1:42:22] beliefs. Um many believe in three gods.
[1:42:25] They believe in the father, they believe
[1:42:26] in the son, they believe in the holy
[1:42:27] ghost. Even though the Bible say the
[1:42:28] Lord our God is one, they still believe
[1:42:31] in three gods and call themselves
[1:42:32] Christians, right? And and so we have to
[1:42:35] there there's so much even in
[1:42:36] Christianity that that that must be
[1:42:38] battled. And then on top of that, when
[1:42:40] you get to the message, there's other
[1:42:42] people with crazy things in the message
[1:42:43] that you got to weed your way through.
[1:42:45] And remember, brother Brandham said that
[1:42:47] in in um in uh I believe Luther's day,
[1:42:51] he says the miracle was Luther having
[1:42:54] the ability to keep his head above
[1:42:58] fanaticism.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And look, that ain't stopping Luther's
[1:43:02] day. That's still here today. We got to
[1:43:04] be able to keep our head above
[1:43:05] fanaticism.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Because fanaticism is coming to the
[1:43:09] message.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my.
[1:43:14] just just so much. Um, but in 2
[1:43:18] Coronicles chapter 20, I think what I
[1:43:20] want to do is read um let me start at
[1:43:22] verse 13, I believe. Yeah, verse 13.
[1:43:30] All right.
[1:43:32] Says, um,
[1:43:35] "And Judah stood before the Lord with
[1:43:37] their little ones, their wives, and
[1:43:38] their children. Then upon Jehazio, the
[1:43:41] son of Zechariah, the son of Beni
[1:43:43] Baniah, the son of Jael, the son of Ma
[1:43:46] uh Mataniah,
[1:43:50] uh, a Levite of the sons of Asaf, came
[1:43:52] the spirit of the Lord, in the midst of
[1:43:53] the congregation, and he said, "Hearken
[1:43:56] ye all Judah and inhabitants of
[1:43:58] Jerusalem, and thou, King Jehoshaphat,
[1:44:00] thus sayeth the Lord unto you, be not
[1:44:03] afraid nor dismayed by reason of this
[1:44:05] great multitude, for the battle is not
[1:44:07] yours, but gods.
[1:44:11] Tomorrow go ye down against them.
[1:44:14] Behold, they come up by uh the cliff of
[1:44:17] Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end
[1:44:19] of the brook before the wilderness of
[1:44:21] Jeru. Ye shall not need to fight in this
[1:44:25] battle.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Set yourselves.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Stand ye still. Now, now, now, here's
[1:44:31] the thing. Even though you don't need to
[1:44:32] fight, you still got to show up.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:35] And and not only not only show up, show
[1:44:37] up dressed for battle.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Have your your sword,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; your shield,
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; your shoes girded,
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; right? I mean I mean you you need to,
[1:44:49] you know, just just be ready for battle
[1:44:50] now. You ain't going to have to fight,
[1:44:52] but show up and look like you going to
[1:44:53] battle.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Show up with your uniform on now.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right. All right. And it
[1:45:04] says, "Ye shall not need to fight in
[1:45:05] this battle. Set yourselves stand ye
[1:45:06] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:45:08] with you. Oh Judah and Jerusalem. Fear
[1:45:10] not nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out
[1:45:12] against him for the Lord will be with
[1:45:14] you." And Jehoshaphat bowed his head
[1:45:18] with his face to the ground. And all
[1:45:20] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:45:22] fell before the Lord worshiping uh
[1:45:24] worshiping the Lord. And the Levites of
[1:45:27] the children of of Corites and of the
[1:45:30] children of the Korites stood up to
[1:45:32] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:45:35] loud voice on high. Brother, not no
[1:45:39] quiet voice. They came ready.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; They came ready to sing. They came ready
[1:45:43] to rejoice. They They was praising their
[1:45:45] God.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Not only did God hear him, but the devil
[1:45:48] could hear him, too. It says, "And they
[1:45:50] rose early in the morning and went forth
[1:45:53] into the wilderness of Torah. And as
[1:45:56] they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and
[1:45:59] said, me, oh Judah, and ye inhabitants
[1:46:02] of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your
[1:46:05] God. So shall ye be established." Now,
[1:46:09] that's how you get established. But
[1:46:11] believe his prophets,
[1:46:14] and so shall ye prosper. That's how you
[1:46:17] advance is when you believe his
[1:46:20] prophets.
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I just speak this over
[1:46:25] you?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe this. When you
[1:46:28] believe his prophets, it say so shall
[1:46:30] you prosper. I'm going to keep reading
[1:46:31] there. Just let me let me just uh speak
[1:46:33] this. I'm going You going to prosper
[1:46:37] physically.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; You going to prosper spiritually.
[1:46:42] Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; financially
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; and you're going to prosper materially.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was a poor man
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; with two houses.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper physically.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper spiritually.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper financially. And
[1:47:09] you're going to prosper materially.
[1:47:11] That's right.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Believe in the Lord your God,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; so shall you be established,
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; but believe as prophets, so shall ye
[1:47:23] prosper.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Let's keep on reading.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Now, the spirit of the Lord had just
[1:47:29] come upon this man and he prophesied
[1:47:32] about them not having to fight in
[1:47:33] battle. Now, all they had to do is just
[1:47:34] believe that. Just now and again,
[1:47:37] believe that that that that sounds
[1:47:39] right. that prophecy what he just gave
[1:47:41] sounds right.
[1:47:43] It agrees with my spirit and my inner
[1:47:45] man says says amen to that.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; We've had different experiences right
[1:47:50] here in our church. Tongues go forth and
[1:47:52] then somebody would speak the
[1:47:54] interpretation of the tongue. And one of
[1:47:57] them specifically told us open wide your
[1:48:00] mouth and then it said open it wider and
[1:48:04] wider and wider and I will fill it. That
[1:48:08] sounds right to me.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That s that clicks with my spirit and
[1:48:12] I'm open my mouth really wide.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for just uh the same God
[1:48:21] that provide big things.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; He provide little things.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Why not believing for big things?
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Why we got to limit them?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah. I'm My business gonna be so
[1:48:34] blessed. I'mma hire people. I'm going
[1:48:36] have them working for me.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be a blessing to them
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; and they families
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; and their family families. If they need
[1:48:44] benefits, I'm going to offer benefits.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; If they need a 401k,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; I'mma be able to offer 401k. We're going
[1:48:54] to be able to do these things.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not just looking for something just
[1:48:58] to meet my needs. I'm looking for
[1:49:00] overflow.
[1:49:03] Huh? You think you think Microsoft is
[1:49:06] just meeting their needs?

[1:49:53] different than we do.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; A lot of us want to just get a job just
[1:49:57] to meet our needs.

[1:50:02] Yes, sir.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Go beyond that. I mean, don't just get

[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; cuz sometime we get jobs and all they

[1:50:58] touch all of them. Amen.

[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Some sister might come up with a hair
[1:51:05] product
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; that many sisters need all over the
[1:51:08] world.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Some decoration for the hair. And all
[1:51:15] the sisters need it.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Anything God can do.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Take the limits off of God.
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Look. Look at this. Look at this. Look
[1:51:30] at this. I I this this this scripture
[1:51:35] verse 21 says, "And when he had
[1:51:36] consulted with the people, he appointed
[1:51:39] singers unto the Lord, and that should
[1:51:44] praise the beauty of holiness."
[1:51:46] And I say, "Praise the Lord, for his
[1:51:48] mercy endureth forever." When they began
[1:51:50] to sing and and to praise the Lord and
[1:51:53] to praise, the Lord sent ambushments
[1:51:55] against the children of Ammon, Moab, and
[1:51:57] Mount Seier, which were come against
[1:52:01] Judah, and they were smitten. But the
[1:52:04] children of Ammon and Moab stood up
[1:52:06] against the inhabitants of Mount Seier,
[1:52:08] utterly to slay and destroy them. When
[1:52:10] they had made an end of the inhabitants
[1:52:12] of Seier, everyone helped to destroy
[1:52:15] another. So they began to fight each
[1:52:17] other while while while while the
[1:52:19] children of Israel just standing there
[1:52:21] with they they uh their uniforms on
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; and they fighting each other. And can I
[1:52:27] just say this? Maybe you got something
[1:52:28] going on in your job.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; You got multiple people coming against
[1:52:32] you
[1:52:34] because the Bible say that you shall
[1:52:35] prosper.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; That don't mean you're going to lose the
[1:52:38] job.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to keep the job. Don't call
[1:52:41] out. Just show up.
[1:52:44] And when you show up,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; them people that's fighting against you
[1:52:47] might find themselves fighting against
[1:52:49] each other
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; because they got a fighting spirit.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have a fighting spirit. You
[1:52:55] got a be still spirit.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; A be still and know that I am God's
[1:53:01] spirit.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; So let them fight it out.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; They might end up with no job and then
[1:53:05] you have their job.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Don't call out sick. Go to work.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Show up.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Look at this now where verse 23. For the
[1:53:23] children of Amman and Moab stood up
[1:53:24] against the inhabitants of Mount Seir uh
[1:53:26] utterly slay and destroy them. And when
[1:53:28] they had made an end of the inhabitants
[1:53:30] of Seir, everyone helped to destroy
[1:53:32] another. And when Judah came toward the
[1:53:34] watchtower in the wilderness, they
[1:53:35] looked unto the multitude. And behold,
[1:53:38] there were dead bodies fallen to the
[1:53:40] earth. None escaped.
[1:53:42] Look at this. Look at this. Look at
[1:53:44] this. Now, because all these dead bodies
[1:53:48] cannon escape,
[1:53:52] this means
[1:53:54] that there's
[1:53:56] goods.
[1:53:58] Army can't be out there and have no food
[1:54:00] and and have no money and have I mean,
[1:54:03] they got to have something,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; but since there's dead bodies
[1:54:07] everywhere,
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; they can't spend it.
[1:54:12] they can't eat it.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And and they went from running and being
[1:54:17] afraid to just trusting the word of a
[1:54:20] prophet.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And by trusting the word of a prophet,
[1:54:24] the Bible said, you believe God now,
[1:54:26] you're going to be established.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; But if you can believe his prophets,
[1:54:30] you're gonna prosper.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Here it is. Watch this. Now watch,
[1:54:36] watch, watch, watch what happens now.
[1:54:38] Verse 25. When Jehoshaphat and his
[1:54:40] people came to take away the spoil of
[1:54:42] them, they found among them an
[1:54:44] abundance,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; both riches with the dead bodies
[1:54:52] and precious jewels
[1:54:55] which they stripped off for themselves
[1:54:59] more than they could carry away.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; They not stealing.
[1:55:08] This not this is not stealing. These are
[1:55:10] dead people that can't use it. They
[1:55:12] can't use it.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; There's nothing these people can do with
[1:55:15] this.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And if I don't get it, somebody else
[1:55:18] going to come get it.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; So since I'm here,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I might as well get what God got for me.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; And I love the scripture. I mean they
[1:55:33] they they they had precious jewels
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; which they stripped off of themselves
[1:55:39] more than they could carry away.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; It was so much
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; and they were three days and gather. Can
[1:55:51] you imagine that? Going and
[1:55:56] there's more back. Here's more of that.
[1:55:58] But I can't carry no more. go and take
[1:56:00] this and I put it in whatever and then I
[1:56:03] come back and ain't nobody come to touch
[1:56:05] none of my stuff.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you when God got
[1:56:12] something for you,
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; ain't nobody can take it from you.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; And I believe this is a season
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; that God has for us. And there is nobody
[1:56:25] or nothing going to take it from us. We
[1:56:28] shall prosper.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to advance. We're not going
[1:56:35] back. We're going forward.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I'mma be a poor man
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; with two houses.
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why you just believing God for
[1:56:53] one house?
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Why you just stopping there?
[1:56:57] And you Airbnb everybody else house.
[1:56:59] Airbnb your own house.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Everybody else doing it all around you.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And how are they getting into it and you
[1:57:08] can't get into it? There are so many
[1:57:10] ways to make money.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; There there's so many ways to make
[1:57:16] money. Or go to the Airbnb uh site and
[1:57:18] you can look to see what people are are
[1:57:20] actually renting. Look to see the the
[1:57:23] those that's getting the top um the top
[1:57:26] stars. I mean people people not only
[1:57:28] Airbnb uh being houses but

[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; You can buy a second car
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; and turo the car.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; You can rent your car out for people to
[1:57:43] be able to drive and they pay you.
[1:57:47] There is so many ways to make money
[1:57:50] without you going out there and working
[1:57:51] hard.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; My daddy used to say, "Let your money go
[1:57:54] to work for you."
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; You always working for money. Let your
[1:57:57] money now go to work for you. Buy a car
[1:57:59] as an investment.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you another thing. I'm
[1:58:03] I'm all out here now. I'm all out here.
[1:58:06] But but but but when you when you when
[1:58:08] you when you get your tour business
[1:58:10] going real good and they just you know
[1:58:13] pretty much they paying you especially
[1:58:15] if you done paid the car off
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; and you they they paying you now you can
[1:58:19] take the money that you're making in
[1:58:21] Turo and go buy yourself another car.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You can lease it.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; It's a business expense.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:58:32] And now you can drive in your business
[1:58:34] expense and somebody else is paying for
[1:58:36] it.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; But now make sure you put enough money
[1:58:40] in the bank
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; that if something go wrong with the car,
[1:58:43] you can go buy another one and keep it
[1:58:45] going.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Now what if you had two or three cars
[1:58:47] out there like that?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you getting out.
[1:58:53] Work work smarter,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; not harder.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And move up from a car to a house.
[1:59:01] And you ain't got to buy a house. You
[1:59:02] can buy an apartment in a real nice
[1:59:04] place.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And people come just rent that apartment
[1:59:07] all the time. And and and all year
[1:59:09] round, especially, you know, uh what
[1:59:11] they spring break time. Oh, put the
[1:59:14] price up on it because people the kids
[1:59:16] going to want it.

[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about advancing.
[1:59:29] And and this is for believers.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; This for believers.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; We believe it's prophet
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; and it say we going to pro we going we
[1:59:38] have already prospered spiritually.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; We know that. We know. I mean you can
[1:59:43] I'm sorry. We done
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; the Lord done blessed us. We got eyes to
[1:59:47] see and ears to hear. We done pro
[1:59:50] prospered spiritually.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; But what about materially?
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; What about financially?
[1:59:58] Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; What about what about these other areas?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and some of us might be
[2:00:02] in a spot where we done prosper, you
[2:00:04] know, financially,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; but maybe you need to prosper
[2:00:08] spiritually,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And God has promised you that you're
[2:00:13] going to prosper spiritually. I done
[2:00:15] lost my place here on on this. But but
[2:00:17] you going and when when I when I'm quot
[2:00:20] I'm actually quoting a it's a direct
[2:00:22] quote from the prophet when I say that
[2:00:23] he said grow physically,
[2:00:27] spiritually,
[2:00:28] financially,
[2:00:30] and materially. So you might you might
[2:00:32] have already prospered financially, but
[2:00:34] what about what about the other areas?
[2:00:36] And sometimes we get one blessing and
[2:00:38] think that's all God got. No, no, no,
[2:00:39] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We
[2:00:42] ain't done yet. We ain't done yet. We
[2:00:45] ain't done yet.
[2:00:47] Lord, I I was I was just I asked brother
[2:00:50] Solomon for these u services and I
[2:00:53] haven't listened to them all but over in
[2:00:56] Dubai had some meetings last year and
[2:00:58] and and I was just listening and one of
[2:01:00] the pastors he say I'm I'm I'm inviting
[2:01:03] a brother to come to the pull pit to
[2:01:05] preach and um I'm not embarrassed to say
[2:01:09] this about this man. He's coming here to
[2:01:11] preach.
[2:01:13] But this man, God has blessed him. He's
[2:01:16] a millionaire.
[2:01:18] Y'all listen to him preach. Y'all going
[2:01:20] to be listening to a millionaire talk.
[2:01:23] Now, now he didn't have to say that. But
[2:01:25] I'm glad he did. I'm glad he did. I'm
[2:01:28] like, uh,
[2:01:32] what? The man not coming to preach to
[2:01:34] us? not only him but he his sons and
[2:01:38] everything else just flowed from this
[2:01:40] man every everybody blessed in his house
[2:01:43] and I thought to myself said wait a
[2:01:44] minute we we living a little bit too and
[2:01:46] now now it didn't change the way he
[2:01:47] preached
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; what what but what he did do is try to
[2:01:50] show you that you can have the same
[2:01:52] thing if you would apply the same faith
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; and I thought to myself is God only
[2:01:58] moving in Zimbabwe
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I said no God ain't just a God of
[2:02:03] Zimbabwe God is God right here And if we
[2:02:06] need these things, God gonna move and
[2:02:08] and and and do things for us. I I'm just
[2:02:10] I just believe that. But it got to start
[2:02:12] with a word.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you through the
[2:02:17] word of God and God honors his word,
[2:02:20] whatever you're doing, it shall prosper.
[2:02:23] Can I read Psalms one over you?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm running out of time.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Can I read Psalms one over you?
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; I done lost my notes, but I'm going to
[2:02:31] read I'mma just read Psalms. I I don't
[2:02:33] have this in my notes, so I need you to
[2:02:35] pull this up for me, sis. Psalms one.
[2:02:37] And I'm I'm out of time. Let me just go
[2:02:39] ahead and stop this thing right now,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; but I'm going just read Psalms one.
[2:02:45] Blessed
[2:02:47] is the man or the woman
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; that walketh not
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; in the counsel
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; of the ungodly,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; nor standeth
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; in the way of sinners,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; nor siteth
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; in the seat of the scornful. What you
[2:03:11] going to do with this sermon after you
[2:03:12] heard it today? You going to go home and
[2:03:13] criticize it and and what you going to
[2:03:15] do? Are you going to take it and apply
[2:03:16] some faith?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jack is trying to excite us.
[2:03:20] No. No. I No. I want the best for you.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And God wants the best for you. And God
[2:03:25] will anoint a minister with a sermon in
[2:03:28] order to pull out your best.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; But his delight, now this is this is the
[2:03:35] beautiful part. A millionaire come to
[2:03:37] the pool pit,
[2:03:39] but the money ain't changed them.
[2:03:46] Some of us the reason God can't give us
[2:03:47] nothing,
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; we'll be on vacation.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Pastor, I there's a trip I've been
[2:03:53] wanting to take all my life
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; and and I'mma have to miss this Sunday
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; and be gone two weeks
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; because you go all the way on the other
[2:04:03] side of the world. It's hard to just do
[2:04:04] that in one week. So you you go two
[2:04:06] weeks and then then all of a sudden you
[2:04:08] get back for one service and then two
[2:04:10] weeks later you're gone again.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you have an office in the church?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Don't you do something here in the
[2:04:18] church?
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to balance all that
[2:04:21] too.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Don't let the money take control over
[2:04:24] you.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; But his delight and I know this. I know
[2:04:30] a a billionaire
[2:04:34] from Nigeria.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; First thing that man do is he the
[2:04:38] loudest man in the church
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; praising God. And when you see that man
[2:04:42] praising God, he's like, "This man is a
[2:04:43] billionaire."
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; But his delight is in the law of the
[2:04:50] Lord. And and
[2:04:54] the way we found out that man had money
[2:04:56] is that every year he would sponsor 40
[2:05:00] people from Nigeria to bring them over
[2:05:03] here to the states and they would stay a
[2:05:05] month. They would rent a vehicle and
[2:05:08] they'd go from this place to this place
[2:05:09] to this. They go to Jeffersonville. They
[2:05:11] go to um if they want to go to Denver,
[2:05:14] Colorado, they'll go to Denver. They'll
[2:05:16] drive all over the United States for a
[2:05:18] month and visit church after church
[2:05:19] after church. They pay for their living
[2:05:22] arrangements, their food. This man would
[2:05:24] sponsor people every year. Can I ask you
[2:05:27] a question?
[2:05:28] I know you're blessed financially.
[2:05:31] What are you sponsoring?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Have you found anything to give to
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; as far as the work of the work of God is
[2:05:42] concerned? Have you found anything to
[2:05:44] give some of your your your finances to?
[2:05:47] Not just to your f your tithes and
[2:05:48] offering to the church. I'm talking
[2:05:50] about outside of that.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; But when you have overflow, you ought to
[2:05:54] be able to go outside of tithes and
[2:05:55] offering.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's all you got.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; It's just your tithes and offering. God
[2:06:04] done gave you way more than that.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, please Lord, let me let me But
[2:06:08] it's the light is in the law of the
[2:06:10] Lord. And his law doth he meditate day
[2:06:11] and night. I I I I I'm let me let me
[2:06:14] please. I'm out of time.
[2:06:18] We had a we I just had a situation at
[2:06:20] the house.
[2:06:22] Um had some paperwork that needed to be
[2:06:25] signed and there was a a man that need
[2:06:26] to come and notoriize the paperwork that
[2:06:28] I was signing and um and I was getting
[2:06:32] ready to like kind of change my mind in
[2:06:34] this whole situation. But then uh when
[2:06:36] this man walked into the house, we got
[2:06:38] to talking
[2:06:40] uh he was telling me how he had
[2:06:42] developed um cancer on his throat or
[2:06:45] something like that. He was wonder he
[2:06:47] like I didn't do anything for this to
[2:06:49] happen like this. I don't know what what
[2:06:50] this is, but it just kind of came out of
[2:06:52] know my wife went through this and she
[2:06:54] went through that and we got her through
[2:06:55] the situation, but now look at me and I
[2:06:57] don't know if I'mma be here. They don't.
[2:06:59] And he just going on and on sitting
[2:07:00] there at my house. Just sitting there at
[2:07:02] my house. And I realized at that moment
[2:07:05] it wasn't about me signing no papers.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; God just brought this man right into my
[2:07:14] my my pretty much my living room. And I
[2:07:17] say, "Now, I ain't gonna let this man
[2:07:19] leave here."
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Without me sharing something about the
[2:07:23] Lord.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; I know God heals.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; So, I just begin to, you know, just just
[2:07:28] just, you know, inject certain things. I
[2:07:31] said, I said, "Now, you know, uh, God
[2:07:33] brought you to this house and I'm a
[2:07:35] preacher
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; now. You know that now." He said,
[2:07:38] "Yeah." I said, "Now, um, I believe in
[2:07:41] praying for the sick." And let me read
[2:07:43] you a scripture. The Bible say uh we
[2:07:47] shall anoint them with oil and the
[2:07:48] prayer of faith will save the sick and
[2:07:50] the Lord will raise them up. And I say
[2:07:51] this what the scriptures say, you know.
[2:07:53] And then also the scriptures say uh uh
[2:07:55] if we just lay hands on the sick, they
[2:07:58] shall recover. Now actually I didn't
[2:08:00] anoint him with oil because I didn't
[2:08:01] know where his faith was.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; So I got two scriptures I can go to. And
[2:08:05] my my mother-in-law, my wife, they was
[2:08:07] ready to go get oil and just leave him.
[2:08:08] He was going to leave there lthered.
[2:08:13] And I said, "No, no, no. We don't know
[2:08:14] where he at. So I said, "But let me
[2:08:16] quote this scripture. If we just lay
[2:08:17] hands on the sick, they shall recover."
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; I said, "Now the Bible tells us to do
[2:08:23] that." I said, "So now, if you don't
[2:08:24] mind, before you leave here, I want to
[2:08:26] just lay hands on. I just want to pray
[2:08:28] for you." He said, "Sure, sure." He
[2:08:29] started crying. I mean, man, he we got
[2:08:32] to get him tissue and everything. Water
[2:08:35] running everywhere. And uh and as he as
[2:08:37] he crying, he said he just he could feel
[2:08:38] the presence of God. And we just all
[2:08:40] held hands again. He prayed over that
[2:08:42] man with cancer in his body.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yesterday, I'm sitting there and I get a
[2:08:46] text from his wife saying, "My husband
[2:08:48] want to let you know his surgery was
[2:08:49] successful and that uh he going to be he
[2:08:52] can't talk. He can't write right now,
[2:08:53] but he's going to get back in touch with
[2:08:55] you because he really appreciate you all
[2:08:57] praying for him. He can see God moving
[2:08:59] in that prayer.
[2:09:01] [Applause]
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; God be having a much greater purpose in
[2:09:06] the people that he bring us in contact
[2:09:07] with.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; We got to be able to recognize that."
[2:09:09] So, so our our ministry goes beyond just
[2:09:12] these four walls.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Be sensitive to the spirit of God. Let
[2:09:16] me finish reading Psalms one. I got to
[2:09:17] leave. I got to leave. Uh verse three,
[2:09:19] where was I?
[2:09:22] And he shall be like a tree
[2:09:25] planted by the rivers of water. I like
[2:09:30] that. Rivers of water. Rivers means that
[2:09:33] it's going to be multiple sources
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; out of one water but multiple sources
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; ri planted by a tree and she he shall be
[2:09:42] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[2:09:44] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[2:09:47] his season. His leaf also
[2:09:52] I don't care what the season look like.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; His his leaf the one that's a follower
[2:09:58] the one that's a believer
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; the one that's established in God but
[2:10:01] also believe his prophet his leaf also
[2:10:04] shall not wither
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; and look at that one. What a promise.
[2:10:09] What a promise.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; And I let me tell y'all something right
[2:10:13] now. Whatever I do,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; if if I if I get into Turo,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; prosper,
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; if I become a doctor,
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; prosper
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; if I become a pharmacist,
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; prosper.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; If I'm just cutting grass,
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; prosper if I'm in it,
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; prosper. If I'm in the healthc care
[2:10:40] field,
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; prosper. Whatever I do
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; that ain't that ain't my promise. This
[2:10:48] ain't my promise. This is God's promise.
[2:10:50] It's going to prosper.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever you find your hands doing,
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; it's going to prosper.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; It shall not return void.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to prosper.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; I wasn't there
[2:11:07] when David wrote that.
[2:11:15] [Applause]
