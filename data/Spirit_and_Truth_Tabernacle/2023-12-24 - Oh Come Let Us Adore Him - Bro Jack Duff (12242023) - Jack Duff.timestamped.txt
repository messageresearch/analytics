[47:16] testimony uh that's going to be shared
[47:18] typically Wednesday nights and the
[47:19] nights that we really like to do all the
[47:21] testimonies but this one is somebody
[47:23] that I that usually don't testif

[47:29] blessed by what they got to say I'mma
[47:32] ask my nephew
[47:35] Caleb come up and just share
[47:38] testimony this
[47:40] morning
[47:46] amen how y'all doing this
[47:49] morning well I'm gon start off with
[47:51] happy holidays to you all um so about
[47:56] maybe six five months ago um me and my
[48:01] father went out looking for jobs um
[48:03] since I've been back here from Portland
[48:04] it's kind of been hard finding something
[48:06] that's you know worth having so um we
[48:11] were just like today we're going to go
[48:12] and show face stop out all the places
[48:15] that we have in mind and just see what
[48:17] happens
[48:19] um we went to the city
[48:22] Riviera didn't get nowhere with that go
[48:24] online can't really show face for that
[48:28] um stopped by Amazon warehouse tried to
[48:30] show face there they already had their
[48:33] um had their interviews already a few
[48:36] months prior so as we were leaving the
[48:40] Amazon warehouse we just happened to
[48:42] stop in the middle of the street for no
[48:44] apparent reason I'm in the passenger
[48:46] seat wondering why are we stopping in
[48:49] the middle of the street for no reason
[48:52] but I didn't say it just in my mind why
[48:54] are we just sitting here
[48:56] but as we look up we see my sister
[48:59] Candace driving right by all right she
[49:02] stopped right next to
[49:03] us um and we told her what was going on
[49:07] I'm looking for a job trying to see what
[49:09] we can find
[49:13] um she she told us that um she had a guy
[49:17] she knew a guy um and she could probably
[49:20] get me in give me a good look uh well
[49:22] opportunity so we went to her office
[49:25] office she sat me down she called the
[49:28] guy he said yeah I need workers I need
[49:30] somebody um and my sister was like my
[49:33] brother he's a good worker he needs a
[49:34] job um he was like okay um we'll go
[49:39] ahead and we'll do the application right
[49:41] now I'll make sure he gets through right
[49:43] so that was the first blessing the fact
[49:45] that we were out there just sitting in
[49:47] the middle of the road and my sister
[49:50] just came by with that
[49:53] blessing so that was was one um so fast
[49:58] forward um I get the interview um the
[50:02] gentleman was telling me that even
[50:04] though he knows my sister and that he
[50:07] got me into the interview it's a panel
[50:09] interview so it's him and five other
[50:12] guys who've never seen it before so I
[50:14] really have to sell myself um so when I
[50:17] got there I did the
[50:19] interview um I felt like I aced it you
[50:22] know few weeks down the line I end up
[50:25] talking well fast forward I got the job
[50:28] right
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:35] so and it's for the City of West Palm
[50:37] Beach so that was a blessing so
[50:39] something stable
[50:42] so
[50:43] so a few weeks down the line I'm talking
[50:46] to one of my supervisors on like the
[50:49] first week um and he's telling me I
[50:51] don't know if you know this but you're
[50:53] the only one who made it past that
[50:55] process
[50:56] process
[50:58] so
[51:01] so so that was another blessing that I
[51:03] saw from God his gentle hand you know
[51:05] guiding me
[51:06] forward um and in the midst of my first
[51:10] week I don't know if you all I'm pretty
[51:12] sure you all know my grandfather uh
[51:15] granddaddy
[51:17] Roosevelt um he was a gardener he took
[51:19] pride in his gardening and I just
[51:23] happened to be out there one day
[51:24] planting some flowers hours all right
[51:26] and it was probably last weekend where
[51:28] it was real windy gloomy it wasn't
[51:31] looking too pretty um but as I was down
[51:34] there on my knees planting these
[51:37] flowers something came over
[51:39] me and I
[51:43] felt just his
[51:46] touch um and I looked
[51:49] up and in the midst of all that
[51:51] gloominess and wind blowing the wind
[51:54] stopped and the sun seemed like it just
[51:57] came down and beam right on me and
[51:58] touched
[51:59] me so I knew that was God with him
[52:03] letting me know I'm in the right place
[52:05] I'm doing what I need to do so that was
[52:08] another occurrence of his gentle hand
[52:11] guiding me forward Another Blessing in
[52:13] my
[52:14] life
[52:16] um then fast forward maybe a week later
[52:20] they told me the 6:30 time I've been
[52:23] starting was just temporary I start at 6
[52:26] and I've been taking public
[52:27] transportation to get there taking the
[52:30] public transportation from where we live
[52:32] I can't get there by
[52:33] six so I was trying to figure out okay
[52:38] got to find a vehicle maybe cise
[52:42] um my parents blessed me with the
[52:45] opportunity of helping me finance a car
[52:48] so now I have a new vehicle so now I can
[52:50] get to work
[52:53] responsibly hallu
[53:01] so yeah so he's been using his gentle
[53:05] hand in many ways over the last few
[53:07] months to let me know I'm right where I
[53:09] need to be um I've been doing everything
[53:12] I need to do and keep going on the path
[53:14] I'm going um try try to humble myself
[53:18] you know um it took me a while I needed
[53:21] to find myself in order for him to find
[53:24] me amen okay so um it took a little
[53:27] while of you know locking in making sure
[53:30] I got my head right um but in the midst
[53:33] of doing
[53:35] that um I found the right path um and I

[57:58] and uh we see things differently than
[58:01] the rest of the world we realize that
[58:03] our Lord and savior was not born on
[58:06] Christmas day amen but he was born in
[58:10] the spring time when all Lambs are born
[58:15] amen and um but you know nonetheless I I
[58:19] like at this time and I know that people
[58:21] have completely uh taken Christ out of
[58:26] Christmas amen uh we like to put them in
[58:30] and I think it's a perfect time for us
[58:32] to remind the world of what the story
[58:35] really is all about amen it's not about

[58:44] and uh so we want to just read a a
[58:47] scripture that relates to this and I
[58:49] would encourage you tomorrow uh before

[59:16] know I haven't stand in this pull pit on
[59:20] a Sunday morning to preach for y'all for
[59:23] about six weeks
[59:29] so I got a lot of
[59:31] hay on my
[59:33] fork and uh y'all just bear with me let
[59:37] me change this I'm going to go back to
[59:39] Luke to hold your finger there but let's
[59:44] read Revelation
[59:48] 5 then we'll go back to Luke 2 in a
[59:52] second Revelation 5 and it says this and
[59:55] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[59:58] on the
[59:59] throne a book written within and on the
[1:00:02] backside sealed with Seven
[1:00:05] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:00:07] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:00:09] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:00:11] seals
[1:00:12] thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in
[1:00:16] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[1:00:18] to open the book not neither to look
[1:00:22] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:00:25] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:00:28] book neither to look
[1:00:31] thereon and one of the elders saith unto
[1:00:36] me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe
[1:00:39] of Judah the root of David hath
[1:00:43] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:00:45] the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and
[1:00:49] lo in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:00:51] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:00:53] elders stood a land L as it had been
[1:00:55] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:00:58] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:01:01] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[1:01:04] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:01:06] him that sat upon the throne and when he
[1:01:09] had taken the book The Four beasts and
[1:01:12] four and 20 Elders fell down before the
[1:01:14] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:01:17] golden vials full of oders which are the
[1:01:19] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[1:01:23] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:01:27] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:01:29] the for thou was slain and has redeemed
[1:01:31] us to God by thy blood out of every
[1:01:34] Kindred and tongue and people and nation
[1:01:36] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:01:39] Priests and we shall rain on the earth
[1:01:42] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[1:01:44] many angels round about the throne and
[1:01:46] the beasts and the elders and the number
[1:01:48] of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[1:01:52] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:01:54] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:01:57] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:01:59] wisdom and strength and honor and glory

[1:04:41] that and said well that's a confirmation
[1:04:43] for us amen but we want to uh just take
[1:04:47] that thought amen oh come let us adore
[1:04:50] him uh just reading amen the
[1:04:54] a portion of the true Christmas story as
[1:04:58] it pertains to
[1:05:00] scripture uh here in Luke chapter 2
[1:05:05] verse
[1:05:08] um so it's so much I'm going start at
[1:05:11] verse eight I'm going just skip a little
[1:05:12] bit here
[1:05:17] um the Bible says and there were in the
[1:05:20] same country shepherds abiding in the
[1:05:21] field keeping watch over their flock by
[1:05:24] night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[1:05:27] them and the glory of the Lord Shone
[1:05:29] round about them and they were sore
[1:05:32] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[1:05:35] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[1:05:38] of great joy which shall be to all
[1:05:41] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[1:05:47] the city of David a savior which is
[1:05:51] Christ the Lord amen amen uh and this
[1:05:56] shall be a sign unto you ye shall find
[1:06:00] the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
[1:06:04] lying in a manger and I love this and
[1:06:08] suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:06:11] multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising
[1:06:14] God and saying glory to God in the
[1:06:17] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[1:06:21] toward men and it came to pass as the
[1:06:24] Angels were going away from uh from them
[1:06:26] into heaven the Shepherds said one to
[1:06:28] another let us now go even unto
[1:06:31] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[1:06:34] come to pass which the
[1:06:36] Lord hath made known unto us now uh
[1:06:44] I'mma just inject this really quick how
[1:06:47] did the Lord make it known to them it
[1:06:52] was through an
[1:06:55] angel Hallelujah and there are some
[1:06:58] things that the
[1:07:00] Lord has made known unto us and the way
[1:07:05] that we knew it it came
[1:07:08] through an
[1:07:10] angel verse 16 says and they came with
[1:07:14] haste and found Mary and Joseph and the
[1:07:17] Babe lying in a manger and when they had
[1:07:20] seen it they made known abroad the sing
[1:07:22] which was told them conc concerning this
[1:07:25] child and all they that heard it
[1:07:27] wondered at those things which were told
[1:07:30] them by the Shepherds and look at this
[1:07:33] but Mary kept all these things and
[1:07:35] pondered them in her heart and the
[1:07:37] Shepherds
[1:07:38] returned
[1:07:40] glorifying and praising God for all the
[1:07:44] things that they had heard and seen as
[1:07:47] it was told unto them again our thought
[1:07:50] today is oh come let us adore him when
[1:07:55] we talk about adoration amen it's also
[1:08:00] uh can be used the other word that can
[1:08:02] be used is the word worship amen and and
[1:08:06] what worship means is to reverence or
[1:08:09] render homage with body and mind amen uh
[1:08:14] you know different people you see that
[1:08:16] and and I want to tell y'all um you know
[1:08:18] we only give our worship to the Lord we
[1:08:21] only bow before for him nowadays it's
[1:08:26] this people be joking and stuff but I
[1:08:28] don't like to joke amen but you see
[1:08:30] somebody coming just start bowing nuh-uh
[1:08:33] nuh-uh uh-uh don't ever do that that
[1:08:35] don't belong to nobody but
[1:08:39] Jesus amen don't give that to nobody but
[1:08:42] Jesus amen so worship is to reverence or
[1:08:46] render homage uh with body and mind and
[1:08:49] they they they U they were referring to
[1:08:52] a scripture here that I I'll refer to
[1:08:54] later Genesis 225 I got that out of my
[1:08:57] key to the Bible uh in the uner Bible
[1:09:00] dictionary uh this word worship uh the
[1:09:03] Hebrew word is
[1:09:05] shaha shaha amen is to bow down or
[1:09:10] prostrate oneself before another in
[1:09:12] order to do him honor and reverence and
[1:09:15] and I love the second song We sung today
[1:09:17] was Bow Down and Worship Him amen so uh
[1:09:22] prostrate oneself be before another in
[1:09:25] order to do him honor or reverence and
[1:09:28] you know earlier this week I saw a
[1:09:30] little post by Brother Quenton he put
[1:09:32] out there in his social media he quoted
[1:09:34] a scripture amen Psalms 95 and6 the
[1:09:38] scripture says this oh come let us
[1:09:43] worship and bow down hallelujah oh come
[1:09:48] let us worship and bow down let us kneel
[1:09:52] before the Lord our maker the only one
[1:09:56] deserves that reverence and that respect
[1:09:59] amen is the Lord Jesus Christ so let us
[1:10:02] worship and bow down and kneel before
[1:10:05] the Lord our maker amen another thing uh
[1:10:10] that they said here uh as far as a
[1:10:12] definition for this word Worship in the
[1:10:15] anger Bible dictionary says it is a it's
[1:10:18] it's as natural to worship as it is to
[1:10:23] to
[1:10:24] live think about that statement it is as
[1:10:28] natural to worship as it is to live amen
[1:10:34] and uh and and what the feeling and
[1:10:36] expression of high adoration reverence
[1:10:40] trust love loyalty and dependence upon a
[1:10:44] higher power human or Divine is a
[1:10:47] necessity for mankind brother brandom
[1:10:51] gives us a definition for the word
[1:10:53] worship he says to worship is simply to
[1:10:56] express yourself to him amen I like that
[1:11:00] and and and now I'm I'm going to just
[1:11:02] kind of uh walk us through a couple
[1:11:04] things here because I believe worship is
[1:11:07] a verb I believe worship requires action
[1:11:13] hallelujah amen I believe worship
[1:11:16] requires your
[1:11:20] participation amen amen amen and here in
[1:11:24] Psalms 100 verse 1-5 uh we'll look at
[1:11:27] some things here when it comes to this
[1:11:30] this worship oh come let us adore him
[1:11:33] here in Psalms 100 verse 1-5 says Make a
[1:11:37] Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands
[1:11:42] amen serve the Lord with gladness come
[1:11:46] before his presence with singing
[1:11:49] hallelujah amen and when you when you
[1:11:51] singing You Can't Keep keep your mouth
[1:11:55] closed amen you got to actually open
[1:11:58] your mouth in order to be able to sing
[1:12:01] Hallelujah you have never heard of an
[1:12:03] artist a a singer that that that that
[1:12:06] was that recorded an album never opening
[1:12:08] their mouth hello somebody that wouldn't
[1:12:12] be singing that's that's just an
[1:12:14] instrumental Hallelujah but a singer has
[1:12:16] to open his mouth and
[1:12:18] sing hello somebody amen and and you
[1:12:22] know we can't get so uh so so so so so
[1:12:26] uh stuck up on oursel that we can't open
[1:12:28] our mouth and sing to the
[1:12:32] Lord we come here to the house of God to
[1:12:37] worship and we need everybody the
[1:12:39] brothers got to find their part you

[1:13:02] Lord we come here to worship he deserves
[1:13:06] to
[1:13:07] worship hallelujah hallelujah and the
[1:13:10] Bible amen tells us says serve the Lord
[1:13:13] with gladness don't be sad serving God
[1:13:16] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[1:13:20] his presence with singing that mean you
[1:13:22] ain't got to wait for the s leader to
[1:13:24] sing your song you already got a song on
[1:13:26] your heart before you got here come
[1:13:28] before his presence with
[1:13:31] singing know ye that the Lord he is God
[1:13:36] hello it is he that hath made us not we
[1:13:41] ourselves we are his people amen and the
[1:13:44] Sheep of his
[1:13:46] pasture and then here David gives us
[1:13:48] instruction enter into his gates with
[1:13:52] Thanksgiving oh yes hello somebody if
[1:13:56] you said you ain't got nothing to thank
[1:13:57] God for like like brother Andrew Glover
[1:13:59] told us I got 10
[1:14:01] reasons for you to give God glory number
[1:14:07] one all right all and all 10 reasons is
[1:14:11] the same reason he woke me up this
[1:14:13] morning if you woke up this morning got
[1:14:15] in a car drove to the church had gas in
[1:14:19] the car come on somebody you got more
[1:14:23] than enough to give God glory for if he
[1:14:26] watched over your family you got
[1:14:28] something to thank him for if he made a
[1:14:31] way out of nowhere you got something to
[1:14:33] thank him for hey he bless you with a
[1:14:36] job you got something to thank of he
[1:14:39] gave you a car you got
[1:14:45] something you don't need to be quiet on
[1:14:47] them
[1:14:48] now this is the time to give him praise
[1:14:52] and when he ain't gave you you nothing
[1:14:54] you still ought to give him
[1:15:00] praise enter into his gates with
[1:15:05] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[1:15:09] praise the Bible says Be Thankful unto
[1:15:12] him and bless his name and you want to
[1:15:17] know why we do this for the
[1:15:20] Lord is good
[1:15:26] my boss might not be
[1:15:28] good my neighbor might not be good
[1:15:32] sometimes the Saints in the
[1:15:33] church they're not so good but the
[1:15:39] Lord is good his Mercy is
[1:15:44] Everlasting and his truth endureth to
[1:15:48] all
[1:15:50] generations everybody in here from the
[1:15:52] youngest to the old oldest got something
[1:15:55] to give God praise for I invite you this
[1:15:58] morning oh
[1:15:59] come let
[1:16:02] us adore
[1:16:04] him in reading Psalms 100 we can see uh
[1:16:09] that worship is done with an attitude of
[1:16:15] gratitude and here's the other thing
[1:16:18] that I I've come to realize according to
[1:16:20] scripture I won't read it but you can
[1:16:22] find it in 150 amen I like the way
[1:16:25] Marvin sap says it says you don't even
[1:16:27] have to be
[1:16:29] saved to give God
[1:16:31] glory you Ain even got to be a Christian
[1:16:35] to give God glory because Psalms 150
[1:16:39] says let
[1:16:45] everything let everything that has
[1:16:48] breath praise the Lord and Marvin sap
[1:16:51] said look at your neighbor and say
[1:16:52] neighbor
[1:16:54] are you breathing are youa well you
[1:16:57] should be
[1:17:04] worshiping there's a man by the name of
[1:17:06] John Francis
[1:17:08] Wade he made his living copying
[1:17:10] manuscripts by hand and way became
[1:17:14] famous for his artistic
[1:17:17] calligraphy they had a knack for copy of
[1:17:20] music as well Scholars had debated
[1:17:23] whether Wade merely copied the Christmas
[1:17:26] hymn or whether he actually wrote it but
[1:17:29] recent scholarship indicates that he did
[1:17:32] in fact write the
[1:17:34] hymn it was it was originally written in
[1:17:37] Latin as adeste
[1:17:39] Fidelis Wade was a Roman Catholic and
[1:17:43] all services in the church were
[1:17:44] conducted in Latin in
[1:17:46] 1750 He Slipped this hymn that he had
[1:17:50] written He Slipped it into a manuscript
[1:17:53] he was copying for the English Roman
[1:17:55] Catholic College in Lisbon
[1:17:58] Portugal over 30 years
[1:18:01] later
[1:18:03] 1785 it was sent that same little hymn
[1:18:06] that he slipped into a manuscript it
[1:18:08] took 35 years somebody else got a hold
[1:18:10] of it it was sent to the Portuguese
[1:18:13] Chapel in London and the Duke of Leeds
[1:18:16] heard it sung there and included it in
[1:18:19] the repertoire of his own singing group
[1:18:22] it soon became known around the world
[1:18:25] it's so known that we open our service
[1:18:28] with this
[1:18:28] song but when we open that we only sung
[1:18:32] the chorus but there are verses to the
[1:18:35] song and actually you know if if I was
[1:18:37] to ask some of the young people we might
[1:18:39] think that the song is called oh come
[1:18:40] let us adore him but that actually not
[1:18:43] the name of the song the song is called
[1:18:46] Oh Come All Ye
[1:18:51] Faithful so he slipped this in amen a
[1:18:55] little manuscript and it took 30 years
[1:18:57] or over 30 years before somebody found
[1:19:00] it picked it up and began to sing it and
[1:19:04] and and and what he put in there says Oh
[1:19:06] Come All Ye
[1:19:09] Faithful joyful and
[1:19:12] triumphant Oh Come Ye Oh Come Ye to
[1:19:17] Bethlehem come and Behold Him born the
[1:19:23] king of angels then he says oh come let
[1:19:26] us adore him oh come let us adore him oh
[1:19:31] come let us adore him Christ the Lord he
[1:19:37] uh wrote two other verses that I I found
[1:19:39] in in uh uh um you know one says Sing
[1:19:43] choirs of Angels sing in exaltation oh
[1:19:49] sing All Ye
[1:19:50] citizens of of Heaven above and that's
[1:19:54] what happened when you know our Lord and
[1:19:56] savior was born here the angels are
[1:19:58] announcing to the Shepherds that Christ
[1:20:01] was born but there was a host of Heaven
[1:20:03] that joins these angels and they begin
[1:20:06] to sing and brother brandham tells us
[1:20:08] that you know when kings are born people
[1:20:11] sing but here on Earth there was no
[1:20:13] people to sing for our Lord and savior
[1:20:15] being born but the Angels did sing
[1:20:19] Hallelujah here it says glory to God all
[1:20:23] glory in the highest come let us adore
[1:20:25] him come let us adore him oh come let us
[1:20:28] adore him Christ the Lord this other
[1:20:31] verse he wrote thought was very special
[1:20:35] and I can't say that I agree with all
[1:20:36] the words but it says this yay Lord we
[1:20:39] greet
[1:20:40] thee it says born this happy morning no
[1:20:43] he wasn't born on a Christmas morning
[1:20:46] but I I put it like this born a happy
[1:20:50] morning Jesus to thee be all Glory given
[1:20:55] word look at the word there word of the
[1:20:59] father Jesus was the word amen word of
[1:21:03] the father now in flesh
[1:21:07] appearing oh come let us adore
[1:21:11] him come let us adore him come let us
[1:21:16] adore him Christ the lord we're going to
[1:21:20] go back to that verse in a little bit
[1:21:21] later I want read a a statement here
[1:21:24] from the prophet amen out of the sermon
[1:21:26] the uncertain sound amen he makes this
[1:21:30] this statement here and I want to just
[1:21:31] read this quickly to you there is a way
[1:21:35] too that seeth right unto a man but the
[1:21:37] end thereof is the ways of death it is a
[1:21:41] little off the subject but I want to
[1:21:42] dwell on that just a moment pertaining
[1:21:45] Amen to a certain person that I might
[1:21:48] just take in my mind a mythical person
[1:21:51] and name it m Miss John Doe amen this
[1:21:56] Miss John Doe when she was brought up in
[1:21:59] church she was a fine woman she loved
[1:22:02] God oh she went to church with her
[1:22:05] mother she was taught to do what was
[1:22:08] right now God give us more of those
[1:22:10] oldfashioned mothers that'll teach their
[1:22:12] girls and boys how to do right to know
[1:22:15] right from wrong that's what we need
[1:22:18] today we got too many other kind of
[1:22:20] examples before our young people such as
[1:22:23] smoking drinking carousing and so forth
[1:22:26] that ought not to be amen and it's it's
[1:22:30] uh uh is by mothers socalled sometimes
[1:22:34] mothers are setting the wrong examples
[1:22:35] he says now notice in the human body our
[1:22:39] makeup our regular Anatomy that we live
[1:22:42] in here is not made to
[1:22:46] sin amen your your your your your human
[1:22:49] body was not made to sin look at this
[1:22:53] amen it says it's made to do righteous
[1:22:56] you were made for that created to do
[1:22:58] righteous it's made to serve God God NE
[1:23:02] never made you just to work and come
[1:23:05] home and love your children now watch if
[1:23:08] he said that's all good enough God made
[1:23:11] you to work God made you to come home
[1:23:13] love your children love your wife and
[1:23:15] the wife to be loyal and love her
[1:23:16] husband the children love their father
[1:23:18] and mother that's all good watch this it
[1:23:21] says but God made that's just background
[1:23:24] for something that God made you to do
[1:23:27] amen God made
[1:23:29] you to be a
[1:23:32] worshiper amen a worshiper of him and
[1:23:36] look at this now you worship something
[1:23:39] because it's in man to worship it's in
[1:23:42] him to do that you worship something
[1:23:44] regardless of what it is you worship
[1:23:46] your
[1:23:47] wife look at what the prophet say now
[1:23:49] you worship your children all right you
[1:23:53] worship anything your
[1:23:56] automobile my God you worship your
[1:23:59] pleasure you worship something because
[1:24:01] it's in mankind to worship now we want
[1:24:03] to know what we worship he goes on to
[1:24:07] say this Jesus told the woman at the
[1:24:10] well you worship you know not what we
[1:24:12] Jews we worship we know what we worship
[1:24:14] uh we know that we worship God cuz
[1:24:16] salvation is of the Jew now and then the
[1:24:18] woman began to explain to him how one
[1:24:21] said an amount to one said Jerusalem he
[1:24:23] said the hour is coming I like this and
[1:24:26] now is when the father will seek
[1:24:28] worshippers who will worship Him in
[1:24:30] spirit and in truth for God is spirit
[1:24:33] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:24:35] Him in spirit and Truth now you know I
[1:24:40] was you know we can see here that uh
[1:24:43] through this statement you're going to
[1:24:44] worship
[1:24:46] something I mean you know often times uh
[1:24:50] you know we worship our children we put
[1:24:51] them before God
[1:24:53] God if we worship our wife or we worship
[1:24:56] our husband we put them before God right
[1:24:58] sometime you worship your career you put
[1:25:01] your career before God it's God that
[1:25:03] blessed you with the job right hello
[1:25:05] somebody amen all of you got a new car
[1:25:08] and all of a sudden you just want to
[1:25:09] take off going everywhere and it's
[1:25:10] always on Sunday that you want to make
[1:25:12] your
[1:25:14] drive you don't go nowhere on Saturday
[1:25:17] but Sunday I got to take it for a drive
[1:25:19] take it for a drive to church amen amen
[1:25:23] you got you got to put God first in
[1:25:25] everything in life you got to worship
[1:25:28] something why not give God his
[1:25:31] worship here you know um you know as I
[1:25:34] was just kind of pondering this and
[1:25:36] thinking through this amen it's
[1:25:38] important to know that your worship is
[1:25:40] being accepted the children of Israel
[1:25:43] worshiped one time a golden calf and
[1:25:45] that was not accepted amen the children
[1:25:48] of Israel also worshiped baale one time
[1:25:50] and had to be restored back to the true
[1:25:52] worship of The One and Only God Amen uh
[1:25:56] Cain worshiped one time and his worship
[1:25:59] was not accepted amen balam built altars
[1:26:03] but that type of worship was not
[1:26:05] accepted and there was one time even in
[1:26:07] the camp of Israel there was a man by
[1:26:10] the name of Dayan that built himself a
[1:26:11] church he had a tabernacle and he
[1:26:14] invited people there he say Moses you
[1:26:15] ain't an only one hear from God but we
[1:26:17] hear from God too but but they found out
[1:26:19] that that Tabernacle was not being
[1:26:22] accepted by God got swallowed up into
[1:26:24] the Earth we want to make sure that our
[1:26:26] worship is being accepted when Jesus had
[1:26:30] the conversation with the woman at the
[1:26:32] well regarding worship amen he told her
[1:26:36] the father was looking for some to
[1:26:37] Worship in spirit and in truth and and I
[1:26:40] want to just I want to make it clear
[1:26:42] that Hallelujah worship was not just
[1:26:44] related to a physical
[1:26:46] place oh hallelujah amen not just the
[1:26:50] mountains of Samaria or the mountains of
[1:26:52] Jerusalem amen even though our church
[1:26:56] name is spirit and truth it's not
[1:26:58] related just to a physical Place hello
[1:27:01] somebody worship is not even amen
[1:27:03] limited to one day in the week but
[1:27:07] worship is something that we give him
[1:27:08] every day yes sir 24 hours a day seven
[1:27:11] days a week we worship with our lives we
[1:27:14] worship with our actions we worship amen
[1:27:17] and when we come to church we worship
[1:27:19] when we leave church we're always
[1:27:21] worshiping God on your job you
[1:27:24] Worship in school you worship wherever
[1:27:28] you go you
[1:27:31] worship here spirit and Truth is is not
[1:27:35] a physical place and I and I I I I I ask
[1:27:40] the question then where is Spirit and
[1:27:42] truth if God is looking for someone to
[1:27:45] worship him where is Spirit and
[1:27:48] truth
[1:27:50] hallelujah spirit and Truth can only
[1:27:52] only be
[1:27:53] found in
[1:27:54] Christ it's a spiritual place that can
[1:27:57] only be found in Christ when we look at
[1:28:02] this word worship talking about come and
[1:28:05] let us adore him when we look at this
[1:28:07] word worship I was looking at something
[1:28:10] in scripture and the very first time
[1:28:12] that the word worship is used in
[1:28:14] Scripture it is in Genesis
[1:28:18] 22 oh my Hallelujah Genesis
[1:28:22] 225 is where we find it the very first
[1:28:27] time that it's mentioned but amen here
[1:28:32] um we have a a a a situation where
[1:28:35] Abraham has been told by almighty God to
[1:28:38] to take this son that I have promised
[1:28:42] you and amen I said that you know in him
[1:28:44] Nations G to be blessed and everything
[1:28:46] it says I promised you I gave him to you
[1:28:48] but I take this boy and give him back to
[1:28:50] me Hallelujah
[1:28:52] now when when Abraham left home that
[1:28:55] morning just in my amen thoughts I just
[1:28:59] don't think Abraham told Sarah what he
[1:29:03] was about to
[1:29:06] do I don't think Sarah knew this hello
[1:29:10] somebody sometime you can't tell your
[1:29:13] right hand what your left hand getting
[1:29:15] ready to
[1:29:17] do but I don't think Sarah knew exactly
[1:29:20] what was going on not only did not Sarah
[1:29:22] know but when you when we read there in
[1:29:24] the scripture even the people that were
[1:29:26] with Abraham had no idea what was
[1:29:29] getting ready to
[1:29:30] happen I love this I love this I love
[1:29:33] this but here they ask Abraham a
[1:29:36] question in Genesis 22 and5 it says
[1:29:40] Abraham said unto his young
[1:29:42] men abide ye here with the ass and I and
[1:29:46] the lad will go
[1:29:48] Yonder oh my my my my my I love this is
[1:29:53] prophetic word from Abraham I and the lb
[1:29:56] will go Yonder and
[1:29:59] worship and come again to you now he
[1:30:02] knows that God told him to offer this
[1:30:04] boy on that altar but Abraham speaks by
[1:30:08] faith I'm going amen up this mountain me
[1:30:12] and my son we're going to go worship
[1:30:15] Hallelujah but we coming back to y'all
[1:30:17] again amen and what I find Amen in this
[1:30:21] in this particular passage scripture
[1:30:23] amen uh worship sometimes Demands a
[1:30:29] Sacrifice it don't always feel
[1:30:33] good you ain't going to always be happy
[1:30:37] when you worship but but but worship
[1:30:39] sometimes Demands a Sacrifice and here's
[1:30:42] what I find amen the circumstance don't
[1:30:44] have to be perfect for you to give God
[1:30:48] worship
[1:30:50] H amen it ain't a't got to be working in
[1:30:52] your favor for you to give God
[1:30:58] praise see the circumstance may not be
[1:31:01] perfect but the Declaration of Praise
[1:31:05] demonstrates the position of the heart
[1:31:08] of the
[1:31:09] believer I'm going say that again the
[1:31:12] circumstance may not be
[1:31:17] perfect but the but the but the
[1:31:19] Declaration of praise
[1:31:22] demonstrates the position of the heart
[1:31:25] of the
[1:31:27] believer see job lost everything he had
[1:31:31] children were gone animals were gone
[1:31:34] money was gone even his body was being
[1:31:36] wrecked with
[1:31:38] pain but the Bible said job bowed his
[1:31:42] faith before God and he
[1:31:46] worship I'mma tell you something when
[1:31:48] you're going through one of the best
[1:31:50] things you can ever do is just begin to
[1:31:58] worship worship changes
[1:32:01] atmospheres worship changes
[1:32:04] circumstances worship changes your
[1:32:07] outlook worship is a powerful tool in
[1:32:11] the hands of the believer when he begins
[1:32:14] to worship it's
[1:32:18] God even when I don't feel like it
[1:32:25] amen sometime worship going to require a
[1:32:31] sacrifice but it shows the position of
[1:32:33] the heart of the
[1:32:36] believer It Ain't Easy sometime you
[1:32:39] you're so down in your spirit it's hard
[1:32:41] to get words out of your mouth but just
[1:32:43] open them
[1:32:44] anyway come let us adore
[1:32:46] him you just start talking about him his
[1:32:50] presence comes near you start singing
[1:32:53] about him his presence comes near
[1:32:56] there's something about
[1:33:05] worship also in the Book of Genesis we
[1:33:08] would see there was another time of
[1:33:10] worship let's pull this up out of show
[1:33:11] us to father and it
[1:33:15] suffices Adam and Eve would Worship in
[1:33:17] the cool of the
[1:33:20] evening came and Abel offered their
[1:33:23] sacrifices in worship to
[1:33:25] God we know Abel's offering was accepted
[1:33:29] but Cain's was rejected here brother
[1:33:32] brandom says look in the beginning when
[1:33:33] Cain and Abel were turned from the
[1:33:35] garden their parents and they both
[1:33:38] seemed they were mortal beings and
[1:33:40] knowing they had to die look Cain and
[1:33:42] Abel both of them wanted to worship
[1:33:45] God Cain he built an altar to God now if
[1:33:49] an altar is all that God requires Cain
[1:33:52] was
[1:33:53] justified and Cain made a sacrifice upon
[1:33:55] the altar is that right well if a
[1:33:58] sacrifice and an altar is all God
[1:34:03] wants Cain was
[1:34:05] justified sometimes they not just uh you
[1:34:08] know a sacrifice and altar no no God God
[1:34:11] want God wants your
[1:34:13] heart God wants your
[1:34:15] life look amen he says this then Cain
[1:34:19] also uh he built an altar he worshiped
[1:34:22] he put a sacrifice on it and he knelt
[1:34:24] down and worshiped God but God was
[1:34:28] displeased because he didn't come the
[1:34:31] right way see he built the church an
[1:34:35] altar he put a sacrifice on the altar
[1:34:37] brought the fruits of the land was
[1:34:39] probably more beautiful but but you must
[1:34:42] watch this friend don't never forget
[1:34:43] this and see you know and and this is
[1:34:45] this is the thing there's many people
[1:34:47] going to church today and my uh
[1:34:50] Hallelujah and and they got all kind of
[1:34:52] Christmas programs and all kind of
[1:34:53] things going but you know God might not
[1:34:55] be accepting everything that everybody
[1:34:57] doing it it's got to be done in spirit
[1:34:59] and in truth hello somebody amen so so
[1:35:04] so we know that H our our forefathers C
[1:35:07] uh uh uh Cain I mean uh uh Adam Eve uh
[1:35:11] Cain Abel all of them worship it's just
[1:35:13] in man it is in man it's in woman to
[1:35:16] worship something what we want to do is
[1:35:19] worship God
[1:35:21] that's it I found that as I just read in
[1:35:25] Genesis 225 the the word itself worship
[1:35:27] the very first time it was found in
[1:35:29] scriptures gen Genesis 225 but we also
[1:35:32] find Amen in Genesis I'm sorry
[1:35:34] revelation 22 the the end of the Bible
[1:35:37] the first book of the Bible the last
[1:35:38] book of the Bible this word worship is
[1:35:40] found here and we find it in the very
[1:35:42] last chapter of the Bible we find a
[1:35:45] problem here with Worship in this verse
[1:35:49] Revelation 22:8
[1:35:52] and
[1:35:54] N want to make sure we're putting our
[1:35:56] worship in the right
[1:35:57] direction here the Bible says and I John
[1:36:00] saw these things and heard them and when
[1:36:04] I heard and seen I fell down to worship
[1:36:07] before the feet of the Angel which
[1:36:09] showed me these things wait a minute
[1:36:11] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:36:13] minute we we have a problem here now now
[1:36:16] I need you to understand John represents
[1:36:18] the bride all right revelation 22 and
[1:36:21] verse eight and say he said now now the
[1:36:23] Bible actually tells us that that John
[1:36:25] uh says when I when I heard and seen I
[1:36:29] fell down to worship before the feet of
[1:36:31] the Angel which showed me these things
[1:36:35] now now we're not here to worship the
[1:36:39] angel Hallelujah somebody amen we're not
[1:36:42] here to worship any we thank God for the
[1:36:45] angel but we're not going to give no
[1:36:47] glory to the
[1:36:49] angel and and here's here's the other
[1:36:51] thing I like about the a true angel will
[1:36:54] do this what he just did to John verse n
[1:36:57] then sayith he unto me see thou do it
[1:37:02] not for I am thy fellow servant and of
[1:37:05] thy Brethren the prophets and of them
[1:37:07] which keep the Saints of this book
[1:37:14] worship
[1:37:18] God give me the quote out of the fifth
[1:37:21] SE let's just read this really
[1:37:25] quick worship is showing homage bowing
[1:37:30] down before somebody and we find John
[1:37:33] doing this representing the bride but
[1:37:36] John got back up on his feet because he
[1:37:39] was corrected by the angel hello and I'm
[1:37:43] going to read you a quote where the
[1:37:45] angel corrected the people and hopefully
[1:37:48] they'll get back up and and put their
[1:37:49] Worship in the place that is supposed to
[1:37:51] be in and that's on the Lord Jesus
[1:37:55] Christ look at
[1:37:57] this in the 56 says have you caught
[1:38:00] anything he says I was just wondering if
[1:38:03] you was I might not have to tell you
[1:38:06] this Sunday notice notice now and then
[1:38:09] according to the time that God was going
[1:38:11] to deliver the anti Delian world he sent
[1:38:15] the eagle and the time he was going to
[1:38:17] deliver Israel sent the eagle do you
[1:38:21] believe that that that the time even on
[1:38:23] John on the aisle of Patmos the message
[1:38:26] was so perfect that he couldn't he
[1:38:28] couldn't trust it with an angel you know
[1:38:29] an angel is a messenger but do you know
[1:38:32] the messenger was a prophet all right
[1:38:35] watch says do you believe that let's
[1:38:37] prove it revelation 22 see let's see if
[1:38:39] it was an eagle sure he was an eagle he
[1:38:42] was a messenger but it was a prophet
[1:38:44] that revealed this whole book of
[1:38:45] Revelation to him Revelation the 22nd
[1:38:49] chapter and the 19th verse and he he
[1:38:51] says I believe that's right I've got it
[1:38:52] written down here Revelation uh 22:19 I
[1:38:55] may be wrong no 229 now that's what is I
[1:38:59] was looking looking at 22:9 that's right
[1:39:01] oh yes then sayith the eny see thou do
[1:39:03] it not for I am thy fellow servant of
[1:39:05] thy brother and the prophets watch what
[1:39:07] John seen here John I John saw these
[1:39:10] things and heard them now he's closing
[1:39:11] it this is the last chapter and when he
[1:39:14] says I heard and seen I fell down to
[1:39:15] worship before the feet of the Angel
[1:39:17] which showed me these things and then
[1:39:18] the angel amen then he see then then say
[1:39:22] the unto me see thou do it not no true
[1:39:26] Prophet Hallelujah would be worship or
[1:39:30] messenger of any
[1:39:34] kind I like that I say that again no
[1:39:37] true Prophet would be worshiped or
[1:39:40] messenger of any kind amen then he said
[1:39:43] unto me see thou do it not for of thy
[1:39:45] fellow servants and of thy Brethren the
[1:39:47] prophets and of them that keep the
[1:39:48] sayings of this book you know there is
[1:39:50] uh uh preachers nowadays they're not
[1:39:53] even prophets they pastors and they they
[1:39:56] love when the church worships
[1:39:59] them they love it they enjoy it do all
[1:40:02] kind of crazy things in the church I
[1:40:04] mean it's going on right now in the
[1:40:05] ranks of this
[1:40:07] message but but and and I'm going tell
[1:40:09] you this right now if you ever find
[1:40:11] yourself visiting one of these churches
[1:40:12] because you don't know everywhere you go
[1:40:13] you I'm just going over here sometimes
[1:40:15] it's good to call and ask Pastor about
[1:40:17] the church before you go jumping up in
[1:40:19] there
[1:40:21] hello somebody you get a spirit on you
[1:40:23] before you know it but some of these
[1:40:25] churches in the message they worship

[1:40:28] Pastor oh
[1:40:30] Hallelujah I mean you know all kind of
[1:40:33] all kind of nonsense I ain't G to go

[1:40:43] evangelist amen we don't worship no
[1:40:45] pastor we don't worship no Apostle we
[1:40:48] worship God
[1:40:55] I like
[1:40:56] this I wrote just a few notes Here John
[1:41:00] had to be corrected Amen in his worship
[1:41:04] and we don't worship holy men or holy
[1:41:06] women uh we worship God we don't worship
[1:41:08] our jobs our careers or our families we
[1:41:11] worship God we don't worship we don't
[1:41:14] worship creation wood or stone we
[1:41:17] worship a living God our worship is
[1:41:21] reserved for God and God Alone Oh come
[1:41:25] let us adore
[1:41:29] him let's read amen a couple scriptures
[1:41:33] here since we have time um Matthew 2 is
[1:41:39] another scripture that refers
[1:41:41] to this Christmas amen
[1:41:45] season now just so that we have the the
[1:41:47] record
[1:41:49] straight this is a story of the Magi but
[1:41:51] the Magi did not show up on the day that
[1:41:54] Jesus was born the Magi came actually
[1:41:57] roughly two years later we'll find here
[1:42:01] in the scripture that the Magi did not
[1:42:03] find Jesus in a manger the Shepherds did
[1:42:06] but the Magi didn't the Magi actually
[1:42:09] found him in a house that's right
[1:42:11] Hallelujah so so so when you see these
[1:42:14] little scenes amen that everybody got
[1:42:16] they got a little mixed up they're not
[1:42:18] really following the scripture but
[1:42:19] nonetheless we get a to talk about these
[1:42:22] things so I'm grateful for the
[1:42:25] opportunity here in Matthew amen chapter
[1:42:28] 2 the Bible says now when Jesus was born
[1:42:31] in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
[1:42:34] Herod the king behold there came wise
[1:42:36] men from the East to Jerusalem saying
[1:42:39] where is he that is born King of the
[1:42:43] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[1:42:47] east and and and look at I love this why
[1:42:50] are are they coming Matthew chapter 2
[1:42:53] verse two amen says saying where is he
[1:42:57] that is born King of the Jews for we
[1:42:58] have seen a star in the east and are
[1:43:01] Come Oh Glory to God they they're
[1:43:04] they're coming with a
[1:43:07] purpose oh Hallelujah when you come to
[1:43:09] church you should be coming with a
[1:43:14] purpose it's okay to have a new dress
[1:43:18] it's okay to have a new suit but that's
[1:43:20] not the purpose the purpose is to
[1:43:24] worship and even when amen My Worship
[1:43:28] amen Demands a Sacrifice of me I'm still
[1:43:31] going to give
[1:43:33] worship I'm G to open my mouth and I'mma
[1:43:37] give him praise I can always find a
[1:43:40] thank you
[1:43:41] Jesus amen I can always find a thank you
[1:43:46] Jesus I can always find a lord I Love
[1:43:49] You Lord Lord I praise you somewhere in
[1:43:53] the service I can give them one of them
[1:43:56] amen Lord you've been good to
[1:43:59] me oh Hallelujah but here the the wise
[1:44:03] men are coming amen with a purpose
[1:44:05] they're coming to worship him look at
[1:44:08] this the next verse
[1:44:09] says when Herod the king had heard these
[1:44:13] things he was
[1:44:14] troubled all Jerusalem with him and when
[1:44:18] he had gathered all the chief priests
[1:44:19] and scribes of the people to together he
[1:44:21] demanded of them where Christ should be
[1:44:26] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[1:44:30] of Judea for thus it is written by the
[1:44:32] prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land
[1:44:35] of Judea art not the least among the
[1:44:38] princes of Judah for out of these shall
[1:44:41] come a governor that shall rule My
[1:44:44] People Israel so now so here they're
[1:44:46] going back to Old Testament scripture
[1:44:49] and they're finding amen exactly where
[1:44:52] Christ was supposed to be born what got
[1:44:54] the city all stirred up is these three
[1:44:56] visitors that's am man walking through
[1:44:58] the city and and and they're being led
[1:45:01] by a star to get here to the city and
[1:45:04] when they get there they they come with
[1:45:06] uh I mean these guys have a conviction
[1:45:09] where is

[1:45:16] that was born King of the Jews where is
[1:45:19] he I mean every they went to the the
[1:45:21] corner store and asked where is he went
[1:45:24] to the well and asked where is he
[1:45:26] somebody here got to know where he
[1:45:29] is man it stirred up everybody in the
[1:45:32] city who are these guys and why are they
[1:45:34] asking this question well they finally
[1:45:37] open up the scripture and they really
[1:45:38] they realized that amen there was
[1:45:40] supposed to be somebody born a Christ
[1:45:44] the the the the Savior the Redeemer was
[1:45:46] supposed to be born and here the the the
[1:45:48] the the wise men were able to recognize
[1:45:50] said by the star not a star went out
[1:45:52] when they got to
[1:45:56] Jerusalem but the light came back on
[1:45:59] when they got to
[1:46:00] Bethlehem let's just finish reading
[1:46:04] this glory to
[1:46:07] God Amen verse uh verse five again they
[1:46:10] said to him it in Bethlehem of Judea for
[1:46:12] thus it is written by the prophet thou
[1:46:14] Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not
[1:46:17] the least among the princes of Judah for
[1:46:19] out of thee shall come Governor thou
[1:46:21] shall rule My People Israel then Herod
[1:46:23] when he had prively called the wise men
[1:46:27] inquired of them diligently what time
[1:46:29] the star
[1:46:31] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[1:46:33] and said go and search
[1:46:38] diligently Oh My My

[1:49:17] intentions let's read this
[1:49:22] I don't even know what verse I stopped
[1:49:23] on but let me keep
[1:49:25] reading verse eight
[1:49:27] okay that I may come and worship him
[1:49:30] also when they had heard the king they
[1:49:32] departed and lo the star which they saw
[1:49:34] in the East went before them until it
[1:49:36] came and stood over where the young
[1:49:38] child
[1:49:40] was when they saw the
[1:49:42] star they rejoiced with the seed and
[1:49:44] great
[1:49:46] joy and when they would come into the
[1:49:49] house they saw the young child with
[1:49:50] Mary's mother and fell down and look at
[1:49:54] this and worshiped him see he's the only
[1:49:58] one worthy to be
[1:50:01] worshiped and when they had opened their
[1:50:05] Treasures they presented un him gifts
[1:50:07] gold and frankincense and myr and being
[1:50:10] warned of God in a dream that they
[1:50:11] should not return to herro they departed
[1:50:13] into their own country another way now
[1:50:16] brother brandom helps us to understand
[1:50:18] this amen and these wise men brought
[1:50:22] very specific gifts to the Lord Jesus
[1:50:25] and again as we just read it was in the
[1:50:27] house that they found him not in the
[1:50:28] manger so they didn't come at the time
[1:50:30] of his birth the Shepherds did but the
[1:50:32] wise men came two years later amen while
[1:50:35] he was a little child and and they
[1:50:37] brought these gifts the gold the gift of
[1:50:39] gold that they brought brother brandham
[1:50:41] says it represented his deity as king of
[1:50:44] kings his
[1:50:46] supremeness is why they brought gold the
[1:50:49] fr frankincense amen was used in service
[1:50:53] offering you find it in Leviticus 2 you
[1:50:56] find it in Leviticus 16 verse 6- 15 and
[1:50:59] it said we find out that that's the
[1:51:01] order of the priesthood to make an
[1:51:03] offering to Jehovah when he made the
[1:51:06] offering and had to be made and mixed
[1:51:07] with frankincense for a sin offering
[1:51:09] they took different things and mixed it
[1:51:11] for the meal offering for the wave
[1:51:12] offering frankincense was added because
[1:51:14] it was acceptable to Jehovah if it was
[1:51:17] anointed with frankincense which means
[1:51:19] it was was a service to Jehovah his go
[1:51:23] the gold representing his deity the
[1:51:25] frankincense mix representing amen the
[1:51:28] service that he'll have for Jehovah and
[1:51:31] myrrh the reason that they gave him myrr
[1:51:34] amen is because that was an anointing
[1:51:36] for
[1:51:38] death brother brandham says he was
[1:51:41] deity in
[1:51:44] service to
[1:51:46] die this is what the real meaning of
[1:51:48] Christmas is all about
[1:51:51] deity was in
[1:51:53] service to die now my question
[1:51:59] is
[1:52:00] when the shepherd showed
[1:52:04] up they brought worship and adoration to
[1:52:07] the Lord at his birth when the wise men
[1:52:12] showed up they came two years later but
[1:52:14] they also brought worship and adoration
[1:52:17] and both of these incidents Hallelujah
[1:52:20] let me just see if I'm where I want to
[1:52:22] be yes both of these incidents amen they
[1:52:27] brought worship based on what they had
[1:52:31] seen and what they
[1:52:33] heard come on work with me now just for
[1:52:36] a little bit but but the Shepherds amen
[1:52:39] they were in the field watching their
[1:52:40] flock and and you know it took an angel
[1:52:44] from God to come down and reveal to them
[1:52:47] where Christ was if the Angel would have
[1:52:50] never showed up hello they would have
[1:52:54] never amen come in contact with Christ
[1:52:57] they would have never been there at that
[1:52:59] manger if a angel would not have
[1:53:01] directed them to where they needed to go
[1:53:04] they got there and and and we read it in
[1:53:06] the scripture said we'll read it Again
[1:53:08] Luke 2 and20 let me just read it real
[1:53:10] quick so you're with me Luke 2 and20 the
[1:53:12] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[1:53:16] praising God for all the things that
[1:53:19] they heard
[1:53:20] heard and
[1:53:22] sing as it was told unto them Hallelujah
[1:53:26] they heard from an angel they heard a
[1:53:29] host from Heaven joining him and singing
[1:53:31] about Christ birth and since they heard
[1:53:34] it they went to find where Christ was
[1:53:37] Hallelujah and they got very specific
[1:53:39] instruction from the angel based on what
[1:53:41] they heard based on what they saw with
[1:53:43] this Angel amen this is why they went to
[1:53:46] worship I want to say that again based
[1:53:49] on B on what they heard based on what
[1:53:51] they saw based on their experience this
[1:53:54] is why they went to
[1:53:58] worship the wise men had an experience
[1:54:01] they were watching a star brother
[1:54:03] brandom tells us that they were just
[1:54:05] looking at the scriptures and and they
[1:54:07] knew that a star would rise amen based
[1:54:10] on the scriptures and when they saw that
[1:54:11] they begin to unpack everything that
[1:54:13] they had and they begin to get ready for
[1:54:15] a journey didn't realize how long it
[1:54:16] would take but they went to Jerusalem
[1:54:18] following a Star based on what they saw
[1:54:23] when they got to Jerusalem they pulled
[1:54:25] out the scripture and they say in
[1:54:27] Bethlehem is where you're going to find
[1:54:29] Once the word of God was read to them
[1:54:31] this is what they heard it took them
[1:54:34] right into the presence of Jesus the
[1:54:36] star brought them into proximity but the
[1:54:39] revelation of the word brought them into
[1:54:42] the
[1:54:43] presence I'm going to say that again the
[1:54:45] star brought them into proximity but the
[1:54:49] revelation and the revealed word brought
[1:54:51] them into the
[1:54:54] presence they worship based on what they
[1:54:57] sing a star and then when the word was
[1:55:00] revealed to them they worship on what
[1:55:02] they
[1:55:04] heard the Shepherds worship on what they
[1:55:08] seen and they heard the wise men worship
[1:55:12] on what they
[1:55:13] sing and what they heard and I'm here to
[1:55:16] tell you this morning the reason that we
[1:55:18] worship is because of what we
[1:55:21] seen and what we
[1:55:24] heard I want to just I want to inject
[1:55:27] this if there's ever a group of people
[1:55:30] on the Earth that need to give their
[1:55:34] worship to the Lord Jesus is this group
[1:55:37] that knows the message of the
[1:55:40] hour oh Hallelujah let me let me just
[1:55:44] read
[1:55:44] a a little quote here for you aen coming
[1:55:48] out of the message Revelation chapter
[1:55:49] chapter 5 oh hallelujah hallelujah

[1:56:18] back to that I read it
[1:56:20] and um I want to just just give you just
[1:56:28] a
[1:56:30] John in Revelation
[1:56:33] five was
[1:56:35] worshiping based on what he
[1:56:40] seen and
[1:56:44] heard the Shepherds worship based on
[1:56:47] what they seen and
[1:56:50] heard the wise men worship based on what

[1:58:01] is and how he was made manifest how when
[1:58:05] that seal was open how we begin to
[1:58:08] understand now how that he was the son
[1:58:10] of God he was God himself made flesh and
[1:58:14] the revelation of who he is that should
[1:58:16] be finished before the angel can put his
[1:58:18] feet upon the land and sea and swear
[1:58:20] that there there'll be time no more when

[2:00:45] want to he made that statement now I
[2:00:46] want to just take us back to the
[2:00:48] scripture and let me finish it here
[2:00:49] let's go back to Revelation five because
[2:00:51] based on what John
[2:00:53] saw based on what John heard it caus him
[2:00:57] to worship now I'm going tell you
[2:01:01] something what John saw if you ever get
[2:01:04] a
[2:01:05] glimpse of what he saw it would trigger
[2:01:09] such a worship in
[2:01:11] you that nobody be able to take it away
[2:01:13] from
[2:01:15] you let's look at it again Revelation 5
[2:01:18] look at it and I saw in the right
[2:01:21] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[2:01:23] book written within and on the backside
[2:01:26] seal with Seven
[2:01:30] Seals I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[2:01:33] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[2:01:35] the book and to loose the seals
[2:01:38] thereof now what John sees is something
[2:01:40] very hopeless watch this no man in
[2:01:44] Heaven Nor in
[2:01:47] Earth neither under the Earth Earth was
[2:01:50] able to open the book neither to look
[2:01:52] there
[2:01:54] on look at what John does and I wept
[2:01:57] much because no man was found worthy to
[2:02:00] open and to read the book neither to
[2:02:02] look there on this book was the book of
[2:02:05] redemption and John realized that if no
[2:02:07] if there's nobody able to take this book
[2:02:09] all creation is
[2:02:12] lost it was important that somebody step
[2:02:14] forth and take this
[2:02:17] book Abraham was there couldn't take the
[2:02:23] book Jeremiah Was there couldn't take
[2:02:25] the book Isaiah was there couldn't take
[2:02:27] the book Paul Peter there couldn't take
[2:02:31] the book John couldn't take the book
[2:02:34] William brand was there couldn't take
[2:02:35] the book you were there couldn't take
[2:02:38] the
[2:02:41] book John began to cry look at
[2:02:44] this one of the elders said unto him
[2:02:47] weep not so see B based on what he heard
[2:02:50] based on what John heard it triggered
[2:02:54] worship when the elders spoke to him and
[2:02:56] said we not the lion of the tribe of
[2:02:59] Judah the root of David have prevailed
[2:03:01] to open the book and to loose the seven
[2:03:03] seof and I beheld I like this and lo in
[2:03:08] the midst of the throne and the four
[2:03:09] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[2:03:11] stood the lamb see John turned to look
[2:03:13] for a a lion but when he saw a lamb what
[2:03:17] he heard and what he saw produced a
[2:03:20] worship inside of John what we have
[2:03:23] heard what we have seen had should
[2:03:25] produce a worship inside of
[2:03:29] us you see you see let me let me let me
[2:03:31] put this way the the the
[2:03:33] the the
[2:03:35] Shepherds rejoiced because of his
[2:03:38] birth but they had no idea what else was
[2:03:42] getting ready to come from this child
[2:03:44] say the songwriter say Mary Did You
[2:03:47] Know
[2:03:49] that your baby boy was going to be the
[2:03:52] savior of all creation Mary did you know
[2:03:56] and I can tell you based on scripture
[2:03:57] she had no
[2:04:00] idea CU Mary denied the Virgin
[2:04:04] birth when she lost her son rather than
[2:04:06] just admitting you wrong and you lost
[2:04:09] your son hello you should have your
[2:04:12] father and I I see he said wait wait
[2:04:13] wait wait wait wait did not you know
[2:04:16] that I was going to be about my father
[2:04:19] business he the word had to correct that
[2:04:25] error
[2:04:27] here John was discouraged but when he
[2:04:30] got this this this this message from the
[2:04:33] the elders saying don't cry John don't
[2:04:35] cry because the lion of the tribe of
[2:04:37] Judah Judah has prevailed and when John
[2:04:39] looked what he saw what he saw was a
[2:04:41] lamb look at it verse verse six and I
[2:04:45] beheld and low in the midst of the
[2:04:46] throne and of the four beast and in the
[2:04:48] midst of the Eld stood a lamb as it had
[2:04:50] been slain a bleeding bloody
[2:04:56] lamb having seven horns and seven eyes
[2:04:58] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[2:05:01] forth into all the Earth and he came and
[2:05:02] took the book out of the right hand of
[2:05:04] him that sat upon the
[2:05:07] throne and when he had taken the book
[2:05:10] The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders
[2:05:12] fell down before the lamb having every
[2:05:14] one of them Harps and golden vows full
[2:05:16] of odors which are the prayers of of the
[2:05:18] Saints and they
[2:05:20] sung a new song I want to just pause
[2:05:24] there just for a second because you know
[2:05:29] uh brother Brandon made the statement
[2:05:30] that I just
[2:05:31] read uh I read it to you it says when
[2:05:34] all the mysteries of the church age was
[2:05:36] finished and all the mysteries of the
[2:05:38] plans of redemption then Seven Seals was

[2:05:42] look it's time for all everything in
[2:05:45] heaven everything on Earth to worship
[2:05:48] God
[2:05:49] now I said this as message
[2:05:53] Believers if there is anybody on the
[2:05:57] face of this Earth that ought to know
[2:06:00] how to Worship in spirit and in
[2:06:04] truth it ought to be

[2:06:23] ones that can

[2:15:56] you verse verse nine says and they sung
[2:16:00] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[2:16:03] take the book and open the seals thereof
[2:16:05] for thou was slain and H has redeemed us
[2:16:07] to God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[2:16:10] and tongue and people and nation and has
[2:16:12] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[2:16:15] and we shall reign on the Earth
[2:16:18] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[2:16:20] many angels round about the throne and
[2:16:22] the beasts and the elders and the
[2:16:23] numbers of the of them was 10,000 times
[2:16:26] 10 thousands and thousands of th
[2:16:28] thousands of thousands saying with a
[2:16:29] loud voice now they weren quiet with
[2:16:32] their
[2:16:34] praise the bible say that with a loud
[2:16:36] voice they said wor is the Lamb that was

[2:16:42] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[2:16:44] and blessing Hallelujah and see let me
[2:16:48] tell you something you know uh s sister
[2:16:50] Dixon just entered into this
[2:16:52] scripture Lord she just did the same
[2:16:55] thing John did Hallelujah because the
[2:16:58] very next verse say look let me tell you
[2:16:59] your worship is not when you participate
[2:17:01] in Worship You G to Make Some
[2:17:05] Noise you you go you going to disturb
[2:17:09] somebody and let me tell you your
[2:17:11] worship is not even worship until you
[2:17:13] don't cause somebody to criticize
[2:17:16] you
[2:17:21] y'all didn't hear that but your worship
[2:17:24] has not even reach the worship level
[2:17:27] until you Calla somebody to criticize
[2:17:30] you because Paul said I worship God in a
[2:17:34] way they call
[2:17:37] hey
[2:17:43] crazy but when John saw what he saw and
[2:17:48] when John heard what he heard it caused
[2:17:51] John to enter into
[2:17:55] worship verse
[2:17:57] 13 and every
[2:18:01] creature which is in heaven can you
[2:18:05] imagine this worship what this man is

[2:18:32] your
[2:18:33] mouth
[2:18:35] blessing and
[2:18:37] honor and glory and power I think he
[2:18:41] just ran out of
[2:18:43] words amen be unto him that sth upon the
[2:18:47] throne wrong oh my my my my my and unto
[2:18:51] the lamb forever and ever and the four
[2:18:54] Beast said
[2:18:56] amen fell down and the and the 4 and20
[2:18:59] Elders fell down and worship him that
[2:19:00] liveth forever and ever John based on
[2:19:02] what he saw based on what he heard
[2:19:06] caused him to enter into a a place of
[2:19:09] worship that everything on the earth
[2:19:11] everything under the Earth everything
[2:19:13] above the Earth everything heard John
[2:19:16] praise God and there's John represented
[2:19:18] us and if there's ever a group of people
[2:19:21] that need to worship God on a way that's
[2:19:22] called here
[2:19:23] see you are that group based on what you
[2:19:27] have seen and based on what you have
[2:19:33] heard one last
[2:19:36] quote come let us adore him that man had
[2:19:40] no idea that that song was going to be
[2:19:42] sung 300 years
[2:19:45] later little church in the school they
[2:19:48] come out singing your song right before
[2:19:50] Christmas on Christmas Eve man had no
[2:19:52] idea glory to God and and some of the
[2:19:55] songs that that that some of the Saints
[2:19:56] have written right here in our midst
[2:19:58] many of them songs I called out I know
[2:20:00] it's others out there that write but you
[2:20:01] know what sometime you got to just kind
[2:20:03] of think about the gifts that God has

[2:20:49] that same Christ Hallelujah let the
[2:20:51] fundamentalists let them people who deny
[2:20:53] the power of God say it's wrong but the
[2:20:54] same power that spoke the world into
[2:20:56] existence is in those people that's got
[2:20:58] the Holy
[2:21:00] Ghost that's right men and women it's
[2:21:02] time that we find out who you
