[1:00:16] amen sometimes it's good to have your

[1:01:48] morning
[1:01:49] boy y'all make it hard for a preacher to
[1:01:51] stay in that back room
[1:01:54] when y'all get to cutting up like that
[1:01:55] i'm like lord i ain't finished looking
[1:01:57] at my little nose but i'm ready to come
[1:01:59] on
[1:01:59] i don't know what's going on i can't see
[1:02:02] but troy like he tearing the building
[1:02:04] down
[1:02:05] by his cell
[1:02:08] all right when i came in he was looking
[1:02:10] tired there's something about when you
[1:02:12] get back here that anointing strikes you
[1:02:14] boy you'd be wanting to tear up
[1:02:16] something you could hardly contain
[1:02:17] yourself
[1:02:19] let's look at uh uh the book of saint
[1:02:22] john
[1:02:23] chapter one we'll we'll read the first
[1:02:26] maybe two verses skip down to the 14th
[1:02:28] and then we'll look in the book of
[1:02:30] philippians
[1:02:32] it says in the beginning was the word
[1:02:34] and the word
[1:02:35] was with god and the word was god the
[1:02:38] same in the beginning
[1:02:39] with god 14 verse and it says in the
[1:02:43] word was
[1:02:44] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:02:47] beheld his glory the glory of
[1:02:50] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:02:52] grace and truth
[1:02:54] and now let's just look over in the book
[1:02:56] of philippians
[1:02:59] chapter 2 we want to read the fifth and
[1:03:03] sixth verse it says let this mind
[1:03:06] be in you which was also in christ jesus
[1:03:11] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:03:13] not robbery
[1:03:14] to be equal with god but made himself of
[1:03:18] no reputation that took upon him the
[1:03:20] form of a serpent
[1:03:21] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:03:24] being
[1:03:24] fashioned as a man he humbled himself
[1:03:28] and became obedient to even the depth of
[1:03:31] the cross
[1:03:32] may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:03:33] reading of his word this morning you may
[1:03:35] be seated
[1:03:36] um i want to use this morning as a as a
[1:03:40] topic uh what kind of uh people should
[1:03:43] we
[1:03:44] be now i i've kind of uh
[1:03:47] gone back and forward uh this week
[1:03:50] i thought i'd preach on a thought
[1:03:53] pertaining to the rapture
[1:03:55] this was my kind of my initial thought
[1:03:57] but then somebody wrote me a little
[1:04:00] something
[1:04:00] early part of the week and then i
[1:04:02] thought maybe i'll go that direction but
[1:04:05] you know when i started studying uh
[1:04:08] it just wasn't flowing so i said well
[1:04:11] i'll kind of um
[1:04:14] come back to our original thought now
[1:04:16] y'all just kind of bear with me
[1:04:18] for a little minute you know brother jew
[1:04:20] who used to talk about being a
[1:04:22] helicopter
[1:04:23] i've never been a helicopter i'll
[1:04:26] start out a little slow and then i pick
[1:04:29] up
[1:04:29] steam and then i just kind of ride and
[1:04:32] then i just float us on down
[1:04:34] so y'all just bear with me because we
[1:04:36] want we want to we want to um
[1:04:38] try to bring something that will help us
[1:04:42] um we i'll tell you what i don't know
[1:04:44] about you all but we've been having some
[1:04:46] wonderful services
[1:04:48] it's been some some wonderful
[1:04:51] uh word preach we appreciate brother um
[1:04:55] kwaku um on last week and
[1:04:58] you know brother jack has been doing a
[1:05:00] tremendous job
[1:05:01] and and just trying to transform
[1:05:06] uh our thinking right
[1:05:09] help helping trying to help us to
[1:05:12] you know uh really understand who we are
[1:05:16] and redemption and really what what this
[1:05:19] this word that's been given to us us in
[1:05:22] this hour is really all about
[1:05:25] uh we've we've made it about a
[1:05:28] man right we me
[1:05:31] y'all don't stop on me now we've made it
[1:05:34] about brother branham and things of that
[1:05:36] nature but i believe
[1:05:37] god used the messenger to
[1:05:40] to bring us something to show us
[1:05:44] who we are amen and
[1:05:47] and what what really this is all about
[1:05:49] we we
[1:05:50] messed it up he didn't mess it up
[1:05:52] humanity has done this and
[1:05:55] i thank god for the inspiration of the
[1:05:57] holy spirit is trying to
[1:05:59] uh straighten things out and keep a
[1:06:02] balance
[1:06:03] we because see one thing about the devil
[1:06:06] right if he if he can't get you on one
[1:06:08] thing he'll just try to push you
[1:06:10] overboard on something else and things
[1:06:12] of that nature
[1:06:13] so we we we thank i thank god for the
[1:06:16] inspiration of the spirit of god
[1:06:19] trying to help us to keep it keep a
[1:06:21] balance
[1:06:23] right uh uh and and keep things right
[1:06:26] down the middle of the road
[1:06:28] so that we can understand uh
[1:06:31] really spirits from a spiritual
[1:06:33] standpoint
[1:06:35] uh who we are right so often i
[1:06:38] i'm reminded of brother wes can he he
[1:06:40] used to always talking about talk about
[1:06:43] us living beneath our privilege and i
[1:06:46] and i believe that right i believe
[1:06:49] that that you know uh two things
[1:06:52] i believe that we're living belief uh
[1:06:54] privileges but
[1:06:56] i also believe that uh we're
[1:06:59] transitioning we're moving into
[1:07:01] something that's tremendous
[1:07:05] boy that didn't go over well
[1:07:09] how many people can say imagine that i
[1:07:12] believe now i want you to believe with
[1:07:15] me
[1:07:16] no this is not a trick i believe we're
[1:07:19] moving into
[1:07:20] something by revelation that's
[1:07:24] tremendous
[1:07:27] something that's taken us to higher
[1:07:29] heights and deeper depths
[1:07:32] right glory to god this is what i
[1:07:35] believe
[1:07:36] that's taking place uh and and why we've
[1:07:39] been
[1:07:39] we've have been given the word of god in
[1:07:42] the
[1:07:43] hour that that we're living right
[1:07:46] amen and and another scripture that i i
[1:07:50] constantly hold on to
[1:07:52] is is that faith comes by hearing
[1:07:55] and hearing by the word of god so uh i
[1:07:58] believe the more
[1:07:59] we hear these things i believe the more
[1:08:03] we're becoming come on
[1:08:07] what we're hearing
[1:08:10] i'm becoming what i'm hearing
[1:08:14] as as god quickens the
[1:08:18] the revelation of what's being preached
[1:08:22] i am becoming that
[1:08:26] i'm not becoming what the devil tried to
[1:08:28] tell me
[1:08:30] i'm becoming what the word is telling me
[1:08:34] i am who the words say that i am
[1:08:38] i'm a king this morning i'm a priest
[1:08:42] this morning
[1:08:44] i'm the head and not the tail i'm above
[1:08:47] and not
[1:08:48] beneath amen i'm a lending not a
[1:08:52] borrower
[1:08:53] because that's what the words say that i
[1:08:55] am this morning
[1:08:56] hey man uh i you know i just refuse to
[1:09:00] feel sorry for myself
[1:09:05] walk around and have a pity party don't
[1:09:08] pity me
[1:09:08] pity the devil brother browner makes a
[1:09:11] statement in the seventh church age he
[1:09:13] talked about
[1:09:14] pitying pitying the lay out of sins
[1:09:19] right come on but don't pity brother
[1:09:21] smiley this morning
[1:09:23] cause i ain't pitying myself
[1:09:27] is that right i believe by the
[1:09:28] revelation of the word i'm becoming what
[1:09:31] uh the word has has for ordained for
[1:09:35] all of us to become we we
[1:09:38] we're becoming whether whether we fully
[1:09:41] some of us
[1:09:42] on different levels this morning right
[1:09:45] amen and may not fully comprehend
[1:09:49] some of these things but don't worry
[1:09:51] about that because you're gonna
[1:09:53] understand it i remember i remember 30
[1:09:56] years ago and i
[1:09:57] i remember being in a meeting and
[1:09:59] brother coleman he made that statement
[1:10:02] he says you know he he read it from the
[1:10:04] message and even the scripture talks
[1:10:06] about it
[1:10:07] you know uh uh he says you you're gonna
[1:10:10] understand it and this this is during a
[1:10:13] time
[1:10:14] in our life where we shouted we we cried
[1:10:17] we had a good time
[1:10:18] and and we would go to the meetings and
[1:10:21] we would exhaust our resources and
[1:10:24] everything
[1:10:24] else and come back you know and didn't
[1:10:27] fully
[1:10:28] understand
[1:10:31] sister burns she know what i'm talking
[1:10:33] about mr burroughs um years and years
[1:10:36] ago we used to work for the same company
[1:10:39] and uh we had went to a meeting and uh
[1:10:42] we shouted we had we always had a good
[1:10:44] time at the meetings and uh
[1:10:46] we came back and i was i was at a break
[1:10:49] and
[1:10:49] i guess she was going on break and i was
[1:10:51] standing out there and i'm a
[1:10:53] newer convert than what they were you
[1:10:55] know and uh
[1:10:57] she said uh she actually said brother
[1:10:58] somalia i i i i want to ask you
[1:11:01] something and i said okay go ahead
[1:11:04] she said uh she she stunned me
[1:11:07] she said what is what is seven to seven
[1:11:10] thunders
[1:11:13] i stopped for a minute and i could just
[1:11:15] repeat what everybody cried sister
[1:11:18] she kind of smiled to herself but then
[1:11:21] you know
[1:11:22] but but you know break it down a little
[1:11:24] bit i can do it now but back then but
[1:11:27] the prophecy is what i'm getting at
[1:11:30] right he said we're going to understand
[1:11:33] it
[1:11:35] and we can say we understand this
[1:11:37] morning
[1:11:39] right it's it's it's not a mystery
[1:11:43] it's a revelation divine mystery truths
[1:11:47] contained
[1:11:47] that was contained in the seal and this
[1:11:49] is what we're feeding on
[1:11:52] listen church the word of god is not in
[1:11:55] a
[1:11:55] mystery to the believer
[1:11:58] y'all keep praying for me i ain't even
[1:12:00] got where i want to go at
[1:12:02] y'all might change my whole message this
[1:12:04] morning
[1:12:05] it's not in a mystery it's something
[1:12:09] that's been revealed
[1:12:11] and constantly unfolding to us
[1:12:14] giving us strength okay let me let me
[1:12:17] let me change
[1:12:19] change direction because i don't want to
[1:12:21] go that way um
[1:12:22] i i was i was thinking about this and i
[1:12:25] was studying this and i preached this
[1:12:27] years and years ago
[1:12:29] um in okeechobee and it struck my heart
[1:12:33] this week and i thought we
[1:12:35] bring it out because it's it's a a
[1:12:38] tremendous
[1:12:39] tremendous thought uh one of the things
[1:12:42] even the prophet of god he he
[1:12:45] he made a statement talking about uh
[1:12:49] jesus christ and the disciples and
[1:12:52] you know in his ministry he was just
[1:12:55] trying to
[1:12:56] really uh uh show them what he was
[1:12:59] trying to bring them into
[1:13:01] right and i thought it's the same thing
[1:13:05] it's the same thing today it's the same
[1:13:07] thing that when brother branham
[1:13:09] was on the scene he was only trying
[1:13:12] to uh bring us to a understanding
[1:13:17] of who we are because because
[1:13:20] we down through down through the age
[1:13:23] understanding had gotten
[1:13:25] lost and it was so much error
[1:13:28] in the scripture that that the only way
[1:13:32] that we could
[1:13:33] ever you know really come back to
[1:13:36] uh uh or manifest we
[1:13:39] got the cat to come back to the world
[1:13:43] because if if the word produced a
[1:13:46] certain kind of church in the beginning
[1:13:49] right it would take that same kind of
[1:13:52] word
[1:13:53] uncompromised pure to produce
[1:13:56] the same kind of church listen church
[1:13:59] let me tell you something
[1:14:01] god is not looking amen for
[1:14:04] a different kind of church than what he
[1:14:07] started
[1:14:08] out with if he started out with a
[1:14:11] pentecostal
[1:14:12] church he's going to end up with a
[1:14:15] pentecostal church
[1:14:17] not a denomination though
[1:14:21] experience the same kind of signs
[1:14:24] the same kind of wonders the same kind
[1:14:27] of miracles
[1:14:29] the same kind of order the same type of
[1:14:31] everything
[1:14:32] this amiga church because of the word
[1:14:36] seed that was sown will come to fruition
[1:14:40] amen right how many believe that
[1:14:44] brother branham he takes uh saint john
[1:14:47] chapter one all right and he
[1:14:51] he brings out a tremendous thought here
[1:14:54] he he talks about you know uh
[1:14:57] theologians and
[1:14:58] seminary teaching um um
[1:15:01] they could only bring you to genesis one
[1:15:03] and one in the beginning god created
[1:15:06] you know this that in the other six days
[1:15:08] of creation
[1:15:10] but in his in his his
[1:15:14] thinking he takes us
[1:15:17] beyond uh
[1:15:21] the spoken word right because we know
[1:15:24] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:15:26] but then he brings this understanding
[1:15:29] but it's going to get good after a while
[1:15:32] he he brings us an understanding
[1:15:36] to show us before
[1:15:39] the the word was right it had to be a
[1:15:43] thought now i'm gonna take my time this
[1:15:45] morning
[1:15:46] i'm gonna read a little bit um
[1:15:50] so y'all bear with me i want to set it
[1:15:51] up and and if if
[1:15:53] we have to pull off for the reading and
[1:15:55] preach it's in my heart
[1:15:57] we'll do that but sometimes and and if
[1:16:00] we have to do that
[1:16:01] go back to the word may flesh 1954
[1:16:05] uh tremendous read maybe pick up round
[1:16:09] you know versus uh 160 something
[1:16:12] and and really read it i'm telling you
[1:16:15] do it anyway because it's going to bless
[1:16:16] your heart
[1:16:17] because i know sometimes i talk fast and
[1:16:19] i
[1:16:21] inspiration takes us uh different places
[1:16:25] but he says um in in breaking into this
[1:16:29] scripture
[1:16:30] and taking us beyond genesis one and one
[1:16:34] back to the the thoughts of god
[1:16:38] right everything that we see
[1:16:42] was was was a thought of god
[1:16:46] expressed god
[1:16:49] thought it god spoke it and it
[1:16:53] materialized
[1:16:56] and i started thinking it's like what
[1:16:59] what is brother branham trying to get us
[1:17:01] to you know
[1:17:02] see here i'm like this this is powerful
[1:17:07] right now remember what we've been we
[1:17:09] started out with
[1:17:10] we're we're kind of living below our
[1:17:13] privileges
[1:17:15] and he being he being the mouthpiece of
[1:17:18] god
[1:17:19] is trying to elevate us into a place
[1:17:23] that we can operate differently
[1:17:28] right we can we we can express
[1:17:32] something a life that's on a greater
[1:17:34] level
[1:17:36] right amen church i'm telling you i'm
[1:17:39] i'm be
[1:17:39] can i be real with you not just me
[1:17:41] included we're not
[1:17:43] operating where we're supposed to be
[1:17:45] operating
[1:17:48] i'm telling you i was thinking on
[1:17:50] another thought that i had
[1:17:52] um stand still and see the salvation of
[1:17:55] the lord uh
[1:17:56] i got so many different little thoughts
[1:17:58] and i was thinking
[1:17:59] you know the the moment something
[1:18:02] happens
[1:18:03] in our life the first thing we do is
[1:18:06] we we approach things carnally first
[1:18:12] we approach things in our feelings and
[1:18:14] in our emotions
[1:18:15] and our this and that we don't we don't
[1:18:18] necessarily
[1:18:19] operate as as as
[1:18:22] masters
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:27] we don't we don't because if
[1:18:30] if if you say something or you offend me
[1:18:33] i
[1:18:33] automatically first
[1:18:37] right because you know uh of the gates
[1:18:40] us being triune beings and things of
[1:18:42] that nature right
[1:18:44] uh the the outside the inside
[1:18:47] automatically my
[1:18:49] ears and my eyes and those are the
[1:18:52] inlets
[1:18:54] right even though i'm a son of god
[1:18:57] i haven't fully conquered those realms
[1:19:01] yet
[1:19:03] right see jesus jesus one thing about it
[1:19:07] too jesus
[1:19:08] jesus uh he came in a different form
[1:19:11] than we did
[1:19:12] we bypassed our theophany to be tested
[1:19:15] and tried
[1:19:17] right amen to be become overcomers but
[1:19:21] uh
[1:19:22] when when things happen automatically
[1:19:26] i i automatically operate calmly
[1:19:32] a lot of times before the spirit got to
[1:19:35] come in
[1:19:36] and talk to me after a while
[1:19:40] right but we should be as
[1:19:44] christians now we still going somewhere
[1:19:47] uh operating from a different
[1:19:52] place because we supposed to be
[1:19:54] mastering
[1:19:55] circumstances and situations
[1:19:59] if something is happening right or it's
[1:20:02] something that's been said
[1:20:04] it's it's happened and been said because
[1:20:07] god allowed it
[1:20:08] right amen for our benefit
[1:20:13] right for our benefit to just really
[1:20:16] because sometimes we think more highly
[1:20:17] of ourselves than we ought to
[1:20:20] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:20:21] sometimes we think we we're super
[1:20:22] spiritual until
[1:20:24] you know especially if it's happening to
[1:20:25] somebody else we get real super
[1:20:27] spiritual
[1:20:28] until the thing comes to our door and
[1:20:30] then we lose all spirituality
[1:20:32] all right y'all gotta preach with me
[1:20:34] this morning
[1:20:36] when it's happening to brother smiley we
[1:20:38] super spiritual but when it starts
[1:20:39] happening to you oh praise god please
[1:20:42] church break with me
[1:20:44] where your spirituality at now it's at
[1:20:47] your house it's at your door it's
[1:20:48] your it's your children come on i'ma
[1:20:51] leave that alone this morning
[1:20:53] i believe that ain't that ain't my mess
[1:20:55] but see y'all get quiet on me y'all
[1:20:57] start pulling
[1:20:59] that gift will go to operate uh
[1:21:02] but but i'm trying to i want to try to
[1:21:04] bring us
[1:21:05] into something that i i i think that's
[1:21:08] tremendous and
[1:21:09] and brother branham and and
[1:21:12] uh bringing this out he he makes a
[1:21:16] statement he starts to show us
[1:21:18] the kind of church that we ought to be
[1:21:22] because because he he he makes a a
[1:21:25] a statement you know as as he's
[1:21:29] bringing these things out in in verse 81
[1:21:32] he said what kind of people should we
[1:21:34] be right if the whole if the very holy
[1:21:38] spirit
[1:21:39] has us so embodied or empowered
[1:21:42] that then he start but uh
[1:21:45] talking about thought but i'm getting
[1:21:46] ahead of myself and so
[1:21:49] and and thinking about you know the
[1:21:52] thought and and
[1:21:55] us coming to this place it's like
[1:21:59] what's the vehicle
[1:22:02] that that we must take to bring
[1:22:05] us right
[1:22:09] to bring us to a place that that
[1:22:12] we operate the way
[1:22:16] uh uh that we're supposed to be
[1:22:18] operating
[1:22:19] that we can bring what he's talking
[1:22:21] about into fruition
[1:22:24] right so so let's let's look at
[1:22:28] let's look at that uh for for uh
[1:22:31] a moment right um
[1:22:35] you can't get around it right it's kind
[1:22:38] of like
[1:22:39] the tower of babel you know you you
[1:22:42] can't bypass the atonement
[1:22:45] right uh you you just got to come god's
[1:22:48] provided way
[1:22:50] this this is this is something that i'll
[1:22:52] hold on my entire ministry
[1:22:54] since virginia tell you i say this at
[1:22:57] least a couple of times a month
[1:22:59] i don't know if they ever got tired of
[1:23:01] me saying it but
[1:23:03] it's always been what i believe
[1:23:06] you you you can't come your own way i've
[1:23:09] heard
[1:23:09] people kindly say you know uh there's
[1:23:13] there's many ways to god
[1:23:14] it's not he said i'm the way
[1:23:18] i'm the door and that you can't get
[1:23:21] there
[1:23:22] if you try to bypass me even in one
[1:23:26] scripture says
[1:23:27] you know he sit down invitation
[1:23:30] and one fella he thought i could slide
[1:23:32] in a window
[1:23:34] and and and and you know uh the
[1:23:38] the individual was like look wait a
[1:23:41] minute
[1:23:42] how did you get in here
[1:23:45] right he felt like he could bypass the
[1:23:48] process
[1:23:49] and he'll be all right y'all gonna
[1:23:51] preach with me
[1:23:53] but then he was found out see
[1:23:56] he thought that he could he could come
[1:23:58] another way
[1:24:00] and and and and he was exposed because
[1:24:03] everybody that came through the door
[1:24:06] got a rope
[1:24:09] everybody in there looked the same
[1:24:12] he was odd because he came amen another
[1:24:16] way
[1:24:17] right brother that's right right and he
[1:24:20] was kicked out
[1:24:22] see so so you can't bypass the processes
[1:24:27] you know i hear i you know sometimes i i
[1:24:30] listen to how much time do i have
[1:24:33] sometimes i listen to young preachers
[1:24:35] nowadays and
[1:24:36] and and we've we you know i don't tell
[1:24:40] people what to do with their time
[1:24:41] and i know we got all these different
[1:24:43] resources but i thank god for the holy
[1:24:45] spirit
[1:24:46] you know you you look a lot of the
[1:24:48] younger guys especially around the
[1:24:50] revealed word that
[1:24:52] had raised up you know you you start
[1:24:56] getting inspired from the from the
[1:24:58] outside right and and to me
[1:25:03] that has been the detriment of the young
[1:25:06] ministers
[1:25:07] that were coming up because they were
[1:25:10] inspired
[1:25:12] contrary to the word
[1:25:15] right you you got to come back to the
[1:25:18] bible
[1:25:20] right this is what the prophet of god uh
[1:25:22] taught us
[1:25:23] back the pentecost back to the beginning
[1:25:26] you gotta find out amen
[1:25:29] uh uh um he's god or he don't change
[1:25:33] what god did in the beginning
[1:25:37] was sufficient
[1:25:40] right but we've gotten to the place
[1:25:42] where we you know this
[1:25:43] is the millennial i don't care what
[1:25:46] generation this
[1:25:47] is no matter what generation this
[1:25:51] is it does not supersede the world
[1:25:55] we're talking about we're dealing with
[1:25:57] an infinite god
[1:25:59] a god that could predestinate
[1:26:04] who who knew what what what uh
[1:26:07] a year that i would come come to him
[1:26:10] knew amen the day i would be born the
[1:26:13] hour of the very minute
[1:26:15] he knew i was gonna be bald head brother
[1:26:17] solomon before i lost all my head
[1:26:21] he knew you would me too
[1:26:24] i remember when i met brother solomon
[1:26:26] years and years and years ago before he
[1:26:28] went to
[1:26:29] uh uh carolina he had a head full of
[1:26:31] hair like me
[1:26:33] now we both bought here all our hairs on
[1:26:37] our chin
[1:26:38] and around our face praise the lord
[1:26:41] it'll grow right here i had to cut that
[1:26:43] thing off last night
[1:26:44] i said man it won't do nothing
[1:26:50] but we we have these ideas that because
[1:26:53] we're dealing with millennials what
[1:26:55] makes millennials
[1:26:57] uh any different than baby boomers
[1:27:00] a lot of priests whitman now or any
[1:27:03] other
[1:27:04] the named generations that uh we have
[1:27:09] huh what what makes them because the
[1:27:12] bible says really not much
[1:27:14] uh new under the sun right maybe things
[1:27:18] might have a different twist
[1:27:20] to it but and we're dealing with an
[1:27:22] infinite
[1:27:23] god god knew and this is why
[1:27:26] god knew that what he he give the people
[1:27:30] would would transcend and and stand the
[1:27:34] test of time
[1:27:36] amen right right if it brought a
[1:27:39] conversion and a change in a
[1:27:41] transformation
[1:27:42] in this individual and this is what the
[1:27:45] prophet taught
[1:27:46] right it'll do the same thing when the
[1:27:49] next
[1:27:52] cause there's another generation coming
[1:27:54] on every day
[1:27:57] right we get we millennials what that
[1:28:00] got to do with it
[1:28:02] then what about the generation after
[1:28:04] y'all i don't even know what the name is
[1:28:06] i looked it up a while back but i don't
[1:28:07] forgot
[1:28:08] right huh
[1:28:12] ginzi okay then they're saying
[1:28:15] well you you you millennials
[1:28:19] we we the ginseng
[1:28:23] the jesse or ginseng or whatever
[1:28:27] we're we're in they strutting around
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:31] with agency huh y'all gotta talk to me
[1:28:34] up in here
[1:28:36] glory to god and and and and you know
[1:28:40] we we more advanced than you millennials
[1:28:43] and they get their arguing back and
[1:28:45] forth and
[1:28:46] and with we're talking about the author
[1:28:49] of the book
[1:28:52] we talking about an infinite law
[1:28:56] we talking about a knowledge that
[1:28:58] supersedes all
[1:29:00] generational knowledge
[1:29:03] the bible says men will be running to
[1:29:06] and fro
[1:29:07] and knowledge is increasing but they
[1:29:10] ever learning and never able to come
[1:29:12] into the knowledge of the truth
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:17] right boy y'all preach with me today
[1:29:21] so let's let's let's let's look at look
[1:29:24] at this this morning because
[1:29:26] it hasn't changed that's right we cannot
[1:29:30] ever get too
[1:29:31] deep right to where
[1:29:34] we we stop preaching the new birth
[1:29:38] right every generation must be
[1:29:41] preached the new birth
[1:29:45] right you'll see how important this is
[1:29:48] because we'll get into it if god's grace
[1:29:52] god's thoughts versus our thoughts
[1:29:55] right because see it was
[1:29:58] god's thoughts that came from a pure
[1:30:02] source
[1:30:03] right and and all of this and that that
[1:30:06] brought this everything into existence
[1:30:10] right and then if we if we're to
[1:30:14] uh be little messiahs and amateur gods
[1:30:20] right then then if anything is going to
[1:30:23] be done
[1:30:25] our thinking right
[1:30:28] our thinking has has to be coming from
[1:30:32] that same place
[1:30:34] but i'm just kind of setting this up but
[1:30:37] i want to go here
[1:30:38] because to me this is important it's
[1:30:41] something that you can't get around
[1:30:43] i know we don't got deep now but a lot
[1:30:46] of folk ain't even born again
[1:30:51] come on i'm cool with our singing i'm
[1:30:54] cool with us shouting
[1:30:56] but we we we gotta be born again that's
[1:30:59] the only thing that's gonna keep us
[1:31:03] oh glory to god that's that's the only
[1:31:06] thing that
[1:31:07] that um is going to keep us
[1:31:11] there's an understanding that we we
[1:31:15] we gotta know right
[1:31:18] brother bannon um on verse 213 he says
[1:31:22] talking about as a man thinketh right
[1:31:26] he said it it has to become a thought
[1:31:29] before it can become a word he says and
[1:31:31] a word
[1:31:32] express materialize but i'm just kind of
[1:31:34] reading that because it's there he says
[1:31:37] i believe in my heart that um
[1:31:40] i'm a christian right
[1:31:44] that's important that's important when
[1:31:47] i'm struggling
[1:31:49] that's important when i'm uh uh
[1:31:52] messed up that's important when you
[1:31:54] don't cut somebody out
[1:32:01] oh glory to god y'all got quiet on that
[1:32:05] yup y'all open your mouth at the wrong
[1:32:08] time don't tell me don't try to sit here
[1:32:10] cute and sanctimonious and all that yeah
[1:32:13] praise the lord you might not just cuss
[1:32:18] but
[1:32:18] hey if you ain't careful and this thing
[1:32:21] ain't something y'all don't go to sleep
[1:32:23] on me now this sunday morning we
[1:32:26] shouldn't be going to sleep sunday
[1:32:27] morning
[1:32:28] amen now i got the longest drive i thank
[1:32:30] seth for brother solomon
[1:32:32] they wild awoke they whipped me so
[1:32:35] all the rest of y'all don't be nah
[1:32:39] all right
[1:32:42] amen so so he says i believe in my heart
[1:32:47] that i'm a christian because i've
[1:32:50] accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:32:54] if i don't cry and see this these
[1:32:57] things to me this is good because
[1:33:00] we get messed up i've watched so many
[1:33:02] young
[1:33:03] people teeter back and forth
[1:33:06] right that had genuine experiences
[1:33:11] and see here's the thing god can't save
[1:33:13] you today knowing he gonna leave you to
[1:33:14] mar
[1:33:15] lose you tomorrow he ain't that kind of
[1:33:17] god
[1:33:18] right it's it's just that you got
[1:33:21] we gotta know uh and believe in our
[1:33:25] heart as a man because as long as you
[1:33:28] think
[1:33:28] in your heart that you're a christian
[1:33:30] you're a christian
[1:33:32] see he says uh if i don't cry if i don't
[1:33:36] move
[1:33:37] if i don't do a thing in my heart
[1:33:40] first i believe
[1:33:44] come on in my heart first i believe
[1:33:48] that christ died for me in my
[1:33:51] stead amen i
[1:33:54] accepted it as a
[1:33:57] christian i believe it as a christian
[1:34:02] come on y'all come on y'all now now i
[1:34:05] know some of y'all been around a while
[1:34:07] but these things i think sometimes we
[1:34:08] need to go back over for
[1:34:10] for our younger generation it's what you
[1:34:13] believe
[1:34:14] right it's i believe it as a christian
[1:34:17] then it's in my heart
[1:34:20] right because that was once upon a time
[1:34:23] man
[1:34:24] i i wasn't never good at being a thug
[1:34:27] but i was trying
[1:34:30] i'm better off believing this than i
[1:34:32] ever was a man as
[1:34:34] as a as a a gangster
[1:34:38] i never wasn't really that good at being
[1:34:40] a gangster you know i used to try to
[1:34:41] tell myself that i was a
[1:34:43] tough guy but now don't bother me now
[1:34:47] you push you push any animal in a corner
[1:34:50] he'll come out fight
[1:34:52] right but but it's in his heart then i
[1:34:55] express it
[1:34:56] in in a word right see
[1:35:00] i'm a christian see no matter
[1:35:03] i make mistakes right right but i still
[1:35:07] i'm a christian amen
[1:35:13] because i must make my mistakes in the
[1:35:15] flesh
[1:35:17] not from the soul i'm
[1:35:20] i'm i'm i've been born again down in
[1:35:22] here
[1:35:24] i just got to keep this subject to the
[1:35:27] world

[1:36:03] christian
[1:36:04] talking as a christian living as
[1:36:07] a christian see i ain't straddling the
[1:36:10] fence cause you can't love

[1:36:48] try to show the guys that i i'm a
[1:36:51] christian
[1:36:52] now and something spoke in my heart and

[1:44:34] right you think as a sinner
[1:44:37] right especially based upon your

[1:44:45] and in new jersey and and based upon
[1:44:49] my surroundings that that

[1:45:04] right and and so by my thinking
[1:45:08] right uh i expressed things a certain
[1:45:12] way
[1:45:13] because it was my thinking the way
[1:45:17] the way that i thought because of my
[1:45:19] surroundings
[1:45:21] it molded me my actions
[1:45:25] see brother branham taking us on a
[1:45:27] journey
[1:45:29] right showing us that our
[1:45:32] thoughts has got to be changed
[1:45:36] right in in order in order
[1:45:39] to really become the kind of church
[1:45:43] that god is looking for this had to take
[1:45:47] place
[1:45:48] right y'all can keep that back up okay
[1:45:51] he said he
[1:45:51] changed uh my soul changed my thoughts
[1:45:54] then my thoughts became
[1:45:56] so real till they became words in my
[1:46:00] lips and they materialized now i'm a
[1:46:03] christian
[1:46:04] it made me a different person
[1:46:08] that's what made you we all could say
[1:46:11] man i know i'm a dis
[1:46:15] different person because i'm okay so
[1:46:19] boy i think i thank god i'm a different
[1:46:22] person because
[1:46:23] if you cross me you pay for it believe
[1:46:26] me i
[1:46:28] i remember when i first got saving they
[1:46:30] started meeting me and all that they
[1:46:31] just say
[1:46:32] boy you just look mean that was more
[1:46:35] than just
[1:46:36] looks you cross me
[1:46:40] oh why why thank god for jesus
[1:46:45] it made me a different person huh
[1:46:48] i'm but i'm glad for the person that i
[1:46:51] am
[1:46:52] i'm happy for the person i ain't perfect
[1:46:56] but i'm but i'm on my way
[1:46:59] things i used to do ah
[1:47:02] don't do no more
[1:47:05] places i used to go on and go tomorrow
[1:47:07] right
[1:47:09] he says now watch he said paul said
[1:47:11] though i speak with tongues um this is
[1:47:14] 2 22 22 22 22
[1:47:17] 20. paul said though i speak in tongues
[1:47:20] a million
[1:47:21] men and angels and have faith to move
[1:47:25] mountains though i bestow all my goods
[1:47:27] to feed the poor have my charity i'm
[1:47:29] nothing
[1:47:30] right it's got to be a
[1:47:34] change
[1:47:36] right it's got to be a change
[1:47:39] see this is just a simple but it's a
[1:47:41] revelation that everybody got to have
[1:47:44] it's got to be a change you can do all
[1:47:48] of these works
[1:47:49] and there's no change it don't mean
[1:47:50] nothing
[1:47:53] the change the transformation
[1:47:57] right of our thoughts
[1:48:00] be transformed by the renewing
[1:48:05] that's right huh of our mind
[1:48:09] aren't y'all glad for a renewed mind i
[1:48:12] am
[1:48:14] see anything else is just the devil
[1:48:17] trying to maybe fly over and make a a
[1:48:20] nest
[1:48:21] and that's what people wrestle with they
[1:48:23] didn't let the devil land
[1:48:26] oh glory he done built them a little
[1:48:29] nest up there he just sitting there
[1:48:33] but the bible said we cast that stuff
[1:48:35] down
[1:48:36] anything that tries to rise above the
[1:48:40] word of god
[1:48:41] i cast it down
[1:48:44] amen but you say what are you what are
[1:48:48] you
[1:48:48] getting that this is the vehicle
[1:48:52] right this is the understanding that you
[1:48:55] must have
[1:48:57] see when this drops in the heart of
[1:49:00] every individual that that comes to
[1:49:03] choke church
[1:49:04] that's the game changer that's the game
[1:49:08] changing
[1:49:09] right glory to god uh he says
[1:49:12] um it's got to be a change
[1:49:17] it is he said a change of heart not of
[1:49:20] this physical thing
[1:49:22] but the heart of your soul
[1:49:25] in something something anchors to watch
[1:49:28] this
[1:49:30] your thoughts do that
[1:49:33] way is dull you don't see that no more
[1:49:36] see you you just see the lord jesus
[1:49:40] you see righteousness holiness purity
[1:49:43] and love and grace
[1:49:45] that's when you've been changed right
[1:49:48] what is a convert convert means to
[1:49:52] change something over and your thoughts
[1:49:56] your habits your being has been
[1:49:59] changed from a sinner to a christian
[1:50:02] first thing you know
[1:50:03] in your heart right then you express it
[1:50:07] with your lips
[1:50:09] and then it materialized and
[1:50:12] that's what you are that's first
[1:50:15] we can't get around that right
[1:50:19] oh my now if you think that uh
[1:50:26] um he's going to get into something here
[1:50:29] right he says
[1:50:30] um 22 2 2 2 2.
[1:50:34] now if you think that you think it what
[1:50:36] a word
[1:50:38] but you imagine you think it and you
[1:50:41] express it and it doesn't materialize
[1:50:43] then
[1:50:43] you're on the wrong road see
[1:50:47] here's the thing right church for us
[1:50:50] i might bypass a few things and god
[1:50:53] knows y'all go back and read it
[1:50:54] i i well i'll tell you lord have mercy
[1:50:59] um these things are so important
[1:51:02] this this change is so important for us
[1:51:05] church
[1:51:06] right amen in in order to
[1:51:09] to get us to a place where we
[1:51:13] begin to really express
[1:51:16] the thoughts of god now i'mma hit this
[1:51:19] little little bit and then i'm gonna go
[1:51:21] cause i think i'm wearing y'all
[1:51:22] out i don't know y'all looking a little
[1:51:24] weary on me
[1:51:27] right lord maybe
[1:51:30] troy took it all out us with the singing
[1:51:33] y'all shouted too much now
[1:51:35] you know how that go we sit down and you
[1:51:38] know
[1:51:39] everything leaves us but in
[1:51:42] in the thought what what what i gathered
[1:51:44] from the message that brother brown
[1:51:46] was preaching and
[1:51:50] simplicity he was just really trying to
[1:51:53] show
[1:51:53] us by taking
[1:51:56] us back the kind of
[1:51:59] church that we should be so he starts to
[1:52:03] talk and
[1:52:04] we kind of started out what what is a
[1:52:06] word
[1:52:07] right uh 172.
[1:52:10] see a word is the manifestation of a
[1:52:13] thought
[1:52:14] is is expression of a thought
[1:52:17] he says that right before you can say
[1:52:20] anything subconsciously
[1:52:22] you think it before you speak it so
[1:52:25] so you say well all that you was talking
[1:52:27] about what was that all about
[1:52:29] your thinking has got to change
[1:52:33] right you you in order
[1:52:36] to express the thoughts of god you can't
[1:52:39] think like the world
[1:52:42] come on now see you you
[1:52:45] i i'll give you for instance it was it
[1:52:47] was some brothers
[1:52:49] doing some things when when the
[1:52:50] disciples was on the scene they was
[1:52:52] following the son of man
[1:52:54] they were caught they was trying to they
[1:52:57] they
[1:52:57] look at their thinking they saw somebody
[1:53:00] doing something that wasn't in their
[1:53:01] camp
[1:53:02] they wanted to man let's rain far down
[1:53:05] jesus say lord have mercy
[1:53:06] y'all don't even know what y'all doing
[1:53:09] come on church
[1:53:10] yeah see that that type of thinking
[1:53:15] was not coming from a pure source
[1:53:20] right that thought i wrote some things
[1:53:24] down on my tablet
[1:53:26] see i thought this is why the birth is
[1:53:29] important and
[1:53:30] and the change is important so that
[1:53:33] our thoughts could be running from this
[1:53:38] pure
[1:53:38] source right
[1:53:42] our thinking has got to be changed
[1:53:47] our character right see this is why
[1:53:50] jesus
[1:53:52] jesus could do what he he he did
[1:53:55] right it's because of the
[1:53:59] thoughts right and the channel that it
[1:54:02] was coming through it was pure
[1:54:07] we go back to genesis in the beginning
[1:54:10] right pure thoughts
[1:54:13] right pure thoughts everything that he
[1:54:17] did
[1:54:18] was was righteous was right
[1:54:22] right when he thought about a family and
[1:54:25] he spoke
[1:54:26] of family that was right
[1:54:30] wasn't nothing ill about that let there
[1:54:33] be
[1:54:34] and and everything that came into
[1:54:36] existence
[1:54:37] because he had fatherhood in his mind
[1:54:41] glory to god when he let there be this
[1:54:45] let there be that that was because in
[1:54:48] his
[1:54:49] thinking amen he had fatherhood
[1:54:52] and being a father he had to be a
[1:54:55] provider
[1:54:56] a protector oh y'all ought to preach
[1:55:00] with me come on ain't gonna be long
[1:55:02] amen so it was it the the
[1:55:06] expression of god wasn't nothing ill
[1:55:09] faint
[1:55:11] nothing demonic
[1:55:14] come on church see you say well why you
[1:55:17] say this
[1:55:18] because we got to watch our thoughts
[1:55:21] huh we we got to be able to
[1:55:24] differentiate between
[1:55:26] the thoughts of god and the thoughts of
[1:55:28] amen satan
[1:55:32] when you get because the devil is a good
[1:55:35] adversary
[1:55:36] and when things happen right
[1:55:39] you you got to you you got to know now
[1:55:42] this is coming from the devil
[1:55:45] right and and i cause we love creators
[1:55:49] the power of life and death is in the
[1:55:52] tongue
[1:55:53] and so we cannot be a man
[1:55:57] expressing satan's thoughts
[1:56:00] right look at look at for instance the
[1:56:03] children of promise
[1:56:05] when they crossed over and the 12 spies
[1:56:07] came back
[1:56:09] right look at their thoughts
[1:56:13] right man
[1:56:17] we like grasshoppers
[1:56:20] look what they was expressing right
[1:56:23] right
[1:56:24] amen through through this that the eye
[1:56:27] gate
[1:56:28] they were like boy these boys big
[1:56:31] these fellas is big right
[1:56:34] man we like grasshoppers in their
[1:56:37] sight they couldn't
[1:56:41] there was nothing about them that was
[1:56:43] like but we the people they big
[1:56:46] the bigger they are the harder they fall
[1:56:49] huh all that they could do because of
[1:56:52] that gate
[1:56:53] we say boy and then they start
[1:56:54] expressing it they start going through
[1:56:56] the church
[1:56:58] y'all ought to preach with me man let me
[1:57:01] tell you something
[1:57:02] boredom guys over there boy they
[1:57:05] big they big
[1:57:08] boys boy we small compared to them
[1:57:12] but see they fail to realize they had a
[1:57:13] big god on their side
[1:57:18] come on come on church see that they was
[1:57:21] they was looking at the natural and
[1:57:23] carnal and how they were going to defeat
[1:57:25] them
[1:57:26] amen through through carnality instead
[1:57:29] of
[1:57:29] we're going to defeat them because of
[1:57:31] the promise
[1:57:32] that's been given to us by god
[1:57:36] see but you know here's
[1:57:39] two individuals that came out saying
[1:57:41] shut your mouth
[1:57:44] don't you say another word in the church
[1:57:47] oh y'all got to preach with me you see
[1:57:49] how timid we be around
[1:57:51] church we we'd be acting like a bunch of
[1:57:54] cowards
[1:57:55] but let me tell you something joshua and
[1:57:58] caleb say
[1:57:59] man caleb like shut your mouth
[1:58:03] right now
[1:58:08] y'all have been y'all have probably been
[1:58:10] trying to kick them out the church
[1:58:13] they were they were they were uh uh
[1:58:16] expressing amen uh
[1:58:20] something that was not coming
[1:58:23] from the word or through the word
[1:58:27] right amen when they was like
[1:58:30] look they knew listen joshua and caleb
[1:58:33] knew what they were standing on
[1:58:36] right amen glory to god
[1:58:39] yeah they might be big what that got to
[1:58:42] do with
[1:58:42] it what what that got the
[1:58:46] the big the bigger the trap
[1:58:51] wait i got to go with it i'm a son of
[1:58:55] promise
[1:58:56] god made abraham a promise
[1:58:59] and that that through this promise his
[1:59:02] seed
[1:59:03] shall possess the gates of his enemy
[1:59:06] right glory to god but look at their
[1:59:09] thinking
[1:59:11] and because of that thinking look what
[1:59:13] they expressed
[1:59:15] but we've been changed come on church
[1:59:18] we we've been changed give me do i have
[1:59:21] 10 minutes
[1:59:23] glory to god if we got any visitors this
[1:59:25] morning who ain't familiar
[1:59:27] y'all just forgive me my mama said i'd
[1:59:29] be long-winded on sunday morning
[1:59:33] my momma tried to look at me a couple of
[1:59:35] times on video she's
[1:59:36] i talked to her she said boy i was with
[1:59:38] you for about an hour but you were still
[1:59:40] going after an hour
[1:59:42] and say mama forgive me i be ha i have
[1:59:44] so much bottle
[1:59:45] bottle up in me and i ain't got no
[1:59:47] outlet now i have to wait on brother
[1:59:49] jack because i ain't started getting out
[1:59:51] yet so i'll be loaded
[1:59:54] i'm i'm like i'm like i'm like i'm like
[1:59:58] brother brother he said he got anointed
[2:00:00] and woke his wife up and start preaching
[2:00:02] the heart
[2:00:04] so the erica know what i'm talking about
[2:00:06] but jack probably get fooled and just
[2:00:08] preach our head oh amen
[2:00:13] okay so he says and and just trying to
[2:00:17] bring us an
[2:00:17] understanding and y'all give me five
[2:00:19] minutes i'm gonna go
[2:00:22] he said uh so in the beginning was the
[2:00:26] word
[2:00:27] and and and that's as far as we can go
[2:00:29] back by this theology he said but before
[2:00:31] the word it was a thought
[2:00:33] and the thought was made manifest you
[2:00:35] see what i mean
[2:00:37] now that's how that he said
[2:00:40] first he thought so you see why
[2:00:43] i i think in his thinking has got to be
[2:00:46] thinking based upon the word he spoke
[2:00:49] the word
[2:00:50] and the word was made manifest he said
[2:00:52] oh how infallible god
[2:00:54] is right notice every thought
[2:00:57] when it is spoken you see why why
[2:01:02] our thoughts has got to be the thoughts
[2:01:04] of god
[2:01:06] right because there's a difference i
[2:01:09] thought versus and i'm skipping over
[2:01:12] right but i'm just going to say it
[2:01:14] uh for time sake i thought brother brown
[2:01:17] say run different right because see
[2:01:21] we we could think one thing and say
[2:01:23] another that's hypocritical
[2:01:25] praise the lord i love you it's mine
[2:01:30] y'all gotta talk to me now animosity and
[2:01:34] all everything else in your heart
[2:01:36] right glory to god just get that thing
[2:01:39] right
[2:01:41] just get things right don't be a
[2:01:43] hypocrite
[2:01:45] praise the lord y'all got quiet
[2:01:48] but that's in the in the message he said
[2:01:51] brother i'm excited he said our thoughts
[2:01:52] right
[2:01:53] different but out of the abundance of
[2:01:55] the heart the mouth speaketh
[2:01:57] right amen he said you shouldn't do that
[2:02:01] that's hypocritical i wrote you tell me
[2:02:04] uh uh uh uh you don't like me or
[2:02:07] something
[2:02:08] then to be a hypocrite with me amen
[2:02:12] right glory to god cause we can work on
[2:02:14] that part
[2:02:16] maybe maybe it's just the devil
[2:02:21] come on because i you know i'm i try not
[2:02:24] to be an offensive person
[2:02:27] right i try not to you know i try to be
[2:02:30] good
[2:02:31] sometimes i might say things silly
[2:02:33] acting up or something but
[2:02:35] i don't if i can help it i ain't trying
[2:02:37] to hurt nobody cause i don't want to be
[2:02:39] hurt
[2:02:40] i don't want people coming up saying all
[2:02:42] kind of foolishness
[2:02:44] to me right because i
[2:02:47] first off might get in my feelings i
[2:02:51] i may not say something to you but i
[2:02:53] might have a struggle
[2:02:55] right but but he brother branham is
[2:02:58] trying to get us to see
[2:02:59] something bring us to a place and he
[2:03:01] says now he says when jesus no wonder
[2:03:04] when he come off
[2:03:05] the hill that night he looked around
[2:03:07] that the tree
[2:03:08] for food there was no was no that's 175
[2:03:11] there was no food on the tree he said
[2:03:14] no no man eat it from thee and he went
[2:03:17] on the way
[2:03:17] and the next day coming back the tree
[2:03:19] withered see watch this god's mind
[2:03:22] like this mine right the mind that in
[2:03:25] the beginning
[2:03:27] that was a thought before it was a word
[2:03:30] that expressed jesus christ watch this
[2:03:33] and the same one was expressing the word
[2:03:36] back again
[2:03:37] that's why the tree withered away he
[2:03:40] says and
[2:03:41] every word in the bible is god's
[2:03:44] thought that's why we got to study to
[2:03:46] show ourself approve
[2:03:48] god starts laying in seed form this this
[2:03:51] just gets rich
[2:03:53] that if that if received into the human
[2:03:56] being
[2:03:57] and spoke by the same thought
[2:04:02] that manifested the bible that's deep

[2:04:21] the bible
[2:04:22] brings the thing to pass right
[2:04:26] and that thought was pure that's why
[2:04:28] things came to pass the way that it did
[2:04:30] see when it's not right and you express
[2:04:34] it forget about it

[2:05:21] right they got to be positive
[2:05:25] come on church they got to be positive
[2:05:28] because we're talking about god fell
[2:05:30] behind skin
[2:05:31] the word made flesh if it's the word
[2:05:35] made
[2:05:35] flesh then it can't be all this
[2:05:38] animosity and hatred
[2:05:40] and this and that and this and that and
[2:05:43] backbiting and evil surmising and all
[2:05:45] this kind of stuff
[2:05:47] right these things weaken the church
[2:05:52] right glory to god but when the thoughts
[2:05:55] of god

[2:05:58] that's positive
[2:06:00] amen right this positive this
[2:06:03] pure that's that's honorable oh
[2:06:06] my my my my my my
[2:06:10] he said what uh uh um he says
[2:06:13] your guiding a a direct place
[2:06:16] or a direct inspiration of the holy
[2:06:19] spirit
[2:06:20] that's moving your more to be he says oh
[2:06:22] my
[2:06:24] he says what kind of people should we
[2:06:27] be that's verse 81
[2:06:30] what kind of people should we be if the
[2:06:34] very
[2:06:34] holy spirit have us so embodied
[2:06:38] or empowered that you don't even use
[2:06:41] your own thoughts
[2:06:47] you don't use your own mind
[2:06:50] you don't use your own opinions and
[2:06:52] we're very opinionated
[2:06:55] but it's mad they should have said this
[2:06:56] brothers probably should have did this
[2:06:58] i don't even know why he got that on
[2:07:01] opinionated it ain't out of your
[2:07:02] business i did this for me
[2:07:07] right i just used that it don't even
[2:07:09] bother me
[2:07:11] okay but but he's bringing us a point
[2:07:15] right if if the holy spirit have a soul
[2:07:18] embody or empower that you don't even
[2:07:21] use your own
[2:07:22] thoughts you don't even use your own
[2:07:25] mind
[2:07:26] you don't need to use your own opinions
[2:07:28] but the holy spirit has you
[2:07:29] so built until your thoughts and your
[2:07:33] being is is god's spirit
[2:07:38] not yours expressing itself through you
[2:07:42] what kind of church would we be
[2:07:46] every now and then i come back to this
[2:07:48] message and i'll be like

[2:08:00] scripture

[2:08:04] understanding

[2:08:08] children of god

[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:01] i really appreciate brother willie
[2:22:04] you know a lot of times you he you don't
[2:22:07] really know what you're
[2:22:08] when you're up here you know i struggle
[2:22:10] with that myself
[2:22:12] and uh i go to the past and i'll be
[2:22:15] laying it on him
[2:22:16] man i should have said this
[2:22:20] i should have said that oh that didn't
[2:22:23] come out the way i wanted it to
[2:22:25] and then i dump it on my wife when i get
[2:22:28] home
[2:22:29] and pastor say that's the devil trying
[2:22:33] to
[2:22:33] get you in your thoughts
[2:22:36] instead of you just yielding and saying
[2:22:39] his thoughts
[2:22:41] because see you don't know what the
[2:22:43] people need
[2:22:45] so you're saying things under
[2:22:46] inspiration
[2:22:48] but you're on the back of your mind you
[2:22:50] said i should have said this i should
[2:22:51] have said that no just let go let god
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:54] let him say what he wanted to say but
[2:22:57] see flesh always try to
[2:22:59] come up so i should have said oh that
[2:23:01] would have been so much better no god
[2:23:02] said guess what
[2:23:03] he wanted to say that's what he wanted
[2:23:06] to say and you know
[2:23:08] i'm you know these fellows veterans
[2:23:11] i i'd be up here just like god i i
[2:23:15] i go home and i toss and turn stomach
[2:23:18] stomach being knots for three four days
[2:23:22] nothing to play with man you know why
[2:23:26] because you're speaking to
[2:23:29] the bride of jesus christ
[2:23:34] see when it started out he thought
[2:23:37] who are you
[2:23:41] you have to understand who before you
[2:23:43] can have victory i understand who you
[2:23:45] are see that was the
[2:23:46] problem with w with the children of
[2:23:49] israel
[2:23:49] when they they didn't understand who
[2:23:51] they were they came back
[2:23:54] speaking the devil's thoughts
[2:23:58] what god thought oh they're too big
[2:24:02] because see the devil's whole plan is to
[2:24:05] be worshipped as god
[2:24:07] man see
[2:24:11] and we're a small group
[2:24:14] and there's a lot of big churches
[2:24:17] they're big
[2:24:18] a lot of money and a lot of influence
[2:24:23] god is with us
[2:24:29] we are more than able
[2:24:33] amen why because we understand who we
[2:24:35] are
[2:24:37] we understand who we are willing made a
[2:24:39] point
[2:24:40] and he was saying how uh he he said
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:45] we have to understand how to master the
[2:24:49] circumstance
[2:24:50] jesus he was able to master every
[2:24:53] circumstance that we come up against a
[2:24:55] lot of circumstances
[2:24:56] in our christian journey and sometimes
[2:25:00] we we we our first thought oh
[2:25:03] cattley just died but we have to be able
[2:25:06] to
[2:25:06] settle down
[2:25:11] and pray stay in the channel of god
[2:25:16] master the circumstance because he's the
[2:25:18] only master
[2:25:22] he made another point that that really
[2:25:24] that really stood out to me
[2:25:27] he was talking about being at the wrong
[2:25:30] place
[2:25:31] at the wrong time he went down to that
[2:25:33] corner and god hadn't
[2:25:35] took him from the corner and gave him
[2:25:39] uh uh uh started beginning to change his
[2:25:41] thoughts and his mind because see
[2:25:43] his he he grew up
[2:25:46] from the things he saw we we all we all
[2:25:49] do
[2:25:50] we get our understanding from from our
[2:25:54] habitat the things around us
[2:25:57] and we just sort of develop
[2:26:01] see but we have to be re-transformed
[2:26:06] see he was going down now in the wrong
[2:26:09] place at the wrong time i'm going to
