Praise the Lord. Good to have you. Good to have you here in fellowship. Amen. The Lord is good. The Lord is good. Let's let's turn uh to two passages of scripture this morning. Um as you all are aware, this is my first time preaching. Uh we had all the guest ministers coming through and I was going to ride them all out. Uh but but um you know being that it's our our first service that I'm ministering here uh on today and um I had a couple things in my heart but I felt compelled to uh settle with uh a dedication um sermon today because the Lord has blessed us with a new place to worship and uh we want to dedicate this uh to him for his glory. for his honor. Amen. So, let's just read a couple scriptures uh and we'll just Our sermon title today is actually dedication. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um 2 Chronicles chapter 5. Praise the Lord. And uh later we'll read Acts chapter 7. The Bible says, "Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished. And Solomon brought it all uh brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of God." Then Solomon assembled the uh elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king and the and the feast which was in the seventh month. And all the elders of Israel uh came and the Levites took up the ark. And they brought up the ark and the tabernacle. The congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle. These did the priests and the Levites bring up. also King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be uh told nor numbered for multitude. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubams. But the cherubam spread forth their wings over the place of the ark. And the cherubams covered the ark and the stays thereof above. And they drew out the the staves of the ark that the ends of the stays were seen from the ark before the oracle, but they were not seen without. And there it is until this day. There was nothing in the ark, save the two tablets, two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant uh with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt. And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place. For all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then and did not them wait by course. Also the Levites, which were the singers, all of them, of Asaf, of Heman, uh, of Jedithan, uh, with their sons and their brethren being a, uh, arrayed and white linen having symbols and sulties and harps stood at the east end of the altar. And with them and 120 priests sounding with trumpets. Uh, and it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the Lord, when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets, symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord, saying, "For he is good, for his mercy endureth forever," that the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord. so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God. Amen. Let us turn also to Acts chapter 7 um and just read a a passage there. Praise the Lord. verse uh 44 here in Acts chapter 7. The Bible says, "Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed of speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen, which also our fathers uh that uh came after, brought up, brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David, who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But Solomon built him in house. How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet. Heaven is my throne, and earth is my foottool. What house will ye build me, sayeth the Lord? Oh, what is the place of my rest? The Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. Let's bow in a brief word of prayer. Father, we thank you for all that has occurred thus far in the service. Thank you for the song leading, the musicians, Lord, the specials, uh the worship. Thank you, Father, for uh allowing us to gather here in this place once more this morning. And we trust God that as we come um to this portion of the service that you would minister to every heart, to every need uh through the word. It's the word that sets the captives free. And father, may you have the preeminence uh even at this moment. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Amen. In the presence of the Lord. Again, uh our uh title today, Amen. is dedication. Amen. Dedication. Praise the Lord. Um, praise God. Also good to have Sister Gwenna with us. Amen. She's getting some extra time with the grandchildren. Amen. We thank God. Thank God for her. Um, so as we uh just journey here, we we are very very grateful for the Lord opening this new door for us. Amen. For a place of fellowship. Um and and I I did want to say uh thank you to all of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. You all have been ride or dice. Amen. You have you have uh uh run with us. Amen. This race uh we we uh those that don't know, we actually started uh the church in our home over 20some years ago. But the first building we had was actually here in the city of Green Acres. Uh right off Lakew Worth Road is where we where we started. Uh then the Lord took us uh there to West Palm Beach there off of um uh Hill Road and we were there for roughly 13 years and from there we moved to the school and we were in the school for 4 years. August would have represented four years there in the school and uh as we read the scripture there they began to um do the dedication in the seventh month. And if you all recall, our first service here was actually in the seventh month on the 30th day that we came here, right? Uh so um you know, so after 4 years there in the school, now the Lord has opened up this new door uh for us to be in fellowship here at Eagle's Rest and we're very grateful uh for the church opening their door for us to be able to have fellowship here. Uh but we want to since God has given us place this place, we want to dedicate it. Amen to uh the presence of the Lord and the glory of the Lord. Uh this word dedication has multiple meanings. Uh one is uh is the quality of being dedicated or committed to a task or a purpose. So uh my objective in bringing this sermon is not necessarily to dedicate a physical building but uh I pray that this sermon would cause uh your beings to become dedicated to a cause or committed to a task or a purpose and that is the kingdom of God. Amen. The other uh definition for this word dedication is the action of dedicating a church or other building. Amen. So these are definitions and we are doing both of these. Brother Brandham makes a statement. Amen. Uh in the spurnian church age and as I mentioned to you all I'm I'm very grateful for all of you all just being a part of this journey with us. You didn't complain. You just roll right with us and we we really appreciate it. Amen. Really appreciate uh the hearts of God's people. Spurnian church age. Brother Brandon makes a statement here. He says, "Now a church says the church name is associated with the nature of its character." Amen. Did Did the brothers give the quotes? Did we give them the quotes? Okay. All right. The the church name is associated with the nature of his character. And and I like this statement that brother Brandham is making because uh oftent times when people are deciding to pick a church uh it's very important that you kind of uh understand that a church name has a certain character associated with that name. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So so so sometimes you can tell a lot about a church if you just look at the name. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And brother brother Gwena uh picked it up on on um on u um Wednesday night as he was just talk preaching in his sermon. Uh the name of the church spirit and truth tabernacle ought to tell you something. &gt;&gt; It tells you exactly where we stand. Not not not only do we believe amen in uh the supernatural moving of the spirit of God. Amen. But we believe things must be based upon the word of God. That that allows us not to go off into chaos. Hallelujah. But it keeps us right in the middle of the road. The the the name of the church is associated with its character. &gt;&gt; It says, did you notice the Smyrna meaning bitter? And you notice each one of the church now the church name has something to do with the character of the church. Says I could say something here and I better not because you get me wrong. He says your name does too. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. You might not know it but it does. Oh yeah. You say now it's numerology. No, it's not. When Jacob was born, they called him Jacob, which was supplant. Uh but when he wrestled with the angel of God, changed his name to Israel, a prince. Is that right? Saul was Saul of Tarsus, a mean fellow. But when he come to Jesus, he he he's called Paul. Simon's name was Simon. When he come to Jesus, he was called Peter, a little stone. Oh, yes, sir. Your name associates what you are. It it has an impression upon your character. &gt;&gt; If your your your name that your parents gave you at birth has an impression upon your character also the name of the church will have amen will be a part of its character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll know a lot about just about the church if you just look at the name. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, hallelujah. Let's go on here in the message dedication. Brother Random makes a a statement uh that I think is very uh precious to me. Uh he says uh now we are grateful. He says that God has given this place to these people and I'm trusting that it will be a great lighthouse in this part of the country. Amen. And he goes on, he says, "Now many times people think that we see a congregation and they think, well, this little church won't hold very many people." He says, "And I believe brother uh uh LG told me or some uh some way in this congregation is about 70 or 80 people and something on that order. I may be a little under or a little over, but it's somewhere around there just starting off. I like I like that because this 70 80 kind of you know when they asked us about uh this church and said how many people you coming with? I I I said we coming with about 70 70 80. They they said you got about 200. Said, "No, no, about 70 80 is that that's, you know, we not going to tear up the church. We we we going to be we we going we going to have just just enough there and enough for us to expand and grow in." But but I like the statement that he says here. 7080 just starting off. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So make room for somebody else. You got family that still need to come. &gt;&gt; And and God, we already see God is in the middle of restoring people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So 70 or 80 just starting off. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Where the Lord take it from here is up to him. &gt;&gt; And and and I was told that anytime you get a building, you ought to watch for growth. &gt;&gt; Unexpected growth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. He says this. He says, "Well, uh, they think, well, look at the church around the country today, their congregation ranks in the thousands, megaurches, right?" It says, "And may maybe some at each service uh uh at each service day there have they have thousands, but to encourage this little group, that isn't exactly what God's looking at, numbers." &gt;&gt; Amen. He looks he doesn't always place himself on the basis of quantity. &gt;&gt; But where does God place himself? On the basis of quality. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, it's not the amount of people, it's the quality. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, we got good quality at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I I received a text from one of the pastors, local pastors. Uh he said he says, "Brother Jack, I just wanted to uh commend you all on how you all handled that meeting there a couple weeks ago." He said, "You all had tremendous organizational skills." So he said, he said, "I just want to commend y'all." And this is a small group doing something like that. It's not the quantity, but it's the quality of the people. God got people dedicated to the cause of Christ. God got people committed, amen, to the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not the quantity, it's the quality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, we see in the Bible in the 19th chapter of Acts where Paul passing through the upper coast came to Ephesus and there he found a church that was the Ephesian church which was the first in the church age considered in the revelation of Christ. It says, "And in this church, the Ephesian church, now notice this, in this church here, there was 12 people as recorded." 12 people was the number. They only had 12 people as members in this church, but they were a powerful church. &gt;&gt; All right. He says, "But if the church only had 12 or like that church did and completely surrender to God, he can do more with that 12 than he could with the rest of the world. It's the surrender that we have where the truth of the gospel not only goes from the platform but finds in the hearts of the people uh uh uh reacts back right but finds in and and and I'm sorry the truth of the gospel only goes from the platform but finds its bed in the hearts of the people and reacts back and I believe brother Gwyn was telling us that you know what good would it be to just come and just be hear the word you know and the word never have an impact on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy to be in church. Is that all? You're just happy to be in church &gt;&gt; because I'm not just I'm not coming to church just to go to church just to take it off my list. I went to church on Sunday. &gt;&gt; No, I'm here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And and I can tell you right now before I I I'm already ahead of myself, but I'm here to meet God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God God desires to have a place where he can fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; Do you realize, Amen, that the closest place to heaven &gt;&gt; on earth &gt;&gt; is behind this pull pit? &gt;&gt; So if you if ever you're trying to hear from heaven, &gt;&gt; amen, you need to come to church. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because God can speak something from behind the pull pit to your situation. And when you hear God speak, not a man preaching to you, but when you hear God speak, you ought to respond to God. &gt;&gt; God, I thank you for speaking to me. I thank you because all it take is one word from God and your situation will change. &gt;&gt; Brother, your sickness will be over with one word from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you lost a job, you can get another one with one word from God. Hallelujah. If you need papers for the country, God can change things in one word. &gt;&gt; The inspiration that comes from the pull pit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is able to change the circumstance. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. here you know we we we we we see uh brother Brandham is saying he says um uh not he says it it's it's the surrender that we have where the truth of the gospel not only goes from the platform but finds its bed in the hearts of the people and reacts back &gt;&gt; so I've deemed this a pleasure this morning he says and he says now all right that's good I'm I'm moving now over to God hiding himself in simplicity them revealing himself in the same. Let me just get a few of these uh foundational quotes out of the way as we not only dedicate this building. But we dedicate ourselves to the cause of Christ. &gt;&gt; We we want to give ourselves to him. Amen. We want him uh to receive all the glory and all the honor. Here in the message, God hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same. The prophet says, "Now I think it's our duty to make the inside right." And he's talking about, you know, the church. We we it's our duty to make this inside right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me make that make it very clear. We don't come in here and mess up mess up nothing. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; And and and and can I say it this way? Leave it the same way you left it. I mean, the way you found it, &gt;&gt; right? If if if if if you come and and want no paper on the ground when you got there, &gt;&gt; it shouldn't be no paper on the ground when you leave. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, it wasn't I mean, you didn't see nothing. Make sure it's left the way that we found it. &gt;&gt; And I and I know I believe uh they usually have that box of tissue right here. &gt;&gt; Right now, when we take it down, it's our responsibility to do what? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is Praise God. &gt;&gt; This is where we fellowship. &gt;&gt; But but we want to make sure we leave everything the way we left it. These chairs, we put them up here, but they got to go back. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Everything that need to be right back intact. We put a carpet down. We put our camera. If things got to go back to where they were, it's it's our duty &gt;&gt; to make the inside right by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bathrooms got to be clean. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. There's a lot of things we got to do to make sure it's it's it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful uh to God that uh this this will just not be a beautiful building that we'll come to. But may everyone who comes see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in. It says, "May may it be a consecrated place to our Lord, a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we that we certainly do appreciate." It says, "But the beauty of the church is the character &gt;&gt; of the people." &gt;&gt; It says, "I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty." Not not just people come inside. Oh man, this is nice. This is nice. No, that what should be nice is the people that are inside. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The beauty of the church is the character of the people. Another statement out of marriage and divorce, brother Brandham uh makes here. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I I like laying all this foundational uh material in here. He says this in marriage and divorce. It says man looks at natural beauty. &gt;&gt; He says it's deceiving. And uh he said that's why a woman was given that beauty for deception to deceive. A beautiful woman if she don't use it in the right way is a curse to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now this is very important especially for the young sisters. And when you start sniffing yourself &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And your beauty &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly, &gt;&gt; your beauty will send you to hell. &gt;&gt; Your figure &gt;&gt; will send you to hell &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Not only send you to hell, but send fellas to hell, too. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's look at what the prophet say. Even Even even for the brothers too, you all buff. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It'll send you to hell, my brother, &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly. &gt;&gt; Y'all going to let me read. &gt;&gt; All right. It says, "A beautiful woman, if she don't use it in the right way, it's a curse to her that will send her to hell quicker than anything else." &gt;&gt; It says, "I know I anything of I know." It says if she can be pretty sure as long as she stays with her husband and does what's right, that's fine and dandy. But she can take that same thing my and how she can deceive with it for it was given to her to do so. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now look at this. It says, "Notice now, but God is featured in character. There was no beauty which should desire Jesus. But there was never there there never was a character like him on the earth. Now we find out, amen, that the church character. My God, Satan and his group look after big beautiful churches, beautiful things. It says that's what the that's what the world looks at today. Oh, it's the pastor, the great so and so uh time so and so so priestly and godly walk out with his big robes and things like that. They call that beauty. But look at this now. But the real saints of God look for the character of that vindicated word. &gt;&gt; We're not just looking for for beauty. We're looking for the character of the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; And and I think we got a group of people here that Amen. that that that's convinced that we have found the character of the vindicated word. That's why we could go to a school for four years and be satisfied because we had the character of the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; And in that school, God gave us some wonderful sermons. &gt;&gt; And he gave us somewhere between here and there &gt;&gt; that came right out of the school. He he put us on a journey of I will restore saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother, he put us in a year of overflow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These the things that came from that school. It was the character of the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; That's what we're drawn to. &gt;&gt; That's why we come the spirit and truth tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the real saints of God looks for the character of the vindicated word. That's what the saints did in that day. when they see Jesus, he wasn't nothing to look at, but they seen God was in him. They seen God was with him. Now, I have a question. What is the purpose of us coming to church? I told you I got ahead of myself and I'm repeating this. The purpose of us coming to church and the the reason that God even provided this place of worship for us is one purpose and that's because God desires to fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm happy to see you on the front row. I was going to tell you to move there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was going to tell you to move there. I'm happy to see you there. Stay there. Don't Don't let nobody take your seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but the purpose is because God desires to have fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason God provided this place is because God wanted to have fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God wanted a place that he could come and speak to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God wanted fellowship with you. Now, um, sometimes we think the place is for us to have fellowship with others. But I want to read a quote out of out of church order to make sure that we don't do things the wrong way. The reason that we're here is because God desires fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't know if we got that. The reason you're here, God wants to talk with you. &gt;&gt; God wants to minister to your needs. &gt;&gt; God has to have a place where he can gather us and and and he can just do what he wants to do. And only God type things. God has to have a place for that. So God has to make provision &gt;&gt; and give you a place. So come come. I want I want to I want to I want to just speak to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oo, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, let me I'm I'm going to go a little further with that in a second, but let me first just drop this little church order in here. Uh a quote from church order. Brother Brandam has asked a question. Uh please explain just how we deacons can keep the people just in the sanctuary before or after. Please explain um how do we keep the people quiet in the sanctuary before and after church. Now here the deacons have the responsibility of keeping the people uh quiet in the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You know everywhere we go if if we if like when we went to the school and had had those services that was the sanctuary &gt;&gt; and and you have to respect the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Anytime we go in we have to respect the sanctuary. And and sometimes we get we get into space like that we get a little wow. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to do that. No running in the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Oh, they got signs out here in they sanctuary. You know what they got the sign say? They said no food and no drink in the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; You know we not You know what we're not going to do? Bring food and drink in the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. They got signs on the bathroom. If they under 12, let the parents go with them. &gt;&gt; That way they don't get stuck in the bathroom. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we we want to make sure that we we handle this properly. Brother Brandham goes on to say this. He's answering this question. Uh I'm I'm going down to 149 in that same paragraph. He says, "Now now deacons of the church, as I said, are the police of the church. But the church is not a general meeting house." The church is not a general meeting house for fellowship and friendship and frolic. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not what the church is for, &gt;&gt; right? So if we see frolic, &gt;&gt; the deacons will address it &gt;&gt; because the purpose of you coming to church &gt;&gt; is not to meet your friend, &gt;&gt; but the purpose of you coming to church is to meet God. &gt;&gt; And we have to put you in a place where you can't be distracted when you're trying to meet God. &gt;&gt; All right. It says uh uh but the church is not a general meeting house of fellowship and friendship and frolic. The church is a sanctuary of God. We come here. He says, "Now, if we want to meet one another, let me come to your house or you come to my house and you go to one another's house and meet one another." But just to frolic around through the church and talking and things like that, see, uh uh he says, "It's not right, brethren. We come here, we get that whole thing off of our mind if we come here." Now, the the the scripture tells us in Habach 2 and 20, remember this is the house of the Lord. This is a sanctuary of God and we want to treat it that way. Treat it with respect. Uh this is the house of prayer. Another thing I I like to tell brothers uh when we come into the church house, we don't wear our hats. &gt;&gt; Not in the church house cuz a man not supposed to come in in the house Lord with his head covered. &gt;&gt; Right. That's the scripture. We don't do those things. So So let take your hat off outside. That's right. Soon as you walk into the house of the Lord, respect the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Habach 2:20 says, "But the Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the earth keep silence before him." So, so we want to make sure that we are honoring, Amen. the house of God. We respect the house of God. Uh we don't have the kids running all over the place. If you see them running, stop them. That's that's that is a definite time to say stop. &gt;&gt; That that's stop. And you got to mean it. Don't be smiling when you say stop. &gt;&gt; I mean, my mama sometime when I was younger, mama just had to look at me. &gt;&gt; Just a look. And if mama, if you ain't developed that look yet, you better get one. &gt;&gt; It's a look that mean I ain't playing. &gt;&gt; And and some kind of way. I understood the look. I mean, ju just just to look alone, I said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; start playing around with other things, but I knew to stop what I was doing right then. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord." So, so, so let let's let's make sure that we we're respecting the house of the Lord. The Lord is in his holy temple. Let all the earth keep silence before him. God's purpose for giving us this building is because he desires fellowship with his people. in the Garden of Eden. Uh God would come down in the cool of the evening to have fellowship with Adam and Eve. That was his creation. They had church in the Garden of Eden. And we all know the story that one day God came down and and Adam and Eve didn't show up to church. &gt;&gt; And he had to ask him a question say, uh, "Adam, Adam, where art thou?" And uh when he when he asked, it's not that God didn't know where they were. He knew exactly where they were, but uh he need to have a conversation. they need to be brought to a place of repentance, &gt;&gt; a place of restoration. Right? So, so, so here God had this conversation with him and and and and you know, but but it showed that what God wanted in the very beginning was was this way to have fellowship with his with his creation. And God still has that same desire. He wants to have fellowship with you as an individual. Praise God. Uh, another time in scripture, uh, Moses was directed, we'll pick this up in Exodus 25:8-9. Uh Moses was directed uh to build a tabernacle for God. And the reason that again the tabernacle was established is so God could have fellowship with his people. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Exodus 25 verse 8 and 9. And it says, "And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall you make it." So, uh, I remember when we first, um, when we were in our home there in, uh, in Lantana and, uh, the Lord had put it in my heart to to go out and try to find a place for us to be able to to worship. And, um, you know, my mother-in-law was the one that found that place in Green Acres. She was driving by, she said, say it's available for rent. And I went inside that building. I said, "Ain't nothing we can do with this." But when I took my wife inside the building, she said, "Oh, we can do a lot of things with this. We can do this and we can do that." She was just a visionary. And I'm like, "Hey, ain't a we can't do nothing." But uh but by God's grace, we did something with that building. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I remember uh I needed somebody to do some work for me. So I called a guy in and and um uh I say, "Would you be willing to kind of do this and do this with the building, do that?" You know, he's like, "Uh yeah, I can do this and I can do that." He says, "What? Tell me." You know, he start ask me all kind of questions. So I said, "Well, you know, I was inspired by the scripture in Exodus 25:8 where the scripture told Moses, let them make a sanctuary that I may dwell among them." Right. And they say, "Oh, you think you Moses?" I said, "No, I didn't say that, my friend. I'm not saying that I'm Moses. I'm not trying to be Moses. I'm trying to be the best Jack that I can be." &gt;&gt; Right? And and and it's and I I said, "It's not that." But I was just inspired by the scripture. The same way Moses made a sanctuary so that the people of God could dwell. It was I I felt it was my responsibility to try to make a sanctuary where the people of God can dwell. Not where Not only where the people of God can dwell up, where God can dwell in the midst of his people. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And my God, we we can go back and share some testimonies with you. God certainly dwelt in the midst of his people. &gt;&gt; I remember a service there. Uh the Holy Ghost came down. One sister was passing out and another sister went to try to catch her and by the time she got up on her, she felt the power of God so strong she couldn't touch her. &gt;&gt; I mean, man, we had we had some services everywhere we've gone. We seen God do great things. God wants to dwell in the midst of his people. And if we've seen him do it in the past, hallelujah, I'm under expectation that he will do it right here, &gt;&gt; brother. We're moving towards a a season or a service where the minister won't even be able to stand to minister because the glory of God will be so strong in the building. I hope you're not missing on that day. But I I said we want to make this because this is what God told Moses to do and we did and the Lord blessed us there in that in that little spot. But Moses was given a pattern, a heavenly pattern to make the sanctuary. He he watched what God did uh there in heaven and then he brought it down to earth and and and the sanctuary that that that that uh or the tabernacle that Moses made uh it had three components to it. It had the outer court. It had the inner court. And it had the most holy place. The outer court was where the people would bring their sacrifices. Amen. And and this outer court contain uh the the the the a brazen altar and a lather, you know, cuz what happened is that when you brought to sacrifice, the sacrifice had to be washed before it could be offered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had they would offer lambs and turtle doves in their sin offerings and and and this is just when they would bring their offering for a sin offering. Amen. A lamb or turtle dove. It was also a perfect type of the Lord Jesus because uh what it showed is that um you needed something, amen, to substitute for you in your place. Even though you was guilty of sin, even though you was guilty of of doing wrong, but you had to have something, amen, substitute in your place for God to accept the offering, amen, and forgive you of your sin. Christ died on the cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. In our place, a substitute for our sins. But see, here's what happened. When when the when when the when the believer went to the outer court with his with his sacrifice when he was offering it to the the priest, he would have to put his hand on that sacrifice. My this lamb that he has raised, amen, in his own home and he had to take it now and give it to the priest knowing, amen, that the priest is going to kill that lamb and that lamb became a substitute for, amen, the believer. And he had to put his hand on that on that sacrifice. Sometimes, amen, when they put their hand on it, maybe they might even feel the blood coming from the lamb. My God. But they have to realize something had to die in order for them to live. &gt;&gt; Christ had to die in order for us to live. Let's not take the sacrifice of Christ lightly. &gt;&gt; This outer court, the the people would bring their offerings. Hallelujah. But then they had the inner court and this is where the priests only Amen. the the the priests would they were allowed to go in this area and this area contained a a golden alt of incense uh a table of showbread and the golden candlestick right and and here the the priest would go and do all the service there for uh for the Lord within this inner court for the people. So they would take your offering, take it and you know make a sacrifice to God. God ex accepting your sin offering. Hallelujah. But then they had Amen. The third part was the uh the the most holy place. Amen. And and this most holy place, it contained the ark of the covenant. It's where the wings of the cherubams touched and and they overspread over the mercy seat. Thank God for his mercy that was given to us. Amen. Uh also the the ark of the covenant represented the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The ark ark represented the word because it contained the ten commandments. It also had some hidden mana in it. And it also had Aaron's rod in that ark of the covenant. Hallelujah. Now, now here's the thing. when uh that that ark kind of represents the word being that it represents the word that this pull pit is a holy place. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the most holy place in this sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Let me just put it that way. This pull pit. That's why I say the closest place to heaven on earth is behind the pull pit. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, so with with this being a most holy place now, you got to understand not not even the priest could go into this most holy place. Amen. And the people could not go into this most holy place. The only ones that could go, only person could go in there was the high priest. And he only went one time a year. Amen. Into this most holy place. &gt;&gt; You couldn't handle that just any kind of way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we got a lot more space. So, like I say, don't let the kids be running. Don't don't have one of the kids just take off running up here behind all of this. No, no, no. Respect. Yes, sir. the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm warning everybody of that. Respect the house of the Lord. If and and and if if y'all see a kid, you got my permission. I know the parents might not give you permission, but you got my permission to get that kid down off of this platform. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Take them to their parent and say, "This is what I caught them doing." So now I'm just bringing them to you. I didn't say spank them. I said get them down off this platform. &gt;&gt; Now, now see, I know we live in a different day. If if it was my day &gt;&gt; and I was a child, &gt;&gt; I'm talking about my day. Now, I &gt;&gt; I would have got two beatings. &gt;&gt; The first one I'm going to get from the person that caught me. &gt;&gt; If it was one of the mothers in the church that caught me, they going to beat me. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And then go tell my mama they beat me. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And and if my mama Amen. found out that they had to beat me. Mama going to beat me a second time &gt;&gt; because she's embarrassed that this person had to do that for her. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Nowadays, we don't get that. &gt;&gt; Don't touch my child. &gt;&gt; We I said don't touch them people. &gt;&gt; Get them down out the pull pit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right. The high priest would go once a year. Amen. on the day of atonement and and when that high priest went into the most holy place, he had to be dressed appropriately. &gt;&gt; He couldn't dress any kind of way that he wanted to. &gt;&gt; God gave him specific garments to put on in order to approach God. God watches the way that we approach him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says a lot about our attitude towards our approach when we come to God dressed appropriately. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they had to the high priest had to be dressed appropriately. Amen. He had to make an offering for himself and also offering for the people. And uh and and one of the things special about his garment, he had to on the bottom of his garment, he had to have pomegranates and he had to have bales on the bottom of his garment. Now, God did that for a very specific purpose because if that high priest, not only if he was not dressed appropriately, if his life was not lined up appropriately, then it was possible that this high priest could die inside that most holy place. Yes, sir. So they would have to tie a rope around his waist and they have to have those bells ringing on uh I mean ringing on the bottom of his garment because when he walked the way that they knew the man was alive is that the bells would ring. &gt;&gt; They would hear the bells ringing and they knew, okay, he's still alive in there. But if them bells ever stop ringing, &gt;&gt; they better get the pulling on the rope because nobody could go inside there and get him out. The only way to bring that man out of there is pull him through through that rope. That's why they had to be prepared to make sure that this man was ready &gt;&gt; when he was going in to meet God. &gt;&gt; The noise let them know he was alive. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something. It's the noise &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord that lets us know that the people are still alive. Hey, when God speaks something to you, you ought to shout, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise God. And back back in my day, we used to get up and say, "Kubenaba." &gt;&gt; That meant preach the word. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Say something. &gt;&gt; And if and and if you get hurt by something, say ouch. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; The glory. &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of Moses was a place that God had to have fellowship with his people. Adam and Eve would fellowship in the cool of the evening in the Garden of Eden. Moses had a portable tabernacle there in the wilderness where God would fellowship with his people. But we picked up in scripture that David also desired to build God a house where God could have fellowship with his people. And and and I think uh let me just see something here. I want to just bring in a a quote. Yeah, I want to bring in a quote. Acts of the Holy Spirit is where I want to u go to. David desired to build him a house. But we know according to scripture that David actually did not get that opportunity to build the house for the Lord. Now he made preparation. David saved all types of materials and things like that for years. But Solomon was the one that was given the responsibility to be able to build the house for the Lord. And um but David still had an impact there. Now, here um I want to just kind of catch this out of Acts of the Holy Spirit. This is a quote that's been a very familiar quote, but as I kept reading, it kind of connected here to the sermon here today. Um Acts of the Holy Spirit. Uh okay. Yes. says, "I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of Churches comes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to the prophecy." Now, here's brother Brandham speaking about what's going to happen within the Catholic Church. And we just saw the fulfillment of this &gt;&gt; in our day. &gt;&gt; In in our day &gt;&gt; and and let me tell you something. Uh we we saw the fulfillment of the the woman president and vice president. We're seeing the fulfillment of the Catholic Church. And there's another thing brother Brandham spoke to us and and and I'm praying that I won't be here to see the fulfillment or if it does happen that I'll be leaving here as soon as it does. And that is Los Angeles, California &gt;&gt; is going underwater. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If all these other things have come to pass, that's also going to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Uh so here the the thing of it is is we need to get ready. Get ready to get out of here, church. That that's that's why God want to meet with his people. So he's trying to prepare you so you can get ready to get out of here. This this this is not our final destination. &gt;&gt; And and I'm talking natural and spiritual. We got we got we got another place that God want to take us to, &gt;&gt; but that's still not our final destination. We're trying to get ready to leave here. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a rapture that that's that's in front of us and we we're getting we're getting prepared for that. We come here to church to get ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; Let me let me go forward here. So, as I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation of Churches goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to the prophecy, then they'll form an image like unto the beast. And I'll tell you the true church of God will be drove together. uh the real true believers out of the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim, Holiness, wherever they'll be uh will go together and see it by the love of God. Now you'd watch this quote now. Oh my. And and notice what he said now. Where they coming from the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, and Nazarene sir. And um you last week we were told that we had to go to Ziglag &gt;&gt; before we actually go to the next destination. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And y'all understand what Ziglag is. &gt;&gt; Ziglag is amongst the Philistines. &gt;&gt; And in that day would have been the enemy. &gt;&gt; David had to go to Ziglag first. Now the our enemy today is anybody that takes a stand against the word sir &gt;&gt; is our enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And most denominations take a stand against the word, &gt;&gt; the vindicated, revealed word for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when we walk through this building and I brought the brothers in, uh the pastor here, he was telling me about his his his ministry and uh just just his his route that he traveled to get to where he is. He was telling about the ministry of a gentleman by the name of WV Grant. I said, 'Okay, I I've heard of that name. Said, "Yeah, I think I've heard of that name." He said, "Pull it up on the computer. Pull it up on the on the on the web. You can find him. You can find him." And I said I said, "Yeah, I've heard of him." He said, "Have you ever heard of William William Brandham?" I think I heard of him. I know a little bit about him. Just just a little bit. Just But for him to use that name, he didn't say or Roberts. &gt;&gt; He didn't say Billy Graham. He said, "Have you ever heard of William Brandon?" We say, "Well, WV Grant got the mantle from William Brandon." Said, "Oh, okay. All right. No problem." But here, I I I understand that we just might not be on the same page. That's okay. &gt;&gt; But notice the quote. &gt;&gt; Notice the quote. &gt;&gt; God don't do things by mistake. &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you the true church of God will be drove together. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The real true believers out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Nazarene. &gt;&gt; So that quote tells us we ought to be preparing for something. &gt;&gt; All right. He says um he says they'll it says uh uh uh whatever they'll be will go together and cement it by the love of God. They'll make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ all the believers and agnostics and shallow-minded will be cast to one side. They'll go right on into the confederation of the churches. And I read the other day even assemblies of God went into the confederation of churches. Oh my. have to deny their evangelical doctrine to do so. That's right. And all the Pentecostal signs and wonders principle uh they have to deny that to be in the in the confederation of churches have to deny it. Oh brother, to have prestige. I'd rather, as I've said many times, lay on my stomach and drink branch water and eat soda crackers and be popular with God and to be his ser and be his servant of God than to have the best there is this world gives. If I had to compromise on my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and his Bible, I believe this is the infallible word of God and every word of it is right. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now he goes on he says now well watch and there how they was doing they rejected they come putting down their stones and they come to a place they found a funny looking stone. Now he's now he just switched uh in this quote he's talking about D I mean Solomon when he went to build the temple and what happened David had already made preparation for this temple uh you know years before it even was being made. God had already made preparation. Can I tell you God had already prepared this place for us before we got here. &gt;&gt; It it was already prepared &gt;&gt; already set up. He knew just how you would like it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of our mothers, they say, "I need to have myself a I need to have a nursery." &gt;&gt; And and God made it that you could have a nursery where I can still be a part of the service. &gt;&gt; God heard your prayers. &gt;&gt; God knew that we needed a place where we can do Sunday school &gt;&gt; because he had restored Sunday school back to us. &gt;&gt; God knew we need a place where we can do communion cuz he restored that back to us in the school. God God knew everything and he especially designed the place &gt;&gt; so that every need would be met. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When when um Solomon was in the in in in the building phase of this and let me just Yeah. uh they were in the building phase of uh of of of doing the temple and and while they were building, brother Random tells us they found a little stone that said, "Man, this stone is so uh odd looking. We don't think we need that." And they just threw the stone to the side. And they went to building and as they were building, they were getting uh um material from all parts of the world. And it was it was amazing how when the material came uh um I want to pull up the scripture, First Kings 6:7, just get that ready. But when the material came, the material had no need of being chiseled out, &gt;&gt; no hammer on it. Uh the material somehow wherever it was coming from, somehow God had already orchestrated that the material would actually fit and connect with the other material that was coming from other parts of the world. It was supernatural in building that they didn't have to put a hammer on it. They didn't have to put an axe on it. They didn't have to do that. Just every block just fit the next block. No matter what part of the world it came from, everything just connected one to the other. Hallelujah. And see here, we've all come from different nations. We come from different places, but each block is connected to the next block. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Not without a hammer or axe or nothing. Everything just connects. Everybody finds their place and the building is being built for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my. Some from Zimbabwe. &gt;&gt; Some from South Africa. &gt;&gt; Some from Haiti. &gt;&gt; Some from North. Amen. America. &gt;&gt; From some from down south. &gt;&gt; Some from Puerto Rico. My God. &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. We come from all kind of places to build this. &gt;&gt; This is the hand of God. &gt;&gt; This is the hand of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem was is that they as they built they got the building to almost its complete state. And when they got it there, they noticed, man, there is one thing missing in this building. This is the the cornerstone. This is the the chief cornerstone. And that that cornerstone was a was they call it a brother random call it a freak stone. It it it looked so strange and so odd that when they first saw it, they kicked it into the weed pile. And brother Brandon even said, you know, the stone was missing. So what happened that they begin to send boats back and and start asking questions like, did y'all send us all the all the material that we're supposed to have? Maybe maybe it dropped somewhere along the way cuz we're missing one stone. He said they went looking everywhere and said, finally somebody went looking in the wee pile &gt;&gt; and they found this this rejected stone sitting inside the wee pile. But that rejected stone was a stone that finished the building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And once they put it in its place, hallelujah, once that stone got into its place, then the building was complete, now they could set it for dedication. What is that freak stone that's been pushed to the side? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What is that freak stone? What is that stone that that don't look so good? Don't feel so good. Oh, it's it's it's it's it's it's the love of the Lord Jesus Christ. That stone must be in the building. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you we going to have to have love for one another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to push all the funny feelings to the side and we got to have love one for the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once we God sees that love, that was part of the restoration because cuz you know the the the the the worm ate up the love of fellowship. &gt;&gt; But that was restored back in the church. &gt;&gt; The freak stone has finally found its place and now we can have a dedication service. And Solomon begin to have that dedication service. And and here let me just read this in uh first 1 first kings 6 and 7 uh 6:7 says and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building. Everything was already made ready before it got there. everything I mean that you were going through in your life before you got here, God made you ready so that you can amen make this church what it is because remember the beauty of the church is the character of the people. &gt;&gt; That's the beauty of the church. That's what draws people to the church. They see the character of the people. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I I was uh I reached out to sister Ivonne recently and hadn't seen her, but she told me she had some some some car trouble and I told her about us moving and everything like that. Said, "If you ever need a ride to church, you let us know. Somebody be there to get you." But I knew that God had us there at that school &gt;&gt; for a reason. &gt;&gt; Sister Ivonne happened to be there &gt;&gt; coming and she came I've been coming for years, &gt;&gt; but God had had us there for a reason. when her granddaughter think went home said they having church in that school grandma &gt;&gt; and she comes showing up there was a reason for that &gt;&gt; but once she got locked in now we can move on the freak stone has been put in this place that freak stone that rejected stone that cornerstone that's the love of the Lord Jesus that we need in the church brother Brandham um says it like this in the message dedication of the building of the Lord. Uh dedication of the building to the Lord. He says that's where your churches has got today. You denominations you built and you plastered, you got buildings, but you find there's a hole there somewhere. What did they find? The stone that was rejected said Jesus is a chief corner chief cornerstone. Certainly. He says, "You made denominations. You have it. The rest of them is not in it. You're leaving out the love of God, the chief cornerstone. I don't care how many miracles you can perform, &gt;&gt; how many prophets you have, &gt;&gt; how many works of grace you do, it'll never meet or never do anything because the church of the living God is melted together and cemented by love." &gt;&gt; And they rejected that stone. I like that being cemented by love. You know when when cement set it &gt;&gt; when cement set &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; If you was in the cement &gt;&gt; and it set, &gt;&gt; you're in some trouble. &gt;&gt; It's going to take it going to take a lot to get this cement off of you. And when the church has been cemented, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; by love, &gt;&gt; look, the devil going to have to do a lot &gt;&gt; to break that up. &gt;&gt; I say the devil going to have to do a lot. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a lot more. She didn't shake my hand &gt;&gt; or she didn't look at me the right way. It's going to take more than that. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He just walked right by me. No, it's going to take more than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, somebody. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When the church is cemented by love &gt;&gt; and y'all y'all know how it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can I talk to y'all sisters for a little bit &gt;&gt; now? I'm almost I'm almost I'm almost home. But &gt;&gt; sisters sometimes take on other people's issues. &gt;&gt; You take on your friends issues. Right? &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Cuz I in my household, I always use this example. I never seen I've never seen nothing like this before. I just got married. You know, I've been married for a few years and and I didn't know nothing about this stuff. But I remember one of them went to a hairdresser and all of them was talking about the hairdresser. Everybody getting their they they their appointments lined up. I'm going to the I'm going there too. I'm going there too. Everybody lined up. All these got all these women in my family. Everybody getting their head done. And one of them went one day and got her hair done. It didn't turn out right. Just a bad day for the lady. I don't know. But it didn't turn out right. And when it didn't turn out right, they came back and they told every other lady in the family. I went there and they did. They messed up. I ain't going. I ain't going. I cancel my appointment. Cancel my appointment. Cancel. And I'm thinking to myself, she didn't mess up your head. &gt;&gt; Why you canceling your appointment? She ain't do nothing to you cuz sisters sometimes take on other people issues. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm being honest now. Brothers don't think this way. &gt;&gt; If if if if it's three of us brothers or four of us brothers and one of them have a a a a falling out, that don't mean I got to stop hanging out with them because man, y'all just need to make that thing right. I ain't got no problem with them. All right. &gt;&gt; We see it by love. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to tell you, don't let the devil use little itty bitty things &gt;&gt; to break up the fellowship in the church. &gt;&gt; We got to be cemented &gt;&gt; by the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they got cemented by the love of God and the building was complete, that's where 2 Chronicles 5:14 came &gt;&gt; the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord that fill the house of God. Brother Random says this and I'll just try to wind this down. The purpose of us coming to church is because God desires to have fellowship with his people. I want to say God has provided us a place so we can come and have fellowship with him. Other thing brother Random said is that God dwells in threes and God is perfect in threes. And when we looked at Moses tabernacle, God dwells in threes. It's the outer court, the inner court, the most holy place. God is perfected in three. It's the father, the son, and the holy ghost. But when it comes to our individual person uh on our spiritual journey, there's there's a there's a place that we must walk. There's through through justification, through sanctification, and through baptism of the Holy Ghost. Justification is when we repent of our sins and and and we realize that there is nothing held against us. &gt;&gt; Sanctification causes us to live a life that is pleasing to God according to his word. The reason we dress the way we dress is because God said it in his word. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And when we read it in his word, we say, "Lord, I'm going to follow your word. I'm not going to do this the way I think it should be done, but I'm going to follow your word. You said, you said this, so I trust your word." &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, and sanctification, we talked about last week. When you sanctify, I don't believe Christians be drinking and sanctified. &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians be smoking and sanctified. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Not sanctified and living a life like that. God had to deliver you from something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. So when we're sanctified, we don't live that type of lifestyle anymore. &gt;&gt; We we we we shun those things. Right. So it it was it's there's three three three things that God provides for us is justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to make this is how we'll make a rapture. And I want to just inject this because um you know recently we had a uh a um a wonderful testimony here. Brother Josiah, he um he desired to be rebaptized. He sent me a text and he said, "Pastor, is it is it is it um if I've been baptized once before, is it okay to be baptized again?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's no problem." He said, "Well, the first time I got baptized, I kind of did it because my parents wanted me to do it." He says, "But now I'm at a spot where I want to do it because cuz I want to do it." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Okay, brothers, no problem." Said, "We'll we'll we'll we'll get something set up." So, uh, I knew that, you know, he had this desire. And a few weeks had gone by. And then another brother approached me, you know, he says, "Brother Jack, I want to be baptized." I said, "Wow." I said, "Brother, we going to get you to the water quick." So, you know, I set up the next week for that brother to be baptized. called me like the day before and he says, "Brother Jack, I got something come up. I can't be baptized." And I had already told Brother Josiah, "Hey, I'm going to baptize this brother. I will baptize both of y'all at the same time." So, uh, the other brother couldn't do it. Brother Josiah. And after we left church that day, I said, "Brother Josiah, it is thundering lightning." And I said, "Brother, we have to just delay it a little bit." He says, "Okay." So, he went home and he text me says, "Pastor, can I be baptized next Sunday?" I said, "No." I said, "You come today &gt;&gt; at 7:00 tonight. Meet me at my house. We're going to baptize you today. Somebody want to be baptized like that. You get you make time and you get them in the water." &gt;&gt; So, Brother Josiah came and we baptized him and and I never even announced it to the church. Nobody even knew. But some of some of the brothers knew cuz he told them about it and they were witnesses of him being baptized. His mom and his dad was there. So he come and we baptized him and prayed for him and and and brother Brandham told us that when we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we've repented and we've done everything we're supposed to, he says, then God is obligated &gt;&gt; to fill us with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So brother Josiah had become an a candidate for God to actually fill him with the Holy Ghost. So here in our meetings, &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it happened in our meetings &gt;&gt; cuz I always hear about people going to other places and receiving an experience with God. But you can have an experience with God right here &gt;&gt; if you come with the right expectation. &gt;&gt; And while brother Gwyn was up there preaching, Amen. And uh uh uh and and he asks us just to begin to pray. Amen. and begin to uh uh just ask God for whatever. Brother Solomon's in the front asking God to fill his children with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And by the time he finished praying here, Brother Troy taps him on the shoulder and say, "I need to let you know your son just got filled with the Holy Ghost." Right there in those meetings, right there in those meetings, God came down and filled one of our young people with the Holy Ghost. Now look, I want I want to wet the appetite of some of the other young people. If if you if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, say, "Lord, you did it for Brother Josiah." &gt;&gt; And I know you have no respect of persons. I'm looking for you to do the same thing for me. God is still filling people with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost gives you power to live right. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, you're not going to be able to make it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz the devil going to throw everything in your direction. &gt;&gt; If you want to be able to withstand every onslaught of the enemy, you're going to need the same thing Jesus had. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit and the word. &gt;&gt; And that's why we we preach the spirit and the word at spirit and &gt;&gt; truth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The question that Stephen asked in Acts chapter 7 verse 48. How be it the most high? We know Solomon built him a temple and Moses had a a tabernacle. But but but the question was asked. How be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet. Heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool. But the question is, what house will you build me? Sayeth the Lord, what is the place of my rest? Let me tell you something. It's not these chairs that we sit in, &gt;&gt; but it's the people that's sitting in the chairs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where God wants to rest. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the hearts of his believers &gt;&gt; is where he wants to rest. &gt;&gt; But in these temples that would be dedicated for his glory and for his honor. &gt;&gt; And my question to you, are you ready to build God his house? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to dedicate God his house? &gt;&gt; Are you ready to open up your heart and give him a place of rest? &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, if you've never given God that place of rest in your heart, I want to invite you to do that today. this dedication service. If you've never ever committed to serving the Lord, I want to give you an opportunity to dedicate yourself. And Lord, I'm going to follow your word. I repent of my sins. I'm sorry for all the things I've done wrong, my thoughts, my ideas. I'm sorry. My sin, I'm sorry, but I need you, Jesus, to come in and take over. And you, you said if I repent, then you also told me to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. If you have never been baptized in Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you let us know. We'll get you to the water quick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has promised that he'll fill you &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost, which gives you power to live &gt;&gt; according to his word. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was given so that we could continue the works of Christ. Brother Random made the statement and I um I want to just uh this is in the message uh dedication. I just want to read a couple things here and then we we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll have a a time of prayer for dedication. Two things that I want to do here as we bring this to a close. One is I want us individually and collectively to just have a dedicational personal prayer with God. Secondly, I need to uh pray for all the the the the young people and teachers that are going back to school. We want to have a prayer for them. Um and I'm I'm with our time limit. Uh the way I'm going to do it is a little different. I'm going have everybody just come. We got space where I can just line everybody up right along here and I'll pray for you one by one. But we want to do that for all of our teachers or students that are going uh to school. Amen. For the next year here, let me just read this and then I'll in dedication. It says, "What a shame. What a disgrace. What a dispose that Nimrod man-made achievement was brought to them. When Nimrod tried to build a building or an organization that would reach up to the heavens and God upset it, it became a shame. Instead of helping man, he could he confuse the language of man so one could speak to another. He broke up the brotherhood. But when God came down to his own temple, the church, the people when he came to them, he filled it. The temples that were dedicated, just like he did at Solomon's temple, he filled it not with creeds and with denominations, but with himself. He filled the temple with his shakina glory. Lord, let it be. &gt;&gt; So did he do on the day of Pentecost, he filled them 120 temples. And I noticed in Solomon when they when they dedicated the temple, they had 100 people uh with with instruments. But then also on the day of Pentecost, there was 120 there where the spirit of God came down. It's something about that. And I know we we our old church we had 120 chairs. So it's just something about that. But but here uh he says so did he do on the day of Pentecost he filled them with 120 temples that was up there with him with with with himself with the Holy Ghost itself. The shakina glory broke through upon them. And then when Nimrod failed to do then what Nimrod failed to do built a temple where every man spoke contrary to what he could understand. God came down and with one Galilean language made every man understand what he was saying and what it was. So there's God to his temple, God to his dedicated temple, not to a man-made achievement, not to what man done, but what God did himself. He goes on to says, "Oh, it's silly to the people. They don't get it. They were born not to get it. So they won't get it." The Bible says so. All right. God always fills his temple. At the day of dedication, he fills his temple. He fills it with himself. The same thing today. God will fill every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him. Any person that will the temple is not this building here. The temple is not one in Salt Lake City. The temple is not one not the one in Rome. The temple is you. &gt;&gt; Know ye not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost. The spirit of God dwells in you. He says he says uh the temple is you. You are the temple that God wants to dwell in and express itself through it that all nations might know him. You are the living image of God that God wants to work through. He says, "And any time that any man or any woman will forget all the falsehood that they've heard in the world and come back to that line of the scripture and will keep it in line, just like Solomon did to what Moses did, Moses did to what God did, God always respected it. You are the temple that God wants to dwell in. &gt;&gt; I want to invite us to all stand. Um we want to just have a a moment just a a moment where we pray and uh in this prayer. Um this is everyone just first of all let's all in our prayer just thank God for providing a place to meet with us at &gt;&gt; and uh and then after we do that I want you also in that that time of prayer just to um pray a just a dedicational prayer to God from you to him. I'm not going to tell you what to say. I want you to speak from your heart to his heart that God, I'm just dedicating myself for your glory and for your honor cuz I'm the temple that you dwell in. Not not not Solomon's temple, not Moses tabernacle, but you're the temple that God wants to dwell in. So, I want you to pray and let's just have this time where we we dedicate amen ourselves to the Lord. Uh we'll also dedicate this building. I'll read a prayer in a second, but let's just take a few minutes just to have a prayer to the Lord individually uh and collectively. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone pray. Father, I come to myself to your glory. I ask God everything. Father, I thank you Lord that you provide this place that I can come to worship you. Lord, I just appreciate you in my father. I just I rededicate my life to you, Father. Glory to Jesus. I want you to be redeemed for all that I do. Father, Father, I want you to see it by the love of God in this place. I pray God, Father, my hands are lifted because I surrender my every Oh Jesus, your spirit Jesus I commit myself. Lord Jesus, I give my name. Lord, I give myself. Oh God, I give myself away. I give myself away. Ask me fatherus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. We dedicate ourselves for his glory and for his honor. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Here I want to just read um a little something from God's prophet out of dedication of the building to the Lord. I'm going to paragraph 56 in that quote. This is a prayer that the prophet prayed. And if you all just bow your heads as we read this prayer. Says, "Almighty God, we come into thy presence, bringing to thee the works of the hands of the children of men. This tabernacle that tears and sacrifice and labor has brought its material careful hands has designed it and made it a place." And upon their hearts was the same burden that was on David's heart. It's not right not right for us to worship in this old dilapidated shack when many of us live in good homes. Oh Lord God, let it be so that the same Holy Ghost and the same articles of God will be preached in the antitype how now in this tabernacle. May the Holy Spirit move today and come through the doorway and settle upon everyone. May the power of the living God be in this tabernacle. May it always stand to the glory of the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord God, we commit it to you the work uh the works of the hands, the labor, the toils, the cares. And Lord, may it may it not be in vain. &gt;&gt; But many people realize it's dedicated message this morning to you in the dedication of the tabernacle. May it be Lord that your spirit will come into this place. May every man or woman that that's out of Christ when it walks through that door, may it recognize that it's coming under the blood. May there be such a feeling here of the blessedness of Christ, the sweetness of the spirit until men and women will flow from all parts of the city and round about to hear the gospel from here. May this congregation be so seasoned and salted with the baptism of the Holy Ghost until they'll be called the salt of the earth. Grant it, Lord. Hear our prayer this morning. Not only do we give you this tabernacle, but we give ourselves to you in service for this tabernacle and for this cause in which it stands for. Oh God, receive us this morning. We are your children. We stand here this morning to our feet, our hands up, our eyes looking up because we believe that the Holy Spirit is present. Hear us, Lord, and receive our prayer and receive our com commemoration of your goodness, the works of your hands as we present it to you. May the power of God take our sacrifice and take us with it and dedicate both the tabernacle and congregation to the kingdom of God and the work of his son. For we ask it in Jesus Christ's name as we give it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. I will ask Sister Bernice if she would come just play that song for us. I give myself away. Um and I'll ask for our uh students and our teachers. Uh if they would come and just line up right here in the front. Um we will anoint you with oil. Those that are going to school, we want to pray over you. We live in a society where we don't take it for granted that we need God's protection when our children go to school, when the teachers go to school. There are so many mass shootings that happen uh in schools nowadays and we like to just cover them um with prayer. Uh so students and teachers please come quickly. Students and teachers, please come quickly. Uh we will anoint you all and uh just everybody line up just like this right across like this. There students and teachers, everybody just find your place. Amen. Just line up right across. Brother Simba's going to come. He's going to anoint you and um praise the Lord. The the uh parents, you all can be seated. Just uh pray over them while you're there in your uh in your your seats. Amen. Praise the Lord and give myself away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.

Father, Lord, as we have come to this place, Lord, and we have rededicated our lives, Lord, along with this sanctuary, Lord, you have prepared us for such a time as this, Lord Jesus, in the age that we now live in, Father, to be vessels, Lord, that can be used by you. So, Father, I pray, Lord God, that you would anoint every vessel, Lord, to fulfill your will and your desires concerning us, Lord. Everything that you have called us to be, Lord, may we so be. May we surrender all that we are to you, Lord. You said whosoever would follow you, may they take up their cross daily and follow you, Lord. So Lord, as we crucify ourselves, Lord, to this world, Lord, and surrender our lives, Lord, dying to our own wills, Lord Jesus, that your will may be accomplished in us. I I pray, Father, move, Lord, in every fiber of our being, Lord. Lord, we want to surrender our all to you, Father. We want to be available at any gi given second, Lord. Lord, to give a a reason for the hope that lies within us, Lord, to be a testimony, Lord Jesus, to somebody, Lord Jesus, Lord, that we can help somebody along the way to see you, Father. We can't leave this place, Lord, until every son and daughter of God has come in. So, Father God, use us, Lord. We give ourselves to you as we prepare to leave this place, but never your presence. Find rest in us, Lord Jesus. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost. We thank you for our pastor, Lord Jesus, that you were able to use them, Lord, to stand behind the sacred desk to speak to us, Father. Lord, we heard you this morning, Lord, and now we obey your word. find your rest in us that you may find the rest of your children. Father, be with your children. Lord, keep each one. Bless each one. Bring us all back at the appointed time, Lord. And Father, may we have perfect fellowship with you and with one another. We love you, Father. We commit all things into your hands. It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you. Our brethren will come and dismiss you. God bless you. Heat.
