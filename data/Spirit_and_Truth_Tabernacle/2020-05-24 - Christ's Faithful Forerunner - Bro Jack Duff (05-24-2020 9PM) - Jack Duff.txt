that app so we just accent all the saints would just go and download quickly a man again talking about our giving you do have the ability online to give if you're streaming and I do thank God for those that are a man online and just making a conscious decision to give a man I think it's a real blessing I was thinking on this the other day when you go to a restaurant you eat you always give something for the meal right and if you are eating spiritually you should give something for the meal I bring it along if that alright alright man we a men lower I'll just leave it in leave that between you and God that's what God said the same so but you have the ability to give online and that's through cash app you can do that we have their own on the bottom so going to cash simple spirit of true tea you can sell the offering or tithing or whatever through cash also if you want to use PayPal you just choose send to a friend or family member and you would use the email address of giving at John 4:23 or giving at John four to three so keep that in mind those that are in the sanctuary we have our box there on the table the wooden box that you would put your offering your tithing in and you can do that after before or after service but we'll prove our giving at this moment to a man and move forward in the service father we thank you for the ability to be able to give and law we actually to it use this for the furthest of your kingdom God be glorified and magnify and all that we do thank you for being a provider thank you Lord for God just all that you have done and just showing and proving yourself over and over again that you are at work father even now so we thank you Lord that you've allowed us to come back into the house to the Lord today thank you for our precious same-store that are considered at risk by God you kept them through this entire time if you allowed them to come back into the house of the Lord and today God was grateful for that and Lord those that are still at home and God made me desire we pray that you open up doors for him to be able to get back into the house of God as well I get all the glory and all the honor and we forget to turn our attention towards the word of the Lord we pray that she would just minister to his father even right now through your word bless those that are watching online and got me you've ministered to them as well right where they're sitting be glorified in magna fired in the service this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you musicians thank you so much man I will just prepare to read a a couple scriptures ma'am and see here they're very familiar scriptures that we'll read today one is Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 and then also Revelation chapter 10 and verse 7 we'll just kind of take our time with this particular subject there is you know we we we are I feel we're responsible for the stream that we have and there are people that are watching us that have never even heard about our church and what we're all about they're just see us as a church and that's perfectly fine we are a church a man but but there's something that we believe as a church and you know there are things that you can go in other churches you don't even really know what they believe if you if you ask them questions they really wouldn't be able to give you answers but there's there's things that we believe and you know and we're just kind of not necessarily reestablishing a man it's just you know we want to take our time and kind of go through this and I think it's almost - some of us it's almost going like almost like a rehearsal but others this may be something brand-new that they have never heard before and so I want to do all I can to make sure I take time to explain you know from scripture where we stand if the Bible a man does not provide our foundation to our belief then something wrong somewhere and so I mean you hear strange things coming on this string strain with what is that never heard that before well let's try to go back to Scripture and help us to understand you know where we're coming from praise the Lord if I could just let the people know that when we're saying the things that we're saying we you may not realize it but we have stepped into a vision a man we have entered into a vision there there was prophecy in scripture actually written about us a man before we were born right while we were yet sinners there was a prophecy in Scripture written about us it didn't have my name per se a man but it did have my condition is that right my heart was messed up I was mixed up I was turned all around but I needed my heart to be turned yes sir and I'm stepping into a vision a matter what Malachi wrote about me years ago and I pray that through the preaching of the word somebody else will step into Oh glory to God a man so I want to read here from Malachi chapter 4 a man hallelujah glory to God a man Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and verse 6 and also revelation 10 and verse 7 it says here behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord hallelujah I just I just love that you know when Elijah he called he said no rain it was a drought in the land and they say they're gonna be any rain until I called for it and and even when he spoke these words it impacted him because the river that he was getting water from that river dried up so God told him say now I got a I got a place for you to go and there's a woman that's gonna sustain you once you once you get there she's gonna sustain you now and he showed her a vision of this woman and everything and I should have two sticks and you know and how she be kind of talking about her condition and you know how bad things were said but that's gonna be the woman that I told us to stange and what caused that woman to look at the situation look different she said he's saying give me a drink of water say I'll go get you some water they said why are you on the way would you bake me a cake it's now hold on no look you don't cross the line I'm get ready to make my last cake for my son and for myself and we gonna die I give me the water but the cake he said no no go bake it for you you serve em for yourself but flat faithful oh that was yes soon as she heard thus saith the Lord she knew the drop could could could couldn't keep it from from coming forward right she knew she knew things was gonna change soon as she heard I said look but I want you to understand he was only said oh so can I read this again behold I see me well I said you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord so you have to be able to see yourself in Scripture who is this Elijah that God is sending me all right and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of that let's go to Revelation 10 a man in verse 7 glory glory these are scriptures and notice I'm reading from Malachi if you notice in your Bible that was the very last verse of the Old Testament very last verse God put something in there in the Old Testament so that we could we can kind of catch it and another thing you got to kind of understand about that before Jesus came there was no New Testament all they had was the Old Testament that's all I mean the first four books of the gospel the New Testament it's read about the life of the Lord Jesus Christ right but before that there was only Old Testament so people hung everything what was written in the Old Testament her Amen hallelujah the Old Testament prophesied of Christ's coming a man the Old Testament prophesied of different Kings that would come amen the Old Testament prophesied that he likely would come before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord so we thank God for that but now over in the New Testament last book of the Bible again God puts something in Scripture that would help us look at this revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets a man this is a promise that God said he would do the mystery of God we finished in this time as you have just declared to his servants the prophets so let's pray over the word of the Lord amen as we just prepare to go into a little thought your father we just thank you a man for the word we thank you for scripture that we can read we trust our God that the Holy Spirit would take control of our thoughts and got you or speak to you people right where they are we have a responsibility to bring truth the Bible says that we shall know the truth and the truth will make us free so speak to our hearts God today in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated I want to just read a quote here out of spoken words original seed just to open us up and we're actually gonna grab our title from this particular quote so let's just read this just to open things up it says in and and as as I'm reading this I need to again bring to our attention that we have been on a journey through step into the vision that that's been that's been the journey that we started out this year and this is all birth from you know what is this great vision that that God has for us because 2020 you know a year of vision people would say perfect vision or you know a complete vision or whatever it is but you know a lot of people have identified this year's a year of their vision and and want to see visions come to pass or dreams that they might have expectations that they might set they want to see it and it's perfectly fine that we establish ourselves natural goals and objectives I think there's nothing wrong with that I think that's real good but I had to go a little deeper than just the natural goal for myself I say Lord what is your vision a man for me that I need to step into not only just for me but what is your vision for the church that we need to step into and God just begin to quicken to my spirit amen this this message that he gave his prophet that angel Lord came to the prophet and said pick up your pen and write and and as he was writing he was actually say this is a message to the church you know this this was a message to believers and and so so when I start looking at it here angel is telling the Prophet write these things down and he wrote it on me put inside a book in and out what I'm doing is just preaching portions of that I'm going kind of like almost paragraph by paragraph and grabbing inspiration and bringing it to the church because I want us to be locked into this vision that God has for us and we're stepping into that we're stepping into that so this this is the next portion you have to follow us throughout the whole year to get the whole thing that I'm that I'm bringing but I'll just you know if you don't do that just just take what you can today and we'll just keep building on that if that's all right so here in the message spoken word is the original seed part to the Prophet makes a statement like John the Baptist's Christ faithful forerunner the anointed prophet no school of his father no school of Pharisee no denomination can call him from the wilderness where God has sent him until he heard the voice of God the Messiah is at hand are you listening spiritual mind what more could I say here I'm skipping something here now so this is the Prophet actually a man giving us a portion of what the angel was telling him it says like John the Baptist Christ faithful forerunner a man and that's going to be our title today Christ faithful forerunner he says I like John the Baptist Christ faithful forerunner the anointed prophet a man no school of his father no school of Pharisee no denomination could call him from the willness where God has sent him nice and he could go says until he heard the voice of God Amen the Messiah is that him since are you listening spiritual mind now I was reading this and I don't think I actually caught this until I stood here this morning and just read the cou he says are you listening spiritual mind because here God you say prophets they meant to write this down glory to God glory to God like turn the Baptist's Christ's feet for forerunner the anointed prophet no school of his father no school of the Pharisee no denomination can call him from the wilderness where God has sent him until he heard the voice of God the Messiah's hand are you listening spiritual mine what more can I say here I'm skipping something here now he could have skipped it then because the people couldn't receive it but we can receive it today right amen when he said behold I send you he's talking to me glory to God so I can receive Elijah the prophet a man oh let's go you know just that scripture alone in Malachi 4 it speaks of two comings of Elijah one of them was actually in the Ministry of John the Baptist well I mean eat the scripture plainly tells us it was it was John the Baptist fulfilling that maybe we ought to just read that real quick I think it's going to be out of Luke chapter one a man hallelujah we gotta take time and just look at the Word of God for what it is so we know why we believe what we believe a man I'm not just quoting things just to quote things I'm believing this because it's in the word Amen Luke chapter one in verse verse 15 Oh glory to God amen it says for ye shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink now this is talking about John the Baptist you know John the Baptist as the angel Gabriel went and told his father what was given to happen and man Zechariah began to disbelieve this this this could be possible his wife had never been pregnant before him here here was old and aged and like how in the world could this happen but you know just because Zachariah disbelieved did not stop the promise from coming to pass and let me tell you something just because you disbelieve what God has written this word does not mean the word is not true Lord God you have you have you have a you have the choice to actually believe or not believe God make you believe this him he will present it to you and it's up to you to believe or not to believe hey man I want to tell you rather than just searching the internet Oh glory to God because even in even in Jesus day they did searching it's Laurie to God if they wanted to know who he was they did search and they did ask and they had questions and Jesus songs search the scripture to reveal to you what is true glory glory glory it since ye shall be great in the sight of the Lord and so drink neither wine nor strong drink and eat shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall be turned so he turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children so when you look at Malachi for the very first part of that John the Baptist is the one that reveals that to turn our hearts of the father's to the children to turn the hearts of the father's to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord now that's just it's just it's in Scripture it's in Scripture and we're talking about Christ Christ's faithful forerunner now I want to just kind of stay with me I was just looking at this because that quote sent the anointed prophet John the Baptist a man worth Christ's faithful forerunner John the Baptist was one of Christ's faithful forerunner amen let me put it that way and let notice this amen it said that the quote said Christ faithful flight John the Baptist Bryant's faithful forerunner the anointed prophet now just kind of reflecting on that because you know being a person that reads the Bible I mean why would the angel tell the Prophet to pick up his pen and write and then I if I John as an anointed prophet in action another another instance of the same quote in the church age book will read it later he called him a mighty prophet a mighty prophet amen now I was just wondering about that and and I'll give you the answer I just want to kind of put this out here for everyone a man why would the angel describe John as an anointed prophet or a mighty prophet you know John never worked one miracle John never healed anybody right but he's identified by the angel the Lord as a mighty prophet a man as an anointed prophet another thing you need to know about John his ministry only lasted six months along but yeah he's identified by the angel as a mighty prophet what could a man doing six months that he would give the description from an angel last mighty or anointed hallelujah when I think about an ornate prophets amen I think about Moses woman or thing that was on Moses and the mighty miracles that he performed that to lead the children Israel out of Egypt that was truly an anointing amen when Moses was out of the wilderness with the children of Israel and they got thirsty and he stood up and he took his rod and struck the rock and water came from a rock that was an anointed he wasn't supposed to because Christ is not struck twice but he did a second time he struck the rock your water came out even when God did tell him I do it what an anointing o Moses I think about Elisha amen we turned mine anointed prophets I think about the prophet Elijah he was so annoying he gave that woman a man her a promise of her barrel not going empty no oil not running dry because she heard thus saith the Lord and amen because of her obedience she received a me we saw the same Elijah raise the dead we started say me to call down fire fire come down and consume you and your fifty fire come down consume the first fifty then the King say sitting up set up another liter system and say go up and tell that prophet I said come down now say no no you say you say uh the guys say that's Robert it's the Prophet King said come down now he say if I am a man of God let fire come down and consume you and your fifty fire come down from heaven spoken word destroyed him are you talk about an anointed don't play with God don't play with an anointed prophet the King say I ain't satisfied I want him to come down now see a plague has struck this King a plague was on his King and he had a diseased in his feet and he went to coax out some false God what was gonna happen so so the prophet interrupted the journey and say go tell him he gonna die say is there not a God in Israel what you running out to these false cross way well why are you going up to some of these phenomenal like that say you say Seiko tell them I said come down this third guy say look now I tell you what I don't see any other ones go down they make it back to the camp say I'm gonna prove to a little different thing yeah I'm going imma go up and I'm gonna beat you up get your command he saved my profit please spare me and my men we want to go back home non-families we just asking you please would you come down and see the king man said God said go go with him because of his approach prophet then he was able to get a man a response from the prophets hallelujah but he was not moved amen by what the King said he was only moved by thus saith the Lord that was an anointed prophet I thought about Jeremiah a man when we were looking at an orchard prophets Jeremiah prophesied to nations Jeremiah also told the children of Israel that their bondage were only last for 70 years hallelujah I love that statement that their bondage will only last for seventy years I want to tell you the Lord sent its temporary bondage some of your loved ones are in what we call temporary bonds there's a stopping point let C be the name of Lord got to come out somehow in some way that sickness that you're fighting in your body it's a temporary bondage glory to God your finance is being by the devil it is a temporary bondage glory to God you might have been depressed but you are coming out a man you might have been sick but you are coming out a man in your children were bound but they are coming your children but they are coming out your finances were tight but you are coming into abundance let's hippie the name of the Lord everything you're going through the change is temporary but the thing is gonna change after that time amen whatever I'm going through his temporary is about to change I believe that hey man I sure was an anointed prophet you I shall a boy a man it's need the boys need seven times and he brought the boy back to life a man he likes to cause an axe head to fluke when a man dropped his accent and borrowed axe into the lake into the water the man we're gonna say like sure I borrowed it I need that expecting and Laksha worked American accent I mean it's supposed to it's supposed to go to the bottom but some hey brought it back up to the top yes what a miracle by life a man walks a mamey Lisha part of the jordan just like he lied to did he lie sure prayed for the spirit sleep our casita could see but he also could see people watching the stream that can see Elijah raise the dead Elijah comes an axe head to float he partner to pray for the spiritually blind healed people of leprosy provided a strategy to pay off debts a man he lied to cause an entire army to be planted Elijah one of the other great miracles cuz he Eli sure had a double portion I'll be like just period tight he like gentle work eight miracles he like shut work sixteen miracles yes and did you know what a 16th miracle was he the sixteenth miracle is something that happened while he was dead that's right hey Eli shoes off to see bones a menace get it already rotted flesh it fell from his bones but while his bones were in we're in agreement may got thrown onto a dead warrior mustard on the top of Elijah's boots and because the dead warrior it the prophets goes and comes to worry to come back up to his feet go right back into battle my man hit some dead pose that was he like shot so miracles were still happening even though he was anointed the ad to call John a man with a six month ministry a man that never worked one miracle the angel said he was anointed the angel call him a mighty prophet I know many y'all already know the answer to that but let me just keep you in suspense hallelujah let's go back and look at this our title is Christ faithful forerunner now I looked at that word for run a forerunner and just one to kind of find out you know what what is what is the what is the Greek lexicon saying about this one and I and I pulled it up and it said a forerunner is one who is sent before to take observations or act as a spy a scout a light armed soldier one who comes in advance to a place where the rest are to follow a man so had these multiple definitions and and as I thought about this definition of a 4-run that someone sent before to take observations or act as a spy or scout I couldn't help but think about the 12 spies a man of Israel they were sitting to go in and look the land a man and come back with report they were actually for running hallelujah because this this land is promised land that God had given the children of Israel years before they actually came a man even on the scene God had already prophesied to Abraham that he was going to give his people a promised land now when the children Israel rose up came from underneath the bondage on their way into the Promised Land do you realize that they had stepped into a vision of what God had told him that they were not supposed to stand Egypt that they were gonna come out and go to a promised land hallelujah you know when God called Israel out of Egypt that was considered an exodus hey man and when God called us out our denominational churches guess what happened we went into another Exodus but there's a third one Amen that's waiting for us and that's us coming out of this world and going into a rapture and awaiting us all right hallelujah all right listen those 12 spies winning they scouted the land and and they brought back a report hallelujah and an antenna despised just begin you know talk about the good things they're carrying the grapes of the land and they're showing the people how prosperous the land is but yet they're also giving a negative report hallelujah but there were two in the midst of the twelve that saw something different they looked at the Giants in the land they looked at all the problems they hallelujah they also looked at some of the websites Lauria some of the descriptions on the land they looked at it but they also searched the scripture they said God made us a promise and if God is for us and who can be against us with the word of God and those that go in and see the promise they had to wait 40 years but they because of their we know in their their stories of the Lord well who is this prophet and God is sending me and this is why I always make this comment if it wasn't where Miriam Brenham cuz the script that scripture that I read in Malachi 4 was written to me hallelujah if it wasn't william brennan you better give me somebody because god told me that he was sending lots of the prophet yes sir all right all right all right all right I told you hey man let's go back and look at this thing from a scriptural standpoint those twelve spies were scouting it out brought back an evil report but Joshua and Caleb brought a good reports that we're more than able to take the land don't worry about the the the the Giants and look we might we not grasshoppers that's what that's what the children Israel thought is they were guys huh but Josh said we have more than over we're more than able to overcome them Caleb said we're more than it's how you look at yourself amen you ain't even hit me because [Music] he was representing God gathered a missive is slinging me just one rock took Goliath down yes Oh God need us just one rock come on hallelujah stop seeing yourself defeated I mean even if you got symptoms you can come out of them [Applause] let's defeat it see yourself victorious speak the Word of God a key word for word hallelujah DS Amen this this uh forerunner they managed want someone who sit before to take observation to act as a spy or Scout and here we got the twelve spies unfortunately the majority of the spots ten of them brought back can even reported a promised land and that evil report caused an entire generation to miss their blessing because they believed an evil report rather than believing the Word of God I want to say this again amen there's people that research this stuff on the internet and they are getting an evil report and by you looking at the evil report you are missing your blessing you'll find yourself wandering around from church to church Israel's own attorney was going from one city to the next city and what happens here's they go from church to church and they say we found the word we're free we got the word but you can't stay satisfied in that church right amen blessed be the name of glory to God I'm talk about going from one denominations in the next denomination now you know if me if I had to move right if God took me and say you got to leave West Palm Beach you got to move or whatever I can guarantee what I'm looking for wherever I'm going is another message just moving just to be moving we go you saw a house where you said be wrong is there a church there and is that the same church also I think of a men is forerunner someone said before to take observation after spy I think about the two spies that rehab received a man Rahab the harlot see two spies into the home and because of her receiving the message from the spies she was given a token for her beat and that talk about if you just this business this car that you've let out your window to let us down by keep that cord hanging out the window and when we come in to take the land because rehab knew that and all the people of Jericho knew that the land was gonna be given to Israel they they were just waiting on the time she said we're afraid of y'all coming here say but please give me a token spare me and my family they say we'll spare you and your family but all you got to do is get your family in the house yo family can be on the streets top out they know ray anybody can say that I used to work with the Lord I know that's Bo but that's what Jesus was telling them amen back there in the book of John he got old in the book of john and i'm mateus we get closer and closer to the coming of the lord you gonna hear that gospel get both because we be trying to just you know work with people's feelings trying to work with a emotions but God ain't thinking about your emotions he gave me promise do you believe I do don't you believe right all right we come with coming further hallelujah live them dim sum spies that she received a men they were Scouts they were spies they were taking observation they were observing how the people were feeling they knew the time it come for them to go in and take the land God gave them a strategy to marching around the walls and as they marched around the walls for six days and on the seventh day they march seven times but at the end of that seven times they had to be still glory to God and they couldn't say a word during the time of his marching but then finally John said now it's time to let out a great shout and when they let out the great shout the walls came tumbling down all this was because of two spies giving a good report a man when I think about somebody being a forerunner sent before to take observation as an act as a spy or spout I also thought about brother Branham having the ability to scout out and tell us what heaven was like but he also scouted out and you can tell us what Hale was like yes so so let me just make this very clear I'm gonna take a prophetic definition of what heaven is like and I'ma take a prophetic experience and definition of where hair looks like there's many people I mean it's all over the internet so I went to heaven it was like a big park but if all children ain't at home eating momma's mine is wondering if one guy weren't one child is missing a man glory to God so when we get to the marriage supper of the Lamb i'ma want to see all her children glory glory glory glory somehow someway majestic fingers will unravel the knots and we're gonna see how we got to see our promises coming to pass hey I say it's a temporary bondage man it's temporary bondage the devil has limits all right glory to God so here this other definition is a forerunner is one who comes in advanced to a place where the rest will follow and I love this a man one who comes in advance to a place where the rest will follow now I want to read a scripture in here a man because as a forerunner if you're running a man with the message you're coming to a place where the rest will follow you coming you got to have a message that you're given the people John the Baptist had a message that he was giving the people brother Branham had a since that he was given the people they were both Christ's faithful forerunners a man now so I want to just kind of hit a scripture out of our second Samuel 18 and verse 19 was down to verse 19 if you were a forerunner if you will elect it to be a forerunner you had to have a message amen glory to God you had to have something to say glory to God even if you are a forerunner you you let me let me make that very clear if God has called you to be a forerunner you have to have a message with something to say so yeah I mean we got other ministries that came on the scene during the same time brother Branham is here Billy Graham wonderful ministry all Roberts wonderful ministry but we're talking about the message that the man would have what is the message that they have to say hallelujah glory glory let's look at this a man in 2nd Samuel 18 and we'll start at verse 19 thank you Jesus this man was a forerunner or he warned it to be a forerunner thank you Jesus verse 19 second Samuel 18 and it says this at 19 all right then said ah Hamas the son of Zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how did the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies I said I want to go tell the King what has happened to his enemy hey man this was a time where Absalom had risen up against David and now Absalom is dead but this man ah he mobs he realizes that something has happened but I can tell you before we get to the end this man wants to run but he has no message hallelujah and we got many people running today but you don't have a message oh we want to know the message I told you we are rainbow trouts yes Amen glory Lord we Warwick we want to know the voice behind the sign yes alright look it says then said I he mines the son of Zadok let me now run a better King tidings now that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies and Joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no time is because the king's son is dead it says then said joy after Cushi go tell the King what thou has seen and Khushi bound himself unto Joab Marant now coz she saw something a man maybe Hamas is just noticing how the people I responded he don't know nothing but cuz she saw something hallelujah so could she can run because of what he saw amen I can stand with this message because of what I see glory to God I'm going up what I see in Scripture yes glory amen say they said try because she go tell the King what I had seen and curse she bowed himself unto Joab and ran then said ìiím out are you miles the son of Zadok yet again a joy app but howsoever let I pray thee also run after Khushi and Joab say wherefore without run my son seeing that thou has no tidings ready what's running for what's your purpose you look at this man now now I'm going to tell you why this man is running like this it's a it's a selfish motive they say he tonight i'ma run after Khushi now watch what happens to him watch this is verse 23 but howsoever said he let me run and he said of him run then I amaz ran by the way of the plane and over and Khushi hallelujah he over ran Khushi he's a bull Rama but he over ring Khushi Joe Ranft told him here you ain't got no message but you gotta watch your spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory to God watch this now watch it it says verse verse 23 whosoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then I am a strand by the way of the plane and over and cushy and David sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone and the widespread cried and told the king and the king said if he'd be alone there is tidings in his mouth hallelujah and he came a pace and drew near watch and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called into the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of a hamas they can tell him about a way here and they can tell his spirit by the things that he did come on somebody glory to God look he says the watchman said me think of the running of the foremost it's like the running of our mouths the son of Zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings and is called and said unto the king all is well look at it and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the Lord I caught we'd have to live it up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord o king now you know David's ok we won the battle but David got a very special special interest because he told some people now go out there and deal gently deal gently with Absalom look at this and the King I feat now he don't you know blast be a new king and you know King Lim fair he got all these praises for the king he got an ulterior motive huh Laurita God you don't have to leave you can't get lifted up in praises the Sopot will lift you up to take you listen a man accessor and the king said is the young man Absalom faith in our mouths answer we enjoy upset the king's servant and me thy servant I saw a great talk too much but I knew not what it was he had no message yeah I saw these rocks powder but I didn't know what it was he could she have seen something my success observing victory but really don't know what's going on what happens here he died he died because she to the punch the gave his message but didn't have nothing the sake see you don't be running trying to get in the pulpit [Applause] watch this now a man verse 30 it says in the King said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still you really ain't done nothin funny yet all your running you ain't done nothing [Music] [Music] [Applause] glory to God I don't know just feed us amen Daniel Alliance team huh amen we've been hearing it for years give us a little bit more to that hallelujah glory the God is enough same yesterday today and we need a man with a message something that will settle our hearts something that will settle our spirits all of our spiritual questions [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] glory glory glory let me keep reading a man a man the King said unto Him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still and behold Cushie king and could she said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged Eve this day of all them that rose up against thee now he's almost saying the same thing this where the message changes because we all got the same Bible we all reading the same thing right but but there's and if I could just put this way the message is actually written in between the lines now you say it's the brother Jack what'd you mean by that what happened in the Garden of Eden if you want to really understand you have to read between the lines glory to God and otherwise you'll get stuck hallelujah you still be thinking some apple or apricot or something no no no no no no no no adultery took place in the garden folk got pregnant hey man you better read between the lines and even though the Bible say that Eve got a man from the Lord that don't stop right there guess it's brother branham said either I was listening to a tape I mean a video last night brother around at Bisco he had fellowship with brother Branham he was talked about he had a question Lord help me I'm come back to his take that down just for a second take that and what verse is that 31 I'm coming back to it but he said he said he has some questions have been he sought an angel the Lord moving in brother branham's ministry but he just is like man this don't seem right the see God manifesting this way himself this way but I'm here some strange things about this doctrine any teaching so brother bisque I had questions and he is somebody told us it weren't you just right brother branham a letter an accident come hunting up here in this area and maybe you can get some of your questions answered he say he get letters from everywhere ain't no way you're gonna respond to mine so he said all right I'm just doing anyway he just sent the letter sent the letter he was living in one city sent the letter he had moved from that city and some of my brother branham still caught up with him and said yes I'll be glad to come he said okay well he come he arranged the hunt and got brother branham out there hunting and and as they were hunting brother branham's on his horse and the Holy Spirit say auntie Bisco got three questions for you this is one this is two this is three so he come back to the camp that night say you know what I think I'm gonna go get a rabbit for us to eat tonight brother Ram say let's go get a rabbit it says that brother for the biscuit would you like to join us join me and say yeah I'll be I'll be glad to join you there was another brother in the camping and the other brother say well y'all going to get a rabbit I think i'ma jump up and I'll go get her a bit too they said okay brother branham said come on Brother come on then the brother said no I'll just stay here and I wash the dishes my brother branham didn't tell him to do that but the Holy Spirit told him Eddie Bisco not him he ain't got no question Eddie Bisco got three questions and you gonna have to get Eddie Bisco alone to be able to talk to him call them I act like they was going to get rabbits and got it then just selling along he says the Holy Spirit told me you got these three questions first up first before even got to the questions they yaks brother Bisco and brother Briscoe have some say brother brother brother Branham I see all these people speaking in tongues and interpreting and prophesy and doing all this and they live in so many their lives are so ungodly what is this he says heart meaning receive just say what is this so brother Branham acts brother biscuits say have you heard my message on the anointed ones at the end time say brother Eddie put his head down and say I ain't even ain't heard your message on that I know I supposed to be listening to the message but I heard your message on that and then he said he realized brother Branham had not even preached that message it was five years before years later that brother Branham preached the message can I tell you how something about this message here I had this message in my notes 2018 waiting for the inspiration to come and preach it and we when we struck that quote and that I read to y'all in this angels message to the church that's when I knew it's time to bring forth this message hallelujah God is still God you gotta have something to tell people brother Branham said they say the angel said you have these three questions he said to explain the questions and one of them about the circus seat and he said he said the Bible say the Bible say that that she had a a child from the Lord for the brim said yes all children come from the Lord I don't care if it's from the worst relationship if it's from a momma that got pregnant without being married that child is still coming from the Lord amen we say all children come from the Lord God got to be involved in that birth in order for that child to get here your birth is a miracle your birth is a miracle the action one place brother Branham say you know your natural birth is more of a mystery then Mary's birth given birth to Christ all right so let's look at this let's keep reading hey man I don't know if I'm gonna make it to where I wanted to be how just have to cut off but I knew it's gonna be part 1 and part 2 to this cushy I'm talking about cushy well Chris you know maybe let's go back to the verse before that verse 30 it's Christian a Christian this was a Hamas that came first and King said to him turn aside and stand here and and he turned aside and stood still and then verse 31 the whole crew she came and because she said tied is my lord the king for the lord hath avenged ii this day for all them that rose up against thee and the king said in a cushy is the young man Absalom safe and Christian sir the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do the hurt be as that young man is cuz she had a message coz she could say something because she wasn't looking at just a pile of rocks and can identify why the rocks were there could she say the rocks was here because they buried Absalom that's what he saw with his eyes hallelujah glory glory glory glory verse 33 says in the King was much moved and went up to the Chamber's over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said oh my son Absalom and my son my son Absalom what God I had died for thee o Absalom my son my son cuz she had a message so we don't want just people running we want somebody running with a message John the Baptist had a message now I want to try to get to that point if I can maybe I will just slip back over there I'll skip this other part here and come back to this John the Baptist and we'll just finish it here no pray bring the other part out next week amen but here I want to repeat the quote out of spoken words original Steve says like John the Baptist Christ faithful forerunner the anointed prophet no school of his father no school of Pharisee no denomination could call him from the wilderness where God had sent him amen that ought to let you know if it's coming of educational school is probably not from God God dealt I mean God God used the man John the Baptist that had no education he used him also William Branham a man with a very limited education settled great education puts and notice our God did this set of great education seven letters in his first name seven letters in his middle name seven letters in his last name allowed him to go seven times around the world preaching the gospel 777 and God is a man completed in sevens hallelujah don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't miss this don't miss this watch God and his numbers right so so he says like John the Baptist Christ faithful forerunner the anointed prophet no school of his father no school of affair of a Pharisee no denomination could call him from the wilderness where God has sent him until he heard the voice of God the Messiah is at hand are you listening spiritual mind what more could I say here I'm skipping something here now now John the Baptist when we when we looked at him in Malachi Ford I also read Saint Luke one but we can look at a couple other scriptures that spoke of his ministry amen and and we're gonna try to try to bring this bring this close to home here Isaiah 40 a man verse three through five John the Baptist was fulfilling Scripture when when John the Baptist came on the scene if I could just a man I'll remind you if a scripture was spoken of about him before he got here when he came on the scene he was stepping into into the vision of that scripture hallelujah if the scripture was written before he got here John the Baptist became the manifestation of the scripture glory let's read I was there 40 verse 3 through 5 says the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the crew kit shall be made straight and the rough places plane and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken Isaiah is prophesying of the ministry of John the Baptist amen let's look at Malachi chapter 3 first one a man these are scriptures that are written about John the Baptist Malachi chapter 3 verse 1 we already read Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 now we got amen two other scriptures the Bible say a man out of the word of two or three let every word be a step of two or three witnesses let every word be established I'm giving you scripture to support that's why I say don't just search the internet search the scripture hallelujah Malachi 3:1 says behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you delight in but who he shall come saith the Lord of Hosts turn the Baptist when he's coming on the scene and stepping into the vision of Elijah amen if I say I should say and he's also stepping into the vision of Malachi hallelujah both of their prophets he spoke of the same man now in the New Testament let's pick it up in mark chapter one verse one through eight oh I love this I said all these different prophets that were anointed Elijah Elisha Jeremiah Moses Isaiah Daniel so many I mean absolutely anointed prophets of God but the angel identifies John the Baptist as a mighty prophet a man as an anointed prophet one that never worked a miracle one day in his life but yet he's considered anointed he's considered mighty let's look at this in mark one a man starting at verse 1 glory Holly says the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God as it is written in the prophets Marcus taking them back to the world taking them back to the Old Testament they didn't they didn't have a New Testament at the time that Mark was writing this right but my taking up mark taking them back to the Old Testament search the Scriptures a man not just take what anybody said search the scriptures it says as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy prepare thy way before thee right it says the voice of one crying in the wilderness preparing you the way of the Lord make his paths straight here mark identifies both what Isaiah said and what Malachi said glory to God he says John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins and there went out unto him all the land of Judea and they of Jerusalem and we're all baptized of him in the river of Jordan confessing their sins and John was clothed with camel's hair looked like a wild man and with a girl of a skin about his Lawrence and he did eat locusts and wild honey this don't sound much like the Prophet that's fulfilling the Word of God but yet he was since and preaching saying there cometh one mightier than I after me that latches that the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloosed I like this journalist not bringing the people to his ministry John is actually important to people to a greater ministry can I tell you something brother Branham did not bring us to his ministry he was always pointing us to a greater ministry and that is the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ recently I was asked the question I might as well say this while I'm here I'm going on I'm gonna keep reading some more I was actually questioned the brother Jack why do you have the picture of Christ hanging behind you in the pulpit I said because here this church we want the emphasis to be on Christ hallelujah and see what you got new people that don't know any better I think it's best to keep the emphasis on Christ they don't know any better right so I mean they gotta know about what we teach amen but the emphasis is always on Christ John the Baptist emphasis was on Christ brother branham's emphasis was on Christ he says if you read the Bible and every script if you don't see Christ he said go back and read it again alright let's keep reading mark 1:7 and preach preach Sam there cometh one night of the night after me the latchet of whose shoes I am not worried that it stooped down and unloose I indeed i baptize you with water but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost let's go on it says and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John and Jordan there's much to be said here and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the spirit the heavens open in the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son and whom I'm well pleased now the very purpose of Jesus coming to John to be baptized it was it was a show that before the sacrifice could be offered it had to be washed and the other thing that this shows us that the word which Jesus was the word the word always comes to the Prophet so here the word approached the Prophet in the Jordan and got baptized the sacrifice Amen was being washed before it could be offered that's why John that's why he when he said John suffered to be so that's why because the sacrifice had to be washed before it could be offered that's a mystery that people just couldn't they couldn't figure it out God sent that mystery to be revealed to us through a prophet amen let's go on a little further Oh actually that I'm supposed to stop there I'm I supposed to stop at verse 18 I don't know why I went further than that but but what I want you to see and I think I might have left something out here oh here's what I want to see and I'm gonna I'm gonna I got a quote here that I want to read to you why why would why would the angel called John anointed he never worked a miracle he never raised the debt he never healed the blind at eye he never did any of that his ministry on the last lasted six months but the angel said his ministry was mighty I missed the scripture I forgot to write it down but I know what it says jesus said that John's ministry was the greatest of all it was Matthew 11 let's read that Matthew 11 that's it that's it I want to tell you what Jesus said about John Matthew 11 why why will he be an anointed prophet never working a miracle look at Matthew 11 verse 2 look at this now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto Him art thou he that should come or do we look for another now here John is confused and the reason that he's a little confused because Jesus don't come out and just make it sense to me it so probably John knew that whoever he started out the Spirit is sending on and abiding that was the one that he was introducing that was that was effect but here when he gets into a little trial he starts to doubt a little bit and unfortunately many Saints have gone through trials and they begin to doubt a little bit God will bring you out to trial and notice this notice this notice watch what happened John says his disciples with this question the question is are out there he that should come or do we look for another and jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see he didn't even tell John I mean you got to catch that on your own you got to catch who the Prophet is for this day he's not gonna just come out and just plainly tell it to you you gotta you got to read between the lines watch this says he said go go go and show John again those things which he do hear and see the I received their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the Deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me can we go a little further I want to read this and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out to sea unto the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what I went out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold a that wear soft clothing our kings houses but what we go out for to see a profit yay I say unto you and more than a prophet never worked a miracle a six-month ministry and Jesus Jesus describes John's ministry as not just the Prophet but more than a prophet hallelujah why does Jesus say it that way verse 10 for this is he who is written search the Scriptures but this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I said to you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than john the baptist and he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and it be receive it this is Elias which was for to come he that hath an ear to hear either half ears to hear let him hear Jesus says that there was no greater prophet than John the Baptist I want to tell you the reason why the angel call him mighty well the aim to call him anointed even though he never worked a miracle even though he he never did anything he even stopped the Sun he didn't do nothing like that but the reason that his ministry was the great the reason Jesus was sadist about him is because John's ministry was to introduce the Messiah now can I read a quote from the message influence this would be it this for this portion of this message there's a little bit more that I must say we haven't gotten there yet but I want you to understand because I've read you Malachi 4 I haven't even got to Revelation 10 but Malachi 4 talked about two comings of Elijah and we already proved by scripture that there was that John the Baptist fulfilled the turn of the hearts of the father's to the children but there was another Elijah that was coming to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers and that's the day in which we live right now our hearts are being turned back to the Word of God the message influenced what did John the Baptist do the man that Jesus said there was never a man born of woman like him or could compare with him until that time there's not many churches you're gonna be able to go to and get a quote like that Billy Graham could have said it or Roberts couldn't said it Joel Osteen King said TD jakes King said great men of God but they can't say it like this this is a man that stepped into the vision of Malachi 4 and knew who he was so when he's preaching the message influence he says there was never a man born of a woman like him or I could compare with him until that time now why because he knows his ministry is just as anointed just as mighty and would be spoken the same one weight of Jesus because his ministry just like John's ministry was to introduce the Messiah John introduced him at the first coming brother branham's ministry is introducing him at the second coming let's go on that great prophet ordained of God before the foundation world spoke of 1200 1200 7 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before you ever before he came to earth by the prophet Isaiah here what did he do when he's seen a man come walking down out of the audience and he looked up above and saw the fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove he cried out I have need to be baptized of thee I must decrease he must increase God can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has a message ah he mods does not have a message who she has the message amen only one has the message you know I must decrease he is the messenger I've been up to I've been up to this time now he takes my place now John is John is referring to Christ brother branham is also referring to Christ he takes my place amen as Elijah when Elijah went up and throw back his rope to Elijah his ministry was finished Elijah must take up where he left off who was that representing today Elijah represents the bride that's why the spirit that brought in the Prophet will be saying the same thing Elijah went up and thrown back and roped Elijah his ministry was finished Elijah must take up where he left off he must increase I must decrease John the Baptist now just a little statement here this nexus has be conscious of your loneliness you're nothing you're nothing how I would like to dwell on that for a few minutes but you're nothing this sounds sacrilege sacrilegious and it sounds crude says I don't think the pulpit is any place for any minister to crack jokes it's become a joke in carry on Hollywood glamour now that's what's the matter Hollywood through television has took the pulpit over our women is bowed to the goddess of fashion of Hollywood long ago and then the pulpit got into Hollywood through singers and so forth talented men and how its root man that the devil is you can't mix all of what it won't mix notice the great influence that people can give to others and what you do is an influence what we're doing with this dream is an influence and why not bring people truth for them to just meditate on I know you're gonna do research because you anybody and many people have come and they've heard you know it was his brother Brandon lady keep talking about who is this brother Bram he's a prophet of God that God said to turn our hearts back to the faith in the father's and what we're saying is he sent him to turn our hearts back to the Word of God to the truth of the word of God not that we worship him we worship Jesus we worship Jesus but he was a star in the hand of Jesus according to the book of Revelation just like Paul was a star amen and when the church got all the gospel all mixed up God had to send somebody to straighten it all out it was mixed up in John the Baptist day they got mixed up again today and if you don't believe it was mixed up why did the church crucify Jesus why did they crucify them if they weren't mixed up they man it's the same crucifixion going on again today the denominational Church system is crucifying Christ all over again God has a faithful forerunner a man with a message he has something the same and we just fellowship around that message when you see me reading those posts we're fellowshiping around the message and I ain't even said there's more that I'm gonna say next week but I want to at least get this part out amen yes John was there was never a prophet like him he was more than a prophet according to Jesus words there was no one like him until that time the reason he was anointed the reason he was mighty a miracle because he introduced Messiah the first time to introduce the Messiah never even work a miracle to get know but know the miracles got people's attention but he'd never work one but he still introduced Messiah god is good god is good let's pray dear God we thank you for your word Lord Christ's faithful four-runner so
