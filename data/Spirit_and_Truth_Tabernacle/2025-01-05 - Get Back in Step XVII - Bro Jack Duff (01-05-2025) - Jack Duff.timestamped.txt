[58:26] and God a journey that you have uh
[58:29] carried us on uh throughout the previous
[58:33] year and and you have
[58:35] ordained um and and not just I think the
[58:39] ordination comes even through the
[58:41] scripture because you you prophesied
[58:43] through Joel that there would be an
[58:46] overflow and God we have entered that we
[58:48] see spiritually uh that we could not
[58:51] finish the thought last year and it had
[58:53] to overflow into this year so with that
[58:56] that now we can lay claims on other
[58:59] areas of our life that will experience
[59:01] overflow thank you for the spiritual
[59:04] overflow thank you for the natural
[59:06] overflow thank you for the financial
[59:09] overflow thank you for uh touching our
[59:11] bodies God thank you for healing

[59:26] Ames
[59:27] overflow amen we have sowed in tears but
[59:30] now it's time for us to reap in Joy amen
[59:33] so father we claim in this as you have
[59:35] given it to us and and we receive it
[59:37] father with Thanksgiving Amen on the tip
[59:39] of our tongues and and Lord just
[59:41] believing that you will do
[59:44] everything hallelujah we're not limiting
[59:46] you to no one or two things we believe
[59:48] you're going to do everything so father
[59:50] we receive it father and just pray that
[59:52] you bless amen our time as we go into
[59:54] the word take control of every thought

[1:00:01] name we pray amen amen God bless you can
[1:00:04] be
[1:00:18] seated praise the Lord so um our journey
[1:00:22] continues on get back and step
[1:00:26] um and the
[1:00:29] inspiration of our restore sayith the
[1:00:34] Lord just a a few things amen before we
[1:00:38] go
[1:00:39] further
[1:00:41] um
[1:00:43] um as I
[1:00:45] mentioned last year uh the theme was get
[1:00:49] back in
[1:00:51] step and um with us carrying that theme
[1:00:55] over to this year uh Joel told us there
[1:00:59] in Joel
[1:01:01] 2:24
[1:01:03] um that there the floor shall be full of
[1:01:07] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:01:09] wine and oil uh so just by reading that
[1:01:13] scripture and that that was our theme we
[1:01:15] I I didn't know but God knew that even
[1:01:18] that portion had to actually be
[1:01:20] fulfilled with us carrying the theme
[1:01:23] over into this year which which to me
[1:01:26] is a clear example that this is our
[1:01:32] scripture and this scriptures being
[1:01:35] fulfilled in our time we are the people
[1:01:40] that are living this
[1:01:43] scripture we are the people and and that
[1:01:46] and that that overflow happen
[1:01:48] spiritually because you know as we
[1:01:49] mentioned on uh Tuesday night the oil
[1:01:52] and wine is something that is is is
[1:01:55] spiritual brother Brandon uh tells us
[1:01:58] that the the oil represented the Holy
[1:02:00] Spirit the wine represents the
[1:02:03] stimulation of Revelation and even you
[1:02:06] know on Tuesday night I was watching
[1:02:08] even even some of my young people saying
[1:02:11] amen they was receiving stimulation from
[1:02:14] Revelation amen and and and it's
[1:02:16] something when you see the young people
[1:02:17] get on fire in the church it start
[1:02:20] changing things for everybody
[1:02:22] else Hallelujah so so I pray that God
[1:02:25] would continue to overflow in the lives
[1:02:28] of the young people amen and and don't
[1:02:30] let the devil take y'all amen young
[1:02:33] people amen God reveal himself to you
[1:02:36] speak back to him as he speaks to you
[1:02:39] amen amen actually means so be it right
[1:02:42] so when when when when it's declared
[1:02:44] over me that this is the year of
[1:02:45] overflow I ain't going to sit there and
[1:02:47] just knot my head when I say Amen that
[1:02:51] means so be it to me I agree with that I
[1:02:56] accept that I want that Hallelujah right
[1:03:01] so so that's why I'm not afraid to say
[1:03:03] amen hallelujah right but but but this
[1:03:06] this uh brother brandham told us that
[1:03:08] the wine is stimulation of Revelation
[1:03:11] and then the oil represents the Holy
[1:03:13] Spirit and and and we had a little
[1:03:16] situation there at the house uh on
[1:03:18] yesterday me and my wife was just doing
[1:03:19] some some handy handy things there and
[1:03:23] uh we were trying to get this little uh
[1:03:26] uh uh holder off the off of our front
[1:03:29] door on the glass of the front door and
[1:03:31] we would just it was just stuck there
[1:03:33] just just couldn't get that thing off
[1:03:34] and one of them I got off but in getting
[1:03:36] it off I broke it where it can't be used
[1:03:39] anymore uh so you know she she said well
[1:03:41] let me let me let me go in and and just
[1:03:44] get something see if we can get this off
[1:03:46] and um and she went and got some oil and
[1:03:49] she just poured it over this little area
[1:03:52] and as the oil was seeping down it
[1:03:54] loosened this thing so that we can get
[1:03:56] it off you know of the window and she
[1:04:00] say you say see when the oil come in
[1:04:02] nothing can stick to
[1:04:08] it and she said what does the or
[1:04:10] represent I said all right now she
[1:04:12] preaching to
[1:04:13] me I said the or represent the spirit
[1:04:17] then when the spirit come in nothing can
[1:04:20] stick to it Lord and and and I felt that
[1:04:23] was very appropriate amen for this
[1:04:25] morning when the Holy Spirit comes into
[1:04:28] the life of his people then sin cannot
[1:04:32] stick to them nothing can stick to you
[1:04:35] when the Holy Spirit comes in if you
[1:04:38] still struggling in certain areas
[1:04:41] Hallelujah you you might have carried
[1:04:43] some things from last year into this
[1:04:45] year but when when the Overflow of wine
[1:04:49] and oil comes don't you worry cuz
[1:04:52] nothing will stick to it
[1:04:56] Hallelujah hey this is going to cinch
[1:04:58] you from the inside out Hall my God I'm
[1:05:02] I'm under expectation amen a mighty
[1:05:05] mighty expectation I wanted to you know
[1:05:08] one of the other things that was brought
[1:05:10] out uh brother Simba mention because we
[1:05:12] we were talking about some of the things
[1:05:14] that restored last year we had uh
[1:05:17] communion restored we had Sunday school
[1:05:21] restored right Health was restored right
[1:05:24] I mean Finance is restored there was a
[1:05:26] lot of things that happened last year
[1:05:28] and we're looking for them testimonies
[1:05:30] to carry on over into this year he says
[1:05:32] but he says we didn't even realize it
[1:05:34] but but just by us having a New Year's
[1:05:37] Eve service that actually was restored
[1:05:41] yes sir we hadn't had one of them in
[1:05:42] over three years so with us coming just
[1:05:45] for that night that was another proof
[1:05:48] that restoration had occurred in this
[1:05:51] church Hallelujah restoration was all
[1:05:53] around us
[1:05:56] sometimes we didn't even recognize what
[1:05:57] God was doing but but I thank God that
[1:05:59] God got spiritual people here catching
[1:06:01] all these things that the Lord is doing
[1:06:03] in our midst thank God for this this
[1:06:05] this this this thing amen thank God for
[1:06:08] what he's given us amen and and I wanted
[1:06:11] to just kind of circle back here at the
[1:06:13] beginning of the sermon um when we talk
[1:06:15] about get back in Step let's not forget
[1:06:18] where this comes from amen let's let's
[1:06:20] go back and just look at a couple things
[1:06:22] out of the message proving his word uh
[1:06:25] this is what we started off with last
[1:06:27] year this is where the inspiration came
[1:06:29] from and uh and it's just like I said
[1:06:32] it's carrying over into this year so
[1:06:33] let's just start the year with with
[1:06:35] where the the get back and step comes
[1:06:37] from here out of the message proving his
[1:06:39] word it says he proves his word in every
[1:06:44] age by the most unusual way but he
[1:06:50] always does it in the same way amen he
[1:06:54] says see what did he do in the days of
[1:06:56] Noah when he's fixing to deliver the
[1:06:59] remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he
[1:07:02] sent Noah a sign and and now notice when
[1:07:06] he comes to deliver the children of
[1:07:08] Israel what does he do his same way he
[1:07:13] sends his Prophet now this is this is
[1:07:17] what this is what the uh uh um this is
[1:07:19] what what what what what what we're told
[1:07:22] now uh when he sends his
[1:07:26] prophit there is another side of this
[1:07:30] equation if I can put it that way it's
[1:07:33] not it's not the fact whether he send
[1:07:35] his Prophet or not amen the the issue
[1:07:39] becomes whether you can receive
[1:07:43] it oh it's not about what God has done
[1:07:47] amen because cuz when when when when
[1:07:49] when when when when the Disciples of
[1:07:50] John the Baptist want to know are you he
[1:07:53] or should we look for another
[1:07:56] right they they I mean they was they
[1:07:57] they was asking the question to the Lord
[1:07:59] Jesus and and he say you know the the
[1:08:01] the tell John that the the blind receive
[1:08:03] their sight the the dumb talk you know
[1:08:06] the death hear and and all these
[1:08:08] Miracles that's tell tell them
[1:08:09] everything that that's been going on in
[1:08:11] the ministry my God tell them all the
[1:08:13] testimonies that have been happening and
[1:08:15] uh and and John being in uh in prison
[1:08:18] had his prophetic eye filmed over glory
[1:08:21] to God so just begin to share these
[1:08:23] testimonies the testimonies will bring
[1:08:25] encouragement to John Hallelujah and
[1:08:28] then then Jesus goes on to say now now
[1:08:30] you know that that that one that's
[1:08:31] supposed to be coming before me this is
[1:08:33] John if you can receive it all right
[1:08:37] Hallelujah if the Lord Jesus himself was
[1:08:40] on Earth today and he was to come and
[1:08:42] tell you yeah the ministry of William
[1:08:45] brandom is the one that I sent but it's
[1:08:49] not whether I sin or not I did my part
[1:08:52] the question is will you receive what I
[1:08:55] s that's it brother that's where the
[1:08:58] issue is can people receive it all right
[1:09:02] here we go here we go here we go glory
[1:09:03] to God Amen he says um uh uh uh he's
[1:09:08] fixing to deliver the remnant he sent
[1:09:09] them no other prophet he sent Noah sign
[1:09:13] and now notice when he comes to deliver
[1:09:15] the children of Israel what does he do
[1:09:16] his same way he sends his Prophet His
[1:09:19] prophets got the word the signs and
[1:09:21] wonders of the promised word uh uh of
[1:09:23] the word promise backs uh back it up
[1:09:26] that's that's it's exactly the truth
[1:09:28] Israel made a March to the promised land
[1:09:31] because they believed it Israel made
[1:09:34] their March to the promised land because
[1:09:38] they believed it yes sir they believe
[1:09:41] what they belied God had sent them a
[1:09:43] prophet they were willing to obey what
[1:09:45] the prophet was saying to them
[1:09:47] everything Moses gave them they followed
[1:09:49] the instructions of it they stayed in
[1:09:52] step with what Moses was saying
[1:09:56] Hallelujah if you got out of Step
[1:09:58] especially a father that had a boy on
[1:10:00] the night that the U the the death angel
[1:10:03] was passing through the that firstborn
[1:10:05] song son if that boy would if that blood
[1:10:07] was not applied that boy's life would be
[1:10:10] impacted they had to stay in step with
[1:10:13] what the prophet was saying that's right
[1:10:16] amen glory to God and he says this he
[1:10:18] says um Israel made her March to the
[1:10:21] promis land because they believed him
[1:10:23] look at this it goes on and says and in
[1:10:25] the Wilderness
[1:10:26] Journey it came to pass that they
[1:10:30] disbelieve this Prophet now now now I
[1:10:33] need you to understand where did this
[1:10:35] happen this not happen while the prophet
[1:10:37] was on the
[1:10:39] earth oh Lord have mercy there was no no
[1:10:43] problems believing it while the prophet
[1:10:45] was on the earth it was only after the
[1:10:46] prophet went off to
[1:10:48] sing when the prophet went off the scene
[1:10:50] this is where problems start coming in
[1:10:53] this is where people got out of
[1:10:56] step Hallelujah if I can just put it
[1:10:58] very plain this is where people got out
[1:11:00] of Step but however there is a promise
[1:11:04] that over the people that got out of
[1:11:07] Step that somehow they would get
[1:11:09] themselves back in step and what is the
[1:11:12] promise that causes these people to get
[1:11:14] back in step we read it I will
[1:11:19] restore saith the Lord that is the
[1:11:23] promise that is looming over those
[1:11:25] people now somebody got to get out the
[1:11:27] step in order for us to get
[1:11:32] back somebody got to get out of step in
[1:11:34] order for us to get back in Step but God
[1:11:37] know exactly what he doing don't don't
[1:11:39] you be alarmed by nothing that's
[1:11:41] happening you just keep showing love to
[1:11:45] everybody yes sir look at this in the
[1:11:47] wilderness Journey it came the past that

[1:13:52] on Tuesday night but those trying circum
[1:13:54] circum that did not stop people from
[1:13:57] pressing their way into the presence of
[1:14:00] God prise Lord my my testimony that I
[1:14:02] was still holding on oh my God they
[1:14:06] asked that question you yet holding

[1:14:13] holding
[1:14:14] on well if you're yet holding on keep on
[1:14:17] keeping
[1:14:21] [Applause]
[1:14:22] on oh my here I'm skipping in this in
[1:14:26] this sermon down
[1:14:28] to uh the the next quote in this uh I
[1:14:31] forget which paragraph number it is but
[1:14:34] I I want to skip down because brother
[1:14:36] brandom talked about how he saw the BR
[1:14:39] getting out of step and said you know
[1:14:40] what I'm speaking of it was a vision
[1:14:41] that God gave him of the uh he had he
[1:14:45] saw the alpha bride then he saw the
[1:14:47] church and then he saw the Omega bride
[1:14:50] and it says when he saw the alpha bride
[1:14:52] they were marching to the beat of the
[1:14:53] Gospel but then then when he saw the
[1:14:55] church is it it it discouraged him so
[1:14:58] much he says Lord how with all the
[1:15:00] preaching that we did how could this be
[1:15:02] the only thing that we could produce I
[1:15:03] mean look at the way this church is
[1:15:05] acting look at the dancing and and and
[1:15:07] everything that's going on and I'm
[1:15:08] talking about vulgar Dancing Yeah amen
[1:15:11] there there is a holy dance that we can
[1:15:13] do amen but he's talk the vulgar dancing
[1:15:16] that's going on in church the music that
[1:15:17] they were listening to in the church he
[1:15:19] he says Lord how could all this
[1:15:20] preaching seven times around the world
[1:15:22] and that's all we could produce and then
[1:15:24] the Lord told him said no just just just
[1:15:26] just watch you know the bride is coming
[1:15:28] back in preview again and here comes the
[1:15:30] Omega bride walking and as he as they're
[1:15:33] walking they're walking past the prophet
[1:15:35] amen he was sitting there in the in in
[1:15:37] the grand stand and as they're walking
[1:15:38] past the prophet he uh he saw a couple
[1:15:41] of them in the back Hallelujah and we
[1:15:44] kind of in the back because this is the
[1:15:46] end of the age we're the end of the end
[1:15:49] so the ones that were in the back begin
[1:15:51] to get out of Step Hallelujah amen and
[1:15:55] as they were getting out of Step the
[1:15:58] prophet almost screamed out and said get
[1:16:01] back and step but before he could scream
[1:16:03] out they got back in step on their own
[1:16:06] and the reason they could get back in
[1:16:08] step is because there's a promise over
[1:16:10] them that I will restore sayth the Lord
[1:16:12] God going to restore your
[1:16:19] step so here in the prayer in this same
[1:16:22] sermon proving his word in his prayer he
[1:16:24] he says we think of this Solomon and
[1:16:27] that great Millennium of the Jews that
[1:16:31] when no Nations dared to touch them and
[1:16:34] that great gift of God was in the
[1:16:36] prophet till he made known to the queen
[1:16:38] all of her secrets of her heart nothing
[1:16:40] was with hell the great age showing and
[1:16:43] typing that there was a great age coming
[1:16:46] and now father that was you not Solomon
[1:16:50] that was you in Jesus where he said God
[1:16:52] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:16:53] himself he was beginning of the creation
[1:16:56] his body was the redeemed creation and
[1:16:59] now Through the Ages the church lost its
[1:17:01] first love uh lost his first love and
[1:17:04] now in the last days you promise to call
[1:17:06] a little
[1:17:08] minority amen the little flock at the
[1:17:11] last days father our hearts are jumping
[1:17:14] and my heart's pounding when I think of
[1:17:16] that and know uh and know that your
[1:17:19] words are true none of them can fail let
[1:17:23] these people today understand that and
[1:17:26] let the sinner seek you at this hour
[1:17:28] before the gates close and there will be
[1:17:30] no more time let the Bride As she starts
[1:17:35] getting out of Step from this and that
[1:17:39] may she come back into step as the
[1:17:42] vision showed a few weeks ago now I I
[1:17:44] love that prayer and and I want to just
[1:17:46] mention you know he said as the bride
[1:17:48] gets out of Step from
[1:17:50] this and that amen now now now uh we've
[1:17:55] had we've had a lot happen we've had
[1:17:57] some that got out of Step because you
[1:18:00] know they they thought they saw
[1:18:01] something in the word that uh they was
[1:18:03] completely misunderstanding right and
[1:18:06] and anytime you know as a people talk
[1:18:08] about you know we uh the the scripture
[1:18:10] that a lot of people stood on or trying
[1:18:12] to stand on is that if if the Lord
[1:18:14] reveals something to a prophet and the
[1:18:17] prophet speaks it and it doesn't come to
[1:18:19] pass then the Bible say don't hear that
[1:18:21] Prophet so so so many people heard that
[1:18:24] brother brandom talked about you know uh
[1:18:28] uh uh a bear that he was supposed to get
[1:18:31] and that he didn't get the bear he said
[1:18:33] thus said the Lord he was going to get
[1:18:34] the bear but he didn't get the bear but
[1:18:36] he also explained why he didn't get the
[1:18:38] bear because he was
[1:18:40] disobedient now it was thus sayth the
[1:18:42] Lord but he was disobedient that's why
[1:18:44] he didn't get to Bear but in their in
[1:18:46] their mind they think well he spoke thus
[1:18:48] sayi the Lord it didn't come to pass so
[1:18:51] you know he's not a prophet and that's
[1:18:53] all they got they not looking at the
[1:18:57] thousands of other things that he spoke
[1:18:59] in the name of the Lord that came to
[1:19:02] pass they looking at one thing and say
[1:19:04] he spoke it it didn't come to pass right
[1:19:06] and and and and here you know I've
[1:19:08] always challenged people with that I
[1:19:09] said because Moses was the one that's
[1:19:12] supposed to take the people into the
[1:19:13] promised land did he do it he didn't do
[1:19:17] it he didn't do it and the reason he do
[1:19:19] it he didn't do it because of something
[1:19:21] that he did he exalted himself above the
[1:19:24] word of God so God took him off you know
[1:19:26] God let him come off the SE say so but
[1:19:28] that does not not that that does not
[1:19:31] take away the fact that Moses was the
[1:19:36] deliverer so whether brother brand got
[1:19:38] to bear or not don't take away the fact
[1:19:40] that God used him as his
[1:19:42] Prophet Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
[1:19:46] Amen and I just I have to keep saying
[1:19:48] this over and over again uh when you're
[1:19:50] trying to search this message to find
[1:19:51] whether it's true or not don't search
[1:19:53] Google
[1:19:55] that's for lazy Christian Christians
[1:19:57] they go to Google to try to search
[1:19:59] things out if you want to search whether
[1:20:00] this message is right or not search the
[1:20:03] scripture because in them you think you
[1:20:06] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:20:09] testify of the ministry of Willam Mary
[1:20:11] and Brandon I've already given you two
[1:20:14] scriptures that said that Malachi 4
[1:20:16] Revelation 3 I gave you those I got
[1:20:19] another one for you today Revelation 10
[1:20:21] is where we're going to go today if we
[1:20:23] can get there but we got scripture after
[1:20:25] scripture proving that this ministry
[1:20:27] will be here in this time yes sir Joel
[1:20:30] too also prophesied that this ministry
[1:20:32] would be here in this time so so so here
[1:20:35] uh we see people getting out of Step but
[1:20:37] now I'm going tell you even in the
[1:20:39] message I gave you one way to get out of
[1:20:42] Step you know by leaving the message but
[1:20:44] people have gotten out of
[1:20:46] Step oh Lord have
[1:20:49] mercy in the message and and and let me
[1:20:52] tell you something let me let me try to
[1:20:53] make this very clear to the church you
[1:20:56] know brother brandom said with
[1:20:59] Luther in his day the miracle was not
[1:21:02] just you know all the signs and wonder
[1:21:04] Wonders that was following his ministry
[1:21:06] the miracle was that he was able to hold
[1:21:08] his head
[1:21:10] above the
[1:21:13] fanaticism oh my God my God my God my
[1:21:17] God the miracle today is not necessarily
[1:21:20] what we see people walking away they
[1:21:22] just had an evil spirit attack them and
[1:21:24] they underneath an evil spirit but when
[1:21:25] you got people in the message that think
[1:21:28] they right Lord hallelujah amen but
[1:21:32] don't realize that they gotten off the
[1:21:33] word of God the the the the Miracles
[1:21:37] that we have to be able to hold our
[1:21:38] hands above the
[1:21:41] fanaticism yes
[1:21:43] sir am
[1:21:47] amen oh my God let me I I I got a few
[1:21:50] things that I I I want to share here and
[1:21:53] and one of them is out of just sermon
[1:21:54] turn on the
[1:21:56] light let me just set this up real good
[1:22:01] so you know the Lord just put in my
[1:22:04] spirit that uh and this was way back
[1:22:07] when we were in other Church let's have
[1:22:09] one one uh Friday night out of the month
[1:22:11] where we will we'll listen to a tape
[1:22:13] from the prophet and we used to come
[1:22:15] together at that building on that Friday
[1:22:17] night that first Friday Night of the
[1:22:19] month and we would listen together you
[1:22:21] know what the prophet I mean what the
[1:22:22] prophet was preaching Hallelujah and and
[1:22:25] I go through every year and I just set
[1:22:27] up for the next year what tape we're
[1:22:29] going to listen to I just ask the Lord
[1:22:30] just to lead us as to what tape and I
[1:22:32] and there's a lot of things that I think
[1:22:33] about uh when I when I'm when I'm when
[1:22:36] I'm getting taped now I know it's a
[1:22:37] Friday night I know you all have had a
[1:22:40] rough week Hallelujah and it's Friday

[1:22:52] long am I talking
[1:22:55] somebody I try not to get a tape that's
[1:22:58] 6 hours long because I know you won't

[1:23:09] those tapes when you got time to kind of
[1:23:11] listen and then stop it at a certain
[1:23:13] point then go back and pick up and and
[1:23:15] just keep listening and and now some say
[1:23:17] well you got to act like you was in the

[1:23:20] that service and it was a totally
[1:23:22] different time period yeah amen you
[1:23:25] can't really it's hard to do that it's
[1:23:27] hard for the people to keep their
[1:23:28] attention that long now let me tell you
[1:23:29] something I'mma give you on the other
[1:23:31] side this now y'all just stay with me if

[1:23:54] time let sit down and and watch all that
[1:23:56] or get on YouTube and and and and follow
[1:23:59] reals for 3 or 4 hours then you can
[1:24:01] listen to a tape for three or 4 hours
[1:24:03] right amen but we try to be sensitive
[1:24:07] and we try to find the tapes that we
[1:24:08] know that the people will be able to get
[1:24:10] something uh and feed their spirits and
[1:24:12] just kind of move on Hallelujah but
[1:24:14] after after we you know we come here we
[1:24:17] didn't we didn't get the Friday night
[1:24:18] service so we've been doing it at home I
[1:24:20] say Friday nights families get together
[1:24:22] and listen to the tape amen
[1:24:25] it'll be good for
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:29] families to get
[1:24:32] together once a month and listen to the
[1:24:36] tape we give you what tape is going to

[1:24:45] saying everybody get this get it on your
[1:24:47] schedule so so as I was flying back from

[1:25:05] schedule so it'll be ready uh for for
[1:25:08] the for the church to announce on

[1:25:11] no idea we we we we took this sermon
[1:25:13] turned on the
[1:25:15] light and uh and I had no idea that in
[1:25:19] that sermon brother Brandon was going to
[1:25:21] be talking about our restore sayith the
[1:25:23] Lord
[1:25:25] that was another
[1:25:27] confirmation to the theme that we had in
[1:25:30] the Overflow right there in the tape yes
[1:25:33] sir amen and turn on the light when we
[1:25:36] listened to it on Friday it was right
[1:25:38] there in the tape yes sir see God knows
[1:25:41] how to speak God knows how to how how to
[1:25:42] confirm his word now I want to say this
[1:25:45] amen I believe in listening to the
[1:25:49] tapes see I I I done said a lot to get
[1:25:51] to a little just this little spot cuz I
[1:25:54] said people within the message then got
[1:25:57] out of Step remember I said that and now
[1:26:00] I'm bringing it all the way back around
[1:26:02] I
[1:26:03] believe in listening to the tapes
[1:26:06] whether we do it in the church or at
[1:26:08] home I believe in listening to the tapes
[1:26:11] what I don't believe I'm going tell you
[1:26:14] what I don't believe I don't believe in
[1:26:17] listen to the tapes only right am
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:24] am if you ain't heard that one yet it'll
[1:26:27] be coming your way when you hear
[1:26:29] somebody come tell you listen to the
[1:26:31] tape only what that mean is remove the
[1:26:34] preachers from the pull
[1:26:36] pit I'mma just say it like this brother
[1:26:38] brandom can't be your
[1:26:43] pastor I don't I think I I'm sorry that
[1:26:47] people you know I don't believe you play
[1:26:48] no tape for somebody's wedding I don't
[1:26:51] you believe you play no tape for a
[1:26:53] funeral how how would it look we went in
[1:26:55] there buing brother Wesco and we just
[1:26:58] play a
[1:27:00] tape no that would have been a wasted
[1:27:03] opportunity to get to some
[1:27:05] Souls Hallelujah we know what brother
[1:27:09] Wesco believes amen but it's up to a
[1:27:12] minister to stand behind the pull pit
[1:27:14] and preach the gospel because God
[1:27:17] himself said he gave some Apostles some
[1:27:23] Prophets
[1:27:24] some pastors some evangelists some
[1:27:28] teachers for the work of the ministry
[1:27:30] for the edification of the body Amen to
[1:27:33] bring us all to a place of perfection
[1:27:35] that's what God himself did in the
[1:27:38] church anybody trying to take the
[1:27:41] fivefold ministry out of church need to
[1:27:44] get back in
[1:27:47] step that's the
[1:27:49] trth
[1:27:51] trth all right

[1:28:09] more places and I'm a I'm I'm a I'm a
[1:28:12] I'mma let y'all alone but I tell you the
[1:28:14] truth I thank God for the word I thank
[1:28:18] God for the word I thank God for the
[1:28:20] word I have to say these things I I know
[1:28:24] know how different Spirits have been

[1:28:56] AE there was only seven and brother
[1:29:00] Brandon was the
[1:29:01] seventh there is no eighth
[1:29:05] Prophet if if if you find a as far as
[1:29:08] another person operating under prophetic
[1:29:10] Ministry I can tell you where to put
[1:29:11] them according to scripture because I
[1:29:14] believe it if as long as it's in
[1:29:16] scripture I believe
[1:29:17] it Ephesians 4 that's where they fit
[1:29:22] hallelujah amen but there's nobody else
[1:29:24] that we listen to outside of brother
[1:29:26] brandom I'm not quoting no other brother

[1:30:09] out of Step even in this message amen
[1:30:13] amen praise the
[1:30:15] Lord so many folk done
[1:30:19] done done quit their jobs left their
[1:30:22] houses and moved to
[1:30:24] Jeffersonville and the prophet even told
[1:30:27] us anybody any anybody ever read that
[1:30:30] quote out of questions and answers
[1:30:32] should we come to Arizona or should we
[1:30:34] do this or should we and the prophet say
[1:30:36] no don't do
[1:30:38] that anybody read that quote no don't do
[1:30:41] that God sending me there by a vision
[1:30:43] but don't you do that amen he didn't
[1:30:46] want this thing to look like no
[1:30:51] cult he didn't the prophet himself
[1:30:54] didn't even want that he knew what type
[1:30:56] of spirit that was said no no you you
[1:30:59] you you'll meet God right where you are
[1:31:00] just stay with the
[1:31:03] word and now everybody want to I feel
[1:31:06] led to move to J no what what you moving
[1:31:08] there for and get there and don't even
[1:31:11] go to
[1:31:13] church hello church amen I'm here this
[1:31:17] morning I'm
[1:31:18] here yeah I'm I'm just I I I believe in
[1:31:22] listening to the tapes but but when it
[1:31:24] moves over to listen to the tapes only
[1:31:27] that's where the problem comes in
[1:31:30] exactly right e Eve Eve got off by one
[1:31:36] word hello
[1:31:38] church and and see don't get to the pars
[1:31:41] they listen to tapes only so we're not
[1:31:42] going to listen to tapes no that's the
[1:31:45] wrong spirit I believe that we should
[1:31:47] listen to the tapes that's where we get
[1:31:50] our nutrients from that's where I get my
[1:31:53] inspir
[1:31:54] from hello somebody but listen to the
[1:31:57] tapes only so so so here's the issue you
[1:31:59] got to be able to you got to the miracle
[1:32:02] is holding your
[1:32:09] head because people going to have all
[1:32:11] kind of things to say when I finish this
[1:32:13] sermon people going to be waiting for
[1:32:14] you at home but you got to take them
[1:32:17] back to the scripture what what
[1:32:18] scripture Are you standing on because
[1:32:19] brother Jack gave us Ephesians right it
[1:32:22] gave us revelation 10:7 what scripture
[1:32:24] you standing on I'm not talking about
[1:32:26] your
[1:32:27] feelings if you ain't got no scripture
[1:32:29] what you need to do is get back and
[1:32:32] step y'all going to make me
[1:32:36] shout I I when you standing on the
[1:32:40] word you stand on a immovable
[1:32:45] Foundation
[1:32:47] amen Jesus glory to God all right I'm
[1:32:52] I'm I'm let me let me read this brother
[1:32:54] brother Brandon and birth pain said then
[1:32:56] directly I heard that real sweet music
[1:32:59] come again it says and here come that
[1:33:03] same little bride coming by again he
[1:33:05] said this is this is what comes out
[1:33:09] though and when she walked by she was
[1:33:12] exactly like the one was in the first
[1:33:15] place so Omega was just like
[1:33:17] Alpha right walking to the step of the
[1:33:21] music what's the music the music
[1:33:25] of God's word look here look here look
[1:33:28] here look here I have said it before and
[1:33:30] I'm gonna say it again the
[1:33:33] reason I
[1:33:36] believe the message of the hour is
[1:33:39] because I can read it in the scripture
[1:33:44] Hallelujah yes sir it's not because of
[1:33:47] the signs wonders and miracles it's
[1:33:50] because I read it in Scripture that God
[1:33:53] God was going to send a prophet that's
[1:33:56] why I believe the message if you're not
[1:33:59] believing the message because it was
[1:34:00] based on scripture then you you'll fall
[1:34:03] to
[1:34:04] anything exactly right because even in
[1:34:07] the message people will bring you
[1:34:09] unscriptural
[1:34:11] things and you'll just fall for
[1:34:17] it God have mercy
[1:34:19] Jesus I I've had to ask people very
[1:34:23] specifically
[1:34:24] show me in the
[1:34:28] Bible where brother so and so's Ministry
[1:34:31] is
[1:34:32] identified now I'm I'm doing my best not
[1:34:35] to use names but I hope you can read
[1:34:38] between the
[1:34:40] lines amen am brother Soo yes sir amen
[1:34:45] amen that's
[1:34:47] right show me in the Bible where this
[1:34:51] ministry is Promised yeah
[1:34:54] right and then I I hear well you know
[1:34:57] brother brandham said brother thou art a
[1:35:02] prophet and I believe
[1:35:04] that I honestly believe that a prophet
[1:35:07] according to what right right I prophit
[1:35:11] according to Ephesians 4 that's it hello
[1:35:17] and I told you if and we got other
[1:35:19] people that done left the church because
[1:35:22] we wouldn't receive them as a prophet as
[1:35:25] long as you put your prophetic Ministry
[1:35:28] in Ephesians 4 it will always be receive
[1:35:32] yes sir but if your prophetic Ministry
[1:35:34] is trying to take you higher than
[1:35:37] Revelation 10:7
[1:35:40] sir it won't be
[1:35:42] received hello church and everybody
[1:35:45] ought to feel that way your prophetic
[1:35:48] Ministry does not put you over Malachi 4
[1:35:51] your prophetic Ministry does not put you
[1:35:53] over re Revelation 10 Revelation 3:14
[1:35:56] your prophetic Ministry does not take
[1:35:57] you that high right your prophetic
[1:36:00] Ministry has a flow underneath
[1:36:02] this oh my don't y'all y'all want more
[1:36:06] scripture in the days of uh uh Paul uh
[1:36:10] Paul was a prophet for that age but
[1:36:12] there was another Prophet by the name of
[1:36:15] agabus his ministry was underneath Paul
[1:36:18] right hello so they receive AG's
[1:36:22] prophecy yes sir he even prophesied and
[1:36:25] told Paul you know this going to happen
[1:36:26] well look don't don't try to get me all
[1:36:28] afraid of that I'm I'm good I'm good I I
[1:36:31] mean I no he says he I think Paul told
[1:36:33] him none of these
[1:36:36] things
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:39] amen none of these things move
[1:36:43] me amen can I can I can I just borrow
[1:36:47] the words of Paul this
[1:36:49] morning huh I mean all this stuff I hear
[1:36:53] go going on around the message none of
[1:36:55] these things move

[1:37:02] trying to get you back in Step stay with
[1:37:06] the word the word is above everything

[1:37:14] final amen amen amen y'all y'all stay
[1:37:18] with me I'm coming home I'm trying to
[1:37:20] get there here we go I'm back in this
[1:37:23] quote birth
[1:37:24] pains when she walked by she was exactly
[1:37:28] like the one was in the first place
[1:37:30] walking to the step of the music of
[1:37:32] God's
[1:37:33] word marching on by and when I saw it I
[1:37:38] stood there with both hands up crying
[1:37:40] like that when I come to and and you
[1:37:43] know let me just let me inject this uh I
[1:37:47] thank God uh one of the sisters had had
[1:37:50] a question for me this week and and I
[1:37:51] was so I'm grateful you know for the
[1:37:53] question she was listening to a tape and
[1:37:55] I I like that hearing Saints at home
[1:37:58] listen to a tape and on the tape she
[1:38:00] heard right before brother Brandon began
[1:38:02] to preach a sister broke off in
[1:38:04] tongues and then uh a brother
[1:38:07] interpreted what she said and uh and
[1:38:10] brother brandom just prayed and thanked
[1:38:11] God for for what happened but I I told
[1:38:13] you all that that's really not the Bible
[1:38:16] order to do things the tongues come
[1:38:18] after the word has gone forth that's the
[1:38:21] Bible order so when some if some do it
[1:38:24] out of order just don't blast them and
[1:38:26] and and just just be patient with them
[1:38:28] right but but but I but I I I had taught
[1:38:31] that to the church so she remembered
[1:38:32] what I Tau but she saw this and brother
[1:38:34] brandom just kind of said it and so we
[1:38:35] start looking at it looking at it and
[1:38:37] and then um uh not realizing uh when she
[1:38:40] gave me the tape and I went back
[1:38:42] listened to it and then I said oh my the
[1:38:44] quote that I gave you
[1:38:46] all was in the same series of sermons
[1:38:50] but just two days
[1:38:52] later and and I would not doubt it was
[1:38:54] the same sister that that prophesied
[1:38:57] through tongues right before brother
[1:38:59] Brandon preached this was a um th this
[1:39:03] looked like it was a uh uh something
[1:39:07] common for her to do I'mma go right
[1:39:09] before the sermon I'mma let my tongues
[1:39:11] out brother brandham didn't say anything
[1:39:13] the first time he just let it go but
[1:39:15] then a few days later it happened again
[1:39:18] in the church he say sister the reason
[1:39:21] that um no interpret
[1:39:23] came is because it's just a little out
[1:39:26] of
[1:39:27] order it's a little out of order he said
[1:39:30] he said but I could feel the spirit too
[1:39:32] say and I can tell you if he would come
[1:39:34] back again at the at the after the
[1:39:36] services after the message has been
[1:39:38] preached I he he didn't use the word
[1:39:41] guarantee but he say I I know that God
[1:39:43] will come and vindicate and he'll he'll
[1:39:45] give a interpretation with those tongues
[1:39:47] now we don't know what happened at the
[1:39:49] end of that service cuz the tape didn't
[1:39:50] show us but we got the teaching
[1:39:54] and now that we got the teaching we can
[1:39:55] establish a church on the teaching
[1:39:58] Hallelujah and I saw it here in our
[1:40:01] church and then when I went to the
[1:40:03] Philippines I saw it there everything
[1:40:05] that I was teaching the church I saw
[1:40:07] manifested in the Philippines now you
[1:40:10] ain't going to tell me that God is a god
[1:40:11] of the
[1:40:13] Philippines only God is a god of West
[1:40:16] Palm Beach as well and if we've been
[1:40:18] teaching that word we're going to see it
[1:40:20] manifested get ready for the Overflow
[1:40:27] amen all right I'm I'm let me let me let
[1:40:30] me make my turn I got to got to turn he
[1:40:32] says walking the step of of the music of
[1:40:34] God's word marching on by and when I saw
[1:40:36] it I stood there with both hands up
[1:40:38] crying like that when I come to I was
[1:40:40] standing on my porch and there looking
[1:40:42] right across the field what she's to be
[1:40:44] the same bride the same kind built out
[1:40:46] of the same kind of material that she
[1:40:48] was in the first place now read Malachi
[1:40:50] 4 and see if we're not supposed to have
[1:40:52] a message
[1:40:53] in the last days that'll turn the hearts
[1:40:55] of the children back to the fathers back
[1:40:57] to the original Pentecostal message word
[1:41:00] by word Brothers we are here now this
[1:41:04] church is supposed to get a sign and its
[1:41:07] last sign we find out here in scripture
[1:41:09] see now see the great birth pains has
[1:41:11] been in this latery and age uh the
[1:41:14] church is being borned again okay now
[1:41:18] let me uh slip over here to uh turn on
[1:41:21] the light because this is where uh the
[1:41:25] Lord had us to for the very first tape
[1:41:27] to play at our in our homes Amen on
[1:41:30] Friday night was turn on the light amen
[1:41:33] for this year and here the prophet is
[1:41:35] speaking uh you you go back and listen
[1:41:37] to it if you haven't listened to it I
[1:41:38] encourage you go listen to it amen but
[1:41:41] here the prophet was talking about uh uh
[1:41:44] this restoration now I didn't I'm just
[1:41:46] picking up one of the other quotes that
[1:41:48] was that was given here uh and let's
[1:41:50] just read it and see some of the things
[1:41:52] that the prophet said and let's move on
[1:41:54] from there glory to God glory to God I
[1:41:56] I'm going tell you something I feel real
[1:41:58] good right now I feel real good right
[1:42:02] now I feel I feel I feel I feel I feel
[1:42:06] great like my Tony the Tiger
[1:42:11] great glory to
[1:42:14] God watch this now look at turn on the
[1:42:17] light look at this let me tell
[1:42:19] you don't refuse the light of the Gospel
[1:42:25] of Jesus
[1:42:26] Christ which brings the warm War the
[1:42:30] warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you
[1:42:32] makes you a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:42:35] don't try to walk in some glare of
[1:42:37] another age now that glare might have
[1:42:40] been all right in the other age it might
[1:42:43] been all right for them Hallelujah the
[1:42:46] Pentecost could walk in that light of
[1:42:48] another age the Methodist walked in the
[1:42:50] light of another age the Lutheran walked
[1:42:51] in the light of another age but this is
[1:42:53] a different age right it says it proves
[1:42:56] so in the day of our Lord Jesus he was
[1:42:59] the scriptural light of that day he was
[1:43:04] the light he wasn't the light until he
[1:43:07] come on Earth to vindicate the promised
[1:43:10] word you know he said there John was a
[1:43:13] bright and Shining Light and you love to
[1:43:15] walk in his light for a season talking
[1:43:18] about John the Baptist it says certainly
[1:43:20] because John had been prophesied by
[1:43:22] Isaiah
[1:43:24] 712 years before his birth that a voice
[1:43:27] of one would be crying in the wilderness
[1:43:30] then and then also Malachi the last of
[1:43:33] the prophets 400 years before his coming
[1:43:36] in the third chapter of Malachi Mal he
[1:43:37] said behold I send my messenger before
[1:43:40] my face to prepare the way so these are
[1:43:42] scriptures that were written about John
[1:43:43] the
[1:43:44] Baptist and and and so when it come to
[1:43:47] ask Jesus he says you know uh are you he
[1:43:49] should we look for another like he's
[1:43:50] like I I I I get what John going through
[1:43:53] I understand uh you know his what what
[1:43:56] he's feeling because he's in prison and
[1:43:58] he's the prophet and he's in prison and
[1:44:00] and so on and so forth he says but tell
[1:44:01] John all these great things that's
[1:44:02] happening and it says now about John
[1:44:05] about John if y'all can receive it this
[1:44:07] is what was spoken of in Malachi 3
[1:44:11] Hallelujah but the question was can you
[1:44:13] receive it and the same way it was
[1:44:14] spoken of John it's spoken of brother
[1:44:16] Brandon the question is can you receive
[1:44:19] it I I think I got a group of people
[1:44:21] that are living here in this
[1:44:23] area I mean multiple counties are
[1:44:26] covered multiple counties are covered
[1:44:29] okobi county is
[1:44:32] covered um uh uh Broward county is
[1:44:37] covered Palm Beach county is covered
[1:44:40] what county bravar county is
[1:44:45] covered huh Henry County is covered
[1:44:50] that's five of them that on our named I
[1:44:52] believe so far
[1:44:54] five counties in this little church got
[1:44:58] people that can receive
[1:45:00] it now the other people in the county be
[1:45:03] judged by you all's ability to receive
[1:45:08] it those that reject it will be judged
[1:45:11] by those that
[1:45:15] received I want to say that again those
[1:45:18] that have rejected will be judged by
[1:45:20] those that have received
[1:45:25] I tell you what if it wasn't right if it
[1:45:29] wasn't right like like sister Keesha
[1:45:31] told us I'mma be
[1:45:33] judged by my
[1:45:37] cult you say I'm in a cult right I'm
[1:45:40] going be judged by my cult you know what
[1:45:42] else you going to be
[1:45:44] judged by my
[1:45:50] cult my cult belief you going to be Jud
[1:45:53] by it all right watch it now I'm I'm
[1:45:55] moving on Amen uh here was John on the
[1:45:59] earth making that written word
[1:46:03] live he was the voice of one crying in
[1:46:06] the wilderness and all also was
[1:46:09] preparing the way before the Messiah and
[1:46:11] Jesus said you love to walk in his light
[1:46:15] and people still love to walk in John's
[1:46:17] liks they refuse to accept brother
[1:46:20] brandom's light but they want to apply
[1:46:22] certain script to John because they love
[1:46:24] to walk in John's light that was light
[1:46:26] for a different day yes sir amen you
[1:46:29] going to have to find the light for this
[1:46:32] day come on
[1:46:34] church he said he say he says also was
[1:46:37] preparing the way before the Messiah and
[1:46:38] Jesus said you love to walk in his light
[1:46:40] because he was the light he was that
[1:46:42] light bright and Shining Light and John
[1:46:45] said now I must
[1:46:47] decrease my light must go out because
[1:46:50] why I have served my time that's
[1:46:52] prophesied of me hear ye him he is the
[1:46:55] one follow him it living in that day it
[1:46:58] prove this let me keep moving he says um
[1:47:02] now the Jews thought that they were
[1:47:05] worshiping in the True Light he says
[1:47:08] they thought they were worshiping the
[1:47:10] this same God that they they were
[1:47:12] turning down the very one that they
[1:47:14] thought they was they were worshiping
[1:47:16] they were
[1:47:18] crucifying my God he said they were
[1:47:21] making fun of the very God and making
[1:47:23] him a laughing stock of the people the
[1:47:25] very God that they thought they were
[1:47:28] worshiping say may I say this with
[1:47:30] reverence in respect but to bring light
[1:47:33] because as our brother said a while ago
[1:47:34] we're living later than you think we are
[1:47:37] one of these days something is going to
[1:47:39] happen it's going to be too late says
[1:47:42] the people will take on the mark of the
[1:47:45] beast not even knowing what they're
[1:47:47] doing now let me let me just work with
[1:47:50] that the people will take on the mar
[1:47:52] mark of the beast not even knowing what
[1:47:56] they're doing how does that
[1:47:58] happen how does that happen how how how
[1:48:00] do I end up taking on the mark of the
[1:48:02] beast and not even knowing that I did
[1:48:04] it let me help you the way that you take
[1:48:07] on the mark of the beast is by rejecting
[1:48:10] the light for your
[1:48:12] day when you reject the light for your
[1:48:14] day you accept the mark of the
[1:48:17] beast and you don't even realize it and
[1:48:20] you're going through the motions in
[1:48:22] church uhhuh and you just I mean you up
[1:48:24] there on the praise team and you got all
[1:48:26] these things going on and and it look
[1:48:28] like you just doing all kind of things
[1:48:30] under the mark of the
[1:48:36] beasto that's that that's powerful and
[1:48:39] people invite you sometime to come to
[1:48:41] their church and y'all you know we do it
[1:48:43] I see some of Y y'all text me I'm going
[1:48:45] over here to so and so Church you know
[1:48:46] you invite them they never come with you
[1:48:49] never but you go to them and I it's okay
[1:48:52] go be a light amen go be a light right
[1:48:55] he said but but but but the thing of it
[1:48:56] is they don't realize you come in there
[1:48:59] and you leave and every time you come
[1:49:02] and you leave you Le them because you
[1:49:03] got something a little greater light
[1:49:05] than what they got and you become
[1:49:07] judgment to them when you
[1:49:11] go oh y'all y'all ain't getting that you
[1:49:14] become judgment to them when you go cuz
[1:49:16] as soon as you walk in there now they
[1:49:18] have to acknowledge that there's some
[1:49:20] somebody in our
[1:49:21] midst that's right you might not know
[1:49:25] who I
[1:49:26] am I my my name my name Jack Duff is
[1:49:30] just a
[1:49:31] um uh this Jack Duff name is just a name
[1:49:34] you can identify with me on Earth but I
[1:49:37] got a greater name than
[1:49:39] that I got a greater title that name is
[1:49:43] Miss
[1:49:45] Jesus Christ amen Oh Glory Glory Glory
[1:49:51] all right
[1:49:53] let me keep reading
[1:49:57] um blind lead the blind he says the
[1:50:00] people will take on the mark of the
[1:50:01] beast not even knowing what they're
[1:50:02] doing blind lead to Blind they all fall
[1:50:04] in the ditch Jesus said and we're living
[1:50:07] uh later than we think many honest
[1:50:09] people follow that not even knowing what
[1:50:11] they're doing but the hours at hand now
[1:50:15] when the light is shining the Gospel
[1:50:17] Light in his power of the resurrection
[1:50:19] of Jesus Christ manifest himself that
[1:50:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:50:24] and forever he lotted for this day the
[1:50:26] things that he promised for this day
[1:50:28] must happen in this day if the church
[1:50:30] won't accept it it will you receive it
[1:50:33] if the church won't accept it God is
[1:50:35] able of these stones to rise children
[1:50:37] unto Abraham he'll get his message over
[1:50:41] because he's always done it he always
[1:50:43] will do it that means somebody going to
[1:50:46] be on the earth that's going to believe
[1:50:48] it I'm so glad I can say
[1:50:54] I'm one of
[1:50:57] them let me keep going people thinking
[1:51:01] that they're walking in the light the
[1:51:03] traditions of the fathers and the first
[1:51:06] thing you know they're walking in a
[1:51:07] glare of a light not the same light
[1:51:10] rejected the very light that they claim
[1:51:13] to be
[1:51:15] worshiping rejected the very light that
[1:51:19] they claim to be worshiping anyone
[1:51:23] forsaking the revealed word for this
[1:51:25] hour and then rise up and say by me
[1:51:29] forsaken it now I'm
[1:51:32] free boy the devil know how to paint a
[1:51:35] bad
[1:51:36] picture actually you go into
[1:51:40] bondage spiritual bondage and you know
[1:51:43] what hurt the most is that ain't nobody
[1:51:45] around you that you convince that you
[1:51:48] can
[1:51:49] convince that they are they're wrong and
[1:51:51] they need to see what you see
[1:51:53] everybody just like okay praying for
[1:51:58] you yeah and that's just a that's just
[1:52:00] it's a lonely feeling and sometime we
[1:52:03] think that we standing alone uh and you
[1:52:06] know we we got to say if you know if I
[1:52:08] have to stand alone I stand alone it's a
[1:52:10] lonely feeling when you standing out
[1:52:11] there without the truth it's a different
[1:52:14] story when you stand alone on the truth
[1:52:17] because when you stand on on the truth
[1:52:18] like we heard from the sisters on
[1:52:19] Tuesday night you're never alone amen
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:25] amen all right I'm I'm I'm almost
[1:52:27] finished with this one let me it says um
[1:52:30] they walk in the glare of a light not
[1:52:31] the same light reject the very light
[1:52:32] that they claim to be worshiped his
[1:52:34] Works thoroughly Vindicated who he was
[1:52:36] Jesus said himself search the scriptures
[1:52:39] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:52:42] life and they are they that testify me
[1:52:44] who can condemn me of sin he said he who
[1:52:47] can prove that I have said anything or
[1:52:50] any claim that I have made that the
[1:52:52] heavenly father father hasn't Vindicated
[1:52:53] me uh Vindicated that through me he has
[1:52:56] proved to you that he was the light of
[1:52:58] the hour because it was all prophesied
[1:53:00] that this Messiah should be this way and
[1:53:02] hear it bloomed to life but their
[1:53:05] Traditions that separated them from the
[1:53:06] real light of the word now I'm uh I'm
[1:53:10] about done but I just want to read this
[1:53:12] one scripture
[1:53:14] because remember Revelation 10 is where
[1:53:16] I'm
[1:53:18] going uh last week I was just mentioned
[1:53:21] to you out of the resume of the Church
[1:53:22] ages I won't read the quote the full
[1:53:24] quote but brother Brandon promised in
[1:53:27] her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:53:28] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:53:30] right back to where they were at the
[1:53:32] beginning uh he also said God will take
[1:53:34] the church right back to Pentecost of
[1:53:37] the beginning and he's doing it as
[1:53:39] stated in in Joel 2:23 by the teaching
[1:53:42] rain and uh the former rain and the
[1:53:44] Harvest rain uh the teaching rain and he
[1:53:46] said the Harvest rain which is Rapture
[1:53:48] in faith and um and then he also talked
[1:53:51] about how you know there there would be
[1:53:52] many in denominational churches and this
[1:53:54] was this this is a prophet helping us
[1:53:56] see this before the mega church even
[1:53:58] came on the scene the prophet had
[1:54:00] already told us this was coming
[1:54:03] Hallelujah and don't tell me I used to
[1:54:05] work for
[1:54:07] one and and I I I and and working I saw
[1:54:10] a lot of things brother brother brandom
[1:54:12] said in that quote he says uh that they
[1:54:15] were
[1:54:16] outshine the elect in effort and in
[1:54:21] Zeal true
[1:54:23] we got a little Pantry going and we how
[1:54:25] many people y'all y'all
[1:54:27] feeding then compared to how many people
[1:54:29] they feeding they going to outshine the
[1:54:31] elect in effort and Z it's not based on
[1:54:34] how many people we feed let's just go
[1:54:36] out and feed
[1:54:37] somebody amen it's not the numbers it's
[1:54:40] it's it's the action that matters most
[1:54:43] praise the Lord so so so they outshine
[1:54:45] the elect and effort and Zeal he says
[1:54:48] but it's layer to sin is not of Christ
[1:54:50] right and it says uh looks for big
[1:54:54] crowds big programs startling signs
[1:54:58] amongst them they preach the second
[1:54:59] coming of Christ but there's the problem
[1:55:02] but deny the Advent of the Prophet
[1:55:05] messenger and what that advent is the
[1:55:08] arrival of a notable person thing or
[1:55:10] event they they deny the arrival and I'm
[1:55:13] telling you he's already come and he's
[1:55:15] gone before I was even born he was
[1:55:17] already gone that's but I still believe
[1:55:20] his words were for our
[1:55:23] age amen amen Malachi 4 promised it we
[1:55:28] read that Revelation 3:14 promised it we
[1:55:33] read that let me read Revelation 10 the
[1:55:36] this this the reason we believe this
[1:55:38] message is because God promised it
[1:55:40] according to his
[1:55:42] word Malachi 4 read it in your Bible ask
[1:55:46] Google I think um brother brother Diggs
[1:55:49] when I I said in the Philippines I said
[1:55:51] don't search don't search Google search
[1:55:53] the scriptures search the scriptures and
[1:55:55] see what the scriptures are saying
[1:55:57] brother Diggs while he he heard that and
[1:55:58] he had just felt inspired let me just
[1:56:00] search Google for one one quick thing he
[1:56:03] put in there who is Cain's
[1:56:09] [Laughter]
[1:56:12] father and Google brought an answer
[1:56:15] back Google said Kane's father was
[1:56:21] Adam okay
[1:56:23] w
[1:56:25] wow can you trust
[1:56:28] Google because my Bible
[1:56:31] say
[1:56:33] Kain was of that Wicked one that's what
[1:56:38] my Bible say but lazy Christians trust
[1:56:41] Google read your
[1:56:44] Bible if Google say Kane was Adam's

[1:57:53] amen Lord have mercy Revelation 10 let
[1:57:56] me let me let me try to let's look at
[1:57:58] this this is this is a promise for this
[1:58:00] day verse one let's start there and I
[1:58:03] saw another Mighty
[1:58:06] Angel come down from
[1:58:09] heaven clothed with a
[1:58:12] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:58:16] his face was as it were the Sun and his
[1:58:19] feet as pillars of fire now now just so
[1:58:22] that you're clear brother randoms
[1:58:24] already told us who this is this is
[1:58:29] Christ this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:32] now
[1:58:35] uh y'all know in
[1:58:38] 1963 there was a cloud that showed up in
[1:58:42] Arizona and when you the cloud came in
[1:58:45] one particular um
[1:58:48] position and and and all the people that
[1:58:52] I mean the the newspaper whoever it was
[1:58:54] the magazine that took it Life Magazine
[1:58:57] I believe that took the picture uh they
[1:58:59] uh they were trying to wonder what it is
[1:59:01] brother brandham never went to Life
[1:59:04] Magazine to express to them what this
[1:59:08] was but to his church and those that
[1:59:12] would listen to a
[1:59:13] tape he expressed something it says turn
[1:59:18] the
[1:59:19] picture to the right
[1:59:22] and when we turn the picture to the
[1:59:24] right it was seven angels making the
[1:59:26] face of Christ Hallelujah and it was a
[1:59:32] cloud I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:59:37] down from
[1:59:38] heaven
[1:59:40] clothe with a
[1:59:43] cloud these these things already
[1:59:46] manifested okay and a rainbow was upon
[1:59:49] his head and his face were
[1:59:52] uh was as it were the son and his feed
[1:59:55] is pillars of fire I don't have time to
[1:59:57] get into all these things it just so
[1:59:59] this is rich rich rich rich there's a
[2:00:03] quote where I got brother brandom say he
[2:00:04] was standing in the sun preaching the
[2:00:07] gospel and he said when he standing in
[2:00:08] the sun he he he he was he was so so so
[2:00:12] inspired because he said I got two
[2:00:14] climaxes to my sermon and he say he was
[2:00:16] just trying to get the people to just
[2:00:18] hang on for the first Climax and he said
[2:00:20] the people got a little rest restless
[2:00:22] and some of them say I just want some
[2:00:25] biscuits and he said if they want
[2:00:27] biscuits let them go get biscuits he
[2:00:28] said come back for the service at night
[2:00:30] though come back come back he say cuz I
[2:00:32] got another climax for this sermon right
[2:00:35] and uh and he say just watching the
[2:00:37] people say but you know what the problem
[2:00:38] is is the people rejecting the word they
[2:00:41] didn't even realize they were rejecting
[2:00:43] the word and and and they not standing
[2:00:44] around to actually hear the two climaxes
[2:00:47] now now and I was looking at that
[2:00:49] because he had that Vision after a
[2:00:51] sermon that he preached and in the
[2:00:54] sermon that he preached the sermon was
[2:00:56] titled uh spoken words The Original
[2:00:59] Seed in that sermon you'll notice that
[2:01:02] brother brandom did have two
[2:01:06] climaxes if you listen to the sermon
[2:01:08] you'll see there's a part one and
[2:01:10] there's a part two most people probably
[2:01:13] missed what it already happened and let
[2:01:15] me tell you people still missing today
[2:01:17] things that have already happened amen
[2:01:20] oh lord lord lord lord
[2:01:24] Lord
[2:01:25] amen let me uh let me go on don't don't
[2:01:28] get caught
[2:01:29] up brother brandom's not coming back to
[2:01:31] to to do anything
[2:01:33] else his work is
[2:01:37] done it's done church amen if it wasn't
[2:01:41] done then the scripture would not have
[2:01:43] been fulfilled I'm coming to it I'm
[2:01:45] coming to it let me keep reading this
[2:01:47] would not have been fulfilled had had
[2:01:49] his work not been done but because God
[2:01:51] called him home that's all we know his
[2:01:52] work is done sir amen I'm looking for
[2:01:56] him to come back in the general
[2:01:59] Resurrection just like I'm looking for
[2:02:01] my daddy and I'm looking for brother
[2:02:04] Wesco huh I'm looking for brother Mike
[2:02:06] I'm looking for a lot of Believers to
[2:02:08] come
[2:02:09] back my God give me the rest of the
[2:02:12] scripture I I I'm running out of time
[2:02:14] I'm running out of
[2:02:17] time he had his little he had in his
[2:02:20] hand a little book open
[2:02:22] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[2:02:25] and his left foot on the
[2:02:29] earth cried with a loud
[2:02:32] voice as when a lion
[2:02:34] Roth and when he
[2:02:37] cried seven
[2:02:39] Thunders utter their voices now I can
[2:02:43] pause here and take just a little just a
[2:02:45] little time on
[2:02:50] this brother brand tells us what the
[2:02:52] seven Thunders
[2:02:55] are the prophet told us now there's been
[2:02:59] other ministers say different things
[2:03:01] than what the prophet said but my job is
[2:03:04] to
[2:03:05] say what the prophet
[2:03:08] said now you want to know what the
[2:03:09] prophet said right before God called him
[2:03:11] out the scene he says
[2:03:15] this um this Messenger will do two
[2:03:21] things he says the first thing this
[2:03:23] message going to do he says he's going
[2:03:25] to turn the hearts of the children back
[2:03:28] to the faith of the fathers and let me
[2:03:31] tell you something that's already
[2:03:33] happened
[2:03:34] amen the second thing that he was going
[2:03:37] to do he says he says he will
[2:03:41] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[2:03:45] Thunders which are
[2:03:49] contained in the
[2:03:52] Seven Seals yes sir Hallelujah and he
[2:03:56] say he says this right in the church a
[2:03:58] book and he says so so so but but what
[2:04:00] what happened is that people had us
[2:04:01] looking at one
[2:04:04] paragraph in the fourth seal and we
[2:04:07] thought that was it no the messenger
[2:04:10] said it was contained in the
[2:04:13] completion sir of the Seven Seals that
[2:04:16] means that simply means every time a a
[2:04:19] seers reveal a thunder
[2:04:22] was
[2:04:26] manifested now now now now now now
[2:04:28] here's the thing amen that does not take
[2:04:31] away the fact that we need the Holy
[2:04:34] Ghost to
[2:04:36] manifest The Life of Christ in
[2:04:40] us but your virtues are not your
[2:04:42] Thunders am amen your virtues is a holy
[2:04:47] ghost life amen and if you claim to have
[2:04:50] the Holy Ghost these virtues should be
[2:04:51] manifested in
[2:04:53] you amen the Thunders were according to
[2:04:58] the prophet the things that were
[2:05:00] revealed in the Seven Seals amen yes yes
[2:05:04] sir that's what he told us amen then I
[2:05:08] get brothers that they they they they
[2:05:11] they actually if you hear somebody say
[2:05:14] well seven seal book is not
[2:05:17] inspired don't don't don't read that
[2:05:19] it's not inspired we don't actually have
[2:05:20] a tape recording of the seven seal book
[2:05:23] I mean I'm sorry the seven Church age
[2:05:25] book so that's not inspired so don't you
[2:05:27] know I would just I you know that's
[2:05:29] brother LEL book when you hear people
[2:05:32] say that to you you know they're trying
[2:05:35] to prove a doctrine that cannot be
[2:05:38] supported by the seven Church age book
[2:05:41] every doctrine that we believe in this
[2:05:43] message was found in the church age book
[2:05:47] even the seals were in the seven Church
[2:05:49] age
[2:05:50] book oh my God
[2:05:52] everything we believe was there so so so
[2:05:55] so what happens that brother Brandon
[2:05:56] before he passed he was working with
[2:05:58] brother Lil for 5 years to get that book
[2:06:01] translated and it's written in a way
[2:06:03] that anybody can understand it they even
[2:06:05] use it at or Roberts uh
[2:06:08] University they use a church age book so
[2:06:11] you know that book's pretty important
[2:06:13] and and and the other thing I find is
[2:06:15] that right after brother brandom
[2:06:16] approved it the very month that he
[2:06:18] approved that I'm good with this let's
[2:06:20] release it God called them
[2:06:26] home and then people say they don't want
[2:06:28] it I'll take
[2:06:30] it I'll take
[2:06:33] it am I remember being in Africa for the
[2:06:36] first time and uh while I was while I
[2:06:39] was there they had they they you know
[2:06:41] how to get James Erol Jones to read
[2:06:43] certain parts of the Bible uh actually
[2:06:45] read the whole Bible they just use his
[2:06:47] voice you know and just you know you
[2:06:49] push play in got James ear voice uh play
[2:06:51] and James O Jones voice well there was a
[2:06:53] brother that read the whole church age
[2:06:55] book like that and um so we got there to
[2:06:58] Africa and they was they there was
[2:07:00] playing a tape in a vehicle while we
[2:07:02] were driving I was in uh um uh Nigeria
[2:07:07] and um and and um so I'm listening to
[2:07:10] this
[2:07:12] tape I'm like
[2:07:14] uh now that ain't brother brandom's
[2:07:18] voice but that's the word
[2:07:24] I know I know this ain't brother this
[2:07:25] ain't brother rand's voice but this is
[2:07:27] the word I know this the word so what
[2:07:28] and they just going on and on so the
[2:07:30] brother say oh no no this is the new
[2:07:31] tape that they got where a brother read
[2:07:33] the church age book and that that's what
[2:07:35] we just planing that I said okay I knew
[2:07:37] it was the word even though one brother
[2:07:39] Brandon's voice and I could say Amen to
[2:07:41] it because I knew it was the
[2:07:43] word
[2:07:46] hallelujah you got to know what is the
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:49] word and what's not the word
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:53] word and I'm going tell you this there
[2:07:55] are people in your message that are not
[2:07:59] on the
[2:08:06] word get back in
[2:08:10] Step let me keep reading let me keep
[2:08:13] reading let me keep
[2:08:16] reading when the seven Thunders that
[2:08:18] uttered their
[2:08:19] voices I was about to write that I mean
[2:08:21] John heard it and he was going to write
[2:08:24] it but he didn't because this this this
[2:08:27] this the reason John Couldn't Write it
[2:08:29] because this was left for brother
[2:08:31] Brandon to reveal this was his ministry
[2:08:35] the same way the same way John can write
[2:08:38] what the Thunders that uttered right
[2:08:39] brother brandom could not go to
[2:08:44] Israel the same God that stopped John is
[2:08:47] the same God that stopped brother
[2:08:48] Brandon from going into Israel because
[2:08:50] that's not his
[2:08:52] Ministry oh my when these when the seven
[2:08:56] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[2:08:57] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[2:08:59] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[2:09:02] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[2:09:06] write them not John heard it but
[2:09:08] couldn't write it let me go on and the
[2:09:11] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[2:09:13] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[2:09:17] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[2:09:19] forever and ever who created the Heaven
[2:09:22] and the things that therein are in the
[2:09:23] earth and the things that therein are in
[2:09:25] the sea and the things which are therein
[2:09:26] that there should be time no longer and
[2:09:28] now I believe it's in my um I go back to
[2:09:30] that verse in my uh emphatic daglock
[2:09:34] which is the original translation of the
[2:09:36] scripture it'll say time shall no longer
[2:09:39] be
[2:09:41] delayed can I put it this way we are at
[2:09:43] the end of the
[2:09:46] end the these scriptures have already
[2:09:48] been manifested people afraid to even
[2:09:50] read this in the churches but we we can
[2:09:52] read it and even tell you that it's
[2:09:53] already been
[2:09:54] manifested a time shall be no longer
[2:09:57] Revelation 10:6 look at this verse verse
[2:09:59] 7 but in the
[2:10:01] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:10:05] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:10:09] of God should be finished as he have
[2:10:10] declared to his servants the
[2:10:16] prophets would y'all allow me just to
[2:10:18] read two more quotes and I will will
[2:10:21] close out today they going to be related
[2:10:23] to these
[2:10:27] verses this this is coming out of I have
[2:10:31] heard but now I
[2:10:36] see says what if Moses would have come
[2:10:39] and said let's build an ark like Noah
[2:10:41] did float out of Egypt down the river oh
[2:10:43] no sea no he had a message from God he
[2:10:46] was the manifestation that Prophet
[2:10:48] arising on the scene ought to have
[2:10:50] proved to it is right there they hadn't
[2:10:53] had a prophet for 400 years they hadn't
[2:10:55] had a prophet and here a prophet Rises
[2:10:58] on the scene they ought to they ought to
[2:11:00] have know that something was going to
[2:11:02] happen Israel again hadn't had a prophet
[2:11:04] for hundreds of years and and and here
[2:11:06] come Jesus on the scene and the woman at
[2:11:08] the well said sir I I perceive that you
[2:11:11] are a prophet now we haven't had one for
[2:11:13] for 400 years because he know what was
[2:11:15] in her heart see now he goes on here and
[2:11:17] I have heard but now I see he says now
[2:11:19] we're promised a church age through
[2:11:22] reformers that's uh Luther and Wesley we
[2:11:25] promis the church a through through
[2:11:26] through reformers he says and we've had
[2:11:29] them but he promised in Malachi 4 he
[2:11:34] keep his pattern in the last days what
[2:11:38] would take place to turn the hearts of
[2:11:41] the children back to the faith of the
[2:11:43] apostolic father for that very purpose
[2:11:46] and the church is to be broke up in
[2:11:48] denominations and isms it it's it's it's
[2:11:52] so tore to Pieces he says till it's dead
[2:11:55] it's been a carrier and then he promised
[2:11:58] in the hour of the seventh Angel's
[2:12:01] message Revelation 10:7 he promised in
[2:12:03] the hour of the seventh Angel's message
[2:12:05] the Seven Seals would be revealed which
[2:12:09] also are the
[2:12:12] Thunders because the the seals are the
[2:12:15] Mysteries that were contained underneath
[2:12:17] the Thunders all right he says um and
[2:12:20] then he promised in the hour the seventh
[2:12:22] Angels message the Seven Seals would be
[2:12:23] revealed and look at this and the
[2:12:25] Mysteries would be declared Revelation
[2:12:29] 10 when the seventh angel begins to
[2:12:33] sound his
[2:12:35] message
[2:12:37] not the healing
[2:12:40] service the

[2:15:53] Church age fulfills exactly in this age
[2:15:55] St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of
[2:15:57] man shall be revealed and there shall AR
[2:16:00] there shall rise false prophets and
[2:16:01] false christs show great signs and
[2:16:04] wonders and and people try to say that
[2:16:05] about brother Brandon the Bible say it's
[2:16:07] going to be false false prophets now
[2:16:10] remember brother brandom told us this
[2:16:12] for every bogus
[2:16:15] dollar I don't care how many bogus
[2:16:17] dollars how many false prophets you got
[2:16:18] out there in order to get a bogus dollar
[2:16:21] you got to have at least
[2:16:23] one one real dollar to make bogus
[2:16:26] dollars from it sir right so we got to
[2:16:28] have one real Prophet if we're going to
[2:16:30] have a lot of false prophets so you want
[2:16:32] to find the real
[2:16:33] Prophet we found them look at
[2:16:38] this there shall AR there shall arise
[2:16:40] false Pro prophets and false Christ show
[2:16:42] great signs and wonders in so much it
[2:16:45] would deceive the very elect if possible
[2:16:47] the people still in doubt and as usual
[2:16:49] the church is just just puzzled let me
[2:16:52] keep going and the science all through
[2:16:55] Tucson yet they're writing pieces and
[2:16:57] put in the paper way back over on Mount
[2:16:59] Lemon uh them big cameras didn't see it
[2:17:02] rising up from where where where we were
[2:17:04] standing drifting on towards the West
[2:17:06] showing the time is
[2:17:10] over now remember the scripture said
[2:17:12] that time would be no more showing that
[2:17:15] time is over amen it can't go but a
[2:17:19] little piece there
[2:17:21] is at the West Coast judgment struck
[2:17:23] just in the very way it went going right
[2:17:26] up over Phoenix and right on across onto
[2:17:29] Prescott and across the mountain to the
[2:17:31] West Coast right on uh up into uh where
[2:17:34] was they going right on up into Alaska
[2:17:36] and she is thundering heading right that
[2:17:38] way and the observ and OBS observatories
[2:17:43] and all of them in Tucson all still
[2:17:45] asking research of science trying to
[2:17:47] find out what it is so high they can't
[2:17:50] they they they so high it can't be foged
[2:17:53] mist or nothing up there what did it
[2:17:56] where is it at they're just as puzzle of
[2:17:58] the supernatural Halo hanging Yonder in
[2:18:00] the sky as there was when the Magi come
[2:18:04] in following a star saying where is he
[2:18:07] that's born King of the Jews what was it
[2:18:09] God fulfilling his word and there shall
[2:18:13] rise a star out of Jacob he says and and
[2:18:17] and the god of Heaven promised the
[2:18:19] evening time would have evening lights
[2:18:24] watch this one now 3 years
[2:18:28] ago this mystery was a
[2:18:32] prophecy what time is it
[2:18:35] sir but
[2:18:37] now but
[2:18:40] now it's
[2:18:45] history the prophet has already come the
[2:18:48] prophet has already gone and if he had
[2:18:51] not done his job it wouldn't be
[2:18:53] considered history but the prophet
[2:18:56] himself said this has already been
[2:18:57] manifested it was a mystery three years
[2:19:00] ago
[2:19:01] 1962 it was a mystery but in 1965 it was
[2:19:06] history and we've been fellowshipping
[2:19:09] around
[2:19:12] history for the last 60 years amen amen
[2:19:18] amen it's pasted the promises fulfilled
[2:19:22] what time is it sir and what's the
[2:19:24] attraction God fulfilling his word he's
[2:19:28] the same yesterday today and forever now
[2:19:31] he said let us pray and I'm going to do
[2:19:33] that but I want to tell you we have
[2:19:34] received the
[2:19:37] Advent
[2:19:39] yes of this
[2:19:41] messenger we believe he's come and gone
[2:19:44] and that's why we keep identifying what
[2:19:47] he said in order to keep the church in
[2:19:49] line now you know it took 40 Years of
[2:19:52] the children of Israel going through the
[2:19:53] Wilderness before they actually entered
[2:19:55] the promised land but you know in that
[2:19:57] 40 years what they had to do they had to
[2:20:00] stay with what
[2:20:02] Moses
[2:20:04] said and I don't care how much
[2:20:06] fanaticism rose up in the midst of them
[2:20:08] 40 years just like for us it's been 60
[2:20:10] years but I don't care how much
[2:20:12] fanaticism rise up the the miracle is US
[2:20:14] keeping our head above the fanaticism
[2:20:16] and staying with this word amen I'm
[2:20:19] church I'm encourag you get back and
[2:20:21] step and and if you if and and and as
[2:20:23] the Lord has carried us over into this
[2:20:25] new year we got other people out there
[2:20:26] that's out of Step I I know why some
[2:20:29] people won't come to this church they
[2:20:31] know where I stand with this word they
[2:20:33] hear me preaching but I'm going to
[2:20:35] encourage you if you have a question
[2:20:37] with anything that I'm standing on this
[2:20:38] word let's sit down and talk about it I
[2:20:42] can go through the Bible and I can go
[2:20:44] through the message with you and I'd be
[2:20:47] happy to do it anything anything you got
[2:20:50] to question about let's let's talk about
[2:20:54] it oh I know where I'm standing
[2:20:57] at I know exactly why is this why is
[2:21:00] that and and I could tell y'all some of
[2:21:02] the questions that I know people
[2:21:03] thinking why you do this why you do that
[2:21:06] why you let this brother preach why you
[2:21:08] let that I can give you I give you
[2:21:09] answers for everything you
[2:21:11] got now the question is not whether I
[2:21:14] got an
[2:21:15] answer the question
[2:21:19] is am if you can receive
[2:21:23] it let's
[2:21:27] pray
[2:21:29] father Lord I just I'm this has just
[2:21:32] been a good journey for
[2:21:34] me I I believe it's been one for the
[2:21:37] church as
[2:21:39] well Lord to see that we're standing on
[2:21:42] on
[2:21:44] Vindicated
[2:21:46] word your Prophet has provided has given
[2:21:49] it to us
[2:21:53] Lord a Ministry that you uh called them
[2:21:56] off the scene 60 years ago but yet we're
[2:21:58] holding true to what was
[2:22:03] spoken no one has received Vindication
[2:22:06] way he received Vindication Supernatural
[2:22:08] events that he received nobody even in
[2:22:11] that time and since that time has
[2:22:13] received that type of vindication so we
[2:22:15] know Lord Jesus this was of
[2:22:17] you and as we hold steady
[2:22:21] there a division showed that the bride
[2:22:24] would get out of Step but somehow
[2:22:26] somehow as the prophet prayed let them
[2:22:28] get back in step we find ourselves in
[2:22:32] that place where we we're we're back in
[2:22:34] step and we're trying to help others
[2:22:35] Lord Jesus we're trying to help others
[2:22:38] father come to this place where they
[2:22:40] recognize the word not not not a feeling
[2:22:42] not an emotion not anything but Lord
[2:22:45] this word that's what we have to stand
[2:22:47] on that that's all that matters you said
[2:22:49] in your word heavens and earth will pass
[2:22:51] away but the word uh it won't pass away
[2:22:54] it'll remain it'll remain a a a stable
[2:22:59] it remains solid Lord it remains
[2:23:01] something we can tie uh our our faith to
[2:23:05] thank you that we have a to host Lord
[2:23:10] Jesus you promis a
[2:23:12] restoration and God we are under
[2:23:14] expectation that you would do exactly
[2:23:17] what you
[2:23:18] said so Lord as we as we as we move
[2:23:22] forward into this New Year Jesus we
[2:23:25] we're trusting that you would direct
[2:23:27] every step that you would lead us that
[2:23:28] you would guide us that you would help
[2:23:30] us father that we would walk according
[2:23:33] to the beat of the
[2:23:36] Gospel the music of the word of God
[2:23:39] that's how we want to walk according to
[2:23:41] that Lord if some of the people have
[2:23:43] questions Lord just help us to be able
[2:23:45] to answer the questions I know I'm not
[2:23:47] the only one in this church that can
[2:23:48] help answer questions you have you have
[2:23:50] you you've you've established so many
[2:23:52] different ones on this word they
[2:23:54] understand the truth Lord they
[2:23:55] understand what you've done so Lord they
[2:23:57] can answer the questions and it's not
[2:23:59] whether the questions can be answered
[2:24:01] it's simply will the people receive what
[2:24:04] you've done and I pray that you open up
[2:24:07] Hearts to receive what you've done in
[2:24:11] this hour God we thank you for this year
[2:24:14] of overflow thank you that the wine and
[2:24:17] the oil will overflow God and and as we
[2:24:19] see this stimulation of Revelation and
[2:24:21] we see the Holy Spirit moving and and
[2:24:24] the ways beyond our expectations we also
[2:24:26] know that you'll overflow naturally
[2:24:27] father and we expect it father in
[2:24:30] businesses and homes and families and

[2:24:49] the year the famine he managed the
[2:24:51] Overflow that it would sustain him even
