[32:21] appreciated that you know yesterday I
[32:23] got a chance to see brother Wes Co he
[32:26] said brother Solomon the Lord surely is
[32:29] faithful he said it to me about 10 times
[32:33] likewise brother Wescoe keep telling me
[32:35] that and that is truly his testimony and
[32:38] I believe you know sometimes ministers
[32:41] well brothers and sisters really get
[32:43] tendered at a time and they they can
[32:45] sense there's a need that you have in
[32:47] your life they just got to give him a
[32:49] word to encourage you and faithfulness
[32:52] was a word that he really pressed into
[32:55] my soul so I thank you very much brother
[32:57] Jeffrey for that special is very timely
[32:59] to me I needed that and god bless you my
[33:02] brother praise the Lord Amen sister Liz

[33:08] faithfulness of Almighty God
[33:10] [Applause]
[33:13] [Music]
[33:19] god bless see sounds Loki hope in there
[33:22] brother Jack forgot but he remembered so
[33:25] God has a reason for this um I just
[33:28] wanted to come for the church and just
[33:30] give a small little testimony I know a
[33:32] lot of people see me here I haven't like
[33:34] actually come up and given my like small
[33:37] testimony about what God has brought me
[33:38] through and what he's been doing for me
[33:40] sometimes you see me in the back and I'm
[33:42] screaming and I'm yelling I'm saying
[33:43] hallelujah there's a reason behind it
[33:45] and last Sunday I believe it was brother
[33:50] quake who I don't remember no brother
[33:52] Jack it was a Bible study he was saying
[33:54] sometimes you got to tell people your
[33:56] life story like your testimony and so
[33:59] that they can understand why you're
[34:00] yelling and why you screaming why you're
[34:01] saying thank you Jesus I'm sorry I'm
[34:04] shaking right now
[34:05] um so as many of you guys know I work in
[34:07] an emergency room it's already a very
[34:10] stressful environment when I had first
[34:12] started there it was very difficult
[34:13] getting adjusted I was going through so
[34:18] many things I felt like I just no matter
[34:21] what I did I couldn't fit in there was
[34:24] three people in particular that would
[34:25] like literally like bully me and it was
[34:28] just like so much going on to the point
[34:29] where every small time I walked into
[34:31] work I would have so much anxiety like I
[34:33] was feel like I was gonna vomit and I'm
[34:35] not that type of person like I walk into
[34:37] an environment and I'm really common but
[34:39] for some reason every small time I would
[34:41] walk into there and I know these people
[34:43] were there I just knew that something
[34:45] was gonna happen and it was just it was
[34:47] always trouble in my heart it came it
[34:50] got so bad to the point where they I was
[34:54] sent off the unit I was sent out of the
[34:56] ER for a whole month
[34:57] and I remember I never cried in my life
[35:02] that night I cried that day when my boss
[35:04] told me I'm gonna put you on another
[35:06] floor for a month I called my mom on the
[35:09] phone and I cried I bust out crying I
[35:11] was just like why is this happening to
[35:13] me like I'm really trying to figure I'm
[35:15] really trying to do the best thing but
[35:17] whatever but I I don't like how people
[35:19] are just talking to me any type of way
[35:21] and how they're treating me like this
[35:23] like it's not fair so I was sent off the
[35:25] unit and
[35:26] knows why he sent me off that unit when
[35:28] I was in this other unit I found a
[35:30] family and I built more experience in
[35:33] another type of environment and I
[35:35] remember speaking to brother Jack and
[35:38] sister Erica about it and I was like I
[35:39] think I'm gonna quit and I remember
[35:41] speaking to Rachel's like I think I'm
[35:42] gonna quit like this is just too much
[35:44] and then just sitting down with them and
[35:47] talking to them brother Jack and sister
[35:49] Erica reminded me that this is what I
[35:51] was praying for that God have put me in
[35:52] this place for a particular reason that
[35:55] I was studying really hard to come to
[35:56] this ER and that no one was gonna kick
[35:59] me out unless God wanted me to leave so
[36:02] I told my mom this also and my mom said
[36:05] it's okay all we're gonna do is just
[36:07] pray about it so she had me write down
[36:10] the there names of three names and then
[36:13] we prayed over it and then slowly but
[36:15] surely like things just started
[36:17] happening I came back to the unit in the
[36:19] ER one of the one of the nurses that was
[36:22] bothering me that was bullying me he
[36:24] transferred to another unit the other
[36:26] one that was bothering me she resigned
[36:29] my director that was bothering me she
[36:33] was suspended for a while and I was just
[36:35] like god I don't know what's going on
[36:37] I'm like did I pray too hard but my I
[36:39] see you moving though God I see you
[36:42] moving and ever since I've been back on
[36:44] that unit no one has bothered me it's
[36:46] just it's been God and I'm just so
[36:47] thankful and grateful for everything
[36:49] that he's done and it took a while but
[36:51] it happened just in time when it needed
[36:53] to happen and I'm so grateful for that
[36:55] and the people that didn't know that
[36:56] we're helping me pray thank you for your
[36:58] prayers and I just I just had to give
[37:00] that small little testimony if you're
[37:02] going through something no matter how
[37:04] long it takes you just stay firm and
[37:06] strong you just came to to pray and just
[37:08] know that God will take care of you
[37:10] I just wanted a small little short
[37:13] course soon as I stopped worrying
[37:24] worried in how the story

[1:12:21] want to focus our attention but if you
[1:12:25] would just allow me amen before we get
[1:12:27] to started down that path today a man
[1:12:32] let me just read something here I want
[1:12:34] to read from the message the second
[1:12:36] coming of the Lord and I want to start
[1:12:39] at paragraph 54 my man in this
[1:12:42] particular sermon the second coming of
[1:12:44] the Lord
[1:12:44] paragraph 54 it reads as follows it says
[1:12:48] it's later than we think my god and I
[1:12:55] love this the Prophet makes the
[1:12:56] statement says we don't come to church
[1:12:58] to occupy a Pew that's not the purpose
[1:13:02] of coming to church that's the occupier
[1:13:04] seat it says we do not come to church to
[1:13:07] hear
[1:13:08] a good sermon a man or come to church to
[1:13:12] hear good music oh that's good but
[1:13:16] that's not why we're coming to church he
[1:13:19] says they all got their place but what
[1:13:22] we better come to church to do is check
[1:13:27] up with God oh I like this a man we need
[1:13:32] to come and check out with God and our
[1:13:34] soul salvation for the day of redemption
[1:13:37] is near amen and I wanna I'm gonna just
[1:13:41] stop right there but you know I was just
[1:13:42] thinking on the spot here this week
[1:13:45] you know church is like a spiritual
[1:13:48] hospital amen and we're certainly
[1:13:51] grateful that we can come to the spirit
[1:13:54] to hospital and get our our needs met
[1:13:57] get cared for but just like in the
[1:14:00] natural amen when you go to the hospital
[1:14:03] the objective is for you to go and
[1:14:06] actually change conditions praise the
[1:14:10] Lord it's not to go in with one
[1:14:12] condition and then stay in that
[1:14:16] condition the objective is that the
[1:14:18] condition would be modified by the time
[1:14:21] you leave and if you come here to the
[1:14:24] spiritual hospital today with a
[1:14:26] particular condition the objective is
[1:14:29] that the Holy Spirit will take care of
[1:14:31] your condition before you leave
[1:14:34] hallelujah church a man we're not coming
[1:14:37] just to hear good music we're not coming
[1:14:40] just to hear a good sermon amen but
[1:14:42] we're coming here to do a check-up with
[1:14:45] God hallelujah now you know we are we we
[1:14:48] we had a significant week this week and
[1:14:51] a man I thought it was very appropriate
[1:14:53] for us just to kind of talk about
[1:14:55] something that that occurred and you
[1:14:58] know just saw you know these people that
[1:15:00] are doing these things these are just
[1:15:02] scientists that you don't have kind of
[1:15:05] come together and they decided to
[1:15:07] to change the Doomsday Clock that the
[1:15:11] scientists you know are the ones that
[1:15:13] they look at certain things that happen
[1:15:16] here in our earth on the earth and they
[1:15:18] look at how countries do certain things
[1:15:20] they they listen to the president's
[1:15:22] freaking you know they just watch all
[1:15:24] kind of stuffing and then they decide
[1:15:26] that we're gonna have to set this
[1:15:27] Doomsday Clock one way or the other
[1:15:30] hallelujah there's been times that the
[1:15:32] doomsday doomsday clock is actually
[1:15:34] going the opposite way any man if you
[1:15:36] studied it goes the opposite way but but
[1:15:38] based on where we are right now they
[1:15:40] decided to set it and that they put it
[1:15:43] out a spot that a man that it has never
[1:15:46] gone before
[1:15:47] a man it used to be two minutes used to
[1:15:50] be three minutes there was one time in
[1:15:51] history was sitting at at twelve minutes
[1:15:54] and I believe in 1991 I think that
[1:15:56] seventeen minutes but but they decided
[1:15:58] to put it less than a minute at 100
[1:16:01] seconds hallelujah this is what
[1:16:05] scientists feel that we're that much
[1:16:07] closer to doomsday now now now now now I
[1:16:10] want to go beyond science because as a
[1:16:12] believer if they are doomsday then I'm
[1:16:16] looking for options please God interview
[1:16:19] and you put me at a hundred seconds to
[1:16:22] how much closer am I to rapture than
[1:16:25] they are to Tuesday's so if we are that
[1:16:30] close if science is picking up on it
[1:16:32] then we asked believers need to pick up
[1:16:34] on this and we need to do a checkup
[1:16:38] glory to God
[1:16:40] I was just reading Amen a little bit
[1:16:42] here on the internet when I'm talking
[1:16:45] about this Doomsday Clock this is they
[1:16:47] say humanity continues to face two
[1:16:51] simultaneous existence dangers to things
[1:16:56] that can put us out of existence
[1:16:57] it says nuclear war and climate change
[1:17:02] my god say nuclear war and climate
[1:17:05] change says that a man glory to God let
[1:17:09] me get this cuz I be preaching for a
[1:17:10] long time and I gotta put myself on a
[1:17:12] timer
[1:17:13] he say he says
[1:17:15] that are compounded by a threat
[1:17:18] multiplier it says cyber and amyl
[1:17:22] information warfare amen hallelujah
[1:17:26] you know glory to God you know I did
[1:17:29] these things uh you know when we even
[1:17:31] look at politics and all that and how
[1:17:34] things happen people break it into this
[1:17:36] and break it and Riaan fluence and
[1:17:38] decisions oh my and then it creates a
[1:17:42] problem because somebody gets upset how
[1:17:44] did they do that who did that
[1:17:46] why did they do that naughty ready to go
[1:17:48] to war right amen somebody hacked into
[1:17:52] this and did that from some other
[1:17:53] country amen it's creating property
[1:17:56] creates a tension in the world Oh glory
[1:18:00] to God amen look he said they say
[1:18:02] compounded by a threat multiplier
[1:18:04] cyber-enabled information warfare that
[1:18:07] undercuts society's ability to respond
[1:18:11] the international security situation is
[1:18:16] dire this is their statement it is dying
[1:18:19] not just because these threats exist but
[1:18:23] because world leaders have allowed the
[1:18:25] International political infrastructure
[1:18:28] for managing them to erode now now you
[1:18:32] know I said early that it was about 17
[1:18:34] minutes back in 1991 and that this
[1:18:37] distance clock was set at 17 minutes at
[1:18:39] that time you had the US and you had
[1:18:41] Russia coming to an agreement that they
[1:18:44] were not going to have any nuclear
[1:18:46] warfare that they were going to kind of
[1:18:48] eliminate some of this stuff stop
[1:18:50] talking about all that so when it
[1:18:52] wouldn't win with science say they say
[1:18:54] if they're gonna disarm themselves then
[1:18:56] we're gonna set the clock to 17 17
[1:18:58] minutes but now amen
[1:19:02] they're looking at something else a man
[1:19:03] they're not talking about disarming a
[1:19:05] time I actually added more arms all
[1:19:07] right watch this in the nuclear rim
[1:19:09] national leaders have ended or
[1:19:12] undermined it
[1:19:14] major arms control treaties now here we
[1:19:18] silent agreement that we gonna do this
[1:19:21] and then you get another political
[1:19:24] leader and office that forgets about
[1:19:25] what the other agreement I mean forget
[1:19:27] about what the other presidents I'm not
[1:19:29] even thinking about it we're gonna do
[1:19:31] what we want to do the scientists are
[1:19:33] picking up on this so my and they reset
[1:19:37] the clock alright watch this now it says
[1:19:41] in the nuclear rim national leaders have
[1:19:44] ended or undermined it several major
[1:19:47] arms control treaties and negotiations
[1:19:50] during the last year creating an
[1:19:53] environment conducive to a renewed
[1:19:56] nuclear arms race amen to the
[1:19:59] proliferation of nuclear weapons and to
[1:20:02] lower barriers to nuclear war political
[1:20:05] conflicts regarding nuclear programs in
[1:20:08] Iran and North Korea remain unresolved
[1:20:10] and are if anything worsening US and
[1:20:16] Russia cooperation on arms control and
[1:20:18] disarmament is all but non-existent now
[1:20:22] when they saw these things are they
[1:20:24] looking at this they said you know what
[1:20:25] we don't have to set this truck and they
[1:20:28] moved it to a hundred seconds and that's
[1:20:31] the that's the that's the shortest time
[1:20:33] it has ever been in since the clock
[1:20:35] existence I think it started in 1947
[1:20:37] here's the shortest time it's ever been
[1:20:39] eight they say doomsday within 100
[1:20:41] seconds 100 seconds to midnight 100
[1:20:45] seconds to midnight
[1:20:46] that's short y'all that's short they may
[1:20:50] if they don't have any confidence in the
[1:20:52] end leadership how we gonna put our
[1:20:55] confidence in leadership any moment the
[1:20:59] clock could strike midnight and are we
[1:21:01] ready to go in at that moment all right
[1:21:05] look at this I want to just bring a
[1:21:06] quote in the Prophet makes a statement
[1:21:08] and the message the second coming of the
[1:21:10] Lord I'm going back to paragraph 46
[1:21:13] hallelujah he says now I have a picture
[1:21:16] at home he says or I believe it's loaned
[1:21:19] out at the time
[1:21:20] called by the scientists three minutes
[1:21:23] before midnight now this is 1957 that
[1:21:28] he's writing this and actually in 1957
[1:21:31] it was actually two minutes to midnight
[1:21:33] because 1953 to 1959 they had it at 2
[1:21:37] minutes 1960 they put it at 7 minutes
[1:21:40] and then I found something striking in
[1:21:42] 1963 they put it at 12 minutes what
[1:21:48] happened in 1963 some angels came down
[1:21:51] and sent sent a prophet back to
[1:21:53] Jeffersonville and they put it at 12
[1:21:55] minutes
[1:21:56] oh my right but here the probably pick
[1:21:59] this up it says now I have a picture at
[1:22:02] home or I believe it's loaned out at
[1:22:04] this time called by the scientist three
[1:22:07] minutes before midnight if the
[1:22:09] scientific world have said the clock has
[1:22:12] went around until it's three minutes
[1:22:14] before midnight and I think they cut
[1:22:16] that down now till about one minute
[1:22:20] before midnight now that's what the
[1:22:21] brothers say oh my I think they cut that
[1:22:24] down and that's exactly what happened
[1:22:25] this week they cut it down it's a minute
[1:22:27] it over a little over a minute and a
[1:22:29] half listen he says I think they've cut
[1:22:32] that down down till about one minute
[1:22:34] before midnight when they discovered
[1:22:37] hydrogen or oxygen atomic and all these
[1:22:41] great all those great powers that they
[1:22:43] could harness could completely cause a
[1:22:46] total annihilation in five minutes time
[1:22:49] nothing you can do about it if they
[1:22:52] press the button nothing you can do
[1:22:53] about it you're done for
[1:22:54] that's why you can't come to church a
[1:22:56] man just like it's a visit this is not a
[1:23:00] picnic that we're going on this is time
[1:23:02] for a checkup
[1:23:04] is your life ready that if they press
[1:23:07] the button you wouldn't even have time
[1:23:09] to repair you understand you wouldn't
[1:23:13] even have tied you didn't you wouldn't
[1:23:14] even know it was coming my god
[1:23:16] they got this thing so designed that not
[1:23:19] even I mean I believe Russia said they
[1:23:22] had something now that not even the US
[1:23:24] could detect what they was doing and I
[1:23:26] don't let if you tried to block it it
[1:23:28] has intelligence inside it to go around
[1:23:31] what you try why are you trying to block
[1:23:33] it my church we are in we are at zero
[1:23:37] time glory I know we want our career so
[1:23:42] now I know we want this and I know we

[1:24:00] was baptized with the Spirit of God
[1:24:04] glory to God listen listen he says if
[1:24:07] the scientific girl has the clock cast
[1:24:09] went around till it's three minutes
[1:24:10] before midnight and I think they cut
[1:24:12] that down now till about one minute
[1:24:14] before midnight when they discover
[1:24:16] hydrogen oxygen atomic and and all these
[1:24:19] great powers that they could harness
[1:24:21] could completely cause a total
[1:24:23] annihilation

[1:30:54] realize we're gonna wait we got little
[1:30:56] will we realize that that night gonna be
[1:31:00] our last night you know that the rapture
[1:31:04] could be so fast because the Bible said

[1:32:01] before the promised son actually came on

[1:32:07] getting that from
[1:32:08] when Abraham took Sarah down to garage
[1:32:13] hallelujah
[1:32:14] Abimelech was bearing
[1:32:17] and Abraham looked at Sarah saying I I

[1:34:36] back to a young man or young woman he
[1:34:39] says but now they were waiting for the
[1:34:40] complete body change and that's where we

[1:39:12] take place we're at the end time we're
[1:39:15] here no way to stop it all the begging
[1:39:17] we might put an Eisenhower in every
[1:39:20] country and it will never stop it Jesus
[1:39:22] Christ said these times will come we're
[1:39:24] here the fig tree put them forth this
[1:39:26] bud so I'm just you don't want to just
[1:39:29] kind of bring that in church this is a
[1:39:30] lot closer these are not just news
[1:39:32] events we need to kind of keep our eyes
[1:39:34] on what's going on and it's and it's
[1:39:36] closer than we think it's absolutely
[1:39:39] closer than we think now can I just kind
[1:39:44] of shift gears here oh my I want to talk
[1:39:49] about Sarah you know we've been talking
[1:39:51] about this catch division and step into
[1:39:54] it and and we use a man these two women
[1:39:58] Martha and Mary as Jesus was coming to
[1:40:02] the grave of last
[1:40:03] and and Jesus came to the grave by a
[1:40:07] vision hallelujah he knew that God had
[1:40:10] already showed him that he was going to
[1:40:12] raise Lazarus from the grave so as we
[1:40:14] begin to do with the disciples about
[1:40:16] let's go to our friend Lazarus he's
[1:40:18] sleeping and Jesus used different terms
[1:40:21] than than what they were using it said
[1:40:23] well if he's sleeping we shouldn't go
[1:40:25] wake them same y'all don't get it
[1:40:27] Lazarus is dead oh let us go and die
[1:40:31] with us y'all still don't get it they
[1:40:34] they were they didn't even realize what
[1:40:35] was going on just say let's just go and
[1:40:37] visit visit Lazarus and as they were
[1:40:39] going over there Martha heard that Jesus
[1:40:41] was coming hallelujah and this woman
[1:40:45] Martha had a different spirit on her I
[1:40:47] like to say that Martha had the ability
[1:40:50] to shake herself from an atmosphere I
[1:40:53] want to say that again Martha had the
[1:40:57] ability to shake herself from a
[1:41:00] particular atmosphere amen and I'm gonna
[1:41:03] tell you something this hour you gonna
[1:41:05] have to st. you're gonna need the same
[1:41:06] ability to shake yourself from different
[1:41:09] atmospheres hey man the devil want to
[1:41:14] try to keep you in a certain atmosphere
[1:41:15] of unbelief the devil will to keeping
[1:41:18] the atmosphere down the devil want to
[1:41:21] keep you in an atmosphere of groaning
[1:41:22] and complaining it and moaning and why
[1:41:24] me and I know you got to shake yourself
[1:41:27] know that God is in control of
[1:41:29] everything
[1:41:31] Martha had the ability to shake herself
[1:41:35] from the atmosphere of unbelief and
[1:41:37] declared her faith that even now
[1:41:40] whatsoever you ask God I believe he'll
[1:41:43] give it to you I know my brother been
[1:41:45] there for four days but I believe even
[1:41:48] now whatever you say Jesus will turn
[1:41:51] this situation around
[1:41:52] Martha declared our faith and I'ma tell
[1:41:55] you gonna need to be able to declare
[1:41:57] your faith in this hour
[1:41:59] no matter what you're going through a
[1:42:01] man marry on the on the opposite side
[1:42:06] had she could not shake herself from the
[1:42:10] environment that she was in marry even
[1:42:13] though Jesus was president Mary still a
[1:42:17] man stayed in this atmosphere of love
[1:42:20] you know and like I said it's okay
[1:42:23] they lost a brother it was okay to
[1:42:24] grieve nothing wrong with that amen
[1:42:27] but Jesus was not there just to visit
[1:42:30] Monson Mary when Jesus was showing up he
[1:42:33] was coming by a vision so so even though
[1:42:36] America not shake us up she was still
[1:42:39] required a mentor taking action before
[1:42:43] she saw the miracle I want to say that
[1:42:47] again you might find yourself in a
[1:42:50] situation where you can't shake yourself
[1:42:52] out of this and you can't shake yourself
[1:42:54] on that but before you experienced a
[1:42:57] miracle from Almighty God
[1:42:59] you must get involved you will take an
[1:43:02] action what was this action that the
[1:43:05] Lord Jesus Dave Martin Mary all these
[1:43:09] men around all these brothers around but
[1:43:12] I want you involved in this Mary and
[1:43:16] actually according to the vision you
[1:43:19] were involve I don't know if y'all
[1:43:23] getting that according to the vision
[1:43:25] that the angel had concerning you you
[1:43:29] were involved so God will allow some
[1:43:33] things to happen II say roll the stone
[1:43:35] away
[1:43:37] Jesus a roller stolen away and mob the
[1:43:40] mayor maybe look around it and everybody
[1:43:42] else said now why don't we get set up
[1:43:44] lying ain't tell him I want y'all I want
[1:43:48] you to put some action in this I know I
[1:43:50] know it's right it's probably very
[1:43:51] difficult for you to do this I mean
[1:43:53] you're probably looking at how frail
[1:43:55] your body is it
[1:43:56] I can't Road that big old stone but no
[1:43:58] you better find a way roll that's thrown
[1:44:00] away if you want to see a miracle roll

[1:48:48] sick in the atmosphere of the enemy she
[1:48:53] knew that there was a promise sitting in
[1:48:55] Scripture and residue look at the
[1:48:59] promise in saying why me she could say
[1:49:03] why not me rather than you looking at

[1:49:27] you sad it's gonna happen to me then be
[1:49:29] it up to me according to your word
[1:49:32] let's just let's read this amen about
[1:49:36] Mary here oh my my mind
[1:49:39] go to Luke 1 Luke 1 thank you Jesus
[1:49:43] look at look at this you know I was
[1:49:46] telling you that the transformation is
[1:49:48] actually taking place even right now
[1:49:50] while we're sitting here you might not
[1:49:52] realize it but you being transformed
[1:49:54] you've been transformed you don't have
[1:49:57] to feel it but I can tell you it's
[1:49:59] happening to you and the first thing
[1:50:01] that has to happen is God got to
[1:50:03] transform our thinking Oh glory to God
[1:50:07] God got a Gaga got to get us thinking
[1:50:09] the way his word has called us well I
[1:50:12] mean we we got to see ourselves the way
[1:50:15] the word since we are a man Church a man
[1:50:19] but look at this look at this and we
[1:50:21] know we can look at as we're getting
[1:50:24] ready for this we can look at Eve she
[1:50:27] didn't shake the enemy
[1:50:29] she didn't shake the enemy and she fell
[1:50:31] and now that's why we have all the
[1:50:33] problems that we have today because Eve
[1:50:34] Eve didn't then shaken and even we can
[1:50:37] look at Sarah and Sarah had a hard time
[1:50:39] shaking Sarah mixed some doubt in with
[1:50:42] everything she was doing too but she had
[1:50:43] already given a hand mate to Abraham and
[1:50:47] say have a son by her and that'll be the
[1:50:49] promised son that's not what God said
[1:50:51] said God say Sarah thy wife not your
[1:50:54] hand me don't give me the hand mate I
[1:50:56] want your wife and if Sarah's looking at
[1:51:00] her condition now I've never been able
[1:51:02] to bear children all these years I've
[1:51:04] never borne a child and and and at this
[1:51:07] age bad child come on she didn't know
[1:51:09] what God could do that's why he asked
[1:51:12] the question is anything Oh church
[1:51:17] that's why you asked the question is
[1:51:20] anything too hard for the Lord
[1:51:22] hallelujah not just changing Amen your
[1:51:27] body to be able to produce a child but
[1:51:29] he also changed them back to a young man
[1:51:31] and a young one
[1:51:33] Oh multiple changes occurred the change
[1:51:37] is happening right now I wish I wish
[1:51:40] that the Lord to help us really get that
[1:51:42] way multiple changes occurred hallelujah
[1:51:47] it wasn't just a change to have the baby
[1:51:50] but there was another change took place
[1:51:53] amen
[1:51:54] whether we're we're not she's looking
[1:51:56] like a young woman he's looking like a
[1:51:58] young man and what I'm trying to get you
[1:52:02] to cysts that you are being changed
[1:52:04] right now you were being changed and
[1:52:07] then when Abraham and Sarah saw me the
[1:52:09] change took place
[1:52:11] Abraham begin this is my sister
[1:52:13] hallelujah glory to God
[1:52:16] Oh hallelujah look at this now Sarah
[1:52:20] doubted a little bit a man but God still
[1:52:22] came around and visited her anyway
[1:52:24] I thank God for that because I see Sarah
[1:52:28] in the when we when we preach about
[1:52:31] women and script we got to think about
[1:52:32] the church because the church sometimes
[1:52:35] we doubt a little bit but now I could
[1:52:37] tell y'all right now someone's been
[1:52:39] doubting whether we gonna be changed or
[1:52:40] not but we shall be changed in the
[1:52:43] moment and the tweaked liver I you look
[1:52:45] at your trials and you look at your
[1:52:47] tribulations you look at your the
[1:52:48] stresses you look at your failures and
[1:52:50] you can't you just can't see yourself
[1:52:52] you looking at everything that devil
[1:52:53] wants you to look at but what I'm trying
[1:52:56] to just present to you a promise you're
[1:52:59] gonna be changed and this change is not
[1:53:02] based on anything you're doing I'm gonna
[1:53:07] try to show y'all this is this is why
[1:53:09] it's so important that the Spirit of God
[1:53:12] comes in the connects with the word
[1:53:15] because the change actually takes place
[1:53:18] by the Spirit that comes on the word so
[1:53:22] you realize when we come here a couple
[1:53:24] weeks ago and we just had this shout and
[1:53:27] good time everybody you know it caught
[1:53:29] that even now and that there was a
[1:53:31] change taking place there was a shift
[1:53:37] sometimes a certain work and come at a
[1:53:40] certain time it shifts the whole
[1:53:42] atmosphere not only did it shift the
[1:53:45] atmosphere but people throughout the
[1:53:46] week begin to recoat that even now you
[1:53:52] keep reminding yourself of God's promise
[1:53:54] no matter how bad your situation is see
[1:54:00] that that was Martha's face I noticed
[1:54:03] things look bad four days dead
[1:54:06] my brother stinks hallelujah but even
[1:54:11] now what have you asked God for I
[1:54:13] believe I believe you'll get it we got
[1:54:17] to come to that that's the faith that
[1:54:20] God is looking for in his believers your
[1:54:23] faith that will not be shook by
[1:54:25] circumstances or situations I think
[1:54:28] that's only moved by what God said let's
[1:54:31] read let's read because we're looking at
[1:54:33] we're looking at Mary now hallelujah
[1:54:36] Mary if I could put it this way was a
[1:54:41] part of a vision can I put it that way
[1:54:45] because there was a vision that God
[1:54:48] showed a prophet that our Virgin shall
[1:54:53] conceive and bear child I just begin to
[1:54:57] think all about the shalt bear with me
[1:54:58] today right but-but-but-but why didn't
[1:55:02] God get a virgin that was not married to
[1:55:05] any man because she was married to
[1:55:08] Joseph even though they had not had a a
[1:55:09] formal wedding the vows that's what
[1:55:11] married them hallelujah young young man
[1:55:16] young woman you're married to that young
[1:55:18] lady if you yeah I mean you know when
[1:55:21] y'all engaged y'all are married
[1:55:23] you're not supposedly touching each
[1:55:24] other hallelujah don't touch each other
[1:55:27] until you actually ghost go before the
[1:55:29] preacher
[1:55:30] a man search right but but in God's eyes
[1:55:34] you're married so if a young man or
[1:55:36] young woman give engaged a man God sees
[1:55:39] it as marriage
[1:55:40] you can't break that hallelujah that's
[1:55:43] why you better pray before you go
[1:55:45] through the engagement don't let some
[1:55:47] fellows set you up specially nowadays
[1:55:49] where they want to video everything and
[1:55:52] they got you on the video saying no you
[1:55:55] better tell them you better delete it
[1:55:56] and you bet my facebook live and you
[1:55:59] might get surprised god help us here
[1:56:05] Jesus but you know when women when we
[1:56:10] look when we look at these things they
[1:56:11] were already married God God elected to
[1:56:14] choose a man that was already married to
[1:56:16] a virgin and I thought to myself I said
[1:56:20] Lord you came down and and I and Joseph
[1:56:24] in discontent in this position I have to
[1:56:26] take Mary now Joseph thought to himself
[1:56:29] privately he's saying that because it
[1:56:31] was already a few years older to marry
[1:56:33] say it say I'm gonna put her away I'm
[1:56:35] not gonna I'm not gonna deal with this
[1:56:37] I'm not you know too much criticism I
[1:56:39] mean this is hard to believe you
[1:56:43] pregnant by what an angel said this an
[1:56:45] angel said dad and I'm pregnant
[1:56:47] marry that come on I mean how you expect
[1:56:51] me to believe something like this Mary
[1:56:53] Mary I'm sorry I just maybe something I
[1:56:57] said nah you know just so I know she
[1:56:58] telling you but I saw Mary with you know
[1:57:03] I John was I saw I saw I didn't want to
[1:57:06] tell you I don't want to tell you that
[1:57:08] Joseph but I saw John coming by and you
[1:57:13] can imagine what Joseph was going
[1:57:15] through this is what they tell me this
[1:57:17] were they they said this they said that
[1:57:19] you say it's something that's so
[1:57:20] far-fetched you know one of you I mean
[1:57:24] come on you're gonna blame it on God
[1:57:25] that God did this can your marriage and
[1:57:29] Joseph and I want to say this way
[1:57:32] because if you put yourself on the scene
[1:57:34] and you were a Joseph would you have
[1:57:37] been able to stand with Mary i'ma tell
[1:57:40] you what helped Joseph stand with
[1:57:42] marry when God did something
[1:57:45] supernatural to Joseph
[1:57:48] Oh stay with me here
[1:57:52] God gave Joseph a supernatural tree and
[1:57:57] say fear not to take unto you
[1:57:59] Mary's my wife but that which is
[1:58:02] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:05] now when Joseph had his personal
[1:58:09] experience with God there was nobody
[1:58:13] with any story that would be able to
[1:58:16] shake Joseph and what I'm here to tell
[1:58:20] you this morning you're going to need
[1:58:22] your personal experience with God no
[1:58:28] devil will be able to shake you
[1:58:31] no criticism will be able to shake you
[1:58:34] know love from the pits of hell will be
[1:58:38] able to shake you because you had your
[1:58:41] own personal experience I'm happy to see
[1:58:52] you but I won't God to do something from
[1:58:55] me to make me shout I'm happy to see you
[1:58:59] get the Holy Ghost but I want to receive
[1:59:01] the Holy Ghost glory to God amen what
[1:59:08] Saturday with Joseph what settle it for
[1:59:13] him was a personal experience
[1:59:16] see here you'd go around tell his dad
[1:59:18] and his mama's to look ya'll don't
[1:59:20] understand you didn't have the
[1:59:22] experience that I had
[1:59:24] you didn't hear from the aim to the way
[1:59:26] I heard from the engine I wasn't even
[1:59:28] looking for a dream but God told me fear
[1:59:31] not to take him to me marry my wife that
[1:59:34] was just because conceived in her is of
[1:59:36] the Holy Ghost the language that the
[1:59:40] Angels use was the same language that
[1:59:43] Mary was sharing and it was very easy
[1:59:46] for them to connect lord have mercy
[1:59:54] Mary was a part of a vision a prophet it
[2:00:00] already spoke that you know Mary not
[2:00:04] even know he'd actually didn't use
[2:00:05] Mary's name let me let me go back he
[2:00:08] didn't use Mary's anybody say a virgin
[2:00:10] shall conceive not only have a prophet
[2:00:13] already spoke God God spoke way back in
[2:00:23] the Garden of Eden when Eve fail God
[2:00:28] spoke and he said he said oh let us read
[2:00:33] this James it's 3:15 oh my oh god help
[2:00:38] me Lord Jesus
[2:00:39] y'all just bear with me today I thought
[2:00:43] I was gonna go a particular direction in
[2:00:44] God's God's in just slow down slow down
[2:00:47] slow down here Jeff James it's 3:15 this
[2:00:49] is where God speaks this was this was
[2:00:51] after Eve had failed not a punishment so
[2:00:55] being dished out glory to God and it
[2:00:58] says and I will put enmity between thee
[2:01:02] and the woman and between thy seed and
[2:01:06] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[2:01:08] thou shalt bruise his heel now we know a
[2:01:12] men according to a man test the way our
[2:01:15] bodies are designed a woman does not
[2:01:17] carries a seat it's the man that carries
[2:01:20] the seed a man the woman cares the
[2:01:23] the man carries the sperm seat right so
[2:01:25] so so here the God himself says that
[2:01:30] Vasi said I put in between thee and the
[2:01:33] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[2:01:35] this was speaking of the coming of the
[2:01:37] Lord Jesus this was speaking of the
[2:01:39] virgin birth when he said her seed so
[2:01:44] here God himself has prophesied this is
[2:01:48] a vision Isiah picks it up and in a
[2:01:56] sense of urgency I can see this just
[2:01:59] making more clarity to the vision and
[2:02:03] the reason I keep preach this because I
[2:02:05] want to bring more clarity to 20/20 we
[2:02:13] got to get ourselves in a rapture
[2:02:15] condition haha I don't know about you
[2:02:18] but I don't want to stay here I'm
[2:02:22] looking forward to one year being my
[2:02:23] last year I thank God for everything
[2:02:27] that he has done for me and I know some
[2:02:29] of the other people say Lord don't let
[2:02:31] him come before I get married be careful
[2:02:36] what you pray for
[2:02:36] amen after you get married you might be
[2:02:39] her Lord let the Raptor Conine
[2:02:44] some stuff you start going through a
[2:02:47] whole lot even so come Lord Jesus
[2:02:53] amen but by here-here-here this vision
[2:02:58] that God has given us in genesis 3:15
[2:03:01] and i'm saying nine amen speaks to this
[2:03:04] and and now we pick it up over Luke
[2:03:06] because Mary has to step into the vision
[2:03:13] catch it catch it and then step into it
[2:03:19] do something with it after you catch it
[2:03:22] Luke whirling twenty-five
[2:03:25] I mean 26 says and in the six month the
[2:03:30] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto the
[2:03:34] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[2:03:38] virgin a spouse so she was already
[2:03:40] engaged a virgin espoused to a man whose
[2:03:43] name was Joseph of the house of David
[2:03:46] and the Virgin's name was Mary and the
[2:03:50] angel came unto her my God my God my God
[2:03:55] see all this individual stuff that an
[2:03:58] angel did come to her and Joseph the
[2:04:02] angel came to her and she had to be the
[2:04:05] one to take what the angel said and go
[2:04:07] back out and tell cani cani cani tapes
[2:04:11] it's gonna be up to you to start
[2:04:14] testifying about yourself
[2:04:17] glory to God you testified your own
[2:04:20] personal experience listen he says and
[2:04:22] the angel came in unto her and said
[2:04:25] he'll that are highly favored the Lord
[2:04:30] is with thee blessed art thou among
[2:04:34] women now what kind of worse is this do
[2:04:38] y'all remember Mary was was a young lady
[2:04:42] she lost her father at an early age
[2:04:45] her mother was actually buried for years
[2:04:48] and when Mayor was born you know they
[2:04:52] were hoping for a boy but God given Mary
[2:04:54] now you can imagine because I know some
[2:04:56] households I'm gonna scan I just seen
[2:05:01] some house walls will tell their
[2:05:03] children you a mistake
[2:05:05] I wasn't expecting you I went looking
[2:05:10] for you huh
[2:05:12] and that's a shame for some how to tell
[2:05:15] that to a child right I mean if God give
[2:05:18] you that that's what you'll get
[2:05:20] God gave me three girls I would have
[2:05:22] loved some boys I got girls and I love
[2:05:25] my girls when I get old and really great
[2:05:30] I believe in girls to be there for me if
[2:05:32] I have some boys in my dad sing you
[2:05:36] twenty dollars or something but God God
[2:05:39] give you them girls for a reason
[2:05:42] hallelujah
[2:05:43] it pull out certain qualities in you you
[2:05:46] got the answer sir as a father I don't
[2:05:48] care how tough I am a man I gotta get
[2:05:50] soft I'm talking to girls with a boy it
[2:05:54] might be able to grab them buy a shirt
[2:05:56] Colin boy did not say but a girl no no
[2:06:00] no no no you never told all that God
[2:06:06] know how to balance things over in our
[2:06:08] lives and then you got a tip a problem
[2:06:10] got to give you a girl
[2:06:11] whoo praise the Lord in your heart even
[2:06:16] if mama got a typical problem gotta give
[2:06:19] our girl

[2:06:28] delicate with that amen look boy you

[2:06:33] now you got a girl you have to learn
[2:06:35] some patience God know how to do things
[2:06:48] but Mary could have looked at her life
[2:06:51] and said now I have my highly favorite I
[2:06:54] lost my daddy when he was young I mean
[2:06:56] when I was young I mean I I don't even
[2:06:59] know if I'm supposed to be here how you
[2:07:01] gonna say I'm highly favored just being
[2:07:03] me and my mama and now I'm getting
[2:07:04] married to Joseph and and Joseph is a
[2:07:06] lot of years older than Mary I want to
[2:07:09] say almost 20 years older than Mary
[2:07:11] right man Joseph's already got a family
[2:07:13] his
[2:07:14] I've passed away and now he's getting
[2:07:16] connected with Mary hallelujah hi Mary
[2:07:19] you know now I'm stepping into a
[2:07:20] situation where I'ma be kind of like a
[2:07:22] step mama and these kids are probably
[2:07:24] just as old as me I won't try to get the
[2:07:28] whole story look at what she did think
[2:07:32] about what you'll be dealing with now
[2:07:35] looking at marriage a highly favored
[2:07:40] Karen can I put it this way for you cuz
[2:07:43] you're doing 90 now you wit me in the
[2:07:45] midst of your trial right now highly
[2:07:50] favored look at this when she saw him
[2:08:15] she was troubled at his singing and
[2:08:17] casting her mind
[2:08:18] what manner of salutation this should be
[2:08:23] now I'm glad that she only said it in
[2:08:26] her mind see Sarah was the type of woman
[2:08:29] that will laugh and then lie about it
[2:08:38] so we got all these different characters
[2:08:39] in Scripture and and somewhere here you
[2:08:42] gonna find yourself but here Mary just
[2:08:46] said in the mind what kind of salutation
[2:08:48] is this ain't nobody ever said it like
[2:08:49] this to me it says and the angel said
[2:08:52] unto her fear not Mary now he had to
[2:08:57] call her name there's any time person
[2:08:59] hear a name it just kind of wait a
[2:09:01] minute it loosens you up a little bit
[2:09:03] this person knows me amen hallelujah
[2:09:06] fear not Mary for thou hast found favour
[2:09:09] with God they behold thou shalt conceive
[2:09:16] in thy womb what wait a minute and bring
[2:09:21] forth a son and shall call his name
[2:09:23] Jesus he shall be great and shall be
[2:09:27] called the son of the highest and the
[2:09:29] Lord God shall give unto him the throne
[2:09:32] of his father David oh this just
[2:09:35] beginners just Minister them to Mary
[2:09:37] what maybe she even thinking I'm not
[2:09:40] even from the royal lineage I don't I
[2:09:42] mean what is all this
[2:09:43] how's this gonna happen so just don't
[2:09:45] worry about it watch this watch it he
[2:09:46] says it says and he shall reign over the
[2:09:49] house of Jacob forever and of his
[2:09:50] kingdom there shall be no end then said
[2:09:53] Mary unto the angel how shall this be
[2:09:56] seeing I know not man I know you just
[2:10:04] gave me a promise but how is this gonna
[2:10:07] come to pass
[2:10:08] I'm a virgin and I'm supposed to
[2:10:11] conceive in my Emma I don't know a man
[2:10:14] cause it's gonna be me and Joseph not
[2:10:16] scheduled to be married until
[2:10:17] such-and-such a time
[2:10:18] how shall this be there's a legitimate
[2:10:23] question but this is where I want you
[2:10:26] all to see because what I say we being
[2:10:29] change Mary receive her pregnancy from
[2:10:36] her response
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:45] let me put it Mary received her
[2:10:48] pregnancy from her response to the
[2:10:52] promise I want to say that again no
[2:10:59] sensation no emotion never felt anything
[2:11:09] but yet pregnant and when I'm when a
[2:11:16] woman is pregnant she's going through
[2:11:18] changes and here today you might be
[2:11:22] sitting here not feeling anything you
[2:11:25] might be having mind battle after my
[2:11:28] battle because some of the stuff you're
[2:11:29] going through hallelujah but even though
[2:11:32] you don't feel nothing something is
[2:11:34] still happening and I'm gonna tell you
[2:11:39] at some point in time spirit and truth
[2:11:41] go catch the vision and they go step
[2:11:45] into it look at the scripture because
[2:11:51] she got a legitimate question how shall
[2:11:54] this be seeing I know not a man watch
[2:11:58] this and the angel answered a seven her
[2:12:01] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is what's
[2:12:07] going to produce this that's why we want
[2:12:09] to preach the Holy Ghost we've need mo
[2:12:11] Holy Ghost we can never have enough Holy
[2:12:15] Ghost I'm gonna tell you I come to
[2:12:17] church every room every Sunday looking
[2:12:19] for the Holy Ghost they're just pouring
[2:12:21] out in here because it's the Holy Ghost
[2:12:24] what is he like can i connect can I tell
[2:12:27] y'all something the Holy Ghost is not
[2:12:28] just coming to give you a shout the Holy
[2:12:32] Ghost is not just coming to give you a
[2:12:34] scream the Holy Ghost is not just coming
[2:12:37] to give you an emotion now it's no
[2:12:39] problem for you to have any motion but I
[2:12:41] want you to understand the Holy Ghost is
[2:12:43] coming to actually make the promise that
[2:12:47] God gave you come to pass
[2:12:52] the holy that's what he is here for sir
[2:12:58] is here to make the promise that God
[2:13:01] gave you come to pass yeah who made the
[2:13:11] promise come to pass in Mary the Holy
[2:13:13] Ghost shall overshadow you I'll just I'm
[2:13:20] gonna just keep reading Oh God watch
[2:13:24] this watch this
[2:13:26] the angel answered and said to her the
[2:13:28] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[2:13:33] power of the highest shall overshadow
[2:13:35] thee therefore also that holy thing
[2:13:40] which shall be born of thee shall we
[2:13:44] call the Son of God now this has just
[2:13:50] got Mary all messed up and I never even
[2:13:53] heard terms like this the Holy Ghost
[2:13:55] Church I go to tenean preaching about no
[2:13:58] Holy Ghost what is this so then the
[2:14:01] angel had to go love father in order for
[2:14:04] her to catch the vision and hear the
[2:14:08] angel says and behold my cousin
[2:14:11] Elizabeth she has also conceived a son
[2:14:17] in her old age and this is the sixth
[2:14:22] month with her who was cold barren
[2:14:28] they can't call it that no more after I
[2:14:31] have a child so you can call me that
[2:14:33] before I had ceiling but after I have a
[2:14:36] child you can't call me barren no more
[2:14:39] call me mama didn't angel with a little
[2:14:47] further this is just an aunt of faith
[2:14:51] but with God
[2:15:00] it sounds like the same words have you
[2:15:02] told Sara is anything too hard for he
[2:15:07] didn't get an answer back then but this
[2:15:09] time he was not gonna even ask a
[2:15:11] question he was gonna make a statement
[2:15:14] and I'm here to make a statement to you
[2:15:17] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[2:15:25] I'll talk about with God now if you try
[2:15:27] to do this without God it's gonna be
[2:15:29] impossible but with God nothing shall be
[2:15:34] impossible now finally after these words
[2:15:42] Mary done caught the vision and look at
[2:15:46] what Mary does she steps into the vision
[2:15:50] look at this mercy and Mary said see
[2:15:54] this this good God looking for you to
[2:15:56] speak some things it's got to come out
[2:15:59] of your mouth
[2:16:00] hallelujah somebody and Mary said Behold
[2:16:05] the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me I
[2:16:11] make this promise I know I come up with
[2:16:14] this I didn't pray for this I didn't act
[2:16:16] for this I want I want just keeping
[2:16:19] myself so I can bear Christ that was my
[2:16:21] purpose I knew it was the right thing

[2:16:27] God because you've been doing the right
[2:16:29] thing well behold the handmaid of the

[2:19:42] glory to God and I'm so glad that when
[2:19:44] God looks at two accountants bet over
[2:19:46] and over in in Romans for I believe it
[2:19:49] was he even talked about Sarah laughing
[2:19:50] and all that and and we saw Abraham
[2:19:53] Downton but he never even considered it

[2:20:15] Abraham buy that woman God said so will
[2:20:20] you tell me well you told me that 25
[2:20:22] years ago I know but God says so that's
[2:20:25] it there you are that's the same thing
[2:20:27] what you do what what do you say today
[2:20:30] well you know the denomination will kick
[2:20:33] you out but God says so God said so well
[2:20:35] you know if you get baptized like that
[2:20:37] well God said so that's it that's it
[2:20:39] there's your virgin there she is not
[2:20:41] only to baptism but anything else the
[2:20:44] rest the word see anything God promised
[2:20:49] you you can have now let me read this
[2:20:51] message I just love the way God do
[2:20:54] things this is gonna come from them it's
[2:20:56] a quote from the message called the
[2:20:58] confident I love the way God does things
[2:21:00] I didn't I didn't even connect this
[2:21:03] myself but the Holy Spirit just did it
[2:21:05] because he told Mary the angel told Mary
[2:21:09] that the Holy Spirit which is the
[2:21:11] comforter it's going to overshadow you
[2:21:14] and cause this promise to come to pass I
[2:21:17] want to tell you all this morning it's
[2:21:19] gonna be the Holy Ghost that's gonna
[2:21:20] cause to promise to come to pass where
[2:21:23] you catch the vision and step into it
[2:21:25] I'm talking about all God got for you I
[2:21:27] got I got I got
[2:21:29] I got some things and I'm gonna be
[2:21:31] sharing and I just pray God will help us
[2:21:34] church if I can just encourage you spend
[2:21:37] some time with the Lord that way when
[2:21:40] you come to church you you count already
[2:21:42] listen be listening to tapes throughout
[2:21:44] the week you might happen to catch a
[2:21:47] tape that I might read a quote from
[2:21:49] write and then it make it much easier to
[2:21:51] preach it makes it much easier and
[2:21:55] everybody else kind of already in that
[2:21:57] and in a channel but if you if you are
[2:22:00] in the channel of the things where I'm
[2:22:01] not up here talking about no football no
[2:22:02] basketball I'm not coming to church to
[2:22:05] talk about that
[2:22:05] I'm not we're not here for that alright
[2:22:08] I mean some of y'all get so excited you
[2:22:11] start to talk about things in the world
[2:22:12] movies and that's that's fine it's all
[2:22:16] fine but make sure you prepare for
[2:22:18] church a man a man Church I'm telling
[2:22:25] you God God is trying to elevate our
[2:22:27] thought process here the conception has
[2:22:31] to happen in your mind Mary moved away
[2:22:37] all my own battles
[2:22:39] Martha moved away all mine battles now
[2:22:42] mother said Jesus here and in the merit
[2:22:45] probably sitting in the house he he'll
[2:22:48] be here soon
[2:22:49] Martha just wait for him no I'm calling
[2:22:50] to Jesus I'm not waiting for him to come
[2:22:53] he's in terror what if he don't come
[2:22:55] here I know you I know I'm going I'm
[2:22:59] gonna find where he then I could see
[2:23:02] Martha's it now if you want to sit here
[2:23:04] you sit here and she had can i'ma tell
[2:23:08] you something when Martha left she left
[2:23:10] by herself
[2:23:14] but if I'm a sadist without offending
[2:23:17] nobody if you want to sit in certain
[2:23:19] atmospheres there are people that will
[2:23:21] join you and they will help create the
[2:23:26] atmosphere around you for you to stay
[2:23:28] there but if you want to see something
[2:23:33] different you're gonna have to do
[2:23:35] something different and Martha gelled up
[2:23:38] and did something different yes this
[2:23:41] this is a perfect time for me to be
[2:23:45] morning perfect time but Jesus is here
[2:23:50] Jesus is here and since Jesus is here
[2:23:54] I'm gonna shake myself from the
[2:23:57] atmosphere that I'm in and I'm going to
[2:24:00] Jesus the tarp in because he's the only
[2:24:02] one that can do something about it
[2:24:04] one day we're gonna recognize that Jesus
[2:24:08] is still here
[2:24:10] I like this statement now I'm gonna read
[2:24:18] this and I pray it don't go over your
[2:24:20] head watch what the prophecy in this
[2:24:22] message the comforter there it is and
[2:24:28] how long he's going to buy forever then
[2:24:32] what is the Word of God
[2:24:34] what is our comfort today is when we
[2:24:43] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:45] and the power of the Living God living
[2:24:49] in us your comfort is receiving the
[2:24:52] baptism the Holy Ghost amen
[2:24:55] watch this what's this and that's and
[2:25:00] that's with the word of the Living God
[2:25:03] we stand that words may flesh and dwelt
[2:25:07] among us now that was in Jesus that the
[2:25:10] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:25:11] now watch this
[2:25:13] now that same word that was made flesh
[2:25:17] and dwelt among us has become
[2:25:29] anybody still waiting on a change I
[2:25:33] tried to tell you it's already happening
[2:25:37] the Prophet said that word the same word
[2:25:42] that was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:25:44] has become our flesh who felt it when it
[2:25:49] happened who thought that wouldn't
[2:25:54] happen but me when I heard that I had to
[2:25:58] rewind because in my spirit I say be it
[2:26:01] unto me according to that word we're not
[2:26:06] waiting it's here and once we catch it
[2:26:12] we don't step into it and there'll be a
[2:26:14] we're different we'll talk different
[2:26:17] we'll walk different everything will be
[2:26:19] will see different everything will be
[2:26:21] different
[2:26:21] once we catch this and step into it look
[2:26:24] at this that same word that was made
[2:26:27] flesh and dwelt among us has become our
[2:26:31] flesh he is with you now but he shall be
[2:26:38] in you now that same word that the
[2:26:43] Prophet spoke that same word that was
[2:26:45] made flesh that same word dwells in the
[2:26:50] church therefore if we don't compromise
[2:26:54] that word we stay right with it if we
[2:26:57] don't compromise it that same word
[2:26:59] living in you will produce the same
[2:27:04] thing that it did when he was made flesh
[2:27:06] because your flesh whose it
[2:27:19] my my flesh is a mess that's the devil's
[2:27:24] lie where God just told you is your
[2:27:28] flesh is holding his promise dude do you
[2:27:34] realize that Mary Joseph's wife her
[2:27:38] flesh was the flesh that God chose to
[2:27:42] reproduce himself through her flesh
[2:27:45] every issue in her body every cell in
[2:27:50] her body was holding that promise with
[2:27:59] her angel to you holding this promise
[2:28:38] God God God God's promise cannot be
[2:28:41] fulfilled and let's have found some
[2:28:44] flesh to dwelling I'm not gonna be like
[2:28:50] Sarah laughing that promises I'm not
[2:28:55] gonna be like Eve compromising with the
[2:28:57] words but I'm gonna be like Mary be done
[2:29:02] to me according to thy words I love this
[2:29:08] your your flesh I'm read that again that
[2:29:14] same word living in you were produced
[2:29:18] the same thing that it did when he was
[2:29:21] made flesh because your flesh holds it
[2:29:25] that's the reason visions can break
[2:29:28] through
[2:29:29] the sound barrier that's the reason a
[2:29:36] may set a revision can break through the
[2:29:38] sound barriers and say let's say at the
[2:29:41] Lord it shall be so and so and that's
[2:29:44] the way it is what is it it's the word
[2:29:47] coming forth from a spirit church I am
[2:29:53] I'm just under expectation
[2:29:57] I just I just I'm looking for God that
[2:30:00] just do some some mighty things mighty
[2:30:06] things we got to catch the vision let's
[2:30:12] be like Mary Mary caught this it was
[2:30:17] things that she had never heard before
[2:30:18] and maybe you know some of the quotes
[2:30:21] that God might give us like this quote I
[2:30:22] just read I don't think I ever caught
[2:30:24] them I just happened to be listening
[2:30:25] this weekend you know brother Branham
[2:30:28] preached this at a time that he was
[2:30:29] going through his momma was very ill
[2:30:31] didn't know when mama was giving me to
[2:30:33] be call home to go to the Lord and said
[2:30:35] Lord and told me if Mama's leave and
[2:30:37] brother Branham made a statement says
[2:30:39] until God tell me that he'd taken her
[2:30:41] I'm gonna hold on and believe that God
[2:30:43] got healing that's what he said God
[2:30:46] didn't tell me God and she say maybe
[2:30:47] Guardian told him because he don't want
[2:30:49] me to be worried there's some things
[2:30:52] that he just didn't he don't show his
[2:30:54] prophets everything he said but he ain't
[2:30:56] told me say but but until God he say I
[2:30:58] know the doctors say this and and the
[2:30:59] nurses say that and they say she getting
[2:31:01] worse and worse but God didn't say she
[2:31:03] leaving so imma just hold on I said man
[2:31:05] if a prophet get standing there like
[2:31:06] that what about us we got to have that
[2:31:09] same kind of faith and if God decided to
[2:31:12] take it take take it and God did it took
[2:31:14] his mama home he kept on going but why
[2:31:16] he was in the midst of that trial he
[2:31:17] preached this message the comforter and
[2:31:20] he dropped that he dropped that nugget
[2:31:22] off the words that became flesh has now
[2:31:26] become our flesh change is taking place
[2:31:33] now there be a final change where these
[2:31:37] bodies will not be held by gravity
[2:31:38] anymore and we're looking forward to
[2:31:40] that but I'm letting you know right now
[2:31:41] change is happening
[2:31:42] now you've been transformed right now
[2:31:45] the Word of God is doing it and the
[2:31:48] Spirit of God comes too quick in the
[2:31:49] word and makes it even more real so when
[2:31:52] you pray and you got your prayer journal
[2:31:54] put that put on the top of your prayer
[2:31:57] journal God released your spirit into
[2:32:00] the midst of this church now I'm gonna
[2:32:03] tell you one way to stop the spirit from
[2:32:05] flowing
[2:32:06] zyne so whatever we do keep sin out of
[2:32:12] the church I started off by saying this
[2:32:15] and I'm gonna say it again this is a
[2:32:17] spiritual hospital so we love for people
[2:32:20] to come that might be dealing with some
[2:32:21] sin conditions but the objective is not
[2:32:24] for you to stay in that condition that's
[2:32:28] not the objective when you go to a
[2:32:30] natural hospital look they trying to get
[2:32:32] you out of there they welcome you come
[2:32:34] on in
[2:32:35] once they diagnose what you got knotti

[2:32:49] understand come on we need the altar for
[2:32:54] other people you keep coming how many
[2:33:08] spirits you got all right and I'm not
[2:33:13] saying that the block can't stop you
[2:33:14] from coming to the altar but I am saying
[2:33:16] that look you need to get free and stay
[2:33:19] free praise the Lord Amen get serious
[2:33:22] about this it's time for a checkup God
