say there's a storm out on the ocean and it's moving this old way but if your soul is not Anchored In Jesus you're surely D before um these we we live in Hurricane Alley just by living in Florida that's that's uh not I don't call it a benefit but that's just that's just part of Florida and people ask how can you live there well they tell us it's coming so we get time to prepare and all kind of things you know and uh you know and most of the ones that that that get hit the hardest are the ones that are unprepared amen but uh we I know that school will be closed and um they're they are predicting that it's going to come uh Tuesday night uh Wednesday morning type thing and we'll still be feeling some effects they said on Thursday but before the storm comes what I like to do is read over the congregation the word of the Lord amen and we want to read from Psalm 91 amen uh before this would uh give us um before it passes through let's just put it that way Psalm 91 the scripture says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the nois and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that fth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come not thee amen um so um verse 8 uh Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high by habitation there shall no evil be thee neither shall any plague Come N thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and Adder the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he haveth known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him and I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation amen the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word the rain came [Music] wind oh I safe with you I'm going to make you through yes I came when blue for my house is built on you and I'm safe with you I'm going to make it come on one more time came oh safe with you I'm going to make Christ is Christ is my firm foundation on reach stand everything the around me Shen never that I put my faith Jesus let me Generations he fa he won't anybody believe that if you want he won't fa he won't fa he won't come on put those hands together for the Lord Jesus my God my God he won't fail he has never failed me yet he's never fail me yet blessed be the name of the Lord amen I also want to thank God for bringing our precious brothers and sisters that went to Puerto Rico he brought them back home safely amen we thank the Lord for that we thank the Lord for that amen you all stand with me we read our scripture for today thank you musicians appreciate you all so much amen uh here in the Book of Joel oh brother tril so good to see you brother tril God bless you amen as we read the word of the Lord here in the Book of Joel uh chapter 1 and verse four uh that which the Palmer worm had left hath the locus eaten in that which the Locust have left have the can worm eaten in that which the cankerworm had left had the caterpillar eaten over to chapter 2 and verse 21 um the scripture declares uh fear not oh lamb be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid you beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month that's that's a that's a serious rainfall and and you got to watch the the language of the scripture they had it moderately and uh I don't I just I'm trying to get to certain places in this sermon but I I know the prophet was telling people he was telling the denominational churches you you did have a a a a l of ring you did I'm not doubting that and the Bible say you going to have it moderately but God want to do something much much much more than than what we experienced in Pentecost sir God got greater plans than that oh my amen cuz when when you get a double ring let Lord have mercy that's what that's actually you know created some of the problems up there up north they got a double rain in the in the natural and that's what created some of the flooding they had already had rain then the storm came and dropped some more rain that that created all of that but when you get a double rain my God spiritually I'm telling you the truth and and and I'm going keep reading but I'm going to let y'all know again this scripture we're reading is for this day yes sir is for where we living at this is your scripture Joel was prophesying about you that's right and I I I I'm let me just Fe finish reading here my god um it says and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil that stimulation of Revelation and it's supposed to be an overflow you leave church drunk on the stimulation of no not a feeling not an emotion but the stimulation of a revelation sir man I ain't never seen that before W boy I tell you God is good sir and and and and and and here's the here's the verse right here and I will restore to you the Years cuz this is the restoration message let me K now I I'll talk about it I'll restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palom worm and my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied this why I'm not looking for nothing outside the message I'm satisfied and I'm eating in plenty right it say you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God who have dealt wondrous with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and and none else and my people should never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon you you just happen to be in church on the right day and your sons and your daughters amen shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions you know and a dream correctly interpreted right is is a vision all right if it's correctly interpreted right so uh here it is says and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come right and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for Mount Zion and Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call let's pray quickly father we thank you for uh the anointing that is already in this place your spirit father has welcomed us here uh this morning and God we are asking that you would help us to get ourselves out of the way that you would have the preeminence and this portion of the service that the spirit of God would just take complete control of every thought that is presented as well as every thought that has been received we uh also want to remember a family who was lost a loved one um our sister Rebecca her brother-in-law has passed and uh asked that you would just uh be with this family oh God there's a wife left some children left and God they are really really uh suffering uh right now so we just ask that you would just cover them that you would uh uh be their strength Lord during this during this great time uh it's not easy to lose loved ones God but we we know that you are comforter and we ask that you bring Comfort even now father it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated praise the Lord uh our journey continues with get back and step amen and um you know as I was just in prayer this morning um the Lord just really began to I think um just open my understanding how how much more this scripture that we're reading is actually for our day and just even the just the language where Joel prophesies I'll restore to you the years the restoration did not take place in the days of John the Baptist amen John the Baptist was introducing uh the Lord Jesus and um you know his ministry was a very important Ministry because it introduced the first coming of Christ and when you when the disciples came to the Lord Jesus and they after the mount Transfiguration they begin to ask him like now didn't they say that Elias was supposed to first come and uh and do some things he said yeah yeah yeah I and I say to you Elias has already come and they did to him what they what they was what they were supposed to do he says but I also say that Elias will come and he will restore all things so just that very statement from the Lord Jesus that the restoration actually occurs amen when that second Elijah comes because his ministry is to restore all things and I'm here to tell you this morning that Elijah has already come and gone but his ministry was the restoration Ministry Hallelujah and with it being the restoration Ministry these scriptures pertain to this time because this is the restoration time yes sir all right all right all right so all I all I want to just say is that everything God promised me I want it everything God promised me so let me um let's go back and just uh re re re uh mention in some things that we talked about last week and then we'll go forward amen um in in in this I want to start with I read this quote last week in questions and answers on Genesis and I uh I shorten it a little bit just to kind of make it quick uh brother Brandon makes a statement speaking in tongues is a Divine gift of God which belongs in the church praise the Lord I'm going say that again speaking in tongues is a Divine gift of God which belongs in the church just the same today as it was back there in the beginning and and I'm I'm I'm I'm reiterating that because anyone try to take it out is doing us a disservice amen it belongs in the Church of God now watch these statements that he makes it says uh that's exactly the truth yes indeed he that's the Bible teaching is a Divine gift and you deny that just the same as you deny the new birth you deny everything that Jesus taught when you Tred to cut that out Hallelujah so we ain't trying to cut it out we're trying to include it yes sir okay he says now here's the other statement now you can go wild on that many of them have now I'm I'm I'm I'm not going to read the rest of that you know the rest rest of this is um um we read it last week but but I I'll I'll just say this what what what we did last week was try to bring the balance on how the gifts are supposed to operate and when when he say that they've gone wild on it what happens in in the average Pentecostal church today there's a lot of speaking in tongues I mean um uh uh in the song service speaking in tongues when the preacher preaching speaking in tongues after he preaching speaking in tongues and at the altar call speaking in tongues when I meet you outside speaking in tongues huh if I see you at the grocery store and walking down the aisle picking up some cereal speaking in tongues I mean it it they go W with it this is what the prophet T they've gone wild with these things right you know and and and and and the other thought that I have here let me just kind of present this you know uh there was a a time brother Brandon went and he went to a service and my there was a powerful anointing Amen in in the church that day and uh and and and before the message came forth there was a brother stepped up and he start I think there was tongue spoken then the brothers uh uh gave an interpretation and he told her sister thus sayith the Lord you will not die now that lady had already been told by the prophet get your house in order you going to die now because they spoke in tongues amen because they got anointed and and and and and this is again go wild with it this this man say thus said the Lord you ain't going to die sister so uh so after this Goes Forth brother Brandon comes out he preaches I mean a powerful anointed choosing of a rde is a is a sermon and he preaches and in that sermon he prophesies about Los s Angeles going under the water Hallelujah afterwards amen he goes out and his son is just walking with him and and and and and and having a conversation say daddy you told me to always respect the gifts and he say he says yes son that's exactly right you know I want you to always respect those gifts and you know um remember that one last week uh let all things be done and decent and and also it told us in 1 Corinthians 14 uh covet prophecy but forbid not to speak in tongues that's that Paul said that in the Bible forbid not don't don't cut that out he said yeah I always tell you to respect he says but daddy this man you saw the anointing that was in the church oh Hallelujah daddy you saw the anointing that was in the church but but this man just got up and prophesied that uh that that she not going to die and you told me to always respect the said yeah yeah yeah I told you to respect the gifts ohoo Lord have mercy and he said I know he got up and prophesied I know there was anointing in the church he said but God ain't told me nothing different I'mma tell you something you have to stand on the word even with gifts you got to be able to stand on the word don't get so caught up on a gift that it leads you away from the word amen hallelujah oh I I I I I there's some things that I I I I I want to say and I I have to be careful sometimes because we're on a live stream but but I I'm going tell y'all this i i i people have sent me testimonies of of different ones a young lady went to a church a Pentecost Church message believer went to a Pentecost church had a prayer meeting during the prayer meeting she actually started speaking in tongues this young lady the the the the the the message girl at the Pentecost Church started speaking in tongues and then also gave an interpretation of her tongues praise the Lord in a Pentecostal church now that's something and so there was there was really really floored by what was going on it was just what she said in her in her interpretation that most of them would not have no idea what what she said but I know and interpretation was uh push play just push play just push play now if you heard something like that go forth that's you know wait a minute that's not lining up with the Bible that ain't lineing up with the Bible I am we just played a tape on Friday yeah right I mean I ain't got no problem with that but we here's the problem when you say just push play or only push play that's where the problem cuz you just cut out the whole fivefold Ministry so if something you can speak in tongues and you can and you can interpret but if that interpretation don't line up with the Worden on huh y'all going to let me talk just for a little bit you remember brother Bram you know he was he was uh uh ministering and after he pre teer brother walked up to him and said he said that could be the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation and when he shook his hand the man took off in tongues Hallelujah church and when he when he start speaking in tongues amen after he finished three people showed up see that don't need no interpretation that was perfect friends one was a are you an interpreter and like yeah that was perfect FR brother Bram said don't y'all say another word say I want you to go to this corner and you go to that corner you go and write down what you heard him say cuz in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word has got to be established and when they all came back together every word was exactly the same oh my God it was pure French but when brother brandom got it he began to take that because because the the the the interpretation was um you the decision that you made you've made the right decision he say this is my DEC this is my SCE it said because you've done this this in itself will make and make and bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine brother random say he he said he went back and start searching the scripture he said Moses made choices and the choice that he made brought tremendous victory in his life and different ones that he can look like that made choice and as a prophet he had to know he made the right choice come on as the bride of Christ you got to know that you've made the right choice and when you know you made the right choice it will bring it will make and bring to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine see so even with gifts we don't want them to go wow see we watching everything if if somebody tells me a dream I'm looking to see how that dream connected with scripture if I can't see scripture flowing through that dream I'll just put it to the side thank you for your dream I don't see nothing nothing not yet I have to wait for God to show me something but I don't see but I just be listening to key words to see how the scriptures tied into the dream yes sir oh my God my God all right Church brother brandom told us that even Jesus Christ himself spoke in tongues and we picked that up in in Mark 541 this is where we see the Lord Jesus um speaking in tongues amen the Bible says he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her ttha Kumai which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise so this is if if our lord Jesus did it I I showed you last week that our Prophet did it amen this is something that belongs in the church sir it's a Divine gift of God that belongs in the church First Corinthians 14 just gives us instruction on how to keep this lined up amen we we in 1 Corinthians 14 the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets we've taught that amen the scripture tells us to covet prophecy and forbid not to speak in tongues uh we simply need to keep it in order the scripture advises let everything all things be done in decently and in order and and also what what we found out in 1 Corinthians 14 when you're speaking in tongues in public this is the this is the when I when I say in public in a public setting like in the church uh let me just I want to make it clear in a a public set we in we here in church today and man you that anointing was great this morning is it still great it's still great and and and you and when you come to church and you have an atmosphere like that especially after a preaching word you know a gift could go forward you not that you going to make it go forward but but it can happen but knowing how to handle it when it does happen right so so brother Bram told say if you know if we're publicly like this I I'm sorry the scripture Paul tells us this it says um it Tong should be by two or or at most by three and let let let let let them interpret right let one interpret so so uh if you get an anointing like that we know if a if tongues go forth it should be only two or at most three not four people five people six people that's where it goes wow right but two or at most three that's what the Bible declares yes sir right so we just trying to line things up with the word now now here's the other thing uh that's in 1 Corinthians 14 I want to pull up this verse verse 13 amen uh as we just try to continue to move forward we're keeping these things in order in line and here here's here's what the Bible say wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret if God actually gives you the tongue then you also got to pray God either give me the interpretation or give somebody else the interpretation and in this congregation because we got to have the interpretation and here's the other thing I read for you if we do it in order the prophet said like he told his sister he said sister you just let it go at the wrong time I know God was working on but if you would come back at the end of ser if the Spirit come back on you do it then and I guarantee I guarantee there will be an interpretation if the prophet can guarantee that Hallelujah because we got things in order with the word of God I believe the same thing in here if we keep it in line with the scripture I guarantee God will do exactly what he said he would do because this is the season this is the time for these things to occur amen this is the restoration message yes sir come on I mean you know I'm believing God for your family and I'm believing God for your money but restoration go beyond your family and your money yes sir truth and now now we now now we talk about the blessings in the in the upper Springs it's blessings in the nether Springs that's that's what you dealing with down here on the Earth but there's blessings in the upper Springs and you know what they've been taken out of the church now we got to preach it right back into the church and the more we preach it the more under expectation we become amen we're looking for God to do exactly what he promised that he would do let me uh go on to this sermon a super sign amen super sign here brother Brandon makes a statement it says now notice and and let me let me also just kind of clarify something really quick because I know it just when I'm quoting scripture and I'm quoting from God's Prophet brother brandom he was God's Prophet sit here in this generation to fulfill scripture amen not just a prophet just because somebody rise up and say they a prophet no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a prophet like unto Moses I'm talking about a prophet like unto John the Baptist I'm talking about a prophet that had I mean John the Baptist was supposed to come and fulfill the introduction of Christ at his first coming God had a second prophet that would come and restore all things Jesus spoke about it and and brother brandom happened to be the one that fulfilled that amen all right and and born right during the time of the uh Assa Street Revival glory to God born right during that time let us know that there was a fourth stage that this restoration the sou Street was not the end of it it was part of it but it wasn't the end of it and then there was then then what had to come was the word which is what we're talking about this morning the word had to come and and if we can't take the word but still want to take the gifts we had a problem stay with me here if we if we can't take the word but want to take the gift we got a problem so watch this now I'm going to read here you know from what God's Prophet tells he says notice now they took all the Holy Spirit out of the church and made a holy man the the solemnity from the church on a holy man conquered it that went through for that great denomination of Catholicism that's what the pope is okay rule the Earth for aund and and hundreds and hundreds of years there come forth a reformer Luther and as soon as Luther died they organized it and the vine dried up and the husbandman pruned it where did it go it's dead lutherans are dead now now this is this is not anything uh new uh if you just go around to the average Lutheran Church nowadays they selling them the average Lutheran Church they're being sold because the people are no longer there amen and Luther was a reformer but but it's moved on from that hallelujah oh my God help us when we when we when we get to here because we we're going to see something and and um even though it moved on from that there was there is I'm going to talk about this a little bit later brother Ram said there was three seeds that were sewn three seeds and he said Billy Graham had a seed or Robert had a seed and then he said the word seed now here's what happen when seeds are sewn they need rain and when you get rain seeds come forth Hallelujah and whatever was swn is actually going to be coming up out of the ground so whatever Billy Graham sold sold and he's no longer here right and whatever he sold going to be coming up and it is coming up I'm going tell youall what he sold is coming up in the mega churches right that's right that's what Billy Graham sold and that's what the me mega churches are are are are reaping uh or Robert sold a Pentecostal seed right and and the Pentecostal seed is coming up my God and and if I could just be with y'all the Pentecostal seat got away from the word they had the gifts but it got away from the word even the man that was sowing the seed before he passed away he told everybody that Jesus a 900 foot Jesus Oh Lord a 900 foot Jesus told him if he did not get the money from the people God was going to take him home that's right well he went home yes sir and I'm not picking at him but I'm just saying there is no 900 foot Jesus and anybody come tell you that in order to scare you to get money out your pocket something's wrong with them but this is what happened with the Pentecost so see when the church when they leader go into things like that what you think the rest of them going to do sir but there was there was another one there was a Billy Graham and a or Roberts and he said there were two angels that went down into Sodom and blinded the people blinded them with the gospel yes sir they couldn't even see the truth anymore oh Lord have mercy blinding them with with these great great great big moves and and movements and and all kind of things blind blinded the people they could not recognize the true word of God Amen and brother Brandon say now notice just like Abraham had uh h m at the end of his name he says notice Graham g r a hm God was using this ministry Hallelujah said God using all Robert's Ministry and he say he says but there was one that stayed behind with the bride sewing the word seed the one that stayed with Abraham and and and and Sarah come on somebody and he just always say there was one stay with him but he would never say that there was another one by the name of h m cuz he say Graham g r a h a m six letters but he would never say brandom b r a n h a m seven letters never would say that we had to be the ones to catch it that's right let me keep reading let me keep reading Hallelujah I'm so glad we caught it all right since that went through that that went through for that great denomination Catholicism Ruled the Earth for hundreds and hundreds of years there come forth a reformer Luther as soon as Luther died they organized it and a Vine DED up and the husband pruned it where did it go isad head showed me where it Ever Raised after Luther's Revival it died he says alone came after that John Wesley the next stage amen and this is the part of the restoration when God sent Luther that was the first part of the restoration John Wesley was the second part of the restoration my God when he sent the Pentecost that was a third part of restoration and the fourth is the word itself coming back to us look at this now it says uh John West the next day see the great man of God that preach sanctification what happened what happened as soon as Wesley and the ashberry and them died uh ashberry and them died they organized and made a church out of it and God the husband pruned the branches off and it died tell me where they where where they ever had another Revival now you know somebody would read this quote and then they would go back to a little event that happened here I think in the past couple years where some people were at a college and I think it was Asberry college and and it's the truth hello and the prophet say it died now if you if you look at a little history at this college a few years ago young people was coming from everywhere and they were just having worship service after worship service after worship and they say we having Revival with worship services oh my God my God but if you saw how the people was dressed going to church they went to church one way and came out the same way no no this ain't the same type of Revival something wrong with this revival I mean I'm talking about when when brother went to Africa come on somebody amen without even preaching anything without saying nothing just preaching the word but when the spirit of God came down the sisters that were inside the service breastfeeding their children a very natural thing for them to do breastfeed their children when they when they felt that presence the next service they came back covered amen we need a holy ghost that'll make you change the way you dress that's right we need a holy ghost that to make you change the way you talk we need a holy ghost that'll make you change the way you live yes sir hey it's not just a holy ghost that give you a tongue speaking and an interpretation we need something that change it from the inside it'll make you love your neighbor Hallelujah it'll give you patience it'll give you virtue and Temperance godliness and brotherly kindness cap you off with Charity that's the Holy Ghost we talking about the same spirit that was in Jesus we need that see brother and and if you notice that that that it it started and everybody mean news was tearing it like crazy everybody thought they saw that man something something happening you know your mess like ain't nothing happening there and all I got to do to look at one they had it even in in Florida here a few years ago I mean and and some guy up in the Panhandle area doing and people just I was I was uh driving home from somewhere I don't know where it was maybe in like South Carolina stopped somewhere to get something to eat and and this little couple sitting next to the table say we coming from Florida I say well we live in Florida or y'all we coming from the Revival and I'm looking at y'all what Revival what what what got revived what actually got revived you you know what a Revival does anybody we've been taught what Revival does yes sir Revival washes the trash house Hallelujah you still got trash in your life you ain't in Revival that's the my God you just hanging around the Revival you ain't in Revival though it's one thing to be in Revival yourself or just hanging around the Revival I want to be in the Revival not just in the Revival I want to be able to tell people you looking for the Revival you found it sir I am the [Applause] Revival that's right here you know brother brother brandom tells us this you know he says the husband pruned the branches off it died tell me where they ever had another Revival says then Along come Pentecost with the restoration of the gift what happened uh what happened to the power the P what happened to it the power of God was poured out again Lord this what we're looking for the Holy Ghost what did they do organize it together again now when you talk about organizing it this is when the Pentecostal Church tells you that the only way you can receive the Holy Ghost is that you must speak in tongues and and when he said they going while I remember we had a young couple um come to church years ago not here but you know previous church and they told me they was going to a church and and they was praying tering for the Holy Ghost they was praying and and the people got in there telling them say you know look you got to act like an appliance in your house when the Holy Ghost come you need to act like an appliance to your house so act like a washing machine or act like a blender or act like I'm where is this in the Bible right where where is this in the Bible where did dides Jesus tell them to do that on the day of Pentecost no no no no no no we this is where things go wild we don't we not doing none of that amen amen you know uh my God my God my God you know I believe the scripture says you know as soon as they believe the Holy Ghost fell on them just believe the word follow this word and it it's going to happen suddenly I'm telling y'all that right now it's going to happen probably the time that you're least expecting it on a sermon that you least expected to come on oh my see we we the way that we got in our mind it's going to be a fiery sermon is going to be this we all going to be worked up in our emotions and no God don't do things like that he he he come in quiet still simple and and there it is hallelujah he'll surprise you amen and and as I saying publicly this you know this is the way things supposed to be done public but now he also told us that uh if you got gifted people he says get them into a room together before the service starts now there's no limit when we get them into a room together Hallelujah right it's not just two or three whatever God does in that midst amen we take that and we and we we record it yes sir amen amen we record it cuz you give a word and then it don't come to pass then we have to have a conversation with you now we're not going to take your gift from you praise the lord we just want to make sure that this is God and this why you need Witnesses you need judges people that got the right Spirit to judge whether that came from God or not exactly judges sign their name to it it don't work out we go back to the judges now hey you sign your name look we we just don't want this to go wow so that's why we're coming to you make sure that you know that this is God can you see that in the word if you can't see it in the word don't sign your name to it all right let me go on I'm coming I'm coming here um he says there then come then Along come Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts what happened to it the power God was poured out again the Holy Ghost what did they do organize it together again begin to separate Brotherhood and what happened God just cut it off that's right and I gave y'all the history of the the the the Church of God in Christ versus the Assemblies of God that that's what brother Rand talk about they separated Brotherhood after the Susa Street okay it says oh but God did say I will restore that's right have y'all I know y'all you weren't living here but in history you know Luther's day is already coming gone that's right you know Wesley's day is already coming gone you weren't living in 1906 when when the Souza Street happened but you've heard about it you know that has come and gone so that scripture of restoration wasn't for those time periods that scripture belongs in our day right amen I love this I will restore sayth the Lord the that Seed where is the life of it right in the center of the tree runs the lifeline not these branches falling off this way the life is right in the center of the tree God promised no matter how much the suckers came on on it like like the Palmer worms eating up and sucking up and things like that I'm going to restore saeth the Lord amen when that trees com into top just as sure as I'm standing here when the people of God will unite themselves together those differences difference of denominations and they'll come to the life of God and there'll be a pouring out of the Holy Holy Ghost that'll bring the fruit of the spirit back into the church again it'll be a super sign now huh that's going to be a super sign when we see God pour out his Spirit amongst a group of people that have lined themselves up with the word of God and let me tell you something when when cuz here we got to know what's been planted yes sir cuz when the rain come it actually only Waters the seed that has been planted yes sir oh I know what we planted here hallelujah I know exactly what we planted Here Am amen we we we we planted Brotherly Love sir we we planted the love of God here huh we we' planted these things you know there's a let me let me catch this scripture here because I I told you all about the the fruits that's on the tree God planted a tree turn uh go with me to Second Peter 1 God planted a tree at Pentecost and when he planted his tree at Pentecost he expected fruit from the tree sir and the fruit that God was expecting was first amen he said the nine spiritual gifts so God's looking for these fruit he's looking for the the the word of wisdom in the church he's looking for the word of knowledge to be in the church he's looking for Faith to be in the church he's looking for the gifts of healing in the church he's looking for the working of miracles in the church he's looking for prophecy in his church he's looking for the Discerning of spirits in his church he's looking for divers kinds of tongues in his church he's looking for an interpretation of tongues this should be coming off God's tree it's his tree he planted it these are his fruit yes sir amen amen the other thing that's on this tree is the fruits of the spirit he's looking for love he's looking for Joy he's looking for peace he's looking for longsuffering he's looking for gentleness he's looking for goodness not meanness goodness amen he's looking for Faith he's looking for meekness and he's looking for temperance my my my those are the fruits of the spirit and now also we're going to find out here that he's looking for Seven Virtues coming off this tree and we find them in second Peter 1: 3-10 we know what God is expecting off his tree sir hello somebody you can't be speaking in tones in here and then mad as I don't know what when you leave here huh brother Bram say you can't be like that I mean walk right by your sister and you know you see her acting like you in in the spirit that much no you in the wrong spirit that's what you in come on now you can't do that and call yourself a holy ghost filed Christian that's not the fruit that we want to see I know what we've been planting here yes sir am we want the genuine Holy Ghost amen my God you want to do that there's Pentecostal churches that let you do that all day long amen but we want the real thing all right all right church here we we we lining it up we lining it up according to the word here second Peter amen uh chapter 1 verse three says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue the first uh ver the first uh virtue that you're supposed to have is faith and then you add to that virtue which is strength powerful service add to your faith virtue add to Virtue knowledge knowledge of the word of God that when I just what I just mentioned to y'all about this person uh uh Pro uh speaking in tongues interpreting but then saying amen the interpretation didn't line up with with the rest of the word and I appreciate the gift but it ain't lining up with the word I'm not I'mma just like like brother Brandon told Billy just respect it I respect gifts but I'm not following nothing that that's going to lead me away from the word I'm telling you that right now I'm going stay with this word and I'm I'm going tell you another thing God will God will actually allow somebody to say something to see what you going to do are you going to stay with the word or you going to go with this oh my god look here I know what I'm talking about you people get all twisted up because of [Applause] personalities sir but if they leading you from the word don't don't follow that don't go with that stay with the word oh my God my God oh Lord help us Jesus brother brandom tell us that the pastor there to to keep the church lined up right he say something something rise up don't take sides with it some come up don't take sze with just stay stay with your pastor that what the prophet stay with your pastor and if I could to say like this people don't let other folk become their Pastor amen and I'mma say it again other folk have become your pastor amen amen all right I know what I'm talking about okay amen amen amen you you know in the Bible um they got so far away from the go God in the Old Testament here they they had priests but they wouldn't go to the priest and use the priest so these people actually took money and and start building their own Gods and then they raised up one one little lady rais up her son to be her priest I'mma raise up my son to be my Priest No god going to give you one amen you don't raise up your own oh Lord have mercy y'all know the word right he said he he gave Apostles and Prophets and teachers and pastors he gave not you raise up your own preacher amen my Lord Lord have mercy Jesus all right let me let me let me keep reading I'm I'm I'm all over the place uh verse 5 it says this and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance patience and the patience godance into godance brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness Charities look these are the things God want to see on his tree you you you you can't be blessing and cursing out the same mouth I'm speaking in tongues today and then I'm cursing somebody out tomorrow you and you cursing people out at the church that that's what's happening out there that's what's happening and I know they ain't happening here we don't even use that language you don't use it at church you don't use it at home and you you don't use it on the job you don't use it in school you don't use that [Music] language can I Lord this song this the the the the Two Sisters wrote uh and and I almost cuss oh yeah yeah and you know uh oh yeah I need a little more Jesus no you don't you need a lot more Jesus if you almost you almost slipped and cuss you you need a lot more Jesus Oh Lord I'm all out here father Kirk Franklin spoil every concert every CD every every DVD if Kurt Franklin is on it it is spoil that man need need more God than anybody I know and brother brandom actually told us what we got nowadays is demons demonic spirits are impersonating Christians and they let you know they not Christians people record them they own children record how they treat it at home and they release it to you and no y'all it's time for us to kind of take take it back you know enough is enough and and and and the more money they get the more support they get the the more they feel like they can just kind of keep doing it enough is enough anytime he's involved we got a problem I'm telling you and he got so much money that he controlling a lot of these other people say all kind of ungodly stuff and then we as Christians supposed to just just buy this no brother enough is enough the gospel industry is is is it is it's gone it's gone it ain't it ain't gospel no more amen amen let me try to get back to this oh my so uh to Godless brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be bearen nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind cannot see a far off and ha forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore to to uh wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall this is this is this is critical God want to see these Seven Virtues on this tree God want to see the gifts I mean the fruit of the spirit on his tree God want to see the spiritual gifts on his tree this is God's tree and when God plants his tree the fruit come forth in his season I'm going to say that again the fruit they are God's fruit that come forth in his season his fruit come forth in his season season and when when brother Brandon breaks that down he says that's God fruit coming forth in the prophet season the prophet has come the prophet is gone but since we're still under the anointing of what that Prophet said this is still the prophet's [Music] season so we know what to look for on the tree Blasphemous names I want to read from there oh God Blasphemous names now brother Brandon preach the sermon a statute of a perfect man and then after the statue of perfect man he preaches Blasphemous names why is that important because often times a minister could could get started down the thought then he just man he he got so much left that he just didn't get a chance to say and the next sermon comes up now he goes back and he says some of those things so Blasphemous names he brings out some of this now when he preaches Blasphemous names his his main thought here is that what are the Blasphemous names what are they and notice that blasphemous names or names of blasphemy what are they he said Baptist Lutheran Pentecostal Episcopalian Evangelical anything that's off the word even if it's off by one little Iota it's a Blasphemous name watch it now he preaches this he says now I shun saying this a few days ago thinking that the church would be spiritual enough to catch it and maybe I better turn this tape off right now cuz I don't want it to get out amongst Brethren but you could speak with tongues you could shout you could dance you could cast out Devils do anything you want to and still not have the Holy Ghost it says then them disciples back there uh come back rejoicing and shouting because the Devils were subject unto them it says and it says and right among them was Judas right look at that now it says did not Jesus say in that day when he come that many will come uh to me and say Lord have not I cast out devils and in your name done Mighty works and I say depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you these things are not indications of the Holy Spirit but what's the indication by their fruit fruits what are the fruit coming off this tree by their fruits ye shall know them not by the manifestation but by the fruit what life are they living after they manifesting gifts yes sir amen if the quickest way to discard your testimony is to have a horrible life nobody want to hear from you if I was just up here preaching and then going out living any kind of way you wouldn't want to hear from me Lord I'm I I I I know the prophet say he a like calling names I know the prophet said he didn't like calling names and I know I just called some names I know I did but sometimes you have to do it in order to help the people not to hurt the people but there is a major preacher was CAU at a P didy party H how does that happen right right Pentecostal preacher P did and they finally caught up with this fell I'm just talking today y'all but they finally caught up with this fell and and now everything getting ready to come out and and all these there was seeds swn three seeds yes sir there was a denomination seed through Billy Graham there was another one through or Roberts and brother Brandon say them two seeds GNA come together and they've already done it yeah oh Lord I can there's a lot I can say here but they've already done it sir and he said but there's a third seed a word seed right exactly right but how and and and and and look if if you are watching that preacher if you watching that preacher I don't know what you're getting but I I tell you what you're getting you get spirits on you cuz if a holy ghost preacher speaking in tongues don't see nothing wrong with going to a p didy party and dancing at the party drinking dancing what and you don't see nothing wrong with that I I couldn't even go to my cousin house I just tried to go to my cousin house they was there they wanted to have a family get together and they invited like look y'all don't never come I I ain't I ain't been here in a while I don't even see this the family I'mma go over here and just just you know come on I went for about an hour they said Con fritters I was eating them con fritters I'm telling you I was waiting on but before I know it somebody done done pulled out a joint and uh and I'm starting to look around and and some of the people and they see us the way we dressed and there they know something different about us but but soon as I got the last com of I went run to my car I didn't even say goodbye to nobody my wife said you didn't even say by to your family I'm sorry I could not say bye I'm ready to go the Holy Ghost in me say you can't stay around here you can't hang out in atmospheres like this and the Holy Ghost to me said if they going to do that again you ain't going you solded your face and that'll last you about 15 20 [Applause] years but a a major preacher get right back in the church just speaking in tongue just like like it ain't nothing and you just come from P party what you got to preach and you weren't going there to get P saved right you w don't even give us that that one now I was going to witness to him pray over him pray Lord Church Jesus and we listen to stuff like this I mean sometime we put this on before we even put the profit on we we stand around and listen to him oh man he said this he said this did they and it just and and cuz cuz you want your business to be blessed and you want and you want you want to hear something uh uh uh inspirational or something uh what do they call it motivational cuz that's what they are they motivational preachers you want you want to hear that and and no no long as Don't Preach against my sin I'm I'm good with that but motivational preaching is going to get me all day he said this he said that but he just came from P did his party no no no no stay where the Prophet said praise God we we're not here to motivate you we here we here to tell you what God is looking for out of your life the tree of your life these are the fruit that he want to see in your life amen look at look at this now oh my my God and and and I'm going to go to a church like that and and have and have confidence in gifts I ain't going to have no confidence in no gifts at all in there especially if it's coming from a head like that all right it's the truth anyhow yes it is yes it this he said this right among them was Judas did not Jesus say in that day when he come that many will come to me and say Lord have not I cast out devils and in your name done Mighty works and I'll say depart from me ye workers of iniquity I did know you those things are not indications of the Holy Spirit by their fruit ye shall know them now you say brother Brandon should we speak with tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God I I want to I want to make sure we got that you you you if you're operating in gifts without these virtues in you it's not even being accepted by God and when you realize that Lord I my patience running thin oh Lord y'all going to let me talk for a little bit y'all know how y'all patience get I'm going just talk with me you got all kind of patience God bless you Pastor God bless you appreciate you Pastor but then when you get in the car yeah your wife don't feel that same kind of patience your children don't feel that same kind of patience but the Saints in the church feel it all but somehow your family don't feel it you become a different person when you get with them by theirself and how your family going to have confidence in your gift Lord and you just treated them like that come on now dog running from you cat running from you everybody afraid of you but you get to the job hey boss how you doing you know and yeah everything well no no no no everything ain't well hello we need to straighten these things up at home the Revival start in the home praise God we get these things cleaned up at the house and then it's easy to come to church and you don't bring no weight to church and your and your family ain't bring in weight to church what same thing with the sister your husband does he recognize your Holy Ghost right and he see how you treat the pastor and and treat all the other Saints but then him oo Lord get in there and cook for yourself I'm retired what I'm hungry amen it's the truth any high but we we'll we'll throw down some other folk come into the house some other family members come to the house throw down they be talking about how good it was but your husband when ain't nobody there am I preaching yet giving him hot dogs and Roman ramen noodles and hello somebody but you throw down for everybody else but he you retired when it come to him we I'm talking about a real Holy Ghost y'all I I we don't want to play play Holy Ghost no more we want the real thing yes sir amen amen Church all right all right all right all right you you make a stumbling block to other folk when you do things like this amen amen amen praise God he says but those gifts of God without those virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever is not accepted by God this oh I love this statement this has to be first and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love then the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit as same as he seals the church ages as a unit now I want to clarify just something with that statement because people taking that quote and say you don't even have the Holy Ghost until uh you got all these virtues in you that's what they teach that you don't even have the Holy Ghost until you got the virtues because the Holy Ghost come down and seal you as a unit but understand now before you can add Faith before you can add add virtue before you can add knowledge and Temperance and patience godl brotherly kindness and love before you can do any of that you got to be born again yes sir and if you are born again then that mean the Holy Ghost is on the foundation the Holy Ghost got to change you so you can add these things and all all brother brand I'm saying is at the end of it this is what completes the person see and and it's like you a seal going on both sides on the on the on the bottom and on the top it's a a holy ghost on the bottom holy ghost on the top seal yes sir and Holy Ghost on the inside uhuh amen amen praise God Amen all right all right I I hope that made sense you can't add cuz if you adding this without having the Holy Ghost then brother brandom says it's like a uh a peacock no no no he says it's like a blackbird trying to add peacock feathers to it you can't a black bird like a crow can't add peacock feathers and spread them and like look how beautiful I am that those not real feathers they not they not Originals uh-huh that's it you weren born with that and the reason we got to be born again is so that we can be born with this yes sir born with these virtues amen because without it you're not going to you're going to have you're going to have less patience you're going have less love you have um less godliness hello somebody amen Lord have mercy this just so much to preach it just it it's it's a lot it's a lot y'all but I I'mma just do the best I can amen we trying to be like God that's what godlin is all about it's like being like Jesus in my dress I want to be like Jesus in my talk I want to be like Jesus in my walk I want to be like Jesus am all right let me go on it says this the Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a unit as same as he seals the church a ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way where he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from the side he here is the things that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them they've got to be God sent and God born imitation only causes confusion and we don't you ought to say Lord I don't want to be a stumbling block I want to be a stepping stone but I don't want to be a stumbling block to nobody amen not my wife not my husband not my not not nobody in my family I don't want to be a stumbling block I want to help them praise God it's like I said could you imagine seeing a buzzit sitting there with with a dove feather stuck in his wings say see I'm a dove he's not a Dove he's a buzzard a vulture and and and let me let me tell you how you can know that he's a vulture even though he got he done stuck these Dove feathers in him how you know he vulture you let something die and be sitting on the side of the road them Dove feathers will show if he hanging out on the side of the road next to something that's dead you know there's something wrong here sir amen and a dove don't eat that kind of stuff praise God Amen could you imagine a black bird with peacock feather and his wings saying that's something that he's stuck in but it has to come from the inside out glory and and produces Christianity God by the power of the holy spirit all right I was supposed to just quickly go through these things and I get on to where I was trying to go to but here we are again Amen Let me just tell you uh this what did Pentecost have for us to be restored back to it I talked about this I didn't finish it but I'll just talk about it again they had Oneness they had they were one in mind and they were in one Accord and the proma worm is what destroyed the brotherly love so we want to see that come back into church I told you I know what's been planted in this church so I know what to expect to come forth it says brother uh the scripture tells us that they had a a a a a Russian Mighty Wind it was a sudden wind a sudden sound it was like a wind and brother brother Solomon came and said how it was a tape that you can go back and listen to and in the building as brother Brown's preaching they can actually on the tape you can actually hear the wind coming into and then the voice of God speaking back out to the people through the wind amen amen amen amen amen uh he says uh the scripture tells that and I love this they were all filled with the Holy Holy Ghost that's what happened on the day of Pentecost everybody in the house was filled with the Holy Ghost uh they spoke in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance this means everybody might not speak in tongues that's okay you got your gift just do what God called you to do and don't get jealous of nobody else that got a gift the gift of tongues you might have the gift of wisdom you might have the gift of knowledge do what God told call you to do amen right he said the other thing about Pentecost is the miracle of it is that the people understood in their native languages now I I I made this comment last week because we have multiple languages represented right here in our congregation we got English we got Creole we got Spanish we got Shona we got Africans we got twe we got all these languages and um and I and I shared a couple quotes with you how brother brandham was speaking in English in a prayer line and this young girl that spoke Spanish heard him she said and she told The Interpreter said I thought you said this man couldn't speak Spanish and they played the tape back he was speaking English but she heard everything he said in her native language of Spanish and he speaking English that's what happened on the day of Pentecost right also I showed you how brother brandham uh was in his hotel room and couldn't leave he start praying he said he heard somebody talking outside the room like who's this talking not it was him he was actually praying in German for a woman that was actually on the way to the meeting to be prayed for and she was a German woman he interceded in her language and didn't even know what he was doing yes sir as I was sharing at the brothers came and and told say brother Jack you all are familiar with AI if you're not it's it's all over the place artificial intelligence is is is all I thought I thought when I was in school this guy told me about this artificial intelligent I'm like man that ain't that ain't going to be happening he was right the teacher was right but this artificial intelligence is really it's it's it's it's there's a lot that people can do that are great things with it there's a lot of bad things that people can do sometimes you go to church a preacher has actually given given you a AI sermon and you don't even know it AI could I could I could type in AI right now just certain things about this message it'll give me quotes and scriptures for me to just come preach to you now let let me tell you something if you get a preacher that went to AI but never went to God you got a problem on your hands right and and and just so watch just just be careful kids are using it to cheat in school children are using it to cheat on their assignments in school all kind of things uh uh uh on the job maybe you have an assignment to write uh in school you got you use AI put this in there you got it oh I'm turning this in uh-huh people people can people people can tell that you done use your AI cuz you don't write like that that's right Lord I'm out here now ai been using a lot of lot of my my my daughter they they decided to put a picture on on on a former job of her they said what does she look like and they ask he what she looked like and they came back with a picture of my daughter and they had her with some lipstick and some earrings and and everything and she and she like that ain't me I ain't never look like that one day in my life she had to tell the boss please take this down AI got me wrong if you want a picture I give you a picture but don't use ai ai ai ai is a very dangerous technology it can be very helpful and very dangerous at the same time y they were telling me that AI they're using they're trying to use AI so that I can be here preaching in English but somebody else in their native language could actually hear what I'm saying in their native language not not just the the Google translate thing cuz Google translate like and I have a a a employee she she only speaks Spanish so what I do is I always go to translate and I type you know what I'm typing I put it in English and I translate to Spanish then I send it off to her and she do the same thing to me and that's how we communicate through through through through Google translate and I mean beautiful it helps me right but they trying to get it where even a video live video now you now I I want you to understand what they're trying to do is exactly what I'm preaching to you that happened on the day of Pentecost now and from so so from a intellectual perspective AI is trying to go to the same spot that God trying to restore us to now here's the other thing if they can do that with technology they got it from they got it from the scripture cuz this happened in the scripture first right so if they can do that with technology then how much more should we be looking forward to seeing these things spiritually sir amen amen God can do it am that's right and and I'm not saying God can do it I'm saying he already done it when you read the book of Acts this is what happened on the day of Pentecost when it all came in one mind and one Accord God began to do things like this in their midst it it it it was almost Pentecost if I can say it like this almost produced a before uh Tower Babel condition yeah because it was at the Tower of Babel that they lost control of the languages only because they was doing it their way and not God's way right sir but before before uh them rod and all them got going what they were doing they actually spoke the same language right oh my my my my my my my and where did that start back in the Garden of Eden so this restoration takes us all the way back Church I don't know about you I'm looking forward to all of this amen here's some other things amen that that that that Pentecost did um I'm going read this in in in uh give me um Acts 2 verse 13 and then um couple other things I want to say uh the other thing that that Pentecost produced that that we want to get back to Pentecost produced the correct revelation of baptism how we're supposed to be baptized we're not supposed to be baptized in in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the father he is the son he is the Holy Ghost It produced the correct revelation of baptism amen nobody in the Bible was ever baptized under Father Son and the Holy Ghost everybody was baptized uh in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the other thing that happened in in in in Pentecost people continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine in Fellowship uh breaking of bread amen and in prayers remember if we going to see this happen we got to be what uh praying church and when we see God do it we got to keep praying amen amen amen other thing in Pentecost Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles praise God and here's another thing that happened at Pentecost the Lord added to the church daily such as would be Sav because in in in in in in Mount Zion there would be Deliverance if there is someone that needed Deliverance there was going to be some Deliverance for them if they wanted salvation there was going to be salvation for them these are the things that happen and these this is what we're looking for here let me read this scripture acts 2113-21 uh and then I'll close here today um this what we're reading is simply fulfillment or a portion of the Fulfillment from Joel's prophecy that we read in Joel chapter 2 here Acts 2 verse 13 oh my all right says this um others mocking said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and at and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and I'm telling you when Peter identified this experience on the day of Pentecost as a prophecy that Joel spoke about we going to stand up and say the exact same thing Peter said no we not we're not drunken as you suppose but this is that that was spoken by Joel and then explained by brother brandham look at this he says but but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days pluralized that's why it says not just for the P Pentecost itself this is for last days hallelujah saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handm mates I will pour out in those days my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and and and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness in the Moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come now you know um the wonders in the heaven wonders in the heavens uh let me just throw this out there I have never seen in all my life so many articles on aelis Borealis the northern lights and I mean people that live in in places in in in the world where they get a chance to see them all the time certain times of year is it's almost nothing to them but I mean just a few months ago they showed up in in in Fort Lauderdale I wish I would have been there to see them but now they tracking it in every I mean it's like like a uh something happening in the atmosphere where they just showing up everywhere right and uh so so we hearing a lot about the signs these are signs in the heavens when you when you hear about the blood moons these These are signs that the scriptures talking about and they've been tracking this like they they can tell you when the next blood moon going to Happ happen Church don't miss these signs watch it now the sun shall be turned in the darkness and the Moon in the blood before the great notable day of the Lord to come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be save I tell you the truth what they had at Pentecost is what we're looking for God to do this is what he planted and these are the fruit that we're looking for from his tree that he planted I got one last statement a quote from paman church age and I'm done those of you that are gifted Prophet gives us some advice he says just always keep humble always keep humble now everyone in the church has something to do everybody you got to find what you're supposed to do and then and when you find what you're supposed to do do it everyone in the church has something to do but don't never pull it aside for something else don't do that let it blend in with the rest of the church if you see somebody gifted pulling their gift to the side and and and and doing all that something wrong with them uh no well I don't I don't I don't really do this in the church but if you come to my house you know we just Fellowship a little bit together maybe the Lord will show me something but how come your gift don't never go forth in the church it the Lord don't really want me to do it like that is that right is that right but maybe you got an ulterior objective oh Lord have mercy I'm going to say some things brother random said for the young sisters if you always saw young sister hanging with a old sister y'all I'm out here not he say something wrong say why is that young sister hanging with that old sister all the time like that say something wrong he said maybe she got some candy that she giving her like he say like a little girl hanging with Grandma if you see a little girl hanging with Grandma they say they don't have nothing in comma common so why is that girl hanging with Grandma all the time I mean as a little girl she want to hang with people her age hello somebody amen and Grandma want to hang with people grandma can't even talk to her the little girl like that but she said maybe maybe grandma got some candy it's it's a reason why a young girl will hang with a older lady it's a reason why the older lady want that young girl to hang with her hello church I'm I'm just telling you what the prophet said so when you see things you like wait a minute amen this ain't right no matter what no matter what this this ain't right amen you know my kids they I believe they enjoy hanging with us sometime but they don't want to be with us all the time now I enjoy hanging with them but I don't want to be with them all the time church amen this is just real life right but when you see something like that you got to question that wait all see you here I see you there see no something ain't right something ain't right I don't care what y'all say I don't care how spiritual y'all trying to make this thing something Ain right Lord have mercy all right you know these seeds got to be swn so that the church don't get all cuz you know you have somebody get a gift and next thing they're pulling you to the side they doing all no we ain't doing that around here we ain't doing that around here thank God we got deacons that can help us out if if there was a youth Fellowship man I want one of my deacons to be involved in that uhoh yeah if the church ain't putting it on you putting it on at your house get one of the deacons to come that way stuff don't start at your house trying to build your own kingdom no don't don't let stuff start up at your house like that no no no keep the devil out of things you you got all these church people coming over there get a deacon there to keep things in order all right right yes sir amen I'm not talking just you and a little family y'all get together but now when you I got four or five families coming over what y'all doing we just eating barbecue okay you might you might do that one time we had a good time next thing you're doing it again next thing you're doing it again and you're doing it again and now y'all events conflicting with the church events uhoh hello somebody something wrong somewhere I'mma finish reading this quote and I'm coming on that I I tell you the truth I'm unloading everything I don't know I didn't't even know I had all this in me to unload but God knows he just always keep humble right everyone in the church has something to do don't never pull it aside for something else let it blend in with the rest to the church is for God all things see see don't everybody don't everybody now don't everybody want to speak with tongues and don't everybody want to interpret try to do something good and just just keep being good see interpretation is not just you coming up with something off your mind no it's it's it's it's you know God has kind of giving this to you and I got to say it cuz see I'm going to tell you again we we sign when we get gifts together in the room and I just Lord Lord had us moving in that direction right before we moved here to this this place the devil tried to cut us off but you know what God Said I will restored we getting ready to walk into our own building and all this going to be in operation but you know what God got to do before we get to the building got to get us lined up that's right so we don't mishandle things when we get into the building we don't go off into chaos amen I mean it's going to be so normal and so natural it's going to happen so often that you're going I don't want to say that you're going to get used to it because brother random never got used to when the angel came it always did something to him and I want us to always feel that reverence of God when he comes down but I I want to be where you're not alarmed that you expect God to do what he promised that he gonna do right let me let me finish don't everybody want to speak with tongues everybody interpret try to do something good and just keep being good whole No Malice no grudges you know when when I read things like this if you know you got a grudge against somebody why not try to get with them say you know what I done had this thing against you and I know ain't nothing but the devil I'm sorry hold no you holding that Grudge yourself you don't have to hold it you choose to hold no grudges you know when you hold things like that it creates sickness in your body hold no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and how bad they talk about you don't you never think evil in your heart against them cuz right there the devil will set right in and not only set right in work up something right there just keep it all covered up with Godly love confession and making right and do good to those who do evil to you if you only do good to those who do good to you why Jesus said don't the publicans the same see the Sinners anybody can be good to those that that's good to them but be good to those who are not good to you do something for those buy him a present give him a gift card now if I start getting a whole bunch of gift cards do something for those who who uh that would not do nothing for you speak a good word for the man that would speak evil against you and that way you keep all the the bitterness out of your heart and you're always in love with everybody then as long as you can stay as long as you stay in love that's those are the fruit that we want to see on God's tree that he planted add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience G brotherly kindness godliness godlin brotherly kindness and be capped off with charity the love of God oh my God bless you church I'm going to stop right there we'll keep on going next time we get here amen praise God let's have a word of prayer and I have brother Solomon come and close us amen and don't forget just for the church only just remain so I can quickly meet with you father we thank you uh for your word thank you for your truth thank you God that you uh you can speak to us father um we we see what you are calling and asking for the word is laid out so plainly before us we have to step into this you you don't change um when when Elisha asked for Elijah's robe the double anointing you didn't change the robe to fit Elisha but you changed Elisha so that he could fit the robe and God through the administration of the word we feel the change taking place brother Jerry preached about it a few weeks ago Lord this change that has to happen and God we're the word slowly but surely cutting this off and cutting that off and shaving this off and shaving that off and father how we are uh appreciative of the process that we are we're we're in it's so that you can see your very reflection in and through us us Lord be glorified and magnified is our prayer bless your people bless your people Jesus we're under expectation for you Lord to do exactly what you've promised to do we're living in the season of it and there's nothing no devil can stop it because it's

guess he he left the message years before before I came I only had one conversation with him and the Lord Brother right in this area the Lord pressed him upon my heart in such a way that I got his number and I gave him a call and we spoke probably about an hour hour and a half the only thing I remember from from that conversation he said you know brother nobody ever came for me and that's what kept him from coming back nobody ever came for but just that conversation just listen to him talk and just let him know that he was loved I think it was maybe the next week or two weeks he was back in the house of the Lord serving the lord to this day sometimes your family can't hear it coming from you sometimes they got to hear it from somebody else so make yourself available to the Lord that he may use you he wants to restore his children we're not leaving here without him so if the Lord press somebody upon your heart call them listen to him encourage them and let them know that they can come back there's forgiveness there's blood there's for forgiveness for their sins he will restore he promised it amen praise let's sing it one more time Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul
