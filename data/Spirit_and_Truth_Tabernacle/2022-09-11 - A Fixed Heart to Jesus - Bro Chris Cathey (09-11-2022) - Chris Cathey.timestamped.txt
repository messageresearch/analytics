[36:36] uh bring greetings to you from
[36:38] flagstaff uh brother
[36:41] dale
[36:42] uh smith there the pastor and some of
[36:45] you all may remember me he used to
[36:47] travel through these um
[36:49] through this circuit a lot he'd come
[36:51] with his fishing boat and
[36:53] try to find anywhere where there's some
[36:54] water and he'd jump out there and fish
[36:56] and then preach and fish
[36:58] he's just a real precious brother and uh
[37:00] but there the lord has called him out to
[37:02] flagstaff and they're in the mountains
[37:04] of arizona ain't no fishing up there
[37:07] but uh but he uh you know the lord's
[37:09] just blessed their their assembly there
[37:11] and um you know just it was a blessing
[37:13] to be able to kind of go and see he was
[37:15] telling me the testimony of um the
[37:17] church that they have
[37:19] they were renting from a little like a
[37:22] storefront
[37:23] and the lord sent a brother
[37:26] to the church
[37:28] and
[37:29] i believe the lord restored the brother
[37:31] somehow and sent him to church him and
[37:32] his mother
[37:34] and both of them had come into the
[37:36] church and
[37:37] was there the brother was there roughly
[37:39] 10 months
[37:40] and the lord had called him home
[37:42] and uh and also in that 10-month period
[37:44] the lord called the brother's mother
[37:46] home
[37:47] and uh but the mother uh left all her
[37:50] inheritance to the son
[37:53] amen and then the son
[37:55] left all his inheritance because he was
[37:57] the only child and he had he never got
[37:59] married never had children so he left
[38:01] his inheritance
[38:02] to the church
[38:07] so with that inheritance they bought a
[38:09] church in cash
[38:12] [Applause]
[38:18] won't he do it
[38:21] i say lord jesus
[38:24] sometimes i just like going and hearing
[38:26] other folk testimonials i i i the god
[38:29] that i serve is able

[46:07] actually before brother
[46:09] mullins the weekend before
[46:11] october
[46:14] 7th 8th and 9th
[46:16] [Music]
[46:18] i was recently talking with brother
[46:20] brother uh watkins
[46:23] and we we teach together on this on this
[46:25] um
[46:26] this thing on revelation you know we
[46:28] were teaching out of the book of
[46:29] revelation
[46:30] and um
[46:32] so we were talking and a few weeks ago i
[46:34] was i ran into a quote
[46:37] that just kind of helped me
[46:39] uh revelations is a very mysterious book
[46:42] and uh it's not easy to teach from there
[46:44] but you know i believe god sent us a
[46:46] prophet
[46:47] and through that prophet he might not
[46:49] have went scripture by scripture but he
[46:50] gave us enough of his comments
[46:52] and through those comments we can kind
[46:54] of put some put the picture together and
[46:57] um and and one of the things that the
[46:58] lord's been showing me in the book of
[47:00] revelation because there are things that
[47:01] people are waiting for to happen uh
[47:03] during the tribulation period but
[47:04] there's things brother branham has said
[47:06] has already been happening uh certain
[47:08] sick seal things have already been
[47:10] happening hitler and stella stalin is a
[47:12] past tense event and that was something
[47:14] that was underneath the sixth seal and
[47:16] what the lord showed me that these
[47:17] events have been running simultaneously
[47:20] god's been dealing with the jews get
[47:21] even right now this war that you see in
[47:23] ukraine god is putting the jews back in
[47:25] their homeland through that war we don't
[47:27] know
[47:28] 144 000 could be in ukraine but they got
[47:31] to be back in israel before god deals
[47:33] with them right so you know god just
[47:35] been kind of showing how things been
[47:36] running simultaneously and then
[47:39] brother branham made a statement in um
[47:41] gabriel's instructions to daniel says uh
[47:43] he says i got to teach on daniel 70
[47:46] weeks because out of the 70 weeks come
[47:48] the church ages now the seven out of
[47:50] church agents come to seals and the
[47:52] viles and the plagues and all these
[47:54] things he said if you don't understand
[47:55] the 70 weeks you know you won't
[47:57] understand the rest of it it says and
[47:59] then it says because it all fits within
[48:01] this time period
[48:02] i say wait a minute i mean everything in
[48:05] the book of revelation has to end at the
[48:08] end of that 70th week
[48:10] so no matter how mysterious it is it has
[48:12] the end there and when you start
[48:14] catching that you'll realize oh there's
[48:16] some things that already been happening
[48:18] all along the way i told the brothers
[48:20] the other night i wish that i could just
[48:22] i got about 125 lessons in the book of
[48:24] revelation and i wish i could just come
[48:26] and just take a different night and just
[48:28] teach them all to y'all
[48:30] god gonna make a way somehow
[48:32] i don't know when i don't know i don't i
[48:34] don't know when but i got it ready for
[48:36] you 125 lessons already i'm still making

[55:04] the fact is you're caught
[55:09] in a battle
[55:13] and you feel that you're losing
[55:22] and the fact is
[55:25] it's raged on
[55:27] for so long
[55:31] your steps have grown weary
[55:36] i'm sorry
[55:40] but that's just
[55:42] the facts of
[55:44] the matter
[55:48] cause the truth has not left you
[55:53] behind
[55:57] when the facts have you bound up in
[56:02] sorrow
[56:03] [Music]
[56:05] but the truth sets you
[56:08] free one more time
[56:13] and the truth is you're not
[56:17] forsaken
[56:21] oh the truth is you won't be
[56:26] denied
[56:30] well the facts may
[56:32] be stacked up against you right now
[56:38] but the truth is
[56:40] god's on your side
[56:46] now in fact there have been times you
[56:50] have questioned
[56:54] should you throw up your hands and just
[56:59] give in
[57:04] you've said there's no reason
[57:07] [Music]
[57:10] to keep fighting
[57:12] when you'll never
[57:15] win
[57:18] oh but that's not
[57:20] the end of
[57:22] your story
[57:26] cause the truth says you shall overcome
[57:33] when the facts say
[57:36] you're almost defeated
[57:41] where the truth says you've
[57:45] already won
[57:49] and the truth is you're not forsaken
[57:56] oh
[57:57] the truth is you won't be
[58:01] denied
[58:05] well the facts may
[58:07] be stacked up against you right now
[58:12] but the truth is god's on your
[58:17] side
[58:20] and the truth is
[58:23] you're not forsaken
[58:28] and the truth is you won't be
[58:32] denied
[58:36] where the facts may
[58:38] be stacked up against you right now
[58:43] but the truth is god's on your side
[58:53] [Applause]

[1:06:12] glimpse this morning what jesus has
[1:06:14] prepared for us it's not built with
[1:06:16] hands of clay but it's built with the
[1:06:19] eternal hands it's got a house that's

[1:06:40] emotional

[1:06:44] there's a balance in it i know
[1:06:47] there's a balance but how can you not
[1:06:49] get emotional when your god set from
[1:06:52] glory and saved you this morning and
[1:06:55] gave me the truth gave me a message
[1:06:58] america four or five and six this
[1:07:00] morning and set you free

[1:07:07] take it from you that god won't take it
[1:07:10] from you it might be thinking you got in
[1:07:12] the head but when you get it in their
[1:07:13] hearts and when it's anchored in that
[1:07:15] soul
[1:07:16] he said you know what the three hebrew
[1:07:18] children this morning he talked about
[1:07:20] the three hebrew children they said they
[1:07:22] couldn't burn it out of them

[1:08:28] him in this church father you can make a
[1:08:30] way well there is no way
[1:08:33] well i claim it this morning
[1:08:35] in jesus name we love you we give you
[1:08:37] this service in jesus name amen
[1:08:41] god bless you
[1:08:42] i'm gonna try to turn on my clock
[1:08:44] because i don't want to run you out of
[1:08:46] here all day
[1:08:48] but i tell you it's good to feel the
[1:08:49] liberty this morning
[1:08:51] i'll tell you what there's nowhere a
[1:08:53] better place than i would want to be all
[1:08:55] right i've been there i've tried it it
[1:08:57] ain't good all right but when you come
[1:08:59] to the house of god that's all good
[1:09:02] i need more of it every single day i
[1:09:04] wake up i say lord i need more of you
[1:09:07] i need more of you
[1:09:08] we're going to turn to psalms this
[1:09:10] morning in psalms
[1:09:12] psalms 112
[1:09:14] psalms 112.
[1:09:20] psalms 112 verse 7
[1:09:25] it says he shall not be afraid of evil
[1:09:27] tidings
[1:09:28] his heart is fixed trusting in the lord
[1:09:32] he said his heart is fixed his heart is
[1:09:34] established
[1:09:36] he shall not be afraid
[1:09:40] until
[1:09:41] he see his desire upon his enemies may
[1:09:44] you may god has blesses you may be
[1:09:46] seated i know this is probably a symbol
[1:09:48] scripture this morning but i believe
[1:09:50] every scripture is ordained of god i
[1:09:52] don't matter if it's one scripture or
[1:09:54] twenty it's all the word of god
[1:09:57] and it says he shall not be afraid of
[1:09:58] evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting
[1:10:01] the lord
[1:10:02] i believe what a better time we're
[1:10:04] living in today is to have a heart
[1:10:06] that's fixed on jesus christ
[1:10:10] we travel all over the place and i see a
[1:10:12] hesitation in the bride because their
[1:10:14] heart is not fixed on jesus christ
[1:10:18] it's fixed on the pastor's ideas it
[1:10:20] sticks on it sticks on the man's ideas
[1:10:24] it sticks on things of the world it's
[1:10:26] fixed on their their uh their bank
[1:10:28] account is fixed under 401k it's fixed
[1:10:32] on things of the world but when you
[1:10:34] truly get your heart fixed on jesus
[1:10:36] christ hey nothing can move you this
[1:10:38] morning i don't care what your daddy
[1:10:40] says i don't care what your mama says i
[1:10:43] say if none of them go with me i'm still
[1:10:45] going if your wife don't go you go if
[1:10:48] you don't go you keep claiming it this
[1:10:51] morning and i'm here to tell you if you
[1:10:53] got a wayward uh child this morning i
[1:10:55] say claim them this morning the word of
[1:10:57] god says you can have your inheritance i
[1:11:00] don't know why we keep getting scared
[1:11:02] say well devil they're out in the world
[1:11:03] i don't care where they are you know
[1:11:05] what they might just get him just
[1:11:06] because of you
[1:11:08] just because of you he said for the ones
[1:11:10] that loved you brother brown the ones
[1:11:12] that loved you and vice versa they will
[1:11:14] be there
[1:11:16] i'm not saying it gives you a free meal
[1:11:17] ticket just to ride
[1:11:20] it's not a free meal ticket just to say
[1:11:22] well you're going to be there no just
[1:11:23] keep praying for them keep trusting that
[1:11:26] they're going to be there
[1:11:28] but david you don't think about david he
[1:11:30] was a murderer adulterer but he still
[1:11:32] said it was a man after god's own heart
[1:11:36] i'm so thankful that we can look through
[1:11:38] jesus to revelation you see men just
[1:11:40] like us in clay form they found the
[1:11:42] grace of god one day
[1:11:45] that came in his heart and he knew his
[1:11:46] motive and objective brother bram said
[1:11:48] you got to know your motive and
[1:11:49] objective and everything you do
[1:11:51] your motive and objective i'm
[1:11:52] paraphrasing that all right
[1:11:55] but he said his heart is established and
[1:11:58] i believe that's today that we get so uh
[1:12:01] we get so wayward sometimes because our
[1:12:04] heart is not established
[1:12:06] it's not established on the word of god
[1:12:08] enough you know what i think sometimes
[1:12:10] the only time we read the word or we
[1:12:12] listen to a tape it's on wednesday or
[1:12:14] sunday
[1:12:16] and you want to know why we're not
[1:12:17] established it's because you have the
[1:12:19] same audio audio that i have you have
[1:12:22] the same app that i have you have the
[1:12:25] same ipad that i have and i tell you
[1:12:27] what you know what you're not going to
[1:12:29] get enough just on wednesday and sunday
[1:12:31] it's an everyday walk with jesus christ
[1:12:34] it's a daily walk that you fall in love
[1:12:36] with the master and when you sing about
[1:12:39] them brother solomon was singing i said
[1:12:41] lord jesus we're having church
[1:12:43] i say because when you talk about him
[1:12:45] when you sing about him he comes down
[1:12:48] amen hey i'm so thankful for that
[1:12:51] psalms 108.
[1:12:53] turn to 108.
[1:12:57] it says verse 1.
[1:12:59] this is david he said oh god my heart is
[1:13:01] fixed
[1:13:02] i will sing and give praise even with my
[1:13:05] glory
[1:13:07] let's turn over to um psalms 57 where
[1:13:10] we're going to be at this morning
[1:13:13] it says that uh verse 7.
[1:13:16] here he is again
[1:13:17] if he if it didn't mean as much mean
[1:13:19] that much he wouldn't say it all the way
[1:13:20] out through the scriptures
[1:13:22] he said my heart is fixed oh god my
[1:13:25] heart is fixed i will sing and give
[1:13:27] praise
[1:13:29] and then he goes on he talks about
[1:13:30] making confession with your heart also
[1:13:32] the bible says where your heart is your
[1:13:34] treasure will be also
[1:13:36] you got to realize that when you talk to
[1:13:38] a brother or sister and you see where
[1:13:40] their heart is you realize where their
[1:13:41] treasure lies
[1:13:43] that's the scripture says it and you
[1:13:45] really see that
[1:13:46] so i'm not talking about a heart repair
[1:13:48] this morning i'm talking about a
[1:13:49] dedicated established fixed on the word
[1:13:52] of god fixed on the message of the hour
[1:13:54] fixed on every word and i'll tell you
[1:13:56] what i grew up i'm telling you i'll tell
[1:13:57] you a little bit about me i grew up in a
[1:13:59] very broken up home
[1:14:01] they didn't believe this word they
[1:14:02] didn't believe this message i came and
[1:14:04] saw it about 20 years ago but i tell you
[1:14:06] what once you get anchored in you're not
[1:14:09] going nowhere once you get fixed my dad
[1:14:12] will call me today he said son do you
[1:14:14] still believe this or do you still
[1:14:15] believe that crazy stuff you're in i
[1:14:17] said dad i believe it more than i ever
[1:14:19] believed it before and the more you get
[1:14:21] in the more you won't of it
[1:14:24] i taste the endless fountain that just
[1:14:26] keeps filling you and i tell you if you
[1:14:28] haven't got that fountain this morning i
[1:14:30] provoke you to get that fountain this
[1:14:32] morning i provoke you young kids to get
[1:14:35] the holy ghost and i tell you you'll
[1:14:37] never be the same
[1:14:38] i'm not saying you won't fall i'm not
[1:14:41] saying you won't fall or have failures
[1:14:43] in your life but i'm here to tell you
[1:14:45] within your failures there's grace and
[1:14:47] he says his mercies are new every
[1:14:50] morning
[1:14:52] that's what i'm thankful for that i can
[1:14:54] turn to the scripture and say hey get up
[1:14:56] my son no matter if you found me
[1:14:58] yesterday it's a new morning to serve
[1:15:00] you
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:02] but you know what i looked up the word
[1:15:04] fix what it means it says to be firm
[1:15:07] stable
[1:15:08] established or fastened in one place
[1:15:13] let me read that again to be firm to be
[1:15:16] stable to be established or fastened
[1:15:19] into one place
[1:15:21] that's what we got to be this morning we
[1:15:23] got to be firm stable established and
[1:15:26] fastened this morning
[1:15:28] but if the wife don't believe it you
[1:15:30] believe it
[1:15:31] if the kids don't believe it you believe
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:34] i'll tell you he said one place he said
[1:15:35] he'll take one in the bed leave one
[1:15:38] hey i want to be that one this morning
[1:15:41] he said there might be one in
[1:15:42] jeffersonville what hey i'm gonna be
[1:15:44] that one there's a i tell you there's a
[1:15:45] lot in jeffersonville now
[1:15:48] i said glory to god we gotta be that one
[1:15:51] all right
[1:15:52] but i believe there's a bride here to
[1:15:54] west palm beach today
[1:15:56] i'm thankful for that
[1:15:58] but we gotta find our position in christ
[1:16:00] amen we gotta find david he wanted his
[1:16:03] heart even though all he did he focused
[1:16:05] on the lord what god wanted the house of
[1:16:07] god he focused on the word of god and
[1:16:09] doing what god wanted him to do right
[1:16:12] right he said david was a man after
[1:16:14] god's own heart after all that he's done
[1:16:17] he still looked at his heart
[1:16:19] you can look at somebody and look at
[1:16:21] where they're at and look at their their
[1:16:22] intentions and motives but you can look
[1:16:24] up god only can look at the heart you
[1:16:26] might think you know somebody but god
[1:16:28] looks at the heart brother i said
[1:16:29] there's that little spot in that heart
[1:16:31] that they found that little empty part
[1:16:33] like a fingernail
[1:16:35] and that's where your soul lies this
[1:16:36] morning
[1:16:37] i'm glad that they can't touch it he
[1:16:39] said that three hebrew children i'm
[1:16:41] paraphrasing he said when they walk up
[1:16:42] to the fiery furnace uh king
[1:16:45] nebuchadnezzar he heated it seven times
[1:16:47] hotter and you know what when they got
[1:16:49] up they were throwing them in the fiery
[1:16:51] furnace and they were dying as they were
[1:16:53] throwing them in
[1:16:54] but you think about this he said when
[1:16:56] two or three are gathered in the mist i
[1:16:58] want you to hear something this morning
[1:16:59] there's some power when it becomes when
[1:17:01] we had two or three more in the midst
[1:17:03] this morning because think about it if
[1:17:05] he was through one by one he would have
[1:17:07] probably been in trouble because he
[1:17:08] couldn't verify his word but where he
[1:17:11] messed up was when he threw two or three
[1:17:13] in the midst he said when you two or
[1:17:15] three in the midst i will show up
[1:17:18] think about it this morning when there's
[1:17:20] two or three in the mask hey it ain't

[1:22:33] thirst this in thee yea in the shadow of
[1:22:36] my weed thy wings i will make my refuge
[1:22:40] until these calamities be overpassed
[1:22:44] you know what calamity says for i
[1:22:46] already look that up it says an event
[1:22:48] causing great and often sudden damage or
[1:22:51] distress
[1:22:52] a disaster
[1:22:54] so here he is fleeing from saul for his
[1:22:57] life
[1:22:58] think about it but he says be merciful
[1:23:01] god for my soul thirst is for thee he
[1:23:03] says in the shadow of thy wings will i
[1:23:05] make my refuge you've got to find your
[1:23:07] refuge this morning
[1:23:10] and he says until these calamities be
[1:23:12] overpassed the problem is we don't have
[1:23:14] enough patience to let the climate is
[1:23:15] passed or we don't we have to call
[1:23:17] everybody else but call on the lord

[1:27:51] i dear thy unto thyself myself so that i
[1:27:54] might finish my course with joy and the
[1:27:57] ministry which i have received of the
[1:27:59] lord jesus to testify the gospel of the
[1:28:02] grace of god

[1:28:05] testimony when you're going through
[1:28:07] trials and you're going through having
[1:28:08] your heart fixed on jesus christ but
[1:28:10] none of these things move brother none

[1:30:00] brown said in absolute 1962. he said the
[1:30:03] catholic church and the pope before they
[1:30:05] said has the pope for the absolute
[1:30:07] he said the protestant has their bishops
[1:30:09] and their creeds
[1:30:11] he said they're general overseers but
[1:30:13] i'm like paul
[1:30:14] all right he said god europe he said
[1:30:16] paul got your pencil set down something
[1:30:18] he said paul said in acts the 20th 24th
[1:30:21] fourth verse none of these things move
[1:30:23] me
[1:30:24] oh he said can you have the creeds he
[1:30:27] said you can have whatever you want but
[1:30:28] then things don't move me he said i'm
[1:30:31] anchored my soul in the haven of rest
[1:30:34] to sell the winds the wild seas
[1:30:37] he said i don't know where you're at
[1:30:40] this way that way no more the tempest
[1:30:42] may sweep over the wild stormy deep he
[1:30:45] said all may turn down but in jesus i'm
[1:30:48] safe evermore
[1:30:51] he said i'm safe forevermore
[1:30:53] he said none of these things moved me he
[1:30:55] said i'm tied to an anchor he said oh
[1:30:57] since i've been met him paul said on
[1:30:59] that road i've been tied to an anchor he
[1:31:02] turned me around he set me back right
[1:31:05] you remember paul belonged to our
[1:31:06] organization he said the biggest in the
[1:31:09] land but he was tied to the united
[1:31:11] states he said but he got tied to the
[1:31:13] absolutes
[1:31:16] you got to get tied to the truth
[1:31:18] tied to the absolute and i tell you you
[1:31:20] know where you get tried that is when
[1:31:22] you say i believe a message
[1:31:25] i carry message books
[1:31:27] all right the devil knows every
[1:31:29] scripture he knows every quote
[1:31:32] you know what that's why he likes to
[1:31:33] come try his children that's why the
[1:31:35] lord lets it
[1:31:36] you know he said they're more more
[1:31:38] precious than gold
[1:31:40] i'll tell you what they're tough
[1:31:41] sometimes i'll be honest i'd be like
[1:31:44] lord but you know what he said brother
[1:31:46] brahm said you know why he does it to us
[1:31:48] he said because he has confidence in you
[1:31:51] amen

[1:31:54] because he's got conf brotherham said
[1:31:56] this he has confidence in you
[1:31:59] so when you're going through trials and
[1:32:00] tribulations i'm like lord you must have
[1:32:02] a lot of confidence today
[1:32:05] because i'm feeling it
[1:32:08] i always say i said lord

[1:32:12] the devil bring it today but you know
[1:32:13] what every time there's a way of escape
[1:32:16] every time no matter what trial the work
[1:32:18] my kids are going through there's always
[1:32:20] a way of escape
[1:32:21] there's always a way a way that you can
[1:32:23] trust in god that he's going to bring
[1:32:25] you through

[1:41:11] amen amen
[1:41:13] but i tell you don't let somebody stop

[1:41:18] about you you don't stop going to the
[1:41:20] grocery store
[1:41:22] and the grocery store that food is not
[1:41:24] gonna last
[1:41:26] i might look like it last but it ain't

[1:41:50] you know he said he purposed in verse
[1:41:52] eight daniel one he said eight by one
[1:41:54] eight he said daniel purposed in his
[1:41:56] heart
[1:41:58] we're talking about fixed heart in his
[1:42:00] heart that he would not defile himself
[1:42:02] with a portion of the king's meat nor
[1:42:03] the wine which he drank therefore he
[1:42:06] requested of the prince of the uh units
[1:42:08] and he said that he might not defile
[1:42:10] himself so david didn't matter if lions
[1:42:12] were coming didn't matter what was
[1:42:13] chasing his life he said he purposed in
[1:42:15] his heart
[1:42:16] i told my wife i said you know what if
[1:42:18] anything happens to me i don't care i
[1:42:19] said you know praise god i said you can
[1:42:21] just put it on there you can mark my
[1:42:23] tomb malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:42:26] i'm not trying to be some crazy but i'll
[1:42:27] tell you what i believe it with all my
[1:42:29] heart
[1:42:31] because it's just the scripture
[1:42:33] and i told the boys the other day we're
[1:42:34] trying to go through the whole bible
[1:42:35] with them
[1:42:37] and they were like dad you know we're
[1:42:38] going through the whole i said yes and i
[1:42:39] got a white board about that in my
[1:42:41] basement and i said we're going to go
[1:42:42] through the whole entire bible
[1:42:44] i said because the day we're living in
[1:42:46] the spirits that we're fighting out here
[1:42:48] i said if you don't know your bible you
[1:42:50] could know every quote i said but if you
[1:42:52] don't know why you believe what you
[1:42:54] believe you won't have nothing to stand
[1:42:57] on and i said you need to be established
[1:42:59] in the word of god from genesis to
[1:43:01] revelation and when someone comes up and
[1:43:04] questions you you take them back to the
[1:43:06] word of god and you say that's because
[1:43:08] it's in the bible i believe he sent them
[1:43:10] malachi 4 5 and 6 revelation 10 7. and
[1:43:13] they think oh we're fanatics i said boys
[1:43:15] you learned the front and back of this
[1:43:17] book

[1:49:50] so you see this
[1:49:52] you see us affix to the board
[1:49:55] you know it has a form of godliness
[1:49:58] think about it
[1:50:01] it has a form of godliness
[1:50:03] i had to go by this last night brother

[1:50:17] of board in the nail

[1:50:22] it has a form of godliness it goes to
[1:50:24] church

[1:50:43] but it went all the way in
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:47] it wasn't all the way in
[1:50:48] it wasn't fixed to the word of
[1:50:50] god it wasn't fixed
[1:50:53] you know joseph let me see that nail one
[1:50:55] minute

[1:51:08] i want you to get that out now
[1:51:13] you can't get it out
[1:51:14] because it's fixed to jesus christ
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:20] i want to explain something to you you
[1:51:22] know what we don't always look straight
[1:51:24] doing it
[1:51:27] [Applause]
[1:51:30] just just because you just because
[1:51:32] you're a saint of god doesn't matter you
[1:51:34] have battle scars
[1:51:37] hey you might look a little bent but
[1:51:38] you're still fixed to jesus christ
[1:51:41] you might look a little crooked this
[1:51:43] morning but you're still fixed to jesus
[1:51:45] christ
[1:51:47] you might have went through trials along
[1:51:48] the way you might have started off right
[1:51:50] come out but guess what god takes his
[1:51:53] hammer this morning and he takes it like
[1:51:55] this and he puts you in play
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:06] so he just keeps working on you brother
[1:52:08] jack
[1:52:09] solomon he said well he needs a little
[1:52:11] bit of this you know brother chris needs
[1:52:12] a lot of this
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:25] so if they look like this and they look
[1:52:27] like a brother or sister they look like
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:42] hey give
[1:52:47] well first of all we got to give god the
[1:52:49] money and then we'll get to each other
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:52] he said you robbed me because you didn't
[1:52:54] give me your tires first
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:11] yes you know even brother branham it was
[1:53:13] a process
[1:53:14] he didn't become he took he took time's
[1:53:17] progression yeah right yes sir
[1:53:20] he's working on every one of us
[1:53:22] and some of us take more time than the
[1:53:23] other
[1:53:26] when they were having me as a baby
[1:53:28] we were set up for the abortion clinic
[1:53:32] i'm trying to close get that bank
[1:53:33] brother
[1:53:34] sorry when i was when i was a kid
[1:53:38] i uh they set up the abortion clinic
[1:53:40] she went to the abortion clinic that
[1:53:42] said hey you're not gonna have this kid
[1:53:43] he's gonna be a vegetable you never talk
[1:53:46] he'll never he'll never walk
[1:53:49] all the medicine you went through all
[1:53:50] the depression you went through from
[1:53:51] being abused
[1:53:54] he said you'll never come out right
[1:53:57] mom said you know what no matter if you
[1:53:58] beat me i'm still having this baby
[1:54:03] she had me here i am today
[1:54:06] [Applause]
[1:54:11] i tell you god still lives
[1:54:13] god still cares
[1:54:15] no matter what scar you're going through
[1:54:17] i was talking to a guy the other day and
[1:54:18] he was thought we were talking and he
[1:54:20] said well i my chest this hurts and this
[1:54:22] hurts and you would never know he was
[1:54:24] burned up as a kid
[1:54:26] he said when i was a kid i was burned
[1:54:27] all the way up on my chest
[1:54:29] and i stopped and said you know
[1:54:31] we don't know what scars go behind that
[1:54:33] shirt
[1:54:34] physically mentally
[1:54:37] but i just tell you just to let god or
[1:54:39] yourself be his hands you be his feet
[1:54:43] and you just start working on that nail
[1:54:45] sometimes
[1:54:46] and say if you if you don't get anything
[1:54:48] from the service i say get fixed to
[1:54:50] jesus christ
[1:54:52] but i like what the word says in
[1:54:54] jeremiah
[1:54:55] 23
[1:54:57] 29
[1:54:59] he said is my word like as a fire
[1:55:02] look at this this one came to me last
[1:55:04] night and i had to get up and go lowe's
[1:55:06] set the lord like a hammer
[1:55:09] that break at the rock in pieces
[1:55:12] i was having a church last night brother
[1:55:14] i couldn't put it down i was like lord
[1:55:16] boy said where you going i said well
[1:55:17] i'll see you in the morning because i'm
[1:55:18] going to have church myself
[1:55:20] the boys know it they're like dad we'll
[1:55:22] see you tomorrow
[1:55:24] but he said the word is like a hammer
[1:55:27] so imagine taking this word and every
[1:55:30] day that you read the word of god
[1:55:32] is forming that nail it's forming
[1:55:34] yourself
[1:55:36] and you're being affixed
[1:55:38] to that to the board but you're being
[1:55:39] fixed to jesus christ
[1:55:42] and as brother uh jack said one time i
[1:55:44] heard about five years ago he said this
[1:55:46] is how i fight my battles
[1:55:49] and he kept singing that song this is
[1:55:51] how i fight my you know this white boy
[1:55:53] can't sing but you know
[1:55:56] come on brother but he did he was
[1:55:58] singing this is how i fight my back i
[1:56:00] still got it on video i listen to it all
[1:56:02] the time
[1:56:03] and he's got the word of god saying this
[1:56:04] is how i fight my battles
[1:56:06] and honestly that really stood out to me
[1:56:09] because that's what it takes
[1:56:11] it's not what we can say it's what we
[1:56:13] can read in here
[1:56:14] and say lord you did it for them you'll
[1:56:16] do it for me
[1:56:17] you said i could have my inheritance i
[1:56:19] could have my inheritance you said i
[1:56:21] could have a church you said hey
[1:56:22] whatever things i ask when i pray i
[1:56:25] shall have them your prophet said hey
[1:56:28] your prophet said ask for big things hey
[1:56:30] we need a building we're going to get a
[1:56:31] building
[1:56:33] i'm just i'm telling you what i'm going
[1:56:34] to put in my bible there's not one thing
[1:56:36] that i had not wrote in this bible that
[1:56:37] hadn't come to pass
[1:56:42] i'll tell you what every day i'm going
[1:56:44] to pray every day until it happens
[1:56:47] i believe every one of you should do the
[1:56:49] same amen
[1:56:52] every one of you as the musicians come
[1:56:55] we must have it all the way in
[1:56:57] we must have not just halfway in form of
[1:56:59] godliness but all the way in the word of
[1:57:01] god
[1:57:03] everything of our life
[1:57:04] everything we possess everything we say
[1:57:07] we believe a message we believe a
[1:57:09] prophet
[1:57:10] i love malachi 4 5 it talks about the
[1:57:12] heart it says behold i will send you
[1:57:14] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:57:17] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:57:20] verse 6
[1:57:21] and it shall turn the heart
[1:57:23] of the fathers to the children in the
[1:57:25] heart of the children to the fathers
[1:57:27] least i come and smite the earth with a
[1:57:29] curse he's done that
[1:57:31] he's turned our hearts back
[1:57:34] and he hasn't if he had turned your
[1:57:35] heart back this morning i provoke you to
[1:57:37] get your heart right
[1:57:40] amen and you know what we're all gonna
[1:57:42] die one day it might be a heart attack
[1:57:43] it might be liver it might be whatever
[1:57:45] it is but i tell you if that soul's
[1:57:47] right
[1:57:48] don't matter what happens to this body
[1:57:50] it don't matter and i love what brother
[1:57:52] brown said in this
[1:57:55] he says in this scripture as they play
[1:57:57] something softly
[1:57:59] he says
[1:58:01] he says right here he says the other
[1:58:02] night he said lord gave me a message i'm
[1:58:04] resting he said the whole christian
[1:58:06] principle is based upon rest
[1:58:09] and i thought it was funny he said i
[1:58:10] woke up by 10 o'clock and here he wakes
[1:58:12] up his wife he's like look i just
[1:58:14] figured out the whole christian walk is
[1:58:16] based on rest can you imagine waking
[1:58:18] your wife up and say listen i just
[1:58:20] figured it out the whole christian
[1:58:21] wife's on rest and your wife looks at
[1:58:23] you goes i was resting
[1:58:27] i was sleeping chris
[1:58:29] i was resting why are you waking me up
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:33] but he said my my yoke is light
[1:58:35] amen
[1:58:37] and i like what he says here
[1:58:39] luke 21 26 in closing men's hearts are
[1:58:42] failing for fear
[1:58:44] and for looking after those things that
[1:58:46] are coming on the earth i believe we're
[1:58:48] living soul in this day
[1:58:50] for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:58:53] listen what brother brown says he says
[1:58:55] in their eyes were opened 1957
[1:58:59] and they knew him
[1:59:00] remember if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:59:03] dissolved we have one already awaiting
[1:59:07] you know we're in war we got all these
[1:59:08] things i will read this to you i believe
[1:59:10] it will help you
[1:59:11] it says don't be scared of hydrogen
[1:59:14] bombs
[1:59:16] or no other thing as long as you got
[1:59:19] christ in your heart
[1:59:21] that's the best bomb shelter i know of
[1:59:27] thank you jesus
[1:59:29] he said that's the best bomb shelter we
[1:59:31] know of
[1:59:33] don't be scared of hydrogen bombs or no
[1:59:36] other thing as long as you've got
[1:59:37] christ's yard that's the best bomb
[1:59:39] shelter i know of it's made of
[1:59:42] feathers under his whims
[1:59:47] he said you abide
[1:59:49] he says so don't worry about those
[1:59:50] things he said you he said you're a
[1:59:52] christian
[1:59:53] but if you're not a christian
[1:59:56] you are certainly standing in an awful
[1:59:58] place
[2:00:01] he said you don't know what many your
[2:00:02] heart is going to stop beating
[2:00:04] the bible said men would die in the last
[2:00:06] days with heart trouble men's hearts
[2:00:09] fell in for fear perfects of times the
[2:00:11] stress between the nations he said look
[2:00:14] ten times as many men die as women the
[2:00:17] bible never said women's heart would be
[2:00:19] felon it said men's heart would be found
[2:00:22] that's why i believe so many homes are
[2:00:24] broke up
[2:00:26] because they don't take joshua
[2:00:28] they don't take it strong enough they
[2:00:30] don't take it and say you know what no
[2:00:32] matter what we go through we got it over
[2:00:33] over our when we walk through the
[2:00:35] threshold
[2:00:36] this house will serve god
[2:00:39] me and my house will serve the lord
[2:00:42] now says honey you leave that for
[2:00:44] the rest of my life if something ever
[2:00:46] happens to me you keep these boys in the
[2:00:48] truth you keep them in this truth and
[2:00:50] you bring them to church every time them
[2:00:52] doors are open
[2:00:53] and brother braham said get somewhere
[2:00:54] and support a pastor all right now amen
[2:00:58] he does
[2:00:59] he says get somewhere call somewhere
[2:01:01] your home church

[2:01:16] someone way out to the right but someone
[2:01:19] in the middle of the road

[2:08:32] a fixed heart
[2:08:34] a fixed heart
[2:08:36] i i think we all can identify with a
[2:08:38] word that was spoken here today is
[2:08:41] a man of heart that is
[2:08:44] fastened in one place
[2:08:46] that was the definition that brother
[2:08:48] chris gave and when he used the
[2:08:50] the nail amen into the wood
[2:08:53] once he got it fastened in there brother
[2:08:55] joseph wasn't gonna pull it out
[2:08:57] amen and that that is a uh um should be
[2:09:00] an encouragement once you're fixed
[2:09:02] you're fastened amen in christ there's
[2:09:05] nothing the devil can do
[2:09:07] to pull you out of that place
[2:09:09] amen i i'm just grateful i think last
[2:09:12] week brother
[2:09:13] smiley was making a comment how god just
[2:09:16] makes us all so different and and uh you
[2:09:19] know just how the ministry's just kind
[2:09:21] of flowing and brother chris i can just
[2:09:23] imagine him coming into lowe's at 9 58
[2:09:26] looking for a piece of wood and a man a
[2:09:28] nail
[2:09:29] and a hammer you know because he got to
[2:09:31] make this point and that's something
[2:09:33] brother chris that'll stay with us
[2:09:35] amen i'm glad they let them in that lows
[2:09:38] amen but that's something that'll stay
[2:09:39] with us i think if we kept this bullet
[2:09:42] that this board in the back everybody
[2:09:43] here that was here today would
[2:09:44] understand what it all meant but others
[2:09:47] might come say why in the world y'all
[2:09:48] got that board up there it's because our
[2:09:50] heart is fixed
[2:09:52] our mind is made up
[2:09:55] amen no turning back no turning back no
[2:09:58] turning back brother brother chris god
[2:10:00] bless you we really appreciate
[2:10:03] amen you stopping by
[2:10:05] amen and minister to our hearts today

[2:10:08] this was this was real real good
[2:10:11] and i'm gonna be using that um
[2:10:15] uh david got hurt but he didn't give up
[2:10:18] and he said people get hurt in church
[2:10:20] all the time
[2:10:22] but when they get hurt they talk about

[2:10:29] that how that cashier treated you you

[2:10:32] that cashier walmart but it did not stop

[2:10:57] uh so appreciative of the word of the
[2:11:00] lord that we have heard
[2:11:02] uh here today the the beautiful example
[2:11:05] that was given to us
[2:11:07] lord to be fixed and even
[2:11:09] lord how the nail was just so crooked
[2:11:12] amen but it was fixed no matter no
[2:11:14] matter what the condition was it was
[2:11:16] still fixed it wasn't going anywhere and
[2:11:18] god how you use the example just to show

[2:11:41] lord that nail was barely in yeah we
[2:11:43] were going through the motions but we
[2:11:45] were not fixed and that's why we ended
