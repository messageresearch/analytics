[25:37] in in my and in my life when my children
[25:42] were younger and this one particular
[25:45] lady we were talking about we had not
[25:47] seen this lady for like maybe 10 12
[25:50] years and I was asking her I said oh she
[25:52] has to be dead by now because she was so
[25:54] old in but it was like somebody was
[25:57] stuff that his lady like blue but she
[25:58] loved my children and that was at nine
[26:02] nine o'clock in the morning at 11 54 I
[26:07] walk into one of my doctor's office I
[26:10] walk in say hello to everybody and I
[26:13] walk out and this lady sitting right in
[26:15] front of me and I said and she looked at
[26:19] me she said I see you looking at me I
[26:21] say you miss Valley she said yes I said
[26:24] oh my god and I'm screaming inside these
[26:26] people dogs life I said oh my godness
[26:28] Valley my daughter and I was just
[26:30] talking about you and I thought you with
[26:32] did she say no I'm alive and I said well
[26:34] thank God and I was just telling her how
[26:36] precious she was to me and she was to my
[26:40] children and she said that is so good
[26:42] she said let me see I was pretty big I
[26:44] said do you remember her she said I'll
[26:46] come on forget though and I was just
[26:48] saying God I thank you because it was
[26:50] just a desire of my heart to go back to
[26:52] her to tell her thank you but I knew she
[26:54] was not at that school anymore and just
[26:57] to know that she was still alive and she
[26:59] remembered my girls that was a blessing
[27:03] to me and I just say God I thank you for
[27:06] just even loving me just that much to
[27:08] just hear the conversation between my
[27:10] daughter and I and that you you fulfill
[27:12] the heart's desire for me and I just
[27:15] thank God for that and then another part
[27:17] of a testimony I want to give is um last
[27:20] tape service I came in on the end of the
[27:23] service and brother Jack was giving his
[27:27] testimony about some little boy had
[27:29] gotten hit across the street and he just
[27:32] had started praying for the little boy
[27:33] but by the time you know things I ended
[27:37] the little boy had came out of the
[27:38] ambulance well one morning I was walking
[27:40] into work and one of the girls at work
[27:44] she just started screaming and kind
[27:46] she just fell into my arms and I'm
[27:48] looking like okay what is the problem
[27:49] and she says my niece my niece um was in
[27:53] an accident and she's in ICU my niece
[27:56] and her I guess was her cousin my
[27:58] sister-in-law excuse me
[27:59] and so I was just trying to console her
[28:02] and it was just like a second and
[28:04] everybody else was just standing around
[28:06] and I say excuse me you guys don't know
[28:09] but you will know by now I believe in
[28:11] prayer and I said if you don't mind and
[28:13] if you do you won't you'll have to wait
[28:15] till after I finish this because she's
[28:16] really upset and they said no we don't
[28:19] mind so I just started praying for her
[28:21] and as I pray for her I just went into a
[28:24] mold just telling them what to do and
[28:26] I'm like Laura don't even know if I'm
[28:27] telling these people the right things to
[28:28] do I said but you need to get yourself
[28:30] together if you go into the hospital you
[28:32] know I was just doing all that and by
[28:34] the time I was leaving on I say now you
[28:35] believe and what I just pray for you but
[28:38] you have to believe it she said I will I
[28:40] will and so I told the other I'm young
[28:42] lady that was there I said can you just
[28:45] keep me updated on how everything go 15
[28:48] minutes from leaving that office from
[28:51] leaving Jupiter on Center Street to get
[28:53] before I got to i-95 on Donna Rosa Road
[28:55] she called me and she said Michelle she
[28:57] don't have to go to the hospital her
[28:58] niece is being released
[28:59] I say from ICU she was in an accident
[29:03] that world over seven kinds off of i-95
[29:05] I said so the power prayer works and I
[29:10] was just thanking God I was telling
[29:11] Sheree I was just thinking god I didn't
[29:14] see if I was just and then quiet and
[29:15] just been praying in my soul and not
[29:18] they would have never known the power of
[29:19] prayer so the next one and I went in
[29:21] there so the other young lady say she
[29:23] said you don't have prayer thing you do
[29:25] we gonna call you for that more often so
[29:28] y'all know me I say did you know that
[29:30] prayer thing I do I'm gonna teach you
[29:31] how to do that she say it works if you
[29:35] believe so and you know and I just thank
[29:37] God because they always look and say
[29:40] you're always so happy and I always tell
[29:41] them why I'm happy there's the joy that
[29:43] the Lord is my strength you know
[29:44] everything like that but then people
[29:46] really just need to actually see faith
[29:48] in action and when they saw faith in
[29:50] action that particular day it was a
[29:52] really testimony for me to let me know
[29:56] that my life is truly shining
[29:59] I feel like it is so dim and it does not
[30:01] just reflect anything other than me
[30:03] being happy me wearing a skirt or you
[30:05] know just me doing anything I said but
[30:07] God I actually get to witness and see
[30:10] you in action these people know that
[30:13] they don't have to just come to me and
[30:14] just say will you pray for me about this
[30:16] I can actually stop and say to you now
[30:17] let's pray right now and I'm gonna show
[30:19] you how to pray but you have to believe
[30:21] you good I could believe all I want to
[30:24] but you have to believe in the power
[30:25] prayer so I just thank God and I just
[30:27] really just thank God for him being my
[30:30] Savior so thank you so much I certainly
[30:38] appreciate that soon we gonna be the
[30:41] only Jesus that some people see they say
[30:44] the scriptures say that we are limping

[31:37] here so I just I went to grab passed I
[31:40] said uh can you come pray with me I said
[31:43] when you pray right now there's a
[31:44] situation going on and I know it's just
[31:48] the the hand of the enemy because God
[31:51] has opened so many doors for me and my
[31:54] family and I'm just grateful for but you
[31:57] know the enemy don't like seeing that so
[32:00] he showed up and I got past and we pray
[32:03] you prayed a quick prayer so then of
[32:05] course you know I know that sometimes
[32:07] things gonna get worse before they get
[32:08] better
[32:09] I mean everybody knows not go none of us
[32:12] had a flowery bed of ease
[32:14] so this soon as we prayed I went back in
[32:17] church thinking okay we prayed about
[32:19] everything all right I get another call
[32:21] they had to take it to the hospital so
[32:26] and we weren't even sure who she was

[32:43] me and he was so calm hey daddy how you
[32:46] doing I'm not good
[32:48] I hear her in the background just you
[32:50] know throwing a tantrum so I was like
[32:52] let me talk to us so then I was like I
[32:55] was talking to my father-in-law and I
[32:58] was like you know what do you need me to
[33:00] come up there and he was like yeah let
[33:03] me ask Tracy like all right so she said
[33:04] yes I went up there and I mean even
[33:06] though we didn't know what the outcome
[33:07] of the situation was I went up there and
[33:11] got both of them too and all we did is
[33:14] went to McDonald's I had ice cream but
[33:16] they calmed her down they they we
[33:21] started laughing joke and it changed the
[33:23] whole atmosphere of situation and then
[33:35] when they got the ice cream we talking I
[33:38] mean she still she's still upset and
[33:40] everything and we're just talking and I
[33:41] didn't do much talking I did most of the
[33:43] listening but I let them talk and you
[33:45] know just you know get whatever was only
[33:47] hard and you know just then they start
[33:49] talking about you know different things
[33:51] they were going through and all of a
[33:52] sudden we went from crying to laugh and
[33:54] enjoying each other so then not too much
[33:58] after I got a phone call said alright
[33:59] you could take them home we on our way
[34:01] home so they released care everybody was
[34:04] home I told them they were happy I just
[34:06] thank God that he just he's always there
[34:10] I mean when every situation like if you
[34:14] seek him first
[34:15] he'll make sure he make his presence
[34:17] known and I'm just thankful
[34:21] whoa ladies I appreciate that testimony
[34:26] Lord just spoke to me now there's a word
[34:29] there's a word and our English language
[34:33] is pronounced the same the spell
[34:37] different and that word is presence
[34:42] now that's PR d SE NTS you can you can
[34:48] present presence or PR es e NCE is just
[34:54] being present and and what uh what we
[34:57] what we saw expect that just
[35:00] demonstrated there is just the calming
[35:02] presence not just gifts right but the
[35:06] calming presence of a father and that
[35:09] that is immediate right so that that
[35:12] meant a lot a lot and and I tell you
[35:16] what even that spoke to me I got it I
[35:19] got it
[35:19] not just bring PR e SPMTs
[35:24] but I gotta be PR es es de all right
[35:31] [Laughter]
[35:34] if anybody wanna testify yes sir we got
[35:38] one here we got Louisville in here okay
[35:44] so I'll just want to give honor to the
[35:47] Lord Jesus and then recognize that
[35:49] sometimes the Lord comes on the scene
[35:55] when you don't really even asked him to
[35:58] do it but he's ever giving he's a giving
[36:07] God and he takes care out needs and he
[36:11] provides for us and I say that because I
[36:14] went home here recently I think it was
[36:17] Sunday and I came back I went home to
[36:22] take care of some things for my dad and
[36:25] we went to visit them in the hospital my
[36:28] brother and I my brother flew from Texas
[36:30] of course I flew from Florida and we met
[36:32] and we cleaned up some things and we met
[36:34] my dad at the hospital one I think it
[36:37] was on Tuesday the speech therapist came
[36:44] in while we were there and that was that
[36:47] my dad has speech therapy because of his
[36:51] stroke so his vocal cords were damaged
[36:54] and he had to have therapy every day for
[36:58] that but it was it's been a very tenuous
[37:01] relationship between my dad and the
[37:04] speech therapist he's had two different
[37:06] ones and that that that has been a very
[37:10] difficult time for him to have to come
[37:17] in for the therapy and you have to do
[37:18] exercises and she goes through these
[37:21] things and he was getting frustrated at
[37:23] some point he didn't want to even talk
[37:25] to her anymore and they said some things
[37:28] and he was and so me and my brother were
[37:30] trying to calm him down because he had
[37:34] to get ready for a test on today and in
[37:39] order for him to not have speech therapy
[37:43] anymore he has surpassed
[37:45] test this this bærum test that it was
[37:48] today and so we were trying to encourage
[37:51] him and telling him to practice what
[37:54] that she was saying and I even called
[37:56] her to arrange for the time for them to
[38:01] meet because he what she was show up and
[38:04] he would say I can't do it and he did it
[38:06] like three times so she was getting
[38:09] frustrated and so after after I
[38:14] coordinated that and I flew back on
[38:17] Wednesday and right when I flew back on
[38:20] Wednesday they called me he had a
[38:23] doctor's appointment with a cardiologist
[38:25] and he went to the appointment and the
[38:29] doctor saw his lake was swollen and he
[38:34] was having shortened a brett shortness
[38:36] of breath and then they rushed him to
[38:38] the emergency room again and so when
[38:42] they got there they determined he had a
[38:44] congestive heart failure so this was on
[38:48] wednesday and so they were doing what
[38:52] they need to do put a IV in and give it
[38:54] him some Daryl some lasix Durrett to
[38:59] reduce the liquid to bring out the
[39:02] liquid in his body and see what it was
[39:04] going through that process and I was and
[39:06] I knew based on what they were saying
[39:09] that he was maybe there for a while and
[39:12] so his haunt meant for the speech oh the
[39:16] bærum test was today and so he's in the
[39:19] hospital then that was going to be very
[39:22] challenging for him to try to make it
[39:24] because they won't be able to release
[39:25] him from the hospital so I called the
[39:28] nurse at the facility that he's staying
[39:31] at and I was like hey I'm really
[39:34] concerned about him not being able to
[39:36] make that test and I know that you
[39:38] probably gonna have to reschedule it and
[39:41] she said well let me let me and I said I
[39:43] was I told her about the relationship
[39:45] that was challenging and I think that
[39:47] may have stressed him too to cause him
[39:49] to get him because dishing that he's in
[39:51] with his heart and all of that is
[39:52] because he was very
[39:54] under stress with that whole situation
[39:56] it was very taxing on him and and so she
[40:02] said okay let me go and talk to the
[40:05] speech therapist and let me go and talk
[40:07] to some folks and I'll get back with you
[40:10] and so she called me back I think it was
[40:13] yesterday and she said hey I I called
[40:19] the hospital and asked them to ask the
[40:24] doctor there to put her order in so he
[40:27] could take the tests there at the
[40:30] hospital and I was like really she's
[40:33] like yes so I said oh great so I called
[40:36] the nurse and I talked to the nurse that
[40:38] at the hospital there she said yeah I'll
[40:40] put the order again but I don't know if
[40:42] it's gonna you know if they're gonna do
[40:44] it or not but I put that the order is in
[40:46] I said well did you tell him yet it was
[40:49] like no I didn't tell them yet I said
[40:51] she said well he's gonna have to not eat
[40:54] after 12:00 midnight I say well you're
[40:55] gonna have to tell them so because you
[40:58] know as you as we get older it's a
[41:02] challenge when we say something's going
[41:04] to happen in the end it doesn't happen
[41:05] right so that's what I was trying to
[41:08] manage that aspect of it too because if
[41:11] it didn't happened in he was like well
[41:13] you know I would get a phone call so so
[41:17] she put the order in and then she went
[41:18] over I mean she she went and told him
[41:21] and so he called me because I hate you
[41:24] know what they're gonna do they gonna
[41:25] let me take the test tomorrow I said he
[41:29] said I use that you really I say oh yeah
[41:32] yes I said yeah I know you know so you
[41:34] can't eat after 12:00 you say oh you
[41:36] know I say yeah yeah yeah yeah I talked
[41:39] to some people or whatever though so he
[41:44] was like all this idea I'll say okay
[41:45] great I said then you know you gotta
[41:47] pass this test he said yeah I know I
[41:50] said you want if you don't want to see
[41:52] that that speech therapist no more you
[41:54] need to pass this test
[41:57] you have yeah I gotta pass this test and
[42:00] also there's this this he's in skilled
[42:03] nursing right now
[42:04] so this this this speech therapy thing
[42:08] has been preventing him from going to
[42:10] assisted living within the visit of a
[42:14] facility so it kind of it was and hit
[42:16] that he was wanting to move as well but
[42:18] this thing was just holding it was like
[42:20] a cloud over his head like and so so
[42:24] after he we talked a little bit and you
[42:29] know say well you know get some rest and
[42:31] then let me know what happened so he
[42:34] called me today he called me today and
[42:37] he was like guess what I passed my test
[42:46] ladies what happy I just want to thank
[42:49] God give God the praise I mean I didn't
[42:51] really talk to the Lord about it so much
[42:54] but I did pray about it some last night
[42:57] but even in the short prayers God comes
[43:01] on his hand and answers and gives us a
[43:05] good desires of heart so thank you
[43:10] praise the Lord for that thank God for
[43:13] answering the prayer I like to thank God

[45:21] somewhere more wholesome it's really
[45:27] nice and them just actually see that you
[45:29] know God within me as well that's one of
[45:32] my biggest prayers no matter where I go

[45:35] trying to do for God and everything like
[45:37] that okay thing to thank the church
[45:41] thank you guys
[45:43] [Applause]
[45:49] what uh that's a wonderful testimony and
[45:52] a man we were we were in prayer and I'm
[45:58] gonna have to cut the testimonies there
[46:00] because I brother brother Jerry is gonna
[46:02] speak for us tonight and I want him to
[46:04] have the opportunity just in time but I
[46:10] wanted to take time just to read the
[46:12] scripture really quick and out of first
[46:15] chronicles chapter 4 verse 9 and 10 we
[46:18] were in prayer and I just felt led to
[46:21] pray this over the brothers on last last
[46:25] week and to see God is doing exactly
[46:29] what we prayed I felt it would be
[46:32] beneficial for me to at least read this
[46:35] over to church a man tonight and now and
[46:41] maybe during our time of collecting the
[46:44] offering we will pray this over the
[46:46] church as well but first chronicles 4
[46:49] verse 9 says and jay-bez was more
[46:51] honorable then his brother and his
[46:54] mother called his name jay-bez Sam
[46:57] because I bear him with sorrow and
[46:59] jay-bez call on the God of Israel saying
[47:03] oh that thou would with us bless me
[47:07] indeed and enlarge my coasts and that
[47:12] thine hand might be with me and that
[47:15] that would escape me from evil that it
[47:17] may not grieve me and God granted him
[47:20] that which he requested now you know we
[47:24] talked about a large and coast
[47:25] everybody coast is different somebody
[47:27] coast might be a job so everybody coast
[47:29] might be a touch in their body a man
[47:33] somebody's coast might be restoration in
[47:35] their family a man but no matter what it
[47:38] is
[47:38] we've asked God to enlarge the coasts
[47:40] right and and we were just praying over
[47:43] that and and just to hear these
[47:45] testimonies God answers prayer in y'all
[47:47] it meant God answers prayer and we ought
[47:51] to get ready for you know what
[47:52] whatever coast we have in our life we
[47:55] all get ready to forgot to enlarge a man
[47:57] let's uh prepare to take tonight's tizen
[48:00] offering and then then we'll have
[48:01] brother Jared come out and share from
[48:03] his heart we meant to our hearts and a
[48:06] man we just look forward to what the
[48:09] Lord has in store for us let's just pray
[48:15] and as we're praying over tonight's
[48:17] often I want to pray over the church a
[48:19] man this this prayer father we come into
[48:26] your mind ik residence thank you for the
[48:28] precious testimonies that we have heard
[48:31] here tonight Lord how we have been
[48:35] strengthened by these these words that
[48:38] are spoken to us and God to just think
[48:42] Oh
[48:44] roughly a week ago we were praying over
[48:46] this scripture you just I felt LED at
[48:49] the end of prayer just to just call out
[48:51] each brothers name and even not only
[48:54] brothers that were there but the
[48:55] brothers that weren't there we began to
[48:57] call their names out and then God you
[49:00] had me just begin the coal a man that
[49:03] the church out that the sisters is well
[49:06] and God as we just call them out where
[49:09] we're praying that you would enlarge
[49:11] their coast and somebody this is their
[49:14] business and somebody this is their
[49:17] family and somebody this is a job the
[49:20] Lord somebody this is health their Coast
[49:24] represents so many different things but
[49:26] Lord you know what the people stand in
[49:28] need of and and we acts that you would
[49:30] meet them all at the point of need made
[49:32] you God do things that go beyond our
[49:34] expectations that here brother Devon's
[49:37] testimony that they not only gave him
[49:40] the money that he was offering they went
[49:41] above and God they even made promises
[49:43] that don't go further than that so this
[49:46] is the enlargement that we're talking
[49:48] about and if we're faithful to you if
[49:49] we're doing what you called us to do
[49:51] them God we know that you would do
[49:53] greater things you do the exceeding the

[56:23] amen
[56:31] [Applause]
[56:39] thank you yeah that uh that song was on
[56:47] time very on time so I'm gonna read a
[56:56] very family familiar scripture and just
[57:02] trust that God will administer it every
[57:04] heart turn me to John 3:16 say man if
[57:15] you're ready so he says for God so loved
[57:22] the world that He gave His only begotten
[57:25] Son that whosoever believeth in him
[57:28] should not perish but have everlasting
[57:30] life
[57:31] for God sent His Son into the world to
[57:34] condemn them to condemn the world but
[57:36] that the world through him might be
[57:39] saved he that believeth on him is not
[57:41] condemned but he that believeth not is
[57:44] condemned already because he hath not
[57:47] believed in the name of the only
[57:48] begotten Son I'd also like to read in 1
[57:51] Corinthians 13
[58:02] it reads though I speak with the tongues
[58:05] of men and of angels and have not
[58:07] charity I am become as sounding brass or
[58:09] a tinkling cymbal and though I have the
[58:13] gift of prophecy and understand all
[58:15] mysteries and all knowledge and and
[58:17] though I have all faith so I could move
[58:20] mountains and have not charity I am
[58:21] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[58:24] to feed the poor and though I give my
[58:26] body to be burned and have not charity
[58:28] it profiteth me nothing charity
[58:31] suffereth long and is kind charity
[58:33] envieth not charity vaunteth not itself
[58:36] and is not puffed up does not behave
[58:39] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[58:41] not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[58:44] rejoice it then not in not in iniquity
[58:47] but rejoiceth it in the truth beareth
[58:49] all things believeth all things hopeth
[58:51] all things endureth all things charity
[58:55] never faileth but whether they be
[58:57] prophecies they shall fail whether they
[59:00] be tongues they shall cease whether they
[59:02] be knowledge it shall vanish away for we
[59:05] know in part and we prophesy in part you
[59:09] may be seated
[59:12] may the Lord add a blessing to his
[59:15] reading I'll just just going to continue
[59:18] reading verse 7 continues and says sorry
[59:24] verse 10 says but when we when that
[59:27] which is perfect is come then that which
[59:30] is in part shall be done away when I was
[59:33] a child I spake as a child I understood
[59:35] as a child I thought it as a child but
[59:38] when I became a man I put away childish
[59:40] things for now we see through a glass
[59:43] darkly but then face to face now I know
[59:46] in part but then shall I know even as
[59:49] also I am known
[59:51] and now abideth Faith Hope charity these
[59:54] three but the greatest of these is
[59:56] charity I like to use as a title God
[1:00:01] kind of switched things up on me
[1:00:04] operating and God's love
[1:00:07] and I pay attention closely to verse 13
[1:00:13] it says that we know in the midst of
[1:00:18] everything else there remaineth 3 and
[1:00:21] that's charity hope and faith we have
[1:00:25] these three that that we know that that
[1:00:28] endures but the greatest of them all is
[1:00:31] love is charity that's that's what's the
[1:00:33] greatest and I had to ask myself why is
[1:00:36] it that love is the greatest out of them
[1:00:39] all and I realized that that love is the
[1:00:43] foundation love is is what produces hope
[1:00:47] and faith you have to have love before
[1:00:50] you can have hope in something you have
[1:00:53] to have love before you can have faith
[1:00:54] in something and I realized that in John
[1:00:59] 3:16 it was the love of God that was
[1:01:03] expressed to humanity right we see that
[1:01:06] God how to plan a purposeful plan in the
[1:01:10] beginning where he he he needed to get
[1:01:13] into communion with his people and when
[1:01:17] we look at what he did in the arm well
[1:01:20] he said in John 3:16 well we see Christ
[1:01:24] being the very manifestation of God's
[1:01:26] love and says for God so loved the world
[1:01:30] that He gave His only begotten Son that
[1:01:33] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:01:35] perish but have everlasting life so
[1:01:38] Christ is the gift of God and when we're
[1:01:42] operating God's love we have to be doing
[1:01:45] the same thing that Christ did it's not
[1:01:48] enough to say I believe God but but you
[1:01:50] have to say I love God and even then
[1:01:53] when you love God do you know what the
[1:01:55] love of God is because the love of God
[1:01:58] is what passes all understanding right
[1:02:01] it here it says uh
[1:02:11] it Ephesians 3:19
[1:02:23] I won't be long Church it says it's an
[1:02:30] oval love of Christ which passeth all
[1:02:33] understanding that you might be filled
[1:02:35] with the fullness of God so what we're
[1:02:38] looking for is the fullness of God to be
[1:02:41] in full display in all areas of our
[1:02:43] lives right the love of God produces
[1:02:46] relationship when we really love that
[1:02:48] it's no longer a ritual but a
[1:02:50] relationship it's not a matter of coming
[1:02:53] to church every Sunday but it's coming
[1:02:55] with an expectation knowing that all
[1:02:58] that you are is because of God and and
[1:03:02] it will just go ahead the love of God
[1:03:04] produces obedience right when you really
[1:03:08] love God you understand through the
[1:03:10] midst of your obedience God cannot fell
[1:03:12] when you're obedient that's what
[1:03:14] overcomes your trials your problems
[1:03:16] right your trials are no longer facing
[1:03:19] your problems don't overshadow you and
[1:03:23] your situations won't define you when
[1:03:26] you're when you're there and the perfect
[1:03:27] love of God right you you you you know
[1:03:30] just what to expect and that affect you
[1:03:32] you look forward to your trials because
[1:03:34] you know that God or he's only trying
[1:03:36] you to prove you to show that something
[1:03:39] is in you that he wants to bring out
[1:03:40] that's why the Bible tells us in John
[1:03:43] and James 1 consider all joy when you
[1:03:45] can understand the love of God you're
[1:03:48] not you're not waiting for the Joe to
[1:03:50] come the joys already there and and and
[1:03:54] and we all have to be operating in the
[1:03:56] perfect love of God every act of
[1:03:59] obedience that that we commit is drawing
[1:04:02] us closer to our blessing God cannot
[1:04:05] bless you if you're not doing the right
[1:04:07] thing
[1:04:07] I cannot bless you if you're not obeying
[1:04:11] His commandments right how did God tell
[1:04:14] us that that we that we ought to love
[1:04:16] him he says if in John 14:15 if you love
[1:04:19] me you'll keep my Commandments right and
[1:04:22] I realize that and keeping those
[1:04:25] Commandments it is actually his
[1:04:28] Commandments are keeping you right
[1:04:30] because when you're in a trial and you
[1:04:33] keeping his Commandments it is for
[1:04:35] electing you it's overshadowing your
[1:04:37] problems it's allowing you to overcome
[1:04:39] every obstacle that you're going through
[1:04:42] right so so your obedience is what's
[1:04:47] going to connect you with your blessings
[1:04:48] and if you're not obedient is delaying
[1:04:51] the process right I love what the
[1:04:54] Prophet says and God projecting his word
[1:04:57] it gives us the he gives us the
[1:04:59] expectation he says when love is
[1:05:04] projected and it comes to the end of his
[1:05:07] strength Sovereign Grace will take up
[1:05:10] from there and project the object that
[1:05:12] love has asked for right so we know love
[1:05:16] itself has attributes
[1:05:18] that's grace that's God's mercy right
[1:05:20] that that's all that he's done for us
[1:05:22] when we look at other things it produces
[1:05:25] it shows us that when we're operating in
[1:05:28] the love of God right we won't even lay
[1:05:32] our life for our own brother right what
[1:05:36] will be dia to the very end
[1:05:39] well you're operating in God's love
[1:05:41] knocking can put his confidence in you
[1:05:45] and that's what's that's that's
[1:05:48] extremely important because there's a
[1:05:50] lot of man that God has put his
[1:05:52] confidence in and it wasn't because of
[1:05:54] of their faith it wasn't because of
[1:05:56] their gifts or any mighty things they've
[1:05:59] done but it's because of their total
[1:06:01] surrender to God and Joshua is one of
[1:06:06] those that that God put his confidence
[1:06:08] in let me just go to Joshua here
[1:06:20] Joshua will start at the third verse of
[1:06:24] the first chapter every place that the
[1:06:28] sole of your foot shall threat upon that
[1:06:31] God has have given out to you as I as I
[1:06:38] said unto Moses from the wilderness in
[1:06:42] the Lebanon even unto the great river
[1:06:44] the river your fates all the land of the
[1:06:47] Hittites and until the Great Sea toward
[1:06:49] the going down of the Sun shall be your
[1:06:51] coast there shall be not any man be able
[1:06:54] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:06:57] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:07:01] with you I will not fail thee nor
[1:07:03] forsake thee be strong and of the
[1:07:06] courage for unto this people shall be
[1:07:08] divided for an inheritance the land
[1:07:10] which I swear to their fathers to give
[1:07:12] them so we see that God has had
[1:07:15] confidence in in Joshua he set the
[1:07:19] expectation and he told him that he
[1:07:21] won't fail him no he forsake him and if
[1:07:23] we understand what the love of God is we
[1:07:26] know that the God's love is on feeling
[1:07:30] right God God's love is he's not jealous
[1:07:35] God's love does not is not arrogant
[1:07:38] right it's it's accepting all that he's
[1:07:41] done its patient it's kind and it's
[1:07:44] happy with the truth right and I take
[1:07:50] note of what the love of God does
[1:07:54] produce and and what it ought to do and
[1:07:58] if we understand that we ought to get
[1:08:00] keep God's commandments then we
[1:08:03] understand that what we have need of God
[1:08:07] can meet God can I can do those things
[1:08:09] for us and in John 3:22
[1:08:24] I'm sorry first John 3:22
[1:08:33] it it tells us what happens if we do
[1:08:37] keep God's commandments if we do if we
[1:08:40] are operating God's love and it says and
[1:08:44] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:08:46] because we keep his Commandments and do
[1:08:50] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:08:52] sight and this is the this is his
[1:08:55] commandment that we should believe on
[1:08:56] the name of the son of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:59] love one another as he gave us
[1:09:01] commandment so if we can be obedient
[1:09:05] until the very end we know that God will
[1:09:08] meet us at our very need and the His
[1:09:12] commandments are not Grievous they're
[1:09:15] not difficult right and they're not
[1:09:19] they're not difficult so we we have that
[1:09:23] joy right now we have that power that
[1:09:26] strength to endure overcome our trials
[1:09:30] even right now because we understand
[1:09:33] that the love of God does not that not
[1:09:37] perish but it prevails and not having
[1:09:43] the love of God actually puts you in
[1:09:49] position to deny truth because it's that
[1:09:54] is that spirit that's in you that that
[1:09:57] that's not that's a Best contrary to
[1:09:59] Christ because for God so loved the
[1:10:02] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[1:10:04] God gave us Christ as a gift to to us
[1:10:10] his people because he knows we needed to
[1:10:13] be redeemed and knowing that we knowing
[1:10:17] that why we were yet sinners he loved us
[1:10:19] he knows that we needed to be reconciled
[1:10:24] to him we need to we need to be needed
[1:10:26] to have fellowship with him once again
[1:10:28] and and 2 Thessalonians verse 10 it
[1:10:36] tells us that with all deceivableness of
[1:10:39] unrighteousness and them that perish
[1:10:43] will they receive not the love of the
[1:10:46] truth
[1:10:47] that they might be saved and for this
[1:10:49] cause God shall send them strong
[1:10:51] delusion that they shall believe a lie
[1:10:54] so so when the love of God is not in you
[1:10:58] right it's hard for you to accept truth
[1:11:01] it's hard for you to accept the message
[1:11:04] that God is sitting to you because those
[1:11:07] that God used his God puts his
[1:11:08] confidence and just like you did with
[1:11:10] mote just like they're with Moses just
[1:11:12] like you did with Joshua and we're
[1:11:14] living in a time now where we're his
[1:11:17] people God needs to be reconciled with
[1:11:20] us how fellowship with us well who did
[1:11:22] God have confidence and even right now
[1:11:25] well we understand that in Malachi tells
[1:11:28] us before the great and dreadful day
[1:11:29] he's going to send us a prophet and the
[1:11:33] ministry of this prophet shall be like
[1:11:35] I'll tell Liza so we understand that
[1:11:40] brother Branham was that fulfillment and
[1:11:42] God put his confidence in brother
[1:11:46] Branham his ministry was vindicated and
[1:11:50] for this reason we can't be deceived
[1:11:52] because we have the love of God in us
[1:11:54] where we can accept truth not be
[1:11:57] deceived by a lie
[1:11:58] that's God's confidence not only for the
[1:12:02] brothers ministry but every one of us
[1:12:04] here even right now it goes on saying
[1:12:16] and for this cause God shall send them
[1:12:19] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:12:20] a lie that they shall be damned who
[1:12:23] believeth not the truth but had pleasure
[1:12:25] in unrighteousness see we understand
[1:12:28] that the love of God cannot dwell with
[1:12:32] the with with the unrighteousness of
[1:12:34] Satan it's it's two contrary places that
[1:12:40] cannot do all that in the same
[1:12:42] atmosphere another person that that
[1:12:45] walked with God that that had fellowship
[1:12:48] with God was Joel and we understand that
[1:12:52] Joel had many trials and for someone
[1:12:55] that is facing the trials of Joe it's
[1:12:57] really hard to see God in that situation
[1:13:00] you know even in my old situation as a
[1:13:05] very quick testimony this year has been
[1:13:10] very trying for me and I've lost a lot I
[1:13:15] don't have the car I used to have for
[1:13:19] those of you who don't know I don't have
[1:13:22] the job I used to have I was working at
[1:13:25] a bank and that was stripped away so
[1:13:28] I've lost a lot and in the midst of
[1:13:31] those trials it may be hard to see God
[1:13:34] but I'm grateful for God because I've
[1:13:38] learned that I've loved God even more
[1:13:39] than I did last year or before I had the
[1:13:42] job before out the car those
[1:13:45] materialistic things are not what
[1:13:47] defines my love for Christ it's what God
[1:13:50] has already done the gift of God is
[1:13:53] Christ Christ living on the inside is
[1:13:56] what brings the joy when you're to try
[1:13:58] it when you're being tried you consider
[1:14:00] it all joy and we understand wherever
[1:14:03] God is the devil is there - God brings
[1:14:07] the trials and the devil brings the
[1:14:10] temptation it's ok to be tried but you
[1:14:14] have to recognize when the temptation
[1:14:16] comes so you can flee from when you're
[1:14:20] being tempted
[1:14:21] it is something it's a matter of the
[1:14:24] devil presenting an evil spirit
[1:14:27] something evil to you something that
[1:14:30] takes you away from his word but when
[1:14:32] when God is tempting when God is trying
[1:14:35] you the Bible says that cannot be to do
[1:14:37] it evil but he tries you when that is
[1:14:39] trying you is to prove something that
[1:14:42] you already have
[1:14:44] right something that's already in you
[1:14:47] your blessings your increase your
[1:14:51] clothes you already have God is trying
[1:14:55] you to take you to that place
[1:14:58] that's God's confidence in you
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:05] you see we fellowship our Redemption
[1:15:12] brother Branham says now God had
[1:15:14] confidence and joy he had fellowship
[1:15:18] with him and he knew that Joel could
[1:15:20] trust him so he said alright saying you
[1:15:23] go on ahead he is at your hands but you
[1:15:27] don't take his life you can't you can do
[1:15:29] anything else to him so say I'm good at
[1:15:32] his office away he goes and he kills all
[1:15:34] of jobs children now I want you to
[1:15:37] notice a little something Joel kind of
[1:15:40] had a pre thought of that I believe did
[1:15:42] you notice when his children all of them
[1:15:44] got together one day they had a great
[1:15:47] big banquet in paragraph 182 that says
[1:15:54] that's the reason Christ become human
[1:15:56] that he might know the groans of
[1:15:58] sickness that he might know the
[1:16:00] heartaches and disappointments that he
[1:16:02] that he with us might have fellowship
[1:16:04] together for he has been partaking of
[1:16:07] life like we have of disappointments and
[1:16:10] heartaches and sickness for he bore our
[1:16:12] sickness in our troubles and his own
[1:16:14] body fellowship now Joe endured a lot of
[1:16:20] trials and Satan knew his limitation and
[1:16:24] upon every upon every temptation that
[1:16:26] Satan brought it wasn't it wasn't enough
[1:16:29] to shake job's love for God because the
[1:16:32] very fact that job loved God God knew
[1:16:35] that he could trust Joe and at every
[1:16:38] trial that we face God has to know that
[1:16:41] he can trust us
[1:16:42] before he gives us what he's preparing
[1:16:45] us for and and and I really like the
[1:16:50] testimony of Joe because his own wife
[1:16:52] came and told him that you know just
[1:16:56] forget about everything God has done
[1:16:59] just leave look at what you're going
[1:17:01] through it's not worth it but joe said
[1:17:04] you speaking like a foolish woman
[1:17:06] and Satan knowing that he can't shake
[1:17:10] Joe use his wife to tell
[1:17:14] it and and and that's where the line was
[1:17:18] wrong because job had to recognize that
[1:17:22] his trial was him proving that he was
[1:17:26] still looking for God that he no matter
[1:17:29] what was going to seek God's face and
[1:17:34] his wife was used as a temptation
[1:17:49] trying to get to a point here but
[1:18:02] praise the Lord so speaking on Joe it's
[1:18:08] very fascinating to know that he no
[1:18:13] matter what he was faced with did not
[1:18:16] see his trials but he saw God and we can
[1:18:21] understand that that's what the love of
[1:18:23] God can produce in our lives when we no
[1:18:26] longer look at what we're going through
[1:18:28] but the promises that God has already
[1:18:31] made unto us and and and that's exactly
[1:18:35] what Joe did so the love of God has to
[1:18:45] dwell and every believe is hard if it
[1:18:50] took the love of God to provide an
[1:18:53] everlasting life it's going to take a
[1:18:55] love the love of God to accept it and
[1:18:58] Mille of of God is the very thing that
[1:19:00] drove the heart of God to send Christ we
[1:19:03] understand that so for us we have to be
[1:19:08] continuously dwelling and the love of
[1:19:11] God no matter what the trials are no
[1:19:13] matter what the circumstances are and
[1:19:15] that the fellowship is where God is
[1:19:18] taken it's trying to bring us to a
[1:19:21] fellowship with God to redeem us to take
[1:19:25] us back to what so all that was lost
[1:19:28] because we understand that that before
[1:19:31] God and for God sin Christ
[1:19:33] Adam was in the garden and Adam inherit
[1:19:37] the very the beginning of what God
[1:19:40] intended and now through Christ is the
[1:19:44] fulfillment of God it was God's purpose
[1:19:47] of God's greatest plan of redemption and
[1:19:49] for us now even through this Ministry of
[1:19:56] believing of the message we understand
[1:19:59] that God is taking us to a place of
[1:20:01] perfection
[1:20:01] a place of glory so like I said this
[1:20:10] year has been very trying and I've
[1:20:13] learned to love God
[1:20:15] more so than I ever have and I've
[1:20:20] learned to hold on to all that God has
[1:20:23] done rather than see for other things to
[1:20:27] satisfy my thirst or my hunger because
[1:20:32] whatever God is the devil is there also
[1:20:34] and and my trials are only meant there
[1:20:39] to take me to a greater purpose and
[1:20:41] that's that's that's the cause of it
[1:20:44] I remember brother Jack once said all
[1:20:51] that you all that you go through the
[1:20:55] Christian that God can use the most
[1:20:57] Hebrews the most and God's gonna bruise
[1:21:02] you if you really want to be used in
[1:21:05] that way and I've staff tooken at the
[1:21:09] heart ever since knowing that while God
[1:21:12] he can bruise me it'll be all for his
[1:21:15] glory see God will allow the devil to
[1:21:23] tempt you but he also gives the devil a
[1:21:26] timetable he gives a devil boundaries an
[1:21:30] expiration date
[1:21:31] he puts the step part know that this is
[1:21:35] how far you can go but all that you're
[1:21:39] doing is actually taking my son my
[1:21:42] daughter even further and and and we
[1:21:46] know we know that can be our very
[1:21:48] expectations knowing that God is taking
[1:21:51] us to a higher place continuously
[1:21:53] operating in the love of God that's why
[1:21:57] it's important that we think God for you
[1:21:59] were the little things your prayer
[1:22:03] brother Quentin that that you they pray
[1:22:06] for so long but God was right there he
[1:22:09] knew that you had a hunger and thirst of
[1:22:12] desire for that to be answered and he
[1:22:14] answered it so so we have to be
[1:22:18] sensitive when God is speaking and when
[1:22:19] God is moving because because when he's
[1:22:22] speaking to you he will eventually speak
[1:22:24] through you through somebody else
[1:22:27] god bless you you know Heavenly Father
[1:22:43] Lord Jesus I'm thankful for your love
[1:22:47] Lord operating and your love is all that
[1:22:51] we need Lord father we know that there
[1:22:54] is faith and there's hope but without
[1:22:57] love it's nothing
[1:22:59] god I pray Lord that a heart father was
[1:23:04] blessed by your words I pray that it
[1:23:08] cannot it's not one it doesn't go from
[1:23:11] one year to the other but Lord that we
[1:23:13] can understand that our foundation of
[1:23:15] who we ought to be in you is by loving
[1:23:18] you first by seeking first your kingdom
[1:23:21] father I'm thankful for you Lord even
[1:23:25] for the trials Lord it's all joy in our
[1:23:27] hearts I pray God that you'll continue
[1:23:31] to give us the blessings - over the
[1:23:34] victory through the trials Lord letting
[1:23:37] us know who we are
[1:23:38] and who the devil is bless us O Lord God
[1:23:42] may you provide mercy and grace unto us
[1:23:45] through the weekend
[1:23:47] - Jesus Christ day that we pray amen
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:24:02] god bless you Church I really appreciate
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] everything that God is doing and just
[1:24:11] just trusting that God will continue
[1:24:14] enlarge our coasts take us to a higher
[1:24:17] place and really prepare us prepare us
[1:24:24] for his coming because if we don't have
[1:24:28] love and not operating in his love then
[1:24:31] we don't have anything and I've heard
[1:24:35] and read this once that the greatest
[1:24:37] evidence of the Holy Ghost is to have
[1:24:40] the love of God so the love of God is
[1:24:45] what we ought to be seeking for knowing
[1:24:48] that we have such a gift and that gift
[1:24:50] is Christ and because the gift is Christ
[1:24:53] we are a gift to the world because we're
[1:24:57] still here and we're all the light of
[1:24:59] the world
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:19] let's give the Lord a hand of praise for
[1:25:22] brother Gary that scripted any brought
[1:25:32] their out of sector that's lobbyist
[1:25:37] let's just read that second
[1:25:43] Thessalonians chapter 2 in the first 10
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] see here
[1:25:53] [Music]
[1:26:03] with all deceivableness of
[1:26:05] unrighteousness and then that perish
[1:26:10] because they receive the love of the
[1:26:16] truth that they might be saved
[1:26:19] so salvation actually came through the
[1:26:21] truth right you can't reject the truth
[1:26:26] and then actually think you're gonna be
[1:26:28] saved right so here it goes I'm sayin
[1:26:31] and for this cause God shall send them
[1:26:36] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:26:39] a lie
[1:26:43] because I want to say that they all
[1:26:45] might be damned who believed not the
[1:26:48] truth but had pleasure in
[1:26:51] unrighteousness I say lord have mercy
[1:26:53] and I think this is more relevant for
[1:26:56] our day
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:58] Paul wrote these things and we're seeing
[1:27:01] the manifestation of that but you know
[1:27:03] we have to continue to operate in the
[1:27:05] love of God understanding that it is
[1:27:08] them and love is going to cause us to
[1:27:10] obey His commandments and life is obey
[1:27:13] it but love love to actually do what God
[1:27:17] you know called us to do I remember that
[1:27:20] the story of the lady she was married to
[1:27:25] her husband and he would leave little
[1:27:27] notes around the house and say do this
[1:27:29] do this do this do this all the time
[1:27:33] from her crazy she hated seeing them
[1:27:36] notes and that husband died and she got
[1:27:41] remarried to another husband she liked
[1:27:43] thank God and got to see the notes
[1:27:44] around here no more I mean this this guy
[1:27:47] loved me more than the other guy loved
[1:27:49] me and I ain't got good notes like they
[1:27:51] just drop they was driving me crazy
[1:27:53] one day she was up in the attic cleaning
[1:27:55] out and she saw the little notes around
[1:27:57] and she said yeah I thank God
[1:27:59] this thing is gone thank God I gotta
[1:28:00] worry about that no mo and come to find
[1:28:02] out that the reason that she have to
[1:28:05] worry about the notes is because what
[1:28:07] the first husband was leaving her to do
[1:28:09] had actually become part of her and she
[1:28:11] was already doing it right so the second
[1:28:13] husband didn't have to leave any notes
[1:28:15] and when it become part of it it showed
[1:28:17] that she loved doing what she was doing
[1:28:19] right and and and when we when we get
[1:28:22] there the love of God or the word of God
[1:28:24] really in our hearts it's not Grievous a
[1:28:27] man is not something that oh I wish I
[1:28:29] didn't have to do it okay you know there
[1:28:31] used to be a time where I didn't have a
[1:28:32] love of God in me and I hated coming to
[1:28:34] church but when I got the love of God in
[1:28:38] me I couldn't wait to get through the
[1:28:39] church doors all right
[1:28:41] hey man and I want nothing coming in the
[1:28:44] way I mean if we're not when I didn't
[1:28:45] have a love of God I struggled with
[1:28:47] football on Friday Night Football game
[1:28:50] on church but when I got the love of God
[1:28:52] I ain't thinking about the football game
[1:28:53] I was ready to go to church right it's
[1:28:56] something about when you get the love of
[1:28:58] God not because somebody making you do
[1:29:00] it but because you love him everything
[1:29:03] is based off of that love I tell you
[1:29:06] that that's just that's just wonderful
