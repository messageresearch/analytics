of God and cars before they marry and then what a lovely day it is to be saved in there anyway we started to appreciate all the songs and I will see a thing else Amen it's just a good atmosphere not that I don't want to see but hey I think that sweet-smelling savour is going up before God so we want to just tap right into that and get into the Word of God today amen how many expected something you know you get what you expect you know and I said everything we're doing you get what you expect you got to have the right attitude a man you can't come to church hold down and out and feeling sorry for yourself you know you're getting a lot of service but if you come knowing that your God can do anything then the soldiers will be different Amen cuz you have an expectation but it's good to be here we certainly appreciate all of you it's good to see everybody Amen y'all know Florida is like a second home to me and we just appreciate being here the agreements from anywhere back home and our let's just have a word of Prayer we'll get into the scripture this morning maybe you have an unspoken of a question acknowledged to caller by an uplifted hand and man let's just pray Lord Jesus father we lift our hands to You Lord and if you don't do anything else you've done enough lord I know you you healed us you saved us you can live with us Lord everything that we stand in need of you are so notice we lift our hands Oh father we lift our hands and faith knowing that you see the desires of our heart Lord but we pray our design coincide with your perfect wheel nor that we don't want anything lower that you don't want for us so Lord we pray Lord that our motive an objective is its right to take Lord and discern our hearts by your word morning don't let us just be a spectator this morning but we're here when we're here because there's a purpose in our lives there's there's something that we're looking for that's something that we're desiring the hunger in our thirsting after law and we know that the answer is in you so long we prayed you move all flesh out the way that we would connect spirit to spirit so Lord we just ask father that you just make yourself known Lord bless it's never heartless here lloyd's and every family in its life the Lord be with the past in his absence Lord be with him Lord as he brings forth the word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you amen and maybe you have your Bibles best turn to Genesis 18 Genesis the 18th chapter ma'am Genesis 18 and lest I read that verse my verse hey let's start at verse e-letter go to God you have a saved man now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old so I have pleasure with my lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord hey man let's go to John chapter 3 say John chapter 3 I just want to read a verse out of here this list out of verse 5 and jesus answered say John 3 and 5 and jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit it is spirit a mail order blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seat this morning y'all have to pray funny because God is changing my fault right now so I don't know no better but just to go with God Eggman so I'm just gonna go with it hallelujah I mean I got some stuff here but I feel like God want to tie this in so imma just go with this man my title as I was reading the scripture he came to me just now my title is did I stutter did I stutter hey man and may my subtitles when I was originally gonna preach is God cannot deny himself he meant but if you think about the format or stuttering hey man you know it can't quite be understood or it can't quite come out somebody's trying to say something and it's not coming it's not flowing right but when we think of God God does not stop God knows exactly what he wants to sing and he will say it amen you know and when right here when I was reading the scripture when we think about Abraham and Sarah God told Abraham first he said you're gonna have a son and the son is gonna be by Sarah and Abraham laughs in chapter 17 amen Abraham laughs first you know so God comes back around and he says the same thing to Abraham says the same thing to Sarah so what was God saying God was saying when I said that see the first time running stone what I said I meant a man and judge we need to take God at His Word God is not in the business of repeating himself when he said it the first time he's done stands alone hallelujah so what we ought to do is go in the scriptures and take Godhead his water if he said it before he make it and let's realize this God cannot change her lujah he's always the same if he was God that did he's got now hi Elia such if we were if we will just take God but whatever he said we live up in the devil God created God has this memory man that knows everything about him holy there's nothing the devil can do that will make gosh you know if somebody's fellows normally they come of God for the oh-ho or they're surprised there's nothing Satan can do the catch God by surprise there's no failure there's no father's don't see that you can commit that will make gosh oh yeah church his path of death hundred his confident in his word but not only that he's confident in you hallelujah he's confident in your life hallelujah but we know when when we welcome trials and tribulation you know things happen sometimes we we start our honey but when it comes to the reality of realizing who you serve your words become playing my god is awesome my god is real my god is a deliverer hallelujah hell yeah he has no rivals oh yeah he has equals a man there's nothing holy that can even challenge God oh yeah that will make God stutter but when we look at the word we need to go back around and look at how God dealt with people that stuttered when he told them something God told Moses I have called you to go and bring the people out and Moses taught stuttering I hope you don't know your book now Moses time saying little alone I can't act kkkk I can't talk no this digit of the God where you can receive me there tell Moses Moses leave AJ mouth so basically God will tell him Moses I'm gonna talks are you a man the Bible said unto us what'd you do I got a church in here this morning oh I gotta turn to you this morning who knows what God is back to them so I've been sick I've been down and out but the Word of God always shows itself to be strong honey God always shows himself to be an on time dog when doctors say that there is no way huh hurry God says I am the way funnier would it look like the skies are cloudy God says I am the light I am The Sun I am the keeper I am the maker that I am let's realize who we serve but when we when I think about this this is this original this original topic I was think about God denying himself just look at if God ever made a promise he has to be obligated to his word now God told that told Adam and Eve he said hey you give or take of every tree in the garden just don't just this one the day you eat up you should surely die now we know what took place but let's look at title you being a part of God how many of you in here today believe that you're a part of God I don't know about you but I say to myself Satan has no hold over me that's the way I talk honey I don't walk around saying oh the devil beat me up and all the devil's us to deal with that the devil can't do nothing but what God Allah the devil can't do nothing in your life but what you accept in your life the mind is the battleground the mind is a place where you become straight even right now you haven't touched in your mind and you thinking about you nothing is sure but if you begin to think in yourself God is talking to me I guarantee the supernatural will start coming your way [Music] we waste too much time entertaining stuff that I'm not eternal Gazza eternal God hallelujah he he knows exactly how to get our attention and you know Church about think about this I said you know God told him in school he said the day you eat up I'm a king he meant that he didn't stop but I want to show you something so powerful when it comes to God Amen he totally taught me he said the day you eat on Mikey he he didn't leave any reason he didn't even start honey he didn't leave a way out you eat you die didn't stop you seeing you got you don't believe you got that's what God said but I wanna show you something new more powerful than what God seen oh my god let me let me say like the Pentecostal preacher yeah oh don't hit me I ain't got no chart up in here so God said God said oh we got to learn how to get God's attention in there God said then you eat up I'm a kid amen you don't really die man and you know I didn't see at that time he was talking about their flesh because there wasn't flesh they were spirit hallelujah adamandeva spirit beings higher yeah and God said the day you eat up you shall surely die we thought that today we spoke that in spirit he created a body good body but let's go into chips from there amen he's the serpent stop talking to us start talking to her / darden already talked to the spirit now the devil come he talked to her flesh her Leah did you did you did you did that God sing stop listening to the devil he can't even get his words together don't you know I've said it before don't we know as believers that the devil Satan Lucifer himself he doesn't even have his own vocabulary everything he says is a perversion of what God has already said he comes to him didn't God say honey why did he come and say I see on g-good he ain't got my words of his own you you look at your life you watch your life you watch even right now what he's doing to you in your mind he's trying to get you not to accept what I'm saying he's trying to twist around I'm saying your blessing you come and say but what about this what um what about that earlier though my search they get to the place where each she begins to be entertained by the enemy she entertained by the enemy and from there hallelujah she starts to enter into another place she starts to back in denial and the worst thing you can do is walk in denial when you know you're not living according to what God wants you to live a man you know and you know why I'm here I'm I just go south I begin to think about you know the way the world is set up and you know I used to be in the world but you don't realize how do you sometimes will you put eight things you don't realize what's really going on you know they got they got different musicians and singers and all these things and you know a lot of times entertainment is not about the voice for the music entertainment is about the movement let me let me come home a little bit honey hey man let me come home a little bit Beyonce ain't the greatest singer in the world she's one of the greatest dancers earlier and see her dancing is what gets everybody's attention I am oh she can see now you watch the next group of women coming up oh yeah cardi B was a stripper a dancer ho yeah and now she's one of the most popular women it is that's walking her face on the earth how does she get her clean your fame the pole and you watch out you watch out at singles Oh what babe Michael Jackson so popular never meant to same but it was all about the movement attention what made Elvis so breathtaking it was the dancing the movement hungry let me Sanchez it is a perversion because dancing is a sign of fake to me and what Satan has come he's tried to take the dancing out of the church who's trying to steal a victory that's what the popular dog says a dancing is a kind of victory and Satan is coming you tried to give that to the world it don't belong but I show you honey from their point of view it's of curse because there's a spirit behind it in me if you want I love you watch in the Bible remember who wrote his daughter and then she went before the king is she and she dances she whipped it up she broke it down she Nene's kkj days she did it all she wobbled she bobbled honey she Electric Slide she did it all honey and she got the Kings attention and once you paralyzed the Kings mind by his eyes it was amazing it was what he saw but we're going down here today we've got some dancers and you got some people looking in the mirror and bringing it down hallelujah you be careful there's a spirit behind your movement it makes you going somewhere hungry and you love to be entertained you like you show me who like to see the women drop it like it's hot there's a spirit that you better deny that spirit honey but you know she did and she dares me she got the Kings attention in the key like hello like oh you have without a it won't because she danced it wasn't a voice it was it was her dancing honey than what they call a queen bee she can have whatever she want okay sir I got pretty riders coming I got cleaning I can say to you buy this honey you look at some of the most powerful superstars what they call superstar their dances uh sure Chris Brown I'm going on and on honey but you know you don't see she she begins to dance and she did all these things earlier so what was behind the movement what was behind the movement at that time of her dance was death because the request was okay how my dance before you won she hypnotized the king the King under her spell of Dance he said you can have whatever you go how you and she didn't want the phone she didn't want the money she wants to stop them 19 she wanted to stop the anointing that was in the place at that time and the anointing was on John the Baptist hurry up and she said hi turn in a charter you know take one dance for that honey so I wonder if that spirit rules back then is it still the same spirit how still the same spirit that's moving a man but you know just from there hallelujah you know we look at Adam and Eve and God told them you know don't don't don't partake of the don't even whatever and he was real confident at that time she's like hey he said don't eat it don't even touch it she was so she was so into what God said she added some things II you know sometimes we good when we got under pressure but when pressure come the real you go come on honey the real heart if we want to say where it ends will come out with a hurricane coming the real citizens of Florida will show themselves when a hurricane come on snow bars they're going back up to New York they got caught up in the Maryland Virginia I know places honey because they wasn't born and raised in the place they weren't born and raised seeing the spellemann' I always take no offence on anything but you know how people will change location but that's not who they really are they're living in denial huh and you know Church they they they they they you know I remember I think it was 2006 or something like that I was down here and hurricane did salute and it blew me away because the winds were so strong was having some meetings at brother Wesco the winds were so strong now my shirt was doing like and we're going to church I was doing and the real believers know that there's some good things that can come out of a stall if in many of years the Hurricanes came and some powerful things came out of the existence of a hurricane and now we're we were eating off the food tight enough of what that hurricane produced amen a hurricane was coming years ago he was beating upon the house stories are blowing y'all wouldn't hit me with an artful entry force but y'all think that is my rice and came from it came from a shooter who wasn't in denial well sometimes our little spoon come from rings you can come out gonna take a stronger wind in this see real believers they know what I'm talking about they may who are talking about hope everybody else that's living in denial a running around like your hair is coming like a Cheeto the Hurricanes here Perkins did this was to sit in the house with a pineal eye hey Bronson pick up the pen and write because why is trouble out there i'ma give you something to bless the inside I will give you something for the people of God I will give you something that we're stuck this pawn can't keep me from my promises y'all get a hold on I'm gonna be there took a phrase break up in here a little bit huh see I got I got my own picture what heaven is gonna be like I'm gonna get dad I ain't gonna be just sitting down Sara honey I'm gonna be standing on my feet and I will be rocking how will be moving honey I'm be saying I made it honey goodness we're Hezekiah Walker we go Oh heaven is gonna be a celebration they gonna be a time to worry and they gonna be a time of denial oh yeah it's gonna be a time of certainty and can you imagine us you and I who are born in the worst time it is oh yeah will you when you're comparing seeing of the days of old we've got laws that are complete denial you got me and denying women a min or not you got women deny whether women are not hood did not stop for you all that you are he knows exactly what he's doing aromatisse bombers female parts man is more with God did not start our stuff is coming from people who are living in denial and they when you live in denial you're an angry person I was telling the same story last night I was in Chicago and I landed and Chicago and you know we had to get out bags a conveyor belt was broke so they took Susan said they took everybody bag and just do it on top of a just take all the bags and don't want to convey so I'm on the bag thing that's not working so it was total chaos everybody's throwing bags and snatcher Baxter I never seen her like this before Huglin I thought I was in a movie but you know everybody was snatching bags and throwing back and everything out you know I'm trying to get home I was just coming back from Canada you know I'm trying to get home with everybody and you know sometimes you see a mess you see things going on there's something about you that say hey I ain't getting in the middle i'ma wait hurry I'm gonna wait to my change [Applause] pick up today you know they say in the world when a person is competent and they know where they got they say go start know people who yeah they go starting over they weren't expecting them to do what they did and they did it anyway like in a face oh yeah but we need to do it today we need to start on the camel honey cuz the devil that we broke down we said we in the middle of battle when according to God I got the victory sorry look like I shouldn't give God praise like I shouldn't clap my hands on the devil today it's funny because sometimes you talk to yo peoples talking they're like they all know what you talking about excitedly typing real religious ones you talked in English cuz he when they get out of church I'd always go with you I was a partner baby tears up partner you talk that talking man but we gotta talk we got a word that's unbreakable oh yeah but you know let me get like just take the whole belt was broke so not Church hugs God knows how to separate you from chaos so I come around the corner I see all these bags throw it up everybody on the bills fighting and all the stuff pulling stuffing I'm like whoa and I'm staking myself and a plan start coming to my mind if I miss my plane imma go to look ya'll Belt wasn't working so y'all better find your connection it ain't my fault I'm mister playing y'all stuff wasn't working right and sometimes you need to tell the devil hallelujah Amen it ain't up to you whether I call that God is in containers honey it may look like honey the things I eat total chaos but God is the peace of beach sanya he's the Prince of Peace in a so anyway church honey I grant look I look around how do you everybody's doing anything and I just look to the right it wasn't no way near the trouble my possession but no way near the trouble my possession but knowing near the trial my possession wasn't no way chaos and would I be ransom to say today whatever you needed no way never demo hey Mia I got my bag okay but it was a confusion so I went up to a guy who's in denial Phoebe all of I was in denial because first of all you didn't talk like a woman look like a woman he thought he did but he did a man can recognize a man oh we got to look at big old without him down take it they can do they can do six changes body changes all you want you can't cut the Apple out then you put on some high heels you put a dress who put on nails on a wig but you can't get rid of that the Apple don't stay down further and their voice was telling why are you doing oh yeah you know III think about this thing they fight about all these rights and everything they fight about women fighting of a window rights man fighting evil means right and all the stuffing and when what is it really for it's the power of denial and you know trusting they didn't like it like the women fight fighting again they got bathroom laws they fight about they fight the women the women say the woman that's claiming to be a man in denial saying I want to go in the bathroom with me so what just to say you can but look at it they think they're winning honey but they're living in denial they win the case earlier they get the right to go in to get the right to go into the bathroom as a man and then when she get in there she use it like a woman that history is living in denial starving as she go in my father used to starve us I can't deny you're something else cousin it's like a person then only God and coming to church like God need them so she fight all the fight she hang a bag down get a face better than mine and pimp in the bathroom don't call me some method on me my name is Pham and she get in there and she all him being standing at the stall and she get in there she go right to the spoon because she's a woman so what she's fighting for should never be able to obtain she never really really be able to be what she thinks she wants to be she's just living a mirage she's just living in denial she can cut a half shake it in the cheese she can get that food she knew all that stuff sack that britches put on some John's but at the end of the day she's a woman and the man can do the same thing he says well God made me this way liar and he can put on his high-heeled punch with a size 10 shoe you don't see no women with feet that big size 15 and 16 hallelujah 9 feet I mean I was gonna say 9 feet tall cuz you take a man 6 9 trying to wear a miniskirt and some pumps he can't change that that's who he is but if he's living in the now you put all this stuff on wigs all the stuff hallelujah it feel like hey hey I want to be a woman you know because I'm attracted to what women do and I'm gonna gestures like a woman because that's why I'm tired of living in denial line today self you know you do all lazy I want to go in the bathroom with you in it so you know what he does he does the same thing the woman does he can only put his pump so put on his skirt his dress or whatever here's look at this church I'm gonna show you the power perversion now you know Satan how do you take the people that estate and make them dress wrong and then the purple honey that's really not straight your dress right where we often see the homosexuals in a dress because their testify of what a woman suspicion should really look like but then God before for their sake now come and tell the real women hey no comparison no some booga-booga a little and there's some capris and all the stuff and you look like a man but when the man who are me and I look like a woman they just like a woman one of my friends say he's they heard somebody from down south shout hallelujah they said hallelujah not y'all your hallelujah but you know church you look at the powers of denial and where people are stuttering with a life trying to be what they are you take this man with the album's out for six foot nine size thirteen foot with a minister at all Oh fair enough to look like a bear he kid up an install thinking he would get in there and study usually like a number using like a man and why he's used it like a man and women coming in saying what in the world I let up in here come on the car police we got a man in here posing as a woman denial oh my let me finish this man I see him he's all dressed up and all this stuff denial to my living in denial oh this stuttering you know I give my bag I say I need to get another ticket oh I don't know they angry what is angry because they're trying to be something they're not and they're not accept it they want to be accepted that's why these LPG communities and all these different communities they start to fight with us and we delay my mama said I ain't stuntin them I start none up ain't even a word I start numb really really a come from studying but you just put s T you stuck but in a way he was just real I don't know I knew I would be asking well look at your paperwork I say you the one who work here not me so he just being all mean and being all nasty but you know I was telling the Saints the last night that they called me nice nasty listen they see you can see the Asti stuck in a nice way don't get mad don't fuss don't holler go don't argue lettin just use the word of God but in this case I want to use the Bible honey I wanted to get to him another way honey hey man y'all forgive me for saying this but sometimes you get in your flesh we are all human he hit a nerve he was being mean to me for no reason I'm not him up either trying to catch my flight sister Brown and he giving me attitude and I wanted him to do is do his job well I never seen her because then I'm not eyes he was a man I was talking to a man and he's all merit because I'm not accepting who he is he's daddy sassing me and I don't know what you think you need to do this you need to do that I said okay get you once I get my bag my tickets and all that I'm gonna get you you don't know you'll hear from me you know what once I got hired my stuff he was like well dad you go I got my stuff make sure it was in my hand then just before you get your product don't use a cup before you get your blessing you gotta get some blessing first before you show up and it was just gonna be real simple I just gonna let him know I know I know who you are why you care no time to be something else yet in denial I know what I was looking at you couldn't fool me I wasn't stuttering oh yeah so what I did was he got he gave me all my stuff and he put his head on the hip gave me attitude or what I was once I got all my stuff got my bag cuz I appreciate your breath you didn't need no way I'm doing y'all y'all complete probably one behind me but it was too late I had my stuff and I was dull I go below y'all know I love the enjoy a church I don't believe in all this religious cold dead stuff I believe in joint celebrating God hallelujah look we know the story Eve she listens to the devil she put takes up the fruit that God said you do it on Mikey but I want to show you how powerful holy life is God can say something hallelujah but life can be even more powerful with God see that's what I say I rather you not preach me a sermon but live me why because sometimes people can say things like the amount but they life is doing something different honey so eat in the end in the midst of all that honey Eve honey she for takes of the fruit and she said this is good and I'm gonna give some mother now Adam wouldn't deceive having knew full well what he was doing you know what he was doing he was stepping into the role of a redeemer because I want you to understand Adam was a god he had the mind of God so he knew what God was gonna do before he did [Music] the Bible say he was created in the image and likeness of God he was a God for you so he knew the thoughts of God he knew God was on his way to kill his wife so Adams say I can't let him kill her so I'm gonna protect her this food because God can't kill himself [Music] so Adam injected the seat of God in his wife which was able and if God would have killed Abel in a bit like hunting if you to kill Eve it'll be like God killing himself and he cannot deny himself hallelujah that's a powerful life here's a man when you get the Holy Spirit in you becoming team with God God cannot deny you he has to give you what he would give himself and God wants to bless him God wants to celebrate him amen that's what you need to tell say today man I come from God that's why when Sarah left haruya seven land God oh yeah the probably God say he should have killed her right there but if he would have killed her he would have been killing himself because he said honey bye sorry you're gonna have a child hurry up and if God would have killed Sarah here have been killing his promise so you know what you need to do when you're going through you need to start rehearsing the Word of God because God cannot deny his words a man he has to hardly respond to that word he cannot cheat on her because he's saying amen and you know from daring man Sarah and Abraham they go there living a life hit on a man and God told him to do this and do that you know II get it get all the way two years nothing happened and one day serve got taken earlier but God couldn't let it happen like that because it wasn't just the fact of Serbian Sarah and Abraham Abraham God was protecting his word because he didn't stop he said you don't have a son but sir funny so when Sarah got taken by dremel a God had to show up and straighten out because life was just as powerful as what he spoke that's what I want you to understand church no matter what the devil is doing if you're living the right kind of life God has to respond in your face [Music] I'm glad a couple y'all know where I met her he has to respond to himself we have to believe that we are a part of God yeah my mama's soon or my daddy is James but really I'm a part of God because God put those two together just to produce me because he knew I was gonna be finally a part of him earlier some God had to put them he couldn't deny them to because to bring for me and there are some things in your family you're letting them eat this record I mean this is as simple as I can say it I'm gonna beat you much longer that's simply y'all know I'm about to close so you know hallelujah you know just just you can see God in nature and then you take a tree a tree cannot deny his roots that's why we have family reunions we have ancestors and all the stuff uglier because what does it do is fix of your roots and you can't no matter how dark you mean maybe I liked you maybe you cannot deny your room we had we had a man uh who was governor whatever he was in Carolina and you know what he was aa bigoted me do you know the meaning yeah he had his own ways hey they did his issue you know he's kind of racist they did his ancestry and all that come to find out he had some black in no matter how mad he died he couldn't change where he came from oh yeah that's one thing about Satan he cannot change the route he cannot change where you come from and if we would just be the home where we come from weird box the devil out of the church we come from God you can treat your night the night his route did you come from alabaster huh huh I come from God Africa is a place that's gone parish I come from a place that's eternal oh my brother comes the motherland know I come from heaven you know so people can't give that because I got these images in the amount of black history Pookie have amazing huh stole it that ain't my roots are not the Civil War my roots oh yeah is when God said let it be and it was oh hey you got a little Bob what's going on there is down thankful for what we have accomplished in it but there's a bigger picture there's a bigger picture huh with certain positive America will let me in then I go to my real roots and I play God open doors that will come that's not a day for me that's what I'm talking about when you know where you come from stop living in denial can you imagine walking in the restaurant listen no we don't feed your Konya so me thought you do that now you don't I'm gonna get channel news 57 years you don't let me see cuz you know you got right and I'm here to say to them today you need to let the devil know you got rights you can't just mess up your home that's what your children that's what your old ones hey man you got a right the gutter guard impaired and Sena I declare war on the devil we get used we get used to losing we accept the ballot don't work out with yeah I guess what my God's will how you know that we need to be like Joshua Joshua didn't live in denial he will shoot God told him we're able to solo your feasts are trained I'm given to you for position searching he would never against a lie hallelujah and the people start stirring they lost the battle and jostle didn't stir one means a hold of something everybody this passion free the other side I was going on I know my God told me God spoke to me talk and he didn't stop so Joshua we got in plans found out that they were saying in the camp he's okay we're gonna deal with the Synod after we deal with it we won't go back and fight the same people that beat us up I know what God said to me hallelujah if you didn't mess up something get it right and I guarantee you the promise of God and still they're waiting on you still there waiting on you because God don't start a hurry oh god don't live in denial when he said a lot of times the problem is us Joshua was so sure what God said he was in the middle of a battle he's looking at the enemy fighting and then he had a salt he had a thought saying the Sun go down they're gonna regroup and you're gonna lose the battle but then he had another thought that's against what I told you I told you that you wherever you go you will win so Solomon I mean I mean Josh will begin to think what can I do to make sure honey this work of the past like God say so he's looking at the battle honey listening to the promise hungry looking at the enemy hurry up so some way in the middle of that hurry Leah something came to him in his heart that said God seen God saying honey giving it to you for possession so in the middle of that battle Joshua did something that he didn't know he was capable of denial will stop you from moving into things that you've never done before just take God at His Word so Joshua in the middle of a lady says thanks fun stand still I don't know about y'all but I never knew the son had ears I never knew the son could hear I never knew that the moon had a minor or feet to stop but right there he's an Josh's was so on point he told the moon where to stand hang over the valley allows hey know who he is but what was that that was that part of God that couldn't be denied God can not deny himself when you know who you are in the word oh yeah in Joshua Joshua was so sold out just when they get on the other side Josh was praying and a man stands before him with a sword and Josh in life I don't know who you are but God told me wherever I go I got victory now you better identify himself cuz you don't we go and I know I'm gonna go read your Bible Joshua didn't stop and he was talking to God the authority that the capital host hurry he's standing right there looking God's things are right in the face and say hey you me are you against me he didn't start with me he nearly lost that's what we need to do to the enemy we need to look for so how can I be sick when I got did you do how can it happen when it's said by stripes I'm healed oh my church that's what helped me when I was in the hospital with cancer in my brain I had a word - come to me this advice like she healed and doctors came in to say you need to take this chemo radiation all this stuff or you gonna die but the Scriptures saying you know I had an angel come in just like Joshua yeah hey man this angels aka mama honey she came in with the scripture came in with the words he said you don't have to accept this honey God has sent a word in our day to let us know who we are 15 years old hallelujah God was putting the sword in my hand huh hey man you know what happened trust I didn't start a hallelujah the doctors came back and I said I ain't taking your chemo they say what you mean I say the Bible says I'm healed they say the Bible know we got x-rays you got the council you got to do that say I'm healed hey Katie I'm healed we start hollering I say on the hill they say this is not a game this is not a game you can die you can be a vegetable he didn't stop so he start pressing me pressing me to tears came out of my eyes and it looked like I was weak honey but there was something way down on the inside the matter of my special crying kids was coming down my hide but something in my heart said look him in the face and say I still they gonna take people even though tears coming down my eyes even though it may look
