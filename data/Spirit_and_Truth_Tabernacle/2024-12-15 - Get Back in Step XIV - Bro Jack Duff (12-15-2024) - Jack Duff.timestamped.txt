[54:51] our journey through um get back in Step
[54:55] this is something the Lord has um um
[54:59] called us to this year that was
[55:02] our um theme but the inspiration
[55:06] underneath the theme is I will restore
[55:09] sayith the Lord amen and um I believe
[55:13] the the Lord certainly has uh been
[55:16] bringing us back in step in so many ways
[55:20] but um uh I know that God got so much
[55:22] more in store as I read a few things
[55:24] here to you this morning I I'm I'm I'm
[55:28] placing you under um uh prophecy and
[55:32] expectation and uh you know we just got
[55:35] to look forward to seeing what God is
[55:37] not not I know that God will do it I
[55:40] know God has done it and God will do
[55:42] more uh but we got to stay in a place
[55:45] where we can allow God to do amen what
[55:48] he wants to do in us there's there's
[55:49] certain things that has been spoken uh
[55:52] Over Us in scripture and this this
[55:54] restoration is I believe I I didn't see
[55:57] it like this before but I believe this
[55:59] is a scripture for our time amen it's a
[56:02] scripture for our day I believe Joel was
[56:05] speaking of us when he uh when he wrote
[56:08] this uh and there is many that have no
[56:11] idea what these what these things are
[56:12] saying but uh but for you know just as
[56:15] the Lord's been showing us this year
[56:16] this is this is a bride scripture sir
[56:19] amen there were scriptures in in the
[56:22] Bible uh that Jesus needed to fulfill
[56:25] there were script in the Bible amen that
[56:28] John the Baptist would have come to
[56:30] fulfill amen there were scriptures in
[56:33] the Bible and which we'll go through
[56:35] some of them today but uh even brother
[56:37] brandom had to fulfill but glory to God
[56:40] there comes a time where you have to
[56:41] look into the scripture a little bit
[56:43] High a little bit of high a little bit
[56:44] of high give me a little bit of high uh
[56:46] you have to look in the scripture and
[56:47] you have to see that no this part is for
[56:51] me sir you all remember the story that
[56:54] the prophet told of the boy going up up
[56:56] the stairs at his relative's house I
[56:59] think it was either Grandma Auntie but
[57:01] one of the relatives and he's walking up
[57:03] the stairs and we get to the top of the
[57:05] stairs that boy begin to wave his hand
[57:09] and uh he'd do this and he'd look and he
[57:11] say the thing uh that he was looking at
[57:13] was also waving his hand and he would do
[57:15] it and he wave his hand this way and
[57:17] said man that thing doing the same thing
[57:18] I'm doing and he he had never seen
[57:21] anything like this he was coming from
[57:23] the country into the City and the very
[57:24] first time he come in contact with a
[57:27] mirror praise God and when he come in
[57:30] contact with a mirror he he got a
[57:32] startling Revelation amen and the
[57:35] starting Revelation he told his Mama say
[57:37] Mama that is me and here what I'm seeing
[57:42] a startling Revelation when I look at
[57:44] Joel chapter 2 praise God there's a
[57:48] startling Revelation that pops out
[57:50] through the mirror of the word of God
[57:52] and I say mama that that right there
[57:59] me that's my scripture Joel wrote about
[58:03] me I am the restoration I'm part of the
[58:08] restoration I'm living in restoration
[58:11] day glory to God and and if if I'm
[58:14] living in restoration day I'm not
[58:16] supposed to lose
[58:18] nothing because I'm under
[58:20] restoration everything that the devil

[1:02:02] question now it's going to be an
[1:02:05] answer I I need to know what what Ive
[1:02:08] never seen anything like this what is
[1:02:09] this well well we you know honestly I
[1:02:13] just be honest say you know we we
[1:02:14] believe according to the scripture amen
[1:02:17] that God sent us a sent a prophet
[1:02:19] according to Malachi 4 just like uh uh
[1:02:21] he sent John the Baptist he sent for the
[1:02:24] first coming he sent another Prophet for
[1:02:25] the second coming and that Ministry was
[1:02:27] the ministry of William Mary and Brandon
[1:02:29] and uh and I said but that's right there
[1:02:31] in the in the Bible and there's many
[1:02:32] other scriptures that that kind of point
[1:02:33] to this so we just we just followed that
[1:02:35] he said well what is it called what is
[1:02:37] it what what's this movement called I
[1:02:39] said it's the message say it's the en
[1:02:41] time message it's like well I ain't
[1:02:43] never heard of this in my life so he he
[1:02:45] said well what are the things that you
[1:02:46] know what what what what's going I say
[1:02:48] well the message is to return our hearts
[1:02:50] back to the word that's all it's just to
[1:02:52] bring us back to the word say let's just
[1:02:53] take for example water baptism
[1:02:56] how does the church baptize I say I say
[1:02:59] you know the church um you know they
[1:03:01] they they baptize in the name of the
[1:03:02] father name of the son and of the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost right I said but Peter 10 days
[1:03:06] after Jesus told him to do that Peter
[1:03:08] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ I said now did Peter have it
[1:03:11] wrong or did Peter have it right so what
[1:03:14] Peter got is the revelation of what the
[1:03:16] name of the father was what the name of
[1:03:19] the son was and what the name of the
[1:03:20] Holy Spirit was I said when he got that
[1:03:23] then he knew baptized in the name of the
[1:03:24] Lord Jesus Christ now we're coming back
[1:03:26] to truth yes sir say well he say so so I
[1:03:30] just learned you know just people have
[1:03:32] differences and you know and and and it
[1:03:34] it is what it is you know I mean people
[1:03:36] can't help it you know just just love
[1:03:37] them anyway long as they got saved I say
[1:03:39] I I I I get you I get you I totally
[1:03:42] understand I said but you know the only
[1:03:43] problem is um you know God going to
[1:03:46] judge us based on his word and we got to
[1:03:48] live according to his word so he he he
[1:03:51] say he said well I I I understand he
[1:03:53] says he said what's what's y'all
[1:03:54] thoughts about the the church as a whole
[1:03:56] I mean you know the way you looking at
[1:03:58] it what's your thoughts about the whole
[1:03:59] church I say the church so you got to
[1:04:01] look at it according to Revelation 3 I
[1:04:04] said according to Revelation 3 the
[1:04:06] church has put
[1:04:09] Jesus and according to the Bible Jesus
[1:04:12] is standing at his own church knocking
[1:04:16] trying to get back
[1:04:17] in and then he go on and say he say well
[1:04:20] yeah he says uh and if any man would o
[1:04:23] If any man would open the door then
[1:04:24] he'll come in and S I said said but wait
[1:04:26] now if any man that's an individual so
[1:04:30] the church as a whole will not accept
[1:04:32] this I said let me give you just another
[1:04:34] one just give give you one where we got
[1:04:36] off the word let me just give you one
[1:04:37] real real easy one I said now the Bible
[1:04:41] tell us that a woman not supposed to
[1:04:44] preach he say I agree with that I agree
[1:04:47] with that I I ain't never I ain't never
[1:04:49] never agree with that I I say I say but
[1:04:51] you you you um you let me go tell some
[1:04:54] of these famous women preachers that the
[1:04:57] Bible say they not supposed to preach
[1:04:58] what you think they'll they they'll look
[1:04:59] at me and
[1:05:01] say I I I I I say you just call the
[1:05:04] names he start calling names I don't
[1:05:05] want to call the people names online but
[1:05:07] you know them women preachers out there
[1:05:08] big big time women preachers huge
[1:05:12] congregations right Hallelujah but uh
[1:05:15] but he he say I said but that's against
[1:05:17] the word of God I say I said this is why
[1:05:19] the bible say that they're blind they're
[1:05:21] wretched they're naked they're miserable
[1:05:23] and they don't even know it
[1:05:26] and then they got so much money that you
[1:05:29] can't tell them nothing I said but this
[1:05:31] is prophecy according to scripture they
[1:05:33] can't help theel they fulfilling the
[1:05:35] prophecy of the
[1:05:36] scripture man I took them all through I
[1:05:39] took them and showed them the seven
[1:05:40] angels the cloud he we were working then
[1:05:43] I then I I had I had one more to leave
[1:05:46] him
[1:05:47] with he said he say you know what what
[1:05:49] else I say well what happened in the
[1:05:52] Garden of Eden
[1:05:57] you feel
[1:06:01] connected I'mma just I mean look
[1:06:03] sometimes you got to throw it out there
[1:06:04] to see if it'll strike he and what he
[1:06:06] say he say he say he say Jack I ain't
[1:06:08] never heard of some of these things in
[1:06:09] all my years he said but but but I'm
[1:06:12] teachable that's all I
[1:06:14] need that's all I need and I just drop
[1:06:17] these things off and if there's a seed
[1:06:19] there something going to strike that
[1:06:21] seed and you won't be able to get away
[1:06:23] from it
[1:06:26] amen so I just told him they said what
[1:06:29] what fruit did she eat and got pregnant
[1:06:31] and why is there two different lineages
[1:06:33] in in the Book of
[1:06:34] Genesis what why does the bible say that
[1:06:37] uh Cain was of that Wicked one I mean
[1:06:40] just questioning I like you got to
[1:06:41] answer these questions now so so so as
[1:06:44] as we start going through he say I I I
[1:06:45] i't never heard that I say it was
[1:06:47] adultery in the Garden of Eden say that
[1:06:50] was the first sin that took place in the
[1:06:51] garden of Ed it was adultery now they
[1:06:53] could have come to that cuz God told
[1:06:55] them to fruitful and multiply they could
[1:06:57] have come to it on their own and God
[1:06:58] would have blessed it come on somebody
[1:07:02] but I tell you what but but but I told
[1:07:04] him said you know even uh when we look
[1:07:06] at things even Joel is a part of what
[1:07:08] God said that we would be walking in it
[1:07:10] to be a restoration of the word we come
[1:07:12] back to the word so so I said Lord I
[1:07:15] just thank you for the opportunity to be
[1:07:17] a witness but here when we let me just
[1:07:19] kind of keep going here these these four
[1:07:22] death Messengers came but four life
[1:07:24] Messengers comeing now watch this
[1:07:26] brother random says one of
[1:07:30] them uh let's see here where I'm at 505
[1:07:34] it says uh and if four Messengers death
[1:07:36] if four messengers of Death kill the
[1:07:37] tree four messengers of Life restores
[1:07:39] the tree do you get it says amen for God
[1:07:42] said I will restore it he's going to
[1:07:45] restore it how by four death Messengers
[1:07:48] killed it then four life Messengers will
[1:07:50] restore it what was the first Martin
[1:07:52] Luther justification what was the second
[1:07:54] John Wesley by sanctification what was
[1:07:57] the third Pentecost with the restoration
[1:07:59] of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism amen
[1:08:02] of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth
[1:08:04] the word praise God and and as I've said
[1:08:07] it and I'll say it again we're not just
[1:08:09] amen uh focusing on just the fourth part
[1:08:13] it's very I mean it's the it's the
[1:08:14] climax but we get all of that we get
[1:08:18] justification we get sanctification and
[1:08:21] we get the gifts of the Spirit Plus the
[1:08:24] word we get all of it amen so I I
[1:08:28] realize some some Churches don't want
[1:08:29] the gifts of the Spirit no more we want
[1:08:31] it all yes sir amen praise the Lord long
[1:08:35] as it's in order we want it all now look
[1:08:38] he goes on to say this one of them
[1:08:40] Martin Luther began to shine a light
[1:08:42] there was a little light just a very
[1:08:44] small strength of justification Along
[1:08:47] Came Wesley strong of sanctification
[1:08:49] after Wesley come the stronger than him
[1:08:52] Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:54] Ghost in another great great prophet now
[1:08:56] he and he another great prophet seeyour
[1:09:00] he talking about there but he says look
[1:09:02] he says but in the last days of Malachi
[1:09:04] 4
[1:09:05] Elijah is to come with the very word the
[1:09:10] word of the Lord came to the prophet in
[1:09:13] the evening lights is to come forth to
[1:09:15] restore and bring back what turn the
[1:09:18] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:09:20] of God the fourth light e he's he just
[1:09:23] quoted Malachi 4 sir now when he uses
[1:09:26] that term forth light and I'm going to
[1:09:29] just pause there for a second I'm coming
[1:09:31] back to that same spot uh here in a
[1:09:34] second but when he uses that term forth
[1:09:36] light uh I I can't but uh think about a
[1:09:39] couple things when we talk about fourth
[1:09:42] light uh first one is Revival fires
[1:09:46] began to burn again in the fourth
[1:09:50] generation because what he promises that
[1:09:52] I will light the fire again what they
[1:09:56] saw in the first generation is supposed
[1:09:58] to repeat in the fourth generation
[1:10:00] Hallelujah sir hallelujah what I'm
[1:10:02] saying is that what we saw what we hear
[1:10:04] on tapes what we saw in brother
[1:10:06] brandom's Ministry is supposed to repeat
[1:10:08] again for this day fourth generation is
[1:10:11] supposed to see the same signs the same
[1:10:14] wonders the same Miracles that they saw
[1:10:16] in the first generation I'm telling you
[1:10:18] just won't be a history lesson it's
[1:10:21] going to be a present tense God the
[1:10:23] other thing about the the the fourth
[1:10:25] light is that the sun and moon were
[1:10:27] created on the fourth day they brought
[1:10:30] light on the fourth day now um I want to
[1:10:34] catch a little quote here to talk about
[1:10:36] that just for a second now when when
[1:10:38] when God said at the beginning let there
[1:10:39] be light and the Bible says there was
[1:10:42] light that first day it was not sunlight
[1:10:45] not Su n light but when he said let
[1:10:48] there be light that was s o n light
[1:10:52] hallelujah amen that's where the Loos
[1:10:55] was created that's where amen the pill
[1:10:57] of fire was created uh where we can
[1:10:59] identify the presence of God because he
[1:11:00] was a spirit and we we just could not
[1:11:02] identify him but now that light comes
[1:11:04] out and we can identify the presence of
[1:11:05] God that same light is what led the
[1:11:07] children of Israel through the
[1:11:09] Wilderness hallelujah it's a pillar
[1:11:11] Cloud by day and a pill of Fire by night
[1:11:13] that same light is the one that Paul
[1:11:15] spoke to on the road to Damascus and
[1:11:18] said you know uh it's it's hard for you
[1:11:20] to kick against the prick and why you
[1:11:22] why you persecuting me Paul he says well
[1:11:24] who art thou Lord the light spoke back
[1:11:26] to Paul and said I am Jesus that was s o
[1:11:32] n light yes sir amen but where did the
[1:11:35] Su in light and the Moonlight come from
[1:11:38] it was on the fourth day of creation
[1:11:40] that God brought provided the suu in
[1:11:42] light and amen um and then and the moon
[1:11:44] but there was a purpose cuz brother Bram
[1:11:46] said the sun and the moon are
[1:11:49] married let's read something out of
[1:11:51] speak to the Rock Let's see cuz this
[1:11:53] we're we're in fourth light time we're
[1:11:55] in fourth light time praise the Lord
[1:11:59] we're living underneath fourth light and
[1:12:01] there are certain things that's supposed
[1:12:02] to happen under fourth light sir can I
[1:12:07] just read a little bit speak to the Rock
[1:12:09] Amen there's a a statement here brother
[1:12:12] random makes and I and I want to I want
[1:12:14] to try to clarify this one uh it says
[1:12:17] there is a lot of young women here this
[1:12:21] afternoon amen amen I speak to the Rock
[1:12:24] he says there is a lot of young women
[1:12:27] here this afternoon a lot of nice girls
[1:12:30] now now now now when he's talking about
[1:12:32] this he's talking about
[1:12:35] churches when you when you think about
[1:12:37] women in Scriptures it represents church
[1:12:41] so now he's using a natural type in
[1:12:44] order to kind of identify something
[1:12:46] spiritual sir read between the lines
[1:12:50] right there's a lot of nice young women
[1:12:52] not of lice nice young Church
[1:12:56] all over all over the city come on right
[1:12:59] it says a lot of nice girls Hallelujah
[1:13:03] and I respect every one of them but
[1:13:06] there's
[1:13:07] one miss
[1:13:10] brandom Hallelujah only one now there's
[1:13:13] one miss brandom see that's my wife amen
[1:13:17] he says all right and that's the way it
[1:13:18] is there's lots of churches there's lots
[1:13:22] of people that goes to church and so
[1:13:25] forth but there's one oh my my my my
[1:13:30] there's one miss Jesus and you better
[1:13:33] find
[1:13:36] her glory to God there's one miss Jesus
[1:13:39] that's right and those is made up of
[1:13:42] every denomination that's born again by
[1:13:44] the spirit of God and come into the body
[1:13:47] of Christ they are joint HS with
[1:13:50] him amen they're with him they're a part
[1:13:54] of him just a part of his body and
[1:13:56] that's the way a wife is to a husband
[1:13:58] it's a part of him
[1:14:00] amen now he goes on a little further
[1:14:03] says oh I think of that I think in
[1:14:05] Genesis that when God made the Sun and
[1:14:08] and made the moon now the Moon is the
[1:14:11] wife of the sun now when the Sun goes
[1:14:14] away the Moon reflects the light of the
[1:14:17] sun is that right on the earth and now
[1:14:19] when Jesus was taken away we are the
[1:14:22] bride which is the moon to reflect the
[1:14:27] light of the Gospel in the fourth light
[1:14:29] we got to reflect something Amen to
[1:14:31] reflect the light of the gospel and we
[1:14:33] can't reflect him until he Shines on us
[1:14:37] amen sir yes sir so he says when the
[1:14:42] gospel goes to shining on us then we
[1:14:45] then then then we shine it out so send
[1:14:47] the light Lord is my prayer that we can
[1:14:50] reflect the light of the Son of God in
[1:14:52] his power and in his resurrection
[1:14:55] and his fullness how marvelous
[1:14:58] everything they saw in the first
[1:14:59] generation we're supposed to see in this
[1:15:02] fourth generation we're underneath the
[1:15:03] fourth
[1:15:04] light let me keep going in restoration
[1:15:07] of the Bride tree praise God and we'll
[1:15:10] drop some more here I stopped at
[1:15:12] paragraph 509 there in restoration of
[1:15:16] the Bride tree and the prophet says uh
[1:15:18] four Killers took it four Messengers
[1:15:21] destroyed it four messengers of death
[1:15:24] took took it away in dogmas for
[1:15:27] messengers of righteousness restores her
[1:15:28] back again prophesy son of man can these
[1:15:32] bones live wish we had time it I got it
[1:15:35] wrote down here but I have to miss that
[1:15:37] prophesy can these bones live what's the
[1:15:39] four stages of that coming forth of that
[1:15:42] church what's the four stages of
[1:15:43] ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the
[1:15:46] life only come not when the sin you skin

[1:16:21] come that will bring forth what what's
[1:16:25] it going to bring forth the same signs
[1:16:28] this is prophecy and let me tell you
[1:16:30] something uh when a prophet is speaking
[1:16:32] things like this there's nothing that we
[1:16:34] can do to stop it amen this will happen
[1:16:37] in the church glory to God it just needs
[1:16:39] to happen according to the scripture we
[1:16:42] align ourselves with the word of God
[1:16:43] look it says he says uh uh the fourth
[1:16:46] light is to come that will bring forth
[1:16:48] the same size watch justification
[1:16:50] brought back the pul sanctification

[1:16:59] leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing
[1:17:02] Pentecostal what the fourth was the word
[1:17:05] and and I don't have any problem at all
[1:17:07] with the church being a little
[1:17:09] Pentecostal I rather see you Pentecostal
[1:17:12] than

[1:17:40] the book of Nehemiah you can come amen
[1:17:42] into the church I mean into the king's
[1:17:44] present with a sad

[1:19:35] Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy
[1:19:36] rejoice and Pentecostal what the fourth
[1:19:39] was the word the word made
[1:19:43] flesh fruits of the proof of the
[1:19:45] Resurrection sign that Christ has
[1:19:48] finally just I mean after justification
[1:19:51] been planted sanctification been planted
[1:19:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost organization
[1:19:55] died out but and Christ has again sented
[1:19:59] himself like the cap of the pyramid
[1:20:02] first line justification sanctification
[1:20:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost the then
[1:20:08] coming of the cap that means the
[1:20:10] building is now
[1:20:12] complete but all those things were
[1:20:14] needed to make the building complete you
[1:20:16] need justification you need
[1:20:18] sanctification you need the gifts and
[1:20:21] the
[1:20:22] word hallelujah all right all right let
[1:20:25] me go back to a quote that I read in and
[1:20:27] and the last time I spoke I said if you
[1:20:29] want to hear more you got to come back
[1:20:30] y'all came back by the grace of God well
[1:20:33] let me finish let me finish let me go
[1:20:34] back to this quote out of exposition of
[1:20:36] the seven Church ages and um and then uh
[1:20:39] I want to slip into some
[1:20:42] scripture
[1:20:44] Hallelujah here uh the prophet tells us
[1:20:47] in this message the uh resume of the
[1:20:50] ages he says but what about the true
[1:20:53] seed he says it will happen just as we
[1:20:56] have said the people of God are are be
[1:20:59] are being made ready by the word of
[1:21:01] truth from the messenger to this age now
[1:21:05] how are the people of God being made
[1:21:06] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:21:10] messenger uh to this age right so if I
[1:21:14] did not quote what the message was
[1:21:15] saying you would not be ready for what
[1:21:18] God is getting ready to do not only what
[1:21:21] God's getting ready to do what God
[1:21:22] promised in his scripture to do
[1:21:25] you wouldn't be part of the restoration
[1:21:26] if you couldn't receive
[1:21:31] it all right y if you if you were at the
[1:21:35] homegoing service you know where I'm at
[1:21:38] but you got to be able to receive
[1:21:42] it if if you can receive it this is that
[1:21:48] Elias if you can receive it other
[1:21:52] words Jesus is saying I did my part I
[1:21:56] told you I was sending Elijah and and
[1:21:59] you wondering if Elijah's coming now I'm
[1:22:01] tell I told you I sent I was going to
[1:22:03] send him I have already sent him he's
[1:22:05] sitting in jail right
[1:22:07] now it don't look like a this don't look
[1:22:10] like Elijah in jail does it that bothers
[1:22:13] you that Elijah is sitting in jail right
[1:22:15] now but if you can receive
[1:22:19] it it's not whether I send him or not
[1:22:21] it's whether you can receive him or not
[1:22:24] and if if if if Jesus could say that
[1:22:26] about the first amen uh the the the the
[1:22:30] the the the representative that was
[1:22:31] there at his first coming what about the
[1:22:34] represent that would come at the second
[1:22:36] coming he would say the exact same words
[1:22:39] if you can receive
[1:22:41] it this is that Elijah what's stopping
[1:22:45] you from receiving it a
[1:22:47] bridge a bearl
[1:22:54] that's all that you got that you can't
[1:22:56] receive it well what if Jesus just stood
[1:22:58] out there and said if you can receive it
[1:23:00] this is that
[1:23:03] Elijah and I'm going to tell you with
[1:23:05] some of the signs and wonders that Jesus
[1:23:06] produced in in his ministry we know that
[1:23:09] uh the supernatural picture with the the
[1:23:12] pill of fire over his head it it showed
[1:23:16] how Jesus was identifying that this is
[1:23:17] the man that is that Elijah yes sir
[1:23:19] praise the Lord let me let me read let
[1:23:22] me read people God been made ready by a
[1:23:24] word of truth from the messenger to this
[1:23:26] age and look at this look at this

[1:25:00] fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[1:25:02] will bring the people right back to
[1:25:05] where they were at the beginning that is
[1:25:09] th thus sayith the Lord to God Amen look
[1:25:13] at he said it is thus sayith the Lord
[1:25:14] for that is what Joel 22326 that's why
[1:25:18] Joel becomes our scripture right so so
[1:25:21] the prophet is identifying this it is
[1:25:23] thus say the Lord for that is what Joel
[1:25:25] 2: 23-26 says be glad then ye children
[1:25:28] of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[1:25:30] for he have given you the former Reign
[1:25:33] moderately so now and and this is I want
[1:25:35] to just kind of circle back to something
[1:25:36] I said when when when when the soua
[1:25:39] Street Revival happened they got rain
[1:25:41] moderately they were teaching former
[1:25:44] Reign is a teaching Reign and they were
[1:25:46] teaching that gifts were supposed to be
[1:25:48] back in the church they start teaching
[1:25:50] that uh uh a param I believe had a
[1:25:53] school and and William Seymour had to go
[1:25:55] sit outside the school and get some of
[1:25:56] the teaching because they couldn't
[1:25:58] integrate in those days I mean the Holy
[1:26:00] Ghost don't do things like that right
[1:26:03] and then the man William William Seymour
[1:26:05] goes to Los Angeles start preaching what
[1:26:07] he what he heard in the teaching and
[1:26:10] then they kicked them out the church and
[1:26:11] told them we don't we don't want that it
[1:26:13] don't matter if they kick you out or not
[1:26:15] they ain't got nothing to do with what
[1:26:16] God wants to do amen but Seymour was a
[1:26:20] part of the restoration yes sir
[1:26:22] Hallelujah right and say Seymour stayed
[1:26:25] with what God had showed them they got
[1:26:26] into prayer meetings and before you know
[1:26:28] it the spirit of God poured out in Los
[1:26:30] Angeles like never before amen
[1:26:33] hallelujah but all they had was moderate

[1:33:46] all right let's keep
[1:33:48] going I'm I'm I'm I'm I got to get
[1:33:51] somewhere today the uh the quote
[1:33:54] says God will take his church right back
[1:33:56] to the Pentecost at the beginning now
[1:33:58] notice in verse
[1:34:00] 25 it tells why we need restoration and
[1:34:03] the reason that we need because the
[1:34:05] Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar
[1:34:07] and the Palm worm have eaten all but the
[1:34:09] root and a small bit of the
[1:34:12] stem watch this he says now we are told
[1:34:15] that all these insects are all one and
[1:34:18] the same in different stages that is
[1:34:19] right they are the Antichrist Spirit man
[1:34:23] manifested in organization denomination
[1:34:26] and false Doctrine Through the Ages and
[1:34:29] that poor little root and stalk is going
[1:34:31] to be restored God isn't going to plant
[1:34:34] a new church but is going to bring his
[1:34:36] original planting back to original seed
[1:34:40] and look at this now now now this here
[1:34:42] he says he is doing
[1:34:45] it we're in it right now he is doing it
[1:34:49] as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or
[1:34:53] former rain next will come the Harvest
[1:34:56] rain or rapturing
[1:34:59] faith so you realize this this whole um
[1:35:03] this whole thing is actually preparing
[1:35:05] us for a
[1:35:08] Rapture yes
[1:35:10] sir oh
[1:35:13] my and and you know uh in in in in
[1:35:16] Noah's day they had a message that
[1:35:18] prepared them if they would receive
[1:35:21] it if they could receive it they had a
[1:35:24] message that prepared them for what was
[1:35:25] getting ready to happen we got a message
[1:35:27] that God has given us to prepare us for
[1:35:29] the Rapture because that's the next
[1:35:30] thing to happen for the church
[1:35:32] Hallelujah but we got to we got to uh
[1:35:35] receive what the the prophet is saying
[1:35:38] because he's the one that's given us the
[1:35:40] teaching
[1:35:41] ring Hallelujah you got to know what to
[1:35:44] expect before the spirit rain falls you
[1:35:46] need the teaching ring all right all
[1:35:49] right we ain't seen nothing yet I'm
[1:35:52] telling y'all that right now
[1:35:54] we done seen something but we ain't seen
[1:35:56] nothing
[1:35:58] yet I'm talking about wait till uh you
[1:36:01] get three prophecies go forth and three
[1:36:07] interpretations in the same service and
[1:36:11] then watch the Holy Spirit stop it right
[1:36:13] there because if we go past it then we
[1:36:15] just broke the word but everybody is
[1:36:17] governed right according to the word a a
[1:36:19] prophecy go forth uh
[1:36:21] then uh inter ration another prophecy go
[1:36:24] forth interpretation on SE on different
[1:36:29] people not even the same person but on
[1:36:32] different
[1:36:33] people y'all oh Lord have mercy now I'm
[1:36:36] going tell you something the the modak
[1:36:39] gift is in operation in the
[1:36:43] church the more precise it
[1:36:46] comes the more the more people feel
[1:36:49] comfortable releasing and allowing God
[1:36:51] to speak through them now I'm saying
[1:36:53] that for a reason because if your life
[1:36:55] ain't
[1:36:56] right it is very possible that somebody
[1:36:59] could call something out in your
[1:37:02] life you you come to church kind of
[1:37:04] hiding things but some people don't know
[1:37:06] about what you doing when you leave
[1:37:07] church but the Holy Ghost know what you
[1:37:09] doing and this going to be a church
[1:37:11] controlled by the Holy Ghost and let me
[1:37:14] tell you something we don't we don't
[1:37:16] need nobody sin trying to stop and block
[1:37:19] God from doing what he want to do now
[1:37:22] I'm going tell I'm going to say it like
[1:37:23] this today is a day a really good day a
[1:37:26] great day for you to repent that's right
[1:37:30] and get your life right with God yes sir
[1:37:33] amen this a good day for you Lord I'm
[1:37:36] sorry and don't go back to that
[1:37:38] lifestyle when you truly repent you
[1:37:39] don't go back to that lifestyle
[1:37:41] hallelujah amen old things pass away and
[1:37:44] everything else becomes new you run for
[1:37:47] your life no I ain't going back to that
[1:37:48] no no no they can have all my stuff I
[1:37:51] ain't going back I'm going forward yes
[1:37:53] sir huj that's what repentance does but
[1:37:57] I'm just I'm I'm forewarning you because
[1:38:00] we ain't seen nothing
[1:38:01] yet amen the spirit has a way of calling
[1:38:05] out things I mean back back in the day
[1:38:07] it would I mean hey now look even in the
[1:38:10] Pentecost Church they would tell you
[1:38:11] things that you was doing in your life
[1:38:13] that weren right Jesus did that with the
[1:38:15] woman at the well go get your husband
[1:38:18] yeah I ain't got no husband you right
[1:38:22] and the one you living with right now is

[1:42:20] Hallelujah here we go yeah you
[1:42:23] know I'm going to tell you this this
[1:42:25] word is powerful I I'm trying to get
[1:42:28] somewhere I had a friend another friend
[1:42:31] called me this
[1:42:33] week and she had um she had a dream
[1:42:37] about something that was that happened
[1:42:39] to her that she somehow fell out of her
[1:42:41] bed and was underneath the um uh got
[1:42:45] thrown underneath her underneath the bed
[1:42:47] and she was just screaming Jesus Jesus I
[1:42:50] don't even know how I got down here
[1:42:51] Jesus I need you I need you and she say
[1:42:53] somehow when she when she when she cried
[1:42:55] for Jesus she got back on the bed and
[1:42:57] there was such a peace that came you
[1:42:59] know over her and uh so she said she
[1:43:03] went to church for some event a few days
[1:43:06] later and when she went to church she
[1:43:08] come home from church and she just laid
[1:43:09] down on her couch and uh and when she
[1:43:12] laid down on the couch um she she say
[1:43:15] she don't even remember falling from the
[1:43:17] couch but she fell from the couch and
[1:43:18] found herself underneath the
[1:43:21] table and when she saw herself she she
[1:43:23] was looking up from there she said she
[1:43:24] didn't know what was going on she said
[1:43:26] Jesus where are you I need your help I
[1:43:27] don't know where you at Lord you know
[1:43:29] how did this happen to me and then then
[1:43:31] then she she turned from questioning him
[1:43:34] to saying I plead the blood of
[1:43:36] Jesus I plead the blood of Jesus before
[1:43:38] you know it she found herself out from
[1:43:40] underneath that table back on the couch
[1:43:43] and she was trying to call people to
[1:43:44] come see about couldn't reach nobody and
[1:43:46] she's like she like you know I just
[1:43:47] think this spiritual warfare I said no
[1:43:49] no no say hold on hold on hold on hold
[1:43:51] on you said you had a dream
[1:43:54] that you was in your bed and then when
[1:43:56] you fell out the bed you went underneath
[1:43:58] the bed and then you you know you you
[1:44:01] you said uh Jesus and somehow peace came
[1:44:04] into your room you got back on the bed
[1:44:05] that was in a dream correct so then the
[1:44:08] manifestation came when you was laying
[1:44:10] on your couch and you slipped underneath
[1:44:12] the table and don't know how you got
[1:44:14] there now first you questioned
[1:44:16] them but when you begin to plead his
[1:44:18] blood that's when the peace came and you
[1:44:21] got out the situation without anybody
[1:44:22] coming to get you look he showed you in
[1:44:24] the dream what was going to happen and
[1:44:27] then he showed you how to get out of the
[1:44:28] problem in the
[1:44:31] dream she said I ain't see it like that
[1:44:34] it's real simple God showed you all of
[1:44:37] this in order to prepare you for what
[1:44:38] was getting ready to happen and when you
[1:44:40] when you know the
[1:44:41] word it gives you
[1:44:46] peace let me keep reading
[1:44:55] in so much that it was if it were
[1:44:57] possible uh they shall deceive the very
[1:44:58] elect and who is it that shall attempt
[1:45:01] to deceive their very like why the
[1:45:03] spirit of antichrist is in the false and
[1:45:04] only ones of this last day these false
[1:45:06] ones have already come in Jesus name
[1:45:09] claiming that they have been anointed of
[1:45:11] God for the last day they are false
[1:45:13] Messiahs anointed ones they claim that
[1:45:14] they are prophets but they are one but
[1:45:17] are they one with the word never they
[1:45:19] have added to it or taken from it no one
[1:45:22] denies that the spirit of God
[1:45:23] manifesting and Gifts is upon them but
[1:45:25] like balum they all have their programs
[1:45:28] make their appeal for money exercise
[1:45:29] gifts but deny the word or bypass it for
[1:45:32] fear that a controversy might diminish
[1:45:34] their chances for greater gain yet they
[1:45:36] preach salvation and deliverance through
[1:45:38] the power of God just like Judas with
[1:45:39] the ministry imparted by Christ but
[1:45:42] because they are the wrong seed
[1:45:43] consequently they have a wrong Spirit
[1:45:45] motivating them religious oh
[1:45:48] my they outshine the elect in effort and
[1:45:50] Zeal but is Lay to see him not of Christ
[1:45:53] for it looks for big crowds big programs
[1:45:55] and startling signs among them they
[1:45:58] preach the second coming of Christ but
[1:45:59] deny the
[1:46:02] Advent of the Prophet messenger though
[1:46:05] EMP powering signs and true Revelation
[1:46:08] he eclipses them all ah yes the this
[1:46:11] false spirit in this last day is so
[1:46:14] close to the real can be distinguished
[1:46:16] only by its deviation from the word and
[1:46:18] whenever it's caught in being anti- word
[1:46:20] it falls back on one argument
[1:46:24] we have we have shown already to be
[1:46:25] false we shown to be false we get
[1:46:28] results don't we we have to be of God
[1:46:30] see so brother brandom's told us that we
[1:46:32] don't look for just people that's
[1:46:33] getting results if they're not on the
[1:46:35] word we don't we don't go with that now
[1:46:39] when he said here in this quote now I'm
[1:46:42] I'm I'm I'm I'm at a point where I want
[1:46:44] to be uh he says here is they deny the
[1:46:47] Advent of the Prophet messenger I
[1:46:49] mentioned this before Advent means the
[1:46:51] arrival of a notable person
[1:46:54] it's the arrival the Advent of a man
[1:46:58] they they they they deny the Advent of
[1:47:01] the Prophet messenger that means the
[1:47:03] prophet has already arrived and at this
[1:47:06] time the prophet was actually on the
[1:47:07] scene preaching to them but they deny
[1:47:10] the Advent of the Prophet messenger we
[1:47:13] don't want to receive that you are a
[1:47:15] prophet that come from God well look God
[1:47:17] promised in his word that he was sending
[1:47:18] a prophet now this is where we we get
[1:47:21] started in our journey and y'all already
[1:47:23] know I'm out of time but it's okay uh we
[1:47:26] start here with Malachi 4 this is the
[1:47:29] scripture that promises that a prophet
[1:47:31] would be coming Malachi 4:5 and 6 let's
[1:47:34] read that really really quick and then
[1:47:37] uh I will find a way out but uh I have I
[1:47:44] I I have roughly 11 scriptures that I
[1:47:47] want to share with you all and in
[1:47:49] sharing the scriptures I'm also going to
[1:47:51] bring um
[1:47:53] a couple quotes to go along with
[1:47:55] it so it's cemented but Malachi
[1:48:00] 45-6 and maybe I think what we're going
[1:48:03] to need to do is go back to verse one on
[1:48:05] this one because it's it's very
[1:48:07] important that we kind of catch all of
[1:48:09] this verse one says for behold the day
[1:48:12] cometh that shall burn as an
[1:48:16] oven and all the proud Y and all that do
[1:48:19] wickly shall be stubble and the day that
[1:48:21] cometh shall burn them up sayth the Lord
[1:48:23] of hosts that it shall leave neither
[1:48:25] root nor
[1:48:27] Branch but unto you that fear my name
[1:48:29] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:48:33] with healing in his wings and ye shall
[1:48:35] go forth and grow up as the calvs of the
[1:48:37] stall and ye shall tread down the wicked
[1:48:40] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[1:48:43] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[1:48:46] this sayith the Lord of hosts remember
[1:48:49] ye the law of Moses my servant which I
[1:48:50] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[1:48:53] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[1:48:56] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:49:00] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:49:04] and Dreadful day of the Lord right and
[1:49:08] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:49:11] to the children and the Heart of the
[1:49:13] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:49:16] and smite the Earth with a curse now
[1:49:19] here we we we get uh God promising that
[1:49:22] he's going to sent Elijah the prophet
[1:49:24] and now it's up to you to receive Elijah
[1:49:27] when Elijah comes it's up to you to
[1:49:29] receive him you don't have to but God
[1:49:31] will do his part in saying i s i I have
[1:49:35] I will sin and I have already sin this
[1:49:37] is why he told him in in in John's day
[1:49:40] now if you can receive it this is that
[1:49:42] Elijah this the one I said I was going
[1:49:44] to be sending so now here what we what
[1:49:46] we find in scripture and and I hit this
[1:49:48] at the uh at the homegoing service uh
[1:49:51] our journey through um through this hour
[1:49:55] restore kind of already had me in a
[1:49:57] certain channel that once we got to the
[1:49:59] homegoing service I knew I was just
[1:50:00] going to pick up and just kind of share
[1:50:02] some of the things there that I'd be
[1:50:04] sharing here so um I was just I was just
[1:50:07] looking at this because when you look at
[1:50:10] this verse that we just read actually in
[1:50:12] this one verse in verse six there's
[1:50:15] actually two different comings of Elijah
[1:50:18] in verse 6 put it back on the screen
[1:50:22] there so everybody can follow me in
[1:50:24] verse 6 when he says behold I will send
[1:50:26] you Elijah the prophet then he says and
[1:50:29] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:50:30] to the children that part right there is
[1:50:34] the ministry of John the Baptist sir
[1:50:38] hallelujah it's two different comings of
[1:50:39] Elijah so there's a coming of Elijah for
[1:50:42] the first coming of the Lord and then
[1:50:44] there's a coming of Elijah for the
[1:50:46] second coming the Lord so the ministry
[1:50:48] of Eli I mean the ministry of John the
[1:50:49] Baptist was to turn the heart of the
[1:50:51] fathers to the children amen but when
[1:50:54] you get
[1:50:55] and the Heart of the children to their
[1:50:57] fathers that is a separate Ministry and
[1:51:01] that ministry glory to God is the
[1:51:03] ministry of William Mary and brandham so
[1:51:04] in this one verse we got two different
[1:51:07] comings of the spirit of Elijah yes sir
[1:51:11] hallelujah amen two different comings
[1:51:13] and one verse in the and is a
[1:51:15] conjunction that brings it all together
[1:51:17] but then it says lest I come and smite
[1:51:18] the Earth with a curse now um I got a
[1:51:22] little something that I would love to
[1:51:23] read on
[1:51:25] that um one one one one one one other
[1:51:28] scripture really quick before I read
[1:51:30] this next quote go to Luke 1 verse 13-1
[1:51:33] 17 that way uh you're not just taking my
[1:51:36] word but when I say it's two different
[1:51:37] comings of Elijah uh the first part goes
[1:51:40] to John the Baptist because it's spoken
[1:51:42] of right here in scripture uh Luke 1
[1:51:46] verse
[1:51:47] 13 yeah through 17 look at it says this
[1:51:51] but the angel said said unto him fear
[1:51:53] not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard
[1:51:56] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[1:51:57] son and thou shalt call his name
[1:52:00] John and thou shalt have joy and
[1:52:03] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:52:05] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:52:07] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:52:10] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:52:12] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:52:13] mother's womb now I can just run right
[1:52:15] over the top of
[1:52:19] that but Brother brandom on while he was
[1:52:23] a little boy are y'all with me yes
[1:52:27] sir while he was a little boy his daddy
[1:52:30] had a moonshine
[1:52:31] still they was they was they they they
[1:52:34] made liquor for the young kids that
[1:52:36] might not know what moonshine is they
[1:52:38] made hard liquor and they was they and
[1:52:41] brother bradam was with even with his
[1:52:43] daddy he would have to take the water
[1:52:45] down to the Moonshine still Hallelujah
[1:52:47] and and while he's walking with the
[1:52:50] water down to the stem brother random
[1:52:52] just as a little boy he he saw how
[1:52:54] mothers were leaving home they're
[1:52:55] leaving their kids at home coming to the
[1:52:57] Moonshine still and drinking up
[1:52:59] something just carrying on ungodly lives
[1:53:02] down there and it just caused him to
[1:53:04] kind of he had a problem with mothers
[1:53:06] doing that he had a big problem but but
[1:53:08] as he was as he was taking the water
[1:53:10] down to the Moonshine still all of a
[1:53:11] sudden a voice spoke to him out of a
[1:53:13] tree one day said don't you ever smoke
[1:53:16] don't you ever drink as a little boy
[1:53:19] because I have a work for you to do when
[1:53:21] you get older am yes sir that voice that
[1:53:24] spoke to him I would say was a
[1:53:26] scriptural voice yes sir because John
[1:53:29] the Baptist couldn't do any of these
[1:53:31] things hallelujah look at what the Bible
[1:53:34] say here in ver verse 15 says
[1:53:37] uh uh for the Lord shall be great in the
[1:53:39] sight of the Lord and shall uh for for
[1:53:41] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:53:43] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:53:45] strong drink and he shall be filled with
[1:53:46] the Holy Ghost even from his mother's
[1:53:49] womb and many of the children of Israel
[1:53:52] shall he turn to the Lord their God and
[1:53:55] he shall go before him in the
[1:53:57] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[1:54:02] hearts of the
[1:54:04] fathers to the children John the Baptist
[1:54:08] ministry did the first part of verse six
[1:54:11] but brother Bam's Ministry does the
[1:54:13] second part of verse six now if you can
[1:54:16] receive
[1:54:18] John why can't you receive William Brown
[1:54:24] Hallelujah right so now look he says and
[1:54:27] he shall go before him in spirit and the
[1:54:28] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:54:30] fathers to the children and and the
[1:54:31] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:54:34] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:54:37] Lord so we know John the Baptist
[1:54:38] according to scripture was the
[1:54:40] Fulfillment of the first part of verse
[1:54:43] six Amen in Malachi 4 but there is a a
[1:54:46] quote here that I that I read at the
[1:54:48] Homing service and I want to read it
[1:54:49] again for you all this morning just to
[1:54:51] kindless to l ify this this is out of
[1:54:53] the message Jehovah Gyra uh part one
[1:54:56] praise the Lord praise the Lord my god
[1:55:00] Jehovah Gyra part one uh the prophet
[1:55:03] tells us this says we got to we got to
[1:55:06] get back to the
[1:55:09] word he says and we'll do it because God
[1:55:13] said I will restore saith the Lord all
[1:55:19] the years that the cankerworm and the
[1:55:20] Palmer worms eat is going to bloom out
[1:55:23] in the evening time there will come
[1:55:26] forth one with a message glory to God
[1:55:29] he'll restore the hearts of the faith of
[1:55:31] the children back to the faith of the
[1:55:33] fathers he promised it in Malachi 4 that
[1:55:36] he would do it return them back again
[1:55:38] now this isn't Elijah that was talked of
[1:55:41] in the Bible Jesus said in Matthew 11 if
[1:55:45] you can receive it John there was the
[1:55:48] Elias that was to come of Malachi 3 all
[1:55:52] right behold I send my messenger before
[1:55:54] my face Malachi 3 you find that but
[1:55:57] remember the Malachi 4 the message comes
[1:56:00] the terrible day of the Lord shall come
[1:56:02] and shall burn up the whole earth and
[1:56:04] the righteous shall walk out upon the
[1:56:06] ashes of the wicked that never happened
[1:56:09] after John praise God he says that never
[1:56:12] happened after John no if that was it
[1:56:15] then the scripture has lost its whole it
[1:56:19] said something that wasn't so we got
[1:56:22] 2,000 years since then the world hasn't
[1:56:25] been burned not at all neither has the
[1:56:27] righteous walked out upon the ashes of
[1:56:29] the wicked but we're still waiting for
[1:56:31] that something that's going to take the
[1:56:33] faith and restore the faith of the
[1:56:35] children back to the original
[1:56:37] Pentecostal tree that the cankerworm eat
[1:56:39] up the Roman cankerworm caterpillar says
[1:56:41] all the denominations and Creeds eat it
[1:56:44] down eat it down God said I'll restore
[1:56:45] it again in the last days it will be
[1:56:48] restored God shall send the Holy Ghost
[1:56:50] in such a way upon planet word I like
[1:56:53] that statement God shall send the Holy
[1:56:57] Ghost in such a way and the only way
[1:57:00] it's going to come now it has to be
[1:57:02] planted where I got to take time and lay
[1:57:05] this in the
[1:57:07] church that this whole year just been
[1:57:09] taking time the word got to be planted
[1:57:12] so the people know what to expect when
[1:57:15] it happened you know you're right in the
[1:57:17] words you know what you're looking at
[1:57:18] yes
[1:57:20] sir and I can't be planting and then
[1:57:23] somebody come behind me and unplant what
[1:57:25] I PL no we no we going to plant this and
[1:57:28] we going to wait for God to bring forth
[1:57:31] what he said he going to bring
[1:57:32] forth look
[1:57:34] now the holy and I and I appreciate all
[1:57:37] the ministers I just been watching them
[1:57:39] all the whole year y'all just go back
[1:57:41] and look at them listen to the sermons
[1:57:43] that were coming to you the ministers
[1:57:44] caught the same inspiration they been
[1:57:46] planting right along with me right
[1:57:48] brother amen right along with me oh my
[1:57:50] my my my my I I know I know where we're
[1:57:53] standing at church look at what he say
[1:57:55] he says he says the Holy Ghost uh God
[1:57:58] will send the Holy Ghost in such a way
[1:58:01] upon planted word that will restore the
[1:58:05] word of God is a seed that a soul went
[1:58:08] forth to S now let me let me let me let
[1:58:12] me just I I mentioned there that there
[1:58:14] was that one verse demonstrated there
[1:58:16] were two comings of Elijah but however
[1:58:20] we know the prophet has taught us that
[1:58:22] the spirit of Elijah is used five times
[1:58:25] five times it's used and um and you know
[1:58:29] I was I was so grateful that the Lord
[1:58:32] just kind of showed me to slide that
[1:58:34] right into you the the the the the home
[1:58:37] the homegoing sermon and I was telling
[1:58:39] my wife you know when I was thinking
[1:58:41] about the thought I say you know
[1:58:42] typically I I go to a service a
[1:58:44] homegoing service and I Tri typically
[1:58:46] try not to preach over about 20 minutes
[1:58:49] um but uh I knew that as the what the
[1:58:52] Lord had given me say it's going to take
[1:58:53] me a little bit longer than 20 minutes
[1:58:55] to get this out it's going to be like we
[1:58:56] in church and um you know so I said but
[1:59:00] I'm this what the lord gave me so I'm
[1:59:01] going to just go with it and um and you
[1:59:04] know as as I went with it just kind of I
[1:59:06] felt that you know some of the different
[1:59:08] ones that would be coming you know to
[1:59:10] that service it would be one once more
[1:59:15] Lord right it it'll be a once more Lord
[1:59:18] experience like I I don't know if we'll
[1:59:20] ever see you again
[1:59:22] well actually I do know on the other
[1:59:25] side if if you can't receive it you're
[1:59:28] going to see this again because God will
[1:59:30] replay the whole whole service to you
[1:59:32] again right but I said I said you know
[1:59:36] on behalf of brother Wesco being the one
[1:59:38] that introduced the message to us you
[1:59:41] know the the African-American Community
[1:59:42] here in in South Florida he was the one
[1:59:45] that introduced it to us through his
[1:59:46] preaching and uh so it it's impacted all
[1:59:49] of our lives right so we we thank God
[1:59:52] God for for him you know taking a stand
[1:59:53] for this message so I said let me just
[1:59:55] try to bring something that that that
[1:59:57] would speak back to who he was and what
[1:59:59] he did what he did right and uh so as we
[2:00:03] were bringing that you know the Lord the
[2:00:05] Lord just kind of you know uh there was
[2:00:07] a few things that I had in my heart that
[2:00:08] I that I wanted to to to get to and the
[2:00:11] Lord just just dropped this little piece
[2:00:13] in there about these five different
[2:00:14] comings of Elijah and you know the first
[2:00:17] one was in Elijah himself and we're
[2:00:19] going to read a scripture really really
[2:00:20] quick uh Elijah s but this is why I say
[2:00:23] it's a restoration Ministry turn with me
[2:00:26] to First Kings
[2:00:28] 18 and we'll we'll see something here
[2:00:30] the ministry of Elijah is a restoration
[2:00:33] Ministry turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:00:34] to the children that's and then also
[2:00:36] turn the hearts of the children to the
[2:00:38] fathers this is restoration right and um
[2:00:41] uh First Kings 18 the story here is that
[2:00:45] the children of Israel were were in a
[2:00:48] situation where they gotten away from
[2:00:52] uh following
[2:00:55] God they have a new God his name is Bale
[2:00:59] and uh they are there following him but
[2:01:01] you got some you still got some
[2:01:02] Believers in the camp of Israel and and
[2:01:04] one of them is a Prophet by the name of
[2:01:06] Elijah uh but he notices that these
[2:01:08] other people because King Ahab has uh
[2:01:11] married the wrong wife amen Ahab married
[2:01:14] the wrong wife when he married uh you
[2:01:17] know Jezebel it influenced him and it
[2:01:20] and it just it wre Havoc for Israel
[2:01:24] because this man married the wrong woman
[2:01:27] right and uh uh him being in a
[2:01:29] leadership position marrying the wrong
[2:01:30] woman it just it created problems for
[2:01:32] everybody right so so it's uh so so here
[2:01:36] you know Israel is now pulling away from
[2:01:39] uh from God and they've been introduced
[2:01:40] to Bell which is you know probably uh
[2:01:42] Jezebel's God uh and they've been
[2:01:44] introduced to that so finally Elijah
[2:01:46] come to a spot where he's like you know
[2:01:48] what H how how how long y'all going to
[2:01:51] Halt between two opinions it says um you
[2:01:55] know if God be God then serve him and if
[2:01:57] Bale be God then serve him and it says I
[2:02:00] tell you we going to put this thing to a
[2:02:02] test and we're going to get yall to you
[2:02:04] know agree to this he says let's build
[2:02:06] some altars and uh and y'all going to
[2:02:08] pray and y'all going to ask B to come
[2:02:10] down and and burn up the Altar and say
[2:02:12] then after y'all finish I'mma build an
[2:02:14] altar and and I'mma pray and I'mma ask
[2:02:16] God to burn down burn the altar he says
[2:02:18] and the god that answers by fire let him
[2:02:22] be God everybody say okay that sound
[2:02:26] good they got up they start praying they
[2:02:28] couldn't get no answer so then they
[2:02:30] start cutting
[2:02:31] the and young people if you ever get to
[2:02:33] the spot where you're cutting yourself
[2:02:35] you know that didn't come from God that
[2:02:37] is a devil trying to take you out of
[2:02:39] here these these demonic worshippers
[2:02:41] were cutting themselves they start
[2:02:43] cutting themselves and and L say look
[2:02:44] y'all need to scream a little harder cuz
[2:02:46] maybe your God is going on vacation
[2:02:47] maybe he harder here what I don't know
[2:02:49] what he he he say all and full hundred
[2:02:51] of them out there praying like that no
[2:02:53] no answer at all Elijah said okay it's
[2:02:56] enough it was the evening
[2:02:59] time it was an evening time and Elijah
[2:03:01] walked up and said okay now I'mma dig
[2:03:03] some trenches and I'mma pour water pour
[2:03:05] water in there three times and when he
[2:03:07] poured the water in uh then then then
[2:03:09] then let's pick him up over here in in
[2:03:11] First Kings
[2:03:14] 18:35 oh Hallelujah 34 and he said do it
[2:03:18] the second time they did the second time
[2:03:20] and he said do it the third time and
[2:03:21] they did it the third time and the water
[2:03:23] ran about the Altar and he filled the
[2:03:25] trench also with water and it came to
[2:03:28] pass at the time of the offerings of the
[2:03:29] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[2:03:32] prophet came near and said Lord God of
[2:03:35] Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be
[2:03:39] known this day that thou art God in
[2:03:43] Israel and that I am thy servant and
[2:03:47] that I have done all these things at TH

[2:04:10] heart happened with John the Baptist

[2:04:41] to why they believe what they believe
[2:04:44] but here in the message we can show you
[2:04:46] in the Bible why we believe what we
[2:04:47] believe that's right exactly right amen
[2:04:51] standing on the word this is not some I
[2:04:53] mean don't please don't get your mind
[2:04:55] just only on the man brother Brandon
[2:04:57] brother BR get your mind on the word I'm
[2:04:59] reading to you scripture yes sir I'm
[2:05:02] reading scripture and I'm showing you
[2:05:04] how the scripture was manifested this
[2:05:07] Bible will never become unlocked to you
[2:05:09] until you can hear from a
[2:05:14] prophet yeah you'll always be be
[2:05:16] wondering about the scripture but if you
[2:05:18] can just open up and hear if you will
[2:05:20] just receive it yes sir oh Lord have
[2:05:23] mercy you you'll see these things just
[2:05:25] open up to you
[2:05:28] uh this was the first coming of
[2:05:31] Elijah um and I'm I'm I'm winding down
[2:05:35] I'm I'm winding down I'm winding down I
[2:05:38] gave you the other two comings of
[2:05:41] Elijah I'mma I'mma give you I'mma give
[2:05:44] you I'm just I'm skipping around a
[2:05:45] little bit here the the the fifth coming
[2:05:48] of Elijah I didn't I didn't do the
[2:05:49] second I'll come back to the second I'm
[2:05:51] winding down but the fifth coming of
[2:05:53] Elijah was out of uh Revelation 11 verse
[2:06:06] 3-6 verse 3 through6 Revelation 11 and
[2:06:10] uh this is Promised according to
[2:06:12] scripture the fifth coming I'm talking
[2:06:13] about the five different comings of
[2:06:14] Elijah and I'm giving you a scripture
[2:06:16] for
[2:06:17] it um One Was Elijah himself uh the
[2:06:21] second is going to be Elisha we'll get
[2:06:23] back to that and then uh John the
[2:06:25] Baptist is is Malachi 3:1 was referred
[2:06:28] to earlier uh also Revelation I'm sorry
[2:06:31] Malachi 45 and6 also speaks of John the
[2:06:33] Baptist and brother brandom's Ministry
[2:06:36] and uh Revelation 11 is speaking of
[2:06:38] Elijah himself now I I don't know yeah
[2:06:43] okay let me just read this real quick
[2:06:44] verse three says and I will give power
[2:06:46] unto my two witnesses and they shall
[2:06:49] prophesy 1,23 s days clothe and
[2:06:51] sackcloth these are the two olive trees
[2:06:54] and the two candlesticks standing before
[2:06:56] the god of the earth and if any man hurt
[2:06:58] them fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[2:07:01] and devour their enemies and if any man
[2:07:04] uh hurt them he must in this manner be
[2:07:06] killed look these have the power to shut
[2:07:11] Heaven glory to God that it rain not in
[2:07:15] the days of their prophecy now look I I
[2:07:17] need to understand when we say that the
[2:07:20] that this is uh Elijah and Moses as the
[2:07:23] two witnesses because different churches
[2:07:25] teach so many different things the
[2:07:26] reason we say it's Elijah and Moses
[2:07:28] Moses even though the Bible does not
[2:07:30] give us their names the way we can tell
[2:07:32] who the Witnesses are their Ministries
[2:07:35] are
[2:07:36] identified in the scripture so when the
[2:07:38] Bible says uh uh verse six it says these
[2:07:41] have power to shut the heaven that it
[2:07:43] rain not in the days of their prophecy
[2:07:44] that happened in Elijah's Ministry yes
[2:07:47] sir Hallelujah that's how we know that's
[2:07:49] Elijah glory to God
[2:07:52] amen and uh um and and goes on says um
[2:07:56] and have power over Waters that turn
[2:07:58] them to blood that happened in Moses
[2:08:01] Ministry praise the Lord amen and to
[2:08:05] Smite the Earth with all plagues as
[2:08:07] often as they will you talking about
[2:08:09] somebody can speak the word did did
[2:08:12] Moses SP Smite with plagues yes he did
[2:08:15] this is Moses Ministry look at it now it
[2:08:18] says um and when they shall finish their
[2:08:20] testimony the be that ascendeth out of
[2:08:22] the bottomless pit shall make war
[2:08:23] against them and shall overcome them and
[2:08:26] kill them all right so we we find here
[2:08:29] that the second I mean this fifth coming
[2:08:31] of Elijah is Elijah himself according to
[2:08:36] Revelation 11 the second
[2:08:38] one the second time the spirit of Elijah
[2:08:41] was used was found in 2 Kings 2 verse
[2:08:45] 9-4 let me just read that and I'll close
[2:08:48] off right
[2:08:49] here we got the five comers of
[2:08:53] Elijah I love the word of the Lord I
[2:09:00] love for the church to get settled on
[2:09:02] the word we got to plant these
[2:09:04] seeds so the church know where they
[2:09:08] at we're we we took we took a whole year
[2:09:13] planting and we still got some more that
[2:09:15] we that we we putting in there but I'm
[2:09:17] telling you the truth you will see a man
[2:09:21] manifestation of what has been
[2:09:24] planted amen it'll be an
[2:09:28] overflow it'll be an
[2:09:34] overflow this is the second time the
[2:09:37] spirit of Elijah was
[2:09:40] used it's in 2 Kings chapter 2 and the
[2:09:44] story the backstory of this is uh
[2:09:49] Elijah is now going off to SE God is
[2:09:52] calling him home and um uh Elisha had
[2:09:57] been following him and just been you
[2:09:59] know just just just staying right in
[2:10:02] tune with what Elijah was saying and you
[2:10:05] know losing a a great man like Elijah
[2:10:09] this would have been really difficult
[2:10:10] for
[2:10:12] Elija but the thing that uh Eli Elisha
[2:10:16] recognized that Elijah was not doing any
[2:10:20] of this on his
[2:10:22] own Elijah was anointed with a spirit
[2:10:27] from God so Elisha knew that if he could
[2:10:31] get the same thing that
[2:10:33] Elijah got then the work would go on
[2:10:38] praise the Lord somebody there is much
[2:10:41] that I could say here there is much but
[2:10:44] sometimes you got to be able to read
[2:10:46] between the
[2:10:48] lines let me put it on the church as a
[2:10:51] whole
[2:10:52] our
[2:10:53] Elijah is already gone but there was a
[2:10:57] spirit in
[2:10:58] Elijah that caused him to do the things
[2:11:01] that he did Hallelujah and that same
[2:11:03] Spirit the holy spirit is now in Elisha
[2:11:06] I got a quote on this you know he he he
[2:11:09] says The The J and the Sha he says
[2:11:12] notice the he and the
[2:11:15] she that's right so
[2:11:19] Elisha represents
[2:11:23] you and and and can I say it
[2:11:27] again
[2:11:36] Elish Elisha had a double portion of the
[2:11:40] spirit of
[2:11:42] Elijah the restoration
[2:11:45] brings
[2:11:47] double amen yes sir
[2:11:52] let me read it
[2:11:54] y'all 2 Kings chapter
[2:12:00] 2:9 it's it's there is I'm starting at
[2:12:04] verse one I'm not going to skip I'm
[2:12:05] starting at verse one it came to pass
[2:12:08] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[2:12:10] Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went
[2:12:13] with Elisha from
[2:12:16] gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha Terry
[2:12:19] here he was him I pray thee for the Lord
[2:12:24] has sent me to bethl and Elisha said un
[2:12:26] him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[2:12:29] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[2:12:32] went down to
[2:12:34] bethl and the sons of the prophets there
[2:12:37] uh that were at bethl came forth to
[2:12:40] Elisha and said un him knowest thou that
[2:12:43] the Lord will take away thy master from
[2:12:45] thy head today and he said yay I know it
[2:12:48] hold ye your peace
[2:12:51] and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry
[2:12:55] here I pray thee for the Lord have sent
[2:12:57] me to Jericho and he said as the Lord
[2:13:00] liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not
[2:13:02] leave thee so they came to
[2:13:04] Jericho my
[2:13:06] God see Jericho is where the walls had
[2:13:09] come
[2:13:10] down says and the sons of the prophets
[2:13:13] that were at Jero came to Elisha and
[2:13:17] said to him knowest thou that the Lord
[2:13:19] will take away thy master from thy head
[2:13:21] today and he answered y I know it hold
[2:13:24] ye your peace so we got prophets in
[2:13:28] Jericho we got prophets and bethl they
[2:13:31] all over the place right they said but
[2:13:33] hold your peace hold your peace now
[2:13:35] verse six and Elijah said to him Terry I
[2:13:37] pray thee here for the Lord ha sent me
[2:13:40] to Jordan which represents a death amen
[2:13:44] and he said as the Lord liveth and as
[2:13:46] thy soul liveth I will not lead thee and
[2:13:49] they too went on watch this and 50 men
[2:13:53] of the sons of the prophets went and
[2:13:54] stood the view a far off and they stood
[2:13:57] by the they two stood by Jordan and
[2:14:01] Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[2:14:04] together and smoke the waters and they
[2:14:07] were divided hither and thither so that
[2:14:10] they too went over on dry ground and it
[2:14:13] came to pass when they were going over
[2:14:15] that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[2:14:18] shall do for thee
[2:14:22] Oh Glory to God and Elisha said I pray
[2:14:27] thee let a double portion of thy Spirit
[2:14:29] be upon me and he said thou has asked a
[2:14:31] hard thing glory to God glory to God he
[2:14:35] asks for it he asks for it he asks for
[2:14:38] it and the Bible going to tell us that
[2:14:40] he got
[2:14:44] it before brother Wesco passed I was
[2:14:47] given an
[2:14:48] opportunity to go to his bed

[2:16:17] I just had a chance just to kind of have
[2:16:19] a little moment with them just to just
[2:16:21] express my
[2:16:23] thanks so if you see
[2:16:26] me when I go let's
[2:16:30] read let's
[2:16:33] read and it came to pass I'm sorry verse
[2:16:37] 10 and it said thou Hast asked a hard
[2:16:38] thing nevertheless if thou see me when I
[2:16:41] am taken from thee it shall be so unto
[2:16:43] thee but if not it shall not be so it
[2:16:47] says and it came to pass as they still
[2:16:49] went on and talked that behold there
[2:16:51] appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of
[2:16:53] fire and parted them both the suay and
[2:16:55] Elijah went up by a world went into into
[2:16:58] heaven Elijah saw it and carried and and
[2:17:00] and cried he cried he cried my
[2:17:04] father my
[2:17:06] father The Chariot of Israel and the
[2:17:10] horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
[2:17:12] and he took hold of his own clothes and
[2:17:15] rent them into two pieces he took up Al
[2:17:18] also the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[2:17:20] him and went back and stood by the bank
[2:17:23] of Jordan now we know he went back to
[2:17:25] Jordan and he struck the Jordan Jordan
[2:17:27] opened up just like it did for Elijah
[2:17:29] showing that the spirit of Elijah was
[2:17:32] now resting on
[2:17:35] Elijah those words my father my father
[2:17:38] The Chariot of is The Horseman thereof
[2:17:40] years ago I used you know just I knew
[2:17:42] that brother Brandon when he um he came
[2:17:45] to see about uh brother uh Bosworth and
[2:17:50] brother Bosworth was in Miami Florida
[2:17:52] and brother brandom came to see about
[2:17:54] him and when he walked into the the sick
[2:17:55] room when he walked into the hospital he
[2:17:57] he he screamed those words my father my
[2:17:59] father The Chariot of Israel and the
[2:18:01] horsemen thereof and brother brandom you
[2:18:03] know said that over Bosworth and I said
[2:18:05] you know if something ever happened to
[2:18:06] brother Wesco those are going to be the
[2:18:08] words that I use over him so if you saw
[2:18:11] one of my posts I only put one post out
[2:18:14] there I put one post those were the
[2:18:16] words that I used and I was praying God
[2:18:18] how could I slip this into the sermon
[2:18:21] and God gave me the five comings of
[2:18:23] Elijah and it would slip right into the
[2:18:25] sermon if you see me when I go now we
[2:18:28] not trying to get brother wesco's Spirit
