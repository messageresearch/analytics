this morning as we just saw took our hearts to receive the word of the Lord a man that's that's what we all come here for brother Nathan will be speaking this morning last night he and his wife and his daughter they flew in about 11:30 last night and probably got the bed and maybe a little after 1:00 and I know just being a speaker sometimes at different services you kind of get in and late and late at night and then you got it kind of trying to feel the atmosphere out and see what your gonna preach the next morning and you know I just pray that God would just use them I think sometimes as ministers when we get into a fix like that then it helps us to get ourselves out the way because the greatest gift is getting yourself out the way and so this one I believe we're gonna hear from having anybody believe that hey man let God use his gift but you have to pull on the gift to get out of it what you need this for anybody need anything all right you got to pull on it to get what you need this move the center field let's just welcome our brother Nathan Eric center to the bull pit on this morning it man as the Lord would just use him for his book he raps and said in light [Music] the darkness tries to hide his ball tribbles at four how great how great see with me aha we'll see say see a man sing that one more time [Music] amen the Great Lord amen amen amen god bless you Saints real good to be with you this morning we just appreciate the the Welcome spirit here appreciate the invitation to come thank you brother Jack for having us and especially thank you for having us in February amen where I live in this time of year the air hurts your face so to be down here in Florida is just wonderful but any time would be a wonderful time to gather together with the saints of God amen we just appreciate you very much appreciate the the spirit here in the church appreciate your worship and sure think highly of our brother Jack and he's just really impressed me as a young minister and and I just think highly of our brother he's a real gentleman amen real not just a gentleman but a Holy Ghost gentleman amen that's maybe a strange way of saying it but how many know what I'm talking about amen just a real gracious man of God we appreciate brother Jack amen god bless you why don't you turn to revelations chapter 21 as I just settle in here for a moment amen just want to bring you greetings from true word tabernacle and Bluffton Ohio from my pastor and grandfather brother ray Erickson and all the saints there send their greetings and we're all just part of the same family of God amen same spirit when we gather together it feels like home amen amen good to be here glad that my wife and baby could be with me I I saw that brother Paul LaFontaine was just here just recently my wife grew up in his church so we sure appreciate brother Paul we know where your you were blessed to have him amen thank a lot of him and and I it's just good to be here I'm sure there were a few other things that I wanted to say and welcome but I can't remember him right now so we might as well read the word to him in revelations chapter 21 and we'll just read the first four verses and this is a beautiful passage of scripture to me because to me this is revealing to us what was in God's heart at the beginning amen the book of Genesis shows us what was at the beginning but this chapter here is showing us what was before the beginning what has been in God's heart all along and what he's trying to bring us to as a people what God has desired the prophet of God said that God in love desired a family of his own amen amen so let's just read this precious little bit of Scripture here these first four verses and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying and here it is behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God Himself amen shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away amen what precious words let's just pray this morning Heavenly Father we thank you for this promise lord this thing that you've held in your heart down through time and down through the ages father to bring your people your family to a place Lord where you could just dwell with them Lord in a personal communion a personal fellowship Lord and we're not waiting for for heaven's gates to open Lord to enjoy your presence but father we believe that wherever two or three are gathered in your name you're present there amongst them father we thank you for a message Lord that has brought a light that we could see who is who is really with us this morning father who is in us what spirit what life it is father that's that's just leading us and guiding us and and ministering to us along the way Lord we just invite your presence this morning Lord if there's anything in our hearts or our minds Lord that would hinder your word Lord your presence father we just want to lay that aside Lord we we're your temple father we're your tabernacle Lord we don't want anything to hinder but Lord this is your house Lord we pray that you would have the Liberty we pray that your Holy Spirit would move with freedom father and just say what you want to say Lord we don't have any agenda of our own that we have come here to try to bring forth Lord but just to be an empty vessel for your word Lord that your glory could come on the scene we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we dedicate this service to you amen amen god bless you Saints as you're seated amen want to say also that we just appreciate being here with with a precious brother Wayne amen and this is my first time actually traveling and preaching with brother Wayne so it's it's a real privilege for me and talk about pressure my might be like in the book acts you know if they you know they say old you hear the the Apostle Paul's in town oh wow you know what is he preaching this morning no Barnabas is but I'm just a young I'm just a young Steven you know just a man just doing all that I can for the kingdom of God not trying to be as somebody but just whatever the Lord can use me for so just a young Steven preaching this morning just don't nobody throw any rocks okay amen all right amen god bless you amen want to want to say appreciate seeing the steamin family also brother Danny been a real hero of mine and and I'm a product of youth ministry and youth camps and things like that and so brother Danny's ministry has been one of the most just one of the most influential tools of God in my life and so we appreciate him this family in church amen well let's uh amen why don't you turn with me to just lay a foundation this morning to the book of Haggai if you can find it Agee I Chapter two I don't mean to joke too much this morning I'm just making myself comfortable this morning but Hagee I the second chapter and if the Lord will help me this morning what I have on my heart is just a little simple thought on the latter glory the latter glory so may God bless the reading of his word and just help us to deliver it the way he has in mind but we're gonna take a foundation here in the book of Haggai the second chapter and we'll read the first 9 verses there and what's happening here in the scripture is this is a time of restoration the children of Israel have been in captivity and so God raised up as a rubble who had come back to read to bring a work of restoration under the authority of a king so you see it's a type and it's a shadow of the day that we're living in a time of restoration a time of restoring the house of God's worship and so that's the day that we're living in but I want to pull something out of this out of this type that just has really struck me recently and and just let the Lord kind of deal with it a little bit this morning but in the seventh month in the 21st day of the month came the word of the Lord by the Prophet Haggai saying speak now to zerubabbel the governor of Judah to Joshua the high priests and to the residue the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory now that's referring to Solomon's Temple which at this point in time had been destroyed when the children were taken into captivity this is Solomon's Temple and how do you see it now this is the new temple how do you see this new temple is it not in your eyes in comparison of Solomon's Temple as nothing yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the Lord and be strong Joshua the high priest and be strong all you people of the land stay at the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts according to the word that i covenant it with you when you came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I'll shake the heavens and the earth and the sea in the dry land and I'll shake all nations and the desire of nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of Hosts the silvers mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former amen say at the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith Lord of Hosts amen Cuse amen to the reading of the word all right so what I what strikes me about this chapter of Scripture here is that I was reading this through the lens of the message and and through the light of the message it's showing that this is a type of the day that we're living in a time of restoration and so the children of Israel have come and they put their labor they've given their lives for the message of their day and they they just they put everything they had into the cause and they've they've they've just labored and worked and given their lives for this work of restoration trying to build up the temple that was torn down amen by the enemy now now but you find here that in the scripture that that there's something in the hearts of the children when they begin to look at this temple that's been restored and then they begin to compare it to what God had done in the past they've begun to make comparisons to the Temple of Solomon and you know how the scripture speaks of Solomon's Temple how it was so big and beautiful and it was full of treasure and it was impressive to the eye and it just had a glamour to it and it had a beauty to it that this new temple didn't even though even though they given their everything to it yet it was a humble house and it was a it was a simple place and there wasn't there was nothing about it that would be have any beauty that would be pleasing to the eye amen and it actually brought a discouragement on the hearts of the people because they began to look around at what God had done and they were looking at the outward signs and they were looking at the outward circumstances and it caused a discouragement because they were making comparisons to what God had done in the past yet not realizing the glory of what was happening right in their myths amen oh I think we're gonna have church this mornin amen because the God raised up a prophet to tell the people to take comfort people of God but even though you look at what God's work and it looks humble it looks small it there may not be the crowds that there used to be there might not be the big buildings or the or the big ministries or all those things but he said there's coming a greater glory Amen into this house say man and I believe what the if you read in the scripture you'll find that the glory of that house that was so much greater than Solomon was one day than this humble little temple the Lord Jesus Christ would come in a body of flesh and walked through the front door that temple amen and the personal presence of Jesus Christ was a greater glory than Solomon because a greater than Solomon had come through his temple hey man hallelujah and I believe today that a greater than Solomon is here amen the thing that is so striking about how the Prophet would t preach that a greater than Solomon a greater than Solomon Amen or was that was what it was it was witnessing to the fact that you know with Solomon's to think the way he brought out is Solomon's ministry was so great you know and how he would he would have wisdom to discern and bring the right answers and things like that and it brought the the world to Solomon the world came to Solomon to feed on that that first pole in that second pole Amen hallelujah but brother Branham said when Jesus came it was a greater than Solomon that had come to his people and the world totally missed it amen amen they came to Jesus when He healed the sick they can't do him when they when he looked into the hearts of man but when he said he must eat my flesh and drink my blood amen and began to open up the word to his people they could not receive it amen but it was a greater glory to be associated with that word even though the world miss it it was a greater than Solomon amen and I'm so glad this morning to be gathered with you people here the bride of Jesus Christ amen the world doesn't see you the world's not looking at you but there's a presence in your myths there's somebody in this temple amen oh my I'd rather be in this Omega Church than the biggest mega church amen I'd rather fellowship with the bride of Jesus Christ amen amen and no a man whose presence I'm in the thing that made it so glorious was the coming of the Messiah the desire of Nations come into his temple amen that's why brother Brennan said the beauty of a church is the character of the people not the building not the you know not the programs and nothing you know not the numbers and things like that but it's the character in other words the life that's in the people is the beauty of the church and Christ is the beauty of this church amen amen because it's his life his character his nature living in you oh my know you not that you are the temple of God amen and that the Spirit of God dwells in you if any man defiles that temple him shall God destroy why because the temple of God is holy which temple you are amen now I want you to see something that the temple of God is a holy house amen it's a holy temple amen not because of what you are not because of the house that you're living in brother this flesh is serpent seed it's not redeemed amen it can't be it can't be reformed it's fallen nature flesh but there's something on the inside amen there's a life on the inside and because he is holy you are holy hey man amen that's why the Bible said I would that men everywhere would lift up holy hands say man there's nothing about this flesh that's holy nothing about it that's that's godly or righteous amen but because of a holy God living on the inside we can lift our hands this morning and it's a Rollie worship under God you can lift up your voice you might not be able to sing your way out of a wet paper bag Amen but it's if you lift up your voice to God it's a sweet savour in his ear Amen because why because it's the holy worship in a holy temple Amen tabernacling a holy God praise God you also as lively stones you've been built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices which are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ acceptable to God by Jesus Christ the Bible says you are accepted in the beloved amen if you're in Christ you're accepted this morning you're holy you're the temple of God amen oh my so don't fear the enemy because him that would harm that temple him shall God destroy hey man acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen ci what I want you to see is that everything that we're teaching around this message everything as we read the there in Revelations 21 what was in God's heart amen above all things was to make his habitation with a family in the beginning he was alone with his thoughts amen but when his thoughts have all become manifest Amen then he can gather with them and gather them together and have a fellowship with those attributes there they were in a mystery for him but today they've been manifested amen all the prophet of God said you are nothing less than the physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God's mind at the beginning amen but he has desired to speak you into this time and this place Amen that you could be expressed so why so that he could have set the ship with you amen oh that's why the camping of the bride and the statue of a perfect man and the restoration of bride tree in the bride age and the Seventh Seal and the third pole and all those things brother the reason there preached the reason they had to be open Amen is for one purpose and that's to tabernacle the presence of God in the seven people not to make a bunch of intellectual quote corners Amen people who can yeah people who can quote all the quotes and spiritual scientists and break it down and analyze it but to bring forth of living people that are manifesting the attributes of God so that he can have personal residence in his tabernacle this morning hallelujah amen it's not to build adoption in the stature of perving they're not to make superhero Christians or or big ministries or big people or some kind of a Pentecostal idea like that but it's to make a humble holy amen consecrated temple to the Spirit of God amen when the church has cast him out amen when he's on the outside knocking on the door there is a bride that was predestinated to receive him amen and that's why it looks so humble that's why it looks so small that's why many people are discouraged brother Jack amen because they're looking at the house amen and not the God that's in the house amen because he's hiding himself behind a veil again amen all can you imagine in the Old Testament how the very pillar of fire the Shekinah glory of God amen would live amongst his people behind badger skins just imagine some dirty old badger running around the desert you know one day he's running around eating worms and locusts and things next thing you know he's tacked up on the wall tabernacling amen and the the pillar of fire oh what a what it's foolish to our minds to think about that amen but brother Branham preached that that back then it was badger skins but today by the unveiling of God amen the the glory of God is behind your skin that's what the message came to reveal was the presence of Jesus Christ but not only his presence but where he is present at today Amen how do I know he and then you ask me how I know he lives he lives within my heart amen all and it's foolish to the eye amen maybe we'll deal with it tomorrow morning but it's the foolishness of God the scripture says Amen it's beyond all of our imagining amen because we look at ourselves we look at the veil that's there always the problem looking at the veil and the humility and the frailty of the veil amen but but oh my but see that's the reason he chose that veil amen he said my strength is made perfect in weakness my grace is sufficient for you and I've chosen the weak things of the world the mean things of the world the lowly amen the poor the uneducated amen the unknown that's who I've chosen that no flesh may glory in my presence oh my but if the presence of God is living with you amen then it's a greater glory than even Solomon's Temple it's a greater glory than it was in those badger skins why because we're we're just a little bit closer to what God is desired that he would dwell with his people and God Himself would be their God God chose you not in spite of your humility but because of it he hides himself in simplicity in humility Amen a humanity so this bride she might not be the biggest or the brightest Amen but but she is the temple of the Lord and that's what a message will reveal to you that you are the temple of his presence amen now how do you become that temple amen you got to come just like Solomon's Temple now and Solomon's Temple you know they built it up big and beautiful and a whole lot of work went into it there was a whole lot of fountain they laid a foundation you know and they they had a lot of effort they had a lot of works and things like that and that was all contributing to that cause because it made a it made an impressive show you know it made a Mencia you know and then they dedicated it to the Lord and they had all kinds of fine prayers and offerings and things like that and they although all the religious works and the religious rituals and things like that that was all Wonder amen but you know there was temples all around the world temples all around the world you know that were bigger than Solomon's and probably and maybe more beautiful and and held more riches and amen and and more Fame but but there was something about that temple had to come to a place amen the Bible said when the when Solomon had made an end of praying when the praying was done when the church attendance was over amen when all the singing was over with something had to happen in that temple the fire of God had to come down from heaven and fill it up and fill it up right man and that's what it's got to be for every Christian life when the brains over with when the church membership is all done have you come to the place where the fire of God has filled you up and made you the temple of the Holy Ghost amen the fire came up from heaven and it consumed the burnt offering in the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house amen and the priest could not enter amen into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled it up amen if you ever come to the place till you get baptized with this fire till the Holy Ghost is living in you as a temple not it moved on your flesh not it blew past the front door but it came and made its residence in your heart amen then there's no more mediator you don't need your pastor anymore to pump you up every Sunday morning you don't have to run to the Deacon every time you got trouble you don't need the song leader to stamp his feet and get a fire going there will be a fire all the time [Applause] Amen that holy fire not a strange fire your ideas won't work anymore your opinions won't work anymore the way you were raised in your background and the way your daddy used to tell it and the way your old pastor in the denomination used to teach it that won't do it anymore because it's not your house anymore hey man but it's his house it's full of his fire amen burning up for God see all the beauty and all the sacrifice and everything would have been in vain if God didn't fill that house Amen you know there was pyramids in Egypt that made Solomon's Temple look tiny hey man but they were full of dead people but Solomon's Temple was full of the life of that pillar fire glory to God glory to God hey man I want you to see brother Branham said once a year that high priests had to come into that temple and he had to be dressed a certain way oh my now at the priests house the priest could dress how he wanted he could walk the way he wanted he could do whatever he wanted long as he was in his house but when he came to God's house he had to be dressed a certain way he had to be anointed a certain way they had to be anointed with that perfume of the Rose of Sharon had to run down to the hem of his garment amen not just a sprinkling I had to be a full baptism amen and on the end of his garment he had a bell and a pomegranate and he had to walk a certain way amen to make that play a song a man there's a whole lot of people out here in these denominational churches they got a good song amen but see he had to play a certain song amen a certain song and he had to walk a certain way because when his walk was right it would cause that Bell to play a song that was holy holy holy unto the Lord amen now listen now when you get a revelation of the presence of Jesus Christ if you ever really say this see this minute this message that's the day legalism will die amen because it's no longer amen do's and don'ts and rules and regulations but you will understand that there are things that we don't look at because these are his eyes there are things that we don't do cuz these aren't his hands places we don't go cuz these are his feet it's his temple his tabernacle glory to God but I would rather full of the fire of God I would rather be full of his glory than to be some grape a Hollywood Palace some great dad Egyptian to a man I want to be a living temple full of a living God amen so I'm gonna walk a certain way I'm gonna dress a certain way speak a certain way what's he doing he's approaching the Shekinah glory oh the real fellowship and he had to make a noise and the only way the congregation could tell he wasn't dead is because they could hear the noise amen I tell you when the church lets off its noise there's something that happens as Shores the world because everywhere the Shekinah glory is there's a noise I tell you if there's a Spirit of God in you there will be a noise there will be a reaction there will be something in your heart to respond to the word Amen I don't care if you shout I don't care if you dance I don't care if you sit there real quiet and cry but there will be a reaction it will be some dead religion but there will be something in your heart to respond to the word and honest and a genuine reaction to the word Amen because word recognises word Amen the Spirit of God recognizes the Spirit of God Amen something on the inside I'll say Amen to the word Amen what that is that's that fire in that temple what am I talking about the quickening power not emotion this morning but power quickening power that can bring you to life all we need that quickening power I know we got so deep and we got so mature and we got so educated in the message till we can't shout no more Amen but listen here now brother branham said quickening power open the seven seals and clicking power will let us see his coming so until you've got under that quickening power you haven't even seen the message yet yes amen amen it's got to have the quickening power to bring that seed to life amen all my we got to where we can teach this message so good and I love teaching amen I love teaching amen but we've got it too we taught it so perfect it'd be like we had the body of Jesus Christ laying here just as perfect as when they laid him in the tomb but until the Spirit of Christ comes into the body of Christ it's never gonna live but if that quickening power the race Christ from the dead dwells in you it'll live it'll do the works of Christ it'll live the life of Christ it'll have the nature of Christ that's what we need in this day amen we got the mechanics just right but just one time let those dynamics strike I meant that perfect teaching and then what kind of a church would it produce amen hallelujah amen whoa oh I know we're beyond Pentecost you know we are more than that he said we got all that plus amen but the reason we need that plus what we got amen is because they had all the steam but nothing to apply it to Oh am i but I'm so glad a prophet said in 1965 amen he said that I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to all people all times all places that the Pentecostal blessing should always remain and what is the Pentecostal blessing it's the evidence of the resurrection you asked me how I know he lives he lives within my heart he never gave me a message amen and got me all educated and got it all worked out in my mind and sent me out to work it out on my own amen but God never sends a message and then leaves it up to man to bring it to pass God is his own interpreter hallelujah amen I still gotta preach tomorrow so don't pull it all out Amen but God's his own interpreter amen we get so much like Moses till Moses knew the message to such a place till he was raised in it his momma taught it to him all his life and he knew beyond a shadow of doubt that he was to be that deliverer amen but he got impatient and he got in what brother Graham called intellectual faith now brother Ram didn't say intellectual faith was wrong but he said it was a first phase Amen this is why are people still toss about he said there's two phases first one's intellectual and the second one's by experience Amen there wasn't anything wrong with his intellectual faith the problem was he got ahead of God's timing because it wasn't up to Moses to deliver the people a man God was gonna do the deliveries amen so Moses got to thinking wow you know I just got it seems like we got such good teaching we got such a good understanding seems like there ought to be something happening seems like we oughtta well you know we ought to hold some meetings or get some brothers together we oughtta we got to do something we got to do something amen amen just like the seven thunders took the message and said you know we got to do something Amen or perugia would take a part of the message and say we got to do something we got to do something but it was before God's time amen so Moses went out and I put all his human effort into making something happen killed himself warned Egyptian what a deliverance amen and it took 40 years in the backside of the wilderness through tests and trials and things to beat all that pride out of him till he got to the place where brother Bram said he came before that pillar of fire and when he met the pillar of fire he met he knew the message he cut his teeth on a message Pew he was raised in it he was like me he was a message brat amen but nnn and he knew all about it Amen but he had to come to a personal experience with the pillar fire rather Ram said a man has no right to stand behind a pulpit and preach unless he's met that pillar fire personally but he didn't leave it with the ministry said anyone who wants to call themselves a Christian must come to a personal experience with God and when he did brother Brahim said something so wonderful he said there at that pillar fire his faith was anointed it was anointed amen and then it was a one-man invasion hey man oh we can't do away with this quickening power brother sister that's our only hope it's the only way we're gonna fulfill now we're not doing away with the word they'll be the word and no we want to go my way we've not gone further on from the message we've gone further in today amen and it's more real now than it ever was by the quickening power that's what I believe I'm not putting it off in the future I'm not looking to what God into the past I'm looking for that latter glory hey man there we found the topic again hey man oh how do I know people think that we're too mature for those Pentecostal blessings hey man till they get all we're so mature you know till we can't have all those things hey man I'll tell you something that's not mature that's old it's barren it's dried up amen I tell you Sarah she was every bit the Bride of Abraham amen but until she was restored back by the earnest of the inheritance restored back to her youth she could never bring forth the promised son which is the coming of the Lord and I tell you this bride unless she's restored back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers she will never bring forth the coming of the Lord she won't do it hey man she's got to be restored but she won't be like these Pentecostals who've got that youthful exuberance and they got that energy and things amen but they won't take the seed but this bride will not only go back to her youth she has received a seed it's been sealed into her womb the seed word of a pure message man Oh am I in an hour the quickening power has brought that seat to life and it's growing and it's pushing out and then and it's advancing it's happening right before your eyes brother sister but if you're looking at the veil you'll miss it all together just like the world has missing but Christ is here in his bride and he's showing himself to be alive and soon and very soon the very rapture will come right out of the womb of Sarah oh my but we got to be like Mary a man or men you ever compare Sarah and Mary there in the word how they both had the same thought how could this be Sarah said how could it be seeing I know not a man you know I never went to Bible School you know we I never heard of these big these great teachers and things and these people got such revelation you know and I just I just humbly believe the message best I can you know how could it be me brother Jack hey man how could it be the angel said fear not with God all things shall be possible amen Mary said how can it be seeing I know not a man fear not Mary with God all things are possible so you've got to come to a place where you stop wrestling with this message and start believing it for a change amen if it says you're an invincible army why don't you take God at His Word one time and say be it unto me according to thy word I'm looking at this batch of skin and I don't see it and I can't understand it but something in my soul believes it something about me I just got thee O that the audacity to say maybe that could be me maybe I could be that bride that invincible army maybe I could fulfill the mission the Ministry of Christ everything he said about this bride Oh could it be me I've got to believe it could for with God all things are possible amen amen glory amen that's why we want the spirit moving in the church we want the quickening power poured out we want to see the supernatural we want to see people get born again amen you know I found out well I just got one little baby there that found out when that baby was born there's something about when a baby's born everybody around gets new life amen my life totally changed amen grandpa and grandma their lives changed and mama's life sure changed there was a whole lot of change happening in the family when the baby was born and that's why when we got altars full of young people being born again that does something for a church and then because it shows that we're not gathered around a dead religion amen but it's still moving and still working and still pulling and it's still leading us on to the rapture amen amen but we got to the place where we're so mature and so such quote quoters and so dignified till we got like brother Adam said it be like a woman who doesn't want to bring forth a child because it would mess up her figure it would take away her dignity it would take away your pride you know her bishop status you know and and so he said that that's the way the church is today they don't want any of now this is 1964 or five so this is after the opening of the word he said she don't want any of those looping hollering tongue talkin Pentecostal young uns runnin around cuz it would certainly embarrass her it would certainly bring her shame in the community everybody would look down on her church because they're so many mature they're so Pentecostal hey man hey man when I married my wife or when my married me and and came down to my church somebody pulled her aside this was a message believer said ho you don't want to go down that little Amish Pentecostal Church down there can you imagine Amish Pentecost I don't know if they they couldn't figure out if we were to bound or to free but amen but you know there's something in my heart Amen people might look down on it but I'm so happy to be associated Amen with that young thriving bride of Jesus Christ amen oh and and there's somebody watching over her amen there's something you know every time there's a real fire of God amen there's always a chance of wildfire now amen now that people like to use a quote well I'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all you know of course I want their real fire amen but you know the only time you got to worry about a wildfire springing up if is nobody's tending that fire amen brother and said this bride won't go into fanaticism because there's a mama Eagle that's hovering around the waiting to catch her amen oh the devil don't care which side he gets you on if he can't make you dried up and formal he'll take you off in a fanaticism and he doesn't care which did she gets you into amen but there is a bride that'll go right down the middle the road of this message she's not going into fanaticism amen but the devil won't steal her joy he won't take that shout out of the camp why because everywhere the Shekinah glory is there's the noise hey man I know it might have been silence when that seventh seal open but that's because he was down here and wherever Jesus is there's noise glory to God I believe he's here this mornin somebody ought to ring those joy bells hallelujah he's here he's there that's more than a superstition that's more than a church tradition it's the reality of his presence but you don't see him because he's hidden hey man you know they're back there on Azusa Street when the Pentecostal outpouring came I've read the testimonies aware where of young people children they were children at Azusa Street and I've read their stories how that when they the Shekinah glory would come into that building so thick like a cloud until the children played hide-and-seek in the Tabernacle in the Shekinah glory what a glory what an outpoint and there were people that would testify of how that pillar of fire well they'd be out on the street and watch the pillar of fire go up and down over that building amen amen but it seems like they don't see that around the Pentecostal churches anymore and they wonder where it went and they're waiting for it to come back but I know where it is I believe that glory gathered itself up and it appeared to us above the head of a prophet in Houston of indicating a message but it didn't stay there with a prophet but I believe that pillar fire tongues of fire went out men and possess the Tabernacles of spoken word children of God and today we're bearing about in our bodies that very Shekinah glory the world doesn't see it and sometimes we don't see it but it is nothing but the truth it's nothing about the truth I'm not waiting for a prophet to return I'm not waiting for a great revival to strike America I mean that brides revival because why I've been revived I've been brought to life there's a life inside of me just like Sarah just like Mary oh just like Eve but this one won't fall she can't amen hallelujah hallelu yeah hallelujah amen see if your pride is in yourself you've missed the humility of his presence if it's about who you are and your ministry and what you can do brother Anna said in perfect strength by perfect weakness he said there's one thing that we must master and that's the thought of human ability one little thought that you've got any ability a man I thought when I started preaching you know because I was educating went to school and things like that and have common intellectual type of personality well I thought the Lord would be able to use that you know and I thought how naive you know I I thought well you know Lord surely you know you'll let me you allow me to just you know break things down that way or whatever it would be you know whatever you want Lord but surely you'll be able to use something and he hasn't yet because it's not the human ability but God is his own interpreter now if it's it's the humility of his presence amen oh that's why if we ever get so stuffed up and so self-righteous and so educated and intellectual around this message amen you need an outpouring you need something Amen you need get under the the movie in the spirit sometime and break that off of you you got to get like David amen till he got to dancing he got the revelation of God's presence being restored amen which brother am tied to the opening of the seventh seal amen and that revelation didn't cause him to get stuffed up he didn't go get a big tall chair and say look at me how I open up bro how I brought the opening the word and brought the ark back in and look how I can teach and preach and all these things no he got to dancing he got the victory Amen and he had to dance amen and believe in his own family look down on him amen until all those kingly robes of dignity fell off hey man oh man if you ever get to the place brother sister to get to be such a stuffed shirt around this message till your Joy's gone till you can't be moved by the Holy Ghost I tell you wouldn't hurt you to get down a roll on the floor a little while till all those worlds of dignity fall oh my people Mitel down at Mary with that baby in her arms brother and said it didn't make any difference what they thought she knew whose son that was and so is every believer that accepts God's Word into their heart I don't care what the system say you know what it is you were there it happened to you amen let them call you Pentecostal Holy Roller fanatic whatever they want let them call you a cult and man followers any of these things they want to you know what happened you know who you were and who you are now you knew what it was like when that message came off the pages and into your hearts that's what we need around the message is eyewitnesses a man there's hardly anybody left alive that wasn't as an eyewitness to what God did through brother Branham but we've still got witnesses in this bride a man a man never met the Prophet but they meant the one that was with that prophet they met that pillar of fire amen eyewitnesses of a Living Word Bible says we all with open face are beholding in a glass amen beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord now that's a mirror you're beholding the glory of the Lord in a mirror amen and and now and we're but now as we behold as it's revealed now for them back for Paul it was dark amen but see we've got a little more light so we're seeing a little more clearly and as the picture becomes more clear the Bible says we're beholding in a glass the glory of the Lord and we are changed into the same image from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord by the Spirit of the Lord that's why I want the moving of the Spirit amen not just to feel those emotions which I love which are wonderful but I want to be changed into this image Amen when I feed on this message I hope you're feeding on this message amen I want to feed on it until I begin to change begin to see that chain I began to see that glory begin to appear when I look into that mirror not looking at the flesh but just enough light that I could see what's in the inside amen if you oh if all your religion isn't bringing a change in your life it's all in vain it's all in vain believe this message fifty years if you want to if it never changed you Amen you might as well been on a barstool amen amen you in a hurry this morning I want you to know that there is a Antichrist spirit working amongst the churches today brother Graham said there was a last plague coming it was a plague of spiritual death it's a pale horse rider now that horse isn't riding against the Catholics he's not riding against the Pentecostals he's already killed them but that pale horse rider is riding against the bride of Jesus Christ he would like nothing better than to put you in a message pill and keep you as dead and starchy informal and worldly as he can get you and make you think that because you belong to a church because you associate with the message because you've got a real good pastor that everything's all right amen but brother oh my I'm so glad that spirits not going to deceive the elect it's so deceitful that it can sit right next to you're a true believer amen and you can't tell the difference but today we're in manifesting time amen and those seeds are beginning to be revealed that's why many people have fallen away from this message amen because they couldn't just compromise and sit on the edge anymore but it's getting tighter and tighter amen but somebody somebody's gonna leave this thing somebody's gonna live this message a man not just be a church member I tell you there's no salvation in the association of the message there's no salvation in the name of object offer or Nathan Eric cent or or William Branham but there's one name given under heaven whereby men may be saying the only way to be identified by that name is not to have a picture on the wall amen but to have that image of his glory refill on the inside the tabernacle deity of God Dan is not in heaven it's in yo [Applause] hallelujah oh Christ is in his breath you were called to be the very tabernacle of his presence a man that Shekinah glory that presence amen the message that came to us was Christ a person hallelujah hey man amen hey man it's the message the message isn't things that happen wonderful things that happen 50 60 years ago I love hunting stories but the messages and hunting stories it's not all these things brother oh why did God sent a prophet you ever ask yourself that question you know I this this is some real to me because I told you I was raised in the message and spent about 20 years on a message Pew before I ever asked myself the question what is the message a man cuz to me it was a lifestyle and it was traditions and it was the Association of churches it was certain things that we were taught certain doctrines that we hold dear that's all that it was to me hey man but I'm so glad for that light a man that would reveal who it was that was speaking me through that prophet a man who it was and what it was that he had pre decimated me to be amen I don't believe in and in taking this message amen and just put it on a pedestal you know and you can you can sit there at home a week after week day after day and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again amen and you know all you'll ever hear is your own opinion bouncing back and forth most the time amen but see I believe in a message that lives that's why I believe in a fivefold ministry that's why I believe in coming to church that's why I believe in Peter I want a Living Word a man not some dead letter amen you got it figured out here it's the spirit and the truth in this Tabernacle hallelujah all right amen because that's what the message came to produce we're not trying to take it and twist it into something else no oh my trying to hold something back amen you say well I don't believe that well 1964 brother Brown said of you God had so much complete control of those old Saints till he was their very voice their action hallelujah said give me a church that's so completely anointed with God till their every action and move is thus saith the Lord and walk in that Shekinah glory I'll show you a messiah standing on the earth who has this Melchizedek a man see Christ my brother my sister is in his bride he's in his bride oh so don't look now to Solomon's Temple don't look back at the apostles don't look back to the prophets but it's the glory of the latter house is where we're living today its Christ in you the hope of glory that great mystery amen amen I think we might have to come back over some of these things at another time because I really want to dig into that but but see so don't let anybody take your place don't let it don't leave it for somebody else to feed on this message don't move it for somebody else to have it reveal you know I got we got to a place where people have taken it things in a fanaticism they take the message you know the preach Perugia preached seven thunders appreciate for false doctrines and things like that or and do all these things it's made people almost swear they don't wanna oh we don't want to preach the deep things we don't wanna you know we don't need all those mysteries and things like that we just need you know let's just preach baptism the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal blessing things like well then what would separate us from the Pentecostal church amen but see we've been given something more than what they had but let me tell you brother sister the deep things is a scare word of the devil it's nothing about a scarecrow there are no mysteries left in this word Amen all my because a prophet came and the mysteries of previously hidden truth but today it's been revealed to a bride Amen it's not deep it's not complicated it is open and available to every anointed child of God I don't care how young you are how old you are Amen oh my I don't care if somebody who called himself a teacher came and tried to open it up and left you more confused than when he started hey man there is a real word that is avail this message is for you all right I can't hold it back this is your land Joshua don't you know Moses my servant is dead he's dead amen now they're waiting for him to come back but he ain't coming back but don't worry Joshua as I was with Moses so I am but if you want to take the land now then you've got to remember the word of Moses don't look to the left don't look to the right but look at this word don't get on the television no don't go to joel osteen don't look for the charismatic don't look to the Pentecostals look to the word of my prophet and as I was with that prophet I'm gonna be with you and you're gonna take this land that's why I say because people you know you can preach you can preach that we got more than God sent a prophet you preach that all around the country if you want to and everybody will rejoice amen buddy kind of find out that a lot of times what I'm saying is not what they're hearing because what they're hearing is well we got more than God send a prophet that means my opinion has marriage that means I can take the message and the parts I don't like I can kind of Reason them out and do things that's not the way I'm going at it brother I've not gone further on from the message I've gone further in everything that William Branham prophesied I believe that I am part of that bride that's called the fulfillment [Applause] hallelujah where is the Lord God of Elijah amen where is the Lord God allow a Utah you know when when that great prophet Elijah was taken off the scene amen there was a little I show there that had followed that prophet he had followed him everywhere he went he listened to him he leaned on him that was his prophet and the line should type not an eight day messenger but he typed the bride of Jesus Christ a man and that bride when that prophet was taken off the scene he begun to go through a mourning period and again ago it began to cry out and say oh my father my father the chariots of Israel horsemen in there he was crying out God you took our prophet what are we gonna do now amen well they raised up a whole bunch of what they called the sons of the prophets the school the prophets they said well let's go look for him amen read the ante they're still looking for her a man they got a plane waiting for him and everything else they're looking for him to come back a man Elijah said will you go look for it if you want to but I'm gonna stay right here I'm gonna stay right here where he left me and I'm just gonna get to thinking about things you're gonna look for him I'm gonna sit and that mourning period came to an end and something came on the heart of Elijah a man until he began to read I remember when that prophet preached the mighty God unveiled I remember he preached to me the restoration of the bride tree I remember when he preached these things the masterpiece he preached about me he came and found me in that denominational field that I was in and he took the mantle of a pure word and he put it on my shoulders well he didn't fit me then amen but well I wonder what would happen if I took the word that prophet preached and just try it on one more time and he put it on he said hey that fits pretty good a man and something came on his heart a man when everyone else was looking for a prophet to come do it for him a man something came on the heart of Elijah where is the Lord God of Elijah and he took the mantle of that message it couldn't have been his mantle it couldn't bend his old his old hole or his old or his old rake or any of his old gardening implements he took the mantle of that word and he had the confidence to take it in his own hands and strike the water and a few ever brother/sister get to the place where you take this message for yourself take it into your hands realize that it's for you realize that the presence of Jesus Christ is for you realize you are the tabernacle of his presence today realize that Christ working through a bride today strike the water and one of these days we're gonna take that word a man will strike it so pure that bride will say it just like he said it the spirit and the prophet and the bride saying the same thing and the River Jordan old part Amen we'll go over to where death will be no more almost here brother sister oh my but as long as we're looking back to that old Temple of Solomon looking back to the gifts of Solomon you're never gonna see it but when Jesus came amen to that new temple it was a humble coming to a humble house amen a humble coming to a humble house and the world missed it the priests miss it the princes of Israel missed it but thank God there was a Simeon thank God there was an Anna with spiritual eyes that were open to say oh here it is the one the nations have desired it's the desire nations has come and he shook the world with his crucifixion in the world missed it amen but I tell you amen a greater than Solomon is here today he's in his bride the world has missed it brother they missed this message they're never going to see it any man oh but there's a bride whose eyes have been opened and we know that the desire of nations is here but I want you to know what the nations are groaning for what the whole well it's groaning for today is the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God it's groaning for you it's crying out for you amen hallelujah oh how beautiful hey man behold the tabernacle of God is with men he will dwell with them and they shall be his people God himself shall be with them and be their God brother if the son of man ministry ended for you with the death of a prophet you have missed the very message God's name amen you know you've got to recognize your day and its message now how many believe we're living in the end time we know what day we're living in my coworkers know what day we're living in I talked to people they don't even know the word they don't even go to church and their testimony as well it's just the world's falling apart it meant their conscience of it they're seeing the day that we're living in they just have missed the message but brother you can sit in a message pew and miss the message of the hour you can sit here on the banks of the River of Life and die of thirst amen but don't do that brother sister we could begin to look into this message you will find that you are the message of the hour and it's you you are the restoration of the bridegroom you are the masterpiece you are the mighty god unveil Oh hallelujah you're that oddball amen oh yeah yeah that's me that's me I'm identified with it hallelujah hey man there's something happening in this rock there is a ministry in this Brian that's going on amen amen I know people don't believe it amen they still look into a prophet or else they've lost the faith in a prophet in a message but there is a royal seed that's just waiting to be quickened waiting to be in their bright conditions where it can come to life a royal seed of Abraham bro Graham said this day the scripture is fulfilled he said it's a royal bride to the royal promised son and it won't be a natural seed but a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son and she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her I want you to know we're not here by accident we're not gathered here around this message by happenstance this time this place this season is a promise that's given to you and I that there will be a bride and she will be an overcoming army amen she will overcome Laodicea hey man things that are to be and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living let's stand you know in the Old Testament they had that tabernacle the God came and spoke through his prophet he said if you want to worship me you've got to come and worship me in the place where I've hidden my name you'll find that God's provide a place in other words where I've put my nature his name is his nature his life and he hides it in the earth and if you want to worship me said you've got to come to that place where I've hidden my name brother sister his name's not behind badger skins today amen it's not being expressed through that Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee amen his name isn't being revealed it's not being preached by a prophet today named William Branham but he's hidden himself in a bride that's called by his name now if you want to worship Him that's where you've got to approach him if this world wants to come to God they've got to come through you don't you understand your ministry maybe we'll deal with it more Lord willing but I want you to see now you are the temple that God has restored it's more than doctrine it's a people it's a life amen amen he wants to hide himself in you in this world so that everybody who comes in contact with you has an opportunity to come to Christ now that won't work with your opinions it won't work with your ideas you know it's so glorious it's more it's a more glorious thing that we could ever hope for on this earth that we could never hope to achieve something so great not even a Pope or a priest could could could hope to truly fulfill this ministry oh but it's worth everything amen and that's so I'm what I'm asking you this morning what is it worth to you to be that temple to be that tabernacle to have that that name of God that nature of God hidden up in you to be called by his name identified with that message to be that pride to me it's worth all my hopes my dreams my ambitions my desires maybe somebody by lifted hand and say I I want to surrender all that I am to this i lord I want to be your temple Lord I pray if there's anything in this world let us pray together Lord if there be anything of this world that would hinder the moving of your spirit in this temple Lord I pray the fire of God that consuming fire would burn it out this morning Lord I want to be that temple I want to be that Tabernacle Lord and it's worth everything I don't want to hold on to anything that would hinder Lord I give it all to you Lord for this glory the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared Lord I pray as we're entering into this weekend Lord when the message is going to be preached Lord with power and demonstration that father we would just empty everything out Lord and become an empty house Lord ready for the fire of God to fill it up I pray O God may every heart make a consecration Lord in their own way in their own heart to you Lord we offer up all that we are all that we have Oh all that we ever will be Lord is yours it's only by your grace Lord there's no flesh here that wants to glory in your presence Lord but the glory is yours then the glory then the power then the kingdom Lord we dedicate this temple now to you in the name of Jesus Christ god Bless You Saints it's been real good to be with you we certainly appreciate the Lord Jesus and how he's used our precious brother this morning I couldn't think of a more fitting message to start meetings

have spent my money just to get here but we want God to come down and fill his people I want to encourage your church as we approach these the next few services of everything let's let's approach it
