[9:53] God Amen well let's just bow our heads
[9:55] and open a word of prayer oh dear
[9:58] heavenly father we thank you for this
[10:00] gracious moment Lord that we could be in
[10:02] your house once again Lord just thank
[10:04] you Lord for uh save traveling mercies
[10:07] here Lord just thank you for keeping us
[10:09] Lord through the week so far Lord and
[10:11] we're nowhere here because of your grace
[10:13] and your mercy and oh Lord I pray you
[10:15] move me Plum out the way Lord I pray you
[10:18] speak to each Heart Lord like you would
[10:20] need to Lord father may you have the
[10:22] preeminence in your house Lord preminent
[10:24] in your body Lord and Lord we pray that
[10:26] you just bring every scripture to life
[10:28] bring each quote to life Lord and let us
[10:31] just go away and just say our hearts not
[10:33] burn within us as we walked and talked
[10:34] with you and almighty God we just say
[10:37] Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name we
[10:39] pray amen well let's open our Bibles up
[10:42] and we'll go to Hebrews chapter 4 very
[10:46] familiar scripture
[10:48] reading amen who's thankful to be in the
[10:51] house of the Lord this evening amen
[10:54] amen so we'll start with verse
[10:58] one
[10:59] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[11:02] being left of us of entering into his
[11:04] rest any of you should seem to come
[11:06] short of it God bless you may the Lord
[11:08] add a reading to his Blessing of his
[11:09] word you may sit down praise the Lord I
[11:12] I want to keep you guys up the whole
[11:13] chapter
[11:15] so so we'll go to verse Two For unto us
[11:19] was the Gospel preached as well unto
[11:21] them but the word preached did not
[11:23] profit them not being mixed with faith
[11:25] in them that heard it so we see there's
[11:27] a promise left to us of rest yes and
[11:31] everybody in the world is looking for
[11:32] some type of rest amen no matter it can
[11:35] be through alcohol it can be through
[11:36] drugs you name it but what they don't
[11:38] know is the only way you can get this
[11:40] rest is through Christ you got to be in
[11:42] Christ so let's keep going verse three
[11:44] for which that believe do enter into
[11:47] rest so we have to believe that the rest
[11:49] is for us personally because unbelief
[11:52] will take you out of that rest and so as
[11:55] he said as I have sworn in my wrath that
[11:57] they shall enter into my rest although
[11:59] the works were finished from the
[12:01] foundation of the world for we speak in
[12:03] a certain place of the seventh day on
[12:05] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[12:07] day from all his Works verse 5 and in
[12:10] this place again if they shall enter
[12:12] into my rest seeing therefore May that
[12:15] some must enter therein they to whom it
[12:17] was first preached enter not in because
[12:19] of unbelief so we see the children of
[12:22] Israel they didn't enter into the land
[12:24] of rest because of unbelief even though
[12:27] they said Mighty works of they can say I
[12:30] seen frogs I I've seen all these
[12:32] Miracles but when The Showdown came from
[12:35] them to take God after the word he could
[12:37] they could not enter into to that rest
[12:40] so it behooves us to always make sure
[12:43] that we are taking God at his word don't
[12:46] assume it I don't care how bad the
[12:47] situation may seem you take God at his
[12:50] word am amen let's go to verse 8 now for
[12:53] if Jesus had given them rest then he
[12:55] would not afterward have spoken of
[12:57] another day I look I love verse n right
[12:59] here there remaineth therefore a rest to
[13:02] the people of God and I believe we're
[13:03] all the people of God here and there's a
[13:06] rest for you whatever situation you're
[13:08] going through there's a rest right for
[13:10] you verse 10 for he that's entered into
[13:13] his rest he's also ceased from his own
[13:15] works so you're no longer trying to
[13:17] figure it out you're no longer trying to
[13:19] do this way and this way and that way
[13:20] but you're trusting and resting in God
[13:22] knowing that he's going to make a way
[13:24] for your situation yes sir I think a lot
[13:26] of times we worship our situ ation than
[13:29] worshiping God I'm going say one more
[13:31] time A lot of times we worship our
[13:32] situation than worshiping God so it says
[13:36] verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter
[13:39] into that rest so we we have to play our
[13:42] part and laboring isn't trying to do all
[13:44] these things but it's surrendering it's
[13:46] yielding and resting and the title of
[13:48] this sermon is yielded and resting and
[13:51] the subject is rested in Christ so when
[13:54] we're yielded we can therefore enter
[13:56] into that Holy rest and think God died
[13:59] on the cross so you could have that Holy
[14:01] rest but a lot of times we don't want to
[14:03] accept that Holy rest because we want to
[14:05] try to figure everything our own way we
[14:07] want to have control in every situation
[14:09] but we have to give God control in every
[14:11] situation of our life stop trying to do
[14:13] it your way amen verse 12 for the word
[14:16] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[14:19] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[14:22] to the dividing aunder of Soul Spear and
[14:24] the joints and the marrow and is a deser
[14:26] of the thoughts and Tents of the heart
[14:28] think about that so it's nothing that
[14:29] you can hide from God Amen you may say
[14:32] profess with your mouth but you're
[14:33] believing but God is going to see if you
[14:35] truly mean it from in here amen verse 13
[14:38] neither is there any creature that is
[14:40] not manifest in his sight but all things
[14:42] are naked and open to the eyes of him
[14:44] with whom we have to do I love this
[14:46] verse right here says seeing then we
[14:48] have a great high priest that is passed
[14:51] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[14:53] let us hold fast our profession for
[14:56] we're not a high priest which cannot be
[14:58] touched with the the feeling of our
[14:59] infirmities but was in all points
[15:01] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[15:04] so a lot of times you know that song I
[15:06] forgot that song uh what a friend we
[15:08] have in Jesus A lot of times we we
[15:10] forfeit this peace that we have because
[15:13] we we can't recognized that that God was
[15:15] once on Earth he had feelings he he had
[15:19] sickness he had pain he had sorrow so he
[15:21] knows what you feel and he can relate to
[15:24] how you're feeling so why not trust in
[15:26] the high priest that we have just pour
[15:29] your heart out to him I don't care how
[15:31] bad the situation is God has a solution
[15:34] for your problem and I think a lot of
[15:36] times we get sometimes get so caught up
[15:39] in our problem that we never think we
[15:40] can ever get out of it this it's like
[15:42] when somebody's addicted to drugs they
[15:44] they feel like there's no way out but
[15:46] there's always a way out God Will Make A
[15:48] Way out with there seem with no way
[15:50] that's the kind of God that we serve
[15:52] verse 16 let us therefore come boldly I
[15:55] I love that it's not talking about some
[15:57] prideful boldness but what it's talking
[15:59] about is you come in boldly knowing that
[16:01] it's his merits it's what he has done to
[16:04] make a way so you can have a solution so
[16:06] you can have peace so you can have rest
[16:08] so you can have victory in the trial see
[16:10] a lot of times we let the devil dis beat
[16:13] us I said this statement before don't
[16:14] let a defeated creature defeat you
[16:17] because when Christ died upon the cross
[16:19] he defeated every work that the enemy's
[16:20] done to you and and you have power
[16:23] through Christ I can do all things
[16:25] through Christ who strengthens me so
[16:27] it's not you but is Christ in you the
[16:29] hope of glory giving you an the
[16:31] overcoming Victory that's right sir amen
[16:33] let's go to numbers
[16:35] 14
[16:39] amen
[16:41] hallelujah let's go verse 14 we go vers
[16:46] 6-9
[16:48] amen amen so it says and Joshua the son
[16:52] of N and Caleb the son of je forgive me
[16:55] jeffan which were of them that searched
[16:57] the land rent their clothes so we see
[16:59] that there was 12 Spies that went into
[17:01] the land right and out of the 12 only
[17:05] two of them had a good report right and
[17:07] so imagine the majority just imagine all
[17:10] the majority all all the uh the pressure
[17:13] that Joshua and Caleb had they all these
[17:15] people just going against them saying
[17:17] the same things that they saw but Joshua
[17:19] and Caleb they were of a different
[17:20] Spirit the Bible told us they they saw
[17:23] what God did in Egypt right and they had
[17:26] faith that the same God that did those
[17:28] things in Egypt can do the same thing to
[17:30] the land that he promised them right
[17:32] let's keep going verse 7 and they speak
[17:34] unto all the company of the children of
[17:35] Israel saying the land which we pass
[17:38] through to search it is exceedingly a
[17:40] good land if the Lord Delight in us when
[17:42] he will bring us into the land and give
[17:44] it to us a land flowing with milk and
[17:46] honey I love what they said right here
[17:47] verse n Only Rebel not ye against the
[17:50] Lord neither fear ye the people of the
[17:52] land for they are bread for us their
[17:55] defenses departed from them and the Lord
[17:57] Is With Us fear them not so if the Lord
[17:59] has promised you something it's going to
[18:01] come to pass I don't care what the
[18:04] gangers say I don't care all these
[18:05] things say but have faith that if God
[18:07] has spoke to you personally that it's
[18:09] going to come to pass every promise in
[18:12] the book is yours is just waiting for
[18:14] you to have the faith to match it praise
[18:17] God and Allah brother Bram said we have
[18:19] we have faith to get in our car we know
[18:21] it's going to start that's the same type
[18:22] of faith we need with the word of God
[18:24] and let God increase your faith because
[18:27] when God speaks to you you have to
[18:29] exercise it you have to cultivate it
[18:31] don't just leave it here at church but
[18:33] bring it with you the Monday Tuesday
[18:35] Wednesday Thursday I think a lot of
[18:37] times we we hear a good word but we
[18:38] don't take it with us to work we don't
[18:40] take it with us to home and we got to
[18:42] take it everywhere we go because God
[18:44] loved you so much he had a personal word
[18:46] for you that day and so you got to take
[18:48] that just take it into your heart praise
[18:50] God hide it in your heart let it be
[18:52] manifested in your life on a daily basis
[18:55] amen amen so we see not everybody's
[18:59] going to agree with you not everybody's
[19:01] going to see the way you see but if God
[19:03] has spoken something to you and it lines
[19:04] up with the word of God then no man can
[19:07] take it away from you and no man can add
[19:08] to you hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[19:11] let's go to Isaiah
[19:15] 28 and so I think a lot of times we we
[19:18] like brother Smiley was saying we get so
[19:20] caught up in carnality we let emotions
[19:22] just dictate our spiritual walk with God
[19:25] and emotions aren me ar ar aren to
[19:27] dictate your spiritual walk with God
[19:29] faith is to dictate it because emotions
[19:31] you're not always going to feel like you
[19:32] want to pray I I promise you that so
[19:35] when the motivation isn't there
[19:36] discipline must kick in see you look at
[19:39] the word disciples it has the word
[19:42] discipline in it right and so the
[19:43] disciples had to constantly discipline
[19:46] themselves because they didn't have a
[19:48] group of Believers like we do they they
[19:49] literally had to go from place to place
[19:51] to place they even sold everything that
[19:53] they had didn't have a car didn't have
[19:55] nothing but what they had was all they
[19:57] needed was God and so I think a lot of
[19:59] times we get so caught up in the
[20:00] amenities of this world and all these
[20:02] fancy things and we get lazy because the
[20:05] enemy is constantly trying to get our
[20:07] eyes fixated off of Christ and we we're
[20:11] more busy than we were 20 years ago I
[20:13] can say the older I get the more
[20:15] responsibilities I get the more busier I
[20:17] get and so the devil's constantly he the
[20:19] devil tries to get to get you distracted
[20:21] on good be good
[20:23] things it's not going to be some bad
[20:25] thing but it's good things it be family
[20:27] it could be a job be all these things
[20:29] that can come up but if anytime we take
[20:31] our eyes off of Christ and put that
[20:33] before him that becomes an idol in your
[20:35] life I know it's a powerful statement
[20:36] but it's anything that takes you away
[20:38] from Christ is a idol in your life I
[20:40] don't it could be your wife it could be
[20:42] your kids you have to put God in his
[20:44] proper place put go if you put God
[20:47] number one your time will open up I
[20:50] promise you that a lot of times we say
[20:52] oh man I don't have time to pray I I
[20:53] just want to say hi Lord by Lord you
[20:55] ain't going to have a walk with Christ
[20:57] you ain't going to have an intimate walk
[20:58] with Christ just saying Lord and by Lord
[21:00] so the thing is we need to make time for
[21:03] God don't just pencil in your schedule
[21:05] see you make time to go to work you make
[21:07] time to uh to feed your face all these
[21:10] things but why can't we make time for
[21:12] God and then we complain about the
[21:14] situations we're in but we're not
[21:16] willing to do what God told us to do
[21:18] labor into that rest and the word when I
[21:21] say labor you got to surrender you got
[21:23] to fight the good fight of Faith because
[21:26] the enemy knows when you get to that
[21:28] rest he can't touch you but if he can
[21:31] get you not being rested then he has you
[21:33] right where he wants you because he
[21:34] knows that your abilities cannot defeat
[21:37] him but he knows that Christ is the only
[21:39] thing that can defeat him amen go off my
[21:44] notes right so I remember the stat I
[21:47] think brother bam I said it but is God
[21:49] is not obligated to give you any more
[21:51] light until you follow the light he has
[21:53] already given you I'm say it one more
[21:55] time God is not obligated to give you
[21:57] any more light until you follow the
[21:59] light he's already given you so a lot of
[22:01] times we want revelation but are you
[22:03] following the Revelation that God has
[22:05] given you first see you can't have the C
[22:07] before the horse right amen so I LIF the
[22:10] word up resting is ceasing to move or
[22:13] act ceasing to be moved or agitated
[22:16] lying leaning standing depending and
[22:18] relying so you're standing and relying
[22:20] upon the word of God that you know it's
[22:22] going to be manifested in your life at
[22:24] God's appointed time so you got to hold
[22:27] on to that promise no matter how how
[22:30] hard the enemies attack you you got to
[22:31] hold on to that promise because it's
[22:33] better than gold it's a gold standard
[22:35] God would rather bankrupt the all of
[22:38] Heaven than his word to fall void so
[22:41] amen amen so I said Isaiah 28 didn't I
[22:44] so Isaiah 28 and we'll go with verse 12
[22:47] and then we'll go to verse
[22:48] 10
[22:51] amen so it says in verse 12 to whom he
[22:54] said this is the rest where withth you
[22:56] may cause the weary to rest and this is
[22:59] the refreshing yet they would not hear
[23:01] it so we we see we live in a world where
[23:05] everybody wants a get-rich quick scream
[23:07] or they want to help my problem now
[23:09] scheme that's exactly right and those
[23:11] things aren't going to work that's right
[23:13] so you can say hey I can go to
[23:15] pornography I can go to alcohol I can go
[23:17] all these things but those things only
[23:19] patch up what can only make you cuz it's
[23:22] a it's a hole in your heart and if I get
[23:24] shot a Band-Aid is going to help it I
[23:27] got a disinfect I got to clean it I got
[23:29] to treat it so a lot of times people
[23:31] don't want to let Dr Jesus treat their
[23:33] conditions so if you don't never let Dr
[23:35] Jesus teach a condition then how are you
[23:38] ever going to have a solution to your
[23:40] problem see we're searching all these
[23:42] things oh I need to do this I need to do
[23:44] this what you need to do is get in your
[23:45] knees amen that's what's going to help
[23:47] your situation getting get in the word
[23:49] of God get in the message of the Hour
[23:51] come that's what that's what's going to
[23:52] help your situation stop trying to look
[23:55] on this Google all these things aren't
[23:58] going to help you there may be good
[24:00] ideas but they ain't going to solve the
[24:02] problem amen let's go to verse 10 for
[24:05] precept must be upon precept upon
[24:07] precept line upon line here little and
[24:09] there little so stop trying to be
[24:12] control everything just follow God's
[24:14] words God has given us a blueprint how
[24:16] we need to live our life he's hitting
[24:19] Simplicity he's not hitting a math
[24:20] equation at a square plus b square C
[24:23] square but he's hid in Simplicity we
[24:25] make it we make God sometimes we make
[24:27] God he he he's this far out being but
[24:30] God is right here he's inside of you yes
[24:32] sir why not trust the god that's inside
[24:34] you he LEDs you this far he's going to
[24:37] lead you all the way through if he
[24:38] started a good work in you then he is
[24:40] going to finish it let him finish it sir
[24:43] stop trying to see his hands are tied if
[24:46] you're not having faith in him you mean
[24:48] when Jesus he's walking by this certain
[24:50] city he couldn't do anything because of
[24:52] the unbelief so you had to walk right on
[24:54] by so same thing in our lives if we're
[24:56] not letting God he's knocking the door
[24:58] of your heart right now if you're not
[25:00] letting him in then he can't do anything
[25:02] even though he wants to do something
[25:03] it's like brother Bram said he wants to
[25:05] give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[25:07] want it it's like a pipe that's about to
[25:08] burst that's right but he's not going to
[25:10] give the Holy Ghost this to anybody he's
[25:12] going to give the Holy Ghost who he
[25:13] trusts who we know he puts that spirit
[25:15] and he's going to f fulfill what he's
[25:17] called them to be amen so let's go to uh
[25:20] we go back to Hebrews 4
[25:23] 14-6 so it says Sing then with a great
[25:26] high priest that is pass into the
[25:28] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[25:31] fast our profession says for we have not
[25:34] a high priest which cannot be touched
[25:35] with the feeling of our infirmities but
[25:37] was at all points tempted like as we are
[25:40] yet without sin Let Us therefore come
[25:42] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[25:44] may obtain mercy and find Grace to help
[25:46] in the time of need I remember this one
[25:48] preacher said this statement he said
[25:50] Jesus was so busy but he still found
[25:52] found time to rest so think about that
[25:55] Jesus every day was busy busy busy busy
[25:57] doing the work of God but he still knew
[26:00] that he had to rest in God so the same
[26:02] thing with us yeah you can be busy but
[26:05] not being productive didn't say
[26:06] Washington said a statement like that so
[26:09] don't be just busy but be busy for the
[26:11] things of God because this life is going
[26:13] to pass away right doesn't matter how
[26:14] much money you put in the 401K it
[26:16] doesn't matter how much money you put
[26:17] this way and that way how many nice
[26:19] things you have I'm not saying we can't
[26:21] have all those things but if if our
[26:23] heart is directed towards getting these
[26:25] nice things getting to retirement what
[26:27] about the work of God he just didn't
[26:29] seal you and fill you with the Holy
[26:30] Ghost so you can do your own thing but
[26:32] he he had works that only he could use
[26:35] you to do in your community see I can't
[26:37] reach I can't reach where brother Jack
[26:39] can't reach and he can't reach where I
[26:40] can't reach so the thing is we got to be
[26:42] Heavenly minded be focused Jesus was
[26:45] Purpose Driven how many believe that
[26:47] that's right he he was about the
[26:49] father's business and he understands you
[26:51] have a job you have kids he understands
[26:53] all these things he's just waiting for
[26:55] you to have that that perfect balance is
[26:56] only through the Lord Lord amen if
[26:58] you're not playing every day don't take
[27:00] days
[27:01] off when God died for you he didn't take
[27:03] days off if God gave you your best his
[27:07] best to you you got to give God your
[27:08] best he's least worthy of that I
[27:11] understand God knows we go through all
[27:13] these difficult situations but don't let
[27:15] those become excuses am a lot of times
[27:17] our excuses sound so good to ourselves
[27:20] that we deceive our own self that we
[27:22] deceive our own self not even knowing
[27:24] that's right amen amen amen I'm read a
[27:28] quote this is from 1950 Ministry
[27:30] explained well he was wounded for our
[27:32] transgressions and by his stripes were
[27:34] healed Jesus Hebrews 3 31 a high priest
[27:38] of our confession now any of you
[27:39] Scholars knows that the word profession
[27:41] is translated as the same profession
[27:44] he's the high priest amen amen now from
[27:47] the church of living God 1951 now if you
[27:50] accept now what he's done for you then
[27:53] now he's the Hebrews 3 31 so think about
[27:56] that you have to accept that first
[27:58] yeah you can read all day and all night
[28:00] but if you don't accept that into your
[28:01] heart it's going to do you no good how
[28:03] many how many Bible scholars read the
[28:05] same word that we're reading and don't
[28:07] have a revelation of who Jesus really is
[28:10] they may know about him right but do
[28:12] they know him cuz you can I can know
[28:14] about somebody but if I never met him
[28:16] personally then I don't know who he is
[28:19] amen so it says he's the high priest of
[28:22] our confession anyone who knows the
[28:24] scripture know that the word written
[28:25] profession but it's the same word TR
[28:27] translated confession now in other words
[28:29] he can't save you by your merits of your
[28:31] prayer he can't save you by the merits
[28:32] of your enthusiasm or your good works he
[28:35] saves you by the merits of what your
[28:37] faith and your confession for you if you
[28:40] confessing before men him will I confess
[28:42] before my father and the Holy Angels and
[28:44] whatever listen close any Redemptive
[28:46] blessing that's written in the word is
[28:48] yours think about that so it's not about
[28:51] how good of a person you can be but it's
[28:53] about having faith knowing that it's
[28:54] nothing that you could have done to
[28:55] obtain your salvation nothing you no
[28:57] works you could have done but he did it
[28:59] for you and your faith has to rest in
[29:02] that and now a lot of times people get
[29:04] that mixed up while I have to do
[29:05] anything I can just relax but no you st
[29:07] when you give your heart to God the
[29:09] devil puts a Target on your back and you
[29:11] got to fight that much harder than I was
[29:13] on the world I didn't have all these
[29:15] problems I just chilled just played
[29:17] video games just did my thing but when I
[29:19] gave my heart to God man it's like the
[29:21] devil was attacking me in every fast and
[29:23] every situation because he knows if you
[29:26] get connected with God going to be a
[29:27] problem in his King he going to tear his
[29:29] kingdom up glory and so think about that
[29:32] if we're rested in Christ we can tear
[29:33] the devil's Kingdom up like ver SM say
[29:36] we can lend a helping hand to somebody
[29:38] because somebody lend God sent somebody
[29:40] lend a helping hand to us why not we try
[29:42] to do the same thing let God use you let
[29:44] God use your vessel use your lips use
[29:46] your mind amen hallelujah amen so I love
[29:50] the this word profession I looked it up
[29:52] I like looking words up says open
[29:54] declaration so it's not something that
[29:56] you hide in a COR
[29:58] but your it's a decoration a public AOW
[30:01] or acknowledgement of one's sentiments
[30:02] or beliefs as a profession of
[30:04] friendships or sincerity a profession of
[30:06] faith and religion and like brother Bram
[30:08] said confession and profession mean the
[30:10] same thing oh our the act of
[30:12] acknowledging profession and I look the
[30:14] word up labor too because in Hebrews uh
[30:16] 4:11 it says we got to labor to enter
[30:18] into that rest and it means to work to
[30:20] till to cultivate so this like a garden
[30:23] if you're planting a garden and you
[30:25] plant the seeds and you order it once a
[30:28] month is it going to grow no no you got
[30:32] to constantly cultivate you got to te it
[30:34] you got to make sure that it's in the
[30:35] right environment right and the same
[30:37] thing with I walk with God are you in
[30:39] the right environment because if a plant
[30:41] is not in the right environment it will
[30:42] not grow to full maturity so if you're
[30:45] not putting yourself in the right
[30:46] environment the the same type the the
[30:48] right kind of friends the uh uh things
[30:51] you're watching on the TV your phone
[30:53] whatever it is social media then you're
[30:54] not going to grow properly so the thing
[30:57] is make sure you're in the right
[30:59] environment so it's so important the
[31:01] people you hang around with I think you
[31:03] are the average of the five friends you
[31:05] spend the most time with so if if you're
[31:07] hang out with people who are dragging
[31:09] you down who aren't who aren't pointing
[31:11] you to Christ who aren't lifting you up
[31:12] high then is it worth it because the
[31:16] Bible tells us not to be unev and yolked
[31:18] right and it's good to like I said it's
[31:20] good to have friends but make sure those
[31:22] friends are help building you and not
[31:24] destroying you a lot of times we can
[31:26] yeah they can be fun to hang around with
[31:28] but are they pointing you closer to
[31:30] Christ or driving you further away to
[31:31] Christ especially the young people we
[31:34] got to make sure who you're hanging
[31:35] around with that's right because you're
[31:37] at a age you're at a ripe age right now
[31:39] where where you're like a sponge you
[31:40] soak these things in and you can get
[31:42] influence a lot more easier than
[31:44] somebody who's older than you right
[31:46] that's why it's so important watch the
[31:47] things you're watching social media
[31:49] YouTube It's a trap they're a blessing
[31:51] but they're a cursing because God can uh
[31:54] because the devil can get right in there
[31:56] and use and turn that blessing into a
[31:58] cursing by by little popup ad that's how
[32:01] he works I remember I remember brother
[32:03] Bram said this statement he said that he
[32:06] may not be able to get you look at a a
[32:08] fully naked woman but he could take just
[32:10] enough clothes off so apply it to any
[32:12] situation he can he can just get a
[32:15] little bit in there and just get just
[32:17] enough for you to take your eyes off of
[32:19] Christ amen thank you
[32:22] brother so so
[32:24] let's is it
[32:26] on I think it's good it's good amen so
[32:29] let's go to uh Luke
[32:31] 13:24
[32:33] amen I like this song The I'm not going
[32:35] to sing it but the more that I Surrender
[32:37] the lighter my load the more that I
[32:39] release my cares the more you take
[32:41] control so a lot of times we want to
[32:43] hold on to the cares of this life we
[32:45] want to hold on to the problem but the
[32:47] thing is we're missing the rest we can
[32:50] have and we got to let go let go of
[32:53] those problems stop letting them just
[32:55] engulf your life because God God didn't
[32:57] call you for your problems to engulf
[32:59] your life like brother Smiley said we
[33:01] don't have to
[33:02] drown God is saying I'm here that's
[33:04] right but you have to make that decision
[33:06] though God isn't going to force himself
[33:08] he's going to kick the door down but
[33:09] he's waiting for you to realize how much
[33:12] you really need him amen so I said Luke
[33:18] 13:24 I like this word that it uses in
[33:21] this in this rendition in Luke 23:24
[33:24] says strive to enter in so lot says
[33:27] strive to enter in so notice that you
[33:29] play got to play a part it's not that
[33:31] you just just lay it you just walk in
[33:33] but you got to strive says strive to
[33:35] enter at the Straight Gate for many I
[33:37] say unto you will seek to enter in and
[33:39] shall not be able to so that's what
[33:40] we're talking about so many people want
[33:42] this they have a desire but they're not
[33:44] willing to pay the price so you got to
[33:47] pay the price for a Christian walk cuz
[33:50] it's like this you have right side and
[33:52] left side you can choose the pleasures
[33:54] of this world just like Moses had a
[33:56] choice you can choose a pleasure to this
[33:58] world you can choose suffer the reproach
[34:00] of Christ and you could have a live a
[34:02] good life by living a worldly life you
[34:04] can make millions of dollars and have
[34:06] all popularity but at the end of The
[34:09] Journey death and destruction is right
[34:11] there so is it really worth it i' rather
[34:14] be dirt pole like brother Smiley said
[34:17] than to be Filthy Rich and not know God
[34:20] you know is it worth it you know it's
[34:22] not worth it let go to Matthew
[34:25] 7:13 all right
[34:27] amen so it says enter ye at the Straight
[34:30] Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is
[34:32] the way that leadth to destruction Look
[34:34] what Jesus says right here and many
[34:36] there be which going there at so the
[34:39] straight and narrow is only few are
[34:41] going to make it because they're going
[34:43] to be willing to crucify themselves
[34:45] Jesus said you can't even follow me
[34:47] until you first crucify yourself you got
[34:49] to deny yourself daily verse 14 because
[34:53] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[34:55] way which leadth unto life and few there
[34:58] be that find it so the Bible's telling
[35:00] me few there be that find it so it's
[35:02] telling me that we really got to just be
[35:05] desperate desperation is going to change
[35:08] the situation just like with Hannah God
[35:10] saw the desperation she had in her heart
[35:13] to have a kid and he looks at the motive
[35:14] of why you're asking for something and
[35:16] when she asked for the child she said
[35:18] Lord I'm going to dedicate it onto you
[35:20] and so that's what really touched the
[35:22] heart of God what you're asking for why
[35:24] are you asking it the prophet said to
[35:26] check your motive because a good motive
[35:28] can turn into a mixed motive so that's
[35:31] why you got to you got to do an
[35:32] inventory check David said search me and
[35:35] try me so you constantly got to check
[35:37] and
[35:38] see what why are you doing what you're
[35:40] doing what's what's your driving force
[35:42] what's your why amen so we see the
[35:46] importance of faith in Hebrews 4:2 For
[35:48] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[35:50] unto them but the word preached did not
[35:52] profit unto them not being mixed with
[35:54] faith them that heard it so he said to
[35:56] state before unbelief takes you out of
[35:58] the rest but belief keeps you in brother
[36:01] John Martin said this statement if you
[36:03] don't exercise faith it will shrink
[36:06] exercise the faith God has given you so
[36:09] we have a a spiritual man in a in uh and
[36:12] a uh carnal man a white dog or a black
[36:14] dog that's right so whatever dog you
[36:16] feed the most is going to come out on
[36:18] top amen faith is a vehicle faith is the
[36:22] vehicle we use to move forward with God
[36:24] think about that without faith you came
[36:26] and please God it's like having a car
[36:29] but having no gas in it it's not going
[36:31] to take you anywhere amen we have to we
[36:34] have to enter into this rest it's not
[36:36] something that just falls into your lap
[36:37] it's not a Christmas gift or a birthday
[36:39] gift but it's something you have to
[36:41] strive for because the devil's going to
[36:43] fight against you tooth and nail he's
[36:45] going to fight even more because he
[36:46] knows his time is short we're coming too
[36:48] close to be lazy Paul said Redeeming the
[36:52] time so our time is precious one of the
[36:55] greatest things you can give God is true
[36:57] sincere time because time with him
[37:00] that's how you build just like a house
[37:02] if you're building a house you don't put
[37:04] time into it it's never going to be
[37:05] built so we're a house God is trying to
[37:08] build us into the house that the
[37:09] blueprint is in
[37:11] here
[37:13] amen see amen let's go to Proverbs 18:10
[37:20] amen so I know a lot of times we just
[37:23] get so so beat up in this life sometimes
[37:27] and I love what I love it in 1810 what
[37:29] it tells me I don't have to be beat up
[37:32] but I can 1810 says the name of the Lord
[37:37] is a strong tower the righteous
[37:40] runthe so there's a strong tower that
[37:43] you could not just go to when you need
[37:45] it when when you're all broke down but
[37:47] stay in that Tower see lot lot of times
[37:50] we don't want to stay in the Fortress of
[37:51] God we want to venture out we want to
[37:54] try this or try that but stay in stay in
[37:57] that rest because is it worth being
[38:00] stressed worrying cuz you know stress
[38:03] causes gray
[38:04] hair it it does and it even caus health
[38:08] problems too so God didn't call you to
[38:11] be he didn't die so you had to be stress
[38:12] in his life he
[38:14] didn't amen and let's go to um we'll go
[38:17] to Psalms 18
[38:19] 1-2 so think about this God is your rock
[38:23] he's your Fortress your deliverer your
[38:25] Buckler the Horn of your salvation and a
[38:28] strong tower look at all these benefits
[38:30] that we have a lot of times we don't
[38:33] utilize these benefits we got to utilize
[38:36] the amenities that God has given us
[38:39] because when we use all these
[38:41] amenities then God is going to be God in
[38:43] your life let's go to 18 uh verses one
[38:45] I'll read right here put verse one on
[38:47] the screen for me
[38:48] please amen so it says I will love thee
[38:52] oh Lord my strength I I love what David
[38:54] says right here he doesn't say just
[38:56] strength but he says my it's personal to
[38:58] him so you got to make God personal to
[39:00] yourself you you can't just know about
[39:03] God but you got to know God personally
[39:04] that he is your strength go to verse two
[39:07] please amen says the Lord is what my
[39:11] rock your personal Rock and my
[39:14] Fortress and what my
[39:16] deliverer my God my strength in whom
[39:20] will I trust my Buckler and the Horn of
[39:23] my salvation and my high tower come on
[39:26] David knew God personally he could say
[39:29] these things he experienced all those
[39:31] things in his life so God has to
[39:33] constantly be your rock be your Fortress
[39:35] your deliverer because he can deliver
[39:37] you out of any situation the enemy puts
[39:39] you in says no weapon formed against me
[39:41] shall prosper it can't amen amen I love
[39:46] what the prophet says right here why are
[39:48] people so tossed about did you ever meet
[39:49] a person that's been in there he's
[39:51] tasted living on this Mana you can meet
[39:54] him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday th
[39:56] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy
[39:58] day Bright Day gloomy day things are
[40:00] going right wrong he's always sweet
[40:03] always full of love never talked or do
[40:05] anything wrong he's living under the
[40:07] glory of God he never gets hungry he
[40:10] never has to go to church and they get
[40:11] built up I love that statement right
[40:13] there see a lot of times we go to we go
[40:16] to church and and expect the pastor to
[40:18] make us feel good the pastor to just to
[40:20] preach in a certain situation thing is
[40:23] you don't you you don't go to church to
[40:24] be built up but you go to church to see
[40:26] where you're at with God and you should
[40:28] be feeding on the same word that was
[40:30] preached on Sunday and you should become
[40:32] excited brother BR said we should be the
[40:34] happiest people in this world cuz we
[40:36] know what Jesus Christ did for us we
[40:39] know what it took for him to to give us
[40:41] a way of escape to Deliverance
[40:43] Hallelujah so we should be smiling yes
[40:45] sir I I know I know times are troubl
[40:47] times are rough but we serve a God who
[40:51] who's above all those things above all
[40:53] those
[40:54] things amen amen amen but has to come
[40:58] here is your whole makeup is Christ your
[41:00] attitude see attitude is everything
[41:03] right a attitude can can take you out of
[41:06] a situation or take you back into a
[41:07] situation and the prophet said the right
[41:10] mental attitude towards any Divine
[41:12] promise of God will bring it to pass so
[41:15] to God your attitude is important the
[41:17] Bible even tells us do all things
[41:18] through murmurings and disputings so a
[41:21] lot of times we we get so caught up in
[41:23] complaining that it kills our faith when
[41:26] more you complain the more it kills your
[41:28] faith then you start begin to doubt a
[41:30] little seed of Doubt comes in you start
[41:31] complaining and complaining so when that
[41:33] when a complaining Spirit comes kill it
[41:36] right then and there even the Bible
[41:37] tells us in uh 1 John 4:1 uh beloved try
[41:42] the spirits it says try the spirits so
[41:45] brother Bram said the greatest battle of
[41:46] fall is in your mind so you got God
[41:49] trying to talk to you and the devil
[41:50] trying to talk to you and you got to be
[41:52] able to uh to distinct which voice is
[41:55] speaking to you sir because not every
[41:57] thought that comes into your mind is of
[41:58] God I'm say one more time not every
[42:00] thought that comes into your mind is of
[42:02] God so you got to make sure you know who
[42:04] God is just like the prophet say you got
[42:06] to know your enemy know your savior know
[42:08] your God know your rock know your
[42:10] Fortress know your
[42:11] deliverer amen amen so the only labor he
[42:16] tells us to labor into his rest says
[42:18] when you work I rest when you rest I
[42:21] work so we're trying to do all these
[42:24] things and we're getting so wore out and
[42:25] tired
[42:26] huffing and puffing and and sweating and
[42:29] then God isn't doing anything cuz you
[42:30] ain't letting him do
[42:32] anything but he says when you rest he
[42:35] works right see I said to statement
[42:38] earlier he was so busy but he still
[42:39] found time to rest when the pain comes
[42:43] the supply is already there think about
[42:45] that God knew when you got in that fiery
[42:47] trial he already had a supply waiting
[42:49] for you but has to be uh it has to it's
[42:52] a one I'm trying to see what's the word
[42:54] I'm looking for it it'll come back to me
[42:58] amen good uh so think about that
[42:59] statement everything you have need of
[43:02] Lies inside of you think about that
[43:04] waiting to be quickened by the power of
[43:06] the Holy Ghost that's the word I was
[43:08] looking for so a seed has to be
[43:25] deratization
[43:28] that's not that's not a humble Spirit a
[43:30] humble and contrary Spirit no wise will
[43:31] I despise that's what God said amen
[43:36] amen let's go to Hebrews
[43:47] 11 so Hebrews 11:
[43:50] 1-3 and then we'll close with uh Matthew
[43:53] 11 so it says now Faith is the substance
[43:58] of things hoped for the evidence of
[44:01] Things Not Seen think about that I got I
[44:04] got another quote from Brother John make
[44:06] sure your faith is not missing the
[44:08] substance I me brother Smiley said that
[44:10] I was like wow God faith comes with
[44:14] Assurance peace and confidence I'm say
[44:17] one more time God faith comes with
[44:20] Assurance peace and confidence yes sir
[44:23] verse Two for the for by the elders
[44:26] obtained a good report and through faith
[44:29] we understand that the worlds were
[44:30] framed by the word of God so the things
[44:32] which are seen were not made of things
[44:34] which do appear and let's jump to verse
[44:35] six but without faith but without faith
[44:39] it's impossible to please him so you
[44:41] can't even please God you can go all the
[44:42] soup suppers you want to all these
[44:44] things you give your body to be burned
[44:46] but there's no faith in that knowing who
[44:49] God really is then how can you ever
[44:51] please him how can you ever please God
[44:52] without faith for he that come to God
[44:56] must believe that he is and he's a
[44:58] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[45:00] him so right off the bat right off the
[45:02] rip you got to come to God knowing who
[45:04] he is he's a prayer answering God he's a
[45:06] mighty God he's a holy God and I don't
[45:08] think we reverence God
[45:10] enough and how you treat others is how
[45:12] you treat God I don't think we reverence
[45:14] the house of God enough either we got to
[45:16] reverence the house of God cuz God is
[45:19] worthy God is all omnipresent he's
[45:21] everywhere so we kind of just put God in
[45:23] a box like he's only here but God is is
[45:26] everywhere he's even inside of you
[45:28] that's right so you can call on a God
[45:30] you can call God any time of the day you
[45:32] can pray to him any time of the hour
[45:33] don't be scared he's right there let's
[45:36] go to Matthew 11:28 I remember I was
[45:38] studying this I was studying this uh
[45:40] this title this little study about rest
[45:43] and I love how when when God just brings
[45:45] it together I was looking at Hebrews 4
[45:48] and and Matthew 11 I was like Wow Paul
[45:51] was talking about that same rest that
[45:52] Jesus was talking about in Matthew 11 it
[45:54] really just hit home I was like wow I've
[45:55] never never seen like that
[45:57] before so Matthew 11 and we'll go verses
[46:02] 28-30 amen so it says come unto me all
[46:06] ye that labor in are heavy laden and I
[46:09] will give you rest so he's offering this
[46:11] rest to
[46:12] us a hand out he's like his hand is out
[46:15] he's waiting here I have this rest for
[46:17] you are are you willing to to do what it
[46:19] takes and he gives us a formula right
[46:20] here take my yoke upon you and learn of
[46:23] me for I am meek and lowly in heart and
[46:26] you shall find what rest unto your souls
[46:29] see I know vacations are good but when
[46:31] you come
[46:32] back life is right back there right
[46:34] going but if the soul is resting doesn't
[46:37] matter if the boss is yelling at you
[46:39] doesn't matter if if your wife isn't
[46:41] talking to your husband isn't talking to
[46:42] you you're
[46:44] rested right amen says for my yoke is
[46:48] easy and my burden is light so so we got
[46:53] to be resting more God has made a way
[46:55] that we can rest every day doesn't have
[46:57] to be Wednesdays Sundays Mondays
[46:58] Tuesdays but 7 days a week we can be in
[47:01] this rest yes sir let's go to Hebrews 4
[47:03] one more
[47:07] time and we'll close with this last
[47:12] verse
[47:16] amen it says there remain therefore a
[47:19] rest to the people of God and go verse
[47:21] 11 let us labor therefore to enter into
[47:24] that rest lest any man fall after the
[47:27] same example of unbelief so let's from
[47:29] this day forward let's let's let's be
[47:31] striving to enter into this rest cu the
[47:34] more you're rested the more you can be
[47:35] focused and we're not rested we're not
[47:38] focused God has a certain specific
[47:40] calling in each one of our lives and
[47:42] it's to be more like him and the more we
[47:44] can get focused and fixated on that the
[47:46] more God can use us in the magnitude
[47:48] that he wants to use us in not not as
[47:50] much as you want but what God wants cuz
[47:52] what you want and what God wants are
[47:54] night and day he said my thoughts are
[47:55] not your thoughts my ways are not your
[47:57] ways and so let's trust in God he knows
[48:00] what he's doing it's not his first time
[48:01] around the block he knows what he's
[48:03] doing he said he he he has plans for
[48:06] your life plans to prosper you plans to
[48:08] give you an expected end so he knows
[48:10] what you need spiritually and physically
[48:13] but seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[48:15] his righteousness and all these things
[48:17] shall be added onto you it says not just
[48:20] something but all these things spiritual
[48:22] and physical so seek him with all your
[48:25] heart God Will Supply every need that
[48:27] you have he'll Supply your needs not
[48:29] your geds I'm saying one more time he'll
[48:31] Supply your needs not your
[48:33] geds so amen yes sir Let's us bow our
[48:37] heads in a word of prayer almighty God
[48:39] we just thank you for this Precious
[48:41] Moment Lord thank you for just being God
[48:44] thank you for being so thoughtful and so

[48:52] cleanse us Lord that you can wash us
[48:54] clean Lord I pray from this day forward
[48:56] Lord we'll no longer try to be in
[48:58] control of every situation of our life
[49:00] but Lord we'll learn to let you have
[49:02] control we'll learn just to lay down and
[49:05] rest in you lay down and surrender Lord

[49:28] name we pray
[49:34] [Applause]
[49:42] amen faith has peace
[49:48] conface Assurance peace and confidence
[49:51] thank you
[49:53] brother I'm trying to make sure get my
[49:58] notes
[50:00] um brother um Mark did a wonderful
[50:04] job um and it's it's good to come to
[50:07] church and and
[50:11] um just be strengthened by the word um
[50:16] sister Abby if you would just um bring
[50:20] up the song what a friend we have in
[50:22] Jesus uh for me just put the words there
[50:25] and I'll uh go back to it here in a
[50:29] second um I I I like this statement that
[50:33] brother there's a lot of statements he
[50:35] made but this one regarding uh make sure
[50:38] your faith is not
[50:40] missing
[50:41] substance and the substance that he was
[50:44] saying God's faith uh has
[50:48] Assurance um Peace and
[50:53] confidence um that is just um you know
[50:57] that's
[50:58] just it I don't know I think it's just
[51:01] something that just kind of settles you
[51:03] no matter what you're going through here
[51:04] tonight you got to have
[51:08] assurance and big one is is
[51:11] peace
[51:14] confidence I'm confident that God going
[51:16] to do exactly what he said he going to
[51:19] do I don't know how long it's going to
[51:21] take him but he's still going to do it
[51:23] right and actually what I've learned
[51:25] over the years is the longer it takes
[51:28] the greater the miracle the greater the
[51:31] testimony and another statement that he
[51:33] made there earlier is
[51:36] um uh when he he he said he looked up
[51:38] the word profession and it's an open
[51:44] declaration uh often times uh we have
[51:48] faith and sometimes it's just limited
[51:50] and only people know it is us but
[51:53] sometimes amen when you're confessing
[51:55] Ing and professing something you have to
[51:58] open your mouth yes you got to open it
[52:01] wide and I just thought about you know
[52:03] when he when he said an open profession
[52:05] I thought about the story of John Ryan
[52:08] and um the man had come before the
[52:10] prayer line there with the prophet and
[52:14] um you know brother brandom had told him
[52:16] you know you're healed he was a blind
[52:17] man he says you're healed you're heal
[52:20] and John Ryan left and you know and he's
[52:22] you know he's went a couple days and
[52:24] realized and I'm not seeing yet and uh
[52:27] I'm going to go back to this prayer line
[52:30] and I'm going confront the prophet and
[52:33] it says um I thought you told me that I
[52:35] was healed and brother random say I
[52:37] thought you said that you
[52:40] believed right and uh and and so he he
[52:44] said yeah I do believe he says well he
[52:46] said I tell you what you do you know you
[52:48] just keep going through your day and you
[52:51] just keep saying by his stripes I'm
[52:54] Healed right and that was a profession
[52:57] that was a confession and the man when
[53:00] he would he would sell newspapers
[53:02] blinders I don't know what extra extra
[53:05] Read All About It by his stripes I'm he
[53:08] a conf open profession right and he just
[53:12] kept doing this over and over so finally
[53:13] one day he he done it so many times and
[53:16] people heard him say that he sitting in
[53:17] the barber's chair and the barber said
[53:19] you know you got to
[53:21] stop bringing uh this this you know just
[53:25] disg Grace to uh the kingdom of God
[53:27] because you know you you you say by a
[53:29] Stripes I'm Healed but you you ain't
[53:31] healed you blind he said he says uh Read
[53:34] All About It by his stripes I'm Healed
[53:38] open profession and he took up out the
[53:42] barber chair took off running down the
[53:45] street and the barber running behind him
[53:47] now the same man that told him he was
[53:49] bringing disgrace to the gospel is now a
[53:52] part of the
[53:54] testimony
[53:56] and he chasing the man trying to get him
[53:58] to stop you going to get hit by a car no
[54:00] I'm not I can see the car by his stripes
[54:03] I'm here you got to have a open that's
[54:07] right a open declaration that's what
[54:10] your profession is a open
[54:14] declaration sometimes you got to just
[54:16] tell the doctor I understand what you
[54:19] saying I'm not I I I get it but by his
[54:24] stripes
[54:26] I'm Healed that's my open declaration I
[54:31] believe sister uh Amanda had to do that
[54:34] one time with the doctor and just kind
[54:36] of had an open declaration and God made
[54:39] her body come right in line with what
[54:40] her Declaration was God is a good
[54:44] god brother brother Mark

[1:00:04] on Sunday after after the service I was
[1:00:07] just overjoyed and I just got home and I
[1:00:11] was just thinking about the service but
[1:00:12] what really uh blessed me uh what I'm
[1:00:15] why I'm here today I was thinking about
[1:00:17] sister Zelma's testimony and you know I
[1:00:20] told myself that I am going to you know
[1:00:23] give a praise report on on Wednesday uh
[1:00:25] when I have the opportunity but uh it's
[1:00:28] really a short testimony and uh it's
[1:00:30] it's not the uh the typical testimony is
[1:00:34] just really to recognize What the Lord
[1:00:37] Has Done uh I just want to thank God for
[1:00:39] his
[1:00:40] faithfulness uh throughout the year uh I
[1:00:43] can honestly say God has sustained me
[1:00:46] and my family uh he has sustained us
[1:00:49] spiritually he has sustained us
[1:00:51] financially and physically and our
[1:00:54] pastor also brought out to uh light uh
[1:00:56] the scripture I read on the morning to
[1:00:58] make known his deed among men so I felt
[1:01:01] it was fitting for me to just share what
[1:01:03] God has done uh you know uh last year uh
[1:01:07] went through uh a pretty big uh trial
[1:01:10] after trial uh but I thank God for his
[1:01:13] peace and earlier uh in the year or the
[1:01:16] beginning of the year uh I was in a
[1:01:18] position where uh my mortgage uh needed
[1:01:22] to be uh paid in uh uh it was a matter
[1:01:25] of it was a pretty significant amount um
[1:01:28] and I was also just beginning a new role
[1:01:31] in my job uh well my new job actually uh
[1:01:34] but after prayer and and just trusting
[1:01:37] in the Lord uh we were caught in in a
[1:01:41] little uh situation with our mortgage
[1:01:43] insurance and they decided that they
[1:01:46] were going to give us what is called
[1:01:47] Force Place Insurance well to make it
[1:01:51] short uh for that whole year of last
[1:01:53] year um they would they were putting us
[1:01:56] on that Force Place insurance and we had
[1:01:59] an audit I spoke to my insurance agent
[1:02:01] and my agent gave me a document she told
[1:02:04] me to give give it to my mortgage
[1:02:06] company and so I did and after they did
[1:02:08] the audit they realized that all the
[1:02:11] money uh that they were paying on my
[1:02:14] behalf for the mortgage insurance uh and
[1:02:17] to point this out the mortgage insurance
[1:02:19] was uh about triple the amount that I
[1:02:21] was paying so it's very expensive and
[1:02:24] after the audit they realized all that
[1:02:26] money they were paying on my behalf they
[1:02:28] had to pay me back so uh they sent me a
[1:02:31] a pretty significant amount of check and
[1:02:34] that check was sufficient uh more than
[1:02:37] enough I would say uh to handle our
[1:02:39] needs uh for our mortgage so I want to
[1:02:41] thank God for that and just for his
[1:02:43] faith in us God bless
[1:02:50] you than you
[1:02:53] Jesus thank you
[1:02:55] God bless you church I just want to
[1:02:57] thank God for the opportunity to go home
[1:02:59] and visit my aunt and um either even
[1:03:02] though health is failing and she's uh in
[1:03:05] dementia she still
[1:03:07] recognizes and in a home which is the
[1:03:09] last result that anybody would want to
[1:03:11] put their mother but she's been well
[1:03:13] taken care of um also I thank God for
[1:03:16] the internet cuz y'all had Church up in

[1:03:32] from Montgomery all the way to S St
[1:03:35] Augustine and um there were cars left
[1:03:38] and right on the road accidents
[1:03:40] everywhere and we were in a the far left
[1:03:43] lane basically stopped in traffic and I
[1:03:47] looked to the side and there this big 16
[1:03:50] wheel truck right on the side of us so

[1:08:49] guarantee you you're going to fall any
[1:08:51] writer that hasn't fa is not a writer
[1:08:54] so she said that so we were at we went

[1:08:59] a competition that they have and
[1:09:01] yesterday she lost a little bit of
[1:09:04] control and fell off the horse and the
[1:09:06] horse like right in front of me stepped
[1:09:10] completely in her leg like full force

[1:09:15] bruise I've seen a horse break
[1:09:18] somebody's leg with just any any little
[1:09:20] move to the side and the horse came up
[1:09:23] and went down on her leg and she only

[1:09:29] grace praise the
[1:09:33] Lord amen thank God for protecting
[1:09:36] sister Abby Amen brother Garen God bless
[1:09:40] you Saints uh first off I just want to
[1:09:45] say thank you cuz I've been working back
[1:09:48] at ey glass World these last two days
[1:09:50] and the favor I've been receiving is
[1:09:54] overwhelming I mean I went it went
[1:09:58] everybody shocked that the whatever
[1:10:01] report they heard prior cuz they were
[1:10:03] like that's not you and now I've had
[1:10:06] multiple stores call me within the
[1:10:09] company th hey we want you to come help
[1:10:11] us so I thank God for his favor but
[1:10:14] there's also another part I started I
[1:10:17] chose to start on Tuesday because I had
[1:10:20] another interview on Monday for TSA
[1:10:25] so I did the interview for
[1:10:28] TSA and I was like I I have a friend of
[1:10:31] mine that works with IM immigration I
[1:10:33] was like hey I did the TSA they were
[1:10:34] like well did you get the email I said
[1:10:36] well I got the email saying thank you
[1:10:39] they were like no wait for another email
[1:10:40] I'm like okay now yesterday while I was
[1:10:43] at work I received an email stating that
[1:10:47] I've also been accepted to on board at
[1:10:50] TSA at Palm Beach International Airport
[1:10:59] and the the thing about that is I I I I
[1:11:02] called my friend and spoke to him and
[1:11:04] then they were like listen let me
[1:11:05] explain something to you usually the
[1:11:08] second email you get from TSA is only
[1:11:11] telling you Thank you for applying and
[1:11:13] usually most people have to wait at
[1:11:15] least three to four weeks before you get
[1:11:17] an offer so for you to get an offer and
[1:11:20] in Palm Beach county is a miracle in
[1:11:24] itself cuz they had told me when they
[1:11:26] originally applied and did TSA they had
[1:11:28] to work in Fort Lauderdale for 6 months
[1:11:30] before they could even get in Palm Beach
[1:11:32] County so the fact that I was able to
[1:11:35] interview on Monday and already get an
[1:11:37] offer on Tuesday telling me to report at
[1:11:40] Palm Beach International Airport they
[1:11:42] were like oh God has got you cuz that
[1:11:44] don't happen so I just want to thank God
[1:11:48] just for opening multiple doors for me I
[1:11:50] mean he already promised us blessing
[1:11:52] where we don't have room to re receive
[1:11:54] all right so I'm just grateful and
[1:11:55] thankful for it praise the
[1:12:00] Lord my God my God Amen anybody else um
[1:12:07] prayer requests or testimony all right
[1:12:11] well we thank God for all this this is a
[1:12:14] uh just it's always good to know what
[1:12:16] the Lord is doing in the midst of his
[1:12:18] people he always moving always doing
[1:12:20] something amen um I I did get one uh
