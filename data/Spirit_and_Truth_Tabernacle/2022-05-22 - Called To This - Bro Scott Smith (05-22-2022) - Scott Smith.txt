things i just need to make mention of we we i did get a call a couple of our saints are having symptoms with covet and man we we won't clean covet but they are battling with the symptoms and we are believing god for complete and total healing amen for them this world we live in a man is uh is plagued with all kinds of diseases and all that and we all have to fight it all the time but we know that we're covered in a promise that he was wounded for our transgressions as bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen so praise the lord that's what we claim and so just uh keep the saints in prayer and and i know oftentimes where they hear amen and you know oftentimes you can be sitting right here right now you can be sitting here right now and you could be carrying symptoms and not even realizing and uh so what i want you to understand that none of us walk in fear none of us should walk in fear uh you're everyone is welcome to do whatever is necessary for their their own safety and precautions amen but uh just uh we gotta we gotta keep walking by faith and not by sighting and trusting god to just give us strength day by day so amen but i just want to just make mention that let's just keep the saints in prayer amen that were impacted as you heard brother smiley is up in in ocala he preached i believe last night and me preaching this morning so uh just pray that god would just use him there in a special way amen and uh and i'm so grateful amen just to see uh a brother stanley and his family a man his precious

for me it means a lot that when saints go on vacation they always include church oh i ain't get no amens i know people say they take a vacation from church they get tired of church i'm tired of this you should never feel that way about the by going to worship the lord amen if you can include worshiping god remember god is the one that provides you with the finances so you can take your vacation amen he watches over your house while you're away from it come on somebody hey man don't you don't want a guard that go on vacation because you need them all the time right so we we gotta we gotta be willing to amen give him something even plan put god in your vacation you know a few years ago we were last year was we were on our way to tennessee and i said brother i i'm gonna come up your way and

so uh i like those that bring something amen some of that uh i believe this bride she brings something when she comes amen i believe we have something amen to amen to give of god and and so we come this morning just uh desiring god's uh will and uh so i'll just ask you and invite you to take your scriptures with us that'll be all the music sure sounded good i'll let you know a little secret every once in a while i'll pull your services up and and i may not get to catch all the preaching but i catch that singing and that worship and and so sitting in that setting back there this morning i said i i like it live i like it i i like being here so uh just a kindred spirit and so just sure good to be here we appreciate brother jack just opening the door and giving us the invite he was up last last summer and just blessed our church tremendously and just had a wonderful time he was back in the carolinas back during winter i guess either the end of the year of 2021 or the first part of 2022 and we tried to hook him in and pull him up our way and it just it didn't work but it was around new year's i believe it was and so uh anyway just um just had a wonderful time with him so let's turn this morning if we can to the book of first corinthians chapter one first corinthians chapter one [Music] let's just maybe look at verse starting at verse number 22 this morning first corinthians chapter 1 verse 22 also when we pray we've got a uh young girl back at our home church that's ten her name's amelia and she's had uh all this stuff going around and she's tested negative for covet and the flu and all those things but she's having a hard time with whatever it is if it's a virus or a bug or whatever and and her dad told me this morning she's having a hard time breathing with it and hasn't never had any problems like that so if we could this morning when we pray if you would just lift her up her name's amelia 10 years old and i'd like to see the lord just touch her today first corinthians chapter 1 and verse 22. let's just bow our heads as we speak to the lord father god lord it's so good to be lord gathered this morning in your presence lord to be gathered with saints of like faith and lord we just ask now that you just come and or just help us this morning lord we are needy people but lord we're so thankful that we've got a god that that knows the lord that knows all things lord that you're still a healer this morning and lord we've got a a little one in our church back home that needs a touch we're just asking you touch her this morning lord lift her up make her well we pray and father we pray for this service today lord as we've come and the lord has gathered in your name and gathered with your people we just asked now that you just take everything lord everything that i would say let it be lord totally under the umbrella of your holy ghost and your spirit lord we pray minister to us lord for we need you we ask it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen first corinthians chapter one and verse 22 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god in the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men verse 26 and i want to look at these next couple of verses closely for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many noble are called right but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea in things which are not to bring to naught things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption it looks like he's just covered us all he's covered us with everything we everything we need amen i'm an insurance a i'm a pastor but i'm also an insurance agent one of the hardest things about my job is telling somebody they're not covered when something happens but i'm thankful we've got a god a word amen that whatever it is today it's covered amen that he would cover us with his wisdom and righteousness sanctification and redemption that according that is as it is written he that glorieth led him glory in the lord amen amen you can be seated i want to speak to you this morning out of that 26th verse and amen i want to speak to you on called to this all right all right called right to this [Music] can you say amen amen we realized this morning that amen there is a a call uh on our life amen uh it is it is as paul would call it it is a high calling amen so this is a heavenly calling that has been placed on our lives uh today amen that excuse me he would call it a high call and it is in another place in hebrews chapter three he would call it a heavenly calling amen and so we we realized that that both of those uh the high and the heavenly speaks of uh of an upward calling we are uh this is not a call of man uh in this hour as as we see how uh the bible would tell us how the jews would you know require a sign the greeks would seek after wisdom and you know when you you look at that i've said before i've heard it said that you know the romans you give them the gospel and they make a government out of it uh the greeks you give them the gospel and they make a philosophy out of it uh the europeans you give them the gospel and they make a culture out of it amen but if you give the word to the bride of jesus christ oh my and you get the word to them that are called amen it will perform what it is to perform it's it it's in the right hands can you say man and so amen so we we realized this morning that uh this is not our own choose and this is this is more than our own choose and this this is a call this is a this is a call of god on our lives it's more than uh it's more than just a uh something that we've been brought up in it's more than something that someone has shared with us but there is a divine call on our lives amen this call is not just the preachers a matter of fact this bride calling that i'm talking about this morning it even supersedes that amen this is a call to the bride of jesus christ where every man woman boy and girl amen that is called by god amen shares in that same calling oh it is a most high calling that i'm speaking of today amen you've got a call on your life oh hallelujah amen paul would tell us in 2 thessalonians 1 that god would count us worthy of this calling amen so this calling is it is of god amen that and we would be counted worthy of this call and in second timothy chapter one and verse nine the bible says who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began so he has he has saved us and he has called us he has he has put a call on our life amen we are i just preached a series back home on on uh the uh the approved of god amen and how that this bride is acceptable to god amen we are the approved of the lord amen look at turn with me to ephesians chapter one one verse here ephesians chapter one and verse six or let's let's just read uh let's just read back up and and read verse three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved amen we have been made accepted in the beloved now now think about that when you look at that and and that verb just accepted in the beloved that word accepted here used in this manner is is is only used one other place in the scripture amen and it's it's it's the scripture in luke now notice what he's saying here we have been made accepted which it actually means we are highly favored when you look at this in the greek it's actually we are highly favored of the lord amen this is only used one other time in in the in the holy scripture and it's where the angel came unto mary amen luke 1 28 the angel came into her and said hell thou art highly favored as the lord amen the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women amen so here he would tell mary amen that that carrier of that of that word in its in its infant state amen he would he would tell he would look and declare you are highly favored of the lord amen and now paul would speak amen to a bride amen over here in in the book of ephesians and again tell us that we have been made accepted amen or acceptable or highly favored of god amen oh my amen god has made this bride amen he has approved this bride amen he has made us acceptable we we are truly highly favored we are highly favored of god oh my what a what a uh uh what a what a statement paul amen how he would use this and declare amen that notice we are accepted in the beloved oh my so we we we're called this morning we amen we we are acceptable in god amen we are acceptable in in the beloved now i i like that that word beloved here because it's a word we see that that god amen would declare jesus in matthew 3 a voice from heaven amen saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased amen now think about that this is after jesus is baptized this is before any any of these works this is before any of these miracles this is where before he's ever done anything amen to to uh to gain something if we could say it that way amen but god would declare over him this is my beloved son amen listen listen brad it's not based on our works amen it's not brea it's not based on all the good that we can done amen but we are loved in the beloved we are called in the beloved oh hallelujah amen not in anything i could ever boast on but the goodness of god amen that's put us in the beloved and hold us in this hour oh what a mighty calling that's on our life oh what a calling that's in your life this morning oh it's a call from the heavenly amen the voice of my beloved oh i believe he's calling still today oh i pray that before we amen if you're here and you're questioning that call amen today i hope before we leave here amen you will be able to come face to face with the call of god in your life we've been called what a what a privilege john would tell us in in first john chapter 3 verse 1 he would tell us what manner he would say behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not watch this verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of god now you think what's what what what's all the the talk about here john that you know how we're a son of god but when you think of that term when you think of that title and you think of how you know you know god god doesn't uh uh just uh he's very careful when he places titles can you say amen he's very god's not loose with his titles amen if god declares something as the son of god that's a son of god if god declare is that right god's not loose with those titles you think i mean you think like this you think how god who is the father who would want to pass that on down no doubt amen but think about this here here before he would ever share that title now here is adam you think the very first man the very first man to live you would think if god's ever going to share that title amen with with with a a with a with a who with a son of god or with a man it would be adam he's the fir we know eve was the mother of all living right but here is adam who god never would declare you are the father of many nations now he's oh come on think about this amen but he would declare abraham he would want to share that title he would want to give that title amen and he would pick it up over here abraham amen and call abraham and say now you are not you're not just abraham you are father abraham he could never put that on adam because of the fall amen because of what would take place and i'm talking i'm talking about that that that real name i know he was a father you understand what amen but before he would give that title brother jose amen he would wait and come over here and he would not call adam the father amen the father of our faith but he would call abraham the father of our faith and when you think of the sons of god now you find them over in genesis you find amen you find the bible speaking of of the sons of god and how they saw the daughters of men and amen and so forth over in genesis 6 and and and how god would acknowledge acknowledge them as the sons of god you find that job which is the oldest book in the bible it would speak of the sons of god presenting themselves coming and presenting themselves before the lord but you find after the fall you find that title if you've ever noticed this you find amen that name sons of god you don't you don't hear that anymore search the scripture i mean you don't see that being used throughout the old testament amen where people are actually being called the sons of god are you with me amen you don't you don't find that amen you you find amen you you find it there in genesis but then after that fall amen now we know god again he doesn't he doesn't just throw that that that language or that title out there amen we know that god calls adam luke luke three when he's given a genealogy calls adams the son of god we know mark calls jesus mark 1 1 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god so he's called adam the son of god here he's called jesus christ the son of god amen but now amen there's a bright body amen that john is declaring now think about that what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we can now be called sons of god again there was silence there was a gap for years to where men would not be acknowledged as sons of god but now john declares now behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we would be called the sons of god oh hallelujah oh my i mean amen and so call us amen i believe john when he's in first john three and two amen beloved now one of the little kids yesterday that was right oh now are we finally at disney have we finally made it amen now john's declaring beloved now oh we finally made it amen we're back to the place that we can be called the sons of god with all the power and authority that comes with that name oh all the package that comes with that name all glory i tell you what oh i'm telling you we are called sons of god oh what an honor oh what a high calling i mean what a calling on your life that you are called as a son and daughter of god [Music] all but as many as received him john 1 and 12 minutes received him to them gave you power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name amen which we which were born not a blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of god amen these sons were begotten of god come on didn't come by flesh are you with me didn't come by the will of man amen but we are called amen we were we we were begotten of god amen now are we called are you with me amen we are the sons of god amen what a what a what an honor what a what a what a oh my what a what a title amen that that that he would place on us as as children of god oh i tell you there's a calling on our life all this is see this is more than just a just a scholarly understanding or a scholarly message that we have amen this is a revelation amen god amen this is a revelation of god amen god has so called us it's it's more than just a it's more than just learning our way to it amen we've been called to it hey man it's it's if somebody learned their way to it they might learn their way out of it amen but if you've ever been called to it oh come on amen if you've ever been called to there's a calling on your life amen i was looking over a malachi i mean you think of the gap between malachi and which is the last book of the old testament and matthew the first book of the new testament you you see you there were over 400 years 400 years of of silence between the old testament and the new testament closing out in malachi amen and indeed and then of course the introduction of of jesus christ of the new testament matthew 1 for over 400 years now you can think think with me just a minute because here here are are the believers we would call them of that time back in the days of the old testament and the last book that they are given the last prophetic utterance that would be penned would be the book of malachi now think about this because here the very last thing that they get amen is really the first thing they're going to need when they get over in matthew amen because who's coming elijah's coming amen and so the last thing amen that they're told in the book of malachi is what to be expecting in other words this is what we need to be teaching on the sabbath this is what we need to be keeping before the people amen can you imagine every sabbath them gathering the very last thing they have the very last bit of prophetic insight and instruction that they have is elijah is coming amen that for that one to come john the baptist in this case and that's the last thing that they are given can you can you imagine how fresh that probably was in one sense as they would gather the last thing we've got is to be looking amen there is an elijah the prophet coming before the lord comes right before the first coming of christ amen and so this is this is what this is what they have this is the material they have before no other prophetic utterance amen everything's quiet amen but watch this and you know that that was that we could say that would be a hot subject a hot topic in in the in the sabbath very often very regular this is the last thing amen brother jack the last thing they've been given amen the last thing amen so you know that this is this is fresh on their mind yet watch this amen when it actually come to pass and matthew opened up and john stormed on the scene elijah stormed on the scene all of those that sat there amen that were they should have been expecting it had heard it over and over and over 99 of them did not even recognize that it was in their midst [Applause] but there were some that were called to it now think of amen there were some that were called to an axe i think acts speaks of this well acts chapter 13 verse 26 and 27 men and brethren children children of the stock of abraham whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent verse 27 watch this [Music] for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him now here they are they're hearing the vote they're hearing they're hearing these prophets every sabbath day yet they never hear the voice they never hear the voices of those prophets and therefore when the things begin to take place amen they sit there with no reluction amen come on amen with no no real insight or no real recognition of what has taken place amen but there's another group of people amen that are absolutely called to the truth they are called to the word i i told the church i said it this way i said now they had 400 years 400 years between amen between malachi and matthew amen to look at it to ponder it i said and the majority of them could never believe it i said but here we are amen some 2500 years later after malachi amen and because there's a call on our life amen oh help me somebody amen because there's a call on our life amen when we hear that elijah must first come there's something in us amen that's brought us and called us to the truth [Applause] what does that only god can do that that it would be blind that the the rest of the world would be blind to it but there would be something that would that would so attract you to the word do you know what it is there's a calling on your life amen you can't get away from it there is a calling on your life amen god has called you to the word amen you are called for this word you didn't just stumble into this thing and then the message is not something you just come across it's something you've been called to [Applause] god has called you to the truth he's placed a holy calling it is a high calling as paul would call it it is it is an upwards it is listen it's the only calling i want because it is an ascending calling amen it is constantly lifting us up higher amen we are constantly moving on up in the things of the word we are constantly being brought together and caught up in heavenly places amen if you ever notice that before the bride was ever told she's been placed in heavenly places christ is first placed in heavenly places and then the bride is followed up and said in the same heavenly places amen we have been called to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus [Applause] it is an ascending it is an ascending walk amen this is not a backing up time there is a high calling it's constantly his email came in the tithe amen brother branham said to enoch amen that tie for that bride amen that just that constant moving on up constant coming on up a little higher i tell you when we gather amen like this amen every every service there's just a little coming up just a little higher amen moving on up just a little more just why because there's a high calling on our life and it's calling us out of here john would type that bride come up hither amen come on up amen i i've i i've got some things to show you amen john come on come on up glory he's bringing us up there's a high calling it is an ascending life amen god just continues to amen to to bring us up to bring us to that place amen to amen just taking us higher taking us higher amen moving us closer amen sharing more and more can you say amen open and open his amen opening his word to our life oh we are the final voice to the final age can somebody give me a come on we are we we are the final voice to the final this this bright body does have something to be about come on amen listen we are that final voice amen we are the last part amen of that anointing amen that is to come and to hit the body come on amen david spoke about this over and over in psalms and and with the anointing of aaron and he would talk about he would say it this way in psalms 133 he said behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity you know how important that is all that's important watch how important it is what's the comparison he gives in verse two you you talking about that unity you talking about it bringing forth a real power in our lives watch verse 2 it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments now notice that that that comparison i like this amen when you follow amen the order of the anointing here amen it started at the head but it didn't stay at the head somebody helped me i said it started at the head amen but a real anointing doesn't stay at the head amen this bright oh my amen it started at the head but it worked its way on down [Applause] it worked its way on down to the beard or even to the mouth of the prophet come on come on i believe i believe aaron was the mouthpiece is that what he said amen he said he is the man let's just read it he said he said that that if exodus 4 amen uh that uh exodus 4 that that he would aaron was the spokesman or called the mouth of moses brother branham an unveiling of god said it this way he said why he told even told moses himself you'll be god and aaron will be your prophet right now think about this because and and don't forget the unity part because it's being typed here amen and it and and it would say amen that that ointment how it would how it would come down upon the head it ran down upon the beard i mean it covered the mouth amen the prophet amen so the anointing started at the head it come down and to the mouth of the prophet but like some would want to stop it right there see you you got you got three kinds of believers in this thing what one type want to stop it at the head oh just just just the lord it's just the lord i don't want to hear no more amen but that anointing goes further than that amen it drops down to a prophet's anointing amen through the mouth of a prophet now there's another group that would want to leave it right there there's another group that would say well you don't got to go no further we don't need to hear anybody we don't need to hear preachers we don't need to oh no that's contrary to the anointing this anointing that i'm talking about did not stop with the head it did not stop with the mouth oh but it flowed all the way down covering the skirts of the garment in other words it hit the body the anointing covered the body it completely covered the body or if i can even if i can even type it like this that skirt's a feminine garment it hit the bride of jesus christ it hit the bright body oh glory oh my this anointing amen that you have received has not come from man [Applause] [Music] amen this anointing started at the head come on somebody it started at the head and it worked its way down all through the mouth of a prophet all but it didn't stop there oh i like it even aaron's beard and then i like this that colon comes in and that went down to the skirts of his garments so follow that hitting the body come on it's hitting the body amen watching the message why amen brother branham will talk about the dove brother i'm going to talk about the dove you've seen the dove soap and the dove oils and all of that there's a reason for that you know that dove brother brown was talking about the dove and he said he said anytime anytime he works his body that dove works his body it produces an oil come on oh i'm thinking about the body when that body really comes together amen every part working and performing nothing to be there to be no schism in the body right but each joint supplying oh compacted together listen listen body you're needed in this ministry that we are preaching you are needed in this [Applause] it's not just the preachers we need we've got a bright body that we need you've got a part to play in this [Music] you've got a part to bring that oil [Applause] you matter of fact in the old testament back in eli's day if you remember eli gets all the flack for uh allowing that oil to go out the lamp to go out remember and and and that oil was driven by that lamp was driven by the oil the oil of olive that would keep that burning amen and remember whose responsibility it was to bring that all into the house of god it wasn't eli's eli was there and once it come he had his responsibility but the responsibility was on the general people to go and bring fresh pure beaten oil olive to the temple to be burned you say what are you what are you expecting of me brother scott i'm expecting you amen or more than me god is expecting you to bring the oil when you come to the house of god god is expecting oil all of out of your life that'll keep this schoolhouse burning oh that'll keep this house of god aflame [Applause] [Music] he said brother man said when that dove works he says his body produces it if he just sits still and he's never active and he never makes midweek service [Music] not as much activity going on right now talk about it come on so less oil now we're not putting it in works you understand what i'm saying amen but see your life is is what produces that you produce that come on oh come on i'm talking about an anointing don't stop that doesn't stop it it's your pastor i'm talking about an anointing that flows to the body oh there's gifts in this body oh there's colons in this body even god has so ordained it that way that a body would function it's not about a big preacher it's about a big body it's about a body that's unified it's about a body that is collectively come together [Music] it's about not making somebody popular it's about a body oh it's hit the body are you with me oh i'm telling you amen thank god for the call on your life not many wives not many noble amen are called to see this amen but you oh you're highly favored of the lord i was looking i was thinking studying a while back and looking at at the day of pentecost and studying in acts and and i come across something i just i went back to it had on my mind just one day the entire whole day brother jack you know how that can be sometimes something something striking and you you just you know then it just grabs your attention and so i couldn't get off of it and i just started looking at it and and over in you know when you when you think of pentecost and and we know according to scripture there was about 120 that gathered in that upper room and so you look at that and you think uh what a what a time that was but you know paul he makes a statement over in first corinthians i just i just want to read that if i can first corinthians 15. he tells us we you turn there i can tell you the the the yeah 15-6 and it's talking about after the resurrection after jesus was resurrected we realized that from his time of resurrection to the to pentecost was 50 days and so he resurrected he walked the earth for uh and was seen for about 40 days right and so then 10 days after that of course pentecost 50. and so when you think of that time and you think of of what took place well in first corinthians paul he would cover this none of that none of the other gospels are are this clear on a number but paul is and in first corinthians 15 he would tell us that after he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve and verse six after that he was seen of above 500. at once notice that amen he's seen of he's seen of them and then he's seen of of above 500 of once paul would tell us of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are falling asleep so here here paul he would tell us a number that had witnessed now this was no like thing this was the resurrection of our lord there were many people that this was hidden from all the way around amen he didn't show himself to everybody is that right amen when he walked the earth those 40 days he appeared to he appeared to some he didn't appear at all right amen paul's actually putting a number on it here and tells us well he appeared at a 500 at once are you following me so here he is he this is no like thing if you've been called if you've been you know if you've at least you know heard this i mean you're one of the you're one of the a few are you with me 500 that that had had witnessed this but but i got i got to look at this and and i thought maybe it's elementary to some but i thought now where was that other 380 all right in the upper room right because we got 120 there we've got 500 remember 500 that have witnessed this now jesus in luke 24 he would he would is where he would tell the he would tell the disciples remember to go terry in jerusalem now they're not gonna have to tarry long pentecost is coming he's risen 40 days he's walked he tells them go amen just go terry it's going you know they may have not known how long it was going to be but in reality it wasn't that long even the whole time from his his resurrection to pentecost 50 days right now here he is they have witnessed 500 have witnessed this and been told if you read if you read luke's account over in luke 24 he doesn't put a number on it but luke 24 and 33 i believe it would it would say it it would tell it the story or i know it does how how when when he was talking to him there amen it was it was the 11 and those those that were with them yeah luke luke so it doesn't put a number on it look luke 11. just stay with me just a few minutes here i'm sorry luke 24 luke 24 33 and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them so we don't know how many was with them but we know there's a number of them right all of them 11 no doubt had probably gained gain their own little their little groups and followings and so there's a number here present amen paul would tell us it it can't it it it blows the mind of many of the different writers and and and and commentaries and different ones because they're like you know the gospels didn't put that 500 number on them but paul a prophet would declare to us amen that over 500 saw him now we could we could take that here's the 11 and all them that were with them now jesus would in verse 49 would give the message amen behold i send the promise of the father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen so we then we find amen that it's in the upper room that we've got a number of only 120 and so you say where i don't know this is the way i think but where is that other 380. now when you think about it because this was a most religious time in israel at that time it was the feast of weeks which is you know of course pentecost now so people people had gathered those jews had gathered from all over had come amen to to the the area amen to celebrate this they had there was all kind it was a time of rededication rededicating their life there was services going on amen but listen i think about this there was a lot going on amen but there was one place that god was really meeting there was a lot of religious ceremonies gathering in the name of the lord but there was a called group up in the upper room amen that god truly came to amen so here he is amen now you say where's those other ones listen there was a there was a there was a lot going on amen there was a lot of festivities going on there was a lot of there there us we could say services there was a lot of people no doubt that gets caught up in the religious thing even just going through the motions and couldn't hold on just those few more days and obey what he said amen just go i'm going to meet you there amen but there was a call group amen that was called genuinely the calling of god on their life and regardless of what everybody else did i'm sure on the way somebody said man we're having a wonderful meeting over here stop by over here they're really going to lay the feast of the weeks out over here stop over no they had a call on their life oh come on or we hear it today and then come to this camp or go to that camp or amen or leave the camp or or or amen but there is a call on our life amen we're going all the way not to an upper room amen we're going to an upper place in christ we're walking in higher places we've got a rapture on our mind we've got going home on our mind [Music] and up the 380 don't go on with us we're going on you know why because god has placed a calling on your life god has called you you are called to this you are not called to go another way you're called to go this way can i say it this way and i was driving as on my way up here had had yesterday and just pondering the service had had a stack of notes and i left back at the back of the room because as i was driving coming here amen the lord spoke to my heart and said tell them they are called to this i tell you what you know what the the hard pressure of preaching is lifted when that come to me because i knew that was what the lord would have said the whole oh brother jack [Music] called to this i say it like jesus said it as the pharisees tried to stumble him on with john and they began to ask him you know questions and jesus said well i'll ask you a question he said the baptism of john was it from men or was it from heaven can you say amen and he would ask that question and of course they couldn't answer it they you know because they they're where a lot of people are they knew you know they looked and they said well if we if we say it's of heaven then he's gonna he's gonna ask us why we're not following it there's going to be some accountability if we admit that it's the lord hello there's a sense of responsibility then there's a sense of accountability but but if we if we say it's of man well there's people that esteem john a prophet and we'll be stoned and so they stayed right in the middle they stayed they really wasn't neutral but they stayed neutral come on they stayed right there in the middle but i say amen listen to us amen that have recognized and this is a heavenly calling this is not from man amen man didn't call me come on man can't hold me amen this is the most heavenly calling this is from heaven amen why not put our shoulder completely behind it why don't we really just get behind this thing amen and take it to the finish line take this thing to the finish line [Applause] we're called to take it i don't know about the rest of them but i believe i can sense right here we got a whole bunch of say i'm going on with him i feel a kindred spirit of a group this morning that's saying we're just going to take this thing and we're just going to keep pressing right on amen don't come too far [Music] to look back now we're called you're called to this could we stand to our feet [Music] musicians if you'd come

time oh i just can't give up now whoa where i started from nobody told me it's brought me this far to leave me [Music] [Applause] um one thing i can say this morning is that we heard from god we heard [Music] [Applause] from god um brother brother scott like i told you just drove in i want to say maybe um he drove in yesterday and it was just uh maybe a month ago that he told me that he was going to be coming here to florida and when he when he when he said he was coming i said uh because last time he preached for us on a wednesday night and when he came the last time and just did a wonderful job but i said brother you you're gonna be nearby are you gonna be here on a sunday this time and i say i can probably come on the 22nd i say well brother let's pencil it in and let's have you come on the 22nd and and when god orchestrated for brother scott to be here on the 22nd god also knew who else was going to be here on the 22nd and before i mean sometimes we think things just happen by accident or by chance but when you talk about god nothing happens by chance nothing happens by accident nah you talking about god [Music] and i'm just sitting here listening to the brother and you know just so many details and and you know as a as a pastor amen i can hear the things that god is speaking and my prayers are always lord don't let them miss it lord don't let them miss it lord let them catch that lord let them catch that because this is coming direct from god this is a tremendous calling that's upon your life as the brother was just kind of sharing when you when you're dealing with a calling from god just as a minister i can tell you from my own personal experience when you deal with a call from god god don't deal with everybody god don't speak to everybody so when god speaks to you when god is calling you then he wants you to respond sometimes we're waiting on everybody else to respond but god ain't talking to them god is actually talking to you and when it comes down in love and speaks to you you have to respond [Music] i hope we'll hear the voice of the lord i'm called to this amen i'm called to this this is this is this is this i'm calling to this message i'm calling to this word i'm called to this church i'm called i'm called i'm calling them god i'm called to this i tell you the truth brother scott god bless you thank you so much for getting yourself out of the way and just allowing the lord to to use you to speak to us [Music] i'm blessed i'm leaving here in courage i'm leaving here the word of god i'm leaving here changed amen amen amen amen let's have a word of prayer father your word has been spoken your servant has yielded god and allowed you to utter words from heaven god you you've expressed your love to each and every one of us telling us lord how you have called us and maybe we didn't understand why we were under some of the things we were under the pressures and things that we were feeling all that is a part of the calling all that's a part of the process lord how we just must remain faithful not just thinking back in the sermon how he shared 400 years of silence 400 years of nothing but the only thing that people had is the last utterance of a prophet in the book of malachi that they would hold to that utterance and say elijah's coming elijah's coming elijah's coming and when john the baptist shows up many did not recognize who he was even the disciples didn't catch it until jesus revealed it to him that oh if you could receive it it was it's the scriptures was written and the things was already fulfilled if you can receive it it's already happening then they understood it was john the baptist [Music] god i pray that you'd help us to catch what you're saying and what you're doing in this hour for here we are at the end time again and another elijah's coming elijah's coming actually elijah's coming already gone just what jesus spoke to the disciples he's coming already gone help us to catch it lord this is not a joke we've been called to something special how many churches have gathered today just as it was in that time lord where amen uh lord during the time of pentecost and lord just so many things happening father how many churches were gathered how many people having services but but failing to realize what was really going on lord we want to be spiritual this hour we want to catch and we want to hear what the voice of god is speaking and we want to respond father [Music] sometimes it's not easy but lord it's certainly worth it and got my prayers that amen you would just help us father to hear your voice even as we leave and as we're fellowshipping around the word of god things that we heard here today may your presence just come around us again lord oh to cement the things that we heard today bless your servant and his precious wife and his family lord and the other saints that are with the lord here uh just for a little vacation a little rest i pray that you have blessed him following your time amen here in florida give them wonderful weather oh god that they'd be able to enjoy themselves oh jesus thank you for the sacrifice that he made to come he gonna say no i'm not driving those three hours but lord he came father and i believe you had him come with a purpose hey there was a calling father on this and we thank you for lord i pray your blessings but all your people as they leave this place but not your presence watch over those that are among us lord that the enemy has attacked in their body lord we actually bring healing to each and every one we don't receive one symptom we condemn it and send it back to the pits of hell from whence it came hallelujah take our place and authority as sons of god a title that has been restored and we live in that we walk in that we exercising that now are we the sons of god god you don't look at our mistakes our failures or any of that you gave us the title anyway because you had confidence in us oh god
