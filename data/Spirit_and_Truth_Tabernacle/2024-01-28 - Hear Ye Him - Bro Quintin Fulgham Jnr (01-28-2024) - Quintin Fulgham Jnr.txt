TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Lord once again amen uh tonight uh we will uh be having brother Quenton speaking for us and uh so we'll just do things a little different I want to read a scripture uh just to open the Service uh from uh Romans chapter 8 amen Romans chapter 8 praise the Lord Romans 8 and I want to start at Verse 18 amen of Romans 8 uh it just says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from uh the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that uh the whole creation grown up and and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but uh ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth what doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it uh likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit maketh intercession uh for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and uh this last verse and we know that all things uh work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen thank the Lord for his word let's just have a brief word of prayer father we thank you for being able to gather here tonight thank you for giving us traveling mercies and allow us to come back into the house of God given us a

let's clap our hands and receive him praise the Lord amen amen amen amen did he did he leave all right amen amen amen so we are going to get right into the word um and we're going we're going to do our scripture reading tonight from Matthew uh chapter 17 and we're going to be reading verses uh 1-5 so say Amen once you get there and it reads and after six days Jesus Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was as white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him and then Peter said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen you may be uh

oh Lord God to work like you did oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you brought us to this building on a Wednesday night where other people in the world oh Lord are doing different things with the carnal mind oh Lord God but Lord you prepared us oh Lord God before the foundation of the world to be in this setting oh Lord for us to give our time to you oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord you want to restore us back oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord you don't just want to heal us oh Lord God and so that we could be healthy and just keep living life on oh Lord God or just have good finances oh Lord God but Lord you're trying to restore back that relationship that we had with you oh Lord before the foundation of the world oh Lord God Lord help us oh Lord God to awaken our spiritual eyes and ears Lord to understand Lord Jesus Christ that your love oh Lord is greater than finances it's greater than health oh Lord God it's greater than blessings oh Lord God to be able to say I'm a Child of God I'm a I'm a Son of God and walk right up to the presence of God knowing full well Lord Jesus Christ that love engulfs us oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord you built a tabernacle once oh Lord and and certain people couldn't come to it oh Lord Jesus Christ but that wasn't the end goal for you oh Lord God Lord you wanted all of us to have access to you oh Lord God Lord God there's a lot of needs here tonight that on people's hearts oh Lord God Lord I'm just a man I'm just a vessel Lord God I feel as least oh Lord God amongst any I don't have a gift of dis serment or anything like that Lord Jesus but you're still the great Jehovah oh Lord God lord there are a lot of here that have been hanging on on to to a word you gave them for years for months for weeks oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord they're here oh Lord God just to show lord they're faithful to you and that they still believe you oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord answer our prayers oh Lord God according to your riches and to your will oh Lord in the Blessed name of Jesus Christ amen amen so the title of the message that um the lord gave me tonight was hear ye him uh and this is actually a message that the prophet had preached before um and so restoration is the focal point of the Bible and that's something that you have to realize as a Believer is that whatever you get from God was already given to you right you're not trying to come and receive something that is uh outside of that like so if you've if you've lost the leg God's not going to give you uh three arms right and know and I've seen videos of of people that have lost their eyesight and science have scientists have said that you know another sense would en so that they would have enhanced uh hearing but that's not what we're looking for we want our sight back all right all right we want our blessings back we want our love back we want our peace back we want our our our longsuffering back we want our finances back everything that God gave to us we want it back right and the Beautiful Thing of having something that God gave to you you know that there's no ill will in it and then it comes with peace it comes with love so we're looking for God to restor us back these things right so the Bible um the prophet said uh the word here actually doesn't mean just to listen right here means to receive something right so receiving is an important point along the path of restoration when you want to get something back right amen right the prophet uh uh told us that right in order to receive something we first must know what are we receiving and from whom are we receiving you have to ask these questions because uh um you have to understand what what God has allotted to you right and then the voice that comes behind it because a lot of people a lot of times people receive things right that aren't theirs now it's not that it's uh the thing is a wrong thing because a lot of times a perfect example would be king Ahab he went in a Vineyard and there's nothing wrong with the vineyard that Vineyard just didn't belong to him right that Vineyard didn't belong to him so God couldn't be behind some something like that right so the voice that was telling him to get that Vineyard did not come from God so we always got to be careful about what we're asking to be received and uh recognizing the voice behind it and you'll see that's a focal point in the Bible right because it's the voice that gives us the confidence in order to go and get it amen amen so we're going to uh start our journey in first Samuel 17 we're probably going to be doing a lot of scripture reading today but you know there there's nothing wrong with reading about amen all right so we're going to start from 1st Samuel 17: 1-3 and I can start reading it it says now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shoka which belongeth to Judah and pitched between shoka and Aika and esid Damon and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of ela and set the battle in Array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley in between them right so I I like this cuz we cuz this year our theme is restoration and this is a beautiful example of the children of Israel having lost uh uh this land that God had given them you could say that the Philistines were squatting on their land and uh now uh Israel has pitched up T because now they want to go and get it back as brother Jack cat said when you want to get your restoration you have to go on the offense you can't go on the defense you can't stand around and sit around and expect the uh the blessing to come back to you you have to come up with a battle strategy to say all right we're going over to take what is ours amen and I love how the scriptures um this land that was taken from them I love how the scripture says that it belonged to Judah right because Judah is an important tribe to know the Bible and as as I've been going and reading through my uh um I I do a Bible study every single morning and I was going through and I was reading about Judah and uh his name and with this tribe and the the importance of it right because out of Judah comes a great restoration right brother amen out of Judah comes a great restoration and so they had lost this land that had very important significance to the Christian race as a whole right right so there's this website that I um that I found online that uh gave some facts about Judah that I want to kind of go through just to show the importance of of of this tribe yes sir so one of the facts facts says it was prophesied the Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah right right the Messiah which we know is Christ the promise right and also says when Israel entered the promised land Judah receive extensive lands as recorded in the Book of Joshua so God loved this particular particular tribe and had to give him some blessings right and it also says here that um David was from the tribe of Judah right David has important meaning as we're going and reading this uh uh Bible verse with David in it and it says after David and Solomon's death Judah was the only tribe that remained loyal to the memory and the ways of David now both of the kingdoms they're talking about which was Israel and Judah they both had issues but Judah tend to stay with the word all right Judah tend to stay with the word right and that's very very important there was actually a time when the prophet had came down and had told the king of Israel he said I wouldn't even be sitting here if Judah wasn't here because Judah was faithful to the word right and when you're faithful to the word God has to keep his eyes on you and we'll see that see that being typed as we keep going keep going through right so another fact says just as the line of Judah was continued through children Judah had uh also children he it says here that he would U marry someone outside their culture that also included uh Boaz who married rof and that's important because uh uh the Christ of this day also has a gentile bride right right so we have so it's important that we uh uh find ourselves uh uh in this because we are also a part of the tribe the tribe of Judah through marriage of Christ amen right says the tribe of Judah over time came to be represented through a lion um and a beautiful beautiful fact here which was the last one say say Jesus fulfills the prophecy and blessings given to Judah at its Inception even in Revelation Jesus is referred to as the one who fulfilled those prophecies Prophet promises and it says here we know Revelation 55 and one of the elders said to me weep no more behold the line of the troo of Judah the root of David has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its Seven Seals and I want I want you I want you to know right now those Seven Seals in the opening of the book is important to Restoration praise God the opening of the seals and the and the opening of the book is very very very important if you're wanting a restoration right right and and there was only one person that could do it now John was the one that had the vision and even though John was God's agent of love he still wasn't worthy enough to open the book that's right we love God but it's going to take more than that in order for us to get our Restorations back it's going to take more than our love for God it's going to take him to do it himself because he is the one who is worthy amen amen we couldn't redeem oursel Adam couldn't redeem himself we needed someone to come and restore us back Glory all right so we're going to we're going to keep uh uh continuing on with this thought of uh the children of Israel right now that we kind of explained and show the significance of Judah being a uh being a representation of Christ right so they had lost this land this important land that had an important uh uh place in the Bible right and uh and and and we're trying this the ultimate goal that we're trying to get back to because when you want to have blessings when you want to have your finances increased when you want to have healing in your body when you want to have God turn around your situation it's important to first have your s restored right and you get that by restoring your communion with the tree of life or Jesus Christ or what we know as the baptism of the holy spirit so before you pray for your blessings before you pray for your healing say Lord Give Me Back My Joy Glory give me back my love give me back my peace because if you were to go through a trial where you were sick and you're asking God to heal you and you don't have joy you won't make it through you won't trust in God until the end of the process no you need that joy in order for the the finances to come for a church building to come you need the longsuffering right you can't or or else you'd crack you'd give up on God so you need to have these things restored to you first right so we're looking to get back our our restoration to this tree of life that we lost to in the beginning right so and that's why we have a problem with this scene where we have Israel has pitched up their tents and now they're looking to go to battle towards uh the Philistines we have a problem because their attitude towards it now shows uh uh something that's a little bit off right so in 1st Samuel 17 uh uh chapter 17: 10- 11 I'll go through and read that 10 through 11 it says and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day while he's on their land he says give me a man that we may fight together the Bible said when Saul and all is Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid dismayed and greatly afraid someone standing on something that was theirs and boasting and they're fearing they didn't give the land to themselves God gave it to them but yet they're still afraid to go and get it something doesn't line up here right so not only did they need a restoration to this land they needed a restoration to their own selves to remember who they were right but we thank God right because he always sends a message before a restoration right and that's the title of the message hear ye him you got to receive something first before you get the strength to go and fight right so so it and it's not God doesn't just send a message or words like a lot of theologians they'll give smart words and talks and uh uh beautiful speeches and stuff but we need a manifestation behind that word in order to revive the fire in our hearts for us to go and get back our restoration or else you'd be afraid to do it right so now before we get to the um the next Bible verses uh and we continue on with that message of where the message is coming through like I said before it's important to realize the source of where the message comes and how it's selected it's very very important to remember that because there's a lot of messages out there there's a lot of words out there there's a lot of people out there there's a lot of great men out there but we want something that's going to give us confidence we want something where we don't have to uh uh uh be second guessing uh will it work will it not work there's a lot of treatments in the medical world today and and and you go online and it's well it might work well it it may work under this uh circumstance it may not work on this circumstance it worked for this person it didn't work for that person so it's just they're giving them a cure a cure but they're still giving them questions about it right and God doesn't like to see his children in a situation where they're constantly wondering question am I on or am I off right so this is what this message does it comes to settle you right amen now we all know that the messenger for that for that time and that situation was David right so let's kind of backtrack and and see how he got to this position and how he was selected in order to deliver this to to deliver this message now before David Saul was Israel's first king yes he was Israel's first king and it's important to know that he was chosen by the people right he was chosen by the people and when and you'll read further on when he had his talk with Samuel during that time uh the prophet Samuel told Saul God Gave You authority over all the tribes of Israel including Judah so Saul was in a position where God was God had some confidence in him even though he wasn't God's choice the people wanted uh Saul to be king So Saul so God said okay Saul's your king God anointed him God gave him the authority over the tribes but when Saul disobeyed the word god rejected Saul as king that's right God rejected Saul as king and it's important to remember this God rejected Saul as king but he didn't reject him as a son a lot of people you read the message and a lot of people cuz Saul tends to get a lot of slack when we talk about him and when people preach about him and speak about him and someone even tried to tell the prophet in the message they said that Saul was lost that's right Prophet said Saul was not lost what he said a lot of people try to say that he killed himself and Prophet said the prophet said Saul was wheat right Saul was wheat Saul was a real seed of God right so Saul didn't so Saul was not lost as a son God just he just lost his position so now when we see these children of Israel and they're at this they're at this Junction where they're trying to get their land back but they're afraid to go and take back what God gave them it shows you the state of having lost your position but not losing your status as a son will do to you because God was still with them they had the word they had they had God's promises they had uh uh they knew Moses was the one that took them from Egypt they knew Joshua was the one that gave them all the land they had the word there was still a prophet uh in the land during that time but they were still afraid to go and get this land that was given back to them right and I like how it says Saul and Israel because Saul was the person as a head it's important to know who your head is it's important important to know that who is your head saying that you can go forth and do things in Authority because if your head has been rejected by God and there's fear you'll follow suit that's why it's important as you know if you're a husband right uh uh it's important that when you say you believe something you really have to believe it because your family's going to be looking to you if you're not certain where you stand I guarantee your family's not going to be certain either because they're looking to you as the head they're looking to you to take some kind of action and they'll follow suit that's why Christ when he says follow me he's not saying it because he wants to bully you or he wants to show you who's in charge he says no I know exactly what uh uh you need in this journey follow me you'll have confidence amen you'll have confidence with that because you'll know your position right so um they had the word but they just needed the word to be quickened right they needed the word word to be Quicken meaning they needed a word from an appointed individual at an appointed time it's very important to understand that a message for your time and your day is of the utmost important you can't depend upon what someone what something uh what something was done in the past and you can't re and you you can put your faith in what's going to be done in the future but you need something for your day and your specific time so it makes the word real to you so that's why when people can't believe that God sent a messenger in our day uh uh to restore us back to God how can you believe in a restoration in your current situation if you can't even believe that God works in specific times all righten right so as you're going through a situation and you're needing to hold on God for some healing or something like that God's going to send you a word or a message for that specific time for you to receive in order for you to get your deliverance and if you can't believe believe that God can send a messenger for a specific time on Earth how can you get restored back right right how can you get restored back that's why believing all of these things is a purpose behind it right it's a purpose uh behind it because God has a plan and a way of doing things and he can't change that right so we're going to rewind back uh um and I know I talk I tend to talk a lot about the garden uh um but I the the Prophet said that the enemy there's two things enemy hates he hates Genesis and he hates Revelation so I'm going to keep talking about it if he hates it amen amen right so let's rewind back to the time in the garden where uh we have Adam which was God's uh manifested word spoken son the first one on the face of the Earth and in that position he had full authority over everything like we like I I had preached before there was a serpent in the garden Adam had full control over over all of that right now when the fall came Adam willingly disobeyed the word of God yes and then he tried to uh fix things up himself uh as he tried to put a covering on for as a as a man-made religion and when God came looking for Adam and asked what happened Adam passed the blame off to the woman that's right right and so when Saul when God told Saul to go down and take over this Kingdom and he said utterly destroy everything Saul did disobeyed God willingly disobeyed God came back with the stuff and the prophet Samuel heard about these things and it was Samuel looking for Saul now and when he asked Saul hey what happened here you know I hear the bleeding I hear the bleeding of the ghost what was going what was going on here Saul said well the people the people yes brother the people right yes so he's he he's putting on this same garment that Adam wore wow not knowing god had rejected it wow God had rejected it right so so now God's got to do what God's got to do he's got to step in remember Adam was given a choice Saul was given a choice but they but uh but their their choice and their solution ended ended up having them to lose their position right so when Adam made a choice and Saul made a choice and it both failed God said now I need to make a choice and God will allow you to go through life with your choices and your choices until you fail right and then say all right can I have a say so now can I make a choice can I send someone right God allows that to happen in order to show his glory So Adam lost the inheritance which was the right to the Tree of Life God said you can eat of all the trees uh uh and uh the Tree of Life which was Jesus Christ they he had lost that access to the tree of life and Israel had now now we're seeing Israel lose this little land that belonged to Judah which also represented Christ so when God had to restore things back the way he uh uh restore things back he does it how he does it uh uh how he always does it and that's he sends a message all right he sends a message right a message to be received by the people amen right and so that's why people get things twisted up when they talk about the message like oh yeah I'm a part of the message I'm a part of the message the message is not a denomination amen the message is not an idea the message is you right the message is you right right because you'll notice that when God when God elected you and showed you this message and showed you the light of it it wasn't just to show you who you were but now you have the ability to affect somebody else God can send you on the scene to help somebody else God can send you to pray to somebody else and that's why brother Jack uh uh uh brother Jack you know he'll say you know if there's someone out there that's sick oh well let me go call the pastor you don't need to call the pastor you have enough power with inside of you not only that you have the confidence of God to say the right word in order for you to bring a change in the situation right the the one time the prophet was looking to pray for a b uh pray for a baby and he was like you know I'm just I'm just what God's going to do I want to see what God's going to do and the voice came back and said I want to see what you're going to do right he had the confidence of God inside of him to speak the word and it would happen right amen so that's why we're not we're not following uh uh we're not following a denomination and I can say as my own testimony I remember one time I had caught covid and um it was Wednesday and I couldn't make it to church because I was just feeling so sick and I remember I was watching the stream and I had told my my dad I told my dad yeah I'm feeling sick you know and so I'm I'm watching we're going through churches at the end of church you know I'm hoping like hey is is anyone going to talk about me and uh pray for me and you know and say something to me and no one said nothing and I was like oh man ain't no one think about me and then some Sundays passed and a brother from Sarasota came down and he made a statement and he said he said he said something along the lines he was like you that has Co saying no one pray for me pray for yourself and it let me know and it was a rebuke to me and it let me know that I'm not here to follow we're not here to follow a church all right the word is in us and God is looking for us to have the confidence to speak it and that's not just for me it's for anybody that has received Christ you have the word you have the confidence I I I don't think we I don't think we stress that enough we have the confidence of God that before something happens he doesn't have to come and okay well let's sit down and talk about how I want this thing to go no do you realize in the Bible that Adam when he spoke mountains and moved rivers and moved flowers and stuff like that there was no meeting with God to do that God trusted Adam to make the right choice and that's what God is trying to restore us back to so he doesn't want us looking looking at a church and the church is good right he doesn't want us looking at some individual individuals are good but God wants to get his his spirit inside of us to give us confidence to believe his word so that we can speak a word in any situation because you won't always be a church right right great people won't always be there there were there there there was times uh the prophet couldn't always be there I I would read stories about the prophet how he would be in the prayer line and how after the prayer line would be finished he would be so tired he'd be cuz he'd be moving between Realms he gets so tired that he had to go and sleep but that doesn't mean God's still sleeping and so you have to catch the Revelation that it's not a man it's the spirit of God trying to get inside you so that you can speak the word in your situation and God can show up on the scene amen right so we're not a denomination so David was the message for his day right and the reason why I can say he was the message the prophet said that David T Christ and Christ was the message for his day in this situation so God had handpicked and trained this young lad and I want you to realize that this choice in David uh was 100% God's choosing right when God told the prophet to go and anointed king for Israel right now Jesse which was David's father was a righteous man and did not have confidence in David you can't trust righteous men job tried to put his faith I I I I can if we could kind of dramatize you know job was going through some time he said you know what let me call up the brothers from church I need someone to come and encourage me I need some encouraging so he set his house up he's going through his wife had done forsaken him is up in the up in the bedroom the door slammed and locked right and he's just dealing with stuff so he prepare at the house he prepared some food and some and some water and he invited them in and they came inside they and and the Bible says that they rent and they prayed and all that kind of stuff and in one just kind of scratched his b and said what' you do what sin did you do job and job was like what I called you guys here to encourage me right right the Bible says they were people from his church they were his friends right so you can't trust in righteous men all right right you can't trust in righteous men the prophet that was ordained for that day which was Samuel when he went into the house he saw the first son and said indeed this is the king and God said no that's right and that was God's prophet of the day no this choice and and every choice and that's why God wants us to fully look to him every choice has to be 100% God's word it can't be mixed in with nothing else it can't be mixed in with nothing else it's got to be 100% God in order for you to have have confidence right and so when David's training was done you know uh he sent them away so we're going to go and read uh First Samuels uh chapter 17 uh 32-40 because we're going to see how um after David uh received his training we're going to see how things transpire down make sure check all right and so it says here and David said to Saul let no man 's heart fell because of him thy servant will go and fight this Philistine I want you to know that that was the message for the time that was the message from the for that time because they were cing away uh Goliath was making his boast they were cing away and David came up here he saw this he said oh hold on a second no this this you guys may believe in that but I have a word from God and David told uh Saul let no man heart fail because of him thy servant go and fight that was the message now look at Saul's reply and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he is a man of war from his youth I want to tell you right now if you're in a position where God has you've left your position I want I want you to understand that God rejected Saul as king but really it was Saul rejecting himself as King by not keeping the word wow and so when you reject the word you you're still a son right God can't God can't he That's my boy he has to say That's my boy but you'll lose your position and you see the you see the attitude of Saul when the message came instead of saying amen he argued with it wow you can't believe the message and not be in position right you can't be in the in the message by not and not be in position which means that you have to be obeying the word of God right and so Saul and so of course David being who he was cuz David even still David still knew that Saul was righteous and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by a bear and smote him and slew him so now David is explaining how he um he's given his testimony now because the word wasn't enough and some times you know and and and I like how brother brandom uh typed this uh um typed a statement uh to today how um when uh Thomas when Jesus Christ had been resurrected and was standing before them Thomas said I won't believe it until I see the scars on your hand and Jesus said okay here are the scars let you I'll let you put your put your fingers through them and then he believed and brother brandom typed that to how some people won't receive the Holy Ghost without sensation and God will do it for him he'll give them the Holy Ghost with a sensation just because they're his child right so sometimes it it some for some people the word comes it should be enough and that's why and that's why Jesus said it great it's greater to have faith without seeing any evidence without having any evidence without seeing anything standing but just to take the word and receive the word it's greater right so Saul should have just took the word but now he got a testimony right and now he uhh he believes so we're going to go down to uh verse 37 and David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul of the lion and out of the Paul of the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with you so now he believes but you know when you've lost your position and and and and you know how it you know how it is when you're trying to to witness or not witness but talk about the message of people that have backslid or people that may have not understand the message you give them an answer that should be enough but it's not enough come on trth but it's not enough you answered their question but it's not enough for them right so now we have so now Saul said said unto David go and the Lord be with thee and Saul armored David with his armor and put a helmet of brass upon his head and also he armed him with a coat of male so now Saul is trying to interject his idea into this right and David went along with it David GED the sword his sword upon his armor in verse 39 and he is say to go for he had not proved it and David said unto Saul I cannot go with these and I'm telling you right now when you've received the baptism of the Holy Spirit you won't be able to listen to No Other Voices praise God it is against your nature that's right you know how it is when a person tries to touch fire no one out there is trying to touch fire unless they're insane because it goes against their nature and I'm telling you when when you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit when someone tries to give you something that's not word even even if even in your mind when you're struggling with it you're rejected that's right brother right because this thing that was placed inside you before the foundation of the world was God's choice 100% amen and it wasn't your choice right amen so David said in the song I cannot go with these for I have not proved them right these these these things that now I want to tell you right now Saul had victories with that armor Saul had victories with that armor Saul Saul killed the enemy and protected them but this was a new day wow wow this was a new day and God wanted to do something new God wanted to expound upon those victories right and that's why uh uh uh they after this Victory you'll notice when they danc they said Saul killed so and so but David killed more right David killed more the pro the prophet said that God can do more with you in one year than you can do in 50 years yourself in your life amen right so he said I cannot go with these I have not proved them and David put them to the side and he took his staff and found five smooth Stones because he knew that this worked and I can imagine in heaven right that before the scene is happening because God was watching over David and I can see an angel and and and God was also watching over the camp of the Israelites and I could see God see Goliath just boasting and the and the children of Israel just cowering he's just like man you have to understand that when God has chosen you his name is attached to you which is why when you find yourself in certain situations that are not pleasing to God he's got to say something and he's not proud because his it's not about how good you are and that's why a lot of people get it wrong it's not about how good you are it's about God's grace before the foundation of the world right the Bible says while we were yet sinners Christ loved us he still loved you your name was still attached to him prise God right and so he had found these uh so he found these uh five Stones he had and I can and as I was saying as I could see uh let's say a uh a scene in heaven where an angel came to God's watching Goliath and the angel came up to uh came up to the Lord and said and God was like hey how's how's my servant David doing man David he slew a lion he slew the Bear right and I'm telling you right now he had 500 sheep to watch over and he didn't lose not one standing on your word and God said That's my boy now he's ready now he said go and anoint Jesse to send him some food to go to the scene over here and the Angel's like wait you're not going to prepare David for what he's walking into I don't need to he's ready am he's on the word now I'm telling you right now that when you get to a point where God has his confidence inside of you it doesn't matter what situation you walk into you don't need to be prepared oh oh well let me just hold up I need to pray about oh I need to start studying my scriptures no when you have the word when the word has come to you and you have the word the Bible says speak amen that's what we're being back that's what we're being restored back to just speak the word and God had confidence in David that when he went to the scene without without knowing nothing he was ready Hallelujah I'm telling you we've received the same Spirit right now and I don't know what you're going through right now but you can just speak Hallelujah you can just speak thank you Jesus speak the word there's nothing greater than the word amen right and so and and so we know we know we know how the rest of the story goes and um eventually eventually uh David slew slew the uh slew Goliath and but I want you to know that what happened afterwards is that action because remember David David was a type of Christ and when Israel saw this little little kid go up there no armor on meaning he wasn't mixed in with denominational thinking or any man's idea he came out there with just a h h some stones and a little skinny guy right the enemy even confessed you're not much before but when David who was standing on the word of God swung his little uh slingshot the Bible says the the stone sunk into Goliath didn't just tap him it sunk into him right because there was an anointing behind it and he fell everybody's eyes popped open the enemy's eyes popped open oh uh the israelit eyes popped open and when David slew the head and lifted it up and and they saw the Philistines begin to run it gave the children of Israel courage to go get their restoration back glory to God it gave them the courage to go get their restoration back and I'm telling you right now Jesus is in heaven right now with death's head and he's hanging it he's already defeated what is fear what is there to fear what is there to fear cancer poverty it's all already been defeated glory to God it's already been defeated we should have the same exact fire that these children Israel and I want to tell you that the Bible says when they went back to go get their land the the the tents of the Philistines were in there and it says not only did they get their land back but they got The Spoils of what the Philistines had they got more than what they lost back God doesn't change Hallelujah God doesn't change some people may not believe the Old Testament I'll believe it God does not change that's right God Amen all right and so and so that is just a little that's that's that's a little bit of um what we have in the Old Testament because we want to we always kind of want to end it with Christ everything has got to point back to Christ right and so as we've been reading in our opening scripture of um with Matthew 17 uh and how we see this beautiful moment where Jesus is being glorified and Peter is seeing it it was a preview of what was to come and what the prophet said was that was the adoption of of Christ God was adopting his son now he was always a son and that's what you got to always remember it's always a son and Christ didn't lose anything CH we it was us that lost things it was Adam that lost right that's why even though Adam was the direct spoken word of God he couldn't die for you so that's why you can't put your faith in a man right some people want to worship prophets some people want to worship men if Adam himself which was a direct spoken word of God not born of sex or anything still couldn't die on a Christ because he failed to keep the word how much more a man that you may uh that we may have high regard for it's got to be Christ right Christ was the second Adam and so now here's Christ being adopted and it was a preview God was adopting his son and what people don't understand is adopting doesn't mean that you're just come you're just going into some uh some house or some CER to go and adopt a kid no Christ was always his son but he had confidence in him because he had gone and done his will he had confidence in him and the Bible says that Moses and Elijah were there the law Justice Peter James and John Faith Love and Hope were there as a witness to show he's ready right he's ready so now this glorified State uh uh uh that that they saw Jesus in what is the end result of what restoration is which means God wants to have confidence in you to go and speak the word right and so God is not when you read the Bible and that's this is one thing I love about reading the Bible is God it's not just stories if you read the Bible as just a story you'll miss it God's Not Looking Just for Jesus to to be in that state but he's looking for me and you to be there too amen he's looking for me and you to be there too as well right so um just to go over a couple of things when when um when they were in this uh beautiful moment and I think the Bible says that it was a vision it says that Jesus was talking with Moses and Elijah right it doesn't say he was arguing with them it doesn't say he was arguing the Bible says how can two walk unless they agree right he was conversating about his position in the word with them uh and if you can turn to if uh you don't have to turn but I can just read it in Luke 9 9: 30-31 uh it says here and behold there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem so they were speaking and conversing about God's uh position in the scripture cuz we know that he would have to go and be crucified in Jerusalem which by the way was in Judah right amen which was in Judah so I remember the pastor had made a comment before how some people don't believe in the Old Testament and they say and you'll see a lot of people a lot of uh uh uh spiritual people too say well the old testament's done and gone away we don't have to follow that but no Jesus was in this Vision talking with Moses he wanted to hear what Moses had to say right can you imagine if God himself said you know what I'm finished with the Old Testament now there's a phenomenon in nature that we see that after a rain comes a rainbow and and and what people don't understand about this is this rainbow because a lot of times people look at it from a carnal standpoint you know they'll say oh they put rainbows on stickers and on t-shirts and they'll take pictures and say oh this rainbow is a beautiful thing right but there's a lot of death behind that rainbow and that rainbow was actually a testament to God that I won't do something it's a promise that God looks at every time he sees because God didn't just send the flood because he wanted to send the flood man man man's sin in the imagination of man's heart caused God to flood and destroy everything so God said you know what I will never do this again I'll make a covenant every time you see a rainbow I promise I'll never flood the word the world again so no God still believes the Old Testament if God can keep the Old Testament so can we so can we amen and and and so and so we and we and we can't just we can't just we can't just look at Moses because we got Elijah over here and people have a problem with Elijah too right people have a problem with Elijah too and when we go down further in the scriptures for uh Matthew and um and um the the disciples asked a very good good question in reference uh to Elijah um Let me let me uh uh let me just pull this up here and and it says here in uh verse 10 uh it says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come right and so because they're caught in a vision and they're looking at Elijah they see his hair color they see his his height they see his shoes they see his his his his teeth and all him talking and stuff like that right and and they see Elias but they don't see Elias and so it's important for you to have Revelation right and um and and they had it wrong where they had it wrong is when they said why then say the scribes cuz now you're putting it back on men right and men can't give you re can't give you Revelation I want to tell you right now the message that we have today can't be explained by men men you can't have a man to explain this thing to you right the message is not confusing but it's written in a way to confuse right so that some people see it and some people don't right so you can't look at it from a man's standpoint or you'll miss it right so when they said the scribes they were putting their Revelation on men right then and there you can tell that they missed it right they're putting it back on a denomination right but I love the word because he broke it down to them right he broke things he broke things down to him and Jesus and so in verse 11 it says and Jesus answered and said unto them El Li truly first truly shall come shall first come and to do what restore restore all things how can you have a restoration without recognizing Elijah I don't know how you're going to get it right but I say unto you that Elias is all is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise also shall also the son of man uh uh Al shall also the son of man suffer of them then it says and this is the key point then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of who John the Baptist now they saw Elijah before they were looking at Elijah in the Old Testament and a lot of times people look in the Bible they're looking for they're looking at figures from an old time but this Elijah Spirit would become would come five times it was Elijah it was Elisha John the Baptist brother brandham and then the spirit will come again also to the Jews and it takes Christ to help see who that Elijah is for the day so when those people in uh and and those Jews you can and that's why you can be a prophet I mean not a prophet but you can prophesy I guarantee you right then and now the only way those Jews are going to be able to see Elijah uh Elijah is through Christ it's not going to be a seminary it's not going to be a man it's not going to be some idea it's not going to be some schooling it's just going to be the simple explanation of God saying that's him right and so that's why we stress the importance of the baptism holy of the holy spirit because he does the same exact thing that he always does in that time he pointed them to Elijah and when you receive the baptism Holy Spirit and don't see Elijah that's not Christ all right that's not Christ spirit because Christ will always point to Elijah and the Elijah for the day amen amen the Elijah for the day right they missed it but Christ was there to give it to them right so we're going to navigate and and this is an important place because we're going to kind of go through and navigate through some more things because um the reason why these guys could see it uh and I think brother Jack had made a statement is restoration is predestination right meaning Grace plays a huge role in all of this you can't explain these things that's the beautiful thing about Grace is you just can't explain it right it's not enough being born in a message church it's not enough going to a message events and things like that no before the foundation of the world you had to have had something placed inside of you for you to see it and it has to be 100% God's desire inside of you to be able to see it it can't be mixed in with anything else so Grace and the thing that Grace does is it humbles you because it makes you realize you were never in control to begin with amen you never had a choice in it to begin with right a lot a lot of times people uh you know and all of us were that way all of us were this way uh the story we talked about this before the story that was in the uh of the women that was in the bar that brother brandham had went to and this is why and this is why you can have a message church but if there's nobody inside the message to receive receive the message it's it's in vain that woman that was in the bar that brother Brandon was trying to go down and tear the place down he wanted God to burn it up God wanted to have church in a bar with a bunch of people wasn't Christians because there was someone on the inside that had something on the inside of them that could receive the word that's what church is right and it was through predestination uh that she that that that she received that right so now uh as I said before um you know um pred uh restoration is predestination and meaning Grace plays a huge role in it so when Jesus Took Peter John and James to be transfigured that was Grace picking them out of all the people that were there right that was Grace picking them to to be able to see a preview of what he was expecting of them and he ended it with a hear ye himym right so that was Grace that did that for that so in order to be saved you have to be restored with an end goal of glor of of being glorified right so Romans 8 uh Romans 8:30 tells us moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified restoration the end goal is for us to be glorified with the glory of the Lord right with the glory of the Lord right so um it's it's it's uh uh it's it's Grace that does the work and it's and it's it's the reason why God says follow thou me it's the reason why God says I don't want your thinking God has dealt with man's thinking for so long and it's always failed him it's always caused issues it always caused division to the point where God is now at a space and time where he says it has to be 100% the word or not the word right in order for it to uh uh to accomplish something right so when we're praying for a restoration when we're looking for a restoration when we're looking for a healing when we're looking for a Deliverance when we're looking for a blessing let's make sure that we've received the confidence to get it let's make sure that we receive the confidence to get it which comes through Christ amen so we'll end this in a prayer Lord Jesus Lord we' spoke your word oh Lord God Lord this isn't the ideas of man this isn't the thinking of man this isn't the will of man Lord all of us who are here today oh Lord God that see your light Lord we know that it wasn't us a lot of times we were running away from it a lot of times we were we we didn't want to go down that route but Lord you are the one that made the choice it was 100% your word Lord Jesus Christ so Lord now we're standing here oh Lord God not in our own will Lord Jesus Christ and there are some that are sick there are some that need jobs there are some that need fi uhh uh finances fixed oh Lord God there are some that have wayward children oh Lord Jesus Christ there are some that are facing a mountain oh Lord Jesus Christ that looks impossible to overcome oh Lord Jesus Christ but remember Lord you called us here out of your own will oh Lord Jesus Christ and now oh Lord Jesus Christ we're challenging you with your word back oh Lord Jesus make a way Lord Jesus Christ heal us oh Lord God heal our bodies oh Lord God heal uh uhh heal our situations increase our finances oh Lord God we recognize oh Lord God that we are in you oh Lord Jesus Christ and it's no longer our voice speaking oh Lord but yours oh Lord Jesus Christ and you only respect and honor your word Lord Jesus Christ you've rejected men Through the Ages oh Lord God just to show that you respect your word Lord God and that we could have confidence in it oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we thank you for being with us oh Lord God we bless your holy name in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord certainly appreciate uh brother Quinton on tonight and um I tell you bringing out some things I'm going have to go back and study uh but what a wonderful angle uh on restoration and uh just just so many beautiful um things that were just shared there and and uh hear ye him I I I I thank God for that thank God when he started off say restoration focal point of the Bible I had no idea he was going to take that into the story of David and Goliath wow but a a real real wonderful thought and and I guess I never looked at this armor that Saul was giving David um Saul had seen many victories in that Army but it was a new season it was a new season and I'm like no we we don't we don't need that anymore so we we we we we turn in a corner now and uh we got something else that we're going to use and uh you know just just just wonderful wonderful thoughts here you know that we we we had tonight and I'm glad I came to church that's all I can say amen amen amen amen and and one of the other beautiful things in in all the the the uh when you think about Saul's life um he just seems like a complete failure rejected by God uh as a king but could not be rejected as a son that's that's that's that's powerful that's powerful powerful yeah I tell you I thank God for that God bless you brother Quinton God bless you thank you so [Applause] much let me just get uh tonight's uh uh announcements and um and uh we'll make room for testimonies so let's see here Sunday morning our

soon as soon as I feel like something kind of take that back I ain't saying nothing negative I don't care what's going on in my life I ain't saying nothing negative but when the Lord told us that I didn't realize the 40 days is going to end on the same day that the fast end can you imagine that so God got us into something and I I just think going through this fast and not seeing nothing negative at the same time woo what could God do for us amen I'm under expectation so uh February 18th uh through March 9th uh corporate fast and then uh Sunday school also will begin on February 18th uh from 9:30 to 10: we'll have our youth uh ages 4 to 12 and then we'll have our young adults as well and that's I put ages 13 to 20 but um if anybody else the older than 20 that would like to be a

will be speaking for us that that uh that Sunday morning and at the end of the month brother Paul La Fontaine amen is is coming through uh to minister for us so we we certainly looking forward uh to that praise the Lord our giving is through cash app zela PayPal and uh cash app is dollar sign spirit and Truth tzel giving John 423 and PayPal is the same giving at John 423 org and our mailing address is at the bottom of the screen I don't think I've mentioned this on stream but uh those that have our church app we are going through some transition with this app um the company that we were using has decided not to support the platform anymore and they were trying to move us to a new platform which we introduced to you a couple years ago but on that new platform they would not give us the King James version of the Bible and um and I know that's the version that brother brandom use amen so I like to just stay with that uh I know there's a lot of new versions out there a lot of them and some of them actually have taken certain scriptures out uh so you actually miss some of the meaning and uh you know there there's another very popular that one person introduced me to was the Amplified version and um I'll tell you the reason that I didn't use the Amplified and I don't use it too much anymore what happened with the Amplified version there was a a very smart lady uh that these uh uh um uh different Publishers got behind her and said that uh since she's so smart she studied so much about the Bible we want her to kind of put her Bible together and we'll support her and uh we'll make it the Amplified version and uh I just say hey something wrong with that the woman not even supposed to preach right so something wrong here and and I said I I I don't think I'm going to read this one uh too much there's certain ones I look at and I m m m sometime you be missing the meaning uh because people try they got one even called The Message Bible that you got to be careful with right they call it the message and you look at the we follow them at no no this man that wrote The Message Bible just wrote a Bible so his Grand grandkids could understand well it's going to like the brother say it's going to take Revelation from God for these things but you don't you don't dumb with a seventh grade education explain the Bible to Us Praise the Lord so just be careful you know and I so I'm very very um um um uh committed to the King James version uh of the Bible amen so we are working on getting a a new app up and running uh for you all and and we'll let you know once that is ready to go amen and like I mentioned if um I'm still doing the the one-year Bible reading plan and if if you would like to still join me on the journey I can send you a link of uh the one that I'm using and you can join me on the journey just text me amen contact me DM me you know whatever you got to do to get to me and I'll give you the link Amen to uh to that praise the Lord all right any testimonies or uh prayer requests before we leave on tonight amen all right I got one here I got anybody else okay all right sister Linda amen God bless you you'll turn it up God bless you um I just wanted to ask for prayer for my little brother Jos because he's not feeling too well and he has a little cough so okay right amen praise the Lord most certainly remember brother hosway in prayer all

appreciate you using Brother Quenton to speak to our hearts on this sermon of hear ye hym and um God just um so much that was shared even um I know Lord just even some of the things that I want to get to on Sunday but here he comes and picks it up and carries it uh here tonight so just very very grateful how the holy spirit is just kind of putting us all in this Channel and uh Lord we're we're looking for uh so much and I I think it's so important as he said the restoration is not just the the the uh the physical things but it's the spiritual things that we must really catch because the spirit of things are Eternal things so Lord we uh pray that you would just help us Lord to meditate on the things that we've heard prayer request has come tonight for little hos the enemy attacking his body and um Lord I the parents told me a wonderful testimony of how you kept him from danger uh recently Lord and now hear the devil coming attacking him again and uh we just pray that you would just just touch him and God that you bring healing to his body and that whatever it is that it will not spread through that house but Lord it will stop lord right there with brother hos and leave his body so father we pray that you would touch him even right now and in between him and whatever the condition is we place the blood of the Lord Jesus knowing that you were wounded for his transgressions bruised for his iniquities the chastisement of his peace is upon you with your stripes we declare healing God we ask that you look upon the Saints as they prepare to leave this place but not your presence go with us and may you keep us bring us back at the appointed time on Sunday morning under expectation use brother Cathy Lord in a special way uh for our assembly you know what we stand in need of God so come and and speak to us and encourage us uh Lord let us let us hear your voice once more as we heard you tonight uh we're careful to give you all the glory the honor and
