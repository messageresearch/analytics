[44:08] to cast it down
[44:09] no matter what we're going through in
[44:11] life amen
[44:13] but uh uh brother diggs has just been a
[44:16] dear friend for a number of years and
[44:18] when we were first starting out the
[44:20] ministry amen he was one of the first
[44:23] preachers to come
[44:25] to us there when we were in green acres
[44:27] and
[44:28] you know and and just kind of been with
[44:30] us through
[44:32] every season
[44:33] uh
[44:34] just just been a mainstay
[44:37] you know kind of in our life and and as
[44:39] we're in this season
[44:41] he's the first minister to pass through
[44:44] amen at this time and and he was here
[44:46] last night when we were just kind of
[44:48] stuck outside the gate couldn't get
[44:49] inside and nobody was here to unlock the
[44:51] door some kind of way to the uh the
[44:53] custodians thought that we were going to
[44:55] be here at seven o'clock in the morning
[44:57] rather than 7 00 pm they came at 7 00
[44:59] a.m to open the open the gates and so we
[45:03] start calling around and like oh we
[45:04] thought 7 a.m like uh i don't know how
[45:07] y'all got that wrong but it happened i
[45:09] said lord we need our own keys not to
[45:12] this school but to our own building
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:18] but you know you learned just to just to
[45:20] thank god my wife was telling me so you
[45:21] know um we'll take this because you know
[45:24] when we were we had it in green acres we
[45:26] was next door to a bar and and man they
[45:29] were just good god you trying to have
[45:31] church they just got the music blasting
[45:33] through the wall
[45:35] and uh you know we couldn't we couldn't
[45:37] get them to turn the music down so i
[45:39] walked over and tried to talk with him
[45:41] me and my father
[45:43] and they said no no no don't just leave
[45:45] us alone we not messing with you you
[45:47] don't mess with us i say okay
[45:49] so as i was walking out the the the
[45:51] building
[45:52] amen they had a mat on the floor and
[45:54] just inspiration struck me and i just
[45:56] wiped my foot
[45:58] on the mat did like that and walked out
[46:00] the door and i didn't know my daddy saw
[46:02] what i did he didn't know why i did it
[46:05] so he
[46:08] walked out the door
[46:11] can you can you imagine the power that's
[46:13] in this
[46:15] never even said a word i just
[46:17] [Music]
[46:19] and walked out the door because you know
[46:21] the bible tells us that if people won't
[46:23] receive you just wipe your feet
[46:26] that's all the bible
[46:27] right
[46:30] just wipe your feet you'll need a gun
[46:31] you'll need nothing no knife or nothing
[46:33] just wipe your feet
[46:36] and we wiped our feet and within one
[46:38] week that place was shut down
[46:43] shut down
[46:46] so
[46:46] what we learned is that let god fight
[46:48] the battle

[47:29] battle
[47:30] amen but but we you know we remember
[47:33] times like that
[47:35] and god just give us testimonies all
[47:37] along the way so even during this season
[47:40] we're gonna have a testimony
[47:42] you know and uh you know i know that
[47:44] there's many that's watching and waiting
[47:47] for god just to do the next next thing

[1:00:22] that believe on his name
[1:00:28] were born not of blood
[1:00:30] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the

[1:02:06] girl there's more that meets the eye
[1:02:09] you know and you can't judge a book by
[1:02:11] its cover
[1:02:12] you got to open the book read it and see
[1:02:14] what the content is all about
[1:02:16] you know and a lot of times
[1:02:19] people read the content but they don't
[1:02:21] stay with the content
[1:02:23] you know and that's what's very
[1:02:25] important about what we consider to be
[1:02:27] the message of the hour
[1:02:28] we have to stay with the content
[1:02:31] because the content is all about making
[1:02:33] a rapture the content is all about
[1:02:36] changing us hallelujah
[1:02:38] that we may be uh uh back into an
[1:02:41] eternal state to be with the lord
[1:02:43] so the content is what's very important
[1:02:46] you know it ain't uh everything on the
[1:02:48] outside it ain't you know uh the
[1:02:51] mistakes and all the stuff but it's
[1:02:53] what was the prophet talking about
[1:02:55] what was he bringing to the people amen
[1:02:58] and even so now in our day amen what's
[1:03:02] the content of the bride of christ
[1:03:05] you know but when i think about uh what
[1:03:07] the scripture says
[1:03:09] he says
[1:03:10] through all that can receive him he gave
[1:03:13] us power
[1:03:14] power to become something amen
[1:03:17] so this word that we're hearing this
[1:03:19] word that you're hearing preach
[1:03:21] this word is changing you amen
[1:03:24] this word is is is making you become
[1:03:27] something that the word is producing as
[1:03:30] you hear it amen
[1:03:31] so hallelujah if we look at uh the world
[1:03:35] and we see that the world is constantly
[1:03:37] changing into something hollywood why
[1:03:40] because it's the time we're living in
[1:03:43] but you see the world changing and all
[1:03:46] these things going on but let's make it
[1:03:48] clear god don't change
[1:03:51] god remains the same
[1:03:53] so church really what god is doing when
[1:03:56] he says power to become he's bringing us
[1:03:59] back into our original state
[1:04:02] not that we've changed we've just
[1:04:04] forgotten who we are holy see you were
[1:04:07] always a son of god you were always a
[1:04:10] daughter of god and what the word comes
[1:04:12] to do is to open up your understanding
[1:04:15] to bring you back to you can relate to
[1:04:18] your real substance amen
[1:04:20] in church uh power to become something
[1:04:22] amen you know but first we must
[1:04:25] understand
[1:04:26] who god is
[1:04:28] we must understand what god did for us
[1:04:31] hallelujah by just becoming god
[1:04:34] hallelujah you know before i go any
[1:04:36] further you know i'm going to talk about
[1:04:38] uh
[1:04:39] the state of the world today and you
[1:04:41] know last night we talked about covert a
[1:04:43] little bit but i want to show how the
[1:04:46] devil is only a copycat
[1:04:49] everything he do he's copying off of god
[1:04:53] he doesn't even have his own thoughts
[1:04:56] everything about him he says god i saw
[1:04:58] you do that and i'm going to do it
[1:05:01] but i'm going to do it in a perverted
[1:05:02] way
[1:05:03] he saw truth hallelujah so satan said
[1:05:06] i'm going to take the truth and make a
[1:05:07] lie
[1:05:09] he even saw the body of christ
[1:05:11] hallelujah and he wanted his own body
[1:05:14] church remember when he was up in heaven
[1:05:16] he saw god's glory and satan said i want
[1:05:20] to be worshiped
[1:05:21] see everything about him here he's
[1:05:23] pulling off of what he saw from god
[1:05:27] and you know we look at the condition of
[1:05:29] the world with covert 19 and all these
[1:05:32] diseases and things that are going for
[1:05:34] church all the enemy is doing is
[1:05:38] perverting what the truth is really is
[1:05:41] and you know the reason why i'm kind of
[1:05:43] starting here because the prophet of god
[1:05:45] said in the message amen he said that
[1:05:49] let me say this real quick
[1:05:51] he said that natural things type out
[1:05:55] spiritual things hallelujah so you look
[1:05:58] at the covet and what's going on with
[1:06:00] the covet
[1:06:02] mutation
[1:06:03] church it first started out and they
[1:06:06] said it was a sickness and everything
[1:06:07] and you got to take a shot
[1:06:10] and because the kobe wouldn't let up let
[1:06:12] me tell you something it didn't get
[1:06:14] stronger
[1:06:16] no it didn't get stronger it just
[1:06:18] continued to move
[1:06:19] so as they continue to move they say hey
[1:06:22] you got to take a second vaccination
[1:06:24] but it still didn't go away see it
[1:06:27] didn't get stronger what was it doing it
[1:06:29] was
[1:06:30] mutating the strands of it hallelujah
[1:06:33] the genes of it hallelujah it will
[1:06:35] continue to move into different areas of
[1:06:38] the body the same sickness holly
[1:06:41] like i said like the same sickness that
[1:06:44] started with a cough turned into a fever
[1:06:49] and from a fever hallelujah started
[1:06:51] putting water in your lungs
[1:06:54] and from water in your lungs it started
[1:06:56] shortening your breath it all started
[1:06:58] maybe with a cough
[1:07:01] but did it begin to mutate
[1:07:03] and as it mutated it looked like it was
[1:07:05] stronger but let me tell you something
[1:07:07] it's still just a cough
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:13] but we see satan
[1:07:15] where does he get mutation from
[1:07:20] glory
[1:07:24] church
[1:07:25] mutation started with god holy
[1:07:29] he was the first one
[1:07:30] to change his form
[1:07:33] holy the prophet of god said
[1:07:35] in the beginning he wasn't even god
[1:07:38] he was just eternal amen he was there
[1:07:41] all by himself there was nothing else he
[1:07:44] was just eternal but he knew we could
[1:07:46] never hardly understand who he is as
[1:07:49] just being eternal so what did he do
[1:07:52] hallelujah try he began to mutate
[1:07:55] hallelujah and the prophet of god said
[1:07:57] hey he was so high he couldn't go no
[1:08:00] higher so instead of him going higher he
[1:08:03] mutated down
[1:08:05] and as he went from eternal hallelujah
[1:08:09] as he went from eternal hallelujah he
[1:08:11] began to mutate down then he became
[1:08:14] elohim
[1:08:15] wow
[1:08:16] hallelujah as he was elohim elohim means
[1:08:20] self-existing but what i want you to
[1:08:22] understand how satan brought a cold here
[1:08:25] with the fever and with the fever
[1:08:27] hallelujah all these other sicknesses
[1:08:29] when god mutated from eternal to elohim
[1:08:33] he brought eternity with him
[1:08:40] wow
[1:08:43] so as he became self-existent
[1:08:45] he still was a self-existent eternal one
[1:08:49] she didn't leave eternity up there but
[1:08:52] he continued to bring it hardly
[1:08:54] as he came down
[1:08:56] because there was no other higher
[1:08:58] hollywood he could go so he came down
[1:09:00] but he's trying to get somewhere he's
[1:09:02] mutating
[1:09:04] before before i go into that give me
[1:09:06] that uh explanation about mutation
[1:09:11] let's look at what mutation really is
[1:09:13] church earlier
[1:09:14] mutation
[1:09:16] occurs when a dna gene is damaged or
[1:09:19] changed into such a way as to alter the
[1:09:22] genetic message carried by the gene
[1:09:26] see so what god is doing as he's
[1:09:28] mutating he's bringing a message
[1:09:31] somewhere
[1:09:34] wow come on somebody now ain't gonna be
[1:09:36] long but i want you to catch it
[1:09:38] he's not just changing forms just to
[1:09:40] show how good he is he's trying to get a
[1:09:43] message somewhere
[1:09:44] and as he's changing he's taking the
[1:09:46] message of eternal
[1:09:48] the message of hallelujah self-existing
[1:09:51] and he keeps bringing it down and he
[1:09:53] wraps all of that up into one message
[1:09:56] that he's going to express hollywood and
[1:09:58] as he mutates hardly he says the
[1:10:01] mutation is an agent
[1:10:04] this message is working for god
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:11] hallelujah
[1:10:12] turns it as he as he mutates he comes
[1:10:16] down holly first
[1:10:18] was he eternal yeah
[1:10:20] feli became elohim hardly
[1:10:24] then he became god
[1:10:30] when he became god
[1:10:32] the message went from here eternal
[1:10:35] self-existent and now it has to be a
[1:10:38] worship
[1:10:39] because god is an object of worship
[1:10:42] but the thing we have to understand
[1:10:43] about the mutation of god not just
[1:10:46] worship but from that worship hallelujah
[1:10:49] god put the spoken word back in the
[1:10:51] people's mouth
[1:10:53] so from there as he began to be eternal
[1:10:56] amen and y'all gonna hear me keep saying
[1:10:58] this because i want you to understand
[1:11:00] who your god is
[1:11:01] holy god don't change holy one thing
[1:11:04] you're gonna know you're gonna know
[1:11:06] today by the time we're finished the
[1:11:08] character richness of god
[1:11:10] hallelujah so when you get in a tight
[1:11:12] spot you'll be able to say to that tight
[1:11:14] spot down though my god is eternal
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] hey man and when you get in another
[1:11:22] tight spot you can tell the devil my god
[1:11:24] is self-existent
[1:11:26] i'm not thinking about you he's eternal
[1:11:28] he's self-existing
[1:11:30] and then he dropped down to being god
[1:11:32] amen and as he became god the prophet of
[1:11:35] god said the logos came out of his mouth
[1:11:42] so now the eternal
[1:11:44] self-existent god began to let the logos
[1:11:48] which was god's creative power coming
[1:11:50] out of his mouth
[1:11:52] so did he begin to say let there be
[1:11:54] hallelujah let there be this and it was
[1:11:57] let there be that and it was hallelujah
[1:12:00] church as god began to mutate the stages
[1:12:04] of god followed him
[1:12:10] so now he's in a place of mutation see
[1:12:13] church these things have always been
[1:12:15] here
[1:12:16] you know
[1:12:18] a tadpole mutates to what
[1:12:21] a frog
[1:12:23] without that tadpole you'll never get
[1:12:24] the frog
[1:12:26] a caterpillar mutates into a what a
[1:12:29] butterfly without those early stages of
[1:12:32] calling
[1:12:33] without those early stages of inching
[1:12:37] that butterfly would never be able to
[1:12:39] fly
[1:12:42] even church hallelujah the mutation of
[1:12:45] that particular uh species it called for
[1:12:50] a a cocoon
[1:12:54] it called for a stage where it looked
[1:12:56] like a mess
[1:13:00] it called for a stage to where nobody
[1:13:04] would know hallelujah what it looked
[1:13:06] like once it came out of it
[1:13:08] it would have its own colors
[1:13:10] it would have its own uh stripes and
[1:13:13] patterns and everything about his life
[1:13:15] but nobody knows what it's going to be
[1:13:17] while it's in the cocoon holy your
[1:13:20] spiritual mutation will bring you to a
[1:13:22] cocoon
[1:13:23] but don't worry there's something that's
[1:13:26] going to come out of it that's going to
[1:13:27] allow you to fly in places you've never
[1:13:30] been in before
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:36] from that stage from the caterpillar to
[1:13:39] the cocoon hallelujah the butterfly
[1:13:42] never crawls again
[1:13:49] is anybody mutating in this place
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:55] he said count it all joy
[1:13:57] will you fall into diver's temptation
[1:14:00] why are those trials there god's trying
[1:14:03] to get you to become something
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:07] he's bringing forth a spiritual mutation
[1:14:10] he's trying to get you to see the
[1:14:12] message for your life
[1:14:16] [Music]
[1:14:18] hallelujah
[1:14:20] but look the lord is so special
[1:14:23] he has a purpose for all of us
[1:14:25] the prophet god said he would be too
[1:14:27] mysterious that's just eternal
[1:14:30] so he wanted to take the mystery away
[1:14:34] so we can understand who we worship
[1:14:37] so as he's coming down
[1:14:40] hallelujah he goes from eternal mutation
[1:14:43] elohim mutate eternal self-existent
[1:14:47] hurling mutate one more time god
[1:14:49] hallelujah and from god he still aim him
[1:14:52] self-existent and eternal then he
[1:14:55] mutates with the logos coming out of his
[1:14:57] mouth
[1:14:58] but what did he do with that logos hey
[1:15:00] man now here we go
[1:15:03] he put that logos
[1:15:05] in the last mutation that god would ever
[1:15:07] mutate
[1:15:08] he put that where in a man
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:13] [Applause]
[1:15:14] come on somebody
[1:15:17] god didn't stop mutating until he came
[1:15:20] to you
[1:15:21] and after he came to you he never
[1:15:23] changed his form again
[1:15:30] after god hallelujah changed all the way
[1:15:32] down he changed mass all the way down
[1:15:35] from eternal self-existent to god the
[1:15:37] logos did he put his image and likeness
[1:15:40] in a man and he never went any lower
[1:15:47] are you with me church
[1:15:49] all of god
[1:15:52] all the dead ears
[1:15:54] all of god is in you
[1:15:56] eternal is in you
[1:15:58] self-existing is in you
[1:16:00] holy the logos is in you
[1:16:03] and once god put all that he is in you
[1:16:06] he said
[1:16:07] now
[1:16:08] i can rest
[1:16:13] church as he created man god said
[1:16:17] i'm done i'm pleased it's over
[1:16:24] listen
[1:16:25] listen church
[1:16:27] spiritual mutation is all about a
[1:16:29] message
[1:16:30] and see the message what god was trying
[1:16:32] to show us is all that i am i put in you
[1:16:37] and we hear the prophet say it over and
[1:16:39] over again if you get a spoonful of the
[1:16:41] ocean
[1:16:42] you got every element of that ocean in
[1:16:44] that spoon
[1:16:45] so let me tell you something when you
[1:16:47] get the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:16:49] get eternal
[1:16:51] you get the self-existing one
[1:16:53] you get god's status
[1:16:55] amen that's the one i think trips us up
[1:16:59] see he didn't have to be god but he
[1:17:02] became god because he wanted you and us
[1:17:05] to understand that we are gods
[1:17:09] hallelujah
[1:17:11] we are gods
[1:17:12] well let me back up a little bit holly
[1:17:15] before he got to man hallelujah
[1:17:17] god the logos he began to speak he said
[1:17:21] let us make man
[1:17:23] in our image
[1:17:25] you know that that that particular
[1:17:27] question has been up for debate
[1:17:29] hollywood for years and years
[1:17:33] but look at it church holy
[1:17:35] nothing else is dead
[1:17:39] who is he talking to
[1:17:41] you know some people say it was us the
[1:17:43] bribe we wasn't there
[1:17:46] earlier in order in order for us to be
[1:17:49] there it has to be a mind there it
[1:17:51] wasn't even a mind there yet you know
[1:17:53] why because he was just all eternal
[1:17:57] just all space
[1:17:59] and then all space became self-existing
[1:18:01] and then we dropped down to god
[1:18:03] hallelujah he's asking a question he
[1:18:05] said let us make man in our image who is
[1:18:08] he talking to church holy he looks back
[1:18:15] and he looks at himself
[1:18:17] because he
[1:18:19] who was
[1:18:20] eternal
[1:18:21] and self-existent
[1:18:23] has now dropped down to these stages and
[1:18:25] he said let us
[1:18:28] create man in our own image
[1:18:33] see god is so powerful hallelujah he
[1:18:36] don't need nobody else's opinion
[1:18:39] his opinion is his opinion and he is
[1:18:42] alone so god looks back hallelujah to
[1:18:44] the self expressions of himself which
[1:18:47] was eternal and self-existent and says
[1:18:50] let us make man hallelujah eternal
[1:18:53] self-existent god
[1:18:56] so god created man
[1:18:58] in his own image in his own likeness
[1:19:00] there was no other likeness at that time
[1:19:03] but the likeness of the eternal one
[1:19:10] hey
[1:19:11] take out your big gloves now
[1:19:14] holly
[1:19:15] don't let it go over your head
[1:19:18] because what i'm expressing today is who
[1:19:21] you are
[1:19:22] in church god looks at he turns back has
[1:19:25] a conversation with himself holly
[1:19:27] you ever had a conversation with
[1:19:28] yourself
[1:19:33] where did it come from
[1:19:38] it's all right sometimes when you're
[1:19:39] discussing spiritual things in your
[1:19:41] spirit and you say well i'm just talking
[1:19:43] to myself
[1:19:45] because it all started with god
[1:19:48] nobody else could help him create
[1:19:50] anything in his own image because he was
[1:19:53] the only creator
[1:19:55] hallelujah so as he created hallelujah
[1:19:58] and he began to have a conversation when
[1:20:00] you know you have a conversation ah i
[1:20:02] ain't gonna do it like i'm gonna do it
[1:20:03] like this when you think about spiritual
[1:20:05] things amen so church in everything we
[1:20:07] do we have to see that it has to be in
[1:20:10] uh uh a spiritual origin amen
[1:20:13] hallelujah so church we see god talk to
[1:20:15] himself and he said let us create man in
[1:20:18] our own image hollywood in our likeness
[1:20:21] and just to show it was true when adam
[1:20:24] was created adam could do everything god
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:28] descended and brought down to him
[1:20:32] hallelujah he could create
[1:20:35] hallelujah hey man
[1:20:37] he was self-existent
[1:20:39] nobody hallelujah got any primitives in
[1:20:42] the garden but adam
[1:20:44] adam was so much like god god created
[1:20:48] and brought the creation to adam and say
[1:20:50] you name it
[1:20:52] why because he was in his image and
[1:20:54] likeness he felt like god he talked like
[1:20:56] god you know what i would just go ahead
[1:20:58] and say he was a god
[1:21:06] so when he mutated he put all that
[1:21:10] in adam
[1:21:15] listen
[1:21:17] the prophet says now
[1:21:19] when god made man in his image
[1:21:21] he was a spirit man
[1:21:23] and then there was no man to till the
[1:21:26] soul
[1:21:26] that he created man out of the dust of
[1:21:28] the earth now chronologists and so forth
[1:21:32] and these people that search and get old
[1:21:35] bones and so forth and believe in
[1:21:37] evolution uh-oh
[1:21:39] now the prophet's gonna tell you what
[1:21:41] evolution really is
[1:21:45] the prophet says he believes in
[1:21:47] evolution he didn't say dogmas theory he
[1:21:49] said i believe in evolution but listen
[1:21:51] what he says he says i believe in the
[1:21:54] right kind of evolution
[1:21:56] man
[1:21:57] evolutes from himself
[1:22:01] all right
[1:22:02] all right
[1:22:05] so we evolute
[1:22:07] we're not going to evolute from a monkey
[1:22:10] you're not going to evolute from a
[1:22:12] donkey
[1:22:14] you're going to evolute from the seed
[1:22:16] within you
[1:22:18] you're going to evolute from the genetic
[1:22:22] message within you
[1:22:27] hallelujah
[1:22:28] but if we if we we see all these things
[1:22:31] listen let me let me keep reading he
[1:22:32] said he ever lose from himself but not
[1:22:35] all from one's hell no no sir
[1:22:38] because a bird has been a bird
[1:22:41] ever since god made him a bird so what
[1:22:44] he's saying is a bird doesn't mutate
[1:22:47] into a fish
[1:22:48] no he mutates from himself hallelujah so
[1:22:52] church what he's saying to us is that if
[1:22:54] we become anything it's already in us
[1:22:59] hallelujah the seed of god is already in
[1:23:02] you holly so what are you saying brother
[1:23:04] jesus i'm saying when god created you in
[1:23:07] your seed he put eternal life in it
[1:23:12] from your seed hallelujah he put love in
[1:23:15] it
[1:23:16] hey man he put patience in that seat he
[1:23:18] put brotherly kindness in that seat he
[1:23:21] put temperance in that seats see church
[1:23:23] these are not things that has to be
[1:23:25] added to us we just mutate into those
[1:23:28] things
[1:23:29] it's already there
[1:23:32] hallelujah but certain situations brings
[1:23:35] it out
[1:23:37] amen that's why god handle you see
[1:23:39] church you don't know what you're able
[1:23:41] to do until you get in a situation where
[1:23:44] you have a need
[1:23:47] see the prophet didn't know anything
[1:23:49] about the third pool until he needed a
[1:23:51] pool
[1:23:54] now god is going to show him who he
[1:23:56] really is
[1:23:57] he's out there hunting hallelujah but
[1:23:59] there's nothing to hunt
[1:24:01] holy so his situation is going to create
[1:24:05] something that he needs
[1:24:07] are you catching me
[1:24:08] your situation
[1:24:10] spirit and truth
[1:24:12] is going to create
[1:24:14] a church building
[1:24:20] hallelujah
[1:24:21] your need hallelujah
[1:24:23] makes god ever lose or change masks as
[1:24:27] the prophet said to meet that need
[1:24:29] remember he said it's not a different
[1:24:31] character it's the same character
[1:24:34] playing a different role for that
[1:24:36] situation
[1:24:38] so what he does as jehovah sometimes
[1:24:41] he's gyara
[1:24:46] hallelujah
[1:24:47] and you know as jehovah sometimes he's
[1:24:50] rafa
[1:24:51] he's still hallelujah jehovah one who
[1:24:54] exists with his family hallelujah but
[1:24:56] then sometimes he mutates or changes
[1:24:59] mass and calls himself shama
[1:25:04] hallelujah
[1:25:06] and you know one of the ones i love amen
[1:25:08] he calls himself holy jehovah rod
[1:25:17] but he's still one who exists with his
[1:25:19] family
[1:25:20] hallelujah so as he changed mass think
[1:25:22] about it hey man as he changed mass as
[1:25:24] one who exists with his family first
[1:25:27] things first he has to identify himself
[1:25:29] as a father
[1:25:31] because if he got a family he has to be
[1:25:33] a father and when you think about a
[1:25:35] father you think about his words
[1:25:37] holy and i always use my daughter for
[1:25:39] this you know she's about to get into a
[1:25:41] level where she's driving on her own and
[1:25:43] all these things and i said you know
[1:25:45] what if i come to my daughter and i say
[1:25:47] honey when you turn 18 i'm gonna have
[1:25:49] you at 500 beans
[1:25:55] ah brother you get that girl i'm gonna
[1:25:57] say that she ain't this and that get
[1:25:59] that girl corolla you don't think like i
[1:26:01] think
[1:26:05] remember
[1:26:07] she's looking at me
[1:26:09] as the one who gives out promises
[1:26:14] hallelujah so she's going to look at me
[1:26:16] at what kind of promises i got
[1:26:19] what kind of things that i've said i'm
[1:26:21] going to do for her holiday
[1:26:23] you know if i'll say i'm going to get
[1:26:24] you a bicycle she said i only want that
[1:26:26] promise to come to pass
[1:26:30] i'm past that stage i don't even want
[1:26:31] that i ain't even looking at that we
[1:26:33] should be past how we dressing how we
[1:26:35] look at all those things holy we should
[1:26:38] be past paying tithes we should be past
[1:26:40] all that stuff hallelujah all right the
[1:26:43] church you think about if i make her a
[1:26:44] promise holly because i'm a promise
[1:26:48] keeper our god is a promise keeper
[1:26:52] so now she's looking at me as one who
[1:26:54] exists with his family that daddy said
[1:26:57] he was gonna buy me a mercedes when i
[1:26:59] turned 18. you know what she's gonna map
[1:27:02] it out on the calendar
[1:27:06] she might have a whole year to go
[1:27:08] brother solomon but all she know is
[1:27:10] daddy said
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:15] daddy said
[1:27:16] when i get this age on this date on the
[1:27:19] 21st of november i'm gonna have me a
[1:27:21] mistake
[1:27:23] and what happened it produces an
[1:27:25] expectation because daddy has never lied
[1:27:28] to her
[1:27:30] daddy has always kept his word
[1:27:32] what are you saying i'm talking about
[1:27:34] jesus
[1:27:36] he's a promise keeper
[1:27:39] he has never told us a lie he's always
[1:27:42] kept his word
[1:27:44] he said i will supply all your needs
[1:27:48] he said trust in me and lean not to your
[1:27:51] own
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:58] understanding church like i said last
[1:28:00] night he told abraham hallelujah that
[1:28:04] i'm gonna give y'all a land hallelujah
[1:28:05] elaine he told children i'm gonna give
[1:28:07] you a land floor with milk and honey
[1:28:10] what they needed to do was anchor down

[1:28:14] that message reached the place it's
[1:28:16] supposed to reach it can't change
[1:28:19] so once it gets to you you hold on to it
[1:28:22] and say god i'm looking for it

[1:36:40] so let me ask you what kind of new
[1:36:43] building y'all want
[1:36:48] remember church hallelujah there was a
[1:36:51] there was a little girl a little boy who
[1:36:53] didn't have eyes
[1:36:55] earlier and before the prophet prayed he
[1:36:58] said what color eyes you want
[1:37:03] he said what kind of eyes you want and
[1:37:05] billy paul said hallelujah as he began
[1:37:07] to pray he seen blue streaks coming down
[1:37:09] hallelujah in the atmosphere hallelujah
[1:37:12] and after he prayed and that child
[1:37:13] opened their eyes they had blue eyes
[1:37:18] because that's what they asked for me
[1:37:20] but this sister church she uh uh let me
[1:37:22] see what time it is
[1:37:26] she said lord all i need is an
[1:37:28] opportunity just one call
[1:37:30] so she got a call back they say hey we
[1:37:33] want you to come in and do an interview
[1:37:34] and you know you get one of these jobs
[1:37:36] where you have to pass certain kind of
[1:37:38] tests
[1:37:39] you know you have to have uh
[1:37:41] uh characteristics testing and all these
[1:37:44] other math tests and everything her
[1:37:45] first test was a math test and she said
[1:37:48] lord i'm just no good in math
[1:37:51] this was a high power job
[1:37:53] she said lord
[1:37:56] all i can do is pray
[1:37:58] that you got my hand
[1:38:06] jesus
[1:38:07] be offense
[1:38:09] all around me every day
[1:38:13] church and she prayed the prayer say
[1:38:15] lord
[1:38:16] i want you to guide my hand
[1:38:18] on this answer sheet
[1:38:20] and i'm going to trust you
[1:38:22] now let me show you real faith
[1:38:24] church when you ask god
[1:38:27] don't add none of your stuff to it
[1:38:30] she asked god to guide her hands
[1:38:33] so you know from there brother solomon
[1:38:35] after she asked god to guide her hand
[1:38:38] when she started taking the test brother
[1:38:39] jack she didn't even read the questions
[1:38:41] anymore
[1:38:46] she pushed the book aside
[1:38:48] put a hand on the answer sheet
[1:38:51] and went
[1:38:52] i think this a
[1:38:54] i think this b i think this c i think
[1:38:56] this d i think this a
[1:38:58] i think this b
[1:39:00] i think this c i think this d i think
[1:39:02] this a
[1:39:03] i think this b
[1:39:05] i think this c i think this d i think
[1:39:07] this a
[1:39:11] and now it looked like she went through
[1:39:12] the whole test guessing but she went
[1:39:15] through the whole test hallelujah
[1:39:17] believing what she asked god for
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:21] she has gone to get out of her hand
[1:39:24] hallelujah so she talked to tessity with
[1:39:26] three other ladies that took the test
[1:39:28] with her hallelujah and at church she
[1:39:30] got a call back

[1:39:41] and you didn't just pass
[1:39:43] you made a perfect score
[1:39:44] [Applause]

[1:39:59] church he ain't go halfway past the test
[1:40:01] anybody looking for a perfect score in
[1:40:03] his place
[1:40:10] they say we've never seen this in the
[1:40:11] history of test-taking
[1:40:15] because all those other people before
[1:40:16] her never asked god to take their tests
[1:40:20] or god they hang
[1:40:22] on
[1:40:25] but then they wasn't done

[1:40:29] we need you to take well we got to we
[1:40:31] need you to go to the next interview
[1:40:33] and god was so on point
[1:40:36] god was so with us
[1:40:38] church remember in the scriptures holy
[1:40:40] sometimes god had to open our eyes to
[1:40:42] where we're standing remember elijah was
[1:40:45] out there hey man they got surrounded
[1:40:47] holy and his servant came out there and
[1:40:49] woke up and saw all the the the chariots
[1:40:52] and all these things oh my god we in

[1:40:54] see his mind started to fear he started
[1:40:57] going to places but elijah just stood
[1:40:59] there
[1:41:00] and he said lord
[1:41:02] open his eyes
[1:41:04] so he can see what's really going on
[1:41:07] and then that moment the lord opened his
[1:41:09] eyes and there was chariots of fire
[1:41:11] holy
[1:41:12] behind the enemy the enemy didn't even
[1:41:15] know that they were surrounded
[1:41:17] hallelujah
[1:41:18] so church what i'm saying is he's always
[1:41:21] there
[1:41:23] hallelujah so church she goes to the
[1:41:25] next level hey man and she's meeting
[1:41:28] with the interviewer hallelujah and now
[1:41:30] you're supposed to have another question
[1:41:31] totally and you have to come you have to
[1:41:33] answer it right but this particular
[1:41:35] interview is some kind of way
[1:41:37] she began to tell her what to say
[1:41:41] she says okay they're going to ask you a
[1:41:43] question and this is how you respond now
[1:41:46] when they ask you this question this is
[1:41:47] what you say and when they ask you this
[1:41:49] question this is what you're saying on
[1:41:51] and on and on so by the time she got to
[1:41:53] the next interviewer she already had all
[1:41:55] the answers on what would say to pass
[1:41:57] the test
[1:42:00] church you can see where i'm going
[1:42:02] harley
[1:42:04] by the end of all her testing there was
[1:42:06] no way that they could ever not give her
[1:42:08] the job no matter what her countrymen
[1:42:11] status was
[1:42:12] no matter where she came from hallelujah
[1:42:15] they had to give it a job hallelujah
[1:42:17] because her scores were out of this
[1:42:19] world
[1:42:22] because you have to realize the person
[1:42:24] that was taking the test was eternal
[1:42:26] hallelujah was self-existing amen was
[1:42:29] god hardly and had the locust coming out
[1:42:32] of her mouth
[1:42:37] there's a sister in my church who had
[1:42:40] got a sick right around the cove time
[1:42:42] she had a new job and she couldn't go to
[1:42:44] work hallelujah church she said oh god i
[1:42:47] just got this new job and now i can't go
[1:42:49] to work because i'm sick god said don't
[1:42:51] worry
[1:42:52] church
[1:42:53] for a whole month without never clocking
[1:42:56] in on that job she got a check every
[1:42:58] week
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:04] never even wrote her name on the time
[1:43:06] clock
[1:43:08] never even came to work
[1:43:10] and for a month every week she got a
[1:43:12] full 40-hour paycheck
[1:43:16] now i'm gonna say it again won't he do
[1:43:18] it
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:23] people looking at me crazy when i say i
[1:43:25] want me a maserati
[1:43:30] come on brother be humble now
[1:43:39] whatever
[1:43:44] like we say it ain't the car that make
[1:43:45] the man is the man to make the car
[1:43:48] hallelujah it ain't the clothes that
[1:43:49] make the man is the man that make the
[1:43:51] clothes holler it's who you are
[1:43:54] and how you conduct yourself this church
[1:43:56] if i get an r that ain't going to stop
[1:43:58] me from being a christian
[1:44:00] holly
[1:44:02] he might mess with your mind
[1:44:04] but he's going to mess with mine because
[1:44:05] i'm gonna come to church just as blessed
[1:44:07] as i always was
[1:44:09] it's just that now i'm driving to rose
[1:44:11] ross
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:18] you get all upset about what god is
[1:44:20] doing in somebody else's life no you
[1:44:22] ought to rejoice with them
[1:44:24] because that's your brother he's one who
[1:44:27] exists with his family
[1:44:29] if god did it for one child he could do
[1:44:32] it for the next child
[1:44:33] [Applause]
[1:44:38] why do we feel like to be christians we
[1:44:40] got to be struggling
[1:44:46] i don't know listen
[1:44:49] church
[1:44:50] the prophet of god he says
[1:44:52] now i ain't gonna be too much longer
[1:44:54] listen
[1:44:57] he says now the greek word
[1:45:00] therefore this this is in the message uh
[1:45:02] i believe this is the unveiling of god
[1:45:05] yeah this is in the unveiling of god i
[1:45:07] think
[1:45:07] he says now the greek word there
[1:45:10] for that form i've been looking at and
[1:45:12] all day yesterday trying to think what
[1:45:15] it is i find
[1:45:16] he said come up with the word of amorphy
[1:45:20] and then he spells him off and he says
[1:45:23] looking in the greek to find out what
[1:45:25] morphe was
[1:45:27] i may pronounce that wrong but the
[1:45:30] reason i spell it when it's on
[1:45:32] when the tape is released the people
[1:45:34] will scholars scholars will know what i
[1:45:37] mean
[1:45:38] he says when he morphed that means he
[1:45:40] changed himself
[1:45:42] he came down see
[1:45:45] i think we missed that part right
[1:45:47] he changed himself but remember
[1:45:49] god descended
[1:45:52] as he descended he was changing himself
[1:45:55] but he still was who he is harley see as
[1:45:58] he a morphe he changed mask he says now
[1:46:02] the greek word there means that
[1:46:04] something that could not be seen
[1:46:07] see he was eternal he couldn't be seen
[1:46:10] he was self-existent he couldn't be seen
[1:46:12] and even as god hallelujah he couldn't
[1:46:14] be seen but once he became hallelujah a
[1:46:16] man god he morphed himself into a man
[1:46:20] now he can be seen
[1:46:22] all the characteristics of god can be
[1:46:24] seen he said yet it's there and then it
[1:46:28] changed and the eye can catch it
[1:46:30] hallelujah so the only reason why church
[1:46:32] god began to mutate is so that we could
[1:46:35] catch him
[1:46:37] so that we could see his presence so he
[1:46:39] can see he's always with us
[1:46:42] he's a banner he's a shield he's my all
[1:46:44] in all he's my first he's my last he's
[1:46:47] with us
[1:46:49] see the whole changes of god is so we
[1:46:51] can see who god is
[1:46:59] church
[1:47:00] listen
[1:47:01] when you think about the attributes of
[1:47:03] god
[1:47:05] god had things shut up in him
[1:47:08] so what he began to do god said i want
[1:47:11] to be released
[1:47:13] i want to be released god said there's
[1:47:15] so much about me you don't know yet
[1:47:18] he said so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna
[1:47:20] let the devil run a little wild holly
[1:47:22] just so you can begin to know who i am
[1:47:25] and it's gonna look like it's some
[1:47:27] trouble he said no but it's the
[1:47:28] revealing of who i am
[1:47:30] hallelujah and as god began to reveal
[1:47:33] himself and uncover himself there were
[1:47:35] different levels of god hallelujah he
[1:47:38] was bringing to the people
[1:47:40] just like the scripture says he says
[1:47:42] abraham isaac and joseph they knew me as
[1:47:44] god almighty
[1:47:46] hallelujah he said but as jehovah they
[1:47:49] never knew me he's talking to moses now
[1:47:52] he's talking to moses and moses there's
[1:47:54] another level of who i am that abraham
[1:47:57] isaac and jacob didn't have a chance to
[1:47:59] experience yet but i'm still god
[1:48:01] almighty but now i'm going to show you
[1:48:03] that i'm jehovah
[1:48:05] hallelujah listen church as god almighty
[1:48:08] what was he doing hey man he was pushing
[1:48:11] abraham into his position of faith
[1:48:13] hallelujah as as god almighty hallelujah
[1:48:16] he was pushing isaac in his position of
[1:48:18] love harley
[1:48:19] as god almighty he was pushing jacob in
[1:48:21] his position of grace
[1:48:25] you know what i think we really miss
[1:48:27] what grace is
[1:48:31] we got faith yeah praise god whoa god
[1:48:33] did this
[1:48:34] we see the love lord i'm gonna lay my
[1:48:36] life down i love you but that grace
[1:48:39] preach
[1:48:41] that grace has us confused
[1:48:45] that grace has us messed up
[1:48:47] because we'll be looking why am i going
[1:48:49] through this
[1:48:52] and all it is is grace
[1:48:56] look what he did to jacob
[1:48:59] look what he did to jacob
[1:49:01] because god wanted to express his grace
[1:49:04] what did he do holly he caused friction
[1:49:06] in his house
[1:49:09] he lost his relationship with his
[1:49:11] brother
[1:49:13] he even had to lie to his prophet daddy
[1:49:16] all the friends in the streets probably
[1:49:17] talked about him because he didn't know
[1:49:19] how to hunt but that boy could cook a
[1:49:21] pot
[1:49:23] they probably call him little rainbow
[1:49:29] but all of that was the grace of god
[1:49:32] why look his mama was there if you don't
[1:49:35] remember anything else about his mama
[1:49:37] his mama helped him get over on his
[1:49:39] daddy
[1:49:42] your parents know how y'all do
[1:49:46] pull them girls aside you know you
[1:49:48] should be telling her no
[1:49:50] but what you do you want to be the good
[1:49:52] parent
[1:49:54] and then you make a statement like well
[1:49:55] you know how your dad is
[1:49:58] yeah you know how he is so you ought to
[1:50:00] stick with your guns
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:04] this ain't good parent bad parent
[1:50:06] because ultimately what's going on is
[1:50:08] what's best for the child
[1:50:10] hallelujah but look i'm gonna leave that
[1:50:12] alone
[1:50:13] but anyway you look hungry

[1:50:17] favoritism in the house holy if your
[1:50:19] child gets filled with the holy ghost
[1:50:21] that's all we want
[1:50:24] hey they know god that's all we want god
[1:50:27] to teach them and show them that it was
[1:50:29] all for their good
[1:50:30] hallelujah i told you the best ministry

[1:54:54] thousand
[1:54:56] there had to be a nation of israel
[1:55:00] and where did it come from it came out
[1:55:02] of all that confusion hallelujah
[1:55:04] what was it what it looked like four
[1:55:06] women fighting over one man it really
[1:55:08] was the grace of god it was the mutation
[1:55:11] of the spirit all right
[1:55:14] because you had the 12 times hallelujah
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:26] don't complain just say lord i don't
[1:55:29] know what you're doing but i'm ready
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:36] church
[1:55:37] grace is a mystery
[1:55:39] oh my
[1:55:40] i'm running out of time
[1:55:42] church
[1:55:44] look
[1:55:45] about 10 more minutes
[1:55:46] church look
[1:55:48] when you think about what god has done
[1:55:50] and how he does it do it in the grace of
[1:55:52] god listen the whole world has mutated
[1:55:56] under the spirit of fear and evil
[1:55:58] just like it was in the bible days
[1:56:01] god said look the whole sins and
[1:56:03] everything has come up to me and he said
[1:56:05] look the imagination of men is only evil
[1:56:09] they were under the influence of evil
[1:56:11] and they say you know what i'm sick of
[1:56:12] this i'm gonna kill everybody i'm going
[1:56:14] to kill all of it but then the bible
[1:56:16] says when you go over hallelujah and i
[1:56:18] think chapter 6 chapter 5 it says but
[1:56:20] noah found grace
[1:56:24] what was how did that grace come that
[1:56:26] grace came in the form of a message it's
[1:56:29] gonna rain
[1:56:32] so he had to preach that message as long
[1:56:34] as he stayed with that message he had
[1:56:35] the grace of god hallelujah but look
[1:56:38] what that grace did it started out with
[1:56:40] just mo with just noah working on a boat
[1:56:42] by himself working on a boat you know he
[1:56:45] had three boys he was a father hunter
[1:56:47] and a husband but he was working on that
[1:56:48] boat and you know he probably said his
[1:56:50] boys came and said hey dad you want to
[1:56:52] go play some catch he put all his tools
[1:56:54] down to come on run along
[1:56:56] now they out there throwing the ball
[1:56:59] he's all right boys that's never got to
[1:57:00] get back to this grace
[1:57:02] staying with the message on the boat on
[1:57:04] the boat on the boat and then they say
[1:57:06] hey dad you want to shoot some ball hey
[1:57:07] man he puts all the tools down he'd go
[1:57:09] around shoot some ball break their
[1:57:10] ankles you know what i mean they say dad
[1:57:12] i know you could play like that he said
[1:57:13] yeah man i'm the son of god i got hops
[1:57:16] hallelujah so you know he played with
[1:57:18] his boy the next thing you know he said
[1:57:19] that was a good game they said dad we
[1:57:20] sure enjoyed it now he's still working
[1:57:22] on the boat his boy's watching what's
[1:57:24] happening what's happening now they are
[1:57:26] personally experiencing the grace of god
[1:57:29] so they say hey dad let's play one more
[1:57:30] game so he goes back out there he breaks
[1:57:32] all the ankles they say okay boys that
[1:57:34] was good hey man i have 26 i win what
[1:57:36] y'all playing i have 21 or 26.
[1:57:38] y'all play 21 okay we play 26 where i'm
[1:57:41] from so anyway we playing 26. hey man so
[1:57:44] he didn't beat the 26. hey man tell the
[1:57:46] boys i got to get back to this boat and
[1:57:48] then look at each other say
[1:57:50] let's go help dan with this boat
[1:57:54] so now his influence and grace has
[1:57:56] gotten his boys without him saying the
[1:57:58] word just living it and now he got the
[1:58:00] boys on the on the boat and all of them
[1:58:01] working on the boat they experiencing
[1:58:03] the same grace hallelujah he didn't have

[2:00:38] will do
[2:00:41] he said it will comfort you
[2:00:43] he said it'll bring all things back to
[2:00:45] your remembrance

[2:01:22] bride praise god but listen church
[2:01:24] hallelujah now amen now you think about
[2:01:27] it church the the the dna of god
[2:01:31] and how god operates remember he always
[2:01:33] said he never said holy what it was he
[2:01:36] said the holy ghost would show you what
[2:01:37] it would do amen amen now put that back
[2:01:40] up sister now dna we think we say dna
[2:01:43] the bloodline this and that and all
[2:01:44] these things no
[2:01:46] dna what it does look he says what does
[2:01:49] dna do
[2:01:50] dna contains the instructions needed for
[2:01:53] the organism to develop
[2:01:56] and if we got god's dna
[2:01:59] there's something in you that instructs
[2:02:01] you how to live not only how to live but
[2:02:05] it instructs you on how to hallelujah
[2:02:09] survive
[2:02:11] got somebody
[2:02:14] whoa
[2:02:15] boy i got god's dna in me so you know
[2:02:18] what i am i'm a survivor
[2:02:21] [Applause]
[2:02:22] no matter what you say brother you going
[2:02:24] through something tough i'm a survivor
[2:02:28] you say you're going through something
[2:02:29] in your family with your children i'm a
[2:02:31] survivor
[2:02:33] why because i got god's dna in me
[2:02:37] i got the mutation of god's dna
[2:02:43] he says
[2:02:45] and reproduce hallelujah
[2:02:48] so it's not super saiyans not just with
[2:02:50] me for one trial it'll always reproduce
[2:02:54] for everything i need it for as long as
[2:02:56] i'm living
[2:03:04] as a father
[2:03:06] there's things in my dna
[2:03:09] that i passed down the key era
[2:03:18] there's things in me that she can't
[2:03:19] refuse
[2:03:21] because it's a part of my dna
[2:03:23] hallelujah
[2:03:25] patterns of a hair because of me
[2:03:28] patterns of her eyes because of me
[2:03:31] patterns of a skin tone because of me
[2:03:39] and you know when a child is around you
[2:03:41] for so much and so often they'll even
[2:03:44] begin to talk like you
[2:03:48] listen man you sound like your daddy
[2:03:53] hallelujah
[2:03:54] why what is it
[2:03:56] it's the dna of the father honey
[2:04:00] going down to the children amen look he
[2:04:02] says the functions of dna
[2:04:04] sequences catches now sequences must be
[2:04:07] converted
[2:04:10] so the only way you can get this message
[2:04:12] of the dna is for you to be converted
[2:04:17] so you really want to see god's dna
[2:04:19] inside of you it got to start with a
[2:04:21] conversion first
[2:04:23] hallelujah
[2:04:24] without a conversion you'll never be
[2:04:26] able to understand the message of his
[2:04:29] life inside of you
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:33] without conversion
[2:04:36] you won't develop right
[2:04:38] you won't be able to survive
[2:04:41] you'll never reproduce
[2:04:42] because there's no conversion
[2:04:45] he says look he said look secrets must
[2:04:47] be converted into
[2:04:49] messages
[2:04:50] that can be used to produce proteins
[2:04:53] [Music]
[2:04:54] where does protein go in the body
[2:04:57] protein hardly deals with the muscles
[2:05:01] hallelujah
[2:05:03] hardly that's what the whole world is
[2:05:04] trying to figure out to this day
[2:05:07] it was old life how do i keep my muscle
[2:05:11] protein
[2:05:14] without protein
[2:05:15] you're going to shrivel up
[2:05:17] you might have all the muscles there but
[2:05:20] it ain't nothing to excite those muscles
[2:05:22] so church we don't have good protein
[2:05:25] services
[2:05:30] service is full of substance
[2:05:33] good music hallelujah good worship amen
[2:05:37] good word honey we'll walk up out of
[2:05:39] here with our chest
[2:05:42] boy i feel like i was living 300 pounds
[2:05:44] a day
[2:05:46] [Applause]
[2:05:47] and you know the more you work it the
[2:05:49] stronger you get
[2:05:53] and see the thing about developing
[2:05:55] muscles you have to come to a place of
[2:05:57] failure
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:03] the muscles will never grow
[2:06:06] unless you get to a place where you are
[2:06:08] weak
[2:06:14] that's why they call it muscle failure
[2:06:16] you get muscle fade the protein hit
[2:06:18] those muscles it energizes those muscles
[2:06:20] and then you go back to the same weight
[2:06:22] and push it 10 more times
[2:06:25] on a different day
[2:06:30] so church we got god's dna inside of us
[2:06:33] we got a message inside of us that came
[2:06:36] straight from god
[2:06:38] listen it ain't brother brandon's
[2:06:39] message
[2:06:41] it comes from the dna of god it didn't
[2:06:43] come from kentucky it came from heaven
[2:06:50] so
[2:06:51] we understand how god mutated
[2:06:55] eternal
[2:06:58] talk to me terry
[2:07:00] eternal
[2:07:02] elohim
[2:07:04] god self-existed god elohim
[2:07:07] did he with the god holly
[2:07:10] and out of god came the logos
[2:07:12] and the logos created man
[2:07:16] so how do we mutate
[2:07:20] there you go brother
[2:07:23] hallelujah
[2:07:25] god brought it all to us
[2:07:27] so what are we doing we're bringing it
[2:07:29] all back to god
[2:07:31] so what do we do now we have the logos
[2:07:33] inside of us
[2:07:35] and the logo shows us that we are gods
[2:07:38] and from god hallelujah we go to elohim
[2:07:40] self-existing and from alex's elohim
[2:07:42] self-existence there will be a rapture
[2:07:45] that makes us eternal
[2:07:49] hallelujah
[2:07:51] we are the spiritual mutation of god
[2:08:01] come on musicians
[2:08:04] don't forget
[2:08:06] holy
[2:08:08] that we're not down here on a cakewalk
[2:08:11] amen
[2:08:13] there are going to be trials they're
[2:08:14] going to be tribulation
[2:08:16] all these things
[2:08:17] but in the midst of all that there's one
[2:08:19] thing i don't want you to forget
[2:08:22] don't forget
[2:08:24] that we're saved
[2:08:28] i think sometimes we go through so much
[2:08:30] we forget to enjoy
[2:08:32] that we're saved
[2:08:34] we forget to enjoy the spiritual
[2:08:37] mutation
[2:08:38] i can't be lost why because eternity is
[2:08:41] in me
[2:08:42] i can't be lost because hallelujah the
[2:08:45] self-existent one i ain't gonna serve
[2:08:46] nothing else but him
[2:08:48] hallelujah i can't be lost why because i
[2:08:51] have a god status holly i have the
[2:08:53] ability to control every circumstance
[2:08:58] hallelujah
[2:08:59] and look he said uh
[2:09:02] i think this might be in the message why
[2:09:04] christ speak
[2:09:06] but
[2:09:06] one of the mess no this is in um god
[2:09:09] proven this word
[2:09:11] he said joseph did everything god told
[2:09:14] him to do
[2:09:15] i mean joshua
[2:09:17] joshua did everything god told me to do
[2:09:19] he told me strong and very courageous
[2:09:21] you know i just love dramatizing us
[2:09:23] hallelujah
[2:09:25] but you know what god walked to him
[2:09:26] sister bernice he told me say you know
[2:09:27] what
[2:09:28] nobody be able to stand before you
[2:09:31] everywhere you go
[2:09:32] souls of your feet have already given it
[2:09:34] to you for a possession
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:36] and you know he'd go to a battle he
[2:09:38] looked
[2:09:39] he may be outnumbered
[2:09:41] but all he could think about was what
[2:09:42] god told him
[2:09:45] and he ain't congregating with his
[2:09:46] people what y'all think what this
[2:09:48] what y'all
[2:09:55] he said it's time to fight
[2:09:58] because there's nothing to be able to
[2:09:59] stand before me
[2:10:01] every time he went to battle hallelujah
[2:10:03] he was the leader ah i go out there and
[2:10:05] fight
[2:10:07] one more time y'all
[2:10:10] church
[2:10:11] holy but can you imagine you go out to
[2:10:13] fight ai and he lose the battle
[2:10:16] he said
[2:10:18] uh
[2:10:20] i ain't supposed to lose
[2:10:26] that's not a part of god that's not a
[2:10:28] part of my dna i ain't supposed to lose
[2:10:31] see that's the problem some of you got
[2:10:33] used to losing you're looking at your
[2:10:35] situation well maybe it ain't god's will
[2:10:37] how you know that stay the course
[2:10:40] stay the course and believe the lord
[2:10:42] this ain't the time to give up we've
[2:10:44] come too far to turn around
[2:10:50] i like the way travis green said
[2:10:51] hallelujah when he was preaching when he
[2:10:53] was singing the hill hallelujah when he
[2:10:55] got to the part telling his testimony he
[2:10:57] said his wife hallelujah was having a
[2:10:59] baby premature and the doctor told her
[2:11:02] say well we're going to take the baby
[2:11:04] and y'all might as well just give up and
[2:11:05] try again travis say we trust god too
[2:11:08] much to
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:17] we trust god too much to give up
[2:11:20] holy
[2:11:21] church you look at joshua he went there
[2:11:23] hey as he fought ai he said it got to be
[2:11:25] a problem there got to be something
[2:11:26] wrong hallelujah he found aitkin
[2:11:28] hollywood aiken had the battles on the
[2:11:30] garments and all this stuff he killed
[2:11:32] aiken
[2:11:33] his wife his children his uncles his
[2:11:35] brothers his cousins his dog his cake
[2:11:38] killed everything that would reflect
[2:11:40] that unbelievable
[2:11:42] and then
[2:11:44] he went back and fought the same people
[2:11:47] the same people that had defeated him he
[2:11:49] went back and fought those same people
[2:11:51] and gather the people say hey we're
[2:11:53] going to go fight ai again and the old
[2:11:55] church probably look around
[2:11:57] uh uh general joshua you sure you want
[2:11:59] to do that we just lost about 32 000
[2:12:02] died you said ah
[2:12:11] why
[2:12:12] because he was living by the promise of
[2:12:14] the father
[2:12:17] he was living by that spiritual mutation
[2:12:20] hallelujah and he couldn't lose
[2:12:23] from that point did he lose
[2:12:26] he was so confident one day he was
[2:12:28] praying
[2:12:29] and somebody stood before him glistering
[2:12:31] and shining and joshua got up and say
[2:12:34] look at me
[2:12:37] nothing will be able to stand before me
[2:12:39] and everywhere i go god is already given
[2:12:42] to me
[2:12:42] now who are you
[2:12:44] are you for us or against us
[2:12:49] hallelujah
[2:12:51] remember church he wasn't worried
[2:12:53] because paul and even brother branham
[2:12:54] said if an angel said anything different
[2:12:56] from us hallelujah let them be a curse
[2:12:59] now joshua's looking at an angel he's
[2:13:01] saying identify yourself are you gonna
[2:13:03] die
[2:13:08] hallelujah they already had record
[2:13:11] hallelujah of the saints of god meeting
[2:13:13] angels jacob already had put one in the
[2:13:16] figure four
[2:13:18] so i ain't turning you loose do you
[2:13:20] bless me
[2:13:23] and you think joshua's gonna be afraid
[2:13:25] childhood like no identify yourself and
[2:13:27] you don't we won't rumble in this place
[2:13:30] he said i'm the captain of the lords
[2:13:33] oh god is with me church
[2:13:38] see the dna of god
[2:13:40] always comes and makes the message known
[2:13:45] hallelujah
[2:13:46] so church this is not a time to be
[2:13:47] afraid this is not a time to be weary
[2:13:49] but this is a time to just keep moving
[2:13:52] forward
[2:13:53] in the name of jesus christ
[2:13:55] let's pray let's pray and i'll get out

[2:23:08] thank god for the word that was preached
[2:23:11] amen to our hearts i
[2:23:13] just felt that brother diggs just
[2:23:15] did a wonderful job of taking us back to
[2:23:18] last week
[2:23:20] and uh and i can tell you already he's
[2:23:22] already stepped into next week
[2:23:25] so i'm sitting here listening and i'm
[2:23:26] just looking at the scriptures i say
[2:23:28] lord look at you just you're just a
[2:23:30] mighty god and
[2:23:32] so much that is going on and
[2:23:34] talking to
[2:23:35] brother quentin a little early this week
[2:23:37] and
[2:23:38] we're just saying how we just see god
[2:23:39] doing things and how they're coming into
[2:23:41] the art
[2:23:42] two by two god just sending them
[2:23:44] you know you know sometimes we don't
[2:23:46] recognize what god is doing but god is
[2:23:48] moving right in the midst
[2:23:50] sometimes that trouble that instruct the
[2:23:52] family and you think it's just trouble
[2:23:54] no it's grace
[2:23:56] it's grace that that's how god get
[2:23:58] people's attention
[2:24:01] amen get them to a place where they
[2:24:03] realize that they can't do nothing
[2:24:05] without god
[2:24:07] hallelujah we need grace like that
[2:24:11] amen but i just i just see god moving i
[2:24:15] i feel him moving
[2:24:17] i hear him moving
[2:24:19] i hear the rustle in the mulberry tree
[2:24:22] i know the move is on
[2:24:26] my god let's keep our eyes focused say
[2:24:28] man on what god is doing and i just love
[2:24:31] the way he typed that with this
[2:24:33] this
[2:24:35] plan or
[2:24:36] pandemonic that's what i like to call it
[2:24:39] you know this covet thing that kind of
[2:24:41] came and see our prophet already told us
[2:24:43] that there would be germ warfare
[2:24:46] prophet already said that so we can't
[2:24:47] stop these things from happening i was
[2:24:49] telling somebody earlier this week say
[2:24:51] the world not changing you can't wait
[2:24:53] for it to go back to what it used to be
[2:24:55] that's not that's not happening
[2:24:57] right you're gonna have to make some
[2:24:58] adjustments
[2:25:00] praise the lord right and and oh god i'm
[2:25:03] just just trying to get people to see
[2:25:05] that you know there's a lot here that
[2:25:07] that that is happening but but i think
[2:25:09] the primary thing is that
[2:25:10] god is also mutated
[2:25:15] god is doing something
[2:25:17] amen he stepped it down i couldn't help
[2:25:19] but think about brother quaker preaching
[2:25:21] about you know if you went there to fpl
[2:25:24] you couldn't take your your cell phone
[2:25:26] charger and plug it into one of the hey
[2:25:28] man it's not even a transformer just the
[2:25:30] power plant the grid you can't go plug
[2:25:33] into the power grid as soon as you got
[2:25:35] that close to it you'd be sad but but
[2:25:38] that power has to step down
[2:25:40] [Music]
[2:25:43] from the grid to a transformer
[2:25:46] and you can't touch the transformer
[2:25:47] either they got to step it down
[2:25:51] come on somebody
[2:25:52] they gotta bring it all the way down
[2:25:54] until it's just a plug
[2:25:56] where you can put something in and get a
[2:25:58] charge
[2:26:00] hallelujah but it's all coming from the
[2:26:02] same place
[2:26:03] [Applause]
[2:26:05] you couldn't understand god you couldn't
[2:26:08] figure god out until he stepped it down
[2:26:13] you begin to see him inside your own
[2:26:15] life
[2:26:16] my what a message brother
[2:26:19] i was just blessed glory to god brother
[2:26:23] hallelujah god is good god is good i'm
[2:26:26] i'm so happy that brother dicks came a
[2:26:29] man our way

[2:26:39] i mean his daughter will be traveling

[2:26:49] it all worked out for for them to come
[2:26:51] we had so much
[2:26:52] uh a trouble i i have to say that it
[2:26:55] seemed like the devil was fighting it
[2:26:56] because i i had weekends all mixed up
[2:26:59] and you know family come and he changed
[2:27:01] the ticket twice
[2:27:03] and i said lord that's my fault brother
[2:27:06] i just i just had the wrong thing in my
[2:27:08] head but god worked it all out you know
[2:27:10] and and i see why god has something that
[2:27:12] he wanted to get to us and
[2:27:14] amen the message has been delivered
[2:27:17] not only has the message been delivered
[2:27:19] you carry in
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:22] the message
[2:27:23] it's actually in the mutation
[2:27:27] in both definitions there was a message
[2:27:29] in the dna and there's a message in the
[2:27:32] mutation
[2:27:34] so you're carrying the message
[2:27:36] even if you don't want to carry it
[2:27:38] and it's going to reproduce
