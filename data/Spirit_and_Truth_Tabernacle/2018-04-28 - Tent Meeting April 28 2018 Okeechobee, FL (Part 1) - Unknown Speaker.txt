[Music] god bless your sense plays alone let's turn our Bibles to Psalms praise the Lord the psalmist says God be merciful unto us and bless us cause his face to shine upon us that that way make known on the earth by singing among all nations let the people praise the old law that all the people praise them only the nation's be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge the people righteously and

ends of the earth soccer [Music] I'll show this to the Lord we ask that you kind of know about each and every vessel here about the users without lifting up their killed father bless you in every way it's not like you know therefore we have come for delivery one but you are worth they love you we praise really thank you what we ask of God that you bless you want the bird as it goes for you may have been hard to see the resources to Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] Oh Oh Oh [Applause] [Applause] Oh Oh [Music] Oh [Applause] right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's people walking by and driving by Andy Jesus right 23:16 oh yeah regard to love the world that He gave His only begotten Son why so may you may may or may not know I'm again here and we've have sound bibles and there was a gentleman at the Palm Beach County Fair a couple years ago and that gentleman came by his loss it looked like he was wondering he had no no pumps no purpose so I said no him I said you know what's happening because God gave me a word of wisdom that says this gentleman is having a problem his future is going to be muddled with disaster so he came up to my booth and he was the beer in hand and tears coming down and I said when we started talking he lost his best friend he felt lost I said you know what I'm going to introduce you to you that's true when I introduce you to Jesus because Jesus loved you so much that he died for you I am at the scriptural verse they used they discussed with him was found in John chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 you see Jesus says I didn't come in the world to condemn the world you see he thought get down he found everything crashing down upon him he felt lost and abandoned but what happened Jesus came to save the walk right 19:10 for the Son of Man is come to seek and the safe which was what is lost to me was how to save him not a messiah spending eternity in the lake of fire after the great white throne judgment pagination that right after the tribulation and that to a child to go out there and win souls I see there was a gentleman who was on death row and Chad and he was asking around he said to the fellow prison how do I get to him you know nobody knew so then they said to prison guards nobody know it but he was working in honor so then he went to the prison staff they didn't know but a group of idiots went in there they gave him the answer and they said to us you there's a wonderful plan right he cares for you he died for you he wants to repair that relationship with you because it was broken by sin because she won't sit at lunch with 43 we have for the wages of sin is death Romans Romans 8:1 for therefore there's no condemnation those are questions okay so we have to go out there and win slams because we can't take can we take this one another cell phone we can't take with us our credit cards or a bank statements our high Ras our gold or silver we can only take with us oils because the apex of all Christian endeavor is to place the two of us orphans ground in order that the Lamb that was slain may receive the reward of his suffering he suffered from everybody and God gave us the Great Commission which we can work together like this you know we're a team what are we to do go out there and spread the good news we have to do that because we're in the end times and Jesus may come because of the tween we may be changed caught up to meet so you never be in the word the dead in Christ shall rise first then we who remain some two are and we have to take Swoopes with us and that's the whole point taking songs going out there and spreading that this is the God to watch the dying look you say I can't you can't yeah that's Satan I rebuke Satan leading you to believe you can do that right because remember 120 nampara what did Jesus say he shall receive power stay there stay there and wait wait wait wait wait on God is always a producer of good things it's when we don'twe don't God what happens live Abraham and Ishmael we see today the effects of Abraham as he ran away he was actually April and survived yeah we see that happening today in the Middle East equations over there because of what rushing God we don't rush God we long suffer because you know what good things happen to those who wait on the Lord that is very much so officially people who lead by here West Palm Beach I saw some from Sarasota what's your mission souls and that's what we didn't do we go out there and we gave out ready for this 93 million Testaments I tell everybody if you if you buy a box of Gideon Testaments that I have I'll go out with hooded Souls if my wife or you should tell you one action actually that time that pastor pastor Jack we're at the rubbage County Fair going up there so wedding if I can do it because he that is in you is greater the he's the work first one for before Deborah then who is in you go honk attention that's Hebrew wouldn't you tell from the completed you you can't tell him this knows he's here I just got rabbi if I can do it you can do it because that same Jesus that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is in oxide deposited in us there's Holy Spirit to empower us to win smooth because God's gonna deposit if we surrender wrong to him this is the great awakened that preaching and other churches I've been preached on Nautilus opinion-based one another churches might listen to concept and that's his nature and he will communicate with his nature that even provides them enough if we willingly surrender to him and in order to be on fire for Jesus we kind of yield we have the yield is you know what do we do what's gonna we're gonna be filled with love that's good isn't it your way peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and something better how many people like fear like their what is fear false evidence appears real I like joy if I believe I'm going to be delivered whatever my trial whatever every circumstance what you guys say in James chapter one gets in her career choice my brother ladies good job to me

can happen to any of them my test of my op much like that a fella in the scripture dead that Good Samaritan started out real well running this race with everything that was in me but along the way something happened along the way of soldier got wounded and the devil crapine those two robbers came in and stole my joy and stole my testimony but I'm reminded of a song I'd like to always see after between [Applause] since your feedback or ought to speak and I'm just so late Amen because let me tell you Satan decides to destroy each and every one of them he is angry he'll want to see the wheel in the plan of God coming to fruition so he's always constantly throwing got some discrepancy in different things that trying to take us off of our courts God used to say you can't look to the man to the left those are mad - right there you gotta keep your eye on that brush and British military Oh war they would have a meet and I wanna come up and hold a frame and then he would carry a flag and as

yeah it is energy being released into the air we can take that energy source [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] I'm just gonna give a little short version it's a long testimony but I go peepee on it just to show you the goodness of God and just to encourage you that whatever you go regardless of what it is we start with God yet we start with God that's right I guess I could say I was maybe about two years ago I'm a standard doctor a hematologist my blood work was crazy and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me so I was going back and forth they were running all kinds of tests all kinds of tests but not figure out what what was wrong it's just that where your immune system is fighting something but can't find it don't know what it is and I seen this man for like every week for almost a year and January service we had lumineer service I remember standing in the church and I said you know god I'm so sick of it all there's doctors appointments I said I'm done I'm just done I'm not going back anymore I'm finished that was January of last year and I didn't go back for violence six months or so pass by and then come June I noticed along coming up in the top of my head so I just kind of ignored it after a while know what this is I'm just two to three weeks has died and it just kept getting bigger and bigger then I kind of got a little nervous I so I said well I won't take a picture of it and I'm gonna send it to my sister who's the doctor and I'm going to see what she's saying she think I should do so I took a picture of it and I sent it to my sister she lived on Cleveland she said well you should go to the doctor get that checked out I just said I'm not going that doctor's appointment I went hit and win anyway my primary doctor sent me to a dermatologist dermatologist cut a slice of it and put a couple of sniffs sutures and instead took that guy so he told me I'll call you back in about a week the results should be ready a week went by and I'm here for them you know and you know during that time of waiting is amiss you know especially that we come by and you still don't get fried you know the devil just sitting on your shoulder you know I'll you know you won't hide you know as this as that is this ain't called you back yet and when I tell you during that time when I was waiting I have to say my pastor was preaching face yeah every service it was just giving me more and more strength and more and more courage to not worry right now don't be afraid don't worry just leave it to God take you to God in prayer and leave it there right but you know every day 24 hours a day the devil seem right fear me and let me tell you is them it's the worst battle I ever had to fight my guests fighting spear yeah fear every day every day I wake up every hour I'm thinking about it and trying to save it I you know it's finally about seven o'clock one night the doctor called I said well this can't be good seven o'clock attract a doctor right right it's gonna be good call me he said well we saved it for a second opinion that's why it took so long to come back instead it came back Hansen's I said really okay except what kind of cancer you say this
