schoolhouse of the lord amen we thank god um for all that he is doing this uh you can do uh grateful for the things he's done display that softly um for those that are streaming we um realize that there is an issue there and for some reason it's just not stable just keeps dropping and we're not 100 sure what is the cause of that problem but um we ask that you do try to bear with us and uh if it doesn't work out we'll we'll be recording here uh anyway and and we'll put the we always put it up on on youtube so you'll be able to to get to it but we do want you to be a part of the service amen you you are a part of this journey amen with us so we we we thank god for you but just just bear with us we are doing all we can to ensure that uh the stream works and i do know that we are sharing this facility with another church and i'm not sure if they're also streaming and sometimes the bandwidth becomes a problem uh like that so we have to kind of work with the school on things like that but god knows all things amen amen i was telling the brothers i feel like the lord is making us very uncomfortable so that we don't feel like we need to praise the lord and and sometime we have to put some uh fasting and prayer with what we're trying to do and uh so we we want to encourage the church be a part of amen the the prayer services as you can i was blessed this morning as i pulled up hey man sister dixon was getting out of the car at nine o'clock and i want to want to put emphasis since the dixon was getting out of okay yeah yeah i heard it sticks was getting out of her car sitting in the parking lot waiting to see who was coming who almost here praise the lord and you know that means a lot you know uh those pillows that you're sitting on trying to make it look comfortable for you years ago god gave sister dixon the vision to put those pillars together so that you could use them for prayer [Music] but they still serve a dual purpose right and so we we thank god for her and amen we just appreciate her and uh so we just want to encourage the church let's all just try to join in together do all we can amen for this season so good to have brother quaker home praise the lord return from bearing his father and uh we're just we're just very very happy you know that that he made it back safely got a chance to do some ministry over there as well and and i will certainly uh make room for him amen within the next couple weeks just to kind of share amen with us all that the lord was doing so but we appreciate having him amen back home with us praise the lord um i want to uh have a a uh a little something here that i feel is very significant um new life is uh coming into our midst a new life and uh and i don't think it's by accident or by chance that uh this is happening now because i think it's i think it's got something to do with you know just us as a church you know and and i'm on the expectation but i want to ask amen uh first before i do that that song um uh uh sister amanda song what a friend we have in jesus lord had that song in my spirit all week long and uh yesterday we were we went to uh orlando we had to bury a man the the son of brother ray and sister bethany they had a son he was born prematurely his name was josiah he lived for nine days and uh and they had to bury him on yesterday so they asked me to sing a song amen for the for the service and and i had that in my spirit what a friend we have in jesus all our sins and griefs to bear what a privilege it is to carry everything to god in prayer and as i was thinking on that you know the uh the the that song was birthed because a man went through some tremendous trials and uh and what had happened this this man had found the love of his life and he says i'm gonna marry this lady and uh he you know they set their date to get married and uh uh just before the wedding i want to say days a week before the wedding somehow an accident occurred and this lady died so you know you can imagine the grief that he was going through and what he was feeling and probably thought he'd never love again and then somebody else came into his life and he fell in love again and he engaged this woman's gonna marry her and weeks before days before another accident occurs and she dies i believe it was after this moment the man began to think it's just something about the relationship that people back then had with god versus the relationship we have with god now but after this man had this particular trial the words came what a friend we have in jesus all our sins and griefs to bear what a privilege it is to carry everything to god in prayer hallelujah so the song was birthed out of a tremendous trial amen that he went through trials that he went through and i believe uh you know god uses things like that for his glory and i think even right now as we are i don't want to call it a trial i just call it a transition right but god is using it all for his glory i am sure of that but uh new life is coming into our midst uh through the union of brother josue and sister amanda praise the lord [Applause] how we thank the lord for them and you all know uh just a portion of sister amanda's testimony and uh how the enemy was attacking her with cancer a couple different times but god has brought healing to her body praise god and i was telling them that when you see uh god bringing healing like that there's a there's a purpose and a reason for this child to come forth a satan was fighting even before the child was conceived so there's a purpose and reason for the child to come forth and and then just ask this brother jack would you mind just praying over us and praying over the pregnancy uh that god would just keep us during this time so i said we sure will and i was going to invite them to come up at this time and we want to pray over them as a couple it's okay thank you so much i'm telling you joseph is ready and i appreciate you joseph amen you all just by your heads just stand right here both of you stand yeah there you go praise the lord father god we come first of all thank you for this conception we know god that the enemy was fighting uh time and time again to lord try to prevent this from happening but god you have a greater purpose thank you for your healing and sister amanda's body lord and just allowed her to get to this point lord that she could conceive this child father we know that you're already here uh in the beginning we trust that you would also be in the middle of the process and she carries the baby to full term we're claiming that there will be no issues none out of the ordinary and father we believe that you'll be at the end of the process when the child is delivered and comes into this world god give them lord all that they need to create a home in an environment that a child would be loved be raised in a christian atmosphere and i pray god that you just watch over them father the family as they stand together through this time and lord just ask that you would be with them we thank you for new life coming forth at a time like this we believe you're in it father we thank you for what you're doing in our midst and father may this just be the beginning of other couples that will also experience new life we claim it now in jesus name amen amen god bless you [Music] my heart [Music] his gratefulness [Music] [Music] grateful grateful grateful great but grateful grateful great for grace gratefulness hallelujah it's flowing from our hearts a grateful great say yay [Music] lift your voice and say grateful [Music] floating from my heart come on one more time grateful [Music] hallelujahs [Music] yeah yeah yeah [Music] his grateful man amen come on put those hands together for the lord jesus [Applause] amen amen praise god y'all stand with me let's read a scripture so good to see everybody in the house of the lord man on this morning uh i have been a part of a little group thank you musicians thank you um we want to thank the lord for this keyboard we we had to we're putting the other one in storage because it's a very expensive keyboard and we have to kind of move this around you know uh pretty much every week so we got a less expensive to play and uh so we think we got thank god for providing us for that and then also the the drums a little easier for us the electric drums a little easier for us to kind of put up and put down break down uh at the end of the weekend so thank god for providing that as well so the lord is the lord is good amen and see i i i might as well just release this while uh you know sometimes i watch little concerts and stuff like that and i see man they they'd be on stage with dude dramas seen dude dramas i've seen do bass players i've seen dude everything i say lord bless us but we can do doom amen so uh we got everything under control but but i've been a part of this little um uh group studying amen the book of revelation and uh in the mornings um usually seven days a week eight o'clock in the morning i'm getting on a call when i can make it sometimes i'm asked to teach and uh a lot of times i'm there listening to others and i am truly uh blessed by uh many of the things that i that i that i hear and uh so i'm taking us to the book of revelation five today uh just a little something that i was looking at while i was teaching and then i say i think i want to take this one little statement and go into a different direction with if i can and uh uh you know we'll just see what the lord does so i know as soon as you say turn to the book revelation people like oh my that's getting ready to be deep well maybe uh but it's for you amen and and i trust that the lord would just help us amen and just kind of sort through it uh here revelation uh i'm sorry revelation six amen that's where i want to read from revelation six verse nine amen revelation 6 and verse 9. uh let's just start reading there and it says and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held now just so that you are clear this scripture is speaking specifically about the jews amen is speaking speaking specifically about the jews and let me also just add well let me just read so they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth so these people looking for revenge uh and verse 11 says and white robes this is the part that's uh that's that that that blesses me and i pray to be a blessing to you this is speaking about the jews white roads were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right amen so that's uh all we want to read let's just have a word of prayer uh father we thank you for the reading of the word we also thank you for a prophet that has brought to us amen revelation so that we can understand what we read how we appreciate it we don't have to be afraid god we have clarity uh and uh so lord we just we we're we're grateful for uh these things and pray that you just open up our understanding and father i also want to just uh pray for the stream god we know that you're even involved with technology there's saints that are depending on that string and god we actually just work all things out you know all the details so god we just pray and we release it uh to you exit to it just sort through all the details and allow the saints to be able to enter in right where they are and receive the word of god uh satan we blind you and all of your attack and uh we just released the holy spirit to have its way thank you for allowing us to gather this place again this day it's in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated i am battling a man uh a little head cold uh so you all just bear with me here today uh just got a little stuffy nose uh but but just just battling that and and and it's it's okay i mean coles have been around for years and uh so as soon as you say something like that people always think covet but i ain't claiming covet i said it's a head coal and uh that's we're just gonna get through it uh so here i want to use the title today accepting the pardon and grace of the living word amen accepting the partnering grace of the living word amen thank you jesus i'm going to just start reading a man from um a uh a message here called the message of grace and um brother brandon makes some statements here because we're we're talking about accepting the pardoning grace the partnering grace of the living word and uh so he he gives us a a statement uh here in this message of the message of grace it says grace is old grace is old says grace is as old as the world is and i love this amen grace is old grace is as old as the world is so as grace was first shown to the human race when uh we had the beginning of the human race hallelujah when the human race was first created in the garden of eden on that dark morning when that little woman had stepped across the separating line so he's going taking us back to genesis and we can see uh in this as he gives us you know just just uh just like a little vision of it we see uh eve stepping across the separating line we see her partaking of this tree of knowledge good and evil right and as she uh partakes of this this tree of knowledge uh good and evil she steps across the separating line so he says this he says uh on that dark morning when that little woman had stepped across the separating line and had gone against god's commandments and enticed her husband to do the same thing then the law was broken right and the law was the day you eat thereof the date that day you die right so this was the law so so when they when they when she partook of it then she introduced it to her husband uh this is when she crossed the line hallelujah hallelujah now let's go on a little further he says um uh the law must have a penalty or it isn't no law the law was the day you eat there that day you shall surely die remember the first judgment seat what that was upon the earth it was in the garden of eden and the last judgment seat will be upon the earth at the end time will be the white throne judgment all right says but when jehovah come down i could imagine there was even there wasn't even a star look at how he describes this there wasn't even a star to shine it was so dark in that little that light little garden that once was because sin had blotted it out had had taken the light from among them you know and and i want you to go a little further than just looking at what happened to to adam and eve but look at your own life hallelujah look at amen maybe some things that that we're not uh uh we're not we're not uh uh we'd be ashamed of let's put it that way if we had to tell the public what we did we'd be ashamed we had crossed a separating line hallelujah but the reason that you're sitting in the place that you're sitting this morning because somehow grace stepped in glory to god amen grace stepped in sometimes amen we found ourselves in amen and very dangerous situation i heard a brother this week talk about how he had many gun barrels pointed in his face amen but he lived to tell about it it's because grace stepped in when you think about maybe that accident that you could have had and lost your life hallelujah was nothing you did but grace stepped in grace is what delivered you grace is what sets you free hallelujah sometimes we don't realize that even if we're not serving god the way that we're supposed to serve god we don't realize how the grace of god is still protecting us the grace of god is still keeping us hallelujah i thank god for grace glory hallelujah amen here you know the prophet goes on and says uh uh uh uh because sin had blotted it out and taken the light from among them that's what's the matter with the church today that's what's the matter with the people today sin has blotted out the light of the living god to show that christ is still the same yesterday today and forever and he lives to save the uttermost uh to heal the lowest sick person hallelujah you know sometimes that's what happens with folk when they kind of come to church and then leave church and they back in church and all that the reason that we have an unstable life because we haven't recognized the grace of god to us right hallelujah and i'm gonna tell you when you truly recognize god's grace it caused you to want to serve him a little bit more it caused you to love him a little bit more amen but i pray this morning that the light will come on in somebody he goes on he says this oh how it was terrible that morning darkness hanging in the garden uh he says i'll imagine fog a black sackcloth i'd imagine every every leaf never moved says there was no wind stirring it was darkness and terrible because sin had blotted it out and think about it when we're in a life of sin amen we can't feel the move of god we can't feel the spirit of god we can't feel these things because sin blots it out but when we get sin corrected then you start feeling the spirit of god all over again says there came jehovah down like a roar of thunder walking through the garden crying adam where are thou notice adam didn't go looking for god but god came looking for him and there's many of us glory to god that are sitting here this morning it's not because we started looking for god but it's because god came looking for us and i'm gonna tell you when god start looking for you ain't a place you can hide on this earth hallelujah amen the best thing you can do is just surrender to his will glory hallelujah hallelujah he says adam where now that's when adam realized he was naked and had sinned before god he hid himself and tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work god killed some sheep took the skins and showed that something had to die to cover sin right joining church will never cover sin no dry out confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of god to cover sin three things sorrow repentance and the grace of god get that now amen you got to be sorry for what you've done when you're really sorry for it you don't go back out there to keep doing it all over again but god i'm stopping right here i'm i'm placing my steak down and i'm stopping this life of sin and i repent because i realize that these things displease you right so it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of god to cover sin for the blood of jesus christ the one that god killed at calvary to cover sin and let me go on a little further in this message of grace it says there in the garden that morning when sin was so black jehovah came in there stood this couple standing condemned adam and eve there would be no more human race think about it now they had to die do you realize oh my just get the picture in your mind after eve did what she did and then adam got involved and now jehovah comes down and they look now you're not now realize hallelujah in order for us to get here we all had to come through adam and eve oh my i want you to get that in order for us to be here to praise god the way that we're worshiping right now we had to come through adam and eve but here they are standing in a condemned state standing in in a place where they have crossed the line and now death has to enter in oh hallelujah but the grace of god intervened over on their behalf which allowed us to be here as expressions of god we're here by grace we're here by grace we live by grace hallelujah look at this go on let's go and he says says there would be no human race they had to die death on the human race give the world back to the wild beasts and there had been no human race but in the darkness of our oh glory to god in the time when all hopes was gone grace come pouring through thank you jesus said i'll give you a savior messiah oh it's a wonderful how god could ever do it god's amazing grace in the garden of eden that give them the promise of a just one who would come through the woman the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head the guilty one and his head shall bruise her heel to show there be an affliction to the church but he promised a triumph i like that church yeah it's gonna be an affliction but it's also gonna be a triumph oh we're gonna have some trials but we're gonna have some victories amen hallelujah glory to god you gotta have some testimony to share when you get on the other side amen don't let the children of israel tell everything you got to have something to say glory to god amen look look he says this says uh uh but he promised a tribe what provided a savior what provided a savior grace let's go a little further he says what could the uh what could they show to merit grace what could they show to do it the the army expression excuse it i only want to make it from my poopy here to make a point passing the book adam said the woman you you give me did it the woman said the serpent began me one laying it to another there was no hopes for them but god provided grace and it come breaking through and he said but i make a way somehow i'll save you regardless i am so happy that god saved me regardless you ought to just take a trip down memory lane some of the stuff that you got yourself into god still saved you regardless wasn't even looking at all them things grace is greater than that oh they have a song grace grace god's grace a grace that is greater than all our sins i thank god for this grace let's go on let's go and it says god provided grace uh it come breaking through and he said but i'll make a way somehow i'll save you regardless you've done wrong you've trespassed by laws you uh uh and my laws will have to be judgment from my laws will have to be executed therefore there'll be there have to be death because i've said death hallelujah so but but but what what we get from that is that god intervened and they didn't die immediately it took years before actually death settled in hallelujah they didn't die immediately but but it was god's grace that changed the situation you know grace i was looking at this uh from the the luminous software that i use sometimes they have some fun facts about grace and they say what is grace grace is god's mercy toward us even though we don't deserve it see adam and eve didn't deserve it right they they broke they broke the law there had to be a punishment for breaking that law and they didn't deserve but god gave it to him anyway god gave it to him regardless and i want you to think it wasn't just adam and eve broke the law we broke the law we broke god's law but god still gives grace regardless here's another one uh where in the bible did grace begin and here in the luminous software they say from the very beginning with adam and eve that's where grace began hallelujah god mercy towards us even though we don't deserve it it began in the garden of eden with adam and eve it says there is the evidence of god's grace says who gives grace god is the one that gives grace amen when do we when do we when do we receive god's grace when we repent of our sins and turn to him in faith we can receive grace hallelujah amen and here's here's a another one how do we receive god's grace is by putting our faith in the lord jesus christ because he was god's grace and here's the last one that i love it says why does god give grace why and they're answering the luminous software because it's part of its nature i like that that that's that tells me there's an attribute in god an attribute called grace and there takes certain circumstances in certain situations before that attribute is actually expressed and i'm so glad that he found me where i was and he expressed the attribute of grace i've accepted the pardon and grace of the living word i want to just pick up a scripture here in ephesians 2. i'm just blessed by this this thought we thank god for grace ephesians 2 verse 1. let's just read this oh glory to god amen the bible says in you hath he quickened amen who were dead in trespasses and sins now brother smiley came up here this morning and opened the service in prayer and and when he in his prayer he quoted one of the verses right out of this scripture i said ain't god good uh another thing that happened uh i was at home i guess it was friday night and and you know i was thinking about you know coming out of this fifth seal here and um and my daughter approached my daughter sarah approached me saying you know she had some questions from some lady on the job that sent her this video to watch about the seal being broken and i said oh so these people out here studying the seals i say all right well we need to look at this then it was a confirmation to me that we need to go in this direction because there's a lot of people confused out there oh my goodness oh lord just let me let me stay with they they they they got the vaccine as the mark of the beast that ain't true y'all i just have to tell you that ain't true that that is not true i'm not telling you got to take the vaccine i say that but i'm telling it's not the mark of the beast i am telling you that that anybody tell you that they are absolutely wrong brother branham didn't teach that hallelujah hallelujah hey man it's your choice what you do but don't don't don't don't say i ain't taking it because the mark of the beast don't say that please that's that's that's off the word all right let me keep going amen says and you have the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the courses of this world that see you got to see yourself in the scripture amen according to the prince of the power of the air my the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past that mean i used to hang with these people oh come on somebody right i mean that that that's our old saying they say the places i used to go i don't go no more the things i used to do i don't do no more the people i used to hang with i don't hang with them anymore something happens when you come in contact and you begin to have a relationship with jesus christ it changes your associations it changes amen who you want to hang around there's a certain atmosphere that's come around christians and that's why i want to be around christians glory to god i don't need nobody pulling me back into what god delivered me from amen and i ain't going down to try to get when i'm saved you understand what i'm saying i mean you you know you used to hang on the corner glory to god god delivered you from that corner but you say i'm going out here to witness to the boys to try to get them saved who came down there witness to you no that's a setup from the enemy they get you wrapped right back up into that thing like the young lady that that got delivered from dancing right she got delivered from dancing and she knew god had set her free right and see the dance happened on friday night and church happened on friday night the girl even had a bible in her hand and she passed by the dance on the way to church and she heard just one of them old tombs come on glory to god i mean we live in a day now where when you're going to a restaurant you'll hear all the tunes you hear the tunes from every generation my mama hear the tools from hell generation i hear the tools from my generation my kids are here to choose to that generation right i mean it just it's a conglomeration of sin but here the girl was passing by she said you know what that's all that used to be my jam that's why you got to watch what you say come on church that used to be my jam sometimes don't release stuff like that out of your mouth before you know it you start going down the wrong memory lane what about the girls say that used to be my jam and she she uh she took off and she said i'm gonna just go in and see how everybody's doing and she walks in and and she see this one doing that and that one doing that like yeah i used to do that and before you know it she saw a dance partner they used to come in first place all the time he out there like you know it ain't gonna hurt let me just went out there and before you know it that girl's out there joking what god delivered it from she's right back at that door let me tell you something oh glory to god if the grace of god don't keep you then moves will come out of you again [Applause] them same old moves you got delivered from they'll come out of you again that's why you gotta even watch the spirit that comes into church with some of the music because it reproduces that stuff again [Applause] hallelujah church right but but you know if i mean you like i've been delivered for a number of years here preaching the gospel but you're getting around some breakdancers you know it just start coming out that's that sin nature that has to be conquered by the grace of god come on you ain't that holy you ain't that holy you know these things happen to you before you know you singing that song packing your feet and the reason you got to watch this because there's a spirit behind that [Applause] this girl just started dancing just for a little bit conviction hit him she said oh lord i i don't away church time church was over the prophet was home she ran to the house at brother branham i'm sorry i should have been in church oh lord ain't that something right there cause we don't hear from people now they just miss church and don't say nothing they sent a text to say something but this girl said she missed church she had a little conviction she ran to the prophet's house said say i'm sorry brother brandon i missed church tonight and and you know i i should have been there you know what happened so well what happened since where i passing by the battle dance and i thought i'd just swing in there and you know and thank you brother i thought i'd just swing in there and before you know it i was out there dancing and i i got i'm sorry brother brad say well let's pray and at that same time there was a drunk man in the house hallelujah just got drunk as i don't know what so brother branham say let's pray and and that drunk man was in the room and laying down and brother branham was praying with the young lady outside and and uh in the living room and all of a sudden a spirit came out of that girl she don't even know how it came in she never saw it come in it came in through music through a little dance and that spirit came in and said say the spirit came up out of that girl and went straight to the room where the drunk man was now i'm going to tell you he might have been drunk but he wasn't that drunk because even a drunk man could identify that the atmosphere that changed it it's rude and now that spirit was looking for somewhere to go and that man had he had he was open to that spirit because he's under the influence so here here the man the man's man jumped up so quick ran out the house i don't know it was a spirit went running you know coming in this room it looked like a bat and this girl got it because of what she fell back into see that's why we want to be careful and see and that's why paul can say this uh in whom also we had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh verse 3 fulfilling the desires of deflection of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others oh my god my god my god yeah that was my testimony glory to god but this is the next verse but god but god but god see that that t-shirt my daughter created that but god see i can tell you my testimony it was this way but god delivered me god set me free yeah adam and eve should have been cut off in the beginning but god it was nothing that adam did nothing that he did but god but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he had loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace [Music] no not because you did something not because you grew up in the church no by grace ye are saved [Applause] and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in the christians i just love the scripture amen i don't have to sit in my memories i don't have to sit in my failures and in my thoughts and my mistakes i can be seated together in heavenly places with christ jesus living above sin even my thoughts are above sin my actions are above sin and i don't think i'm no higher than nobody it's just where he placed me verse 7 says that in the ages to come the reason he did this reason he showed me grace that in ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace i'm a trophy of god's grace you are a trophy of god's grace exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves and i love that paul repeated it twice for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves nothing you did nothing i did it is the gift of god how god gonna give you a free gift and you're gonna withhold it from others like you did something to get the gift [Music] and then you tell other people ain't no grace for them one guy was teaching out there about the this vaccine being the mark of the beast and he said you know if you if you if you took the jab that's what he called it took the jab just pray because you you know i don't know like ain't no grace for nobody all right just you hate you just want to say you stop teaching you you just stop teaching for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works it's not even a works but i tell you grace will produce works amen not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them i thank god for this grace i was thinking on this grace is what saved noah and his family it's the grace of god that came down and revealed the will of god of what was getting ready to happen with this great flood and grace is what saved knowing it's fair not that noah did anything you can tell noah still has sin nature in him even after he come through a flood what's the first thing he'd do when he get on the other side the man should be thanking god and i think he did set up an altar or something like that but uh but but after he finished setting up his altar you know how we do after we go to church then we go get involved in something i did my due diligence just by showing up to church now i'm gonna go out here no god don't want that type of life from nobody god won't 24 7 service amen but no one got drunk after the after coming through you know this uh uh this great flood after he goes and gets drunk the man should have just been thanking god that he made it through and his family made it they're the only human beings on the earth and he'd go get drunk it was grace that saved him and his family and i want to say this is great save save knowing his family grace gonna save me and my family grace gonna save you and your family oh i feel jesus in this place oh there's a scripture that i had and i i i meant to read it i think i am going to read it i think it's sec second corinthians uh y'all somebody might have to help me with this one uh what paul said as such were some of you thank you i just read it and i didn't write it down i thought about it and i i knew that this could happen to me i knew that this could happen that this scripture is going to come back and hear the holy spirit yeah first corinthians 6 uh and nine grace save knowing his family my god my god god grace grace amen grace is what's allowing paul to write this scripture the way he's writing it and let's let's look at this i i lord jesus just let the lord have his way uh know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god that means you ain't going to heaven any way you want to live you can't do it that way you have to come god's way look it says be not deceived neither fornicators people having sex without being married right you're not going to heaven like that right nor idolaters nor adulterers amen right uh nor effeminate now i want i want you to understand uh what what now let's talk about inheriting the kingdom of god effeminate is a person that's practicing homosexuality oh glory to god i'm gonna just get ahead of myself because it's not that i mean we gonna read the rest of this paul actually makes a statement says but such were some of you and what i got from that is that god can deliver a person that's in homosexuality god can deliver an adulterer god can deliver a fornicator but such were some of you so there's still hope for anybody out there who said grace can cover it grace can separate you from it grace can clean your life up don't give up on nobody i just got to share this testimony i i recently i got a a friend of mine whose daughter had you know taken a a a alternative lifestyle and and um and the daughter the lord started dealing with her heart her and her partner both of them got their hearts dealt with god started dealing with them and and uh and the the they were trying to figure out some things and and uh they asked this minister to baptize them i mean this the partners asked the minister of the baptism like okay i i i'm not sure about this uh i'll uh i'll do it but before i do it i need to sit down and talk to you so they you know sat down and just explained what baptism is all about you know it's about that that old man being buried in the water and rise into the newness of life and walking according to the word of god so so so so so the minister just began to talk and say you know um this love that y'all have for each other is a perverted love it's a perverted love that you have for each other and that's not the love that god wants you to have and saying what god's gonna have to do is he have to take that love from you so you're gonna as you go through this process of baptism you're gonna start feeling god take that love those desires he's going to start taking that from you and uh and and and and and the partner said just start breaking broke down in tears so you know god already started that process we don't we don't do the things we used to do see this is this is when god is is is doing something things change you when you become a christian you don't live the same old when you come in contact with grace and grace is a person his name is jesus oh god help me but here when paul says that some of you were effeminate that means that there were some people practicing those lifestyles but were delivered so if you got a loved one that's in that condition they can be delivered let me keep reading no effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves let me stop there because i was looking at this in the in your mind you think somebody's just stealing you know and and and god god steve isn't gonna make it to heaven but when you look at it in this particular verse it's not just talking about somebody stealing it's actually talking about somebody in the pulpit that's actually abusing the people and taking advantage of the people right abusing their power they're stealing from the people if you just click on that word in the greek dictionary you'll find it it's talked about somebody that's in the pulpit actually stealing stealing with the the abuse of their power over the people and there's many churches out there i mean you know they they they rule the people in fear oh my god i mean you know if a person decides that they don't want to come to the church anymore the first thing they say they went out from us because they were not of us they abused it and then they make everybody afraid to leave the church hallelujah you don't want your you don't want to be called out when you leave oh my god right amen see this is an abuse of power who who god is ordained to be there in the church they're gonna be there and sometimes folk may come for a season and they have to leave for another season but may come back for another you just keep showing the love of god but when we look at thieves in this verse we're talking about people standing behind the pulpit abusing the people and you know a thief won't enter in northeast nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners and i'm just you know i'm laying all this out because i'm gonna say this while i got a chance to say it we're gonna need help with all that we're doing here and i'm looking for some some brothers to rise up and help i need that we're gonna need the help but i can't use you if you ain't living right i can't use you hey man right i mean we got to have a standard when it comes to people singing in the church we only want people that's got a life now i'm not talking about you making a mistake here and there all of us go through things like that but but i'm talking about you you you living ungodly and you know you living ungodly you're gonna leave here and then go pull up get a cigarette soon as you get out no no no no no no or you're gonna go get a drink no no you want to know probably the the the the most potent thing i drink soda praise the lord but now this is what and here the scripture is telling no re no no no coverages nor drunkards nor revilers and say well i don't drink to get drunk you probably don't even know if you're drunk and your body got so used to drinking it's a truth in the eye you can absorb a lot now somehow you got down that path but the grace of god want to stop that it's the truth and how great the god will take that from you amen nobody violence nor extortionists shall inherit the kingdom of god and this is the diversity level and such were some of you but you are washed but ye are sanctified and here's a here's another one ye are justified you know what that means just as if i never beat it what did that for you the grace of god did that for you [Music] but you justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any i don't want any of those influences in my life to bring me underneath the power of it i want to be free from that i thank god for it it was grace that saved noah and his family and i just wanted to inject even if you got family members that's tied up in some of these scriptures grace will step in and deliver them as well i don't care what they tied up in i don't care what they're tied up and grace can deliver grace is what saved abraham and his seed you see when abraham got down there with abimelech and gave his wife over to abimelech and had no sense of doing anything he shouldn't have done nothing like that but when he gave gave his wife over and told told a lie that this is my sister the man getting ready to take this take this woman making his wife and he was thinking about having children from her both of them live abraham and sarah lied but but god gave a dream to bim like i said don't touch that man don't touch his wife he said i thought they both said it was a sister they said no i know what he said but i i don't touch him and i want you to go and have him pray for you because he's my prophet god didn't even call him a liar god called him his prophet hallelujah i want to tell you it's because god was looking through the eyes of grace how does he see you this morning how does he see me this morning when he looks through the eyes of grace he sees me as a son he sees you as a daughter of god i thought about this a little bit more christ was the living word when he walked on the earth and and and and we have this scripture of the woman that was caught in adultery there in john chapter 8 and and i won't i won't take time to read all of that um well maybe maybe we can catch a little bit uh john 8 verse 1. oh hallelujah he was the living word at this time he was the manifested word of god hey glory and see she had to accept grace through the living words hey man amen here you know um the verse verse 1 and john 8 says jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them in the scribes and the pharisees brought unto him a woman taking an adultery and and i just you know can you imagine this this is an interruption of the service this is an interruption all the people gathered want to hear jesus preach and hear the scribes and pharisees these are religious leaders they interrupt the service and they brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst just imagine them just dragging her through the door and just sitting right down here and all eyes are on her imagine you being that woman and all the eyes are on you right there in in in in jesus presence and and here you know they say uh uh now moses in the law they taking them to the word oh my god moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what say is thou look at it now and notice now and the bible's just kind of giving us a man amen some inside information discernment of spirit this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not ignoring everything they were saying ignoring the entire situation that is before but look at this so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said to them he that is without sin among you let them cast let them first cast a stone at her what wisdom verse eight says and again he stooped stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which herded a man being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even until amen the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst i just love this see what you just saw happen here was grace entered into this this lady's situation she was an adulterer and she should have died but grace stepped in and see there are some things that we have done we should have died for but grace has stepped in amen verse 10 says when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said and her woman where are those down accuses hath no man condemn thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more not not what he says i'm not excusing you from what you just did see grace don't come in to washington allow you to go right back out and keep doing the same old thing all over again no grace wants you to stop what you was doing when you come in contact with grace because grace is a person this lady came in contact with the person of grace his name is jesus i can guarantee you this much had she gone out and kept sinning it would have been a different story see don't don't don't make grace a disgrace oh i just love the lord can i go a little further you know as i thought just on this this this woman here you know and and john 8 i also talk about thought about the woman in in luke 7. i won't read her story but you know she's the woman that that uh was not invited to the party and as she come to the party amen she saw jesus sitting there with unwashed feet with dirty feet and actually saw jesus sitting in the closet she said i can't believe that nobody washed his feet i can't believe they let them sit there unattended too and she went and got all of her earnings from living this ungodly lifestyle and she went and bought a perfume glory to god and uh and when she she used all the money to buy this perfume then she somehow snuck into the party and when she got to the party jesus just so happened to be sitting in a position where she could break a box glory to god pour her perfume out on his feet and begin to wash those feet with her tears glory to god and and the bible she didn't have a towel like the fish foot the foot once uh foot washed flunky with a head of top all she could use to dry his feet was her hair jesus say your sins are forgiven i want you to know that when that woman did all of that she didn't realize that grace was about to step in in her situation sometimes we get to a place where can't nobody else help us but grace grace has to be accepted in the living words i want to read a little a couple things here and uh we'll turn this corner and we'll go on from there brother branham when he preached the marriage of marriage and divorce and i was telling you all on wednesday night that uh there was a uh five sermons that brother branham preached and i don't remember them all but i know marriage and divorce was one and who is this melchizedek was another uh but uh they went to a middle school in jeffersonville and they preached he preached that series of five sermons so you know brother brianna went to middle school and preached and there was purpose for him being at the middle school i thought it was quite uh special for us to come to a middle school somebody said y'all should've went to the high school no we came to the middle school amen and and like i said on wednesday it's they designed this room just for us storage nursery office chairs everything everything just designed for this season for us amen i i know god i know god loves me i know that i told the church on wednesday night that i never wanted to actually go to school to have to do the setup and breakdown set up and break down but you know no they told us that nobody has used this room for the last year and a half so that means we really don't have to break down that much now i want to also just mention to you that as soon as i said that on wednesday somebody came on thursday i'm gonna start using the room ain't got no students but just want to use the room who y'all think that is but let's just show some grace but in marriage and divorce when brother branham preached it there is a law element of marriage and divorce that is so strict that if it's not handled correctly we have no preachers it's the truth anyhow when you really look at the scripture now we'll have no preachers because if a preacher lose his hair he's not supposed to preach i'm just telling according to scripture right so brother branham brother branham you know comes and he brings this truth to us to to get us back to the word we have to stand with the words stay stay solidly with the word hallelujah but in the end at the end of marriage and divorce there was a grace element that came into marriage and divorce and and most people missed the grace part they caught the law apart but they missed the grace see hearing this innocence in the cell that's the story of the woman that they brought to jesus they had the law moses in the law said oh good god almighty but grace was standing in the form of a person and what that woman did she walked in the revelation of grace that came to her she accepted the pertinent grace that came through jesus because the other people want the stoner i'm going to tell you something you have to accept the part and grace of the living word brother branham brought a living word even in marriage and divorce he brought a living word and and people have to be able to accept the partnering grace that is in the living word now that don't mean everybody just do whatever they want to do i ain't saying that hallelujah ain't saying that right amen there's still some things we got to work through in scripture glory to god but but but i am saying there is a grace element it's not all law there is a grace element there now let's look at this brother branham got accused of a a by a woman preacher because of the grace that he brought in marriage and divorce and this is out of the message it is rising of the sun and um it says as in the marriage and divorce case as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had had told me that i come and said just what he told me what happened he was in the mountain praying and the spirit of god just going up and down the mountain and told him go tell the people that they're caught in this condition because of misinterpreted theology he said he says now uh he says go pretty much he says go and don't teach your children never to do nothing like that he says i'm gonna let you stay in the conditions you are misinterpreted theology caused the people to get into conditions grace came out and said i'm gonna let you stay the way that you are but don't teach your children never to do nothing like this so brother branham said that based on a supernatural experience from the angel of god look at this says as a marriage divorce case the other day when the holy spirit told me that i come and said it just the way he told me some minister lady gave me a right sharp little balling out first of all minister lady don't sound right but she had to correct the prophet said she she said i guess you take the place of god i said no ma'am said well you told them their sin is forgiven said where say only god has power he said see another pharisee i said you see that you might know just to kind of get put back in the scripture that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was he told them thou art the christ the son of god he said blessed up thou see son of jonas flesh and blood never reveal this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys what whatever you bind on earth i abounded in heaven what you loose on earth and it just left it right there for what you loose on earth out loose in heaven pretty much the church had the power to bind and loose that was matthew 16 that he was quoting let me see uh i'm going to this quote it says that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the son jesus met this woman a man that was accused of adultery and uh and he and he forgives us it was the word was made flesh in jesus we gotta we gotta bring it forward now we gotta bring it forward i'm turning the corner but you got to stay with me because the word is still made flesh i i i ain't got the quote but i can tell you right now brother branham said the word that was made flesh in christ has now become our flesh glory to god says that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh it was if it was flesh in that day by the sun the groom is fleshed today by the bride see whosoever says you remit to them they are remitted whosoever says you retain to them they are retained now the catholic church picked that picked up picked that up and takes it to their priests but that's carnal watch it was a spiritual it was the spiritual a word that did it that's the reason he told them to go baptize in the name of the father son of the holy ghost he knowed they knew who he was the spiritual revealed word is what's providing the grace i want to say that again it's the spiritual revealed word that's providing the grace and you have to be able to accept the pardoning grace of the living word now let me just switch back over oh my to revelation 6. bear with me verse 9 through 11. oh jesus we read revelation 6 verse 9 through 11. we're talking about the fish seal um just a quick highlight when we're looking at the seals uh especially when we get to the fifth seal the the church ages are now over the first four seals actually deal with all seven church ages the first four seals have included all seven church ages and after the church ages are over god's no longer dealing with the gentile people now he begins to deal with the jews and this is where we pick up the jews that their time is coming here and revelation 6 verse 9 through 11. so a lot of times when we read the book of revelation this is why it's so important it's one thing to read your bible nothing wrong with that i think that's great i read my my bible i've been reading it for uh uh over 20 years and i've been on a bible reading plan every year and i've read the bible through and through over 20 years the problem is that you're running to things and reading your bible you're running to things that you cannot understand and you're gonna need somebody to give you some instruction so most people they'll start going to google and they'll look here they look there and like this you know the door this this lady my daughter uh uh sent over a little link to us and listening to this man teaching on the scene all like this man so far off he said donald trump was the antichrist i say i don't believe that i just you know and he said if it's not donald trump it's probably donald trump jr he don't know who it is and then he said he said if it's not them to i got somebody else but i'm just not saying it yet we're not following nothing like that we we want to know we want to know thus saith the lord right don't give me none of that it could be the incident could not i don't want none of that i got thus saith the lord through a prophet right so so when you come to try to understand scripture you have to take some source i choose to take a vindicated prophet as my source amen so when i'm when i'm when i'm reading to you out of revelation i can go back to what the prophet said and give you what what what it is and i can show you that there's things that's already happened there's things happening now and there's things that will happen in the future and when you read the bible let me especially when you read the book of revelation let me just drop this in it is not like reading any other normal book revelation 6 does not come after revelation 4. let me know i'm sorry revelation revelation 5 it don't come after in your bible it do but the events surrounding it don't come after it like that hallelujah hey man then you got to be it's a it's a puzzle and you got to pick this piece up and pick this piece up and pick that p and put it all together in order to get the puzzle right that's why i was written mysteriously like that and it take a profit to reveal what is there because if you try to put it all linear you'll be all lost like this like this this man i want i ain't gonna call his name i just i just we pray for the brother that's all i can say but but but uh i want to just show if i was to go back and read it because we picked up when the fifth seal fifth seal but there was four other seals before that all those four seals deal with the church ages it deals with us and let me tell you we we are in laodicea but we're not leo the sians we are the bride living in laodicea but this church age is not over it won't be over until we leave all right let me go a little further all right oh god help us here i'm i'm winding up um so when we're looking at the seal especially this this fifth seal we're looking at hey man this is not the bride uh this is the jews that god is dealing with at this time amen this is the jews uh there's many reasons why we can we can see this and i'm i'm trying not to get too deep into this but i'll just say when the first four says there was a beast that rose up and said come and see but when we got to the fifth seal there was no beast that rose up and said come and see what those beasts were were actually the cherubim my god hallelujah the cherubim is what's when adam and eve got kicked out of the garden of eden the cherubim blocked their entrance from coming back into it but in this hour the cherubim are pointing the way through the reveal world come and see hallelujah so you have to be able to accept pardon and grace as it's coming through the living world watch this now let's go a little further here we see this heavenly scene these souls under the altar are jews that were killed for the word of god and for the testimony they held and brother branham said they were you know when the jews rejected christ at the cross they said let his blood be on us and upon our children they had self-fulfilling prophecy years later underneath stalin underneath eichmann on the lease underneath hitler their children suffered simply because they were jewish believers they were slain for the word of god and the testimony which they held pull up verse verse nine uh revelation six times i'm just referring to this i'm not i'm i'm giving you a a overview and i know it's like before we just don't worry don't worry you have something you can go back and and feast on and when you're listening to the seals it'll make sense to you glory to god amen uh and and verse 10 says and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and truth dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on earth so here they're they're looking to get revenge for all the suffering that was done right and uh uh but here the bible says and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now i want to just kind of inject just a couple things white robes were given unto them these were jews that went through the tribulation period they received their white robes on the other side of the tribulation period but i want i want i want you to know something that we as the bride already had our white robes oh glory and the way that we got our white robes i'm gonna read it for you in a sec in a second the way that we got our white robes is because we accepted the pardoning grace that came through the living word oh glory glory glory now watch this let's just read a couple things here i i'll show it to you amen i'm reading from the fifth seal i'm reading from the fifth still i want you to understand that when the jews say let his blood be on us and on our children when they rejected christ at the cross grace was coming in at that time for the gentiles the reason you hear today is because god blinded the eyes of those jews so they could not recognize him as savior as messiah the reason you sit in church today is because of what god to the jews that what god allowed to happen to jews that was god's grace coming to the gentiles don't make grace a disgrace i want to read something out of fifth seal this says notice now i want you to watch this real close they were given robes that's what we just read they were given ropes it says they were given robes they didn't have them they were given ropes they didn't have them they were giving rose white robes each one of them it says now the saints already have one us we already have one now the saints already have one he says they get it here but here they were given robes and the saints already had theirs and going on that means they they was raptured away it said seeing go no see and had not seen they had not a chance because they were blinded by god their own father so that the grace of god could be fulfilled so the bride could be took away from the gentiles is that right by grace are ye saved and i want to i'm gonna go a little further by grace you have been introduced to a message this ain't got nothing to do with you you can be that good but by grace you've been brought to a message a revealed word for this date by grace think about the plaza that we was in and all the churches that was in that plaza but by grace we were there with the revelation that we had when we come here to the school is by grace that we're still walking underneath the revealed word of god i've accepted the pardoning grace through the reveal word i'm i'm i'm finished with that quote i don't let's see what paragraph okay 229. um i'm i'm going to an insane uh sermon i'm going down to paragraph 432 it might be a little off might be 4 31 for you of 433 i'm not sure but you'll find it in that 430 area uh brother branham said the saints get theirs here so what had happened as the holy spirit was opening up this uh this revelation of the fifth seal to the prophet just showing them what it was all about and and every day supernaturally the angel of god would come in and reveal to him what the seal meant every day right so uh uh there's many that picked up the bible reading like you know like the one this just i'm back to this guy again i can't get away from it get in my spirit sometimes you can't listen to stuff just get in your spirit this man said in the first seal the rider took his bow and shot an arrow he said that was the coronavirus in the vaccine you know he's oh he said that was a vaccine his arrow was the vaccine when you read the bible my brother he had a he had a bow but he don't have arrows this is what the prophet told us he has a bow but no arrow so that is not the vaccine that's not the rider of the of the in the seal there that's not it and they try to be so deep and people so confused but we got a prophet we got to reveal word we ain't got to be confused by none of this not afraid afraid of any of it amen a vaccine is very very common i don't know when did it become so uncommon i've traveled overseas many times i had to take a vaccine i got no problem with that hey man it's a choice every and i'm not going to take nobody's choice from them you got a choice you got four choices you got modern you got pfizer you got johnson and johnson or you can choose not to do it it's your choice praise the lord amen and i ain't gonna let none of that stuff divide a church i'm gonna let none of that divide no church [Applause] don't don't look down on nobody because they didn't get the one you got off or they didn't get it at all don't do that don't let the devil get in like that you you made your decision let them make their decision amen praise god amen if they choose not to do it that's fine praise god god's still protecting us all it's the grace of god amen amen all right but but but brother branham was as the angel lord was revealing these things to him i'm coming too close uh the angel showed him that this group in in in revelation 6 the fifth seal says this was jews because there was many uh bible teachers that thought it was the bride he said no it's not the bride they had already left they left after the fourth uh the fourth seal right they left they left they left after the seven turkeys was over they left they went into a rapture but now god is dealing with the jews when we look at this from the fifth seal sixth seal we're looking at god dealing with the jews now while he was meditating on that god showed him a little vision took him back in his mind and showed him a vision and he says uh and this is why i make the statement they already got theirs they got it here that's why i said it say the church the bribe they got it here they didn't have to get a rope here in in this verse verse 10 say they received the robe i believe it was in verse 10. uh uh is that right uh verse i'm sorry verse 11. and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season so they were given robes during the tribulation period my god but here the bride had already received their robes their white robes and brother branham said the angel lord just kind of showed him saying now that was for the jews but my people already had him god took him to a vision and in a vision he was in heaven and this is where he met his his little daughter hallelujah glory to god uh she died as a baby and uh and there she was 20 years old and she walked and said god bless you daddy say daddy say yeah i'm your sharon rose that was on earth with you know when you lost man a little bit i'm your sheriff say oh my he say she said here in heaven ain't no little babies up here daddy ain't no little baby say saying then his wife coming to him god bless you my brother all these saints came up to god bless my brother and all the saints was dressed in white robes glory to god amen all the saints were dressed in white robes and they began to have a little conversation with the angels saying i want to see jesus he's saying say now you can't see him he's a little bit higher another dimension that he was in you can't get it but he will come to you one day he will judge you for the things that you preach he says it's paul here said yeah paul said all the people that paul preached who are they here yes they're here will paul have to be judged what he preached yes paul got to be judged what he preached he says i preach the same thing that paul preached and he said millions screamed out we're resting on that [Applause] and i'm crazy enough to believe that i'm one of the millions that was saying we're resting on that i i i'm i'm so happy you preached the same thing paul preached because i come from god and i'm gonna make it back to god on this revealed word [Applause] look at this in this message the fifth seal this is where the angel just began to uh after he showed him all these things this way he makes the statement he says now notice but i was just thinking as his precious godly brother john i just thought it'd be good place to inject that just before closing see if john looked over there and then was of his brethren see his brethren that had to suffer a little then see the lord god permitted me so john in the book of revelation is looking at his brother and john is caught up in the isle of patmos looking at this vision unfold for a future event it says god allowed john to see his brethren now look at what brother brown said god also allows me to see he permitted me to see my brethren and the saints that were waiting for the coming of the lord notice they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine wasn't but these was they were martyrs see mine wasn't under the martyr's altar now i want you to listen real close and i'll close honest just about in 10 minutes at 10 o'clock says if i just have to cut it off and finish it tomorrow look they were not the ones that that that the ones that the lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's block she's not identified here in revelation 6 verse 9 through 11 fifth seal she's not identified there see she was not under the martyr's block no the sacrifice all to the martyrs look at what he says but had received white robes by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word she got her white robe because she was able to accept the part and grace of the living word and it just came to me i didn't think about this till right now adam and eve got a white covering lamb skin because they accepted the grace of the living word you want to make a rapture accept the grace of this living word had received white rules by accepting the part and the grace of the living word christ had given them a white robe i want to finish with a quote out of the message of grace and this this just meant so much to me as i as as i as i looked at this um this grace don't don't like i say don't make grace a disgrace god has given us a special message in this hour special word that he's given us and this is not something to be just trampled on if i could just put it this way god gave you his best when he brought to you the full revelation you know and in in in in abraham's day abraham was the one that received the full revelation of what was getting ready to happen and i'm telling you things that are going to happen to the jews we got the full revelation right now what i just shared with you brother brandon brought the full revelation of what was going to happen we're standing as abraham's seat with the full revelation of what's going to happen no we don't have to worry about being here but if you want to miss it you're going to have to accept the pardon and grace that come through the living word there's a story um this you can try to try to search it like this grace was promised in the garden of eden and grace came just look for that and that i'm going to be at the message of grace there was a story of a of a young man that was um in a cell and his friend thought he was wrongly accused and should not have been in jail for what he did and and and and he went running to the president so and just for the man to be able to get audience for the president was a miracle he got run to the president explain the story to the president president didn't have time to get his letterhead he just took took his signature sign on the paper and said pardon so the friend was so excited i got a word from the president my friend getting out of jail today boy i'm running and he ran to the jail as soon as he could i got told the jail i got something signed from the president uh my friend can be pardoned so he uh you know he he he went to the friend and in the cells like look i got something signed from the president you can be pardoned you ain't got to worry about this you're going to go free friend looked at the little sheet of paper didn't see no letterhead from the president they say this thing from the president why you come mess with me at a time like this man you know i'm getting ready to die why don't you mess with me like that they took him i executed him then the president found out about why they execute that guy i thought after i signed an apartment from why they do that and they had to come up with a new statement that said pardon is not a pardon unless it's received and i'm telling you i'm walking in the grace i've accepted the pardon and grace that has come to me in the living word just like that woman that was accused of adultery she did it but when she came in contact with grace she didn't go to do it no more look at this last quote the grace was promised in the garden of eden and grace came grace to adam and eve nowhere to go know which way to turn and yet grace made a way hallelujah he says let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman chaser you may be here a drunkard or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as a impure husband all those things are read in 1st corinthians 6 an impure wife you might be the vilest of sinner you say i'ma pass that stage of redemption no you're not you wouldn't be at the church this morning grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you'll just accept it adam had to be willing to accept it so do you accept it accepting the part and grace of the living word god bless you [Applause] musicians come let's just have a word of prayer lord jesus how we appreciate your grace it's been given to us in so many ways think about those times that we've had encounters with death car accidents or maybe in places that we shouldn't have been in but grace protected us grace kept us think about lord jesus needing a savior because of how much sin we found ourselves in and how grace stepped in and made the difference [Music] god even when it comes to this revealed word that we have an opportunity to fellowship around it's not that we're any different from anybody else [Music] it's simply grace father i never want to take it lightly i never want to take it for granted [Music] i want to express my appreciation to your god my gratitude because it was given to me i realized lord that anybody else to think about the people i grew up with the neighborhood that i'm from and lord the people i went to school with but yet god you would choose me out of all those people to show me these truths it's simply grace for my grace are you saved and that not of yourselves but it's a gift of god [Music] thank you for the gift of grace i pray lord today that if one is heard here present as well as those that are listening online god if they have not walked in them or accepted this partner grace that has come to us through the living word i pray god that they would come to that spot where they can yield they can repent confess their sins to your father and acknowledge that they need this grace can't make it without it may the living person of grace lord make himself real to each and every one of us fathers our prayer just like you made yourself real to that woman that was caught in adultery we've been caught in sin we have things that we're not proud of god we thank you lord god your grace has stepped in [Music] we praise you for it hallelujah it's in jesus name we pray [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus and though i can't repaint from my heart i'd like to say that i [Music] thank you come on stand to your feet and help me sing it thank you jesus [Music] for the grace that you had given us [Music] from my heart [Music] thank you [Music] hallelujah [Music] for the grace [Music] [Applause] [Music] i just want to say thank you [Music] thank you [Music] hallelujah oh thank you giving us all love though i can't repay from my heart [Music] [Applause] amen i just want to take this moment and uh just share what the lord just shared with gave me he's preaching on this grace and uh he made mention of the vaccine and how people are trying to avoid the market obese so they're running and and instead of see you see sometimes your focus can be wrong a good offense is a good defense or should i say a good defense is a good offense okay so don't focus on avoiding the mark because see if you focus on the seal of god which is the grace then you won't have to worry about the mark see adjust your focus don't don't focus on what the devil is doing focus on what god is doing so he preached on the took this message of grace and talked about it from the fifth seal [Music] and in revelation 9 it says and the fifth angel sounded and i saw it start fall from heaven unto the earth and it was to him that was uh of to the earth and to him was given the key to the bombless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace in the sun and the air was darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and it came out of this of the smoke locust upon the earth and up and unto them was given the power as the scorpions of the earth's earth have power now i appreciate a while ago about this locus that that the prophet had told me that how the the leaves of the trees are the fellowship of the saints and how people are churches are being divided because of this vaccine and all of these different things and i just appreciate how he brought that out about i won't let it divide a church see that's what the devil is trying to do he's trying to divide and conquer amen now i want to go on i want to say here and it came out of the locust upon the earth and unto them was given the power and as the scorpions of the earth and her power and the fourth verse and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads that's revelation 9 4 what's today's date september 4th [Music] 5th i'm sorry today's the 5th september 5th amen so uh i believe there's some relevance to it amen i believe there's some relevance to it and and to them it was given that they should not kill them but they but but that they should be tormented five months in their torment of the torment of scorpions when they strike like it's a man so my whole point i thought it was the fourth i'm sorry that just took my whole thing away amen but what i'm saying don't focus on the mark of the beast focus on the seal of god because truly i believe it was the grace is the grace and the whole matter the grace in the thing is the only way to have that seal of god is by receiving the grace that god has given us in this hour and and it just touched my heart when he said what is that grace now we have grace he when he when he when he saved when he saved me from sin when he when he when he when when when when he took marijuana away from me when he when he saved me from the accident but the greatest thing was when he revealed this message and gave me something you know i didn't i didn't choose or just but i what was it about me that i believed so many people struggled to believe this message struggled to believe it it wasn't hard for me to believe it so there was something on the inside there was a deep calling out something made a connection something made a connection in my heart to what what was happening that made it relevant that made it live it was real it was right now it wasn't it gave the bible relevance into my life and into the to today i would it was it no longer was a book of history but it was a book of right now amen you love the lord amen y'all pray for me amen i i was um [Music] over at the wedding with my son and uh there was a relevance to the date of his uh wedding and and and the lord just gave me a scripture relevant to that date and uh amen and i said lord you're doing this again amen so uh but i believe it's still uh uh needed amen amen so let us pray amen most gracious heavenly father lord god i thank you amen for uh for just amen only you could prepare my heart to prepare our hearts to receive amen the word amen [Music] that you would uh uh we would we could receive such a message lord god it was nothing that we did we're no smarter than anybody else we're we're we're we're we're not better but we were just chosen and lord that you you would you would give us this grace oh father god and we receive it oh father and lord god we have uh uh compassion for those lord god that that that seem to don't understand and can't seem to to find that resting place lord god is still lost oh father god and can't seem to connect the dots so far but lord let us not make grace a disgrace in this hour let us run with uh until too much is given much is required let us meet the challenge of today lord god let us let us let us live a life of father god worthy of the gospel o god let us walk lord god worthy of this grace o father god lord god bless us o father god now as we uh prepare to leave this place so far give us travel and mercy along the dangerous highways of father god give each and every one of us a blessed week lord god may we keep

and every one of us so father god under the eyes of your protection of father god and we meet back here again lord god at the appointed time of father god just waiting oh father god has hungry little children looking to be fed o lord god forgive us of our trespasses of father god as we forgive those who trespass against us we ask these blessings oh god in jesus name [Music] the amen you may be seated we haven't i don't know how we will be dismissing it yet though from my heart i would like to say that i thank you thank you jesus [Music] for the grace that you have given [Music] oh thank you jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh thanks [Music] jesus [Music] thanks [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the grace that you have given us [Music] [Applause] thank you jesus
