[57:35] believe in going to Israel a man for
[57:38] about nine or 10 days and a man it's a
[57:41] life lifelong dream of mine to go and
[57:44] God has blessed me to go so I'm looking
[57:47] forward to it and distrust in an hour
[57:49] this is a trip I'm going by myself so a
[57:52] man I'm looking just to spend some
[57:55] quality time with the Lord a man I'm
[57:57] looking for him to speak to me inspire
[57:59] me you know and you know and I prayed it
[58:02] will all reap the benefits
[58:04] a man from from from that journey so we
[58:07] just we just looking forward talk about
[58:09] got a store so let's read amen here out
[58:11] of Matthew 14 and we will pick up you
[58:16] know where we left off a man of some
[58:18] things are left intentionally out and I
[58:22] wanted to go back a man and just try to
[58:24] bring us forward and then from bring us
[58:27] bring us forth from
[58:29] Friday night and then go for from there
[58:30] so here Matthew 14 verse 22 a man that
[58:33] says in a straight way Jesus constrained
[58:35] his disciples to get into a ship and to
[58:39] go before him to the other side while he
[58:42] sent the multitudes away now those of
[58:46] you that were here Friday night as we
[58:48] reread the scripture Jesus already knew
[58:51] what was getting read had happened okay
[58:54] he already knew what was going happening
[58:56] so notice he constraining them ok so
[58:59] there's probably discussions going back
[59:01] and forth as to you know why they should
[59:05] just wait with him you know but know he
[59:07] knows what's gonna happen so he's know
[59:09] y'all get on in the ship go on I'll take
[59:11] care of this go ahead and do this praise
[59:13] the Lord
[59:14] so straightway Jesus constrained his
[59:16] disciples you know to get into a ship
[59:20] and to go before him unto the other side
[59:23] while he sent the multitudes away and
[59:27] when he had sent the multitudes away he
[59:29] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[59:31] glory to God and when the evening was
[59:34] come he was there alone but the ship was
[59:38] now in the midst of the sea tossed with
[59:41] waves for the wind was contrary a man
[59:46] now the wind is contrary the situation
[59:48] has changed and in the fourth watch of
[59:50] the night Jesus went unto them walking
[59:53] on the sea my god just think about how
[59:57] long they were in this condition before
[1:00:00] he showed up and brother branham likes
[1:00:02] to preach is you know in your darkest
[1:00:05] hour then Jesus comes anybody in a dark
[1:00:10] hour well you you ought to be looking
[1:00:13] for Jesus in your darkest hour then
[1:00:16] Jesus comes right and man he goes on to
[1:00:19] say the Bible says and when the
[1:00:20] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[1:00:22] they were troubled now they were already
[1:00:25] in trouble
[1:00:26] by being on a dangerous sea but now here
[1:00:30] that there's more it's magnified because
[1:00:33] they see somebody walking a man towards
[1:00:35] them on water that just now you come on
[1:00:39] this imagine if this was you out there
[1:00:41] on that ship
[1:00:42] I'm already messed up being out here
[1:00:44] right and and and well let me just
[1:00:47] please let me keep going I'm trying man
[1:00:49] I bring you four it says I says when
[1:00:52] it's like I'm walking them see they were
[1:00:53] trouble saying it is a spirit and they
[1:00:55] cried out for fear but straightway Jesus
[1:00:57] picking them saying be of good cheer it
[1:00:59] is I be not afraid
[1:01:01] o glory and Peter answered him and said
[1:01:05] lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[1:01:11] on the water and he and he thought he
[1:01:14] was asking for something impossible
[1:01:16] you think you asking God for something
[1:01:18] impossible I gotta blow your mind
[1:01:22] hey man it says up and and and Peter
[1:01:25] Peter handsome said lord if it be thou
[1:01:27] bid me come under the on the water he
[1:01:29] said come and when Peter was come down
[1:01:33] out of the ship can't you see them
[1:01:34] getting down that machine can you see
[1:01:37] them got y'all got the seat Peter
[1:01:38] getting out the ship onto water notice I
[1:01:42] didn't say into water
[1:01:44] I said own to water here here Peter just
[1:01:49] getting out the ship glory their God
[1:01:51] some of them decipher light now wait a
[1:01:53] minute I had never seen them like this
[1:01:55] but look the Bible say if see he said
[1:01:57] come and when Peter was come down out of
[1:02:00] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:02:04] Jesus but when he saw the wind
[1:02:08] boisterous now now the way it was
[1:02:10] boisterous before he got out of the ship
[1:02:15] but when he started winning boisterous
[1:02:18] he was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:02:21] cried saying lord save me maybe he's
[1:02:23] just a little enthused that's why I said
[1:02:25] what he said but nothing nonetheless
[1:02:26] Peter walked in his enthusiasm he walked
[1:02:30] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[1:02:33] his hand and caught him and said unto
[1:02:35] Him o thou a little faith that was the
[1:02:37] key thing just faith will allowed him to
[1:02:40] do that without a little faith wherefore
[1:02:42] didst thou doubt so when you have faith
[1:02:45] you can't mix it with doubt as as you're
[1:02:48] walking in faith you can do all things
[1:02:50] but when just a little doubt come in it
[1:02:53] began to change your situation and when
[1:02:56] they were coming to the ship the wind
[1:02:59] ceased then they that were in the ship
[1:03:04] came and worshiped him saying of a truth
[1:03:05] thou art the Son of God let's pray
[1:03:08] father we thank you for the opportunity
[1:03:11] to read the word but we are trusting it
[1:03:13] the Holy Spirit would just make things
[1:03:16] clearer to us as we've read your your
[1:03:19] word God we want to pray for all the
[1:03:22] believers that were not able to make it
[1:03:24] today we heard from the Johnson family
[1:03:26] and them not being able to make it and
[1:03:28] also brother Garin and his job calling a
[1:03:33] man we heard from him others we haven't
[1:03:37] heard from but we know God that you're
[1:03:38] in control so we just pray for each and
[1:03:40] every person that you were just
[1:03:41] strengthened and now we that are here
[1:03:43] we've already felt your presence in this
[1:03:46] place but now God as we go into your
[1:03:48] word may you help us Lord to see it more
[1:03:50] clear and that we would not just say we
[1:03:53] heard a good message but father may we
[1:03:55] leave here living and manifesting the
[1:03:58] things that we hear it's in Jesus name
[1:04:01] we pray amen amen god bless y'all can be
[1:04:03] seated amen
[1:04:16] ma'am so we titled a man the service
[1:04:22] sermon on Friday night fear not and i'ma
[1:04:27] use pretty much the same thing but today
[1:04:28] I'm gonna call it no fear all right no
[1:04:31] fear no fear and you know as just just
[1:04:35] again you're looking at that scripture
[1:04:37] there in Matthew 14 we can there's a
[1:04:43] number of things here that we can draw
[1:04:47] our attention to brother Branham
[1:04:50] described their situation I won't read
[1:04:53] the whole quote I'll just read a portion
[1:04:54] of this but I'll tell you what message I
[1:04:57] got it out of came from Jehovah Jireh
[1:04:59] just a little portion it says now their
[1:05:00] ship was waterlogged and the sails was
[1:05:03] broke all right so we get the better
[1:05:05] description of what's going on when I
[1:05:07] say that they were tossed there and with
[1:05:09] the wave so this ship was one along the
[1:05:11] sails was broke the oars was gone and
[1:05:14] they were holding one another screaming
[1:05:17] I want to get that in your mind these
[1:05:20] disciples men of the sea their ship is
[1:05:23] waterlogged their cells are broken their
[1:05:27] oars were gone and they're holding one
[1:05:29] another screaming a man they're holding
[1:05:32] one another screaming brother Branham
[1:05:34] gives us this this description and as we
[1:05:37] look at this some of the the the the
[1:05:41] information that we may need to also
[1:05:43] look at before we go deeper is before
[1:05:47] they got in this condition a man if we
[1:05:50] would have just read a few verses before
[1:05:52] it would talked about how Jesus had just
[1:05:54] finished feeding 5,000 people right and
[1:05:58] here they were were man that was sitting
[1:06:00] there encouraging Jesus to send the
[1:06:03] people away because you know they had
[1:06:05] been there all day are feasting on the
[1:06:07] Word of God but the people were hungry
[1:06:09] and they needed to they needed to eat
[1:06:10] but the shops were closing and all these
[1:06:12] things and and they were encouraging
[1:06:14] Jesus please send the people away so
[1:06:16] they can get something to eat but but
[1:06:18] Jesus amen when they come to him with
[1:06:21] the problem amen the solution that Jesus
[1:06:25] gave them when they say Jesus our people
[1:06:27] are hungry you know
[1:06:28] let them let them depart that's the
[1:06:30] solution that Jesus can't say Jesus say
[1:06:32] they don't need to depart and then they
[1:06:35] probably looked at them it was like what
[1:06:36] you mean they don't even apart they
[1:06:38] haven't eaten all day that I mean if the
[1:06:40] people are hungry and and you've been
[1:06:42] preaching a long time Jesus Jesus say
[1:06:44] they don't need it apart and then Jesus
[1:06:46] adds another statement he say you give
[1:06:49] them something to eat and this is where
[1:06:53] the dialogue begins like now now wait
[1:06:56] Jesus you want us to feed these people
[1:06:58] we don't even have anything so so so you
[1:07:01] know when you start eating this and the
[1:07:02] other Gospels you see how you know Jesus
[1:07:04] tell them to go in and search I can't
[1:07:07] see how much food is out there and when
[1:07:09] they come back and then with the report
[1:07:10] I can just imagine Peter standing up
[1:07:13] Jesus Lee how much food you got 5,000
[1:07:16] people a man and y'all got to get that
[1:07:20] in your head 5,000 people and the food
[1:07:23] report is we got two fish and five
[1:07:27] loaves of bread I can imagine
[1:07:30] Peter probably standing with an attitude
[1:07:32] Jesus you know what we found we told you
[1:07:35] to send these people away but you didn't
[1:07:37] want to listen so so we got a report we
[1:07:39] got two fish and five loaves of bread
[1:07:42] what you gonna do with that Jesus say
[1:07:46] sit down have them all sit down and
[1:07:48] companies like 15 he took the bread and
[1:07:50] the fish he blessed it and he began to
[1:07:53] break it and it began to multiply right
[1:07:56] there and these brothers saw that the
[1:07:58] brother brother branham say as they were
[1:08:00] in the ship when Jesus encouraged him to
[1:08:02] leave you know they were in the ship he
[1:08:04] said could imagine John just kind of
[1:08:06] stepping up said maybe it's quiet for
[1:08:08] about ten minutes he said but all of a
[1:08:09] sudden John said man I noticed the son
[1:08:11] of God I ain't never seen nothing like
[1:08:13] this tomorrow all my life five thousand
[1:08:15] people get fat with two fish and five
[1:08:18] loaves of bread and then we got
[1:08:19] something we got we got leftovers so I
[1:08:22] ain't never seen this has got to be the
[1:08:24] Son of God they're just encouraging and
[1:08:26] talking to one another but in the midst
[1:08:29] of that testimony service we have a
[1:08:34] situation where their ship gets waterlog
[1:08:38] the sails are broke the oars are gone
[1:08:42] and they're holding one another and
[1:08:45] screaming and the problem is is that
[1:08:47] this is what life is really like for
[1:08:49] many of us we can come amen the church
[1:08:53] and have a mighty service we can go
[1:08:55] other places and see God do great things
[1:08:58] but then when we settle back down and
[1:09:00] life becomes life come on somebody and
[1:09:05] then all we life becomes life all of a
[1:09:07] sudden the trials begin to hit but but
[1:09:09] when the trials hit don't forget what
[1:09:12] God has already done don't don't don't
[1:09:18] don't don't act like you got everything
[1:09:20] you can't remember what God did for you
[1:09:22] last week because if he did it before
[1:09:26] he's able to do it again and again so
[1:09:32] here you know you know that you know the
[1:09:35] Prophet tells us that day their ship is
[1:09:37] what along the sails was broke the oars
[1:09:40] was gone they were holding one another
[1:09:42] there they're screaming you know and and
[1:09:45] and and if you're in that situation
[1:09:49] you're in the middle of the sea glory to
[1:09:53] God and and and and you're in there you
[1:09:55] got a stale and you know you've
[1:09:57] depending on the wind and kind of carry
[1:09:58] sail but here your sail is broken so now
[1:10:02] you're your backup is to use yours oh my
[1:10:05] god so when your first plan fails and
[1:10:09] when your second plan fails what do you
[1:10:13] do the question is do you do you have
[1:10:18] fear because because I might as well
[1:10:23] give it answer that's not the solution
[1:10:26] to your problem to have fear and then
[1:10:29] you you gotta approach life with no fear
[1:10:33] come on I don't care
[1:10:35] amen their situation is something on the
[1:10:38] sea you got to apply this to whatever
[1:10:39] you go through you got to approach it
[1:10:42] with no fear
[1:10:43] if you hurt a bad report from the doctor
[1:10:45] no
[1:10:46] fear if your children are acting up no
[1:10:49] fear
[1:10:53] relationships are breaking down no fear
[1:10:57] man my my basket my heart time no fear I
[1:11:01] don't know how to get through this class
[1:11:04] in school no fear no fear no no no
[1:11:13] that's not that's not how God wants you
[1:11:14] to approach in this a man I mean you
[1:11:17] know you know when we look at this this
[1:11:21] whole situation the the the where they
[1:11:24] add in this ship and you know they're
[1:11:27] they're looking at it and like man
[1:11:28] everything that my first plan to spell
[1:11:31] my second plan is fail and I'm just
[1:11:33] holding on to these brothers we all
[1:11:36] going down and Jesus the one put us in
[1:11:39] the ship now they just finished
[1:11:40] testifying about him and he come in the
[1:11:42] fourth watch he waited he waited a while
[1:11:45] before he actually showed up so when he
[1:11:47] comes you know walking on the water
[1:11:50] now that really took the fear to another
[1:11:53] level because you never seen none like
[1:11:56] this somebody walking on the water
[1:11:58] towards you I mean that just that just
[1:12:00] wait a minute now you know before we go
[1:12:02] into that I had to just kind of go in
[1:12:05] and look at of something here I asked
[1:12:09] myself a question is fear a natural
[1:12:13] response it's fear natural and you know
[1:12:21] because you if it was me in this
[1:12:24] situation I probably would be operating
[1:12:27] in fear as well I'm gonna just be honest
[1:12:29] you know there's one thing half a things
[1:12:31] out yeah yeah I realized that but
[1:12:32] sometimes things hit you and fear
[1:12:35] settles him let's be honest
[1:12:39] fear will fear will strike you in and
[1:12:41] sometimes you wonder is that natural so
[1:12:46] I began to look this up and and I find
[1:12:48] out that we were born with only two
[1:12:51] innate fears that's the fear of falling
[1:12:55] in the fear of loud sounds right Amen
[1:12:59] this is what this what the scientists
[1:13:01] say that we were born with two fears and
[1:13:03] then the fear of falling and the fear of
[1:13:05] loud sounds now you know they went on
[1:13:08] and said that most fear is actually
[1:13:10] learned to inexperience appear falling
[1:13:18] and the fear of a loud sounds it and I'm
[1:13:21] gonna be honest I don't know if I agree
[1:13:23] with all that right because I know for a
[1:13:26] baby amen
[1:13:28] when it come to falling that a child
[1:13:30] when it's starting to walk amen
[1:13:33] when it's learning how to walk that
[1:13:34] child might fall but that child is
[1:13:37] something insider to say get back up and
[1:13:39] keep pressing on and then that fear does
[1:13:42] not stop that child from continuing to
[1:13:45] to try to walk because you know when we
[1:13:48] look at the definition of fear it's an
[1:13:50] anxiety that's caused by an expectation
[1:13:53] of evil I want to say that again fear is
[1:13:58] an anxiety that it's caused by an
[1:14:00] expectation of evil so when you begin to
[1:14:04] expect bad results that's when fear is
[1:14:07] overcoming you stay with me here fear is
[1:14:12] learned so you know you know there was
[1:14:16] kind of given that they said this is
[1:14:17] spiders and snakes the dark these are
[1:14:21] things that people fear I know some
[1:14:23] boy they see a spot oh ho
[1:14:25] but Adam took I'll grant another way I
[1:14:27] mean look any bitty spot or two some
[1:14:30] fear roaches whatever they will take off
[1:14:35] on you in a roach and you know in
[1:14:39] Florida A&M but roaches all over the
[1:14:41] place I don't care how clean your house
[1:14:43] is they they will find a way to get in
[1:14:45] your house even you got an exterminator
[1:14:49] they would still find a way to get
[1:14:50] around your exterminator to get inside
[1:14:52] that's just that's that's and someone's
[1:14:54] trying to have a more pleasant term
[1:14:57] palmetto bugs no roaches roaches roaches
[1:15:08] and some people afraid of roaches right
[1:15:13] amen but but that's a learn to fear you
[1:15:18] know some people afraid of the dark that
[1:15:20] that's a learned fear amen but you know
[1:15:24] that they call it a natural fear but
[1:15:25] these things that these are learned
[1:15:26] they're developed at a young age and
[1:15:29] they are influenced by our environment
[1:15:32] and our culture so these fears are
[1:15:37] influenced by our environment and our
[1:15:39] culture you know sometimes the reason
[1:15:42] you operating in fears because you're
[1:15:44] talking to people that talk fear that's
[1:15:49] the reason you respond the way you
[1:15:51] respond because you were hanging around
[1:15:53] people that talk nonsense that's that's
[1:15:58] what they feed on listen see how he said
[1:16:04] they said this that a young child isn't
[1:16:06] automatically scared of spiders but
[1:16:10] Bill's worms cues from his parents that
[1:16:14] young child see that little thing move
[1:16:16] around and float that young child is
[1:16:17] intrigued by them he might go in and try
[1:16:19] to touch the spider but because we don't
[1:16:22] just that sooner we do that we just put
[1:16:24] a fear complex on don't touch don't
[1:16:26] touch nothing like that that movie I
[1:16:30] mean but but I'd rather - boy or girl
[1:16:34] they don't have them type them don't
[1:16:36] touch anything that's moving as a young
[1:16:38] child you see young and we call it we
[1:16:41] call young girls tomboys because they do
[1:16:43] know that's just a common that's that's
[1:16:45] what's common they don't have any fear
[1:16:47] they don't know anything about that you
[1:16:49] teach them fear I thought about this you
[1:16:54] think about a child that would touch
[1:16:56] that socket with it with a metal piece
[1:16:58] that child is approaching that socket
[1:17:00] with no fear and he won't know how many
[1:17:04] of them are not electrocuted
[1:17:06] because they went there with no fear I
[1:17:09] guarantee the ones that probably got
[1:17:11] hurt is the ones that had some type of
[1:17:13] response some parent I don't do that you
[1:17:17] know and when and when you when you the
[1:17:18] way that you do it the way that you say
[1:17:20] it the way that you communicate that to
[1:17:23] him there is something that came up in
[1:17:25] them that ditch it just you know it
[1:17:27] caused that type of response but but had
[1:17:31] you not said it that way oh my god I'm
[1:17:36] preaching from from a Christians
[1:17:38] perspective
[1:17:39] Justin K I know this go on the internet
[1:17:41] and everything but from a crystal
[1:17:41] perspective that even if I have no fear
[1:17:44] my child does that I'm not that I'm
[1:17:46] going to encourage them to do it but if
[1:17:49] they did it if something happened to him
[1:17:52] I got faith to believe that I can pray
[1:17:55] for my child and God raised him up but
[1:18:00] you know a lot of time the children and
[1:18:02] never hurt because the parents are
[1:18:04] operating in fear Oh rather than going
[1:18:09] faith mode we go to panic mode we start
[1:18:14] panicking oh I can't believe oh no fear
[1:18:19] no fear you know you don't realize who
[1:18:22] you are as a child of God no fear all
[1:18:26] things work together for good to them
[1:18:28] that love God to them who are the called
[1:18:30] according to his purpose amen
[1:18:32] the environment that we had creates the
[1:18:34] fear is that the anxiety that's caused
[1:18:38] by an expectation of evil fear means
[1:18:42] that we expect evil to happen and some
[1:18:45] people you know you'll be surprised at
[1:18:47] how folk you know they talk about it so
[1:18:49] much that they created out of their own
[1:18:51] mouth they create the negative
[1:18:53] circumstance they create it out of their
[1:18:55] mouth we got to watch what we say see
[1:18:59] see they said they said hearsay a young
[1:19:02] child is an automatically scared of
[1:19:03] spiders but Bill's own cues from his
[1:19:06] parents
[1:19:07] you get evidence from your parents and
[1:19:09] your environment that you need to be
[1:19:12] scared of these things right so you get
[1:19:15] it from the people that surround you
[1:19:16] that's how fear is developed so you know
[1:19:19] here's what I
[1:19:19] to understand that fear amen from from
[1:19:24] from a biblical standpoint fear is not a
[1:19:27] natural response put up 2nd Timothy
[1:19:33] chapter 1 verse 7 2nd Timothy chapter 1
[1:19:39] verse 7 let's just I'll show you from a
[1:19:44] biblical perspective because the Bible
[1:19:48] says this but God hath not given us the
[1:19:53] spirit of fear so so what we get here is
[1:19:58] that fear is not a natural sponsz fear
[1:20:00] is a spirit whew and God did not give
[1:20:06] you that spirit only the devil will
[1:20:10] bring you the spirit of fear no matter
[1:20:12] what you going through is the devil that
[1:20:15] will try to bring fear God have not
[1:20:18] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[1:20:21] and of love of a sound mind I like that
[1:20:26] I like that I like that let's let's read
[1:20:29] another one tournament let's read Isaiah
[1:20:31] 54 Isaiah 54 so so when you know you
[1:20:36] already know when fear come they'd say
[1:20:38] no natural response it's a spirit house
[1:20:42] they're 54 and let's start here at verse
[1:20:44] 13 and we're gonna go to verse 17
[1:20:46] I just want to equip you cuz when you
[1:20:49] know we all face it we are into
[1:20:50] situations and circumstances but you
[1:20:52] know but we got to realize that our
[1:20:54] faith is greater than this look at this
[1:20:57] so the Bible says this and all of our
[1:20:59] children shall be taught of the Lord and
[1:21:01] great shall be what the peace God wants
[1:21:06] you to walk in peace amen great should
[1:21:08] be the piece of that children go on it
[1:21:10] says in righteousness now be established
[1:21:13] thou shalt be far from hello somebody if
[1:21:17] you if you're living in a state of
[1:21:20] oppression that is the devil
[1:21:23] that's not from God see since
[1:21:27] interaction shall not be established
[1:21:29] thou shalt be far from oppression for
[1:21:32] thou shalt not fear he said no should I
[1:21:41] peer in from terror because fear kind of
[1:21:45] bring them type of feelings you suck I
[1:21:46] mean your mind is just terrorized with
[1:21:49] thoughts but that's not God's intention
[1:21:52] for you say thou shalt not fear and from
[1:21:55] care for shall not come near thee let's
[1:21:58] go on the whole vation still they gather
[1:22:01] together that means it's gonna come
[1:22:04] against you but look at what he say but
[1:22:06] not by me I didn't send it I didn't
[1:22:09] bring that to you that is not from me
[1:22:13] it may gather together but not by me
[1:22:17] well it's not by him who's doing this
[1:22:22] it's Satan but not by me whosoever shall
[1:22:29] gather against me shall fall for thy
[1:22:32] sake let's keep on going
[1:22:35] heigh-ho i have created to spit that
[1:22:37] blow up the coals in the fire and that
[1:22:38] bringeth forth an instrument buzz work
[1:22:39] and I have created the waster to destroy
[1:22:42] but hold on hold on hold on hold on hold
[1:22:43] on hold on hold on hold on notice that
[1:22:46] so you know we realized that when we
[1:22:49] have these trials and tribulations
[1:22:51] that's just to refine us God's not
[1:22:54] bringing that to crush you that's
[1:22:57] actually make you stronger but
[1:23:00] understand you know I mean no matter
[1:23:02] what it is that you have in front of you
[1:23:03] know no fear no fear I refuse to talk
[1:23:07] doubt I refuse to talk defeat I refuse
[1:23:10] to be in that state coz God don't want
[1:23:12] me acting like that any time it come it
[1:23:15] didn't come from God
[1:23:17] let's go on I love this says no weapon
[1:23:22] that is formed against thee shall
[1:23:26] prosper
[1:23:27] and in every tongue that survives
[1:23:30] against the in judgment thou shalt
[1:23:32] condemn this this is the heritage of the
[1:23:39] servants of the Lord and their right
[1:23:41] just Ness is of me sayeth the Lord you
[1:23:45] know because even the devil tell you you
[1:23:47] know the reason this happened because
[1:23:48] you did that because you and so you're
[1:23:50] not righteous it's not my it's not my
[1:23:52] righteousness anyway it is his
[1:23:54] righteousness so I don't have to live in
[1:23:58] fear I don't have to live in a state of
[1:24:02] wonder what's gonna happen you know
[1:24:03] there's some statements here you know
[1:24:05] that the Prophet made about fear and I'm
[1:24:07] gonna just read them to you here as we
[1:24:08] go on who say he said if you lack
[1:24:11] confidence
[1:24:12] it'll make you fear can I say that again
[1:24:16] if you lack confidence it will create
[1:24:20] fear you got to have confidence in what
[1:24:25] God sent to you if you have any lack of
[1:24:28] confidence it's gonna create fear my God
[1:24:31] my God let you say fear is of the devil
[1:24:34] is that fear makes you weary fear makes
[1:24:39] you wander that's what fear does say the
[1:24:43] worst thing the devil can put upon you
[1:24:45] is fear that's why I told you didn't
[1:24:49] come from God I come from the devil you
[1:24:50] come from the devil so the worst thing
[1:24:52] the devil can put upon you is fear he
[1:24:54] says he says there's so much doubt and
[1:24:57] fear and trembling wondering if it will
[1:25:00] couldn't happen as long as that exists
[1:25:03] the church can never stand upright tell
[1:25:08] you what if we ever want to have some
[1:25:10] overcoming power one see some things
[1:25:11] change we're gonna have to get rid of
[1:25:13] the spirit of fear and notice it it
[1:25:15] stops saying that this is natural it's
[1:25:17] not it's a spirit fears of spirit you
[1:25:24] know these disciples you know let me
[1:25:29] I'll come back to them in a second as
[1:25:31] you know we read this on on Friday night
[1:25:35] and brother Branham made the comment
[1:25:37] says I'm made out of stuff that don't
[1:25:38] Bluff
[1:25:40] because all the devil doing is trying to
[1:25:42] bluff you and boy he gonna create a
[1:25:44] circumstances situation and his job is
[1:25:47] to bluff you and if he can Bluff you and
[1:25:49] get you to make a bad decision then he
[1:25:52] got you but when you can stand on the
[1:25:54] Word of God and say no I've done it this
[1:25:56] way I god I did exactly what you told me
[1:25:58] to do and I don't know how this thing
[1:25:59] gonna happen but I know you're gonna
[1:26:00] bring it to pass you can drive that
[1:26:03] devil right back to where he come from
[1:26:05] notice this there were many overcoming
[1:26:09] who demonstrated no fear many over
[1:26:12] comers in Scripture that demonstrated no
[1:26:14] fear and even some that I want to talk
[1:26:16] about that we're not in Scripture but
[1:26:17] these people were overcome as they
[1:26:19] demonstrated no fear they were made out
[1:26:21] of stuff that does not belong one was
[1:26:26] Moses mama when Moses mother decided to
[1:26:29] put him in the Nile River that required
[1:26:31] no fear when she made that little basket
[1:26:35] and she told her husband said look I've
[1:26:38] noticed alligators out there I know it
[1:26:40] snakes out there but I don't know what I
[1:26:43] will not allow these Egyptians to get my
[1:26:47] baby I'd rather give my baby to God and
[1:26:49] put him out there now and let God take
[1:26:51] care of and when she dropped that baby
[1:26:53] off and pushed it in the Nile that
[1:26:55] required no fear and because she had no
[1:27:01] fear the baby ends up making it all the
[1:27:05] way down the now right into the house of
[1:27:07] Pharaoh out of all the Hallows is on the
[1:27:09] Nile God directs the baby right into the
[1:27:13] house of Pharaoh and God used Pharaoh to
[1:27:16] raise his deliverer he learned all the
[1:27:21] military strategies I mean he knew it
[1:27:23] all he was the one of the wisest men in
[1:27:26] the kingdom but God allows that to
[1:27:28] happen let Pharaoh's daughter raised
[1:27:30] this man up in Pharaoh's house and a
[1:27:34] good thing about it Oh Lord God is just
[1:27:37] a good guy yo when y'all just learn to
[1:27:39] just trust God when we just learn to
[1:27:41] trust God he will do some things that'll
[1:27:43] blow our mind because she had no fear
[1:27:47] she released that child into the Nile
[1:27:49] Pharaoh's daughter gives it and I mean
[1:27:51] he'd say well I'm a raised
[1:27:53] raises this on my own because you know
[1:27:56] that Mama had a you know a love for that
[1:27:58] child even though it was not her she
[1:28:00] still had that love for that time and
[1:28:02] here here I'll hear them say you know
[1:28:04] you said she said I'm arrested but you
[1:28:05] know what I know this child requires
[1:28:08] dummy some milk don't need all this and
[1:28:11] and since my body didn't go through the
[1:28:13] process of giving birth to this child I
[1:28:14] cannot raise this child properly you say
[1:28:17] I need to find myself a nurse right and
[1:28:20] I and here you know why not look not
[1:28:22] only to Moses mom and daddy have no fear
[1:28:24] the sister had no fear because she's
[1:28:27] walking along the banks of the river
[1:28:29] watching what's happening to that baby
[1:28:32] and when she saw a man the baby make it
[1:28:35] down to Pharaoh's house she stood up
[1:28:37] real quick say you need a wet nurse I
[1:28:39] got one for you you know wet nurse you
[1:28:43] mean ain't gotta go you know it yes
[1:28:45] I know wet nurse I've got one for you oh
[1:28:48] my god so go get me a wet nurse okay
[1:28:53] went running home to mama no fear
[1:28:59] running home to mama mama guess what
[1:29:01] happened you know and he made it to that
[1:29:04] he made it to the house oh yeah just so
[1:29:07] excited to tell them to testimony say
[1:29:12] Muhammad Ali they had a job
[1:29:14] opening they need a wet nurse mama and
[1:29:21] they told me to go found one and I can
[1:29:23] think of no better person they use
[1:29:30] because the mama had no fear God since
[1:29:37] God sends her right there into the house
[1:29:39] of Pharaoh to raise up the deliverer
[1:29:42] right in the house of Pharaoh because
[1:29:45] she showed no fear no Hebrew boys made
[1:29:50] when the fire furnace they had no fear
[1:29:51] none none that's why they could speak
[1:29:54] with such a confidence and so they look
[1:29:57] kicking that we realized that our God is
[1:29:59] able to deliver us that we ain't got no
[1:30:01] doubt about that we know what God can do
[1:30:04] we never see them bring nobody out no
[1:30:07] fire before I never read that that one
[1:30:08] in the Bible before that one in the
[1:30:11] Bible they didn't ever seem that like
[1:30:13] that I what I'm trying to say that you
[1:30:15] even if the doctor told you you got
[1:30:16] something that's very rare nobody has
[1:30:19] ever had this before that gonna mean
[1:30:21] nothing that got this has just been a
[1:30:26] part of your family it's show history no
[1:30:29] it's not I'm not accepting that and then
[1:30:34] don't tell me what my family got tell me
[1:30:36] what the Bible saying right I mean we
[1:30:41] gotta stop creating these type of
[1:30:43] environments I mean the me bro boys
[1:30:48] could not look in the Bible see what God
[1:30:50] did anything like that for anybody but
[1:30:52] that your confidence was that you know
[1:30:53] what we got confidence in our God we
[1:30:55] never seen that like this but we still
[1:30:57] got confidence in I God say and here's
[1:31:00] how here's what our confidence is we're
[1:31:03] not going back no matter how loud you
[1:31:05] play this music we not down glory to God
[1:31:08] so not only that you know if I got don't
[1:31:12] deliver us we wanted to be written in
[1:31:15] your books that we did not bow that's
[1:31:19] the testimony we want to go down about
[1:31:21] us we did not bow write that and we'll
[1:31:24] sign our names to it
[1:31:25] King was upset some man he got the
[1:31:29] strongest men in his kingdom and he said
[1:31:32] now take them and throw them into the
[1:31:34] fiery furnace now you would think that
[1:31:36] fear would have probably gripped them
[1:31:38] because the strongmen that bound them
[1:31:41] and kin
[1:31:42] take them to the fire furnace the
[1:31:44] strongmen actually died because they
[1:31:48] they heated the fire up seven times
[1:31:51] hotter never been the strongest men and
[1:31:53] his team Nebuchadnezzar stealing they
[1:31:55] died maybe if the Hebrew boy somewhere
[1:31:59] oh boy maybe I should change my
[1:32:01] testimony because I just saw these guys
[1:32:03] soon as they touch the fire they died
[1:32:05] but not the Hebrew boys from no fear can
[1:32:09] you imagine that three brothers no fear
[1:32:12] maybe one of their uh fellas maybe we
[1:32:15] ought to go back on this no no no all
[1:32:17] three of them had a confidence that if
[1:32:19] God don't delivers we're going down this
[1:32:22] way
[1:32:23] goddamn air and fire not only didn't
[1:32:26] burn them they didn't every Joseph I
[1:32:28] mean just glory to God hallelujah
[1:32:31] I mean shouting and praising God and and
[1:32:34] then the King like they should be dead
[1:32:35] by now he goes up and he looks over the
[1:32:38] furnace and he it went back to the if I
[1:32:42] said now I'm no I ain't crazy I just
[1:32:45] threw three men in the fire but why is
[1:32:48] it that I see four men in there and say
[1:32:50] and one of them looked like the Son of
[1:32:53] God oh Jesus see you don't know how I
[1:32:57] got to get involved in your situation if
[1:32:59] you'll just operate with no fear say he
[1:33:05] said I believe he not they not they not
[1:33:07] they not they not dead but I mean they
[1:33:09] clothes is still the same everything I
[1:33:12] mean something wrong
[1:33:13] so get him up out the fire and they
[1:33:16] brought him up like this I told you how
[1:33:17] God is able to deliver
[1:33:18] I mean they heated up seven times hotter
[1:33:21] and it still did not touch them the
[1:33:23] devil might be trying to heat your trial
[1:33:24] up seven times hotter but as you
[1:33:28] approach approach it with no fear if God
[1:33:31] did it before he can do it again I think
[1:33:37] about David and Goliath see everybody
[1:33:39] else in the army of Israel they were
[1:33:42] afraid they were as soon as Goliath
[1:33:43] would show up everybody to take off
[1:33:45] running even saw running but one day
[1:33:48] this little shepherd boy shows up out of
[1:33:49] nowhere to bring his brother some food
[1:33:51] and and when he show up any secret I'll
[1:33:53] come saying who is that uncircumcised
[1:33:55] a person that don't have fear talks
[1:33:58] different talk different they don't talk
[1:34:06] like everybody else they don't respond
[1:34:08] to situations like everybody's they not
[1:34:11] turning around and running I'm not tall
[1:34:13] by just having courage I'm talk about no
[1:34:16] fear and see what what caused them to be
[1:34:23] that way like now this man just came
[1:34:24] talking defy the armies of the Living
[1:34:27] God say who gonna go fight this fella
[1:34:29] you look around there buddy back enough
[1:34:32] why is everybody afraid of this man no
[1:34:36] do you realize the promise that we got
[1:34:38] on outside I mean as a church we will
[1:34:41] realize greater is He that is in us then
[1:34:46] he that's in the world will stop talking
[1:34:48] the way we've been talking will stop
[1:34:53] acting the way we've been acting when we
[1:34:55] get a revelation who we are so you know
[1:34:59] you say nobody goes so he went to throw
[1:35:01] the King said look you know what I know
[1:35:02] everybody that's what their fear for
[1:35:04] their freight but but I'll go and I've
[1:35:07] King looked I'm saying are you just a
[1:35:08] little boy a little lad say this man
[1:35:10] been fighting since his youth and you
[1:35:12] know you ain't you ain't got no chance
[1:35:13] with him so he look at this they said
[1:35:15] King and this is what this is what this
[1:35:17] is what got him heaters he didn't just
[1:35:18] come out and say this at first he just
[1:35:20] said I'll fight him but then when the
[1:35:22] king went letting me say look you know
[1:35:24] there was a lion that come in to my dad
[1:35:26] a sheep and I went and got my that sheep
[1:35:28] from the lion I got and lions were no
[1:35:31] small animals these were eight-foot
[1:35:33] nine-foot animals right I willing got my
[1:35:35] dad a sheep unless you little boy
[1:35:37] Weiland got a sheep from a lion said I
[1:35:39] don't let a bear come in one time and I
[1:35:41] went and got the Sheep from the dad too
[1:35:42] now the reason he could approach the
[1:35:45] line do you realize who the lion is the
[1:35:47] king of the jungle when a lion speaks
[1:35:50] everything else shuts up I can imagine
[1:35:52] that lion roaring and they said no no no
[1:35:55] you got my daddy sheep and you want to
[1:35:57] know why David felt that way because
[1:35:59] David was taught that that it was a
[1:36:01] shame for a shepherd to lose one sheep
[1:36:07] he said we're going back home with that
[1:36:09] testimony I'm going back home saying I
[1:36:11] lost a sheep so I have to come after
[1:36:14] this lion no fear when you approached a
[1:36:17] lion no fear when he approached the bear
[1:36:19] so when it came to facing Goliath guess
[1:36:22] what no fear Church you've already faced
[1:36:26] your line you artificial bear God
[1:36:28] already brought you through that
[1:36:29] whatever you're going through right now
[1:36:31] I am convinced that he will bring you
[1:36:33] through again absolutely convinced let
[1:36:37] me read a quote of so here in the
[1:36:42] message God's Way that's been made for
[1:36:44] us God's Way that's been made for us
[1:36:49] says after through the services of this
[1:36:52] week trying to show people that there is
[1:36:55] no need of being scared the worst thing
[1:36:58] the devil can put upon you is fear right
[1:37:03] you know I mean people people make
[1:37:05] decisions parents make decisions out of
[1:37:07] fear when it comes to their children
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:12] parents make decisions out of fear
[1:37:15] they're expecting an evil result so
[1:37:19] since that you know if it's gonna be an
[1:37:20] evil result let me do this you don't
[1:37:24] have to help God out you gotta help God
[1:37:26] out right
[1:37:27] I mean God is in control so sometimes we
[1:37:30] make decisions based on fear fear is
[1:37:32] driving that decision you can tell when
[1:37:35] it's fear you watch it say not fear fear
[1:37:37] got here it's all over that decision and
[1:37:39] I'm gonna tell you something when you
[1:37:41] when you're doing things to help God out
[1:37:42] you might end up with a Ishmael
[1:37:49] and it was worse to have its name
[1:37:52] because ishm has been creating problems
[1:37:55] ever since he was born
[1:37:57] woo wait on your Isaac not to Ishmael
[1:38:04] yeah I can preach that one glow right
[1:38:11] wait man you you get yourself an inch
[1:38:13] man you watch it man he creates Rob
[1:38:16] lumps and it's done go back you know Oh
[1:38:19] Lord Jesus that means you know if
[1:38:21] someone's got some Ishmael situations we
[1:38:24] got to be honest we got in smell like
[1:38:26] situations because things that we did
[1:38:29] out of fear we made decisions out of
[1:38:33] fear and we ended up with a niche
[1:38:35] message which now we're in spell is here
[1:38:37] guess what we all got to deal with them
[1:38:39] I hope you can read between the lines
[1:38:44] when in spell is born
[1:38:46] everybody got a deal with Ishmael all
[1:38:51] right glory to God and he was still a
[1:38:54] seed of Abraham just not a part of the
[1:38:57] promised seed but he was a seat all
[1:38:59] right let me go on after through the
[1:39:02] services as weak trying to show people
[1:39:03] that there's no need of being scared the
[1:39:05] worst thing the devil can put upon you
[1:39:06] is fear even I mean if you even had a
[1:39:09] cancer and didn't feel and believe God
[1:39:13] would heal you you wouldn't be in too
[1:39:15] bad a shape God take care of that if you
[1:39:20] were sick whatever it is if you didn't
[1:39:22] fear so fear is one of the worst things
[1:39:25] that Satan can place upon the person now
[1:39:28] this week I've tried to prove out of
[1:39:30] Scripture that the man that's born again
[1:39:32] of the kingdom of God has nothing to
[1:39:35] fear
[1:39:36] you're absolutely safely secure in Jesus
[1:39:39] Christ all the father's given me he said
[1:39:42] will come to me no man could come less
[1:39:44] the father calls I mean just that
[1:39:47] scripture right I mean that that quote
[1:39:48] right there he's quoting that scripture
[1:39:50] that eyelid out or give you faith for
[1:39:52] your children wayward children nothing
[1:39:54] to fear no no no matter what you hear no
[1:39:56] fear no fear
[1:39:59] I you release them into that Nile River
[1:40:02] and watch a God bring them right back to
[1:40:04] you
[1:40:04] but don't make a fearful decision right
[1:40:09] don't make a decision out of fear you're
[1:40:10] doing you're doing it out of fear glory
[1:40:13] to God I know what I'm talking about but
[1:40:15] when you do things you compromise and
[1:40:17] you do things out of fear the devil
[1:40:19] gonna hold that against you and you're
[1:40:21] gonna use that against you you just
[1:40:23] stand in faith to wait for God to do it
[1:40:25] you can always tell when God did it
[1:40:27] amen glory to God you always know when
[1:40:31] God did it and you always know when man
[1:40:33] is doing it amen amen
[1:40:40] I'm going on you're absolutely safe
[1:40:43] safely secure in Jesus Christ all the
[1:40:45] father's giving me he said will come to
[1:40:47] me no man could come lest the father
[1:40:49] cause the father's got to leave him up
[1:40:51] to me and he that comes to me I will in
[1:40:54] no wise cast out and all no man can
[1:40:56] pluck them out of my father said no man
[1:40:58] is greater than he is he that heareth my
[1:41:01] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:41:03] hath everlasting life shall not come
[1:41:06] into condemnation but it's past from
[1:41:08] life from death unto life he that eats
[1:41:11] my flesh and drinks my blood hath will
[1:41:13] not will have but half present-tense
[1:41:15] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:41:18] at the last day wherefore grieve not the
[1:41:20] Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[1:41:22] unto the day of your redemption there
[1:41:24] you are still the way until the day of
[1:41:25] redemption not just from one revival to
[1:41:28] another but until the day of your
[1:41:31] Redemption brother Branham again clearly
[1:41:33] told us that the worst thing that the
[1:41:35] devil can put on us is fear do not make
[1:41:38] decisions out of fear God did not give
[1:41:42] you the spirit of fear but of love power
[1:41:46] and a sound mind you can make sound
[1:41:49] decisions when you're not operating in
[1:41:51] fear there's one quote brother I
[1:41:56] wouldn't read the whole thing but he
[1:41:57] said it's a lady was in a prayer line
[1:41:59] and he was looking at these people and
[1:42:01] he was praying for different ones
[1:42:02] calling out different situations one
[1:42:04] since that female trouble you know and
[1:42:06] he was calling out their names
[1:42:07] everything then he said hey it's the
[1:42:08] ladies standing there
[1:42:10] suffering with a fear a complex of fear
[1:42:13] sits upon her if that's right reasonably
[1:42:16] handling I write the fears going you can
[1:42:18] go home and be well I challenge you to
[1:42:19] believe the lady was suffering with fear
[1:42:21] just she had a complex of fear Satan can
[1:42:26] put that on us and and again that type
[1:42:28] of stuff will drive us to do things that
[1:42:29] we've never intended to do just know it
[1:42:33] didn't come from God it does not come
[1:42:36] from God all right
[1:42:38] these these brothers these disciples out
[1:42:42] here in on the sea they had something
[1:42:46] you would think that it was a very
[1:42:47] natural tendency to be afraid because of
[1:42:50] their condition they were waterlogged
[1:42:52] their ship was waterlogged and here they
[1:42:54] are you know in a situation their cells
[1:42:57] are broken their oars were gone and
[1:42:59] brother Branham say they're holding one
[1:43:00] another and they're screaming and as
[1:43:02] they're as they're in this situation
[1:43:04] been there for probably quite a few
[1:43:05] hours here comes Jesus walking right out
[1:43:08] on the water right towards them now
[1:43:10] after they finish testifying about him
[1:43:12] speaking about them fear has got I have
[1:43:15] some na I mean in a strong grip but here
[1:43:18] you know they look at it and arm and
[1:43:20] when Jesus you know when when they cried
[1:43:22] out if you'd like like like Jesus up you
[1:43:24] know it pretty much is that really you
[1:43:26] and say it is I be a good cheer
[1:43:28] and as I stopped being afraid be of good
[1:43:30] cheer change attitude in his I hear he
[1:43:35] says it is I believe says be not afraid
[1:43:37] to him be not afraid
[1:43:39] stop operating the fear stop walking in
[1:43:40] fear it is I now that the disciples like
[1:43:43] now I've never seen anybody walk on
[1:43:46] water especially in a storm like this
[1:43:47] I've never seen anything like this how
[1:43:49] can this really be Jesus that's when
[1:43:52] Peter steps steps up and says Lord if it
[1:43:55] really be thou if it really be thou bid
[1:44:00] me to come unto thee and when he says he
[1:44:04] says well you know and I love Jesus
[1:44:06] he's not giving a paragraph he not
[1:44:08] giving a quote he not giving nothing but
[1:44:11] one word come and Peter has to get down
[1:44:16] on that boat and I can search others see
[1:44:19] me getting down out the boat and as it
[1:44:21] get down out the boat and maybe
[1:44:23] trying to manage this don't really hold
[1:44:25] me like you know what would you know
[1:44:27] what what's going on it gets at him
[1:44:29] maybe one foot cuz you can't jump out
[1:44:32] with both feet just just one foot just
[1:44:33] then he's like man this this stuff is
[1:44:35] holding me you Peter Brown the other
[1:44:38] foot down he start walking and when he
[1:44:42] walks now he starts sinking the only
[1:44:46] thing that changed from here to here is
[1:44:48] that he took his eyes off Jesus he got
[1:44:52] his eyes more on the condition than on
[1:44:55] his Savior take your eyes off your
[1:44:57] condition and keep it on your promise
[1:44:59] and whatever you're facing no fear
[1:45:07] because God had sent fear to you that
[1:45:10] the scientists would want you to believe
[1:45:11] that's natural no that's a spirit that's
[1:45:15] what the Bible tells us and God did not
[1:45:17] stick God didn't give us a spirit of
[1:45:19] fear I'm so glad that Peter you know
[1:45:23] when I look at him and see that he was
[1:45:25] able to walk in that water a man born
[1:45:26] the same way the rest of us are born it
[1:45:28] tells us that if we didn't operate in
[1:45:30] fear what God could do in and through us
[1:45:33] if we just got rid of fear listen at
[1:45:39] some of this region a few things
[1:45:42] oh the gospel God projected his love the
[1:45:52] Prophet says this that love that God
[1:45:54] love is a powerful force it says and
[1:45:58] when love is projected and it comes to
[1:46:00] the end of its strength Sovereign Grace
[1:46:01] we'll take it up from there and project
[1:46:03] the object that love has asked for
[1:46:05] listen and when love is projected and it
[1:46:09] comes to the end of its strength love
[1:46:12] come to the end of its strength
[1:46:14] Sovereign Grace we'll take it up from
[1:46:17] there and project the object that love
[1:46:20] is asked for I want to read that again
[1:46:22] when love is projected not fear y'all
[1:46:25] but when love is projected and it
[1:46:27] compliment and of its strength sovereign
[1:46:30] grace we'll take it up from there and
[1:46:33] project the object that love is actual
[1:46:36] so sometimes your love would be
[1:46:37] challenged especially in family
[1:46:39] situations you'll love it be challenged
[1:46:41] but when you've done everything that you
[1:46:42] you know you were supposed to do
[1:46:44] according to the Word of God
[1:46:45] you'll love it when it when it reaches
[1:46:47] the end let sovereign grace come in
[1:46:50] it'll take it out from there and project
[1:46:54] the object that lovers
[1:46:55] asked for if your love is asking for God
[1:46:57] to give it to you you're fearing gonna
[1:46:59] get nothing from God but you love to get
[1:47:02] everything from God listen he says
[1:47:04] that's the reason we have a Savior
[1:47:06] tonight is because God so loved the
[1:47:07] world that his love being projected to
[1:47:09] the world produces Savior God wanted to
[1:47:11] see see you well so much his love went
[1:47:14] out and produced an atonement for your
[1:47:17] sickness as your as your sins it was the
[1:47:20] love of God that constrained him to do
[1:47:22] it love is a powerful force Lota's
[1:47:25] notice this it'll run a woman a mother
[1:47:27] right into the flames of fire after her
[1:47:30] baby now you just just think about that
[1:47:32] statement because if a mother had a baby
[1:47:34] now most women would run from the fire
[1:47:36] but if her baby was inside the fire she
[1:47:40] has she overcomes to fear the fire runs
[1:47:42] right through the fire to get that baby
[1:47:45] that's what that's the CCC you know love
[1:47:48] overcomes fear and we don't read that
[1:47:50] the Bible says there's well the Bible
[1:47:52] says there's no fear in love but perfect
[1:47:53] love casteth out fear a man because
[1:47:57] because fear hath torment he that
[1:47:59] feareth is not made perfect in love
[1:48:01] that's first John 4:18 look at this he
[1:48:03] goes on love is a powerful powerful
[1:48:04] force it'll run a woman a mother right
[1:48:07] into the flames of fire after a baby if
[1:48:09] she knows she's plunging herself to
[1:48:12] death there's nothing more strong than
[1:48:14] love love will make you trust you might
[1:48:17] go and and know that you belong to the
[1:48:19] greatest church in all the provinces of
[1:48:21] Canada you might know that you're to try
[1:48:23] to remember the greatest greatest church
[1:48:25] in the nation and then you would do
[1:48:27] things that you would not do if you
[1:48:29] belong to a little mission somewhere in
[1:48:31] some corner and have the love of God in
[1:48:33] your heart love has no fear love casts
[1:48:39] out fear and I notice am i meeting so
[1:48:42] much that when when when I come into the
[1:48:44] people one of the great things I find
[1:48:47] among them is fear and what
[1:48:50] fear is a lack of confidence that's why
[1:48:55] that's just bottom line we don't have
[1:48:56] confidence that God or do what he said
[1:48:58] he'll do we don't have that type of
[1:49:00] confidence we always feel like we gotta
[1:49:02] help him out let me tell you some God
[1:49:05] don't need your help you've been doing
[1:49:06] this for a long time a lot longer than
[1:49:09] any of us ever been here and will ever
[1:49:11] be here God know exactly how to handle
[1:49:13] it's not less not trying to help him out
[1:49:15] let's just let God be God amen Church
[1:49:19] listen if you lack confidence
[1:49:21] it'll make you fear but if you love it
[1:49:24] cast away that fear and that's the way
[1:49:27] God wants his church not so many not
[1:49:29] something that's as charter members he
[1:49:31] wants members that's loyal and loves and
[1:49:34] believes and has confidence in him all
[1:49:39] right let me read this out of the way to
[1:49:41] have fellowship this is gonna be a
[1:49:43] rather long quote but I want to just
[1:49:45] kind of set this up brother Browns gonna
[1:49:47] show us how and a time in his life where
[1:49:51] it would have been so normal for him to
[1:49:54] have fear it would have been so normal
[1:49:56] for him to have fear but rather than
[1:49:59] half fear he said he said something came
[1:50:03] over him right he say something happened
[1:50:05] and say and that's what we're all
[1:50:08] looking for is for that something
[1:50:09] happening you know
[1:50:11] David Livingstone he was a man that kind
[1:50:15] of went all over South I mean all over
[1:50:17] Africa just kind of taking the gospel he
[1:50:19] was a missionary said one time he'd come
[1:50:21] in contact with a lion and when he come
[1:50:24] in contact with this lion you know his
[1:50:28] he knew that that lion would pretty much
[1:50:30] destroy him so what people do when they
[1:50:32] get when they when they when they in
[1:50:34] fight-or-flight mode because when fear
[1:50:38] fear comes upon you either enter into
[1:50:39] two rims either fight or flight either
[1:50:41] gonna stand up you're gonna fight or
[1:50:42] you're gonna you're gonna kind of go
[1:50:45] into flight mode and what this man did
[1:50:46] you run from it but what this man did he
[1:50:48] decided to play dead right Here Come his
[1:50:52] lion and and he say you know he act like
[1:50:55] he was dead and and that lion come over
[1:50:57] there and picked him up with one paw and
[1:50:59] pretty much just starts swinging him
[1:51:01] around but why he was thinking the man
[1:51:03] man just kind of lost consciousness
[1:51:05] within himself when he played there and
[1:51:07] in the lion like you know this thing
[1:51:09] ain't moving it ain't no fun if it ain't
[1:51:11] gonna move it ain't no fun at all
[1:51:14] everything I move so the lion just
[1:51:15] dropped him and went running after the
[1:51:17] men that were moving and his life was
[1:51:20] fair because he played that he played
[1:51:22] that part not gonna tell you to go out
[1:51:24] there and with a lion and try to act
[1:51:26] like you did no stand up if you can fell
[1:51:28] in front of the line like that be like
[1:51:29] David glory to God take your stone and
[1:51:32] throw them and take them out amen or use
[1:51:35] the spoken word that you got power
[1:51:37] amen and put that line in this place
[1:51:38] that's what you're supposed to do hey
[1:51:41] man that's what God that's what that
[1:51:43] when Jesus went to the cross that's what
[1:51:45] the cross produced
[1:51:46] dominion over these things can I go a
[1:51:48] little further you know just this story
[1:51:51] comes to mind this pastor was telling me
[1:51:54] I was over in Zimbabwe and the pass was
[1:51:59] telling me how they go lion hunting and
[1:52:02] you know one time he went lion hunting
[1:52:05] and and as they're out there he says
[1:52:08] they were you know their state they shot
[1:52:10] a lion and and when they shot the lion
[1:52:14] they they took off running because you
[1:52:17] know they thought the lion would you
[1:52:18] know kind of come out them being wounded
[1:52:20] and upset so if they took off running
[1:52:23] they ran so far then and then they went
[1:52:25] but they did they start tracking the
[1:52:26] blood so they turn around say okay we're
[1:52:29] gonna go get that lion now let's go get
[1:52:30] him we've taken him home this one our
[1:52:32] trophies and they went they start
[1:52:33] tracking the lion you know and and when
[1:52:37] they got you know where the blood was
[1:52:38] going they got around a little corner
[1:52:40] here and when they got to the corner say
[1:52:42] that lion should be right around this
[1:52:43] corner cuz man this blood get thicker
[1:52:45] and thicker he should be around here
[1:52:46] when they got around that corner that
[1:52:48] lying one there but another one was and
[1:52:57] the other one was there he looked at the
[1:53:00] other brothers and and and all of them
[1:53:04] just took off running and he said to
[1:53:06] himself state now ahold of them was
[1:53:08] smaller than me so I had a great feeling
[1:53:11] that I'd be the one that the lion would
[1:53:13] get and said as he was running he could
[1:53:15] just feel it he could just already
[1:53:17] feel it that that line was urine take
[1:53:19] that Paul and just take him right down
[1:53:21] to the ground he felt it coming he
[1:53:23] thought it was gonna happen
[1:53:24] fear was making that happen to him but
[1:53:26] before you know he said he looked around
[1:53:28] say that line didn't come and when they
[1:53:30] realized what had happened say the line
[1:53:32] was just afraid of him just as afraid of
[1:53:34] him as they were afraid of the line so
[1:53:36] when it took off running the lion took
[1:53:37] off running but fear would cause you to
[1:53:43] do some tremendous things fear fear fear
[1:53:46] fear fear fear Oh God
[1:53:50] we need to overcome that look at this
[1:53:53] brother branham is talking about
[1:53:54] something yeah he had a situation where
[1:53:57] he faced a killer bull and we're gonna
[1:54:00] read about that and I bring this to a
[1:54:02] close here today a man this killer bull
[1:54:04] but he says this is the way to have
[1:54:06] fellowship he says that's the trouble
[1:54:07] with man tonight that's what's the
[1:54:09] trouble with people tonight you're
[1:54:11] scared the biggest curse there is on the
[1:54:14] full gospel people or any other people
[1:54:16] because they are afraid God has made the
[1:54:20] provision but you're afraid to take his
[1:54:22] word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight
[1:54:24] why you would take your healing by faith
[1:54:27] and know that God had promised it and
[1:54:30] the thing would just go plum away from
[1:54:33] you
[1:54:34] y'all get if you aren't afraid you take
[1:54:36] your healing by faith and the thing
[1:54:37] would go plum away from you
[1:54:39] says afraid scare and I've noticed it
[1:54:42] and that's the reason I'm such a
[1:54:43] believer in healing I know that if you
[1:54:45] can get away from that scare and get
[1:54:47] love in its place something's going to
[1:54:49] happen there's only two faculties that
[1:54:51] govenor human and one of them is faith
[1:54:53] which brings results in the other is
[1:54:55] fear which has no value in it at all
[1:54:58] faith is of God fear is of the devil
[1:55:02] deer makes you weary fear makes you
[1:55:05] wonder and if I was going to die in the
[1:55:07] morning what good would it would it do
[1:55:09] to me - get off stood up about it what
[1:55:11] if I was going are gonna be electrocuted
[1:55:13] in the morning and my life had to end
[1:55:15] tomorrow morning what good would that do
[1:55:18] me to worry about it so when you say
[1:55:20] what good would it do to have faith
[1:55:22] faith consign my pardon sure there's
[1:55:26] value in faith
[1:55:28] don't be weary
[1:55:30] don't be scared don't be upset just have
[1:55:33] faith and belief and the only way you
[1:55:36] can have faith you have to have love
[1:55:38] first y'all get that the only way you
[1:55:43] can have faith you gotta have love first
[1:55:46] for love produces the perfect love get
[1:55:52] it perfect love casts all cows casts out
[1:55:54] all fear wish I had time to tell you
[1:55:56] experiences with wildlife of what I've
[1:55:58] seen conquered by faith by love I told
[1:56:02] you the other night about the old
[1:56:03] opossum being sent up I've seen a
[1:56:05] vicious bull one day was going to kill
[1:56:08] me this is on record I was a game warden
[1:56:10] at the time I was going over the hill to
[1:56:12] pray for a sick man and we're supposed
[1:56:14] to pack a gun but you wouldn't go go to
[1:56:17] pray for a sick man with a gun on your
[1:56:19] hand right so I took the gun and laid it
[1:56:22] in a little ol truck now he wasn't
[1:56:24] thinking just took the gun and just
[1:56:26] later on the truck says it crossed over
[1:56:28] over through the field and I was way out
[1:56:31] in the field and I knew I had a thought
[1:56:33] that this killer bull was out there he
[1:56:35] just killed a colored man on a farm mr.
[1:56:37] Burke's just about three months before
[1:56:39] that and they sold him up up there to to
[1:56:42] the people that had these Durham cattle
[1:56:44] and then when I started across the field
[1:56:47] right out in a big open field the way to
[1:56:51] have fellowship I'm a paragraph e28 it
[1:56:57] says and then when I cross when I start
[1:57:01] across the field right out and a big
[1:57:03] open field and not over about 30 yards
[1:57:06] from me this big fella raised up threw
[1:57:09] his horns down let out a big big bellow
[1:57:13] and if you know what I'm talking about
[1:57:16] and there he was horns about like this
[1:57:19] and here he come
[1:57:20] at first it scared me see it was fear I
[1:57:24] look for a tree and there wasn't any
[1:57:27] tree and I know he could outrun me to
[1:57:29] the fence so I thought well this is it
[1:57:34] says so then something happened see the
[1:57:39] spirit of fear will come first
[1:57:41] and if you accept the spirit of fear you
[1:57:45] probably do good as dead that's it
[1:57:47] that's you know where I ain't gonna get
[1:57:48] a chance to call this one tell them by
[1:57:50] angle you know just you can't operate
[1:57:54] like that but let they say say but then
[1:57:57] something something happened oh god if
[1:58:00] that would only stay there instead of
[1:58:02] going away I need that too whatever
[1:58:06] that's something that happened to the
[1:58:07] Prophet
[1:58:08] I need that happening to me all the time
[1:58:10] if it only stay there and never go away
[1:58:14] so if something happened I wish God
[1:58:17] would let it happen everybody here
[1:58:18] tonight just long enough to get he'll
[1:58:21] see something happened and I wasn't
[1:58:23] scared of the bull I felt sorry because
[1:58:27] I disturbed him I was in his field he
[1:58:30] was laying out there by not bothering me
[1:58:33] I come along and woke him up and so I
[1:58:36] felt sorry for him now you can't Bluff
[1:58:38] it so you got to be made out of stuff
[1:58:40] that does not Bluff now you can't Bluff
[1:58:44] it it has to be there that's the way
[1:58:49] faith is you can't Bluff you've got to
[1:58:51] really have it the devil will know it
[1:58:53] and this fellow started towards me with
[1:58:55] his head down just as hard as he could I
[1:58:57] wasn't no more afraid of that bull then
[1:59:00] then I would be if any of my dear
[1:59:02] brothers and sisters standing on this
[1:59:04] platform and he run within about 5 feet
[1:59:06] of me and he stopped he looked at me so
[1:59:08] depleted he looked right and left
[1:59:11] I said fella I'm sorry I disturbed you I
[1:59:14] said I know you're God's creature and
[1:59:17] I'm God's servant now the Creator that
[1:59:19] made you made me and I am his servant
[1:59:22] I'm on my journey across the hill to
[1:59:25] pray for one of his sick children if I
[1:59:26] know you've been laying there I wouldn't
[1:59:29] have come by and disturbed you
[1:59:31] so now the name of Jesus Christ the
[1:59:33] Creator go back and lay down who says
[1:59:39] that a judgment bar you'll see it
[1:59:42] brought into life that bull looked at me
[1:59:44] a few minutes turned around walked over
[1:59:47] and laid down and I stood there the
[1:59:50] tears running down my cheeks I walked
[1:59:52] within 5 foot of that bull
[1:59:54] and he never even turned his head and
[1:59:56] looked at me why instead of hating him I
[1:59:59] loved him love will conquer anything
[2:00:02] right that's what that's what conquered
[2:00:06] my heart when I know that God so loved
[2:00:08] me that He gave His only begotten Son
[2:00:11] that I wouldn't have to perish note that
[2:00:14] I was born in this world of sinner and
[2:00:16] was perishing and God loved me that it
[2:00:18] gave His Son offer my life to be
[2:00:20] redeemed and then I couldn't hate no
[2:00:22] more I had to love that's what brings
[2:00:25] these results that you see it's love
[2:00:31] I'll tell you the prophets say something
[2:00:33] just came over him something happened he
[2:00:36] don't know what what it was he said he
[2:00:37] said I just wish I could have that
[2:00:39] happen to me all the time say I wish
[2:00:40] that can just happen to everybody right
[2:00:43] no fear right that's that's best that's
[2:00:46] kind of what happened you know they even
[2:00:47] tell you that even when it comes to you
[2:00:49] know most feared dogs we've been running
[2:00:51] from run you see the first dog you just
[2:00:54] take off front you know what that dog
[2:00:55] would just keep chasing you not only
[2:00:58] will it keep chasing you every time you

[2:01:02] scent and it know you coming and soon as
[2:01:06] they so they know you can just go to

[2:01:15] there's a dog we got running no fear
[2:01:19] brother Brandon one time I mean they had

[2:01:58] food he's nowhere to come back even even
[2:02:00] alligators get tamed by humans it's just

[2:05:24] you believe with one Accord one Accord
[2:05:26] every one of you amen
[2:05:29] let's have word of Prayer father we were
[2:05:36] challenged by your word there are
[2:05:39] different situations that we all face
[2:05:41] there different things that we go
[2:05:43] through and God we we need to know that
[2:05:46] it fear comes from the devil decisions
[2:05:49] that are being made they've been made
[2:05:51] out of fear and that's that's not your
[2:05:54] wheel Lord for us to do it that way
[2:05:55] we're wondering we don't have confidence
[2:05:57] in your word we don't have confidence in
[2:05:59] your promise so we do things to try to
[2:06:01] help you out god help us to take our
[2:06:03] hands off of it to release it into the
[2:06:06] Nile River and allow you God just to
[2:06:09] have complete authority and control over
[2:06:12] the situation let us not make bad
[2:06:14] decisions Lord we do it out of fear we
[2:06:19] don't want to be alone so we make a bad
[2:06:21] decision we don't want this so we make a
[2:06:23] bad decision god don't don't let us
[2:06:25] proce things that way let us do it
[2:06:26] father because your word is showing us
[2:06:29] how to approach God there's so many
[2:06:33] people that have some really rough
[2:06:34] situations because of what they've done
[2:06:36] we create the Ishmael's in our own life
[2:06:39] just as Sarah and Abraham they've tried
[2:06:43] to help you out you told that they were
[2:06:44] gonna have a promise son you just didn't
[2:06:46] tell them win and God since they
[2:06:49] couldn't wait patiently for you they did
[2:06:51] what they could to help you to assist
[2:06:53] you in the process
[2:06:54] and God look at what it led to problems
[2:06:58] still today because of that decision Eve
[2:07:04] God she did things made bad decisions
[2:07:06] and Lord Adam made bad decisions and God
[2:07:10] we don't we can learn from these these
[2:07:11] these circumstances these situations we
[2:07:13] can learn from that help us look God
[2:07:16] just just completely and totally trust
[2:07:19] you
[2:07:19] turn our faith towards you Jesus and God
[2:07:26] whatever it is that we're facing
[2:07:27] whenever it is help us Lord to realize
[2:07:29] the fear is not something natural but
[2:07:32] fear is a spirit that comes from the
[2:07:34] enemy and anytime it's coming in our
[2:07:37] direction any thought of it any any any
[2:07:40] part of it god help us to to realize we
[2:07:42] got the power to bind and loose and if
[2:07:45] we would exercise and that power we
[2:07:47] would see you manifest yourself the way
[2:07:50] that you said you were let us be true
