========================================

despite all of the trials and tribulations that we go abroad drew made Lord God well we thank you for or father copy thank you Lord God this evening for an opportunity old father God Sydnor that defeated the cross so father God we favor elevated father God understand give us a revelation about of who you are father God we are we have a deeper love for you or father God we ask these blessings so father asked you to bless those that have an arrival father God is still fighting the dangers hi where's the father God give them traveling mercies and fun and it's good to be with us or God Jesus you may be seated I'm not gonna be real before you too long I like what you did grab your Bibles we're gonna start a man at Joelle chapter 2 and we're gonna kind of teach on the loose subject on those that four-stage insect a man that uh Joelle talked about there in chapter 2 I start will read starting from verse 1 amen the word of the Lord that game to Joe well son of Bethuel hear this ye old man and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land have this been in your day or even in the days of your father's tell you you're children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation for that which the palmer worm has left hath the locusts eaten and that which the locusts have left has the cankerworm eaten and that which the canker has left the caterpillar has eaten amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of the word we just want to look a man where we're going to be going to kind of stay right keep our Bibles closed because we gonna continue to look at a few things a man in need in the message restoration of the Briah tree the Prophet brought out that four-stage beast that forced agency and how that insect sort of just ate away in the church and I want you to realize and understand that the same way he eats away at the churches the same way he destroys the individual because he is constructed the same way God doesn't change his mind he built the church the same way he builds the individual a man so we want to take a first look at this pama worm but before we do that let's let's go over to mark the fourth chapter mark the fourth chapter to make sure that that's what I want to see yes mark the fourth chapter unless we're going to we're gonna read that and then we're going to do something just a little bit different we'll start at verse verse three here behold there went out a sword to sew and it came to pass as a soul some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up but it had no depth of earth but when the Sun was up it was scorched a man and because it had no root it withered away some fell among thorns and and the thorns grew up and choked it out and it yielded no fruit and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit it some fell on Good Friday did yield fruit and sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some hundredfold and he said unto them he that hath an ear let him hear he that hath ears to hear let him hear a man and he says and when he was alone where about him with the twelve they asked him when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve axed of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto that are without all things all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven right so I want you to look at something very important here Jesus were preaching and he and he gave this this this in a parable but here in verse 10 what was it was it was important here was when the disciples got him alone they asked him they asked him what does this mean and he said unto you a man I give to you to know the mystery now the point that I'm trying to bring out in inverse T and alone that if you have a question all you have to do is ask him it's his good will to give you the understanding and the revelation but the problem that a lot of people have is they'll hear something that don't sound quite familiar to them or hear something that they've never heard before and not being able to go into the presence of the Lord when they're alone here's something preached from the platform here's something and immediately what they do I've never heard that before so they discard it but instead going to your secret place where you are alone with God and just ask him to give you the mystery amen and that's what these men did and he said unto you but look at it he said I proceeded into those people them seen they may see and not proceed hearing they may hear see because this is the way he hide the things from the wise and the prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn amen and he goes on and say les at any time they be converted Amen convert it means that they're changed their ways amen they they turn 100 native degrees and begin to travel in another direction and begin to ask him and their sins are forgiven then he'll give them the note of mistress but we see so many people they hear something new here something that they've acquired on't understand and what they do or immediately discard it because it's foreign to them instead of going to Christ going down on their knees asking the Lord to reveal it to them because we'll give into that a little bit more but we're going to start here with this palmer worm a man and what i want to do is i'm going to take these same scriptures here from chapter 4 starting here at the eighth verse and we're gonna kind of take each verse we're gonna take it but we're gonna go backwards hey man we're gonna go backwards a little bit so we start here at first he says some seed fell on good ground amen when the seed fell on good ground it grew up a menace started at a seed and and it grew up to a young tree and this tree was a healthy tree amen like David said we shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of running water amen our lives are not wizzard a man so it grown up to be a healthy tree and free it'd be bad if you turn over to Galatians two fifth chapter let's look at Galatians the fifth chapter at the 22nd first starting at the 22nd verse he tells us what the fruit is on the tree but the fruit let's look at it here the first fruit but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law now the first fruit on the tree Amen we see it's love okay we see is love and that parler one if we go to the message restoration of the pariah tree a man we're going to start at paragraph that I believe is 200 amen well hold that sister hold that because it's actually at another place and I did mark down the paragraph on that one right there but what I want you to see here is the in the in the message here the process say the first fruit that that Pawar began to eat a man is love that's the first fruit on the tree so Apollo worm Apollo worm is like a flying insect sort of like a moth it is a very small insect and III googled it and I wish I had the ability to computer-savvy mister baby to have it up there so you can see the picture of it but it's like a Moulton just like the Prophet said it has two horns like two horns there but it's a flying insect but it's very fragile very very you know how am off if you ever kill them off it's like nothing to it it's it's not like dust and but that's what is since eight beers so this little innocent small insect comes in and he begins to eat away at the fruit he starts with love he begins to eat away at the fruit for the love of your brother and sister he begins to eat away at the fruit for your love of the gospel he begins to eat at the fruit for your love for the word for your love that's general amen he begins to eat at that fruit the next fruit on the tree amen in Galatians there what did you have it there I've got to go back and forth from my Bible keep your Bible saying I wish I can hold both sections at one time and I might be able to figure that out I got some tassels or something here's someone the next fruit on the tree is what is it a man the next threw that on the tree he'd go after his joy take away the joy of your salvation now not now not now I can attest to these things it is so subtle it is so subtle because when when the devil is attacking you he has a plan he has a methodology of attack and he began to slowly eat away at these fruit that this healthy tree it's been love the joy he takes away the joy of your salvation you begin you begin to well if I make it the church fine if I don't make it it's all good he began to eat away at you joy he is wearing you down little by little and see the keen bang of the devil is that he he's not going to I'll let you all at one time and just try to say no the Prophet told a story about the Frog they put him in lukewarm water and then slowly raised the temperature hey man now I want you to understand another thing here in the in the message I have it there our sister the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 68 he says when the great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a mission of clinic meeting place selected for the battle and for the battle to rage and that battle ground begins in the human mind so these things that that the devil that needs this pond the worm this little flying insects so to speak it's the devil who rose like a rolling lion but he come as this little four stage bug this flying insect which is nothing if we attack him as an insect we just shoo them away we start feeling those negative feelings I'm losing the love what the prophet said how do we keep the love for Allah for the word the law for follow for fulfill for God read the word and pray every day it's just like any relationship you have to nurture that relationship through communication amen and communication as I say before goes both ways you can't just come to church and hear God speak to you and you had no time talk to him okay so that's how this little book this little insect this little cuny most type in say begins to just eat away at the fruit then II the next one I believe is peace is it in Galatians their take away your peace of mind you begin to get frustrated with things that's going on you begin to start picking out things he's pointing out things to you but I don't like this I don't like that and you began to get spiritually frustrated you may go and you say I don't feel I'm getting fear no more that's up to you you know you begin to get frustrated with everything you can seem to find no peace here frustrates you at every turn what is it that mall when you begin to feel these things oh just don't feel the love like I used to I just don't have the joy like I used to it's a little more tight bug eating away at the fruit now they're always gonna be there probably said we're gonna fight till we get out of here so what moth is always gonna be there but all it takes is shoo shoo get away I rebuke you in Jesus name I'm not gonna feel that way it's a mind battle it's just in the mind it's not your fault it's the devil planning that soul in your mind if you reason with it you'll go to the next stage amen now let's let's let's move on we're still here we're gonna we're gonna continue from Martin amen yeah I got it here now we started with this healthy tree here amen amen and eight now we're gonna go backwards and we're gonna go to and some fell on thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit and I see now this this this stage of the tree ain't even no fruit on it hey man because it didn't get to that point to where it begin to yield fruit let's go to a man that next beef that next insect or the next stage of that insect go to restoration of the Briah tree paragraph 22 amen the next stage of that insect was the locust hey man now the prophecy what does the locust do the locust eats away at the leaves of this tree eats away at believes he takes away the leaves now what does it look destroys the leaves he destroys divine fellowship he says one of the leaves do he said it makes it cool where the birds can fly up front of the leaves and cool off there was a there was that tree again now I want you to notice that when in in the beginning when Adam and Eve where would they meet God under the tree in the coolness of the evening under the shade of a tree go to the message what here starry larger 5906 oh nine twelve pair paragraph 12 bring that up amen what here sterilizer 5906 Oh nein okay can you move down go go up stop right there I think you went too far no no other way I'm sorry stop right now I can go forever but it goes to show that when God's doing something Satan is always present to block it or to tear it down amen or do what he can to interrupt it now it's this fourth day fees and so it's an insect but we know this is the deal okay he was worn out talking about Elijah worn out his nerves all on edge all on edge and just like people today we need a juniper tree a man he preached he was tired and nervous and people pray they're so nervous and it's all nervous and neurotic and upset the world right now we're living in everybody just on edge as to say or to speak like it's just any little thing so upsets them God's people is that way the world of the world is that way we all need a juniper tree a place to rest a trust that the convention will be a juniper tree I like that trust that the convention will be a juniper tree a man we have meetings coming up I trust that few tired and you're weary and and and you need a little rest that you find rest up under the juniper tree that Christ that tree a man of of life amen amen can you can can get up under that tree and cool off and he can like he did Elijah there just speak to you under the juniper tree give you strength to go on under the juniper tree but what is dude locus he comes to eat away at the fellowship and when I like how he's talking about there he's talking about the convention manager to Petrine but he takes away your fellowship you don't even come that's you Joan up a tree the leaves the widest locust is eating away at believes taken away your fellowship you have no fellowship with Christ you have no fellowship with God you have no fellowship with your brothers and sisters why because that first stage visas ain't away at the love the joy and the peace now he's taking my way to fellowship you see how this goes again in your mind that's where the battle begins in the mind amen now he goes on well we'll continue here in the restoration of the bride tree makes it cool the birds fly up under now I'll move on where people could come and sat down under the fellowship of the holy spirit of cool off the bit where all the frustration and don't know what happened and whether you die or whether you're saved or not you don't know whether this church is right well that church is right just come down under the tree that's got some leaves on it sit down there while let the winds from heaven blow like the mighty rushing wind through the leaves and begin to cool you off a little bit amen see that beast begins to take away a man the leaves of fellowship the locust has done Amen the locust has eaten his name was Satan in heavenly places what is it coolness comfort feeling at home I like we was in prayer last night and I guess my brother Quentin he volunteers at the hospital then I guess he had a chance to hold his little baby and he was talking about it just last night in his and that baby felt comfortable he said he held a baby for hours and that baby just fell asleep as he's holding that baby that baby felt safe that baby felt protected that baby felt that he was he was comfortable a man just kind of resting in in my brother's arms there and I and it must have did something to him a man has had done something that paper and that baby was able to just rest that's where we should be under the juniper tree the leaves of fellowship find comfort peace where were able to just rest under the Shekinah glory be fair daugther the beau juniper tree rest in the arms of God but you see that that BC wants to eat away at that fellowship wants to keep you out of church wants to keep you away the Prophet was saying that was the mistake that that rich young ruler me he said he was had so many earthly Goods that he felt like Jesus asked him to cut sell all your stuff and come follow me but no doubt that he was a was a part of a great businessman association and he didn't want to lose his fellowship see they'd ever give you an another fellowship that does nothing for you amen so we got to watch that beast my brothers and sisters so when you begin to feel that way in you in the mind that doubles telling you you know what it is you know exactly what it is and you rebuke that devil then move on the next stage he says this little ol cankerworm this can't go wrong and what does the cankerworm do the cankerworm goes after the bark of that tree let's go and look at this again here we're in mark for this locust it says here and others fell on good ground and did I'm sorry go back to 7 and some fell on amongst thorns and thistles and they grew up and choked it out and they producing no fruit not sick but when the Sun come up its scorched it because the root and it wizzard away and some fell on stony ground and not had much earth I'm reading this backwards stone the ground and not had much earth and immediately it spring up because it had no depth of earth but when the Sun come up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away now the next stage of that beast we see we're eating away at this tree God planted this tree and you should be see how some know the seeds fell here somebody sees Fred there but we started from a healthy tree and we see how he's taking it all the way down hey man now some didn't make it to a healthy tree some didn't make it to a healthy tree these stages here are you see where some grew up but they they kind of got stalled in their development because they were not claimed it in the right place they didn't fall on good ground remember he said I have to shoe to know the mysteries amen nobody understood what he was talking about when he said this parable not even the disciples but because they came to him and simply asked he said unto you because you asked I'll show you that's the good ground because it wouldn't have grew up in them if they hadn't asked you see what I'm saying if they hadn't asked they wouldn't know but because they asked he showed them the mystery of what each stage is amen now this cankerworm it's a way at the bar what is the bark the bark of that tree is the the ring of that tree one the most important organ we have on our body is our skin because it protects us from what infection if you have a wound or open wound you are susceptible to it getting infected and anything entering into your body through that open wound so that covering on that tree that Bart is its protection oh my or here comes that can't go on what is a little protection my brothers and sisters the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus so this tree that he eats away it we're wrapped when he when Adam and Eve fail they think they went and got fig leaves no that ain't gonna protect you those leaves desitin whoo the denominational covering it won't protect you what they had to have blood up against the skin so he sacrificed a lamb bloody wool through it they put that on the process said in the cruelty of sin and the blood just streaming down their body oh my we're washed in the blood of the word that is our protection that is our covering but what is this kanker worm do begin to interject Cree's dogmas and false doctrine to take away your covering because that ain't before give you a fig leaf give you a fig leaf covering take away your protection because we protect it by the blood of the word amen so we see that cankerworm now not not now you probably can see in times were maybe different ones they begin myself I see how this knot is worse as it happened you don't realize that it's fine setting that beat you in the mind it takes away all of these different things and loved your piece and you don't want to go to church anymore so struggle to get the church when you start feeling that way you get down on your knees and you rebuked that devil because he's eating away at the fellowship and what's next he can get you to stop coming to church now you start accepting false doctrine see it all the time you see it you begin to start accepting false doctrine what is it you infected infected with the disease infected with the devil you're restarting the accept this fig leaf it won't protect you all that thing is gonna protect you is the bleeding bloody dripping Word of God for your day amen but that's what this cankerworm does amen eats away and we see here it came to pass that the soil some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air choked it out they never grew up never grew up that can't make that one got in there right from the beginning because it didn't fall on good ground it didn't have the nutrient Wow again I say because they just didn't ask they didn't man even as a small tree now when that seed is planted into the ground and it's starting to come up they don't have no a respective person there take a full-grown tree just like that those stay for stayed bisa eat a small tree cut it off because it was not planning in good ground good ground you're gonna have protection good ground you're gonna have that until it grows into a statue of a perfect man come on that and it has these defenses and it has the knowledge within itself to protect itself to strive amen now we see the next stage of this four stage beasts a man is the caterpillar now we want to look at something here I want you to go back to mark the third chapter and we're going to read from the 28th verse we're going to read from the 28th verse I'm a man 28th verse it says verily I say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the son of man and blasphemous wherewith soever they shall blaspheme but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation now what does that caterpillar do prophets say that caterpillar is a he's a sucker and he sucks the very life out of the root of that tree sucks the very life out of it what doesn't then you wouldn't if he sucks the life out of a tree I mean the tree is day it now let me say something you may be dead why you living dead why you living death means eternally separated from God that's what that caterpillar is trying to do he's trying to get you to a point he sucked the very life out of you I don't don't mean that don't mean you in the in the ground that you're bought you're not living flesh wise but spiritually you did hold on I and you could be going to church every Sunday and going through all of the motions but spiritually dead and has then verse 29 verse 29 and eternally separated from God I want to say this watch what you say about this mess because it's not a man this is what that caterpillar is trying to do suck the very life out of you this four stage bees but thank me to God thank be to God turn to Joelle chapter twenty five a man Joelle twenty five Chuck I'm sorry chocolate ooh 25th birthday man 225 and the Lord said I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great army which I sent unto you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt with you wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed amen so we see that the devil is already defeated when did he do the restaurant at Calvary the restoration began at Calvary what do we have to do let go and let God but even in these subject right here in this message that the Prophet brought in restoration of the bride tree what is it my brothers and sisters I have you to know the mysteries of this forest agency in the message the greatest battle ever fought the Prophet said you have to know how to fight if you know how he's coming you know how to bow sort of meaning this moss this flying insect come and land on your fruit and begin to eat away at your love begin to eat away at your joy begin to eat away at your peace begin to eat away at your meeting this but can you eat up where the fruits of the spirit you shoot a devil away you shoot a devil Oy say no you're not gonna get my first you can't have my fruit devil I bind you in the name of Jesus get thee behind me Satan I love my brothers and sisters I love this word of God you get down on your knees and you rebuke that though you don't continue to think on it continue to think on it and allow it's a festive and select CCC backpack that that insect can't grow if he don't eat he's just an insect and he flies away but if you allow him to eat he grow into the locust now you go from the front row to the back room and the next place is out the dope see it every time okay and then after you get out the dough what he eats away at the bar you wearing makeup you're not cut you half you're wearing pants and brother you wear shorts he takes a winter doctrine I didn't give in to that but it's in there right there and Mark say when Jesus came and he he went into the synagogue and he preached and today was astounded by his doctrine they was astounded by his doctor then he preached this doctrine and they say well what manacled out is priests in the synagogue well that wait a minute man you says we propose we know the Bible we know we know we know to buy booster and the process say they knew it knew it well by letter but not by spirit why because they didn't go into the presence of Jesus and say what meanest thou that's a good message what meanest out is what meanest out is and he say oh you ask I'm glad you asked so I'll show you the mystery amen what meanest out is the meaning of this is she will wait at first beasts that first insect so simple now that morph is light you don't even know we do he's a very small insect very light very sneaky gets into your mind and begins to eat away the fruit shoot I don't Louie then he goes after the leaves you fellowship in your doctrine Amy huh get you talking about the word talking about the myth get you against a word I'm going to church no more some people they just all about your money even heard it man the people in church worse than the people on the street name people ain't got it all the years as won't your money ain't nothing but pimps and stuff like that I haven't heard it off I ain't gonna beg you know folk my money set up in that even worse than me don't even know the people but that's just a dealer on something like honey now eight over you everything on that you ain't producer nothing but you producing if you read angulation of that relation fire go go to the Latian side let me show you what they produce Galatians five collisions fifth chapter I thought you could get it faster than I could I'm sorry fifth chapter to go to I'm I want my take in a minute same verse equals Oh nineteen thank you it's just above the fruit my go-go-go up that's 5:22 I'm sorry CZs go to nineteen go go up a little more voter there you go now the works of the flesh of the manifests the works of the flesh are the manifestation which are these this is what they produce in adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of which i tell you before as i have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God the caterpillar the caterpillar a man my brothers and sisters so I guess the bottom line is shoot a devil away while he is a small Palmer worm just a little innocent I would say innocent we moth don't let that insect grow into a caterpillar don't allow him to eat away look at those fruits of the spirit love your peace longsuffering got some long-suffering Abacha suffer loan I mean I mean I I'm I'm not saying you won't get your feelings hurt but you know what you do when you get your feelings hurt and you're feeling a little down go sit under the juniper tree go sit under the juniper tree talk to God about it and let the cool winds of the spirit blow on yet he'll just bring it right back to strength and you go back to that person that might have offended you a little bit in you down in your spirit and say oh I love your sister I love your brother I love you with the love of my lord i
