[3:00] Night of

[3:39] Lord.
[3:41] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[3:45] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord.
[3:48] Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[3:50] It's good to see each one of you. Amen.
[3:52] Let's open our Bibles to Matthew chapter
[3:57] 28. Amen. I had another scripture in my
[4:01] heart. I saw the little thing that the
[4:04] Sunday school students did back in the
[4:06] back. And then Hadassa came out on a
[4:08] song at Calvary. I just want to read
[4:11] something that you
[4:14] probably never really caught in the
[4:18] scripture. Matthew 28, it says, "In the
[4:22] end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn
[4:25] toward the first day of the week, came
[4:26] Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see
[4:29] the septic. And behold, there was a
[4:32] great earthquake. For the angel of the
[4:34] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[4:36] rolled back the stone from the door and
[4:38] sat upon it. His countenance was like
[4:41] lightning and his raignment white as
[4:43] snow. And for fear for and for fear of
[4:46] him the keepers did shake and became as
[4:49] dead men. And the angel answered and
[4:52] said unto the women, "Fear not ye, for I
[4:55] know that ye seek Jesus which was
[4:57] crucified. He is not here, for he is
[5:01] risen as he said. Come and see the place
[5:04] where the Lord
[5:05] lay, and go quickly and tell his
[5:08] disciples that he is risen from the
[5:09] dead. And behold, he goeth before you
[5:12] into Galilee. There shall ye see him,
[5:16] lo, I have told you. And they departed
[5:18] quickly from the supplr with fear and
[5:20] great joy, and did run to bring the his
[5:22] disciples word. And as they went to tell
[5:26] his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
[5:28] saying, "All hell." And they came and
[5:30] held him by the feet and worshiped him.
[5:33] And Jesus said unto them, "Be not
[5:36] afraid. Go tell my brethren that they go
[5:38] into Galilee, and there shall they see
[5:40] me." Now when they were going, behold,
[5:43] some of the watch came into the city,
[5:44] and showed unto the chief priests all
[5:47] the things that were done. And when they
[5:49] were assembled with the elders, and had
[5:52] taken
[5:53] counsel, they gave large money unto the
[5:57] soldiers, saying, Say ye, his disciples,
[6:00] came by night, and stole him away while
[6:03] we slept. And if this come to the
[6:06] governor's ears, we will persuade him
[6:08] and secure you. Now, if the soldiers
[6:11] fall asleep on duty, they are put to
[6:13] death.
[6:17] they will be put to death. But these
[6:19] governors, but these uh church people
[6:23] are saying, "Say ye his disciples came
[6:25] by night and stole him away while we
[6:27] slept. And if this comes to the
[6:29] governor's ears, we will persuade him
[6:31] and secure you." So they took the money
[6:34] and did as they were taught. And this
[6:36] saying is comely reported among the Jews
[6:39] until this day. Amen. And this is the
[6:42] one
[6:43] scripture where a lie proved the
[6:51] resurrection. They knew it was a lie.
[6:53] They knew that Jesus rose. But this was
[6:55] put in the scripture so that the
[6:57] believers will know that even Satan when
[6:59] he's lying, he can prove the
[7:00] resurrection. I'm so glad to be serving
[7:03] a God that has control over devil and
[7:06] even in the devil's lives he can prove
[7:09] amen that Jesus Christ lives. Amen.
[7:12] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our hearts
[7:14] quickly in a word of prayer. Father God,
[7:17] it's so good to be back in your
[7:20] presence, Lord, in this resurrection
[7:22] season, Lord Jesus, when the flowers
[7:25] begin to bloom, Lord, and the birds are
[7:27] singing, Lord God. And Father, for the
[7:29] Jews, it's Jubilee time, Lord. Lord,
[7:31] it's a time of release, Lord. And Father
[7:33] God, we're so grateful, Lord God, for
[7:35] the many wonderful things that happens
[7:37] in the month of April, Lord. Now,
[7:39] Father, we pray just pray, Lord, that
[7:41] you'll send forth, Lord, today, the
[7:43] former and latter rain together. Shower
[7:45] us, Lord, with the Holy Ghost and shower
[7:47] us with the teaching of your word, Lord
[7:49] Jesus. Anoint your servant this morning
[7:51] to minister the word of life to this
[7:53] people. Oh Lord, bless every hearer of
[7:56] the word, every believer, and every doer
[7:58] of the word. Father, we've come, Lord,
[8:00] to bathe in your presence, to draw
[8:02] closer to you and to be more like you,
[8:04] Lord. So, we just ask, Father God, that
[8:06] you have complete preeminence in this
[8:07] service. Use every yielded vessel, Lord,
[8:10] for your great name's sake. Bless our
[8:12] brothers and sisters who are still
[8:14] coming, Lord. Grant traveling mercies to
[8:16] them. Keep them while they're coming.
[8:17] Bless our brothers and sisters that
[8:19] could not be here and those that are
[8:21] listening in. Father God, anoint them
[8:23] where they are. Fill their homes, their
[8:25] cars, their jobs, Lord, with your
[8:27] presence, Lord. move and brood upon your
[8:29] people, Lord, that your will may be
[8:31] fulfilled in our lives. And the purpose
[8:33] that you have for each one of us will be
[8:35] accomplished. Be with our pastor where
[8:37] he is. Bless him and the saints there,
[8:40] Lord. We give you praise, honor, and
[8:42] glory. It's in Jesus Christ, precious.
[8:44] In the holy name we pray. Amen. And
[8:46] amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's
[8:50] good to see Brother Frank and brother

[47:54] and and invite brother Maliko from the
[47:57] UK to the pull pit. So let's sing a
[48:00] little song. Amazing grace. How sweet
[48:02] the sound. As our brother comes this
[48:04] morning.
[48:11] [Music]
[48:27] [Music]
[48:37] [Music]
[48:47] [Music]
[48:48] Oh, Praise the Lord.
[48:52] Very humbled to be here. Very grateful
[48:55] to brother Jack for such trust to allow
[49:00] me to preach in his absence. I pray by
[49:03] the grace of God I do not betray that
[49:06] trust. And how many has been praying for
[49:09] the service?
[49:11] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Uh
[49:14] shall we bow our heads and pray?
[49:17] Great God of heaven. Father, we come
[49:20] before you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[49:23] That all sufficient name that at the
[49:25] mention of that name the first time a
[49:28] dead baby came to life. How much more
[49:30] Lord as we submit our hearts unto you,
[49:34] how many other things can you resurrect
[49:36] in our lives as we speak that solemn
[49:39] name, the name of Jesus. Father, we pray
[49:41] that you might come into the preaching
[49:43] of the word and move us aside and anoint
[49:46] us correctly. Let the speaker and the
[49:48] hearer together be in the same frequency
[49:53] mode and be caught up in the heavenly
[49:55] places. Lord, we ask that you might have
[49:57] your way. Bless our pastor, brother
[50:00] Jack, his family, the church, the
[50:05] officers, the helps, the governments,
[50:07] and every believer. Lord, we plead your
[50:10] blood on this sacred morning that let
[50:13] the blood prevail in our lives. Almighty
[50:16] God, nothing but you should be seen so
[50:19] that Christ only can be glorified. We
[50:22] love you. We appreciate you and we ask
[50:24] that Lord you might help us in this
[50:26] needy hour. We avail ourselves and
[50:29] surrender our hearts unto you so that
[50:31] you might have the
[50:33] preeminences. We bless you in Jesus
[50:36] name. Amen and amen.
[50:38] Praise the Lord. I greet you once again
[50:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:45] Uh I was uh battling between two
[50:47] thoughts on what to preach because it's
[50:50] my first time. And if you are nervous
[50:53] for me, I'm probably double nervous. Uh
[50:57] uh so while I was uh contemplating on
[51:00] what to preach
[51:03] uh there was a song that I walked in
[51:05] that was being sung and the brother that
[51:07] was singing made a comment
[51:09] afterwards. His comment was, "Aren't you
[51:12] glad you you have a God that can let
[51:15] go?"
[51:17] Who made that
[51:19] statement? Was it you? So that's the
[51:22] statement that's influenced our sermon
[51:24] today because you're always trying to
[51:26] look for something that makes you feel a
[51:28] little bit comfortable that you are in
[51:30] the right place at the right time. So
[51:32] based on that se that statement I'm
[51:35] going to preach a sermon I'll title
[51:37] prayer as GPS.
[51:40] Praise the Lord. Because his statement
[51:43] was, "Aren't you glad you serve a God
[51:46] that just can't let go?" Amen. Amen.
[51:50] Praise the
[51:51] Lord. Shall we turn to our verses first?
[51:54] Praise the
[51:57] Lord. It's there on the slides. Go back
[51:59] to the first. Uh there's the scriptures
[52:02] before I announce the title,
[52:04] but
[52:06] Amen. Uh special thanks to my precious
[52:09] brother Jack for that trust. Uh first
[52:13] time I met brother Jack is way back
[52:16] probably in 2010. and uh we promised
[52:19] we're going to sing a duet. Um that
[52:23] still hasn't happened yet. So I thought
[52:25] I was going to do it this weekend with
[52:26] him and I'm grateful to God he's not
[52:29] around
[52:30] because I don't know how that was going
[52:33] to come out, you know, because he's a
[52:35] profound singer and I'm the exact
[52:38] opposite. I'm in brother Brandham's
[52:40] choir. Praise the Lord. Uh allow me to
[52:43] read the scripture.
[52:45] 2 Chronicles
[52:48] uh verse 6, chapter 6 verse 18 to
[52:52] uh 21. Uh I hope I don't get confused
[52:58] cuz you all Americans. Everything is on
[53:00] steroids over here. Praise the Lord. You
[53:03] all choose to speak however and and I'm
[53:06] trying to I I I come from the Queen's
[53:08] English. So if I was here, I would have
[53:11] probably said, can we go to 2
[53:14] Coronicles chapter 6 uh verse 18 through
[53:18] to 21? No, we don't say it like that.
[53:21] From chapter 6 from 18 to 21, not
[53:26] through to 21. So uh just so at least my
[53:30] English is a little bit funny. You
[53:32] understand? I'm learning. If you give me
[53:34] at least a month with American folks,
[53:37] I'll catch up. But right now, let's just
[53:39] do what we need to do to survive the
[53:42] day. So very, very grateful. I come with
[53:45] my wife. Praise the Lord. Sister
[53:49] Florence. So let's get straight into the
[53:52] word. Says, "But will God in every deed
[53:55] dwell with men on the
[53:58] earth?" That's a question. It says,
[54:01] "Behold, heaven and the heaven of
[54:04] heavens cannot contain thee." How much
[54:08] less this house which I have
[54:11] built. Have respect therefore to the
[54:14] prayer of thy servant and to his
[54:16] supplication, oh Lord my God, to hear
[54:19] can unto the cry and the prayer which
[54:21] thy servant prayeth before
[54:24] thee, that thine eyes may be open upon
[54:28] this house day and night, upon the place
[54:31] thereof thou has said that thou wouldest
[54:34] put thy name there. to hearken unto the
[54:37] prayer which thy servant prayeth towards
[54:40] this place. Hearken therefore unto the
[54:43] supplication of thy servant and of thy
[54:46] people Israel which they shall pray
[54:49] towards this place. Hear thou from thy
[54:53] dwelling place even from heaven and when
[54:57] thou
[54:58] hearest
[55:00] forgive. Praise the Lord. May the Lord
[55:03] add blessings to the reading of his
[55:04] word. You may take the comfort of your
[55:06] seats. Special thank you to uh brother
[55:11] Simba uh and our daughter. Praise the
[55:15] Lord. Uh I don't know whether you call
[55:17] her sister Ruth or Roomi. We you call
[55:20] her both. Praise the Lord. So truly
[55:24] grateful. She's such a graceful
[55:27] mother. It's as if motherhood was
[55:29] invented for her. She just does it with
[55:32] such such panach and stroke that I
[55:36] almost felt like oh why was I a man? I
[55:38] would have been a type of a mother like
[55:39] her. Praise the Lord. So we thank God
[55:42] she's a girl. Uh rather I knew her from
[55:46] being a girl. Now she's a lady and a
[55:48] mother. I've known her pretty much all
[55:51] her life. And I'm so proud that she
[55:55] turned out to be that type of a mother.
[55:58] Praise the Lord.
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:02] I think brother Simba should go out of
[56:04] his way to celebrate Mother's
[56:06] Day. Praise the Lord. So allow me
[56:10] brothers and sisters to introduce this
[56:12] little topic called prayer has GPS
[56:15] according to the scripture that we've
[56:16] just read and taking from the cue from
[56:20] brother Smiley that aren't you glad you
[56:23] serve or have a God that can't let go. I
[56:26] came up. I had two sermons that I've
[56:28] been meditating upon and I was wondering
[56:30] which one would be befitting for me in
[56:32] this place until I heard that statement.
[56:34] Then I said, "Ah, my antenna caught
[56:36] that." So, I believe by the grace of
[56:38] God, the Holy Spirit has something in
[56:40] store for someone in this sermon. Praise
[56:43] the Lord. Amen. Uh, I greet you once
[56:47] again in the name of the Lord. I come
[56:48] from Leicester, which is in England, in
[56:51] the Midlands. Uh hopefully as time goes
[56:55] by some of you will join us for
[56:56] fellowship when you make your trips to
[56:59] England. Praise the Lord. So allow me to
[57:02] take my text from uh Solomon's prayer
[57:04] that he prays at the dedication where
[57:07] the shakina glory came so profound until
[57:10] the ministers couldn't minister. And
[57:12] Solomon when he recognized the presence
[57:14] of the shakina glory, the presence of
[57:17] the Lord, the presence of the Holy
[57:18] Spirit, he made a perpetual prayer that
[57:22] will be used for generations to come.
[57:24] And that prayer was when God's people
[57:27] are in trouble wherever they are, if
[57:30] they look towards the temple, God should
[57:33] hear and forgive. Praise the Lord. In
[57:37] other words, Solomon kind of like had an
[57:40] inclination that God fills all time
[57:44] space. He is a global God. And
[57:47] therefore, because he's a global God, he
[57:49] must have access to know wherever you
[57:53] are as long as you pray towards the
[57:55] correct direction. So he says, "The
[57:59] heavens of the heavens cannot contain
[58:01] thee. Neither do I expect that this
[58:04] little house that I've built will be
[58:06] able to suffice. But I know if the
[58:09] people that are called by your name
[58:12] should find themselves in any challenge
[58:14] and they pray towards this building, you
[58:17] hear from heaven and forgive. In other
[58:20] words, if you were back in that day,
[58:22] praise the Lord, and you needed to
[58:23] travel and anticipate problems as they
[58:26] arise in humanity. If you came across
[58:29] anything that was unsavory or not
[58:32] practical or palatable to your life, if
[58:34] you prayed looking towards the temple,
[58:36] you were guaranteed an answer because
[58:39] Solomon's prayer would have to have a
[58:42] GPS because it was told if you prayed
[58:45] towards this temple. In other words, you
[58:47] couldn't pray to the direction you fancy
[58:50] because that direction might not have
[58:52] the results. But if it was a specific
[58:55] proper direction, God was obligated to
[58:58] meet the prayer that was made by Solomon
[59:01] in the temple.
[59:03] And we know we have a greater than
[59:05] Solomon. Praise the Lord. So it turns
[59:07] out, brothers and sisters, once upon a
[59:09] time there was a brother who decided to
[59:12] travel, praise the Lord, out of the will
[59:15] of God. Praise the Lord. And that
[59:17] brother when he traveled out of the will
[59:19] of God, I believe he must have made a
[59:22] prayer prior to his traveling that Lord,
[59:24] I know I'm supposed to go to Ninev, but
[59:28] the people of Ninev don't hear God good.
[59:31] I prefer rather to go to Tashish, but
[59:34] let your will be done. And as he prayed
[59:36] that prayer, he didn't realize that that
[59:38] prayer, praise the Lord, had logged on
[59:41] to the supernatural and a GPS was put
[59:44] into that prayer. So when it was time to
[59:46] locate the brother like the statement
[59:49] our brother said aren't you glad you
[59:51] serve a God who can't let go he thought
[59:54] that he would get away from God but God
[59:57] never lets you go somebody say amen to
[1:00:00] that to quantify my thought let's have
[1:00:03] this
[1:00:04] quotation praise the Lord in the message
[1:00:07] what here is thou 1959 brother Brandham
[1:00:09] says remember God is omnipresent
[1:00:15] Omnisient,
[1:00:17] omnipotent, infinite. The infinite God,
[1:00:21] omnipresent everywhere, omnisient, knows
[1:00:25] all things, all powerful,
[1:00:28] omnipotent. That's our God. The one that
[1:00:32] can let go like our brother said, that's
[1:00:34] our God. And he's here in the hospital
[1:00:37] with you just as same as you would be
[1:00:41] here at the church. If there is somebody
[1:00:43] in hospital who's wondering, I've missed
[1:00:45] church. Now, the God who's here in
[1:00:48] church is there in hospital. Praise the
[1:00:51] Lord. I give you to understand, brothers
[1:00:53] and sisters, this quotation kind of like
[1:00:56] resonates to me to show that this God
[1:00:59] who is omnipresent, omniscient,
[1:01:02] omnipotent, infinite. He knows every
[1:01:05] moment where you are and he's aware of
[1:01:09] every moment your challenge because he
[1:01:12] cannot have that kind of a power and not
[1:01:15] have the ability to deliver on it. And
[1:01:18] the quotation further on says you can't
[1:01:21] hide a saint from his prayer. In other
[1:01:25] words, brothers and sisters, this ain't
[1:01:27] a sermon for those that haven't had any
[1:01:29] prayers go there because there's nothing
[1:01:31] to follow you up. But if you've ever
[1:01:33] prayed sincerely and there is a time
[1:01:35] that God needs to locate you, your
[1:01:38] prayer will find you. According to that
[1:01:41] statement says you can't hide a saint
[1:01:44] from his prayer. I believe someone is
[1:01:47] saying, "Mr. Preacher, why don't you go
[1:01:48] behind the podium? I realize I'm so
[1:01:51] short you might not see me. Let me just
[1:01:53] hang out right here so that we read the
[1:01:54] quotation together." You all happy? I
[1:01:57] like to preach to a happy people. noise
[1:02:00] don't do any harm in the house of the
[1:02:02] Lord. If you're happy, say amen,
[1:02:05] somebody and watch that statement. It
[1:02:09] sounds like brother Brandham is just
[1:02:10] speaking, but there is depth to that
[1:02:12] statement. And that's the reason I'm
[1:02:14] preaching prayer. his GPS because he's
[1:02:17] already quantified that remember God is
[1:02:21] omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, om
[1:02:25] infinite, the infinite God, omnipresent
[1:02:29] everywhere, omniscient knows all things
[1:02:34] and all powerful. Yes, sir.
[1:02:37] Omnipotent. That's our God. Somebody say
[1:02:40] amen to that. Amen. And he's here in the
[1:02:43] hospital with you just the same as he
[1:02:46] would be here in the church. He's here
[1:02:48] with us just the same as he's with
[1:02:50] brother Jack wherever he's preaching
[1:02:52] because he's all powerful. He's all
[1:02:54] knowing. And then after making that
[1:02:56] profound statement then he says you
[1:02:59] can't hide a saint from his prayer.
[1:03:04] Amen. Amen. They throw one one time in
[1:03:08] the belly of a well and he went down to
[1:03:10] the bottom of the sea with wids wrapped
[1:03:12] around his neck. And then he repeats
[1:03:15] again, you can't hide a saint from his
[1:03:19] prayer. In other words, whatever Jonah
[1:03:21] prayed before he embarked on that
[1:03:23] journey, God logged it up and put the
[1:03:27] GPS to that prayer. And Jonah chose to
[1:03:30] go a different, like you all say in
[1:03:32] America, different route. As he went a
[1:03:34] different route, God says, "Aha, aha.
[1:03:37] I'm the God is omnipotent, omnipresent,
[1:03:40] omnisient, all powerful. I know all
[1:03:42] things. You think you are hiding right
[1:03:45] there on the sea to tashish." And right
[1:03:47] there, he says, "Okay, I locate you."
[1:03:50] Which means, brothers and sisters,
[1:03:51] prayer has global positioning. It don't
[1:03:54] matter where you are, brothers and
[1:03:56] sisters, prayer will find you. Somebody
[1:03:59] say amen to that.
[1:04:01] He turned around over, looked around,
[1:04:04] seen the well the wells belly
[1:04:06] everywhere, but he said, "They are all
[1:04:09] lying vanities." Look, look at this.
[1:04:12] Once more will I look to your holy
[1:04:15] temple, Lord. Now, how did he look to
[1:04:17] the holy temple when he was shut up in
[1:04:20] an encapsulated little vacuum of a well
[1:04:23] where there was no room? There were no
[1:04:25] windows. The last I checked in the belly
[1:04:27] of a well. But yet he says, "Let will I
[1:04:30] look to the to the direction of the
[1:04:32] temple." In other words, brothers and
[1:04:34] sisters, those three days and three
[1:04:36] nights, he prayed rolling around in
[1:04:38] there until he hit the correct
[1:04:40] direction. And when he hit that correct
[1:04:42] direction, somehow he knew that right
[1:04:44] here, I'll stay right here. There is a
[1:04:47] magnetic force in this prayer, in this
[1:04:49] direction, and I know my deliverance is
[1:04:51] coming. Brothers and sisters, there's
[1:04:53] times that you pray and it don't look
[1:04:55] like God don't hear your prayer. Let me
[1:04:57] tell you brothers and sisters, keep
[1:04:58] praying until you hit the right
[1:05:00] direction. There is a point that you
[1:05:02] reach and you know at this point I
[1:05:05] cannot be denied. I cannot be denied.
[1:05:08] When you get to that point of no denial,
[1:05:11] you know it's a matter of time but I'm
[1:05:13] out of this problem. Somebody say amen
[1:05:15] right there. I believe brothers and
[1:05:17] sisters as we are preaching right now
[1:05:19] somebody made a prayer that's about to
[1:05:22] be put a GPS to locate them according to
[1:05:25] this quotation that says you cannot hide
[1:05:28] a saint from his prayer believers thou
[1:05:31] this praise the Lord so Jonah becomes
[1:05:34] our case study of how God can locate a
[1:05:38] person any place anywhere as a global
[1:05:41] GPS means global positioning system as
[1:05:45] as we all know these days if I want to
[1:05:47] visit brother smiley he just has to send
[1:05:49] me he says brother crossby send me your
[1:05:51] location and I'm able to navigate to the
[1:05:54] brother just using technology he don't
[1:05:58] need to tell me take a left at Belvadier
[1:06:00] Boulevard go into Erica Boulevard when
[1:06:03] you hit certain no there there's no need
[1:06:05] for that he just says send your location
[1:06:09] and through the location I'm able to
[1:06:11] take the navigation right up to my
[1:06:13] brother and it will tell you you are
[1:06:15] within a few meters from the destination
[1:06:17] and when I arrive it tells me you have
[1:06:19] reached your destination and if
[1:06:21] technology knows how to do that
[1:06:25] if technology knows how to do that how
[1:06:27] much more God
[1:06:30] how much more God if ways knows how to
[1:06:34] correctly place you how much more the
[1:06:37] technology from the supernatural and if
[1:06:40] you're an adult and message believer the
[1:06:42] message says every natural achievement
[1:06:45] is a forerunner of every spiritual
[1:06:47] achievement. So it's high time our
[1:06:50] prayers hit the target because if and
[1:06:54] satnav is hitting the target to your
[1:06:56] destination there is no way you can pray
[1:06:59] for a destination and God not give it to
[1:07:01] you. Amen. Amen. It's more precise now
[1:07:06] than ever. Praise the Lord. So when
[1:07:09] brother made this statement, it gives us
[1:07:11] to understand that the statement that's
[1:07:14] being made is alluding to Jonah. Jonah
[1:07:17] had a tough assignment. The assignment
[1:07:20] was to go and preach in Nineveh. But he
[1:07:23] knew that the people of Nineveh resisted
[1:07:25] the word. And he knew the challenges
[1:07:27] that presented his ministry to Nineveh.
[1:07:31] And he chose a different route. Bought
[1:07:34] himself a ticket, paid. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:38] chose himself a good seat on his way to
[1:07:40] Tashish, but he forgot the prayer that
[1:07:43] he made before. And that prayer, God put
[1:07:46] a GPS to locate him. And as he was on
[1:07:48] his way in a in an in an ocean or a sea
[1:07:52] where there was vast amount of water,
[1:07:55] there is no street, there's no
[1:07:56] boulevard, God was able to cause a storm
[1:07:59] at the precise moment so that that storm
[1:08:02] can wake him up and jack him out of his
[1:08:04] slumber. Somebody say amen to that. When
[1:08:07] he got to that position, it turned out
[1:08:09] that he knew that I'm the one that's
[1:08:13] causing this dilemma. He had the
[1:08:16] instinct to say, "Throw me
[1:08:18] overboard." Now, the God who put a
[1:08:21] global positioning system to cause the
[1:08:23] storm at that particular point had to
[1:08:26] also orchestrate and order a well to be
[1:08:28] right beneath him so that when he's
[1:08:30] thrown overboard, it swallows him. Had
[1:08:34] he been a kilometer away, there is no
[1:08:37] knowledge whether brother Jonah could
[1:08:38] swim or not. He could have suffocated or
[1:08:41] drowned whatever or wells or whatever.
[1:08:44] But God made sure that the well is right
[1:08:47] on the spot where Jonah would be dropped
[1:08:51] in time for him to be swallowed. And the
[1:08:55] well had to be rerouted from Tash's
[1:08:58] direction and take the right direction
[1:09:01] to Nineveh and took a swim right up to
[1:09:04] Ninev. And the prophet says the well
[1:09:06] vomited him at the show. The well
[1:09:09] decided to get sick halfway through the
[1:09:12] journey. Our brother wouldn't have made
[1:09:14] it. But brother, let me tell you, it
[1:09:16] vomited him right on time to just land
[1:09:20] by the shore without having to swim.
[1:09:23] And if that God is that precise, let me
[1:09:26] tell you my brother, my sister, there is
[1:09:28] never a time that God won't deliver you
[1:09:30] at the right place at the right time in
[1:09:33] in in his will to prevent the dilemas of
[1:09:38] your decisions.
[1:09:40] Because Jonah thought that you'll get
[1:09:42] one on God and say, you know what, I'm
[1:09:44] not going there. He didn't realize that
[1:09:47] God had the global positioning system
[1:09:49] and his prayer located him. And based on
[1:09:52] that quotation is the prophet who says
[1:09:55] you can't hide a saint from his prayer.
[1:09:58] So Jonah could hide but he couldn't hide
[1:10:01] from the prayer that he initially made.
[1:10:03] There are some people who are fighting
[1:10:05] against their prayer. Let me tell you
[1:10:06] brother sister when your prayer is
[1:10:08] hunting for you. You can't hide from it.
[1:10:12] Your prayer will locate you and will
[1:10:14] force you to get in line and your prayer
[1:10:18] will constantly nag at you. Praise the
[1:10:20] Lord. until you line up. Yes, sir. So,
[1:10:23] hence we have that quotation.
[1:10:26] Let's have it. And then we have the
[1:10:28] second one to give it a text because
[1:10:31] brother Brhamam never makes a slip
[1:10:32] through the tongue. I I don't know about
[1:10:34] you folks, but aren't you tired of
[1:10:35] people that try to correct the prophet.
[1:10:40] You've never had one accurate dream, but
[1:10:41] you're trying to correct a prophet.
[1:10:45] You can only correct the prophet if all
[1:10:47] your dreams in your life were accurate.
[1:10:49] I for instance know I cannot correct the
[1:10:52] prophet but once upon a time I had a
[1:10:54] dream and in that dream I was uh Jennet
[1:10:57] Jackson's pastor and I woke up and I
[1:10:59] said to my
[1:11:02] wife I woke up and I started smiling and
[1:11:04] laughing. What are you laughing at? I
[1:11:06] said I I had a dream. I was Jenn's
[1:11:09] pastor. Where will I meet Janice Jackson
[1:11:12] for
[1:11:13] starters? You know it's just a dream. So
[1:11:16] it shows you your capacity to never be
[1:11:19] at that realm of trying to interfere and
[1:11:21] middle or mangle with the message. Leave
[1:11:23] it alone. It's so advanced.
[1:11:27] Most of you will realize that as you get
[1:11:30] deep into the message, it's adv there
[1:11:33] there is stuff that say how come I
[1:11:35] underlined this many years ago and yet
[1:11:38] what was I what what did I
[1:11:40] quote? You you'll actually see a
[1:11:42] quotation you underlined and you've got
[1:11:44] some some notes on the side to say and
[1:11:46] then you realize as time goes on you
[1:11:48] knew nothing.
[1:11:50] This message is way advanced. Brothers
[1:11:52] and sisters,
[1:11:53] right? It don't need amplification. It
[1:11:57] don't need modification. It don't need
[1:12:00] interpretation. God interprets his own
[1:12:02] word. Are we are we ready for having
[1:12:05] some church in here? Now we second
[1:12:07] quote. Why? When Solomon dedicated that
[1:12:10] temple, he prayed up there and he said,
[1:12:13] "If any of thy people be in trouble
[1:12:17] anywhere and looked towards this temple,
[1:12:20] then hear from heaven, Lord." And he
[1:12:23] said he had confidence in what the
[1:12:27] prophet's prayer was for. I want you to
[1:12:30] underline that in your mind. You must
[1:12:33] have confidence in brother Brham's
[1:12:35] prayer.
[1:12:37] says he had confidence in what the
[1:12:40] prophet's prayer was for and he would
[1:12:43] hear from heaven and he refused to look
[1:12:46] at the symptoms of the well's belly and
[1:12:49] looked again towards the temple and then
[1:12:53] the statement comes again. Let's read
[1:12:56] it. You can't hide a saint from prayer.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And listen
[1:13:04] to this. I don't care where you go.
[1:13:08] Because prayer has global positioning.
[1:13:12] I don't care where you go. You can put
[1:13:15] him under any condition.
[1:13:20] It don't matter. Prayer is that
[1:13:22] powerful. It will locate you. You can
[1:13:24] put him in any condition. the Hebrew
[1:13:27] children in the fairy furnace, Daniel in
[1:13:30] the lion's den, wherever it may be, a
[1:13:33] real
[1:13:35] believer holds on to that prayer. I
[1:13:38] don't care what takes place, he holds on
[1:13:41] to that prayer. So, as our brother said,
[1:13:44] "Aren't you glad you serve a God who
[1:13:46] never lets you go?" That's when I said,
[1:13:48] "I have the correct sermon." God never
[1:13:51] lets you go because when you pray and
[1:13:54] hold on to that prayer, the combination
[1:13:56] of God not letting you go and your
[1:14:00] prayer hunting for you that you can't
[1:14:02] hide from it, results have got to come
[1:14:05] anyhow.
[1:14:09] Do you see that, brothers and sisters?
[1:14:11] And watch
[1:14:12] this. You know, you know what happened?
[1:14:16] God made that well sick at his stomach
[1:14:19] and he vomited vomited him up at the
[1:14:22] shore. Why not midway through the
[1:14:25] journey?
[1:14:27] It'll have been a total disaster.
[1:14:29] There's whales, there's sharks, there's
[1:14:32] dolphins, there's a lot of predators
[1:14:34] underwater. But God had to make sure
[1:14:37] that he's vomited right at the shore.
[1:14:40] Let me tell you, brothers and sisters,
[1:14:41] you will never fail in your endeavor as
[1:14:44] a Christian. This God is so precise that
[1:14:47] he won't let you he won't let you be in
[1:14:50] arms length to disaster.
[1:14:54] He will vomit you right at the shore.
[1:14:57] And watch this. Now, if God could answer
[1:15:00] Jonah's prayer under those conditions at
[1:15:04] looking towards a temple that a man
[1:15:07] made, the temple where a man prayed,
[1:15:10] that's Solomon. That's the scripture I
[1:15:11] open for you. a temple. There was a
[1:15:14] mercy seat overshadowed with the blood
[1:15:17] of
[1:15:19] sheep. How much more will he today? Cuz
[1:15:22] we not overshadowed with the blood of a
[1:15:24] sheep. We are overshadowed with
[1:15:26] immaculate conception blood. The blood
[1:15:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. When we
[1:15:32] look away from our symptoms right now,
[1:15:35] brothers and sisters, if you want
[1:15:36] success in whatever you're going through
[1:15:37] through your prayer, your symptoms will
[1:15:39] try and shout out that it won't happen.
[1:15:41] Don't look to your symptoms. Look away
[1:15:43] from your symptoms. Amen. Amen. When we
[1:15:47] look away from our symptoms, our
[1:15:50] crippled condition, our cancer, our
[1:15:53] tumor, or whatever we have or our sin
[1:15:57] and look to the throne of God where
[1:16:00] Jesus stands at the right hand of his
[1:16:03] majesty with his own blood to make
[1:16:07] intercession upon our confession. Praise
[1:16:10] the Lord. Praise the Lord. Raise it up,
[1:16:12] my
[1:16:14] brother. I have manifested. Sorry,
[1:16:17] you've gone a little bit quicker. Praise
[1:16:19] the Lord. You've skipped a
[1:16:21] slide. Go back. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:16:23] you see, with those two
[1:16:25] quotes, you can establish a thought that
[1:16:28] Brother Brham wasn't just throwing words
[1:16:30] in the air because he gave the example
[1:16:34] of a man who thought was running away
[1:16:35] from the presence of the Lord. But
[1:16:37] midway through the journey that prayer
[1:16:39] located him and then he gave it twice as
[1:16:43] Jonah did not realize that his life was
[1:16:46] typing a far greater activity which is
[1:16:49] the typing of Jesus Christ being buried
[1:16:52] in the in the in the belly of the earth
[1:16:54] for three days and three nights. He
[1:16:56] thought that his life was just a man
[1:16:58] who's running away from the presence of
[1:17:00] God and then God found him and that was
[1:17:03] it. and we are reading after his story.
[1:17:07] We know there was a greater picture. And
[1:17:10] sometimes as believers when we go
[1:17:11] through our challenges and troubles, you
[1:17:13] don't realize that you're not going them
[1:17:15] going going through those things for for
[1:17:17] for for somebody else. You think you're
[1:17:19] going through them for yourself. Yet
[1:17:21] someone is supposed to learn how to come
[1:17:23] out of it by the way God makes you come
[1:17:25] out of it. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is far
[1:17:31] more meticulous and
[1:17:34] intelligent and far more advanced. He
[1:17:37] knows the end from the beginning. He
[1:17:40] knows how you will make you overcome
[1:17:42] what you're going through. And
[1:17:44] meanwhile, right now, you're busy being
[1:17:47] uh bombarded by the devil with symptoms.
[1:17:50] And halfway through, I don't want to use
[1:17:52] the word depressed, but I find that a
[1:17:53] lot in message community that we have
[1:17:56] people that say, "I've been a believer
[1:17:57] for so long, but it look like God really
[1:17:59] hears my prayer." He does. I've got news
[1:18:02] for you. He does. Praise the Lord. He
[1:18:06] does. And he does it all the time. In
[1:18:09] certain prayers, when he hears them, he
[1:18:11] suspends them there waiting to activate
[1:18:13] the GPS.
[1:18:15] And when the GPS has been activated,
[1:18:18] it's time for that prayer to hunt for
[1:18:20] you. When you've totally forgotten that
[1:18:24] you've prayed about this matter and then
[1:18:26] God starts to activate a season and a
[1:18:28] time to make the thing happen, you will
[1:18:30] be shocked at God's power. Somebody say
[1:18:33] amen to that. So now we've taken
[1:18:35] Solomon's prayer as a perpetual prayer
[1:18:38] for the generations and it was used for
[1:18:40] people when they found themselves in
[1:18:41] dilemas. And we have the example of
[1:18:43] Jonah who prayed and looked at the
[1:18:46] temple yet in the well's belly. Amen. In
[1:18:49] other words, if you lived in that
[1:18:51] generation or that age, if you travel,
[1:18:54] you best travel knowing the direction of
[1:18:56] the temple in case you need to look to
[1:18:57] it. In other words, if you're living
[1:19:00] today, you best know how to pray message
[1:19:03] wise because you never know when you
[1:19:05] need to plead the blood.
[1:19:08] Amen. So now we find Jesus comes on the
[1:19:11] scene who is a greater than Solomon. He
[1:19:13] also makes his own prayer which is
[1:19:15] similar to Solomon's prayer and that
[1:19:18] prayer that Solomon had was able to have
[1:19:20] GPS. The question I have how much more
[1:19:22] would Jesus prayer
[1:19:24] have? And listen to this these words
[1:19:27] spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to
[1:19:29] heaven and said father the hour is come.
[1:19:32] glorify thy son that thy son may also
[1:19:36] may may also may glory thee. May th
[1:19:40] sorry let me read it properly. Glorify
[1:19:42] thy son that thy son also may glorify
[1:19:46] thee. The glorification is the shakina
[1:19:49] glory. Solomon could only speak after
[1:19:52] the shakina glory had presented itself.
[1:19:55] And Jesus is saying that was me being
[1:19:57] glorified in type. Now glorify me with
[1:20:01] that glory that I have heard before. My
[1:20:04] lord. And then he goes on to say, as
[1:20:06] thou has given him power over all flesh,
[1:20:09] that he should give eternal life to as
[1:20:11] many as thou has given him, and this is
[1:20:14] life eternal, that they might know thee,
[1:20:17] the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
[1:20:19] whom thou has sent. I have glorified
[1:20:22] thee on earth. I have finished the work
[1:20:25] which thou gavest me to do. And now, oh
[1:20:28] father, glorify thou me with thine own
[1:20:32] self, with the glory which I had with
[1:20:35] thee before the world
[1:20:39] was. I have manifested thy name unto the
[1:20:43] man which thou gavest me out of the
[1:20:46] world. Thine they were, and thou gavest
[1:20:49] them me, and they have kept thy word.
[1:20:54] Now they have known that all things
[1:20:57] whatsoever thou hast given me are of
[1:21:01] thee. And I have given unto them the
[1:21:04] words which thou gavest me. And they
[1:21:07] have received them and have known surely
[1:21:10] that I came out from thee, and they have
[1:21:13] believed that thou did send me.
[1:21:18] I pray for them like Solomon prayed for
[1:21:21] the people of his generation. I pray not
[1:21:25] for the world. That's why Solomon said
[1:21:27] if thy people which are called by thy
[1:21:30] name. So which means this prayer wasn't
[1:21:33] for every if you are a Muslim and you
[1:21:35] decided let me look to the temple
[1:21:37] nothing was going to happen. But if you
[1:21:40] are any of God's people and you look
[1:21:43] towards the temple, you were covered by
[1:21:45] Solomon's prayer. And then he goes on to
[1:21:49] say, I pray not for the world, but for
[1:21:53] them which thou has given me, for they
[1:21:56] are thine. Now, let me pause right there
[1:21:58] for a minute. Many times we understand
[1:22:01] that Christianom, God's sovereign, we've
[1:22:04] got good Pentecostals, we've got good
[1:22:06] Christians, you know, everywhere we go
[1:22:08] there is, you know, but there is a time
[1:22:12] where there is a
[1:22:13] separation and the separation is by
[1:22:15] predestination.
[1:22:17] And that separation by predestination
[1:22:19] means there is certain prayers that no
[1:22:21] matter how good a Pentecostal you might
[1:22:23] pray, at best you can be a foolish
[1:22:26] virgin.
[1:22:29] At best,
[1:22:31] when you reach the climax of your
[1:22:33] revelation of
[1:22:34] Christ, you probably might die for
[1:22:37] yourself in the tribulation, for your
[1:22:40] own confession.
[1:22:42] But there is a designated people that
[1:22:45] God knows that these are mine. They are
[1:22:49] kept under a particular covenant. They
[1:22:52] belong to a certain section and these
[1:22:55] people are the apple of my eye. You
[1:22:57] can't say apple of my eye to everyone.
[1:23:00] Imagine if I went to every woman in the
[1:23:01] street and said, "Honey, I love you or
[1:23:03] you're so sweet." No, no, no, no, no,
[1:23:04] no. That don't work. There is special
[1:23:06] designated language only for my wife.
[1:23:09] And similarly, there is special
[1:23:11] designated language only for the wife of
[1:23:13] Jesus Christ. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:23:16] There is stuff I can't even tell my
[1:23:18] daughter, but I can speak to the mother
[1:23:20] cuz she's my bride. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:23] When you know these things, brothers and
[1:23:25] sisters, it changes your perception of
[1:23:28] who you are. Yes, sir.
[1:23:31] Listen to this. So, the prayer goes on.
[1:23:34] Jesus is praying for the people that he
[1:23:36] has. It says, "All are
[1:23:38] thine. All mine are thine, and thine are
[1:23:41] mine, and I'm glorified in them. And now
[1:23:45] I'm no more in the world, but these are
[1:23:48] in the world. And I come to thee, holy
[1:23:51] father, tip through thine own name those
[1:23:55] whom thou has given me, that they may be
[1:23:59] one as we
[1:24:01] are. While I was with them in the world,
[1:24:04] I kept them in thy name. Those that thou
[1:24:08] gavest me, I have kept, and none of them
[1:24:12] is lost, but the son of pition that the
[1:24:15] scripture might be fulfilled. In other
[1:24:17] words, God was so meticulous in his
[1:24:19] senses for his people that he knew that
[1:24:21] the only soul we've lost is of Judas is
[1:24:24] a carot.
[1:24:25] But the rest of the disciples by
[1:24:27] predestination I have.
[1:24:30] Praise the Lord. So that prayer that is
[1:24:32] praying from verse one up to where we
[1:24:34] are at right now, he's praying for the
[1:24:36] disciples that he had. And he says here,
[1:24:40] "While I was with them, I kept in thy
[1:24:42] name except for Judas's scariot." And
[1:24:45] then verse number 13. And now I come to
[1:24:47] thee and these things I speak in the
[1:24:50] world that they might have my joy
[1:24:53] fulfilled in themselves. And if you
[1:24:55] notice I've skipped from verse 13 to
[1:24:58] verse 20. Verse 20. Verse 13. We can
[1:25:02] clearly see that he's praying for the
[1:25:04] disciples and the people that are. He's
[1:25:06] not even praying for us there. He starts
[1:25:09] to pray for us on verse 20. That's where
[1:25:11] you and I are included. Verse 20 says,
[1:25:14] "Neither pray I for these alone," which
[1:25:17] means they were there, but for them also
[1:25:21] which shall believe on me through their
[1:25:23] word. Now we are included. And Jesus
[1:25:26] prayer, we couldn't hide from it. It had
[1:25:30] to find its GPS, locate me in Zimbabwe,
[1:25:34] bring me to England. Whether I liked it
[1:25:37] or not, by predestination, that prayer
[1:25:40] would have to locate me. and he had to
[1:25:42] locate you wherever you were and you
[1:25:44] find yourself in West Palm Beach.
[1:25:46] Hallelujah. Let me tell you brothers and
[1:25:47] sisters that prayer whether you thought
[1:25:51] you came to the message by your own
[1:25:53] choice you are lying.
[1:25:56] Some of us didn't come by choice. When
[1:25:58] we came we understood that oh this is
[1:26:01] the highway to heaven. But when we came,
[1:26:04] it was through unsavory circumstances,
[1:26:06] things that we never thought that one
[1:26:08] way or the other. You sisters with all
[1:26:11] the trousers that you had back then, you
[1:26:13] put them all in the trash can to put on
[1:26:15] a dress because you couldn't argue with
[1:26:17] the message because it was ingrained
[1:26:19] within you from the foundation of the
[1:26:21] world. So all that needed to happen was
[1:26:24] for those people that were prayed for to
[1:26:26] get in and then that prayer hang in
[1:26:28] there waiting for 2024,
[1:26:32] 2025, 2018, 2017, whichever time you
[1:26:36] came to the message. That prayer that
[1:26:38] Jesus made had to be activated at the
[1:26:42] central system where they put GPS and it
[1:26:45] located you. Some were found in
[1:26:47] nightclubs. When the GPS activated, you
[1:26:50] could never run away from it. That is
[1:26:52] why I tell you, brother, don't fear for
[1:26:54] God's people. Wherever they are, God is
[1:26:57] capable of making them drop whatever
[1:27:00] they're going through. He's that
[1:27:01] powerful.
[1:27:03] Yes, sir.
[1:27:05] Hallelujah. If it means has to drag you
[1:27:07] through a jail house, it don't matter.
[1:27:10] Jonah was dragged through the belly of a
[1:27:12] well. It didn't matter. But the issue is
[1:27:15] the GPS found a pinging
[1:27:18] point location located the believer
[1:27:22] brought you wherever you were. At first
[1:27:25] you came you didn't understand what was
[1:27:27] going on because we all seem to have a
[1:27:29] strange doctrine. This people they seem
[1:27:31] to talk a lot about Malachi 4:5 Eagle
[1:27:34] time the seals the thirdpool who these
[1:27:37] people this strange I ain't heard this
[1:27:38] in the Baptist the GPS had not located
[1:27:41] you then but right now it has located
[1:27:43] you somehow all the things about the
[1:27:46] message just sound right in your heart
[1:27:50] why do you think that is because the
[1:27:53] central command has decided to
[1:27:57] activate
[1:27:58] GPS to locate you. And that prayer was
[1:28:02] too
[1:28:03] powerful. It could never miss us. True.
[1:28:07] So that prayer was now changing the
[1:28:11] trajectory of looking to Solomon's
[1:28:13] prayer to now looking to Jesus. So now
[1:28:18] you find Peter, John uh going to the
[1:28:22] temple to pray. There was a man by the
[1:28:24] gate asking for
[1:28:27] alms asking for the blessing before
[1:28:30] people got into church. Peter said,
[1:28:32] "Silver and gold have I none such as I
[1:28:35] have in the name of Jesus. Rise up and
[1:28:38] walk." This man was believing Solomon's
[1:28:41] prayer that if I look towards the
[1:28:42] temple, it was 4 years of no
[1:28:44] breakthrough. He decided, let me not go
[1:28:47] to the let me not look to the temple.
[1:28:48] Let me go stay by the
[1:28:50] temple. Stayed by the temple. But the
[1:28:53] one that came to deliver him did not get
[1:28:55] into the temple to get the power and
[1:28:57] then come out to pray for him. Says
[1:28:59] while they were going in
[1:29:02] says what hailth thee says the man says
[1:29:05] look on us. Why does the Bible
[1:29:08] specifically say look on us? Is because
[1:29:11] they knew there was an ingrained
[1:29:13] doctrine of looking to the temple.
[1:29:18] So that's why it says look on us. In
[1:29:20] other words, you've been looking at the
[1:29:22] wrong temple. Their times have changed.
[1:29:25] There was a prayer offered in John
[1:29:27] chapter 17 that these people now know
[1:29:31] the expiration of the looking at the
[1:29:34] temple that that dimension is over. It's
[1:29:37] now look on us cuz the tabernop of God
[1:29:40] is with men. That's why brother Brandham
[1:29:42] came and told us there comes a season
[1:29:44] when you say brother I give you not say
[1:29:49] brother I'm going to pray for God to
[1:29:50] give you. No say it's a dimensional
[1:29:54] change of a higher God seen in a higher
[1:29:58] way. Somebody say amen.
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:03] So he says neither pray I for thee for
[1:30:05] these alone. I pray for those that was
[1:30:08] an advanced atonement, an advanced
[1:30:11] prayer, a prayer that God knew is going
[1:30:14] to transcend all the church ages and
[1:30:17] bring us to William Branham. Praise the
[1:30:19] Lord. There we are. Then after this,
[1:30:23] everyone was now saying, "Look on us.
[1:30:25] Look on us." Because they knew that if
[1:30:27] you looked to Peter steadfast, if he
[1:30:30] looks in your eyes, if you're crippled
[1:30:31] say rise up and walk. So it was look on
[1:30:33] us, look on us, look on us. And then
[1:30:35] came a time when dark ages came, church
[1:30:38] ages came, things went a little bit
[1:30:40] blurry. Praise the Lord. Raise it up, my
[1:30:42] brother. Now we come to another
[1:30:45] dimension. And watch the title of this
[1:30:48] sermon. Thy seed shall possess the gate
[1:30:52] of the enemy. And watch, I've used
[1:30:54] Solomon's prayer. I've used Jesus
[1:30:56] prayer. Now I'm using brother Arab's
[1:30:59] prayer. Used Solomon a greater than
[1:31:03] Solomon. And now we are in our day.
[1:31:08] 1962, brother Braham is praying. And
[1:31:10] watch the prayer. I pray God have mercy.
[1:31:14] No one wants to go to the regions of the
[1:31:15] lost. No one wants to go down there.
[1:31:18] Father, far be it from any of us going.
[1:31:21] Yet down in there is a good heart in
[1:31:24] that person, that man, that woman, that
[1:31:27] man or woman that's charitable and nice
[1:31:30] and kind and has been deceived by the
[1:31:32] devil. the devil done that. And brother
[1:31:35] Bam turns around and he looks and he
[1:31:38] says, "Satan,
[1:31:40] I am against you." And I also come to
[1:31:43] West Palm Beach. Wherever he's lurking
[1:31:46] in your lives, I want to say, "Satan,
[1:31:48] I'm against you. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:52] Because you are an enemy of my Lord.
[1:31:55] You're an enemy of his word. I judge
[1:31:58] thee by Jesus Christ the son of God as a
[1:32:01] moral being knowing that I have no power
[1:32:03] within myself. I haven't got power to
[1:32:06] stop you. I like the prophet. He's a
[1:32:09] realist. He knows his scriptural
[1:32:12] authority. He knows where his power
[1:32:15] lays. And he sends around says, "I
[1:32:17] haven't got power to make any of these
[1:32:19] women clean up. Any of these men that's
[1:32:21] listening to this type or wherever. I
[1:32:24] have no way of making them clean up. I
[1:32:27] am powerless.
[1:32:29] But I do have the authority of the word
[1:32:33] of God as a servant to preach it and
[1:32:38] duty bound by that authority. Neither
[1:32:42] this policeman out here has power to
[1:32:44] stop a car, but he has authority to do
[1:32:48] it. And and Satan, you might as well go
[1:32:52] to squeak your brakes.
[1:32:55] Let me tell the devil in your life, as
[1:32:58] of this moment, I've come as a servant
[1:33:00] of the Lord, and I tell you, Satan,
[1:33:03] squeak your brakes. Squeak your brakes.
[1:33:07] You've got no power over these people.
[1:33:10] You can't put diabetes on God's people.
[1:33:12] You can't put cancer on God's people. I
[1:33:15] tell you, squeak your brakes
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:21] right there. squeak your brakes. You
[1:33:24] see, the problem with us is failing to
[1:33:26] process what the word says for us.
[1:33:29] Brother B is saying it don't matter how
[1:33:31] big a a truck is coming. As long as the
[1:33:35] policeman is small, maybe small and
[1:33:38] short like I am, if he stands on the
[1:33:40] highway and he says, "Right, it don't
[1:33:42] matter how fast you are going, you will
[1:33:45] never run down that policeman. You might
[1:33:47] as well you might you might might
[1:33:48] actually veer off to a to an accident.
[1:33:51] You know better than to run down the
[1:33:53] policeman. And I don't care how many to
[1:33:56] your devils are. I've come short as I am
[1:33:58] in the name of Jesus. And I'm telling
[1:34:01] Satan, you might as well squeak your
[1:34:03] brakes. Oh, let me tell you, brother,
[1:34:06] sister, tell that devil, squeak your
[1:34:08] brakes. Squeak your brakes. Not in my
[1:34:12] house. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:34:15] Brother, when you go to wherever you go,
[1:34:17] you go tell the devil, step in and say,
[1:34:20] "I'm the new sheriff in here." That's
[1:34:22] American language. Ain't it? When the
[1:34:25] sheriff says, "Right, peck it in." You
[1:34:27] peck it in. Praise the Lord. He's got no
[1:34:30] power over your children. He's got no
[1:34:33] power over
[1:34:34] inheritance. If he thought he had, I've
[1:34:37] come to tell him, "Speak your breaks
[1:34:40] right now in Jesus' name. Speak your
[1:34:44] brakes. right now in Jesus name. Squeak
[1:34:47] your brakes. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:34:53] Now, what I like about the prophet's
[1:34:55] prayer, he seems to address the devil
[1:34:57] more than he's talking to Jesus.
[1:35:01] He's not almighty God. I love you, Lord
[1:35:03] Jesus. You are awesome and wonderful.
[1:35:06] How powerful and majestic you are. Oh,
[1:35:10] alpha and omega. Glory be to God. Oh, he
[1:35:13] knows there ain't time to be addressing
[1:35:16] God. God done his duty. He's waiting on
[1:35:18] us. The time is to address the devil.
[1:35:21] So, he starts by saying, "Satan, I'm
[1:35:24] against you. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:35:27] Lord. I'm against you." Why? Because you
[1:35:30] are an enemy of my God. There's lot of
[1:35:32] time for you. You see, if you see
[1:35:34] yourself spending a lot of time, Lord, I
[1:35:36] love you. He knows that. Tell the devil
[1:35:38] his position. The the revelation of the
[1:35:42] seven seal is for you to know who God
[1:35:44] is. Praise the Lord. And also know who
[1:35:47] the devil is. It's the unveiling of God.
[1:35:52] And also the exposition of the devil.
[1:35:55] And now we can pray like our prophet,
[1:35:57] thy seed shall possess the gate of the
[1:35:58] enemy. It's like a the the the title of
[1:36:01] the sermon itself is prophetic. So if it
[1:36:04] says thy seed, all you have to do is
[1:36:07] just locate in your lineage. Do you have
[1:36:10] Abraham's royal seed? Are you of
[1:36:12] Abraham's seed? And if you notice that
[1:36:14] Abraham is my father saying, "Hang on a
[1:36:17] minute. This quotation is talking about
[1:36:19] me." And then you slam up in whatever it
[1:36:22] is that you're going through, you tell
[1:36:23] that devil, "Stop." And I double dare
[1:36:25] you, he will stop. And let me tell you,
[1:36:28] brothers and sisters, he don't stop
[1:36:29] because you've got a horse voice like a
[1:36:31] male. Even sisters got a right to tell
[1:36:33] the devil in a very small feminist
[1:36:35] voices. Now,
[1:36:38] Satan, I ain't going to lie to you right
[1:36:40] now. Use gas to stop right now. I ain't
[1:36:44] I ain't asking you more times than this.
[1:36:46] By the time I get into my house, I want
[1:36:48] my child well.
[1:36:52] Amen.
[1:36:54] And believe it or not, my brother, God,
[1:36:56] he has sisters as well.
[1:36:59] Remember my title is prayer has GPS.
[1:37:03] Prayer has GPS. So now the prophet's
[1:37:07] prayer must also have GPS. And watch
[1:37:10] this. The prophet goes on to pray and
[1:37:12] says, "And Satan, you might as well
[1:37:15] squeak your brakes cuz I charge thee by
[1:37:18] Jesus Christ that you turn these people
[1:37:21] loose throughout global positioning
[1:37:24] system
[1:37:27] throughout the world." Watch this.
[1:37:30] Wherever this message may go,
[1:37:34] hallelujah.
[1:37:35] Is the message in your homes? Is it in
[1:37:38] your church? Is it in your car? Is it in
[1:37:42] your workplace? When you are there, as
[1:37:44] long as you are holding the message,
[1:37:47] you've got a blood right to tell the
[1:37:49] devil, squeak your brakes. Because
[1:37:52] according to the prophet's prayer, he
[1:37:55] says, wherever this message may go,
[1:38:01] Did you hear that? Which means this
[1:38:04] prayer that the prophet prayed is only
[1:38:06] acting waiting for activation.
[1:38:09] Just waiting for go. Is that when you
[1:38:13] put your cardinals on your cars for
[1:38:15] satnav and then you press
[1:38:18] right now? We've just kickstarted a
[1:38:20] revival in your home.
[1:38:23] Wherever this message may go, somebody
[1:38:27] say amen to that. Amen.
[1:38:29] Turn them loose and watch this. I claim
[1:38:34] them where the message will go. Aren't
[1:38:37] you glad you are under the prophet's
[1:38:39] claims? There is times, brothers and
[1:38:41] sisters, when you are praying and you
[1:38:43] don't seem to have a spiritual
[1:38:45] confidence that you're overcoming, you
[1:38:47] should know that no matter what happens,
[1:38:49] my prophet's prayer, hallelujah, 100%.
[1:38:53] God allowed him to be a sharpshooter
[1:38:56] until he knew that if I miss the problem
[1:39:01] is more to do with why that's why when
[1:39:05] he was hunting them squirrels and he
[1:39:07] missed four shots he says something is
[1:39:09] wrong because he knew he was ordained to
[1:39:12] be a sharpshooter and because of that if
[1:39:14] he prayed like Solom Solomon prayed and
[1:39:18] Jonah depended on that prayer we don't
[1:39:20] know how many generations it took for
[1:39:22] that prayer to help Jonah. How much more
[1:39:25] you if you are claimed by the prophet.
[1:39:29] Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] Claimed by the prophet. First for
[1:39:35] starters, you were claimed, you were
[1:39:37] prayed for by the Lord Jesus Christ when
[1:39:39] it says when these people shall believe
[1:39:43] by their own confession and then to top
[1:39:46] it all up in the message. And why is it
[1:39:49] the message is called thy seed.
[1:39:52] shall possess the gate of the enemy. And
[1:39:56] watch
[1:39:58] this says, "Wherever this message may
[1:40:01] go, I claim them. That they are bought,
[1:40:05] they are not their own. They are bought
[1:40:08] with a price, the royal
[1:40:11] seed of Abraham, the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:40:15] Amen.
[1:40:19] And just to quantify the prophet's
[1:40:21] prayer, never is he saying he loves the
[1:40:24] Lord in this prayer. He's just dealing
[1:40:25] with the devil.
[1:40:27] Thou filthy, dirty, stinking, hypocrite,
[1:40:32] deceiver of men.
[1:40:35] Right there. When I quote this
[1:40:37] quotation, there is prayers. I don't
[1:40:39] pray in the public because people might
[1:40:40] hear me cursing out the devil.
[1:40:48] What you think the prophet is doing
[1:40:50] right there?
[1:40:52] Thou filthy, dirty, stinking hypocrite,
[1:40:56] deceiver of men, leading them blindly to
[1:40:58] the ditches of hell. Turn them loose.
[1:41:02] I charge thee by the living God, by the
[1:41:06] sacrifice of his son Jesus, that thou
[1:41:09] turn them loose, that their souls may be
[1:41:12] charged with his blessings and his
[1:41:15] presence, that they might possess the
[1:41:18] gate of every enemy.
[1:41:23] Blank spot on the tape. Oh, brother. I
[1:41:26] like the blank spot on the tape cuz
[1:41:28] there are times when I'm cursing out the
[1:41:29] devil and I tell him, "Now, I've got no
[1:41:31] words for you. I'm using blank spot on
[1:41:33] the tape for
[1:41:35] you. Try it one more time and you see it
[1:41:38] might work." When you've run out of
[1:41:40] words to cast him out, you say, "Right,
[1:41:42] we are now on blank spot on the tape."
[1:41:48] You've got them waiting for this, that,
[1:41:52] or the other, or some holy touch or
[1:41:55] something else. But I'm saying you are
[1:41:57] going to lose your hold.
[1:42:04] So, I don't care what you've come to
[1:42:06] church with. I don't care what you've
[1:42:08] left home. I don't care who's in your
[1:42:11] family that needs your prayer. I've just
[1:42:14] got a word for you. Tell them roots. It
[1:42:17] don't matter where they are. Your prayer
[1:42:20] has GPS. It will locate them any place,
[1:42:23] anytime,
[1:42:26] anywhere. Believers know this. Oh, I
[1:42:29] feel twice my size. It don't matter what
[1:42:32] it is, my brother. We've got the power
[1:42:35] and authority by these quotations. And
[1:42:38] just to prove to you that prayer has
[1:42:40] global positioning system. Once upon a
[1:42:43] time there was a lady who had a boy and
[1:42:46] that boy went with the wrong crowd got
[1:42:48] himself in a vanero disease and she got
[1:42:51] to praying and she got to praying and
[1:42:54] she got to praying says the Shunamite
[1:42:57] woman where is your Elijah? God had to
[1:43:00] go on the global system and say where is
[1:43:03] Elijah? Elijah was in Dallas says, "Let
[1:43:07] me ground the plane in Memphis." Oh,
[1:43:09] brother, you couldn't hide the prophet
[1:43:11] from the prayer of that woman. Oh, the
[1:43:13] prophet's plane was grounded. He decided
[1:43:16] to go around Memphis to see if he can
[1:43:20] shop and post his letters. Then that
[1:43:24] global
[1:43:25] GPS found him moving in a direction
[1:43:29] going to a place out of the normal
[1:43:32] realm. And then he keeps on walking.
[1:43:35] Then he gets to a certain place and
[1:43:37] there's a lady there waiting for him and
[1:43:40] says hello person said how did you know
[1:43:43] I was a person I knew you were coming.
[1:43:45] She had to pray and say is a shulamite.
[1:43:50] So the next thing is Lord put your GPS
[1:43:53] find me where Elijah is and bring him to
[1:43:56] me as my child is in need. We need a
[1:44:00] repeat of a raising of a baby.
[1:44:03] And brother Brah says, "Sister, is that
[1:44:06] true?" And brother needed to test
[1:44:08] whether that sister had the ability to
[1:44:10] have GPS in her prayer. Says, "You pray
[1:44:13] fast." Hallelujah. When she prayed
[1:44:16] first, says, "I knew this woman knew the
[1:44:21] road. I don't know who I'm preaching to,
[1:44:23] but I also believe I'm not here by
[1:44:26] mistake because prayer has global
[1:44:29] positioning. I've got to come here
[1:44:31] somehow and declare to some believer
[1:44:34] that that prayer you prayed in 2018 and
[1:44:37] there seem to be no answer has been
[1:44:40] activated. It's coming to your home if
[1:44:43] you can believe it. There's no stopping
[1:44:45] to that prayer.
[1:44:48] So as we know the boy was saying it's
[1:44:50] dark in here and brother prayed ended up
[1:44:52] changing the testimony it's getting
[1:44:54] light because Elijah had been
[1:44:58] located on his way from Memphis and the
[1:45:00] God who stopped the
[1:45:03] well and made the well swallow Jonah is
[1:45:06] the God who said right since the prayer
[1:45:08] has come from
[1:45:10] Memphis and you are
[1:45:13] going to New York from Dallas we need a
[1:45:17] whis will stop. So since we are in the
[1:45:19] business of making things unpleasant for
[1:45:21] others to bless others,
[1:45:24] let's inconvenience a few businessmen
[1:45:27] because Bar wasn't the only one on that
[1:45:29] plane. So there was a few people
[1:45:31] inconvenienced.
[1:45:33] Because the prayer of Auntie Jamaima was
[1:45:35] so powerful, it didn't matter how many
[1:45:38] schedules you would have missed because
[1:45:39] of her prayer.
[1:45:42] Hallelujah.
[1:45:44] The prayer had to be grounded.
[1:45:46] There had to be a mechanical fault. Some
[1:45:49] mechanic had to make money out of fixing
[1:45:51] that machine.
[1:45:53] And someone had to say, "I'll never use
[1:45:56] Delta
[1:45:58] again." Literally, they know there's a
[1:46:00] lady
[1:46:02] in some project praying. And prayer has
[1:46:06] nothing to do with status. It is
[1:46:08] everything to do with no, do you know
[1:46:10] him? When that lady prayed, the plane
[1:46:13] was grounded. I don't know brothers and
[1:46:16] sisters that whatever it is that has
[1:46:18] brought me to pound west pound in my
[1:46:20] little capacity the little blessing I
[1:46:23] carry I give it to you
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:31] because prayer has global positioning
[1:46:35] and God knowing that prayer has global
[1:46:37] positioning after the boy was healed
[1:46:40] brother was on a train on his way to
[1:46:43] some face. The young man comes on the
[1:46:46] Hello Pass
[1:46:48] Bron I real because you can't recognize
[1:46:51] someone who was uh uh uh whose life had
[1:46:53] been uh dilapidated by sickness.
[1:46:57] I don't believe I know Jesus as the boy
[1:47:00] you prayed for. Uh, in other words, God
[1:47:03] had to allow the prophet to have his
[1:47:05] prayer
[1:47:07] meet him
[1:47:09] as a testimony
[1:47:11] cuz he never knew what happened since
[1:47:13] after that day whether the boy died or
[1:47:15] survived. All he knew is I don't know
[1:47:18] what happened. I was supposed to go to
[1:47:20] New York. We were grounded in Memphis.
[1:47:22] This woman, don't know whether to call
[1:47:23] her crazy or what, but she was called
[1:47:25] Auntie Jamaima. this bold African woman
[1:47:28] like colored green type of lady you know
[1:47:31] colored green
[1:47:33] greet got into her home says you
[1:47:36] couldn't be in any palace and have the
[1:47:38] kind of presence that was in a
[1:47:41] home because of
[1:47:43] that he must have been probably anxious
[1:47:46] to see what ever happened to that boy
[1:47:48] the boy says hello pastor Branam says so
[1:47:51] tell me about yourself says I is that
[1:47:53] boy and I'm saved now and I was
[1:47:57] preaching the gospel. The prayer the
[1:48:00] mother made on dedication
[1:48:03] could never let the go let the boy die.
[1:48:06] And in that condition she realized that
[1:48:08] I was a shunomide woman. And where is
[1:48:11] your Elijah? And Elijah came on the
[1:48:13] spot. And after Elijah came there was
[1:48:16] reckoning where you need to see your
[1:48:17] testimony come to pass.
[1:48:20] One of the after here I'll be preaching
[1:48:23] in uh uh Minnesota. One of the reasons
[1:48:25] I'm going this I didn't know that the
[1:48:27] congregation I was going to preach to in
[1:48:28] Minnesota is called the good shepherd
[1:48:31] and it was in 2023 and in 2023 I was
[1:48:34] preaching about the Lord is my shepherd
[1:48:37] being that it's 2023 uh on a particular
[1:48:40] message uh there is paragraph 23 and
[1:48:44] paragraph 23 also says uh why I tend to
[1:48:47] be shepherds I might get the the things
[1:48:50] wrong don't penalize me I'm trying to
[1:48:51] jog my memory praise the lord all
[1:48:54] Brother says he's a marvelous shepherd
[1:48:56] on paragraph 23. And I was so excited
[1:48:59] about this theme I had in 2023. I find
[1:49:02] myself in Minnesota and I couldn't enjoy
[1:49:04] Minnesota like Florida cuz of the
[1:49:06] weather, you know. Praise the
[1:49:08] Lord. And there was a lady stage 4
[1:49:11] cancer. That brother was there. They
[1:49:12] brought her in front to be prayed for. I
[1:49:14] said I had read a quotation. in the
[1:49:16] quotation brother says as quickly as as
[1:49:19] Moses put his arm under the hand and
[1:49:21] took it out that's how the leprosy
[1:49:24] disappeared and then I made a
[1:49:26] declaration I did not know that there
[1:49:27] was a lady with stage four cancer so I
[1:49:30] said bring her we prayed for her and the
[1:49:33] last I realized about 3 four 5 months
[1:49:35] later I had uh a medical report from
[1:49:39] brother one and brother one said brother
[1:49:41] Crosby you will not believe this this
[1:49:43] lady is extremely applicants are free.
[1:49:47] So I'm going there just to see
[1:49:52] the testimony so that I can have
[1:49:54] confidence that I have left some demons
[1:49:56] out of order here.
[1:50:00] Yeah. Praise the Lord. So what you
[1:50:02] notice with the the lady, the Memphis
[1:50:06] lady, her prayer had GPS. Was she the
[1:50:10] only one?
[1:50:12] There was a young
[1:50:14] lady. She
[1:50:16] was 9 years 8 months in a in a bedridden
[1:50:22] condition. Name is Georgie Carter.
[1:50:25] Brother Brah didn't know there was a
[1:50:27] place called Miltown. Then came this
[1:50:30] little lamp bleeting
[1:50:33] Miltown. Brother kind of like says
[1:50:35] there's a strange uh sound I hear in my
[1:50:38] spirit saying Miltown. Says is there a
[1:50:40] place called Miltown? Oh yeah. It's a
[1:50:42] few miles from Indiana. We'll take you
[1:50:43] to Miltown. There's a Baptist church.
[1:50:45] When he gets there, he finds the janitor
[1:50:48] just waiting by the door and says, "Oh,
[1:50:49] we'd like to have service." But the
[1:50:52] young girl Georgie Carter had been in
[1:50:56] that condition because a relative had uh
[1:51:01] uh violated her and she ended up with a
[1:51:05] tobaccois
[1:51:07] uh tobacosis or pneumonia that made her
[1:51:09] crippled for that for that long. The one
[1:51:12] thing I love about her testimony, she
[1:51:14] never said why me Lord.
[1:51:18] Most people just at the scratch not
[1:51:21] something severe you
[1:51:23] complain. She never did that. And as she
[1:51:26] was in that condition, she found a book
[1:51:28] written Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:51:30] today and forever. She began to read the
[1:51:33] book. Said, "I wonder whether this God
[1:51:35] still exists." And then she begin to
[1:51:37] pray. That prayer had GPS. Yes sir. It
[1:51:40] went and located William Brham wherever
[1:51:42] he was. And when it located William
[1:51:44] Branham wherever he was, he came and the
[1:51:48] parents of this this little girl did not
[1:51:50] want their child to have false hope. But
[1:51:54] she believed but because location had
[1:51:57] been established by the global
[1:51:58] positioning system, God had to make sure
[1:52:00] that the day brother goes to pray for
[1:52:03] these the parents are not there. When he
[1:52:06] got there, prayed for this little girl,
[1:52:08] she immediately rose out of bed, started
[1:52:12] blessing the grass. When the parents saw
[1:52:15] the girl, they
[1:52:17] fainted. That's the power of prayer
[1:52:20] having a global positioning system.
[1:52:23] Praise the Lord. I have one extreme
[1:52:25] example as well. How many know the case
[1:52:28] where brother Brown found himself out of
[1:52:29] the will of God in South Africa?
[1:52:32] Courtesy of the brotherhood. He was
[1:52:35] supposed to go to a certain place and
[1:52:36] the brothers way laid him to where it
[1:52:39] was convenient for them. And brother Bam
[1:52:41] kept telling the brothers, "We are out
[1:52:42] of the will of
[1:52:43] God." This is where Billy Paulo made
[1:52:46] those remarkable statements. Says,
[1:52:47] "Daddy, if we have to walk to America,
[1:52:48] we'll have to do it. I'll stick by you."
[1:52:51] And FF Bosworth, who I believe is from
[1:52:53] Florida, had to say, "Why' you always
[1:52:55] think that you were the only man of
[1:52:57] God?" They didn't realize that this was
[1:52:58] a major prophet. And that says the whole
[1:53:01] thought that he's just a he was just a
[1:53:04] better
[1:53:04] Pentecostal. Brother said, "Okay, for
[1:53:07] you brothers to understand that we are
[1:53:08] out of the will of God, I'm going to
[1:53:09] tell you what's going to happen from
[1:53:10] this moment on.
[1:53:12] There shall be a storm." Then the storm
[1:53:15] came. He says, "Ah, now what else is he
[1:53:18] going to say now?" And he says, "Okay,
[1:53:20] tomorrow we are traveling.
[1:53:24] When we get to a certain place, we shall
[1:53:26] see a lady selling beads and curios like
[1:53:31] art and she's going to have half a head
[1:53:34] shown
[1:53:36] uh because she's got a scar on her head
[1:53:39] and then shortly afterwards there's
[1:53:40] going to be a very very strange bed fly
[1:53:43] over. Then you will know we are out of
[1:53:46] the will of God.
[1:53:48] So as they got on their trip then they
[1:53:50] see the lady exactly the way the prophet
[1:53:53] described and then shortly afterwards a
[1:53:57] bird flew a wild
[1:53:59] peacock. Then all the men agreed we are
[1:54:02] out of the will of God and brother says
[1:54:04] from henceforth now let me be the one in
[1:54:08] control.
[1:54:09] So as they were traveling, Brother Bram
[1:54:11] just suddenly makes them
[1:54:13] stop at a
[1:54:16] forest like a place like probably the
[1:54:18] Everglades where there is wild South
[1:54:21] Africa says stop right here. Take that
[1:54:24] dirt road. Follow it up until I tell you
[1:54:27] to
[1:54:28] stop. They did exactly what the prophet
[1:54:30] said. They knew better because they knew
[1:54:33] the terrain of South Africa that there
[1:54:34] is no way we're going to the uh uh
[1:54:37] villages, the native villages. So
[1:54:39] there's no way we're going. But they
[1:54:41] knew we can't argue this time because
[1:54:44] he's already shown us the level of a
[1:54:46] prophet that he is. So as they get
[1:54:49] there, brother says, "Stop at a village
[1:54:51] in the middle of
[1:54:53] nowhere, gets out of that car, goes
[1:54:56] straight to a round rendevo heart, walks
[1:54:59] right in there. There's a lady who had
[1:55:02] been isolated with
[1:55:03] tuberculosis and she was left to die but
[1:55:06] she had prayed and her prayer had GPS
[1:55:10] and when she prayed God told her I'm
[1:55:13] sending you a white man to pray for you
[1:55:15] from America and when she woke up and
[1:55:17] told the rest of the people they all
[1:55:19] said oh I'm sure the pneumonia or
[1:55:22] whatever has gone to the head when the
[1:55:26] white men arrived she was the only one
[1:55:27] in the village who could speak English
[1:55:30] brother went in never said nothing to
[1:55:32] nobody prayed for her and she was
[1:55:35] immediately healed and then she came out
[1:55:38] says that's what I told you her prayer
[1:55:42] had global positioning system to locate
[1:55:45] the prophet and bring the prophet at her
[1:55:48] doorstep
[1:55:52] ain't God so awesome that he will do the
[1:55:55] exceeding abundant above what you can
[1:55:58] pray ask or think as I'm saying this,
[1:56:00] let your prayers come back to your
[1:56:03] doorstep
[1:56:04] because he's capable of doing it. He did
[1:56:07] it to this woman. And now imagine,
[1:56:11] picture this for yourself. The prophet
[1:56:14] was out of the will of God. But the
[1:56:17] prayer of the woman somehow connected
[1:56:19] with the prophet out of the will of God
[1:56:21] to bring her to her doorstep. How
[1:56:23] powerful is prayer?
[1:56:25] Amen.
[1:56:27] The whole activity of being out of the
[1:56:30] will of God could have been incited by
[1:56:32] the prayer of that woman.
[1:56:37] The other example, there was a lady
[1:56:40] called Florence
[1:56:42] Nightingale. You all know these from the
[1:56:45] stories. Thin dying. She prayed for
[1:56:49] healing while in South Africa.
[1:56:52] and she knew that somehow she needs to
[1:56:56] have brother Brandham pray for
[1:56:57] her. They flew her to London and somehow
[1:57:01] brother Brahma was coming from America
[1:57:04] to London. As brother Bram
[1:57:07] landed, the lady's plane also landed on
[1:57:10] another
[1:57:11] runway. Who organized the meeting that
[1:57:14] two planes collide as
[1:57:18] one at a time? By the time this lady
[1:57:22] came, brother saw a dove. He said,
[1:57:24] "Let's go pray for the lady." By the
[1:57:26] time the lady saw brother bra, her first
[1:57:29] words were, "Brother Brham, pray for me
[1:57:32] to die."
[1:57:34] says, "I will do no such thing. God
[1:57:36] shown me that you're going to be well."
[1:57:37] Because if she was meant to die, she
[1:57:41] could have died on the plane in South
[1:57:44] Africa. There was ample opportunities
[1:57:47] for death to present itself. Brother,
[1:57:49] there comes a time that your prayer, no
[1:57:52] matter what circumstances are around
[1:57:53] you, can never change the ability for
[1:57:57] your prayer to find you.
[1:57:59] You might have got tired, said, "You
[1:58:02] know what? I've been in this case for
[1:58:04] too long. I'm giving up. But your prayer
[1:58:06] won't give up on
[1:58:09] you. And brother Bam prayed for that
[1:58:11] lady and we know the rest is history. We
[1:58:14] have a before picture and an after
[1:58:15] picture and that was brother's signal to
[1:58:18] go and preach to Africa.
[1:58:20] It was the prayer of Florence
[1:58:22] Nightingale that God global positioning
[1:58:25] system located William Brham from
[1:58:27] Jeffersonville brought them both to a
[1:58:29] neutral ground in London and prayer was
[1:58:31] given and the rest is
[1:58:34] history. As I'm winding down and
[1:58:36] sobering up, I wonder how many things
[1:58:39] are in your life that you've been
[1:58:42] constantly saying, I'm going to pray and
[1:58:44] pray until this happens. I've got news
[1:58:46] for you tonight.
[1:58:48] My presence signals the activation of
[1:58:51] your prayer. Your prayer is going to
[1:58:53] locate you. Prayer has the ability to
[1:58:57] locate. I'm reminded of Elia Elaza.
[1:59:00] Thank you, Lord. Looking to bring a wife
[1:59:04] for his master. He prayed. He said,
[1:59:07] "Lord, let me meet Rebecca. Let me meet
[1:59:10] a woman. Let the woman feed my camels.
[1:59:14] And after feeding my camels, let the
[1:59:16] woman feed
[1:59:19] me. As true as prayer finds its GPS,
[1:59:24] comes this little damel, unpretentious,
[1:59:27] comes by the well. She's the all alone.
[1:59:29] For some reason, there ain't no sisters
[1:59:31] that decided to come with her to the
[1:59:32] well. I don't believe she was a lone
[1:59:34] ranger. But at this point in time, to
[1:59:36] meet the prayer of Elaza, she had to be
[1:59:39] alone by the well.
[1:59:41] She gets by the well. Then comes this
[1:59:43] man with a strange thing and says, "Can
[1:59:45] you feed my camels?" How you expect an
[1:59:48] 18year-old, 16 year old, do you know how
[1:59:51] many liters a camel drinks? And do you
[1:59:53] know how many camels he had? She gave
[1:59:56] them all
[1:59:59] to
[2:00:00] drink. Instead of being grateful and
[2:00:02] say, "Young lady, you've done so much. I
[2:00:04] will at least grab some water for
[2:00:05] myself." She also says, "I'm now waiting
[2:00:09] for the second part of my prayer." And
[2:00:11] the young girl, instead of being
[2:00:12] flustered and saying, "You know what?
[2:00:13] I've been feeding all your camels. You
[2:00:15] got 10 camels and each camel takes 100
[2:00:17] liters. I'm so tired. I ain't having
[2:00:19] this. I ain't having this."
[2:00:28] The lady simply said, "So
[2:00:31] since the comes drunk, would you like
[2:00:32] some water as well?" Some water
[2:00:34] according to American lingu. Would you
[2:00:36] like some water?
[2:00:39] All that was prayer finding GPS.
[2:00:44] Then there's another example I'd like to
[2:00:48] throw. There was a time brother Brham
[2:00:50] had a
[2:00:51] vision that is going to bring a revival
[2:00:54] to the west coast. That's Los Angeles
[2:00:56] area where Pentecost was merging
[2:01:00] into the real true Pentecost of the
[2:01:02] message of the hour.
[2:01:04] So there was a family that were praying
[2:01:06] for a revival, a black family. God
[2:01:09] revealed to them that God is going to
[2:01:11] send his servant William Branham to the
[2:01:12] west coast. So they gave the name
[2:01:15] William Marion Branham. Amen. Amen. I
[2:01:19] believe the the bride for who I've come
[2:01:21] to add and the family have also decided
[2:01:24] to hear their pastor preach. Come
[2:01:27] through. God bless you. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:35] They
[2:01:38] decide. You know
[2:01:45] what? We'll let them settle for a
[2:01:50] minute. How many believe player has
[2:01:53] global positioning system?
[2:01:57] So
[2:01:58] these uh uh believers who were watching
[2:02:03] the events and watching the the
[2:02:05] Christian clock calendar, they came to
[2:02:07] that point where they said there must be
[2:02:09] a
[2:02:10] revival. So every time a revivalist
[2:02:13] would come to the west coast, they would
[2:02:15] look at the name cuz names used to be
[2:02:17] advertised.
[2:02:19] Jack Core, man of the moment,
[2:02:22] preaching, aa
[2:02:24] Allen, you name them. All those guys
[2:02:27] when they came their names would be
[2:02:30] advertised. Then one day they were late
[2:02:32] for late for church. So they didn't get
[2:02:34] the advert that it was William Marion
[2:02:37] Brham. But they see the things that
[2:02:39] brother Braham is doing in the in the
[2:02:41] prayer line and in front. The young man
[2:02:44] comes from the back, rushes right up to
[2:02:47] the front, has a very weird request to
[2:02:50] brother Bran and says, just comes
[2:02:53] violently just steps in front of
[2:02:54] brother, what is your name? What is your
[2:02:57] name? And brother found it very strange
[2:02:59] that in all my preaching, I've never met
[2:03:01] anyone who confronts me. All they want
[2:03:03] is my name. And brother says, well, it
[2:03:07] can't hurt for me to just give them my
[2:03:08] name. Braham says, "My name is William
[2:03:12] Marion Branham." The young boy just
[2:03:15] looks at the back says, "Mama, it's
[2:03:18] him." Their prayer had located the
[2:03:21] prophecy that was given way before.
[2:03:26] Yes, sir. Because in their prayer
[2:03:29] request, they wrote the name William
[2:03:30] Maron Brham and put it in a trunk and
[2:03:33] forgot about it. They were waiting to
[2:03:35] see.
[2:03:37] Just like just like uh uh uh uh Anna and
[2:03:44] Simeon were waiting to see the
[2:03:47] redemption of Israel.
[2:03:49] So your expectation in the things that
[2:03:52] you pray for
[2:03:54] when you understand by revelation that
[2:03:58] now Solomon's prayer had that latitude
[2:04:02] to help generations until Jesus came to
[2:04:04] override that prayer which then was now
[2:04:08] amplified by the coming of William
[2:04:10] Branaman praying
[2:04:13] for the people wherever the message may
[2:04:15] go. Yes sir. and he claimed them.
[2:04:20] How much more is your prayer powerful?
[2:04:25] Praise the Lord. Prayer has GPS. If you
[2:04:28] remember, there was a time brother Welsh
[2:04:30] even lost or rather his car was stolen.
[2:04:36] And brother Bram in the prayer says,
[2:04:38] "Let's locate
[2:04:41] global positioning system.
[2:04:48] I wonder brothers and sisters how many
[2:04:50] times we've neglected to
[2:04:52] locate because remember the quotation I
[2:04:55] started with. It says God omnisient, all
[2:04:58] powerful, omnipresent, knows all things.
[2:05:02] He's just here as he is there. Which
[2:05:04] means you can pray for someone here
[2:05:08] who is in a location because God don't
[2:05:11] need time and distance. Amen. Praise the
[2:05:14] Lord. Allow me to finish with the last
[2:05:16] quote. I always like to finish with a
[2:05:18] quote of a descendant to see how brother
[2:05:21] Abraham did the things that we're
[2:05:22] talking about. Praise the
[2:05:26] Lord.
[2:05:28] Yeah. What year is thou
[2:05:31] Elijah? Remember this is the same tape I
[2:05:33] used to take the first quote which says
[2:05:36] you can't hide a saint from his prayer.
[2:05:38] He's finished preaching that and then
[2:05:40] there's a lady in in need and she needs
[2:05:43] to be descended. So brother says the
[2:05:46] lady standing here is very nervous and
[2:05:49] she's really needing an
[2:05:53] operation because she's got hemorrhoids
[2:05:56] and those hemorrhoids are breaking and
[2:05:58] bleeding. That's right, isn't it? If
[2:06:01] that's right, raise up your hand. Now
[2:06:04] what note
[2:06:06] that? Now, whatever I told
[2:06:09] her, I don't know. See, that wasn't that
[2:06:14] wasn't that was not my voice. It was my
[2:06:17] lips moving. But something is telling us
[2:06:20] something that wasn't
[2:06:25] me. Now, Brother catches a wave from the
[2:06:30] audience. Now, you say, "You might have
[2:06:32] guessed that, brother." All right, let's
[2:06:36] talk to her just a moment longer so that
[2:06:38] the anointing of the spirit will get
[2:06:41] into the
[2:06:42] building. Now, let me just talk to her
[2:06:45] again. Yes, here it comes again. Find me
[2:06:49] any of these funny prophets that could
[2:06:52] repeat and ask God to come and redo what
[2:06:54] he has done.
[2:06:56] Only William Brham could do that.
[2:07:00] He was a cut above the rest. Yes, sir.
[2:07:03] Amen.
[2:07:05] Says the woman is conscious that
[2:07:08] something is going on. Did you ever see
[2:07:11] the picture the scientific world has
[2:07:13] taken that angel of the Lord? That's
[2:07:16] just what's on you.
[2:07:21] Wow. If you audience, the radio or
[2:07:24] wherever you could see right here
[2:07:26] between me and that woman is that light
[2:07:28] milling
[2:07:33] around. I don't suppose God will allow
[2:07:36] us to preach about the angel of the Lord
[2:07:39] and he not follow the message wherever
[2:07:40] we preach it.
[2:07:43] And then he says the woman is facing an
[2:07:45] operation. It's bleeding hemorrhoids.
[2:07:48] Repeating the first
[2:07:51] descendment says here, "And I keep
[2:07:53] seeing some elderly person keeps
[2:07:55] appearing here. It's a man. It's her
[2:07:57] dad. And he's got a dark shadow over
[2:08:00] him. He's dying with
[2:08:02] cancer. She's here. He's somewhere
[2:08:05] else." But global positioning system has
[2:08:08] allowed the prophet said, "Right here
[2:08:10] where we are, there's a pillow of fire
[2:08:12] milling, but where your dad is, there's
[2:08:15] a dark shadow."
[2:08:18] says
[2:08:19] here, "Oh, he's in hospital in a great
[2:08:22] city where there is a river runs through
[2:08:24] it. It's St. Louis, Missouri."
[2:08:28] That's one of the things that made me
[2:08:29] say, "Maybe I will preach this because
[2:08:32] uh brother Simba comes from St. Louis,
[2:08:34] Missouri."
[2:08:36] And the prophet says, "Thus say the
[2:08:38] Lord." That's right. Is that true? Do
[2:08:42] you
[2:08:43] believe the Lord? Do you believe God
[2:08:46] could reveal to me this who this woman
[2:08:48] is by this time the woman's name is not
[2:08:51] yet revealed
[2:08:53] or that would help your faith. Now
[2:08:56] sister I don't know what he will which
[2:08:59] means by this time he's still depending
[2:09:01] on that energy of the
[2:09:03] supernatural. And then he
[2:09:06] says I'm just asking his grace. Soon as
[2:09:10] it finishes saying I'm just asking his
[2:09:12] grace, the name pops up. Your name is
[2:09:16] Alice. Spade is your
[2:09:19] surname. Your last name, right? Return
[2:09:23] home and you can receive what you ask
[2:09:26] for in the name of the Lord. In other
[2:09:29] words, the pillar of fire that was with
[2:09:31] the prophet and the lady milling in
[2:09:33] front can actually leave that place and
[2:09:36] go to the hospital in St. Louis Miri and
[2:09:40] deliver the father because prayer has
[2:09:44] GPS.
[2:09:46] No sooner had I finished preaching this
[2:09:48] in my church. There was a a brother and
[2:09:50] a sister who came with the exact same
[2:09:55] diagnosis of their mother
[2:09:59] hemorrhoids. Exactly the way the
[2:10:01] quotation is. They were sitting right at
[2:10:04] the back. And as they were sitting they
[2:10:06] said if prayer has GPS our mother is
[2:10:09] unwell and is in Zimbabwe we want to
[2:10:13] send
[2:10:15] because prayer is gloal
[2:10:19] positioning
[2:10:21] system. No sooner had that happened, it
[2:10:25] didn't take a few days. Their mother was
[2:10:26] due for an operation just like Sister
[2:10:29] Alice sped. Hemorrhoids just like Sister
[2:10:31] Alice Ped. Everything this quotation
[2:10:33] speaks was exactly the matter with the
[2:10:36] mother. And the following week, a
[2:10:39] testimony came back. Our mother has not
[2:10:43] been operated. The tummy that was
[2:10:46] swelling and the hemorrhoids, they have
[2:10:48] all gone down. She's been discharged and
[2:10:51] she's well because prayer has GPS.
[2:10:57] It made well Shivans locate his car
[2:11:00] through the prayer of brother Brham.
[2:11:02] Georgie Carter was located through
[2:11:04] prayer. It was her prayer that you
[2:11:07] couldn't hide from. I wonder how many of
[2:11:10] you have offered prayers and you're
[2:11:12] wondering whatever happened to that
[2:11:13] prayer. I've got news for you. As I call
[2:11:16] brother Smiley, God had your prayer.
[2:11:19] He's just activated it. If you can
[2:11:22] receive
[2:11:24] it, it will happen in your life in the
[2:11:27] simplicity of repeating these quotes. We
[2:11:30] don't repeat these quotes for nothing.
[2:11:33] It's because we believe God sent a
[2:11:35] prophet and that prophet has a claim on
[2:11:39] our lives and he claimed us in the
[2:11:43] message, thy seed shall possess the gate
[2:11:47] of the enemy. Amen. I don't mind being
[2:11:50] claimed by my prophet.
[2:11:54] Prayer has global positioning. The
[2:11:59] prayer that sister Wright
[2:12:03] prayed when she had her boys
[2:12:07] weward
[2:12:08] had seemingly appeared not effective
[2:12:12] until one day brother Brah experiences
[2:12:15] his third pool. they're sharing it with
[2:12:17] the families. All she did was say,
[2:12:20] "Brother Abraham, that's nothing but the
[2:12:21] truth." Then that prayer of the children
[2:12:25] had to be activated right then. And when
[2:12:27] it was
[2:12:28] activated, the Holy Spirit said to
[2:12:30] brother Brah, tell her to ask what she
[2:12:35] will. Brother, when you meet up with
[2:12:37] your prayer, things become easy. It's as
[2:12:41] if you never really agonized for that
[2:12:43] thing. Praise the Lord. That's how
[2:12:46] powerful the message of this day is. It
[2:12:50] makes things happen. If brother could uh
[2:12:54] claim us, if the Lord Jesus Christ said,
[2:12:56] "I've only lost the son of pedition." It
[2:12:58] gives me the uncction to tell you
[2:13:00] brothers and sisters, we will not lose
[2:13:01] our children to this world.
[2:13:04] Because an audit was done. The prayer
[2:13:07] you prayed for that baby on dedication
[2:13:11] can hunt for them when they least
[2:13:13] expect. Bruises and cuts they might have
[2:13:16] but they will never be lost.
[2:13:19] They can never be lost. They will never
[2:13:22] be lost and they can't be lost because
[2:13:26] prayer
[2:13:27] you can't hide a saint from their
[2:13:30] prayer. Amen. Or they will have
[2:13:32] challenges that will challenge your
[2:13:34] faith. But you stick to knowing that.
[2:13:36] Brother Crossby came once upon a time in
[2:13:38] West Palm Beach. He told us, "Brother,
[2:13:39] sister, don't give up on your prayers.
[2:13:42] There will be a day that that prayer
[2:13:44] will energize and it will go hunting."
[2:13:48] And I always used to wonder why when he
[2:13:50] prays, he says, "Lord, give them a
[2:13:53] conviction."
[2:13:55] means the prayer can so hunt for you
[2:13:59] better than a a US marshal can hunt for
[2:14:01] you.
[2:14:04] You can't hide when you've been prayed
[2:14:06] for. And I like them old negro mothers
[2:14:10] that would say, "Child,
[2:14:14] child,
[2:14:18] child, you ain't going nowhere.
[2:14:22] You tripping right now.
[2:14:25] But you going to come back. You going to
[2:14:27] come back crawling, but coming you will.
[2:14:31] That's the assurance we have with the
[2:14:33] message of the hour. Nothing missing,
[2:14:35] nothing broken. Somebody say amen to
[2:14:38] that. Can you give God some serious
[2:14:41] praise? Appreciate him for
[2:14:44] activating a prayer you thought he had
[2:14:47] forgotten.
[2:15:10] We prayed for this a long time
[2:15:13] ago and now I can't believe we are in
[2:15:16] Miami. Yo,
[2:15:22] you can't hide a saint. No, sir. If
[2:15:25] you're not serious about getting
[2:15:26] anything from God, just don't pray about
[2:15:29] it.
[2:15:31] Leave it alone.
[2:15:33] But the moment you are serious that God
[2:15:36] answers prayer, you best be assured that
[2:15:41] prayer is going to hunt for you
[2:15:43] irregardless.
[2:15:45] Even when you are tired, that prayer
[2:15:48] goes, "Come on, wake up. You prayed for
[2:15:50] this to happen. Go on child. Go on." You
[2:15:54] think it was fun for Jonah to be in the
[2:15:57] belly of a wolf for three days and three
[2:15:58] nights. But when he prayed and said,
[2:16:00] "Lord, nevertheless, let your will be
[2:16:02] done." Said, "Fine, I hear you."
[2:16:06] You might think you're on your way to
[2:16:08] Tashish, but nine of you will arrive and
[2:16:11] you shall arrive in style. That's the
[2:16:14] God we serve.
[2:16:16] And I would like to attribute this
[2:16:17] sermon to the statement that brother
[2:16:19] Smiley said when he
[2:16:20] said, "Don't you serve?" What did he
[2:16:24] say, "Brother Solomon?"
[2:16:28] He said, "I wrote the words cuz I was
[2:16:30] just arriving the statements. Aren't you
[2:16:33] glad you serve a God that can let
[2:16:38] go? Amen.
[2:16:43] Let me ask as our brother asked, "Aren't
[2:16:45] you glad you serve a God? How many times
[2:16:48] would you have let go your own prayer?"
[2:16:53] Just on Friday before flying out, I
[2:16:55] preached from a quotation where brother
[2:16:57] came and told a certain lady that had
[2:16:59] been barren for 40 or so 45 or so years,
[2:17:04] no child. And brother told her, "Thus
[2:17:06] say the Lord, you're going to have a
[2:17:08] child." And she
[2:17:10] doubted. And then fast forward 7 years
[2:17:12] later, at the age of 53, Brother is
[2:17:15] about to dismiss. Says, "I'm about to go
[2:17:17] to Canada to dedicate a church and there
[2:17:20] is a lady
[2:17:22] there whose baby I'm going to
[2:17:26] dedicate." But in between she doubted.
[2:17:29] But her prayer goes back to that
[2:17:31] statement. You can't hide a saint from
[2:17:35] their prayer.
[2:17:38] At 53, she
[2:17:41] prolonged. She could have had that child
[2:17:43] in her 40s.
[2:17:45] But thank God, the prayer had already
[2:17:47] had GPS placed on it. Amen.
[2:17:51] Go back to your Christian life and think
[2:17:53] of the many prayers you've made and some
[2:17:54] of the prayers you've actually said what
[2:17:56] you've now counter prayed against.
[2:18:01] God has his angels and his people that
[2:18:04] he says let's select when they prayed
[2:18:06] really seriously and desperately. If
[2:18:08] that prayer is ever located when you
[2:18:11] were serious that prayer will have GPS
[2:18:14] activation and it will come to
[2:18:17] pass. Praise the Lord. That's why would
[2:18:21] say I've been a believer for 32 years.
[2:18:23] I've never asked God for
[2:18:26] anything but it came to pass. If it
[2:18:29] didn't come to pass, you'd have to tell
[2:18:32] me why as we rise to our feet.
[2:18:42] The devil is a liar.
[2:18:46] I like how the prophet prays in that
[2:18:48] message,
[2:18:50] "Thy seed shall possess the gate of the
[2:18:54] enemy." It's far. It's far advanced.
[2:18:57] It's praying deeper than a
[2:19:00] Pentecostal. I I'm not saying never pray
[2:19:02] and say I love the Lord. You do that.
[2:19:05] But there is times where your prayer is
[2:19:07] just telling the devil his
[2:19:10] position. A
[2:19:12] and there are so many examples in the
[2:19:15] message that you see that actually the
[2:19:18] things that the prophet would say in
[2:19:20] such simplicity were so powerful. I
[2:19:23] wonder is there some believer with our
[2:19:24] eyes closed
[2:19:29] who's doubted some of their prayers and
[2:19:30] they've thought that God has
[2:19:33] forgotten and you think that God does
[2:19:36] not know you by name. Most of the time
[2:19:38] you're looking at your symptoms and the
[2:19:40] things that you go through and you think
[2:19:42] to yourself, does God really know me?
[2:19:45] I'm here to tell you, he does.
[2:19:50] If the time and season for your blessing
[2:19:52] to be ushered arrives, he will do the
[2:19:56] exceeding
[2:19:58] abundant
[2:20:00] above what you pray, ask or
[2:20:03] think. He's capable of doing
[2:20:07] that. Like to give a benediction over
[2:20:10] your
[2:20:11] life. Great God of heaven. Father, in
[2:20:15] the simplicity of these
[2:20:17] quotes, how almighty God, you made there
[2:20:20] be a season of the potency of Solomon's
[2:20:24] prayer that whoever looked at the
[2:20:25] temple, they would get their
[2:20:28] deliverance. How you made it so
[2:20:30] proficient until even Jonah said, "Once
[2:20:33] more, will I look to the temple?" Yet,
[2:20:36] Lord, it's practically impossible to
[2:20:38] look in the belly of a whale. But
[2:20:41] somehow he did it. Then came the time of
[2:20:45] the Lord Jesus Christ that he says if I
[2:20:48] be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me.
[2:20:51] Look and leave was the moto of the day.
[2:20:55] Father you then came to the point of the
[2:20:58] end of his ministry before the advent of
[2:21:01] the Holy Ghost. You prayed for his
[2:21:03] believers and you prayed for those that
[2:21:06] would come. That would be us. Says we
[2:21:08] should be covered by the same prayer.
[2:21:12] Lord Peter and the rest of the disciples
[2:21:15] got revelation when they got to the gate
[2:21:16] called beautiful. They were not
[2:21:20] flustered. They knew you were able to do
[2:21:23] what you had promised in your word.
[2:21:25] Said, "Silver and gold have a none such
[2:21:27] as I have rise up and walk." Men that
[2:21:30] had been crippled for years rose up.
[2:21:32] Yet, Lord, they were not even in the
[2:21:34] temple.
[2:21:36] No doubt almighty God the things that
[2:21:38] you do they are crazy to the world but
[2:21:41] to us them make so much spiritual
[2:21:44] sense and father now comes our prophet
[2:21:47] in our day says thy seed shall possess
[2:21:50] the gate of the enemy he makes a prayer
[2:21:53] that covers
[2:21:54] us says wherever this message may go and
[2:21:58] I believe the message is here in West
[2:22:00] Palm Beach may the devil squeak his
[2:22:03] brakes Lord I plead your blood upon the
[2:22:05] saints is here. And also I pray for
[2:22:08] brother Jack and bless his congregation
[2:22:11] and his family. Father, for the trust
[2:22:14] he's given that I could stand in his
[2:22:16] pull pit in his absence. Let it be
[2:22:19] almighty God he receives a double
[2:22:20] portion for that. Bless him in Jesus
[2:22:23] name.
[2:22:25] Lord, here are your children.
[2:22:28] [Music]
[2:22:30] Whatever challenge they have
[2:22:32] had, we come like sister
[2:22:34] spade. Say whether the challenge is at
[2:22:37] home or in some place else. There is no
[2:22:41] limitation to the distance of prayer
[2:22:43] because prayer has global positioning
[2:22:46] system. Let the prayer of the saints
[2:22:48] find them when they need to be found.
[2:22:52] Thank you Lord for allowing me the
[2:22:54] privilege to come thus far and to stand
[2:22:56] before your people. I ask for blessing
[2:22:59] over myself, my family and the
[2:23:01] congregation I've left in England and
[2:23:04] also for the wedding we shall have
[2:23:06] tomorrow. May your blessings go ahead of
[2:23:08] us. It is prayer that has brought us
[2:23:10] this far. We thank you. We love you. We
[2:23:14] thoroughly appreciate you for your
[2:23:15] goodness and your mercy and also ask for
[2:23:18] a special blessing on brother Billy,
[2:23:20] sister
[2:23:21] Alian. Remember them, Lord. Oh God, put
[2:23:24] a GPS in their prayers. Let it be
[2:23:27] almighty God their prayers are able to
[2:23:29] locate them. We thank you. We love you.
[2:23:33] We bless your name in the name of Jesus
[2:23:35] Christ. Amen and amen. Thank you Lord
[2:23:48] Jesus.
[2:23:49] Hallelujah. Everybody say praise the
[2:23:52] Lord. Amen. Brother
[2:23:55] Malico, he wasn't here a couple of weeks
[2:23:57] ago, but brother Jack announced that we
[2:24:01] uh we're having a Friday tape service.
[2:24:04] It was from the very message that he
[2:24:06] preached from. The seed thy seed shall
[2:24:09] possess the gates of his enemy. It was
[2:24:12] to prepare a ground for a people and he
[2:24:14] would come and instruct us on what we
[2:24:16] had to do next. We have to believe God
[2:24:19] and take him at his word. Amen. We got
[2:24:22] to tell the devil to squeak his brakes.
[2:24:26] Amen. You You believe you can make the
[2:24:28] devil squeak his brakes. Amen. Just
[2:24:30] recognize who you are. That's what the
[2:24:33] ministry of the word is to do. When God
[2:24:35] unveiled the seals, he unveiled who he
[2:24:38] was. He unveiled who Sat was, but he
[2:24:40] also unveiled who we are. Amen. Let's
[2:24:43] let's let's change that song. We got to
[2:24:46] realize exactly right. We are that
[2:24:48] chosen. We going to sing it. We are a
[2:24:51] chosen
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:53] generation called to show his

[2:30:05] hearts. Heavenly Father, what grace,
[2:30:08] Lord Jesus, that you have bestowed on
[2:30:11] us. Father, you would

[2:30:16] the sea, Lord Jesus, just to deliver a
[2:30:20] message to us, Lord Jesus, that our
[2:30:22] prayers have been activated, Lord Jesus.
[2:30:26] There are many things, Lord, that we
[2:30:27] have been praying for for years, Lord
[2:30:29] Jesus. Oh Lord, but it has come to your
[2:30:32] remembrance, Almighty God. And we're so
[2:30:36] grateful, Lord God, that you will send
[2:30:37] your humble servant this way, Lord, to
[2:30:39] be a blessing to your people, Lord
[2:30:42] Jesus. And we are blessed, Lord. We're
[2:30:44] grateful, Lord, for the word that we've
[2:30:46] heard this morning, for your presence
[2:30:47] amongst us, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray
[2:30:50] for our brother, Lord Jesus. Lord, he
[2:30:53] has so much work to do while he's over
[2:30:55] here in in this country, Lord Jesus, we
[2:30:58] just pray that you'll be with him.
[2:30:59] You'll go before him, make his way
[2:31:01] prosperous. You'll bless him every way
[2:31:03] he turns, Lord Jesus. And Lord, as he
[2:31:06] has been a blessing to us, Lord, may the
[2:31:08] people be a blessing to him, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:10] Oh father, continue to provide strength
[2:31:12] and leadership and direction to him.
[2:31:14] Lord, help him as he pastors, Lord, the
[2:31:17] sheep that you have for him at
