amen but I tell you we were talking about that on on um on Friday night while we were here setting up and um you know I I want to just say that I am I think it's a blessing that we have people uh that want to come fellowship with us and um um I mean you know it uh from all over people just want to just come and be in Fellowship uh with us and and um I don't take it for granted but uh I'm I'm grateful that we have that and then on top of that uh you know if I if I didn't say no to some people uh I'd still be just sitting and waiting and you know and I don't mind that but uh at this time of year a lot of people feel led to come to Florida you know what I'm saying right and then there are certain Ministries I know going to be a blessing to the church and I said you know y'all can hear me Wednesday nights sometime you can hear me on Sunday morning but I I we got ministers here and I try try to get everybody work uh you know I know some Churches only the pastor preach you got all these ministers only Pastor preach I try not to be one of them churches God give us people that can feed us and last last week we ate in plenty and we were satisfied and and and them brothers only took 15 minutes imagine if they would have took a whole hour you would have went out of here rolling you but I just thank God for what he's doing in spirit and Truth Tabernacle and here's the other thing I realize it's not about me it's all what God is doing in our midst amen so I just do my part amen and and let God do the rest but I'm I'm so happy to be here and happy to just just share something amen with the church amen on this morning uh let's go back to uh our our scriptures this is our theme amen for the year I um have uh uh I like to put it this way I got a lot of hay on the fork and I'm not going to try to get it all out today I ain't going to do that uh but I I I I have um I'm I'm speaking the next couple weeks and um you know I'm just going to just take our time and just work through this this this uh this subject that God has given us uh you know and it to me it's a very you can look at it as a very quick subject that just and we out of here or you can just dig in and get all the Nuggets that's in there and polish them up just a little bit and uh I think God will help us to see something if you ain't seen it yet God help us to see something some of us might not even realize it but we are actually living personally in a restoration and Also spiritually in a restoration uh it's happening all around us we're surrounded by restoration right and um and and and I don't you know I know that that it it might not be obvious as of yet but I believe before the year out it going to be very [Music] obvious you know my my son-in-law walked into the house and uh just began to talk to us about reading the Bible and he told me say me uh xandy have committed to going through one year I mean reading the Bible together [Applause] Hallelujah you read God to speak and and and I just I just know that God is is doing things uh sometimes it's silent but it's still God and and some of the most powerful things happen in quietness did you hear the sunrise you didn't hear it rise but brother there's no light like sunlight amen right things happen in quietness very powerful things happen in quietness amen and sometimes you got to learn to keep quiet God can do some things in you if you just be still Joel chapter 1 verse four praise the name of the Lord that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the korm eaten and that which the cankerworm have left have the have the caterpillar eaten Joel two and uh I will just read just this one verse verse 25 I and I will restore to you the years that Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you Let's uh have a word of prayer father we thank you for the reading of the word as we come to this portion of the service where we come to hear what you have to speak to us God we ask that you would just anoint us to hear what the spirit is saying not what brother Jack is saying but what the spirit is saying and I pray father that you bring Clarity and understanding to every heart that we would realize the season which you have called us to this season of restoration it's something that impacts our health it's something that impacts our well-being it impacts our mind it impacts our spirit it impacts every area of our life and God all we got to do is walk in what you have given to us so I pray that you would just bless uh the Saints as they hear those present and online and we uh thank you for allowing brother and sister Capers to walk through the door today giving us strength and just touching her body God that she can come back into the house of God and Lord what a what a privilege and what a blessing it is to see him father and just pray that you just continue to touch them both oh God and strengthen them Father is our prayer it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated amen I also just want to make mention I know that uh uh you all keep brother quu in prayer uh he will be headed over to Porter Rico uh on this week and he'll be going there for some meetings the Lord has opened up a door for him to be there in Puerto Rico and uh just keep him in prayer that God would just uh bless him Amen in his journey uh there to Puerto Rico uh praise the lord it's always a blessing when we see ministers going forth from the church uh to the different parts of the world to take the gospel sir amen so we we want to uh arm them with with prayer and like I told you it's not easy when you when you get up and you take a trip uh my God the devil just seem to fight you in every little area um I mean the flight get cancelled or uh they lose your luggage or you know just all kind of stuff start happening and you just got to pray right through it all and uh stay focused on what you're there for amen so just keep our brother in prayers he'll be leaving uh this week going near to Puerto Rico praise the Lord uh well we will continue our journey and uh get back in Step this has been our opening uh theme for this year with a underlying uh inspiration of I will restore saith the Lord Brother Troy told us who said it the Lord said it amen it ain't Joel's words these are God's words and uh you know when we Rec recognize that this is God speaking us and this is not simply a scripture uh that was for that day even when uh the the the the power of God came down on the day of Pentecost they needed to identify the experience and uh because people had no idea they'd never seen anything like this and you know brother quu hit this last week and and I want I want to tell you the restoration includes all that everything Pentecost had come on somebody I said everything Pentecost had belongs to us the tongues belong to us the interpretation of tongues belong to us right the gift of deser belong to us can I can I say another thing uh you know because with the prophet teaching us how to operate in these gifts we realize that the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the Prophet come on somebody so that mean we don't get our tongues out of order that's the truth right we know exactly where we're standing according to the word right amen so we don't get these things out of order but everything that was imp pented cost everything we read in the Bible it belongs to us glory to God I'm not afraid of that that amen I I know that many have preached it out of the church but I'm here to try to preach it right back into the church Hallelujah if it was in the Bible it belongs to us I know it got out of order but when the prophet set it back in order it belongs to us hallelujah church amen I'm not afraid of the gifts the gifts keep the church in order amen but but this restoration is bringing all that back here's the other thing that we want with a gift we want a life Sir with a gift you can't come in here speaking in tongues and then out there fussing everybody out we don't want that amen church amen after you leave here you got to live a life before the people come on somebody amen amen cuz cuz what happens is that when when your gift is questioned it just kind of puts everything you know people can't trust it right but but if it's a gift you got to learn how to Not Just Surrender your gift to God you got have to surrender your life to God Amen there's some things you can't post with a gift right some things you can't say with a gift in your life hello somebody amen there some things you just can't do because when much is given much is required oh we coming out of a fast thank God for the fast come on church amen we're not playing games here we want the real thing brother I don't want just some type of anointing on my flesh I'm not here to impress anybody I want to see God move a real godall [Applause] yes that's right amen and when they come to church in Pentecost they come with um lying about they tithing we talking about everything in Pentecost they come in here lying about they tithing a husband and wife got together come up with a little scheme we going to tell them we made this God know how much you [Applause] made God told him write that check to you God actually gave you that check you don't know how to calculate 10% get your calculator out hello somebody but they come in there lying about how much money they made right now tell them we did this and both the husband and wife looked at how much that time check was going to be we can't oh we got to do this we got to do that we got to do this I the Lord understand the Lord understand that you a [Music] thief see I'm going tell you something some of us done got away with it too long thank you my brother because maybe um maybe this couple had gotten away with it before that they felt they could do it again and they come to church this time say I just tell them this and okay we're going to go in we going then then the Holy Ghost say uh what tempt you to lie to the Holy Ghost now where was the Holy Ghost it was in Peter he say what tempts you to lie to the Holy Ghost you ain't lie to me you lying to and and there's another thing people think they get a tithe to the pastor but ain't what the Bible said you actually giving it back to God trth he he say what tempt you to lie to the Holy Ghost not the Peter what temp you to do that what what Spirit done jumped on you he say say well he said you know I tell you what you you and then and didn't didn't even didn't even try to repent just you know this what we this this is what okay since you lied um these some there's some fellas sitting here some ushers they coming to get you and they I mean just drop dead in church and here's the thing when they drop dead in church nobody laid hands on them to pray for them to try to raise him back up again they went and buried him dug a grave and bu now can you imagine this and the wife the wife was nowhere around didn't have a chance to even go to her husband's funeral didn't even though he was dead then dead not just dead dead and buried there was no Facebook post you know when she found out that her husband was dead when she came to church and she come up with the same lie yeah uh we did it for this much same guys come take her I don't know if you know it but your husband gone we buried him a few hours ago now we're going to put you in the grave right next to him for lying in church about money amen amen praise the Lord so we getting all that now so now look if God don't want the church to be filthy I mean well well well God want the church to be clean even in the way we handle our money he also wants to be clean in the way we handle Our Lives amen you prach sir all right I'm going try to move on Amen but I I I'm looking for God to do some things and sometimes I got to say things to keep us clean in here all right amen all right help us Lord we got we go you know the the the the the church got to remain clean in this season and and brother brother um McBride told us we're connected and I need you to understand something everyone in here cuz I know y'all probably some of y'all probably fasted social media some of y'all should have fasted social media you can control what you post Instagram sometimes has a spirit on it that causes you to [Music] instigate and your post instigate stuff stir up stuff you trying to send a message we got it sometimes we don't want to get it hello sometimes our post shame my testimony amen church I'm preaching the guest the guest preacher hallu I post shame my testimony and since we we are connected your post [Music] represent it represent me it represent the whole church your post represent all us exactly right Hallelujah so maybe we need to keep the fast going on social media all right come on somebody Instagram sometimes call you to inst [Music] all right all right I'm coming back all right y'all should enjoyed all them uh uh what you call them evangelist and everything y'all should y'all should have ate that up glory to God I'm coming home I'm coming home now look I I got I got a lot of hay out here now so so y'all just bear with me I'm I'm I'mma get there okay so this scripture that I share with you in joel4 that which the palmerworm hath left hath the Locust eaten that which the Locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left ha the caterpillar eaten and thank God for the brothers that came and just went one took the the the the the Palmer worm next took the Locust next took the cankerworm and next took the caterpillar and then we had to bring it back home with the hour restore and uh you know brother quu and brother Mark uh brother Quinton uh brother Jerry brother Troy just did did an excellent job Hall and and most of it they were just taking they took 15 minutes just to kind of drop a little bit off and we we want to there's so much more to unpack but they were just trying to get it all in 15 minutes and I I do say I appreciate the brothers doing exactly what was asked of them uh because that let you know they can be trusted in the Pulpit amen amen I remember one time going to a church and they said uh we're going to give you seven minutes to speak on this subject seven minutes now I could have said I ain't I can't even get a scripture out in s minutes I could have handled that way or I could have just said okay I'll get it out in seven minutes so I chose the okay I get out in I went up there and D D D D D D I was done in seven minutes sat down so everybody else come up there one person just my it looked like they did about 25 minutes another one did about 15 minutes and everybody just going and they just had to try to prove how much they knew right and uh so after it was all done I'm sitting there and the pastor come up and say um you know I just want to say I appreciate this man right here he did exactly what we asked him to do so you know sometimes you got to learn and and and and I and not only learn but but you can get a lot in Amen in just 15 minutes and those brothers did that last week I'm telling you I I went back looking at like boy this church you know but I was just so blessed by it but I I'm I'm going to kind of keep going we going to keep packing some of these things because all you got were the highlights so now let's just kind of keep working with this a little bit all right we end this uh hour restore say the Lord joel4 the uh looking at my Bible uh commentary out of the message I'm sorry it's called illuminous software they said the theme of the first chapter of the prophecy in the Book of Joel the destruction caused by the Locust plague is introduced in this in these verse in this verse palmerworm Locust cankerworm caterpillar and they said the mean meaning of the four Hebrew words translated here is uncertain now a theologian and let me let me help you understand the reason people pick up um a theologian is that they they're trying to read the Bible it's not written in in our modern language today and people have a problem with it not being written our modern language so now they try to find Bibles that have our modern language but then they take all the meaning away let me help you understand something you don't need a new Bible amen you need the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that wrote the word is able to teach you the word so don't change your KJV Bible to try to break it down don't do that amen amen right just let the same holy ghost that wrote it bring it back to you right so so so so so here they saying it's uncertain like in anytime you looking at scripture and if a God if somebody tell it's uncertain how can you put your weight on that there you can't put Faith in something that's uncertain you got to have a solid foundation so you know there's a couple things that um that uh I want to say here because that's that's Illumina that said that but this this I will restore sayth the Lord it has different meanings to different people uh I believe it's it it it could it could speak to your health it could speak to your family right that's right your spouse or children it can speak to your business that's it could speak to your income it could speak to a prios you have maybe you got a demotion and you w supposed to get that demotion but I will restore will bring your promotion back yes will brother right amen it speaks to healing in the Inner Man restoration is healing on the inside and then it's manifested on the outside Jeremiah 317 says for I'll restore Health unto thee Genesis 4 uh 40 and13 the butler was restored to his position amen Second Kings uh chapter 8 uh verse 4-6 this lady got her house back her land back everything she own before the famine she got it back oh Hallelujah maybe you've been going through a spiritual famine amen but God has been watching your faithfulness during the famine amen and God has promised to rest everything back hey job got it all back why can't you get it all back hey I want it all back come on somebody I want it all back I'm tired of the devil having it I want it all back restoration is promised to bring it all back to you right also the this this spiritual condition we found it in Amen in Psalm 51: 10-12 create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me in verse 12 says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation see see that spiritual condition has to be restored you didn't lose your salvation you just lost your joy but God God is going to give you your joy back restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit this this restoration means different things to different people based on where you are in your life also uh I have another little uh book that I that I that I that I that I got at the beginning of my Ministry amen I'll never forget uh got this from uh mother Dolly uh sister Michelle used to help her and and her husband was a a minister and you know he passed away and he had this little book in his house called key to the Bible and uh and and in that house they gave me this little key to the Bible and uh so a lot of times I'll take a word and I'll look it up in there and and this word restore had multiple definitions and one of them was to deliver back again oh my restore means to deliver back again and the scripture that they Ed to support that was Genesis 20 and7 now what you need to understand about Genesis 20 and7 that was the inspiration that brother brandham used when he preach the restoration of the briad tree his inspiration was Genesis 20 and 7 now now before I read it before I read Genesis 27 this is why I say restoration is bringing your family back Hallelujah because in Genesis 20 and7 amen before we got to verse 7 Abraham had lied to ailec and told him that Sarah was his sister come on somebody amen this man is lying and because he's afraid he's going to lose his life he say this woman is my sister and she's also lying can I can I tell you something this man was a prophet lying right and uh so so so when they uh uh AMC say well man he say that's his sister I've been looking for a wife God had already changed Sarah's body this is why the man at she he looking at a 90y old woman but he wants to take her for wife God had already turned her body back to being young right hallelujah amen and when he sees and say I've been looking for a wife I want this lady Sarah to be my wife Abraham willfully gives her up oh Jesus what a prophet but here you know uh while while while Abraham oh my is probably up at night wondering what have I just done and I don't know maybe Abraham repented Lord I'm so sorry and there's nothing I can do to get her back but God was watching over a promise that he had given Abraham he told Abraham Sarah thy wife will have a son and that promise that God made could not be broken so he could not allow aimc to touch Abraham's wife amen because it would have impacted the promise and if God has given you some promises there are some things that cannot happen to you God will block it God will stop it until his promise comes to pass in your [Music] life God made you a promise hallelujah hallelujah hey maybe somebody trying to steal a contract from you maybe trying to undercut you but if God made you a promise there is nothing they can do I don't care how low they dropped the [Music] [Applause] price your customer is your customer my God so God God God God knew Abraham was helpless and this is why brother Brandon used the term regardless of the condition yes sir this restoration happens regardless of the condition I'm not looking at where you at I'm looking at where you going to be on the other side of is restoration regardless of the condition I'm trying to get somewhere today restoration happens so you know brother brand uh so brother brandom uses this scripture because here bimc has Sarah and he's like he's in even in nighttime prayer thanking God for giving him a new wife that he can have a baby and then God come to him and dream don't you touch that man's wife wife now wait wait even in this dream there's a conversation happening this man is talking with God God responding back to him in a dream don't you touch that man wife the man told me and she told me in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established they told me they was brothers and sisters mhm mm but don't touch that man's wife yeah if you do touch her I'mma kill you and everything around you going to die Lord I'm a righteous man why why you give that man back his wife and not only that he's my prophet and I want him to pray for you Genesis 27 now we can see it this is what God told him now therefore restore that's it oh come on somebody see I I I these are things I take personally yeah restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee amen and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine restoration includes our families restoration includes your health that's right restoration includes the gift in the church restoration includes your peace of mind oh restoration includes so much yes it does hallelujah another uh definition that they had gave here in uh key to the Bible said to make a return as for a theft discovered so like in Exodus 22 I won't read it there was laws for a thief if they stole something they had to give it back and sometime they had to give it back double come on somebody if the devil stole something from you make him give it back they they they said uh another that to reestablish as an office restore mean to reestablish as an office and they Ed Genesis 4013 where the Butler got reestablished to his office and here's another one that I want to read real quickly they said restore means to reclaim an airing Christian I want to camp there just for a little bit to reclaim to restore means to reclaim an airing Christian now here's the thing I need us to understand it understand here is that restoration is actually in you oh Lord you have the ability on to restore a a a a a a airing Christian we're going to read it in scripture in a second but but but you know before I go there the the song comes back to me that my mother wrote years ago save me from my airing way restore me to the now now now she didn't say restore me to a face I'm talking about years ago before we had all these issues she said restore me to the faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints restore me to the faith I Pray song has gone all over been sung by many people it's just been a blessing and uh and I remember the last time I heard it song I was in Tucson Arizona me and brother Smiley were there preaching and um our wives went with us and we went to service one night at brother Israel's Church brother Israel in Tucson Arizona okay it's got to be a connection here but we're there and they asked my sister to come up and sing a a special and the song she chose now how many songs out there to sing but the song she chose to sing is save me from my airing way restore me to the faith I prayes J and and and the melody is just so sweet in that song that it make piano players want to go and play it and I'm not a piano player but I can play that one it's something about it but the word mean more amen than everything else when you really listen to it save me from my AR restore me to the faith I pray thank you Lord Galatians 6 And1 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault now let me just break it down everybody on can go and try to do nothing with this but the Bible say ye which are you can't be colel trying to handle things like this ye which are spiritual you have a responsibility restore such an one in the spirit of meekness so that you can't go out uh like like like you you know it all right you can't you uh uh you you can't go out with a uh a arrogant Spirit brother random say you got to keep an arrogant spirit away from you right he say say restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself which means I could be in the same position they in when a man is down you don't kick him you try to help him get up when a woman is down you don't kick her you try to help her get up amen considering thyself lest thou also be tempted right so here we have the power to restore if we handle things the right way right oh come on somebody I want to just read a quote out of why we are not a denomination brother random makes this statement he says now we can tell you why we take communion tell you why we take feet washing why we won't let the members take it if we know they're in sin if we know you're in sin we know you're in sin no you can't come and take communion and be a part of it we know you are in sin you can't do that right it says um uh uh and that's why this last two or three weeks I've been going from one member to the other where you've been having your little fusses around too going around one wouldn't speak to the other pass one another on the road now you saw that sister in the store you in the same store almost in the same line and you going to bypass her not want to greet her hello somebody and I'mma hide from her that's your [Music] sister you got more in common with her than anybody else in the store yes sir and that's your very sister y'all praise God together go to the same church and then you out dodging each other each other in Walmart you you you you you mean you ain't got enough Holy Ghost to say God bless you but come in here with your hands lifted and your mouth wide open and want to speak in tongues I tell you we're looking for a life a real life I told y'all look I'mma there's there's things here I can I can just just skip right over I'm going to Camp set up me a tent on some of this going around one wouldn't speak to the other pass one another on the road and turn your head shame on you who's took the Blessed cup of God across this the altar here and and call you brothers and sisters and then get on the telephone and Gad off about one another now now remember uh that that that first animal there the first stage of him as the um uh the Palmer worm one of the things he did was start gossip when brother R say g off about that's that's gossiping and and and listen here the Bible actually tells us you know you want to watch them that so a seed of Discord one that's trying to just break up the church amen if you got a spirit on you where you want to see the church broke up something wrong with you yes sir amen you looking for opportunity to just tear the church up get that Spirit off of you we trying to keep it together and you trying to tear it apart only the devil do things like that amen glory he says get on the uh get on get on the telephone and Gad off about one another you're not thit to be called a Christian when you're that way right you keep off them telephones hello it now now that now that that was just what we did back there I mean brother brandom just talk about technology back then telephone can be used for good and bad right but but but but what would he say today I'm glad the church catching it now you here why I say stay on social media if you going to post stuff like that don't post at all exactly right sometime I see things out there posted I can't like it at all this thing grieve my spirit righta I can't like that and I got oh Lord no no church that ain't even Christian no it ain't Christian and we got to lower our standards to achieve certain things we not doing the right thing look I'm going to take something even you know be like Chick-fil-A y'all Chick-fil-A got a standard well that's because the the the owner died and when you get new leadership that's when things start falling apart but the man uh TR Kathy whatever Kathy whatever yeah that man had a standard he kept it high no matter what they did and and and I and I'm going tell you if he was still around some of the stuff they got would not be happening right now I think now they talk about opening one of them for on on on on Sunday they was blessed by not being open on Sunday I I remember McDonald's Had lines all around everybody going to get a dollar Big Mac or whatever it was a quarter pound everybody was lined up at McDonald's and all of a sudden a shift happened yes sir Chick-fil-A come up with a new idea two drive-throughs now not everybody having to follow that and ain't nobody in the line at McDonald's and Burger King nobody but they honored God they did honor God God honored them that's a very successful business model yes yes sir it is and now we can in our business is keep the same model but keep God in it sir brother brother Paul come and talk about that a few weeks ago he say he couldn't understand how a brother that actually own the business he owns the business but he creates time to work on Sunday you own the business you can actually say no to that you can yeah M it's up to you now if you get a ox in the ditch go get them out don't put them [Music] in don't put the ox in the ditch by taking a certain job no sometime you got no I'm going have to back off that one we talk about restoration still right yes sir God want to restore our worship hallelujah amen oh Lord I'm I'm I'm running out of time you're not fit to be called a Christian when you're that way right you keep off them telephones all right and I'm going just add you keep off that social media keep out of them WhatsApp groups anywhere they stirring up mess get get away from it amen am you know you can remove yourself from a WhatsApp group they put me in I put myself out you don't have to be a part of it you just actually do remove yourself that way you keep your spirit clean sir people people do that to me all the time I put them in a group they be gone [Music] why why they leaving I just want to share scripture with them you keep off them telephones if you can't talk good about somebody don't you talk at all see we talk about restoring somebody in the spirit of meekness how you going to restore somebody if you talking about them you don't went and just shared all stuff with it and how you going to restore you can't go to them no sir they won't receive you I wouldn't receive you so so so the spirit of meekness you got to get that's why the Bible say let them that's spiritual because a lot of times we lot of things we do are carnal it's not spiritual all right he says you keep off them telephones if you can't talk good about somebody don't you talk at all remember God's going to hold you responsible yes sir God's going to hold you responsible as long as that kind of spirit's in you you know you're not right with God that's right amen church and uh another thing I'm going just mention to youall as I was looking at sister uh Caper's coming this morning she got out the car she was straight to the house of God she couldn't wait to get in here hallu right and I and I know that uh I got different Saints going through different things and they body and I I do understand that I'm not trying to uh say anything to you I I appreciate you all pressing I got mothers that are pressing their way out to the house of the Lord but I will say this you all be careful about a slothful spirit be careful don't allow a slothful spirit to get a hold of you because a SLO slothful spirit will not even make the Rapture to fight that now all right let me go on if a man man's in the Rong if a man's in the wrong go to him to be reconciled if you can't be reconciled take somebody with you he said no wonder God can't discipline his church cuz you're not doing it right instead of getting on the phone and talking about this one what taking place and little Cults and so forth around like that instead of doing that why don't you do what the Bible say if some brother some brother's been overtaken in a fault go to him all right and see if you can't get reconciled with him well now he did me see he start you know he did me this way I don't care what he did go to him anyhow it didn't say for him to come to you the Bible didn't say for him to come to you you go to him that's not what the Bible said the Bible said for you to go to him if he's wrong you go to him and then if he won't listen to you then take somebody with you as a witness and then if he won't see that witness then say now I'll take your pastor then you'll tell them say I'm going to tell it to the church and in 30 days from now if you if your brethren haven't made that up this brother here was willing to be reconciled you won't do it and if you won't make that up within 30 days then what's going to happen you're no more one of us now you talk about keeping the church clean sir you talk about keeping the church clean Petty differences that can hinder the Revival Petty differences that are hinder Restoration in a church Petty things we ain't strong enough I mean in our Christian walk we ain't strong enough to overcome some of this little stuff that we allow the devil to do they said this they did that they said and everybody no that's the devil making you feel like that and and when you get one of them Spirits soon as you see them in the store I'm dodging them don't take the phone calls don't respond to their text messages hello somebody they see you read the message God help us to keep this thing clean I'm going on they used another example here that I need to just kind of bring in out this definition out the key to the Bible one more says to recover the purity of divine worship by a reformation and I want to put I put restoration to to recover the purity of divine worship by a Reformation now when I looked in the key to the Bible the scripture that they use to support this definition was Matthew 17 ver 10 AM they might be using scriptures and not really understand what it means I want to just drop something off here this morning this is um Mount Transfiguration the disciples have gone up and they've watched Jesus get transformed and they see Moses and Elijah come to Jesus and you know uh having a conversation with him and uh when the disciples see this uh they begin to you know ask certain questions and um they were like hey you know why is all this happening didn't didn't didn't this wasn't this supposed to happen before that happened and look at this they knew scripture his disciples asked him saying what why then say the scribes that Elias must first come now what they're saying here is that this is a a restoration or let me just put it this way a um a recover of the purity of divine worship recovering the purity of divine worship now they're reading there they they refer to the scripture in Matthew 17 Jesus answers in the next verse they ask about it but Jesus answer said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now according to them according to key of the Bible key in the Bible they're saying this is to recover the purity of divine worship amen Eliah Elias or the spirit of Elijah is coming to restore the purity of divine worship can I go a little further amen the spirit is coming to place Us in spirit and in truth amen amen cause our worship to be in spirit and in truth it restores the purity of divine worship now a little further amen the next verse says but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whato they listed likewise also the son of man uh son of man suffered them now he goes on one more verse then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist now I I like to just kind of again Camp here just for a little bit because um Jesus spoke of two different comings of Elijah in that one verse in this one one one one one one one section the first Was Elijah coming to restore all things and then he says I say unto you Elias has already come that was the ministry of John the Baptist when it said already come but the ministry of brother Brandon was when the the El that was going to come and restore all things oh help us Lord amen now let me let me I'm telling you what Jesus said now telling what Jesus said this message was something Jesus spoke about yes sir now let me go a little further let me go a little further I'm I'm I'm I'm coming oh my my my my my if somebody tells you that John the Baptist was the one fulfilling the restore all things the Holy Spirit told me to tell you ask them one question oh Lord I feel like running ask them one question and now before you know you already know the question to ask the ask that the question is what did he restore now the reason I'm telling you to ask them one question my God my God my God is because in order to defeat a devil you don't need a whole bunch of words you simply need one question rather than you tra chasing and trying to find answers for every question they got make them chase and answer your question I got one question with this scripture go pull that scripture back up uh Matthew 17 And1 I want to make sure the church got this 11 if they say John the Baptist this is the one fulfilling this part you must ask them what did he restore right now now now before we leave here today my answer is brother Brandon was the one that came to restore all things and you're going to ask me the question what's the question you're going to ask me I'm glad you ask the question amen yes sir yes sir yes sir yes sir but before I give you an answer I want to give you a strategy because Jesus used the same strategy hello when they came against him in his day can we just read a scripture Matthew 21 verse 23 Lord Jesus help us Matthew 21:23 this this this this one question strategy yes sir here it says and when he was coming to the temple the chief priest and the Elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what Authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this Authority now the reason they asking this to Jesus cuz you know wait a minute even at the age of 12 this man is stand Jesus is in the temple teaching the leaders of that day what the scripture is saying now they want to know what school did this man go to I mean he's not a part of the denomination of the Pharisees or denomination of the Sadducees he's not a part of any of these sex any of these groups where did this man get this authority to teach scripture they want to know go on verse 24 and Jesus answered and said unto them I also will ask you how many how many things how many how what's this this strategy that Jesus I'm only going to ask you one question I also will ask you one thing which if you tell me if you give me an answer I and likewise will tell you by what Authority I do these things Jesus say I got the answer that you're looking for but I need you to give me an answer first yes sir next the baptism of John whence was it from heaven or of men and they reason within themselves saying if we shall say from Heaven he was saying to us why did ye not then believe him right go on to the next one but if we should say of Men We Fear the people for all hold John as a prophet next verse next verse and they answered Jesus said we cannot tell well since you have no answer then also I have no answer and he sent him neither tell I you by what Authority I do these things go back to verse 25 for me please I need you to understand something they asked Jesus by what Authority you do these things see I got a question for you the baptism of John whence was it from heaven or or from Men In other words Jesus was forcing them to identify who the messenger was and today if there's a question on who's doing the restoration we need you to identify who the messenger is cuz Jesus said Elias was coming to restore all things right and if we can't if we can't agree on John the Baptist amen cuz I'm going tell you right now I know John the Baptist didn't restore nothing right his baptism didn't even last his baptism didn't last they changed it in Acts 19 they asked him how you that baptized unto John's baptism that ain't good enough Christ has already come and gone you got need to be you need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins so his baptism was not restored right so you ask me the question well you brother Jack is if it's not John the Baptist who you say it is I'm telling you it's William Mar and brandom is the Fulfillment of the scripture and Jesus said uh Elias that was coming to restore all things I say brother Brandon was the Fulfillment of scripture so now if if I'm going to say that if I'm if I'm going to say brother Brandon was a fulfill you should have a question for me what's your what's the question y'all ain't got no question I'm a I'm I need the whole church to give me this question on account three I want to hear the question one 2 3 I'm so glad you asked me the question I want to read the answer to the question out of the message it's in the the sermon serves is this the time but before I can read it I need to go to another scripture I want you to go with me to Matthew 13 this is just I was trying to just not read as much of this ver of this chapter but it's hard for me not to I'mma I I tell you this is my promise to you I'mma read this and then I'mma read you the things that brother Brandon restored and then I'm I'mma leave you alone today okay Matthew 13 now the reason I'm reading this is because some of you all may not have this but there is a uh what do we call the Scofield bible it's the King James version but Dr Scofield kind of wrote notes uh all through that Bible and just different things that he was looking at he looked at this Matthew 13 and uh and then he listed a whole bunch of mysteries that he saw that needed to be addressed by somebody Dr scoffield was what they call a dispensationalist which means he believed in seven different dispensations that God would deal with man also Scofield used the term ages because there's different people that say say ain't no seven Church ages there's ones out there ain't no seven Church ages but scoffield was using that term and always saying is that there was different time periods that God did certain things and he used a different man at that time in order to keep the people on the word that's all the age was and we can see seven churches represented seven Church ages in the Book of Revelation very simple very simple look at this now let's read this let's read I can I'm going to give you Scofield's notes in a little bit because brother Brandon referred to him but let's read the the the scripture first look at this verse one the same day went Jesus out of the house and sat by the seaside and great multitudes were gathered together to him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and spake many things unto them in Parable saying right Behold a s went forth to seow and when he slded some seeds fell by the wayside and the fouls came and devouted them up now this scripture that we're looking at is a scripture that is constantly being repeated even today this scripture is being repeated a SE comes forth the SE seeds here I am sewing seed what is a seed the word of God I'm sowing seed right here in the congregation but when when when when when we leave church the enemy going to attack the seeds that have been sown and all y'all represent this different ground that we getting ready to read look at look at it now some fell by the some seed and when when he s some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devouted them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had had no root they with it away I I like to call these mushroom Christians mushrooms just come up over night and be kicked over the next day but oak tree Christians you ain't going to take them out too fast you got to get all your tools out glory to God right and uh verse verse verse verse uh verse six and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away verse 7even and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruits some 100-fold some 60-fold some 3F who have ears to hear Let Them hear and that's all Jesus said he preached the sermon people sitting on the shore listening to that and it's a parable that he's giv them now look at what happens in the next verse and the disciples came said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables what what I'm gathering from this is the service was over Jesus already spoke this Parable but he never gave any explanation right uh let me just stop and pause there the explanation only came privately the explanation came priv it wasn't a public explanation there I remember a brother asked me one time he said he say this message is so good I really enjoy it all you know the things I'm hearing why is this not on TBN TBN don't want this you evidently you ain't heard what we've been preaching TBN don't want this have you looked at TBN they don't want this nobody want the truth like that nobody if it's going to cause you to change your lifestyle uhuh they don't want that no I got to live holy yes you got to live holy sir amen right but look at this he said the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given yeah it's not given to them it is given unto ohoo Jesus Hallelujah I just I mean he can he he can just put my name in you I feel like he talking directly to me it is given unto Jack Duff to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven yes sir but unto them thank you Lord now I can't get mad at them for not seeing what I see it's just not given I'm sorry you can't see what I see but because of what I see I can't change amen thank let me go a little further please I I I I just I love the word of God verse 12 says for whosoever hath to him shall be given he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath Lord therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand which means they just don't have a revelation M and in them and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah Isaiah's Isaiah which says by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive so Jesus did this intentionally gave them Parables that they would not understand in order to fulfill scripture sir yes sir let me go on for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes you know you want to know why your eyes are blessed you want to know why your eyes are blessed because they see all right Hallelujah now now that that can be taken naturally but the greater part is spiritually sir you're blessed because you can see and you and you going to come in here and not praise God can you see you got something to praise him for can you hear you got something to praise him for and I'm talking about seeing spiritually and hearing spiritually amen blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets I don't know if we get it there are things that prophets wanted to understand in scripture a prophet couldn't even get it but God is giv it to you and then put you on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets look at this for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them hear ye therefore the parable of the sword now this is what Jesus does privately after the church was over the congregation had been dismissed all they heard was Parables they walked away trying to figure out what the Parables were even the disciples trying to understand what is The Parables and they approached them why are you speaking to them in Parables it's because I'm fulfilling the word but since you here fellas I got something to tell you privately I want to share some things with you and do you realize even in this group of 12 or even if it was 70 I don't know how many was at that time but if it was 12 or even if it was the other 70 that that he he ordained if all of together even in that group seeds was still being sown on different grounds Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory watch this now cuz see you need to you need to figure out what ground are you which ground are you now watch this here it is verse verse 19 when anyone Hearth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside so they hear it but they don't understand now if you hear and you don't understand pray and ask God for understanding when I first came to this message I didn't understand all this I couldn't stand here and preach to y'all when I first came to I a know way would I had no understanding but as I just stayed with her even things that I couldn't necessarily agree with right brother yeah why would the prophet say that Martin Luther King is leading his people to a Slaughter you know that rub the rub the wrong way when when I first heard that quote I said why would he say something like that that's right I was looking at it from a natural perspective but when I caught the spiritual aspect of what was being said the prophet was dead right he say he leading him to a Slaughter it was a spiritual Slaughter even when we was in our denomination churches black people went to church amen they went to church on Sunday and there were certain sins that you would never find black people doing you you would never see that among black people I mean but but brother Brandon say look he's leading them to a Slaughter he don't realize what he's doing but he's leading him to a Slaughter and now now now we got more problems in this culture come on Church the prophet was dead dead right he saw spiritual things now I'm going tell you God didn't show me the spiritual aspect of it I had to hold to this message when I couldn't understand why he said what he said I like years went by Lord I'm trying to I don't get this one Lord and and and and and here's the other thing I'm going to tell you when he said that he was not a racist he saw spiritual things and he was spot on with it can I keep reading verse 19 when anyone Hearth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked when and catcheth away that which was swn in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside he's revealing what this what this Parable is look at verse 20 but he that receiveth the seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and Anon with joy receive it I mean they just jumping all up and down in church thanking God for the oh and y'all done seen people like this come to church and preach yelling all kind of things got the church all stirred up but after service yet hath he not root in himself but doth for a while he endureth for a while right for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended when he's offended he's gone y'all y'all y'all done seen it I ain't got to explain this this is this is this is this is ABC we not seen it happen too many times here it is verse 22 he also that receive seed among the Thorns is he that Hearth the word look at this and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches y'all realize what that is the devil always got some little thing he dangling in front of you sir another big opportunity and another big opportunity if you just do this if you compromise here and you compromis there I got another big opportunity no no no no no compromises I don't I'm not I'm not deceived by trying to chase the riches all I need God to do all I need God to do is to supply my needs and he promised that I will supply all your needs according to my riches and Glory what I learned about that is that it's not even based on my work that's right I am going to go to work sir but it's not limited to my work I told y'all the other week I just filled out some paperwork they sent something and say say you um uh you can to be a part of this class action suit or can I and I ain't even got to go to court I'mma just fill out this paper and send it on to them I send it out they sent me a check God got other ways to meet your needs so don't limit God just to your work and just don't be deceived by the deceitfulness of riches amen I know you trying to be a millionaire and you would have already made it by now but it's possible you don't need to be a millionaire and I and I'm kind of convinced there's a a probably a lot of millionaires that actually wasn't doing things to try to become a millionaire it just happened there's others that was just born into the money amen right but sometimes you know and I learned this I learned this if we had everything we needed then we wouldn't be praying asking God for for help so sometimes we need to struggle a little bit it keeps us on our knees amen am and you just go from one season to the next season but you on your knees in every season God I got another need and he like talking to you I'm tell if you didn't have needs you wouldn't be talking to God it's not part of your daily routine just to sit down and talk to God you you just a Lord I Thank you for this and Lord I thank you no no no no there ain't no real conversation you got to go through some struggles he also that receive seed among the Thorns is he that Hearth the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful which which ground are you here's the last verse but he that receive seed into the good ground is he that Hearth the word and understandeth it see see so you you heard the word I just gave you a scripture um on um in in in Matthew where Jesus said Eli's going to come and restore all things it's not just you heard it do you understand it can be John the Baptist fulfilling that yes he did come the Elias that that came already was John the Baptist but the one that's restoring all things no no no no that's not John the Baptist I understand that's not John the Baptist that is a future Ministry that Jesus is speaking of now he didn't I want you to notice something else Jesus did not tell the disciples that the that the the the the uh the the Elias that had come already he didn't say that was John the Baptist the Bible say they understood right that mean they caught a revelation of who it was and when you come to church you receive seed and good ground you hear the word then you understand you catch a revelation what this is here the word and understand that which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold some 60 some 30 brother Jack you keep saying brother Brandon was the Fulfillment of what Jesus said that Elijah would restore all things well brother Jack I got a question for you thank you for asking is this the sign of the end sir let me just read this for you and we'll answer the question and then you'll have a sermon that even you can give to somebody if you can't even remember what did he restore my pastor preached that my pastor told us what He restored go back and listen to get back in Step part three actually don't tell them don't even tell them which part it's on just listen to the whole series get back and step sir is this the sign of the answer look at this look at this go uh to 241 for me please there you go thank you right there the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 is a seventh Church age messenger see now watch and in the days now watch here but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished that's another one I don't even have time to really dig into that but that's another one that's created a problem the sth Angel Revelation 10 is also the seventh angel Revelation 3 14 all right very important that we catch that because people people get it mixed up on the seventh angel uh here it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now sounding forth the messenger the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message to the lean Church notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first Angel wasn't given that second Angel 3D fourth 5ifth 6th but it's the it is the seventh angel that had this type of message what was it notice this type of message finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose in it all out through these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the rich WR book now let me um let me just say this in denomination they do have part truth they're not 100% wrong they have part truth that's why you don't just put everybody down but but here's the thing when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away with so that's why we come out of denominations to this message because we realize that which is perfect is here Glory Glory Glory look at it let's keep going that's telling me that my time is up I'm almost theread I told y'all what I was going to do I'm I'm promise you I'm GNA do that so look look at this notice this type of message this type of finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book The Seventh Angels winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose in it all out through these organizations denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire Ministry uh mystery that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the written book watch it now let's note a few of these Mysteries and if you want to write them down first I'll take what skolfield says here in Matthew 13 so when when scoffield was looking at Matthew 13 in his own studies my God he was was looking at uh uh I believe it was verse 13 no no no at verse 11 says he said unto them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom scoffield was looking at he started identifying Mysteries that he could see in the scripture somebody has to come along and reveal the truth to all these Mysteries scoffield saw it look at it let's go on it says first I'll take I'll take take take you what Scofield said here in Matthew 13 if you like to type some of them down if you haven't got a scofi Bible you might read what he thinks some of the Mysteries are now in the 11th verse he answered and said him because it's given unto you his disciples because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it is not given now look the Mysteries here is the mystery and Scofield writes this note a mystery is scripture is previously hidden truth now now this is not brother branham's definition this is Scofield's definition but it's very fitting to brother branham's Ministry previously hidden truth now divinely revealed and not only that and Scofield say but which is a supernatural element still remain despite the Revelation now I just like to say this when we look at just even the church ages when brother Brandon preached the church ages and he he wrote up on on on a little board in the front of the church he just teaching Church ages at the end of his sermon the angel of the Lord came into the church and on the back wall of the church rote the seven churches out that is a supernatural element that remain despite the Revelation you going to tell me the church AG is not right and God wrote it on the wall himself you going to say this belong to Lin well yeah Lin had a little lay out just like this but did the angel come and write on the wall what Lin talk now we can we can put our weight on things that's that's supernaturally given to us amen Church look at this I'm going on I'm going on a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation the greater Mysteries and the great Mysteries are this is scof Field's notes now look at it I I'm I'm I'm quoting brother Brandon but he's quoting scoffield I got a scoffield Bible right here I can show you my Bible everything he's saying is right here in scoffield notes everything what he's saying right here but scoffield saw there some Mysteries you ask me what did he restore these are the things that were restored the truth behind all these things and more were restored watch what SC feel sake says number one The Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven that's the one we're talking now uh uh Matthew 13: 3-50 says now the second mystery is the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age Romans 11:25 with context with the context third mystery is the mystery of the translation of the living Saints at the end time of this age 1 Corinthians 15 also uh Thessalonians 4:14 through1 17 brother brandom even told us that the mystery of the shout voice and Trump the shout was this message going forth The Voice Gathering the bride together and that lets us know that we are in the Rapture now yes sir we not waiting for something the only the only thing going to happen now is just a change of the body but we're in the Rapture now just by be just by being gathered to this word we're in it right now they still looking for the mystery we live in the mystery amen I'm going further it says um number uh four the fourth mystery of the New Testament Church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles Ephesians 31-11 Romans 16:25 and also Ephesians 6:19 Colossians 4:3 the fifth mystery is the is of the church as the bride of Christ Ephesians uh 5:28 to 32 six Mysteries of the living Christ same yesterday today and forever was that brother brandom stee Galatians 2:20 and Hebrews 1338 many places like that the seventh mysteries of God even uh Christ as the Incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom all Divine wisdom and I like to say Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new that was given to us by the prophet brother random say and godliness restored to man say the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in second Thessalonians now now now Scofield's looking at the brother brandom and the seals picks up that and tells us how the Antichrist Spirit got started my God my God my God just like just like the uh we we saw it was the same insect it was the same rider that's what brother tro was trying to tell us same Rider just changing his horse changing colors went from white to Red to Black to and when we got Pale Horse nobody knew what that was but a prophet said it's all three horses mixed together yes sir white red and black made the Pale Horse till he rode it all the way out to death oh my god oh we got our eye on this thing look at this he goes on and say it's um uh the 10th mystery is the 10th mystery is of the Seven Stars of Revelation 120 in the church a book we got the revelation of that come on we just we just been through that the Seven Stars of the seven churches the seven MERS and so forth and the 11th mystery is the mystery of Babylon The Prostitute Revelation 175 to7 these are scull field notes watch what brother random say that's some that's some of the Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to wind up uh wind up all uh the mystery all the Mysteries God and the other may I say this with reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God another mystery the serpent seed you ask me what did he restore I got an answer for you who taught us the serpent seed and what really happened in the Garden of Eden did John the Baptist teach us that or did brother brandham teach us that and if you say John the Baptist then show me in the scripture where he taught it the certainty that's been a hidden Mystery All Through The Years this Grace straightened out but uh straighten out not disgrace but real true Grace here's another one no such thing as an eternal burning hell you want to know what He restored He restored the truth to that right you will burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal had never beginning or end and hell was created all these Mysteries here's another one the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation because Pentecost told we have to speak in tongues in order to have the Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues and cursed their neighbors out and I I out of the same mouth they blessed and cursed we don't want that type of Holy Ghost the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did the mystery of water baptism who restored that truth of water baptism did John do it Sir John's baptism didn't even last past Acts 19 the mystery baptism where the extreme trinitarian trinitarianism has brought into this titles of father son Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ according to the book of the revelations that Jesus uh that that the church in this time was to receive he goes on there there are some of the Mysteries the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the Mysteries that's just some of them we gave you godhead was restored we understand what God had marriage and divorce restored the two schools of thoughts so marriage and divorce brother Brandon brought the truth back to that who is this MDC these are things that were restored through his ministry there's so many things restored we got the word restored Hallelujah now when the word is restored that's when the dynamic power is also restored I ain't got time to read all that I told you where I was going to cut off that's it I'm stopping right there if y'all just allow me to add just one little thing brother musicians y'all come I'mma just say this real quick and I'm I'm G get out of here remember I told y'all if somebody come to you and tell you John the Baptist is the one that restored All Things based on what Jesus said that Elias was come going to come and restore if somebody come I say ask them a question what did he restore and I gave you an example of brother brandham I'm sorry where Jesus just gave one question to the religious leaders of his day all you got to do is give one question today now I'm going tell you in brother Brandon's Ministry there was one question that was given in his time there was a great challenge put on by this man his name was Dr best and he wanted to prove that Jesus was not the same yesterday forever and that healing was not taking place brother Ram say I I'm not going to stand before the people and I'm I'm not going to argue with this man but brother Bosworth say you don't have to do it but if you would give me permission to go and just stand before this man and just give him you know uh uh you know just just just talk said let me just ask him a question he says he he just can get up there and say these things and nobody challenge him he brother brother brand say whatever you do just don't argue with him brother B say I ain't going to argue now Dr best was about 35 years old doc brother brother Bosworth about 80 years old and um brother brodsworth told Brother brand said I'm not gonna argue I promise you I won't argue so Dr best get up and he lay out all his stuff and he just you know doing his thing said go get go get that that Divine healer bring him out here bring up brother Bosworth say now the Divine healer brother bram's not the Divine healer Christ is the Divine healer you know but brother just and and here's another thing he was very disrespectful the way that he was talking to brother brandom now I want to tell you a lot of people that's leaving the message they being very disrespectful and the way that they talk about brother brandom when you hear people say brandom said it and they can't use the word brother you talking to a spirit if you can't call him brother you got a spirit on you right and and the other thing what did he do to you I'm talking about to you you individually what did Brother brandom do to to you why you got why you got that type of spirit against them so Dr do uh uh brother bosor said I like to just I like to take and I promise you I won't argue with him brother Brandon after Dr best spread all this stuff out brother Bosworth walked up and said I just got one question for you brother one question see this all you need is one question one question one question what did he restore that's all that's the one qu you ain't got to answer everything else just give them one question send them on a search and you come back with your Bible and tell me what did he restore if you say John the Baptist is the one that fulfilled that scripture Dr best I mean brother brother brother bosor say I got one question for you Dr best does the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah which is Old Testament does that apply to Jesus Dr best couldn't answer the one question because brother brandom said that if he was Jehovah Gyra your provider in the Old Testament then he's got to be Jesus the provider in the New Testament if he was Jehovah Rafa the Healer in the Old Testament then he's still Jesus the Healer in the New Testament if he was Jehovah Shalom your peace is going to be restored I'm telling you right now if he was Jehovah Shalom your peace in the Old Testament then he's Jesus your peace in the New Testament if he's Jehovah Roa amen your Shepherd in the Old Testament then is your Jesus rooh High your Shepherd in the New Testament if he's Jehovah T new your righteousness in the alt he's Jesus T new your righteousness in the New Testament and if he's Jehovah ni your Banner your protection in the Old Testament when is Jesus miss your banner and protection in the New Testament man I tell you what Dr best couldn't he couldn't he had no answer to the one question and since Dr best can answer the question Dr best could not enjoy the attributes of the seven compound Redemptive names right of Jehovah I'm here to tell you he's my provider hallah he's my peace he's my protection he's my [Music] healer he's my
