[1:06:34] dollars a man per year for the next
[1:06:36] three years we had pledges from the
[1:06:39] church amen people that pledge say they

[1:06:56] dollars amen and last month towards that
[1:06:58] goal and which takes our total received
[1:07:02] year-to-date this year for fourteen
[1:07:04] thousand three hundred and seventy
[1:07:05] dollars and also we gained some interest
[1:07:08] on the money of two hundred and twelve
[1:07:10] thousand fourteen cent which gives us a
[1:07:12] total of fourteen thousand five hundred
[1:07:15] eighty to two dollars and twenty seven
[1:07:16] cents that's been raised this year

[1:15:21] so good to be here together with you a
[1:15:25] man won't appreciate brother Jack for
[1:15:28] the invitation
[1:15:31] I was actually meant to have gone back
[1:15:34] to to UK this last week but when you
[1:15:41] know brother Jack contacted me and say
[1:15:43] to me that he would want me to a
[1:15:46] minister I thought well I can't get away
[1:15:49] with this one this time so I had to
[1:15:53] change my travel plans and waited for
[1:15:57] this week so I could come here this
[1:15:59] Sunday
[1:16:00] a man I've been in West Palm Beach for
[1:16:07] quite a few times but it's actually my
[1:16:10] first time to come in Minister here
[1:16:12] we've been here before
[1:16:14] not on aged service day but just coming
[1:16:17] around to see the place but this is the
[1:16:20] first time that I'm actually ministering
[1:16:22] in in this place and appreciate the Lord
[1:16:26] for that a my brother Jack and the
[1:16:32] family have been with us for quite a few
[1:16:35] times in London so I thought that I or
[1:16:39] the church this one a man but as he said
[1:16:44] you know because of other reasons I mean
[1:16:51] this this is the beginning of many other
[1:16:55] man so it's it's warm Church to me man
[1:17:04] so if I preach like I'm at home just
[1:17:08] bear with me because I'm at home if I
[1:17:14] take my time like I'm at home just bear
[1:17:17] with me because I'm at home I don't
[1:17:21] quite believe you know in in short
[1:17:25] sermons I would do my best but I have a
[1:17:35] real struggle you know that is ahead of
[1:17:40] me here I'm trying to just bring
[1:17:43] something that we've been sharing one
[1:17:45] back home and I'm trying to consolidate
[1:17:48] three services into one and it's not the
[1:17:52] easiest of tasks so I better stop
[1:17:55] talking and get straight to the word so
[1:17:58] I can save my time shall we stand for
[1:18:00] the reading of the word a man but you
[1:18:07] know I was thinking as well that
[1:18:09] I had a wait for a week for this day so
[1:18:14] let me take my time yeah brother branham
[1:18:21] you'd say no I just preached a lot the
[1:18:24] short service for four hours I promise
[1:18:28] I'm not gonna be that long Romans
[1:18:32] chapter 9 if I just gonna be sure that
[1:18:37] this thing is working okay good
[1:18:41] praise the Lord amen that's good
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:49] Romans chapter 9 a bit of length the
[1:18:53] scripture reading so just try and run
[1:18:55] through this and not only this but when
[1:18:58] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[1:19:01] by our Father Isaac for the children
[1:19:03] being not yet born neither having done
[1:19:05] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:19:09] according to election might stand not of
[1:19:11] works but of him that calleth it was
[1:19:15] said unto her the elder shall serve the
[1:19:18] young as it is written Jacob have I
[1:19:22] loved but Esau have I hated for he saith
[1:19:26] to Moses I will have mercy on whom I
[1:19:29] will have mercy and I'll have compassion
[1:19:31] on whom I have compassion so then it is
[1:19:34] not of him that willeth know of him that
[1:19:36] runneth but of God that show what
[1:19:38] missing they would say then unto me why
[1:19:42] does he find fault for who had resisted
[1:19:45] his will
[1:19:47] nay but all men who art thou that
[1:19:51] repliest against God I like this no
[1:19:56] arguments with God
[1:19:58] shall the thing formed say to him that
[1:20:01] formed it why his doll for wires thou
[1:20:05] made me thus watch boys talking about
[1:20:10] affirmation have not the porter power
[1:20:14] over the clay of the same lump to make
[1:20:16] one vessel unto honour and another unto
[1:20:19] dishonour what if God willing to show
[1:20:22] his rod to make his power known endured
[1:20:25] with much long-suffering the vessels of
[1:20:28] Wrath fitted to destruction and that he
[1:20:32] might make known the riches of his glory
[1:20:36] in the vessels of Mercy which he had
[1:20:39] afore prepared unto glory and then in
[1:20:45] the book of revelations chapter 5 and I
[1:20:48] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:20:50] that throne a book written within and on
[1:20:52] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[1:20:54] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:20:57] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:21:00] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[1:21:02] no man in heaven no in earth neither
[1:21:05] under the earth was able to open the
[1:21:07] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[1:21:11] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:21:15] open and to read the book neither to
[1:21:17] look thereon and one of the elders saith
[1:21:20] unto me weep not behold the Lion of the
[1:21:24] tribe of Judah the root of David had
[1:21:27] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:21:30] the seven seals thereof and I beheld and
[1:21:34] lo in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:21:36] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:21:38] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:21:41] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:21:44] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:21:46] into all the earth and he came and he
[1:21:49] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:21:51] him that set upon the throne shall we
[1:21:55] bow our heads father we thank you for
[1:22:00] the reading of the word Lord we've come
[1:22:04] to that part that sacred part father
[1:22:07] that part
[1:22:08] that no man can do it takes you and you
[1:22:11] alone Lord we are worthy we unable we
[1:22:16] are feeble but furthered our strong thou
[1:22:20] are able law therefore we commit the
[1:22:23] service into your lovely precious hands
[1:22:25] and we ask you Father that you can take
[1:22:27] over all things from henceforth Lord
[1:22:30] I confess my inability but lord father
[1:22:33] we know we can do all things through
[1:22:35] Christ that strengthens us but I pray
[1:22:38] that you can take over from here forth
[1:22:40] may we together sit in them heavenly
[1:22:43] places in Christ Jesus will be careful
[1:22:45] in order to give you the honor and the
[1:22:47] glory and the praise for you this effort
[1:22:50] Lord our hallelujah Lord father belongs
[1:22:54] to You Father begin the spot with us in
[1:22:57] Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen
[1:23:01] praise the Lord we may be seated praise
[1:23:12] the Lord amen if I would take a title I
[1:23:17] want to speak on vessels of mercy and of
[1:23:21] special may see a man vessels of Mercy
[1:23:28] and of special may see there's a teacher
[1:23:34] in me that likes to teach so I always
[1:23:39] like to come from an angle where I give
[1:23:43] you know something more into the word
[1:23:47] how many love the word how many love the
[1:23:50] word how many love the word praise the
[1:23:55] Lord
[1:23:56] so can we get into the word man just
[1:24:00] bear with me as we you know just scroll
[1:24:03] through the scriptures and the
[1:24:04] quotations now we start from Romans
[1:24:08] chapter 9 Paul here he's bringing
[1:24:12] something that stumbles many people and
[1:24:16] he is bringing the concept of
[1:24:18] election yeah Paul says yeah that the
[1:24:22] children being not yet born neither
[1:24:25] having done any good or evil that the
[1:24:28] purpose of God according to election
[1:24:30] might stand now this stumbles a lot of
[1:24:35] people and they think to themselves you
[1:24:38] know when they've not yet done any good
[1:24:40] or evil they've not even been born but
[1:24:44] God is saying I hate another and I love
[1:24:47] another what type of a God is this and
[1:24:51] it stumbles many people to say but how
[1:24:53] can God work in this fashion but the
[1:24:56] Prophet comes along and he explains it
[1:24:59] to us and he says predestination is a
[1:25:01] hard word among a congregation of people
[1:25:04] because predestination really
[1:25:07] foreknowledge is a better word and
[1:25:10] predestination looks back to
[1:25:13] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[1:25:16] destiny and God being infinite in the
[1:25:19] beginning knew the end from the
[1:25:21] beginning therefore he knew what what
[1:25:24] people would do so he could foretell
[1:25:27] what would take place for he knew what
[1:25:30] would be so the Prophet says let's let's
[1:25:35] lighten this a little bit let's not make
[1:25:37] it too hard predestination is a bit of a
[1:25:40] strong word let's just dilute it man so
[1:25:46] that people can get to understand the
[1:25:48] way God looks at things so remember this
[1:25:51] is a diluted version a man trying to
[1:25:55] ease it for those people that can easily
[1:25:57] stumble so he says that predestination
[1:26:00] is a hard word but let's look at it from
[1:26:03] a perspective of full knowledge he goes
[1:26:06] on and it says before is or Jacob Amen
[1:26:10] hey the one was born God could say is so
[1:26:14] I have hated and Jacob I have loved
[1:26:17] because he foreknew what they could be
[1:26:22] so the reason why God could say this is
[1:26:26] because he knew I had of time he knew I
[1:26:30] had of their coming on earth what they
[1:26:33] would be praising the Lord he never met
[1:26:39] east so the way he was he wasn't willing
[1:26:41] that Esau would be that way but Esau by
[1:26:43] choice God knew who take that way so
[1:26:46] that's how he knows us today he knows
[1:26:50] your hearts you might be able to fool
[1:26:53] your neighbor you might be able to fool
[1:26:55] your pasta but you never be able to fool
[1:26:58] God because he knows your heart and how
[1:27:02] important this is to Christians but you
[1:27:05] must know that God knows your heart you
[1:27:08] might fool your posture you might fool
[1:27:10] the Deacons but you can never fool God
[1:27:13] so be honest with God hallelujah stay an
[1:27:17] honest believer this message is for the
[1:27:20] honest in hearts hallelujah so God knows
[1:27:25] us in and out and because he knows us
[1:27:28] like that he because of that for
[1:27:30] knowledge could predestinate so
[1:27:33] predestination is speaks of the
[1:27:35] omniscience of God amen God that knows
[1:27:39] all things and on the basis that he
[1:27:42] knows all things he could speak like
[1:27:44] Paul says in Romans 9 that the purpose
[1:27:47] of God according to election might stand
[1:27:52] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[1:27:58] because of his full knowledge are you
[1:28:02] with me and the Prophet says
[1:28:05] predestination looks back to
[1:28:08] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks
[1:28:11] onto destiny right predestination looks
[1:28:19] back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge
[1:28:21] looks onto destiny and what he is
[1:28:24] talking about here is what Paul says in
[1:28:27] Romans 8 remember we read
[1:28:29] means nine so the profit takes us back
[1:28:32] to Romans 8 and Romans 8 says for whom
[1:28:36] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[1:28:41] so predestination is out of
[1:28:43] foreknowledge are you with me and that's
[1:28:47] what Paul says in Romans chapter 8 to be
[1:28:51] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:28:53] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:28:55] brethren moreover whom he did
[1:28:58] predestinate them he also called and
[1:29:01] whom he called them he justified and
[1:29:04] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:29:07] so what is the plan here there is a four
[1:29:11] knowledge and the four knowledge leads
[1:29:13] to a calling why because there is a
[1:29:16] predestinated seed hallelujah when he
[1:29:21] calls he justifies but when he justifies
[1:29:24] he doesn't stop there he's gonna finish
[1:29:26] what he started he's gonna go refine so
[1:29:30] he's not doing a pot job he's doing a
[1:29:33] full-time job I'm so glad that my god
[1:29:37] will finish where it starts my salvation
[1:29:41] is not even in my hands your salvation
[1:29:44] is not even in your hands when God
[1:29:46] starts with you we will finish that
[1:29:49] which he starts a man praise be to God
[1:29:55] so draws that he did foreknow are the
[1:30:00] ones that he predestinated so
[1:30:03] predestination is looking back to for
[1:30:06] knowledge but foreknowledge is looking
[1:30:09] to destiny now you with me so
[1:30:13] predestination hallelujah it looks back
[1:30:16] to for knowledge but that foreknowledge
[1:30:19] it is looking to destiny are you with me
[1:30:25] but I want you to watch these are
[1:30:27] vessels at creation
[1:30:33] the right at creation hallelujah God is
[1:30:38] predestinated at that point but the
[1:30:40] predestination so this is not about when
[1:30:43] you are born this is not about when you
[1:30:45] have done something wrong this is not
[1:30:47] about a little way in your life this is
[1:30:50] right at creation before where the
[1:30:54] children were even born God being an
[1:30:57] omniscient God before knows all things
[1:31:00] and because of the foreknowledge he
[1:31:03] looks to destiny you came from God you
[1:31:07] are going back to God you at creation he
[1:31:11] can predestinate
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:16] hallelujah and God is not the one that
[1:31:20] is making people to then make these
[1:31:22] choices he is only saying I know what
[1:31:26] choice they are going to make and on
[1:31:29] that basis I predestinate but let me go
[1:31:36] a step further and say that God does
[1:31:39] this in order to give every person an
[1:31:42] eco opportunity I mean that's why he
[1:31:48] said even to Cain yeah why on the road
[1:31:53] and why is thy countenance fallen if
[1:31:55] thou doest well shalt thou not be
[1:31:57] accepted so everyone is given an equal
[1:32:02] opportunity to choose right or to choose
[1:32:06] wrong if you choose right you'll be
[1:32:08] accepted even if you are King but yet
[1:32:16] God knows that there is nothing in Cain
[1:32:19] that is able to make that decision but
[1:32:23] he gives them an equal opportunity and
[1:32:27] the same thing we find in Judas the
[1:32:31] Bible say that he quotes the twelve yeah
[1:32:36] and one of them he says is a devil but
[1:32:41] here an opportunity the same opportunity
[1:32:44] that Peter had the same opportunity that
[1:32:47] John James had is the same opportunity
[1:32:50] that Judas had if I not chosen twelve
[1:32:55] and one of you is a devil but I have
[1:33:00] chosen all of you and inspect of Judas
[1:33:04] Iscariot he knew exactly he suffered
[1:33:08] long with this man but though he knew
[1:33:11] that this man even if I give him an
[1:33:13] equal opportunity you will still choose
[1:33:17] but it on that basis God predestinate
[1:33:23] are you with me so this is what Paul is
[1:33:27] talking about when he starts in Romans
[1:33:29] chapter 9 he's pointing back to go to
[1:33:32] Romans chapter 8 which is the
[1:33:34] predestination by foreknowledge but then
[1:33:38] Paul does not stop there Paul goes a
[1:33:42] little deeper are you with me and in
[1:33:46] verse 19 he says that would say then why
[1:33:49] God he had find for four who had
[1:33:52] resisted his will then Paul says
[1:33:57] neighbor o man who art thou that
[1:34:00] repliest against God shall the thing
[1:34:02] formed say to him that formed it why
[1:34:05] hast thou made me thus if not the portal
[1:34:09] power over the clay of the same lump to
[1:34:11] make one vessel unto honour and another
[1:34:14] unto dishonour so here Paul says now he
[1:34:19] introduces a concept of formation shall
[1:34:27] the thing formed are you with me
[1:34:32] so we find that there is a step when God
[1:34:36] comes to formation and information we
[1:34:40] are seeing that there are two types of
[1:34:43] vessels that are to be formed verse 22
[1:34:47] and if God willing to show his rod and
[1:34:49] to make his power known endured with
[1:34:51] much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:34:54] fitted to destruction and that he might
[1:34:59] make known the riches of his glory on
[1:35:01] the vessels of Mercy are you with me so
[1:35:08] we find now that when it comes to a
[1:35:10] stage of formation there are other
[1:35:13] vessels that are to be introduced in
[1:35:15] this vessels are vessels of Wrath and
[1:35:18] then there are vessels of Nancy but this
[1:35:22] is not happening at creation this is
[1:35:24] happening information
[1:35:25] and information vessels are made
[1:35:28] different are you with me so poor at
[1:35:32] this stage is not just looking at the
[1:35:35] the result of the phone knowledge but
[1:35:38] poor is also looking at the purpose of
[1:35:41] the formation so there is a purpose here
[1:35:46] and the purpose is at the origin when
[1:35:51] the vessel is formed one is made a
[1:35:54] vessel of Honor and another is made a
[1:35:57] vessel of dishonor one is made a vessel
[1:36:00] of loss and another is made a vessel of
[1:36:03] mercy and the difference is coming a man
[1:36:06] at this formation stage are you with me
[1:36:10] but when is this formation stage I love
[1:36:13] the depth of the word of God the man
[1:36:16] because when God created man it was in
[1:36:20] Genesis 1 and Genesis 1 is not a
[1:36:24] formation Genesis 1:27 is a creation so
[1:36:28] God created man in his own image in the
[1:36:31] image of God created he him male and
[1:36:34] female created he them the Genesis 1:27
[1:36:38] man is a created man this is not a
[1:36:42] formed man are you following me so far
[1:36:45] and this created man was created in the
[1:36:48] image of God
[1:36:50] in the likeness of God therefore the
[1:36:52] origin of this man is God is DNA of God
[1:36:58] his blood is the blood of God everything
[1:37:02] about him is about God because he's made
[1:37:05] in the image of God in the likeness of
[1:37:08] God he's all God and nothing else
[1:37:13] and when he created them male and female
[1:37:15] created he them and he called their name
[1:37:19] Adam hallelujah
[1:37:22] this is at creation have you ever
[1:37:25] wondered he never gave them a sermon he
[1:37:31] called their name Adam not Adam so in
[1:37:34] song have you ever wondered why a man if
[1:37:38] you read the genealogies in the Bible
[1:37:40] God never gives these children's names
[1:37:43] you hear this who was the son of
[1:37:45] so-and-so who was the son of so-and-so
[1:37:47] who was the son of millenia who was the
[1:37:50] son of cainan
[1:37:51] who was the son of eNOS who was the son
[1:37:54] of Seth who was the son of Adam who was
[1:37:56] the son of God no senem what was their
[1:38:03] senem Oh God
[1:38:08] their same hymn was where they came from
[1:38:11] it was speaking about an origin so their
[1:38:14] same name was God
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:18] and that's why the bible says call no
[1:38:21] man father for you everyone that is in
[1:38:24] heaven he's our Father
[1:38:27] so our tree senem is God I came from God
[1:38:33] I'm going back to God I can't wait for a
[1:38:38] day when I will not be caught Greiner oh
[1:38:41] praise be to God
[1:38:43] but I'll be called God but the hour is
[1:38:47] here what you shall be caught by a true
[1:38:49] senem are you with me Adam came from God
[1:38:54] his origin was gone therefore his
[1:38:58] destiny was already sealed and it was
[1:39:02] God let me say there was no amount of
[1:39:05] sinning that could change his destiny
[1:39:16] with me could ever change the destiny of
[1:39:20] Adam because the destiny of Adam is not
[1:39:23] on the basis of what he shall do but the
[1:39:26] destiny of ayodhya is on the basis of
[1:39:28] where he came from why because God can
[1:39:35] never denies on DNA he can never deny
[1:39:38] his own blood so draw Adam sinned but
[1:39:42] when Adam sinned God to rush down Adam
[1:39:46] Adam Adam Adam why are you hiding have
[1:39:53] you done something wrong yes the woman
[1:39:56] that you gave me but God says Oh quick
[1:39:59] like come on dress in this slim scheme
[1:40:02] and what was the mystery behind that
[1:40:05] lambskin it was the shedding of blood
[1:40:07] why an atom that had seen but God could
[1:40:11] not allow him any manner
[1:40:15] [Music]
[1:40:16] because he was he was he came from God
[1:40:23] and immediately
[1:41:04] he said I'm sorry
[1:41:24] until David wondered and he says what is
[1:41:27] man that thou art mindful of him and the
[1:41:32] son of man that thou visitest see him
[1:41:34] for thou has made him a little lower
[1:41:36] than angels and is crowned him with
[1:41:38] glory and honor that made him to have
[1:41:41] dominion over the works of the head
[1:41:43] what is man the lower than angels but
[1:41:48] you suffered him not to be lost forever
[1:41:50] you came for his Redemption because he
[1:41:53] came from God he's going back to God
[1:42:00] that's at creation are you with me only
[1:42:05] one type of a vessel mad it's called a
[1:42:08] vessel of mercy no matter what happens
[1:42:13] to that vessel there is redemption for
[1:42:15] it
[1:42:16] but now Paul says shall the thing formed
[1:42:21] he's not talking of creation he's
[1:42:24] talking of formation and the question
[1:42:27] then is when was men formed and thus
[1:42:31] Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man
[1:42:34] out of the dust of the ground so Genesis
[1:42:40] 1:27 was the creation but Genesis 2:7
[1:42:45] was a formation now you with me and it
[1:42:50] is this formation stage all glory to God
[1:42:53] that God now introduces two different
[1:42:56] types of vessels one is a vessel unto
[1:43:00] honor and another is a vessel unto
[1:43:03] dishonour it is at formation stage are
[1:43:08] you with me now you with me so Genesis
[1:43:12] 1:27 hallelujah at creation there is
[1:43:15] only one type of with less so that is
[1:43:17] formed is a vessel of mercy but when it
[1:43:20] comes to Genesis 2:7 then now we are at
[1:43:24] formation stage and we are introduced in
[1:43:26] another vessel which is a vessel of
[1:43:28] Wrath but can the porter or can the
[1:43:39] thing formed say to the porter why have
[1:43:42] you made me thus so there is one water
[1:43:48] but that porter is molding vessels of
[1:43:52] mercy and vessels of Wrath and is making
[1:43:57] them to purpose but though he is the
[1:44:04] porter but he doesn't use his own
[1:44:06] instrumentality to make the vessels of
[1:44:08] Wrath he uses the instrumentality of the
[1:44:11] serpent but who is the porter the porter
[1:44:19] is God but the instrumentality is the
[1:44:22] instrumentality of the serpent
[1:44:25] and that is why if could say I have got
[1:44:28] an immense from the Lord and when
[1:44:33] brother Branham explains it he says
[1:44:35] where does life come from life only
[1:44:38] comes from one source that is from God
[1:44:42] and that's why she could say I've gotten
[1:44:46] a man from the Lord but though the
[1:44:49] instrumentality was the instrumentality
[1:44:51] of the serpent in this formation stage
[1:44:58] vessels are made to propose their
[1:45:02] vessels of mercy and the vessels of
[1:45:04] Wrath now because vessels are made two
[1:45:07] different types we can understand the
[1:45:10] Bible we can now understand Genesis six
[1:45:13] why we end up with two lineages of
[1:45:16] people and it came to pass when men
[1:45:18] began to multiply on the face of the
[1:45:20] earth and daughters were born unto them
[1:45:22] that the sons of God saw that the
[1:45:24] daughters of men now we have two races
[1:45:28] the sons of God and the daughters of men
[1:45:33] where are they coming from they are
[1:45:36] coming at formation stage we now have to
[1:45:39] linear this now we can understand that
[1:45:42] how that Judas was formed as a son of
[1:45:47] perdition because it's a vessel of rod
[1:45:50] and why does God need vessels of water
[1:45:54] they are formed for a purpose he needs a
[1:45:57] dirty man for a dirty job
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:03] Oh glory glory I'm reminded of the Bible
[1:46:10] that there was a time in heaven when
[1:46:13] they God wanted somebody to go and
[1:46:15] deceive ah and God looked everywhere in
[1:46:21] heaven and he says you can go and
[1:46:23] deceive ah ha ha and there was no found
[1:46:25] any one angel came about and he says oh
[1:46:29] I'm going to this God says you're too
[1:46:31] righteous sit down another angel comes
[1:46:33] along he says I'll do this is your two
[1:46:35] lashes sit down until they come in
[1:46:38] spirit from the piece away and the
[1:46:42] spirit came before God and he says go
[1:46:46] and deceive and he says how are you
[1:46:48] gonna do it
[1:46:49] he says I'll become if lying spirit and
[1:46:52] God says go you can succeed you I a
[1:46:56] vessel of rods you are created for this
[1:46:59] purpose you can go but could not do it
[1:47:17] are you with me
[1:47:21] so God when he now creates he creates
[1:47:26] only vessels of Mercy but when it comes
[1:47:30] to formation he allows other vessels to
[1:47:33] come in are you following me but in all
[1:47:37] this the Bible tells us nevertheless the
[1:47:41] foundation of God standeth sure having
[1:47:43] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:47:47] his
[1:47:52] and God's focus is always on those that
[1:47:57] are his
[1:47:59] these are DNA of his DNA these are blood
[1:48:03] of his blood these came from God and
[1:48:07] they are going back to God
[1:48:08] these are vessels of mercy when
[1:48:11] something goes wrong in their life
[1:48:14] God steps in these are vessels of
[1:48:22] medicine when something goes wrong in
[1:48:24] their life God's Pepsi
[1:48:27] like when something went wrong in the
[1:48:30] life of our Dharma God stepped in are
[1:48:33] you following me the destiny is already
[1:48:36] sealed and it is sealed because of the
[1:48:38] origin where they came from it defines
[1:48:41] where they are going God cannot allow
[1:48:45] nothing to interfere with that not even
[1:48:53] God can even stop death hallelujah
[1:48:58] until a vessel of Messi's redeemed or
[1:49:02] somebody says what do you know what you
[1:49:03] are talking about yes I know what I'm
[1:49:06] talking about the thief on the cross the
[1:49:10] main was a robber the man was dying as a
[1:49:13] robot
[1:49:14] the man had never seen his tape of the
[1:49:16] door of the church he was nothing but a
[1:49:19] few tamanna
[1:49:20] and he was dying but God predestinated
[1:49:23] that man because he came from God and
[1:49:27] God knew that I'm gonna be on the cross
[1:49:30] together with that man and he shall say
[1:49:33] the right words and when he says the
[1:49:36] right word he will change his destiny
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] was that judge him and said he's gonna
[1:49:44] have capital punishment he's going to be
[1:49:46] crucified they'd said we killed a sinner
[1:49:49] but a mystery unfolded on the cross in a
[1:49:55] private conversation
[1:49:57] remember this was not being held by all
[1:50:00] the others this was a conversation that
[1:50:03] was between the three of them that we on
[1:50:05] the cross many that shall die and you
[1:50:09] think but on the deathbed law changes
[1:50:16] their destiny until the Prophet says
[1:50:20] there shall be many surprises in heaven
[1:50:25] because it's a disgrace to the Shepherd
[1:50:28] if a sheep does not come home it's not a
[1:50:31] disgrace to the ship is a disgrace to
[1:50:33] the Shepherd it's the responsibility of
[1:50:37] the Shepherd Oh glory of God we need to
[1:50:42] is to apply the token when we apply the
[1:50:45] token it's God's responsibility to bring
[1:50:48] them back in can you say Amen
[1:50:51] children can go the way they go but when
[1:50:54] you apply the token is God's responsible
[1:50:57] error to bring them back in and he will
[1:51:00] bring them back in
[1:51:04] Oh glory God can even stop deaths in
[1:51:11] order to redeem a predestinate succeed
[1:51:17] even when Satan confuses them you know
[1:51:21] in this world of confusion where people
[1:51:23] are being confused because of this
[1:51:25] teaching and because of that teaching if
[1:51:27] it's a vessel of mercy
[1:51:29] it will always be a vessel of mercy God
[1:51:31] will do something I don't care what the
[1:51:36] devil tries to do but God will do
[1:51:39] something because it's his own people it
[1:51:43] is his own DNA it is his own blood he
[1:51:46] will do something about it
[1:51:48] are you with me Church or glory to God
[1:51:51] what is it that God can do he can use
[1:51:55] other means even if the gospel fails can
[1:52:03] you say what do you mean preacher man
[1:52:05] I'll tell you what I mean that when the
[1:52:08] gospel seems to have failed God still
[1:52:11] has other means are you with me the
[1:52:15] prophecies a glass of water
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:21] and I believe God says for the sake of
[1:52:30] that glass of water
[1:52:31] you shall kameena is a vessel or message
[1:52:35] that God hallelujah cannot let go
[1:52:39] praise God in the highest are you
[1:52:43] following me God can use other means
[1:52:46] what other means love the Prophet was
[1:52:50] told all that you ever laughed I have
[1:52:53] given them to you and all that ever
[1:52:56] loved you I have given them to you so if
[1:52:59] you ever loved the Prophet he God has
[1:53:02] already given you change are you with me
[1:53:05] God can use other means praise the Lord
[1:53:09] in the why because these are vessels of
[1:53:13] Mercy praise be to God I love this hey
[1:53:20] man can I proceed
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] Janina the Bible says here and that he
[1:53:28] might make known the riches of his glory
[1:53:31] on the vessels of mass God has an agenda
[1:53:36] and the agenda is that he might
[1:53:40] hallelujah make known the riches of his
[1:53:43] glory on the vessels of mercy so
[1:53:49] information that might look the same
[1:53:51] they might talk the same they might walk
[1:53:54] the same until people say you are the
[1:53:57] same but behind what appears there is an
[1:54:02] origin there is a predestination and
[1:54:05] there is a vessel of Mercy or a vessel
[1:54:09] of Wrath they walk the same they look
[1:54:13] the same they are living in the same
[1:54:16] world you might actually be working in
[1:54:18] the same place with somebody but when
[1:54:20] God looks at the two vessels God says
[1:54:23] this one is a vessel of messy
[1:54:25] but this one is a vessel of broth and
[1:54:30] they walk like they are the same but in
[1:54:35] a certain point God is gonna show that
[1:54:39] there is a difference because God knows
[1:54:43] who are he and at the appointed time God
[1:54:48] is gonna show the difference just like
[1:54:52] it was in Exodus chapter 11 and they
[1:54:55] shall be a great cry throughout all the
[1:54:58] land of Egypt such as there was none
[1:55:00] like it now it shall be like it anymore
[1:55:03] but against any of the children of
[1:55:06] Israel shall not a dog movies tongue
[1:55:09] against men or beasts that he may know
[1:55:12] how the Lord put a difference between
[1:55:14] the Egyptians and Israel now the
[1:55:17] children of Israel had lived in Egypt
[1:55:19] for some time they've been treated as
[1:55:22] slaves in Egypt for some time it looked
[1:55:25] like there were no bodies but God knew
[1:55:27] that these are vessels of mercy and
[1:55:29] because there were vessels of medicine
[1:55:32] God had an appointed time when he said
[1:55:34] first time I shall begin to show that I
[1:55:38] don't put a difference between an
[1:55:40] Egyptian and in Israel let me say there
[1:55:43] is an hour where God will show that he
[1:55:46] puts a difference between a vessel of
[1:55:48] Mercy and a vessel of Wrath and I look
[1:55:52] like you are the same it might look like
[1:55:54] your destinies are the same but there is
[1:55:56] a time that comes up that God says I
[1:55:59] will show that this is a vessel of mercy
[1:56:02] yes things might go wrong for a little
[1:56:05] while but there is an hour when God will
[1:56:07] say I'm changing things
[1:56:09] I'm beginning to show that this is a
[1:56:12] vessel of mercy yes you might have
[1:56:15] suffered for a little while but there is
[1:56:18] coming an hour where God will begin to
[1:56:20] show that you are a vessel
[1:56:22] Masey God is a label on it and it says
[1:56:28] endow with care it is fragile do you
[1:56:34] know when you transport vessels a man
[1:56:37] they will put a label on it if it is a
[1:56:40] glass vessel they will say fragile
[1:56:42] didn't know it care don't just throw
[1:56:45] around and know it care God has good on
[1:56:49] his own children vessels of mercy
[1:56:55] this one is fragile because God put
[1:57:07] limits on what the devil can do in your
[1:57:10] life God puts limits on how far the
[1:57:13] devil can take you in your life yes you
[1:57:16] might allow you to suffer for a little
[1:57:18] while but there is a limit that God has
[1:57:20] placed but when that limit is reached
[1:57:23] God says enough is enough I'll not allow
[1:57:26] my daughter to remain in that situation
[1:57:29] because she is a vessel of Mercy I'm
[1:57:31] coming to redeem her my son to remain in
[1:57:36] that situation he is a vessel of message
[1:57:39] may I speak to somebody this afternoon
[1:57:41] to say yes you might have waited out but
[1:57:44] the limit is about getting rich
[1:57:47] [Applause]
[1:57:52] your life
[1:58:15] [Applause]
[1:59:02] for me to speak I believe in spiritual
[1:59:06] food that comes in is to season I
[1:59:09] believe in a God that knows our desire I
[1:59:12] believe in a God that announces his next
[1:59:15] program from the poopies when I come to
[1:59:19] church I'm coming to hear an update of
[1:59:23] my situation from glory and when the
[1:59:27] preacher say something that's what
[1:59:29] heaven is saying to me
[1:59:32] that's the way you must take Church your
[1:59:38] season is arrived your seasonal freedom
[1:59:47] always be like this
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:22] [Applause]

[2:00:39] [Music]
[2:00:48] you are somebody
[2:00:54] [Applause]
[2:01:04] we are nullify all the ordinances we are
[2:01:09] nullify all the plots of the wicked
[2:01:12] devil and we are saying mercy let me
[2:01:15] rewrite your life
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:22] why because we are a vessel of mercy yes
[2:01:27] sir with a vessel of mercy there is an
[2:01:32] hour of remembrance it might look like
[2:01:35] you have forgotten it might look like
[2:01:37] you are neglected but if you are a
[2:01:39] vessel of mercy there is an hour of
[2:01:42] remembrance
[2:01:43] Motech I was neglected mother Kali was
[2:01:46] forgotten but they come a day when the
[2:01:49] King sada bring the book of the
[2:01:52] chronicles what has been done unto this
[2:01:54] man and I believe this morning God is
[2:01:57] saying bring the book of the chronicles
[2:02:01] God is saying bring the book of the
[2:02:03] chronicles what has been done unto the
[2:02:06] sister
[2:02:10] she's been faithful she's been holding
[2:02:14] on receive your blessing receive your
[2:02:21] blessing in the name of Jesus receive
[2:02:25] your blessing in the name of Jesus
[2:02:27] receive your blessing in the name of
[2:02:30] Jesus
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:36] [Applause]
[2:02:38] praise God praise God praise God praise
[2:02:41] God vessels of Missi you are alright yes
[2:02:48] sir
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:56] [Applause]
[2:02:58] is the Lamb of God can we take it
[2:03:04] further let's take it further
[2:03:09] a man let's take it further praise the
[2:03:18] Lord
[2:03:22] as I come to vessels or special messy as
[2:03:32] if it's not enough to be a vessel of
[2:03:35] messy God also makes you a vessel of
[2:03:38] specialness when God created to create
[2:03:48] the vessels of Mercy but when God formed
[2:03:51] deformed vessels of Wrath and vessels of
[2:03:54] Mercy but at the same time I take it
[2:03:57] further and say that predestination he
[2:04:00] also then predestinate a people to an
[2:04:03] age a man because the prophecies here
[2:04:12] uija parts the son of God an attribute
[2:04:15] of God you know the very age you were
[2:04:18] coming he predestinated you to that age
[2:04:23] to take that place and no one else can
[2:04:27] take it oh that makes me shout God
[2:04:33] predestinated you to this age
[2:04:36] take that place and no one can take your
[2:04:40] place and no one can take you away from
[2:04:44] your place you are going nowhere god
[2:05:02] predestinated you to this edge to take
[2:05:07] that place and no one can take it
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:13] praise be to God he goes on in these
[2:05:17] days now watch the wisdom of God knowing
[2:05:20] that would be unbelievers and how the
[2:05:23] majority will be unbelievers he by
[2:05:25] foreknowledge predestinated a seed for
[2:05:29] every age that would believe it now if
[2:05:33] you notice that for each age right on
[2:05:36] with this word everything right on time
[2:05:39] nothing hinders God so God predestinated
[2:05:46] the seed for every age and God has
[2:05:49] allotted a word for that age and nothing
[2:05:54] whoever in the God amen
[2:05:57] so in predestination God allocates a
[2:06:00] people to an age he allocates a word to
[2:06:02] that age and he says in John chapter 10
[2:06:05] my ship who hear my voice and in every
[2:06:12] age there are vessels of Mercy are you
[2:06:15] with me and when when when when when
[2:06:18] they come in their age
[2:06:20] mercy has to find them no matter where
[2:06:24] they are no matter how low they are sunk
[2:06:28] no matter how deep in sin they are but
[2:06:32] God knows he's on nevertheless the
[2:06:36] foundation of God's ten sure the Lord
[2:06:39] knoweth them that are his
[2:06:41] the devil might've hoodwink them and put
[2:06:44] them somewhere but the Aged message who
[2:06:47] fished them out and nothing hinders God
[2:06:53] not even their own unbelief
[2:06:57] [Applause]
[2:07:01] not even their own desire I think of the
[2:07:05] time when brother Billy Paul left the
[2:07:08] message and he started backsliding and
[2:07:10] he went into all sortsa his father
[2:07:12] called him and he said Billy Paul , he
[2:07:15] said but your head against the wall
[2:07:16] stretch your hand out and he says you I
[2:07:21] had a crossroad in your life and he says
[2:07:23] you are standing right here in the
[2:07:25] middle this side list to the right Road
[2:07:28] but this side leads to the wrong road
[2:07:30] and when you take this wrong side you
[2:07:33] shall have to pay for it but he says but
[2:07:37] before you get to the end here God is
[2:07:41] gonna turn you back
[2:07:43] why because I applied the talkin
[2:07:48] [Applause]
[2:07:51] hallelujah he say go the way you want
[2:07:55] but before you get to the end here God
[2:07:58] is gonna turn you back because I apply
[2:08:01] the toggle when you have applied the
[2:08:06] tokens you can rest
[2:08:08] God will restore God will restore in his
[2:08:14] season he will just like he did with
[2:08:17] brother Billy Paul he's still the same
[2:08:19] God God so Massey has to go and pick
[2:08:25] them up
[2:08:26] amen and God is a program in each age
[2:08:31] that caters for those vessels of mercy
[2:08:34] and that brings me to vessels of special
[2:08:36] mercy we have read in the book of
[2:08:39] Revelation chapter 5 and I saw in the
[2:08:41] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[2:08:43] a book written within and on the
[2:08:45] backside sealed with seven seals and as
[2:08:47] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[2:08:50] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[2:08:52] book and to loose the seals there are
[2:08:55] and no man in heaven or in earth neither
[2:08:57] under the earth was able to open the
[2:08:59] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[2:09:01] much because no man was found worthy to
[2:09:03] open the book and to read the book
[2:09:05] neither to look thereon and one of the
[2:09:07] elders a man and one of the elders saith
[2:09:11] unto me we'd not behold the Lion of the
[2:09:14] tribe of Judah the root of David had
[2:09:17] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[2:09:19] the seals and I beheld and lo in the
[2:09:22] midst of the throne and of the four
[2:09:23] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[2:09:25] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[2:09:28] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[2:09:31] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[2:09:33] the earth and he came and he took the
[2:09:36] book out of the right hand of him that
[2:09:38] set upon the throne now according to the
[2:09:41] program of God the hour has arrived a
[2:09:45] great event is gonna take place the
[2:09:49] program of God cannot be hindered it is
[2:09:52] unstoppable
[2:09:53] the seals must now be opened the hour
[2:09:57] has arrived there is a proclamation that
[2:09:59] goes in heaven who is worthy to open the
[2:10:03] book and to loose the seals and there
[2:10:05] was no man that was found worthy and the
[2:10:07] Bible says that John began to weep but
[2:10:11] when John was weeping then the elder
[2:10:13] came along and he said we've not John
[2:10:16] because the
[2:10:17] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[2:10:20] hallelujah
[2:10:22] so John is looking around he's now
[2:10:25] wandering but where is this lion of the
[2:10:27] tribe of Judah he's the one that has
[2:10:29] prevailed here and John is waiting to
[2:10:32] see a lion that has prevailed to open
[2:10:34] the book but what happens John does not
[2:10:38] see a lion a mystery unfolds in the
[2:10:44] midst of the throne let me read the
[2:10:47] quotation fest and the chemin of the
[2:10:50] elder standing in the midst of the four
[2:10:52] beasts and all the great hosts of heaven
[2:10:55] say don't weep John oh my
[2:10:58] don't be brokenhearted John don't weep
[2:11:00] for the Lion of the tribe of Judah the
[2:11:03] root and offspring of David he has
[2:11:05] prevailed and when he looked around to
[2:11:10] see where the lion was he saw a lamb
[2:11:13] strange look for a lion and see I like
[2:11:21] that look for a lion and you see but I
[2:11:27] want you to watch ways this lamb coming
[2:11:30] from a few moments ago John is looking
[2:11:34] and he sees no laugh are you with me
[2:11:37] hallelujah
[2:11:39] the prophet of God says here John hadn't
[2:11:42] noticed the lamb before you know hear it
[2:11:44] hadn't been mentioned before no way had
[2:11:47] it been mentioned John didn't seat all
[2:11:49] over the heavens as he was looking but
[2:11:51] hear it come forth so John when he was
[2:11:56] taken up in Revelation chapter 4 he was
[2:11:58] shown everything in heaven then he says
[2:12:01] I saw one sit on the throne and then the
[2:12:04] Bible talks about the four living
[2:12:06] creatures the Bible talks about the
[2:12:09] twenty-four elders the Bible talks about
[2:12:11] the
[2:12:12] see like crystal glass the Bible
[2:12:14] described everything around the throne
[2:12:16] and there was no lamp but the Bible says
[2:12:22] from the midst of the throne the very
[2:12:26] same place where God was sitting from
[2:12:31] the midst of the throne rose the lamp
[2:12:34] what happened on that day God in Martha
[2:12:38] he changed his form those way he changed
[2:12:43] his form to become a lamb he just
[2:12:45] changed his form again and he's showed
[2:12:48] what he had done and he became the
[2:12:50] bleeding Lamb of God and he went and he
[2:12:53] took the book a man from him that was
[2:12:55] sitting on the throne but was the the
[2:13:00] prophet of God says remember he had been
[2:13:02] on his mediatorial work back here so he
[2:13:09] had a mission behind the scenes and down
[2:13:21] through the ages
[2:13:23] he has been on that mission so he rises
[2:13:27] from that mission Oh glory the
[2:13:30] prophecies wait till we get over here
[2:13:34] but one hour take that half one half
[2:13:37] also retake that half hour that is
[2:13:40] silent the sanctuary is smoking there's
[2:13:44] no more intercession the sacrifice is
[2:13:47] left it's a judgement seat there's no
[2:13:50] blood on it normal for the blood covered
[2:13:52] lamp is walked away so the throne is
[2:13:58] changing and when is the throne changing
[2:14:02] it is at the hour of the breaking of the
[2:14:04] seals the lamb is ready to change laws
[2:14:08] from being a lot from being a lamp to
[2:14:11] becoming a liar and the prophecies
[2:14:14] remember in the Old Testament as long as
[2:14:17] the blood was off the message it was
[2:14:19] judgment but as
[2:14:21] as the blood was on that there was mercy
[2:14:24] [Music]
[2:14:26] but when the lamp walked away that did
[2:14:30] it but the elder was right he was a lion
[2:14:37] see the outer called him said lion
[2:14:40] because he had been a lab on the
[2:14:42] intercessor a bloody lamb but now he's
[2:14:44] coming forth as a lion his days of
[2:14:47] intercession is over
[2:14:50] [Music]
[2:14:53] mercy is over he says so here come the
[2:14:59] lamb his intercessory days is over the
[2:15:02] Mediterranean a stats when the angels
[2:15:04] coming to stand you wait till we get in
[2:15:08] the seals and time shall be no more that
[2:15:15] half hour of silence watch what takes
[2:15:18] place in that half hour silent on that
[2:15:21] Seventh Seal so when it comes to the
[2:15:27] time of the seventh seal the throne is
[2:15:30] changing am i reading the prophet when
[2:15:36] we get to the seals hallelujah to the
[2:15:39] seventh seal the lamb walks away and
[2:15:43] when the lamb walks away mercy enhance
[2:15:47] and indeed when you follow the breach
[2:15:50] message it gives the impression that
[2:15:52] when the seals are opened Missy is
[2:15:54] normal and if you get that impression
[2:16:00] you are not alone because even when the
[2:16:02] Prophet preached the message even those
[2:16:05] that were listening to him they came to
[2:16:07] the conclusion that when the seals are
[2:16:09] opened
[2:16:09] Missy shall be normal until they came in
[2:16:12] the ask brother Branham a question
[2:16:14] brother Branham will you interpret after
[2:16:16] he says who the dispensation of grace be
[2:16:19] over after you open the seven seals why
[2:16:26] because of the way that he had put
[2:16:28] things
[2:16:29] the breach message until they ask
[2:16:34] questions and answers on the seals will
[2:16:37] the dispensation of grace be over after
[2:16:40] you open the seals and the Prophet gives
[2:16:43] an answer praise God I hope not
[2:16:47] no no friends don't get that in your
[2:16:50] mind you just go right on dig the
[2:16:54] potatoes and God would search and right
[2:16:58] on if it takes place in the morning
[2:17:01] you'll be found doing just exactly what
[2:17:03] you're supposed to be doing don't see
[2:17:06] when you do that you twist the very
[2:17:08] thing away from the purpose that it is
[2:17:11] intended for you get a little peculiar
[2:17:13] salt and when you get your own ideas
[2:17:15] about it don't take your own idea just
[2:17:18] when you sit and listen to things like
[2:17:21] that say thank you lord
[2:17:23] I'm just going to walk a little closer
[2:17:25] to you see I'm going to don't quit work
[2:17:29] and say and sell out everything keep on
[2:17:35] digging your potatoes keep on planting
[2:17:39] your potatoes
[2:17:40] keep going to university don't stop keep
[2:17:47] doing what you need to do he's coming
[2:17:57] tomorrow
[2:18:01] if you need to buy a brand new car buy a
[2:18:03] brand new car he's coming tomorrow
[2:18:13] [Applause]
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:20] brother branham some say Messi is over
[2:18:23] and no one can be saved now is this true
[2:18:27] I'm glad I got this one this is brother
[2:18:31] bran we watch and pray we watch and pray
[2:18:34] in prayer line and it seems some are
[2:18:36] still finding Messi now that's the first
[2:18:38] question is God - is messy over don't
[2:18:42] never think that just keep right on
[2:18:47] doing everything you can until you are
[2:18:50] taken away if I know Jesus was coming
[2:18:56] this afternoon
[2:18:57] I'll be doing just the thing I'm doing
[2:18:59] right now just continuing right now
[2:19:02] mercy is always open
[2:19:06] oh let's spend God
[2:19:13] oh that's not enough praise but you just
[2:19:18] think that mercy is always open when the
[2:19:23] world is discounted you when even the
[2:19:25] church world had discounted you and they
[2:19:28] save you you are gone thank you Lord for
[2:19:46] mercy see open thank you Lord for mercy
[2:19:49] still open so don't count yourself out
[2:19:53] count yourself in by the mercies of God
[2:19:56] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:19:59] mercy is still open worry and what did
[2:20:09] he do now he's been back here
[2:20:12] interceding until his blood has atoned
[2:20:15] for every person and the lamb now knows
[2:20:18] was written in the book amen he's been
[2:20:25] back here interceding until his blood is
[2:20:28] atoned for every person and the lamb
[2:20:31] knows what's written in the book so he
[2:20:34] won't finish until the last one comes in
[2:20:38] so he not from the foundation of the
[2:20:41] world need their names were in there so
[2:20:43] he has stood back here and done me and
[2:20:46] done mid-year to work like until May
[2:20:49] mediatorial word to everyone that's been
[2:20:51] put in the book has been redeemed and
[2:20:54] it's finished and now he walks out so he
[2:20:59] does not walk out until the last one is
[2:21:02] in so God has got the names of those
[2:21:08] that are in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[2:21:10] because he's looking at the names of
[2:21:12] them that I in the
[2:21:13] book of life he's taking she's in she's
[2:21:19] not yet Ian hold fire
[2:21:22] she's not yet in hold the Ross Oh glory
[2:21:27] stay on the Mediterra I'll stay here
[2:21:32] until the last one comes in
[2:21:34] Oh glory to God until the last one comes
[2:21:39] that's when he we walk out so Massey
[2:21:44] could not have ended this is 1963 when
[2:21:48] the Prophet was now preaching the seals
[2:21:49] he is now saying wait until we get to
[2:21:52] that half hour silent the lamp walks
[2:21:54] away what I'm saying praise God because
[2:22:00] of these answers Mel C still open he
[2:22:05] couldn't have walked away 1963 because I
[2:22:08] was not yet manifested you are not yet
[2:22:15] so messy could not go until you were in
[2:22:19] all praise be to God God had to wait and
[2:22:24] hold everything waiting for you oh
[2:22:27] that's a point praising for you hold
[2:22:32] everything waiting for me why because
[2:22:37] I'm a vessel of mercy I'm a rapture
[2:22:40] candidate things could not go ahead
[2:22:42] until we had come in but watch why were
[2:22:49] the people saying what they were saying
[2:22:51] because of the statements the Prophet
[2:22:54] had made in the breach message and the
[2:22:57] Prophet says and now where I think you
[2:23:01] get it is about the finishing of the
[2:23:03] seven church edges and the seven seals
[2:23:05] being used the seven seals is manifested
[2:23:09] what takes place what has to place the
[2:23:14] seventh church age we are at the end of
[2:23:17] the seven th church age when I say the
[2:23:19] end
[2:23:20] that doesn't mean it's this very hour
[2:23:22] this very minute so the profit is now
[2:23:27] starting to explain he goes on and he
[2:23:29] says you remember the Bible said making
[2:23:31] the times of the Lord Jesus Paul said
[2:23:33] for this time is at hand
[2:23:35] do you realize how long how long that
[2:23:38] was in God's time that was yesterday
[2:23:42] my time is been 2,000 years the time is
[2:23:46] at the end what God calls at hand is not
[2:23:49] what we call attend just keep on
[2:23:52] believing keep praying keep on God still
[2:23:55] god man see open just keep flowing into
[2:24:00] it as fast as you can or tell your
[2:24:03] neighbor flow into that messy as fast as
[2:24:05] you can don't put some breaks flow into
[2:24:08] it don't hold yourself flow into it
[2:24:11] don't wait flow into it as fast as you
[2:24:15] can
[2:24:15] God will do the stopping when it's time
[2:24:20] to stop praise be to God but he says now
[2:24:26] I think where you get it is when when I
[2:24:31] was talking about the finishing of the
[2:24:33] seven churches and the seven seals being
[2:24:36] loosed but then he dropped something
[2:24:39] here he says when I say the end that
[2:24:41] doesn't mean it's this very hour this
[2:24:44] very minute so the profit is starting to
[2:24:49] clarify something here amen but yet we
[2:24:52] know that according to what he has
[2:24:55] already said in the bridge message he
[2:24:57] said his intercessory days is over the
[2:25:03] military all days that's when the angels
[2:25:06] going to stand you wait till we get in
[2:25:08] the seals so in the time of the seals he
[2:25:14] has to walk off from the Mediterra days
[2:25:16] are you with me and that half hour
[2:25:20] silence watch what takes place in that
[2:25:23] half hour silent on that seven
[2:25:26] ceil right so see you something must
[2:25:30] happen Oh God
[2:25:34] the lamb is going to leave the
[2:25:37] intercessory wrong he's still going to
[2:25:40] change from a lamb to a lion and when
[2:25:43] does he go when does he do that in the
[2:25:46] seventh seal you wait till we get in the
[2:25:52] seals that's half our silence but yet
[2:26:01] you said when I say the end it does not
[2:26:04] mean this very hour this very minute how
[2:26:08] does this work preacher he says here we
[2:26:13] must remember that this seventh seal is
[2:26:15] the end of time of all things
[2:26:19] so the seventh seal is the end of all
[2:26:22] time of all things he says revelations
[2:26:25] 10th chapter and one two seven first
[2:26:27] time runs out the angel say time will be
[2:26:31] normal at the end of this seventh seal
[2:26:38] so when does time run out when does time
[2:26:47] run out at the end of this seventh seal
[2:26:51] so if the seventh seal has an end
[2:26:55] it means the seventh seal is a beginning
[2:27:02] now follow me now when does time run out
[2:27:07] time runs out at the end of the seventh
[2:27:10] seal
[2:27:10] if the seventh view has an end the
[2:27:13] seventh seal must have a beginning
[2:27:16] because you can't end something that
[2:27:18] never began are you with me can I get
[2:27:25] into it a little bit
[2:27:30] so we have heard a dispensation of mercy
[2:27:35] the lamb was doing his mediatorial work
[2:27:39] and there was blood on the mercy seat
[2:27:42] and that's been down through the seven
[2:27:45] th ages but this has also been a period
[2:27:47] where the sued book where the book was
[2:27:50] sealed
[2:27:53] but this coming an hour which is the
[2:27:56] time of the Seventh Seal and in the time
[2:27:59] of the Seventh Seal mercy runs out
[2:28:04] he changes to become a lion and that's
[2:28:14] what he says in the breach message are
[2:28:17] you following me so far are you
[2:28:20] following me so far so that happens when
[2:28:23] it comes now to the seventh seal time
[2:28:26] glory regard but I want you to watch
[2:28:29] something that happens we now also
[2:28:31] understand a man that in the seventh
[2:28:35] seal time it is divided the beginning of
[2:28:41] the seventh seal and the end of the
[2:28:44] seven see are you with me and time runs
[2:28:51] out we're at the end of the seventh seal
[2:28:55] not at the beginning of the seventh seal
[2:28:59] it runs out at the end of the seventh
[2:29:02] seal now what is this seventh seal that
[2:29:05] we might be able to break what is
[2:29:07] happening here glory to God in the
[2:29:10] highest the prophet of God says
[2:29:12] hallelujah Macey is still open so there
[2:29:19] is a time when Macey runs out but there
[2:29:21] is a time which is at the beginning of
[2:29:23] the seventh year mercy is still open but
[2:29:27] yet we are in the seventh seal somebody
[2:29:31] say what are you talking about preacher
[2:29:33] man what is this seven
[2:29:34] till the prophecy I heard the revelation
[2:29:37] that revealed is in a three-fold manner
[2:29:42] so the Seventh Seal is not a single
[2:29:45] event the seventh seal is in a
[2:29:49] three-fold manner and that's where many
[2:29:52] people get confused you hear all the
[2:29:54] seven theory has been revealed the seven
[2:29:56] seal has not been revealed what is the
[2:29:58] truth of it I had a revelation that
[2:30:02] revealed so the seventh seal is revealed
[2:30:07] because I had a revelation that revealed
[2:30:11] but what was the revelation that is in a
[2:30:14] three-fold mana
[2:30:19] now what is this threefold manner Paul
[2:30:22] gives us this threefold manner and he
[2:30:25] gives the threefold manner in Festus
[2:30:27] alone in chapter four for the Lord
[2:30:32] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[2:30:35] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[2:30:38] and with the Trump of God and then we
[2:30:41] which are alive and remain shall be
[2:30:43] caught up together with them in the
[2:30:45] clouds are you following me so far the
[2:30:52] Lord himself shall descend with a shout
[2:30:54] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[2:30:57] Trump of God and the Prophet says Jesus
[2:31:01] does all three of them as he is
[2:31:04] descending he does all three of them as
[2:31:12] he is descending and this is in the
[2:31:18] appearing of the Lord it is not yet the
[2:31:21] coming of the Lord Jesus is the one that
[2:31:24] is descending but as he is descending us
[2:31:27] he descends with a shout with the voice
[2:31:31] of the Archangel with the Trump of God
[2:31:34] what is the shout the shout is the
[2:31:37] message
[2:31:41] hallelujah it is the message that calls
[2:31:44] the bride what is the voice of the
[2:31:46] Archangel the voice of the Archangel it
[2:31:49] is that very same voice that goes to
[2:31:51] call a resurrection it is the same voice
[2:31:56] that went to the grave of Lazarus ah
[2:31:58] that when Lazarus was dead he so was
[2:32:02] somewhere he was gone for four days in
[2:32:05] no man had ever been known to resurrect
[2:32:07] after such a time when corruption it's
[2:32:10] eighteen God had to wait hallelujah
[2:32:14] until corruption subpoena when he
[2:32:16] arrived at the grave of Lazarus and then
[2:32:19] he screamed with a loud voice Lazarus
[2:32:21] come forth and a man that was dead he
[2:32:25] sprang back to life that was the voice
[2:32:28] of the Archangel it is the same voice
[2:32:31] that we find in Matthew chapter 27 but
[2:32:34] when he was dying on the cross he cried
[2:32:36] with a loud voice and the graves were
[2:32:39] opened and the Saints of all was seen
[2:32:43] walking on the streets it's the voice of
[2:32:45] the Archangel so the voice of the
[2:32:48] Archangel it is what will bring the
[2:32:50] resurrection of the Dead Saints those
[2:32:54] that sleep in the Lord and the Trump of
[2:32:56] God it is what gathers the bride for the
[2:33:00] marriage fists it is what caused the
[2:33:05] living Saints with the resurrected
[2:33:07] Saints and together we shall meet him in
[2:33:09] the air and we go to be with the Lord
[2:33:12] for the marriage supper that is the
[2:33:14] Trump of God are you with me but mercy
[2:33:19] is still open in this entire period when
[2:33:23] he is descending let me correct it not
[2:33:28] in this entire period in the time of the
[2:33:31] seventh seal but we want to break it
[2:33:34] down and find way messy ends and we're
[2:33:38] messy is still open let me get back to
[2:33:41] my diagram so messy is still open but
[2:33:45] this period of the seventh seal is
[2:33:47] divided into the beginning of the
[2:33:49] seven seal in the end of the seventh
[2:33:51] seal are you with me so far
[2:33:54] oh I love this message with all my heart
[2:33:57] but we also understand that the seventh
[2:34:00] seal it is the coming of the Lord which
[2:34:04] is fastest along in scepter 4:16
[2:34:06] are you with me it is the coming of the
[2:34:09] Lord
[2:34:10] but that coming of the Lord it is
[2:34:11] divided hallelujah into a shout and it
[2:34:15] is then divided into the voice of the
[2:34:18] Archangel but the first thing that we
[2:34:20] find is that there is a shout and I'm
[2:34:24] saying the shout is in the period when
[2:34:28] the mess is still open and this period
[2:34:33] is divided and at this division here
[2:34:38] that is where now the voice of the
[2:34:41] Archangel will sound it is right at this
[2:34:45] point and we know at this point this
[2:34:49] point here is 40 days before the rapture
[2:35:00] is the voice of the Archangel it will
[2:35:03] bring a resurrection of all the sleeping
[2:35:04] Saints and then those that are dead we
[2:35:08] will see them walking in the streets but
[2:35:12] at that time let him that is filled to
[2:35:14] be filthy still nobody will be saved
[2:35:18] then so you can't wait to see the Saints
[2:35:21] of old for you to say the hour has
[2:35:24] arrived because at that time
[2:35:26] Macie has ended and then the last part
[2:35:32] is the Trump of God and when does the
[2:35:35] Trump of God happen it is now the coming
[2:35:38] of the Lord Himself when we meet him in
[2:35:41] the air Jesus does all three as he is
[2:35:46] descending are you with me so the
[2:35:51] dispensation of the shout it is the
[2:35:54] discipline
[2:35:55] of where mercy is the open hallelujah
[2:36:00] it is happening in that shout why
[2:36:03] because there is a vessels of Mercy that
[2:36:07] must be called at that time and these
[2:36:10] are the ones that I'm saying these are
[2:36:12] candidates of special Messi God has
[2:36:17] predestinated them for this age are you
[2:36:21] with me God has predestinated them for
[2:36:24] this age who can give me 5 minutes 5 10
[2:36:29] 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 praise God
[2:36:34] [Applause]
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:46] special vessels of mercy and the prophet
[2:36:50] of God amen in this he says when them
[2:36:53] seals a throat open they see their name
[2:36:57] and they and the Holy Spirit speaks to
[2:36:59] that they come who is coming vessels of
[2:37:04] special mercy
[2:37:05] yes they've been vessels of mercy but
[2:37:08] there are no vessels of specialness and
[2:37:11] they are coming with the call hallelujah
[2:37:14] of the voice of the seventh seal opening
[2:37:16] and when the seals are opened they see
[2:37:20] their names these are the Eagles of God
[2:37:23] when the Eagle cries out when they
[2:37:26] recognize are not a chicken
[2:37:28] I had been in a chicken coop but this is
[2:37:31] not my destiny I came from God and going
[2:37:34] back to God and Boone for a certain
[2:37:37] power unborn for a certain season and he
[2:37:40] holds them in this age oh and when they
[2:37:44] hear their voices when they hear the
[2:37:46] sounding of the seals it is the voice of
[2:37:49] their call and when they hear that voice
[2:37:52] they come in nothing can stop them
[2:37:55] you're coming to the message was
[2:37:58] unstoppable
[2:37:59] though the devil might have fought it
[2:38:01] but it was unstoppable
[2:38:03] you did not come here by accident God
[2:38:06] called you here and because you came
[2:38:08] here by the design of God you shall make
[2:38:11] it
[2:38:12] I said you shall make it
[2:38:15] I said you shall make it in fact we have
[2:38:19] already made the grace of God will see
[2:38:23] you through praise be to God you are
[2:38:27] born for such an hour such as this is
[2:38:33] also special mess but why am i calling
[2:38:37] them vessels of special mercy because
[2:38:39] there is a message but God is always
[2:38:41] allocated messages for a specific age
[2:38:44] but why are this special because there's
[2:38:48] something special that happens in their
[2:38:50] time are you with me we have understood
[2:38:54] from the Prophet that when the seals are
[2:38:56] opened the lamb Rises amen to become a
[2:39:01] lion right and when does it take place
[2:39:03] he says at the seventh seal are you with
[2:39:09] me but yet we also understand from
[2:39:12] Revelation chapter 5 the Lion of the
[2:39:15] tribe of Judah has prevailed and yet
[2:39:20] when John looks he sees but the
[2:39:26] announcement has already been made who
[2:39:28] he has prevailed is the Lion of the
[2:39:30] tribe of Judah but when John looks he
[2:39:35] sees a lamb so putting these two verses
[2:39:39] together he is therefore a lion and a
[2:39:42] lamb at the same time because he says
[2:39:48] the lion has prevailed but when John
[2:39:51] looks he sees a lamb so he is therefore
[2:39:54] a lion and a lamb at the same time
[2:39:59] never before has he been like this he
[2:40:07] has been a land all along and the profit
[2:40:10] in the breech message he says he has
[2:40:11] done the Kinsmen work of redemption
[2:40:14] but he had not as yet claimed for his
[2:40:16] claim he had not as yet code for his
[2:40:19] claim now he comes on the scene to claim
[2:40:23] his right watch what takes place all my
[2:40:25] for which is a slave for which he was
[2:40:27] late for his becoming a kinsman redeemer
[2:40:30] two men to die in his place to redeem
[2:40:32] him but the elder was right when he said
[2:40:35] a lion see the elder called him a liar
[2:40:41] because he had been a lamb and
[2:40:43] intercessor a bloody land but now he's
[2:40:46] coming forth as a lion and the elder is
[2:40:52] right hallelujah but now we understand
[2:40:57] that yet Messi still open so he becomes
[2:41:01] both at the same time his boss
[2:41:04] hallelujah a lion and the lamb at the
[2:41:08] same time and never before has he been
[2:41:14] bought at the same time he has been a
[2:41:16] lamb here but in this period he becomes
[2:41:20] a why does he become a lion at the same
[2:41:29] time why because they are still vessels
[2:41:32] of Mercy the shout is calling vessels of
[2:41:36] massive but at this time he also has to
[2:41:39] claim his Redemption claims now when you
[2:41:43] come to claim something you don't come
[2:41:45] with you military of a lamb because the
[2:41:48] lamb is humble lamb lamb sacrifices a
[2:41:53] lamb you can do anything you want but if
[2:41:56] you want to claim
[2:41:59] you gotta become alive or glory of God
[2:42:03] he's coming for his Redemption rise and
[2:42:06] when he comes for the redemption rise
[2:42:08] he's gotta put on the face of a liar but
[2:42:12] when you wanting mercy he can't put the
[2:42:15] face of a liar
[2:42:16] he was the face of a lap so when I
[2:42:19] believe like a vessel of Mercy is the
[2:42:22] need of mercy
[2:42:23] he changes and he becomes the flam and
[2:42:26] he says come on my child let's talk it
[2:42:28] over or they say I'm condemned he says
[2:42:31] come on they still blood on the mast you
[2:42:33] say let's settle your issue and the
[2:42:35] child of Mercy sells but Lord the devil
[2:42:37] has done this then he changes his face
[2:42:41] [Applause]
[2:43:06] and then he puts on the he comes in
[2:43:11] behind you but why does he become blood
[2:43:57] because he understands mistakes can be
[2:44:01] made we shall always make mistakes and
[2:44:04] if we make a mistake
[2:44:06] thank God there is blood thank God there
[2:44:09] is blood don't stay in your mistake
[2:44:12] don't stay down rise up a few mercy on
[2:44:19] the mercy seat but you that wants a
[2:44:21] Redemption cleaner go with your face a
[2:44:24] manner and your chest stuck out and say
[2:44:28] I got the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:44:30] hallelujah
[2:44:31] why does he become both because he still
[2:44:35] has to serve and the prophet of God says
[2:44:38] Redemption is in two parts it's a source
[2:44:42] of power he's got to save you physically
[2:44:46] but he's gotta save you feel spiritually
[2:44:48] so the save you spiritually in
[2:44:54] [Music]
[2:44:55] [Applause]
[2:45:04] and it says she was healed because it
[2:45:17] was our to claim the healing of the the
[2:45:56] Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[2:45:59] not he shall prevail
[2:46:01] he has already overcome let me say to
[2:46:05] you your problem was already overcome
[2:46:07] your situation was already overcome the
[2:46:10] victory was already pronounced all you
[2:46:13] gotta do is open your eyes to see what

[2:46:17] Joan was weeping but the Prophet says
[2:46:20] his weeping did not last just but for a
[2:46:23] minute they stood one of the elders say

[3:11:15] and she was standing here in the gap for
[3:11:18] her brother and as she was standing here
[3:11:22] for her brother he had a cyst on his
[3:11:25] hand and the doctors had operated on

[3:11:30] you know sorted out but the sis returned
[3:11:33] to Kim and they were preparing for a

[3:11:55] that I'm doing it caused the cyst to go
[3:11:58] away you know I think it's because of
[3:12:00] the job that I'm doing it and she said
[3:12:02] oh that's so good
[3:12:04] she said but I want you to know that we
[3:12:06] had a prayer line and I stood
[3:12:09] in the capsule

[3:12:15] but the sister came to church this
[3:12:17] morning to give God praise and to
[3:12:19] confirm that it was God he allowed by

[3:18:28] DC and I just began to pray on the phone
[3:18:31] and I was praying a very special prayer

[3:18:35] things in our life to try to get our
[3:18:38] attention
