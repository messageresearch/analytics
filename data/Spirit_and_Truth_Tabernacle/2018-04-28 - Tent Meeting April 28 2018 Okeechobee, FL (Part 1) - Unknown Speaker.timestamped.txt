[13:11] there's people walking by and driving by
[13:15] Andy Jesus right 23:16
[13:20] oh yeah regard to love the world that He
[13:23] gave His only begotten Son
[13:26] why so may you may may or may not know
[13:37] I'm again here and we've have sound
[13:39] bibles and there was a gentleman at the
[13:42] Palm Beach County Fair a couple years
[13:43] ago and that gentleman came by his loss
[13:46] it looked like he was wondering he had
[13:49] no no pumps no purpose so I said no him
[13:54] I said you know what's happening because
[13:56] God gave me a word of wisdom that says
[13:57] this gentleman is having a problem his
[14:00] future is going to be muddled with
[14:02] disaster so he came up to my booth and
[14:05] he was the beer in hand and tears coming
[14:08] down and I said when we started talking
[14:10] he lost his best friend
[14:12] he felt lost I said you know what I'm
[14:14] going to introduce you to you that's
[14:15] true when I introduce you to Jesus
[14:19] because Jesus loved you so much that he
[14:22] died for you I am at the scriptural
[14:25] verse they used they discussed with him
[14:27] was found in John chapter 3 verses 16
[14:32] and 17
[14:32] you see Jesus says I didn't come in the
[14:38] world to condemn the world you see he
[14:40] thought get down he found everything
[14:42] crashing down upon him he felt lost and
[14:46] abandoned but what happened Jesus came
[14:48] to save the walk right
[14:51] 19:10 for the Son of Man is come to seek
[14:54] and the safe which was what is lost to
[14:58] me was how to save him not a messiah
[15:02] spending eternity in the lake of fire
[15:06] after the great white throne judgment
[15:08] pagination that right after the
[15:12] tribulation and that to a child to go
[15:14] out there and win souls I see there was
[15:18] a gentleman who was on death row and
[15:20] Chad and he was asking around he said to
[15:23] the fellow prison how do I get to him
[15:26] you know nobody knew
[15:28] so then they said to prison guards
[15:32] nobody know it but he was working in
[15:36] honor so then he went to the prison
[15:39] staff they didn't know but a group of
[15:41] idiots went in there they gave him the
[15:43] answer and they said to us you there's a
[15:46] wonderful plan right he cares for you
[15:49] he died for you he wants to repair that
[15:52] relationship with you because it was
[15:55] broken by sin because
[15:57] she won't sit at lunch with 43 we have
[16:04] for the wages of sin is death Romans
[16:07] Romans 8:1 for therefore there's no
[16:10] condemnation those are questions okay so
[16:13] we have to go out there and win slams
[16:15] because we can't take can we take this
[16:18] one another cell phone we can't take
[16:21] with us our credit cards or a bank
[16:25] statements our high Ras our gold or
[16:27] silver we can only take with us oils
[16:29] because the apex of all Christian
[16:32] endeavor is to place the two of us
[16:34] orphans ground in order that the Lamb
[16:36] that was slain may receive the reward of
[16:38] his suffering he suffered from everybody
[16:42] and God gave us the Great Commission
[16:46] which we can work together like this you
[16:49] know we're a team
[16:51] what are we to do go out there and
[16:52] spread the good news we have to do that
[16:56] because we're in the end times and Jesus
[16:58] may come because of the tween we may be
[17:00] changed caught up to meet so you never
[17:06] be in the word the dead in Christ shall
[17:08] rise first then we who remain some two
[17:11] are and we have to take Swoopes with us
[17:14] and that's the whole point
[17:16] taking songs going out there and
[17:19] spreading that this is the God to watch
[17:21] the dying look you say I can't you can't
[17:24] yeah that's Satan I rebuke Satan leading
[17:27] you to believe you can do that right
[17:30] because remember 120 nampara
[17:34] what did Jesus say
[17:35] he shall receive power stay there stay
[17:38] there and wait wait wait wait wait on
[17:42] God is always a producer of good things
[17:44] it's when we don'twe don't God what
[17:46] happens live Abraham and Ishmael we see
[17:49] today the effects of Abraham as he ran
[17:51] away he was actually April and survived
[17:54] yeah we see that happening today in the
[17:57] Middle East equations over there because
[17:59] of what rushing God we don't rush God we
[18:02] long suffer because you know what good
[18:05] things happen to those who wait on the
[18:07] Lord that is very much so
[18:09] officially people who lead by here West
[18:11] Palm Beach I saw some from Sarasota
[18:13] what's your mission souls and that's
[18:16] what we didn't do we go out there and we
[18:18] gave out ready for this 93 million
[18:21] Testaments
[18:23] I tell everybody if you if you buy a box
[18:27] of Gideon Testaments that I have I'll go
[18:29] out with hooded Souls if my wife or you
[18:31] should tell you one action actually that
[18:33] time that pastor pastor Jack we're at
[18:35] the rubbage County Fair going up there
[18:37] so wedding if I can do it because he
[18:42] that is in you is greater the he's the
[18:45] work first one for before Deborah then
[18:48] who is in you go honk attention that's
[18:52] Hebrew wouldn't you tell from the
[18:55] completed you you can't tell him this
[18:57] knows he's here
[19:01] I just got rabbi if I can do it you can
[19:07] do it because that same Jesus that same
[19:10] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[19:11] is in oxide deposited in us there's Holy
[19:17] Spirit to empower us to win smooth
[19:27] because God's gonna deposit if we
[19:30] surrender wrong to him
[19:32] this is the great awakened that
[19:33] preaching and other churches I've been
[19:35] preached on Nautilus opinion-based one
[19:38] another churches might listen to concept
[19:41] and that's his nature and he will
[19:45] communicate with his nature that even
[19:47] provides them enough if we willingly
[19:48] surrender to him and in order to be on
[19:52] fire for Jesus we kind of yield we have
[19:54] the yield is you know what do we do
[19:57] what's gonna we're gonna be filled with
[20:00] love that's good isn't it your way peace
[20:03] patience kindness goodness faithfulness
[20:06] gentleness and something better
[20:11] how many people like fear like their
[20:13] what is fear false evidence appears real
[20:16] I like joy if I believe I'm going to be
[20:21] delivered whatever my trial whatever
[20:23] every circumstance what you guys say in
[20:24] James chapter one gets in her career
[20:26] choice my brother ladies good job to me

[20:42] crucify the flesh every day
[20:44] let's go out there renew our money time
[20:47] Rheda my glass and that's a week it is
[20:50] do we furnished a tired woman items so
[20:54] people can read God's worth other
[20:56] ministries just give out a track weaken

[58:05] op much like that a fella in the
[58:10] scripture dead that Good Samaritan
[58:12] started out real well running this race
[58:16] with everything that was in me but along
[58:20] the way something happened along the way
[58:25] of soldier got wounded and the devil
[58:29] crapine those two robbers came in and
[58:34] stole my joy and stole my testimony but
[58:39] I'm reminded of a song I'd like to
[58:42] always see after between
[58:51] [Applause]
[59:00] since your feedback or ought to speak
[59:04] and I'm just so late
[59:07] Amen because let me tell you Satan
[59:12] decides to destroy each and every one of
[59:16] them he is angry he'll want to see the
[59:20] wheel in the plan of God coming to
[59:23] fruition so he's always constantly
[59:26] throwing got some discrepancy in
[59:30] different things that trying to take us
[59:34] off of our courts God used to say you
[59:45] can't look to the man to the left
[59:47] those are mad - right there you gotta
[59:50] keep your eye on that brush and British
[59:57] military Oh war they would have a meet
[1:00:01] and I wanna come up and hold a frame and
[1:00:05] then he would carry a flag and as long
[1:00:09] as they see that fire moving they know
[1:00:12] they still have the victory but they
[1:00:14] will say if this mansion fall
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:01:04] [Music]
[1:01:07] Oh
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:37] [Applause]
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:58] despite fire is energy yeah it is energy
[1:02:03] being released into the air we can take
[1:02:07] that energy source
[1:02:15] [Applause]
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:02:59] I'm just gonna give a little short
[1:03:01] version it's a long testimony but I go
[1:03:04] peepee on it just to show you the
[1:03:07] goodness of God and just to encourage
[1:03:11] you that whatever you go regardless of
[1:03:14] what it is we start with God yet
[1:03:17] we start with God that's right I guess I
[1:03:25] could say I was maybe about two years
[1:03:28] ago I'm a standard doctor a hematologist
[1:03:30] my blood work was crazy and they
[1:03:34] couldn't figure out what was wrong with
[1:03:35] me so I was going back and forth they
[1:03:36] were running all kinds of tests all
[1:03:37] kinds of tests but not figure out what
[1:03:39] what was wrong it's just that where your
[1:03:42] immune system is fighting something but
[1:03:43] can't find it don't know what it is and
[1:03:45] I seen this man for like every week for
[1:03:47] almost a year and January service we had
[1:03:51] lumineer service I remember standing in
[1:03:53] the church and I said you know god I'm
[1:03:55] so sick of it all there's doctors
[1:03:57] appointments I said I'm done I'm just
[1:03:59] done
[1:04:00] I'm not going back anymore I'm finished
[1:04:02] that was January of last year and I
[1:04:06] didn't go back for violence six months
[1:04:08] or so pass by and then come June I
[1:04:11] noticed along coming up in the top of my
[1:04:15] head so I just kind of ignored it
[1:04:18] after a while know what this is I'm just
[1:04:21] two to three weeks has died and it just
[1:04:24] kept getting bigger and bigger then I
[1:04:26] kind of got a little nervous I so I said
[1:04:29] well I won't take a picture of it and
[1:04:30] I'm gonna send it to my sister who's the
[1:04:32] doctor and I'm going to see what she's
[1:04:34] saying she think I should do so I took a
