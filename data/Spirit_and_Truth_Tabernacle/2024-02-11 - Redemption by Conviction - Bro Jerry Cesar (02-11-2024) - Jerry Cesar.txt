said Lord here am I so we want to thank God for his word we want to thank God for what he's been doing in in the midst of his Saints and most importantly we want to we want to invite him in our midst this morning we want to thank him because he's already here is that right praise God now throughout the week I was thinking it's it's been about five years or so since I've been before you all on the Sunday morning and uh you know I just I was just thinking about that and I realize that it's it's a real honor and privilege uh to be able to break the bread of of life to you all so without delay we may stand up and we'll go ahead and read the scripture praise God God we want to turn our Bibles this morning to Matthew 27 and we'll read the first 11 verses there and just say Amen when you're there praise God Matthew 27 amen and it reads when the morning was come all the chief priests and Elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and Elders saying I have sinned and that I have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see that thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and when he hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put the uh them into the treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and brought with the with them the Potter field to bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet saying and they took the 30 pieces of silver the price of him that was was valued whom they of the children of Israel did value and gave them for The Potter's field as the Lord appointed me and Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked saying art thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him thou sayest let us pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're honored to be here this morning to honor your Resurrection Lord for Lord God you Rose on the third day father and you said those words that it is finished and you settled it at that moment Lord and when know father when you speak your word Lord God it must come to pass and father God you have ordained this day Lord that we would gather together father you have promised where we would be gathered Lord you would be in the midst God I pray that you would speak to the hearts of your people father God lord father I pray you would circumcise the hearts of your people Lord that God they would leave here father God uh edified Lord God with a revelation of Father God of who they are oh God and what's been given to them in this hour oh Father God and Lord God we know there's many needs to this morning Father God Lord God we know our precious sister Melissa reached out father we ask that you would remember her this morning Father Lord grant her her desire to be in service Lord where she belongs oh God so father God we rebuke the enemy Lord God and ask that you would provide her a speedily recovery oh God and Lord we pray for sister to Capas father God that you would continue to strengthen her body oh Lord that she would oh Father be here rejoicing once more with us oh God and Lord we just commit every need to you Lord God we know in your presence there's healing in your presence there's Deliverance in your presence there is peace oh Father God we thank you and we invite you in our midst this morning we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen am praise the Lord you may have your seats may the Lord add a blessing to his reading uh there's another scripture I want to read as well uh Matthew 24 verse 24 Matthew 24 verse 24 praise God and it reads for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect praise the Lord and if I could use as a title this morning it would be Redemption by conviction and as a subtitle I want to use the very elect praise God the very elect now going back to Matthew 27 that first verse right it says when the morning was come and I like that because you see the morning is a person right when the morning was come the people in those days didn't realize who was among them it was a glorious day right the scripture says weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning is that right you see when the morning was come it says all the chief priests and Elders of the people took counsel against him to put him to death these are the religious leaders that uh rather than taking heed to the voice of God they were taking heed to the voice of their Traditions you see now what I find interesting here is you know Judas got to a place where he realized he shed innocent blood he realized that he he he did something that he he he had great regrets for you see and when conviction occurs repentance always follows but when conviction is rejected then the repentance is made void and that's what happened to Judas you see he felt that conviction but there was nothing in him that could restore him back from his repentance you see restoration only applies to those that have something to be restored back to and I know our pastor has been carrying on this thought of restoration so I'm just going to take a few pointers this morning if that's all right you see repentance is a gift only until true conviction is gone and I encourage anyone that whenever you have that opportunity to repent make it right you see make it right now restoration takes place beyond any fruits you might produce in your life you see and I think very interestingly you'll find yourself going through life's journey bearing many fruits and I want you to keep in mind that God never spoke fruits into existence he spoke seeds you see now with that in mind you bear fruit based on what seed you identify with is that right so it's important to identify with the right seed because there's a true seed of God and then there's a false seed of God you see that's why the scripture says if it were possible it would deceive the very elect and I trust I'm speaking to the very elect this morning Hallelujah the prophet says this in a message the serian church age he says hold this carefully in mind now take this next step redeem means to buy back it restores the original to the original owner God by his death the shed blood brought back his own now I want you to keep that in mind I'm going to read that again it says God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride he brought back the spoken word seed bride now if he brought back the spoken word seed bride that means the spoken word isn't just an attribute of the Bride it isn't just a possession of the Bride it is the bride you are a very spoken word of God amen amen now the prophet says that the life is in the blood and the blood is the bride so I believe it's time Church to realize that you are Supernatural people living in an Earthly condition amen now the prophet goes on he says the blood speaks did we say does the blood speak can it speak says yes sir he says the voice of the blood of Abel cried out against Cain we find out in Hebrews 12:24 that the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speak it's the life that's in the blood that does the speaking the soul that was in Abel cried out was the life that was in Christ cries out a better thing it speaks it speaks loud it's the holy spirit amen and I believe the the very elect this morning has been called to a very special purpose amen there's a promise that lays in the roots of the the elect this morning and it's and I and I our brother's been preaching on this and one of the things to keep in mind is many times we'll waiting for the promises of God to be fulfilled we're waiting for God's promises to come to pass in our lives right we look at the word and we we we claim it as our own but a lot of times the promis of God is waiting for you you you're not waiting for the promise the promise is waiting for you for you to get in position for you to get into step amen now when we understand that then we can get into step the prophet says here whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into a fruit this very quote this was a a time where the angel spoke to the prophet of God and says pick up your pen and write it goes on to say the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed the spoken word because it is the same seed and these last days the true bride Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be United with him they will be one what a condition church this is where we ought to be just before the Rapture you see we are that super church we are that super race you see so whatever need there is that comes upon you it's time to speak to that need this morning it's time to Speak Life to it amen now the prophet had many VIs ISS and a lot of times in his Visions um the prophet had to had to wait until certain things were in position for that Vision to come to pass amen now he he the smallest thing could be out of place but he had to wait for it you see and a lot of times when we find ourselves in the word of God right there are certain things that need to be in place before it can come to pass it need to be in the right season for it to come to pass amen now want to turn to John chapter 12 here this is a time where Christ was doing great Miracles before the people and there was a great need there was this man that had died and he was in the grave for a few days you see and when he got to the crowd there was an expectation because Christ was there now verse 17 it says the people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead bear record for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle now after Christ had done this miracle there was a Fame about him that there there were certain Greeks however that came and that says you know we we want to see this Christ s we can we would like to see Christ we would like to see this man you see but when Christ was there Christ had the opportunity to reveal himself to those to the Greeks he had the opportunity to let them know that I am he right but there's response was in verse 20 24 he says verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit you see Christ didn't point to himself he pointed to the word he pointed to the very substance that could reproduce more fruit you see and when when you when you recognize that you find these Greeks they were they were looking at a man you see because there was a situation where Christ had need to stop by a certain place to speak to a certain woman you see and with this woman she she she when she was there it was a Samaritan woman she her response was our fathers worshiped in this mountain she says I know the Messiah cometh you see which is called Christ when he come he will tell us thing these things you see but this Samaritan woman she wasn't just looking at a man she was looking at a promise you see and the promise was already there waiting for her she was wait she thought she might have been waiting for the promise to come to pass but the promise was waiting for her and she says I the the Christ said I am he that speaketh to thee you see she was looking at a promise so the promise could be made revealed and anytime there's a conviction or expectation for God's word God's obligated to reveal it to you amen another scene we we just read it with with Pontius Pilate he asked Christ are thou the king of the Jews and Jesus said to him thou sayest you see same scene but two different results are you looking at a man or are you looking at the promise of God are you looking at what God spoke in this day you see the Promise always lies on the other side the three Hebrew boys had to enter into a fire but there was a promise on the other side that he would show up you see non had a condition in his body you see but he was given a promise that was waiting for him on the other side he had to dip himself in that River seven times before he can receive healing I encourage you this morning that whatever you have need of it's already waiting for you on the other side praise God amen amen feel like brother smiling I'm starting to feel good praise the Lord now now I can get to my real message amen now Redemption by conviction conviction means means a firmly held belief or opinion the quality of showing that one is firmly convinced or what one says or believes that's what conviction means now conviction is absolutely necessary for your journey as a Christian it's necessary when you're on offense and when you're on defense the absence of conviction will cause you to be complacent that's how important conviction is you see now if we turn to Matthew 15 what find somebody that showed us an example of what conviction looks like praise the Lord Matthew 15:21 now it reads then Jesus went then and departed into the coast of Tyrie and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil now this was a mother's cry for her daughter you see and I want you to notice this this this woman here this sof phenician woman was a gentile so she had no claims on Christ as the son of David right but that's that's what she she heard she was around she she knew all the people regarded him as son of David Son of David have mercy on me now it goes on to say but he answered her not a word now how many time has the Lord answered you not a word to your prayers what do you do in these situations you have a need you're desperate and the Lord answers you not a word let us keep going do you cease from praying now it goes on to say his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us even his disciples wanted to send her away but he answered and said I am not sent unto the lost sheep of of the House of is I'm not sent unto the lost sheep but to the house of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me you see look look at her approach her approach was I've been asking for this I'm in desperation I've exhausted all my resources but she says Lord help me so worship will change your atmosphere worship will allow you to enter into a different playing field where you can expect something from God but he a verse 26 but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs see not only did he not respond when she when when when she first asked but now he calls her a dog it's not meat for me to cast a children's bread and feed it to dogs you see now what would your reaction be if God calls you a dog you see now it goes on to say she said truth Lord this was her conviction see she was willing to to to let Christ in every door of her life the door of her Pride right the the the door of her temperament every door of her life she was willing to let Christ in so he could bring correct you see she says truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table so she knew that even the crumbs was sufficient enough to meet her need you see little is much when God is in it verse 28 then Jesus answered her said who oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour so church I encourage you if you have a need this morning what is your approach what is your mindset are you expecting something from God because this this woman here she received a two-fold reward she was commended of her great faith faith and her daughter was healed at that very moment you see she took the lowliest place but her faith in Christ earned her the highest praise her faith was tested by his silence but her faith was recognized by her conviction she says truth Lord praise the Lord amen and I'd like to just add this as well although she was a gentile by birth she became a spiritual Israelite because of her faith and that's that's the same faith that it requires of us today the faith to continue to persevere through any situation you see we are not the Royal seed by a of the royal Seed of Abraham by flesh we are the Royal Seed of Abraham by faith you see when you have that Faith then you can start contending for what's yours for what belongs to you praise the Lord Galatians 3 says know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham praise the lord we want to also turn here to Matthew 8 we see another example example here of one's great desperation call God on the scene Matthew 8 verse 5 it says when Jesus was entered into capernium there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lith at home sick of the py grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered answered and says Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed see he believed that at the very spoken word whatever KN he had would come to pass there is power in the spoken word Saints the spoken word is your possession this morning I've said it before you are the spoken word praise God John chapter n verse three in this scene here we see we see a blind man a blind man that was born in that condition by birth and you know they asked Christ what did this man do that he was blind and Christ says he did nothing but he is blind so that the works of God could be made manifest amen now Jesus told him to go wash in the pool of salom which is interpreted sent he went in his way therefore and wash and he came back seeing now this very scene created a lot of contention among the people because there were religious leaders in those days that had different things to say about what happened right in verse 26 it says then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he Thine Eyes he answered answer them I have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would you hear it again will ye also be his disciples now this man is now testifying and witnessing to these religious leaders you see verse 28 says then they reviled him and says Thou Art his disciples but we are Moses disciples we know that God spake unto Moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is the man answered and said unto him why herein is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners you see now he's not he he's recognizing what had happened to him and he knows that there's got to be a something wrong here either with my experience or your experience and sometimes you're going to come across people that had certain experiences but with no substance we're going to get into that a little later now this man was talking from a convicted heart anytime you have a conviction like that it will lead you to the path of righteousness you see it goes on to say verse 31 now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth His will him he heareth you see now since the word began was it not heard that any man Open the Eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing this man's conviction made him a witness unto unto those people in those days and uh verse 34 says they answered unto him thou was altogether born in sins and thou th and dust thou teach us and they cast him out now they got real offended because they realize that this man that was born in sin that that that that was out of the temple is now teaching us you see and they cast him out the scripture says and I want you to know that the enemy's report is not for you we're going to find that in the next verse you see the relig these religious leaders lacked Revelation and the absence of Revelation in in in your life will cause you to follow a word with no substance they were following a word but it was a word out of season they were in Moses day but it was a new day praise the Lord and you see verse 35 it says Jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dust thou believe on the Son of God and he answered and says who is he Lord that I might believe on him and Jesus says Thou Hast both seen him and he it is that talketh with thee and he said Lord I believe and he worshiped him you see so the real ones that was cast out of the temple was not this blind man it was those religious leaders you see and there's a clear difference between what's true and what's false see a lot of times if I could use this as an example if you're going to this uh Bakery uh maybe you're shopping for a wedding cake right and you're looking on the Shelf the first thing that catches your attention is the icing on that cake the icing got to be right if there's a cake on one of those counters that don't have the the the right decoration with the icing you won't be drawn to it you see uh uh uh but but but that cake has just enough icing to draw you to to to to make it more appealing you see and and and that's the difference between the false and the true is that the false church right it's like they it's like that icing they they have enough to to draw you to them they have the big crowds they have the they have all these great things right but is there any substance in that cake you see is there any substance in that cake in fact I heard his preacher say this one time too much icing will make you sick if you have too much icing right you won't be able to really digest it as well right but you need that substance you can see that cake but what's inside of it that's what makes the difference and what's inside of the true is the word of God that's it yes sir heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not praise the Lord now we want to continue here praise God in 1st Samuel chapter 30 want to just read a f a few verses there amen praise God and as you go to that I just thought it was very interesting that this blind man he was never able to to see anything he was born in as a blind man never able to see anything but yet in the presence of God he became the light of that day you see he saw Darkness all of his life but he was the very light of his day in 1st Samuel chapter 30 it goes on to say and it came to pass when David and his men will come to zlac on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and ziklag and Smitt and z lag and burned it with fire and had taken the woman captives that they that they're therein they SL not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way verse three so David and his men come to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep what a condition see they come back from Battle and realize that their cap has been invaded the enemy has taken their people captive the woman the children and David now is on the hot seat he's on a hot seat now no doubt David and his men felt like failures because they were the Shepherds to watch over those people now it goes on to say in verse 5 and David to David's two wives were taken captive the aino the jelit and Abigail the wife of nabal the Carmelite and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people were grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God oh praise the Lord Church you ever want to confuse the enemy encourage yourself encourage with the word of God you see praise the Lord now the way to encourage yourself is to REM remember what God has done for you when you remember what God has done for you you'll realize he can do it again and again and again because he's the same yesterday today and forever you see the children of Israel I'm reminded were compassed around the same Mountain for 40 years but they were only about 40 days away from the promised land see they felt to remind themselves of what God had already done they couldn't encourage themselves in the Lord praise God verse 7 says and David said to abur the priest ahc son I pray thee bring me hither the epod and abur brought thither the epod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop shall I overtake them in other words David is saying shall I go on the offensive side for a moment see I know I fell defensively cuz I shouldn't have not even allowed my my people to be taken captive but can I go on the offensive side and the scripture goes on to say shall I overtake them and he answered them pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all full restoration that's right now if you have that this morning I say claim it because it belongs to you is that right there's some things that you're going to have to speak to life this season Church don't retreat pursue you see that's what was given David was given the authority to pursue to take back everything the enemy has taken from him is that right I encourage you Church Pursuit praise the Lord the prophet says in the seran Church age says now comes our Triumph Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost Galatians 4:4 through 7 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that he might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father now the prophet goes on to say he did not make us Sons for we were already Sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as Sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and he hear this and because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby you cry father father and it goes on to say what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard this word and baptize you in water as an answer of a good conscience towards God praise the Lord now when you are redeemed son and daughter of God you won't live any kind of way you'll be convicted when you're alone you'll be convicted even when you're in public because there is a a a expectation in a a calling in your life to represent God in every manner in every aspect is that right you know Eve when she ate of the fruit if we could just go in the beginning for a moment she gave to Adam and he also ate and God came on the scene I want you to notice that God didn't restore them to no fruits God started the process of restoration with seeds he said I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed he started the process of restoration with seeds so church I think it's time to identify with the true seed of God is that right because if that seed is in you right the prophet says a sheep won't manufacture wool it Bears wool right so bear the fruits of the spirit of God that's already in you praise God hallelujah amen [Applause] Satan can impersonate God in every way the one thing he can impersonate God is the spoken word he cannot impersonate the spoken word because the spoken word speaks life and that's the authority you've been given that's the power you have over the devil it's to speak to it and it must obey church I say speak this afternoon praise the Lord hallu the Prophet says in the per pergan Church age he says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still which means even when you don't understand it you will not be deceived they know that it is the it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through his bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time praise the Lord you have been called for this specific time to be one with Christ Jesus to do the very work of his ministry to resemble his word and to be that word now Prophet says here the same message says then in the latter rain will come a Mount Carmel Showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will SW for the latter Rain Jesus will be the showdown between the denom ations and Creeds for he will come back he will come to back up his word and to take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion praise God I believe we all heard songs of Zion this morning you have been called to Mount Zion and a few things about Mount Zion it is a city that is located on the Southwestern most and highest hills on the higher and more ancient part of Jerusalem you see Mount Zion is also referred to as the entire city or the Holiness of God and another thing here it's refers figuratively to Israel as the people of God and we believe and know that you are the spiritual Israel you are the spiritual Israel of the word of God and Psalms chapter 65 it says praise with it praise W it for thee Oh God in Zion and unto thee shall be the vow to be performed oh thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall All Flesh come iniquities Prevail against me as for our transgressions Thou shalt purge them away blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causeth to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy Holy Temple praise God Psalms 87 it reads his foundation is in the Holy mountains the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob glorious things are spoken of thee Oh city of God Salah Romans 11 verse 26 it says and so Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the the deliverer and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob for for this is my Covenant when I shall take away their sins and this is concerning the gospel which was blind that blinded Israel for the elect's sake verse 2 28 says as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake for gifts and callings are without repentance for as ye in times past have not believed yet have now obtained Mercy though through their unbelief even so have these also now have not believed that through your mercy they may also obtain Mercy praise God Hebrews chap 12 verse 22 it reads but ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the angel assembly and to the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things that of Abel praise God and I just want to read one more scripture here concerning Zion Isaiah 62 verse one it reads for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all Kings of thy glory and that Thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name Thou shalt also be crowned of Glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal deom in the hand of thy God Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate but if Thou shalt be called H hesah and thy land buah for the Lord delighted in thee and thy land shall be married amen you are spiritual Jerusalem this morning and Zion is the hill that sets upon Jerusalem that great City and you are Zion is that right now in closing just want to read this scripture in mark 13:35 it reads watch ye therefore for ye know not when the Master of the House cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning lest suddenly he come and he finds you sleeping and what I say unto you I say unto you all watch church I encourage you this morning to watch watch therefore and be filled with the Holy Spirit be sealed with the holy spirit of God see Elijah Elisha had to watch Elijah steadfastly so that he could receive a double portion of his spirit so I say watch unto the Lord l so that you can receive a double portion this season the Morning Has Come and the evening light is here the morning is a person and the evening is that same person Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord God bless you [Applause] all let us bow a quick word of prayer Lord Jesus father we thank you for your grace Lord and your mercy we thank you Lord for the
