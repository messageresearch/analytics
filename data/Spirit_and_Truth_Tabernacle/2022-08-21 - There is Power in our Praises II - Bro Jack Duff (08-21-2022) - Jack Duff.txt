were in a uh they were in a kiwanis club or something like that and it says it's good to be in the house of the lord and uh and and they said well you might not call this the house of lord because this is kiwanis club he said but anywhere the church is gathered it becomes the house of the lord so if we were gathering in your house it would still be the house of the law so it's good to be in the house of the lord amen we thank god for all things i wanted to welcome jennifer and aria johnson amen jennifer okay no problem we'll get a little bit later praise the lord it's good to have them and also um brother greg and sister kerry chalmers amen good to have them with the same amen this morning praise the lord amen we i believe i remember that name from uh to heaven to whom and good to see see them again they made a service this morning uh for those that are watching online i was actually just also streaming a little bit just to see what things look like and it's just a much better uh much better it's i would say like this is it's more appealing to the eye uh than having all those words behind you and what in the world are they writing on that book it ain't all bored you know and we just here we we pilgrims just passing through and uh you know that's just part of our journey amen is part of our story but uh but we know god is not finished with his book yet amen so we're just gonna enjoy this chapter amen that the lord has us in right now so we thank god for all things appreciate the specials amen that have gone forth this morning [Music] praise the lord amen and encouragement from our deacon amen we certainly thank god amen for the tender hannah jehovah just leading his people praise the lord so let's uh let's get our bibles and i i will just go into the scripture thank you musicians certainly certainly appreciate you all um we will go back to um scripture that we read last week and and there was particular part that i was trying to get to but uh i like it when the holy ghost come and just take over uh the service that that that's what we want him to do is just have his way uh in our midst and uh this morning we will just again just keep uh plugging away and see where the lord would take us uh but uh acts 16 is uh where we are bringing our thought from and uh verse six through nine is um actually i think it should be six through eleven i'll read um since this now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia um after they were come to myself they are saved to go into bethenny but the spirit suffered them not and i think this is very very important we need to we need to know what god is leading us to do and what he's not leading us to do sometimes we lead ourselves and then we expect god to back it up amen uh you have to question who is the leader is it you a god amen uh uh we we follow him as he leads us and uh here we see paul just trying to go in one direction and god is blocking it and you know but he he he he's sensitive enough to realize this ain't the will of the lord so you have to stop sometime glory to god amen and first verse 9 says and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them therefore loosing from trois we came with a straight course to samathra shia and the next day to neapolis amen we'll leave our reading there let's just bow in a brief word of prayer lord jesus we uh thank you for the privilege to read the word but we know the holy ghost is uh trying to get something to our attention so lord help us to hear what the spirit is speaking thank you for each one that have gathered here in this place today to uh to worship you thank you for the the wonderful song service amen and uh the the specials that have gone forth the word of encouragement lord jesus and how we just appreciate what you are doing in our midst uh we're we're we're thankful amen we honor we honor you we adore you we praise you because you're good and you're god amen and and uh and lord there's nothing that catches you by surprise so uh we uh we have learned to acknowledge that all things work together uh for the good to them that love god and to them who are the call according to his purpose so let your will and your purpose be done uh in us and we pray that you take control of this portion of the service be glorified be magnified be exalted uh here in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated praise the lord we are going back to our subject of there is power in our praises amen there there is power in our praises um we were bringing you know um last week just this definition that i i pulled out of the just some bible software that i have called aluminum and i was just looking up the definition of the word praise and they were they they had a question what is praise what is praise and um one of the things that said praise is giving thanks to god for who he is amen giving thanks to god for for who he is he he's a provider he's a waymaker he's he's my health he's my strength right he's my encouragement amen i mean he he he he promised never leave me no forsake me so he's uh he's uh jehovah jireh my provider my protector some of y'all almost got an accident this week but god protected you it shows you who he is hey man i don't know if you've ever been that close to an accident where you couldn't pray anybody been that close but they just couldn't pray but uh there's only one thing you can do you can just say jesus and and the good thing about he is an ever-present help in the time of trouble right no no matter what you're going through you're just jesus and it and for some reason there's a peace that comes over you right i mean there's things just the atmosphere changes when you just call his name hallelujah i thank god we serve a god that is not dead he's still alive and he's still moving in the midst of his people so we praise god we give thanks to god for who he is hey and i like the word who he is not who he was because if that's what he was then that's what he also still is amen amen uh they said praise is a spiritual offering and uh oftentimes you don't feel like giving god praise sometimes you get so wore down by life you just don't feel like opening your mouth to give praise but praise is a spiritual offering amen we have to learn to give god praise in the midst of whatever we're going through amen another thing they say here's praise is focusing our heart on god amen and this is where we got uh caught up here because uh they talked about the last five psalms of of of psalms um the book of psalms and uh psalms 146 through 50 just feel with praise that each praise i mean each chapter began and ends with praise the lord and they show us where why and how to praise god amen what does praise do they have this question what does praise do first praise takes our mind off our problems amen praise takes our mind off our shortcomings amen and praise focuses them on god amen is that praise leads us from individual meditation to corporate worship glory to god and and what i what i found out about that is when when you begin to praise especially when it goes when it enters uh corporate worship because most most people just um that you know it god just began to deal with it was like a a slow boiler and uh and they just begin to think about this then they begin to think about that let me think about how god did god did this and how god did that and next time i just thank you lord hallelujah glory to god you know and you just start hearing all these things and you know and and some some people now they used to get quicken [Applause] some people you hey you know them got quick and they don't thought about something that the lord did for them and they got quickened and next thing you know they begin to worship and and when you hear them bubbling up over on this side somebody else on that side begin to get it get contagious and the whole congregation just began to praise god [Applause] it leads us from individual meditation to corporate worship praise causes us to consider and appreciate god's character and another thing it says praise lifts our perspective from earthly to the heavenly thank god praise is my weapon hallelujah hallelujah another thing they say about praise praise is thanking god for his many gracious gifts and and i love this one they said david's praise focus on god's glorious deeds it is easy to complain about life but david's list gives us plenty for which to to praise god he forgives our sins all right david said he heals our diseases that's something to praise him for he redeems us from death he crowns us with love and compassion he satisfies our desires and he gives righteousness and justice see we we receive all these without deserving any of them that's why we praise them so so no matter how difficult your life's journey you can always count your blessings and i love this they said counter blessings pass count your blessings present come on somebody hey i'ma praise him for what he did for me yesterday but i'ma praise him also for what he do for me right now but i got faith and my faith has long-ranged vision glory to god and i'm and i can already see what he's getting ready to do for me right now amen so i praise him for my future they say when you feel as though you have nothing for which to praise god just read david's list in the book of psalms you'll find plenty to give god praise for amen another thing they said here this last one said praise is thanking god for our salvation thanking god for our salvation and and i love they say when when someone gives you a gift uh do you say that's very nice now how much do i oh yeah i thought they gave you a gift and do you say that's very nice how much do i owe you now if i'm giving you a gift and i heard you tell me that's very nice brother jack how much do i owe you i'ma look at you strange right don't don't don't say that's very nice how much do i owe you the proper or the appropriate response when somebody gives you a gift you simply say two words thank you amen that's all you say is thank you that's the response when you're getting a gift and amen it said yet how often christians even after they had been given a gift of salvation feel obligated to try to work their way to god amen because our salvation and even our faith are gifts right we should respond with gratitude with praise and with joy so when praise is a thing it's thanking god for our salvation sometimes i remember one time i was at work and and i just got to thinking that i was saved i got the thing about i was saved oh they don't talk like that no more i'm i'm saved i'm saved right and and i got to think about man the lord saved me like the song said this morning he could have let me drown but instead he took me in and and and there's no goodness of my own but he saved me out of all the people out there that he could have saved he chose me and i'm saved i'm not the same person i used to be on i'm saved hallelujah i confess my sins to god and now i'm saved right and i was just beginning to think of my salvation and and before you know it i was up and moving around my office and uh and and and and it just uh it just it just it just got a hold of my i got something just i i had a little revival in there by myself saved by his power divine saved come on somebody i got new life sublime life now is sweet my joy is complete you know what i'm saying i got i'm saved [Applause] i got the feeling real i said i'm saved man i was in the office by myself just thank you for salvation i'm saved thank god we got so much to be grateful for amen so much to to be thankful for they were um they were they were they were you know there this power in our praise and i just remember as i was just going through that little moment and thinking about my salvation uh i don't know what i was going through but whatever i was going through it was over by the time i start releasing that praise and i'm telling you your praise can change amen it can change an atmosphere and you don't need nobody else to praise them just you doing it alone it'll change your atmosphere when you're riding down the street sometimes you got to turn the radio off in order to give god the praise i'm trying i'm sorry i heard what you said but i'm gonna have i've gotta stop right now and i'm gonna have to give god this praise praise changes atmospheres praise changes my my my outlook um i get encouragement when i praise all right church let's look at something you know uh they they they hit that song a little earlier and i was just um i had it in my notes to come back and and and get this because i had to go back last week and look at last week's sunday i mean sermon and um and i i was talking uh how we were just coming back from the um the uh the night of worship there in michigan and they got to sing in that song and i can't even think of it but yeah i'm going to see a victory the battle belongs to the lord and and they they got to sing an ad and i say lord i just want a little piece of it not and i got me a little piece and uh and i made this comment maybe the reason we haven't seen victory is because we still fighting but when we let go and let god fight the battle then we'll see victory right and i just began to think up think on those scriptures and i want to go and just read just where we get that thought from out of second chronicles 20 uh verse 15 through uh 25 if we can just catch that uh my god i wanna i wanna just say this ii chronicles said the battle was the lord's but i want to say this praise was the strategy used to enter the battleground i'ma say that again the battle was the lord's but praise was the strategy to enter the battleground [Laughter] when you leave here this i mean today you're going you're going you're going to a battleground and just understand the battle is not yours the battle is the lord's but praise is the strategy amen to enter to the battleground all right not to complain don't enter the battleground with complaints amen don't don't do that but enter the battleground with praise and watch what god does let's pick it up in second chronicles chapter 20 amen verse 15 it says and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you i like this be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods and if god be for us and who can be against us amen tomorrow go ye down against them amen behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel ye shall not need to fight in this battle what a promise right now you got to show up but you don't have to fight amen ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and you know you can imagine man i got these soldiers getting ready to attack me but god gave you a promise you're gonna have to fight glory to god you ready to make me take your sword out you're ready to defend yourself come on somebody amen but god said you don't need to fight in this battle put your sword back in your shield glory to god and stand still watch this it says you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourself standing still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against him for the lord will be with you and i like that on tomorrow god gonna be with you and and notice notice the way that they're approaching us we get ready to go to verse 18. that they can't go into battle dismate you can't go into battle with a defeated attitude you got to already see yourself as victorious you already you got to see yourself as the winner especially if god is with you hallelujah glory to god says in jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshiping the lord here it is and the levites of the children of the korathites and of the children of the korah heights stood up amen to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high i like that they didn't give god this soft praise god knows my heart god wants you to open your mouth if i brought you a gift amen don't just take it from me and then say well you know my heart nah if it's in your heart let it come out your mouth thank you come on somebody and man god want to hear your praise sometime hey god wants you to brag about him sometime god wants you to talk about him sometime oh hallelujah and we know the devil don't like it when we talk about jesus i mean since the time he got up and sharing a powerful testimony of what god did for her and here come the devil with an attack say you can't stop her you can't stop none of us you just make the testimony greater with every trial stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on how look at it and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa see when you know god is with you you can get up early in the morning like that and as they went forth john joshua stood and said hear me o judah and you inhabitants of jerusalem look at this believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established hallelujah so shall you be established if you believe in the lord your god but if you want to prosper believe his prophets so shall you prosper now it was a prophet that came to them came to them to encourage them that you ain't got to fight in this battle the battle is not yours it is the lord's it was the prophet that gave them that encouragement don't be dismayed so so so joshua the king said now believe in his prophets you'll prosper all right let's keep going on and when he had consulted with the people this is the strategy right here he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever now i i like i like the way this is uh uh written you know even in in our in our natural army uh they have uh uh certain things that they sing you know as they're going out you know even as they're doing their drills and things like that they have certain songs that they sing you know you hear them you laugh left left right left i mean all of that stuff means something and when it comes to battle sometimes they have certain songs and there's an encouragement that these guys get just from you know just from being part of the army and some of the songs they say it's an encouragement it just kind of uplifts them hallelujah amen so before they even go into battle they have been anointed by a song i think i was watching uh some video on social media and they had they had all these guys in the army just standing there in a cafeteria just praising the lord singing songs of work and i don't know it just did something to me to see all these men and the women also in their um in their uniforms but they realize before they go out to battle they need to give god some praise this was not part of my notes let me just see something here really quick oh my my my my it's something about just following amen uh uh yeah um there was a i i was um i was uh um at the hospital visiting my biological father right before he passed and there was a a a chaplain that came walking through the um the hospital and he just you know praying for different people and you know we got to talking and he gave me this little card and on the card he uh he stuck uh he said this psalms 91. he said just put this in your wallet i said okay thank you i appreciate that and i knew what what psalms 91 was and he told me a story amen about this let's let's let's let's read psalms 91 and i'll tell you the story this one in my notes but god knows amen uh psalms 91 says this uh he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the northern pestilence he shall covet thee with his feathers and on this wing shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler amen thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wastes at that noon name a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at their right hand but it shall not come nigh thee glory to god only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways i'ma stop right there but as he was telling me he gave me this little scripture to put him out and my wallet says there was a um a military leader i think maybe a captain or something like that and one of the uh uh i think of the army and uh they were in a war zone and he told his uh he told his troops he says look uh i'm gonna be at such and such spot every morning and when i come there uh i'm gonna read psalm 91 and then we're just gonna disperse and go back go about our ways he says now i am not making anybody come to that spot he says but if you want to come it's up to you if you want to come to the spot i'm telling you what i'm doing i'm going to just read psalm 91 and we're going to disperse so every day he would go there and read and and just so happened all his troops decided we're going to come praise god and they would go there and they read in the war zone psalm 91. every day psalm 91 and every day that they would go and read nobody was lost to a battle no i mean their their their position was not attacked anything it was protected because they would read psalm 91 amen and one day uh they this group this troop uh and that captain they got transferred to another area and another group came in and when the next route came in that area got attacked right away now what do you think was keeping them right amen that man read that to his troops every day and god surrounded just that one little area and if god would do that for somebody in the army what will he do for you hallelujah glory to god we got we got to know that he cares amen amen let me go back over here to uh ii chronicles i didn't finish that amen second chronicles chapter 20. amen here believe his prophets and you'll prosper all right believe his prophets and you're prospering you can believe in the lord your god and it will establish it but believe his prophets you will prosper all right let's go on let's go on so here uh verse 20 says and they arose early in the morning went forth unto the witness of decor and as they went forth jehoshaphat uh um jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god you shall be so shall you be established believe his prophet so so shall you prosper and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness and as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy and doeth forever when they begin to sing i like that when they begin to sing and to praise because sometimes you can sing without praising glory to god sometimes you that's singing because everybody else singing but when that thing become part of you and it's your own personal testimony you sing a little different hallelujah when they began to sing into praise the lord set ambushments against the children of armban moab and mount seir which would come which would come against judah and they were smitten i like this for the children of oman and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly the slave to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seer everyone helped to destroy another this is why they need to fight in the battle because this army or these great armies are going to fight each other and kill each other and the children of israel didn't have nothing to worry about but i'm going to tell you what god did for the children israel after they after their enemies wiped each other out did they get me after their enemies wiped each other out here you go to children of israel standing right there to to get a gift let's just read it amen and and when judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness they looked into the multitude and behold there were dead bodies falling to the earth and none escaped and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jews which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much now they was afraid to go to battle at one time but god god allowed a prophet to rise up in their midst and say this battle is not yours but it's the lord's and i'm gonna take that fear from you and let you know god is with you in the midst of what you're facing praise god and all you got to do is just show up you ain't got to fight now there was a reason god wanted them to show up because if they didn't show up they would not be able to partake of the spoils you ain't got to fight but you'll be blessed just by showing up and before you show up give god some praise [Applause] him a song and give him praise and watch him change the situation i love it let's look at a little quote here from mary's belief you know uh brother quinton was telling me that the gentleman that that arranges for us to be able to get the room here in the school uh he's been working with us for about a whole year and he said he he texts brother clinton says you know what i forgot to tell them to turn that ac on in that room that y'all in and uh brother brother quinn say i think it's okay right now but i see these bodies uh we getting a little fans but i say it's okay the man said you know i was praying that everything would be okay for y'all huh what the the school administrator say you praying i told brother clinton i said you know i'm going to tell you something sometimes god has to put the bride in certain positions in order to give eternal life to others that will never come and hear this gospel but because they did something nice for the bride that gives them a place to eternal life and i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna be looking for this man on the other side ain't going to be wonder how did you get here what's your testimony all i did was sign a lease for a church amen all right let's look at this this this this this quote just to kind of line it up we are looking at the story of mary a man and um and before uh uh she gave birth to the lord jesus um she was testifying of her pregnancy before she felt anything now i just want you to watch this and and we might kind of slip back to the scripture in a second but uh but here you know god's prophet says mary she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait until until she seen some physical sign if if i look for a physical sign what i'm uh what i'm led for tonight i look for every seat in here to be taken up all right when the place is only about two-thirds full but that doesn't matter we don't have to have an overflowing crowd there was a hundred and twenty in the upper room but they were all in the hand of god god started a revival with them 120 completely surrendered into his hands that never ended a fire that cannot be put out what could god do here tonight with these hundred in his hands is just getting ready believe him holding his promise before him now you know i i want to i want to say this because you know i i'm gonna stop just for a second and say how i appreciate you all i just want to say i appreciate spirit and truth tabernacle um you know oftentimes you are you find that that people don't want to necessarily go to church in a plaza people don't want to go to a church in a school but if you get a building people just come from everywhere and want to be a part of church i want to thank god for y'all saints that help us push the wagon up the hill oh you're not just going to get on when we're rolling down but you help push the wagon up the hill that's why you know i appreciate what our deacon was saying we're going we're going to rejoice together but this is all part of all of our testimony so i thank god for you that you don't i mean that you i know what i feel like this is more than just an assembling of people together amen this is like like brother solomon said this in this prayer this is the dressing of the bride right amen we come because we get the words amen we come because we get we get fed we come because god do something for us spiritually and we're not just gathering just to be gathering amen sometimes i have to remember about my lord right i have to be reminded when my lord came to this earth he came in a stable i'm talking about the creator of the earth he came in a stable right so so so here he is uh as the creator and a humble surrounding like that don't forget the day of small beginnings so i had to just stop and say i thank y'all i appreciate your faithfulness i really really thank god for you we gonna rejoice together you ain't gotta you ain't just you just wait and see we gonna rejoice together hallelujah [Applause] oh my so much more i can say but i'ma i'ma cut it go back to this quote says mary now mary could have waited till she had some kind of sign that she was going to be mother says and you can wait after the meeting after meeting's over until you feel that you could move your crippled leg just a little better or you could hear a little better out of that death or the kansas scene to be that it wasn't bothering you so much that's not taking god at his word look at this to take god at his word is to hear his word anybody heard his word yet today no no you just don't stop at hearing his word the next part accept it that's god speaking directly to me and once you accepted it the next part start rejoicing with it hear the word accept it and then start rejoicing with it this is what mary began to do right she heard from the angel amen she accepted what the angels she said be it unto me according to thy word and then she began to rejoice with that word we're going to read it we're going to read it in a second i'm just i'm gonna just i i feel just to read it let me just keep reading this quote here says we could see 500 rush to the altar tonight which would be good which would be a good sign that the revival is going to break we don't have to have 500 at the altar we just have to take god's word for it and start rejoicing something will happen listen that brings the word to life as we water it with praises if you want your promise to live you're gonna have to start warning your promise with your praises it ain't gonna be good enough for me to praise god for the promise that he gave you but you got to start warning your own promise with your praises just this week i was um i was i was you know at the at the house and you know we kind of it just seems like uh uh the grass dying and and and and the trees kind of uh uh drying up and everything and you know i just noticed that hey something wrong my sprinkler system ain't getting the water that it should be getting you can take that down for me i said let me get out here and try to fix this thing let me try to get this thing fixed so then what i what i did i looked at a couple trees in the front of the front of my house and said we got to get this thing we got to get this thing going so i say um i said let me get some water and i saw my the leaves on the tree just just they when when they die when they live and they perk up but when they die they droop down and you got to catch them in that droopy stage oh come on somebody you got to catch them in that droopy stage because if you don't catch them then they'll fall off praise god but but as i saw him in the drupal stage let me i said let me just take some water and just start giving it to these giving it right here to this area not wait for the sprinklers i'll just i'll do it manually and i start putting water in certain areas and just just i say okay let me set it here let me set it there let me set it here i went back out the next morning and i was looking as the sun was striking that leaf that leaf that was drooping come on somebody all of a sudden was perked up and looked very very healthy and and the weight of the tree went from drooping to healthy is because i simply gave it water do you feel a little droopy in your spirit do you feel a little droopy but the best way to get from droopiness amen to being alive again is start giving god his praise let's read this out of uh out of uh luke 1 luke 1 verse 35 hallelujah hallelujah hey there's power in our praise luke 1 verse 35 we're not waiting a man to see some manifestation before we give god the praise we're going to take him at his word we're going to accept it and we're going to start rejoicing with what we got hallelujah hallelujah i'm rejoicing about the 40-day prophecy amen i accepted and i'm rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah glory to god here in luke 1 35 what were that 40 day prophecy that we're going to see something supernatural within 40 days and we've already started seeing it but i'm expecting more i heard the man that was eating watermelon says got to be more where that come from amen all right all right come on let's let's let's read this says and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god amen and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and i was listening to a quote brother branham said elizabeth was about 70 years old can you imagine that 70 years old and not not now some of my sisters that's that's that doesn't hit 70 already they saying to themselves ain't no way i'll be carrying a baby at 70. but i'ma tell you something if you was elizabeth and you had not ever had a baby and you realize the uh uh the uh the stigma that was associated with a woman that never had a child it meant something to them to have a baby now it means something to people to have cats and dogs but it meant something to them to have a baby right and if you would if you would have been in her shoes and never had a baby and and now all of a sudden at 70 it's a miracle for you to just even be able to bear to be able to carry a child at 70. praise the lord but here here here um uh we we get it and uh look at look at what uh what what what's going let's go back to this verse and uh behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age see and i like this i mean this is before the the uh uh what that thing they but they can tell you what the sex of your baby is ultrasound before ultrasound the holy ghost tell you what the baby is look at it say that that that that cuz elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baron she's not gonna bear that reproach anymore six months she's been pregnant and you know you can imagine mary has no idea that her cousin's pregnant and she's been pregnant for six months elizabeth is probably hiding hallelujah not letting anybody know what is going on about maybe she i i i can't know if i don't even know if i can trust what the aim does i haven't lost too many babies before and at this age to have a baby six months she's pregnant imagine get yourself on the scene and see what's going on look at this uh it says who has who has called or who was called barren a for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of lord being unto me according to the word and the angel departed her right when she said that that's when the pregnancy took place in mary when she accepted the words the pregnancy happened right then now let's go a little further because she didn't just stop and just accepting the word she heard the word she accept the word but then she began to rejoice now look at what happened with mary after the angel departed look at the next verse and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country how she how did she go yo how did she go she wasn't just kind of uh trying you know i get there when i get there no no no she went with hates she was in a hurry i mean she had just had a visitation from the angel and and she wants to go and tell elizabeth exactly what she heard now look at what this says she went with haste went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth amen and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost now now we got to get ourselves on the scene and we got to read in between the lines what just happened here here come me here comes mary in haste i can see her knocking on the door hey hey hey y'all home and and now imagine elizabeth is in her 70s mary is about 18 years old good god of mine they don't really have much in common they probably wouldn't be uh a pen pass to one another glory to god but they that but what brought this thing in common is when the supernatural begin to happen in mary and mary understood that the supernatural was also happening in elizabeth so here come mary and knowing that elizabeth is six months pregnant i gotta get there and just greet her and as the salutations this is a greeting and and maybe they just talk and say i ain't singing so long and you know this happened that's happening and this been happening and that been happening they say you say uh me and joseph we're gonna get married we're engaged to get married but you know what elizabeth uh i'm pregnant she said oh y'all already got medicine no i didn't get married yet what you mean you didn't get married yet so i said no not not yet but but you know uh i am pregnant same like now you know what that mean mary you know he might leave you he might just no no no he gonna stay with me i'm pregnant and he said well i said i don't know i don't get it mary said but you know the same angel that told me that i was gonna have this baby glory to god it's the same angel that told me that you're six months pregnant how you know that mary the angel told me that it said i'm gonna tell you another thing the angel told me the angel told me what i should name my baby well what his name gonna be mary you ready for it elizabeth yes i'm ready for his name gonna be jesus and elizabeth felt something my god she felt something he said what you say his name gonna be jesus and things begin to move in the inside of your lips she said the baby that i've been pregnant with have not moved for six months but when you just came and gave his name hallelujah just at his name dead things will live [Music] situations change when we call his name when we praise his name she said she said she said oh my so and here we pick it up in the scripture uh verse 41 that came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation marriage that the babe leaped in the womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spoke out with a loud voice i don't know where we get the quiet voice from can you can somebody just show me that in scripture where where are we supposed to praise god with the quiet voice the mouse voice it seemed like every time god do something for somebody in scripture they lift it up loud look the bible says uh and she spake with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me look at it she says forth low for low as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and i like this verse right here because this is your promise and when you when you hear your promise accept it and start rejoicing with it here it is blessed is she that believed blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which which were told her from the lord amen that is your promise for today and what that actually means when it says there shall be a performance that says it shall be a manifestation in your life i accept it and i'm going to start rejoicing in that because god told me there shall be a performance oh yeah there's going to be a performance of this 40-day prophecy hey there's going to be a performance i'm going to see my family come back in it's going to be a performance of every promise god made me my body will experience healing there shall be a performance of those things that god promised me accept it start rejoicing with it can we slip back now and and pick up our scripture oh my my my my my we were reading over here in acts 16 and um as we were just picking this up see there's power in your praise church you got to understand that amen there there is there's some some serious power in your praise your praise is what changes things your praise is what does it mean all right you know uh just before we get back to our scripture just a a quick um testimony you all remember uh brother branham prayed for john ryan and a man was blind um and and here you know uh he went through the prayer line got prayed for and he says now he says preacher i thought you said i was healed he says yeah i said you was healed i thought you said you believe he said i i do believe he says well you know uh it says but i i'm hearing this person got healed and things happening right away and this person that but for me i'm still blind what should i do he says what you need to do you know to just start thanking god for your healing so just just just find a way to start thanking god for your healing he says well okay all right that's what i do so he uh he was a newspaper salesman and he would sell his newspaper and actually before before he was before he did the newspaper he would stand up in church say excuse me i'm sorry to interrupt the service but i want to thank god for my healing sit back down come back the next night hey i'm sorry again interrupt the service but i want to thank god for my healing and he just praise the lord i thank god for my healing and so so so uh he's selling newspapers and as he's at that and it seemed like he started in church but then he took what was in church out to the streets and he had a newspaper to say he says uh extra extra read all about it thank god for my healing you know always add that to it extra extra read all about it thank god for my healing and he went on weeks and weeks like this and and one day he's sitting in the chair of the barber hallelujah and the bible say now look you're going to bring shame on the gospel with you always talk about thank god for your healing you know you're still blindish i don't know what he says i understand that but i'm still thanking god for my healing he said well you need to stop doing that say no thank god for my healing i'm gonna let you take it out of me and nobody else i'm gonna sell my papers and i'm gonna keep thanking god for my healing and he said right there one more time to the bible thank god for my healing hey come running out the barber chair hear the barber running behind him with all the tools and saying you're gonna get hit by a car say no i'm gonna get hit by nothing i can see the car i can see this i can see that i thank god for my healing and what brought the healing to john ryan was when he began to water the promise with his praise there is power in your praise here we look at this this story with uh with paul and silas um they are uh in a situation where they're trying to go in a particular direction and god's blocking it then they try to go somewhere else and then god just blocks that and everything they were trying to do in their own god would block anytime you try to do it on your own i pray god will block it you realize you need him oh hallelujah and let me tell you another thing before i get there sometimes you can offer god a premature praise brother jack what you mean well brother branham asked the lord for three squirrels one time he was very specific about them squirrels he wanted three squirrels and god said uh okay to say where they gonna be and you can have it this gonna do this just gonna do that shot the squirrel got it next world where you want that one to be this one do this shot the squirrel got it and then uh he offered god a premature praise lord i thank you for my two squirrels and lord i appreciate it god i'll go home and tell the testimony god said no don't go nowhere how many did you ask for say you asked for three that's what you're gonna get and here's the thing i'm gonna tell you what get us this is the problem right here for all of us everybody including this when we have to wait on the lord you start getting all kind of ideas while you're waiting but i'm gonna tell you what you're supposed to do while you're waiting wait in praise that's all you do while you're waiting just praise god and wait because there shall be a performance of those things that he promised you don't give god a premature praise [Music] all right amen here paul and silas um are on the way you know trying to find these different places that they want to go and god just blocking everything they do no no don't do that don't do that and here paul ends up having a a vision in the night and this vision comes and says hey uh there's a man standing in macedonia uh that's saying in paul send apollo vision come help us we need help over here in macedonia so there paul got a a a sense of comfort in his heart that this is the direction that i should go i should be headed towards macedonia so immediately when god showed it to him he got an action and as he's on his way to uh macedonia goes through different places and and and and here's the the the thing about it you can be doing the will of god but still get attacked by the enemy right and while paul was there i believe he came in contact with um um a couple different people but there was a you know and i'm trying to find her name right now uh oh god i think i want to say it's not tabitha something else i cannot think of her name right now uh but but lydia lydia was her name so here paul comes in contact with lydia and lydia's receiving him receiving them in the house but here's the thing no matter how blessed lydia's house is glory to god paul realizes in the vision there is a man in macedonia that's saying come help us now paul is there in the city uh he's working with lydia lydia has accepted them into her home and then uh there's another young lady that's kind of got a spirit on a of you know witchcraft pretty much and and these men are men and the great the most high god these men and paul just you know doing whatever uh to kind of get this this late to get this spirit off this lady and when the spirit came off the girl uh her her employer was upset with paul so you don't mess with my money the lady was delivered but but this was his way to get money so you don't miss my money so paul and silas ends up in jail because somebody got delivered let's read their story but here's a there's a good part about it the man that was in macedonia was a man that was in jail and the only way paul could get to the man is by getting this girl delivered he would have never been nowhere near the man had he not brought deliverance to this girl i mean sometimes we look at things that happen in our life and we just assume that this is the devil but sometimes god is orchestrating a plan and in the midst of all the orchestration i'm telling you one thing you can look back and see how god has orchestrated certain things in your life certain people he had placed in your life oh good god certain business partners that he put in your life certain decisions you have to come you can look back and now in the past and give god praise for putting the people in your life i thank god he put some men in my life that would that would be that would be strong enough strong enough mentally to fire a pastor look brother brother brother brother brother whisperer told us it take a certain kind of man for a certain kind of job you got to have certain qualities because some people like no i just respect pastors too much i'm gonna just deal with no no no no he had to make these guys a certain way that they would put a pastor out of work and i'm gonna tell you i look back and i say lord i thank you because had they not done what they did i wouldn't be where i'm at right now amen and when when i think about these things you know it just it just things just all all kind of thoughts go through my head when i when i was working and i would get an invitation to go somewhere somebody invite me to come come speak it was always no and i had a good reason i got to work i can't get off no time on my job but but but when god delivers me from the job and then he presents the same opportunity to me nah i got to say lord help me where do you want me to go because you know what i realized it was you that did this back here so now you're doing something here i want to just be in tune with what you're doing oh hallelujah i thank god for the ministry he has given spirit and truth tabernacle i thank god for brother quaker i thank god for brother smiley i thank god for brother troy i thank god for brother jerry i thank god for the ministry that he's given this church sometimes sometimes you know and i i just man i got to repent sometimes because i you know you look at him like you know you're trying to do it but god said look i got everything under control everything is under control not just ministry solid ministry you got to worry about nothing people ask me to say well who preaching for you you know why while you're away oh i got multiple ministers my brother will preach my brother-in-law would preach i said god sent us a brother all the way from ghana that i preached they'd be like what yeah god got this this is not brother jack's church this is jesus christ church he got this and i'm gonna tell you something he has always had it i'm just realizing it god got this thank god for the people he put in my life that that allowed me to go through certain trials if they didn't have that type of disposition it wouldn't have pushed me to where i need to be right now let me let me try to read this let me try to read this hey you got to learn how to praise god here so paul would have never met this man had he not gone through the trial of casting out this demon out of that girl and because the man's money was the her employer's money was was all uh messed up because the girl is free and not seeing under that spirit anymore he said paul and sausage i got to go to jail beat him did all kinds of things and threw these guys in jail now let's pick it up amen here in um acts 16 verse 25. actually you know what maybe maybe start back a little bit 16 acts 16 16. and it came to pass as we went to prayer certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination met us which brought uh brought her masters much gained by sue saying same followed paul and and us in christ saying these men are the servants of the most high god which showings us the way of salvation and this did see many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour and when a master saw that the hope of their gains was gone they called paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans and the multitudes rose up together against them and the magistrates ran off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailer jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in stocks now i want you to kind of get a picture in your head here what this means to have your feet fast in stocks they would actually um take your feet and put shackles you know on them and also take your hands and put shackles on them and then they'd also take your neck and put a shackle around your neck and brother branham said what they would do is they would they would have just a drip of water that would hit you right on the top of the head just drip and at first it don't mean nothing i i got that but when it keep happening over and over again it just began to drive you crazy so they really they really put them in some real uh uh uh i mean a really really hard position while they're there in prison now let's let's let's keep reading amen verse um 24 who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in stocks i like this now remember in the vision this man came to paul at night we read that earlier when when paul saw the man in macedonia he had a vision at night now look at this verse 25 and at midnight paul and silas prayed now they didn't stop there and sing praises unto god and you can just imagine as a singing you know brother brother brother brother brother brother branham said now he put it in today's terms i know that they didn't they didn't do that back then but he was saying maybe you know they got the singing uh just a couple songs maybe there is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb i'ma tell you some of y'all be in concert at home y'all get one of those songs just go to work y'all get in concert mode there is power power wonder work and power and you don't be needing nobody to help you in the precious blood of the lamb good god almighty then he said then he said maybe they got into oh how i love jesus i'm talking about i'm hearing my stocks i got water dripping on my head but i'm saying oh how i love jesus oh how i love jesus good god almighty because he and i could see the prisons like what in the world oh god how i love cheese and i'm going to tell you i see my friend my good friend and i said why y'all put that o and everything that's just a expression from the heart my brother you got you got to understand that he said y'all and he said y'all even put the words on the screen just yeah and you better hit every one of them too that's an expression from the heart my brother oh yes sir why that why you think they put oh how i love jesus oh how i love jesus they thought about it because he first loved me to me he is so wonderful i said to me he is so wonderful to me he is so wonderful because he first loved me oh good god almighty so they got down there just began to sing some of them songs the other prisoners heard them and as they were listening to paul and silas just just two of them i told you just just that one of us and i like that's why i like psalms 34 so you magnify the lord with me let us exalt his name together all right so he said i can do it by myself and and i can drive devils out with my praise by myself i've done it i've done it before amen but i'ma tell you it's just something when we do this thing together it'd get contagious in the house but here paul and silas are just worshiping the lord they're praying and they're doing this at midnight singing praises unto god amen and the bible says and the prisoners heard them glory to god there's power in our praise and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands were loose now here brother random tells us what happened here with this prison because you got to understand the prison cells are attached to the foundation amen and to the walls so what god has to do is disrupt the foundation come on somebody and by disrupting the foundation it causes the walls to fall right and and not only did god cause the walls to fall amen god was so perfect that even when the walls and i don't know what they were attached to with these stocks but god caused the stocks to be broken and all this came from somebody praising hallelujah the starks can be broken in the lives of your children in the lives of your love if you would just learn to give god praise stop fussing with them start arguing with them and start giving god praise for his promise being fulfilled in their life watch the stocks get broken brother branham say the wolves actually fell away from them rather than on them the walls actually fell away from them i'm going to tell you something about god he's perfect he's considering every detail and can you imagine you imagine this let's just keep reading the story because uh after this earthquake something happened verse 27 tells us the keeper of the prison awaken out of his sleep seeing the prison doors open he just every prisoner's door is open i'ma say that again every prisoner's door is open all you got to do is walk out [Music] every prisoner's door is open look at it um keep in the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here i'm gonna tell you what happened that prison became a church because wherever the saints are gathered is church paul crabbe live was do thou seven harm for we all here then he called for light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved so you need to start thanking god for salvation what do i what do what what must i do to be saved and this salvation they talk about some something totally different what just happened to these prisoners they were they were they were saved from a prison sentence but this man wanted eternal salvation right he said and they said believe on the lord jesus christ thou shalt be saved and the house there's so much in this y'all you know and here here's it here's what the prophet tells us about this you know uh first first thing i want to say the man that paul said believe on the lord jesus christ now i read the scripture earlier about believe on the lord your god so shall you be established believe his prophets and so shall you prosper right but here amen paul is actually telling him to say believe on the lord jesus christ when we're trying to introduce people to this message always give them to jesus first don't try to give them too much of the message get them to jesus because i tell you what they're they'll if you give them enough jesus they'll get more thirsty and they want to know i mean i heard other people talk about jesus but you saying something a little different about them hallelujah then you can introduce them to a prophet that expressed this jesus to us believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and look at this and thy house here's another nugget brother branham tells us he says the same faith that you apply to your own salvation and you know what ain't when you saved ain't nobody can tell you you're not saved amen i don't care what anybody say well i saw you no you didn't see me doing nothing no you didn't uh-uh i'm saved i don't do that well i thought maybe that maybe somebody looked like you maybe it was but it wasn't me you don't care what they say i'm saved i'm saved and here's the thing when you got confidence in your own salvation no matter what your children doing no matter what your husband doing no matter what your wife doing no matter what any your brother don't know that you and your house should be safe so the same thing that you apply to yourself apply that to your family [Applause] hey god is loosing prisoners right now you might go home and find somebody loose [Applause] one brother came to church one time and and and he was just had a burden for his family while he was in church he had a burden for his family and and brother branham standing there preaching looked up and said brother dalton i give you your children in the name of the lord jesus christ say what yeah the prophecy i give you your children in the name of the lord jesus christ it's going to be a performance of those things brother dawson just began to worship and praise god when he got home his kids was waiting for him daddy daddy i want to be saved at it i want to get saved daddy what what must i do to get saved at it i mean he saw immediate change in his children just like that y'all better start thinking off for the little things [Applause] my wife was telling me just a little thing so she was just went to the car my daughter and just to put my grandson in the car my daughter turned on the car you know get the ac running and my wife noticed some music playing in the background christian music i say hey i'ma start praising god for that because sometimes you have the right song at the right time it'll change atmospheres you'll feel a shift taking place i said i'ma praise god just for that i said my grandson listening to uh good gospel songs my daughter listening to the good gospel hey just keep that atmosphere god can do something in the right atmosphere the same faith i believe for myself and being saved i'm applauded to my family look at this believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they speak unto him the word of the lord and the all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed the stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway now this man went from almost killing himself to getting eternal life and this is this is the beautiful part because you know they they would have told them exactly what it's told in acts 2. if you want if you want to get closer to christ repent be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and here's the good thing about it the promise is unto you and to your children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call what a promise verse 34 says this and when he had brought them into his house he said meet before them and rejoice believing in god with all his house now what was that rejoice that you think he did that was that loud praise coming out of his mouth now i mean you should be in the prison watching the prisoners but you know what i i'm just i just i just i just believe god did it in such a way that not only that prison got shook i think that whole city got shot because as a soldier you know if you if you lose a prisoner like that you know you lose your life that's why he was given to take his life but i believe that whole city probably got shook and and when they got shook you know um they would have to be they have to understand what this man was going through so this man took advantage of his opportunity look i'm gonna tell you what i don't know when you coming back to prison but i need to know how to get safe and paul gave him the promise believe in the lord jesus christ you and your whole household that man said come on home with me i need to be baptized got baptized got his whole house baptized and they set their rejoicing which means they sat there praising god sometimes that's what we need to do stop stop everything else you're doing stop and just give god praise why brother jack because it's power in your praise let's pray father we are appreciative of the word of the lord we don't want it just to be bible stories god and what we've seen people do in the past but lord help us apply these principles even right now this is mary she heard the word then she accepted it then she started rejoicing with what she had god you've given us the word and and uh we have to accept it and lord don't let us don't let us uh have these premature praises you know what you've promised us and god all we got to do is wait on that that's the difficult part waiting is always difficult but lord help us to surrender to you uh in this time where we should just lord just be patient knowing that you got everything under control you you've never lost a battle you never will lord the the the battle is not ours it's yours it's yours for god you're giving us to victory and we thank you lord jesus that we would be able to enjoy the spoils of victory i
