uh but uh I was telling them my dad is going on to be with the Lord but Dad told me uh before he passed we used to have brother Trevor come and and dad told me so you know brother Trevor is my favorite preacher so okay um I thought I'd be his favorite Batman it's all right uh but he's he said he's he said he said he just he's um when he preaches he relates to the people very well and uh not trying to preach way over your head but trying to preach right where you live amen right and uh he just does a great job you know that and and and and we you know we we share a lot amen we're going through a lot together and just uh but one of the things I've seen is just the Lord just continue to open up doors for him uh that uh just sometimes just blows my mind to see how busy he is in Ministry but God is so good but I I always um I like the fact that uh we got history together so before all these other open doors was there you know there's a lot there was some open doors here amen and uh and we have we have just enjoyed amen our brother's Ministry throughout the years so uh tonight A man he's with us to speak from God's heart to our hearts amen and I believe God got something in store we don't we don't come to church by chance and by Happiness dance by accident amen God predestinates us amen and we just uh we we just fall into that plan so let's sing of course a man

God praise God praise God praise God praise God o praise God we'll praise God praise God pray praise God praise God amen praise the Lord [Music] Hallelujah it's good to be back to my Florida home [Music] a little while but you know we just always pick right back up where we left off amen so praise the Lord if you would turn with me to John chapter 16. and verse 13. I see where we're interpreting in the back so I'll I'll try to be slow enough all right so John chapter 16 and verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so when the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth okay so I want to look at also Revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 very familiar you probably don't have to turn there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he's declared to his servants the prophets so if there's mystery there's truth in those Mysteries but but but the spirit of Truth is going to come and reveal all of those Mysteries it's gonna it's going to have to take the spirit of Truth to open these Mysteries to to reveal Mysteries to us so that's what the holy spirit is is going to come and do I want to speak on a subject of all truth if you would just bow your heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord you're good to us we know you love us we know that you are the great one the Eternal Heavenly Father you are the one who brought to us truth oh God and through so many ways Lord you have done this you sent us your word oh God and we have this book we call the Bible Lord he sent us prophets throughout all ages Lord to manifest and live this truth to prophesy this truth you sent your son Jesus Christ to fully embody godhead and fully embody the character and heart of God lord we are we are just overwhelmed by all the expression that you've given to us and father because you had a great plan in your mind because you wanted to call out a gentile bride because you wanted to reverse what Satan did in your Eden and you wanted to come and pull out a people out of his Eden Lord so you hid things but Lord you prophesied and told us that in these days it would be open to us again and we're so thankful for it Lord because Lord we see that it gives us not just truth Lord as such not just knowledge father but Lord it it reveals to us the character and heart of God more fully than we've ever seen and are known it before and it is that Lord that truth that moves our hearts so passionately oh God so we bless the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ask you to be very present in this service Lord Jesus let your spirit Your Atmosphere be here and welcome in our hearts and in this prayer in this room Lord drive out any evil Lord and fully have preeminence in this time that we have together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask you amen amen you may be seated so it's as I've said it's so good to return amen be here and just always love to come down and be apart and yeah I think brother Jack and I met in 2001. Zion was six weeks old he's now 22. he has a girlfriend that he's pretty serious about you know time just moves on you know so um but I think you know brother Jack I would say his um would be the first Minister that that really invited me to come and and sent me a plane ticket and said come you know others may be well if you're here maybe we'll give you a shot but but brother Jack emailed plane tickets it's just um I'll never forget that moment it's like oh going to Florida you know when you're I guess 22-23 you know and someone asked you to come preach that's a pretty big deal for a for a young minister so been a lot of water under the bridge since then and and um just this just way of testimony since we're all friends and family here you know just as brother Jack was commenting on just how the Lord has been taking my Ministry and I'm totally out of days off um they called me with website troubles today I was like praise the Lord I'm not taking a vacation day for that you called me you're paying me so I thought it was a blessing but um you know um just just how the Lord has been using me I've been in Africa and just many different places over the last few years brother job I think some of you know brother job was giving me a bad time I was trying to give him a bad time about how many times he you know flies from Europe to America and he's like wait a second how many times have you been to Europe in the last 12 months and I was like this calendar year it's only it's only been once but you know we we were in Italy and Norway and you know I've been in Norway twice in the last 12 months and and just preached a big Camp there I uh preached at the youth camp in Indiana and just just been amazing um to be used at the Lord and I'm so thankful and and uh just for the doors that he's opening and I'm just trying to be faithful and be a blessing and that's what I've always wanted to do is just be a blessing wherever I'm at so and um I sometime I'm going to send um my father maybe a sermon of yours brother Jack maybe you tell me which one you think is the best one and then we can see if maybe my dad hey maybe he'd think you were better it's just a thought I don't know but we we certainly miss him and always enjoyed having him with us and so all right maybe we should now go to the word but it just so good to be back with you all sir brother Brenham and I'm going to take quite a bit of our thought tonight from that message the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose ended all out through these denominations and organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery now I want to go maybe go back one and I just want to point out that that nowhere are we ever saying that there was no truth in denominations there was truth throughout these denominations many of them had much of the truth as brother Branham even said many of them were probing at it and and had different things about it but but but we are now in the days where the spirit of of Truth has come to guide you into all truth so the holy spirit is his intention is to come not just into part but into all truth so we believe that the Holy Spirit coming in our lives shows us and brings us and guides us into the place where all truth is so so these denominations had some and I don't disregard that at all and I just want you to to know that you know tonight as I bring this thought out I have no disregard to to denominations but I have full regard to the full truth and it is the full truth that I want to walk in and so so that's that's what we're just looking at and that's what we believe this message has done is not to bring us into a super denomination or a better one or blah blah blah like no this isn't a group thing this is this is a word of God that calls us out of group things into a he wanted to to bring us into his true spiritual relationship between God and man and so so so how is he going to do that he's going to do that by giving us all truth because if we have all truth and we know the very heart of God that's what changes us then the structures don't you know you don't you won't need brother Jack is a pastor to say not that you won't want him but you won't need him to say now what's your name young man Joseph I should have known that I'm sorry now Joseph you realize you've been doing these things wrong you need to stop doing all that and this and this and this and this but when Joseph catches the vision in Revelation for himself of the character and the Heart of God it's going it's going to captivate his mind so much that that it's like like everything else is just gonna be like no I don't want that because the things that are truth are so much more moving all right so all right so we can go forward um uh yeah we can go go on to Matthew Chapter 13 there and so I just wanna so so as we look at this at this message this serves as this the sign of the end and this will be the last message to the second to last message that brother Branham preaches in 1962 but it's the last Sunday morning and he knows he's about to go to Arizona and he's taking it out of Revelations T starts in Revelations 10 and he's in 10 1 he's in 10 7. he's going all the way through Revelation 10. he is talking about that the Lord himself would come with a cloud now he doesn't know that there's going to be a picture of a cloud taken later on he just knows that I'm preaching this and I feel drawn to Arizona and something is going to happen I've seen this Vision I'm going to be picking a over all these different things that we're all aware of right but what he's but but he's tying this event that that this is this is going to be the tying up of all of these Mysteries that's why he's in Revelations 10 and that's why we get down to Revelations 10 7. so so but then he's going to be showing us doctrines that we that this ministry is going to be bringing to us and we want to look at those doctrines and what I what we're going to see and what I'm going to try to show is I'm I'm going to try to show a picture of this is what it looks like without message Doctrine wow and this and we'll try to keep you know that will be not message doctrine of this over here will be message Doctrine try to keep the sides right God but not that we want to you know just show a picture of Doctrine that's God doctrines make sure they're right brother because you're a message believer all right so you should have the right doctrines this is what it should look like okay no right but but what I want to show you is that with the right doctrines the the picture that we have of Jesus Christ is the most compelling and wonderful picture of Jesus Christ that you could ever think of [Music] and so so that it is the message that's not just rules and regulations you know in Pentecost but harder I mean that hit hard on some people you know it's not that right but it's that these doctrines that the denominations had tying loose ended they were laying out there but when we've pulled them all together the picture that we have of Jesus Christ is amazing amen so so that's what we're we're about this evening now so as just kind of as we we just kind of slowly bring our way into this I want to look at Matthew chapter 13. and and we have slides for you but I'm going to also turn there um but Matthew Chapter 13 and the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now it is that this it is at this spot in the Bible that brother Brennan will be preaching in this message and he will be telling us he'll start listing Mysteries that Scofield had listed and then he'll go into Mysteries that his ministry has has has brought out so so he's this is the spot where he's tying those things in but but he says it says it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath now now I struggled with this scripture as a kid maybe some of you do too because you have to you have to look at the scripture and go that's not fair why why why would God do this like is it your fault you don't have it like maybe God could give it to you and then he could then give you more but like seems unfair seems unfair therefore speak guide to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Messiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them so if we can just I just I want to go back to verse 11 here and and just stay here for a minute because so I want to ask I want to ask us all a question does Jesus love everyone in the world and this is not a trick question okay I know I know I ask them but just Jesus did Jesus die for everyone does he love everyone absolutely he does he does he loves brother Jack stop laughing it's true God is love he died for everyone he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance is that the scripture not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but when he's here in Matthew 13 and he's been preaching to everyone he's been doing it in parable and then the disciples come to him and ask a very fair question hey Jesus why are you talking comparables and Jesus says because to them is not given to know but to you it's given to know but Jesus you're gonna die on a cross soon for us and Them but yet you're all right like it's not just you know it's just not just scripture Jesus is participating in this thing Jesus is saying you know then you know we're just okay this group over here we're not going to have anybody in this room you know like over here no I'm preaching to them in parables because if they see they might see things and they shouldn't because of Isaiah's prophecy if they hear it they might hear it and they shouldn't because of Isaiah's prophecy wow what Jesus what are you doing here you love these people but you're speaking to them in Parables and to these you're revealing it plainly but why are you doing that it's almost Jesus it's almost as if you already know there's two groups of people on this Earth it's as if you knew there was two groups of people on this Earth and you were talking to one in a way you knew they would catch things in another you knew they wouldn't so you already know there's two groups of people so I would just like us to take in our minds for a moment now this concept right here in Matthew chapter 13. and go and ask your Baptist friends sir ask your denominational friends could you explain that to me is there a Bible Doctrine already in the Bible that tells me why Jesus is doing this where does Jesus get that there's two groups of people I don't know what the answer will be because I don't there's there's only one answer for me he knows about Genesis chapter 2. and Genesis chapter 3 Jesus knows about serpency so Jesus knows there are two groups of people and if we're honest with ourselves so did the Pharisees because there I believe it's John chapter 8 and they're struggling and they're having problems and Jesus is like they're the reason you can't you can't understand my speech why do you not understand my speech it's because there's nothing in you to hear me with because you're of your father the devil so the reason they can't hear is because they have a different father and the Pharisees themselves response we be not born of fornication they themselves know about serpent C they know about Original Sin so Jesus and and so and we'll get into this in a bit but while we're here you know John chapter 3 Nicodemus comes to Jesus [Music] and Jesus is like you you're gonna need to be born again because the way you were born was wrong amen are you a master in Israel and you don't know this you see Nicodemus my birth my first birth there was no problems because it was spoken word but Nicodemus your birth it had a problem because it came the same way that it came in the Garden of Eden and you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity you came into the world speaking lies because you weren't spoken word born you were born by sex and this is a problem this means that's why you must be born again and we'll we'll get back into that but here Jesus is he is he is actively participating in the fact there are there are two groups of people and that that should seem very unfair that should seem like what but Jesus you love all of them but here's this is how you're you're working this it's because Jesus knows about serpent seed and serpent seed is the only way you can make Matthew 13 make sense otherwise Jesus is being arbitrary he's these people can these people can't well I mean how do I get onto the other side like Jesus here's here's some bread could I it's not no no so so he's not arbitrary there there are there are just there are two groups of people that exist on this earth now we understand their spiritual implications of that now like you know look when it was Cain and Seth one was a child of God and one was a child of the serpent and it was really easy to figure out which was which but since Noah we don't we don't have that right now there's a spiritual element now but you don't need to start trying to you know go back in your genealogy and all of these things but do you hear the word of God amen amen all right so so let's continue on now I want to go um maybe to slide 18 there sister the beginning of the the next quote there um is this the sign of the end sir that's some of the Mysteries now as I said this that we right there where we were in Matthew 13. Schofield has all of these Mysteries listed and he reads all of these things and many of them about the Catholic church in Rome and different things like that he reads through those and then he says that's some of the Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of God may I say this with reverence not referring to myself but to referring to the angel of God the serpent seed that's been a mystery that's been hidden that's been a hidden Mystery all through the years the grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace no such a thing as an eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal had never a beginning or an end and hell was created all these Mysteries the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has brought it into titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ according to the Book of Revelations that the church in this time was to receive there is some of the Mysteries the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the Mysteries seeing that Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel the same one that struck down Saul on his road down to Damascus and the same one coming with the same power doing the same things and revealing the same word staying word by word with the Bible so in no place is he saying he's referring to an angel he's referring to Mysteries that are going to come but he is also very very aware that he must stay word by word with the Bible because if it's not it's not true Revelation it's not all truth if it's not tying to the Bible so he's wanting to stay word by word with the Bible no problem I got it I was about to bring brother Jonathan up here he's he gets that for me sometimes that was so embarrassing we were in Africa preaching together and I had I was struggling with a shoulder issue and I could not open this bottle for nothing and it just tumbling tumbling for a brother all right we're staying so we got all these Mysteries and we're going to stay word by word with the Bible so now we can go and we want to look at the list here of all of these and we'll just you know serpent seed Grace straightened out no eternal hell baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ godhead so we're going to go through all of these in the next 35 minutes or so and and we're going to look and we're going to build this picture of Jesus Christ okay so starting here now with serpent seed and now we've we've kind of begun to already tease out some of some of how this matters and and it matters because we can begin to see the pattern of scripture and what's going on and we can see the way Jesus is ministering makes sense now and that he's not being arbitrarily choosing but that there is the truth that there are some that are and some that are not right so so then we can also see the Virgin birth was necessary and has meaning and it's because of serpent seed because because otherwise you just ask our denominational Christian friends why does Jesus need to come and be born as a virgin well you can say because the Bible says so true but is there is there a reason is is it like God doesn't just randomly doing things there's a there's a connection back to the mind and heart of God and all of this and the original way was spoken word the original it got let there be light and there was let there be a child and there was it was Jesus Christ right so so the word was spoken to Mary and Mary with a heart of Faith received it and had a child that was a spoken word child so the reason this this had to come was because of serpent seed was because the devil lied to to Eve and she took of the fruit and so and so and now now man is coming through a means that God allowed for but wasn't the original idea because it was all about the word and faith because your word is who you are and God wanting to reproduce himself has to come through the word right okay so that's a very cool picture and so so so we can look and we can say well the Virgin birth like well that's cool it's supernatural God does things Supernatural like there's all there's all kinds of reasons that we could say and yes we've understood those things but to understand that the word itself is the Original Seed that when God spoke it created life that's that is the point in the heart of God is because each seed brings of its own kind so what seed brings the Son of God there's only one seed that brings the son of God [Applause] it's Son of God seed what's what's Son of God seed word caught caught in the ground of Faith produces children of God because God is his word so the Virgin Birth has meaning because we're looking for a word birth not a sexual born birth and that's why you must be born again and you could ask Lord why do I have to be born again and Jesus could go to Nicodemus and say you've got to be born again don't why don't you understand this Nicodemus it's Jesus's first Doctrine you must be born again and we could go and we could ask denominational friends why do you have to be born again well because you know you need to be born into Jesus okay but but why like can't he he died for me his you know his blood covers is is is is the propitiation for my sins I I'm Justified because I believe on him why is it that I have isn't that enough shouldn't do why do why do I have to be born again what is this Born Again speech that we're even talking about because you must have a word birth in the same way that Jesus had a word birth and I I have been saying this in just every place that I've been Jesus was born we're born again when Jesus was born he was the firstborn among many Brethren the only way Jesus is going to be the firstborn among many Brethren is for there to be many Brethren to have a word born birth that didn't come through a sexual encounter but came because the word came to a heart of faith that said be it unto me according to your word [Applause] the Virgin birth makes sense because we understand serpent seed being born again makes sense because we understand serpency the consequence of your sin makes sense because we understand serpency that you have to die means the sin came in the Life production we also begin to see something that's very beautiful oh you better not even sit down brother Troy this concept shows us it's not about your works if it's about your birth is it about your performance is it about how good you're doing ye must be born again it didn't say ye must do better no is it you must be born again so if you're born again we expect that a word birth takes place and begins to produce and to grow into a son of God but but but production of of of works and performance metrics and how good are you on the scale it all falls away doesn't it it's either you have the right birth or you don't we do expect the right birth to produce something in your life but it is not about the works it is about the birth and I think that's very beautiful Hallelujah we also can begin to understand predestination because let's just face it like if there wasn't two groups of people being created in the garden what's predestination for how was not how is everyone not a son of God and how is everyone not predestinated everyone's name would have been there but no there was someone who came on the earth and was born on the Earth whose name was never written down on the Book of Life from the foundation of the world his name was Cain he was not in the mind of God he was not in the list of God so so so you can have Seth being predestinated and Cain is not predestinated because one was in the mind of God in the original plan of God and one was somebody else's son so predestination that it's in the Bible has to bring us back to serpent seed now we're going to continue on so that this whole sermon isn't just serpent seed but now we begin to and and all of these things begin to build on on one another is because now we can go to Grace straightened out and we can begin to understand that if it's so now we we get ourselves on very precarious place because now you know we can say well it's about your birth as I've just said and it's not about your performance and as I've just said and so now look hey am I not just saying then that you just have to have the right birth and then just go about your Merry way do whatever you want [Music] and and so so I've Been Told by by many Pentecostals like oh I see what it is you believe what oh what's the word um um yeah you believe in once saved always saved and that's almost always said in a negative connotation as in you you feel like you just get the Holy Ghost and boom done you can just go live however you want amen if I actually got the Holy Ghost and my desires changed then I'm going to live how I want and that's the point and that's what we're talking about is that is that this well and so now we get into godhead and you just can't separate these things but if he's actually like if the holy spirit is all that God is and lives on the inside of you that's change that's holding in lasting change and it's not just you trying to do the right Works to maintain your Christianity that's not what we're talking about but that the life of almighty God has come in and straightened my life out justification as though I've never done it and that brings into me also then a sanctification that prepares me for the baptism of the Holy Ghost like this is the process of Grace Grace is not merely forgiveness that's what we want Grace to be just Jesus died on the cross and you can be saved if you accept it Grace there's so much more to Grace is you weren't good enough so I'm going to come and live on the inside of you I'm Gonna Change you I'm gonna make you what you desire to be but don't feel like you have the strength to do Glory Hallelujah so I ask you if you receive the Holy Spirit can you lose it that's what we're talking about if you've received the Holy Spirit can you lose it does Jesus give you the Holy Spirit and then we're going to see how you do nope and then he fell two weeks later and not just one of them little ones like we're talking smack and so God's like well you you didn't do good enough with the Holy Spirit so I'm going to take it back because I didn't know what I was doing the first time apparently I'm going to take it back until you repent thoroughly enough and until you know and there's a six month waiting period or at least two weeks you know we don't need to be extreme um but there's like a two-week waiting period sure hope he doesn't come back in that two-week waiting period before you can come to the altar again and receive the Holy Spirit again see there's problems with this these ideas right so if you're receiving the Holy Spirit he doesn't take it back and if you're receiving the Holy Spirit you have the eternal life of almighty God on the inside of you this is Grace straightened out it's not licensed to sin Romans 5 Romans 6 shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how can we that are dead to sin because there's new life on the inside live any longer therein we just can't do it all right so then we can get to uh to to no eternal hell and this one man this people do not like this Doctrine denominational people will will just they will they're not happy about this Doctrine and there's a reason and so so well let's talk about it for a moment what is hell okay we we know that it was created so it can't be Eternal so that's what we're getting no eternal hell um but but what is it so we go into Souls that are in prison now and brother Branham is preaching and and he had had an accident and his legs were shot and he had a vision as he as he was he was dying and and he had a vision that he was falling through all hell and he's looking around he's looking he cries out for his father and his father's not there he cries out for his mom his mom's not there he cries out for God and God's Not There so what is hell is hell a truly a burning Lake of Fire or is Hell merely the lack of God is hell just alone without him this is what hell is and and and so so here's the here's the idea that we get because of what brother Branham is preaching to us is that we begin to understand that hell isn't just burning as punishment but hell is merely what you've asked God for anyway the prophet teaches us God sends doesn't send anyone to hell you go there and you go over every roadblock that God has put in your way to get there because God is calling out for you he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but if you've come to a place where you say God I know that you want to love me I know that you want to save me but I want to do it my way I don't want what you have for me God I don't want to listen to you I don't want to listen to your word at some point God will say the worst thing God could ever say to you okay have it your way and all God is doing is honoring your request you don't want me around here you go and that's why the prophet says there are souls in prison now because they're already rejecting God he'll never come to them they're already alone and without God and will never be with him amen so then hang on a second because if if their souls in prison now then there must be people who have accepted Jesus Christ who've said I believe your word God I want to be with you the rest of my life and throughout all eternity there must be souls in heaven now and as a matter of fact the scripture says that we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so it it makes the the idea of hell and heaven to be are you with God or not it's actually just relationship that's all right the problem is and and this is look you don't find this Doctrine outside of the message what they'll begin to do is so we let's start building up this picture because we've we're through three doctrines now and so let's imagine we don't understand serpent seat what does Jesus look like I preach to you you don't understand I preach to you you understand there's not really any good reason other than that's just what I want to do because we have no we have no doctrinal way to say it any other way Okay so we've got an arbitrary God who's just kind of picking and choosing and there's no real reason okay then Grace straightened out okay what what is what is that speaking to now now we have a god who's just like hey if you don't do it you don't do it right I'm gonna punish you [Music] and that's because it's not about whether the spirit like Born Again doesn't have as much meaning it's not about is it the spirit of God in you or not it's just don't don't don't you come to an altar and then go back and start sinning again if you do don't even think about yourself as a Christian you've got to perform this Christianity right or you have no claims to him now there's there's I'm there's truth there there's truth there but it's not all truth is it like it's not a real full picture and then as we begin to develop it a little bit more because this grace and it's like no you can't go back out and have any problems you've gotta just continue to do this thing right and if you don't I am going to send you to Hell To Burn and pay for your sins for all eternity and it's amazing how and and and and and and and and I understand I'm I'm king of overselling a point for for the effect I I do get that but we begin to see a picture right we begin to understand because you can go and you can talk to denominational people and they'll get really mad when you start trying to tell them hell is not Eternal and there can be only one reason that I can understand that people will get upset about tell like I thought people would be compassionate you know it's like oh good like hell they're not going to burn forever that makes me feel better like that's that's actually better others people I know are probably going there and I feel bad kind of you know I would think that you know but no it's like no why is that so such a strong thing it's like well because if I have to do it right and they don't then yeah let them burn for eternity because I gotta spend my life being miserable trying to serve Jesus like like I don't I don't understand how else do you say this so but over here we begin to see a picture of Jesus very consistent scripturally based there's a there's a cane and there's a Seth there's two types of people in this world so it so Isaiah makes sense Matthew 13 makes sense New Birth makes sense virgin birth makes all of these things that we understand right then if he's going to come and he's going to live inside of us then Grace is straightened out then it is about that and whether or not he's living through you not a performance and then it is not about eternity and hell because because that was a creation it's got to be the life of almighty God to be eternal and so we can understand and we begin to see the picture that God is just Desiring relationship and when you don't want relationship with him for all of eternity he says okay don't have a relationship through all eternity but we begin to see a picture that this is a very very hard very arbitrary look of Jesus and over here we begin to see one of compassion one of Grace one of love one one of truth that's Desiring you to come to him and see his word that he might live inside of you and so it's a very it's a very different picture here that we begin to see so let's continue on the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now so it's it's um brother Branham continues that he says but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that Christ did that's that's the idea it's not the sensation at the altar that you got when he came into you but it's it's the sensations and I don't want to use that really that word but it's the Life of Christ being performed in your life again and again and again it's not one moment it's many it's not oh I got cold chill and I felt really good and I felt real clean and so and but and then nothing later it's not about that moment but it's about each moment like that moment started it but if it didn't continue on in that the life of God came on the inside of you and began to produce the works of Jesus Christ in your own life then you missed something so to focus on the moment of reception and not the moments that God is dealing with your life and using you for his glory and producing his own life for and manifesting himself in you you've totally missed the points are we together and so over here we can we we can begin to build this picture that it's just like just come to the altar have this moment have a sensation run around the building a little bit and then leave but bless God don't you go and sin any ever if not you're gonna have to come back and probably do that all over again and we'll get to that a little bit too but we also got to go into water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and I love this point because it's about the name of Jesus Christ and and I know I've probably preached this to you before look but it's in the the name that we're baptized in matters because it speaks to relationship because you don't you don't come home and you know call your wife the wrong name you don't come home and just say hey wife like all the time like maybe sometimes you do ironically jokingly you know but but if you were just like hey wife hey and I've I've said this many times like it's like I've told anime I'm like look We're not gonna be that old couple that sits on the rocking chairs is like well mother like well father it's like like that's sweet it really is but I have a name and that name is part of me it's who I am it's part of my character you know my wife has a name and brother Brandon tells us and this is just you know I he didn't exactly get this from the word of God I don't think but I think he just found this from just absolute observation the sweetest sound on human ear is a sound your own name and how sweet will that moment be when God calls your name and he'll do that he'll speak your name before his father and the angels because you spoke his name before all people and so being baptized is a symbol of it's not my identity anymore it's I'm being identified in him who's him Jesus Christ I I'm taking on relationship but but over here we've got no be baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost well who's that well it's God so I'll be Mrs Father Son and Holy Ghost In Heaven or will I be that sounds different very different I'll be Mrs Jesus Christ like this sounds way closer and you might say that different seems trivial well I think if you looked in the mirror and you realized if someone was trying to claim you by titles and not by name it just you wouldn't like it either speaks to a deepness of relationship and finding our identity in him okay so godhead so now we get here because this is this kind of helps us wrap a lot of this up because because if if we don't have godhead right that a lot of these things really really break down and so so as we've been saying so so if you have God as you've got a father and as brother Branham said I used to think that God hated me that Jesus loved me right he used to think that then I realized that Jesus was the very heart of God and in the message titled message of Grace is when he tells us of the vision that he had of the three rainbows where God comes to him and says Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new and so he begins to understand and see that it's not a God on the throne that hates him and a Jesus that died for him and loves him and that a holy spirit that then goes and does stuff in him because we don't know who that is if he's a third like and does he stay is I don't know like that gets that gets pretty sketchy we don't really understand how that happens but if all of them are one and all that was in God was poured into Jesus Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church because of the holy spirit that means that the father that said on the throne the father that said let there be light that's the one on the inside of you not another but that one that's the one who said he'd never leave you and he'd never forsake you that's the one that when you receive it he's not taking it back because he's there with you I will be with you always unto the end of the Earth [Applause] [Music] that's amazing right but here's the problem that we when we get over here and and look and I've seen this I've seen this in message young people and and this is a this is a problem is that even some of our message young people don't understand godhead correctly and and this is what really gets me about this thing because it's so destructive because you have you have young people coming to an altar because they realize they're struggling in their own lives they're struggling with overcoming things and there's so much pressure upon them because they still see a father sitting on a throne with his arms crossed that's saying hey if you don't do it right I'm gonna judge you so you better get it right because if you don't get it right I'm not coming and living on the inside of you in the Holy Ghost I'm not sending my Holy Ghost to you if you don't get it right first and there's pressure and anxiety that comes with that because they're looking they're looking at their own performance because they're afraid of the god that's on the throne and so when you divide him into three you put a God on a throne that's judging you based on your performance but a Jesus that's come and said but it's okay you're basically a loser but I'm gonna die for you anyway I mean he's he's really angry but me I love you and and what we call this and again I'm King of overselling the point we call this oh we call this emotionally scarring Jesus because does he love me or hate me I don't know I'm getting mixed messages here and it's because we don't have godhead right and I've had to counsel young men and say no no no no no next service you don't go to the altar how many preachers have ever told a young man that man I don't want to see you at the altar at the next service I want you to sit there and I want you to talk to Jesus I want the seat next to you I want you to imagine that Jesus Christ himself is sitting next to you and if you don't feel like you're doing it right I want you to tell him that I want you to just have a conversation with someone that loves you just like me just like your friends just like your dad just like your mom whoever it is I want you to have a conversation with Jesus like that because all that God was Jesus was the very heart of God and I don't understand why you're scared of someone that had a heart that produced Jesus Christ because he is one in the same and so I want you to have a conversation with Jesus I couldn't talk to him like that it's like no no no he wants to talk to you like that because he loves you he's not mad at you just wants you to receive him he'll take care of the problems but if we haven't broke into three we've got we've got a father up here that's that's on the throne and he's mad at people and we've got Jesus that loves people and then we've got a holy spirit that that's how God works and and and well and then we can get into well how long like this whole once saved always saved ideas so I had I had um we had some young people that were from a United Pentecostal church and and it's so amazing because they're dressed Holiness there's so many things that we would agree with with them right and so I'm talking to these young people and and I was like okay and he's like oh you believe in once saved always saved I was like well I was like oh so what you're saying is that you can come to the altar speak in tongues receive the Holy Spirit but then if you go out and you fall the Holy Spirit goes away he's like yes exactly and I was like and then you have to come back to the altar and speak in tongues again before you can have the Holy Spirit again he's like yes exactly otherwise you're just you're just playing around it's like I understand what you're trying to say like we should live right but we we but but Jesus redeemed our flesh and put his word on the inside like gave us new life that's kind of the point but but but so so I said but hang on a second we agree on so much I said but but and you all baptized in the name of of the Lord Jesus Christ and you all believe in Holiness and you dress so nice but but but you believe that you have to have you you know you have to speak in tongues to receive the Holy Spirit but but what about the other Pentecostals that are not United Pentecostals and they baptized in Father Son and Holy Spirit and they believe they have to come to an altar and they have to speak in tongues to receive the Holy Spirit and then after they receive they speak in tongues you believe because they spoke in tongues that they walk out of here and they have the Holy Spirit yes but they baptized like the Roman Catholic Church yes and they stood like you don't see a problem with this no no sir no sir speak in tongues so so but but what is your Holy Spirit doing okay there's a there's a sensation there's a manifestation if you will of speaking in tongues but then there's nothing in you to hold you there's nothing in you to keep you what is who did you get if you got the Holy Spirit what was like you didn't get God who said I'd never leave you or never forsake you like you didn't get that so I don't understand what is it the what is the holy spirit to you then so again we can begin to see we've got emotionally scarring God we've got arbitrary God we've got God that's going to burn you're gonna he's gonna send you to hell and Byrne for all eternity if you don't serve him rightly and he won't even stay with you because there's three of them one of them is mad at you one of them died for you to love you and one of them comes and helps you do stuff sometimes but will he stay or won't he I don't know and I mean this sincerely because I've had so like this this I just want you to understand this this sermon is a product of four or five years of me just thinking through these things and saying God I want to unders like like I like I need to see all of these things and and and and and I've had all if you think I'm being insincere at all understand all of these things that I'm saying to you I have been told by other denominational people but over here we get this picture that he says I want you to come to me I love you I want to put my spirit inside of you I want the word to be born in your heart I want it to then grow and flourish out of you when you receive my spirit I'll never take it from you you will be eternally secured but you will not you will not use that as an excuse to go out and sin actually it's it's you're going to feel so terrible about it and you're gonna have to even remind yourself over and over again it's not about your performance because Grace provided a seed on the inside and Grace provided a Jesus that died on the cross for you that redeemed your very flesh so when your flesh fails it's already taken care of the sin question was settled at Calvary but you'll remind yourself that that I am one of his because the word of God has been born on the inside of me and I I because I can recognize and I see the word of God and I am in the word of God that has been revealed to us in our day and it's not just and it's not just some status that we're trying to make sure that you get like oh are you amending the word of God for your day so that we can beside whether you're a message believer or not no what I'm saying is is this Jesus Christ because this is the word of God revealed to us in our day showing us the very character the very Heart Of God expressed to you this is why the prophet came to pull you out you there were there were there were bits of Truth some of these things had truths but because all of them weren't together you got this hard-edged this is very just a picture that isn't exactly complete and it isn't but when you come over here because the revelation of the word of God came to us today God coming in Satan's Eden to woo a bride those aren't words they're reality exactly what he said he would do then he manifests it and when it comes forth and spoken through the mouth of that prophet and comes to us this is what we see and when all truth comes to us it shows us a God we want to love we want to be with and it pulls us out of that not because oh you were wrong because you were in the status that's not why it pulls us out of that it pulls us out of that because that doesn't look good anymore because now that I have all truth why would I stay in a system of some truth that's trying to control me by a status and this message doesn't control You by a status but it's a revelation of the character and mind of and the Heart of almighty God so then he speaks about a pillar of Fire and we needed this Pillar of Fire because it had to vindicate that one that was going to come and tell us these truths and why and wrap up all of these truths and we see a pillar of fire vindicating prophets throughout the scriptures and here we have it in our day and this is the picture that it shows us so brother bran I'm recapping in the pergamian church age he speaks of John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth the word has come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear the word of God that shall he speak a word and he will show you things to come the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word now if I would have started with this this little nugget right here you could have thought many different things you could have thought here we go we've got another one of these message preachers coming saying you got to believe this message are you out amen is that what that's saying you but I think but I think under context of what we've just talked about and this becomes a reality to you how do you reject this how do you say I have the Holy Spirit but this is what I want I want Father Son and Holy Ghost and I want eternal hell I I don't understand how you could say I have the Holy Ghost and believe those two things when your eyes have been made open to this truth so it has nothing to do with you know well did you recognize that the prophet came or not because man that's the ticket Oh I thought it was about Jesus Christ and not about whether or not we decided whether the prophet was right or not it is about Jesus Christ amen and the prophet came and showed us Jesus Christ and the reason that we can see this and say this that the evidence has to do with receiving the word is because this is the amazing picture that is obviously and evidently truth it makes sense from Genesis to revelation but over here that doesn't make sense I mean Matthew 13 Jesus himself speaking to two groups of people doesn't even make sense without the doctrine of serpent seed so you can't make scripture make sense but because God sends us a prophet and goes through these doctrines we see Jesus Christ as he is the Mighty God has been unveiled before us and we see him as he is not in a glass Darkly but very apparently the heart and character of Christ revealed to us in this day how do you say I've got the Holy Ghost but I'm going to walk away from that and I'm going to stay over here it's not status it's not except the right thing and be in our group it's God wanted to make himself known to you in this day and he did and when he does that how would you even think to reject such a marvelous wonderful amazing truth that's what this is that's what the prophet came to do that's what the pillar of fire came to vindicate was to show us this is the one who's going to just gonna wrap up all of these things and the spirit of truth I'm going to the spirit of Truth is going to come and use this this vessel to present to you all of the Mysteries being finished and when all of those Mysteries are finished and wound up you're going to see Christ like you've never seen him before I don't understand why anybody would not want this nor can I understand why anybody would say I want to leave this because I want to I Just Want Jesus this is Jesus many people have been offended by preachers saying this message is Christ but it just is what we're seeing this message is showing to us Jesus Christ musicians you can come I am so thankful I am so thankful to live in a day where we have all truth where the spirit of Christ has come and given us all truth that we can see him to know him to love him to see his love for us how am how amazing is that amen amen can we bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord you're so good to us to open your word and show us Lord All That You Are that we could that we could be a part of the unveiling of God to see you Lord in your love and your grace and your consistency and your constancy Lord How Great and Mighty you are Lord father let your word truly be born in our hearts Lord God Lord Jesus told your disciples and the Pharisees that some can hear and some cannot and God I'm so abundantly thankful my ears have been able to hear this word I did nothing Lord but just be a recipient of your grace and I'm so so thankful father and Lord when [Music] how great it is oh God when our hearts are downcast when discouragement hits and when in our flesh Lord we failed you at times and the Devil comes to us and he tries to beat us down and kick us remind yourself you failed again but father when we can look inside and we can see that little seed of the word of God has been planted and that it doesn't matter what the devil might want to try to do but that'll never be taken away our inheritance is sure God what courage and what encouragement that gives us O Lord Jesus to recognize that we're Sons and Daughters of almighty God hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Lord we love you and we praise you Reveal Your word to us we ask give us faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] [Applause] amen appreciate brother Trevor on tonight amen just a a wonderful thought there the the purpose of God sending his spirit is to lead us and to guide us into not just some truth but uh the Bible said all truth amen and and I just love the way he um uh mention that when they took us through Matthew I believe it was 13 and some of the statements that the Lord Jesus made and I said the only way that Jesus could make this statement is because Jesus understood it um serpent seed Jesus understood it he knew what happened that there were two groups that uh was on the Earth right and that's brother Trevor just began to go through that it just it came to my mind even at his death on the cross two different groups were represented and we have one man that says uh remember me when you come into your kingdom and another man that says uh you know if you really ah who they say you are but why don't you get yourself out of this and also us and uh this one man that was identified with Christ makes the conversation now why don't you just leave him alone me and you are on the cross because of what we have done right we did the wrong thing and that's why we're here this man did nothing wrong he was identified with the words one fellow could not come to repentance at all and um and it showed even at death even at death there was two different groups that were represented uh uh just a real wonderful thought here amen that we have uh before us and we we just really thank the
