And I'm going have you get your Bibles and uh we'll turn to scripture. But as we are turning uh going back to the book of Hosea uh chapter 14, I just wanted to uh give God praise for something that he allowed to happen on yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I was given the grand privilege of baptizing my son-in-law. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God is God is good. &gt;&gt; And um you know I was just just just honored to be able to do that. uh when he approached me this week and said he wanted to be baptized, I say, "Sure, we'll we'll make it happen quick." &gt;&gt; And uh but so yesterday at 3:00 um we took him to the water. &gt;&gt; Take me to the water. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Anybody know anything about that? &gt;&gt; Take me to the water. take me to the water &gt;&gt; to be baptized. Then they say in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. Oh in the name of Jesus. to be to be baptized. Then they say it like this. Say nothing but &gt;&gt; the rightous. Oh, none but [Applause] &gt;&gt; oh my. None but the righteous shall see God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. My God. My God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; I certainly thank God um for that and um just looking for God to just continue to carry him forward uh in his journey. Amen. Um yes, the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then I'm reminded of a a promise that he told me. He said, "If um a thief is caught stealing, &gt;&gt; now you have to catch him." &gt;&gt; If you don't catch him now, he can get away with it. &gt;&gt; But if you catch him, according to the scripture, the thief has to repay you &gt;&gt; double. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I catch you stealing $1, you got to give back. &gt;&gt; You I catch you stealing $100. &gt;&gt; Well, that is something. I mean, that all you got to do is catch them stealing. &gt;&gt; So, if I catch you trying to steal a soul, &gt;&gt; then I'm supposed to get double. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; God's word never fails. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's turn here to Hosea uh chapter 14 and uh we will continue our journey. Amen. Through this subject on the restoration of Ephraim. Amen. Always good to see sister Boyd. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. Uh Hosea 14 verse one says, "Oh Israel, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord. Say unto him, Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously." So will we render the cows of our lips. Uh Asher shall not save us. Uh we will not ride upon horses. Neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands. Ye are our gods. For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. I love this promise. I will heal their backsliding. I will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him. Uh I will be as the dew and unto Israel. He shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his shadow shall return. They shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine. The scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." Uh who is wise? and he shall understand these things prudent, and he shall know them, for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them, but the transgressors shall fall therein. Let us have a word of prayer um over this. Father, we thank you for your word that has been read. Uh but God, it takes the Holy Spirit to help us to apply what we've read to where we are right now. And I trust Lord Jesus that you would speak to every heart uh through uh the word. Take control over every thought that is being presented. Take control over every thought that is being received. And Father, we ask that you would just come and have your way, Father, in this portion of the service. Thank you for everything that has happened thus far and uh just asking God that you would uh you would speak to us now in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated in the presence of the Lord. Uh again we are taking our journey uh through this subject the restoration of Ephraim. Amen. And um as I mentioned um we were last time we were together we were just talking about just the history of Ephraim. Uh Ephraim is and when we're talking about the restoration we're not talking about just an individual. We're actually talking about uh a group of people a tribe if we can put it that way. uh because Ephraim his roots come. He was one of the sons of Joseph that was born uh in Egypt and um you know there Joseph was placed there by uh a dream that God had given him years before and he ends up down there um and the way he got there just it wasn't uh pleasant but God turned it for his good and uh and he got into a situation where he became second in charge in the country. uh his family was restored to him. His daddy, you know, uh when he saw Joseph's sons, he wanted to bless those boys. And when he blessed them, he crossed his hands in the blessing. And when he crossed his hands, uh Ephraim was the younger son. And the blessing actually went to the youngest son. And Joseph was trying to stop his daddy from doing this. Like, no, you're not supposed to do that, daddy's like, "No, no, no. God has crossed my hands, right? And I believe brother Mark had uh told me, you know, he says, you know, when you think about that, uh even I think it was Jacob and Esau coming out the womb, right? And Jacob was the younger son, right? and uh and and and and and when um uh Jacob Jacob actually stole the blessing and the birthright and everything from his brother, but God had allowed all that to happen, right? God had told his his mother that that he was supposed to be blessed. So, you start seeing these things just kind of flowing down, you know, and from generation to generation, these blessings and and no matter what your position is, you're still going to get a blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Amen. But but but we see the history of Ephraim and and then we get down here to the book of Hosea and uh this tribe of Ephraim has found themselves in a very um uh I want to call a separated place from God. They're so bad off that God makes a statement uh over in Hosea 4. Uh and I let me just get the slide here on this one. Uh let's see here. Oh my. Yeah. Uh the slide is slide five. He makes this statement here. It says uh for Israel slideth back as a backsliding heer. Now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place. And then he says Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone. And I and I that those those that statement is so strong to me that God get to a spot where I don't want anything to do with you because of all the idols that you're worshiping. Right? I I just don't want anything to do with you anymore. But but here, you know, we know that God is a God that's gracious. Uh God is a God that is forgiving. God is a God of love. He don't like us to frustrate his grace. He don't enjoy that. Right? But but but but but uh but he is a God that actually, you know, he told us there in what we read in in Hosea 14, I'm going to heal your backsliding. Now, I know you backsliding and you separated from me. You join the idols and I really don't want nothing to do with you, but I'm going to heal your backsliding. It also goes to show that really it's not much we can do. We need we need God's grace. We need God's love. I I mean, if we didn't have that, we'd be finished, &gt;&gt; right? We we really need God more than than you more than you need anything else. You need God. Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so we thank God for this promise that he's given. But as we go forward here today, um I want to slip over here to uh I think it's going to be slide uh 13. Let me just make sure. Nope. Let me um Yeah, I think I uh we we Yeah, we caught this. This is where we ended at uh on our last time. Slide slide 14. Slide 14. Slide 14. Okay. The verse there is uh Hosea 14:8. Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? Uh I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." and and and and what we find here in the Bible, uh the green fur tree or or the green tree often symbolizes life, vitality, uh and the enduring presence of God. It's a metaphor for resilience. And as I was telling you all, uh you know, sometimes you have to see yourself as a green fur tree. No matter what I'm going through, I'm a I'm a green fur tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm resilient. Give up ain't in me. &gt;&gt; Quit and going back ain't in me. Come on, somebody. And I'm gonna be established in the winter time. I'mma be established in the spring. I'mma be established in the fall. In the heat of the summer, I'mma still be in the same spot. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I I I mean, when I'm going through, you're going to find me in church. When I'm on the mountaintop, you're going to find me in church. When I'm in a valley, you're gonna find me in church. No matter what the situation is, I'm a green fur tree. &gt;&gt; It's a metaphor for for resilience, especially in the face of adversity and can represent hope, divine blessing, and I love this, and restoration. And and as we were saying, when you just look at the book of Hosea, just where it's placed in the scripture is just in front of the book of Joel. And we know the book of Joel is a book of restoration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Here another uh statement here is that evergreen uh trees are characterized by their year round foliage meaning they retain their leaves or needles throughout all seasons. I love that. Don't never fall off no matter what's going on. Uh and a AI summary. Amen. In a Google search it said evergreens often symbolize immortality and eternal life because they return retain their leaves throughout the winter. And then the next thing it says it also symbolizes eternal life and the promise of ultimate restoration. Amen. In the scripture I I like that statement. I'm like a green fur tree because they're saying it symbolizes ultimate restoration. Now, now, now, now, and I know that um you know, we as I I brought this out the last time some of the brothers got together and we were talking about ultimate restoration and what that looks like and and and I think I think there's certainly a lot of angles that we can take on that. Uh one of the ones I believe Brother Solomon brought is is we as sons of God, ultimate restoration for us is to come back to that place that God had for us at the very beginning. Brother Brandham said God had a three-fold purpose. He wanted to reveal himself to his people. He he says also he wanted to have preeminence in the people. And then the third thing he wanted to restore them back to Eden conditions again. Certainly that's ultimate restoration for the believers to come back to eating conditions again. I I don't know about you but I like to exercise amen. My um my rights &gt;&gt; a a as as a son of God and as a daughter of God, we should exercise our rights sometime. And and and when we had prayer this week, one of the scripture that the Lord gave me for the brothers is, you know, if you say to the mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou removed &gt;&gt; and don't doubt in your heart, &gt;&gt; the Bible say you can have what you say. &gt;&gt; And and so when I'm exercising my authority as a son of God, I'm going to have to let some things come out my mouth. &gt;&gt; I I got to expect heaven to back up what I'm saying. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but but but we we we see something here that ultimate restoration is promised to Ephraim. And we want to look at this from the angle of Ephraim. What does ultimate restoration look like for Ephraim? Stay with me this morning. All right. Um this next slide gives another definition from Benson Bible commentary. They're they're commenting on this very verse of uh uh Hosea 14:8. And in there when we read it again, Ephraim should say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." Now, now this is just another angle that they're giving on this scripture. Amen. And they're they're saying it is I not his idols who have heard his petitions and watched over him to preserve him. So they're saying it's God that's that's watching over him and to preserve him. It says I'm like a green fur tree. If these be understood as the words of God, the meaning is it is I who am ever existing and have it in my power to give my people blessings at all times. Amen. &gt;&gt; I got power to give blessings at all times. Cuz if this is speaking of God, we know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That would be like a fruit tree. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That that I I I'm telling you, sis, that's that's when when it's year round, it don't matter what season you are in life. You still going to get a blessing &gt;&gt; when things are going down. When the economy is down, [Music] &gt;&gt; but you belong to God. You still in line for a blessing. &gt;&gt; It It's not based on economy because he's a green fern tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We we can see God and and just in nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It says this. It is it is I who am ever existing &gt;&gt; and have it in my power to give my my people blessings at all times. &gt;&gt; As the fur is evergreen and flourishing and afford it shelter not only in the summer but in the winter too &gt;&gt; when all the rest of the trees are stripped of their leaves &gt;&gt; and can and can afford no shelter at all. In other words, as a weary traveler finds rest and safety under under a a green thick and flourishing tree, so there are safety and refreshment under the protection of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe that and I thank God for his divine protection. &gt;&gt; Just a little statement from the prophet in this message where I think Pentecost fell. He says, "Well, then over on this uh other side of the hill, there's a little tree standing there." Says, "I'll be leaning back under that tree, listening at them, listening at them singers singing over there." Glory to God. Glory to God. Uh I'll be I'll be leaning back under that tree, listening at them. You see, that's where you'll find uh it says, "Oh, if I if I could only sing." Now, now I think somebody had made a a mention of that. And I I I I know I they got a they got a a singing tape of Brother Brandham um just singing in prayer lines and you know nothing I praise God. I I I certainly appreciate but the prophet all he's told us &gt;&gt; that that is not his gift. said, "If I could only sing." That's what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "I said there's one song &gt;&gt; that I always wanted to sing and love it so well, that's amazing grace." He said, "And I I never could sing." Oh my sist. So when you all get over home, a lot of you maybe if you happen to go before me &gt;&gt; and you're living in your great big fine place over there, I'mma be a a poor man &gt;&gt; with two houses &gt;&gt; on this side. &gt;&gt; He said when you if you're living in your great big fine place over there &gt;&gt; and you hear an echo &gt;&gt; coming across the hill somewhere, look over on the other side of the hill. &gt;&gt; You'll see my little hut down there somewhere &gt;&gt; among &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; evergreens. You'll see my little hut down there among the evergreens and I'm standing out on the front porch singing Amazing Grace. How sweet the sound. You say, "Well, praise God." Oh, Brother Brandham finally made it. &gt;&gt; So, I'll be over on the other side over there with amazing grace. We need God's grace. Ain't no way we gonna make it without his grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said he going to be on the other side underneath the shelter, the the the shade of the evergreens. See, this evergreen, there's something special about it. The way God designed this tree and made this tree, something special about it. But Ephraim identifies themselves, Amen, there with this this evergreen tree. Even though they've gone through this season of of idolatry, just just just I mean you you I I don't have a a better word to put, but some of the things they got themselves involved with, it was it's and and not only them, but some of the things we find ourselves getting involved with, &gt;&gt; it it's idolatry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It It's idolatry. And and we got to be ever so careful uh cuz cuz you know, God is the one that wants the glory. God is the one that wants to honor. He He He designed us to be able to give him glory, right? But but some people make cars they idols. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you can make a house your idol. &gt;&gt; I mean there there's so many things we get involved with. Your job becomes your idol. More important than church. &gt;&gt; I mean so many things that people fail to fail to put God first in. We don't we never want to be guilty of any of those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Again, this this uh Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him and observed him. I am like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." And and and I pray that you would even see yourself. And it's like, you know, rather than just saying, "Ephraim shall say, Jack shall say, &gt;&gt; what have I to do anymore with idols?" God, I don't even want these things in my life anymore. Free me from this stuff. &gt;&gt; And the Bible even says that sometimes, you know, uh we have to lay aside every sin &gt;&gt; and every weight that so easily besets us. &gt;&gt; So some things in your life might not be sin, &gt;&gt; but it's a weight. &gt;&gt; It weighs you down. &gt;&gt; You got to get rid of the weight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we go forward just looking at what this ultimate restoration looks like for Ephraim. Brother Random gives us something here in the Sardisian church age. It says in Genesis 35 verse 23- 26, &gt;&gt; the sons of Jacobs &gt;&gt; were 12 in number and their names were as follows. Reuben, &gt;&gt; Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon, Joseph and Benjamin, Dan and Napali, Gad and Asher. These 12 sons &gt;&gt; descendants become the 12 tribes of Israel with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after him. It says uh for in the pro providence of God there were to be 13 tribes &gt;&gt; and Joseph's two sons were given the honor of bringing the 12 to 13. &gt;&gt; You know of course that this was necessary as Levi was separated unto God for the priesthood. Thus, when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the tabernacle in the wilderness, we find the tribe of Levi ministering to the 12 tribes named Reuben, Simeon, Issachar, Judah, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Napali, Gad, Asher, Ephraim, and Manasseh, the order of the host of them. Thus, amen. In Numbers 10 11-28, there is no mention of Joseph or Levi. We're studying how this ultimate restoration for Ephraim. Let us go forward. Now, brother Brandon just gave us the history. I'm just kind of reiterating what he said. The history of the 12 tribes. He gave us Genesis 35 verse 23- 26. And this is really the birth order of the sons of Israel. Sons of Israel, sons of Jacob. Same person. His name was changed from Jacob to Israel after he wrestled with God. Amen. He got a name change. Some of us need to wrestle with God so we can get a nature change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need to have a wrestling match with God so our nature can be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When when when Israel or Jacob wrestled with God, his walk changed. &gt;&gt; His testimony changed after he had an encounter with God. And and what we need is a Holy Ghost encounter. &gt;&gt; It changes everything about us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Like I I mentioned a few weeks ago, we don't want church just to become a sound, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; People people can go to church and they hear the music just uh revved up and and the musicians playing a certain thing and they feel like when they hit that we had church, but they go out living the same old ungodly life &gt;&gt; after they've had that experience. Church has simply become a sound to people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church should be an experience &gt;&gt; where you experience God. You hear his word. Something that purges you from the inside. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Random brought out Genesis 35 23-26. This birth order of the 12 tribes of Israel and or the sons, I should say, the sons of Israel. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Napali, Gad, Asher, these 12 sons of uh of Israel. But then he also brought to us in numbers 10 uh 11-28. This is the Exodus. And in in the Exodus uh we see the the tribes in this order. Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Reuben, Simeon, Gad, Ephraim, Manasseh. All right. Uh, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Dan, Asher, Napalia. What we see from uh the first list is we see no Joseph and no Levi. They were in the first list, but here in Numbers, as they're going out leaving, Amen. Mount Si and and and when they're moving, Amen. And when they're moving from Mount Si, this is the story of them moving with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I love because in the wilderness journey, you you you had to know where God was. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You had to know where God was. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if they were at a certain mountain this day, but they could see God lift up the cloud of glory lift up and begin to move in another direction, you couldn't stay where you were and expect to experience God. &gt;&gt; No. God had moved on from there. &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go a little further? &gt;&gt; God has moved on from denominations. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Even though people go back and they they say, "I felt something." You might feel a little bit, but you'll never have the fullness of God in a denomination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is trying to get you out of there. You got to be able to recognize when God moves, you have to move. [Music] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel learned this this this this this process is that when God will lift up and begin to move, they packed up everything they had. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they begin to move with that cloud. And whenever the cloud would settle, that's where they would settle. And no, how no matter how long, it could be a month, it could be uh h five years, it could be five days, but when that cloud move, they move. &gt;&gt; Somebody need to understand when it's time to move with the cloud. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. People just don't have that no no that that understanding anymore. You know, when the cloud moves, you move. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have that who move my cheese mentality. &gt;&gt; We think the glory going to come back, &gt;&gt; but God has moved on &gt;&gt; and you better move with the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here when they're coming and they're moving. Amen. And uh in the Exodus we see Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Reuben, Simeon, Gat, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Dan, Ash, Nefali. But no Joseph or Levi is mentioned here uh as in the tribal order. No Joseph or Levi. And brother Brandham just told us that it was God's providence that he would have 13 tribes. And then what happened with Levvis? They begin to be the servants or they they serve the other tribes through the offerings and things like that. Hallelujah. That's what happens with a a minister. When he's called to uh h to be a minister, he's called actually to be a servant. Let me say that again. When a man feels a calling to the ministry, hallelujah, I I remember uh brother Eve told me this years ago, God rest his soul. When I got called to the ministry, say, "Brother God, just make you a greater servant." I say, "Praise the Lord." And sometime we get we get called to minister, we think we got some type of position over the people. No, it's not a position over the people. Hallelujah. It's you become a more of a servant to the people. God can actually trust you to serve his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in any situation that they find themselves in, you got to be able to serve. &gt;&gt; That's what ministry is all about. &gt;&gt; So when he call a man, he call his wife. And the wife also has to be able to serve the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We all that that's what that's what this whole call is about is about service. the children. Amen. The the the tribe of Levi was serving the other tribes. &gt;&gt; And through their service, God actually took care of them for their service. &gt;&gt; God blessed them for their service. &gt;&gt; God will bless you for your service. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. &gt;&gt; Let me go on and and I I'll say this because some people here, well, that's what the pastor for to serve. To serve. Now, don't take advantage of the service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't take advantage of it now. Glory to God. And you find yourself in something all the time. &gt;&gt; Are you in a ditch all the time? &gt;&gt; Something wrong here. &gt;&gt; Are you sheep &gt;&gt; or goat? &gt;&gt; Cuz the pastor serve sheep. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, &gt;&gt; glory to God. You find goats kicking and bucking. Uh-uh. No. No. No. This ain't no. Uhuh. No. We looking for sheep. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me go on a little further. &gt;&gt; So, we see these these tribes and we see Joseph and Levi missing from the tribal order as they're moving through uh in the Exodus. We see this. Let's go on a little further. Brother Brandham tells us in Sardisian church age when we look at Revelation 7 verse 4-8 &gt;&gt; where it says they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel. It names thus Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Napali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin. It says we're back to the 12 tribes with Levi and Joseph named among them, but with Dan and Ephraim missing. Just hit next on that. Now, you know, I I'm I'm I'm giving you just a couple scriptures and and this is one thing I'm gonna say. I thank God &gt;&gt; that he sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; I would not be able to share these things with you. It'll just be information in the Bible, &gt;&gt; but no connection at all. But when a prophet comes on the scene and he begins to reveal things to us, we start seeing more than we ever saw before. &gt;&gt; That's why he said after the seals were open, he said the Bible became a new book to him. &gt;&gt; How could you go into Hosea 14 and pull all this out &gt;&gt; because of a prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just gave us a couple scriptures. He took us to to to Numbers, took us to Genesis. Now, he's taking us from Genesis all the way to Revelation. &gt;&gt; All right. And then when we get to Revelation 7, this is tribulation period. Hallelujah. And and let me just forewarn uh some of my young people, you don't want to miss a rapture. And and just in case you don't know, the hour in scripture that you are living in is the hour where you can expect a rapture, a changing of your body &gt;&gt; to be called up to meet him in the air. And and and now that needs to happen before the Jews receive Christ as their savior, &gt;&gt; right? And and the Jews already are are are already talking about, you know, trying to find I mean I mean there's Jews already uh coming in and accepting Christ. I mean, some of them are Messianic Jews are accepting this already. Hallelujah. But but we know there's a greater work that's going to happen and it's 144,000 going to be dealt with. This is promised in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it happens during the tribulation period. But when those God begins to deal with the Jews in the tribulation period because the same gospel that they rejected in order to give us an opportunity to accept the gospel. Now this gospel is being rejected by us Gentiles and is going back to the Jews. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When they get it, God's going to call 12,000 out of each tribe. And notice the tribes that he would he would call. Hit next on there for me. It's going to be Judah, &gt;&gt; Reuben, Gad, Asher, Nefali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulon, Joseph, and Benjamin. And look now in this order in book of Revelation chapter 7, there's no Dan or Ephraim that's being dealt with during the tribulation period. No Dan, no Ephraim. &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position? &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position? &gt;&gt; Why? I mean, before we we we saw them in ex I mean in the Exodus, they were there. But now at this time in scripture when when God is dealing with the Jews through the the tribulation period, no Dan, no Ephraim. &gt;&gt; How did they lose their position? &gt;&gt; Let us go a little further. Brother Brandham gives us the answer to how they lost their position. It goes back to a scripture out of Deuteronomy 29 verse 16- 20. &gt;&gt; And I and and I want you to notice because brother Brandham tells us, and I'll read it later, he says, "The same way God remembers his good promises, he also remembers the bad ones, too. God remembers every promise that he that he that he that he has given, &gt;&gt; you know, um I mean over in Deuteronomy 28 when when you when you when you follow the Lord and you follow his word, you know, he actually makes you promises that that my God, you'll be blessed in the city, you'll be blessed in the field, you'll be blessed going out, you'll be blessed coming in, you I mean, you'll just be blessed. Yes, sir. But also in that same chapter, if you if you keep reading, it's a long chapter. There are more curses when you fail to follow the word of God &gt;&gt; than there are blessings when you do follow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here we find Deuteronomy 29. For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the nations which ye passed by, and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood, and stone, silver, and gold, which were among them, &gt;&gt; lest there should be any am lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of these nations. Now, now he he's I mean, here Moses giving him instruction like y'all done seen all this this this this negative stuff, these nations that God have destroyed because of their idolatry. He's destroyed them and given you their land. &gt;&gt; Now, here you going to turn around and go and serve some of the same gods that God gave you their land. Come on now. Something wrong with this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And and and and if I could just make it plain, you know, how you going to get delivered from something and you give testimony being delivered from it and then you go right back into it &gt;&gt; here. He he God gives some instruction through through Moses. Lest there, verse 18, lest there should be among you man or woman or family or a tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the God of these nations, lest there should be be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and wormwood. &gt;&gt; And it come to pass &gt;&gt; when he he curse that he blessed himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst. drunkenness. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have peace when you're serving the devil. I can tell you that right now. &gt;&gt; The the the the uh the way of a transgressor &gt;&gt; according to the Bible, &gt;&gt; the way of a transgressor is going to be hard. &gt;&gt; Don't ever think you're going to get by when you choose to serve the devil. Right? &gt;&gt; You might be like the the rich young ruler &gt;&gt; who rejected Christ. And the Bible actually says his barns got so small, he had to build bigger barns because of all the money and all the stuff that he'd accumulated, he had to build bigger barns. And while he was building, maybe got finished and was enjoying everything he had, he died. &gt;&gt; And the scripture say, "Oh, fool." Because he did not consider what was going to happen after he left here. And he ended up in the Bible say in hell he lifted up his eyes. &gt;&gt; You don't win serving the devil. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have all kind of blessings or feel like you got blessings on this side, but when you lift up your eyes in hell, you're going to realize it didn't pay off to serve the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here the ver the Bible says this. And it come to pass, verse 19, when he he curse, that he blessed himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst, the Lord will not spare him. But then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name &gt;&gt; from under heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, what happened here? The reason that we didn't see Ephraim and Dan there in the book of Revelation as one of the as two of the tribes that will be dealt with during the tribulation period because their names was blotted out under heaven. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This scripture that if you turned and went into idolatry, your whole tribe could be affected by going into idolatry. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And therefore, the reason you don't see their name listed is because they got involved in idolatry, even from to his idols, let him alone. &gt;&gt; Because they're involved with idolatry, they were not dealt with during the tribulation period. But remember, we're looking for ultimate &gt;&gt; restoration. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. &gt;&gt; I thank God that that that that restoration can go beyond the tribulation period. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh, I'm going to say it again. restoration can go beyond the tribulation period. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we don't we when we dealing with God, you we dealing with something mighty here. &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Brother Brandham says, "Note particularly that the punishment for idolatry for idolatry &gt;&gt; was that the name of that tribe &gt;&gt; was to be blotted out &gt;&gt; from under heaven." &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 29:20, which we just read, he said, "It does not say it would be blotted out in heaven, &gt;&gt; but from &gt;&gt; under heaven." And that's exactly as it is for now, Israel is back in Palestine. And soon the Lord will seal 144,000 of them. But from that number, Dan and Ephraim are missing. &gt;&gt; How did they get to this spot where they were missing? Let me just camp here just for a little bit. Just stay on that slide. Little history of how Israel got into this state. Let me take you back on a little journey. the time that Solomon became king of Israel. I mean, he was considered, I guess, would be the third king. You have Saul as their first king. And and um Saul was disobedient. And and do you know that his disobedience actually the scripture says his disobedience was as the sin of witchcraft &gt;&gt; and I believe idolatry, right? So his his disobedience was as the sin of witchcraft. God looked at that really really bad. So bad that God rejected him as king. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; God wants complete and full obedience to his word. &gt;&gt; Do you know when we have full obedience to the word that entitles us to the token? &gt;&gt; Right. So so so so uh here you know Saul being their first king but Saul Saul got rejected. God raised up another king. His name was David. Amen. David becomes the second king of Israel. and and and and David was uh was known to be a man after God's own heart. I'd rather have that testimony &gt;&gt; over my life than anything else. I want to be known as a man that's going after the heart of God. &gt;&gt; You ought to be known as a woman that's going after the heart of God. &gt;&gt; David David has a a very positive testimony of God. Even though David sinned with Basheba, he repented and um you know and and God just had a beautiful relationship. Uh brother Brandham said you can see the life of Christ just typed all through David's life. A beautiful be beautiful servant of the Lord. But David had a son even in his sin. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Even in his sin, David gets Basheba pregnant and has a son from Basheba after he had done killed her husband. The man was wrong. Just dead wrong. &gt;&gt; But even in the midst of this mess, &gt;&gt; God did something special for David. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It shows you that when God forgives you, then God forgives you. &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing that nobody can say. No, nothing that nobody can do when God has dropped it into the sea of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Brother, like nothing ever even happened. &gt;&gt; He gives him a son from this this this adulterous relationship. &gt;&gt; And causes that boy out of all the boys that David had, he caused that boy to be named the next king. Solomon gets this position and and and I mean we can there's so much we can talk about there. I mean Solomon had a gift in his life. &gt;&gt; Solomon was wise. Solomon was Solomon was was one that when God came to him in a in a dream begin to talk to him say you know what do you want? &gt;&gt; You know you can you can have this you can have that. What do you want? It's it's it's got to it's got to come out of your mouth as to what you want. You can be the richest, you can be this, you can be that. Solomon said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. God, God, I tell you what I want." He says, "I just need some wisdom &gt;&gt; to be able to discern things here in this and to be able to kind of help your people. I I'm a servant to the people. &gt;&gt; So, I I I need wisdom to know how to serve." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; God said, "You know what, Solomon? Because you ask for wisdom, &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you both wisdom, money, and popularity. The richest king to ever live. Because he asked for the right thing, he got all God all all God wanted for. &gt;&gt; And after he got this this this this wisdom, the very probably next day, he's sitting in the court and a challenge comes before him. A a case &gt;&gt; comes before him. In this case, and let me just mention this to sisters, you can choose what kind of woman you want to be. &gt;&gt; The life that you live, you choose what kind of woman you want to identify with. &gt;&gt; Because Solomon had to deal with a couple women &gt;&gt; and these two women had a lifestyle of uh prostitution. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and they became roommates. And and but but but let me just go a little further. Amen. Because everybody that's involved in prostitution might not want to be involved in prostitution. &gt;&gt; Some of them might have a a real Amen. some real character in them and just you don't know how people get into some of the conditions at the end. So you just can't judge everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the way we can tell that one of these ladies was a little different &gt;&gt; because these two prostitutes got pregnant at the same time, &gt;&gt; gave birth to babies at the same time. And when they gave birth to these babies, Amen. Uh, one lady is is is is in the room with her baby and and she lays on top of the baby and smothers the baby to death. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when she does that, she sneaks into the other room of the other lady and she swaps the babies. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when they woke up in the morning that this this lady say, "This ain't my baby." "Yes, that is your baby. This ain't my baby. That that's your baby. You done killed your baby." Lying to her. So, we going to have to take this to King Solomon. &gt;&gt; They bring the case before Solomon. Solomon say, "Uh, oh, this one saying this is her baby and the other one saying this is her baby." &gt;&gt; We don't know who baby it is. He said, "I tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Bring me a sword. and we're going to cut the baby in half and we're going to give half to this mother and half to that mother. &gt;&gt; And one of the mothers say, "That's right. Cut the baby in half." &gt;&gt; Let me let me also just interject this before I go a little further. If you got people that don't mind splitting the church &gt;&gt; and don't care about the conditions, this church gonna split and you don't care nothing about it. You like that mother in the story. &gt;&gt; But the other other mother said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't don't cut the baby in half. &gt;&gt; Let let her have the baby. &gt;&gt; Let her have the baby. Don't cut the baby in half." And when Solomon saw how that mother responded, he said, "He knew who the mother was." &gt;&gt; Your actions say a lot about who you are. That's right. &gt;&gt; All these great things. Solomon was considered the king of the golden age of Israel. &gt;&gt; A lot of powerful things happened. But what happened in Solomon's life is his standards begin to drop. As he got older, &gt;&gt; his standards begin to drop. &gt;&gt; And Solomon began to marry women from foreign countries. Now, he's supposed to stay just with the women of Israel and and all that. And even he got I mean, Solomon had 1,000 wives. I don't know what what man. No man can handle no 1,000 women. Can't even handle one. How you going to handle a thousand? &gt;&gt; Right. It it shows, you know, just the passion that he had and the lust spirits that he dealing with and everything else, right? But but but here you know Solomon as he got older, Amen, God used him to build the temple for Israel, the first temple. But but he also built temples for his foreign wives. &gt;&gt; And God had given him instruction. Don't marry one of these foreign women because they're going to pull your heart from God. &gt;&gt; Young people, be be careful about who you get involved with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will pull your heart from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Years and years of life of misery. &gt;&gt; Here Solomon gets himself in this situation. He's he's married to these foreign women and and worshiping with them and building building h temples. I mean Solomon is in is in idol worship. The very same man that built the temple for God finds himself now at the end of his life in idol worship. &gt;&gt; Because of this idolatry, God came to Solomon. You find this in First Kings 10. Uh because of this idolatry, God comes to Solomon and tell him said, "Because you did this, because you did that, because you did this, I'm going to split this kingdom and your son going to be still ruler over a couple tribes, but but I'm going to split this kingdom." And you know, because because he said, "I'm not going to do it while you're still living, but your son going to have to go through this because of the things that you've done." &gt;&gt; You got to be careful. your your your actions &gt;&gt; affect your family. &gt;&gt; Things that you do, things that you say impact your family. &gt;&gt; And sometimes things go on for generation after generation and it started somewhere. That's why if you can do something right for God, let that be that let that legacy begin to flow in your family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Solomon &gt;&gt; ends up dying and and and and and before he dies, God has already given him a uh a prophecy that hey, you're going to lose half of your kingdom. You're going to do this. Now, what happened? Solomon had a young man that was in his kingdom. I believe the Bible called him very industrious. &gt;&gt; His name was Jeroboam. And uh Jeroboam was just gaining favor with the people and everything. And Solomon recognized this. So Solomon began to try to go after this guy. So Jeroboam end up running to go to Egypt to get away from Solomon. But on his way running, hallelujah. Jerobom gets a prophecy. Actually before he left to run from uh run from uh Solomon, he got a prophecy by Hija I believe his name. He say he say now God is going to Amen. take some of the kingdom from from Solomon and he is going to use you to be the leader of this other group. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a king to this other group. Jerb has a prophecy &gt;&gt; that he's going to be the leader. He takes off running from Solomon. He goes down into Egypt. And I I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what happened. What happened while he was down in Egypt? Because the same Jerobone that's given the prophecy that you're going to be the leader, &gt;&gt; he led the people into idolatry. &gt;&gt; That that that that strikes me, &gt;&gt; man. You've been prophesied to by almighty God. &gt;&gt; When when God gives you a prophecy, &gt;&gt; oh my my &gt;&gt; if God tell you you going to be the leader, There is nobody &gt;&gt; that can take that from you. &gt;&gt; When God has given you the word, there is nobody. I don't care what they do, &gt;&gt; they can't take that from you. &gt;&gt; People be scheming and doing all kind of things, but they can't take it when God has given that promise to you. &gt;&gt; Jerobam was living underneath this promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the things and this just just my own imagination. Maybe by him going to Egypt. You know what Egypt represent? &gt;&gt; The world. Maybe by him going to Egypt he got contaminated. &gt;&gt; While he was waiting he got contaminated &gt;&gt; and that affected his thought process. &gt;&gt; Now Solomon dies. Jeroboam comes back. Solomon's next son, Rahab, is becomes the next king in Israel. Jerobone comes back and he has a conversation with Rahab. Says, "Look, your daddy was pretty hard on us. Could you just lighten the load just a little bit?" And Rahab had two groups of counselors. &gt;&gt; He had the older counselors and he had the younger counselors. And the older council say, "Yeah, if you want to keep the kingdom all within, you know, you better get you better you better lighten the load of the people because you can hear the complaints of them now. Just lighten their load just a little bit." But Red Bone say, "Well, what what y'all young fellas got to say?" The Red Bone Red Bone say, "You know, the young young fell say, tell them your daddy won nothing. &gt;&gt; You you going to feel a scorpion power now. I'mma show you what real leadership look like. I'mma put my foot down. Let me let me just just just just park there for a little bit. Sometimes when leaders are stepping in, how you got to know how to handle certain situations &gt;&gt; and you kind of you try to come in like Rayaboom and put your foot down, you'll lose the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hello. The older counselors was trying to tell them just just be patient, just be wise, just wait on this. Don't go trying to change everything when you become the leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say, you know, you know how to cook frog. If you want to kill a frog and cook them, people eat frog leg. You know the best way to kill a frog and cook him. Says you got to put him in water that he's comfortable with. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then you got to slowly &gt;&gt; turn up the heat. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you if you put him in and it's too hot, &gt;&gt; he going to jump. &gt;&gt; And when you see people jumping because you done turned up the heat a little bit too hot. &gt;&gt; Is that all right, church? &gt;&gt; All these things are in the scripture. But but Raome had was given some he didn't realize that the advice that he was taking from Amen these these younger leaders or younger advisors the advice that he was taking was actually causing a prophecy to come to pass. &gt;&gt; And here the nation was divided. Jerobone took one group. Rayon took two tribes. The other 10 tribes went with Jerobone. Two of those 10 tribes that went with Jerobone happened to be then and Ephraim. This next slide tells us what Jeroboam did. Remember, Brother Brandham says, "The tribe that turned to idolatry &gt;&gt; was to have its name blotted out blotted out." And notice now blotted out under heaven, not in heaven. &gt;&gt; The history of those of the two tribes whose names were blotted out because of idolatry is found in Kings 12. First Kings 12 verse 25-30. Brother Brandham is reading the scripture. &gt;&gt; Then Jeroboam &gt;&gt; built Sheckchum. &gt;&gt; Where is he built it at? &gt;&gt; In Mount Ephraim. &gt;&gt; And dwelt therein. and went out from then and built Pinuuel. &gt;&gt; And Jerobom said in his heart, now remember God had given him a prophecy, you're going to be you're going to be king. And if I' if I've established this, if God has established this in the heavens and now it's coming to pass on earth, there's nothing Jeroboam need to do to worry about whether the people going to go over here and do this and do that. Oh Lord have mercy. Let let me just read it. Jeroboam built Sheckchum in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from this and built Pinuel. And Jerobom said in this art, "Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David. If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of his people turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rahab, king of Judah, and they shall kill me and go again to Rahab, king of Judah." Can I put it in uh uh current day terms? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, uh I uh we don't want to encourage people to go to certain meetings because they might go there to those meetings and see things going on that church and actually get pulled and want to go to that church. &gt;&gt; So we won't say anything about the meeting meeting of another church. We'll just keep doing what we doing. &gt;&gt; We'll just isolate the people over here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when God has given you, Amen. and assurance of your your leadership. You don't have to worry about the people going nowhere. &gt;&gt; They'll come back home. I'm telling you, because they know where they get fed. [Music] &gt;&gt; They know where they get fed. You I mean, let them go and enjoy themselves. You don't know what God will do in that meeting atmosphere for the people. They come back better Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to be afraid of these things, &gt;&gt; but Jerobom type leadership, &gt;&gt; you're afraid of who they go around. &gt;&gt; Don't go to that meeting. I'm not going to announce that one. I ain't going to say nothing about it. I'mma act like it don't even exist. &gt;&gt; Watch that. &gt;&gt; Watch. Watch what you're doing there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that type of leadership don't last. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. I I I try to let people know about whatever going on. I want you to be blessed. &gt;&gt; I want you to be blessed. Amen. And and and I realize, look, I mean, uh we all got different angles that we bringing it bringing the word to you. You know, all the different ministers got different angles, but you know, sometimes we can bring another minister in with a whole another different angle and it's a blessing to the people. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's good to have other ministers come in because it it help you to see that God is speaking to you right here. He'll come and use that minister to say something she already heard. You're like, "Look at God." &gt;&gt; Jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of David. This is if this people go up to sacrifice to sacrifice &gt;&gt; uh uh if this people go up to sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem. Now, now I want you to also notice God had established a particular place for the people to go. It was in Jerusalem. Oh my. God has a provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; Can I tell y'all where God wants y'all to worship? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Is that in the Bible? He is seeking those to worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Now that's just not a church name. That is a real place in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody can come to a place where you're worshiping in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Now, I will say this. The name of the church should tell you something. Um, and they shall kill me and go again to Reabon, king of Judah, whereupon the king took counsel, and look at what he did. Made two calves of gold. Do you know anything about the history of of these people? Do you realize when Moses came out the mountain, his own brother had made a calf &gt;&gt; and God destroyed it and you going to lift up two calves again? &gt;&gt; Whereupon the king took cows and made two cows of gold and said to them, "It is too much &gt;&gt; for you to go up to Jerusalem." That that's a long journey. Don't take that, y'all. It's hours and hours of driving and and it's just it's going to be such a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Behold thy gods, &gt;&gt; oh Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And and and the sad part is they fell for it. These ain't the gods that brought us out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; And remember I told you this man was spending time down in Egypt. I think maybe he got twisted down there. Why he was waiting on this prophecy to come to pass. Look at this now. Which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And he set one in Bethl that was Ephraim. &gt;&gt; And the other the other one he put in. So the two calves of gold idolatry Ephraim to his idols. Let him alone. They're calves of gold that they're going to worship saying these are the gods that brought us out of Egypt. This is why their names are not found in Revelation 7. Dan or Ephim because of what happened here way back in the book of Kings. &gt;&gt; God remembered it. &gt;&gt; God remembered it all the way down to on the other side of the rapture &gt;&gt; that they will not be dealt with. &gt;&gt; But remember I said ultimate restoration. &gt;&gt; They're not dealt with. Their names were blotted out under heaven, &gt;&gt; but not blotted out &gt;&gt; in heaven. Amen sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. It says he set one in Bethl and the other one he put in Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan. And then Hosea 4:17 Brother Brandham brings this in Ephraim is joined to his idols. Let him alone. I told you I thank God for a prophet &gt;&gt; because a prophet go and get all these little secrets and and helps us see the whole picture &gt;&gt; here in the Sardisian church age. He makes another statement says, "However, after this period of tribulation, during the millennium, as seen by Ezekiel in Ezekiel 48:1-8, as well as uh verse 22- 29, we see the tribes back once more in divine order. But from the from the time that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to idols, they died. And those tribes have have no more recognition. Now I realize that since the destruction of Jerusalem, all records of all the tribes have been lost. So that no one can say for sure what tribe he is from. But God knows &gt;&gt; that great God who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from &gt;&gt; and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing. Hosea 14:8 again says Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him. &gt;&gt; Now, Benson said, "Maybe that's God talking, but I I like to I I look at it from a different angle. This is me talking. God, I've heard you speak to me." &gt;&gt; Ephraim can say, "I've heard you speak to me. I have observed him. I'm like a green fur tree. From me is thy fruit found." Remember there in the AI summary at the bottom it says this this this this green fur tree it it it it was uh it symbolized eternal life and the promise of ultimate restoration in the scripture. Well, we just saw how they lost their position. They will not be dealt with. Amen. In the tribulation period that because their names was blotted out under heaven because they went into idolatry. Jerobone gave them a a idol god to actually worship and they went to that god worshiping and they the whole tribe was in idolatry blotted out from under the heaven. But Ezekiel a great prophet saw what was happening in the millennium which is on the other side of the tribulation. There's a rapture, there's a tribulation period and there's a great millennium. That's what we're living for, church. That's what we're living for. And here's here's where we see this restoration of Ephraim. My there's a lot of things when you when you um when you sow bad seeds, you're going to reap &gt;&gt; bad seeds. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever man sow. &gt;&gt; That's what he going to reap. &gt;&gt; So you can't sow bad and expect to reap good. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You sow bad, you're going to reap bad. And Ephraim went through a lot of stuff in this earth. But I tell you what, I tell you what. When God say, "I'mma heal your backsliding," &gt;&gt; God is looking well beyond. I I know I I Oh, Lord have mercy. This the story just kind of come to me about the the preacher that Brother Random talked about. Um, somehow the man got so discouraged he just stopped preaching and and gave up on his ministry and and stopped serving the people and and went to work and and one day brother Random's down there at the store I think getting his or the um uh not the store but uh the mechanic getting his car worked on and the man said, "No, I'm not serving the Lord." He said he said, "You ought to go with me sometime to the field, brother. You ought to go." He said, "No, I ain't serving the Lord no more." He says, he says, "No, you're just kidding, brother." Said, "No, no, Brother Brand. I'm I'm done with that. Brother Random went home and just uh you know after he said he just couldn't get it off his mind. He said the man say I'm done with it Lord. No he man can't be done with it. No Lord I I got to do something. He went back down there. He said brother you said that you was done with this. You're not serving the Lord. Let me say brother Brandham I'm not done. I'm done with it. I am not serving the Lord no more. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I just can't. Now being a prophet, brother Brandham, God could have showed him what happened in that man's life to get him to that point. You some people get so discouraged in their walk. You don't know why they in the position that they're in. But brother Brandham said, he says, "I just couldn't understand. I just prayed for the brother, but I I couldn't understand." He say, "A few days later, that same man, the accident happened in the garage and the man died." &gt;&gt; Now look, the man had just told the prophet, I'm done with it. I ain't serving the Lord no more. Now, in our minds, if a person backslides and they ain't serving the Lord, that's it for them. They're going to hell. That's that's what we that's in our mind. But a prophet &gt;&gt; a prophet says that God actually had to destroy that man's flesh &gt;&gt; in order to save his soul. &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe that man made it." Look, you're going to pay one way or the other. If you belong to God, he ain't going to lose you. &gt;&gt; But you might lose, you might have a short life &gt;&gt; because of your disobedience to God &gt;&gt; because you can't separate from your idols. &gt;&gt; Thank God. I mean this restoration of Ephraim went beyond the tribulation. &gt;&gt; This restoration of Ephraim actually was was found in the millennium. &gt;&gt; You think about all the things that they lost on this side of of glory, &gt;&gt; but yet they could not be lost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I mean, when you go all the way back to when when when when when uh when when when uh Jacob his Israel had his hands crossed praying, he says, "Let his name, let Ephraim's name be named among mine." &gt;&gt; When he when he made that prayer, we look all the way down into Ezekiel and we find his name is named among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You talk about ultimate &gt;&gt; restoration. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I'm I'm encouraged, church. &gt;&gt; We got loved ones that are still out there and not serving the Lord. And and sometimes you look at their conditions and you look at their situation, you wonder how what what it's going to take in order to get them to come in. I don't know. But I do know the prophet said this. He said somehow &gt;&gt; majestic fingers will untangle the knots. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he say, "Mama, don't worry. They'll be there at the table. Daddy, don't worry. They'll be there at the table. God will bring them in." Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Prophet prophet told us everything I loved &gt;&gt; and everything that ever loved me. &gt;&gt; He said God has given to me &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm I'm just crazy. If if he would say it, I don't believe God was just saying that to him because God has no respect &gt;&gt; of persons. He was a servant to get a bride ready. And if if if if I if the servant got that type of promise, what you think the bride going to get? &gt;&gt; Everything I ever loved &gt;&gt; and everything that ever loved me, &gt;&gt; God will give them to me &gt;&gt; there. Hallelujah. This restoration goes beyond the tribulation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This restoration, this season that we've been in, of restoration goes well beyond the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Let's read this. Brother Random says that in the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; he says, "See Ephraim at &gt;&gt; Bethl &gt;&gt; and Dan, they set up idols &gt;&gt; and there there went out to worship this and here we are plumbed down into the millennium age almost." And God stills remembered that sin. They're not even counted in there. Amen. Glory. Just as sure as he remembers every good promise, he remembers every evil one, too. Just remember that's the reason I believe friends I've always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems. See now they wouldn't think about that there then they didn't think about it then. So this what he's saying when they got involved in this idol worship they didn't think about the implications. And sometimes young people when you get involved in certain sins you do not think about the implications of that sin. &gt;&gt; There will be implications. You know in in in the in the book of uh Genesis uh with Adam and Eve, God told them the day you eat thereof, that day you die. &gt;&gt; There was implications from them getting involved in sin. &gt;&gt; Look, see now he says they wouldn't think about that uh that there then they didn't think about it then. And that's the problem. You don't think about because the devil don't show you that. The devil just show you how much pleasure you're going to have, but he don't show you the implications. It says they thought well they got by with it. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you'll never get by with sin. &gt;&gt; All right. But the Bible say, "Be sure your sins &gt;&gt; will find you out &gt;&gt; and what you do in darkness. &gt;&gt; It's going to come to the light. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, help me." &gt;&gt; Epstein list, &gt;&gt; what you do in darkness, &gt;&gt; it's coming to the light. And people going to press till they see light. &gt;&gt; And then when they see light, &gt;&gt; oh y'all, y'all come on y'all. I I I I I I I I I was telling the preacher, man, I I try to stay away from political subjects in the pull pit. I I really do. Cuz there there is there's no salvation in politics. &gt;&gt; None. Ain't no politician going to put you in heaven. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; And this is why brother Brandham said, "I vote for Jesus." &gt;&gt; It's wickedness on both sides. &gt;&gt; Just wicked, wicked, wicked. That's right. &gt;&gt; You you if you put the Democratic party in in in in in position, they would be pushing the homosexual agenda like crazy. &gt;&gt; Changing laws and everything. &gt;&gt; And we got confused by bathrooms. How did that happen? &gt;&gt; We don't even know what a man and a woman is. No. Come on now. This is ridiculous. &gt;&gt; But then we get the Republican party and we get a Yeah. pedophiles &gt;&gt; and and yeah, you just wait till the list because you know when you've trafficked all these young girls and they realize what you've done, somebody's going to do time for that. &gt;&gt; And that's why one guy did time, but he you know he knew he was going he he knew &gt;&gt; and they said that he let me get out of this. &gt;&gt; It just it's filthiness. It's just filthiness. &gt;&gt; And and I ain't going to put no politician in heaven or hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only God can do that. &gt;&gt; A I I don't care what you do. &gt;&gt; You can't do this one thing and live like &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so I ain't putting no politicians in heaven or hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. Glory. Just as sure as he remembers every good promise, he remembers every evil one too. Just remember when that's the reason I believe friends I have always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems that uh he says see now they wouldn't think about that then they didn't think about it then they thought well they got by with it all right but here they are over here in the millennium age setting in when their names and tribes is blotted out from it because they served idolatry that God cursed. Didn't he say he hated the nickelans and and that Jezebel? Stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say he killed Jezebel's daughters with killing of death, which is eternal separation from his presence? Don't trust in it at all. He's talking about don't trust in the denominational system. Don't trust in it all. Get away from it. When he's saying get away from it, that is Revelation 18:4 happening. Come out of her, my people. move with a cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get away from it. He says, "So God &gt;&gt; remembers." We find in Ezekiel 48 verse 1-8 as as well as verse 20 through to 29. This is Ezekiel seeing the tribes in their tribal order during the millennial reign. After the tribulation period, now it's during the millennial reign. He says, "Now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of of Hethlon as one goth to Hamoth, Hazernand, the border of Damascus, northward to the coast of Hamoth. For these are his sides east and west, a portion for Dan in millennium, we see Dan's name is represented. His tribe is there even though he was in idolatry." So we saw actually through this restoration of Ephraim, we also saw the restoration of &gt;&gt; Dan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says it says and by the border of Dan &gt;&gt; from the east side unto the west side a portion for Asher. Now this is in the millennium, &gt;&gt; right? This is this is so under heaven is what happened here on earth. But in heaven, this is what we're talking about in heaven. They were not blotted out in heaven. just under heaven. &gt;&gt; And by the board of Dan from the east side and to the west side, a portion of Ash and and by the board of Asher from the east side, even into the west side, a portion for Naftali. And by the And by the board of Napali from the east side and to the west side, a portion for Manasseh. And by the board of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for &gt;&gt; Ephraim. This is the restoration &gt;&gt; of Ephraim, the ultimate restoration. And by the border of Ephraim from the east side unto uh even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben and by the border of Reuben from the east side and to the west side a portion for Judah and by the border of Judah from the east side and to the west side, etc. Brother Brandham says he goes on and then he moves on down to verse 22. Moreover, from the possession of the Levites, from the possession of the city begin being in the midst of that which is uh which is the princes between the border of Judah and the border of Ben Benjamin shall be for the prince. As for the rest of the tribes from the east side and to the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion. And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side and to the west side, Simeon shall have a portion. And by the border of Simeon from the east side and to the west side, Issachar have a Issachar portion. And by the border of Issachar, from the east side and to the west side, Zebulon a portion. And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad a portion. And by the border of Gatside, southward, &gt;&gt; etc. What we see is that God has restored Dan. God has restored Ephraim in the millennial reign. This is the ultimate restoration. &gt;&gt; That's when all sin is done. &gt;&gt; Thousand years just my no sin just Satan is bound for a thousand years. You talk about just enjoying &gt;&gt; life. &gt;&gt; And there's going to be one more battle after that. &gt;&gt; But we already promised to know who going to win that battle. And then there's a new heaven and a new earth. You just so happen to be living during the time where you can expect the rapture of the body before all this settles in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And my prayer is that you won't be missing at that great getting up morning. &gt;&gt; Let me read this last quote. I thank God I was able to get through this. &gt;&gt; I got one minute left. This last quote in the seventh seal, brother Random says, "Notice." Did you notice there it was to be blunted out why? Under heaven there was no immediate sacrifice that could give him the Holy Spirit to let him see these things. But he did it anyhow in his own selfish mind. So back back there when Ephraim and Manasseh I'm I'm sorry, Ephraim and Dan did this, there was no Holy Spirit. There was no sacrifice that was given for them at that time. Christ had not come and died. This is why they were blotted out from under the heaven. Don't do you realize how important the grace of God? How important the blood of Jesus is? Cuz when you think about some of the things we did, &gt;&gt; we should have been wiped out a long time ago. &gt;&gt; But thank God for his blood that covers us. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his grace that keeps us &gt;&gt; under the heaven. There was no immediate sacrifice that could give him &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit to let him see these things. But he did it anyhow in his own selfish mind. But Ezekiel in his vision in the millennium, he sees them again in perfect order. Ezekiel, if you want to read it, just put it down and you can read it to save time. Ezekiel 48 verse 1-7. Also read 23-29. Ezekiel seen every tribe just exactly in order. And when Ezekiel seen them in perfect order, what he saw was the restoration of Ephraim. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; My my my I told the Lord, thank you for your word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending us a prophet &gt;&gt; that we could go into scripture and pull these things out. &gt;&gt; God is a good God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Musicians, you all make your way up. Father, how blessed and how privileged we are God, just to be able to take this journey and not only see Ephraim but see ourselves in the midst of it. And when we see ourselves, we see uh the abundance of your grace, the abundance of your mercy, God, that to to to a promise that can be given to us and we can see it in scripture that restoration even went beyond the tribulation because Ezekiel saw them in tribal order, perfect order in the millennium. Father, if you could see that for for Ephraim, what can you see for our loved ones? Help us to get a glimpse of this and how powerful this is, how powerful this promise is, Lord, that we would just begin to pray and commit um things into your hands, God. We know that you you do all things well. We also know that you told us that in scripture, no good thing will you withhold from those that walk upright before you. Let us turn from our wicked ways. Let us turn from our idols. Let us turn from our sins, Father, that you would be glorified and you would be exalted and you be magnified in and through us. Father, how we appreciate you. how we love you, how we exalt you, how we bless you. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Do we have the words?
