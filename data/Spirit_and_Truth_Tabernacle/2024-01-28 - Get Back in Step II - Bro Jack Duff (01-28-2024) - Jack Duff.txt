there are times we look down life's journey we see uh two sets of PRS and then other times we only see one set of PRS and Lord the question was asked why did you leave me when it was only one set of Prince but that was that was a misunderstanding because you told them no I didn't leave you but that's the time that I carried you Lord we need you to carry somebody Lord carry these families Lord uh

him strength and comfort in this hour in jesus' name uh we pray also while we're praying we want to ask that you would bless the word of God today as we prepare our hearts to receive it uh may you use it to bring glory and honor to yourself and help settle our Spirits so that we know where we are and who we are in you it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen God bless you um thank you musicians I will uh end there um while you are getting your Bibles uh did want to say thank you to brother Troy for handing the uh the the the song service amen this morning I certainly appreciate uh him just always being a ram in the bush amen uh brother Solomon had something that come up on the schedule so uh weren't able to be here today but we thank God Amen for all things um go back to the Book of Joel amen that's where we will uh take uh our our thought from while you're getting it um Joel 1 and Joel 2 but um I did want to say it's so good to see brother Jeffrey amen uh on today amen amen La last time I saw him um he's he's surprised me I was over there in in um uh uh Sarasota and brother Jeffrey come and tap me on the showed I said brother Jeffrey um but uh he said he was looking to come back and amen just uh come and come and join us in fellowship and so good to have him Amen on this morning uh in in in Fellowship God is God is good uh we had a um our meeting on um on Friday night and there were a number of things that were discuss but uh two big things that I wanted to make sure you all were aware of one of them is I got a I got to thank um some brothers for the efforts on yesterday uh brother Calvin uh brother Maris um brother Xander and brother Xavier um brother Garen brother Quinton Jr brother Quinton senior Amen brother Troy uh they went in we had two Bab and we had told you all on Friday night that uh we were paying roughly $11,000 a month for those bays and uh but they said if we would just move our stuff into another Bay then we could probably cut that in half and I think we were we projected that we were going to go from $1,000 a month to $570 a month and uh that was that was a real blessing but what happened on yesterday is um that the project section of 570s that we were going to have two uh Bays really the same size again but uh what happened on yesterday is that brother uh Calvin anointed in this uh area he stacked stacked it so high and got things in there so tight that we did not need to purchase another Bay the same size so there for amen we reduced it even more and uh where we thought we would go from $1,000 a month to 570 I think brother Quinton told me because of what brother Calvin brother Garen brother Troy brother quinton's uh the two Quinton uh brother Maris brother Mark I forgot about him brother Mark uh and uh brother Xander and brother Z year because of what they did I think our bill going from 1,000 a month to like 413 all right you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah and and you all know what happens that when we save money y'all know what happened with the savings it just goes right into the building fund but that's roughly $77,000 a year savings so we want to thank them brothers for their efforts on yesterday uh what a blessing they were uh to to the church amen what a blessing it was to the church and the other thing those that uh may not know uh the church did vote in a second Deacon that will be under trial uh he'll uh the scripture says that the deacons have to be proven first before they are ordained uh but brother Simba uh Mami has been voted in as a deacon here at the church praise the Lord and I know you don't see him today brother Simba is uh a student and he has to travel periodically to New York to class that's where he actually goes to school at in New York so sometimes he'll have to miss but I think he got about 6 months left in his schooling and he'll have his master's degree uh so Hallelujah yes uh God is is doing great things amen God is doing great things so um I think that's all I need to announce for right now um I want to read from Joel chapter 1 uh and verse 4 and then Joel 2: 23-32 um thank the Lord hallelujah uh the Bible says that which the palm of worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath the caner worm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten verse 23 in Chapter 2 it says and well um I said verse 23 but can I go back to verse 21 fear not Oh Land be glad and rejoice why and now here the thing about the scriptures that that you have to do things be before you see things can I say that again you have to do things before you see things uh let me drop this uh for some of you while we are in this spot it's not a part of my sermon but I'll give this to you for free Amen on today sometimes if you want to see your finances increase you have to give first you don't wait till your finances increase to give you give from your need and you see your finances begin to increase uh some of you all might not have heard some of the testimonies but we've had uh in this church two testimonies that's come forth of of recent of people that have received over 20% and 30% increases on their jobs raises that are just unheard of but but go and and I feel like this when I hear testimon like that I start thinking man the the the the angel is troubling the water and I'm jumping in on this I'm I'm getting some of this and I'm I I I do not pass me by that's I start praying like that Lord Don't Pass Me By I see what you doing I know what you can do Hallelujah and see in this season we not taking lateral moves all right come on now we we increase not decrease increase all right church but uh but sometimes in order to get something you got to give something I've seen it I know people that have accepted the challenge to give a certain amount in an offering every week and the ones that have accepted that challenge they were doing it before they got the increases but they accepted that challenge and I watch God bless them Hallelujah rather than say I can't do it just take a step of Faith yes Lord it might mean you might not be able to go go to Cracker Barrel or something but take a step of Faith hallelujah hallelujah you might have to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich sometime but take a step of Faith hallu but but but but in order to get something sometimes you have to give something the Bible says fear not o l be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things Be not Afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the Wilderness do spring for the tree bear her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength amen it's not unfruitful right be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain and I I take it personally in the first month all right and there are some testimonies that have happened in the first month and and and you ought to say to yourself this month ain't over yet it ain't over it ain't over yet and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you amen my God and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrous with wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed let's just stop there in our reading uh you may have your seat um we are uh still in our journey of get back and step amen uh get back and step and um you know this this theme of uh I will restore say the Lord is uh where we are drawing amen our attention to um just a few comments just to open us up here the um I won't read these particular quotes but I'll just kind of refer to them um brother brandham took his inspiration for this sermon the restoration of the Bride tree uh after he heard brother Neville preach a sermon and uh and at the end of brother Neville's sermon he made a statement about being restored and uh so that struck the prophet and he went and picked up a dictionary and just start looking at what restored meant and not and he found the definition in in Webster to restore means to return to the former owner or to bring back to the former state of condition this simply means that you used to be somewhere and uh through life circumstances and situations it's pulled you from where you used to be and uh and God has promised that I'm going to restore you look at this now not I'm going to replace you no you can't be replaced but I'm going to restore you I'mma restore your mind I'm going restore the way you used to think I'mma restore the way you used to live I I'm going to restore you actually I'm going just put it this way predes the the uh there's a root that's laying you in you that's been predestinated by Almighty God and when the devil eat up your leaves when the devil eat up your branches when the devil even eat up your bark Hallelujah there is a predestinated root and in the predestinated roote the promise of restoration lays right there so somehow God going to have to bring back your bark God going to have to bring back your branches and God going to have to bring back your leaves I don't know how and I don't know when but God God said it I believe it that settles it other thing I I know when God said it settle whether you believe it or not Hallelujah but brother random tells us to restore means uh uh to return to the former owner to bring back to the former estate of condition and it says and we can enforce a claim to be restored glory to God Amen and you know um he says we can enforce a claim to be restored and and I was just mentioning how you know we have to uh in this season move from being on the defense Amen to going on the offense and when and when you're on the defense you are constantly trying to guess or respond to everything that the devil's trying to do Hallelujah but when you go on the offense you make the devil try to guess and respond to everything that you're doing Hallelujah a lot of teams they have more confidence when their team is on offense than they do when they on defense amen you even get more confidence in yourself when you are on the offense rather than being on the defense and and and and sometimes what going on the office looks like is grabbing a hold of a scripture amen no matter what you're going through in your body but begin to quote that scripture over your situation amen no matter what you're going through in your family begin to quote that scripture over your situation Hallelujah I know devil you got this one doing that and you got this one doing that I see all that but God told me that if I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said he says I would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and then he said the promise Not only was for to me Hallelujah but it's to my family amen those that are far off as many yes the Lord Our God shall call sometimes going on my office is just quoting a scripture Amen in your situation and Watching God change things because he said it you know these brothers uh when brother Brandon you know talked about enforcing his claim you go back and you listen to it you know on on on the uh on the tape but he was making a statement says we got the privilege Hallelujah to enforce upon Satan the the claims that God give us all right he says uh he says this you can pull this one up if you want to sis and I'm I don't I didn't get the exact but just put uh privilege to enforce amen privilege to enforce it might come up right there but we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us amen for God has a law and his word is the law Hallelujah and look at that says and God in this word and he's important to the Bible God in this word made certain claims to the church see that's so important to me God made certain claims to us and and and and and and I I I used to hear Brother Wesco always preach about how we Liv in a million miles beneath our privileges we we we we don't have to accept everything the devil do oh hallelujah amen he said we and and he said he says um uh he says he says God in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right all right Amen to force these claims upon Satan I like this statement and say and say and say not just think about it but you got to open up your mouth and say give it back oh Hallelujah give it back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees now see this is how we actually amen go on the offense amen it's by going down on our knees and say is thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all cuz the holy spirit's there to make him do it yes I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm convinced that this is a season where we're going to see amen as we operate on the offense you're going to see the devil giving some things back I'm convinced of that I I I said I'm convinced as we go on go down on our knees and we say we got a right and we going to claim our rights as Sons and Daughters of God you're going to see the devil give it back your your finances going to be restored if you was at a certain level financially if you was at a certain level and you don't watch things start to dwindle you need to tell the devil I ain't accepting that give it back God don't take from me like that no God go God adds God multiplies God don't subtract that's the devil coming against you and you got to Li up and speak your promises God promised to meet every one of my [Applause] needs you said I I I wouldn't I wouldn't be a b I'm going I'mma Be the Linder I'm going be that's going in and coming out I'm not accepting this from the devil make the devil give it back and God got a million ways to give it back to you you don't know what God to do but open up your mouth tell that devil give it back even in your health speak to that Devil he's the Lord that Health all my diseases even the ones the doctor ain't got no two or two God Is A Healer the devil has to give it back hall praise God but brother Brandon when he was saying these things the the testimony that he gave behind it was uh he says you know when when brother um uh I can't think of his name right now but the brother had a his car was stolen at church amen and and uh and when when his car was stolen at church he says that he um the brothers were trying to figure out what to do this man got all his clothes in the car his family is depending on this and and like what what what we going to do say well we going to go down on our knees and we going to pray and uh and they took a scripture and stood on a scripture when you pray always try to use the scripture in your prayer use the promise that God gave you remind him of what he said when you pray come come on church this is how you go on the offense by reminding God what he said oh my finances are ti God but you said you would rebuke to devour for my sake you also said you would open up the windows of heaven and pour me out a blessing where I had room not enough to receive God I'm looking for you to do what you said I can't do this on my own but I believe what you said and I'm quoting what you said Hallelujah it said you know and uh uh they they begin to pray and they had a scripture that they standing on it says um if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you shall ask now now in in order for you to ask you got to open your mouth MTH right in order for you to ask you got to actually open your mouth and say something praise God Amen but but he say say if if we abide in you come on y'all know y'all been abiding I mean the devil done threw everything he could they say like the devil threw the kitchen sink at you and you still standing you know you've been abiding you ain't thought about leaving and going nowhere no I mean you done told the devil many time I'm just have to stay right here by myself if I got if I got to stand alone I stand alone you've been abiding in this word God has giving you a promise if you abide in me and my word abide in you then open up your mouth and ask what you will and it will be given to you man they took that scripture yes sir they believe what God Said that man needed his car back right right right I'm not going out here to buy no another car I done bought a car bring my car [Applause] backen hallelujah amen he stood down on that word and they prayed and and and when they prayed God opened up a vision and showed the prophet say oh your car going to be found in this certain spot you going to have half a tank of gas but you're going to get everything back Hallelujah glory to God and and and all they did was stand on the word he says we went on that pretty much when they when they when they went on their knees they went on the offense and they made the devil give they enforced their claim as a Son of God and they got back everything the devil tried to take I don't believe that was just for uh the brother I can't think of his name right now Lord knows I can't think of his name I don't think that was just for that brother that's for us and when brother Brandon preached is a sermon that God God inspires him to tell that same story in the restoration of the Bride tree we got to we we got to stop looking at just another sermon but no this is for us take hold of God's promises now can I tell you something we done got out of step with the promises and we got to get back in step with the promises amen hallelujah amen glory to God I I was I was telling you know some people just the other day you know they they I'm coming here preaching a sermon and then right next door I see Satan trying to take one of the minds of my neighbors and um and they come knocking on the door and and and any time the the that come somebody come pray and they know that you know we we church people so somebody come pray somebody do something anoint the house do do we'll do whatever we need to do yeah but I hear one thing I I I I told him I said now I don't see in the scripture what the what Jesus wrestled with devils and I believe in the even evil spirits I believe in them I I know that they exist but Jesus Ain't Never Wrestle with him see what Jesus did was actually spoke or he just sometimes Jes just Hallelujah you know when you got when you know your Authority when I'm I'm telling you when you know who you are in Christ you don't even have to speak to a devil a devil ain't even worthy of you saying nothing but all you got to do is he just pointed at devils and they left that same God dwells inside of [Music] us you ain't got to raise your voice with no devil you know who you are as a son and daughter of God amen amen amen I mean even even our kids know you know uh they done cross the line amen and you in a situation where you really can't say nothing Adam you know at that time because we in public I can't say much to you but there is a certain look Hallelujah that you can give that child and just by looking at that child they can read your eyes they can read your facial expression and they know to get without you even saying sit down man that y to get somewhere and [Applause] just I mean they stop everything and they just your look tell them sit down somewhere and they know because the authority that you have in their life they know to obey that they know don't even go past the look [Applause] don't go Pastor look cuz you'll know what can happen amen you got that same Authority as a Son of God and as a daughter of God to look at that devil point to that devil praise His holy [Music] name and if I open open my mouth you know it's over glory to God that's it brother that's why brother bham tells us this and um you know in the restoration of the Bride tree I'm going going forward here uh with this he says the law of the land is to enforce is by the land amen for the land by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that see the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God right they belong to God right and you unrightfully deceitfully these websites that people is getting on [Music] deceit and and people don't even know that they got trapped into a spirit exactly unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them so everything that you face and everything you see that's outside of the will of God you can enforce upon Satan he got to give it back he's got to give it back Hallelujah I I I I I believe that as uh I was sharing with you this uh thought I was reading from the the sermon proven his I mean listening to the sermon Pro well reading I should say proving his word and brother brandom had made a statement in there and uh I was just one once I saw it I said oh Lord this is going to be our inspiration for the next year you know as we go in and uh I'm I'm going to be hitting this from so many angles but I that's why I was encouraging the brothers the last time say if the Lord would just give you a little inspiration just to hit it you know a little bit too brother Brandon preached this sermon I will restore say the Lord I want to say roughly nine or 10 times and then he uh preached restoration of the Bride tree but uh and then he pick it up in different places and just kind of hit it and uh it's very I think very important it's not you know I I I I I I've been around church for a long time where sometimes a sermon like this is preaching is just getting the people excited that's not what the the the the objective is I will say this if the word can't get a person excited then I don't know what will but this is more than just getting you excited this is actually helping you to find your place cuz often times all we do is just come to church we come to church and we go right back out and face the same old devils and and get defeated all all over again when we going to rise above that and the word is what actually to help help Propel us above our circumstances the word does it right so so so here you know brother Brandon was uh was was was making a statement here and I want to just bring it because this is where we get our inspiration from uh about getting back in Step he says he proves his word in every age he proves his word in every age by the most unusual way he says but he always does it in the same way now now think about that he proves it in every age by the most unusual way but he always does it in the same way now look at this he goes on and says what did he do in the days of Noah impr proving his word what did he do in the days of Noah when he's F when he's fixing to to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah now when he says that he always does it the same way that means when God get ready to do something he always sends a prophet and now now here's the other thing when God a man sends a prophet he also predestines that there will be a people on the Earth that will believe that Prophet yes Hallelujah and he also knows that there's going to be other people on the Earth that's going to reject that Prophet Hallelujah but he never changes the way he does things he always sends a prophet look at this now it says what did he do in the days of Noah my God this is so important to me I mean look look you know we all look we we all we can look at Noah daning man he built this great Ark and uh and and if I had been there I would have been on the ark that's the way we think but I'm going tell you your actions right now when the word comes in your day and the way that you respond to the word in your day it actually tells us what you would have did in Noah's day you realize Noah's message was it was strange it it was it was this was nobody saying these things I I can go from this church to that church I never hear nobody say the stuff that Noah is saying where he even get this from it's going to rain we ain't never seen rain in all our years how how's it going to rain and then somebody say why we need Noah oh oh somebody might might might might put a website out why do we need Noah what's the purpose of having Noah and and when they're doing that they don't realize what they're trying to silence the voice of Noah come on somebody I I'm saying something amen don't allow somebody to silence the voice of the Noah for your day yes sir oh his his name might not be Noah Moses name was not Noah but Moses was necessary to the people of God brother Bam's name is not Noah and his name is not Moses but his ministry was necessary to the people of God oh my God my God it's it's not the man it's the ministry because the ministry is coming from God oh thank you Jesus praise the name of the Lord amen the ministry was sent by God ordained by God I'm trying to get somewhere I'm trying to get somewhere just show scripture I want to show some scriptures here where where we standing at amen but here you know um it it's important that we understand God don't change his pattern right God don't change his way of doing things if he sent a prophet back in Noah's day he would do the same thing today Before Destruction before before amen the world just and right now it is in chaos but before I mean everything is lost God sends a prophet yes Lord and that Prophet is there to pray uh try to get the people back on the word of God I'll look at this now he says what did he do in Noah in the days of Noah when he's fixing to deliver the remnant he sent them Noah the prophet he sent Noah a sign and now notice when he comes to deliver the children of Israel what does he do his same way he s his Prophet Moses is what he's talking about His prophets got the word the signs and wonders of the word promise backs it up that's that's that's it's exactly the truth Israel made her March to the promised land because they believed it they believe what Moses said they believe Moses was sent they made their promise they made their marks to the promised them watch it now he says and in the wilderness Journey oh I that's why I just I I like these little comments uh that the prophet says because we we we're in the same spot we there were people that believe this with everything Hook Line Sinker they knew this message was right they KN they knew there was nothing out there amen that can compare to it we knew where we came from yes I wasn't born in this message I was born in Baptist and then uh through through marriage we got introduced to Pentecost so we got we got a taste of both we was going to a Baptist Church but when Grandma said we had to go with her to clean the church we went to the Pentecostal church and man it was tissue everywhere tissue all over the church I mean what a and we just we didn't have gloves back then y'all don't know y'all don't know nothing about nothing we didn't have no gloves back then and and now grandma say pick it up and we go and pick it up back we we go to the church ain't no piano no organ just one big bass drum come on somebody and then we saw what is that over there lady got I don't even know what to call it a washboard y'all young people don't know nothing about these instruments but they get in there and they start singing some of them songs like brother tro was singing this morning and all you got is a bass drum in the [Applause] [Music] washboard and and why you do that my granddaddy over in the corner over there shouting up something I even remember my granddaddy lost a leg he had a fake leg but he was still over there shouting in the corner with a fake leg and sometime it got in it got in his way so he'd take it off over there shouting on one leg my granddaddy yes sir I mean they knew how to have church yeah praise God but but but you know I mean uh uh when we when we look at all of that uh I mean I thank God for for that I wasn't born in this message so I didn't I didn't know nothing but but but when I got the Revelation understanding what the message was all about when I saw it from the scripture then I realized what God was doing and just like I just said in Noah's day it was a message that they had never heard before they never heard any of these things but yet it was necessary if they wanted protection if they wanted to make it through the rain he just said it's going to rain but he Ain tell them how long it was going to rain 40 days 40 nights of rain and there was I mean a flood so great everybody lost their lives only ones living was the ones that was on the boat it Hallelujah and and in those days I mean even animals animals had sense enough and I I I mean I don't know if if you would have been living that day you would have saw two giraffes coming through your backyard what's this two lions coming two tigers yes sir two cheaters two elephants I think I would have started and and now where are they going oh my yes sir and and I just see him marching two by two and wait a minute what where is all of them going and and next thing you know they walking right up to Noah's boat how did the animals have sense enough Hallelujah to get on the boat yes how did they know this right God gave them Instinct and and inspiration and they knew where to go and they knew exactly what to do they Wen sitting out there reading websites they weren questioning whether Noah was a prophet or not they knew get on the boat somehow they had something inant tell them get on this boat their lives were spared everything that was not on the boat lost its life but look look look look that's not just a historical event God allowed that to happen so we can see the same thing repeats in this day it always repeats all right look at this he says in the wilderness Journey here the children of Israel and come out of Egypt and my how they rejoicing they thank God for all the Miracles that happened uh in in in in in in Egypt and and now they're on the way to the promised land brother brandom said it only took 40 days to get to the promised land but because of their unbelief it actually took them 40 years but they was only 40 days away can I ask you a question how close are you to the manifestation of your promise God my Lord and let me ask let me challenge you on something can you not speak doubt for the next 40 [Music] days no doubt don't say nothing negative for 40 days amen see you should have wrote that down amen don't don't say nothing I won't say a negative word for 40 days amen amen amen hallelujah in the wilderness Journey it came to pass they disbelieve this Prophet now it happened during the Wilderness while they were waiting right before they got in they they disbelieved this Prophet after seeing the word being so confirmed look at this now and so it was in the wilderness Hallelujah we got to get it and they they walking amen according to the word they um uh now now when you look at scripture you'll see that I think it roughly took about about 10 days about 10 days after they come out of Egypt 10 days before they started complaining and and when they started complaining God just got so upset with their complaints and he says look you know I'm going to delay their going in because of all this complaint not only delay their going in but I'm going to actually uh not allow the generation that came out to go into the land I'm going let them die in the wilderness and then take their children into the land right but but but but you can imagine all of them coming out man so happy to be delivered from from from from uh Pharaoh's uh whips and and and all the attachment they so happy to be deliver it but but as they get out in the in the wilderness they start complaining now let me tell you something the complaints didn't always come from the children of Israel the complaints actually begin to come from the people they was hanging [Music] with this is what this is what brother uh ancy was talking about it was the mixed multitude right it was it was it was some Egyptians that came out with the Israelites maybe some from another nation that came out with the Israelites they act like they happen to be free my God but they can't handle God ain't made them no promises amen so they can't handle this word that God put out so they begin to complain is this the only thing we going have to eat is this all we can get you know you been you've been saying we going to a Promised Land we ain't seen it yet we just going from here to there hallelujah amen we come from Green Acres we went to West Palm now we in a school and we don't know where we going what we going to [Applause] do where you take us to they just start complaining like crazy Hallelujah rather than just thanking God for where he got you at thank God for the doors he has open and thank God for the doors he's [Music] closed but them complaints got them in trouble and and and when they start complaining can I just put it this way they got out of Step Lord come on oh God they got out of step when they start complaining oh my all they all God wanted them to do is just look at my promise I got a land for you to go to yes sir well when the when the when the the iniquity of the amorites when that cup has been filled I got somewhere to take you and I already brought you out with a mighty hand yes sir yes sir yes sir sometimes it's good for you to look back in your life and see what God has already [Music] done and if he he's already done these things don't you know he'll do it again and again and again and I I was sitting here in prayer this morning just thinking you know the word of God is a living word there are promises in God's word that are past tense in my life they are also present tense in my life and they are future tense one of those promises I'm the Lord thy God that Health all thy diseases I've had to use that in in the past I will use it in the future and I'm using it right now amen when it come to my finances rebuking the devour for my sake I've used that in the past I'm using it right now and I'll use it in the future it's a Living Word It Never Dies no matter what season of life you're in the word of God still works amen they were they were in this will Wilderness Journey this is what the prophet tells us they were in the wilderness Journey it says after seeing the word being so confirmed this is what he tells us on this quote after being after seeing the word being so confirmed the bride got out of step and he says you know what I'm speaking about in The Vision see got out of Step now now now now most people if you hadn't heard him tell the vision you wouldn't know what he was talking about but since I played the vision for you all you all know exactly what he's talking about they got out of Step during the Wilderness process amen the Wilderness is not the destination but it is part of the process Hallelujah and look look look we got to be willing to go through the Wilderness can I can I can I just I'm trying to be sometimes you're going to go through Wilderness in your health sometime you're going to go through Wilderness in your finances can I go further sometime you're going to go through a Wilderness in your family yes you going to go through Wilderness experiences all over but here's the thing you know that the Wilderness is not the promise the promise is is that I might have lost this and and here the children of Israel you know they thinking man we we need to go back to Egypt we had we had this and we had that we had all these other things in Egypt and all we got out here is just some bread I mean we had leaks we had garlic lemonade man we had all kind of stuff but but here's the problem they got to thinking about all the stuff they had in and and and and and and to eat but they forgot about all the whips uhhuh oh you forgot you was actually in bondage down there too you know can I just put it way you ain't going to go back to Egypt in Freedom right you ain't going to experience this in Egypt you can't go to Egypt and experience Freedom right no you go to Egypt to go into bondage and if they if they saw you coming they were they would the whips would get greater yes that's it but they forgot about all that they only thinking about the food but God finally give him you know what y'all y'all all your complaints I'mma give you something I'm I'm and actually God did an overflow for him overflow of meat man I'mma I'mma give you so much meat you you ain't going to want that by the time by the time I overflow you with this meat you ain't going to want no more meat say so much meat the meat going to come out your nose man that's some meet yes sirow don't play with God Don't Play With God just just serve God and and let me let me let me let me help you understand God got everything under control and he don't need none of our help praise the Lord but but but all the complaining is when they got out of step with the word and can I put it I don't want to just say complaining all the questioning y'all ain't with me well why this and why that and and I've been studying this for two years and I ain't I'm just I mean and but I I I've been studying the message for over 30 years I ain't found nothing wrong yet but I've been studying for two years and I found this and I found that and why this and why that and you know don't don't I mean this bridge and bears they ain't got nothing to do with the word that that that's personal that's personal and if God told him he was going to get a bear and he didn't get the bear because he was disobedient that's between him and God that ain't got nothing to do with me right I'm not going out get no bear God ain't told me I'mma get no bear you ain't not hunting either so what what you worried about a bear for but they just begin to question little things and that that seed that's being sown causes the people to get out of Step but I but but but here's the promise that I will I will restore sayith the Lord so I don't know how questions going to get answered but I do know this brother brandom say God will take Majestic fingers and he will unravel the knots so I'm looking for God to do that this year unravel the knots Hallelujah with Majestic fingers maybe through a dream maybe through somebody prophesying over them maybe somebody say something that you wasn't expecting to say and next thing you know that I need to go you need to go back where you come from Hallelujah you can be all in a whole another church and somebody walk up to you you need to go back where you come from what you talking about you know where you come from God got a way of speaking woo Jesus I don't know how God going to do it but I believe this is the year for the restoration I will restore sayith the Lord all right here let me just try to catch a a few things here I I I got so many notes that I cannot uh get it all out let me let me let me just drop this in there's been other times in scripture where people have gotten out of step and brother brandom just told us with the children of Israel as they were in the wilderness Journey uh that's when they got out step just the complaints just the the questions just the you know when we you know I could just imagine you know and it wouldn't even be the kids maybe some maybe the kids and maybe some of the parents but I can just imagine them going through the Wilderness and and finally are we there yet and then maybe that start seeping through the camp are we there yet he told us this 30 something years ago and are we there yet but but but that attitude God had to deal with I mean God wanted his people just to just to be faithful uh let me actually let me finish reading that quote cuz there's another statement that's going to be be made here and I want want to I want to say this it says um in the wilderness Journey it came to pass that they disbelieved this Prophet after seeing the word being so confirmed the bride got out of Step you know what I'm speaking speaking about in The Vision see got out of Step there was one stayed up and see if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will there was one that one state up by the name of Joshua and Caleb and believe the Word of Promise true regardless of what the circumstance was uh Joshua and a Caleb would believe regardless of what the circumstance was and I believe we got some joshuas and some calebs here this morning that will believe regardless of what the circumstance is amen amen I I I want to just make a few comments my next quote that I'm going to go to in a second will be the pergam and church age so just get that one ready uh but he says this uh I mean just just my my my notes I should say um in the days of Joshua the church begin to get out of Step get out of step with what get out of step with the word of God all right and um Joshua actually had to stand before the people and tell them I mean a stat that that we have hanging in our houses you know choose ye you know this day whom you who you going to serve because me in my house we going to serve the Lord woo I like that I like that I like that me in my house we going to stay with this oh hallelujah amen sometimes it comes down to a individual amen state I know you going to do this and you going to do that and you telling me you going to do this and you going to do well you might as well he from me me and my house we going to serve the Lord y'all want to serve the Gods on the other side of the flood y'all want to do this yall y'all want to go back to Egypt y'all do all that but me in my house my individual how I'm going to serve God I'm going to go forward with this promise that God gave me Amen brother brandom say you know it was Joshua and Caleb that that stood amen uh stood stood they stood separately and everybody and you you you go back oh Hallelujah I I think I'll just read amen that let's let's read this let's go to numbers I think 13 I didn't write that one down but we'll we'll we'll catch this for numbers 13 and let me just catch let me tell you what verse I want to go to but um these guys were different and and I believe that as Believers we got to be a little different sometimes it causes us to to have to do some things um verse 23 let's start there we need some Joshua and calebs we need some people that's G to stand against the grain brother we we we like salmon we swim upstream we go against the current praise God but here um in verse 23 and they came to the unto the brook of escoll and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes and and they buried between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs now these people knew that this was a good land they had they had enjoyed the benefits of it they tasted it they knew that this was good and many have tasted this word and they know that when they taste it they can't find this no where else they know it and they be going back and and listen to different sermons and and everything like a lot of those sermons are there just to entertain your flesh but it's nothing that's going down inside your soul praise God Amen there's a lot of good preachers out there and I mean they'll say some things like oh did you hear him say that yeah but ain't ain't nothing sticking to your soul you looking for another good sermon another good sermon praise God and everybody trying to outdo one another sometime we coming up with some crazy things you where you get that from right but but but but but but here you know people have tasted of these grapes they know that it's a good land they tasted of the food that God has provided amen through the revealed word he says this and they came into the book of escal the Bible says and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff and they brought up uh brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called The Brook Esco because the cluster of grapes uh which the children of Israel cut down from them it goes on to say this and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness a man of pan uh to cadesh and brought back word unto them unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land now now now this thing when they come back to the spot cadesh cadesh Baria brother BR say this where they made the worst decision in all of their history right and and there there's many that have faced this same cadesh Baria in their life and they made a really bad decision rather than take God at his word and go forward amen they looked at every circumstance they looked at every situation they looked at every negative thing and they believe that negative report yeah all right now watch this now watch watch this amen uh uh so so the Bible says uh they brought back word again unto them and unto all the congregation and not only and show them the fruit of the lamb praise God now y'all talk about we complaining about uh is this the only thing we got to eat no this what God got in his mind for you see these fruits all right come on now and not only not now you got to understand something about these fruit these are fruit you didn't even have to plant you didn't even have to work somebody else is already till the ground y'all ain't talking to me somebody already till the ground somebody the planed somebody did all the work and God going to let you enjoy the [Music] benefits now you know that's what they did with with uh with with with shamgar I mean them Philistines would come in and enjoy all the man's labor right they I mean he done work the ground teal the ground planted the ground and now he got a crop coming for him they come take everything you know what sham got say I'm tired of being on the defense man I'm going on the offense and when he went on the offense he went and got something that surprise the enemy he got an ox goat how this man going to come out here with an ox go and beat be beat Philistines with swords and Spears and that how he going to do it because the anointing of God was on him he had to be willing to go on the office the anointing will be with you if you'll just be willing to go on the office take the little that you got and do something with [Applause] [Music] it God ain't got but two pennies but I'm bringing it to [Applause] you look at this it says um verse 27 and they told him and said we came un the land with without sentences and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it boy everybody just rejoicing what is what God got for us but then these fellas change their thoughts with a nevertheless can I can I challenge you again for the next 40 days for the next 40 days don't say nothing negative thank you nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are wall and very great and moreover we saw the children of anac there these were giants it says the malachit dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and and I like this see this why this is why brother brandom say it was it was two that was little different oh it says Joshua and Caleb now he actually said there was one and he said Joshua and Caleb now we know that's two but they won with the same Spirit look at it now it says and Caleb steal the people before Moses I like this Moses didn't even have to stand up and say nothing but Caleb he's sitting there and he steals the people look at what he says now Caleb says um um let us go up at once what is this Caleb is moving from the defense Caleb is moving to the offense and it say let now I I heard what you just said but it's a good land let's go up right now let's surprise attack these guys let us go up at once and possess it I like oh Jesus this man wasn't just going up just to fight this man was going up to take what God had promised him no I I'm not calling you up to fight with you no I'm calling you up to tell you that God say he going to restore right and I don't know how he going to do it but he going to do it oh my my my my my sometimes parents got to tell the kids I'm not here to fight with you no no no God say he going to restore that I didn't say that God said it amen praise the Lord God said that it's not my job that's God's job I'm just holding them to his word that's right I'mma remind him of what he said and I'mma remind you of what he said hallelujah amen hallelujah I will restore amen you know sometimes little sicknesses pop up out of nowhere but is this happening little sickness and when that sickness pop up the ones that forgot to reach out for prayer they all a sudden know where they're call to get prayer Lord would you pray for me yeah mm sure will sure will and you got to understand sometime don't be just jumping in so so fast to pray you you already know God going to hear the prayer but you need to try to work with this person come on there we go what what's you know hey what's going on I mean they ain't seen you in church in a while you know you're going to need God what what if you weren't able to call me who would you call what church you connected to praise the Lord ask him some questions when you going to get back in church all right look look look look look look Caleb steal the people before Moses said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well a to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report for the land which they had searched into the children unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth of the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in are men of great stature and there was there we um we saw the we saw great Giants the sons of anac which come of uh which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight oo Lord we were in in our own sight as grasshoppers so we were in their sight now notice they they they they they they they confess this negative report that in our sight the way we look at this we grasshoppers but no God say you're an overcomer God God say you're an overcomer but you know in order to overcome you're going to have to fight you're going to have to get up and and and do something amen I I I'm skipping down to the next chapter uh my my God let me just let me I'm I'm oh Lord yeah verse one and all the children fled uh uh all the children all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses all this complaining this they getting out of Step murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation Lord have mercy how many of them seen that that's a repeat of that Spirit they murmur against the prophet they murmur against the pastor and they murmur against the ones that still believe [Music] in look now and the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the wilderness this where they getting out of Step it says and wherefore hath the Lord brought brought us into the land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be prayed were not better for us to return into Egypt and it said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jeff uh uh uh jeffn he says which were of them that search the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land my God if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and I'm I'm here to just announce I don't believe it's a if this morning I believe God Delights in US amen and since God Delights in us he's the one that's going to take us into the land amen hallelujah we just got to show up for the battle if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into the land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey hallelujah hallelujah but but but they said one thing only don't say nothing negative only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us they not Warriors man we eat this they are bread for us look at it their defense I know they big giants but their defense is already departed from them and the Lord is with us fear them not they got out of Step because they start complaining they got out of Step because they listen to an evil report yes yes but you know before the prophet could actually scream at the church for getting out of Step somehow some way miraculously they got back in Step yeah you know I'm I'm I'm I I didn't serve in the military but I I I I do know that they have when they're marching they have a certain way they have to March and usually you hear them hollowing left right left left right left and I mean you got to be on it and if you get caught like if you get caught like that you you off of it and you look different from everybody you out of Step so before your sergeant see you you better get back on left right left right yes and I just believe this is a season well we we going to see folk get back on left right left hallu hallelujah hallelujah to God let me just make a few more comments and I'm going I'm going shut down I I I I didn't get to where I wanted to go but God this is what God wanted and I and with all these notes I can keep preaching in the Days of Elijah they got out of step and uh Elijah had to come and ch challenged them uh with a statement like look let the god that answer by fire let him be God and uh all the people agreed that you know if if God answer by fire yeah we'll serve we'll serve that God say we I'm tired of see y'all serving Bell I'm tired of seeing these things but let the god that answer by fire be God and what I want what I want to share with you is that in generation after generation after generation people have always gotten out of Step yeah now that did not stop here in our day no The Same Spirit has attacked people Amen to get them out of step with the word of God but what God is calling for amen is is a restoration which means they'll come back into step somehow Lord it'll happen it'll happen and this restoration goes not just with that it goes with every every I mean your your your your your health yes sir it goes with your family yes sir this restoration go with your finances everything about you this restoration is is covering it amen hallelujah amen for the church as a whole it covers for the for the bride as a whole it covers this restoration is is a powerful powerful you know something to consider but but here in the days of uh Elijah when he was on the earth they they they begin to get out of Step they serving a false god a idol God he say look look look look I'm tired of y'all doing this it says um God sent me here he said to challenge y'all and let the god that answer of our fire be God and when they when he when he when he when he when he gave them time to say okay that's what we'll do y'all set up y'all altar we I'm going to set up my Altar and sometimes when you standing like Caleb and Joshua you standing alone all right all right yo Elijah had to stand alone sometimes in following this message you got to stand alone you got to go through your Wilderness experience but I'm going to tell you this as you're standing alone somehow God going to bring some mother they going to be there to support you watch this now look so so so so Elijah Elijah said let the God answer by fire let him be God he said you build your altar I'mma build my Altar and all these prophets and Priests are crying out you know on the altar cutting theirselves and doing all kind and Elijah said look maybe uh y'all need to scream a little harder and louder your God must be on vacation I mean ain't nothing happened I'm like you know I don't know what y'all what is going on just I mean they just doing everything they can to get they got attention he say come to the evening time he says I I think that's enough now with my altar I want y'all to dig a trench and put some water in there and then put some more water in there and then put three put some more water that he said he said I'm just going to pray a simple prayer he prayed one prayer God you sent me here and now now Lord let let them see that you you were trying to cause their hearts to return or to to be restored back to you and say Lord you you answer by fire cuz I did exactly what you said after he said amen here come the fire down and consume this sacrifice that was done in order to get the people back in Step Jesus day they had people getting out of Step what Jesus said and we're going to read this in Mark chapter 7 verse 5-13 but what happened in Jesus day is they through their Traditions they made the word of God of no effect this is what denominations have done in this day through their Traditions they have made the word of God of no effect they were out of Step In Jesus day and he was certainly doing all he can and try to get him back in Step Mark 7:5 says didn't the pH sees and scribes ask him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands he answered and said unto them well hath asias the prophet uh uh Isaiah uh prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me now now now I I might as well just just you know be honest truthful you you can go to some of these big huge churches and boy it look like them people just praising God man just crying and on the on the floor and just hands up I went to one church people laid out on the floor prostrated in the presence of God all over the place tears just flowing and and crying and sometime you go you even feel the presence of God but I done been in churches in services like that and right after the service they got cool in the gang playing cool in the gang celebrate good times tonight the the fellowship turns into a party and they even call it an after party and like that's okay to bring the devil in after we just Worship the Lord my God and churches do this all it's so bad now that they starting to sing the devil songs in the church yeah go been been the funerals and like you you call somebody they going to sing sing a special you what that's boys toin what are you singing what are you singing in here in the house of God what are you doing that is not acceptable right but but but but but but you know what the same spirit that was in the days of Jesus is here today I mean look at what the scripture say the people honor me with their lips but your heart is far from it and and you know I I tell y'all that there's people that's probably listen and listen online and say brother Jack ain't telling nothing but the truth I'm telling the truth but why you keep going to that church why are you still going to that church what do you in they they honor with their lips but their hearts are far from God far from God God want people that's going to worship Him how and speak truth and in truth amen and that is not just a church building or church name that is a real place that you can reach in God Amen all right let's keep reading and and oh here's the other part oh Lord this this one now Jesus said this Jesus said this he said this people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me now watch what Jesus says how be it oh my now that was a hard one that's a hard pill for some folk to swallow in vain people are worshiping you know Cain's worship was in vain but God told him exactly how he wanted he just refused to do it the way God said it his his worship was in vain I don't care how pretty it was it was in vain how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God and what that means you laid aside the word and you're doing whatever you want to do but you're laying aside the word for laying aside the command oh I can I I I I'm I I mean you know in order for a woman preacher to take the pull pit she got to lay aside the word she got to I mean she she's got to just just ignore what Paul said yeah or if she got to try to explain it in such a way that and and like like the one one thing that I always hear Paul was a woman hater is that right I I I I don't actually I don't even think I read that in scripture where it said Paul was a woman hater that that verse is not in there right but that's just something that we've come up with to try to justify getting away from the word that's right brother Every Woman preacher has to put the word to the side because the Bible say I suffer not a woman to you Ser authority over the man that's what Paul wrote and now you're going to take that now why did God allow him to put it there if he if when you call Paul a woman hater and God let him put it in the scripture you know what you're saying about God that he's a woman hater and that's not what I get from God male and female created he them amen all right Church look look this Jesus saw people getting out of step and this is why he say in vain y'all worshiping me y'all doing all these things I mean boy I've been crying and on the flowing I mean my God just the tears flowing every but in vain in vain in vain in vain you doing this for laying aside the Commandment of God ye hold the Trad itions being as the washing pots and cups and many other uh such things such like things you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition you reject the Commandment of God so that you can keep your own tradition can I can I also just add this people reject this message because they know it's tight you ain't got no problem with you you don't even know brother brandom how you going to say you don't believe him you don't even know him you a read nothing about his life story you don't know nothing about brother brandom tell me about him just tell me a little bit about brother brandom you don't know nothing about him so it's not that that's not the problem it's because of what he preached and and and and and it has an effect on your life you got to change the way you live this message requires you to change the way you live let me tell you God's people have always been different in every age they've been different so we might as well be different now let me go on let me go on it says for will you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition for Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and who so curseth father or mother let him die the death but you say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is Corbin that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free it says and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother making the word of God of none effect through your Traditions which you have delivered and many such things do ye back in Jesus day the church was completely getting out of Step their Traditions became more important than the word of God hallelujah but there was a few in that day that accepted what Jesus was doing they accepted his message and they got right back in step and the way we going to get back in Step today we're going to have to accept the word the revealed word for our day as God has given it to us through a prophet it brings us back in step now I'm going to show you in scripture I can't do it today but I'm going to show you in scripture how God allowed certain things to happen to get the church out of Step it allowed it with that great armor that he sent amongst him he allowed that and it happened right through the church ages it happened uh in I mean starting in Ephesus all the way through to Le theia that happened in church ages but there were certain things also happen it's right in scripture y'all I I'm going just tell you this read Revelation 2 you'll see where the church went into the depths of Satan but when you get to Revelation 3 there's three Church ages that that's listed in Revelation 3 and that's the uh sardian um Philadelphia Philadelphian and also the Le Sean age is through those three ages even the Bible have it separated like that in these chapters and in Revelation 2 it starts with the first four and it goes to the depths of Satan but Revelation 3 Revelation 3 gives you the last three Church agents and it shows how a restoration was supposed to happen and I'm telling you right now we're living in the midst of that restoration that's why I could tell you a few weeks ago I am the restoration not just me you are the restoration and remember this is a past tense word this is a present tense word and this is a future word it's a Living Word thank God God bless you Church praise the Lord let's just pray as the musicians would make their way back father we thank you Lord for the word that has been given to us we uh God we can see uh what you are doing in this hour and and just thank you that these promises apply to every area of our life thank you for just Lord how the prophet just said we have to get back in step and he saw the bride somehow Lord get back in the Cadence and I believe you're calling from the north the South the East the West you're calling people Lord out of confusion out of deception calling them back to a Truth where they could stand faithfully and firmly on the word of God knowing what you have promised and Lord that we're not we're not following cunning devis fables Lord but we're following every promise that you've made we uh we just appreciate Lord Jesus uh the clarity in scripture I didn't get a chance to to to just share it but I I will in the future but Lord even just the scriptures that we we're reading about the restoration well just some of the comments that um if we were to go to Bible commentary and just see what the comments of those commentaries were and how Lord just seemed like they they missed some but they got some but just just all over the place but yet a prophet gives us clear instruction on what has happened that's why we can look even in the church ages we can see right there in the Bible Revelation 2 everything goes into chaos but Revelation 3 a restoration occurs a Reformation that leads to a restoration father how grateful we are to be a part of this Lord that there was um there was
