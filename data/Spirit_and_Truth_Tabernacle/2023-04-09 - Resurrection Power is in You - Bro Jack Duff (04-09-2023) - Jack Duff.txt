appreciate brother Smiley hey man just kind of being around in the bush amen and appreciate the specials amen my brother Capers and sister Birds say man we appreciate you all so much uh if you get your Bibles we'll turn to John 14 uh certainly happy to see uh yes brother Marco back there good to see you I saw my niece sister Candace remember me sister Rachel and my uh nephew-in-law uh brother Stephen God bless you all amen so good to have you on in service and I've seen Nehemiah back there man you missed a trip of a lifetime uh but it's good to have you here God bless you represent uh brother uh brother Solomon and sister Naomi and the family got a chance to go to London uh for a whole week and it's been a nice vacation over there and and I've just been seeing some of the pictures and I'm glad that the Lord blessed them to be able to enjoy themselves amen and uh he thought they thought I was going to say no not this year not this year I I had a desire to be home and I had a faith a man that I was standing on him and I got I got let me tell you like this I got abrahamic faith my faith was that we was gonna be in our own building uh for Easter but you know what God got a better plan so I I I surrendered to that but we are we're we're certainly under expectation that God is going to do exceeding the Abundant above all weekend that's good thank you we just we didn't trust him amen so let's uh let's just read a scripture too that I want to read John 14 verse 19 through 21. amen I I went up north and and um oh let me explain that because people people get a little concerned but when I went up north uh uh to Hampton it was the the campus is kind of like right on the on the water there and uh some reason I guess this is kind of like a change of seasons and uh there was a strong wind that was just kind of blowing you know in the area and it was blowing every flower it could you know right into the area and I don't I don't necessarily have you know sometime it gets to me and uh so I come back and you know and I was doing okay and Wednesday night and come and teach them and after service I start feeling something so I did take a test and and I'm okay amen you gotta worry about that but uh just a little attack from the enemy but I came this morning just to let the devil know whose side I was on hey man I'm on the low outside and I remember I remember brother Branham sharing a statement he said there was a fellas say that man he just gets so mad at the Devil he just wanna uh he said he'll just just buying them just buying them he said if he didn't have no teeth then he'd just gum him amen I just feel like I'm coming this morning praise the Lord but I'm still fighting the enemy amen John 14 um uh verse 19 through 21. it says um it says uh yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye will see me because I live ye shall live also because I live ye shall live also amen and brother Branham tells us that this was a a statement that the Lord Jesus was making to his bride because I live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you and um and and I think it's very important for us not to keep putting this off to a future day uh when it says at that day ye shall know he was talking about this day this day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you verse 21 says he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him let's turn also to Romans chapter 8. amen praise the Lord um I tell you I was certainly looking forward to this Easter it's been a couple years since I've been home for yeast and I was glad to be home this time I say you know it's one thing to preacher brought but there's nothing like preaching at home a man on Easter amen so I'm happy to be here this morning uh here Romans 8 and verse 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up uh uh he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen Hallelujah Let's uh let us just have a word of prayer father we thank you for the word of God that has been read and uh we trust now that the Holy Ghost would take what has been read and make a present tense father speak to our hearts on this Resurrection Sunday we accept the Holy Ghost but take complete control of of uh each and every person father we know that uh the resurrection is not an event but the resurrection is a person and may the Resurrection show up this morning in the lives of his people God manifest yourself once more prove that you are still amen the same yesterday today and forever so in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you can be seated thank you man I'm gonna have to be careful and all kind of things but uh it's all right man we uh we're gonna get through it I just if I could borrow some words from uh I used to be a Baptist a man before I came to the message and the preacher but come up and say I just stopped by to tell you amen I stopped by to tell you that resurrection power is in you amen resurrection power is in you turn around and tell somebody resurrection power is in you blessed be the name of the Lord you see when we come to Easter uh Easter is what separates Christianity from any other religion amen and there are many other religions out there and things that people believe and and sometimes we have questions as to whether they have a portion of Truth and sometimes they do uh but Easter is what separates Christianity from everybody else because Easter is where our leader our Lord and our savior proved that he was who we said he was blessed be the name of the Lord amen Matthew 17 verse 22 and 23 the Bible says in while they Abode in Galilee Jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry and and maybe they had never understood this type of language uh you know they were sorry because they didn't really hear what he said the the statement before amen the state all they heard was they shall kill him and they were exceeding sorry but they missed the third day he shall be raised again and if they would have cope that and understood that it would have produced a level of excitement Hallelujah somebody amen but Easter is a time where Jesus proved what he said in John chapter 2 verse 19 amen the Bible says Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up and when it got up in three days Jesus proved that Christianity was different from any other religion in John chapter 10 verse 17 through 18 the Bible says therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life and I love this he also says that I might take it again he says no man taketh it from me but I lay it down you got to be willing to be crushed you got to be willing to go through something sometime amen no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself and I like this I have power to lay it down come on somebody and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father you see I like this you know because um you know if if he had if he's before his his crucifixion before his death at Calvary he makes this statement that I have power to lay it down and he says I have power to take it up again you know you wonder well if he had power to lay it down and and that power to take it up again uh at what point in time that this power intend to him you see it wasn't it wasn't when he was in the grave that the power came into him the power was in him before he got in the grave and I'm gonna tell you another thing about the power the power was in him before he got in the grave and the power was able to keep him in the grave he exit could come up before three days because he kept saying three days there was power to take him in there was power to keep him in and there was power to get him out that same power is dwelling inside of those that have the Holy Ghost resurrection power is laying inside of you you ain't gonna get this when you die you got it right now I say you got it right now if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you got this same power in you right now resurrection power well that's greater than any power amen let's go back to this quote that brother Smiley used on last week I know I just tell you I I was blessed by the sermon I was you know listening and I say well my it just blessed my heart I love when the church is eating I just like to see y'all eat amen but here he was reading this quote from the message I know and it says uh see it takes a crucifixion it takes a crushing of the flower to bring perfume from it it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of it that there is that's the reason now that's that's just beautiful in order to get the best out of it it has to go through crush it see you thought you were at your best when you were on the Mountaintop really you at your best when you're in your Valley come on somebody when you and your violin you still gotta Hallelujah from the valley see it means something your holiday your Hallelujah means something when you're walking through a valley hey I can walk like David yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I know he's with me because he promised he would never leave me nor forsake me when I can't feel them I know he's there when I can't see him I know he's there and I trust by faith as I keep walking he'll show up somewhere you gotta be willing to go through the valley it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of it that there is that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was my he said that's the crushing is what separated him from any other religious leader come on Church the the crushing the crucifixion amen that's what's several because he he he not only laid his life down but he picked it up again that's what separates him but we're not just talking about somebody with just some good words no this this is this is a power that goes beyond all of that look at this he says this that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was he cannot stand before the he could not stand before the crucifixion say all power and heavens and earth is given unto my hands but after the crucifixion he could stand and say all powers and heavens and earth is given unto my hand but what did it do it taken crucifixion first it taken the crushing and the disappointing of the Apostles they had seen uh their savior the one they love and seen him raise up the Dead from the grave they had seen him do that and then the thing there he lays cold in the grave himself this morning but they didn't realize he needed to go through that I I was just saying I wrote some notes here you know as I was listening to brother Smiley bringing that sermon the first thing I was thinking man I just wish we would have been able to have our own like Easter meeting you know where you had the different ministers going forth that would just been so perfect but God knows all things and uh but but I was I was just really enjoying it and and the thing I like about is that I love a man how we would walk through the personal and applicable aspects of that sermon amen first of all the the personal part is that the Lord Jesus himself had to experience a a crushing at his crucifixion and uh and because of that crushing we can go to Isaiah 53. verse 3 says he is despised and rejected of men come on a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we head as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not verse 4 says surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows amen yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted this is his crushing but to see it was through the crushing that we got the best part out amen because verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions amen he was bruised for our iniquities he went through it so I don't have to go through it the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and I'm gonna tell you I want to make it a little bit more personal because I know that there was a a captain one time on the ship he was sick and um and he just I mean he was out there couldn't get in hospital anything like that so he had one of the fellas on the ship you know get on he said he says uh Captain I know you you're going through and we don't know if you're gonna make it but let me just read some scripture over you but let me read it to you the way Mama read it to me I know you're familiar with it Captain but you got to read it differently you got to put yourself in there because as he died you died and as he rose you Rose Resurrection Powers inside of you but he was wounded verse 5. for Jack's transgressions he was bruised for Jack's iniquities the chastisement of Jack's piece was upon him and with his stripes Jack is evil hey I can claim it I can claim it because his death not only brought salvation but his death brought healing there's a dual atonement at Calvary brother Smiley brought in on last week how brother Branham himself experienced his crushing in his own life and losing his wife and his daughter but you know it's through things like that that God was able to to bring forth a man a Ministry that impacted all of our lives even brother Smiley brought his own personal testimony amen of just going through a crushing but I tell you after I listened to the sermon last week if if if a crushing is going to produce a word like that then praise God I think it's Moe in there where that came from and I'm looking forward to see what God do it's it's important when you recognize what God has done in your life amen the Bible tells us that all things work together oh I don't know if we heard it and all things work together for the good to them that love God unto them to this purpose and say it's gonna feed good and then say it's gonna be good but it's gonna work together for the good oh we gotta trust him in the valley he also brought amen the the uh the character of job to our amen attention and I just wanted to kind of get a glimpse of him because job is the very first man they got a glimpse of the Resurrection in Job 14 verse 14 job was going through his his uh is his trials and his tribulations his crushing his friends with air accusing him of doing things wrong and he knew that he had done nothing wrong and job was just wondering a lot you know about man I see when a flower die it drops a little seed into the Earth and and that same flower will come back up again it has Perpetual life I can look at the trees amen and they died a certain time of year but you know that tree maybe that leaf might fall off but inside that tree another Leaf will come out in the springtime amen the tree itself might look dead but there's going to be something come forth more fruit will come forth from that tree if it just weathers the storm come on somebody you got to learn to just weather the storm the tree is still planted in the earth it's still got a source it's still got something that can it can it can pull from but you got to be willing to go through that winter season of life I'm so glad that God arranged it and after winter you can look forward to the springtime the resurrection is found in nature but job said this in Job 14 14 as he was wondering about uh life and nature says if a man die if a man died shall he live again this is Job's question now before we get too too fast in that verse you got to think he's he put the question mark there and he's just wondering if a man die he's put it in in on paper if a man thou shall he live again and he's wondering to himself what about a man I'm going through all this I know about a flower and I know about a tree I know about this and you know and I believe uh one place said in the Book of Job job say that that a a dead tree just at the scent of water if it just had a way to smell water that tree would start rising and living again Resurrection would show up in that tree just at the scent of water hallelujah hallelujah amen by but job was wondering these things and and then I believe Revelation struck him he says all the days in my appointed time will I wait I know I might be going through right now but all the days of my important time will I wait till my change comes sometimes when you're in the valley all you got is just one lure one little little something you can hold on to me it might be a song it might be a verse it might be a just a little something you hold on to but just hold on to that I'm gonna tell you that little bit that you're holding on to it's enough to carry you through but job job uh has this question I want to go back to the message I know the second quote here and the message I know it says all these Great Men because job is the first one to see the resurrection he said all these great men that would take much of our morning service away to go into I mentioned that they went through trials and saw God they went through trials and saw angels they went through trials and Revelations and saw signs and wonders and things amen but look at what it says here in the message I know it says but oh none of them saw what job saw all them man after seeing angels and seeing God and all these things they never saw nothing to give them hopes beyond the grave beyond the grave they never saw anything to give them hopes beyond the grave but job saw the resurrection he saw Easter Glory he sought a thing that Comforts every heart then when he did all that my words would be printed in the book oh that they would be engraved with an iron pin in the Rock now what did job see that changed his perspective we find this written in job Chapter 19 Verse 22. praise the Lord what did job see why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graving with the iron pen and led in the rock forever this is where they start for I know come on somebody that my redeemer living and that he shall stand at that Latter day upon the Earth look at this and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself but my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me job got a glimpse of the Resurrection when he says you know that I'm going to see I'm going to see my redeemer I know he lives and I'm going to see we're going to stand on the latter day Joe job got a glimpse of Easter how we thank God sometimes we need a really good glimpse of Easter now you know job made a statement there that I want to amen just kind of look at just for a second job said uh though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God and and brother Brandon makes this statement that I wanna I wanna I wanna just bring your attention to the skin worm that's gonna destroy you is already in you but it can't activate until a certain time come on somebody he said he said when you land a man in a casket all of a sudden the skin worms that was in you start to activate but if the if the if the skin were is also in you right now you might not be able to feel it you might not be able to see it but the skin worm is there inside of you right now the skin worm ain't coming the skin worm lives in you right now come on somebody you ain't got to feel it you gotta see it operator doing nothing it's laying dormant but he's still in you if the skin worm is in you then resurrection power is also inside of you sometimes it lays torment but there's a promise of that resurrection power that even if you died you gotta have a power that'll get you out the grave the same power that raised up Jesus is the same power that's living inside of you brother random makes this statement and the message faith it says this and and I was I was just went back to listen to this this quote I mean this discernment it's about a 27 minute sermon and I couldn't believe some of the things brother Adam was said in these 27 minutes but he made a statement it says but you've got to use faith in God to make it work see so you got your own Resurrection inside of you your Resurrection lays inside of you and your spirits your Resurrection ain't coming your Resurrection is here that I gotta defeat devils because you realize the same power that took Jesus to a cross and from across to a grave is this internet from a grave to the sky that same power is in you that have the Holy Ghost you don't fear death when you know that power is inside of you here's a couple definitions that I want to give amen Resurrection is the act of factor resurrecting a being uh or being resurrected uh also they said it's a Christian belief of Christ rising from the dead it's also a Christian belief that the rising of the dead at the last judgment uh and also they said a resurrection and I like this definition it's the revitalization revitalization or Revival of something so you know when you look at it from these different angles it's not just necessarily about Christ rising from the dead which we believe that's the ultimate but sometimes it can just be the revitalization or the revive or something sometimes in your spirit you need a resurrection and Resurrection is not replacement see red Resurrection is not replacement Resurrection is is if I put this down on the ground a man to resurrect it is not going to get me another bottle of water that's replacement resurrections get the same one that was put down lift it back up again it's the revitalization of something oh my there's so much I can say right there but some of us need to go through a revitalization Hallelujah somebody and my prayer is that this Resurrection Day somebody would experience a personal Resurrection there was a statement that was made and I mentioned it earlier uh but there's a statement that was made if we did brother Brandon said if we didn't even have a Bible we will still know that Christianity was right if we even if we didn't have a Bible we still know it's right and there are some things that he said he says he talked about it through nature and I just wrote a few notes as seen in the Nature's trees loses its leaves in the fall the sap drops into the roots during the winter the tree looks dead it looks dead and some of us look dead but there's a resurrection inside of you and all we got to do is get it into the right conditions oh yeah I wish I could preach it the way I felt it but the tree looks dead amen the stops drop into the roots during the winter amen but nature produces a vibrant Green Tree in the spring even a flower seems as if it died in the winter but because it dropped the seed of itself into the Earth beforehand oh my before the winter strikes the flower has an intelligence in it to take a seat of itself and drop it into the Earth and when the winter amen the winter strikes and then the spring rains come that flower begins to come back up again it's the same flower with amen uh what we call Perpetual life glory to God the flower has Perpetual life and it does rise again the Sun that rises will also set but tomorrow the same sun will rise again and I like this step storm clouds cannot even stop the Sun from rising amen they may temporarily block our view of seeing the s-u-n but they cannot stop it from rising and spiritual storms may block our view of Christ but they cannot stop the Daystar from shining in our hearts oh I'll worship him in the valley actually that's when your prayers get the best we can see resurrections happening all throughout scripture even before our Lord and Savior Jesus rose from the dead um there was I'll give you three amen but before I get to those one one statement brother Brandon made about amen Isaac being offered at Mount Moriah it was a foresight of what the resurrection of Christ would be we find that in Genesis 24 the same Isaac that was laid on the altar was the same Isaac that was brought from the altar it was a foresight there was amen the resurrection uh in Elijah they in his ministry he prayed for a little boy and this boy uh uh was dead and and he went in there and prayed and and the Lord raised this boy up you find him and find the story in First Kings 17 verse 20 through 24. but also that same Spirit was in Elisha praise God and here in Elisha there was a little little boy who died amen and the mother come running a man to get Elijah she says look you know uh I used to prepare a place for you I used to do this and and her husband said don't go to the prophet don't bombs no no I'ma just go because he might be the only one with a word so let me just go and she would say a boy about 12 years old is dead and I had a son stroke and he died so the mother comes and and uh gehazi's there and and uh and and he says uh the Lord doesn't hear from me uh what what was troubled woman so let me just ask her is everything well now her testimony Hallelujah even though her son was dead her testimony is all is well when you going through you got to have the right testimony all is well and he said well what is it say well you know Prophet you know I I couldn't have children and and you promised me to have this boy and and the Lord blessed me with the boy but now the boy is dead and I don't know what to do so he gave gods of the stickers say go lay this the staff on them and and the woman said well I'm sorry now I appreciate your stick but I ain't going back to my house without you and Elisha goes back to the house with this woman amen and the boys laying down their Elisha lays on top of the boy amen when he lays on top of the boy stretches himself on top of the boy same way Elijah have come and then he stretched himself on top of the boy the Boy sneezed seven times and came back to life we saw resurrections happen in the scripture but this same Elisha that brought a boy back to life he died one day and when he died they took his bones and they buried him just uh uh just a a normal place of burial but there's a soldier that's in battle and he gets struck down in battle and he's dead and his comrades are carrying them away in battle from the battle and they say well we got to Bear him somewhere so it just happened to just throw him on the bones of Elisha and when they threw this fella home to the bones of Elisha he jumped up come on somebody I can tell you right now there was resurrection power in them bones Oh Glory to God the man can't Rose to his feet and went right back into the battle again they had saw a resurrection they experienced it I love this amen let's read that uh Second Kings 13 21 that's where we find it Second Kings 13 21 says and it came to pass as they were bearing a man they behold they spot a band of men and they cast a man into the sepulch of Elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha he revived and stood up on his feet you know and I would just you know it kind of kind of struck me it was so much power in his bones that it caused another man to rise up but why didn't he lie to himself right they just keep that one in mind why didn't he rise but he had power in his bones I think if they would have threw another one down there he would have got up and another one they were there it would have been all kind of people rising up because there was resurrection power was laying in them bones Elisha is a type of the Bride Hallelujah Elisha represents Us in the scripture and if resurrection power was inside of him that same Resurrection Powers inside of us Oh Glory to God let's go on a little further Jesus before he raised from the dead Amen in his ministry was manifested three people rising from the dead and what we got is Lazarus we all know about the store of Lazarus how he experienced a resurrection after being gone four days brother random said that even as corruption was setting in on on Lazarus corruption newest master and Corruption had to let go Lazarus praise God when he went to the Grave the prophet told us that had he not called Lazarus by name everything would have came out of the grave oh resurrection power was walking on the Earth he said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came out of the Grave another one was Jairus daughter young girl dead and Jairus come and say would you please come to my house my daughter's dead and I just want you to come to my house and lay your hands on him he went there to jireh's daughter's a rescue and he laid hands on her and she rose up from the dead a third instance of Jesus Amen uh displaying this resurrection power was when he was passing through a city one day he happened to come on the right day this woman had just buried her husband now she's bearing a son and they're going through they've just had the service glory to God and now she's getting ready to take him to the burial and that's the only way to bury oh Jesus just touches the buyer [Music] and the Bible say the boy just rose up began to talk to his mama went home and got himself a real good meal it's something when you come in contact with resurrection power I don't care what your situation is I don't care how bad it is you could be on your way to the graveyard but when you come in contact with the resurrection power it changes everything I like to say the resurrection of Christ we know hey man this day that people celebrate his resurrection and and I'm glad that people celebrate it you know I get tired of people pulling up Easter bunnies in in Easter eggs what that got to do with Jesus how did abundant take the place of Jesus I was at Dunkin Donuts on yesterday and I I walked in with another fella and Easter bunny sitting there and he's trying to scare everybody I'm looking man this is nonsense this is nonsense get get this guy out of here why why don't why don't why don't you dress like Jesus put a costume on like Jesus and tell people what the real story of East is all about glory to God but when Jesus rose from the grave I love uh What uh maybe we'll pick this up Matthew 27 52 I didn't write that one down but let's pull that one up for me Matthew 27-52 you know when I was listening to a brother make a comment this morning and and he was saying when we think about it in Israel uh there's an empty tomb this morning our Lord and savior is no longer in the Tomb we know he rose he's he's no longer there but when you think about it according to Matthew 27 and 52 there were some more empty Tunes because the Bible says and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept a rose let me tell you something there was resurrection power in them before they died they had it in them my God my God my God so it wasn't just one empty grave but there were many empty griefs and I'm here to tell you this morning if the devil has you in a grave of doubt the grave is gonna be empty if the devil has you in a grave of unbelief the grave is gonna be empty come on somebody if the devil has an engrave of Oppression and a grave of depression the grave is about to be empty praise God there is resurrection power in you a grave of cancer come on somebody a grave of high blood pressure a grave of diabetes whatever that craze is Ain't No Grave hold my body down a a grave of covet No Grave gonna hold this body down but listen to me before that grave of headache and whatever that is it ain't gonna hold you down sis amen there will be a resurrection there will be a revitalization there will be a return resurrection power is in you my God Peter received a resurrection in his spirit the brothers on the road to Emmaus received a resurrection in their spirits I want to tell you you even experienced a resurrection when you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus let's read Romans 6 verse 3 through 5. you experienced it Oh Glory verse 3 says no ye not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism oh my into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection when you were baptized it's Amen the the baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ it is the old person going into the water we took the old man into the water and when we when you come up out the water the new man is is walking now you experience a resurrection and remember Resurrection is not replacement Amen brother Branham also said not only do we uh uh uh as a scripture just read Paul told us that we we experience the resurrection when we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but brother random saying you experience a resurrection when you left the deadness or the deafness of denominationalism you experience the resurrection when you came out of her my people you experience a resurrection when you left the things of the world because that's when the lifestyle you're supposed to be living amen and you knew you didn't fit out there glory to God so he had to come in and give you a personal Resurrection I want to kind of just inject a couple things here listen to this uh uh and out of the sermon does God ever change his mind about his word just bear with me here I got my timer set I think I'm doing real good with my time and uh we gonna get this home your Resurrection is in you right now it makes a statement here at the beginning of the sermon does God ever change his mind about his word he says I'm happy to be back in church tonight and to be with you dear people I know it's warm but I just called my wife I think it's 90 degrees or something or 95 or 96 or something and it's quite a bit warmer than it is here so I'm getting used to the warm weather now but I'm so glad to be here at the Tabernacle of this wonderful Easter time it says that I can't say that I apologize for that long long message this morning but I didn't want to wear out your patience and then come at it again tonight but I want it to get that message to you that you are a part of this Resurrection the prophecy I wanted to get that message to you that you are a part of this Resurrection see he says and don't you worry about it no more see just Rejoice over it there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it nothing eternally secure in the kingdom of God when God has stabbed his seal upon you you're to the end of the destination now he makes this statement but I wanted to get I wanted to I want to get that message to you and uh the question is what message did he want to give to you what message did he want to get to you well the sermon that he was referring to us it is the rising of the Sun that was a sermon that he preached right before and uh so he had one in the evening one in the morning and we go back to the rising of the sun now and we pull up just a few quotes from here the first one that I want to get amen is this it says on Easter morning not only did he raise look at this but his beneficiaries raised with him that's us Oh Glory to God see if if if if if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies we identified in him with him in life and we identify with him in death we're identified with him in Resurrection he says on Easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in Christ at his crucifixion they were in him at his resurrection we are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness in a darkened world of unbelief where churches and the denominations and so forth had drawn us out we were quickened from it you know I was listening to a brother say this this morning let me just I'll I'll pause there just for a second uh as brother Belton I was talking to him earlier you know in the week and and he was telling me says you know when brother Branham told the story of a eagle that have been uh misplaced down in a barnyard and he says uh and he said the mother Eagle came and screamed looking for that baby eagle it says for those of us that were in denomination when brother Branham said that that meaned everything to us because we could clearly identify that there was more than this well let me let me let me let me let me break this down just a little bit more there are some people that go to denominational churches just to be able to tell people I go to church there are other people like I was when I was in denomination I didn't just go to tell people I've been to church but I was involved deeply involved amen if they want to join the Usher board you was on the Usher board if they needed you in the choir you was in the choir what Sunday school we was there we did everything for when they had three o'clock services in the afternoon serving pound cake and punch hello somebody we was there when nobody else was representing the church in the afternoon they say the choir was supposed to come we happened to be there only a few members of the choir we gave everything to the system we weren't going just to say we went to church but we gave everything to the system and when you're giving everything to the system then you begin to understand the inner workings of the system you don't notice if you ain't really involved so I'm gonna tell you like if you're gonna go so you can get spiritually sick and when you get sick you will realize something he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your pieces upon him and with his stripes you can be healed spiritually healed but to say when brother Brandon made that statement it really meant something to us because we were there but people that's born in this message people that's raising this message you don't even understand what he's saying you know you have no idea what he said you haven't experienced that that's why that's why that's why when we come out and we say look at me look I don't tried it all right I've been there and I can tell you right now it's worse now than it was when I was there homosexual song leaders I mean back in those days we had a homosexual musicians now they song leaders and preachers you're gonna raise your kid in there you gotta be kidding me people ain't got enough in them to come out of here [Music] I had a friend of mine recently she sent me a card in the mail to me and sister Erica she said she was just watching some of this stuff on TV and some of these great preachers and some of them getting caught in some really really bad situations and she said you know I was just so frustrated what I was here and I said you know what I got to tell I got to tell Jack and I gotta tell his wife that I really appreciate them he said because they they really doing things right they they ain't in no scandals they living right before the people they ain't got a bunch of nonsense happening in the church we got a standard in the church but we ain't got nonsense come on somebody just I just need to let them know how much I preach okay this guy he all on TV but look at what he's doing I look at look at what his son doing and he's supporting his son doing that look at this guy look at this guy she told me about uh I'm gonna just call these things I use it on cause but TD Jakes had uh what's the guy that played my dear Tyler Perry TD Jakes have Tyler Perry praying over him and then I hear this guy got not just dressed up as a woman my dear not just that but now he got a new show with two men being in a bed homosexual stuff happening all over and he praying over a preacher he couldn't come here and pray you can come here and get prayed for but you can't come here and pray it's sin all over the place and come on y'all as Christians we can't be identified with this stuff ain't nothing funny about it this stuff and leading people to hell you better see somebody say I hear all this and I see how I said she said I just had to send a little note in the mail just to say thank you thank you for being real thank you for keeping it right thank you thank you that we at least got one representative ain't sugarcoating the gospel it is what it is since I got family members living in this homosexual lifestyle but I'm telling this wrong that's right you gotta tell them it's wrong it's love that tells them they're wrong because love corrects anybody anybody agreeing with you and sin does not love you imma go into my message they trying to put are we trying to get a resurrection of some people glory to God look at this it says we've been if we are as beneficiary as quick and after being dead in darkness in a darkened world of unbelief where churches and denominations so forth had drawn us out and there was something in US calling oh we want God we're hungry and thirsting for God We join the Methodist Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterians and what more and still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet all of a sudden while we was groping in darkness the Great Resurrection came to us anybody has it I I know if you sitting here if you sitting here under the sound of my voice the great Resurrection has come to you I told you the resurrection is not an event the resurrection is a person of the Lord Jesus Christ the great Resurrection has come to you come to us in the manifestation of the promised word of God oh my God remember sister Dixon telling me the testimony when she first heard this message she said she grabbed the whole the book pulled it close to her chest she heard she heard brother Brandon preachers say Lord we need them here she was sincere and since she was sincere she heard God speak back to her come on somebody oh she heard the voice of God Speak the resurrection spoke to her and said he is here it turned her tears into Joy and if she ain't got nothing else she got that he is here and I'm identified with them see I'm gonna tell you when you got people like this that don't have their experience with God when the Resurrection comes to them you can't change their minds if this intellect ain't gonna get it I had an experience with God oh my God my God my God that great Resurrection came to us in a manifestation of the promised word of God I can just I can I can go all into that you realize when we talk about the manifestation of the promised word of God Malachi 4 is a manifestation of the promised word of God Revelation 10 is a manifestation of the promised word of God Revelation 18 4 I heard The Voice come out of her my people that's a manifestation of the promised word of God he was a manifestation of the promised word of God I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption he manifested every word God that every word of God that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on Easter morning Romans 8 11 told us about and I mentioned this earlier and just hit it again you you experience a revelation a resurrection when you when you left the things of the world you experienced the resurrection some of us experience the resurrection when we came out of dead denominationalism to this manifested word for this day Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you I'm going back to the message faith and I'm going to the second quote that I have listed there in the message faith on the first page says now when we receive Christ into our hearts there's all that we have need there's eternal life when you truly receive Christ in your hearts it says now Christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled because his spirit was behind a screen like a bar I want y'all to get this I told you he had power to lay himself down he had power to pick himself up but he also had power to stay there for three days he had to stay there because he kept saying in three days I'm gonna do this in three days so he could not come before three days otherwise he would have broke the word he had to have Oh my he had to have power to control himself that's probably the greatest power right there not only power to give up my rights and lay my life down but already know that if I did lay my life down then I wouldn't make her way for man to come back into the presence of God so I gotta lay my life my life down but I also know that when I lay it down the power's already in me while I'm sitting here talking to you while I'm while I'm uh mentioning these things I want you to know I got power to lay it down ain't no man gonna take my life no nobody gonna do that they tried and they got pushed off by the power of the Holy Ghost but I gotta yield myself to this but the same power I have to yield myself I got power to pick my own self up can I put it this way you don't need people to encourage you you got to encourage it inside of you [Music] that ain't no reason to stop serving God because ain't nobody encourage you David said David said I encourage sometimes you gotta talk to yourself I encourage myself in the Lord somebody might not send you a card all the time in the mail but you can still Encourage Yourself God bless you yeah God bless you everything I'm going through but I'm gonna make it I'm going yes I'm gonna make it I don't I haven't been through this I haven't been through that I can make it through this too sister Keisha call me recently say brother Jack I got this song in my mind and I just can't remember who sung in it who all the words and and it's just like could you send it to me because I said yeah what is it they used to say you can make it you can make it hey this trial you're going through God's gonna show you just what to do you can make it come on somebody you can make it I don't care what's going wrong God won't let it last too long you're not in this thing alone you can [Applause] demonstrate this he had power to hide himself behind that bar in the grave now how you know I'm over here you can hear my voice you might not be able to see me but you know I'm here Jesus was in the grave and he could not come out because there was a promise there in amen Psalm 16 10. so that's what thou would not leave my soul in hell neither will thy suffer thine Holy One to see corruption so he had to stay there three days power to keep him in the grave but on the third day praise God resurrection power came out the grave and he lives forever more there was a promise that kept him in the grave there was a promise that took him to the Grave there's a promise that got him out of the grave I wanted to say it like this we have some saints go on before us but all of them experience a personal amen a spiritual resurrection and some even experience a physical Resurrection mother Tillman experience a physical Resurrection come on somebody hallelujah amen and I want you to understand now when Jesus died on the cross within a minute he could have opened his eyes because he had power to do so amen within 24 hours he could open his eyes because he had power to do so within 48 Hours he had power to open amen and come out of grave because he had power to do so but he stayed there because of a promise in the scripture I asked earlier Elisha man that guy could lay on your bones and just jump back to his people why are you laying there the same resurrection power that Christ had our love was had in them before they left here and at any moment you know at in five minutes God could have raised them up Mother Temple was going to think about uh eight minutes or something like that God brought her back come on somebody Hallelujah God could have brought it back amen again an hour could have brought it back again in another day I mean he could have been been just like our Lazarus after four days brought him right back amen amen but why why why would they be behind the screen what why can they go behind the bar what's keeping them behind the bar because they got a scripture that they need to reveal and I cannot give you the scripture they are hell behind the bar because of a scripture not that there's no power in our God the same power that kept him behind the bar is the same power that brought him up but what is this power that that that's keeping them amen from from being a physical manifestation with us right now [Applause] please let's get on people to a sister Nelly it's right there in the Bible but there's a power Resurrection Powers inside of them and if you happen to go the same way resurrection power it's already inside of you those of you with the Holy Ghost let's read it first Thessalonians chapter 4. hey I love Jesus for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first that's the scripture that keeps them behind the bar it just keeps them there but we know we're gonna see him again because Resurrection powers in the bones it says then we which Our Lives remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord and Paul said wherefore Comfort one another with these words I know sometimes you might get to missing some of the ones that's going on but Resurrection pot was laying in them and I want you to know something here amen that uh that power that is in him is gonna get him up but that same power's not keeping them behind the bar amen if I can put it that way uh you know beyond uh beyond the Curtis I'm just keeping them there just for a little bit because they got to fulfill that scripture and if you happen to go that way you got to fulfill that scripture but it's still resurrection power in you one way or the other one day we may be in here worshiping and we'll see that resurrection power I was just thinking this morning as I was in prayer it might be coming to servicing this young fella come running down the aisle and run down the island get to the front of the church it just all right don't know what to do with himself cause he never heard these things before you look up you say hey that's brother Mike amen I thought it might be a sister sitting down sitting on a second row with a hat tilted and she won't be 80 years old but she about be about 20 years old he'd be looking to say who is this new sister and then sister Tina come up and sing I have a testimony and you'll see that sister get up out of seat throw our hands in the air begin to worship God like you never saw before who is this Sister Sister Tillman you see another slender sister amen with black hair you never seen her like that before cause when you knew she had gray hair white hair but she was just as young as everybody else glory to God but with a black cast say who was that Sister Sister wayson then there might be another fella kind of tall walk inside the church he won't come here but he want to go and appeals a plus with a seats are nice because he said you graduated if you sit down on the chair start looking around saying my God the church doesn't grow what happened to the church brother Lim damn and I can see another fella come he might be running around because he don't mind getting out there with the young people he owed us I don't know what but he don't mind getting out there with the young people to shoot him what he can do he may take you up and say I'm gonna race you he may walk up to the front of the church and said take a look at the poop and say yeah it's still hurting on it's still steady then brother brothers please say I added this and I added that but we still got the basics Hallelujah and then he'll pull you to the side and start talking to you about some sprouts brother purse is in the house resurrection power it was in them it was in them before they left here it's in them keeping them behind the screen but the dead in Christ will rise first and we which are alive that's the key you just can't be alive but you got to be alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord we'll see him again resurrection power and if you don't have that resurrection power in you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost my advice is repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which is resurrection power you want to be able to Rejoice like the other Saints rejoice when when my dad was called home resurrection power came out my brother it was always there no matter what he was going through resurrection power was in them sometimes just take a certain situation to release resurrection power in you let me just read a couple more things and close here today my God brother random said this in the message faith I'm going to the third quote there just a little portion of it maybe about two sentences he says this now each one of you each one of you I guess I didn't finish the last one did I let me go back to the last one I'll just roll right into the next one uh that second one it says now when we receive Christ in our hearts there's all that we have need of there's eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days with fulfill because the spirit was behind the screen like a bar like this that he could not cross over that bar because it was a spoken word of God that he was delay in the grief for three days and three nights now now he could not come back until that three days and nights was up then when three days and nights was up his Spirit was loose it went directly to his son and soul come back and picked up the body and fulfilled what he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up up again I have power it goes on to say this now each one of you have power the same way because you are the sons and daughters of God and the Very Spirit that's in you this morning the holy spirit says in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up I like this statement so you have power power to raise yourself back up and if you've fallen into sin you have power to fall in you got power to get out [Music] let me go to it's the rising of the Sun when this is going to be paragraph 35 I think is the second quote there I believe I'm not sure it might be the first one but he says this when they say that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever that his power isn't the same that his gospel is the same when the Bible says is the same God defied every denomination every Creed and they move forth with his holy spirit as he promised and proved it to us that he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quickened after being dead in the world in sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus his Spirit brings the same life again on the earth if the spirit of God that raised up Christ the body the anointed body if the spirit of God anointed that body in such a way when that seed fell into the Earth he just wouldn't let him rest there no he quickened him and raised him up that same Spirit by the same works by the same Power by the same size be in you it'll also raise you up I'm skipping down to uh paragraph 94 Amen in that same sermon uh just quoting the scripture Ephesians 2 1 says you have to Quicken who were dead and trespasses and sins paragraph 94 says this as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll and look at that the bride coming of Christ leaving denominationalism amen we didn't get that Pride coming of Christ we left the nominationalism we were resurrected out of denominations amen hallelujah that was Christ's pulling us out of there the resurrection came to us amen came preached all in one sermon but I'm here to tell you the resurrection came to me just like he came to the brothers on the road team man he came to me on the road timings he broke the open the scriptures and they understood him by scripture the reason I believe this message is because of what scripture says the resurrection came to me now he's living in me I got resurrection power look he says he was the first person of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of church there will have to be a sheath waved again the last days oh my waving of the chief what was the chief the first one that comes to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was weighed over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride age for Resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that uh that the full maturity of the word has turned back again and it's full of power and being weighed over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also amen that's what we read in the Book of John it says uh what a resurrection that was Glory but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to me be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power I gotta skip I gotta skip I gotta skip I'm going to paragraph 102. amen and remember we are flesh of his flesh remember he says I was trying to get this message to them I'm just giving you the things that just a highlight of some of the things he was trying to get to us he says remember we are the Flesh of his flesh Jesus Christ we are flesh versus bones of his bones oh there's no way out of it we're going to rise that's all no way out of it we're going to rise that's all you're going to rise 102 102. okay I'm sorry uh I tell you what just put in your your search there put in you're going to rise just put that in you're going to rise why were you posturing apostrophe re you're going to rise tell your neighbor why they're pulling this up you're going to rise there it is I'm sorry these different Technologies they do that to you so I'm sorry um but it says um here now let me get it he said remember we're flesh of his flesh Jesus Christ where fleshers Flesh and Bones of his bones oh there's no
