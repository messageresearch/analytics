[6:15] the ear to me deliver me speedily be
[6:20] thou my strong rock for a house of
[6:23] Defence to save me for thou art my rock
[6:27] and my fortress therefore for thy name's
[6:31] sake lead me and guide me pull me out of
[6:35] the net that they have laid privily for
[6:37] me but thou art my strength into that
[6:40] hand I commit my spirit
[6:42] thou has redeemed me O Lord God of truth
[6:45] I have painted them that regard live
[6:48] vanities but I trust in the Lord I will
[6:51] be glad and rejoice in my mercy for thou

[40:53] a fetus six starting at verse ten so
[40:59] finally my brother be strong in the Lord
[41:01] and the power his may put up put on the
[41:04] whole armour of God that you may be able
[41:07] to stand against the wiles of the devil
[41:10] but we also not against flesh and blood
[41:12] but against principalities powers
[41:15] against rulers of darkness of this world
[41:18] against spiritual wickedness in high
[41:20] places
[41:22] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[41:25] God as you may be able to withstand in
[41:27] the evil day having done all to stand
[41:30] and stand let's go to 2nd Corinthians 4
[41:42] during the verse 1 therefore seeing we
[41:45] have this ministry as we have received
[41:47] mercy we faint not but have renounced
[41:52] the hidden things of dishonesty not
[41:55] walking in crafting out hell in the Word
[41:57] of God deceitfully but by manifestation
[42:00] of the truth commending ourselves to
[42:03] every man's conscience in the sight of
[42:05] God and if I would also be here is here
[42:08] to them that a loss and whom the god of
[42:11] this world has blinded the minds of them
[42:15] which believe not lest the light of the
[42:17] glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[42:19] image of God should shine unto them
[42:21] note what they are blinded they are
[42:23] blinded in their mind Amen they can't
[42:26] they can't get a revelation they can't
[42:28] understand the thing that God called the
[42:30] garlotte is in your world has blinded
[42:32] their mind for we preached not our self
[42:35] but crises of the Lord and I was self
[42:38] your servant for Christ's sake for God
[42:41] who commanded the light to shine out of
[42:43] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[42:46] give the light of the knowledge of the
[42:48] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[42:51] Jesus but we have this treasure in
[42:53] earthen vessel that he see X and their
[42:56] power may be of God and not of us
[42:58] anything that's a free Henne father
[43:02] surely Lord we counted a privilege to be
[43:04] gathered here with the Saints tonight
[43:06] Lord and God I just asked you to move us
[43:09] aside Lord they might be blessed Lord
[43:12] may you may your president be recognized
[43:14] by the Lord we know when we realize that
[43:16] you are here Lord then that's a
[43:19] celluloid car there's nothing too hard
[43:20] for you you're able and willing to meet
[43:23] in the need that we have Lord and I just
[43:25] pray God you break the bread of life -
[43:27] and may it fall on good ground and bring
[43:29] forth fruit subito like I asked in the
[43:32] name of Jesus Christ amen
[43:34] we've been you may be seated I want to
[43:37] free showing up the bell of the mind a
[43:40] man we know that there's a great warfare

[44:04] principle but we're fighting for eternal
[44:07] life hey this culture will give it
[44:10] everything for it well done forever it's
[44:13] worth living for this is the greatest
[44:15] call that it ever was

[44:46] grave warfare but we are more than

[44:53] inside of hell over a company amen amen
[44:59] and that's what what you got to meet
[45:02] your enemy is in your life there's the
[45:05] battleground there was Satan and God is

[45:12] are trying to ignore it you throw to
[45:14] just bleed or are they going away but
[45:16] God is trying to get you to breathe a
[45:18] word and then I would drop down in your
[45:20] heart here become a revelation
[45:22] so then when you got to meet you enemy
[45:25] is in your mind it's same kind of
[45:28] feature in your mind then you are this
[45:30] feeder person amen amen so called a word

[45:46] her knowledge there's got to be a
[45:48] revelation
[45:49] hey man you know a lot of people they
[45:51] get a lot of the hair but it got to come
[45:54] in the heart I will say if you get too
[45:56] much of the hair you come top-heavy and
[45:58] then you follow favorite where you get a
[46:02] heart you got a revelation
[46:05] representing the greatest fellow will
[46:07] fall
[46:08] so the mine is the gate to the soul your
[46:11] man opened up a cell to spirit a
[46:14] rejecter spirit amen
[46:17] he said you can have love caution and
[46:18] love feeling and listen say
[46:21] the only thing that had nothing to do
[46:23] with it everybody just sensations thing
[46:26] but when it come into reality your mind

[51:37] justice here
[51:46] verse three
[51:50] so do we walk in the flesh we do not war
[51:53] after the flesh for the webinar our
[51:56] warfare are not calm but mighty through
[51:59] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[52:01] casting down imaginations and agree that
[52:07] that means reason cancer not imagination
[52:11] and a half thing that exalt itself
[52:14] against the knowledge of God and
[52:15] bringing into captivity every thought to
[52:18] the obedience of Christ
[52:19] all that we can do that we should be
[52:23] Victoria Christmas we can bring every
[52:24] thought to the obedience of the Word of
[52:26] God amen amen brother sir unbelief
[52:31] castle reason I'm lead rely on reason
[52:36] present-day Thane faith don't do that
[52:39] face hole at that word but faith plays a
[52:43] cell phone an hour rule of my rockem's
[52:46] art of God each hour and then they won't
[52:50] look at reason hey there amen I don't
[52:54] care how much you can show that it would
[52:56] be better if the word say so face rest
[53:00] is there and that's what your faith rest
[53:03] the word says all right don't matter
[53:06] what it looked like or what anybody else
[53:08] said what the word says there were faith
[53:10] with a man if you got a Revelator word
[53:13] nobody can take a revelation of love now
[53:18] if somebody talk you into somebody talk
[53:20] Janna they're a lot of people been
[53:23] around for 30 or 40 years the last four
[53:27] year therefore adorable yet they had
[53:30] knowledge of the message some of you
[53:32] preached it and it was good please you
[53:34] well give the caller debrief it anyway
[53:36] mmm but they went back because they had
[53:39] no revelation
[53:41] nobody can take a revelation from you
[53:45] and someone said I will deceive your
[53:47] world but that was before he came to the
[53:49] miss it and they never got a revelation
[53:54] so there's there to see there's some
[54:01] sake weights on that reason and they
[54:02] they reason so well it'd be better this
[54:05] is nothing to party ever
[54:07] and we are that you know what they say
[54:09] that we're just preaching a gospel of
[54:11] love love with the things of the world
[54:18] loan to be like the world they say we're
[54:22] free it does freedom deliver me from it
[54:25] then I don't say that outside of Christ
[54:29] they're free to live like the world well
[54:32] all sinners are free to live like the
[54:34] world hey hey man what are the crispy
[54:39] without caring it like the world will
[54:42] see you cry we'll see this then little a
[54:45] conjurer the Word of God amen
[54:51] Robel said that I missus from that time
[54:54] he's also spoke frankly all of us here
[54:57] tonight couldcould now it's all my
[55:00] memory I say I'm talking about Satan
[55:02] face you on memory and you know what
[55:05] remember you can recall faith in your
[55:07] mind experience that already pass and he
[55:11] said I suppose all of us tonight could
[55:15] recall the memory a certain thing that
[55:17] taken place at certain time and from
[55:21] that time something chain such and such
[55:24] a thing happened and from that time and
[55:26] for that time it was different and and
[55:29] it's a good thing that we can and some
[55:31] of those many are saying that that we
[55:34] think is where the thing that changed
[55:37] and there's something there's not worth
[55:40] think enough see there's something that
[55:44] a word thing you can think of the time
[55:46] that God got off your life if they
[55:49] change with you you won't difficult you
[55:51] know but the other thing that they're in
[55:54] your path they're not worried or faking
[55:56] them so st. Oliver Martin saying they
[56:01] will remind you or the good thing he
[56:03] will remind you
[56:04] and the bad thing when they start do
[56:07] just to remind him that he got the wrong
[56:09] address
[56:10] I mean he got the right house but
[56:13] they've got a little bit of oil your new
[56:16] creation and they're saying face you in
[56:21] your memory even when you guys get son
[56:23] from God Satan came bringing past sin in
[56:27] your memory
[56:28] a man so he accuses you used to do that
[56:31] you just tell him you didn't do it
[56:34] everybody that God did you don't have to
[56:37] be identified what it is hey man our
[56:43] middle story one guy is strong within
[56:47] town he met somebody grew up with him so
[56:48] I've met John and he knew he sees a new
[56:51] you there so yeah he's they used to do
[56:54] this and you used to do that
[56:55] so did you listen oh so well John said

[57:00] they got it died and they tell you see
[57:04] John tell them to come back I'll tell
[57:06] him how that old guy died hey say that I
[57:12] always try to identify you with your
[57:14] path anyway that Kristen you do
[57:16] something wrong and Satan keep beating
[57:18] you around the bus ride but if when it's
[57:20] under their blood God don't remember
[57:23] why are you meditating on it hey man
[57:28] we're not careful with other new Pitons
[57:30] say that God name of you do something
[57:32] wrong and the crisp enough no math you
[57:34] don't mean to do it here's a mistake God
[57:37] don't even counted against you listen to
[57:40] the man who God will not impute sin amen
[57:44] you're in the sin of the one God can't
[57:47] see you he's seen your sacrifice hey men
[57:51] but say no they will work on our
[57:54] numerous sometimes even in your friend
[57:56] you're trying to bleed God for a hill
[57:58] and it's hard to say remember so so
[58:00] trying it and they didn't get well
[58:02] they've got nothing to do with it that's
[58:04] your faith and God and all things are
[58:08] possible doubly we should believe that
[58:10] we heard enough hey man that's at the
[58:13] theme of the campaign and
[58:14] the things I would use crisis same
[58:16] yesterday today forever
[58:18] the probably breached MSO more than any
[58:20] other breath messily guarded trying to
[58:22] get us to realize that he's the same God
[58:24] and all things are possible he'll garden
[58:28] will change he's a private a God he's
[58:31] not the god I was wait our world or the
[58:33] great I will be he's a great I am
[58:35] he's a peasant a God hey there hey man
[58:40] praise God

[59:11] those things which are behind and
[59:13] reaching forth under those things which

[59:35] God and no doubt Satan remind him but he
[59:39] said I forgot those things behind
[59:40] impress the Lord on a hot car in the
[59:43] dark in question and that's what we got
[59:45] to do no matter what you did in the past

[1:06:37] us he will subdue our iniquity and and
[1:06:41] will cast all our sealed at a delicacy
[1:06:45] now that's a seat he Catherine the devil
[1:06:48] see and in Hebrews 10 and 16 said this
[1:06:53] is the color that I will make with them
[1:06:55] after the old days said the law I will
[1:06:57] put my love in their heart and in their
[1:07:01] mind and I will write their first seven
[1:07:03] and their share their iniquity I will
[1:07:05] wrote never no more now they're in the
[1:07:08] scene he don't remember that's not like

[1:07:32] appraising verse you then
[1:07:34] report or think only thing every so
[1:07:38] we'll take all these things then we'll
[1:07:40] figure the right thing when you're
[1:07:41] thinking that they were to God then God
[1:07:43] can medicine the word in your life
[1:07:46] hey man even God during all time he told

[1:07:56] then show you how this is said then
[1:07:59] share your posture but a way to frost
[1:08:03] when you're meditating on the Word of

[1:09:19] Oh a lot of people imagine all kind of
[1:09:22] thing there's nothing to a man let's go
[1:09:27] let's go to Genesis Genesis 6
[1:09:35] verse five and God saw that the
[1:09:38] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[1:09:41] and that every imagination of the
[1:09:45] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:09:48] continually and repented God that he
[1:09:52] made me on earth and it grieved him in
[1:09:55] his heart and the Lord said I will
[1:09:58] destroy man who I have created from the
[1:10:01] face of the earth both man and beast and
[1:10:04] creeping things and the father laugh
[1:10:05] they repented me that I have made you
[1:10:08] and Noah found grace and I have to go H
[1:10:11] if I'm glad you found grace than either
[1:10:13] God remember why they do Rebecca every
[1:10:16] imagination of man life will weaken and

[1:27:24] for when for time we ought to be
[1:27:26] teachers we have me that one teach you

[1:27:33] the Oracles of God
[1:27:34] I become Setia have need a milk and not
[1:27:38] of strong meat for everyone to use milk
[1:27:40] is unskilled in the word of
[1:27:42] righteousness for his urbane but
[1:27:44] strongly blown to them little foolish
[1:27:46] even though who by reason of use have
[1:27:48] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:27:51] good and evil a message some people
[1:27:55] don't they conscious a lot of knowledge
[1:27:57] so right and wrong and from that day
[1:27:59] people don't know what right and what's
[1:28:01] wrong
[1:28:04] hey man you know something but they
[1:28:09] think Allah is right with his own a man
[1:28:12] I've got what mobility by some
[1:28:14] politician and while it was the water
[1:28:18] would an old day I think it's a barrel
[1:28:20] incident you know he always tell the

[1:28:55] want to right and wrong or what true in
[1:28:57] error oh they think if your guest for
[1:29:01] Virgin hornacek you saying your praises
[1:29:03] you know I told her that's prejudice I
[1:29:06] said well if I'm against prostitution if
[1:29:09] that praises so no I said well that's
[1:29:12] worse than positive is more of a
[1:29:15] perversion but they don't know like like
[1:29:21] Pilate asked Jesus he said what is true
[1:29:24] Jesus I come to the truth may be
[1:29:26] manifested every one of the truth bleeds
[1:29:29] me here's me and Paula so what is true
[1:29:32] well he was standing in the face of
[1:29:34] truth and after one is true and people
[1:29:37] right at the word of God and say what is
[1:29:39] true so they don't know what true when
[1:29:42] they see it robust it in an oddball to
[1:29:49] do you know
[1:29:50] preach that they can't judge which is
[1:29:52] right the Word of God or their chest
[1:29:54] denomination oh you can tell them that
[1:29:58] but they they take their narration on
[1:30:00] all right what do married people and
[1:30:03] they asked their pastor and the pastor
[1:30:05] said this so that's what they got past
[1:30:07] the religion that's the absolute I one

[1:30:18] Jesus Christ that's a yeah that's right
[1:30:20] while all these people bow down in the
[1:30:22] towel the falls are noble to go I know

[1:30:27] spirit you for that was I'm glad yes so
[1:30:31] I gave him bunch of script he looked him
[1:30:32] up - yeah yeah
[1:30:33] he called it faster in the pastor said
[1:30:35] we don't have no true record I had our
[1:30:37] fossil real about that so you don't have
[1:30:41] a true record you just read out of the
[1:30:42] bowel I said and they just be talking
[1:30:44] you guys you know believe the bowels are
[1:30:46] true record but they're they believe it
[1:30:49] faster then you read it either way to go

[1:31:52] capable of judging right role

[1:45:10] the Lord just coming I brought those
[1:45:11] things to our hearts the this greatest
[1:45:15] battle a man the Battle of the mind the
[1:45:18] Prophet gives us that this is the
[1:45:20] greatest battle ever fought was the one
[1:45:22] that section felt in mine and I love
[1:45:25] that once they've made you you can't
[1:45:27] overcome with a head knowledge if it's
[1:45:31] gonna have to be a revelation something
[1:45:32] that God drops down and your heart and I
[1:45:34] think too many people are actually
[1:45:37] trying to overcome just what we're
[1:45:39] heading on you know and it's very easy
[1:45:42] to get hit knowledge you know you can
[1:45:44] just hang around the church and learn
[1:45:47] behaviors you can learn patterns you can
[1:45:52] learn how to act just like everybody
[1:45:54] else act you know I mean all that's a
[1:45:56] learned behavior but if it's not in the
[1:45:58] heart when the battle comes right when
[1:46:02] when the trial actually hits a man the
[1:46:05] devil will wipe you out
[1:46:07] all right so church make sure we don't
[1:46:10] have this thing in our head but it's got
[1:46:12] to be way down a man and in the heart a
[1:46:16] man it's in the heart we appreciate you

[1:46:45] all right we'll we'll the one thing that
[1:46:51] the brother Willa was talking about is
[1:46:54] how the devil just like to bring a past
[1:46:56] against us we make mistakes I love that
[1:47:01] the scripture jesus said that God don't
[1:47:04] even impute a man those things against
[1:47:07] us when we're you know when we're really
[1:47:09] walking underneath the blood he don't
[1:47:10] even you don't even look at the mistakes
[1:47:13] right
[1:47:14] it's one thing to willfully do some
[1:47:16] things wrong and it's another thing you
[1:47:18] know when you just kind of make a
[1:47:19] mistake and you do something you quickly
[1:47:21] repent but this song says the blood that
[1:47:24] gives me strength from day to day but
[1:47:26] never lose this power and that's why
[1:47:28] we're grateful they meant for what Jesus
[1:47:30] did at Calvary is cross we don't have to
[1:47:32] walk around with our heads hanging down
[1:47:34] we can lift them up because our God has
