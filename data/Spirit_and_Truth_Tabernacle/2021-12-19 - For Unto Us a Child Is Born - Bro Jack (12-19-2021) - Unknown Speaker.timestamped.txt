[56:02] was eight years ago that i preached this
[56:05] and so a lot of y'all when they one went
[56:07] around when i preached it so let's be
[56:10] fresh
[56:11] for some of y'all
[56:13] uh but for the others it'll be somewhat
[56:15] of a refresher
[56:16] uh during this christmas season
[56:19] uh
[56:20] but uh nonetheless i believe the lord
[56:22] will bless us a man in our journey amen
[56:25] on today isaiah 9 and verse 6
[56:29] who says
[56:31] for unto us
[56:34] a child is born
[56:36] unto us

[57:07] that endure to all generations
[57:09] and father we pray that you will just
[57:12] get the glory
[57:14] out of the thought that's being
[57:15] presented your word is eternal

[57:20] you give it to us again in another
[57:21] season
[57:23] uh for we you have purpose uh for it
[57:26] every time you do
[57:27] we pray father that you would just uh
[57:30] take control over this portion of
[57:32] service thank you for your anointing
[57:33] that has been here through the song
[57:35] service and lord just through the
[57:37] specials everything that's been done has

[57:42] so in jesus name we pray
[57:45] amen
[57:46] amen god bless you can be seated amen
[57:49] this morning
[57:50] uh we want to just
[57:53] use for our topic today
[57:56] for unto us
[57:59] a child is born
[58:02] man for unto us
[58:04] a child is born
[58:06] amen and like i said i i ministered on
[58:09] this some years ago and i'm sure to go
[58:11] different today but nonetheless we want
[58:14] to just
[58:14] enjoy
[58:16] the presence of the lord
[58:18] amen i want to just start amen by
[58:20] reading uh a couple of quotes uh from uh
[58:25] first sermon would be sirs we would see
[58:27] jesus
[58:28] amen sirs we would see jesus
[58:31] and um and as i'm as i'm reading this my
[58:33] wife did bring it to my attention and i
[58:35] just realized it again this morning uh i
[58:38] use a older version of the software to
[58:41] actually form my sermons
[58:43] and uh and when they're pulling up the
[58:45] quotes amen on the screen it is a newer
[58:48] version of the software so i think they
[58:51] have changed some of the words or just
[58:52] went back and edited and tried to make
[58:54] it as clear as possible in the new
[58:56] version so uh i might worries that i
[58:59] might read may not be on the screen but
[59:01] it's okay we still read the same thing
[59:03] and eventually i will get synchronized
[59:05] with what they have on the screen so
[59:07] just bear with us amen
[59:09] as we go sirs we would see jesus
[59:13] um the prophet says
[59:15] what what's the matter he's got lost
[59:19] again and he's talking about christ amen
[59:22] and and and especially he preached his
[59:25] sermon
[59:26] on new year's i'm sorry christmas eve in
[59:28] in 1961 uh this was his christmas sermon
[59:32] that he was bringing and uh he was just
[59:34] talking about how christ is lost again
[59:36] uh in the christmas season and and we
[59:38] all know that uh
[59:41] my they have completely kicked jesus out
[59:44] now it was never his birthday in the
[59:46] first place
[59:47] right we understand that it was never
[59:48] his birthday in the first place uh but
[59:50] it wasn't a time where people had to
[59:52] acknowledge
[59:54] uh what it was all about right when they
[59:56] were celebrating him they were
[59:58] celebrating his his birth and everything
[1:00:00] but now santa claus has taken his place
[1:00:02] and and so many other things have taken
[1:00:04] his place uh but uh but we want to you
[1:00:06] know just we want to keep the focus on
[1:00:08] christ amen at least that's what i want
[1:00:10] to do i want to keep it about jesus amen
[1:00:13] for unto us a child is born amen it says
[1:00:17] well what's the matter he's he got lost
[1:00:19] again people's lost him
[1:00:22] that's right but he he's been lost again
[1:00:25] in the big crowds
[1:00:27] the crowds of creeds
[1:00:29] uh you remember one time he got lost to
[1:00:31] his parents he's lost again
[1:00:34] he got lost go down these streets like
[1:00:37] it's been the last few days look at the
[1:00:40] mad crowds pushing and shoving and
[1:00:42] drinking and cursing and damning jingle
[1:00:45] bells jingle bells christ is lost
[1:00:49] he ain't lost the people's lost him
[1:00:52] where did they find him where they lost
[1:00:54] him amen where they lost him at that's
[1:00:57] where we'll find him but he's lost in
[1:01:00] their creeds and in
[1:01:03] the crowds praise the name of the lord
[1:01:05] you know uh you know and as i'm gonna go
[1:01:08] on in this quote a little bit but uh
[1:01:10] things just continue to change brother
[1:01:12] branham you know talking here in 1961
[1:01:14] just look at the crowds traffic get
[1:01:16] unbelievable you know this time of year
[1:01:19] it's it's just and people do some crazy
[1:01:22] things
[1:01:23] you know out there on the road you know
[1:01:24] and it's like my god we all you know
[1:01:27] what
[1:01:28] what is this you know and uh and and
[1:01:30] it's really really uh unfortunate that
[1:01:33] that people just get so much in debt at
[1:01:35] a time like this
[1:01:36] at this time of year it's really not
[1:01:38] supposed to be that way amen that that's
[1:01:41] that's it
[1:01:42] my god i i i
[1:01:44] i you know it's just it's a it's a shame
[1:01:46] what it has become but uh but you know
[1:01:48] the other thing that i realized is that
[1:01:50] things continue to shift um
[1:01:53] some actually the the the the streets
[1:01:56] are more loaded with amazon trucks amen
[1:01:59] and ups trucks

[1:02:27] certain time

[1:02:38] unbelievable what what is going on in
[1:02:41] our world and the way things have have
[1:02:43] just shifted and changed you know uh
[1:02:46] just to satisfy people trying to get a
[1:02:48] particular package by a particular day
[1:02:51] hallelujah it keeps a lot of people in
[1:02:53] business i can tell you that much
[1:02:55] uh but he says here he says um

[1:04:01] they lost him in christmas they lost him
[1:04:03] in easter bunny rabbit or a new hat not
[1:04:06] the resurrection not the birth of christ
[1:04:08] they lost him in their creeds when they
[1:04:10] made three gods out of him chopped them
[1:04:12] into pieces and made an idol instead of
[1:04:15] knowing who he is i and my father are
[1:04:17] one you lost him
[1:04:19] amen amen this morning i want to say
[1:04:22] we're not lost we know exactly what this
[1:04:24] is all about and and this is why i read
[1:04:26] the scripture for unto us a child is
[1:04:29] born unto us a son is given and the
[1:04:32] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:04:34] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:04:36] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[1:04:39] father the prince of peace and he said
[1:04:41] he said they lost them in amongst creeds
[1:04:44] they mean they lost amongst dogma they
[1:04:46] lost him amen even in some of their
[1:04:48] teachings they they fail to realize that
[1:04:51] when when god was sending jesus to the
[1:04:53] earth it wasn't just sending his son but
[1:04:56] god himself became the son so that he
[1:04:59] could die for our sins
[1:05:01] see unto us a child was born and there
[1:05:04] was a purpose for that child coming amen
[1:05:06] amen amen let's go on a little further
[1:05:09] here amen uh i want to read from the
[1:05:11] message the deity of jesus christ
[1:05:14] glory
[1:05:16] hallelujah hallelujah he says this
[1:05:19] no room for him
[1:05:21] people around here saying
[1:05:23] that they are of christ they're churches
[1:05:25] of christ they go to
[1:05:27] and what happened last night open up
[1:05:29] their christmas presents let's see about
[1:05:31] daddy in there i was under the christmas
[1:05:34] tree of a mini man last night set a big
[1:05:37] box of beer somewhere no room for jesus
[1:05:41] i want you to keep jesus amen the reason
[1:05:43] for the season no room for jesus all for
[1:05:46] beer open up mama's present a deck of
[1:05:49] cards no room for christ the cards
[1:05:52] that's right instead of a little bible
[1:05:54] or something to the children it's a
[1:05:56] little g-man book or a little something
[1:05:58] like that no room for jesus instead of
[1:06:01] going to church they go to shows dances
[1:06:03] everything and call themselves
[1:06:05] christians brother when the deity of god
[1:06:08] by the holy ghost comes into the human
[1:06:11] heart it calls out everything that
[1:06:14] christ hasn't created you know that's
[1:06:17] the truth
[1:06:18] amen it's the truth anyhow it says god
[1:06:21] christ the hope of glory in you not in a
[1:06:24] cradle in you that was one time god was
[1:06:28] back in the beginning then he come into
[1:06:30] moses he he come in the children of
[1:06:32] israel he come in the cradle but now
[1:06:35] they're worshiping him way back like
[1:06:37] some prehistoric something when christ
[1:06:40] is in you
[1:06:43] glory to god here he is today the son of
[1:06:46] god moving up his great church
[1:06:48] is moving i say amen
[1:06:51] to that amen we're not looking at christ
[1:06:53] in the cradle but we're looking at
[1:06:55] christ in one another all right let me
[1:06:58] go a little further here amen glory to
[1:07:00] god we're going to turn a corner uh
[1:07:03] i love to always try to keep uh our
[1:07:07] focus on jesus amen when it comes to the
[1:07:10] season
[1:07:11] and i'm not telling you don't go out and
[1:07:13] buy gifts brother branham did it he
[1:07:15] bought gifts for his uh for his family
[1:07:17] amen and there's nothing wrong with that
[1:07:19] just don't get out of control with it
[1:07:21] amen don't don't get out of control with
[1:07:23] it and make sure you treat all the kids
[1:07:25] equally now praise the lord don't get
[1:07:28] one some a big extravagant something
[1:07:30] other than got pencils
[1:07:35] and then you're wondering why you got a
[1:07:36] problem in your house
[1:07:38] right as parents you got to treat all
[1:07:40] your kids the same that's the way god
[1:07:42] treats us he treats us all the same i
[1:07:44] mean when a parent gives one child a
[1:07:46] little bit more favoritism than the
[1:07:48] other that's going to be a problem in
[1:07:50] that house
[1:07:51] amen hallelujah so make sure you keep
[1:07:55] them all on the same level
[1:07:57] no matter how you i might feel a little
[1:07:59] bit better about not don't show it
[1:08:01] don't show it
[1:08:03] amen not amongst the others you'll have
[1:08:05] problems in your house when you do that
[1:08:07] glory to god
[1:08:09] amen hallelujah somebody
[1:08:13] don't know why i got so quiet there but
[1:08:15] amen but god is good you know just just
[1:08:18] keep it all within balance church that's
[1:08:20] that's the main thing i think i think if
[1:08:22] we don't have balance with what we got
[1:08:24] then it's useless to us
[1:08:27] right that chair that you're sitting in
[1:08:29] got balance
[1:08:30] and what what it balances is those four
[1:08:32] legs if there was only three legs on
[1:08:34] that chair you wouldn't sit in it
[1:08:37] it wouldn't it wouldn't it wouldn't do
[1:08:38] any good for you to have a chair like
[1:08:40] that right i mean you got to have
[1:08:42] balance in everything that you do
[1:08:44] glory to god and i believe the prophet
[1:08:47] certainly brought balance when it came
[1:08:48] to this holiday he said christmas is
[1:08:50] here to stay
[1:08:53] and one of the things they told us not
[1:08:54] to say don't deprive your children
[1:08:57] even though we know the truth of these
[1:08:58] things don't deprive your children of it
[1:09:00] that's what he said
[1:09:02] all right i'm not here to you know to go
[1:09:04] through that i'm here to talk about
[1:09:06] jesus for unto us a child is born
[1:09:11] hallelujah glory to god hey and if you
[1:09:14] always if y'all's to be honest with me
[1:09:15] we've been so dogmatic
[1:09:18] and so legalistic
[1:09:20] uh with christmas
[1:09:22] that we lost some of our family
[1:09:24] it's the truth in it how we didn't have
[1:09:26] to be that way
[1:09:28] but we some of sometimes we did things
[1:09:30] just purely out of fear
[1:09:32] somebody gonna preach it and the person
[1:09:34] that preaching did not have a balance on
[1:09:36] it
[1:09:37] it's the truth
[1:09:38] so we try to keep a balance on these
[1:09:40] things
[1:09:41] amen church all right all right all
[1:09:43] right now now um here i'm going back to
[1:09:46] this message um
[1:09:50] sirs we would see jesus
[1:09:53] and um
[1:09:54] as we read this scripture from us a
[1:09:56] child is born and oh my i forgot to set
[1:09:59] my timer
[1:10:01] uh i'll i'll try not to be here too long
[1:10:04] i i really will uh but just let's just
[1:10:07] let's let's
[1:10:08] let's let's enjoy ourselves
[1:10:12] the bible says for unto us a child is
[1:10:13] born untouchable son has given and the
[1:10:16] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:10:18] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:10:20] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[1:10:22] father the prince of peace brother
[1:10:24] branham says in his quotes lest
[1:10:26] he says isaiah said his name should be
[1:10:29] called in the same chapter he said his
[1:10:31] name shall be called it says the 55th
[1:10:33] chapter of isaiah now we just read it
[1:10:35] out of isaiah 9. so we know that was not
[1:10:37] correct what he said it's a
[1:10:39] uh he says his name would be called
[1:10:41] a wonderful counsellor of the prince of
[1:10:43] peace the mighty god the everlasting
[1:10:46] father amen says wish i had time
[1:10:50] i ought to i like to take a text on each
[1:10:53] one of them
[1:10:55] and i wish i had time i like to just
[1:10:56] take a text and what he's saying he says
[1:10:59] he would love to take a text on on um
[1:11:02] wonderful
[1:11:05] all right amen or just take a text on
[1:11:08] counselor
[1:11:09] hallelujah and then just come and work
[1:11:12] with the mighty god
[1:11:15] boy this would be some preaching i i
[1:11:16] wish he would have took time and took a
[1:11:18] text once he would he would take a text
[1:11:20] on the everlasting father
[1:11:23] glory to god and then he would preach on
[1:11:26] the prince of peace
[1:11:29] he would just take all these and and and
[1:11:31] you know just just kind of work with him
[1:11:33] but today we're going to try to use a
[1:11:34] catch a couple of them by by the grace
[1:11:36] of god if we can but he says let's just
[1:11:39] strike the thought wonderful for a
[1:11:42] minute
[1:11:44] it says oh isaiah said he was wonderful
[1:11:47] amen let's think of some things that he
[1:11:50] said that made him wonderful amen tell
[1:11:54] me what uh what pharisee could have said
[1:11:58] that tell me what high priest could have
[1:12:00] said that with with god backing it up
[1:12:02] see uh if it don't um i'm sorry i missed
[1:12:05] some sense one what made him wonderful
[1:12:08] when he when he uh when he said this i
[1:12:10] and my father
[1:12:11] are one
[1:12:13] he said that made him wonderful when he
[1:12:15] said i and my father are one and and i
[1:12:18] like that because that very statement in
[1:12:21] itself
[1:12:22] glory to god it proves the theology of
[1:12:26] isaiah
[1:12:28] because isaiah said for unto us
[1:12:31] a child is born
[1:12:33] glory to god he says unto us a son is
[1:12:36] given and the government shall be upon
[1:12:38] his shoulder and his name shall be
[1:12:40] called wonderful counselor the mighty
[1:12:42] god look at this part the everlasting
[1:12:45] father how can a child
[1:12:48] that is born be the everlasting father
[1:12:50] but when this child steps up on the
[1:12:53] earth and he looks the pharisees and
[1:12:56] sadducees in the eye and he says i and
[1:12:59] my father are one
[1:13:01] brother that is wonderful
[1:13:03] [Applause]
[1:13:06] proving the theology of isaiah
[1:13:10] glory to god amen let's go on a little
[1:13:12] further man he says uh wonderful tell me
[1:13:15] what pharisee could have said that tell
[1:13:18] me what high priest could have said that
[1:13:20] with god backing it up see said if i
[1:13:23] don't do the works now don't believe
[1:13:25] anything i say but if i preach this then
[1:13:28] it shows that god sent me to do it said
[1:13:30] now
[1:13:31] he said i am my father one not i my
[1:13:34] father are three
[1:13:36] no jesus said now the creed says i and
[1:13:39] my father are three but the bible said
[1:13:42] that jesus said i and my father are one
[1:13:45] that's wonderful
[1:13:48] glory to god see how see how god made
[1:13:51] flesh hallelujah not some second or
[1:13:53] third or fourth person but god himself
[1:13:56] jesus said so argue with him not with me
[1:13:59] amen he says i'm just saying what he
[1:14:01] said i am my father one it's not me that
[1:14:04] doeth the works it's my father he dwells
[1:14:06] in me if you don't believe me believe
[1:14:08] the word because he's in the word and
[1:14:10] the word was made flesh and i am in in
[1:14:13] the beginning was the word the same
[1:14:15] gospel writer john said in the beginning
[1:14:17] was the word and the word was with god
[1:14:19] and the word was god and the word was
[1:14:21] made flesh and dwelt among us that makes
[1:14:23] him and god the same person if god is
[1:14:26] the word and he is the word i and my
[1:14:28] father are one then oh that's wonderful
[1:14:32] yes sir so many things we could say on
[1:14:34] that wonderful things
[1:14:36] he said
[1:14:38] as i looked at this word wonderful
[1:14:40] it means astonishing
[1:14:43] miraculous
[1:14:45] uh extraordinary
[1:14:47] as in magnifice
[1:14:49] magnificence
[1:14:50] amen this is what uh the word wonderful
[1:14:53] means and you know there's things that
[1:14:55] he said but there's also things that he
[1:14:57] did
[1:14:58] that would make him
[1:15:00] wonderful
[1:15:01] amen and and one of the uh the very
[1:15:04] first things that that that was recorded
[1:15:06] in scripture of him doing amen was when
[1:15:09] he showed up to a wedding
[1:15:11] hallelujah as a guest to a wedding
[1:15:14] amen it's good to have jesus
[1:15:16] at your wedding
[1:15:18] glory to god and here he comes as a
[1:15:21] guest to the wedding just like all the
[1:15:23] other guests he has turned in his rsvp
[1:15:27] if i can if i can put it that way he's
[1:15:29] let them know that he would be there and
[1:15:32] he gets there to to the wedding and you
[1:15:34] know and you can tell this was uh one of
[1:15:37] those marriages where maybe uh they had
[1:15:40] spent all their money trying to get a
[1:15:42] dress amen and maybe trying to secure a
[1:15:45] venue they don't spend all the money
[1:15:47] until amen when they when they get here
[1:15:49] amen and and they're just looking good
[1:15:52] in front of everybody's eyes but when
[1:15:54] the wine begins to run out
[1:15:56] hallelujah somebody this is when they
[1:15:59] are exposed and
[1:16:00] because back in those days when you when
[1:16:02] you when you serve your guests amen uh
[1:16:05] you give them the best one at the
[1:16:06] beginning hoping that they wouldn't want
[1:16:08] no more wine a little bit later and then
[1:16:10] you give them the worst wine at the end
[1:16:12] hallelujah but at this wedding glory to
[1:16:14] god they began to run out of wine and
[1:16:16] it was it was a desperate situation and
[1:16:19] jesus mother happened to be there mary
[1:16:22] happened to be there and she said now uh
[1:16:24] she said nothing out now jesus they got
[1:16:26] a problem
[1:16:27] uh well what's the problem he said they
[1:16:29] don't run out of wine so they ain't got
[1:16:32] nothing to do with me say now uh i'm
[1:16:34] coming to you because i know you can do
[1:16:36] something about it now the reason i say
[1:16:37] this the first recorded amen uh a
[1:16:41] miracle in the scripture i believe mary
[1:16:43] saw some things in the house
[1:16:46] come on somebody i believe mary
[1:16:48] experienced some things in her own house
[1:16:50] that she knew
[1:16:52] amen that she could go to jesus and get
[1:16:55] this problem resolved
[1:16:57] no other guest at that wedding would be
[1:16:59] able to solve this problem he she knew
[1:17:02] this would be an embarrassment to the
[1:17:04] family this would be a man just shame on
[1:17:06] the friend could you do something about
[1:17:08] it jesus
[1:17:09] and when she when he finally maybe just
[1:17:11] gave a little look she said now whatever
[1:17:13] he tell you to do just go do it
[1:17:17] whatever you tell you to do just go do
[1:17:19] it say now take me some pots
[1:17:21] and just fill them up with water now
[1:17:24] maybe these people thinking to
[1:17:25] themselves why would i just go get pots
[1:17:27] and fill them up what look don't
[1:17:28] question jesus whatever he tells you to
[1:17:31] do just do that
[1:17:34] went and got the pucks and filled him up
[1:17:36] with water and as he as he he prayed
[1:17:38] over it and blessed it he said that wine
[1:17:40] was better than the wine at the original
[1:17:42] how did he say y'all done save the best
[1:17:45] wine for last
[1:17:46] i can tell you right now the parents
[1:17:49] amen that were not embarrassed at that
[1:17:51] that child's wedding would look to jesus
[1:17:54] and say this man is wonderful
[1:18:00] this man is astonishing
[1:18:02] this man is miraculous
[1:18:04] this man is extraordinary
[1:18:09] hallelujah
[1:18:10] glory to god i think amen
[1:18:13] uh brother branham even brought it and
[1:18:15] as i don't i won't read the entire quote
[1:18:17] but if you kept reading in that brother
[1:18:19] brandon start talking about how he was
[1:18:21] on his way a man into a city one day and
[1:18:24] and as he's uh going to the city just
[1:18:26] happened to be passing through the city
[1:18:27] of name and as he's passing through uh
[1:18:31] at the time he's walking by here comes a
[1:18:34] a mother that just had a funeral burying
[1:18:36] her son her only son
[1:18:38] amen uh and as she as she's buried him
[1:18:41] and tears are flowing down her her her
[1:18:43] cheeks and you know she's just uh my
[1:18:45] what am i gonna do and and just what
[1:18:48] happened they pat they they crack they
[1:18:50] pass crossed at the right time
[1:18:53] and when jesus saw the buyer going by
[1:18:55] the bible say all he did was just touch
[1:18:57] the buyer and before you knew it the boy
[1:18:59] that was in the buyer set up
[1:19:02] glory to god amen it's time for some of
[1:19:05] our loved ones to sit up
[1:19:07] glory they've been amen amen and
[1:19:10] and i mean they they experience
[1:19:12] spiritual death it's time for them to
[1:19:14] sit up
[1:19:15] but we need jesus to give them a touch
[1:19:18] hallelujah when this man when this man
[1:19:20] set up and began to talk and they took
[1:19:22] him back home to eat and glory to god i
[1:19:24] can imagine that mother
[1:19:27] looking at her son eating when she's
[1:19:29] supposed to be burying him but now she's
[1:19:31] looking at him eat at the table that
[1:19:34] mama say this man jesus
[1:19:37] he's wonderful
[1:19:39] he's wonderful
[1:19:41] i reminded of him going to
[1:19:44] a man his friend's house and
[1:19:46] intentionally he did not go at a
[1:19:48] particular time uh but they sent for him
[1:19:51] to say lazarus is ill lazarus is ill and
[1:19:54] he never went to pray for lazarus but he
[1:19:57] finally got word that lazarus was dead
[1:20:00] glory to god and when he got word that
[1:20:02] lazarus was dead amen he uh he told the
[1:20:06] disciples saying now uh our friend
[1:20:08] lazarus he sleepeth and we're gonna go
[1:20:11] wake him and some of the disciples say

[1:23:20] wife they had a 12 year old child and
[1:23:23] this this young lady uh was uh a
[1:23:27] sickened to death and they knew that
[1:23:29] that girl was going to a premature grief
[1:23:32] and uh so so the mother you know told
[1:23:34] the father look i know you're a priest
[1:23:36] and you're part of the you know the
[1:23:37] counsel and all this say but but the
[1:23:39] counselor can't help us
[1:23:41] but there's a man that we know can help
[1:23:43] us and he's living in the land his name
[1:23:45] is jesus
[1:23:46] so you need to find out where he is and
[1:23:48] go to him and bring him to this house
[1:23:51] and and the husband told him josh said
[1:23:53] all right i'm gonna get it done i'm
[1:23:55] gonna go find jesus and he left out that
[1:23:57] morning to go find jesus and he run into
[1:23:59] a city and there was jesus he come and
[1:24:02] got his attention saying lord i need you
[1:24:04] to come to my house i got a daughter
[1:24:06] that is sick and she's only a young
[1:24:08] young young child and you know and i
[1:24:10] just want you to pray for him maybe
[1:24:11] maybe god will hear your prayers she'll
[1:24:13] be here he says i'll come and i'll go
[1:24:14] with you and as jesus was on the way to
[1:24:17] jairus house glory to god the bible
[1:24:20] tells us of another woman a man that
[1:24:23] noticed the big crowd that was gathering
[1:24:25] and my mind just began to think on this
[1:24:27] woman how many times she might have gone
[1:24:29] to different services and got a prayer
[1:24:32] line and couldn't get into the prayer
[1:24:33] line how many times a man she she might
[1:24:36] have heard that he was in this city and
[1:24:38] just missed him she'd come the day after
[1:24:40] he left how many times has happened to
[1:24:42] her and she finally got after 12 years
[1:24:45] of amen of battling with this blood
[1:24:47] condition she heard once again that
[1:24:50] jesus was jesus was in town
[1:24:53] she said this time i'm not gonna miss
[1:24:55] him say i know i'm stuck here inside my
[1:24:58] house glory to god i'm not supposed to
[1:25:01] go out and touch nobody but and even the
[1:25:03] law said that he cannot come and touch
[1:25:05] me but the law did not say that i could
[1:25:08] not go and touch him
[1:25:11] so she had something in her heart she
[1:25:12] says i'm gonna go and just touch the hem
[1:25:15] of his car man she say i'm not gonna
[1:25:17] take no for an answer i know he's on the
[1:25:20] way to jail's house but i need him to do
[1:25:22] something wonderful
[1:25:24] for me praise god
[1:25:28] she said if i could just touch the hem
[1:25:30] of his garment
[1:25:32] i don't need him to say a word to me i
[1:25:34] don't need him to look me in the eye
[1:25:36] just let me touch the hem of his garment
[1:25:38] and i know i'll be made whole
[1:25:42] she reached out and touched him
[1:25:45] he stopped and stopped the process and
[1:25:47] said who touched me and they say now
[1:25:49] wait a minute now all these people
[1:25:50] touching you jesus said no no no
[1:25:51] somebody touched me a little different
[1:25:53] the way she just touched i mean i need
[1:25:55] to find out who it is and as he looked
[1:25:56] through the crowd he spotted the woman
[1:25:58] say woman what was it what was what was
[1:26:00] going on so you touched me and said your
[1:26:02] faith done made you whole so that's all
[1:26:04] i i knew that once i touched you that i
[1:26:06] was gonna this condition was gonna
[1:26:08] dry up right then
[1:26:10] that lady could look there and look at
[1:26:12] everybody and say look i'm gonna tell
[1:26:13] y'all something
[1:26:15] he's wonderful
[1:26:19] he's wonderful
[1:26:21] glory to god he's wonderful
[1:26:23] amen this you know there's so many
[1:26:25] things that we can look at in scripture
[1:26:28] and we can see why isaiah would get so
[1:26:30] inspired
[1:26:32] they call them wonderful
[1:26:34] counselor
[1:26:35] mighty god
[1:26:37] everlasting father prince of peace
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:41] i was just thinking on this you know
[1:26:42] when when we look at just that word
[1:26:44] counselor
[1:26:46] it's to advise
[1:26:48] amen consult
[1:26:51] give counsel it's to devise a plan or to
[1:26:54] plan it it's to have a purpose right uh
[1:26:57] oftentimes when when a person is giving
[1:26:59] counsel they got to have a purpose in
[1:27:01] what they're doing hallelujah
[1:27:03] uh uh if i'm giving counsel i'm trying
[1:27:05] to help the person get to the next level
[1:27:07] right the counselors not to try to bring
[1:27:10] people closer to you
[1:27:12] oh hallelujah
[1:27:14] hey
[1:27:15] hallelujah
[1:27:17] you know you know uh
[1:27:19] uh in the bible we had uh uh
[1:27:22] uh david's son
[1:27:24] uh
[1:27:26] absalom
[1:27:28] absalom would stand in the gates and he
[1:27:30] would tell the people i wish that y'all
[1:27:31] would come see me
[1:27:33] and not bother my daddy with all that
[1:27:36] it says i wish that y'all come to me
[1:27:37] absent had something amen an ulterior
[1:27:40] motive as to why he wanted the people to
[1:27:42] come see him
[1:27:43] absalom wanted to become the king
[1:27:46] hallelujah right so sometimes you got to
[1:27:48] watch people like that
[1:27:50] amen why are they not sending them to
[1:27:52] the to the pastor why they trying to
[1:27:54] take on that themselves
[1:27:56] everybody's not supposed to be giving
[1:27:58] counsel
[1:27:59] glory to god you got to know when to
[1:28:02] stop talking
[1:28:04] certain situations say no that need to
[1:28:06] go to the pastor you don't need to share
[1:28:08] no more with me take that straight to
[1:28:10] the pastor
[1:28:12] hallelujah amen god got an order of how
[1:28:15] he do things we got to watch the
[1:28:17] absaloms that'll rise up in the midst
[1:28:21] glory to god
[1:28:23] absalom wanted to give out counsel
[1:28:27] amen amen he had an evil spirit that was
[1:28:30] on them and you know i i thought about
[1:28:32] this and let me just go ahead and and
[1:28:34] give you this scripture
[1:28:36] counsel is something amen it's it's
[1:28:39] it's it has a purpose it has a plan amen
[1:28:42] behind it uh psalms 107 verse 11
[1:28:46] let's just read this scripture psalms
[1:28:48] 107 and verse 11
[1:28:50] amen
[1:28:51] glory as i looked at that word
[1:28:54] counseling just kind of looked at some
[1:28:56] other scriptures that that would be
[1:28:57] related to it
[1:28:58] amen i found this one i thought i would
[1:29:00] give it to you
[1:29:01] oh hallelujah hallelujah amen here in
[1:29:05] psalms 107 11 it says because they rebel
[1:29:09] amen against the words of god
[1:29:12] and contempt which means to spurn
[1:29:15] the council of the most high
[1:29:17] all right now when we when you look at a
[1:29:20] man the context of this this scripture
[1:29:23] is talking about the children of israel
[1:29:25] amen and and uh they were given divine
[1:29:28] instruction by god through a prophet
[1:29:31] they were supposed to leave egypt and go
[1:29:33] into the promised land amen but as they
[1:29:36] were on the way to the promised land
[1:29:38] glory to god they begin to complain
[1:29:41] they begin to murmur along the way glory
[1:29:44] to god and i'm going to tell you that
[1:29:46] still happens to people today amen
[1:29:48] they're on their way to a promise god is
[1:29:52] getting ready to manifest something in
[1:29:54] their life but it as they're on the way
[1:29:56] they begin to murmur they begin to
[1:29:59] complain glory to god amen they lose
[1:30:02] sight of the promise amen they take they
[1:30:05] they kind of put their eyes on the
[1:30:07] problems rather than keeping their eyes
[1:30:09] on the promise
[1:30:10] glory to god amen and so so when they
[1:30:13] started to to complain and murmur amen
[1:30:17] the bible tells us they begin to rebel
[1:30:19] against the words of god and they spurn
[1:30:22] the council of the most high and because
[1:30:24] they did this they ended up walking
[1:30:26] through the wilderness for 40 years
[1:30:29] sometimes you can delay your promise
[1:30:31] from coming to pass
[1:30:33] your your murmuring your complaining can
[1:30:37] delay your promise from coming to pass
[1:30:39] that's why brother branham say the right
[1:30:42] mental attitude towards any divine
[1:30:44] promise
[1:30:45] will bring it to pass
[1:30:47] hallelujah god gave them counsel god
[1:30:50] gave them a plan
[1:30:52] god gave them advice all they had to do
[1:30:53] was follow that
[1:30:55] here you know i want to pick up another
[1:30:58] amen scripture here in second kings
[1:31:01] chapter 6 verse 8 let's read this one
[1:31:03] this amen is dealing with counsel
[1:31:07] glory amen now i want to tell you that
[1:31:10] this our lord and savior was a was a
[1:31:13] counselor before he became flesh amen

[1:31:17] picking them up he was a counselor
[1:31:21] glory hallelujah amen let me uh get over
[1:31:25] in second kings

[1:31:51] with his servants

[1:32:08] amen uh uh uh as he's talking it over
[1:32:11] with his his servants this is counsel
[1:32:14] that he's receiving glory to god

[1:32:22] saying beware that thou pass not such a
[1:32:25] place for this of the syrians are come
[1:32:28] down now now i want you to notice
[1:32:29] something the man of god
[1:32:31] is receiving his instruction from a
[1:32:34] higher council
[1:32:36] glory to god somebody amen i mean he's
[1:32:39] receiving his instruction from the
[1:32:41] council love
[1:32:42] glory to god so so as as he's getting
[1:32:45] his counsel now he's giving that to the
[1:32:47] king of israel and all the kingdom of

[1:33:20] told him and warned him of and saved
[1:33:23] himself self there not once nor twice
[1:33:27] that means he kept listening to counsel
[1:33:29] from the prophet
[1:33:31] amen and every time he listened it
[1:33:33] spared his life
[1:33:35] hallelujah let me keep going amen says
[1:33:37] therefore the heart of the king of syria
[1:33:40] was so troubled for this thing and he
[1:33:43] called his servants and said unto them
[1:33:45] will you not show me which of us is for
[1:33:47] the king of israel and one of his
[1:33:50] servants said none my lord o king but
[1:33:53] elisha the prophet that is in israel

[1:34:33] realize if god was revealing to this man
[1:34:36] the secrets that was in his bed chamber
[1:34:38] then god would also reveal when this man
[1:34:40] was coming
[1:34:42] glory hallelujah this the prophet elijah

[1:35:04] his servants sent him alas my master how
[1:35:08] shall we do
[1:35:09] glory to god he says and he answered
[1:35:12] fear not
[1:35:13] for they glory hallelujah for they that
[1:35:17] be with us are more than they that be
[1:35:19] with them

[1:35:25] like now they that be with us out of
[1:35:27] these eyes i can see this great army but
[1:35:29] what are you looking at prophet that you
[1:35:31] can make a statement like that look at
[1:35:34] this look at this he said elijah prayed
[1:35:38] and said lord i pray thee open amen his
[1:35:41] eyes that he may see and the lord opened
[1:35:43] the eyes of the young man and he saw him
[1:35:45] behold the mountain was full of horses
[1:35:47] and chairs of fire round about elisha
[1:35:50] let's keep going he says and when they
[1:35:52] come down to him elisha prayed unto the
[1:35:56] lord and says might this people i pray
[1:35:58] thee with blindness and he smote them
[1:36:00] with blindness according to the word of
[1:36:02] elisha
[1:36:04] glory and elijah said unto them this is
[1:36:07] not the way neither is this the city
[1:36:09] follow me and i will bring you to the
[1:36:11] man whom you seek but but he led them to
[1:36:14] samaria let's keep going
[1:36:16] he says uh and it came to pass when they
[1:36:18] were come into samaria that elijah said
[1:36:21] lord open the eyes of these men that
[1:36:23] they may see and the lord opened their
[1:36:26] eyes and they saw him behold they were
[1:36:28] in the midst of samaria my and the king
[1:36:31] of israel said elisha when he saw them
[1:36:34] my father
[1:36:36] shall i smite them shall i smack them i
[1:36:38] like this because he's asking for
[1:36:40] counsel
[1:36:41] glory to god shall i smite them shall i
[1:36:43] spank them and he answered thou shall
[1:36:44] not smite them with us out smite those
[1:36:47] whom thou has taken captive with thy
[1:36:49] sword and with thy bow set bread and
[1:36:52] water before them that they may be that
[1:36:54] they may eat and drink and go to their
[1:36:55] master and he prepared great provision
[1:36:58] for them and where they had eaten and
[1:36:59] drunk and he sent them away and they
[1:37:02] went to their masses so the bands of
[1:37:04] syria came no more into the land of
[1:37:06] israel it was good that this man could
[1:37:08] follow the king himself
[1:37:10] could follow godly counsel
[1:37:13] elisha got his counsel from the council
[1:37:15] uh
[1:37:16] and he gave that amen to
[1:37:19] to the king and the king was able glory
[1:37:21] to god to follow the council and save
[1:37:23] not only himself but his entire army his
[1:37:25] whole city because he followed godly
[1:37:27] counsel this this this this this jesus
[1:37:31] that was given to us amen he's always
[1:37:34] been a counselor
[1:37:36] even when he came to earth
[1:37:39] there he was placed in in a situation
[1:37:42] where the pharisees thought they had him
[1:37:44] again
[1:37:45] they found this woman
[1:37:47] that they said we have taken her in the
[1:37:48] act of adultery we caught in the very
[1:37:50] act
[1:37:51] now they got to think about the words
[1:37:53] that they're using we caught her in the
[1:37:55] act of adultery
[1:37:57] she can't do this by herself
[1:37:59] but they come with her and say moses law
[1:38:02] tells us the stone of the death
[1:38:04] now you can you can you can see somebody
[1:38:06] tried to set this lady up
[1:38:08] maybe maybe she had something on
[1:38:10] somebody and maybe they wanted to try to
[1:38:12] kill according to the law amen a
[1:38:14] misrepresentation of the law glory to
[1:38:17] god they say he say say not say jesus
[1:38:19] the the law tells us that we suppose i
[1:38:21] mean moses says toner when we catch him
[1:38:23] like this what do you say
[1:38:26] he sat down and began to write in the
[1:38:27] sand hallelujah
[1:38:29] ignoring every accusation i want to tell
[1:38:32] you
[1:38:33] jesus has ignored every accusation
[1:38:35] that's been brought against you
[1:38:38] glory hallelujah every accusation he
[1:38:41] ignores it that's been brought against
[1:38:43] you
[1:38:45] they just began to write in the sand
[1:38:48] and he as he wrote in the sand he stood
[1:38:50] up and said now uh he that's without
[1:38:52] seeing
[1:38:53] let him cast the first stone what a
[1:38:55] counselor
[1:38:56] what a counselor and say the men had
[1:38:59] stones in their hands and and when they
[1:39:00] heard them speak those words one by one
[1:39:02] they began to drop their stones
[1:39:05] and they left us standing there by
[1:39:06] himself in the presence of the lord
[1:39:08] jesus and he speaks a word to say he
[1:39:10] said he said woman where are your
[1:39:12] accusers
[1:39:13] just say ain't got no lord he says well
[1:39:16] neither do i accuse you
[1:39:18] glory
[1:39:20] glory say go and sin no more now don't
[1:39:22] you get caught in this situation again
[1:39:24] because it might be a different response
[1:39:26] the next time but go and sin no more
[1:39:28] that woman could sit there say this man
[1:39:30] is a real
[1:39:32] counselor
[1:39:34] what a counselor
[1:39:36] what a counselor
[1:39:37] oh glory to god all right let's pick up
[1:39:41] something here

[1:42:18] he says and things laying around her and
[1:42:20] the mother and father screaming the

[1:43:33] you know um we we
[1:43:36] i want to amen uh bring amen maybe next
[1:43:40] week just a little bit talking about
[1:43:41] that peace there's been something that's
[1:43:43] been
[1:43:43] in my spirit we know peace is a person
[1:43:47] as none other than the person of the
[1:43:49] lord jesus christ he is he is called the
[1:43:51] prince of peace
[1:43:54] believe brother brother quaker mentioned
[1:43:55] in his prayer earlier how you know he
[1:43:57] stepped out there on that boat when he
[1:43:59] was sleeping and every devil in hell
[1:44:01] said we're going to kill him
[1:44:03] we're going to kill him today we got him
[1:44:05] on the boat in the middle of nowhere we
[1:44:06] got we got him and he's there sleeping
[1:44:08] and the devil's scheming while you
[1:44:10] sleeping
[1:44:12] you understand the devil scheming while
[1:44:13] you're sleeping and sometimes you wake
[1:44:16] up in the middle of a storm
[1:44:18] and all you were doing was that sleeping
[1:44:20] but you got to remember you still a son
[1:44:22] of god
[1:44:23] and you're still a daughter when you
[1:44:25] wake up you are son of god and the
[1:44:27] daughter of god and when jesus woke up
[1:44:30] shook the sleep off
[1:44:32] i can imagine he might have been snoring
[1:44:33] on the back of the boat
[1:44:35] and the disciples maybe somebody said
[1:44:37] don't wake him up he had to sleep like
[1:44:38] this a long time let him let him sleep
[1:44:39] now we about to die we got to get them
[1:44:41] up right now and i could see one of
[1:44:43] cypress go shake him say master carrots
[1:44:45] down not that we perish how is it that
[1:44:48] you can't even feel none of what what's
[1:44:50] going on out here we about to die and we
[1:44:53] only going on the other side because you
[1:44:55] told us to go
[1:44:58] jumped up out of his sleep and shook it
[1:45:00] off and went to the front of the boat
[1:45:02] and put his foot out there
[1:45:04] glory to god spoke words that the
[1:45:07] disciples never heard before they never
[1:45:09] seen nothing like this
[1:45:11] this man a man with his foot on the on
[1:45:14] the edge of a podium man praise god
[1:45:17] a man takes control of the situation
[1:45:22] speaks to the wind and waves peace
[1:45:25] be still
[1:45:27] glory you have that same authority
[1:45:30] dwelling inside of you that same power
[1:45:33] is dwelling inside you the prince of
[1:45:35] priests the prince of peace is not in a
[1:45:38] cradle the prince of peace is not in the
[1:45:41] pope but the prince of peace is living
[1:45:43] inside of you
[1:45:45] hallelujah
[1:45:49] glory to god
[1:45:52] i can see him speak to it and just turn
[1:45:54] around and go back to sleep
[1:45:56] where the disciples look to say what
[1:45:59] matter man is this
[1:46:01] even the winds and the seas open
[1:46:08] that's that's what we call the prince of
[1:46:09] peace
[1:46:14] but i love this
[1:46:17] amen a couple things that i want to
[1:46:19] bring
[1:46:25] isaiah
[1:46:28] uh gave him all these descriptions
[1:46:31] one of the scriptures there in isaiah 96
[1:46:33] says for unto us a child is born unto us
[1:46:34] a son is given
[1:46:36] the government shall be upon his
[1:46:37] shoulder his name shall be called
[1:46:38] wonderful counsel the mighty god the
[1:46:40] everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:46:42] and i mentioned earlier and i want to
[1:46:43] just bring it back again
[1:46:45] and i'm going to uh
[1:46:48] a quote out of the revelation of jesus
[1:46:50] christ
[1:46:52] how can a child
[1:46:54] be an everlasting father i'm going to
[1:46:56] tell you this is a really good scripture
[1:46:58] if you got a a a a loved one a friend
[1:47:01] that is
[1:47:02] really
[1:47:03] stuck on three gods father son the holy
[1:47:06] ghost just ask them the question
[1:47:09] how can this child
[1:47:11] a child because everybody goes to the
[1:47:13] scripture and talk about christmas this
[1:47:15] is one of the favorite scriptures that
[1:47:16] everybody go to how can this child be
[1:47:19] the everlasting father
[1:47:24] i mean have them explain it to you i
[1:47:25] mean you believe in father son holy
[1:47:27] ghost but how can this child
[1:47:30] be
[1:47:30] the everlasting father not not a sec a
[1:47:33] second person
[1:47:34] or a third person but no this child
[1:47:37] isaiah told us
[1:47:39] that this child was the everlasting
[1:47:41] father
[1:47:44] here in the messenger of revelation of
[1:47:46] jesus christ
[1:47:48] brother branham says the great i am
[1:47:51] the almighty god
[1:47:53] has come as spirit to fill his true
[1:47:56] church
[1:47:57] he has a right and i just love this
[1:48:00] statement he has a right to move
[1:48:02] anywhere he wants to
[1:48:05] so you know sometimes you get people
[1:48:07] that don't i don't want nothing to do
[1:48:08] with your god
[1:48:10] i don't want nothing to do with this now
[1:48:11] i want nothing to do i i i i i you know
[1:48:14] i i ain't got nothing to do with it i
[1:48:17] just need you to know that god
[1:48:19] has a right
[1:48:21] to move anywhere he wants
[1:48:24] if you're going to breathe his good air
[1:48:27] he got a right to move anytime and
[1:48:29] anywhere he wants to
[1:48:31] glory to god and look at what the
[1:48:33] prophet says he has a right to move
[1:48:34] anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he
[1:48:36] wants to
[1:48:40] someone's got testimonies we can say now
[1:48:41] i wasn't thinking about the lord
[1:48:43] i i ain't want nothing to do with the
[1:48:45] lord but all of a sudden i felt
[1:48:46] something just moving on me pulling me
[1:48:48] see god got a right
[1:48:51] amen to move anywhere he wants to upon
[1:48:53] anybody he wants to
[1:48:56] since we don't make any holy men among
[1:48:58] us but the whole congregation of the
[1:48:59] lord is holy because of the presence of
[1:49:00] the holy spirit
[1:49:03] it is he the holy spirit that is holy
[1:49:05] not the congregation of itself
[1:49:07] now that is the revelation jesus christ
[1:49:10] is god
[1:49:11] hallelujah this is why we can say he's
[1:49:14] the everlasting father prince of peace
[1:49:16] you know isaiah isaiah didn't have a bad
[1:49:19] doctrine it was spot on
[1:49:22] jehovah of the
[1:49:24] old testament
[1:49:26] is jesus of the new
[1:49:29] no matter how hard you try you can't
[1:49:31] prove there are three gods
[1:49:33] but it also takes a revelation by the
[1:49:35] holy spirit to make you understand that
[1:49:37] truth that he is one it takes a
[1:49:39] revelation to see that jehovah the old
[1:49:41] testament is
[1:49:43] the jesus of the new satan crept into
[1:49:46] the church
[1:49:47] and blinded the people to this truth
[1:49:50] and when they were blinded to it it
[1:49:52] wasn't long until the church of rome
[1:49:54] stopped baptizing the name of the lord
[1:49:56] jesus christ
[1:49:58] so as i admit
[1:50:00] um i admit it takes a real revelation
[1:50:03] from the holy ghost to see the truth
[1:50:04] about the godhead these days
[1:50:07] when we're in the midst of the
[1:50:09] perverting of so much scripture but the
[1:50:11] prevailing
[1:50:12] overcoming church
[1:50:15] is built on revelation so we can expect
[1:50:18] god to reveal his truth to us
[1:50:20] however you actually don't need a
[1:50:21] revelation on water baptism it is right
[1:50:24] there standing staring you in the face
[1:50:26] would it be possible for one minute for
[1:50:28] the apostles to be led astray from a
[1:50:29] direct command of the lord to baptize
[1:50:32] the name of the father and the son and
[1:50:34] the holy ghost and then find them and
[1:50:36] willful disobedience
[1:50:38] they knew what the name was and there is
[1:50:41] not one uh there is not one place in
[1:50:43] scripture where they baptized any other
[1:50:46] way then in the name of the lord jesus
[1:50:48] christ common sense would tell you that
[1:50:50] the book of acts is a church in action
[1:50:52] and if they baptize that way then that
[1:50:55] is the way to baptize now if you think
[1:50:57] that is strong what do you think it is
[1:50:59] anyone who was not baptized in the name
[1:51:02] lord jesus had to be baptized over again
[1:51:06] here brother branham's clearly just
[1:51:08] telling us you know this this one that's
[1:51:10] called everlasting father
[1:51:12] this was god in the flesh
[1:51:15] amen the word became flesh unto us this
[1:51:18] son
[1:51:19] was given god was becoming flesh amen in
[1:51:23] in this child it was not god just
[1:51:25] sending a son but it was god becoming
[1:51:28] the son so he could die for our sins the
[1:51:31] other thing that isaiah says and i'll
[1:51:34] bring this in and i want to bring this
[1:51:35] to a close
[1:51:37] my god
[1:51:39] it says that uh
[1:51:41] for unto us a child is born unto us the
[1:51:43] son is given
[1:51:44] it says in the government
[1:51:47] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:51:50] oh glory to god glory to god let me just
[1:51:53] read
[1:51:54] one little quote and then i'll
[1:51:56] save us a little time and i'll give a
[1:51:58] little description this is going to come
[1:51:59] out of questions and answers the
[1:52:00] government
[1:52:02] government going to be upon his shoulder
[1:52:05] the government
[1:52:08] this this child
[1:52:11] can you imagine that
[1:52:13] and and you know i didn't i didn't see
[1:52:15] it until now i'm just
[1:52:17] i'm gonna look at we can look at this we
[1:52:19] had a a king in the bible by the name of
[1:52:22] josiah
[1:52:24] he was only eight years old
[1:52:27] eight years old and he he becomes the
[1:52:29] king amen of the entire nation of israel
[1:52:33] uh do we realize that eight-year-old boy
[1:52:36] had the government
[1:52:39] upon his shoulder
[1:52:41] the decisions that he made amen whatever
[1:52:44] he said was the law glory to god but i'm
[1:52:47] gonna tell you even in and with a child
[1:52:50] that young it's hard for him to
[1:52:51] understand what he needed but what he
[1:52:53] did have was some
[1:52:56] counselors he had good godly counselors
[1:53:00] around him that helped him to make the
[1:53:01] right decision
[1:53:03] glory to god
[1:53:06] let's look at this questions and answers
[1:53:08] part one brother branham says this
[1:53:11] jesus said down there when he was
[1:53:13] casting out devils
[1:53:15] not getting off this question now not
[1:53:17] not now just for a moment but jesus said
[1:53:20] when he was casting out devils he said
[1:53:22] who do your sons cast them out by
[1:53:25] if i with the thing of god cast out
[1:53:28] devils who does your sons cast them up
[1:53:30] by
[1:53:31] if you got a better policy show us
[1:53:34] see if i with the thing of god a man
[1:53:36] just think the thing of god their god
[1:53:39] above christ
[1:53:40] christ above the church there's god the
[1:53:43] father says certain certain thing then
[1:53:45] god the son moves his hand and the
[1:53:48] shadow follows it if i with the thing of
[1:53:50] god cast out devils who does your sons
[1:53:53] cast them out by
[1:53:55] amen look i want you to notice oh no
[1:53:57] matter how great a disease or how much
[1:54:00] affliction the devil could put on you
[1:54:02] jesus takes his finger to move it
[1:54:07] i love that amen no matter what the
[1:54:09] devil put on you jesus can take his
[1:54:11] finger and move it right on off
[1:54:13] glory to god just a finger
[1:54:16] my hallelujah amen oh my look at them
[1:54:19] big strong shoulders and arms and
[1:54:21] muscles just his finger moves every
[1:54:24] disease and cast out devils
[1:54:27] what a little thing the devil is
[1:54:30] i want to say that again what a little
[1:54:32] thing
[1:54:33] the devil is
[1:54:35] because jesus can move him with a finger
[1:54:41] he just takes his finger and moves him
[1:54:43] away then if i with the thing of god
[1:54:46] now let me show you
[1:54:47] some love some love of god but when a
[1:54:50] sheep was lost
[1:54:52] he didn't use his finger
[1:54:57] he laid him upon his shoulders
[1:55:00] and he took his whole being
[1:55:02] hands sheep around his shoulder the
[1:55:06] strongest most powerful part of a man is
[1:55:09] across
[1:55:10] shoulders and back
[1:55:12] you know that for all of his arms and
[1:55:15] muscles and muscles move out and he and
[1:55:18] he's taking the whole sheep put him upon
[1:55:21] his shoulder and here he comes not with
[1:55:23] his finger to cast out a little devil
[1:55:26] but here he comes with this all of his
[1:55:28] muscles of his leg all the muscles of
[1:55:30] his arm moving through the wilderness
[1:55:32] packing a lost sheep on his shoulder oh
[1:55:35] my
[1:55:36] if i with the thing of god cast out
[1:55:38] devils who does your son cast him out by
[1:55:41] oh hallelujah my brother bran i'm saying
[1:55:43] the devil is so little
[1:55:45] that jesus can just cast him out with a
[1:55:47] finger
[1:55:48] but when it comes to dealing with his
[1:55:50] children
[1:55:51] his sheep he puts those sheep
[1:55:54] on his shoulder the government
[1:55:58] shall be upon his
[1:56:00] shoulder
[1:56:04] and and here's what you need to
[1:56:05] understand about that
[1:56:07] as brother branham takes it a little
[1:56:08] further
[1:56:09] and he tells us a man
[1:56:12] that in the eastern civilization
[1:56:15] they would uh
[1:56:17] uh they have their weddings and
[1:56:19] and everything and and i remember you
[1:56:22] know when i was there in
[1:56:23] in uh in israel we went to visit and
[1:56:25] just so happened the hotel we were
[1:56:27] standing they were doing a wedding
[1:56:29] and you know they had everything all set
[1:56:31] up and and i would i you know i was not
[1:56:34] an invited guest
[1:56:36] so i had to become a spy
[1:56:40] hide behind a tree just to try to look
[1:56:42] at this wedding
[1:56:43] what in the world what they getting
[1:56:44] ready to do cause this is a little
[1:56:45] different and i see the the the the
[1:56:48] bride all dressed up and you can tell
[1:56:49] with the veil and everything this is
[1:56:50] brown she's sitting over there in the
[1:56:52] corner kind of in a garden and uh and
[1:56:54] all of her tenants are around her and
[1:56:57] and everything and and i see the groom
[1:56:59] you know to be he comes and uh comes
[1:57:02] into the garden and walks to where the
[1:57:04] bride is
[1:57:05] amen and everybody kind of steps out of
[1:57:07] the way he walks up and he lifts the
[1:57:09] veil and he looks at her and says yes
[1:57:12] this is her they put the veil back down
[1:57:14] he goes to the altar and he waits for
[1:57:16] her to come
[1:57:18] now there's a reason why that man had to
[1:57:20] look look up
[1:57:21] look look at look underneath that veil
[1:57:23] before he went to the altar because in
[1:57:25] his history
[1:57:27] amen one somebody got tricked one time
[1:57:32] thought he was marrying amen rachel got
[1:57:34] leah
[1:57:36] right so you better look underneath that
[1:57:38] veil and make sure that's the one
[1:57:40] yes this is the one and it goes down
[1:57:42] there to the alternate stand and he just
[1:57:44] rocking
[1:57:45] i just see him just rocking
[1:57:47] good god almighty like what is he doing
[1:57:49] and he's just waiting for her to come
[1:57:51] and finally she comes with her entourage
[1:57:53] on down to the altar and they perform
[1:57:55] the ceremony and brother branham saying
[1:57:57] those eastern cultures
[1:58:00] hallelujah it's a government being upon
[1:58:03] his shoulder
[1:58:05] in those eastern cultures what would
[1:58:06] happen is and this is why it's important
[1:58:09] we don't you know we don't
[1:58:12] sometimes we allow too much um
[1:58:15] of this new
[1:58:17] stuff get into
[1:58:19] wedding celebrations and we miss what
[1:58:21] it's really all about
[1:58:22] right i mean i i'll just be honest i'm
[1:58:25] one that i i believe in seeing wedding
[1:58:28] vows
[1:58:29] amen you can make up your own vows if
[1:58:32] you want to but we're going to do that
[1:58:34] plus
[1:58:35] these wedding vows
[1:58:37] right because sometimes they miss things
[1:58:39] in the wedding vows it sounds real cute
[1:58:43] right but you're missing some of the
[1:58:44] main points
[1:58:47] hallelujah
[1:58:48] on and obey and and and and and you know
[1:58:51] and sickness and in hell
[1:58:53] right and rich or poor
[1:58:55] you you when you make that vow before
[1:58:57] before god and before this congregation
[1:58:59] people are holding you to it the reason
[1:59:02] you are invited to the wedding
[1:59:04] is so that you can hold the couple that
[1:59:06] is getting married you can hold them
[1:59:08] accountable i was at your wedding i
[1:59:12] heard you make the vow
[1:59:15] what you talking about you quitting and
[1:59:16] giving up and divorcing no i was at your
[1:59:19] wedding i heard you make the vow
[1:59:23] come on somebody
[1:59:25] that's why you there you're not there
[1:59:26] just to get no cake or nothing
[1:59:29] a free plate
[1:59:30] no you there to hold that couple
[1:59:32] accountable
[1:59:36] but here you know
[1:59:38] you know the the young man that's
[1:59:40] getting married this groom needs to
[1:59:41] understand the responsibility
[1:59:45] and you know i was listening to
[1:59:47] a preacher a guy my old boss sent me
[1:59:50] something to say this preacher
[1:59:52] uh was going on he had this couple up in
[1:59:54] the church and i guess he was getting
[1:59:56] ready to get married he had the the the
[1:59:58] the the groom here and the bride here
[2:00:00] and the bride father and the mother
[2:00:02] and he told that he told grooming saying
[2:00:04] now now i say my god that ain't number
[2:00:07] the truth he say
[2:00:08] he said say the father can tell you
[2:00:10] uh my name got her through college
[2:00:15] my name got her her first car
[2:00:18] my name did this and my name did that
[2:00:21] when she was under my name she i mean
[2:00:22] these are all the things that she
[2:00:24] accomplished under my name
[2:00:28] that's what she got under my name but
[2:00:29] when when but when when we give it to
[2:00:32] you glory to god at the altar
[2:00:35] there's a way the responsibility is
[2:00:37] about to shift the government is now
[2:00:41] to be on your shoulders and you got to
[2:00:43] understand if my name did that then i'm
[2:00:45] expecting your name
[2:00:47] to carry her a little bit further
[2:00:50] take it further than what my name took
[2:00:52] her don't take her down but take her up
[2:00:57] because the government is now on your
[2:00:59] shoulders it's not my responsibility
[2:01:02] anymore
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:06] when i had it i did what i was supposed
[2:01:08] to do with my name
[2:01:10] but not a government
[2:01:13] it's on your shoulders
[2:01:15] and brother branham saying say what
[2:01:17] happens is that that that bride
[2:01:19] she takes a veil
[2:01:21] she moves it
[2:01:23] you know from one show to the other
[2:01:24] shoulder on the groom it shows that
[2:01:26] there was a transfer of headship
[2:01:29] from the father to now this this young
[2:01:31] man
[2:01:33] the government is now
[2:01:34] on his shoulders
[2:01:37] say i wanna i need you to understand
[2:01:38] that that we are that that that young
[2:01:41] lady becomes that young man's
[2:01:44] responsibility we got it mixed up here
[2:01:47] some kind of way the the we feel like
[2:01:48] the the the young man get married and
[2:01:52] and and he becomes a young lady's
[2:01:53] responsibility
[2:01:56] but no no that young lady becomes
[2:01:59] the young man's
[2:02:01] responsibility
[2:02:03] hallelujah
[2:02:05] amen
[2:02:07] a brother should never feel satisfied
[2:02:10] being mr mom
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:16] never
[2:02:17] god never intended for it to be that way
[2:02:20] amen
[2:02:22] is the truth any high
[2:02:24] glory to god but a man should never feel
[2:02:27] comfortable
[2:02:28] doing that
[2:02:29] glory to god you got to change something
[2:02:31] in your life but you're supposed to take
[2:02:33] care of your family she becomes your
[2:02:35] responsibility
[2:02:38] amen church
[2:02:40] glory to god glory to god
[2:02:43] amen hallelujah
[2:02:45] but but this is what this is what this
[2:02:47] when it says that uh here in isaiah
[2:02:50] the government should be upon his
[2:02:51] shoulder
[2:02:54] i i got this here if uh you can pull up
[2:02:56] that philadelphia church age quote
[2:02:59] um
[2:03:03] i'll
[2:03:04] i'll leave it i won't i won't worry
[2:03:06] brother branham just makes the statement
[2:03:08] it says
[2:03:09] when the bride is committed to the groom
[2:03:10] she takes off her veil and places it
[2:03:12] over the groom's shoulder signifying
[2:03:14] that not only is she under his dominion
[2:03:17] that she has transferred her rights to
[2:03:19] him
[2:03:21] she's under his dominion and she has
[2:03:22] transferred her rights to him
[2:03:24] that he is the head
[2:03:26] but also that he bears the
[2:03:27] responsibility and care
[2:03:30] that he and he alone no one else no
[2:03:32] other man no other power has any right
[2:03:35] and responsibility
[2:03:37] oh my
[2:03:40] i just love that i love that and and
[2:03:43] like i said don't get this mixed up
[2:03:45] nowadays amen and relationships don't
[2:03:48] get this mixed up we don't we don't we
[2:03:50] don't uh sometimes society just kind of
[2:03:52] push things that it's okay for the man
[2:03:54] to be like this okay for the i mean yeah
[2:03:57] he should be involved
[2:03:58] he should be involved but he can never
[2:04:00] be a mama
[2:04:03] he can never be a mama and don't try to
[2:04:05] make him a mama
[2:04:07] he wasn't built to be a mama
[2:04:10] but don't try to make them don't let
[2:04:12] society do that and sisters y'all not
[2:04:14] built to be daddy
[2:04:17] god didn't make you to be daddy
[2:04:21] i mean just because you work and pay
[2:04:22] bills and so that don't make you daddy
[2:04:25] right i mean you know sometimes it's
[2:04:27] because we live way above our means
[2:04:29] that's why we have to do some of these
[2:04:31] things
[2:04:32] amen glory to god glory to god but but
[2:04:35] the government is on the shoulders of
[2:04:37] that groom
[2:04:40] that bridegroom when he comes he has it
[2:04:42] when when that when that that that veil
[2:04:44] is transferred the government
[2:04:47] is now on his shoulders he needs to feel
[2:04:49] that responsibility
