Oh heavily father trust is in you this morning right at your mercy and grace upon our lives protected us through the week wanting to be fair lord come here father I know that to be on your word or read all your living word Allah Jesus bites helped us to reset the fresh manna from heaven this morning any nee that is upon this place let it be met before God any healing that needs to be done father may you do it Oh God any deliverance or God I ask that you provided father I was this morning Lord and we would enter into your presence knowing that we would know that father your spirit was in this place with those who fill every heart oh God radio presents with us with Jesus help us this morning our that we wouldn't mind in one Accord in one spirit in one mind lord meet our needs is smart and hide every one of us behind your clothes we don t come here to be safe I didn't come here to see each other Lord but we came here to see you Father oh geez Thank You lawyer [Music] it is a grand privilege for me to be this this morning with you all I believe there's no better place to be and there's no better way to be in any place but in the name of the Jesus Christ it's always a privilege to be before the Bride of Christ and brother Jackie he as he mentioned to you guys earlier he kind of called out to me and and mentioned that this is what he had in his heart and you know God always works on both ends because God had already placed something in my heart and I you know God he when he moves you have to be sensitive to his move and I didn't know when he would have me to speak but there was a time that was the hardest it was this time because I had other things going on and and but I had to be obedient and that's exactly what I said to brother Jack so I'm trusting this morning that God would meet every hearts needs and he would speak to every heart so to not take any time we're gonna turn in to the book of Ephesians the Fijians first chapter we're going to start at a third verse for it reads blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved and whom we have redemption through the blood of the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he has abounded toward us all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will a man you may be seated may God as a blessing to his reading as a subject this morning I want to focus on holy and without blame before him and love and as a title I want to use positionally placed in Christ you see I want to start by saying something the Prophet said and the message of the position of a believer in Christ the Prophet says how many Christians are here raise up your hands and I just want to actually guys the same question all the believers raise up your hands he says everywhere that's wonderful he said I suppose that's wonderful 100 percent Lux says now if you're a believer he said I believe I know the greatest curse that's on the church today it's not knowing what they are at church this morning I want to say that I'm not speaking to the world but I'm speaking to believers you see this is what I call Eagles food because the church world this is a little too hard for them to chew on further down 24th paragraph it says says now the Epistle the letter to the Ephesians was written to believers not the outside world but to believers it says now try hard Christians to understand that this day the message has been placing the believer and positionally place and book of Ephesians to focus and says you have been according that he hath chosen us in him before before what you were not only chosen of him but you were chosen in him and you were chosen in him before hope to be holy but without blame before him in love many are called Church but few are chosen and and you are the chosen this morning now he that chose you chose you in him one were you chosen you were chosen before the foundation of this world before the world was even created you were in existence and the reason I can say you had to be in existence Church is because there had to be a manifestation there had to be a manifestation of sons and daughters of God right there had to be a manifestation of deliverance there had to be a manifestation of healing there had to be a manifestation of victory there had to be a manifestation of deliverance you see leather coat I wish to share with you and the Prophet said this is in wisdom versus faith the Prophet says and then if you are a born again child of God you are and got the Holy Spirit in you you are the manifestation of God's spoken word before it was a word now I want you to catch that church you are the manifestation of God spoken word before it was word and what and uh Matthew in Matthew 24 chapter verse 35 it says it's important that we know and recognize who we are it says heaven and earth shall pass I'm just gonna turn here real quick heaven and earth shall pass but my words shall not pass and and if I could tell you church have been in earth shall pass but the manifestation of God's words shall not pass because you are the manifestation of God before he even was worried you see prophet goes on to say it had to be a thought before it could be a word a word is a spoken thought and the thoughts was in God and then we were in God in eternity and we were spoken into existence by the word so see before you came to existence you were already manifested before there was a creation you were already manifested you were manifested in the mind of God as sons and daughters of God now I believe that we're living in a world today that lacks holiness we're living in a world that lacks godliness righteousness and if there's any holiness today it's because it's a bride still on the earth if that righteousness today is because there's a bride still on the earth now this world has gone through so many changes and that's just what it keeps stalling looking towards a constant change right now I don't say they call it change but they say they call it an upgrade there's always an upgrade to something right and this happens every so often I remember one day when they came out with the first iPhone I want to say it was some 10 to 12 years ago and we're already on iPhone 11 that that's to show you that every year there's an upgrade right so that means the world can never find a contentment the world is always looking for something new now I say that church because thanks me to God that even before the world began there was born sons and daughters of God that was already in an upgraded form right now you see the pinnacle upon all upgrades is right here I'm looking at the upgrade right here right now is that right church for we should be holy and without blame before him and love now where else can we ever get this upgrade in Christ nowhere but in Christ you see when you're in him your renewed daily your faith is renewed daily your virtue is renewed daily your temperance is renewed daily your knowledge is renewed daily your your brotherly kindness is renewed daily your patience is renewed daily you see your love is renewed daily and I can keep going on now just start to your neighbor and says I'm renewed daily now there's no upgrades for believers right that is spiritually speaking because you die daily so you can live today right if you are manifested before creation what is there to upgrade to Paul says you must die daily and there's a quote I came across earlier this week and as brother Troy likes to say it I just had to have to stay on on this side of the bone a little bit you know this isn't a message desperations and I had a chance to send it out to a few believers and says desperations sign of his coming should throw every member of Christ and to desperation now about our souls about our welfare hereafter and I could just add to that our treasures are not here on earth but in heaven see we're not building an earthly tabernacle but a heavenly tabernacle one that will not be dissolved profit goes on to say what are we going to amount to we've regained the whole world what are we what are we living for what do we work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for it to live what are you living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die now I just want that a sinking church you are not fit to live until you are first fit to die and church it's going to take a dying condition for the church to be raptured out of here you see being completely dead in this corrupted and mortal body and first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 53 it says for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that it is written death is swallowed up in victory now that just makes me rejoice when I came across this you see death is swallowed up in victory you see that that makes me rejoice Church because we go through so much daily but only to be tested and to be proven right now whatever defeat is among us this morning let it be swallowed up in victory any sickness here this morning let it be swallowed up in healing any defeat any afflictions any any diseases let it be swallowed up in Christ verse 7 and whom we have verse 7 in Ephesians first chapter and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace see Church you're swallowed up in victory because he's paid a price he's paid a price that's without blame or blemish quote here Mesa's the position of a believer prophet says the whole room here is full of the power of God even enough to make this boy sitting here in a wheelchair walk make this woman walk make this lady in the stretcher of walk make all these people along here walk make the blind seat but the first thing you have to do is get that Holy Spirit flowing in the right category and you see I realized that the power of God is always circulating the believer but God is always moving but you must be sensitive enough to recognize his power sensitive enough to recognize his move you see brother Branham shared with us going beyond the sound barrier and whatever you in need of church there's always a barrier the sound barrier is between your faith and your unbelief you see in order to get what you're in what your need for in God you have to put down the barriers you have to recognize that the Holy Spirit is flowing and once you can get the Holy Spirit flowing in the right category right you get in Christ you just let it flow but you have to get into Christ you have to get in Christ and Christ has to be on the inside you'll never truly recognize God's power without Christ being on the inside how do you get in Christ prophet goes on to say now there's so many different ways they claim to Christ Jesus they said you join the church some save you believe and some does one thing or another some take it by baptism some take it by fellowship but first Corinthians twelve says by one spirit or we are all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ the body of believers you see it by what not by shaking hands not by one mode of baptism not by one feeling but by one spirit now one spirit all baptized to one body so I want to say you have to apply your spiritual token and your spiritual token is Christ once you have applied your spiritual token then you're fit for the journey now prophet goes on to say the token what's the token Church the token is Christ Christ is the fullness of this word and the bride is the fullness of Christ you see all that was in Christ Christ ported into the church because all that was in God God pouring into Christ and they're supposed to be changes when you apply the token me they're supposed to be changes when you accept Christ in your life now we're not talking about an emotional change we're not talking about a mental change but we're talking about a nature change our nature change that bears witness of the nature of the holy spirit now your nature has to become a witness and in a manifestation of the nature of the holy spirit you see when you come to the place when you really recognize who you are your nature of nature change there is no longer a strange thing to you right when things begin to when your desires begin to change when the things you used to do don't don't no longer interest you anymore that's not a strange thing to you right a matter of fact the Prophet says in the message you're not you're not even supposed to notice it right it just falls away right it's supposed to leave you because light and darkness cannot dwell in the same place light and darkness cannot do it in the same atmosphere now when we know who we were then we'll know who we are the Prophet says what were you and what are you very there is how you know what was you before the token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after you see that's supposed to produce change they're supposed to produce a life that identifies with Christ he says then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things just automatically go with that it isn't like talking about it saying tongues is the evidence now I'll bet I'll buy a pair of shoes the tongue is at the shoe it just crumbs with the shell you see it just comes with the shooter right your your your your blessing just cards with the Holy Spirit right when you receive the Holy Spirit you're supposed to be blessed you're supposed to be in victory you're supposed to be healed now you receive these things by faith because without faith it is impossible to please God now there's a difference between hope and faith faith is being sure of what you're hoping for now prophet says faith does the job right now not later not tomorrow not next week but right now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you faith is the product now we have lots of hope the Prophet says but not much faith so we want to change from hope today to positive faith and there's only one way we can get a positive faith that's by positive thinking of positive things when we can put on the form of God our faith renews now we don't live by some experience we had some time ago but our experience also is supposed to renew because when we apply to faith that is supposed to believe the Prophet says the faith that was once delivered the Saints that faith is the same faith we need today it's a dying faith a faith that sees only by Christ now prophet says according that he had chosen him and us or him choosing us in him who done the choosing God did you didn't I didn't God did you haven't chose me but I have chose you and church you didn't come here on your own but you are here this morning because God chose you God did just call you but God chose you because those he chose he justified those he justified he sanctified now [Music] he says that uh he chose you on Christ before the foundation of the world was ever laid then if God knew that what are you scared about he said if God loo you way back before the foundation of the world to choose you in Christ what are you afraid about he says that's without blame without blemish now one spot on the church at all and this is where I want to focus on that we are wholly chosen to be holy and without blame before him in love he says now how are we ever going to get that way how are we ever going to get holy without blaming Christ he says we can't do it you're human and you're subject to all kinds of mistakes so that's one of the things the devil likes to come with us at when we make a mistake he makes us feel like we have lost our sonship well we have lost our identity but you see by revelation I believe in Romans 8 19th verse it says for the creature grown it after the manifestations of the Son of God and I'm gonna still brother Jack what he said once when time is is the matter the creature growing it for the revelation of the sons and daughters of God you see when you have a revelation of who you are it doesn't matter what mistake you've made but it's underneath the redemptive blood of Jesus Christ right you are presented with Christ holy and without blame let us turn to Hebrews the tenth chapter Hebrews chapter 10 referred to first verse it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect prophet says here just to contrast this quote it says the subject is perfection now how can mortal men ever become perfected and yet God said in his word that he chose us to be holy and perfected before the foundation of the world how are you going to do that jesus says be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now I've got before the world ordained that we should be perfect without blame in the sight of God we are struggling murmuring prophet says and don't think God seeing all these God did not see all these things and he foreknew it and predestinated it ordained us to be so elected us before the world was ever formed now here's how he did it and Hebrews chapter 9 a 24th verse Hebrews chapter 9 24 praise the Lord praise the Lord the 24th verse it reads for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us and I'm gonna say make it personal he entered into the presence of God for you for me right now it goes on to say now yet that should that he should offer himself often as the high priest and turth and to the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world have he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and it was appointed unto me unto man once to die but after this the judgment so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation you see only once that he have to die and only once that he have to appear before God and once we accept him our mistakes all that we are our lives our past is subject to his perfection the reason we could be perfect and holy is because he is perfect and holy now the Prophet says paragraph 47 and position of a believer in Christ under the law under the shadow they entered in under the shedding of the blood of goats and bulls which we went through which could not take away sins it was the life of an animal how could the life of this hunk of the life and spirit of a dead animal coming out of the blood the cell of life breaking forth the blood that was shed I've ever ever that life returning back into an animal or to a man the life of a lamb or heifer or a goat or an animal that's been sacrificed after the blood has been broken for our sins that's why it never returns back and having anything to do with a human being it cannot but God before the foundation of the world for ordained that Jesus would come to perfect the perfect Lamb of God and to a perfect cell that God Himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that the blood that housed his life and through the tearing down of this house a blood that has the spirit that was in that blood cell which was not none other than the Holy Ghost himself after that offering of that man can come back and perfect and perfect the believer he brought eternal Redemption so you see in the Old Testament when they would go before the priest and bring forth their sacrifice they looked at their sacrifice they never looked at them as an individual but it was a sacrifice that was magnified and today we don't lean we don't depend on the the blood of goats but the blood of Christ right because as brother Branham says the life of the animal could not end sir cannot come back the spirit of the animal that is cannot come back to that to that believer to that person that offered the sacrifice but now the Christ being the sacrifice himself the spirit that was in him that resurrected him has returned to the believer let us turn to Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 says [Music] praise the Lord I'm just looking for the verse I didn't have it written down praise the Lord praise the Lord verse 11 it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his sins by his Spirit that dwelleth in you so that spirit now can come back to the believer to quicken your mortal bodies so that you can live a life of purity live a life of holiness live a life of godliness profit goes on to say the Holy Spirit who - believer through the blood cleansing of the soul into the fellowship into the spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world in very nature of God is in you still subject to mistakes but God can't see it because it's covered by the blood you see you still subject to mistakes but God cannot see because you are covered by the blood I want you to catch that church because when you recognize that the devil will flee in the midst of your trials the devil will flee you give him not that not just the word but the revelation of the word right the reason why Christ was able to defeat Satan is because he had a revelation of the word you see say who's just doing good study this morning saying went to him tempted him say it is written but Christ said it is also read you see now it was a matter of who had the greater revelation whether the workers you know the word is written all right we can have this discussion back and forth but what is your revelation of the word you see it is also written that's what he said and when we can understand our place our position in Christ we can say it is also really right though I am subject to mistakes but I am underneath the blood of Christ praise the Lord praise the Lord now the Prophet goes are on the same but how the greater he said I hope you get it he said that God Himself come down in the form of a lamb he says watch now look you don't have to look at the land don't look at yourself God don't look at you he looks at the land he looks at Christ and there was no fault in him and God accepted the offering you put your hand upon the lamb Christ Jesus confess your sins and as being a sinner and the lamb has died for you the spirit that comes out of the lamb comes back to the believer amen and you stand perfected because the one who died the innocent one the powerful one the overcoming one the accepted one and his own person returning the form of the Holy Ghost and brings the believer to rest it brings the believer to rest church we are swallowed up in victory we are swallowed up in Christ all that is in Christ is in us now see Romans eight the first verse says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and when you walk after the spirit you're produced of fruits of the spirit love is supposed to follow you in joy is supposed to follow you victory is supposed to follow Church I'm encouraged and I want you all to be encouraged that this is who we are positionally placed in Christ not now but to Eternity because we come from eternity and we are going back to eternity god bless your church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you lord dear Heavenly Father the Lord how we give thanks unto you Lord for the
