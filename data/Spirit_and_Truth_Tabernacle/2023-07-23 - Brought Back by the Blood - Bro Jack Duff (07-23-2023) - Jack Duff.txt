forth amen amen [Applause] God bless you all I'm so nervous I'm sorry um I don't even know where to begin but God has done so many things in my life um but this one it was it's big um five years ago I I was working at a preschool and uh one of the there was I was a two-year-old teacher and I was with another young lady it was 22 two-year-olds in the two of us in the classroom and the classroom was very very uh intense it was it was crazy because we had kids that was autistic we had kids that just was we didn't know how to deal with but it was just the two of us so uh we we instead of getting frustrated at because we had the directors coming to us and telling us that we need to get the classroom under control but we couldn't put the customer under control because she was one of the young ladies that was very um oh they can't learn two-year-olds don't learn and I was born like okay I'm a mother so two-year-olds can't learn so it was just we just kept bumping heads to a point where it was so bad uh it let led me be going to the hospital multiple times with panic attacks and everything because I did not know how to you know get through to her to help like to help her because I was her assistant and um issues to it needless to say it's a long testimony but let me break it short I let we we both left off one day was we just had enough we I walked out of the classroom and said I couldn't work with her anymore so I went to the director to let them know but but prior to that we had so many meetings with the director because it was so bad the classroom was chaotic and she when I walked out of the classroom she went I was talking to them I was I was sitting up front and now I seen her walk from the side from my side the corner of my eyes I seen her she grabbed her son and her son was one years old at the time grabbed her son and she walked out of the building so we both I went to go tell them that I quit and she walked out and quit that same day so both of us end up actually quitting so the lady was like well Jimmy but she walked out you can't quit and I was like okay so this was five years ago but that situation was so bad to where I didn't even know if we could even speak if I would see her again how would it be well two years before that two years ago I ran into her at Walmart and it was another co-worker of Minds that we work we all three work together exactly what I thought how she would handle she walked past me said Hey to the young lady that was standing there I was talking to and walked past me and I said hey Chantel she didn't even respond she just kept walking and I was like Wow exactly so I was like praying I'm like Lord I know I was supposed to be the Christian in this situation and I did not handle this very well it was so bad that I was kept having panic attacks did not know how to handle the situation and um I didn't even know if I would see her again I was so scared if I would see her again how would she handle it again so um Wednesday what it was Wednesday but mind you keep in mind that I've been praying because I said I had to make this right I cannot let it's been a burden on my heart for five years that I had to make it right with this young lady I don't know how but I had to and um Wednesday I believe this week I um God been waking me up this whole week at four o'clock in the morning I don't know why but I just been every time you wake me up I just get up and pray but my alarm don't go off until six o'clock in the morning to get ready for the day and um I was after I finished praying I was reading my Bible and after I was done I went out I didn't never have Facebook app on my phone but I prior to that I downloaded and I was going through Facebook and I ran across to her page and my hand accidentally requested her as a friend and I was like oh man I can't no so I hurry up and cancel the friend request and I'm like man Lord I hope she did not see that because I don't even know how to explain that part maybe I didn't want to feel like I was stalking the girl but it just happened to you know how Facebook will always Show you people that you know so I hurry up and cancel it well that was Wednesday no that was Thursday morning I believe it was Thursday or Friday but that afternoon God has been showing me like a lot of things that he's been doing on my job that and just on my way home after talking to my husband I was just praying and just like have my music on blast and just worshiping all the way up until I got home into the parking lot of my house so I got there and then I um seen that I had a couple of messages when one of the messages was from her she messaged me and she was like why did you unsend your friend request and I was like well um oh my goodness it was an accident I didn't I I've been wanting to apologize to you for five years I did not know how to apologize and I just wanted to ask for your forgiveness because in that situation I was not a Christian in that situation it was just so much going on that I don't even know what happened so she messaged back to me and was saying oh my God Jamila you've been on my heart for five years as well and I wanted to forgive you and I was asking you for forgiveness as well because um I was in my she was saying going to say that she was immature she was unhappy she had a lot of things going on in her life at that time that I did not know and that she was just taking I don't know but it was just like wow for five years I've wanted to that since I sent that message I wanted to message her but I was praying throughout the whole day on Lord how can I start this message how can I even begin to apologize to this young lady and God allowed her to message me that day and we both like we both asked each other for forgiveness and we made it right and you guys don't know how bad this like it was so big that I went when I seen the message I went I got out the car and I went inside and I just started crying to my husband I'm like oh my God because he know and what I've went through throughout that whole time when I was in that season in that classroom to where it was just tears never left my eyes since I was in that class with that young lady it was bad and when when like I told him the message he was like what I was like yeah we made it right we fixed it and I was just crying and he was like he said see God God works in due time that's all he kept saying to me God works in due time and he's like God knows your heart you've been you've been wanting to make it right for five years and God allowed that opportunity to so you guys can fix that situation and not just all I could I was sitting right there now God was like you can't let this morning go by without you sharing that because you I've done so many things in your life and you like that person you like to keep it in the box but you have to share this one so I was like I have to share it so I don't know why he allowed me to say it but God is so amazing amazing I can't even begin to go on to say how much I every day I said Lord thank you for allowing my parents to bring me into this message because it I don't know what I wear what I've been without this message and he allowed things to happen in my life to just bring me back to this word and all I can say is just thank you thank you God bless you [Applause]

some are over and at a wedding in Dubai uh and I thank God for making a way for some of some of them to go just I love seeing the saints of God blessed and able to enjoy Their Blessings amen that God has given them so I know yesterday we had a little situation you'll be seated just for a moment just for a moment amen we had a little situation um brother Solomon and the family were going in through customs there at in Dubai and when they got to customs the Customs agent looked at sister shalom's passport and say hey we're not going to be able to let her come into the country and she's the baby girl um but we're not gonna be able to let her come in like wait a minute and they didn't they've let some of them already through and then the other ones are stuck and so sister Naomi is like hey uh I can't you know just leave my daughter here and say well there's a little discrepancy on my passport and they didn't catch it they're going to London for Easter and they didn't catch it but they marked her as male rather than female and uh so they said no we're not going to let her through we got to send her back home and uh y'all yes you know you're gonna have to just go with it y'all y'all not gonna be able to go through so brother Solomon text me I said brother we gonna pray right now and uh and I got the brothers I sent out a little text to the brothers and the brothers began to pray and and we were just waiting just waiting just waiting and then we got a message from Brother Solomon says thank you for your prayers they're letting them through and uh and and we're gonna be all right so praise God amen amen like you're gonna spend all this money to get there you don't need the devil just taking it like that from you you know so I said God we need you to open up a Red Sea this is their Red Sea so you know the Lord certainly uh manifested himself and I'm so glad we serve a God that can hear a prayer in Florida and answer the prayer all the way in Dubai our God is real amen our God is real so we thank the Lord for that but we do have some others that are traveling Amen on today and other things that are happening I got different texts from different ones and I won't be there I won't be this is no problem no problem so God know who was going to be here today and I thank God for a precious brothers and sisters a man and also join us Amen on today God bless you hey man I I heard from uh sister Torres said she had some family members that's going to be coming to see us today so good to have you on Amen with us on today God bless you amen so uh appreciate the testimony there from Sister Jamila um I think it was very needful you know years ago we used to hear things like that quite often uh unfortunately we done got to this point we got to be careful because there there is a spirit in the land uh and the spirit that comes in the land is that the love of many wax is cold right and when when the love uh when your love begins to wax cold then you never apologize you never even feel bad about anything or you just go right over the top of but when the Holy Spirit is there to kind of mold us and make us and things are not right we go try to make it right amen we don't want nothing to hinder us from making a Rapture amen so I I appreciate that sis and I just think it's something we all need to kind of pay attention to if there's anything if there's something keeping you out of church make that thing right don't give a devil any any space don't give them any space but that devil that was a he's a crew fella and let me tell you something um sometimes you got to pressure into the house Lord when the devil start getting you to just miss one service you're like okay I'm okay missing this one then I missed the next I feel okay mixing the next and then that third one I feel okay missing that you don't realize you're being put in a pot it's it's it's and they say the way that you uh kill a frog or you boil a frog is that you have to put them in the pot and you slowly turn up the heat you don't put them in a hot boiling water right away because if if if if if you put them in a hot bowl and water that frog would jump out of there remember man you gonna kill me in here jump out he gone but what you got to do is slowly turn up the heat get them comfortable get them comfortable don't let the devil get you comfortable missing Church amen don't get comfortable like that but you gotta press your weight this going into the Rapture is not gonna be easy we're gonna have to fight our way into the Rapture just like the children visitor had to fight the way into the promised land amen but we're going to make it by the grace of God so I encourage you take uh take take what was said here today take that testimony there's anything hindering you make it right if it's between husband and wife make it right it'll be a uh parents and kids make it right if it's between people in the church make it right people on your job make it right whatever it needs whatever needs to be done just make it right you don't want anything hindering you amen from making a Rapture praise the Lord all right God bless you certainly appreciate my daughter a man uh being uh uh uh instant in season and playing for us today amen and uh certainly when she go back home we're gonna miss again always good to have her here amen and uh thank God for uh uh my mother-in-law and my my other daughter too I thank God for them amen in their faithfulness and playing uh appreciate um sister Bernice just being ready and available uh you know we had two people on the list and neither those two people are here today that was supposed to be singing so one is traveling and I'm not sure about the other but but thank you sis for just being a man ready and available God got everything under control right amen amen you don't thought this thing out you don't throw it out all right if y'all just staying with me I'll read a scripture and then we will just kind of get started here uh uh what was the first song they started with I know it was a blood or okay yeah um when the blood that Jesus shared me it reaches the highest mountain that one okay it flows okay uh but as as they were starting that I said well my I don't know if they knew what my title was today amen but uh but I'm preaching them brought back by the blood amen brought back by the blood so sometimes God allows certain things to happen and search just to bring a little confirmation that this is exactly where he wants us to be so we thank the Lord I'm I'm asking you to turn with me to Ephesians chapter two amen uh there is so much in this chapter and and I will I'm going to read just a few verses but I think I'm gonna go back uh and just read the others I'm gonna let you be seated uh when I read the others but but it's just it's just a beautiful chapter but verse 13 is where I want to start um for for right now and it says um but now in Christ Jesus Ephesians 2 verse 13. um says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for the making himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross have been slain the enmity thereby amen let's just have a word of Prayer father we are so appreciative of the ability to read scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us to be able to apply what we read Lord and make it present tense We Trust o God that you would just take complete control over this portion of service thank you for what we've uh felt thus far the anointing the power of the spirit here and uh Lord we just thank you for the saints that we're able to make it today and Lord we we know you have something in store for each one there's some that couldn't make it they had various things that were going on that they they need to attend to and we understand just pray that you bless them Lord those that travel bless them those that we haven't even heard from God we pray that you would bless them and that you would strengthen them encourage them strength help them with God through this time of whatever it is that they might be facing what I just pray that you'd be with them help us to keep our focus on you God because you have so much in store for us the enemy trying to block us and keep us from these things but Lord we know that if we just uh remain faithful hold on persevere God will press through and we'll make to make it through whatever it is whatever the storm is that the enemy is trying to bring acts that you just take control of our thoughts Lord even right now in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can uh be seated let me uh like I said I want to uh uh teaching on this brought back by the blood amen that is our thought here for today brought back by the blood amen um recently I was just listening to a sermon from Brother Branham and you know he made a statement in the sermon that just kind of my just brought me a little inspiration and just really uh strengthened me and and I would just say just you know just I'm like wow just I just begin to really reflect and think about uh the blood of the Lord Jesus and just what it means to us you know what what it means um I'm I'm I'm grateful for the blood amen I'm grateful for the blood uh and and I wanted to just kind of uh you know just kind of start us off here I'm gonna go to this first sermon that I want to read from his actual Redemption my power might be the second when it's in the list uh but I wanna I wanna read from there just to kind of talk a little bit about the blood amen we've been brought back by the blood amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we can never talk about the blood enough amen amen but this little uh statement brother Brandon makes in in the sermon um uh Redemption by power he says here a few years ago all the religions of the world met amen I believe it was in London England or somewhere I don't remember exactly says but when they was all speaking for different churches the muhammadans uh the Buddhists and everything says a fellow that represented the American Holiness Church John Witt I believe was his name so then when he got up his time to speak all the religions represented uh in this great Gathering he told the story of lady Maccabee right it says uh how how low she was amen uh got arrested in Oklahoma with a sick on her mouth now imagine that this lady got arrested for having a cigar in her mouth she was going to jail because a woman was smoking a cigar oh my it shows how far we've come right uh nobody'd be arrested for anything like that today but back in those times this lady was arrested because she had a cigar in her mouth amen look at this it says um and that was really bad you know to the people when they looked at that so it says uh it says um uh with a stick on her mouth driving or breaking the speed long going through the streets with the stage coaching what this is it's a it's just a a couple horses that's driving a buggy amen this is the stagecoach it says she had done so many murders my god a woman putting people killing people and so filthy and so ornery uh until when they went to Tar and feather her they wouldn't put their hands on her afraid that they would be polluted all right look at this and when it got the story told in such a dramatic way to uh to every listener was sitting on the end of their seats he said gentlemen of the religions of this world has your religion got anything that would clean the hands of Lady Maccabee and as uh as he got to that question uh he said nobody said a word and and when he when he realized he had everybody right where he wanted him say the preacher jumped up in the air kicked his heels together and slapped his hands he said the blood of Jesus Christ won't only clean her hands but it'll clean her heart amen that's right and and I like that the blood has the ability of changing any situation I don't care how far you've gone away from God the blood is the answer for you today blessed be the name of the Lord if the blood could clean lady Maccabee the blood can clean us Amen brother random goes on to say this Amen in the message uh possessing all things a man possessing all things he says oh isn't it wonderful now now not with our confession our belief our confession of our sins believing that all of our sins is in the sea of forgetfulness and I I believe that all of our sins is in the sea of forgetfulness amen he says he that will confess his sins God is just to Omit them see they're in the sea of the blood of Jesus Christ amen never to be remembered no more how many of you women know what bleach is look at this now how many women know what bleach is it says all of you now let's just take a great big wash full tub of Clorox says that's one bleach Clorox is just one bleach it says it says a great Big Tub full of Clorox and then you're going to take a little eye dropper and you got one drop of Black Ink in that eye dropper that's your sins stand right up over the tub and squeeze it down take your eyedropper squeeze that that that black ink into the Clorox it says squeeze it down then look down in the tub and find the Black Ink my god look down in the tub and find it what become of it what become of the ink when it struck that bleach it was so powerful it just took the coloring right out of it it can never be no more what is it it's gone it's eternally lost this is so important amen when the ink struck the bleach it was eternally lost look at what he says here it says what is it the ink itself becomes Clorox the ink itself becomes Clorox he says that's the blood of Jesus Christ to every confessed sin what is it it's forgotten oh I'm telling you I thank God for the blood there is nothing that the devil can bring against me or you this morning once something has been convinced amen he says it's forgotten it's done it's finished it's omitted it's divorce my God is put away it can never be remembered against you no more thank God for the blood you know the devil's always accusing us of this and accusing us of that and you didn't do this and you but I confessed it when you can tell the devil you confess that God does not remember it anymore the only one trying to remember it is the devil you don't have to receive any accusation that the devil brings in your life not one not one I like the statement that the prophet said here the ink itself becomes the Clorox the ink becomes the Clorox so it's just that powerful a man that once the ink goes into the cold rocks it disintegrates and the ink becomes the Clorox as our sins being washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus and I wanna I wanna say it like this when when uh when we've been washed in the blood you become a representative of that blood when you've been washed in the blood you become a representative of that blood amen amen amen amen all right just stay with me here we uh I got some things that I I know we're gonna you know we'll get into here in in a little bit but uh just you know when brother Brandon make these just little statements to me it just it kind of takes um our understanding the blood and there's many that preach on it you know they talk about it and and we thank God for all the sermons on it but uh our life is a part of this amen um uh like I said you become a representative of that blood that's why the sister had for five years she just couldn't couldn't couldn't let that thing settle I gotta make this thing right I become I was a different person back then can you imagine that I'm going back to something I did before I became a Christian and I want I want to now apologize for something I did way back then because you know what I'm a representative of the blood Hallelujah it means so much the ink itself becomes Clorox now there's a statement that I'm gonna get to a little bit later on but uh you know brother random say the the church or the bride by the spirit is the blood of the Lord Jesus the blood of the Lord Jesus by the spirit you you got my God we're going to get into that in a little bit but by the spirit you are the blood amen amen look at what brother Brandon says in the message adoption it says um but a real Spirit-filled church full of the power of God sitting together in Heavenly places offering spiritual sacrifices Praises of God the Holy Spirit moving among them Discerning sin and calling out things that's among them that's wrong straightening out and making the place level that's what's going on God is making the place level because why always in the presence of God is that Bloody sacrifice now remember we went through it in the sports says you wasn't saved by the blood you're kept saved by the blood but you were saved by grace through faith believing it you are kept saved by the blood my God my God I mean you know uh I'm gonna come back this quote but sometimes enough and you know as we're going through the devil sin of Mind battle and uh and he wants you he might might want you to get off on this I might want you to get off on that maybe even if you're just sitting there uh um watching YouTube and uh as you watch on YouTube all of a sudden because of artificial intelligence they just start throwing different things at you if you are on Facebook if you're on uh any social media they automatically start throwing things at you you never intended to go into those areas but why they start uh showing you all this advertisement like this right it's saying and the devil's trying to lure you into something that you don't need to be in and then even if you don't you don't take the bait even if you don't fall for the trick of the enemy he still plants a seed in your mind and now you got to deal with the Mind battle behind that thing hallelujah amen it wasn't the blood that save you but it's the blood that keeps you it's the blood that say no I'm not going to that website no I'm not going to watch that show no I'm not going to do this no I'm not it's the blood that is keeping you it's the blood say no I'm not going to talk to my co-worker like that no I'm not going to handle the sister it's the blood that's stopping you from doing that thank God for the blood it says it's the it's a blood it says you wasn't saved by the blood you kept saved by the blood but you were saved by grace through faith believing it God knocked at your heart because he predestinated you you looked up and believed it accepted it now the blood makes an atonement for your sins remember I said God does not condemn a center for sinning he's a sinner to begin with he condemns he condemns a Christian for sinning he says and then because uh because uh because he has condemned him Christ took our condemnation so there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walked not after the flesh but after the spirit and if you do anything wrong it isn't willfully you don't sin willfully a man that says willfully goes out on whipless since never come into that blood yet but a man that's once in there he's dead and his life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and the devil can't even find him I like that the devil can't even find him he's so far back in there he'll have to come out of there before the devil can can ever get him for your dead now when you're washed in the blood you get so deep in there that the devil can't even find you you get the do you get so deep that the devil can't find you and the only way that you're going to fall to the devil you got to come from outside of that blood but if you just stay underneath the blood you got protection oh my my I have some scriptures here that I want to just kind of accept the scriptures I want to bring in I'm just kind of talking about what what impact the blood has on us Ephesians 1 7 a man uh it says this my God in whom we have Redemption see the blood brings us Redemption Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins it's the blood brings Redemption as also the blood is what gives us forgiveness amen of our sins according to the riches of his grace oh my uh I was reminded as I was reading that scripture uh you know we we had a little a little Fellowship just amongst the the Ministers of the church on Friday night and young people I want y'all to forgive me we're supposed to have a youth service on Friday night and I completely forgot about uh announcing it and and and getting prepared for it I really I'm sorry about that so we'll have to make that up to our young people but uh but you know we took the time and just took the ministers and we all went out to eat a little bit and and something just kind of come up in the conversation just a real real blessing uh we were just kind of talking about some things and and I was reminded of of a story where brother Brandon you know especially with the scripture the blood um it's we get Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace and I was reminded of this of the story that brother Brandon so and uh you know people need to hear about the blood oh hallelujah amen people people you need to know the power of the blood people need to know that their sins can be forgiven because of the blood right and and I was reminded of the story brother Branham told how he went into a restaurant a man and when he went into the restaurant uh he noticed a police officer doing one thing with with somebody was not his wife and he noticed this other lady amen an older lady sitting there with two gentlemen and and uh and you know and carrying herself in a way that just really ungodly and uh it just started noticing all these things in the restaurant he just he said Lord do my children have to grow up and be a part of something like this he said do they have to live in a world like he says why would you just destroy this place God why can't you just sit here I mean look at the sin just destroy this place God said come here I need to talk to you just for a minute and brother Brandon was called behind the door and when he got there behind the door Amen in the restaurant uh he got he saw world just turned into spinning and as the world was spinning he noticed amen that Jesus was a man was on the cross and and he says uh uh he saw these little black spots leaving the Earth and as they were leaving Earth they would hit Jesus and Jesus was like a bumper over the world his blood was a bumper for the city it would hit Jesus then it would bounce back but he would just see the pain in Jesus face as it was he says he's saying Lord is that what these people sin is doing to you causing you to feel all that pain he said no no it's not what their sin is doing to me it says it's what your sin is doing to me he said he said oh my so every little black spot he saw leaving the Earth it was his own sin that was causing Jesus amen to wince and pain he says he said he says now what I need to tell you is that I forgiven you for your sins amen but uh but but you want to condemn everybody in the restaurant for their sins especially this lady right here you want to condemn it for our sins but I've forgiven you for your sins oh my mama he said he he say he says now if I forgiven you why don't you have a little Mercy for her we need to learn how to learn to have mercy for other people when we've been washed in the blood we got to give them an opportunity to get watched in that same blood now let me tell you something life won't change until they come in contact with the blood that's how your life changed you came in contact with the blood and I'm telling the blood is a person it's the person of the Lord Jesus brother Brandon brother Brandon said Lord I'm sorry forgive me I didn't realize I was doing that to you and and here he is as the prophet as the prophet but it just hit me as I was talking to the brothers God needed to take the prophet to that through that experience because that lady that he was getting ready to tell is this experience too that lady was in a condition where she thought a man that uh she had gone past the blood this lady was thinking to himself she said you know when brother Brandon sit down and start talking to say uh ma'am do you mind if I have if I pull up a seat she said no I already got company says no I'm not here to talk about that I'm not trying to I'm trying to be another customer say what I need what I just want to explain something that just happened I need to ask you oh help Hallelujah asks you to forgive me brother bran I must asking the lady to forgive him for a thought he had about her if your thought is wrong concerning your brother or sister huh not even some of you did but just your thought was wrong concerning your brother's sister brother Brandon wanted to make that right his thoughts was wrong concerning his sister now now when he when he sat down he began to talk to the lady he says uh ma'am you know I was just sitting here condemning everybody in this restaurant and I saw you here with these men I was just condemning you and I I just thought God should come down and Destroy This Place and he and uh and they just began to talk and and uh and brother Bradham explained this what the vision had just occurred to her and she said she says you know are you the preacher that's down there preaching are you brother Brandon she said he said yes he says I say I'm embarrassed to be here in front of you like this I'm so embarrassed she said would you pray for me say I want to tell you my story my husband now and one one quote she said her husband another quote said it was my father but somehow she was related to a preacher I said my husband or was her father was she was she was she was raised up in a house or lived in the house where preaching was was was was was happening and somehow after this person died she got disconnected from God and uh and she started moving into a life that she should have never moved into but yet this woman used to be a Christian and she thought to herself I am beyond the blood so when brother Branham told me say no the world was spinning and then there was a uh Jesus was whistling in pain but every time a black spot would go he would be would push it back away from the presence of God so he said if that black streak would have made him to the present of God I would have been wiped out he says but he told me he forgave me and I was he said he said and you want to condemn her what I need to let you know remember is that there's still Blood on the cross for you amen there's still room at the cross for you and amen and I don't care what you've done I might be looking at you in some some kind of way here in this restaurant but there is blood a man on The Mercy Seat just for you ma'am say they change that whole environment once the lady got a revelation that there was still blood for her it changed the whole environment in the restaurant somebody needs to hear about the power of the blood here Colossians 1 verse 13 through 14. who have delivered us from the power of Darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins amen place it under the blood amen Revelation 12 and 11 and brother Troy quoted this one early in the service and they overcame him if you're going to overcome the devil my God if you're going to overcome the devil you have to do it by the blood of lamb and you know just stay under the blood if you stay under the blood the devil can't even find you so that's how you overcome don't come from underneath that blood stay under the blood they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony oh I just love this and they love not their lives unto death if you were just the worry of testimony amen should be what has the blood done for you has the blood change you has the blood-free Jew has the blood amen uh delivered you if the blood has done something for you let I mean continue to share that testimony of what God has already done forget about what the devil trying to do tell them what God has already done through his blood for you glory to God they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb my God I tell you the truth I mean sometimes you get into something like this it's just little things that people need to give them the victory sometimes we want something so great so big no God want to give you something real small this right here would give you the victory over the devil every day in your life stay under the blood and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they loved not their lives unto death Hebrews chapter 13 verse 12-13 amen it says this says wherefore uh Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood so the blood brings us sanctification and what sanctification is is clean it cleans us and it sets us aside for service amen wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood Suffer Without the gate and then it goes on Paul says let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach also Hebrews 10 and 14. my God I love a man where the blood has done for me uh Paul says this for by one offering this blood sacrifice that he did at Calvary by one offering he hath perfected oh blessed be the name of the Lord forever them that are Sanctified I'm standing before you perfect amen you're sitting here today perfect Hallelujah and it's not perfect in the way that we see perfect amen because we I'll never measure up to your level of perfect uh Perfection and you'll never let measure up to my love of perfection but in Christ We Stand perfect because of what the blood did at calvary's Cross just for us amen we sit here as perfect perfect uh perfect people on the Earth on Earth because of what Christ did at the cross I thank God for his blood I couldn't do it without his blood man I can't keep myself I need the blood I need the blood I I I I I I I I I ca I mean it ain't no sense of me waking up in the morning if I don't have that blood I won't make it through the day without the blood amen I won't overcome the enemy without the blood amen the blood is what's keeping me oh hallelujah hallelujah amen Revelation 1 oh I'm sorry uh first John 1 7. blessed be the name of the Lords we were brought to Perfection through a perfect sacrifice at the cross first John 1 7 says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and look at this one and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin there is not one sin not one sin that the devil can hold over your head because the blood cleans it cleans you from all sin your sin is like that little drop of ink that goes into the core rocks it disintegrates and you stand before God perfect oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when you got a revelation of what the blood's done for you no matter and I mean we'll read this later on but you know there there's nothing against you I say there's nothing against you not one thing is being held against you you might be holding against yourself but God don't hold it against you amen there is nothing against you I don't care how many mistakes you made there is nothing that's that could be held against you when you bring it underneath the blood oh how we need to hear this amen Revelation 1 verse 5-6 it says this and see the blood brought us back into a perfect standing with God uh it was a perfect sacrifice it was a complete sacrifice it has restored us back to a place in God it it brought us back amen we've been brought back what Adam and Eve lost in the beginning we have been brought back into fellowship with God and to that same place with God by the blood of the Lord Jesus look at this Revelation 1 5-6 says and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us I like it and watched us from our sins in his own blood now watch what happens after he's washed you and hath made us it's the blood that makes you a king and a priest oh Hallelujah come on somebody it's the blood that makes you a king a blood makes you royalty oh you wishing me out acting like we defeated a king is the final Authority in the Kingdom a king recognizes his position a king don't sit defeated a king lets his lets his voice be heard and when his forces hurt everything has to respond to the king brother the king won't want everybody to go get water for the king whatever the king won't he can have and his blood hath made us oh I sometimes I don't know if we're getting I'ma tell you another thing brother Branham said there are certain truths we need to emphasize this scripture is the one he said we need to emphasize his blood hath made us Kings and Priests unto God his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen I'm gonna tell you something that right there gonna catch up with you that Revelation Gonna Catch You one day and it's gonna hit you out of nowhere his blood being what you'll be shouting and jumping and praising God hallelujah when you recognize the power of the blood hey I once was lost but now I'm fouled I couldn't find myself it was the blood nothing but the blood oh as I start going through every song that I can think about the blood inside God start going through my head that's why I was so I was so blessed when they open up the song it reaches to the highest mountain open up the server they reaches to the high flows through the lowest I don't care where you at today the blood can reach you it'll pick you up it'll turn you around the blood will and not only not on that when you when when you when you realize it was Grace that sent the blood Grace Grace saved you by Grace we are saved through faith and that not of ourselves it's a gift from God it says but the blood is what's going to keep us safe the blood keep me encouraged the blood is what makes me want to keep pressing on it's the blood that does this I recognize what his blood has done for me amen amen amen amen look at this Amen in the message condemnation by representation now you know uh as we're getting this quote prepared this is the sermon that I was listening to this week where you know brother Branham uh was just making some statements and I said my just what a what a blessing Amen to uh uh uh you know just to hear this in this message and I want I'm gonna just say this you know before we get to it but in this message if you would go back and listen to it brother Brandon was inspired by you know just different things he was seeing in and he began to talk about hybrids and how high breeding was just it's wrong you know I mean it was looking at corn and it's like look at this corn and and and and how they how they how they uh producing the corn but it's hybrid corn it says this corn with you know if you if you took the took it and tried to Resort again and have it replant again it wouldn't grow anything see hybrid and it can't grow again I mean it's just it's not the original hallelujah amen it's not the original so you know he started talking about high breeding and talked about in so many different areas and and I want you to understand you know even like when you see a mule my God a mule is a hybrid animal right amen uh you know and and uh it's a horse and a donkey come together and produce this meal and it could work like crazy it said but at the end of working like crazy it'll kick you right he said say the mule is just it's just something he said but you can never immune can't reproduce yourself you got to bring two animals together to try to produce that mule Hallelujah you know he talked about it even in fruit trees amen and how hybrid and took place and sometimes a a Vine that's connected amen like you could have a lemon tree connected to Orange Vine amen uh the root of an orange tree he says he says it would produce life it would produce lemon because that's what's in the branch he says but but it's it's it's getting a life from a man from from another source my God it's hybrid amen it says when you see these things even like you know some of the oranges that they give us and you know you you go to the store you pick up something if that thing ain't got no seed in it it can't reproduce itself and it may tastes good but it's really not good for you high breeding amen it's not good he said even in people we got to watch this High breeding it says you got to watch that amen go back and just listen to the tape you'll see uh uh you know that you know even when we start talking about that I know sometimes I get very very delicate because you know of um mixed marriages and everything we understand that say it and I just wanna I wanna make this clear if there was a couple that was mixed marriage I have no problem with them coming to church they can there they can fellowship at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle I don't want nobody to feel like a people that somebody's mixed marriage King Fellowship here in church yes they can yes they can the blood still washes all that too the only thing is is brother Brandon teaches us that you know uh sometimes we find ourselves in situations teach your children not to do certain things so our job is just to teach our kids if brother brother bam said just watch that High breathing don't do things like that amen watch this now now um uh uh uh in this in this sermon here and and um uh condronation by representation it says this it says so when they see the inspirator of his wife it says uh Eve when he come to meet Jesus and said oh yes it is written that he'll give the Angels charge overly lest any time thou dast thy foot against the stone they'll bear it up yes it's also written he wouldn't cross him up he was God made flesh he was my savior and my God he couldn't cross him up what he what'd he do then he embraced the cross and on the cross he died for me and for you and for the world that he might restore back again to God what sons and daughters like in the Garden of Eden before they got crossed up in theology now this is important to me the sons of God Sons in the Garden of Eden they got crossed up in their theology you know and the blood actually bring us back to a correct theology watch this and then it says uh amen uh uh embrace the cross on the cross he died for me and you and for the world that he might restore me again God's again to God what sons and daughters like in the Garden of Eden before they got crossed up in theology oh God if people can only see that if I could only profound that into the people Jesus died that he might take away from this hybrid Church stuff that he might bring your minds and Faith away from what man has said back to what God Said not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days of Miracles has passed maybe maybe that won't happen oh brother God said it happens in that settles it that's for always God said so look he says Jesus died that he might breed back and see that's where I'm getting my inspiration brought back by the blood Jesus died that he might breathe back oh Hallelujah only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ can breathe back again a person that won't vary one word from what God Said only the blood can bring a person back to a place where they won't vary from one word God said only the blood could bring us back Even Adam they vary from what the word of God said but only the blood could bring us back oh Hallelujah hey this this yes it certainly reaches the highest mountain and flows through the Lord's Valley I want you to get this the blood is bringing us back where we believe the word I'ma say that again the blood is bringing us back where we believe the word where we're not crossed up in our theology Jesus went to the cross the street in our theology [Applause] he went to the cross the street in our theology all these different denominations that was not his will he went to the cross the street and all that stuff out the blood brings it back hallelujah hallelujah look at this he says Jesus Christ he says uh Jesus died that he might breathe back oh Hallelujah only the blood can do that only through the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ can breathe back again a person that won't vary one word from what God Said Eve showed her weakness the church show what she did she said well maybe you maybe you're right maybe God wouldn't hold me responsible because I just well if uh what difference does it make as long as I'm baptized see you know people reasoning what difference does it make as long as I oh so that shows you need another breeding that shows that something's got to come back to you to bring you to a faith that what God Said not one jot or one Tittle shall pass from God's word till it's all fulfilled let every man's word be alive but and his be true Christ came that he might breathe back by the Holy Spirit I'ma say I just like that brought back by the blood Christ came that he might breed back by the holy spirit let me keep reading it says oh brother as we sit together now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit breathing upon us like we are now breeding back look at the look at what the statements say breathing back taking away the rubbish of theology so the blood that cleanses us from our sins can I talk about the blood the blood that that brings forgiveness the blood that brings Redemption the blood that makes us Kings and Priests until God is the same blood that's breathing away the rubbish theology can we get that yeah I mean everybody can see Christ down on the cross everybody can see him Rising again on the third day but but when he died when he rose again the very purpose of that he had a greater plan in mind amen his blood was to breed back the rubbish of theology the blood is supposed to watch you not only from your sins the blood washes you from false theology all right brought back by the blood I'll tell you I'll tell you I I don't even see it the way I should see it but I'm seeing enough of her just to bring it to your attention the blood is what washes you from Bad theology the blood will keep you the blood will fix you the blood will straighten some things out the blood will do it the blood of Jesus will do this breathing back taking away the rubbish of theology take him amen uh taking away the rubbish of the world man-made doctrines having forms of governments denying the power thereof breed it back into an unadulterated faith in God Jesus saves it oh I know it's written but you uh but you know what said thou shall eat Jesus said and it's also written it's also written yes it's written that he'll do this and you'll you'll you shall turn these but if you are the Son of God you can perform a miracle here before me and turn these songs and bread let me see you do it he be he be minding Satan see the shrewdness of God there it's written man should not live by bread alone see him right with the word he defeated Satan every time right on the word he stayed with the word and if he came to breed us back to sons and doors of God like we was at the beginning how can we get away from the word then how can we ever get anywhere till we get back to the word the blood is what brings us back to the word you know as I was just thinking about this breeding back for me I'm not uh I'm not into uh uh animals and things like that and not even into the farming and I mean I don't even know too much about season planting nothing and getting it to grow if you if you gave it to me and wanted me to get in the garage all I can do is pray for it but get out there and water it out I don't know what I'm doing I just stayed that's not my Lane I know how to stay in my Lane amen right but uh but you know um um so a lot of times when when brother Brandon used this this type of language because you know him being a hunter and he's a man of the Wilderness and all this so he uses a lot of terms amen kind of like uh what John the Baptist used later acts at the root of the tree what you talking about John you know they said get rid of get rid of that sin problem right at the root that's what he's trying to tell you but brother Brandon would also use a man uh uh types and and and shadows and things like that from nature so when he uses the term that that Jesus blood was to breed back I said well let me go look at what this word breeding and everything is all about so when I go when I go and I start searching that I always go to a kid's website not even I try not to go to adult websites because I can't understand these people saying so I go put it down in children's terms for me Glory I got a master's degree but I understand and think things in children's terms that's the way I think hallelujah amen sorry I go to this children's uh science website and and I just looked up you know breeding and it says whatever the name living things reproduce to create Offspring or babies of the same kind this process is known as breeding right and it's responsible for the creation of new life from existing life amen so breathing is when we're bringing in New Life Hallelujah no matter what the speech is amen humans when another a child I mean we got a granddaughter gonna be born any minute now amen the parents amen have bread and they're bringing forth New Life hallelujah amen when dogs get together they bring forth new life amen and at my house we have a uh um uh what's the shutters and uh you know right above our door and you know we're none of us knew none of us knew this we just we just got the shutters up there next day you know there was a you know uh uh maybe uh uh just not what would you just a I don't like Bush kind of like a little piece of bush Twigs there's one twig there okay nothing maybe the wind blew it up there another twig there oh maybe the wind blow that up there because we had some strong winds another twig now and next thing you know we look up it has a bird sitting there and every time we come out the house that bird is looking at us and then sometimes my son-in-law's been there and there's another bird coming attack my son-in-law say now don't you touch that bird up there and that what it is it's a mother watching over her babies now I could have knocked the thing down but they breathing and we want to see them babies come forth Hallelujah glory to God right say something but anytime amen whatever the species either get together and another of that species have been born breathing has taken place look at this now look at this look at this uh because brother random is using the term breed back right breed back the blood has it's breathing us back from a man theology rubbish the rubbish of theology the blood is bringing us back to the the pure word of God the the blood is what does that and let me tell you once you get back Hallelujah once you get back to the pure understanding of what God meant in his word then you gotta stay behind the blood once you get back hallelujaha this message is blood this message is blood look at this look at this so so they have they have um this uh this term called selective breathing amen and and what selective breeding is it's a name as its name suggests selective breeding is when specific living things are selected to breed in order to bring out certain traits my God my God you know in order to bring out certain traits do we want to bring these two animals together and we want them to breed they do it but they back in the slavery days they did it with humans if they wanted a bigger and stronger slave they got a big woman a big man and put them together they were selective breathing they weren't even married but they were forced to do this thing it was selective breathing and even in uh with animals that that people that do these type of things it's selective in their breeding they want to bring out certain traits they say for example racehorses that have strong well-developed legs may be bred together to create Stronger Faster Horses I mean brother brother Jose is into the horse business and sometimes he has to uh he was telling me a little situation where there was a horse that um uh somebody was coming to buy but that horse somehow hurt his foot and uh and they knew that the the people were coming to buy the horse and these are this you know this ain't no cheap horse I mean this is a lot of money so so they call brother those who said we need you here right now uh we getting ready to sell this horse and this horse is you know looking to serve where they knew if that horse would have walked that out there like that they could forget about it the sale was over I mean they wouldn't get they won't get nothing so they called Brotherhood said we need you could you please fix this shoe fix them do something for this horse and brother Jose he said I come he got out there when he got there to the horse he looked and said Lord I don't know what I'm gonna do so he just prayed so he prayed he prayed for the horse amen and when he prayed for the horse the horse began to walk the walk the right way need to walk now I don't know how much he got but them people got a lot more over his prayer but they they knew that they wanted to sell that horse because of selective breathing sometimes when they want a fast a strong horse I mean you know these horses that run in in the in the Kentucky Derby they breed these horses to be able to do that and sometimes they get them they run fast and and then next they know they put them to the side come on trying to find something else is selective breeding let me go a little further because this selective breeding is exactly amen what what brother Branham is talking about here because when I looked up the word breed back it's breeding of domestic but not exclusively animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype see these are words that I don't understand amen uh in an attempt to achieve an animal breed of a with a phenotype that resembles a wild type and ancestor usually one that has gone extinct can I read that again breed back as breeding of domestic but not exclusively animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles a wild-type ancestor usually one that's gone extinct now what the word phenotype is it's a set of observable characteristics or traits of an organization so they're trying to get certain traits to come out so we selectively breathe we put these two atoms together and we're trying to get certain traits to come out Hallelujah we're trying to get certain traits to come out if we can just get them together and when brother random say that the blood amen it breeds us back away from the rubbish of theology what God has done is through his word amen tried to get connected with a certain type of person and once he gets connected through the blood and through the Revelation where he can bring back the certain the same attributes that was in Adam and Eve hey the blood is what brings us back I'm brought back by the blood see science has to breathe back to create a stronger animal and study the traits of an ex of an extinct animal God is breeding back through the revealed word to bring it bring man back to where he fell from In the Garden of Eden and see when when it seems to so now when I look at the blood and I look at breeding back then I see the whole purpose of restoration let's go to Restoration Laboratory this is a form that's breeding back is a form of restoration oh blessed be the name of the Lord I thank God for the blood the blood the blood the blood here uh it says to restore means to bring back to restore a claim can be enforced now to bring anything back to its right for owner where it belongs therefore some way it went away from its right for owner and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate amen where it was at the first time bring it back into its natural condition and in order to do this we have a right to enforce if there's a law to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore like if somebody stole some property and they're holding the property captive then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces and forces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner into its prior or First Estate enforcement oh what a text how I like to have two days on that end Force see we could take a sermon right there enforce now brother Neville preach for us I'm just going to talk to you teach a Sunday school lesson so that it'll uh it'll get uh to continue on I hope with what we had what he had he says enforce then we are we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is is the law see brother brother Smiley hit that on last week that you know when they found a diamond it was against the law if it wasn't cut it was against off it wasn't because it had to be cut God has a law he says in the word the his word is the law and God in the word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right my my my we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back you can tell the devil right now give it back give back my son give back my daughter get back my husband get back my wife give back my uncle my auntie give back my health give it back and look at this when you when now you you got to be the one to open your mouth and say it give it back Satan look at this look at this and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees say it's thus says the Lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit's dead I make him to it you not the one making the devil do it the Holy Ghost is there to make the devil give it back I love this the law of the land is the force it's by the land for the land by the law but but the law of the spirit of God is the force Satan to give up that which he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men my he took uh took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them amen I I I just say it give it back Satan give give back my health get back my child amen get get give it back praise God give back my family give back my niece give back my nephew give give it back they don't belong to you give it back the blood breeds these things back we're brought back by the blood I love this Hallelujah I told you I was going to get to this amen uh uh and I want to read this one out of uh out of Crisis the mystery of God revealed now when uh the prophet preached Christ is the Minister of God revealed he said you know I just I when you listen to a prophet speak and and this is this is different let me just kind of clear clarify because um you know the church has the church has gone off and just kind of focused on just uh maybe one element of a prophet and uh and that element is just somebody that would rise up and say thus saith the Lord and typically that thus saith the Lord is always you're going to get a blessing you're going to get a house you're gonna get a car you're gonna get a breakthrough you I mean you're gonna get this when you look in scripture meaning in prophets say thus say Lord You're Gonna Die dog's gonna lick your blood dog's gonna lick your wife blood it was a different type of Prophecy I mean now if somebody rolls up in the church and said that today people be running out of church false prophet Was Elijah false prophet no he's he told me yeah Ahab dog's gonna lick your blood right amen and the dogs licked his blood I mean so so you know we we we we we don't we don't sometimes the church world just don't understand really what a real Prophet is amen but uh but you know God sent us a prophet in this day and we and we have the word that has come from him one of the things that you know I'll tell you another thing about a prophet a a prophet is able to give us the word and tell us things that we would have never saw had God not elevated him to a certain height to be able to see these things now my example of this is when you pick up your Bible and you read Genesis God gave the word to a prophet the prophet Moses told us everything that happened in Genesis I mean with the with the with the first day of creation Moses went all the way back to the first day of creation he was not there how how could he write about what happened on the first Recreation when he was not there see that's what that's that's the ability of a prophet to go into areas that you'd never be able to go to now when brother Branham preached Christ as the mystery of God revealed he went all the way in the mind of God and said God had three things in his mind and he told us that these are three things God had in his mind from the beginning of time God wanted to have amen he says he wanted to have the preeminence in his people uh he said he said he wanted to reveal himself to his people he always wanted to reveal himself to his people he wanted to have the preeminist in his people the ability to be able to lead and guide his people and then he also said he wanted to restore his people back to eat in conditions again the same way Moses had the ability to go up and see the mind of God God use the prophet today go all the way back in the mind of God and tell us these three things God was looking for to do it restoring people back to eating conditions again can I can't yeah I don't know if we realize what Adam and Eve had Adam could if if you know here in Florida be so hot Adam could be sitting there maybe the son just just beating down I'm saying I just I don't feel like being in the sun right now tree move bring me some shade he don't feel like walking to go get no water stream come run right here let me just get some water from right here whatever I mean Adam was so powerful in the garden that when God got created the animals you know who named them the every name that we that we and and here's a good thing when Adam called it by his name that is still his name today God never went behind Adam said no no I don't want to call it that Adam it's going to be called it no whatever Adam said God honored God wants to take you back to that place that whatever you say that's why he told us in this world if you say to the mountain be thou removed and and cast into this to the Sea don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say the second Adam was restoring us through his blood back to the place that the first Adam lost we've been brought back by the blood and I'm telling I'm not waiting for something to happen before I start operating like that I start operating right now when I have need yesterday when that brother called that knee that's no we're gonna pray right now and pray with authority God we need a Red Sea to open now we're not taking No for a financial no we need something to happen now and God moved on the scene right then and man I love it when the Saints begin to pray here brother Brandon makes a statement here in the crisis the mystery of God revealed and I know that I I may have to I'm be coming to the close here but I have to pick this up because you know I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm Gonna Leave You a man with a very powerful thought but in order to leave you there I got to show you where brother Randall's bringing these things out of the scripture so here watch this I told you earlier you know the the the the the the ink when when when your sin is dropped into the Clorox it's like a drop of ink going into the Clorox it disintegrates never to be found again he says the ink becomes the Clorox he says the same way what happens when our sin is washed in the blood of Jesus and I said I said you become a representative of the blood when you've been washed by the blood of Jesus now watch this statement in Christ is the mystery of God revealed it says notice making it known now my there's just so much here we can just keep on going notice the tree of Christ the body in the garden making making this mystery known to this brought tree watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam you believe he was going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeemed back home again so so like I said the blood brings us back to these places that place where Adam and Eve was at the very beginning before sin the he says going back uh oh let me let me uh just drop something let me hold me right there I mentioned to you all in this definition of breeding back it's breeding of domestic but not exclusively animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles a wild-type ancestor usually one that has gone extinct now you know uh they they do a lot of studying of animals that have gone extinct just you know over time and um uh as I was just thinking about this this this this subject there is one animal that has gone extinct that they will never be able to breathe back never be able to breathe back now they tried this and they try that but they'll never be able to breed it back because what happened to this animal y'all not gonna let me preach but but what happened to this animal in the very beginning this animal is in the Garden of Eden and uh and this animal had the ability to reason this animal could talk just like humans could talk Hallelujah Satan knew that this animal had this capability so Satan got inside this animal and began to have a conversation with Eve now this was not the first day Eve and the serpent had a conversation they talked all the time hallelujah it's just like any adulterous act that happens you just don't fall in adultery you always having conversations with people before you get there amen but here here you know whether somebody you met online you still had a conversation with him you didn't just meet nobody in the parking lot somewhere and just no you don't do things like that it's a conversation that happens come on somebody but by here you know this animal called The Serpent amen is there in the garden in its original condition Hallelujah now evidently this serpent was standing on two feet just like human beings and it was the only animal in the garden that could mate with the human and have a human child hallelujah amen or meet with his own Serpent and have a serpent it was the only animal that was able to do that but through the curse of what happened in the Garden of Eden God took that animal and put it on his belly so they'll never be able to breed it back it looks like a snake today but one day it stood on two feet so so so really when we talk about what happened to Garden Eaton and people look here let me tell you something what God is doing is trying to breathe through the blood breed his people back away from the rubbish of theology because we got caught up in this rubbish they told us that it was an apple that Eve ate how did the apple how could the lady eat an apple and get pregnant how could that happen because if if if if people are not eating apples then getting pregnant that ain't what happened back then Hallelujah I mean we know we know how people get pregnant if the way people get pregnant today it was the same way they got pregnant back then come on somebody but what it was amen and even we know in the scripture that uh that this had to be uh the The Serpent and Eve got together there was an adulterous act that was the original sin that happened in the garden and adulterers act with the serpent Satan used a serpent hello somebody now now let me tell you something the Bible actually tells us very clearly that uh that that Cain was of that Wicked one Cain was not Adam's son the Bible said Cain was of that Wicked word and that's the scripture you find in the New Testament now how was it that the Believers in the New Testament had that Revelation but somehow we lost it God gotta breed us back from the rubbish of theology here here you know uh the Bible said came was on that weekend when you look through the genealogies in the scripture you'll see that Cain's name was never mentioned in Adam's genealogy come on somebody Abel's name was never mentioned the reason Abel's name was never mentioned because he never had children Cain killed him before he had children Hallelujah somebody right so so we see Adam Seth but we never see Kings and even when you go back to Genesis why do you see two different lines of of lineages they start from Cain they start from Adam come on somebody see it's something it's something greater we have to be we have to be brought back through the blood through the blood we brought back from the rubbish of theology I mean let me just say it like this if we can't get Genesis right I'm talking about the first two chapters how are we going to get the rest of the Bible right and even in the Book of Proverbs Solomon picked it up picked up the thought he'd say why does a a woman um commit an adulterous act and then wipe her mouth and say I ain't ate nothing why Solomon put them through what does what does what does does having a a commitment adultery have with eaten why Solomon put them two together amen hello somebody I I got I don't I I don't have the quote here uh I I I somebody asked brother random question now if the Bible Clearly say that Eve had a man from the Lord so how you say this was Satan's son you know but the Bible also say it was of that Wicked one so how you say that but the Bible says a man really said every person every person born in this world came from the Lord he said Adolf Hitler came from the Lord I got a direct quote every person no matter Pharaoh came from the Lord you want to know why because it takes a miracle for a child to be born on this Earth if God is not involved in the process of a birth we're gonna have a big problem you know when the woman's body goes into uh she just expands 10 centimeters that and it happens just for the child to be born then it goes back just like that who did that who did that ain't no pill she ain't nothing God does that to the woman's body so every every child has to come from God evil or good they still got to come from God the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood is breeding us back I'm telling y'all the blood bringing us back amen amen from the rubbish of theology let me let me read this quote I'm I'm going to end here but I'll come back and pick this up I got good news and bad news good news I'm gonna pick it up and preach it again bad news it won't be next Sunday notice make it known now my there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice the tree of Christ the body in the garden make it now making this mystery known to this Bright Tree watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam you believe he was going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeem back home again that's Christ and the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and Same Spirit and everything else look at this watch this now the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood I want you to think about that now now I want you to just leave that there so you can just just meditate on that when brother Branham is writing his notes these are little things that he would jot down these just little notes and he just be preaching needs to be preaching then he just make this point then they keep on going but these are his little notes and when he makes that statement this is a note that the Holy Spirit inspired him to say the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't ever touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall you want to know why we won't fall because we stay underneath the blood we don't come out from the blood we stay underneath the blood we realize what the blood has done for us she won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah she's ordained not to not fall she won't fall she's predestinated to it blessed is the man who God will not impute sin you ministers know what I'm uh what what I'm speaking of a couple doesn't you sitting sitting here see bless is the man who God will not impute sin David says know this redeeming back with him going home back to eternal life in a human body eating drinking living forever Isaiah said they building houses and inhabit them plant Vineyards and eat the fruit they'll not build in another take it the children won't take it but they'll be there with their offspring my God amen amen what what we got to look forward to he'll he'll built it and stay there amen amen he don't build in another eat he builds and eats himself amen I mean you think about uh um shamgar he would plan in this field and after he planted his field my God after the crops I mean he done watched over he done water he doesn't kept all the weeds out and then all of a sudden when it's time to get fruit out the field he'll come to Phyllis I mean these these uh I think it was the Philistines they would come and just take everything from him Sam of God he got tired of it one day and year after year after year they say but no this is the last time Over My Dead Body I'ma die for my field a day and that man beat down Philistines like I don't know what it was built up frustrations and he just took whatever instrument he had in his house all they had was farming instruments no sword no nothing no Spirit just took what he had and beat down them Philistines this man was serious about don't worry about Hashem God when we get to the other side you plant you ain't got to worry about nobody coming to take your stuff amen Ahab ain't gonna be there taking nobody's Vineyard he don't build another eat he builds and eats himself in man what is it his bride going back with him redeemed back to the original Adam and Eve again for death is Left Behind they look back at the cross and see that death has been paid and now by faith we're resurrected with him sitting in Heavenly places right now looking back to what redeemed us waiting for the husband to come to march on home with him three-fold purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve and every prophet and down Through the Ages and he that has become he that was he which is and he which is to come the whole manifestation revelation of the word of God Adam and Eve going going back home again redeem god making himself known I'm leaving you with that thought but we're going to come back and pick it up the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit see you that that that that that ink was dropped into the Clorox he says when that ink is dropped into the Clorox you can never find the ink anymore he made the statement the ink becomes the Clorox I just left you with a quote to help you understand you've been washed in the blood now you become the blood by the spirit s let's pray father how can we not thank you for
