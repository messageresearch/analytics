[5:04] sweet
[5:06] sound.
[5:15] Just let the musicians play softly.
[5:19] Go to the Lord before the word in
[5:21] prayer. Go to the Lord in prayer.
[5:25] Lord God, we want to thank you, oh Lord,
[5:27] for um your grace and mercy that you've
[5:30] given us, oh Lord God. Lord, we realize,
[5:34] oh Lord God, that it's your love, oh
[5:36] Lord Jesus Christ, that has uh that has
[5:39] captivated us, oh Lord Jesus Christ, and
[5:41] brought us to your presence, oh Lord
[5:43] God. Lord, we realize that we don't
[5:45] deserve anything, oh Lord Jesus Christ.
[5:48] Lord, Lord, when you went to the cross,
[5:50] oh Lord God, the prophet said that you
[5:52] bore all of our sins. Oh Lord God, all
[5:55] of our failures, all of our mistakes, oh
[5:57] Lord God, Lord, you willingly took those
[6:00] on, oh Lord Jesus Christ, though you
[6:02] didn't deserve it, oh Lord Jesus Christ.
[6:05] So Lord, anything that we receive from
[6:07] you, oh Lord God. Lord, we are thankful,
[6:10] oh Lord Jesus Christ, we just want to
[6:12] thank you for your love, oh Lord God,
[6:14] and the position that you've placed us
[6:15] in, oh Lord God, to be your children, oh
[6:18] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we thank you
[6:21] for this grace that you've extended us,
[6:23] oh Lord God. Lord, there are those in
[6:25] the audience, oh Lord, that need a
[6:26] special touch from you, oh Lord God.
[6:29] Lord, some are sick in the body, oh Lord
[6:31] Jesus Christ, and some are weary in the
[6:33] in spirit and soul, Lord Jesus Christ.
[6:37] But Lord, because you cried out for us
[6:39] on the cross, oh Lord God, Lord, it was
[6:41] a legit pain and anguish that you went
[6:43] through, oh Lord God. Meaning, oh Lord
[6:46] God, that you mean exactly what you say.
[6:48] Oh Lord, when you say you are a healer,
[6:50] oh Lord God, when you said that you are
[6:52] a comforter, oh Lord Jesus Christ, Lord,
[6:54] you meant it, oh Lord Jesus Christ,
[6:56] you're meant to bring it to us, oh Lord
[6:58] God. Lord, we are nothing but sheep, oh
[7:01] Lord Jesus Christ, which means we can do
[7:03] nothing, oh Lord God, unless your voice
[7:05] speaks to us, Lord, give us revelation
[7:07] to know that your promises are true, oh
[7:10] Lord God. Lord, give us more of your
[7:13] spirit to say amen, oh Lord God, to your
[7:15] word in the face of adversity, oh Lord
[7:17] God, because we know, oh Lord God, that
[7:20] your word formed the foundations of the
[7:22] world, oh Lord, it can help us in our
[7:24] situations, oh Lord God. Lord, be with
[7:27] the service, oh Lord God, and bless
[7:29] everyone, oh Lord. Anoint our eyes, our
[7:31] hearts, our ears to hear from you, Lord
[7:33] God, so we can see more more of you,
[7:36] Lord God, especially as the time is
[7:39] coming to an end, Lord God. We ask this
[7:42] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[7:44] Amen.
[7:46] Thank you musicians.
[7:48] Um
[7:50] so the title that the Lord had given me
[7:52] to speak uh on to tonight is the true
[7:56] church of God. And we're going to start
[7:58] our um our biblical reading out of
[8:02] Matthew. We're going to read two two uh
[8:04] places. Uh Matthew 24 uh and it's going
[8:07] to be Matthew chapter 24 27-33. And then
[8:11] also verse uh 42
[8:14] and just say amen once you get there you
[8:18] can start reading. So it says for as the
[8:22] lightning cometh out of the east and
[8:23] shineth unto the west. So shall also the
[8:27] coming of the son of man be. For
[8:30] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[8:32] the eagle e eagles be gathered. And we
[8:35] know that the carcass by what the
[8:37] prophet said is uh it's a fresh killing
[8:40] which means that it's the it's the word
[8:42] for the day. It's not just any kind of
[8:44] food but it's a fresh food. Right? And
[8:47] then it also says there will the eagles
[8:49] be gathered. So you can't unite
[8:52] believers without the message of the
[8:54] hour and a revelation of the message
[8:56] hour. There's no uniting eagles together
[8:58] under any kind of other circumstance.
[9:01] Right? So verse 29 says, "Immediately
[9:04] after the tribulation of those days
[9:06] shall the sun be darkened and the moon
[9:07] shall not give her light, and the stars
[9:09] shall fall from heaven, and the powers
[9:11] of heaven shall be shaken. And then
[9:13] shall appear the sign of the Son of man
[9:15] in heaven. And then all the tribes of
[9:17] the earth mourn, and they shall see the
[9:19] Son of man coming in the clouds of
[9:21] heaven with power and great glory. And
[9:24] he shall send his angels with a great
[9:25] trumpet sound of a great uh sound of a
[9:28] trumpet and they shall gather together
[9:29] his elect from the four winds from one
[9:32] end of heaven to the other. And we know
[9:35] that when we see this word elect in
[9:37] here, the prophet uh told us that that's
[9:39] not the bride elect, but that's uh
[9:42] that's the Israelites that are coming
[9:43] together because the bride doesn't go
[9:45] through tribulation, right? only the
[9:47] Israelites, the 144,000 and the foolish
[9:51] virgins go through the uh the
[9:52] tribulation because in verse 28 when it
[9:55] referenced this group here as eagles,
[9:57] you know, eagles always fly above a
[10:00] storm. They never go through a storm and
[10:01] they look down on what is going on in
[10:04] the storm, right? So verse 32 says, "Now
[10:09] learn a parable of the fig tree. When
[10:11] his branch is yet tender and put forth
[10:13] leaves, yay know that summer is nigh. So
[10:15] likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
[10:18] things, know that it is near, even at
[10:20] the doors. Verse 42 reads, "Watch
[10:23] therefore, for you know not what hour
[10:25] your Lord doeth come." And then we're
[10:27] going to, and you may be seated now. And
[10:30] we're going to read also from Matthew
[10:31] 25. Uh we're going to read verses uh
[10:35] 1-4.
[10:39] And I'll just start reading. And it
[10:41] says, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven
[10:42] be likened unto 10 virgins which took
[10:45] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[10:46] bridegroom, and five of them were wise,
[10:49] and five were foolish. They that were
[10:51] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[10:53] with them. But the wise took oil in
[10:55] their vessels with their lamps." And
[10:57] then going down to verse 13, it reads,
[10:59] "Watch therefore, for ye know neither
[11:02] the day nor the hour wherein the Son of
[11:04] Man cometh." Amen. So these Bible verses
[11:09] are kind of uh are are Jesus kind of
[11:12] telling the church and the people about
[11:14] watching for events that are supposed to
[11:16] be going on during this day. And a lot
[11:19] of stuff has happened in the world uh uh
[11:22] just in this past year, right? Uh so we
[11:24] it's safe to say for us because we have
[11:26] prophetic in insight that history the
[11:29] history books are almost over.
[11:31] Everything is almost finished. You know,
[11:33] time will soon be no more. And it's a
[11:35] very very exciting time uh in this day
[11:38] and age for people that got oil. And if
[11:41] you don't have oil, it's going to be uh
[11:43] uh it's going to be a real real rough
[11:45] time, right? So we want to make sure
[11:46] that we're uh our lives uh um are
[11:50] trimmed up and ready for his appearance.
[11:53] And so um with it being the end time,
[11:56] you know, I used to run track back in,
[11:58] uh back in, uh high school, and you had
[12:00] these two races. You had one that was
[12:02] called the 4x1. It was a relay race and
[12:05] you know you would have someone run 100
[12:06] meters, another person run 100 meters
[12:08] and it was four people. We would hand
[12:09] the baton off to everybody and um you
[12:14] would run with all your might and give
[12:16] the baton to the next person and then
[12:18] that next person was dependent upon the
[12:20] other person to run with all their might
[12:21] and the next person was depending the
[12:23] person run with all their might until
[12:24] the race was over. And one of the
[12:27] strategies of this race is that you want
[12:30] to have uh the first person that uh that
[12:33] starts it off from the blocks, they got
[12:34] to be a really really good starter. They
[12:37] got to they got to really really really
[12:39] get out there and get that thing out
[12:40] there. And I like to look at Paul as
[12:43] that kind of person that God
[12:45] predestinated because when God when Paul
[12:47] got a hold of this message, I mean the
[12:49] books that he put together in the New
[12:52] Testament, I mean he did something that
[12:54] no other person could do. So God had
[12:57] confidence that when he placed Paul as a
[12:59] firsttime messenger, he would get the
[13:02] things started and started good. Um, and
[13:04] another strategy is that uh that some
[13:07] people do is that you put your fastest
[13:09] person at the last leg because you want
[13:12] to finish the thing out strong. And so
[13:14] in this day and age, God gave us a
[13:16] prophet, right, as the last leg because
[13:19] he needed a strong finish, right? So he
[13:22] had to give him more and more revelation
[13:24] to make sure this thing is uh uh finish
[13:26] is good.
[13:27] And uh the thing about it is that the
[13:30] prophet is physically no longer here. So
[13:32] God's got to trust us to finish this
[13:35] race strong, right?
[13:37] It's a big big responsibility when you
[13:39] realize that God is entrusting his plan
[13:42] in your hands,
[13:43] right? Uh but the beautiful thing about
[13:45] this thing, because it can seem like a
[13:47] big responsibility, is that God could
[13:49] have put us in any age. You could have
[13:51] been born during Moses' age. You could
[13:53] have been born during Noah's age. You
[13:55] could have been born during Jonah's age.
[13:57] You could have been born during uh
[13:59] Paul's age. But God allowed you to be
[14:01] birthed during this time 2025, right?
[14:05] Because he had confidence that you would
[14:07] be able to take his word and finish this
[14:09] uh race out uh uh in a strong fashion.
[14:13] So the inspiration of this message uh
[14:16] came from the prophecy that we all know
[14:18] that is uh pretty well known. It's been
[14:20] the quote has been going around. So
[14:22] we'll just read that uh quickly. It's
[14:24] from Acts of the Holy Spirit 541219
[14:29] paragraph 87.
[14:31] And we all know this, but I'll just kind
[14:32] of read it quickly just to show you
[14:34] where the thought came from. So says, "I
[14:36] believe one of these glorious days when
[14:38] this United Confederation of Church goes
[14:39] together and the new pope is brought out
[14:41] from the United States and put over the
[14:43] air accordingly to prophecy, then
[14:45] they'll form an image like unto the
[14:46] beast. And I tell you, the true church
[14:48] of God will be drove together. The true
[14:50] the real true believers out of
[14:52] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[14:54] Pentecostal, Nazarene, pilgrim,
[14:56] holiness, whatever they they'll be will
[14:58] go together and be cemented by the love
[15:00] of God that'll make the body of the Lord
[15:02] Jesus Christ. All the believers and
[15:05] agnostics and shallow-minded will be
[15:07] cast to one side. They'll go right on
[15:09] into the confederation of the churches.
[15:13] Right? And um when I first read that um
[15:16] the thing that popped out to me, I kind
[15:18] of stand on the lines of how brother
[15:20] George had came down and brother even
[15:22] brother Jack had uh talked about it. The
[15:24] thing that popped out to me was God
[15:25] driving his church together and then God
[15:28] cemented them with love into the body.
[15:30] Uh you know the pope they they have
[15:33] their part to play but that that but we
[15:35] don't want to focus on that part. We
[15:37] want to focus on what God is doing with
[15:38] this real church,
[15:40] right? and and this and in that in that
[15:42] prophecy, God had described two steps of
[15:45] what he was going to do with his church
[15:46] at the end time. One, he's driving his
[15:48] church out of denominations or uh isms.
[15:52] And uh I personally I like to think that
[15:55] you know the prophet said Methodists and
[15:57] Baptists and Nazarines and Pentecostals
[15:59] and all those kind of stuff and whatever
[16:01] it may be. And I believe that God's
[16:03] driving his church out of all forms of
[16:05] isms, right? isms
[16:08] isms were are devices that are designed
[16:11] to keep people divided, right? And you
[16:15] can't form a body while being divided,
[16:17] right? So you have worldlyism, you know,
[16:20] you have uh politics, the politicism
[16:22] world, you have intellectualism, you
[16:25] have spiritualism and ritualism, right?
[16:27] And all these things do is just keep us
[16:30] arguing and divided and amongst one each
[16:32] other. But once God calls us from these
[16:36] things, he can then move on to the next
[16:38] step. Meaning that we have to get rid of
[16:40] all the isms first. You got to you got
[16:42] to take inventory for your own life.
[16:45] You can't be worried about what up
[16:47] what's going on in other people's lives.
[16:48] But you got to make sure that the isms
[16:50] are outside of your life so that when
[16:52] God comes down to drive his church
[16:53] together that you're caught in his hand
[16:55] as well.
[16:56] You can't be busy busy, you know,
[16:58] looking at other people's lives. Well,
[16:59] so and so was doing this and so so and
[17:01] so was doing that. Right? That's a ism
[17:04] in itself because you're trying to cause
[17:05] division, right? So he God, we have to
[17:09] get rid of all of these isms out of our
[17:10] bo out of our um our spirit first so
[17:13] that God can then do the next step which
[17:14] was the the next part which is cement us
[17:17] with love into his body.
[17:20] Right? And I like that word cement
[17:22] because when I was doing a search of the
[17:24] message of this thing uh the prophet had
[17:27] referenced and said that cement is used
[17:29] to set a foundation
[17:31] right
[17:33] meaning that love has got to be the
[17:35] foundation.
[17:36] What whatever you're doing I whatever
[17:39] work you're doing for God whatever
[17:41] you're doing in life your foundation has
[17:43] to come from a place of love. Right? If
[17:46] you're trying to show somebody, you
[17:47] know, the things in the message, you
[17:48] know, a lot of times we try to explain
[17:50] the message to people and all that kind
[17:51] of stuff, but if you're coming from a
[17:53] foundation where you just want to debate
[17:55] and prove people wrong, that's the wrong
[17:58] foundation, right? It has to come from a
[18:01] place of love. If you're looking to
[18:02] correct a brother or a sister, you know,
[18:04] you may see a sister or a brother that
[18:06] isn't isn't dressed right. And if your
[18:09] whole agenda is just to go and try to
[18:12] beat them up with the word, it's the
[18:14] wrong foundation. It reminds me of the
[18:16] the woman that committed adultery.
[18:18] Everybody was ready to stone her
[18:21] and they were standing on the word, but
[18:23] Jesus could pick up the spirit behind
[18:25] what they were trying to do,
[18:27] right? And he was able to come and go
[18:28] and show forgiveness. So you want to
[18:30] make sure that your foundation is coming
[18:32] from a place of love because what
[18:34] happens is if it doesn't come from a
[18:36] place of love, you end up just making
[18:38] the situation a lot worse than what it
[18:41] should have been. So now God has to kind
[18:42] of go through and spend more time
[18:44] resolving it, right? Um so we want to do
[18:48] thing we want to we want to we don't
[18:50] want to go against God's plan especially
[18:52] in this time. We want to be an asset to
[18:54] his plan. We want every everything to
[18:56] come from a place of uh of love and
[18:59] compassion and things like that. Um you
[19:02] know Paul also referenced it in u I
[19:05] believe it was Corinthians where it says
[19:07] if I had the tongue of angels and the
[19:09] faith to move mountains and you had all
[19:11] these gifts but had no charity
[19:14] it doesn't mean anything for you. So we
[19:16] want charity to be our foundation.
[19:18] Right. Yes, sir. Amen.
[19:19] So, we're going to talk about these two
[19:21] things uh that the prophet said that God
[19:23] would do in this last day. And it's just
[19:24] to expound upon uh I guess some of the
[19:28] meaning, the deeper things of this thing
[19:30] because in Matthew 24:25, God gave us a
[19:34] command to watch right during this age.
[19:37] He gave us a command to watch for these
[19:39] things to make sure we know what time it
[19:41] is.
[19:42] And every uh everyone here, everyone
[19:44] here is from South Florida. So if let's
[19:46] say I'm just kind of making this up, you
[19:48] know, uh the Sand Hill crane, everybody
[19:50] in South Florida knows what the Sand
[19:51] Hill crane is. So you know, if I if if
[19:54] if someone from South Florida that kind
[19:56] of knew what was going on, let's say
[19:58] every time the Sand Hill cranes fly up
[20:01] north, that means there's a bad bad
[20:02] hurricane coming, right? And so they
[20:05] know exactly what to watch for. So if
[20:07] someone came down here and they was
[20:09] like, "Why is there what you talking
[20:10] about this sandill crane coming here
[20:12] this going on?" They just ignored what
[20:14] you said. It was like, man, it's sunny
[20:15] outside. Like, ain't nothing going to
[20:17] happen. Right? So, it it goes to show
[20:20] that you have to know what to watch for.
[20:23] You have to be instructed what to watch
[20:25] for or else you get caught into a storm.
[20:28] Right.
[20:29] And so, um, and the thing about it is,
[20:33] you know, we've we've been preaching the
[20:35] coming of the Lord for a very very long
[20:37] time, but now we have the signs that
[20:40] we're getting closer and closer and
[20:42] closer. So, it's, you know, you you
[20:45] really got to start cleaning up your
[20:46] lives now, right? Just to make sure
[20:48] you're prepared and you don't you don't
[20:50] miss this thing, right?
[20:52] Uh and the Bible also said in Revelation
[20:54] that the bride has made herself ready.
[20:59] God didn't have to come down and prepare
[21:01] her and just say, "Hey, put this on and
[21:03] you need to do this and you need to
[21:04] start doing this." No. The Bible said he
[21:06] has so much confidence in this special
[21:08] individual that they can just take the
[21:10] word. they know exactly what to do with
[21:12] it.
[21:14] Right.
[21:14] Amen.
[21:14] So, we're going to read out of the
[21:16] message part in uh preaching 63 and
[21:19] we're going to read a couple uh few
[21:21] paragraphs there to kind of see how um
[21:24] brother brother Brandham illuminates on
[21:26] what we just talked about. It says,
[21:28] "Now, let's just ask oursel the
[21:30] question. Isn't that something like
[21:31] today? As bad as we hate to say it,
[21:34] we've got to face facts somewhere. There
[21:35] is something wrong." And this was
[21:37] preached in ' 63. He says, 'Why, this
[21:40] church ought to be a million miles up
[21:42] the road to where it is now. Jesus is
[21:44] waiting on his church to get ready. His
[21:46] bride has made herself ready. We got the
[21:48] potentials. The Holy Spirit is here. God
[21:51] is here. The power to heal the sick, the
[21:53] power to do all the things that Christ
[21:55] did. I've seen it demonstrated myself by
[21:57] the Holy Spirit. So, the potentials are
[21:59] here. What God is waiting for us to get
[22:01] away from is our traditions and come
[22:04] back under the blood of his son Jesus
[22:06] Christ to become the church of the
[22:07] living God. Methodist, Baptist,
[22:09] Lutheran, Presbyterian, whatever more
[22:12] whosoever will come and take of the
[22:14] waters uh of the waters of life freely.
[22:16] I believe that with all I believe all
[22:18] that is in me. We God has set down the
[22:21] Holy Spirit to do that. But we with our
[22:23] rituals without sincerity we're going
[22:26] it's it's it's our tradition and become
[22:28] it's original. We go without sincerity
[22:30] without really sorrowful sin. Right? So
[22:34] God is saying, so I mean the prophet is
[22:36] saying that you don't want to be caught
[22:39] in a a time where you know you're not
[22:42] focused and really and really driven by
[22:45] the Holy Spirit to prepare yourself
[22:47] because at any moment he could come and
[22:49] if you're not ready you know uh at that
[22:52] time God there's no backup plan right
[22:56] there's no backup plan there's no
[22:58] overtime you know in some games you have
[23:00] overtime but there's no overtime when
[23:02] this things comes and you will miss it.
[23:04] It's one thing that God don't play
[23:06] about. God don't play about his word. So
[23:08] when he says something and he sets a
[23:09] date, that's it. It doesn't Your
[23:12] emotions don't matter, your tears don't
[23:14] matter. If God sets a date, you have to
[23:16] get yourself ready in order for him to
[23:18] come and fulfill that word.
[23:20] So the bride has made herself ready,
[23:22] right? And the bride is uh getting
[23:23] herself ready. And I I'll say this, as
[23:26] the bride is is as you're getting
[23:28] yourself ready, you'll see God will
[23:31] bring that church together, right?
[23:32] you'll see God come and fulfill his part
[23:34] of that thing. And the thing I like
[23:36] about um the bride has prepared herself.
[23:39] I like that because this is in reference
[23:41] to the wise version that has oil, right?
[23:44] Which means that she has God's spirit,
[23:46] but she also the prophet had referred to
[23:48] it as wine stimulation, which causes you
[23:51] to do something about it, right? So,
[23:53] you're not just uh coming to church and
[23:55] playing church. You're not just going to
[23:56] your job, this plane job. you're doing
[23:58] something about this thing to make sure
[24:00] that you are ready for his coming.
[24:02] Right?
[24:04] So, the first thing we're going to talk
[24:06] about uh is God driving this church
[24:08] together, right? The true church. And in
[24:10] order to talk about God's church, we
[24:12] have to recognize all the groups that
[24:14] will be identified at the end time,
[24:17] right? And there's various groups that
[24:18] will be identified at the end time. And
[24:20] brother Brandham had talked about some
[24:22] of those in that quote we saw. And so
[24:24] within the believers, and I say
[24:26] believers loosely because we'll as we
[24:29] begin to talk about this, we'll see why
[24:31] I say believers loosely loosely. You
[24:33] have the wise virgins, you have the
[24:36] foolish virgins, and you have the
[24:38] 144,000 Israelites, right? And the
[24:41] reason why I say loosely is because
[24:42] brother Brandon referenced the the
[24:44] foolish virgins as they were believers
[24:47] and but they were professors
[24:49] but they didn't actually have everything
[24:51] that they were professing
[24:53] right and the Bible called them virgins
[24:55] which means that they didn't partake
[24:57] upon themselves with the world
[24:59] right so um and then you also have of
[25:01] course 144,000 which are the Israelites
[25:04] um and so that that kind of references
[25:07] the believer believers and they're all
[25:09] saved But salvation looks different for
[25:11] each one of them.
[25:13] Right? Salvation looks a little bit
[25:15] different from each one of these groups.
[25:17] Right? Next, you have the makeelievers
[25:20] or the denominational harlot. And those
[25:22] are the ones that are going to go into
[25:24] uh the system of the pope. And finally,
[25:26] you have the unbelievers. And even
[25:28] brother Brandham said the agnostics will
[25:29] go into that system of the pope. So,
[25:31] it's like it you can say you don't
[25:33] believe God, but you going to believe
[25:34] some God.
[25:36] There's no such thing as not believing.
[25:38] you'll be forced uh uh into either uh
[25:41] system, right?
[25:43] And so the first thing we want to do
[25:45] though uh since we're talking about the
[25:47] true church of God, we want to identify
[25:49] the characteristics of the true church,
[25:52] right? And the true church of God are
[25:54] the individuals that can understand and
[25:57] believe the fullness of the word for
[25:59] their day. Right? these individuals have
[26:01] been predestinated and they're being led
[26:04] by a prophet at the prophet messenger at
[26:07] this end time. Right? So, and it's um so
[26:11] salvation is for everybody, right?
[26:14] Salvation is for everybody. And it's
[26:16] it's it's an important thing to
[26:17] understand that, right? But as I said
[26:19] before, salvation looks different for
[26:21] each of these groups,
[26:22] right? So to see the message, that's
[26:25] something that God has to do for you
[26:28] personally,
[26:29] right? It's not something that you
[26:31] choose to do. God has to do this thing
[26:34] personally for you, right? Uh the the
[26:38] prophet said that um because we're
[26:40] Gentiles and the prophet said that God
[26:42] deals with Israel as a group. Uh and uh
[26:45] that's why when the messengers go to
[26:47] them or when you see about Israel
[26:49] mentioned in the Bible, they're
[26:50] mentioned as the 144,000, right? It's a
[26:53] group of people. But even though the
[26:55] gentile bride is mentioned as a group of
[26:58] bride, the fact that there's the word
[27:01] bride, it signifies that there's
[27:03] something intimate between God and each
[27:05] one of these individuals.
[27:07] Right? This is something that the
[27:09] Israelites will not have.
[27:11] Right? So it it just shows the the the
[27:15] special place in God's heart that these
[27:17] individuals have. Right? So there's not
[27:21] enough I want to say that there's not
[27:22] enough intellect and explaining about
[27:25] the message that can make somebody a
[27:28] message believer,
[27:29] right? You you can explain it. I mean,
[27:32] you can just dot it up to a tea, that
[27:34] won't do it, right? uh you can uh
[27:37] there's people that can uh you know it
[27:39] it's uh that people can have an
[27:41] infatuation with the message and brother
[27:43] Brandham and from like a historical fact
[27:46] standpoint but that doesn't do it right.
[27:49] That is not enough to do it. God has to
[27:52] personally reveal the word to you.
[27:55] Right?
[27:56] We're not message believers because
[27:58] we're family and friends and we and we
[28:00] fellowship in the same church. We're
[28:02] message believers by the grace of God.
[28:05] It really is grace.
[28:08] Uh and and what that means is that it
[28:10] has to be God's desire for you to
[28:13] believe.
[28:14] That's why the Bible said he is the
[28:16] author and finisher of our faith. Yes,
[28:19] sir.
[28:19] Right? So, it's not you authoring your
[28:21] faith, but it's God saying, "Hey, I want
[28:24] you to believe such and such a thing. I
[28:26] want you to believe such and such a
[28:27] thing." And we'll get about that a
[28:28] little bit into that uh later on. or
[28:31] where you'll have certain individuals,
[28:34] and I may be getting ahead of myself,
[28:35] but uh you'll have certain individuals
[28:38] that will struggle to believe and God
[28:40] don't do nothing with them. But then you
[28:42] got Thomas the doubter and God said, "I
[28:45] ain't believing until I touch the holes
[28:47] in your wrist." And God and Jesus said,
[28:49] "Hey, come on right and do it." God
[28:52] wants specific people to believe the
[28:54] word, not just anyone to believe the
[28:56] word, right? And that's why it's grace
[28:59] that we can see what we can see, right?
[29:01] Uh so there's no point in arguing and
[29:04] debating about it.
[29:06] It it all it does is just cause
[29:08] animosity, right? And and and strife and
[29:11] stuff like that. I remember I was
[29:13] talking to someone about the truth of
[29:14] what happened in the garden. And I I
[29:16] began to expound upon, you know, well,
[29:18] what really happened in the garden was
[29:20] this, this, this, and that. And then the
[29:22] individual that had hit me back was
[29:23] like, "No, what happened was, you know,
[29:25] Adam failed his responsibility to his
[29:27] wife." And I could feel the tension be
[29:29] building up. So I decided just to let me
[29:31] just not say nothing. Just just let it
[29:34] go. You don't want to You don't want
[29:35] them to say something bad about it, you
[29:38] know, because it's been revealed to you.
[29:39] So you just let that thing go, man. And
[29:42] and that's love, right? You ain't trying
[29:44] to uh force people to believe stuff,
[29:47] right? Because the thing about it is God
[29:48] ain't force you to believe this thing.
[29:50] Amen. Amen.
[29:51] God did not force you to believe it. You
[29:53] just saw it, right? And so, um, so we
[29:58] have to learn to allow things to fall in
[30:01] their right place.
[30:02] Do you see what I'm saying? We got to
[30:03] allow situations, uh, to fall in their
[30:06] right place. You know, I think about um,
[30:09] Abraham. When God called Abraham, one of
[30:12] the first things he did was bring Lot.
[30:14] And it's like, no, Abraham, God called
[30:17] you. God did not call a lot, right? And
[30:20] what and we see u that sometimes when um
[30:25] when you try to force situations, it
[30:28] ends up creating problems for you down
[30:30] the long run, right? And we see as in
[30:32] the story of Lot that they began to I
[30:35] think his herdsmen, they began to fight.
[30:37] They began to have strife, right? And
[30:39] the thing about it was that was
[30:41] Abraham's promise, not Lot's promise. So
[30:44] a lot of times, you know, you have to be
[30:46] careful when God reveals things to you
[30:49] and not to somebody else, right? So God
[30:52] may give you uh an idea for a business.
[30:55] Let's say, you know, he gives you an
[30:57] idea for some kind of financial loan
[30:59] service business or whatever, and you go
[31:01] there and you tell someone like, "Yeah,
[31:03] you know, God, I I believe God gave me a
[31:05] vision to start my own business and
[31:07] this, this, and that." And they're like,
[31:08] "Well, you know, with the interest rates
[31:09] what they are right now, that ain't
[31:11] going to work out."
[31:13] and all of a sudden you're like, "Man,
[31:15] now you're starting to doubt what God
[31:17] told you."
[31:19] But God ain't revealed that to them.
[31:22] So, you can't get upset with them.
[31:24] They just don't know. God didn't tell
[31:26] them.
[31:27] So, you can't be upset. So, you got to
[31:29] learn that when God, and I love this
[31:31] thing that the prophet said, um,
[31:33] sometimes when God speaks to you, it is
[31:36] an, like I said, as a bride, it is God
[31:39] revealing things to you, not to someone
[31:41] else. So a lot of times when God tells
[31:43] us things and we want to go and share
[31:45] with everyone else and they don't
[31:46] understand and it's like well yeah that
[31:49] was for you that wasn't for them.
[31:52] So we got to learn to know when God's
[31:55] just trying to have grace and come down
[31:58] and just have a individual walk with you
[32:00] as he promised that he would do in this
[32:03] last day.
[32:04] Amen.
[32:04] He doesn't deal with us as Israelites.
[32:06] We don't get a group revelation.
[32:08] We get individual revelation.
[32:10] That's the truth. Right. And so if I
[32:12] could if I could also kind of type it uh
[32:14] to this um and the reason why we can
[32:17] kind of create problems in the long run.
[32:19] Let's say you have a woman and let's say
[32:20] she um let's say she's got a she got a
[32:23] big foot. She's this size 11. Right?
[32:26] Size 11 foot or whatever. And you try to
[32:30] put her in a size eight shoe. Right now
[32:34] at first it'll look all right, you know,
[32:36] because she's just trying to hold on to
[32:37] the pain. But after a while, you know,
[32:39] she'll start to walk a little bit funny,
[32:41] right? She's going to start to walk a
[32:43] little bit funny. And in that funny
[32:46] walk, you know, there's a type there
[32:48] spiritually because the funny walk in
[32:50] the message can manifest itself as well
[32:53] in different ways.
[32:55] So, one of the things is that you'll see
[32:57] people when they hit when they receive
[32:58] the message, they'll try to take some
[33:01] things away from the message to make it
[33:02] a little bit more digestible.
[33:05] Mhm.
[33:05] And so then they start to look funny and
[33:07] you're like, "Here you are. You're
[33:09] reading the message. You're like, whoa,
[33:10] okay, that person believes that. That's
[33:13] very interesting." And then on the other
[33:15] side, you have people that will try to
[33:17] add things to the message or add things
[33:20] to what the prophet said to make them
[33:22] seem more spiritual
[33:24] or ritualism. And to the real believer,
[33:27] it looks funny,
[33:28] right? And but uh we thank God for his
[33:33] grace because when you're the right
[33:34] vessel, you can just take the word as it
[33:37] is, right? It's easy for you to just
[33:39] digest the word uh as it is. And then
[33:42] God shows you then God backs you up with
[33:45] the signs and the wonders and all the
[33:46] promises and it looks like something
[33:49] that is uh uh um uh normal or balanced.
[33:53] See, that's the problem that Peter had
[33:55] when Jesus was trying to go and wash his
[33:58] feet, which is why he needed a
[33:59] conversion because, you know, Jesus came
[34:02] and wanted to wash his feet and Peter's
[34:03] like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't
[34:05] don't wash my feet, Lord." And Jesus
[34:07] said, "If I don't wash your feet, you
[34:08] you don't have no place in me." Well,
[34:10] said, "Well, not just my feet. Well,
[34:11] then just wash all of them." He's like,
[34:12] "No, no, no. I just need to do your
[34:15] feet." Right? So, a believers, all they
[34:18] need is just the word. You can't go
[34:20] above it. You can't go below it. Right.
[34:24] Uh and so that's why we have to be
[34:26] careful uh within the message and when
[34:29] you interact with different people in
[34:30] the message and stuff like that and you
[34:33] begin to form relationships. That's
[34:34] where the problem comes. The problem
[34:37] comes is when we're in a uniting time
[34:39] right now and the uniting time is
[34:42] becoming more contrast than it ever has
[34:45] been before. Now before you could be a
[34:47] generally a good person. you know, they
[34:49] had nuclear families back in the 1930s
[34:52] and people took care of their kids, but
[34:54] we're starting to see a a stark contrast
[34:56] between these things. And so, it's uh
[34:59] it's definitely uh a uniting time, but
[35:02] we can't be united by our feelings for
[35:04] each other.
[35:05] We can't I can't be united because, you
[35:07] know, me and this brother, we enjoy the
[35:09] same things. You know, we both play
[35:10] basketball or we both we have to be
[35:12] united by the word and the word alone is
[35:15] the only thing that can keep people
[35:17] together. Right? The word alone is the
[35:19] only thing that can keep the people
[35:20] together. You can't be united under a
[35:22] skin color.
[35:25] You know, a lot of people, you know, you
[35:26] go to churches and they only allow uh
[35:28] one skin color, right? Or or some
[35:31] churches, you know, they only allow a
[35:33] certain type of people. Like if you yell
[35:35] a lot, you know, they don't want you in
[35:36] their church, right?
[35:38] Or if you don't make enough noise, they
[35:39] don't want you in the church. And it's
[35:41] like, but God don't unite by those
[35:43] things. God unites by his love, right?
[35:47] which is belief and of the fullness of
[35:49] the word,
[35:50] right?
[35:51] So, um God is going to drive his church
[35:54] together, right? And it has to be God
[35:56] that does the driving. So, we're going
[35:57] to read a couple. We're going to read
[35:59] some uh Bible verses uh just to kind of
[36:02] cement this thing. Um and we're going to
[36:05] do our first Bible reading from Genesis
[36:08] 16. And we're going to read verses uh
[36:10] 6-1. So, it's going to be a lot of Bible
[36:12] reading, but I'm going to uh hopefully
[36:14] by the uh by the grace of God, we're
[36:16] going to tie this thing together just so
[36:17] we can um understand it. So, it reads
[36:21] here, "But Abram said unto Sarah,
[36:23] behold, thy thy maid is in thy hand. Do
[36:26] to her as it pleasth." This is after
[36:28] Abraham Sarah wanted Abraham to have a a
[36:32] child with Hagar. And when Sarah dealt
[36:35] hardly with her, she fled from her face.
[36:36] And the angel of the Lord found her by a
[36:38] water of by a fountain of water in the
[36:40] wilderness, by the fountain in the way
[36:42] of Shure. And he said, "Hagar, Sarah's
[36:44] maid, whence comest thou? And whether
[36:47] wilt thou go?" And she said, "I flee
[36:49] from the face of my mistress Sarah." And
[36:50] the angel of the Lord said unto her,
[36:52] "Return to thy mistress, and submit
[36:54] thyself under her hands." And this is
[36:56] the the verse we want to we want to key
[36:58] in. And the angel Lord said unto her, I
[37:00] will multiply thy seed exceedingly that
[37:02] it shall not be numbered for for a
[37:05] multitude. So here we see God given uh
[37:09] this promise to her child that looks
[37:11] very similar to the promise that God is
[37:14] giving um Abraham, right? And the angel
[37:17] of the Lord said unto her, "Behold, thou
[37:19] art with child and shall bear a son, and
[37:21] shall call his name Ishmael, because the
[37:23] Lord hath heard thy affliction." Right?
[37:26] Um, and now we're going to go to Genesis
[37:29] 17 and read verses 17 through uh, 23.
[37:33] Um, try to go through it quickly. Then
[37:35] Abraham fell upon his face and laughed
[37:38] and said in his heart, "Shall a child be
[37:39] born unto him that is 100 years old, and
[37:42] shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear."
[37:46] Uh, and Abraham said unto God, "Oh, that
[37:48] Ishmael might live before thee." And God
[37:50] said, "Sarah, thy wife shall bear thee a
[37:52] son indeed, and thou shalt call uh his
[37:54] name Isaac, and I will establish my
[37:56] covenant with him for an everlasting
[37:57] covenant, and with his seed after him.
[38:00] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee,
[38:02] behold, I will I have blessed him, and
[38:04] will make him fruitful, and will
[38:05] multiply him exceedingly. 12 princes
[38:07] shall he begget, and I will make him a
[38:10] great nation. But my covenant will I
[38:11] establish with Isaac, which shares I
[38:14] bear unto thee at this time in the next
[38:16] year." and uh and he left off talking
[38:18] with God and God went up from him and
[38:20] Abraham took Ishmael's son and all that
[38:21] were born in his house and all that were
[38:23] bought with his money every male among
[38:25] the men of Abraham's house and
[38:27] circumcise the flesh of their foreskins
[38:28] in the same day as God has said unto
[38:30] them. So here we see God
[38:34] uh divvying out his will uh and purpose
[38:37] to these two different seeds. You have
[38:39] Isaac and then you have Ishmael. And the
[38:42] promises almost look pretty similar uh
[38:45] because it it even said from Ishmael
[38:48] that 12 princes shall he sh sh sh sh sh
[38:50] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[38:50] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh
[38:50] sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh sh shall he
[38:51] begget. And we all know that when Isaac
[38:53] uh um gave birth to Jacob, he also gave
[38:57] birth to 12 kids.
[38:58] Right? So these themes look very very
[39:00] very very similar, but the difference
[39:03] was there was a covenant that was with
[39:06] Isaac.
[39:07] Right? So, in this last day, uh, as
[39:10] we're as we're looking at these
[39:12] different groups and we're looking for
[39:13] the identification of the true church,
[39:15] we want to make sure that what we
[39:18] believe, the word that we have is a
[39:20] covenant behind that thing, right?
[39:22] Not just blessings. We don't want just
[39:24] blessings.
[39:25] Ishmael was blessed.
[39:27] No doubt.
[39:28] Ishmael, his name meant um the Bible
[39:31] here said Ishmael, his name meant
[39:32] because the Lord have heard thy
[39:34] affliction. We don't want God just to
[39:35] answer our prayers. All right.
[39:37] We don't want God just to heal our
[39:39] bodies,
[39:40] right? And just bless us and rich and we
[39:42] not have the fullness of the word,
[39:45] right?
[39:46] That's how you miss a rapture.
[39:48] Yes, sir.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:50] So, we're going to read Genesis 21 uh 4
[39:55] uh 4-10
[39:58] um and then 14.
[40:02] Um, and it reads, "And Abraham
[40:04] circumcised his son Isaac, being 8 days
[40:06] of day 8 days old, as God had commanded
[40:09] him. And Abraham was a hundred years old
[40:12] when his son Isaac was born into him."
[40:14] And Sarah said, "God hath made me to
[40:16] laugh so that all that hear will laugh
[40:18] with me?" And she said, "Who who would
[40:21] have said unto Abraham that Sarah should
[40:23] have given children suck? For I've borne
[40:26] him a son in his old age?" And the child
[40:28] grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a
[40:31] great feast the same day that Isaac was
[40:33] weaned. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar
[40:37] the Egyptian. We want to key in on this
[40:39] verse. Which she had born unto Abraham
[40:41] mocking. Wherefore she said unto
[40:44] Abraham, cast out this bondswoman and
[40:46] her son, for the son of this bondswoman
[40:48] shall not be heir with my son, even with
[40:52] Isaac. Right? So here we have this
[40:54] scenario where we begin to see this um
[41:00] this distinction between the two seed
[41:02] lines and that they don't agree with
[41:04] everything right and there's favor given
[41:06] to one and there's favor given to uh uh
[41:09] there's favor that's not given as much
[41:10] to another one and Paul further explains
[41:14] this in the book of Galatians where he
[41:16] says that it he typed it from the
[41:19] natural son to the spiritual son how the
[41:21] natural son would perscute ute the
[41:24] spiritual son, right? So, you know, it's
[41:29] just because people cannot see the
[41:31] message and and you don't want to you
[41:34] don't want to force people to see the
[41:35] message because you don't want to create
[41:37] an enemy, right? That's going to
[41:38] eventually come back on you, right? As
[41:41] God is giving you the word. That's why
[41:42] one of the things that I do uh I don't I
[41:46] don't try to convert people to the
[41:48] message. I'll give you Jesus and
[41:49] salvation all day, right? And then as
[41:52] God leads me to say certain things, then
[41:54] I'll just start throwing nuggets out.
[41:56] But I'm not here to try to make message
[41:58] believers.
[41:59] That's in God's hands. Right now, I'll
[42:02] say I I'll speak salvation in Jesus
[42:04] Christ. I'll preach that to every single
[42:06] soul in the world because God wants to
[42:07] save you. But the message is uh is a
[42:10] unique thing, right? There's something
[42:12] special about that thing. And you don't
[42:14] want anyone just to have a message.
[42:16] That's why you got to be careful about,
[42:18] you know, when people, new people come
[42:20] into church, you know, and it's like,
[42:22] well, how how'd you get to the message,
[42:24] you know, it's like, how did you know
[42:26] about the message? What's your
[42:27] revelation? Well, you know, I was born
[42:28] to so and so, this famous preacher and
[42:30] this and that. That ain't going to do
[42:31] it. right
[42:33] there there there there have been there
[42:35] and I don't and I I don't want to say
[42:37] any names but there's a lot of
[42:39] situations where we see these different
[42:41] dynamics and we see people believe in
[42:44] different stuff that doesn't line up
[42:46] fully with the word
[42:47] right and I'm not here to judge anyone
[42:49] because I stand like Joseph I'm I don't
[42:51] take the place of God I can't speak for
[42:53] anybody all I can do is just preach the
[42:55] word and observe the spirits that I see
[42:58] right
[42:59] so we're going to kind of go through
[43:01] this thing because we can gle and uh in
[43:03] fact we're actually going to go to this
[43:05] message uh the seed shall not be heir
[43:06] with the shuck preached in 650429
[43:10] and we're going to read a couple of
[43:11] these paragraphs just to kind of see
[43:13] what the prophet had said about this
[43:15] situation and what he types it to says
[43:18] here now Ishmael could not be heir with
[43:21] Isaac because one was slightly doubted
[43:23] just slightly doubted it was a child it
[43:25] was still the seed of Abraham but not
[43:26] God's perfect way forward Ishmael now I
[43:29] could spend much time here but I'm
[43:30] hoping the Holy Spirit will convey this
[43:32] to you in a real way that it should be.
[43:34] Now, if they if Ishmael and Isaac could
[43:36] not be heir together because the
[43:38] original plan of God was substituted in
[43:39] a per into a permissive plan of God, a
[43:42] permissive way that God did bless,
[43:44] neither can the spiritual church today
[43:47] be heir with the denominational,
[43:50] the denominationals. God blessed them
[43:52] like he did Ishmamail, but the spiritual
[43:54] will not be heir with the others. That's
[43:56] right. There will be coming out of the
[43:58] church denomination, church so-called
[44:01] church natural, will come a bride of
[44:04] Christ the elected. Now there what
[44:06] troubles me this hour is knowing that we
[44:08] we see all these denominations pulling
[44:10] into this what we know to be the what
[44:12] you call the latter reign or the pouring
[44:14] out of the spirit. Did you realize that
[44:17] uh Jesus said that when that come to
[44:19] pass it would be the end when the
[44:21] foolish virgin and the wise virgin was
[44:24] not heirs together? For when the foolish
[44:26] virgin when she was a virgin uh she was
[44:28] a virgin just lacking oil but when she
[44:31] come to buy it was at the time that the
[44:33] bridegroom come and she was left out
[44:35] while she was trying to buy oil. You
[44:37] understand? I want that to soak in real
[44:40] good. Now surely I won't have to move
[44:42] that subject any further. Neither can
[44:43] the spiritual and the natural bees heirs
[44:46] together. Meaning that you ain't going
[44:48] in no rapture with any ism. uh any kind
[44:51] of ism that you got on the inside of
[44:53] you, if God don't deliver that, deliver
[44:55] you from that at the time of his coming,
[44:57] you cannot make a rapture, right? The
[45:00] spiritual cannot be heir with the
[45:01] natural, the natural mind, right? And he
[45:04] and he uh and he says in verse um
[45:08] 48 I mean 47. That's why the rapture,
[45:11] the bride, the wise virgin, the called
[45:13] out, the for ordained, the elected.
[45:15] While you businessmen wouldn't run your
[45:17] office like some people try to think
[45:18] that God runs his program haphazard. God
[45:21] knew before the foundation of the world
[45:23] who would be saved and who would not be
[45:24] saved by predestination, by fornowledge.
[45:27] He saw every member put every name on
[45:29] the lamb's book of life before the
[45:30] church ever began. Jesus come to seek
[45:32] and save that which was on the book. He
[45:35] bought the book of redemption. It was
[45:36] lost and he redeemed us. And all the
[45:38] names that was on the book was redeemed
[45:39] when he redeemed us. Then, as I said
[45:42] many times, you recognize that that's
[45:44] why you're here this morning, right? So,
[45:46] that's why you believe a message. It
[45:47] ain't nothing but the grace of God. It's
[45:49] not because you tried to figure it out
[45:51] yourself. It's not because of how many
[45:53] message books you've read. I've heard
[45:55] that one a lot. You know, people reading
[45:56] lots and lots of message book that don't
[45:58] give you revelation, right? Uh it's not
[46:01] how many quotes you know or how many
[46:02] quotes you've memorized or you know how
[46:04] many camps you've been to or how many uh
[46:07] days you spent in a message church.
[46:09] These things don't provide revelation.
[46:12] Right? But he says that's why you're
[46:15] here this morning. Why you're coming up
[46:16] out all of these organizations and
[46:18] things organizations and things you're
[46:20] there is something pulling you as my
[46:22] little thought was about the eagle
[46:24] hatched under the hen. See you you
[46:26] realize there is something different.
[46:28] The church didn't have a satisfying
[46:29] something, but you heard something else
[46:31] that was a scream. You realize that that
[46:34] you were born for that. You're a part of
[46:36] it. You fit into it like a glove on a
[46:38] hand. That's why we're assembled here
[46:40] together this morning is because as my
[46:42] old southern mama used to say, birds of
[46:44] a feather flock together because you
[46:46] have these they have things in common,
[46:49] right? So that's why we're assembled
[46:51] here today is because of the message.
[46:53] It's not because of some kind of other
[46:56] ism or or it's not even by your own
[46:59] desire. Like you it's like it's if like
[47:03] a type to the natural, you know, you
[47:06] can't you can't decide what kind of
[47:08] brother or sister you going to have.
[47:11] You can't decide what their
[47:12] characteristics are going to be. You
[47:13] can't decide what they going to look
[47:15] like. You can't decide what they going
[47:16] to act like. But you just have to accept
[47:18] that that's your brother or your sister.
[47:21] Right? And the same way as it is with
[47:23] God, we can't decide who's in God's
[47:25] family, who's not in God's family. Just
[47:28] as God brings and predestinates and
[47:30] baptize individuals with the Holy Ghost,
[47:33] we just got to take them as is as a
[47:35] brother or a sister.
[47:36] Right? That's grace. That's God working
[47:40] uh his plan, right? And in uh paragraph
[47:43] 49, it reads, "Buzzards and doves have
[47:45] nothing in common. Their diet is
[47:47] different. Although a dove could be
[47:49] hatched under a buzzard." That's right.
[47:51] Depend on what it was to begin with.
[47:53] Now, and in that though, the dove might
[47:55] have to be motherthered a while by that
[47:57] by that by the buzzard. But, uh,
[48:00] finally, uh, he'll find his mate. Uh,
[48:04] meaning that you can be in denomination.
[48:06] You might be in denomination for a long
[48:08] long long long long time. You might be
[48:10] in certain isms for a long long long
[48:12] time, but eventually your nature is
[48:14] going to take over.
[48:16] Right? And that's why, you know, I and
[48:18] that's why it's one of the things I love
[48:20] about God because, you know, God is not
[48:23] a slave taskmaster.
[48:25] He don't do things like that. And I like
[48:27] to think about the story of Noah, how,
[48:29] you know, Noah had the dove and the crow
[48:32] and they was cooped up in the ark. And,
[48:34] you know, God don't want to see God
[48:37] doesn't God doesn't want you to serve
[48:38] him out of, you know, obligation or
[48:42] tradition. He doesn't want you to wear
[48:44] skirts because you know this is the
[48:46] right thing to do, right? He wants you
[48:48] to do it because you love his word,
[48:50] right? Because you have a relationship
[48:51] with him and these things have been
[48:52] revealed. And so that's why you have to
[48:54] know sometimes you got to be careful
[48:56] because a lot of times we point fingers
[48:58] and people may have backslide and but
[49:00] the prophet told us that backslide
[49:02] doesn't mean somebody is just lost and
[49:04] plum fell off.
[49:05] So I like to think of the story of Noah
[49:07] how he opened up that window and he
[49:10] said, "Hey doves and crows, y'all can
[49:12] go." Right? And so them dove and the
[49:14] crow, they flew out a finally out of the
[49:16] ark. Right? They finally got their
[49:17] freedom. So the dove and the crow, you
[49:19] know, they flew to one island and they
[49:22] nestled down there. And then the crow
[49:23] said, "Hey man, this is some good stuff
[49:25] here. Eating some there's some good food
[49:27] over here." And so the dove came over
[49:28] there, man, started eating and the crow
[49:31] was just slopping it up and the dove was
[49:33] like, "Hold on a second. It tastes real
[49:35] good, but when it hit down, it was like,
[49:39] so we tried to fake it and said, "Oh,
[49:40] this is this is all right, I guess." And
[49:43] so then they got up and flew more. It
[49:45] was free, right? And then they went to
[49:46] another island and they got down there
[49:48] and the crow was started eating some
[49:50] muck and said, "Hey, man, this stuff is
[49:52] delicious." The dove came and uh that
[49:55] little dove came over there, start
[49:56] eating and says, "You know what? I can't
[49:58] take this no more. I need to go back.
[50:01] I need to go back." So God don't got to
[50:03] force no one to be in the message.
[50:06] What God deposited in you before the
[50:09] foundation of the world will make its
[50:11] way back to him.
[50:13] That's why it's it's a beautiful thing
[50:15] to be a part of this message because you
[50:18] don't have to fear being lost. What does
[50:20] that what does that have to do with
[50:22] God's elect? Right? You were born with
[50:25] the very nature of God on the inside of
[50:27] you, which means you have to see what he
[50:30] sees.
[50:30] Right? Um I know um sometimes you know
[50:34] kids you know they try to you know they
[50:35] try to go out in life when they get on
[50:37] their own and try to do their own thing
[50:38] and you know I'm never going to be like
[50:40] my parent man I tell there are things I
[50:43] see about my parents now that I that now
[50:45] that I'm older and it's because I came
[50:47] from them. You can't run away from that
[50:49] thing. Right? That's how it is with a
[50:51] real believer. When God predestinated
[50:53] you he put in he the insurance that he
[50:56] put inside of you was his own nature
[50:58] inside of you. That's why when you go
[51:00] into different isms, denominationalism
[51:02] or intellectualism or you might even be
[51:05] an unbeliever in worldlyism, at some
[51:07] point that nature, God has so much
[51:10] confidence not in your reasoning or your
[51:12] life choices, but God has so much
[51:14] confidence in what he spoke about you
[51:16] that it will bring forth the fruit that
[51:18] he said it would do.
[51:20] Right? That's what we have confidence
[51:22] in. That's what we're trusting in.
[51:24] That's why we're not trying to we're not
[51:25] trying to do anything about it because
[51:27] God's got it under control. All right.
[51:29] So, I like how, you know, um this um
[51:34] this typing of of Isaac, you know, cuz
[51:37] the Bible says when Ishmael did this
[51:39] mocking, and I looked up a lot of
[51:41] different translations uh because
[51:43] there's a lot of translations about it
[51:44] about, you know, what that meant by
[51:46] mocking. And the only thing that I could
[51:48] really type it to was in Galatians when
[51:51] uh Paul had said that the natural would
[51:54] persecute the uh the spiritual. You
[51:57] know, there there must have been
[51:59] something about Ishmamail that was kind
[52:01] of off, right? Growing up in a household
[52:04] with Isaac, right? You know, and that's
[52:07] usually how it is when, you know, uh,
[52:10] let's say, for example, you know, if
[52:12] someone were to come to Spirit and Truth
[52:14] and and sing like a country song. Now,
[52:16] we we'll we'll sing any song, right?
[52:18] We'll sing any song, but that's not how
[52:21] we do things. So, it's kind of like, you
[52:22] know, you getting in the spirit and
[52:24] stuff like that, but in the back of your
[52:25] head, it's like, you know, we sing the
[52:27] song that way.
[52:30] That's the way we sing the song. He
[52:32] ain't trying to be mean or nothing, but
[52:33] it's just the it's just the nature of
[52:35] the church.
[52:36] So, there must have been some things in
[52:38] Ishmael's nature and Sarah looking at
[52:40] Isaac that them things was different.
[52:43] You see what I'm saying? Those things
[52:44] were different. And uh so, when it says
[52:46] here that uh Ishma did this mocking and
[52:48] I kind of looked it up and I kind of I
[52:51] fall onto the realm of what um of what
[52:54] Paul said uh how it was a persecution
[52:56] against Isaac. Um, now Ishmael was a
[53:00] child and didn't know what he was doing.
[53:02] So, he was just an innocent child. But,
[53:04] you know, when you look at the type
[53:07] today as far as the spiritual and the
[53:09] denominational, when you tell some
[53:11] people about the message,
[53:13] you know, they don't really understand
[53:15] it. And so, one of the things they do is
[53:17] they mock you,
[53:18] right? And it's just that same exact
[53:21] spirit that was on uh uh Ishma, right?
[53:25] And um I can say this way um cuz
[53:28] everybody remembers the there's a there
[53:30] was a sister that I invited to um well a
[53:33] friend a work co-orker that I invited to
[53:35] church a while back ago and you know she
[53:38] came and I and I told her to I invited
[53:40] her to my to our church because you know
[53:42] I was talking about a church and she was
[53:44] saying well what church you go to might
[53:45] come and see you and I know she was
[53:46] coming that Wednesday and that Wednesday
[53:48] I was actually teaching and you know so
[53:51] it's like you know you teaching some
[53:52] things you don't know how people going
[53:53] to receive it or not. So, it's like,
[53:54] man, I don't know what she gonna say.
[53:56] So, um after a while, you know, it it
[54:00] started she was real nice to me. So, and
[54:02] and that thing kind of caught me because
[54:04] I'm like, if you can hear this, cuz what
[54:07] people don't realize this message is
[54:08] very rich,
[54:10] right? Not a lot of people can digest
[54:12] this thing when you hear some of the
[54:13] stuff that's said, right? And so she was
[54:16] just very kind to me and I was
[54:18] appreciating you know her her attitude
[54:21] right towards the word which is another
[54:24] important thing. your attitude towards
[54:26] the word says a lot about you, right?
[54:28] And so she came to me one time and you
[54:30] know, she was like, "Hey, I forgot to
[54:32] mention, you know, I enjoyed your
[54:34] sermon, you know, and she was like, she
[54:36] spoke along the line." She said, "It's
[54:37] so nice to see, you know, people that
[54:40] believe the word, right?" Because she
[54:42] had been to a lot of different churches,
[54:45] right? But I'll say this, when you
[54:47] preach the word, not just preach the
[54:49] word, cuz brother Brandham said preach
[54:51] is a life. When you're living this life,
[54:54] people know it's a difference between
[54:56] you and other denominations and other
[54:58] systems and people can see the
[55:00] difference. That's why the message, you
[55:02] don't got to debate the message. The
[55:04] life speaks for itself, right? It
[55:07] doesn't need to be debated because it's
[55:08] the truth. And so, I appreciate that
[55:11] from her because I'm like, man, that's a
[55:13] really, really good attitude. You know,
[55:14] there might be something there. I'm not
[55:16] God. It could be a seed, you know, or it
[55:18] could just, you know, it could be
[55:19] salvation. whatever it is, I appreciate
[55:22] the the attitude though, which could
[55:24] mean that it could be something. So, you
[55:25] know, just pray for her. And then there
[55:27] was this other girl that I had in my
[55:29] job, you know, and she um I guess she
[55:32] was going to some kind of event or
[55:33] something like that. And so, she she
[55:35] said, "What do you think about this
[55:36] dress that I'm going to buy?" And it was
[55:38] some provocative dress, you know, you
[55:40] I'm like, "Okay." I said I said I was
[55:44] like I didn't want to be mean, right?
[55:47] Because that's the thing about it. you
[55:49] don't got to be judgmental, right? But I
[55:51] said, uh, I said, I don't really like
[55:52] that, you know. I said, I like I like it
[55:54] when girls dress modest. And so she made
[55:56] a comment about that. Oh, you like it
[55:58] when girls wear dresses all the way up
[55:59] to their neck, right? And I know that
[56:02] she was joking, but it's that same
[56:05] mocking spirit you got to be careful
[56:07] about, right? You got to be careful
[56:09] because I'm not believing this thing
[56:11] because I made it up.
[56:12] I believe this thing because it was
[56:14] revealed to me and it's God's word,
[56:16] right? And God's word is yay and amen.
[56:19] Right? And so that's why you you have to
[56:22] be careful during this end day that you
[56:24] have a spirit upon you that can receive
[56:26] the fullness of the word and and end it
[56:29] with a amen each time. Right? And um and
[56:34] just kind of in closing uh just to uh
[56:36] mention another um another situation
[56:39] that kind of uh happened to me. I
[56:41] remember I was um I was on Instagram and
[56:44] you got to be careful what you listen to
[56:45] out there because everybody has an
[56:48] opinion now. Everybody's got an opinion
[56:50] about the word. Everybody's got an
[56:52] opinion about what's the right thing to
[56:54] do. And so I came across this account of
[56:56] this girl that believed in Muslim, I
[56:58] guess, the Muslim religion. And she was
[57:00] going through and just uh saying all the
[57:04] mistakes in the King James version. And
[57:06] so I'm sitting here and I'm intrigued
[57:07] because I never really looked at it kind
[57:09] of that way like as it being wrong or
[57:11] something like that. And so then I began
[57:13] to go on this search and you know there
[57:15] was this other guy out there and he was
[57:16] like people refer to people that only
[57:19] read the King James version as uh King
[57:21] James purist and I had never heard of
[57:24] that before because this is just this is
[57:26] just you know the prophet read the King
[57:27] James version. That's what he said. Oh
[57:29] that and that's just what I follow. And
[57:31] so he began to then dissect all the
[57:34] wrong the translations with each and
[57:37] every Bible verse. And so I you know and
[57:40] me I I have to be careful because I like
[57:43] a good debate. And so you know I got I
[57:46] had I I had I had to catch myself
[57:48] because I started going through each one
[57:50] and I'm like well hold on a second. You
[57:51] know he started in the beginning where
[57:53] God had created the heaven. It said
[57:55] right here you know it translates to
[57:57] heaven but then down here it translates
[57:58] to heavens. So, you know, that's an
[58:00] inconsistency and and I started like,
[58:03] well, let me start let me let me kind of
[58:05] like, you know, tell what I believe
[58:06] about it because the thing about it is
[58:08] if God wrote it, I know it's right.
[58:11] So, that means there's an answer
[58:12] somewhere.
[58:13] That's right.
[58:13] You don't have to sit there and uh and
[58:16] and I believe that's what kind of came
[58:17] on me though. It was like, you know
[58:19] what? I don't have to debate this.
[58:22] I don't have to entertain all of these
[58:23] things. I don't have to go through and
[58:25] just kind of prove these things. And as
[58:27] I was going through the um the uh
[58:30] teaching for that I do for the youth, I
[58:32] came across this old lesson plan and I
[58:34] kind of feel God is a funny way of doing
[58:36] things and it was about the translations
[58:38] of the Bible. And I said, you know what,
[58:40] that's all I need. You know, if brother
[58:42] Brandham said this thing is correct, I
[58:44] don't need to go down there and prove
[58:45] it. Right? And that's what the that's
[58:47] how the spiritual mind they just take
[58:50] God at his word. Right? Abraham. And
[58:52] that's why Isaac was the promise seed
[58:54] because Isaac was just taken at God's
[58:57] word. No matter what went through, no
[58:59] matter the situation, dead in their
[59:01] body, Abraham just believed God. But
[59:04] this other this other church, they got
[59:06] to have reasoning. They got to they got
[59:08] to figure out everything. They got to
[59:10] everything has to be explained to them.
[59:12] But the beautiful thing about the church
[59:14] of God, right, in the Gentiles, and I I
[59:17] was teaching this to the youth, you
[59:18] know, even during the time of Christ,
[59:20] when Jesus Christ went down to the Jews,
[59:23] it was always the Gentiles believing
[59:25] without signs.
[59:27] Just to show who the rightful heir was,
[59:30] right? Because Brother Brandham said the
[59:32] 144,000 will go through the tribulation.
[59:35] They won't have a rapture. 144,000 Jews,
[59:38] even though they'll get the message and
[59:39] they'll believe the message of the hour,
[59:40] they'll go through the tribulation. they
[59:42] do not get a rapture. Only the bride,
[59:44] the gentile bride uh receives a rapture.
[59:47] So we so as um in closing as we are
[59:52] beginning to go about our days in life
[59:54] and you know know the different types of
[59:56] uh interactions that we have with people
[59:59] is so I feel like the spirit of the
[1:00:01] world today is a debate spirit.
[1:00:03] It is a argument spirit. as I go online
[1:00:05] and I and and it's so tempting to just
[1:00:08] kind of like see a post and see a video
[1:00:10] and people argue things and debate stuff
[1:00:13] and it's so tempting to just want to say
[1:00:15] something, right? But you we have to
[1:00:18] learn that, you know, especially when it
[1:00:20] comes, you know, to message things and
[1:00:22] biblical things. It's only by
[1:00:24] revelation,
[1:00:26] right? And and even as believers, God
[1:00:29] still only shows you what he wants to,
[1:00:32] right? Brother Brandham had taught had
[1:00:34] spoke that about Isaac. Isaac was a
[1:00:36] prophet, but God didn't show him uh the
[1:00:40] plan of um Jacob. God didn't show him
[1:00:42] give him a vision about that. So God
[1:00:44] only shows you what you're allowed to
[1:00:46] see. So uh we should be thankful, right?
[1:00:49] We should be we should we should thank
[1:00:51] God for his grace for the things we
[1:00:52] know, the things that we don't know,
[1:00:54] right? We should be thankful because
[1:00:56] it's only by love that you get it. It's
[1:00:58] not intellect. It's not you trying to
[1:01:00] trying to figure this thing out and
[1:01:01] trying to explain this thing out and
[1:01:03] trying to you know well you know the
[1:01:05] bear the bridge and this and that and
[1:01:06] all these things brother there is a
[1:01:09] reason for everything right there is a
[1:01:12] reason for everything because God God
[1:01:14] never vindicated his word by explaining
[1:01:16] it he just said his word right in the
[1:01:19] beginning when he said let there be
[1:01:20] light he never explained well this atom
[1:01:22] is going to come together with this
[1:01:23] proton and they're going to smash and
[1:01:25] they're going to create this chain
[1:01:26] reaction he didn't say all of that he
[1:01:28] just said let there be a light.
[1:01:30] Right? So, as believers, it is our job
[1:01:32] to just believe the word. Just take the
[1:01:35] word.
[1:01:35] Yes, sir.
[1:01:36] Amen. So, we're going to end this in a
[1:01:38] in a word of prayer.
[1:01:40] Uh Lord Jesus, Lord, we thank you, oh
[1:01:44] Lord God, that Lord, you've anointed us,
[1:01:47] oh Lord God, with the ice live that you
[1:01:49] said, oh Lord God, so that we can see
[1:01:51] these things in the end time, oh Lord
[1:01:53] God. Oh God, we need more of your
[1:01:56] spirit, oh Lord God, so that we can take
[1:01:58] action with what we've heard, Lord God.
[1:02:00] Lord, we don't want to be caught, oh
[1:02:02] Lord Jesus Christ, seeking for oil.
[1:02:04] Lord, the prophet said when the when the
[1:02:06] denomination begins to seek the Holy
[1:02:09] Spirit, that we're approaching the end
[1:02:12] time, oh Lord God, because the foolish
[1:02:14] the w the foolish virgin, oh Lord God,
[1:02:16] when they started looking for the Holy
[1:02:18] Ghost, it was too late, Lord God. And
[1:02:20] Lord, we see that the denominations are
[1:02:22] starting to do these things. Oh Lord
[1:02:24] God, they're starting to want the Holy
[1:02:25] Spirit. Oh Lord, so we know that the end
[1:02:27] is so close, oh Lord God. Lord, help us,
[1:02:30] oh Lord. Help us, oh Lord, to prepare
[1:02:32] ourselves, oh Lord God. Give us
[1:02:34] revelation. Give us insight, Lord. Give
[1:02:36] us fire, oh Lord God, to live for you,
[1:02:39] oh Lord God. Lord, let us put away the
[1:02:41] the silly arguments and debates and you
[1:02:44] know, brother Brandon meant this and
[1:02:45] brother Brandon meant that and all these
[1:02:47] things and just live with the
[1:02:48] revelation, the little revelation that
[1:02:50] you give us, oh Lord God, help us just
[1:02:52] to focus on that for each and every
[1:02:54] single day, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[1:02:56] that we may be pleasing to you, oh Lord
[1:02:58] God, and that we may be ready at your
[1:03:00] arrival, oh Lord God. Lord, we thank you
[1:03:03] for all that you're doing. We thank you
[1:03:04] for the revelation that you've given us
[1:03:05] in meeting us at uh at this time oh Lord
[1:03:07] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:13] [Applause]
[1:03:18] Bless you. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:23] We certainly thank God for his word
[1:03:27] uh on tonight. And I love the the uh
[1:03:32] inspiration coming out of uh that quote
[1:03:36] of uh brother Brandon prophesying about
[1:03:39] the um the uh pope coming from the
[1:03:43] United States. And that prophecy
[1:03:47] uh happened was it 70 years ago?
[1:03:50] Something like that. roughly 70 years
[1:03:53] ago uh the prophecy uh came forth and um
[1:03:58] roughly 9 months after that prophecy
[1:04:00] that he read um the current pope was
[1:04:04] born 9 months after that in Chicago
[1:04:07] and uh and so he grabs this inspiration
[1:04:11] there the the the true church and you
[1:04:13] know just beautiful types there how we
[1:04:16] can look at scripture even um if we were
[1:04:20] to go back to Revelation chapter 2 and
[1:04:23] Revelation chapter 3. Uh it talks about
[1:04:26] these seven churches um that was Asia
[1:04:30] Minor, but they were representing you
[1:04:32] know things that were happening uh in
[1:04:34] ages to come. But uh at the end of each
[1:04:38] section to the church of Ephesus and you
[1:04:41] know Smyrna uh Pergamus, Thotira, you
[1:04:45] know, you name it. At the end of each
[1:04:46] section, it always had this thing say,
[1:04:50] uh, he that hath an ear, let him hear
[1:04:54] what the spirit saith unto
[1:04:58] the churches.
[1:05:02] And there was a reason that that was
[1:05:04] placed in scripture like that because
[1:05:07] um and you know I I'm not going to
[1:05:12] preach behind the preacher but real rich
[1:05:14] but um the reason that we can say to the
[1:05:17] the the Bible says to the church is
[1:05:19] because there's a false church and
[1:05:20] there's a true church and all the way in
[1:05:23] the book of Genesis we see evidence of a
[1:05:27] false church and a true church because
[1:05:30] Cain had a church
[1:05:33] and uh Abel had a church and uh and and
[1:05:37] God actually showed up to both churches
[1:05:42] and uh and he told Cain, "I don't like
[1:05:44] what y'all doing over here,
[1:05:46] but if you do what y'all what what your
[1:05:48] brother over there is doing, I'll accept
[1:05:50] that."
[1:05:51] And and it just was not in Cain. Even
[1:05:54] though he was worshiping,
[1:05:56] it just wasn't him to do it the right
[1:05:58] way. Oh, I thank God. God is looking for
[1:06:01] some folk that will worship him
[1:06:05] in spirit and in truth. Brother Quinton,
[1:06:07] God bless you, brother. I
[1:06:13] God bless you. That was that was that
[1:06:17] was real real good. Let me have uh the
[1:06:19] announcements uh for tonight. Certainly
[1:06:22] thank God for the word. I I I'm I I was
[1:06:25] thinking earlier today and and and and I
[1:06:28] I just hope this don't come out the
[1:06:30] wrong way. Uh but I feel like I and this
[1:06:36] just me. You might not feel this way,
[1:06:37] but it's me. I feel like I am eating at
[1:06:41] a spiritual smorggas board.
[1:06:45] That's just what I feel. I I've been a
[1:06:47] part of church for a long time and I've
[1:06:50] gone to some services
[1:06:53] and there's some services I left hungry.
[1:06:57] I've been in church for hours and left
[1:07:00] hungry,
[1:07:02] spiritually hungry, right? But for it
[1:07:04] just seemed like something about this
[1:07:06] season. I come to church and the Lord
[1:07:08] just know how to meet my needs every
[1:07:11] time I come. It's a spiritual smokers
[1:07:13] board. I thank God for it. Thank God for
[1:07:17] all these ministers here at Spirit and
[1:07:18] Truth Tabernacle. Certainly appreciate
[1:07:21] each one.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:25] And um I was at the beginning of the
[1:07:28] service I was listening to um just the
[1:07:32] way the the songs were being lined up
[1:07:35] and I and I I I was listening to Brother
[1:07:38] Jerry and like, "Brother Jerry coming
[1:07:40] along."
[1:07:40] Yes, he is.
[1:07:41] And uh I'm like, "Okay, we we know what
[1:07:43] you're playing over there, brother. we
[1:07:45] all done jumped. Don't even start
[1:07:46] singing it, you know. Uh, nothing better
[1:07:49] than knowing Jesus. And then then I then
[1:07:51] I I I heard uh Xander kind of catch that
[1:07:54] that uh symbol. I'm like, "Hey, he got
[1:07:58] the symbol, the snare, and the bass.
[1:08:02] Come on now, Xander. Keep it going, bro.
[1:08:05] I I I'm listening. Josiah catching the
[1:08:08] notes on the bas. This thing is kind of
[1:08:10] moving on up, you know. I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:08:12] I'm very very very happy to see what God
[1:08:15] is doing. And I and I always give
[1:08:17] brother Marisa a hard time. I I told him
[1:08:19] tonight, brother, you did a good job.
[1:08:20] Did a good job. Keep it going, brother.
[1:08:22] Amen. Let me let me uh get the
[1:08:24] announcements. Amen. Uh so, Sunday
[1:08:27] morning, we will be here in prayer from
[1:08:30] 9 to 10:00. Uh our service will start at
[1:08:33] 10:30. And then Sunday school uh also
[1:08:36] will happen from 9:30 to 10 for our
[1:08:38] youth and our young adults. Uh virtual
[1:08:41] streaming will continue through Facebook
[1:08:43] as which we we can be found at SAT
[1:08:46] tabernacle. We also have streaming on
[1:08:48] our church website which is www.
[1:08:50] john423.org.
[1:08:53] And um Friday night we have a tape
[1:08:57] service uh that we'll be listening to.
[1:08:59] And I know Friday is actually a um a
[1:09:03] holiday and it just so happened to be
[1:09:05] the first Friday. So I'd encourage you
[1:09:07] if you catch it in the morning that's
[1:09:10] fine because you might be spending time
[1:09:11] with your family you know in in the
[1:09:13] evening but just sometime you know just
[1:09:15] catch uh the tape so you can catch the
[1:09:18] um inspiration just never know how the
[1:09:19] Lord might take that and bring it back
[1:09:21] to us. Uh so Friday Friday tape service
[1:09:24] will be going beyond the camp and then
[1:09:26] uh want to just kind of make mention
[1:09:29] ahead of time as we're approaching the
[1:09:31] meetings we have to make some some
[1:09:32] changes to our schedule. So the the the
[1:09:35] the Wednesday before the meetings, we
[1:09:37] won't have service here. Uh the
[1:09:39] Wednesday before the meetings, as I
[1:09:41] mentioned to the brothers, uh on that
[1:09:44] Thursday, um from 2 to 6, they have
[1:09:48] given us a window to set up all of our
[1:09:50] equipment. Uh we have a couple vendors
[1:09:52] that are coming that may need our help
[1:09:54] and unloading trucks and and putting

[1:15:16] want to that the church has been a
[1:15:17] staple in the community for years
[1:15:22] uh Hilltop Missionary Baptist Church.
[1:15:24] So, uh, he's been, um, you know, just a
[1:15:27] a leader of the church for, uh, for so
[1:15:30] many years, and I know you took ill, but

[1:15:34] We want to, uh, just remember the family
[1:15:37] in our prayers. Amen. Let's pray. Amen.
[1:15:40] Father, we are grateful for the
[1:15:44] privilege we have to be able to come
[1:15:46] here into the house of the Lord and to
[1:15:48] hear the word of God. We thank you,
[1:15:51] Father, for uh Brother Quinton just
[1:15:53] getting himself out of the way and just
[1:15:55] allowing you to use him to speak to us.
[1:16:00] Um we we just appreciate, Father, just
[1:16:03] hearing your voice. It's it's it's it's
[1:16:06] a blessing to come into the house of God
[1:16:08] and to be fed uh spiritual food in due
[1:16:12] season. Uh Father, we ask your blessings
[1:16:14] upon him that you would just give back
[1:16:16] to him as he's given uh to us tonight.
[1:16:19] Father, we want to remember the Davis
[1:16:22] family and the entire Hilltop uh church.
[1:16:26] God, they have lost uh their leader uh
[1:16:30] uh a a wonderful, wonderful man of God
[1:16:33] that has made an impact in the community
[1:16:36] and in his church. And God, as you have
[1:16:38] saw fit to call them to his great
[1:16:40] reward. We pray that for those that are
[1:16:42] left behind and God has to navigate this
[1:16:45] next season. We trust, Lord, that your
[1:16:48] spirit would bring comfort and bring
[1:16:49] strength and uh bring direction and
[1:16:52] instruction, Father, unity. Uh may that
[1:16:55] be found Lord. And we just trust, oh
[1:16:57] God, that you would get glory out of all
[1:17:00] of this. And we uh uh we we know God
[1:17:03] that nothing happens by chance or by
[1:17:06] happen stance, but you have purpose in
[1:17:08] everything that you do. And and recently
[1:17:10] we heard Lord how sometimes some people
[1:17:13] won't even come to church until there's
[1:17:15] a funeral or there's a wedding. So uh we
[1:17:17] pray that father people that dock those
[1:17:19] doors would hear the gospel and their
[1:17:22] their their spirit man would be
[1:17:24] penetrated by the word of God that is
[1:17:26] spoken. And we just trust, oh God, that
[1:17:28] you would draw hearts closer to you as
[1:17:30] the saints prepare to leave this place
[1:17:32] tonight uh but not your presence. We ask
[1:17:35] that you would go with them, that you
[1:17:37] would keep them uh from all hurt, harm,
[1:17:39] and danger. And father, may you keep us
[1:17:41] till we are able to come back together
[1:17:43] again. And we realize the enemy is
[1:17:46] attacking some of their bodies. But we
[1:17:48] rebuke that attack in the name of Jesus
[1:17:50] and pray that you bring complete and
[1:17:51] total healing to all. It's in Jesus'
[1:17:54] name that we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:17:58] you. Uh the brothers will come at this
[1:18:00] time to dismiss you.
