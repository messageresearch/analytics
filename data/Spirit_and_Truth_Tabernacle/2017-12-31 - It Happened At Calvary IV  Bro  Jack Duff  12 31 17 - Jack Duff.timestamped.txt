[25:13] [Music]
[25:22] god bless your Saints y'all bear with me
[25:26] just for a little bit I was just talking
[25:32] to the lawyer yesterday trying to figure
[25:34] out the mind of God for the song that I
[25:36] was singing today and look like I just
[25:38] couldn't come up with nothing at all so
[25:42] I decided to put it all put on I wanted
[25:45] to taste brother branham's messages and
[25:47] just immediately hearing that voice
[25:50] inspiration start coming and the Lord
[25:55] just kind of took me back doing a review
[25:57] of the different songs that he's given
[26:00] me under this inspiration and I you know
[26:06] like I just had to meet him didn't know
[26:07] what to do then so I just want to say
[26:12] that there's a real real real bad attack
[26:18] on this message the real today is in
[26:20] case some of you don't know there is a
[26:23] strong strong attack and as I just begin
[26:28] to listen to that prophet one of the
[26:30] songs that came to my mind was I'll
[26:34] never walk away save me from my aaron
[26:39] ways then i got to wanted a song and uh
[26:46] i knew this was it when i came in
[26:49] contact with this message i knew that
[26:51] this was it and just going through so
[26:54] many um what have you then I found
[26:56] myself singing this when the roadmap and
[27:03] I just want to thank the Lord for that
[27:05] because this message pulled out a gift
[27:08] in me that I really didn't know that I
[27:09] had yeah I wrote some little Dingles I
[27:13] would call him before I came into this
[27:15] message but the depths of the teaching
[27:19] brought out the depths in the songs and
[27:22] I could never turn my back on those
[27:25] things because as your inspiration was
[27:28] coming when they the songs came
[27:30] I feel the same way now I feel the same
[27:33] way and I just I just want to thank the
[27:37] Lord for just using me as a vessel my
[27:39] family is using us as bestest around
[27:43] this message to bless the people and you
[27:46] know just just continues in parabola cos
[27:49] this rebellion against the message is
[27:53] hidden in places that I never imagined
[27:55] but it's real nobody led me into this
[27:59] message the Holy Spirit let me and no
[28:01] man could leave me out of it only God is
[28:06] that brother Westco say if this thing
[28:08] and I'm gonna hold on to this to it come
[28:11] amen amen
[28:13] so those who know this song the roadmap
[28:16] I entreat you to help me out if you feel
[28:18] the same way if you feel you've got the
[28:21] same assurance that this is a roadmap

[1:08:06] a man I look back in man 2017 was my
[1:08:11] first year of full-time ministry a man
[1:08:17] for a full year and and it seemed like
[1:08:20] everybody kind of picked up on something
[1:08:22] on on Wednesday night I think three or
[1:08:25] four people that same day I heard was
[1:08:29] talking about how when we go back and we
[1:08:31] look at the story the children of Israel
[1:08:34] coming through Exodus and numbers and
[1:08:36] Sooners God delivered them brought them
[1:08:39] out of one thing the Bible say they
[1:08:41] begin the murmur right and and and and
[1:08:44] we found just Wednesday night there were
[1:08:46] five times that they murmur within a one
[1:08:49] month span of being delivered from each
[1:08:52] of them and and when we when we think
[1:08:55] about that we have to put ourselves in
[1:08:56] their position because how many times
[1:08:58] has God made a way and then we turn
[1:09:01] right back around and start murmuring
[1:09:04] talk about how he's gonna do it you know
[1:09:07] I have to repent you know and you know
[1:09:11] you know sometime you know I'm gonna be
[1:09:13] honest people might say I've talked to
[1:09:16] myself and and and I am I am I'm talking
[1:09:19] to encourage myself David did that
[1:09:21] encourages up Lord but all the time when
[1:09:23] I'm talking I'm also talking to the
[1:09:24] devil and I'm just let him know yeah God
[1:09:28] did it this time and God did it that
[1:09:30] time and if God did it this time at that
[1:09:32] time then he gonna do it also again
[1:09:35] right and you know sometimes you just
[1:09:38] have to just stop and just say Lord you
[1:09:40] did this and ain't no way I'm going down
[1:09:41] to forgive me for even having just to
[1:09:44] paint out because you don't prove
[1:09:47] yourself too many times to me already

[1:18:50] I'm just telling you one of the sisters
[1:18:53] got a whole day apron and some things
[1:18:55] check don't be handing that apron where
[1:19:05] it is what is but man we appreciate that
[1:19:15] God is good I don't know if it's just me
[1:19:18] but I'm burning up I know I know it's
[1:19:24] winter but for Florida floating like
[1:19:26] that I mean you get you get your 50s in
[1:19:30] the morning but by the time the Sun Rise
[1:19:32] you back up in eighty you know but but
[1:19:34] praise the Lord here in second Samuel
[1:19:36] Chapter seven we will read a man from
[1:19:39] here starting at verse one says it came
[1:19:43] to pass when the King said in his house
[1:19:46] and the Lord had given him rest
[1:19:49] roundabout from all his enemies all
[1:19:51] right so he's coming to a place he's
[1:19:53] been battling been fighting but now he's
[1:19:56] come to spot where he has he has rest
[1:19:58] and I think there's there's times in our
[1:20:01] lives where we also get a little rest
[1:20:04] you know from the battle verse two says
[1:20:07] that the King said unto Nathan the
[1:20:08] prophet see now I dwell in a house of
[1:20:11] cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth with
[1:20:13] within curtains a man he was very
[1:20:16] concerned about Oh God's house right
[1:20:19] thanking God for his house but now he
[1:20:22] has more concerned about God's house so
[1:20:25] he says but the Ark of God dwelleth
[1:20:27] within curtains and Nathan said to the
[1:20:29] king gold do all that is in thine heart
[1:20:33] for the Lord is with thee
[1:20:35] those are some powerful words to all
[1:20:37] that is in thine heart for the
[1:20:39] Lord is with thee and it came to pass
[1:20:42] that night that the word Lord came in to
[1:20:44] Nathan saying go and tell my servant
[1:20:46] David thus saith the Lord shalt thou
[1:20:48] build me a house for me to dwell in
[1:20:50] whereas I have not dwelt in any house
[1:20:53] since the time that I brought up the
[1:20:55] children of Israel out of Egypt even to
[1:20:57] this day but have walked in a tent and
[1:20:59] in a tabernacle and all the places where
[1:21:02] and I have walked with all the children
[1:21:04] of Israel speak our word with any of the
[1:21:07] tribes of Israel who might command it to
[1:21:09] feed my people Israel saying why Billy
[1:21:11] not me why Billy not me a house of cedar
[1:21:15] so God never even put this on upon
[1:21:18] anybody says now therefore so shalt thou
[1:21:20] say unto my servant David thus saith the
[1:21:23] Lord of Hope Lord of hosts I took thee
[1:21:25] from the sheep coat from following the
[1:21:29] Sheep to be ruler over my people for
[1:21:32] Israel and oftentimes we all need to
[1:21:34] reflect on where God brought us from a
[1:21:36] man I took thee from the sheep coat
[1:21:39] right from following the Sheep to be
[1:21:41] rule over my people of Israel and I was
[1:21:44] with thee whithersoever thou witness and
[1:21:46] have cut off all that meaning yes I like
[1:21:48] that right I was with thee whithersoever
[1:21:50] thou wentest
[1:21:51] and have cut off all thine enemies out
[1:21:54] of thy sight lord have mercy
[1:21:57] I'm not going to see you no more a man
[1:22:02] if their true enemy got to do that
[1:22:06] remember but sometimes people they're
[1:22:08] just to test your character as you might
[1:22:11] have thought you were a Christian until
[1:22:14] some folk come into your life you go
[1:22:19] they'll prove your Christianity right
[1:22:21] since I was with you with the stroke
[1:22:23] without witness and I've cut off all
[1:22:24] thine enemies out of our sight and have
[1:22:26] made thee a great name like into the
[1:22:29] name of the great men that are in the
[1:22:31] earth moreover I will appoint a place
[1:22:33] for my people Israel and we plant them
[1:22:35] that they may dwell in a place of their
[1:22:37] own and move no more neither shall the
[1:22:41] children wickedness afflict them anymore
[1:22:43] as before time and I've since the time
[1:22:46] that I commanded judges to be over my
[1:22:48] people Israel and have caused it to rest
[1:22:50] from all that enemies also the Lord
[1:22:52] telling
[1:22:53] that he will make thee a house and when
[1:22:57] thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt
[1:23:00] sleep with thy father's I was set up
[1:23:02] that seed after thee which shall proceed
[1:23:05] out of that bowels and I will establish
[1:23:06] his kingdom now we realized that
[1:23:09] Scripture has dual meanings amen and
[1:23:12] we'll try to talk about that today he
[1:23:14] shall build a house for my name and I
[1:23:16] will establish the throne of his kingdom
[1:23:18] forever I will be his father and he
[1:23:21] shall be my son if he committed iniquity
[1:23:23] I will chasten him with the rod of men
[1:23:26] and with the stripes of the children men
[1:23:28] but my mercy shall not depart away from
[1:23:31] him as I took it from Saul whom I put
[1:23:34] away before thee and thine house and my
[1:23:36] kingdom shall be established for ever
[1:23:38] before they that throne shall be
[1:23:40] established forever the Lord had a
[1:23:42] blessing to the reading of his word let
[1:23:43] us bow in a word of Prayer father we are
[1:23:45] grateful for the privilege to be able to
[1:23:47] reach Scripture
[1:23:48] but we realize the Holy Spirit is the
[1:23:51] one that helps us to understand what it
[1:23:53] is that we're reading bring revelation
[1:23:56] to our hearts the Prophet said Ezra if
[1:23:58] revelation is beyond us then we should
[1:24:00] look up and ask God for it so we asked
[1:24:02] that you would bring revelation from
[1:24:03] heaven we realized that if we're
[1:24:06] standing on the rock of Revelation and
[1:24:08] the gates of Hell will not be able to
[1:24:09] prevail against you against us thank you
[1:24:11] for the anointing a man that is in this
[1:24:14] place thank you for the spirit of
[1:24:15] worship a man that is amongst the the
[1:24:19] Saints and God we all have so much to be
[1:24:21] grateful for for what you have done and
[1:24:24] what you're getting ready to do
[1:24:25] well we praise you so bless us now as we
[1:24:27] enter into the word we take every spirit
[1:24:29] that's a gift your spirit underneath the
[1:24:30] control of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:32] in Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:24:35] bless you can be seated so as we just
[1:24:41] begin our journey here through this
[1:24:45] fourth part it happened at Calvary just
[1:24:49] kind of go and recap a little bit a man
[1:24:52] remember we brought out in our first
[1:24:55] sermon there how Abraham was asked to go
[1:25:02] to Mount Moriah and to offer Isaac
[1:25:05] had a very specific mountain that he
[1:25:07] wanted Abraham to go to and we look at
[1:25:10] that way back in Genesis at the
[1:25:13] beginning because Genesis means
[1:25:14] beginning but here here Abraham is going
[1:25:17] to Moriah the name Moriah bitterness of
[1:25:20] the Lord also meant doctrine of the Lord
[1:25:23] and Abraham has asked to go there when
[1:25:26] it gets there to that mountain
[1:25:28] Isaac is asking that his daddy daddy
[1:25:31] I see the wood and Isaac packing the
[1:25:33] wood on his back and and all these
[1:25:35] things and he's like that I see the wood
[1:25:36] because I'm carrying it now you know
[1:25:38] it's a and I've seen a knife I see this
[1:25:40] he said but where is that lamb and you
[1:25:44] know and Isaac got a look just to look
[1:25:46] concern and and Abraham being the father
[1:25:48] of faith you got to know what to stay at
[1:25:50] what times right because his response is
[1:25:53] God will provide himself a ram for
[1:25:58] sacrifice or lamb for the sacrifice and
[1:26:00] and and then he still turns around the
[1:26:02] ax Isaac to lay down and and here here
[1:26:05] this very promise that God had given
[1:26:07] Abraham through Isaac Abraham is about
[1:26:10] to slay his own promise right but but
[1:26:12] here you know in faith Abraham does this
[1:26:15] and Isaac it meant humbles himself the
[1:26:18] same way Jesus humble himself to the
[1:26:19] cross and Isaac lays himself down and
[1:26:22] and while Abraham was in the midst of
[1:26:24] about to slay his son he hears from
[1:26:26] heaven Abraham Abraham stay your hand he
[1:26:28] and God actually provided himself a
[1:26:30] sacrifice he put a ram in the bush a man
[1:26:34] but that Ram was representing the Lord
[1:26:36] Jesus Christ and and not just you know
[1:26:40] we use that as a type we say those words
[1:26:43] just so so so plainly they don't it was
[1:26:44] a type it was just representation but it
[1:26:47] was more than that the very same spot
[1:26:49] that God called Abraham the go-to was
[1:26:52] the same spot that Jesus Christ would be
[1:26:55] dying on the cross right so so it was it
[1:26:57] was more than the type it was it was
[1:26:59] reality you know and so when we look at
[1:27:02] that that's something that happened at
[1:27:03] Calvary Oh glory to God and as we turn
[1:27:06] it on through a man through this we also
[1:27:09] found that when you know you went went
[1:27:12] went the reason that it wasn't the a man
[1:27:15] that the it was about I would let me put
[1:27:17] it this way Mariah was about a four man
[1:27:19] walked from Calvary hey man so that's
[1:27:22] why we say it was the same vicinity the
[1:27:24] same area that Isaac was off was the
[1:27:26] same area that Jesus Christ a mare was
[1:27:29] been off a blatte but but because a man
[1:27:32] that that when Abraham was was taking
[1:27:35] Isaac God told him I offer a whole burnt
[1:27:38] offering and anytime you offered a hope
[1:27:40] or Alfred that has to be offered outside
[1:27:42] of the city gates hallelujah so when
[1:27:45] Jesus comes along as the whole burnt
[1:27:47] offering for mankind he is offered right
[1:27:50] outside the city gates at Calvary that
[1:27:52] has a purpose for him going to Calvary
[1:27:55] amen because Calvary meant what place of
[1:27:57] skull hallelujah dog golf the mint heap
[1:28:01] of skulls and here you know Jesus died
[1:28:04] at Calvary because you know when he gone
[1:28:06] there he's he's actually done that the
[1:28:09] answer amen to to the question of
[1:28:13] redemption who could I mean who could
[1:28:15] actually uh satisfy gospel to Jesus
[1:28:18] Christ became the answer and then the
[1:28:20] satisfied gospel T of death and we thank
[1:28:23] God for that but when he went there to
[1:28:26] that place of school they don't know
[1:28:28] what they were doing they they had no
[1:28:30] idea when they took Jesus and put him
[1:28:32] there they had no idea that the blood
[1:28:34] that was that was that was running from
[1:28:36] Jesus with drop down seeped through the
[1:28:38] crack and hit a skull that was down
[1:28:41] there that was at the place of scope and
[1:28:43] that's God happened to be the school of
[1:28:46] Adam hallelujah the first Adam sold us
[1:28:51] into sin but the secondary redeemed us
[1:28:53] from the curse of sin and all of that
[1:28:57] happened at Calvary the other thing we
[1:29:01] found that happened at Calvary was a man
[1:29:04] David David you know got herself in a
[1:29:08] little trouble
[1:29:09] little trouble the you gotta he got a
[1:29:13] spirit on him where he wanted to see
[1:29:15] exactly how many men he had in the
[1:29:17] kingdom that could fight and and when we
[1:29:19] read the scripture you know you read you
[1:29:22] know one and the book of saying another
[1:29:24] other story in the Book of Chronicles
[1:29:26] you know you can see some differences in
[1:29:28] the story praise the Lord
[1:29:30] but just because I see differences don't
[1:29:32] make me put my Bible down hallelujah now
[1:29:36] I said that intentionally right because
[1:29:39] there's people that see differences in
[1:29:40] the message but I'm not gonna stop
[1:29:43] believing the message look you don't
[1:29:45] realize I saw differences in Pentecost I
[1:29:48] saw differences in Baptist but they
[1:29:50] don't have nothing there to keep me
[1:29:52] right and guess anything that man is
[1:29:55] involved with there's gonna be some
[1:29:56] differences
[1:29:57] hallelujah but God is still God in the
[1:30:00] midst of it all amen I found me a
[1:30:02] roadmap to get to heaven glory to God
[1:30:06] this message is my road map hey man I
[1:30:11] know people don't like us standing those
[1:30:13] things but you know that remember the
[1:30:15] seed the seed of the bondwoman is not
[1:30:18] here with the seed of the freewoman
[1:30:21] so you cannot take the bottom woman and
[1:30:24] force her into a rapture but with
[1:30:28] feelings and emotions that's not going
[1:30:30] you ain't gonna get into the rapture
[1:30:32] with your feelings and emotions did not
[1:30:34] get into the rapture because you will be
[1:30:35] in the word so you got to have something
[1:30:39] inside you it's gonna be magnetized to
[1:30:41] this headstone and in the headstone is
[1:30:44] Christ he is the word so the word has to
[1:30:46] connect with the word in you and if it's
[1:30:49] not going to connect it won't be low
[1:30:50] magnet it will magnetize right so if you
[1:30:54] got people rejecting the word and still
[1:30:56] saying I'm going to rap so I don't see
[1:30:57] how that's going to happen
[1:30:58] Amen it won't happen Church so you know
[1:31:01] I'm sorry to have to be the one to share
[1:31:03] the bad news but but you know it's not
[1:31:06] I'm not the first one to share that news
[1:31:08] you tell me how many people made it in
[1:31:10] those day how many that was a tight you
[1:31:16] know of a not not necessarily the
[1:31:19] rapture but you know people being spared
[1:31:21] from something it was attack only eight
[1:31:23] people now what happened in north uncle
[1:31:27] what about North's mother-in-law I mean
[1:31:33] you tell me I it's in your Bible right
[1:31:36] we're going back to the Bible you tell
[1:31:37] me what happened to the people they was
[1:31:39] good people
[1:31:40] church-going people
[1:31:44] but they didn't make it right so look
[1:31:46] that's what I'm what I'm here to tell
[1:31:48] you I'm not the one that's going to put
[1:31:50] people in I put people out but I will
[1:31:52] tell you this you gonna have to follow
[1:31:53] that word if you're gonna make it
[1:31:56] praise along a man it was good people in
[1:31:59] the days of our you know just I mean
[1:32:01] Abraham with others a few good ones
[1:32:03] damaged like what if it's 50 in Sodom
[1:32:06] okay what a what a 45 what about 40 okay
[1:32:11] don't get mad 30 20 and he said not now
[1:32:17] okay I can't ain't gonna say nothing
[1:32:19] else I promise exit can we destroy if I
[1:32:24] find 10 righteous I wonder straight can
[1:32:26] you imagine that God couldn't even find
[1:32:28] 10 people 10 and in a city that big he
[1:32:33] couldn't find 10 Oh God have mercy you
[1:32:39] know see you know I got a quote here and
[1:32:41] I didn't know how I was gonna fit but
[1:32:43] God just showed me how it's gonna fit
[1:32:45] and this quote saying don't don't smutty
[1:32:49] up this message with your life don't you
[1:32:53] bring any smut on this message your
[1:32:58] decisions that you make don't bring smut
[1:33:00] on the message don't cause people to
[1:33:04] speak evil of this message because of
[1:33:06] your decisions can God find 10 righteous
[1:33:13] 10 you know you go down to your look and
[1:33:18] he couldn't find him and even in life
[1:33:20] even in lost own house full of them came
[1:33:26] out but only three made it out it showed
[1:33:29] what was in his wife's heart you know
[1:33:31] all alone and and this is what we want
[1:33:33] to make sure our hearts are real pure
[1:33:35] and clean before God because you know
[1:33:38] just like people didn't make it in that
[1:33:40] day people and make it a North day it's
[1:33:41] going to be folk that hang I'll make it
[1:33:42] today but and David stay just getting
[1:33:45] back to this point David David got as
[1:33:48] his heart swole up and they begin the
[1:33:50] number the people and when we look in
[1:33:52] the scripture one script to say that God
[1:33:54] pretty much anointed him to do that
[1:33:55] another script to say the devil
[1:33:57] anointing
[1:33:57] to do that well why does the scripture
[1:33:59] say that it's not it's not a to me it's
[1:34:03] not a discrepancy there's a reason
[1:34:05] because in every decision that you make
[1:34:07] guess what God is there in that decision
[1:34:10] and Satan is also there in that decision
[1:34:13] hallelujah so you got to watch the
[1:34:15] decisions that you're making you don't
[1:34:16] you want to make sure that what have you
[1:34:17] doing you bring an honor and glory to
[1:34:20] God hallelujah as we go on God got
[1:34:23] punished
[1:34:25] David for that decision and there were
[1:34:27] people that died there was a plague that
[1:34:29] struck and there were people that died
[1:34:30] but God had a very specific place that
[1:34:33] he wanted David to go to in order to
[1:34:36] stay the hand of the Death Angel and
[1:34:38] when they told him to go to a ruinous
[1:34:41] threshing floor and one in one
[1:34:43] scriptures call it it calls a morula
[1:34:44] another scripture calls him Oren and
[1:34:47] it's the same man prays a little bit he
[1:34:49] said go to that threshing floor because
[1:34:51] that threshing floor where a man where
[1:34:54] where the plague of death was staying
[1:34:56] was the exact same place Calvary would
[1:34:59] be it was the same place Abraham would
[1:35:02] offer Isaac all of this was the same
[1:35:03] place and we know when Jesus Christ was
[1:35:06] offered the plague of death a man was
[1:35:08] stayed from mankind the last enemy that
[1:35:11] was conquered was death
[1:35:14] Jesus did that for us so you know after
[1:35:17] you know after we go through all that
[1:35:18] you know the last thing a man now that
[1:35:21] would come because a I mean David was
[1:35:24] not able to build a temple for God but
[1:35:27] David deal built didn't build an altar
[1:35:29] for God and but Solomon is the one that
[1:35:33] comes along now and he builds the temple
[1:35:35] for God in a rulest threshing floor all
[1:35:40] right now let's go on a little further
[1:35:41] here that's where we are okay so I want
[1:35:46] to read here from this message
[1:35:48] dedication dedication paragraph 29 it
[1:35:52] says we're very very familiar with the
[1:35:54] reading of these set scriptures that we
[1:35:57] want to speak on for a few moments now
[1:35:59] David under desire I want you to catch
[1:36:02] this under desire and revelation thought
[1:36:05] in his heart a very gallant thing when
[1:36:08] they that being a
[1:36:09] man and well-loved with the people and
[1:36:11] God had blessed him in so many ways and
[1:36:14] it said now is it right that I sit here
[1:36:16] in a nice home that the Lord has given
[1:36:19] me in the Ark of the Covenant of my god
[1:36:21] out there under curtains that was a very
[1:36:23] gallant thing it was a revelation for
[1:36:26] David to know this because it wasn't
[1:36:29] just right for him to have such a lovely
[1:36:32] place under the Hat under the house made
[1:36:34] of cedar which was a very expensive
[1:36:36] place and said then the Ark of the
[1:36:40] Covenant my God who gave me all these
[1:36:42] things is still out there under the tent
[1:36:45] and Nathan the prophet knowing that God
[1:36:47] was with David he said David do all that
[1:36:49] sin of your heart but God is with you
[1:36:51] otherwise when God gives you a
[1:36:52] revelation
[1:36:53] I like that carry it out when God gives
[1:36:56] you a revelation carry it out don't let
[1:36:59] nothing stop you from doing what God
[1:37:02] told you to do when God gives you a
[1:37:06] revelation carry it out listen he said
[1:37:08] he says but that but that was all
[1:37:10] working in that night the Lord came to
[1:37:12] the seer and the prophet Nathan and said
[1:37:15] go tell my servant David see I like that
[1:37:17] Oh in other words I admire his courage
[1:37:20] and his thoughts of me to build me a
[1:37:23] place but he said I haven't dwelt in the
[1:37:26] house I haven't had a place to stay when
[1:37:28] I come down the earth can you imagine
[1:37:30] that I haven't had a place to stay when
[1:37:32] I come down to earth to look my people
[1:37:34] over I haven't had a place to stay ever
[1:37:36] since I brought up Israel since I
[1:37:39] haven't commanded any of the judges to
[1:37:41] build me a house of cedar but I have
[1:37:43] went from tent to tent that isn't that
[1:37:46] isn't just about the form of it today I
[1:37:48] went from tent to tent and from place to
[1:37:51] place to meet with my people
[1:37:52] he said go tell David as the scripture
[1:37:55] further reads I took you from the sheet
[1:37:58] coat out there following them few sheep
[1:38:00] of sheep of your father's and I made you
[1:38:02] a name like a great man that's in the
[1:38:05] earth I cut off your enemies from from
[1:38:07] the right side to the left side I love
[1:38:09] you David and I know that your desires
[1:38:12] is right I know that your ambitions is
[1:38:15] loyal and I know that you love me and I
[1:38:18] want to go on a little further so as you
[1:38:21] can see
[1:38:22] the storms how David is constant
[1:38:26] thinking of God to many of us today
[1:38:29] think of our own achievements something
[1:38:33] that we could do to better ourself but
[1:38:35] David was constantly thinking of what he
[1:38:39] could do for God
[1:38:41] oh I want to hang out there for a little
[1:38:45] bit
[1:38:46] now I'm gonna hang out there for a
[1:38:48] little bit let's let's let's just think
[1:38:51] about this now he says you can see the
[1:38:54] songs right how David is constant
[1:38:57] thinking of God to many of us today
[1:38:59] think of our own achievements something
[1:39:02] that we could do to better ourselves but
[1:39:04] David was constantly thinking of what
[1:39:06] God what he could do for God now on your
[1:39:08] list of goals for next year I'd like to
[1:39:13] ask you do you got anything on there
[1:39:15] that talked about how you can do more
[1:39:17] for God is there anything on the list
[1:39:20] are that all about you and what you try
[1:39:23] and achieve and what you're trying to
[1:39:24] accomplish is is that all your girls got
[1:39:27] is just you you you get that very
[1:39:29] selfish a man sometime you need to look
[1:39:32] up and see I mean like brother Adam
[1:39:33] talked about the the peach sitting
[1:39:35] underneath the trip the apple tree he
[1:39:37] always got his hair down looking at the
[1:39:39] apples a many a cousin there's another
[1:39:42] athlete gap that when they eat old man
[1:39:44] another win a fifth but the problem with
[1:39:46] the peak he never looked up to see where
[1:39:49] the apples are coming from and it's time
[1:39:51] for us to stop and look up to see where
[1:39:54] our blessings we're coming from I want
[1:39:59] you to look at look at David I want you
[1:40:02] after I mean here you know I want I want
[1:40:06] to just I want to make a couple comments
[1:40:07] here you know there's nothing wrong cuz
[1:40:10] some some of us got some you know some
[1:40:11] really really big goals that you know
[1:40:13] something gonna graduate collagen in the
[1:40:15] next year some gonna graduate high
[1:40:17] school sometimes you know start some
[1:40:19] other businesses don't god I mean it's
[1:40:21] gonna be a lot that happened in the next
[1:40:22] year I know God get ready to do that
[1:40:24] sake but in the midst of whatever God's
[1:40:26] doing
[1:40:27] amen I want to make sure that he is
[1:40:28] still in first place
[1:40:32] amen he has to be in first place and
[1:40:35] whatever it whatever happens what if
[1:40:37] whatever your career decision is God got
[1:40:40] to remain in first place listen I wrote
[1:40:45] this say it's okay to desire career
[1:40:46] nothing wrong with that nothing wrong
[1:40:48] that it's okay to desire success but the
[1:40:52] Prophet said the beats expect to be
[1:40:54] successful is to stay in line with God's
[1:40:57] promises it's okay to desire success but
[1:41:00] to be successful is to stay in line with
[1:41:03] God's promises I want to say this
[1:41:06] whatever career you choose and and let
[1:41:08] me tell you I know that you know
[1:41:09] sometimes you can go to some places and
[1:41:11] then they just discourage you from you
[1:41:13] know from from some of the gifts that
[1:41:15] you have in you you know God has
[1:41:16] anointed people to be doctors and
[1:41:18] there's nothing wrong with being a
[1:41:20] doctor God has anointed people to be
[1:41:22] engineers there's nothing wrong with
[1:41:24] being an engineer hallelujah
[1:41:27] that's not wrong with owning the Walmart
[1:41:30] it's nothing wrong with that I mean you
[1:41:32] know I think anybody striving for
[1:41:34] success I think that's great but you got
[1:41:37] to keep God in first place listen since
[1:41:41] I whatever career you choose do it for
[1:41:44] the glory of God even and all that you
[1:41:47] achieve never lose sight of your pursuit
[1:41:49] of God right we know and I'm not just
[1:41:53] this just something the Lord put on my
[1:41:55] heart so we know what you're doing in
[1:41:56] school and what you're doing in business
[1:41:58] but what are you doing for Christ right
[1:42:03] the talents that you have the talents
[1:42:06] that you've been given for success in
[1:42:07] business should also be equally you
[1:42:11] ditch to God's divine purpose the
[1:42:17] talents that God has given you to be
[1:42:19] able to be a blessing and in the baby to
[1:42:21] get get income it should be equally
[1:42:25] then I'm going further equally yielded
[1:42:28] to God's divine purpose God don't bless
[1:42:31] you to pull you away from him that ain't
[1:42:35] that ain't a blessing hallelujah glory
[1:42:40] to God that day I mean I always tell you
[1:42:42] that you know if you don't give you you
[1:42:43] have to watch how you share your
[1:42:44] testimony and everything in a testimony
[1:42:47] you gotta watch that if I come up here
[1:42:50] and tell y'all that God just blessed me
[1:42:52] with my my name's an opportunity and I
[1:42:53] never thought I'd be able to have but
[1:42:55] you know where church with this

[1:43:21] expectations for me and not for yourself

[1:43:31] traffic got to go both ways right

[1:43:35] that there's so much more to do for the
[1:43:38] kingdom of God and we got we got to make
[1:43:42] sure that we are applying ourselves to
[1:43:44] God's divine purpose for life amen
[1:43:47] right the careers not to God God just
[1:43:51] blessed you with talents to be able to
[1:43:52] enter to that field but don't let that
[1:43:54] become your gods

[1:47:10] one of one of Jesse's boys to be king
[1:47:13] and and everybody done went through the
[1:47:15] line and and it was noted everybody so
[1:47:17] daddy said he had one more boy you were
[1:47:19] the last one
[1:47:20] come on you can see him just dragon and
[1:47:24] Here Come David just walk it in the
[1:47:26] house look like nothing he was not the
[1:47:29] he was not the the a person that you
[1:47:32] would call successful he didn't have
[1:47:35] that look about him but here here come
[1:47:37] here come here come David walking in the
[1:47:38] house and as he walks in the house the
[1:47:40] anointing struck the proposition rise up
[1:47:43] this is he and before he could even get
[1:47:47] the oil just trying to get just trying
[1:47:51] to lift the oil up oil seeping all he
[1:47:54] trying to control the oil nah you know
[1:47:57] or just before you can even put it all
[1:47:59] David see we see when we look at that
[1:48:03] and say I took you from the sheet when
[1:48:06] nobody thought nothing about you we
[1:48:09] didn't even think anything about
[1:48:11] yourself I took you from the coke
[1:48:15] and I made you King don't forget where
[1:48:18] you came from
[1:48:20] don't you ever forget where you came
[1:48:22] from you didn't have that confidence
[1:48:24] before I gave you that confidence and
[1:48:28] the reason you got the confidence
[1:48:30] because of trials that you went through
[1:48:31] gave you that type of confidence look at
[1:48:36] this
[1:48:39] david was free anointed king and it took
[1:48:43] him a few years now before he became
[1:48:45] king number of years but i want out but
[1:48:48] when david became king this is something
[1:48:50] Lord gave me David had reached the
[1:48:53] pinnacle of success I want you to get
[1:48:58] that when David became King if I could
[1:49:01] put this way when David became president
[1:49:03] when David became CEO when David became
[1:49:07] all this he had reached the pinnacle of
[1:49:09] success there was no high authority in
[1:49:12] the land than the king cuz imma get
[1:49:16] y'all got goals y'all want to be yeah
[1:49:18] you know yeah you know you don't want to
[1:49:20] just you want to own the business not
[1:49:21] just work at the business thing then
[1:49:23] roll it that right that gonna make you
[1:49:25] the CEO the head person in charge right
[1:49:28] you go you gonna do God you gonna be
[1:49:30] alright Act but when David reached this
[1:49:33] pinnacle I want you to think about
[1:49:36] something he was a shepherd a musician a
[1:49:41] songwriter a warrior but now a king and
[1:49:48] even though he achieve being king he
[1:49:54] still had desires to do more for God I
[1:50:00] want that to sink in even though he
[1:50:03] reached his high level of success David
[1:50:07] still had desires to do more for God
[1:50:10] that's why I save God is first place
[1:50:13] that's gonna be the first thing you
[1:50:14] think about not the last thing you're
[1:50:17] gonna put God in this proper place
[1:50:20] JCPenney made a statement and I don't
[1:50:24] have the direct words but he say anytime
[1:50:26] this business got ahead of him making
[1:50:28] the church he knew something's wrong
[1:50:30] with the business I'm not talking about
[1:50:32] Sunday morning church JC Penney went to
[1:50:34] church during the week so if it was
[1:50:36] called to him to miss service during the
[1:50:38] week he do something that went wrong JC
[1:50:43] Penney now you know I used to wonder why
[1:50:46] JC Penney was still hanging in there at
[1:50:47] the palm be smile before they did what
[1:50:49] they did that was a the last anchor
[1:50:51] store there
[1:50:52] man was honoring God while chick-fil-a
[1:50:55] so blessed today they honoring God there
[1:51:00] used to be a time Publix weren't even
[1:51:02] open on Sundays right but you know we
[1:51:06] got to get we got to put God back in his
[1:51:09] proper place
[1:51:10] now I'm when I'm when I'm when I'm
[1:51:12] showing here is that David even though
[1:51:14] he reached this pinnacle of success yes
[1:51:17] he used to be a shepherd he used to be a
[1:51:19] musician used to be a song right it was
[1:51:21] a warrior now King but you know when he
[1:51:23] became a king he was still going out to
[1:51:24] battle his men had to stop him from
[1:51:27] battling that mean he still had the
[1:51:29] warrior nature inside of them
[1:51:30] you know David was still writing songs
[1:51:33] after he became King do you know after
[1:51:35] he reached that success he was still
[1:51:37] playing music
[1:51:38] I'm asking what have you put God in his
[1:51:41] proper place those are the things that
[1:51:43] we used to do I'm talking about the
[1:51:47] phone we got bless his things we used to
[1:51:51] do that God try my call that guy cuz
[1:51:54] when God gives a give he don't take it
[1:51:56] away even though achieved this he still
[1:52:06] had desire to do more for God and see
[1:52:09] what I said what the Lord gave me say
[1:52:10] the see you see the more God blesses you
[1:52:14] the more you should want to bless him
[1:52:18] I'm not just making this stuff let's
[1:52:20] let's read a few scriptures because that
[1:52:22] quote said you can see in the Psalms how
[1:52:25] David is constant thank God
[1:52:28] let's just read just a few of now you
[1:52:30] know it's 150 Psalms we can't read them
[1:52:33] all but you can read just a couple of
[1:52:35] treatments let's go let's go to Psalm 27
[1:52:39] verse 4 and verse 5 see we're talking
[1:52:44] about desires and and things of that
[1:52:46] nature right I mean God said he knew
[1:52:48] what Davis desires was but look at this
[1:52:52] look at look at look at look at look at
[1:52:53] Davis desire Psalm 27 verse 4 through 5

[1:53:19] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:53:23] of the Lord all the days of my life and
[1:53:26] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:53:29] enquire in his temple he goes on say

[1:53:34] me in this pavilion in the secret of his
[1:53:37] Tabernacle Shelly hide me he shall set
[1:53:40] me up upon the rock that come through

[1:55:56] the guy that people is already
[1:55:57] worshipping people are already in that
[1:55:59] channel right I mean that that's the way
[1:56:01] we suppose approach the house of God you
[1:56:03] said yeah 30 ahead of time my 30
[1:56:09] minutes after time 30 minutes ahead of

[1:56:15] approached to say I was glad when they
[1:56:16] said unto me let us go to the house well
[1:56:18] that means David got something that
[1:56:21] started bubbling up and they said Church
[1:56:23] time it weren't like oh I got to do that
[1:56:26] again you know church again no no no no
[1:56:28] I can't wait to get to the service and
[1:56:30] I'm gonna tell you if you got that type
[1:56:32] of attitude that church again you're not
[1:56:34] doing nothing to create no atmosphere
[1:56:39] can I go in a little further this one
[1:56:43] this I won't read all this but I'll just
[1:56:45] give you a synopsis son and Psalm 73
[1:56:49] David was looking at how to whisper
[1:56:51] procced
[1:56:52] the wicked prosper he was pretty you
[1:56:55] know he's looking at that and sometime
[1:56:56] you get the looking at how wicked people
[1:56:58] that don't serve God prosper and you and
[1:57:01] it kind of gives you they give you their
[1:57:03] you read eBooks a how they succeeded and
[1:57:05] God ain't nowhere in they plans but we
[1:57:08] don't try to follow everything that they
[1:57:09] do in order to be successful you can't
[1:57:11] do it that way you can only take bits
[1:57:14] and pieces from them not all of you
[1:57:16] can't you cannot take all of it right so
[1:57:18] so here David looking at how to wicked a
[1:57:20] prospering how much Monday making and
[1:57:21] you know and and and then the Bible said
[1:57:24] and and seventy in the some semi through
[1:57:26] verse 2 it said that his foot almost
[1:57:28] slipped in 2017
[1:57:31] your foot almost slipped but see if you
[1:57:36] keep going on in that chapter in chapter
[1:57:39] 7 3 he said
[1:57:40] now the reason that have put in slip is
[1:57:42] because he went to church and in verse
[1:57:45] 17 said then I understood there in now
[1:57:49] he didn't understand the wicked sin
[1:57:50] until he got to church that's why he was
[1:57:54] happy to go to church if that's where
[1:57:57] God go speak to you at church this is
[1:58:04] the way David as a king approach God now
[1:58:09] let's just read psalm 118 let's start at
[1:58:11] verse 14 I told you I couldn't read a mo
[1:58:16] but David is always constantly
[1:58:18] reflecting and thinking of God this is a
[1:58:20] man that has achieved success and you
[1:58:26] know and he is the king now that the
[1:58:29] hair guy of the nation actually the top
[1:58:32] King that ever reigned in Israel's
[1:58:36] history is David and let's look at this
[1:58:39] in Psalms 118 as we just move over to
[1:58:41] verse 14 look at what he says he says
[1:58:45] the Lord is my strength and song and is
[1:58:51] become my salvation alone baloney you
[1:58:55] know as you know you just look at you
[1:58:57] look at these words if they're very
[1:58:59] powerful says the voice of rejoicing and
[1:59:02] salvation is in the Tabernacles or the
[1:59:04] righteous the right hand of the Lord do
[1:59:05] with valiantly the right hand of the
[1:59:09] Lord is exalted the right hand of the
[1:59:11] Lord doeth valiantly it says I shall not
[1:59:15] die but live and declare the works of
[1:59:18] the Lord glory says the lord hath
[1:59:21] chasing me store but he have not given
[1:59:23] me over unto death and I like this look
[1:59:26] at what the after his trials after his
[1:59:28] tribulations look at what he says he's
[1:59:30] not talking about giving up and quitting
[1:59:31] he says open to me the gates of
[1:59:34] righteousness I will go into them and I
[1:59:36] will when I get there now that's what
[1:59:40] I'm doing I get through them gates the
[1:59:42] righteous I will praise the Lord and
[1:59:44] I'm not coming to sit on the servers I
[1:59:47] come to add something to the service I
[1:59:48] will praise the Lord says this gave an
[1:59:52] order to which the righteous shall enter
[1:59:55] I will praise thee for thou hast hurt me
[1:59:57] and art to come last salvation and he
[2:00:00] goes on say the stone which the builders
[2:00:02] refused is become the headstone of the
[2:00:05] corner this everything that happened to
[2:00:09] me this year all my success all my
[2:00:13] achievements all my overcoming every
[2:00:19] time I I mean when I looked and saw this

[2:03:08] the LORD hath me we will rejoice and be
[2:03:13] glad in it you know there there's a
[2:03:16] number of scriptures that we could go
[2:03:18] back to and look at but when I when I
[2:03:21] stopped there at verse 22 where it said
[2:03:27] the stone which the builders refuses
[2:03:28] become the headstone the corner that
[2:03:29] took me because you know that let me
[2:03:31] just also just mention this we we we
[2:03:35] gotta turn a corner now in the sermon
[2:03:37] and see brother Branham said that any
[2:03:41] brick mason can just lay bricks anybody
[2:03:45] can do that just for brick I mean it
[2:03:47] actually don't even take a brick mason
[2:03:48] he said that don't take any man could
[2:03:50] just lay brick top the brick on top of
[2:03:53] brick top of brick but when we turn the
[2:03:55] corner he say you need a real brick
[2:03:57] mason that know what they doin to be
[2:04:00] able to turn a corner well we get rid of
[2:04:02] turn a corner we going into another year
[2:04:03] now you know we raise some octaves but
[2:04:06] was more than just one octave it's more
[2:04:11] as more than one octave you can so we
[2:04:13] don't keep raising in the next year all
[2:04:16] right look at this look at this
[2:04:19] David had it in his heart to build God a
[2:04:25] temple but God told him said no David
[2:04:28] you can't build a temple you shed too
[2:04:30] much blood and and and he said but I'm
[2:04:33] gonna I'm gonna raise up your seed and
[2:04:35] that seed will actually be the one that
[2:04:38] will build the temple and we all know
[2:04:40] that Solomon was the one that was raised
[2:04:42] up a man to build the temple now even
[2:04:46] though David was told that he couldn't
[2:04:47] build a temple the the Prophet already
[2:04:49] told him said David go and do what is in
[2:04:52] your heart because God is with you now
[2:04:54] even though he was told he couldn't
[2:04:55] build a temple yes he built an altar but
[2:04:57] he couldn't build the exact temple that
[2:04:59] did not stop David from making
[2:05:01] preparation for building the temple and
[2:05:05] if you go back to first Quranic who's 22
[2:05:08] we don't have time to read all this but
[2:05:09] David gathered workers and they were
[2:05:12] workers for actually but even though he
[2:05:14] wasn't building he still had the workers
[2:05:16] lined up to build a temple right David
[2:05:19] are charged his son Solomon with the
[2:05:22] responsibility of building the temple
[2:05:24] and all that David of his own substance
[2:05:28] David gave 100,000 gallons of gold
[2:05:33] towards the building of the temple and
[2:05:35] he also gave 1 million talents of silver
[2:05:38] towards the building of the temple so
[2:05:39] even though he did not himself build the
[2:05:42] temple he made preparation for the
[2:05:45] temple to be built there's some things
[2:05:49] you might not you know necessarily be
[2:05:51] called to do but you can make
[2:05:52] preparation for somebody else to do it
[2:05:55] Oh hallelujah glory to God you can make
[2:06:03] preparation to see you know i'ma just
[2:06:05] borrow this and the sister she didn't I
[2:06:08] won't call a name but what her heart was
[2:06:10] is that she wanted to be a blessing to
[2:06:15] missions that's what God put on her I
[2:06:19] want to
[2:06:19] missions so when she would make a
[2:06:22] certain amount she say Lord I'm gonna if
[2:06:25] I could put that much and tithe I'm also
[2:06:27] gonna put that much in missions if I can
[2:06:33] put that much in time I can put it in
[2:06:36] mission and you know what God did
[2:06:39] blessed so she could do it all over flow
[2:06:43] because she had the right desire you
[2:06:50] know that might oh I'm gonna just leave
[2:06:51] that alone I'm not gonna go there y'all
[2:06:53] know when the preacher start talk about
[2:06:54] tired everybody start you know choking
[2:06:57] up but when I say that I'm trying to
[2:06:59] show you how to get blessed you know you
[2:07:03] don't realize I mean some last week we
[2:07:05] cut back on God as God give us more we
[2:07:08] cut back Oh
[2:07:10] how you gonna get a million dollars you
[2:07:14] can't even handle you know you know how
[2:07:15] there's we get if I got $100 that's easy
[2:07:18] to me to give God ten I get a thousand
[2:07:23] you know it's your tie this on a
[2:07:25] thousand it's not ten it's not ten
[2:07:29] you know how do you know God gave a
[2:07:32] couple thousand you got my ten dollars
[2:07:34] oh that's well yeah announcer so far
[2:07:38] right that's so you don't do it that way
[2:07:40] ten percent of what you make what God
[2:07:43] gave you that's what you give back to
[2:07:44] God you keep 90 percent give God 10% so
[2:07:48] God give you a thousand give him 100 if
[2:07:50] he give you ten thousand you give him
[2:07:53] one thousand and he gives you a hundred
[2:07:56] thousand I know that's gone right now
[2:07:59] you know how people get come on right in
[2:08:01] a check for $10,000 you behalf okay
[2:08:04] that's a church then go get my money it
[2:08:08] ain't your money in the first place
[2:08:12] [Applause]
[2:08:17] it's each of you to receive a hundred
[2:08:20] thousand but it's hard for you to give
[2:08:22] God ten thousand see your heart is not
[2:08:25] in the right place that's why you can't
[2:08:29] get less I know some people that done Oh
[2:08:31] Lord together
[2:08:33] people aren't wrote eyes on what they
[2:08:35] expecting God to give them all right I'm
[2:08:45] moving forward David made preparation he
[2:08:54] knew he wouldn't be the one building but
[2:08:55] he still made preparation for the
[2:08:57] building of this temple and and when
[2:09:01] they begin to build this temple you know
[2:09:04] the Bible says a couple of things here
[2:09:06] let me I'm gonna just read something
[2:09:07] real quick I won't read this Oh Cora
[2:09:09] Graham said Solomon was a man of peace
[2:09:10] of wisdom he didn't go to war like David
[2:09:12] and had a lot of bloodshed he was he was
[2:09:15] just a man of peace and God gave him
[2:09:18] wisdom when he was actual what he made
[2:09:19] of the for God he only asked for wisdom
[2:09:21] to know how to lead his people and he
[2:09:23] never taken the great gifts that could
[2:09:25] have been done but he just asked for
[2:09:27] wisdom to know how to lead God's people
[2:09:29] to the best and and and and you know
[2:09:32] there's a statement for the Graham
[2:09:34] Sonesta where passage it want to be
[2:09:35] always lead God's people to the best
[2:09:39] amen
[2:09:40] I want you to be blessed I want you to
[2:09:43] be blessed I like seeing y'all in new
[2:09:44] cars I like seeing that any man ain't
[2:09:47] saying go get in-depth but but I like
[2:09:51] seeing you bless prays alone glory to
[2:09:54] God yeah just something I can't even get
[2:09:57] to where people actually like to see the
[2:10:00] past in a jalopy they feel like he's
[2:10:05] humble in a jalopy got the chick one
[2:10:10] don't open it if that don't slide and
[2:10:13] people let the window down and climb a
[2:10:15] window I can't believe but rather see
[2:10:19] the pastor like that but they riding
[2:10:21] fine
[2:10:23] you're hurting right you're hurting rain
[2:10:27] amen amen
[2:10:29] now not all people like that there's
[2:10:30] some people that want to bless the
[2:10:31] pastor they said Lord at the pastor been
[2:10:35] faithful and I want to be a blessing to
[2:10:36] the pastor hey man that's some folk like
[2:10:38] that and the ones that's like that God
[2:10:40] gonna bless them so they can be a
[2:10:42] blessing and when they bless y'all don't
[2:10:44] get jealous
[2:10:44] I'm yes I'm gonna enjoy what yes I am
[2:10:47] yes I'm just letting you know right now
[2:10:49] yes yes I am yes I am your CEO enjoy it
[2:11:00] and you don't talk about him so stop
[2:11:02] talking about me praise the Lord all
[2:11:09] right
[2:11:10] Sodom was a man of peace of wisdom he
[2:11:12] didn't go to war that's why he was able
[2:11:14] to build this house God established him
[2:11:17] to the house but the work the name
[2:11:19] Solomon actually meant peace peaceable
[2:11:22] perfect or that recompense is he rewards
[2:11:26] or repays right peaceable perfect that's
[2:11:28] what his name meant and when David had
[2:11:31] given him the the charge to go build a
[2:11:35] temple there were some things that
[2:11:36] happen when he built the temple a man
[2:11:38] first thing and I'm reading I'm just
[2:11:40] kind of quoting a number of things from
[2:11:41] the message dedication but these are
[2:11:44] some things that the prophecy says the
[2:11:46] material that he was building when it
[2:11:48] wasn't found only in Palestine right
[2:11:51] this material was coming from all over
[2:11:53] and the good thing about the when the
[2:11:57] material was coming from all over a man
[2:11:59] when it got to where it where was
[2:12:02] supposed to be in Jerusalem somehow the
[2:12:04] material without a hammer without
[2:12:08] without a without a nail a man if a
[2:12:10] stone came from this country and a stone
[2:12:12] came from that country when they start
[2:12:14] put them together the stones just fit
[2:12:18] there was no chiseling there were there
[2:12:21] was nothing that they had to do just
[2:12:23] just put the stones on top of each other
[2:12:25] and they just fit but you know but
[2:12:28] before they start putting the stones on
[2:12:29] top again they saw one little stone that
[2:12:32] they thought that they did need so they
[2:12:34] took this stone and they kick
[2:12:36] / Louie stay with me here they kept the
[2:12:40] stolen in the we pile but but as the
[2:12:42] other stalls are just kind of coming
[2:12:44] from here coming it they just putting
[2:12:45] everything together now the proper
[2:12:47] census the materials not found only a
[2:12:49] Palestine he says it's like today
[2:12:51] there's one place that redwood has found
[2:12:54] say that's in California it says and
[2:12:57] there's one place they call in Africa on
[2:12:59] a muscle being there's a famous work
[2:13:01] there that's called stink wallet it says
[2:13:04] has never found nowhere else but there
[2:13:06] so so what will that's telling me that
[2:13:08] there are same things grow in certain
[2:13:09] places and God were allowed to grow in
[2:13:13] that environment for a season and then
[2:13:16] at the right time he'll pull it from
[2:13:17] there and pull it from here and bring it
[2:13:19] together and they begin to grow
[2:13:22] hallelujah you had to go through certain
[2:13:25] trials in certain churches you had to go
[2:13:27] through certain trials by you in the
[2:13:29] world but there was coming a time that
[2:13:31] God will begin to unite and put some
[2:13:33] things together Oh
[2:13:36] once things are together that's when you
[2:13:38] begin to see your norton flow come on
[2:13:41] somebody
[2:13:42] hallelujah that's what we've been seeing
[2:13:44] a man in this / here there's no to flow
[2:13:47] because God has brought these things
[2:13:49] together and the gifts just that nobody
[2:13:54] trying to make themselves something they
[2:13:56] give just fish look at this you said
[2:14:05] Solomon while he was building the temple
[2:14:07] he never very one bit from the pattern
[2:14:10] that Moses saw at Mount Sinai he stayed
[2:14:14] with the pattern and brother Adam say
[2:14:16] that's that's that's for us today cuz we
[2:14:18] should never leave scripture just stay
[2:14:20] with him he says Moses he said he says I
[2:14:24] said whatever God gave Moses psalmist
[2:14:26] David say and whatever God gave the
[2:14:28] first church the church at Pentecost we
[2:14:33] should pattern ourselves in the same
[2:14:36] manner I like that right because see if
[2:14:39] if they had gifts of prophecy and gifts
[2:14:42] of tongues and gifts of interpretations
[2:14:44] in the first church then this search is
[2:14:46] pattern to have the exact same thing
[2:14:49] if they had casting out Devils then this
[2:14:52] church's pattern to be able to do the
[2:14:54] exact same thing if they had signs
[2:14:57] wonders and miracles then this church's
[2:15:00] pattern to do the very same thing
[2:15:03] without stay with the original
[2:15:05] blueprints he says every little stone
[2:15:09] fit its place no matter where it was cut
[2:15:12] from where when it came together it fit
[2:15:16] his place it says oh what a tight there
[2:15:19] we find of the spiritual how they that
[2:15:21] every gift of God every odd act of
[2:15:24] born-again Christian because some of you
[2:15:26] like why they do that why they act like
[2:15:29] that
[2:15:30] Oh God gave him that nature for a reason
[2:15:32] see there's there's at certain times
[2:15:34] where that nature gonna come up and
[2:15:38] you'll see why you needed it
[2:15:39] oh all right let me break that down put
[2:15:44] it on y'all on y'all on the level that
[2:15:46] everybody can get somebody I told my
[2:15:50] wife one time so you've missed your
[2:15:52] calling
[2:15:53] yeah why so you should have been a
[2:15:56] lawyer that's where they told you you
[2:15:58] should have employed because she can
[2:16:00] take a point and she can make her points
[2:16:01] off that point so you know there's been
[2:16:05] times where I had different people
[2:16:06] calling me bout some bills now we've
[2:16:09] given my answer
[2:16:10] she told y'all hi I am right I'm free to
[2:16:13] meet God just you know I'm just trying
[2:16:14] to work with you sometimes a devil you
[2:16:16] know disturb me sometime
[2:16:22] as telling the brothers we were out to
[2:16:26] eat the other night and we just walked
[2:16:30] him alone and I'm halfway up the steps
[2:16:32] and and I hear my wife down there
[2:16:36] talking to somebody and well who's she
[2:16:38] talking to you know it's just saying
[2:16:40] saying something to God well let me I
[2:16:42] can't see what this was photo and I see
[2:16:45] he just busted in cussing and you
[2:16:50] talking to now you know and he going on
[2:16:52] and on and and and said look man my
[2:16:56] momma almost failed my wife almost

[2:18:58] type of where we found the spiritual how
[2:19:00] that every gift of God every odd act of
[2:19:03] born-again Christians and their
[2:19:05] peculiarities yet is God is God his
[2:19:08] place it fits in the body and what I was

[2:19:50] that gift gonna be used see sometimes
[2:19:52] you got some odd strange things about
[2:19:54] you too you know let me just let me just
[2:19:57] say this let me just see this because we
[2:19:59] spent so much time working trying to
[2:20:02] work on other people you shouldn't do
[2:20:06] this

[2:20:19] spent so much time you know they
[2:20:21] shouldn't do this they shouldn't but
[2:20:22] Ruby I mean but look at you I have a
[2:20:25] brother come to my office you know
[2:20:27] earlier this year telling me what a
[2:20:28] certain sister shouldn't do she
[2:20:30] shouldn't do this she shouldn't do that
[2:20:31] she should do because she did she say
[2:20:35] I'm thinking with this old arrogant
[2:20:37] spirit that you got I mean when you're
[2:20:41] gonna start praying and stop talking
[2:20:43] because all you do is you stir up
[2:20:45] trouble I can see that right now you
[2:20:47] just a troublemaker and God don't like
[2:20:50] that spirit either he hate the spirit of
[2:20:52] this court you want to stop spending so
[2:20:59] much time amen on social media trying to
[2:21:02] find everybody false worried about y'all
[2:21:07] all right I'm going on let's see listen
[2:21:11] don't those when those stones came they
[2:21:14] they was fitting in the place and and
[2:21:16] and and as they but you know they got to
[2:21:18] a certain spot and this is what the
[2:21:20] prophets saying that all of us have come
[2:21:22] from different places different
[2:21:23] backgrounds different countries but
[2:21:25] we've come to this spot and we make this
[2:21:27] church what it is and each one with our
[2:21:29] unique gifts we all add something to the
[2:21:32] body we need your stone the building
[2:21:36] won't be complete without your stone
[2:21:38] we need your stone praise the Lord
[2:21:41] just surrender your throne the gods
[2:21:43] right but we need what you got in order
[2:21:47] to complete the building it goes on
[2:21:50] steady state and in this building there
[2:21:52] was one stone that was actually too odd
[2:21:53] to fool with so the builders rejected to
[2:21:56] see the hit then kicked us and over into
[2:21:57] the weave pile when they got the
[2:21:59] building almost complete them just this
[2:22:01] is what happened at Calvary when they
[2:22:04] got the building almost complete they
[2:22:05] looked around said man how come we
[2:22:06] missing one stone what's what's the one
[2:22:09] that you know what there's something
[2:22:10] missing in the building said we're
[2:22:12] missing one little piece here and in the
[2:22:14] scripture you know said that the stone
[2:22:16] which the builders refused had become
[2:22:18] the headstone another corner right it
[2:22:20] was the one that they refused that's the
[2:22:22] one that became their headstone of the
[2:22:23] corner and here here when they finally
[2:22:25] got a convinced like man where's this
[2:22:27] where's the stone that what does this
[2:22:28] say they went looking amongst all the
[2:22:30] other you know major stones instant man
[2:22:31] we can't find it and then somebody just
[2:22:33] happened to just go to the we bow to the
[2:22:36] junk pile and when they got over to the
[2:22:38] junk pile they looked and then they saw
[2:22:40] there's one odd-looking stone they
[2:22:41] pulled it out and they went and stuck
[2:22:43] that into the building and that that was
[2:22:45] the missing
[2:22:46] he's the one that they reject it was the
[2:22:47] missing piece can I we know Christ is to
[2:22:51] reject a stone we know that the brother
[2:22:56] Adam said when our builders today accept
[2:22:59] the rejected instead of pushing them off
[2:23:03] and called them a bunch of holy rollers
[2:23:05] the art ones that's making confession
[2:23:07] that much sooner the building will be
[2:23:08] completed so when they can accept the
[2:23:12] rejected I thought about that a little
[2:23:15] bit more because we have people
[2:23:16] rejecting the Prophet now you don't
[2:23:19] understand when you rejecting the
[2:23:21] Prophet you actually are rejecting
[2:23:23] Christ I know that one went down B I'm
[2:23:29] explaining it to you the children of
[2:23:32] Israel rejected the leadership of Samuel
[2:23:36] they wanted a king like the other
[2:23:41] nations and today people want titles
[2:23:45] like denominations they want to be
[2:23:49] called a pasta they want to be called
[2:23:51] prophet oh my even brother Branham
[2:23:54] didn't go around tall that called me
[2:23:56] prophet Branham he that he just called
[2:23:59] me brother hallelujah hey man so you
[2:24:03] know listen we can we can identify him
[2:24:04] just because the scriptures say he was a
[2:24:06] prophet but he didn't want no title oh
[2:24:08] my god amen
[2:24:10] anybody searchable titles that I mean
[2:24:12] it's the same thing and what would
[2:24:14] happen in sandals day when they reject
[2:24:17] the Samuel standard got he was so
[2:24:19] discouraged at the people doing this but
[2:24:21] God had a tongue say salmon they're not
[2:24:22] rejecting you the Prophet they not
[2:24:25] rejecting you they reject on me so you
[2:24:28] reject the naproxen you actually
[2:24:30] rejected Christ there's a statement that
[2:24:37] brother Branham makes when God sends a
[2:24:40] gift to the people who's talked about
[2:24:41] Solomon he said when God sends a gift to
[2:24:42] the people and they'll recognize it it's
[2:24:45] always a golden age but when they refuse
[2:24:49] it there's nothing left but chaos for
[2:24:52] that generation and then I ain't seeing
[2:24:55] a bunch of chaos I don't know what I'm
[2:24:56] seeing
[2:24:58] see so when you accept the rejected then
[2:25:03] the building to be completed they reject
[2:25:05] the Prophet they reject the prophets
[2:25:07] message they were they reject the people
[2:25:10] that believed the message and don't tell
[2:25:11] me they don't I know I know and I'm
[2:25:14] talking about Allen call people up hey
[2:25:16] let's go out and do this I'm busy okay
[2:25:19] no problem you busy this first time all
[2:25:21] right I'll try it again let's go out and
[2:25:22] do this oh I got this going on okay all
[2:25:25] right that's the second time okay let's
[2:25:27] let's try this
[2:25:28] every time I call it's an excuse now you
[2:25:32] can't say it's on me because that's
[2:25:33] right I haven't heard from you you've
[2:25:35] heard from me though and every time I
[2:25:37] call you you rejected me it's okay when
[2:25:40] you accept the rejected they're building
[2:25:42] to be completed after the building was
[2:25:48] completed the propagator was still an
[2:25:50] empty building and there was nothing in
[2:25:53] the building but furniture so Solomon
[2:25:56] had done all he could do now the great
[2:25:58] day of dedication come and when they
[2:25:59] were going to dedicate this building for
[2:26:01] worshippers to worship see this has all
[2:26:02] happened at Calvary when they were going
[2:26:04] to dedicate the building for worship
[2:26:07] this solomon's temple built there at
[2:26:10] Calvary when they went to dedicate that
[2:26:12] building for worship he says he says
[2:26:16] that the building for worship worshipers
[2:26:18] to worship something now without
[2:26:20] something there and worship the building
[2:26:21] would have been vain but when they
[2:26:24] dedicated the building for worship the
[2:26:27] Bible says that the minister stood up
[2:26:29] the fire of God fell and the minister
[2:26:32] could not stand to Minister that's what
[2:26:35] happened when they dedicated the
[2:26:37] building that Solomon built at Calvary
[2:26:39] for worship oh my well as we turn our
[2:26:45] corner we keep turning to remember
[2:26:48] there's a scripture here and in Acts
[2:26:51] chapter 7 because all this was a type of
[2:26:54] what happened with Solomon amen in
[2:26:57] building that temple in Acts chapter 7
[2:26:59] verse 27 says but Solomon built him a
[2:27:01] house howbeit the most high dwelleth not
[2:27:04] in temples made with hands as that the
[2:27:06] Prophet heaven is my throne and the
[2:27:09] earth is my footstool
[2:27:11] what house will ye bill me saith the
[2:27:15] Lord or what is the place of my wrists
[2:27:18] see Solomon's Temple was not the place
[2:27:20] of his rest
[2:27:21] and even though you know things was all
[2:27:23] in place and once they once they locked
[2:27:26] everything again man the power God fell
[2:27:29] down on the net but I'm telling some of
[2:27:30] the place of God's rest is your heart
[2:27:33] and once everything is in place once you
[2:27:36] once your your your your objectives are
[2:27:38] in place and your your your you know
[2:27:40] your heart is in the right place then
[2:27:42] guess what the same weight of pilla fire
[2:27:44] or the power God failed there for
[2:27:46] Solomon that staying power God wants to
[2:27:48] fall for us it did it on the day of
[2:27:51] Pentecost and whatever happened on the
[2:27:54] day of Pentecost it should still be
[2:27:55] happening in the church today look at
[2:27:58] this the Prophet says this there's a
[2:28:01] couple things as when we talked about in
[2:28:04] 2nd Samuel 7 I'm going back to that
[2:28:06] really quick but when we talk about when
[2:28:09] when I days be fulfilled verse 12 when I
[2:28:12] days been filmed I shall sleep with our
[2:28:13] fathers I was set up thy seed after the
[2:28:15] which shall proceed out of that bowels
[2:28:17] and I will establish his kingdom he
[2:28:19] should build an house for a name and I
[2:28:21] will establish the throne of his kingdom
[2:28:23] for every time Solomon's kingdom
[2:28:24] actually fail I mean his Solomon himself
[2:28:28] backs near so God was not building it on
[2:28:31] Solomon right Solomon's Temple was was
[2:28:34] knocked down it was rebuilt but even
[2:28:36] when after his rebuilt
[2:28:38] you know Jesus prophesied that there one
[2:28:40] day would be no stone upon another it
[2:28:42] was still that temple was gonna fall so
[2:28:44] that was not the temple God was talking
[2:28:46] about when he made David this promise
[2:28:49] let's go on a little further now we can
[2:28:51] see some things because this temple that
[2:28:53] God was talking about if I could just
[2:28:56] pull up 1st Corinthians 6 and 19 part of
[2:29:01] this temple that God is talking about
[2:29:04] says what know you not that your body
[2:29:09] is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is
[2:29:14] in you which ye have of God and ye are
[2:29:19] not your own
[2:29:20] so this this this this is this final
[2:29:24] resting place of God it's inside of you
[2:29:27] can we go on a little further second
[2:29:30] Corinthians chapter 6 verse 16 and 17
[2:29:33] look at this oh my god says what and
[2:29:37] what agreement hath the temple of God
[2:29:39] with idols for ye are ye are the Temple
[2:29:44] of the Living God as God hath said I
[2:29:47] will dwell in them and walk in them and
[2:29:51] I will be their God and they shall be my
[2:29:54] people wherefore come out from among
[2:29:57] them and be ye separate saith the Lord
[2:29:59] and touch not the unclean unclean thing
[2:30:02] and I will receive you I'm trying to
[2:30:04] establish that you are that temple
[2:30:08] there's a couple things here that I want
[2:30:11] to read out of the message dedication
[2:30:14] I'm at paragraph 85 and that brother
[2:30:17] Branham made a statement a statue of her
[2:30:18] commanding said Christ sent me to bill
[2:30:20] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[2:30:22] Christ that they might be the powerhouse
[2:30:25] and the dwelling place of the spirit by
[2:30:27] his word see by his words he build up
[2:30:30] the individual to that place and that's
[2:30:32] exactly what we're trying to do you are
[2:30:34] Amen that final resting place let me
[2:30:37] read this and I got one more scripture
[2:30:39] and we'll close it off today out of
[2:30:41] dedication paragraph 85 it says and
[2:30:43] there had been 120 temples that God had
[2:30:47] created was ready for dedication they
[2:30:50] had got all their unbelief beat out of
[2:30:52] them and they gathered in the upper room
[2:30:54] and waited for 10 days for a dedication
[2:30:56] of service then went completely
[2:30:59] surrendered God came down again in the
[2:31:02] Shekinah glory and fill all the house
[2:31:04] where they were sitting
[2:31:06] what did God do like to art dropping
[2:31:09] into his proper sockets for the message
[2:31:11] of that day a man God dropped back into
[2:31:15] his proper channel not into a
[2:31:17] denomination or into a building mate
[2:31:19] with hands but into the heart of man he
[2:31:23] dropped in this place for the last day
[2:31:25] which said the Prophet Joelle it shall
[2:31:27] come to pass in the last days I'll pour
[2:31:28] out my Shekinah upon all flesh your sons
[2:31:32] and your daughters shall prophesy your
[2:31:34] young men shall dream dreams
[2:31:36] the old man shall see visions God came
[2:31:39] to his resting place where he finds rest
[2:31:41] not in our building but in the heart of
[2:31:44] his people he finds rest says what a
[2:31:47] shame
[2:31:48] what a disgrace what a what a disposed
[2:31:51] that Nimrod Nimrod man made achievement
[2:31:54] was brought to them when Nimrod tried to
[2:31:57] build a building or an organization that
[2:31:58] would reach up to heavens God upset it
[2:32:00] it become it became a shame instead of
[2:32:03] helping them he come he confused the
[2:32:05] language of men the one couldn't speak
[2:32:07] to another it broke up Brotherhood but
[2:32:09] when God came to his own temple the
[2:32:11] church the people when he came to them
[2:32:13] he filled it the temples that were
[2:32:16] dedicated just like he did at Solomon's
[2:32:18] Temple he filled it not with Creed's not
[2:32:20] with denominations but with himself he
[2:32:23] filled the temple with his Shekinah
[2:32:25] glory
[2:32:26] so did he do on the day of Pentecost he
[2:32:28] filled them 120 temples that was up
[2:32:31] there with his self with the Holy Ghost
[2:32:33] itself the Shekinah glory broke through
[2:32:36] a bump there and I'm looking for that
[2:32:37] same thing to happen again here those
[2:32:39] are says and then what never I fail to
[2:32:41] do build a temple where every man spoken
[2:32:43] traitor what what he could understand
[2:32:45] God came down and with one Galilean
[2:32:48] language made every man understand what
[2:32:50] he was saying and they know it and they
[2:32:53] know it was brought there is God to his
[2:32:55] temple God to his dedicated temple not
[2:32:57] to a man-made achievement not to what
[2:32:59] man done but what God did himself he
[2:33:02] goes on to say this oh it's silly to the
[2:33:05] people they don't get it they were born
[2:33:07] not to get it that is some folk born not
[2:33:12] to get it some born now for those and
[2:33:16] this is my prayer for those that had it
[2:33:19] and lost it my prayer that they're gonna
[2:33:22] pick up Jesus where they lost them
[2:33:24] because I don't believe they were born
[2:33:26] that beginning especially if you saw I
[2:33:29] think you just need your sight recovery
[2:33:31] that's all they were born not to get it
[2:33:34] so they won't get it the Bible said so
[2:33:35] right God always feels his temple at the
[2:33:38] day of dedication he feels his temple he
[2:33:41] feels it with itself the same thing that
[2:33:43] they God will feel every temple that
[2:33:45] will thoroughly dedicate itself to him
[2:33:47] and any persons that will the temple is
[2:33:49] not this little building here the temple
[2:33:51] is not the one in Salt Lake City the
[2:33:53] temple is not the one in Rome the temple
[2:33:55] is you you are the temple that God wants
[2:33:58] to dwell in and express his stuff
[2:34:00] through it that all nations might know
[2:34:02] him you are the living images of God
[2:34:04] that God wants to work through and
[2:34:06] anytime that any man or woman will
[2:34:09] forget all the falsehood that they've
[2:34:10] heard in the world and come back to the
[2:34:13] line of the scripture and we'll keep in
[2:34:16] line just like Solomon did to what Moses
[2:34:19] did Moses did to what God did God always
[2:34:22] respected it see when we when we accept
[2:34:24] the rejected and then the building will
[2:34:26] be complete
[2:34:27] let's go on it says and if we'll come
[2:34:30] back to the original dedication and
[2:34:32] we'll open our hearts and empty
[2:34:34] ourselves God and dedication as we give
[2:34:37] it to him we'll fill our temple with the
[2:34:39] Shekinah glory then the Living God will
[2:34:42] be moving in a living church among the
[2:34:45] living people and will spread forth its
[2:34:48] glory than together someday one being
[2:34:50] this way and one this way and one one
[2:34:53] part of the country she'll come together
[2:34:55] to make the pride will be caught up in
[2:34:58] the air to meet him now this lovely
[2:35:01] church this building that the people
[2:35:02] with their tokens of their livelihood
[2:35:04] with their love for Christ the
[2:35:06] worshippers that's dedicating today this
[2:35:07] place of worship that people could come
[2:35:09] and worship now my sincere prayer is
[2:35:11] that every every worshiper will dedicate
[2:35:13] his own temple to worship in the temple
[2:35:16] that's been dedicated to worship that's
[2:35:19] the real dedication church this this
[2:35:23] this whole thing God wanted to establish
[2:35:24] relationship with man and the only way
[2:35:27] you can get that relationship
[2:35:28] established with man was at Calvary see
[2:35:31] what we had was that we needed God
[2:35:34] Himself to come and die for our sins but
[2:35:35] after he died and after he rose again he
[2:35:38] said to copper to what come glory to God
[2:35:41] and it's no longer God above us or God
[2:35:44] with us
[2:35:44] when he came to Calgary but now because
[2:35:46] of the Holy Ghost it is God and us we
[2:35:50] are the temple of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:35:54] Spirit of God dwelleth in us

[2:37:51] come on it don't stop with just you
[2:37:53] sitting in that chair on Sunday morning
[2:37:56] gah got so much more for us to do but we
[2:37:59] gotta get in action Holly
[2:38:04] saaam I'm sorry revelation 21 this is it
[2:38:07] I was looking for listening to the
[2:38:13] Prophet on yesterday he was preaching
[2:38:15] the sermon God hiding himself and
[2:38:17] revealing and simplicity in the same
[2:38:21] hiding himself as the police didn't
[2:38:22] reveal himself in the same and they made
[2:38:24] that the comment about David was
[2:38:27] permitted to build the temple
[2:38:28] David David was not permitted to build a
[2:38:31] temple he could not do it but he said
[2:38:32] I'll raise up your seed and he'll build
[2:38:34] the temple that temple would be an
[2:38:35] everlasting temple and upon your son the
[2:38:38] son of David would be an everlasting
[2:38:39] Kingdom he will control Solomon David's
[2:38:41] son and the natural from his natural
[2:38:43] strength built a house unto the Lord a
[2:38:45] temple but when the real Cedar day
[2:38:47] become the son of David he told them
[2:38:50] there would come a time that there
[2:38:51] wouldn't be one stone left upon the
[2:38:53] other of that temple but he tried to
[2:38:55] point them to another temple and it goes
[2:38:58] on to say and this let me just see if I
[2:39:02] could yeah says it says so is it today
[2:39:09] where he says David could not build a
[2:39:11] true tabernacle of God because he wasn't
[2:39:13] prepared to do it there wasn't nothing
[2:39:14] he could do he was a mortal man shed
[2:39:16] blood so is it today to us we're not
[2:39:19] prepared to build the true tabernacle of
[2:39:21] God there's only one can do that and
[2:39:23] it's being in its construction now but
[2:39:25] this little Tabernacle along with the
[2:39:27] temple that Solomon built him and along
[2:39:29] with others are only temporary places of
[2:39:32] worship until the time comes when the
[2:39:34] real Tabernacle be set up upon the earth
[2:39:36] and righteousness shall reign from Sky
[2:39:39] to sky and there will be no more sorrow
[2:39:42] there will be no more funerals preached
[2:39:44] in that Tabernacle there'll be there be
[2:39:47] no more weddings for the wedding will be
[2:39:48] one great wedding for eternity what a
[2:39:51] time that would be he says but let us
[2:39:53] purpose in our hearts today that in
[2:39:55] commemoration and waiting for that
[2:39:56] Tabernacle to come we will characterize
[2:39:59] ourselves by his Spirit that we worship
[2:40:02] Him in this place and if we are and if
[2:40:04] we were in that other place waiting for
[2:40:06] that place to come and he invites the
[2:40:09] congregation
[2:40:09] to stand to their feet and I want to do
[2:40:11] the same thing for you he invites the
[2:40:13] congregation to stand to their feet and
[2:40:15] he reads the scripture over the
[2:40:17] congregation revelation 21 first one it
[2:40:27] says I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[2:40:31] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[2:40:33] were passed away and there was no more
[2:40:36] sea it's as I John saw the holy city New
[2:40:40] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[2:40:44] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[2:40:48] her husband and I heard a great voice
[2:40:51] out of heaven saying behold the
[2:40:53] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[2:40:57] will dwell with them and they shall be
[2:41:01] his people and God himself shall be with
[2:41:04] them and be their God I love this and
[2:41:08] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[2:41:13] eyes and there shall be no more death
[2:41:16] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[2:41:20] there be any more pain for the former
[2:41:22] things are passed away let's pray father
[2:41:30] God we realize that we are the final
[2:41:36] resting place it's in our hearts God
[2:41:39] that you want it to have fellowship and
[2:41:44] on this day as we come father to this

[2:41:52] the last Sunday of the year God we want
[2:41:56] to take a little time as as a group of
[2:41:58] believers to rededicate ourselves to
[2:42:04] your purpose into your plan for our
[2:42:06] lives oftentimes we have to admit that
[2:42:11] we allow so many things to get in the
[2:42:15] way of what you have called us to be
[2:42:18] not that you don't want us to achieve
[2:42:22] success and by the world standards but
