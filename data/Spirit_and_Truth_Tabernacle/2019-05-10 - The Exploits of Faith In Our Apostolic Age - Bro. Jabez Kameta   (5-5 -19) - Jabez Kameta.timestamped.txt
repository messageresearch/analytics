[1:04:52] and I don't know like I just let go and
[1:04:55] everything like I started jumping and
[1:04:56] screaming and then what I like when my
[1:04:59] eyes were closed there was like a light
[1:05:01] like it was just white like I could not
[1:05:04] see anything else but it was just white
[1:05:06] so I was like okay this is like a couple
[1:05:09] days later

[1:05:13] any pain and
[1:05:15] I can use the bathroom normally

[1:07:30] come today and just greet us we we know
[1:07:32] brother Gabriel through brother kwaku
[1:07:35] and man threw brother quick coup right
[1:07:37] and and you know God sent brother Quaker
[1:07:39] here uh via uh Texas but originally from
[1:07:44] Ghana right and my brother quick oh let
[1:07:47] me let me also say this while I'm there
[1:07:49] uh brother quick who the Lord has used
[1:07:53] this ministry amen mightily he uh he
[1:07:56] shared many of the testimonies of how
[1:07:58] God has just healed people underneath
[1:07:59] this ministry and and different places
[1:08:01] that he's going and he spent a lot of
[1:08:03] time in Mexico and and uh and everything
[1:08:05] like that in some in South America but
[1:08:08] uh the Lord has uh has blessed him uh
[1:08:11] and and I think it's going to be June I
[1:08:13] gotta I got to say this I appreciate
[1:08:15] this I appreciate this
[1:08:18] um you all know brother Simba is getting
[1:08:20] married couple weeks from now we'll be

[1:08:36] brother Quaker gonna go but going to
[1:08:38] Mexico the church he's going to he

[1:08:42] for brother Josue to join brother kwaku
[1:08:46] on a trip to Mexico
[1:08:53] has been kind of coordinating everything
[1:08:55] behind the scenes and and uh you know so
[1:08:58] brother Quaker and brother Oswego
[1:09:00] working and then when brother brother
[1:09:01] Jose called me and told me you know
[1:09:03] their their imitation and I said Lord
[1:09:05] It's a Wonderful invitation I don't want
[1:09:07] to get in the way of it but in my heart
[1:09:10] I'm like lord it's the wrong weekend
[1:09:12] because you know it's the weekend I'm
[1:09:14] gonna be away and I didn't want to tell
[1:09:16] them that right so brother Josue got
[1:09:18] with brother Quaker and he told him and
[1:09:20] he was calling the pastor back he said
[1:09:22] he asked the pastor could we move the
[1:09:23] meeting and the Pastor said no it's
[1:09:25] already planned we can't move nothing so
[1:09:27] brother Josue got in touch with uh
[1:09:29] brother quick when he told him
[1:09:30] everything brother Craig could say tell
[1:09:32] the pastor we can't come because we got
[1:09:35] to take care of home first
[1:09:40] first
[1:09:41] and you talk about somebody that
[1:09:43] appreciate that I I say Lord God
[1:09:48] this is real Health right amen
[1:09:52] so uh when brother brother Jose you know
[1:09:55] called back and and was you know letting
[1:09:57] them know everything brother holster
[1:09:59] said these are my responsibilities in
[1:10:00] the church and this is what's going on
[1:10:02] and this is why we that's a bad weekend
[1:10:04] can we move it up one week and the past
[1:10:06] say oh okay I understand now say hold on
[1:10:08] let me get back with you Cole got the
[1:10:11] other ministers tickets rearranged
[1:10:14] right we got their tickets rearranged
[1:10:16] and looks like we're gonna move it so
[1:10:18] that we don't conflict with what's going
[1:10:19] on there at home
[1:10:26] so I'm appreciative and I want to say
[1:10:29] that and I'm I'm doing all this but I'm
[1:10:31] gonna let her brother come but uh
[1:10:33] brother Gabriel's gonna come in a second
[1:10:34] but um we haven't taken offer because I
[1:10:37] want to share some of this
[1:10:39] um these brothers are going from our
[1:10:40] church
[1:10:41] our church and and what the prophet told
[1:10:44] us that if you can't go help send
[1:10:46] somebody right because every soul
[1:10:49] that'll get saved or any person deliver
[1:10:52] amen God would give it to your account
[1:10:54] because you actually helped these
[1:10:55] brothers and you know now uh I'm gonna
[1:10:58] just be transparent their tickets were
[1:11:00] only 200 something dollars
[1:11:02] to it that's that's that's that's not
[1:11:04] much and and I'm saying that because I
[1:11:07] want us as a church to take care of
[1:11:09] their tickets
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:15] that should be something we should be
[1:11:17] delighted to do and if everybody just
[1:11:20] said I'm gonna give twenty dollars
[1:11:21] towards that a 20 I mean I their tickets
[1:11:23] will be taken care of and all of us
[1:11:26] would get the blessing and I believe
[1:11:29] this just beginning of what God want to
[1:11:32] do so so so I'm I'm asking that you got
[1:11:35] these envelopes and I don't see it on
[1:11:37] there but you can write on there just
[1:11:38] say missions we got we got a special
[1:11:40] fund for Missions and just put in the
[1:11:43] envelope and put missions on it if you
[1:11:45] might say you know what I want to pay
[1:11:46] for that ticket that's fine if we get
[1:11:49] extra next time it come up we'll be able
[1:11:51] to sit them with something is that all
[1:11:53] right now that's the least we doing as
[1:11:55] paying for day tickets I'm letting you
[1:11:57] know that they're going I'm letting you
[1:11:59] know and Advance they're going so if you
[1:12:01] feel led

[1:15:41] found something that I really love from
[1:15:44] you and I felt it this morning and
[1:15:46] that's why I decided to talk about it
[1:15:48] for a while praise the Lord you know all
[1:15:50] right and is what I call reverence
[1:15:53] reverence okay uh I am from Colombia we
[1:15:58] are in Western Country where there is
[1:16:00] not much reverence about God okay and I
[1:16:03] see that unfortunate you know because
[1:16:06] you don't see many miracles when the
[1:16:08] people are not reverent okay you don't
[1:16:11] see Faith working through the people you
[1:16:15] know when they are not reverent about
[1:16:16] God you know and when I was there in
[1:16:19] Uganda the pastor that invited me by
[1:16:22] Pastor Leo Robert from Michiana Uganda
[1:16:25] okay the first thing that he did he
[1:16:28] arranged to go to the hospital
[1:16:30] okay with the with the director of the
[1:16:34] hospital yes so it was something very
[1:16:36] strange for me because I was expecting
[1:16:38] to go to churches first you know but
[1:16:40] when we arrived to that hospital I
[1:16:43] noticed that the director of the
[1:16:45] hospital came all true to say hi to us
[1:16:47] and to invite us to each one of the his
[1:16:50] offices you know and he present to us as
[1:16:53] doctors but not tours of medicine but
[1:16:57] doctors of Heaven
[1:17:00] praise the Lord amen so reverence
[1:17:04] reverence you know the main Doctrine and
[1:17:08] the director of the hospital in Medina
[1:17:10] Uganda what they want that was
[1:17:12] introducing
[1:17:14] us to all the people that all of his
[1:17:17] staff that was working with him there
[1:17:19] you know the administrative people and
[1:17:21] everybody you know and the last thing
[1:17:23] that he did he took us were the people
[1:17:25] that has AIDS you know there was a
[1:17:28] complete Babylon there you know full of
[1:17:31] people I I would say so many people you
[1:17:33] know wow and I didn't know what was
[1:17:35] going on
[1:17:37] because you know I was in front of
[1:17:39] people that I never met before you know
[1:17:41] I was with this pastor and they have to
[1:17:43] translate from the English language I
[1:17:45] speak Spanish of course but they have to
[1:17:48] translate from the English language you
[1:17:50] know to the mediana language you know to
[1:17:52] tell the people the things and the
[1:17:54] doctor was speaking and his brother was
[1:17:56] translating for me in English you know
[1:17:57] and he started saying well he's saying
[1:18:00] that you guys are doctors from Heaven
[1:18:02] that you are here because you are going
[1:18:04] to help them in their souls etc etc you
[1:18:08] know and I had my backpack put on in my
[1:18:11] back I had my Bible on you know and I
[1:18:13] didn't say I didn't say much you know
[1:18:15] but when the doctor ended my brother
[1:18:18] turned around and looked at me and I
[1:18:21] said now what now what and he said he
[1:18:24] started preaching brother praise the
[1:18:26] Lord you know so we start preaching we
[1:18:28] had a service in the Babylon in that
[1:18:31] hospital with people with AIDS praise
[1:18:34] the Lord
[1:18:38] so if the Lord Jesus Christ is the same
[1:18:41] yesterday it is the same today and he is
[1:18:44] the same forever
[1:18:45] there has to be faith in somebody there
[1:18:49] has to be reverence in someone you know
[1:18:52] to understand that God is still bailed
[1:18:55] in people
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:58] and we have to notice that today there
[1:19:00] is a bright beer on Earth I'm not
[1:19:03] preaching I'm testifying bro praise the
[1:19:05] Lord you know I get excited when I speak
[1:19:08] about these things you know amen but
[1:19:10] there has to be a bride on Earth today
[1:19:12] yes that's right amen and she is the
[1:19:16] mouth of God on Earth
[1:19:19] and he has to speak this word and there
[1:19:23] has to be people to believe it and there
[1:19:25] has to be a faith that God will
[1:19:28] encounter that God will find and that
[1:19:31] God will respond according to that faith
[1:19:34] and I truly believe that that is what
[1:19:36] God is doing these end times brother
[1:19:38] amen you know we have to wake up amen
[1:19:42] but uh you know I I felt this morning
[1:19:45] when I I was back there listening to
[1:19:48] your songs and to the sisters oh my God
[1:19:51] remind me Uganda
[1:19:56] and I understood when I was in Uganda
[1:19:59] why brother Branham loved you guys so
[1:20:03] much
[1:20:04] and why he decided to come back in 1965
[1:20:09] we which he couldn't for the reason that
[1:20:12] God knows but he says I will go to
[1:20:15] Africa now who said so
[1:20:20] who's that song
[1:20:21] amen amen I am the beginning
[1:20:25] and I am the end
[1:20:28] those words and the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:30] visiting Africa to missionaries my
[1:20:33] brother
[1:20:35] and the Holy Spirit is working true
[1:20:38] African people
[1:20:40] everywhere you go my brother and that's
[1:20:43] why we see Miracles that's why we see
[1:20:46] people feel it with the Holy Spirit and
[1:20:48] that's why we are seeing something else
[1:20:50] today on the world and God will still
[1:20:54] doing things in America in Colombia and
[1:20:57] everywhere where people believe
[1:20:59] amen that's why we sing only believe
[1:21:02] only believe only believe we we keep
[1:21:05] singing we keep singing until one day
[1:21:07] will happen something like happened with
[1:21:09] this lady praise the Lord this young
[1:21:11] lady amen when your faith is in line
[1:21:14] with the faith of God when the Sixth
[1:21:18] Sense is aligned completely something
[1:21:21] Supernatural will happen
[1:21:24] amen right
[1:21:27] I love missionary work I do when I go
[1:21:31] out in missionary field I I get excited
[1:21:34] everywhere of course you know each
[1:21:38] charge must have a plan you know to send
[1:21:40] missionaries to the field because there
[1:21:43] is still somebody somewhere right that
[1:21:46] which would be the last one amen I don't
[1:21:49] know where it's at
[1:21:51] could be this morning here right you
[1:21:53] know we think that because we are in the
[1:21:55] church we are in the church
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] yeah do we think so right you know if
[1:22:02] you were seated there in the
[1:22:04] predestination seat and you say I am the
[1:22:06] bride okay I don't want to preach you
[1:22:09] because I know you have better preachers
[1:22:10] than me praise the Lord you know but I
[1:22:13] want to make conscience in the church
[1:22:16] okay that if you don't have the Holy
[1:22:19] Ghost if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:22:21] in your soul you're still out of the
[1:22:24] church even if you are inside the
[1:22:26] building even if you are seated there if
[1:22:29] you don't have the Holy Ghost you're
[1:22:31] still out of the church right amen
[1:22:33] that's why we need to go sometimes to
[1:22:36] the basics you know that's right the
[1:22:39] type of work that we're doing back in
[1:22:41] Colombia and out of the country you know
[1:22:43] is I preach all the time about the Holy
[1:22:45] Spirit
[1:22:47] because that's the beginning
[1:22:48] but let me tell you there will be the
[1:22:50] end also amen because if you get
[1:22:53] baptized and you start by the new bird
[1:22:55] praise the Lord that's wonderful but how
[1:22:58] do you get to the perfect stature of the
[1:23:01] perfect man
[1:23:02] all right amen without Divine love in
[1:23:04] yourself and that's the work of the holy
[1:23:07] spirit in your life amen so what we do
[1:23:10] in our missionary work we have 10 months
[1:23:13] per year that's what we're doing today
[1:23:14] okay and we're spending one week per
[1:23:17] month one week per month with people
[1:23:20] that are seeking the Holy Ghost amen
[1:23:22] people that doesn't understand about
[1:23:24] these things we keep preaching preaching
[1:23:27] preaching until they understand what
[1:23:29] they have to do for that change in their
[1:23:31] lives okay and we open a week we we
[1:23:34] don't open in certain way we looked the
[1:23:36] the guidance of the Holy Ghost okay
[1:23:39] until he confirms this week okay and we
[1:23:42] tell the people we will open this week
[1:23:45] so let's pray about it you know until
[1:23:46] they feel the call and when they feel
[1:23:49] the call when they feel the call is not
[1:23:51] the call of a person is the call of the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost amen and when they get in
[1:23:56] that situation they spend a complete
[1:23:58] week until they receive the Holy Ghost
[1:24:00] even if we have to spend more than a
[1:24:02] week we do it of course you know because
[1:24:05] we don't know what the Lord needs to do
[1:24:07] in the heart of the person until the
[1:24:09] Lord himself you know appears in the
[1:24:12] scene and he starts showing what the
[1:24:14] people needs okay until everything is
[1:24:17] taken out of the way that person gets
[1:24:20] baptized in in the in the fire
[1:24:22] departments of the Holy Spirit praise
[1:24:24] the Lord amen so we are working on that
[1:24:27] really hard really hard because it's
[1:24:30] hard to stay awake or sometimes more
[1:24:32] than that you know with a person or with
[1:24:34] a few people you know during all that
[1:24:37] time we're ministering them in different
[1:24:39] ways listening tapes of programs even
[1:24:42] preaching to them seeing in songs you
[1:24:44] know sometimes praying you know like the
[1:24:46] word of God says you know you have to
[1:24:48] wait until something happens
[1:24:53] amen so we keep doing that besides that
[1:24:57] well I translate sermons of brother
[1:24:59] Abraham to the Spanish language in
[1:25:00] simultaneous way for the people to
[1:25:03] listen you know in congregation or even
[1:25:05] to Listen by themselves in their houses
[1:25:07] you know but simultaneously no lapse it
[1:25:10] like a boys who got recording does we
[1:25:13] are not competing with them we're doing
[1:25:15] just our own work okay and we just put
[1:25:18] that in the hands of the people that is
[1:25:20] something that God letters us to do some
[1:25:24] years ago and it has been a blessing I
[1:25:27] am really surprised that their work is
[1:25:29] being used in Argentina in Chile for
[1:25:33] example in Venezuela in Mexico even here
[1:25:36] in the United States it's something
[1:25:38] awesome even in in in some places really
[1:25:42] far from us you know New Zealand for
[1:25:44] example okay not many but people are
[1:25:47] listening I'm very surprised that number
[1:25:49] seven in the list is Japan
[1:25:51] and you say in Japan yeah there has to
[1:25:55] be somebody there
[1:25:56] praise the Lord there has to be a group
[1:25:59] of Spanish people there for sure that
[1:26:02] are downloading the material and are
[1:26:04] using it praise the Lord okay so this
[1:26:07] message is going on this message keeps
[1:26:10] going on you know yes until the end of
[1:26:12] the world because it has to be like that
[1:26:15] praise the Lord okay so brothers and
[1:26:18] sisters I don't have much time I promise
[1:26:20] to stay here only for 15 minutes
[1:26:22] but however
[1:26:24] I love you amen I am really glad that

[1:27:50] prayers please okay this is just a short
[1:27:54] a short testimony okay but the Lord told
[1:27:58] us that
[1:28:00] when you receive the Holy Ghost you will
[1:28:02] have thirst and hunger for those lost
[1:28:05] souls right amen
[1:28:08] when I go out in the streets and I see
[1:28:11] somebody from another denomination
[1:28:15] I don't judge them right
[1:28:17] right you know because the Holy Spirit
[1:28:20] when it comes to your heart does not
[1:28:22] judge the Lord didn't judge
[1:28:25] you know even as the word says also
[1:28:27] judge all things you know but you have
[1:28:29] to judge it with it with it with a true
[1:28:32] balance you know what I mean of course
[1:28:34] you know but don't judge the people the
[1:28:37] feel compassion for the people right
[1:28:40] amen because if you don't remember let
[1:28:43] me remember you this morning that you
[1:28:45] were a blind person also that you were
[1:28:49] lost also like all of us all of us we
[1:28:53] were blind but God used somebody to come
[1:28:57] to your life yeah you know to tell you
[1:28:59] there is a truth somewhere yeah amen I
[1:29:02] know that truth didn't come to you
[1:29:05] because you deserve it amen that that
[1:29:08] came to you because of the grace of God
[1:29:12] Amen and I truly believe that this is
[1:29:15] the time to rescue that last Soul where
[1:29:18] I don't know where it is
[1:29:19] like I said could be this morning in
[1:29:22] this place that person needs to receive
[1:29:24] the Holy Ghost and that will be it amen
[1:29:27] because that is a true a true a
[1:29:31] conversion amen the true conversion
[1:29:34] doesn't come when you say I want to
[1:29:36] serve the Lord or I want to oh Jesus you
[1:29:38] know that that is not the true
[1:29:40] conversion the true conversion comes
[1:29:41] when you are baptized in the fire
[1:29:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so I just
[1:29:48] want to finish with this
[1:29:50] of course it's not it's not mine it's

[1:34:58] we what we did we pledged we made
[1:35:00] pledges actually we voted that uh we
[1:35:02] would uh try to raise a hundred and five
[1:35:04] thousand dollars a year for three years
[1:35:07] amen 105 000 a year that was our goal
[1:35:10] our pledges those that committed to the
[1:35:13] goal said I'm gonna we said we'll get 56
[1:35:15] 809 towards that hundred and five
[1:35:18] thousand uh received of that 56 000
[1:35:22] received year-to-date is 10
[1:35:26] 841.13 uh so we thank God for that
[1:35:30] foreign
[1:35:35] to this little update is you'll see an
[1:35:37] interest column so the money that we
[1:35:40] have received we have placed in the bank
[1:35:42] in order to gain some interest right and
[1:35:45] we've made
[1:35:46] 81.65 in interest
[1:35:51] I am still a good good numbers we have
[1:35:54] not used any of that money for anything
[1:35:56] else right but for the building fund so
[1:36:00] no transfers have happened we've been
[1:36:01] able to keep the money where it needs to
[1:36:03] be so when it's time to purchase we'll
[1:36:06] be ready to purchase amen amen amen so
[1:36:08] our net uh this uh so far that we have
[1:36:11] accumulated this year is 10
[1:36:14] 922.78 and we thank God for that so
[1:36:17] let's give God praise one more time
[1:36:22] as you saw our goal was 105 000 pledges
[1:36:26] for 56 000. if you would like to pledge
[1:36:29] to help us reach that goal of 105 000
[1:36:31] there's these little forms there on the
[1:36:33] table as you're going out and if you
[1:36:35] would just want to further attack we
[1:36:36] want to be a part of that we want to
[1:36:37] give a one-time pledge do you want to do
[1:36:39] something monthly amen we'll receive it
[1:36:41] in Jesus name and and we pray that God
[1:36:43] will bless you uh uh for trying to help
[1:36:46] us get there but we we are under
[1:36:48] expectation for something really really
[1:36:50] great and and I believe everybody that's
[1:36:52] a part of it God will bless them amen
[1:36:54] especially amen for that so keep us in
[1:36:57] prayer uh if you don't do any more keep
[1:36:59] us in prayer because we we really are

[1:37:03] something we actually got our eyes on a
[1:37:05] piece of property right now amen amen
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:12] right now I'm the type of person believe
[1:37:15] that if you just give God

[1:37:19] and give them five loaves of bread right
[1:37:22] that he can take that yes he can bypass
[1:37:25] some process and multiply your fish and

[1:46:54] couple already here
[1:46:57] I'm a fast speaker please
[1:46:59] um
[1:47:00] that I pray that God will help me to
[1:47:03] slow down praise the Lord
[1:47:06] so slow down because um I'm supposed to
[1:47:10] pass information to send a message
[1:47:12] across so and if the message is not
[1:47:15] delivered then information is not passed
[1:47:18] so I want uh the information to be
[1:47:21] passed so God bless you so let us look
[1:47:24] at Mark chapter 16 we really much to
[1:47:27] sustain and we also read Danish chapter
[1:47:30] 11
[1:47:31] then 11 then uh we'll be reading a
[1:47:35] foreign
[1:47:42] God bless you shalom
[1:47:45] Mark 16
[1:47:47] Daniel chapter 11.
[1:47:51] um Joe
[1:47:53] chapter 1.
[1:47:56] mark 16.
[1:47:59] we take it from verse 14.
[1:48:02] from verse 14.
[1:48:04] so after all they appeared on to the
[1:48:06] 11th as they sat at Mid and not break
[1:48:09] them with their own belief
[1:48:11] and Hardness of Heart because they
[1:48:14] believe not them which had seen him
[1:48:17] after he was risen so you you see that
[1:48:21] God always wanted to believe the
[1:48:23] testimony of true weakness right amen so
[1:48:27] and he said unto them going into all the
[1:48:30] war and preach the gospel to every
[1:48:33] creature
[1:48:35] and he that believeth and is baptized
[1:48:38] shall be saved and he that believeth not
[1:48:40] shall be done right
[1:48:46] and
[1:48:49] and this science shall follow them to
[1:48:51] believe right amen not them the priests
[1:48:55] amen this sign is not following the
[1:48:58] preachers amen Jesus never said the
[1:49:01] preachers he said but this sign shall
[1:49:03] follow them that believe
[1:49:05] he's a Believer to have the sign
[1:49:07] following them
[1:49:09] Hallelujah
[1:49:10] praise God all right so in my name they
[1:49:13] shall Caster Devils yes and they shall
[1:49:15] speak with new tongues they shall take
[1:49:18] up sabbaths and if they drank any deadly
[1:49:21] thing it shall not hurt them and they
[1:49:24] shall lay hand on the sick and the sick
[1:49:27] shall recover right
[1:49:28] right so then after the Lord has spoken
[1:49:31] unto them
[1:49:32] he was still it was received up into
[1:49:35] heaven
[1:49:37] and sat on the right hand of God
[1:49:41] and they went forth precious and
[1:49:44] preached everywhere the Lord walking
[1:49:46] with them and confirming his word the
[1:49:50] word with signs following amen
[1:49:54] Done Yet 11 31 and 32
[1:49:59] Danny 11.
[1:50:01] 31 32
[1:50:04] say an arms shall stand on his path and
[1:50:08] they shall they shall pollute the
[1:50:10] sanctuary of strength and shall take
[1:50:13] away the daily sacrifice and shall place
[1:50:17] the uh shall place the Abomination
[1:50:20] that make it desolate
[1:50:24] and such as though wickedly against the
[1:50:27] Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries
[1:50:30] but the people that don't know their God
[1:50:33] shall be strong and shall do exploit
[1:50:39] Hallelujah
[1:50:41] then George chapter 1 verse 3
[1:50:45] is that beloved
[1:50:46] when I give all diligent to write unto
[1:50:50] you of the common salvation it was
[1:50:52] needful for me
[1:50:55] to write unto you and exalt you that
[1:50:57] issue aimlessly contend for the faith
[1:51:01] which was once delivered unto the saints
[1:51:05] that Lord add blessed to his word in our
[1:51:09] heart in Jesus name
[1:51:10] never seen it
[1:51:16] so I want to take a title uh this
[1:51:19] morning I would like to speak briefly on
[1:51:21] the exploit of faith in our Apostolic
[1:51:25] age
[1:51:26] amen the exploit of faith in our
[1:51:31] Apostolic age because I believe that we
[1:51:36] are living in Apocalypse Apostolic times
[1:51:38] right amen I believe that we are living
[1:51:41] in Apostolic age with Apostolic power
[1:51:44] Apostolic Doctrine and Apostolic science
[1:51:47] following the church Hallelujah so
[1:51:51] because Pentecost should not cease in
[1:51:53] the church and the cosmos always remain
[1:51:56] in the church Hallelujah
[1:51:58] if I'm God if you find Healing as not
[1:52:02] God so the blessings must still remain
[1:52:04] in the church Hallelujah
[1:52:08] so I want to read a contest scripture
[1:52:10] here in Saint John Saint John chapter 12
[1:52:13] for the Conte description Amen to begin
[1:52:15] the message he said and there we're
[1:52:18] setting Greeks among them that came up
[1:52:21] to worship at the feast
[1:52:24] and came therefore to Philip which was
[1:52:29] advertising of Galilee and desired him
[1:52:33] same son we will see Jesus
[1:52:38] Hallelujah and Philip come out and tell
[1:52:41] Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell
[1:52:45] Jesus
[1:52:47] so friends
[1:52:49] notice that the Greek came to meet the
[1:52:52] disciples Hallelujah because they know
[1:52:55] that it takes a disciple right Amen to
[1:52:58] take it to Jesus
[1:53:00] hallelujah amen and when they come
[1:53:02] between disciples they were looking for
[1:53:05] Jesus amen they're not looking for are
[1:53:08] looking for Peter no sir they never
[1:53:11] asked for Peter right they are looking
[1:53:13] for John they are not looking for gems
[1:53:15] amen they were disciples but they said
[1:53:19] sir we will see Jesus
[1:53:23] Hallelujah
[1:53:25] I believe that the desire of everyone
[1:53:28] again believer every born-again
[1:53:31] Christian that ever heard about him
[1:53:34] they will always want to see him
[1:53:36] Hallelujah
[1:53:39] they come to church to see him right
[1:53:42] right yes they don't come to church to
[1:53:45] see one another that's right though it
[1:53:47] is good to see one another Hallelujah
[1:53:49] they don't come to church to see the
[1:53:51] pastor or to sit and dig it but they
[1:53:55] come to church so see him
[1:53:57] hallelujah praise God in the duty and
[1:54:01] the duty of every true minister of God
[1:54:06] not to bring the people to himself
[1:54:08] amen yet the people are to believe on
[1:54:13] the medicine in order for the minister
[1:54:15] to help them
[1:54:17] praise God hallelujah let the minister
[1:54:21] is to bring them to Jesus
[1:54:25] because it's the object of adoration
[1:54:28] in the update of worship
[1:54:31] so every True Believer of in Christ is
[1:54:34] ordained of God to bring the people to
[1:54:37] Jesus Christ
[1:54:39] that is what the word of see him in
[1:54:43] action
[1:54:43] and I believe that's how we're here this
[1:54:45] morning we come to church to see him we
[1:54:49] come to church to meet him we come to
[1:54:51] talk to receive from him Hallelujah and
[1:54:55] his son is angels in charge Amen to give
[1:54:58] the people the minister to their needs
[1:55:01] yes for he gave them Ministry Spirit to
[1:55:05] minister to the hands of salvation
[1:55:09] a minister for the hands of Salvation
[1:55:12] amen oh Hallelujah and I believe that
[1:55:15] the acts of Salvation are here this
[1:55:17] morning I believe that here this morning
[1:55:20] yes sir as long as you're here angels
[1:55:22] are here right right right the spirit is
[1:55:25] here
[1:55:26] amen amen
[1:55:29] praise the Lord
[1:55:31] so now because Apostle Paul said yeah
[1:55:45] yeah
[1:55:46] same here in First Corinthians chapter 4
[1:55:50] he was saying that the kingdom of God
[1:55:52] Amen which we preach is not in word only
[1:55:58] right amen he knows what the minister is
[1:56:01] commissioned to do amen I know what the
[1:56:04] people are to expect
[1:56:06] so for the kingdom of God which we
[1:56:09] preach amen is not in words only right
[1:56:12] and the prophet said is the duty of the
[1:56:15] minister to bring the kingdom of God to
[1:56:17] the people hallelujah amen and then to
[1:56:20] bring the people to the kingdom and this
[1:56:23] money we are entering the kingdom praise
[1:56:26] God to take all our intempted blessings
[1:56:29] amen amen we're not going to put it up
[1:56:33] to another day amen I'll put it for some
[1:56:36] some days ahead remember we're taking it
[1:56:39] now because now Faith is
[1:56:43] amen hallelujah so the kingdom of God is
[1:56:47] not in what only but it's in power also
[1:56:50] in power amen demonstration of the holy
[1:56:53] spirit that your faith might not lean
[1:56:56] upon the wisdom of man or the
[1:56:59] intentional ability of man to fall worse
[1:57:02] right no praise God in the power and the
[1:57:07] demonstration of the holy spirit amen
[1:57:10] amen amen and that is how to make the
[1:57:13] gospel preach remember the gospel is not
[1:57:15] in what only the gospel is a
[1:57:18] demonstriction is to see God in action
[1:57:21] [Applause]
[1:57:24] Hallelujah and that's what we are here
[1:57:26] this morning we want to see God in
[1:57:29] action
[1:57:31] amen
[1:57:33] praise the Lord
[1:57:36] so you know this is Greeks amen
[1:57:39] and the prophet saying here is that the
[1:57:41] Greeks we just across type of people
[1:57:44] that came to look for Jesus said Paul I
[1:57:47] believe it was said a Greek sick wisdom
[1:57:49] amen and the Jews seek for science when
[1:57:54] the Greeks seek for wisdom
[1:57:56] so when they come designing to see Jesus
[1:57:58] amen they will not desire to see to
[1:58:01] receive miracles

[3:13:16] by just a word of Prayer
[3:13:18] I have seen God restore with the hands
[3:13:25] I went to a village
[3:13:28] to see sister
[3:13:32] who have a stroke in their hands
[3:13:36] and the right hand
[3:13:38] wither like this
[3:13:41] so I want to see her if she was my trust
[3:13:45] his wife and it happened the wife
[3:13:48] so met in the village and then we'll be
[3:13:51] exalting her
[3:13:52] encouraging her
[3:13:55] so and there was a kind of a crowd of
[3:13:57] people that comes around
[3:13:59] also to come and pay a visit
[3:14:02] so and I was telling them about the Lord
[3:14:04] the goodness of God and his message
[3:14:08] then somebody that challenged me and
[3:14:10] said pastor
[3:14:12] you are talking about Jesus and you are
[3:14:15] here
[3:14:16] is your sister
[3:14:18] with a without hand
[3:14:20] say why don't we start Jesus healed at
[3:14:22] hands
[3:14:26] he said that
[3:14:27] I've said that
[3:14:29] I guess turtle I never did expect that
[3:14:31] before
[3:14:32] I only went to visit
[3:14:34] I said now if Jesus healed his hand will
[3:14:38] you give your life to Jesus
[3:14:40] will you do that they said yes if we see
[3:14:43] Jesus healed his hand then we can
[3:14:46] you know the gospel is not the word only
[3:14:50] it's in power
[3:14:52] so if we see that God hear this hand
[3:14:54] then we will
[3:14:56] Southern goal

[4:42:26] required for overtimes I think everybody
[4:42:28] was rejoicing that they was a part of
[4:42:30] something like that and we had some
[4:42:32] overtime here today we ought to leave
[4:42:34] here rejoicing on what our god did for
