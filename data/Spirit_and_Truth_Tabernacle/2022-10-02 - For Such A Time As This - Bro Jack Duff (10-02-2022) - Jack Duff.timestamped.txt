[50:40] I was just
[50:42] just kind of watching the service there
[50:47] online while I was there in the back
[50:49] waiting and and while sister Shonda was
[50:52] singing a song
[50:54] sister Dixon just up and worshiping and
[50:57] praising the Lord and it reminded me of
[51:00] something I just began to think about
[51:03] sister Dixon and you know one of the
[51:06] things I want to say a real Christian
[51:08] don't don't wait Sunday morning
[51:10] uh to worship
[51:13] and uh sister Dixon has been one of
[51:16] those uh warriors uh through the years
[51:19] and and I just remember I went way back
[51:22] in my mind I remember just being a young
[51:24] man and we were we were at choir choir
[51:28] Hustle
[51:30] and uh sister Dixon used to be the one
[51:33] that would clean the church she would
[51:35] come and vacuum and and she would uh you
[51:39] know clean the pews and she would clean
[51:42] the bathrooms she was doing all of that
[51:44] and she would come during a time of
[51:46] choir hustle and uh sometimes you have a
[51:50] vacuum cleaner in one hand
[51:52] and a hand lifted
[51:55] it just reminded me of those those old
[51:58] days and how she she didn't wait till
[52:00] Sunday morning anytime she could give
[52:02] God praise that she was giving God
[52:04] praise and and I was just I was just
[52:06] happy
[52:07] [Music]
[52:08] I was happy going down memory lane a man
[52:12] and just just just just just just just
[52:13] just seeing that so we thank God for her
[52:16] we thank God for all the the Saints amen
[52:19] I thank God that the Lord brought us all
[52:21] through this amen this terrible storm

[53:00] time to get prepared for things like
[53:02] this and and uh just just trusting God
[53:05] would just give us a little Grace and

[56:41] just once a month let's encourage the
[56:42] church let's listen to let's listen to
[56:44] the word together listen to what God's
[56:46] Prophet had to say to us all right

[57:01] service on next uh uh Friday night and
[57:04] then Saturday night be coming back for a
[57:07] service with brother Jason Watkins
[57:10] um you know brother Jason is one of
[57:11] those Brothers uh he um he has some
[57:14] history with this message his parents
[57:18] um grew up kind of in the Tabernacle his
[57:21] mom had a dream about uh looking for the
[57:24] bride find the bride wanting to find the
[57:26] bride and um and um you know and when
[57:30] some kind of way they got kicked out of
[57:32] the church that they were in and when
[57:34] they got kicked out they walked outside
[57:36] and I think across the street was
[57:37] another young couple coming out of
[57:39] church that just got married so she saw
[57:41] the bride and uh so then you know she
[57:44] she kind of kept that in her in her
[57:46] spirit and and they found their way to
[57:47] brother Branham you know to the
[57:49] Tabernacle and when they got there uh
[57:52] she told Brother Branham a dream and
[57:53] brother Branham interpreted for and once
[57:56] she got interpreted she was settled you
[57:58] know that was it she knew she had found
[58:00] the bride oh hallelujah we're not
[58:04] looking for the church or a church we're
[58:07] looking for the bride
[58:09] amen even brother Brandon I read a quote
[58:11] this morning brother random say don't
[58:13] they say the Holy Spirit told them don't
[58:14] even call them Church
[58:16] say the churches are called out people
[58:18] they call them lodges
[58:21] it's not a church call them lodges the
[58:24] Holy Spirit told them to say that
[58:25] amen and I looked up the definition of
[58:29] Lodge and they said it's just a
[58:31] organized Gathering of people like the
[58:34] Freemasons
[58:36] that's in the dictionary like the
[58:39] Freemasons and Freemasons nothing but uh
[58:41] Witchcraft and and and and and and and
[58:43] and a demonic
[58:46] um stuff
[58:47] idolatry so brother I mean so the Holy
[58:51] Spirit tied the denomination churches
[58:53] Hallelujah to idolatry
[58:56] all right
[58:59] and if you go to a church and they pray
[59:01] in the name of the father
[59:03] in the name of the son in the name of
[59:05] the Holy Ghost idolatry
[59:09] all right because ain't no power in the
[59:12] name of the father
[59:14] ain't no power in the name of the son
[59:16] ain't no power in the name of the spirit
[59:18] you need to know his name and you need
[59:20] to call him by his name
[59:23] amen
[59:25] if I just said a father so many brothers
[59:29] could respond to that I need to know who
[59:32] am I talking to called a man by his name
[59:36] all right
[59:37] amen So you you're watching this
[59:40] idolatry going on out there in these
[59:42] churches and and it's all underneath the
[59:44] name of Christianity but it's idolatry
[59:47] Oh I Feel Jesus amen so we I tell you we
[59:52] want to um just uh just encourage the
[59:54] church and everywhere we can let's let's
[59:56] all just unite together throughout the
[59:58] day but we'll be here Friday night for
[1:00:00] the Youth service I know you're going to
[1:00:02] be blessed when you come Saturday night
[1:00:04] we're coming back brother Jason and then
[1:00:06] uh Sunday morning he'll be here also

[1:00:18] jeans and preaching on Sunday evening I
[1:00:20] think the service starts at six o'clock

[1:01:06] are streaming our service and he's
[1:01:08] interpreting to the Saints back home
[1:01:11] um so you know my my I would thank God
[1:01:15] it's a brother Gabriel that told me uh
[1:01:18] he'd come visit us uh last year I think
[1:01:22] it was last year that he was here and it
[1:01:24] came through and uh he took a picture
[1:01:25] outside and he says um they say brother
[1:01:28] uh
[1:01:30] is something about being here in this
[1:01:34] place
[1:01:35] there's something about this and they
[1:01:37] say he said I need to take a picture in
[1:01:39] front of this address here because you
[1:01:42] know the address is 377.
[1:01:47] all right you don't have addresses like
[1:01:49] that too much but three seven seven
[1:01:52] there's something like something about
[1:01:54] this you know so a real encouragement to
[1:01:58] my spirit uh you know there sometimes I
[1:02:01] tell you what I get a little discouraged
[1:02:04] you know and I'm like Lord I'm waiting
[1:02:06] I'm waiting on God what else we need to
[1:02:08] do Lord what else we need to do and uh
[1:02:10] but uh but I tell you what what we need
[1:02:13] to do I I got the answer I got the
[1:02:15] answer I got the answer what we need to
[1:02:17] do is is wait
[1:02:28] don't get in a hurry just just wait just
[1:02:33] wait that's all God wants us to do and
[1:02:35] uh he'll manifest in his own due time
[1:02:37] you know so so why I say while I'm
[1:02:39] waiting I'm gonna be faithful we're
[1:02:42] gonna serve God and we're gonna do
[1:02:43] everything we can we're going to treat
[1:02:45] it like it's our own amen as long as we

[1:04:26] the Lord would allow us a man I I'm
[1:04:28] going back into my archive and I'm
[1:04:31] pulling something out
[1:04:34] um that was a blessing to me years ago
[1:04:35] but it seemed like in this season uh
[1:04:38] it's speaking a little bit more and man
[1:04:41] so we we want to we want to just try to
[1:04:43] uh be obedient to the spirit of God
[1:04:47] um
[1:04:48] um I I also want to say um I was at
[1:04:52] before I I came I was just out and I
[1:04:56] have to make my pit stop before I come
[1:04:59] to the pulpit you know and uh I saw
[1:05:02] brother Chris and he was telling me a
[1:05:04] little something that happened there
[1:05:05] this morning and um at the house and
[1:05:07] brother Chris I'm happy to see you and
[1:05:10] sister Gabby pressed through a man uh
[1:05:13] that trial uh sometime the enemy would
[1:05:16] just kind of throw things in our path to
[1:05:18] try to disrupt us
[1:05:20] last week we had a plan to
[1:05:24] um
[1:05:25] um we knew that we wouldn't have all our
[1:05:27] vehicles here to help you know break
[1:05:29] down so we had a plan brother brother uh
[1:05:31] Quentin that left his truck in the
[1:05:34] parking lot like okay y'all just pick up
[1:05:35] the truck on Sunday and uh and then
[1:05:38] y'all can take all the stuff back to the
[1:05:39] storage and and my brother Troy drove by
[1:05:42] the parking lot on Sunday morning and
[1:05:43] the truck wasn't there
[1:05:45] and uh so like okay well we'll uh figure
[1:05:48] out what we're gonna do and we had to
[1:05:50] sort through it and brother Troy did the
[1:05:52] research and found out the truck was
[1:05:54] towed and um you know I'm like you know
[1:05:57] here's what you have to do you have to
[1:05:59] expect the devil to fight and uh you
[1:06:02] know he's got some kind of way he's
[1:06:03] gonna do something but uh but I I thank
[1:06:07] God a man that uh we was able to get the
[1:06:10] truck back and no no no no no issues but
[1:06:12] you know that's fine that's fine if
[1:06:14] that's uh like I like to say it like
[1:06:16] this if that's your best punch if that's
[1:06:19] all you got
[1:06:20] that's all you got sometimes you need to
[1:06:23] tell the devil that's all you got
[1:06:25] they stand like Muhammad Ali
[1:06:29] come on somebody
[1:06:31] Muhammad Ali boy he'll he'll get them
[1:06:33] all I mean they didn't work that
[1:06:35] everything through everything they had
[1:06:36] them Muhammad look look him in the eye
[1:06:38] that's all you got
[1:06:40] cause I'm getting ready to go to town on
[1:06:42] you amen but but you know we we we we we
[1:06:45] we realize that the enemy is gonna fight
[1:06:48] but press through amen whatever it is
[1:06:50] that he throws in your your direction
[1:06:51] keep pressing press Little Lily
[1:06:55] press
[1:06:57] amen y'all stand with me
[1:07:01] and let us read two passages of
[1:07:03] scripture
[1:07:04] Romans 8.
[1:07:22] verse um
[1:07:26] 18 and 19 so this is even a scripture
[1:07:29] for this morning amen
[1:07:31] uh for I reckon
[1:07:34] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:07:39] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:07:43] glory
[1:07:44] which shall be revealed
[1:07:48] and us
[1:07:51] so the glory
[1:07:53] is not
[1:07:55] uh just the glory that'll be found in
[1:07:58] our savior
[1:08:00] and the glory is not just the glory that
[1:08:03] will be found uh in God's prophet
[1:08:08] but according to the scripture the glory
[1:08:12] is supposed to be revealed
[1:08:14] in US
[1:08:16] for the earnest expectation
[1:08:19] of the creature wadeth for the
[1:08:21] manifestation
[1:08:24] of the sons of God all right let's uh go
[1:08:29] back over here to Esther
[1:08:39] and I'm in chapter four
[1:08:43] and we are reading here just start at
[1:08:46] verse 10 if we can let's start there uh
[1:08:51] and it says
[1:08:52] again that's to speak unto a talk
[1:08:56] and gave him commandment unto Mordecai
[1:09:01] all the king's servants and the people
[1:09:04] of the king's provinces
[1:09:06] do know that whatsoever that whosoever
[1:09:10] whether man or woman shall come unto the
[1:09:13] king into the inner Court
[1:09:16] who is not called
[1:09:18] there is one law of his to put him to
[1:09:22] death except such to whom the king shall
[1:09:26] hold out the golden scepter
[1:09:28] that he may live
[1:09:30] but I have not been called to come in
[1:09:33] unto the king these 30 days
[1:09:37] and they told to Mordecai Esther's words
[1:09:40] then Mordecai commanded
[1:09:43] to answer Esther think not with thyself
[1:09:48] that thou shall Escape in the King's
[1:09:51] house more than all the Jews
[1:09:54] for if thou all together hold is thy
[1:09:57] peace at this time
[1:09:59] then shall their uh enlargement and
[1:10:02] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:10:04] another place but thou in that father's
[1:10:07] house shall be destroyed and who knoweth
[1:10:09] whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for
[1:10:12] such a time as this uh that has to be
[1:10:16] them return Mordecai's answer go
[1:10:21] gather together all the Jews that are
[1:10:24] present in shushan and fast she for me
[1:10:28] and neither eat nor drink three days
[1:10:30] night or day I also and my maidens will
[1:10:34] Fast likewise and so will I go in to the
[1:10:38] King which is not according to the law
[1:10:41] and she put these words a man there for
[1:10:46] Uncle Mordecai to see
[1:10:49] and if I perish
[1:10:51] Hallelujah
[1:10:53] I perish
[1:10:55] good God Almighty so Mordecai went his
[1:10:57] way and then according to all that
[1:11:00] Esther had commanded him
[1:11:02] amen let's pray father we thank you uh
[1:11:05] for your word
[1:11:08] and uh that has been read but may the
[1:11:10] Holy Spirit now take father what has
[1:11:12] been read and uh Lord just make it come
[1:11:15] alive for us at this time that we would
[1:11:18] not just see a Bible story but we'll see
[1:11:21] Lord ourselves Amen in the scripture and
[1:11:24] we'll see your great plan for us I pray
[1:11:27] God that you would open our
[1:11:28] understanding spiritual understanding
[1:11:31] open it father that we would uh we would
[1:11:34] rise to a higher level in you God on
[1:11:37] today May the light of the Gospel shine
[1:11:41] into our circumstances and situations
[1:11:43] and may it bring change just as it did
[1:11:46] in the beginning when the spiritual
[1:11:48] Earth was without form and it was void
[1:11:50] and darkness upon the face of the deep
[1:11:52] deep it was light that brought change so
[1:11:55] may light uh bring change again today in
[1:11:58] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[1:12:02] you you can be seated
[1:12:09] um I'm taking the title uh for such a
[1:12:13] time as this a man we want to just uh
[1:12:17] use that and
[1:12:19] um
[1:12:20] there is um
[1:12:23] so much plaguing us amen uh even in the
[1:12:26] day in which we live I was just you know
[1:12:29] just kind of thinking to myself
[1:12:31] um one of the big things that our
[1:12:33] children are growing up under is a a
[1:12:36] world that is absolutely confused
[1:12:40] amen uh who would have ever thought that
[1:12:43] uh people would be trying to redefine uh
[1:12:47] what a boy is and what a girl is
[1:12:50] right I mean that that to me is one of
[1:12:53] the most basic uh things of life it's
[1:12:57] very obvious for us to know what a boy
[1:12:59] is and what a girl is but they're
[1:13:01] they're teaching our children that they
[1:13:03] can be whatever they want to be uh when
[1:13:06] they want to be in so this morning if
[1:13:08] you feel like a girl then you can be a
[1:13:11] girl amen if you feel like a boy then
[1:13:13] you can be a boy uh none of this stuff
[1:13:16] uh is is a is in alignment with the word
[1:13:19] of God Amen completely outside of the
[1:13:22] word of God right when God made man he
[1:13:25] he made him he made them male and female
[1:13:28] that's when God made them but God took
[1:13:31] the female Spirit out of a man and he
[1:13:35] made a woman that's what God
[1:13:37] orchestrated and uh and here we are
[1:13:40] living in in some of the most difficult
[1:13:42] times I I I you know I just begin to as
[1:13:45] I meditate this I think about the
[1:13:47] teachers and man what about our teachers
[1:13:50] that that have to go to school and here
[1:13:53] comes uh John
[1:13:55] amen and you know that boy is John
[1:13:58] but today he feels like Janetta
[1:14:03] and and he wants to be called Jeanetta
[1:14:06] and the teacher has to sit there and be
[1:14:08] uh she has to call him by this this name
[1:14:11] that he want to be called but that's not
[1:14:13] what's on your birth certificate son
[1:14:15] John is your name on the birth
[1:14:17] certificate praise the Lord but you know
[1:14:20] you can imagine that and even some of
[1:14:22] the co-workers that we have I mean the
[1:14:24] people that are working in the workforce
[1:14:25] and and some of your co-workers that are
[1:14:27] going through some of these things and
[1:14:28] like you know one day they this and the
[1:14:30] next day they that I mean it's just all
[1:14:33] kind of things that's going on and I
[1:14:35] know sometimes I remember one of the
[1:14:36] brothers um uh from Africa he come and
[1:14:39] he had he got a job here and uh he was
[1:14:41] working and and and and somebody went
[1:14:43] through a change over the weekend and uh
[1:14:46] and he knew them as whatever their name
[1:14:49] was and they come in underneath this
[1:14:52] change uh that have been changed over
[1:14:54] the weekend and now they don't want to
[1:14:56] recall that no more but he kept calling
[1:14:58] them by their original name and uh Danny
[1:15:00] got in trouble with ar HR said you got
[1:15:02] to call him by that and I said no this
[1:15:04] is who they are and that's what I'm
[1:15:06] calling by by his original name and I
[1:15:09] said well no they don't want to be
[1:15:10] called at no more I'm sorry I'm gonna
[1:15:12] call about original he end up losing his
[1:15:15] job because he wouldn't call him by
[1:15:17] another name what about our saints that
[1:15:20] are working in human resources
[1:15:22] my God all kind of stuff you and all you
[1:15:25] want to do is just get a job and go to
[1:15:26] work but we we uh uh uh uh surrounded by
[1:15:30] sin
[1:15:32] everywhere we turn is sin
[1:15:35] hallelujah amen but but yet and still we
[1:15:39] are Christians in the midst of Satan's
[1:15:41] Eden
[1:15:42] and and and being Christians we have a
[1:15:44] we have a conviction Upon Our Lives that
[1:15:47] amen we got to do things in accordance
[1:15:49] to the word of God
[1:15:50] hallelujah amen amen let me just kind of
[1:15:54] uh slip into something else here real
[1:15:56] quick but uh here just a
[1:15:59] a little little statement that's coming
[1:16:01] from this message adoption or placing
[1:16:04] um and I'm gonna I think quote from this
[1:16:06] sermon maybe three different times uh
[1:16:09] but here you know this first one brother
[1:16:11] Brandon makes this statement says but
[1:16:13] the purpose of this and I want to make
[1:16:16] sure that we uh we we understand what's
[1:16:18] your purpose for coming to church
[1:16:20] well what's your purpose for being here
[1:16:23] what's your purpose for serving the lord
[1:16:26] right I mean you you got you got a
[1:16:28] greater purpose than just filling up
[1:16:30] chairs this morning
[1:16:32] come on somebody amen you got a greater
[1:16:35] like like brother
[1:16:37] um Chris Kathy said the other day think
[1:16:39] about you know all the other churches
[1:16:41] that gather around us why why would God
[1:16:44] bring you to the message why would they
[1:16:46] allow your family to get connected to
[1:16:48] this message God has a greater purpose
[1:16:51] than what we realize Hallelujah it said
[1:16:54] but the purpose of this he says this is
[1:16:58] seeing your position in Christ
[1:17:02] glory to God Amen the purpose of this is
[1:17:06] you seeing your position in Christ
[1:17:09] oh Hallelujah let me just pause just for
[1:17:12] a second I'm I'm I'm gonna get all this
[1:17:14] while I was here in prayer this morning
[1:17:16] the Lord just kind of brought something
[1:17:17] to my attention amen and um you know
[1:17:21] when we come to church uh the word is
[1:17:24] what changes us
[1:17:26] the word is what transforms us the word
[1:17:29] is what makes a difference inside of our
[1:17:31] life it's got to be the word not the
[1:17:33] singing amen it's got to be the word
[1:17:35] that makes the difference in your life
[1:17:37] it's the word that gives you overcoming
[1:17:39] power it's the word that gives you
[1:17:42] strength over the enemy it's the word
[1:17:44] that does these things right so so you
[1:17:46] know the Lord just kind of saying
[1:17:47] oftentimes we come to church and amen we
[1:17:50] will we will hear a word about this so
[1:17:52] about that and sometimes we say uh
[1:17:55] second Pastor get them Pastor get them
[1:17:57] talk about that Pastor yeah because
[1:18:00] you're right where I need you to be
[1:18:01] Pastor hey Lord let let the word get my
[1:18:04] wife let the word get my husband let the
[1:18:07] word get my children and I was just
[1:18:10] thinking about to see see we won't
[1:18:11] change to happen from the outside
[1:18:15] come on somebody that's what the Lord
[1:18:17] just kind of told me this morning we
[1:18:19] want change to happen from the outside
[1:18:21] and what I mean by that is that you want
[1:18:23] to see everybody else change but you
[1:18:25] remain the same
[1:18:28] but change does not happen like that
[1:18:31] amen change happens from the inside so
[1:18:35] rather than worried about everybody else
[1:18:38] come on get that moat I mean get the
[1:18:40] Beam not your own eye and stop worrying
[1:18:43] about the molding somebody else's eye
[1:18:46] let the word change you and if you let
[1:18:49] it change you it'll change the situation
[1:18:52] come on somebody change happens from the
[1:18:56] inside
[1:18:58] we all think we're right
[1:19:00] we all think we're right but there's no
[1:19:03] no the reason you're going through what
[1:19:04] you're going through because you're
[1:19:05] wrong
[1:19:09] amen so God God said let the change
[1:19:12] happen from the inside stop worrying
[1:19:13] about your neighbor worry about you hear
[1:19:16] the word for you today
[1:19:18] the purpose of this
[1:19:21] is seeing your position in Christ
[1:19:23] seeing that it's not something that you
[1:19:26] just stumbled into
[1:19:27] oh Hallelujah this message is not
[1:19:30] something that I stumbled into hey I was
[1:19:33] predestinated to come to this
[1:19:36] amen look he says he says not just
[1:19:38] something you stumbled into a something
[1:19:40] that might uh you married it somewhere
[1:19:43] but it's what God did for you himself
[1:19:46] not that you were so good that you went
[1:19:48] to church one night that some poor
[1:19:50] brother LED you up to the Altar and it
[1:19:52] wasn't that it was God before the
[1:19:56] foundation of the world
[1:19:58] predestinated you to eternal life
[1:20:02] you need to think about your journey now
[1:20:04] how did you get here God predestinated
[1:20:06] you to eternal life when you get there
[1:20:09] that day no wonder the 24 Elders laid
[1:20:13] off their crowns everybody laid down the
[1:20:15] crown everyone fell on their knees they
[1:20:17] didn't have one thing they could say no
[1:20:19] preacher no Elder no nothing all praise
[1:20:22] to the lamb God will gather in him all
[1:20:25] things at that day oh if we'd ever know
[1:20:27] and recognize who that was who they
[1:20:29] crucified so so he just kind of letting
[1:20:33] us uh see just in this little thought
[1:20:34] here that it's not by mistake that you
[1:20:37] hear
[1:20:38] it's not by accident you stumbling into
[1:20:40] this message that's not what happened
[1:20:42] God Amen by predestination allows you to
[1:20:46] come in contact with light
[1:20:48] that's why brother Smiley was trying to
[1:20:50] tell you and he and he's saying say had
[1:20:52] he not experienced light he would not be
[1:20:56] the man he is today had we not
[1:20:59] experienced light we would not be the
[1:21:01] people that we are today
[1:21:04] thank God that his son Delights Amen in
[1:21:07] our in in in in our souls I want to just
[1:21:10] pick up another little thought here
[1:21:11] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:21:14] oh Hallelujah to the Lamb of God
[1:21:17] amen just a few thoughts the prophet
[1:21:21] just kind of shared with us and I want
[1:21:22] to share them with you he says this the
[1:21:25] new birth is Christ
[1:21:26] amen it's the revelation God has
[1:21:31] revealed to you this great mystery now
[1:21:34] that's a powerful statement God has
[1:21:37] revealed to you
[1:21:40] this great mystery you know there's many
[1:21:43] people walk around on the Earth today
[1:21:45] without a revelation
[1:21:46] they have no understanding been around
[1:21:49] church for years but still don't have a
[1:21:51] revelation of what this is all about
[1:21:54] and I'm gonna tell you something I I'm
[1:21:56] not just going to church for uh a hiccup
[1:21:59] Messiah
[1:22:00] and I'm not just going to church to hear
[1:22:03] good choir
[1:22:04] amen I'm not going I want to hear the
[1:22:06] word of God something that'll Transform
[1:22:08] Me
[1:22:09] something that has changed me from the
[1:22:11] inside right I mean I really I want to
[1:22:13] draw closer to God Amen that's my
[1:22:16] purpose of going to church the new birth
[1:22:18] is a revelation God has revealed to you
[1:22:21] this great mystery and that's a new
[1:22:23] birth now that now now what are you
[1:22:26] gonna do when you get all that group
[1:22:28] together where the Revelation is
[1:22:30] perfectly in Harmony and God expressing
[1:22:33] it through his word by the same anxious
[1:22:35] the same things that he did making the
[1:22:38] word manifest I love this statement oh
[1:22:42] if the church
[1:22:44] only knew its position
[1:22:47] and I like this this is the promised
[1:22:50] part of it this is amen this is what I
[1:22:52] feel like we're coming to right now he
[1:22:54] says it will one day
[1:22:56] Glory that tells me you might struggle
[1:22:59] with certain things right now but
[1:23:01] there's a promise looming over your life
[1:23:03] you will understand one day
[1:23:06] the revelation will unfold to you one
[1:23:09] day but just walk in a little light that
[1:23:11] you do have
[1:23:13] amen oh is the church newest position it
[1:23:16] will one day look at this then the
[1:23:19] Rapture will go when it knows what it is
[1:23:23] so my my purpose my purpose is to try to
[1:23:27] help the people realize who they are
[1:23:30] in Christ
[1:23:31] now you know
[1:23:33] um oftentimes we don't realize it and
[1:23:35] and I didn't bring the quote but I'll
[1:23:37] just tell you what the prophet said he
[1:23:38] said we let little things pull this out
[1:23:41] of us
[1:23:44] uh
[1:23:45] he says you
[1:23:48] you let it
[1:23:50] no no I'm not talking about the devil
[1:23:52] brought a trial on my way and and and
[1:23:54] and and and I I wasn't expecting this
[1:23:56] and the devil did this that no no no no
[1:23:58] no no no no no no no no no no no you you
[1:24:00] mature enough in Christ now
[1:24:04] that's right you've been in this for 20
[1:24:06] something years now
[1:24:07] 30 years you've been in this 10 years
[1:24:10] you've been in this you were maturing up
[1:24:12] in Christ now where you are allowing
[1:24:15] certain things to keep happening over
[1:24:18] and over and I'm gonna tell you
[1:24:20] something you are allowing it to happen
[1:24:24] y'all ain't got me yet
[1:24:26] you are allowing yourself to get into
[1:24:29] that argument
[1:24:30] come on Church practical teaching again
[1:24:34] you are allowing yourself to go through
[1:24:37] them struggles on the job like that
[1:24:39] you allowing your boss to do certain
[1:24:41] things to you
[1:24:45] come on Church you are allowing that
[1:24:48] you're not even taking a stand for
[1:24:50] nothing you have not even changed your
[1:24:52] strategy or how you're gonna fight in
[1:24:55] the battle you have not made any
[1:24:57] adjustments at all you looking for other
[1:25:00] people to change but change starts on
[1:25:03] the inside
[1:25:08] you without you allow the devil to take
[1:25:10] these things from you
[1:25:12] but you know what you know we we're not
[1:25:14] we're not going we're not gonna lower
[1:25:15] ourselves to where the devil is
[1:25:18] amen we gonna raise this thing up and I
[1:25:21] want I want to I want to just get this
[1:25:22] to church you got a purpose for being
[1:25:24] here
[1:25:25] you you got I got God God had a much
[1:25:28] greater plan in his mind than you just
[1:25:30] sitting in a chair
[1:25:34] just to say I go to this church God God
[1:25:36] got a greater plan than that in mind
[1:25:39] why would he bring you to the truth why
[1:25:43] are we allow your ears to hear it why
[1:25:45] would they allow your eyes to see these
[1:25:47] things why would God do that
[1:25:51] all the other people on the Earth that
[1:25:53] are just just just just running right by
[1:25:55] truth
[1:25:56] standing right next to the truth
[1:25:59] and won't give no ear to it why would
[1:26:02] God allow you to see it
[1:26:06] it's a big word it's called
[1:26:07] predestination
[1:26:10] and and let me tell you another thing
[1:26:12] God didn't just bring you here just so
[1:26:14] you can just hear it God brought you
[1:26:18] here so you could be it oh yeah
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:25] amen God wants you to be it not just
[1:26:29] hear it but you're gonna be it
[1:26:36] let's look at a scripture
[1:26:39] Psalms 82.
[1:26:42] brother Solomon caught this one a few
[1:26:44] weeks ago and he was make mention of it
[1:26:45] and I and when he called me about it I
[1:26:48] said you you talk about you talk about
[1:26:49] this you say yeah that's exactly what
[1:26:51] I'm talking about it's just things
[1:26:53] that's written in the Bible that we just
[1:26:56] been reading and it's just going right
[1:26:58] over the top of us
[1:27:01] i i before before I even get to the
[1:27:03] scripture before I get to the scripture
[1:27:05] before I before I before I pull it up on
[1:27:07] the screen you know where you know where
[1:27:09] I'm worshiping that this morning and

[1:27:44] surprised by nothing
[1:27:46] God ain't never caught off guard by
[1:27:48] nothing
[1:27:50] I mean when situation rise he just act
[1:27:52] who he is
[1:27:53] right it just bring out certain
[1:27:55] attributes in him and that's the same
[1:27:57] way it should be for us as Believers
[1:27:58] when certain things come it should just
[1:28:00] bring out certain attributes
[1:28:02] this happens speak to it
[1:28:05] yes sir yes sir and you have the
[1:28:08] authority
[1:28:10] because of the Holy Ghost living inside

[1:28:24] why you still fussing you don't tried
[1:28:27] that strategy it has not worked stop
[1:28:29] fussing and fighting and just speak and
[1:28:31] move forward when God said let there be
[1:28:34] light
[1:28:37] hey that's the Bible right there
[1:28:40] amen I don't care if it took a billion
[1:28:43] years before light came the Bible

[1:34:27] no no
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:28] no
[1:34:30] Lord let it start in me
[1:34:34] I'm gonna tell you something about a god
[1:34:36] before I read the scripture
[1:34:38] a God got to be willing to die
[1:34:40] [Applause]
[1:34:46] amen yes Lord yeah oh God got to be
[1:34:49] willing to take up his cross
[1:34:51] and follow
[1:34:53] I'm talking about the one that's really
[1:34:55] in control
[1:34:56] and one that understands their role amen
[1:34:59] he's got to be willing to die she's got
[1:35:02] to be willing to die
[1:35:06] I ain't just making it up it's in the
[1:35:08] word David actually wrote about it
[1:35:11] all right the purpose is you know your
[1:35:13] position
[1:35:14] look at what David said here
[1:35:17] in Psalms 82.
[1:35:25] standeth in the congregation of the
[1:35:28] mighty
[1:35:29] hello not the weaklings
[1:35:32] not the defeated ones
[1:35:34] but the mighty
[1:35:36] and I'm standing in the congregation of
[1:35:38] the mighty
[1:35:42] he judges
[1:35:44] among
[1:35:46] the Gods
[1:35:49] I'm talking about you he judges among
[1:35:52] the gods
[1:35:54] skip down here to verse 6.
[1:35:59] I have said
[1:36:01] this God now I have said
[1:36:04] ye are
[1:36:06] gods
[1:36:10] and all of you are children
[1:36:14] of the most high
[1:36:19] but look at this one
[1:36:20] but ye shall die like men
[1:36:24] and fall like one of the princes
[1:36:27] so yes one thing to recognize your
[1:36:30] position
[1:36:31] as as a God because he's living on the
[1:36:34] inside of you right but but I understand
[1:36:37] that as a God you're gonna have to do
[1:36:39] some things that's going to cause you to
[1:36:41] die
[1:36:42] to yourself die to your flesh that are
[1:36:46] your emotions that are your feelings die
[1:36:49] to your thoughts and let me tell you
[1:36:51] something except the corner wheat go on
[1:36:53] the ground and bye
[1:36:57] you know what happens a one that refuses
[1:36:59] to die
[1:37:01] they abide
[1:37:04] alone
[1:37:06] hello somebody if you refuse to die you
[1:37:11] will abide alone
[1:37:13] but once you take your corner wheat into
[1:37:16] the Earth and you die
[1:37:19] the process is not
[1:37:21] death
[1:37:24] come on the process is not just being
[1:37:27] buried
[1:37:28] y'all ain't gonna let me preach
[1:37:32] the process don't stop it you just being
[1:37:34] bare
[1:37:40] bear because once the seed goes in the
[1:37:42] ground and dies the Bible says it'll
[1:37:45] bring forth much fruit
[1:37:47] but before you can start producing fruit
[1:37:50] you got to go through the process of
[1:37:52] growth
[1:37:56] come on Church you got to be willing to
[1:37:58] go through the process of growth
[1:38:01] and at the end of that process of growth
[1:38:03] you'll see just so much fruit coming out
[1:38:04] of your life but it started with a death
[1:38:11] Life Starts
[1:38:13] with the death
[1:38:17] all right
[1:38:19] all right let me keep on reading here
[1:38:22] I'm a uh I gotta skip some of these
[1:38:24] things I I won't I won't read
[1:38:26] um
[1:38:28] I won't read this out let me just quote
[1:38:30] these these three things to you uh out
[1:38:32] of Crisis and Mr God revealed uh brother
[1:38:34] random you know told us there that God
[1:38:37] had a threefold purpose
[1:38:39] and uh and this threefold purpose was uh
[1:38:42] first thing that God wanted to do
[1:38:44] let's first reveal himself to his people
[1:38:47] and I want you to know who I am uh I
[1:38:50] don't want to be so mysterious to you
[1:38:51] that that you don't know who I am I want
[1:38:53] to make myself real to you that was the
[1:38:56] very first thing God wanted to just
[1:38:57] reveal himself to his people right uh
[1:39:00] the second thing amen that God wants is
[1:39:04] to have the preeminence uh in his body
[1:39:07] of Believers and what that means is that
[1:39:09] God want to be able to lead you God want
[1:39:12] to be able to guide you God want to be
[1:39:14] able to kind of talk to you and have you
[1:39:16] uh just following his instructions and
[1:39:18] I'm it makes it much easier when we just
[1:39:20] follow what the Lord tells us to do amen
[1:39:22] not fight against his will and what what
[1:39:24] is but but let them have the preeminence
[1:39:26] let him live through you his word
[1:39:28] don't fight don't fight him don't fight
[1:39:30] him with that amen just just Lord if
[1:39:32] this what your word said and I just want
[1:39:33] I want to yield to that God wants to
[1:39:35] have that type of PM another thing is
[1:39:37] I'm I'm I'ma just put it like this
[1:39:40] um
[1:39:41] God is a gentleman
[1:39:44] and um
[1:39:46] God won't won't force himself on you
[1:39:52] God want to see you you know it's just
[1:39:54] like in a husband and wife relationship
[1:39:56] it's got to be love going in both
[1:39:58] directions
[1:40:00] praise the Lord I mean people want and
[1:40:02] God want to feel love coming in in his
[1:40:05] Direction and the way that you show God
[1:40:07] that you love him that no matter what
[1:40:09] trial you're going through that you
[1:40:10] still serving Faithfully in the midst of
[1:40:12] it that's how you show God that you love
[1:40:13] him all right so so God wants to have
[1:40:16] the preeminence Amen in you and the
[1:40:19] third thing that God wanted to do was
[1:40:20] restore the kingdom to his right
[1:40:23] position that failed by sin uh by the
[1:40:26] first Adam God wants to restore us back
[1:40:28] to Eden conditions again this is why as
[1:40:31] a God you can speak out of your mouth we
[1:40:33] are going back to that condition
[1:40:36] that's what Jesus going to the Cross was
[1:40:38] all about to take us back to that place
[1:40:39] you understand amen so now just just
[1:40:42] follow me here amen uh these three
[1:40:45] things first God wanted us to reveal
[1:40:47] himself to his people secondly have
[1:40:49] preeminence in his Believers third
[1:40:51] restore it back to the position that it
[1:40:53] fell uh When sin entered into the world
[1:40:56] he want to restore us back to that
[1:40:57] condition this is where we're headed
[1:40:59] back to all right now
[1:41:01] let me um just kind of oh my I'm going
[1:41:05] towards the end of my my notes there is
[1:41:08] probably going to be on the second page
[1:41:09] I want to just bring in a quote from
[1:41:11] things that are to be things that are to
[1:41:14] be I want you to hear what the prophet
[1:41:16] says about you Amen in this things that
[1:41:18] are to be all right
[1:41:20] now the only way you can be a son or a
[1:41:24] daughter of God
[1:41:25] because you have to have eternal life he
[1:41:27] says there's only one form of eternal
[1:41:30] life and that's God's life look at this
[1:41:33] amen it says only one form eternal life
[1:41:35] and that was God now now this is
[1:41:37] important you cannot die and go to hell
[1:41:41] and live eternally
[1:41:44] the church is missing this mixing mixing
[1:41:47] it up a little bit there's only one form
[1:41:49] of eternal life and that's the life that
[1:41:51] you receive from Christ you can't reject
[1:41:55] Christ and get eternal life
[1:41:57] it don't happen like that at some point
[1:42:00] in time it's going to come to an end
[1:42:02] that life in hell will come to an end
[1:42:06] right so so there's only one form
[1:42:08] eternal life and that's what you receive
[1:42:09] from Christ look at this he says there
[1:42:12] there to be a Son of God you had to be
[1:42:15] in him always to be a Son of God you had
[1:42:17] to be in him always I like this
[1:42:19] statement the gene of your life I wish I
[1:42:23] could just stop there and preach the
[1:42:25] gene of your life your spiritual life
[1:42:28] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:42:31] there was even a molecule
[1:42:34] the gene of your life
[1:42:37] oh I could just walk y'all through some
[1:42:40] some you know each one of y'all got a
[1:42:42] story and I could just walk you through
[1:42:43] your story how you come in contact amen
[1:42:46] with real life how light was expressed
[1:42:50] to you
[1:42:51] and when light shined upon the gene of
[1:42:54] your life
[1:42:55] praise God you couldn't go anywhere else
[1:42:58] some of y'all don't try to go other
[1:43:01] places
[1:43:03] amen you done tried it amen but
[1:43:05] something it's something that that just
[1:43:07] caused you to be magnetized right back
[1:43:09] to sometimes you don't even agree with
[1:43:11] everything that's being said from this
[1:43:12] Pulpit but you can't go nowhere else
[1:43:17] why do you think you're having a problem
[1:43:20] why you think the other one that go to
[1:43:22] the to that church don't have no problem
[1:43:24] why you got to have a problem
[1:43:27] I'm talking real good now sometimes you
[1:43:31] want to look like them sometimes you
[1:43:33] want to act like them sometimes you want
[1:43:35] to be like them but deep down inside you
[1:43:38] know you're not like them
[1:43:42] why am I so connected to this
[1:43:45] there's a gene inside of you a gene that
[1:43:49] came from God
[1:43:52] and everybody ain't got that team
[1:43:59] oh my if that let me just make it let me
[1:44:02] make it a little bit more simpler
[1:44:05] um
[1:44:06] and families there are certain genes
[1:44:08] that run yeah
[1:44:09] those are certain genes amen and
[1:44:12] everybody don't get every Gene
[1:44:14] hello
[1:44:17] you know like like it's sometimes a gene
[1:44:20] that a young man start losing his head a
[1:44:22] certain age
[1:44:23] it's a gene that came out of that family
[1:44:26] maybe in the way that the young lady
[1:44:28] might be built
[1:44:30] her shape it's a gene and then one
[1:44:33] sister might not get the gene
[1:44:35] y'all ain't gonna talk to me
[1:44:40] but it's a gene that flows through
[1:44:43] some got it
[1:44:44] some don't
[1:44:46] I'm so glad that I got the gene from God
[1:44:51] and I know some got it and summed out
[1:44:54] but I doubt it that's why I'm magnetized
[1:44:57] to this truth
[1:45:00] it's like a magnet I'm just connecting
[1:45:02] you get a real serious magnet it's hard
[1:45:04] to pull them apart
[1:45:05] it take I mean you got to really work to
[1:45:07] pull that thing apart
[1:45:09] stop working on this one
[1:45:11] you ain't gonna pull this one apart
[1:45:16] all right
[1:45:18] um the dream of your life spiritual life
[1:45:19] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:45:21] there was even a molecule
[1:45:23] and you are nothing
[1:45:25] I I I'm I'm talking to you you are
[1:45:29] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:45:33] gene of life that was in God as a son of
[1:45:37] God
[1:45:39] look at this now you're expressed after
[1:45:42] his word come in you
[1:45:45] and what the word come in to do to light

[1:46:24] doors of a church

[1:46:58] light up the age

[1:48:17] daughter God says uh uh you send the
[1:48:20] church tonight because your duties
[1:48:21] Express God to his nation and his people
[1:48:23] and this neighborhood where you
[1:48:24] associate wherever you are God knew that
[1:48:27] you would be here because you have to be
[1:48:28] one of his genes or his attributes you
[1:48:32] had to be if you've ever if you've got
[1:48:34] eternal life then it was always it
[1:48:38] always was eternal life and God before
[1:48:40] there was a foundation World knew that
[1:48:42] you would be here I like this and the
[1:48:45] word or the washing of the water of the
[1:48:48] word fell upon you you was expressed in
[1:48:51] a being now you have fellowship with
[1:48:53] your father God just as you as you have
[1:48:57] with your Earthly father see your
[1:48:59] citizens of the king not citizens but
[1:49:02] your children Sons and Daughters of the
[1:49:06] Living God if it be that the eternal
[1:49:08] life dwells in you now then if it was
[1:49:10] Jesus was the fullness of God manifested
[1:49:13] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:49:15] bodily therefore for when he came to
[1:49:17] Earth and was manifesting flesh you were
[1:49:20] here in him then because he was the word
[1:49:25] in the beginning was the word glory to
[1:49:27] God Amen
[1:49:29] um it says uh the word was with God the
[1:49:32] Word was God the word was made flesh and
[1:49:33] dwelt Among Us and I don't have this
[1:49:35] quote but I'm just tell you this brother
[1:49:37] Braham say the word that was made flesh
[1:49:39] and Jesus has now been made flesh in US
[1:49:43] that same word is now made flesh in us
[1:49:45] right it says in the beginning was the
[1:49:47] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:49:48] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:49:49] dwelled Among Us the word was made flesh
[1:49:52] therefore you walk with him you were in
[1:49:54] him when he was on when he was on Earth
[1:49:56] you suffered with him you died with him
[1:49:58] you was buried with him and now you're
[1:50:00] risen with him and manifested attributes
[1:50:04] of God setting in Heavenly places
[1:50:06] already raised I like that statement
[1:50:09] right there you're not waiting to get up
[1:50:11] you already up amen amen you're not
[1:50:14] waiting to get the victory already
[1:50:15] fighting from a place of Victory amen
[1:50:18] already raised resurrected to New Life
[1:50:21] and setting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:50:23] Jesus oh that means so much nowadays
[1:50:25] church that means so much to us to see
[1:50:28] ourselves positionally placed in Jesus
[1:50:30] Christ now this is uh to me very very
[1:50:33] important
[1:50:34] last week you know
[1:50:37] um I was um
[1:50:39] while we were there at the meeting
[1:50:41] brother Paul just began to kind of go
[1:50:43] back to Esther and just it blessed me
[1:50:45] and just just a little thought now let's
[1:50:47] let's just walk through a story just a
[1:50:49] little bit amen just for a few minutes
[1:50:52] Esther
[1:50:53] uh lost her parents at a very young age
[1:50:58] and had to be raised by her uncle
[1:51:00] Mordecai
[1:51:03] and uh you know Esther's in his
[1:51:05] household and and I was just reading
[1:51:07] something I think earlier where it said
[1:51:10] that this whole story of Estes is is
[1:51:12] something that happened really over a 12
[1:51:14] year period
[1:51:17] the whole story I want you to think
[1:51:18] about that I mean just look back over
[1:51:20] the last 12 years of your life for the
[1:51:22] last 10 years of life and think about
[1:51:23] the various things that have happened
[1:51:25] Right Now esther going through I lost my
[1:51:28] mama I lost my daddy now I'm an orphan
[1:51:31] and now I I I'm being raised by my uncle
[1:51:34] and and maybe when she looking at her
[1:51:36] uncle man this guy's a very strict guy
[1:51:38] you know and like I really just it's the
[1:51:41] only household I can be raised in ain't
[1:51:43] no other relatives that I could go to
[1:51:45] why Uncle Mordecai
[1:51:48] why Uncle Mordecai but seeing that
[1:51:51] that's the way we question God sometimes
[1:51:53] why am I a part of this and why that God
[1:51:56] got purpose God had a purpose for why
[1:51:59] Esther was raised in Mordecai's house
[1:52:02] oh Hallelujah Esther couldn't understand
[1:52:06] the purpose asked to concede the things
[1:52:08] that God saw but God specifically placed
[1:52:12] her under a house that had very
[1:52:14] restrictive rules
[1:52:17] sometimes our children may get a little
[1:52:19] upset while you would have let me do
[1:52:21] this and maybe this and maybe that mamas
[1:52:23] and daddies you ain't got to apologize
[1:52:25] for how you raised them especially when
[1:52:27] you raise them in the ways of God
[1:52:29] now if you raise them in the ways of the
[1:52:30] devil that's a different thing but if
[1:52:32] you raise them the best you could in the
[1:52:34] ways of God don't you apologize
[1:52:39] amen the reason being you know why if
[1:52:41] you were to let down the bars at that
[1:52:43] stage in their life
[1:52:45] they would have been much worse than
[1:52:46] they are right now
[1:52:49] they would even much worse than where
[1:52:51] they are right now I had to hold up a
[1:52:54] standard to keep that thing away from
[1:52:55] you
[1:52:57] I knew what you were fighting
[1:53:00] see when you get away from the standard
[1:53:02] look at what happens to your life but
[1:53:04] they got to come to their own Revelation
[1:53:05] someday
[1:53:07] but Paris you ain't got to apologize for
[1:53:09] that no I did the best I could I tried
[1:53:12] to raise you the right way I tried to do
[1:53:14] things the right way now listen if you
[1:53:17] did some things wrong you go back and
[1:53:18] apologize for what's wrong
[1:53:20] I'm gonna just say that to someone's too
[1:53:22] big to apologize
[1:53:27] way too big you got too much pride
[1:53:30] that's too much pride when you came
[1:53:31] apart and especially if you can't say
[1:53:33] sorry to young children
[1:53:36] amen amen where you expect that where
[1:53:40] you expect children to see Christ at at
[1:53:42] home demonstrated by the parents
[1:53:45] all right so truth in it high
[1:53:49] that they hear you calling somebody on
[1:53:51] the phone brother I'm sorry sister I'm
[1:53:53] sorry you know I ain't really mean that
[1:53:54] them kids hear you say that and they
[1:53:56] sitting right there next to him you
[1:53:57] can't say sorry to them
[1:53:59] well you you you you no you you were
[1:54:03] you're a human being made in God's image
[1:54:06] and you deserve my apology
[1:54:12] boy that thing get quiet Lord
[1:54:18] but but here here is is in his house of
[1:54:21] Mordecai
[1:54:22] Mordecai very very strict uncle
[1:54:25] does things by the word very unique guy
[1:54:28] and we we realize this because Mordecai
[1:54:31] you know is the only one in this in this
[1:54:33] area that will not bow down the Haman
[1:54:35] this guy got a a different temperament
[1:54:38] this guy built from I mean he's built
[1:54:42] differently made differently he act
[1:54:43] differently
[1:54:44] yeah but this is this is Esther's uncle
[1:54:47] well God allows for a little situation
[1:54:49] to rise up in the Kingdom with vastly
[1:54:51] don't want to come and do her duties as
[1:54:53] as the wife amen she'll want to come do
[1:54:56] it and and say well you know put her
[1:54:58] away and get us another queen and as
[1:55:00] they go looking through the land and
[1:55:01] find themselves a a fair virgin they
[1:55:04] find Esther she takes some advice from
[1:55:06] from uh from an uncle said now don't
[1:55:09] tell them who you are don't tell them
[1:55:10] you're a Jew don't say nothing about
[1:55:12] that just gotta go right on through like
[1:55:14] like if they don't act don't tell
[1:55:18] so Esther makes it through and she
[1:55:20] becomes a queen Hallelujah and you can
[1:55:23] imagine something that happened over a
[1:55:24] 12 year period she's a young lady when
[1:55:26] this is going on here she is she's made
[1:55:28] the queen and I want you to just kind of
[1:55:30] kind of get this because here's the
[1:55:32] thought that brother brother Paul
[1:55:33] brought and I just appreciate it
[1:55:36] being Queen was not the ultimate place
[1:55:39] that God had for Esther
[1:55:44] being Queen was not where God wanted to
[1:55:48] stop no that was a place a man to allow
[1:55:52] you to do what I need you to do
[1:55:56] amen you know as Queen Hallelujah as
[1:56:01] Queen she was the only one it was only
[1:56:04] really two people in the Kingdom that
[1:56:05] were higher than Haman
[1:56:08] Haman was actually going to change some
[1:56:10] things for the Jews but because there
[1:56:12] was a woman sitting there on the throne
[1:56:15] amen glory to God a woman that
[1:56:18] recognized her position
[1:56:20] At first she didn't she didn't catch it
[1:56:22] at first that's why she was going back
[1:56:24] and forth with her Uncle glory to God
[1:56:26] she's like now now look look look look
[1:56:28] uh you know if I go and the King does
[1:56:30] not hold out that golden scepter to me I
[1:56:32] could die
[1:56:33] Hallelujah say and I don't want to die I
[1:56:36] just got here to this job
[1:56:41] I I just got this job I don't want to
[1:56:44] lose this job I mean I I just walked out
[1:56:47] of my career and I don't want to lose my
[1:56:49] career oh Hallelujah the reason you got
[1:56:53] that job and the reason you got the
[1:56:56] position that you had is because you can
[1:56:58] stand in a certain place for such a time
[1:57:01] as this
[1:57:03] you can display Christ to the world for
[1:57:06] such a time as this you can light up
[1:57:09] this age for such a time as this

[1:57:16] needs

[1:58:34] God put you here for such a time as this
[1:58:39] you in that school for such a time as
[1:58:41] this you're in the HR department for
[1:58:43] such a time as this praise the Lord amen
[1:58:46] you're on that job for such a time as
[1:58:48] this you are living in the neighborhood
[1:58:50] you live in for such a time as this
[1:58:53] them neighbors that God put next door to
[1:58:55] you for such a time as this
[1:59:04] he told Esther that's just like now you
[1:59:06] know if I don't get the scepter you know
[1:59:07] I'll die and I just pretty much I just
[1:59:10] got this job at 30 days 30 days I've
[1:59:12] been hearing he ain't called for me and
[1:59:14] I don't want to lose I don't want to
[1:59:15] lose my job
[1:59:16] they look he has to don't think because
[1:59:19] you're in the palace
[1:59:23] don't don't think because you're in the
[1:59:24] palace that thing's gonna be different
[1:59:25] for you and here's the other thing that
[1:59:28] I think Esther came to realize
[1:59:30] that by being a Jew
[1:59:33] with haman's order
[1:59:35] she was gonna die
[1:59:39] just because she was Jew
[1:59:41] she would have died
[1:59:43] as a Jew
[1:59:45] so she said you know what if I die
[1:59:48] let me die but I'm gonna go in to see
[1:59:50] the king I'mma take my chance with the
[1:59:53] King
[1:59:55] she walked in there and and and after
[1:59:58] the fasting and the praying and
[1:59:59] everything and and here's the thing God
[2:00:01] had to put her in this place
[2:00:04] as a queen because she's the only one
[2:00:06] that can overturn what Haman is doing
[2:00:11] let me tell you something let me tell
[2:00:13] you something God always got his people
[2:00:15] a little higher
[2:00:17] then everything the devil trying to do
[2:00:19] can I can I ask you something are you
[2:00:21] living a little bit higher
[2:00:24] are you walking a little bit higher than
[2:00:27] what your trials are trying to bring you
[2:00:29] down to don't let your trials
[2:00:33] don't let your boss don't let your
[2:00:36] husband don't let your wife don't let
[2:00:40] your children keep bringing you down God
[2:00:42] God trying to elevate you

[2:01:08] that's practical ain't it

[2:02:54] Esther
[2:02:56] had to come to a reality that it wasn't
[2:02:59] just because of her beauty
[2:03:01] that she got promoted to this position
[2:03:04] actually Esther had a higher position
[2:03:06] just being Queen of the land
[2:03:10] Esther position now now here's a here's
[2:03:12] a thing that I want to I want to say
[2:03:14] about this book of Esther
[2:03:16] here just in a little note in the front
[2:03:18] of my Bible to say the name of God does
[2:03:19] not not once secure occur
[2:03:23] uh but in no other book of the Bible
[2:03:26] is its Providence more conspicuous so
[2:03:29] his the name God does not even show up
[2:03:32] in the Book of Esther
[2:03:34] but his actions show us God all through
[2:03:38] his actions remember I said you know
[2:03:41] um uh as a as a God you have to be
[2:03:44] willing to die David told us that
[2:03:47] do you realize Esther as a god
[2:03:51] oh y'all
[2:03:54] Esther as a god
[2:03:57] was willing to die
[2:04:00] amen if I perish
[2:04:03] let me perish
[2:04:06] amen I'm willing to put my life on the
[2:04:09] line so Esther Esther had a higher role
[2:04:11] than just being Queen
[2:04:14] Esther Rolle in God's mind
[2:04:17] savior
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:26] in your family
[2:04:29] savior
[2:04:31] Amen
[2:04:33] in your household
[2:04:36] savior yeah
[2:04:40] except the corner wheat go in the ground
[2:04:42] and die
[2:04:47] it'll live alone
[2:04:49] but when that corner wheat is ready to
[2:04:51] die be buried and now that's when the
[2:04:54] process of life begins to start now
[2:04:56] you'll see fruit come
[2:04:58] but you got to be willing to be like a
[2:05:00] god
[2:05:01] bye
[2:05:03] our Lord and savior went to a cross and
[2:05:07] died
[2:05:08] and through his death look at all the
[2:05:11] fruit
[2:05:12] and it's been fruit from years and years
[2:05:14] and years
[2:05:20] all right
[2:05:22] let me um
[2:05:25] it's you know it's it's so important
[2:05:27] that we recognize our position Who We
[2:05:28] Are
[2:05:29] in Christ it's so important uh let me
[2:05:32] just read a couple more quotes here for
[2:05:35] you
[2:05:35] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory
[2:05:39] here out of the message adoption or
[2:05:41] placing brother Brandon makes this
[2:05:43] statement
[2:05:45] tell me my brother
[2:05:48] tell me my sister
[2:05:51] when was the time that the sons of God
[2:05:55] was ever to be manifested
[2:05:58] outside of this time now
[2:06:02] oh my
[2:06:04] God it's at the top of the uh that the
[2:06:06] the top quote the second uh
[2:06:09] selection there so it's outside of time
[2:06:11] now says uh when were there ever time in
[2:06:16] the history
[2:06:18] this that manifests the time to deliver
[2:06:22] all nature right nature itself is
[2:06:27] groaning
[2:06:31] if you don't see that just with the
[2:06:33] storm that just came out of nowhere
[2:06:36] I mean out of nowhere
[2:06:39] typically you know we can see them
[2:06:40] coming off the coast of Africa and it'll
[2:06:43] just be weeks and weeks and weeks of
[2:06:45] turning
[2:06:46] the turning out there like okay y'all
[2:06:48] better get ready y'all better get ready
[2:06:49] this thing coming this thing just popped
[2:06:52] up in like a a day or two days a
[2:06:54] tropical storm go from tropical storm to
[2:06:56] Hurricane I mean it was it was only two
[2:07:01] uh two miles per hour less than being a
[2:07:04] category five and if a category four can
[2:07:07] do that type of Destruction
[2:07:11] and not just here I mean after it left
[2:07:13] Florida it kept moving
[2:07:16] and went on up in in South Carolina and
[2:07:18] trees uprooted in houses I mean one
[2:07:21] storm do all that
[2:07:23] they heard somebody saying that they
[2:07:26] need to think about rebuilding in these
[2:07:27] on these coastal towns maybe not setting
[2:07:30] up not not building again on the coastal
[2:07:31] towns because we're prone to have uh um
[2:07:34] storms like this let me tell you
[2:07:36] something I don't care whether you put
[2:07:37] the house right on the beach
[2:07:39] or you put it in the middle of the land
[2:07:41] God's judgment is striking the Earth
[2:07:45] but you know here's the thing here's the
[2:07:46] thing and and and and I'm I'm careful
[2:07:49] about this
[2:07:51] um we can't speak to Every Storm
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:59] some of y'all don't want no trials y'all
[2:08:01] speak to everything coming your way now
[2:08:03] you got to go through something that's
[2:08:05] how you develop character
[2:08:10] y'all ain't talking to me
[2:08:15] come on that's why you want to open up
[2:08:17] your mouth and speak I don't want to go
[2:08:19] through nothing
[2:08:20] no God know what he's doing yeah
[2:08:24] can I say it like this God gave you that
[2:08:26] boss
[2:08:27] for a reason
[2:08:33] amen
[2:08:35] Hallelujah if my boss would change no
[2:08:37] why don't you change
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:41] hello somebody
[2:08:43] hey glory to God
[2:08:45] I'm a witness at Unseen folk change
[2:08:47] State attitude towards their boss the
[2:08:50] next thing you know the bosses talking
[2:08:51] them up
[2:08:52] the Boston change about them but you had
[2:08:55] to be the one to change first change
[2:08:57] from the inside and when you change from
[2:08:59] the inside it impacts the outside
[2:09:01] accept the corner weak go on the ground
[2:09:03] in
[2:09:06] about us alone but when it when it's
[2:09:09] willing to die
[2:09:11] then it can bring forth much fruit
[2:09:17] nature itself is growing and waiting for
[2:09:19] the time of the manifestation why before
[2:09:21] the atonement was made before the Holy
[2:09:22] Ghost was ever poured out before the Old
[2:09:24] Testament on down there there couldn't
[2:09:26] have been manifestation
[2:09:28] it had to wait till this time now all
[2:09:31] things has been brought coming shaping
[2:09:33] up to headstone to the manifestation of
[2:09:34] the sons of God coming back and the
[2:09:36] spirit of God coming into these men so
[2:09:38] perfectly
[2:09:40] oh the spirit of God coming in I'm
[2:09:43] talking about men and women the spirit
[2:09:44] of God coming in so perfectly and to
[2:09:46] their Ministry would be so close like
[2:09:49] Christ till to join him and his church
[2:09:52] together
[2:09:54] I was listening to brother Jason
[2:09:55] recently he was preaching
[2:09:58] and he was talking about um
[2:10:01] um
[2:10:02] brother Branham you know and I think uh
[2:10:05] here take me to uh proving his word
[2:10:08] that's where I'm going to go next uh it
[2:10:10] was saying how
[2:10:12] and brother Ram's Ministry was just very
[2:10:13] very unique and so much the Holy Spirit
[2:10:16] just used me in so many ways so many
[2:10:18] Supernatural things happened and uh one
[2:10:21] of them uh oftentimes some of the
[2:10:24] old-timers uh that was with him and and
[2:10:27] saw the hand of God they they began to
[2:10:30] just kind of come I want to say they had
[2:10:32] strange doctors I'll say that it was
[2:10:34] strange doctrines but I learned to have
[2:10:36] a little Grace with the people because
[2:10:37] of what they went through
[2:10:39] and um in one of the strange man they
[2:10:41] was they were saying brother Brandon was
[2:10:43] Jesus they were saying that but but you
[2:10:45] know and I don't agree with that I don't
[2:10:47] agree with that at all now to a certain
[2:10:48] part if I can say it like this just as
[2:10:51] Jesus is Manifest himself in you makes
[2:10:54] you Jesus
[2:10:56] I can see him in the same light
[2:10:59] man right I hope y'all I hope y'all can
[2:11:01] kind of Follow The Line there okay uh
[2:11:05] but but sometimes it's it's worship and
[2:11:07] adoration and all that and that's not it
[2:11:08] now when I quote the prophet it's a
[2:11:11] reason why I quote the prophet I could
[2:11:14] come up here and quote Billy Graham
[2:11:16] I could come up here and quote Oral
[2:11:18] Roberts and people would have no problem
[2:11:20] or Robert said
[2:11:22] but when I say William Branham why do
[2:11:24] you have a problem with that I'm just
[2:11:25] telling you where I got this from
[2:11:28] I ain't make this up on my own and it's
[2:11:30] a Vindicated word that came to us right
[2:11:32] but but brother brother Jason Walker was
[2:11:35] saying say you know um brother brother
[2:11:37] Perry green May testified one time he
[2:11:39] says you know I know these brothers go
[2:11:41] around they make brother Brandon more
[2:11:42] than what he needs to be and all that
[2:11:43] and I understand he says I don't you
[2:11:45] know uh he says but but just just y'all
[2:11:48] try to put yourself in their shoes well
[2:11:49] what if it was you
[2:11:51] what if it was you in Florida
[2:11:54] fishing
[2:11:55] with the prophet
[2:11:57] and y'all caught up you got a big bass
[2:11:59] on the line and it's bad about about to
[2:12:02] pull you in and in the basket hung up in
[2:12:05] the weeds down there so you decide you
[2:12:07] know what I'm gonna help we ain't gonna
[2:12:08] lose this one I'm gonna help you I'm
[2:12:09] gonna jump out there and I'm gonna get
[2:12:10] this bass and brother jump out down the
[2:12:12] excitement grab that bass and when he
[2:12:14] grabbed the bass
[2:12:17] a rattler
[2:12:19] got him in the middle of nowhere no
[2:12:24] hospital around and typically when you
[2:12:25] get bit by a rattlesnake it's immediate
[2:12:28] death
[2:12:30] brother random looked at the brother and
[2:12:32] said ain't no way I can carry that big
[2:12:34] old man out of here and by the time I
[2:12:35] get him out of here uh the poison be all
[2:12:38] through his body he'll be he'll be a
[2:12:39] dead man I can't do nothing the best I
[2:12:42] can do at this time is just pray for
[2:12:45] this brother
[2:12:46] laid hands on the brother prayed for him
[2:12:49] brother Evans prayed for him and uh
[2:12:51] after after he prayed for the brother
[2:12:53] said he didn't feel no pain
[2:12:55] and says he kept fishing the rest of the
[2:12:57] day no no no no no no no poison coming
[2:13:00] up his bloodstream
[2:13:02] and just just went the rest of the day
[2:13:03] and and that night he saw his brother
[2:13:05] and told his brother what happened say I
[2:13:07] got bit by a rattler today and the
[2:13:09] brother had just been bitten by a snake
[2:13:10] like a few weeks before and he knew
[2:13:12] everything he went through in the
[2:13:13] hospital all kinds of stuff he said he
[2:13:15] says he said I got bit by a rattler
[2:13:16] today and I'm feeling fine he said you

[2:13:45] he said let that happen to you
[2:13:48] and let a man pray for you

[2:14:58] in West Palm there was a church on
[2:15:00] Haverhill said now we used to meet on
[2:15:01] Abbey Hill
[2:15:04] see I walked into a church one day on
[2:15:06] Haverhill over there by the Dollar
[2:15:07] General
[2:15:09] and said I came in that church and I
[2:15:11] asked the pastor to come to the hospital
[2:15:13] room and pray for my twin
[2:15:16] and he came and prayed for my twin
[2:15:19] and I never got around to tell them but
[2:15:22] after he prayed and that he said my she
[2:15:24] said my twin they gave her a five
[2:15:26] percent chance of living
[2:15:29] but that Pastor came and prayed and the
[2:15:31] very next day she was back up on her
[2:15:34] feet
[2:15:38] they say you the pastor I said yeah I
[2:15:40] remember coming to pray for your sister
[2:15:43] [Applause]
[2:15:46] our God is real
[2:15:49] I said y'all need to come and share the
[2:15:51] testimony to the church she said but my
[2:15:53] sister been doing fine ever since you
[2:15:55] came five percent chance of living
[2:15:58] oh my God now you let me tell you
[2:16:00] something yeah yeah if God can do that
[2:16:02] for a person that's not really a
[2:16:04] Believer and I don't want to I don't
[2:16:06] want to say they they have not come to
[2:16:08] recognize the gene that is in their life
[2:16:11] is that better
[2:16:14] those that have recognized the gene that
[2:16:16] is in their life we expect God to do
[2:16:18] great things for you
[2:16:22] it's his will that we prosper
[2:16:25] and be in good health
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:34] let me try to finish this
[2:16:37] here out of proven his word
[2:16:40] now he had to believe his old crop had
[2:16:42] died off the unbelievers who said we
[2:16:44] couldn't take it you let everyone in
[2:16:46] them perish why every one of them but
[2:16:48] the Believers who was left Moses had
[2:16:51] been taking the glory
[2:16:53] and the unbelievers had
[2:16:55] um perished in the wilderness
[2:16:57] and this was their children they were
[2:16:59] the only two that crossed over that that
[2:17:01] was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they
[2:17:03] was a believers they was the one who was
[2:17:06] crossed over it's only it's the only way
[2:17:08] God can do it is by his believing
[2:17:10] children you believe that all right his
[2:17:12] Believers was the ones that done it he
[2:17:15] used them to cross over with C now I
[2:17:17] want you to notice he does it that way
[2:17:20] in every age he does it every time by
[2:17:22] the same method he has to take believers
[2:17:26] praise God
[2:17:28] amen he has to take believers
[2:17:31] glory amen and then in order to have
[2:17:36] Believers to meet that word
[2:17:39] he's got to Pro destinate it to that age
[2:17:41] so what am I trying to say God
[2:17:43] predestinated me
[2:17:45] God pro destinated you to be a believer
[2:17:49] and that's why you can't go nowhere else
[2:17:52] because you were predestinated to be a
[2:17:54] believer
[2:17:56] my I thank God for that
[2:17:59] uh you see it he's got to predestinate
[2:18:02] this thing to be there
[2:18:06] can I go a little further he had to put
[2:18:08] you on the job that he gave you he had
[2:18:10] to prodestinate you to be there
[2:18:12] with the disposition that you have
[2:18:16] in order to light up the age
[2:18:26] uh look at what he said he says he got
[2:18:29] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[2:18:30] be there to meet the challenge of the
[2:18:32] age did it get you that statement he's
[2:18:34] asking did it get you
[2:18:36] did you feel it
[2:18:38] did you see it did you understand it
[2:18:41] that's what's happening today he
[2:18:43] predestinated to this by his
[2:18:45] foreknowledge when he predestinated in
[2:18:47] Malachi 4 is got to happen
[2:18:50] when he come over and predestinates
[2:18:52] anything to happen in his word he had to
[2:18:55] prove his word to be so that's why I
[2:18:56] asked people all the time anytime you're
[2:18:58] having a problem anybody that's brother
[2:19:00] Brandon's not the prophet brother
[2:19:01] Brandon okay okay okay okay okay I'm not
[2:19:03] gonna argue with that I'm not brother
[2:19:05] Brandon is a prophet and I ain't arguing
[2:19:07] about that that's that's ridiculous
[2:19:09] that's a crazy argument you say he not
[2:19:12] the prophet okay open up your Bible
[2:19:14] listen
[2:19:17] for me
[2:19:20] behold I send you
[2:19:22] Elijah the prophet before the great and
[2:19:25] terrible day of the Lord now this is
[2:19:28] what God promises were brother Branham

[2:19:47] I'm gonna keep this
[2:19:50] imma hold on to this
[2:19:53] until that comes
[2:19:57] I'm just talking about what the Bible
[2:19:59] say I see him as a manifestation of the
[2:20:01] word of God just like I see John the
[2:20:03] Baptist as a manifestation of the word
[2:20:05] of God you know what I see else what
[2:20:07] else I see I see you
[2:20:09] as a manifestation of the word of God
[2:20:12] the Earth is grown and waiting for the
[2:20:14] manifestations of the sons and daughters
[2:20:19] of God I'm here to tell the Earth you
[2:20:23] ain't got to wait much longer they here
[2:20:25] they recognizing who they are and when
[2:20:28] they recognize who they are you know
[2:20:29] what's going to happen
[2:20:31] Rapture amen let me finish here did you
[2:20:34] get it did you feel it did you see it
[2:20:37] did you understand it that's what's
[2:20:38] happening today he predestinedated to
[2:20:40] this by his foreign
[2:20:42] got to happen when they come over and
[2:20:44] predestinates anything to happen in his
[2:20:46] word he had to prove his word to be so
[2:20:48] when he predestinates anything that
[2:20:49] happened and says it will happen he
[2:20:51] knows that seed will be there it might
[2:20:54] be covered underneath Darkness but that
[2:20:56] seed is there he knows that seed would
[2:20:58] be there just at that time he
[2:21:00] predestinated a bribe she's going to be
[2:21:04] there going to be a Rapture she's going
[2:21:08] to be there he predestinated by his
[2:21:10] foreknowledge see there's nothing going
[2:21:12] to stop it
[2:21:14] I am so
[2:21:17] happy about that let me give you one
[2:21:20] last statement out of Oneness
[2:21:23] just to encourage you oh
[2:21:26] ye are gods
[2:21:28] ye are Gods amen that means you're going
[2:21:33] to rise up you're going to take control
[2:21:34] and you're going to stop letting the
[2:21:36] devil just
[2:21:37] do whatever you want to do in your life
[2:21:39] and one of the brothers said last week
[2:21:41] you know um it's a brother Brandon made
[2:21:44] the statement it says when we fighting
[2:21:46] one another
[2:21:48] when we're fighting one another
[2:21:50] the devil not fighting us
[2:21:54] double not fighting us you know what the
[2:21:56] devil's doing
[2:21:57] man with a hand in the father look at
[2:22:00] this
[2:22:02] callers demons will watch this one look
[2:22:04] at this look at what he said to her look
[2:22:07] at what she said look at this the devil
[2:22:10] not even fighting you fighting each
[2:22:12] other
[2:22:14] amen
[2:22:17] free make the devil do some work
[2:22:20] don't do all the work for the devil make
[2:22:22] him do some work
[2:22:24] here we go watch this this is this is
[2:22:27] for this this gives the little little
[2:22:29] spiritual vitamin
[2:22:31] we know we make mistakes
[2:22:37] but you mustn't look at that
[2:22:41] it's not your mistakes
[2:22:44] because you're always going to have them
[2:22:47] but you see it's following his rules
[2:22:50] following what he said do stumbling and
[2:22:53] falling doesn't have one thing to do
[2:22:55] with it
[2:22:57] a real true servant
[2:22:59] it feels stumble
[2:23:02] he'll get up again
[2:23:04] if he wobbles God pulls him right back
[2:23:07] in the path as long as he's in the path
[2:23:09] of Duty
[2:23:11] but if he's off of the path of Duty
[2:23:14] God's not obligated to him
[2:23:17] but as long as he's in the path of Duty
[2:23:20] God's obligated to him knowing that he's
[2:23:24] just a man or a woman he's obligated to
[2:23:29] that person as long as they're in the
[2:23:32] path of Duty
[2:23:35] so don't You Wobble in your mistakes and
[2:23:38] don't you sit there and just be pulled
[2:23:40] me pull me but no no get up
[2:23:42] you are a god
[2:23:45] and you don't handle yourself like that
[2:23:51] you were born for such a time as this
[2:23:54] let's pray
[2:23:59] father we thank you
[2:24:01] for your word Jesus
[2:24:05] thank you for uh
[2:24:07] God your truth that just
[2:24:10] speak to us and calls us out of where we
[2:24:13] are to where we're supposed to be
[2:24:17] sometimes we go through life like Esther
[2:24:20] not realizing the full purpose and the
[2:24:22] full plan that you have for us
[2:24:25] Lord but as you started Discerning the
[2:24:27] purpose here is that we would know our
[2:24:29] position we would recognize our position
[2:24:33] and father I just pray that uh through
[2:24:36] the Revelation word that we would come
[2:24:38] to that knowledge
[2:24:40] change has to happen from the inside
[2:24:43] to affect the outside so a lot let us
[2:24:45] allow the word
[2:24:47] the changes
[2:24:49] we want you to be glorified we want you
[2:24:51] to be magnified in and through us
[2:24:52] something says in my life Lord be
[2:24:55] glorified
[2:24:57] and my home Lord be glorified
[2:25:01] and My Heart Lord be glorified
[2:25:05] that's my desire of Jesus
[2:25:07] it's the Lord we prayed that you would
[2:25:10] just
[2:25:11] let your word take root
[2:25:14] let us take this corner wheat go in the
[2:25:16] ground and let us die
[2:25:19] that we might bring forth fruit
[2:25:22] things that would make you happy we
[2:25:25] don't want to be like that fig tree Lord
[2:25:27] that you saw on Earth that was not
[2:25:29] producing fruit so you cursed it God we
[2:25:32] want to be fruitful in our lives
[2:25:35] I pray your blessings Lord upon
[2:25:38] your people

[2:27:26] missions right now since we started
[2:27:29] doing this missionary work in November
[2:27:32] last year we're going in the streets and
[2:27:34] we are giving food to the people to the
[2:27:36] poor people to the needy people you know
[2:27:37] we have a lot of Venezuelan people that
[2:27:40] has come to our country trying to find a
[2:27:42] path to go down South America trying to
[2:27:45] find jobs trying to find a new way of
[2:27:47] living we also have a lot of poverty in
[2:27:50] our country we have elderly people that
[2:27:53] are working in the streets recycling
[2:27:54] trash and that's the kind of people that
[2:27:57] we are working with okay
[2:28:00] so so far for you to understand this
[2:28:03] work
[2:28:04] until today since we started in November
[2:28:07] the 13th last year until today we have
[2:28:10] given away 13
[2:28:12] 000 meals to people 13 000 meals to
[2:28:15] people yes
[2:28:17] [Applause]
[2:28:20] time for for Ministry like ours you know
[2:28:23] that's a huge amount of food that we
[2:28:25] have given but the the thing that we
[2:28:27] have to praise God you know is that when
[2:28:30] we want to bless the people with the
[2:28:31] food we ask them do you want to be more
[2:28:33] blessed the people mostly they say yes
[2:28:35] of course so we ask them right do you
[2:28:38] want us to pray for you and the people
[2:28:41] say okay pray for me you know and mostly
[2:28:44] say I pray for my family pray because I
[2:28:47] need a job you know so we have been
[2:28:49] seeing good results okay and out of
[2:28:52] those people some and start asking
[2:28:55] questions are you guys Christians
[2:28:56] because you know that in Colombia mostly
[2:28:58] we are Catholic right so mostly come
[2:29:01] your Christians yes where do you gather
[2:29:04] so so we have a place by the grace of
[2:29:06] God that we gather people in the center
[2:29:08] in the downtown of the city where I live
[2:29:11] which is called fusagatsuga and so far
[2:29:13] we are mostly 45 people in that place by
[2:29:17] the grace of God that's something
[2:29:18] wonderful most of the people that are
[2:29:21] coming come from that work that we are
[2:29:24] doing that's this that's very very
[2:29:25] awesome you know and we started not so
[2:29:29] far you know like three or four months
[2:29:30] ago we started another place another
[2:29:33] spot to have another mission where we
[2:29:35] one day we were 62 people there
[2:29:38] listening to the word of God by the
[2:29:40] grace of God okay well you know that
[2:29:43] people comes up and come down you know
[2:29:45] and they start making questions so but
[2:29:47] you know the last thing which is
[2:29:49] something amazing and wonderful we found
[2:29:52] this little spot in a river that is
[2:29:55] called Jordan River nearby where we live
[2:29:58] you know those waters are cleared you
[2:30:01] know I'm pure it's just a beautiful
[2:30:03] place and so far since we started we
[2:30:06] have 19 people baptized in the name of
[2:30:10] the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:30:12] foreign
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:17] is happening in Colombia
[2:30:20] please keep us in your prayers okay and
[2:30:23] out of those people you know that we're
[2:30:25] unmarried you know living together you
[2:30:28] know for 12 years you know another for
[2:30:31] six years you know another for 40 years
[2:30:33] you know they have been asking to get
[2:30:36] married so so far we have married two
[2:30:38] couples there is one more coming
[2:30:42] I come back to Colombia in two days and
[2:30:45] I am going to marry another couple in
[2:30:47] the city of Cali you know so the Lord is
[2:30:49] doing something the Lord is doing
[2:30:51] something with humbliness of Hearts you
[2:30:54] know I don't brag about what we are
[2:30:56] doing I don't think that it's because of
[2:30:59] me it's his it is all his work is his
[2:31:03] and all the glory is he is the one that
[2:31:06] deserves it okay and we are just
[2:31:08] preaching the same gospel that brother
[2:31:11] Branham preached we're not preaching
[2:31:13] something different amen because Jesus
[2:31:16] Christ is the same yesterday and he's
[2:31:18] the same today and he's the same forever
[2:31:20] amen because like brother I just love
[2:31:24] what is happening
[2:31:26] I just love what is happening
[2:31:28] you know when I was coming in I was
[2:31:32] Broadcasting
[2:31:33] and and I did the same thing that
[2:31:36] brother Jack said when he was up here
[2:31:38] when we met out there you know let's
[2:31:41] take a picture with that number three
[2:31:44] seven seven
[2:31:46] it has a meaning
[2:31:48] because we know that William Marion
[2:31:50] Branham had seven numbers in his name
[2:31:52] right but we know that if Jesus Christ
[2:31:55] is the same yesterday to him forever you
[2:31:57] know he's bringing a price that is going
[2:32:00] to be the manifestation of the children
[2:32:02] of God I truly believe it and if I am
[2:32:05] here witnessing and giving this
[2:32:07] testimony to all of you is because I
[2:32:09] really believe that something good is
[2:32:11] happening in this world in these last
[2:32:13] days we love you we remind you you know
[2:32:17] and I give thanks to God because I met
[2:32:20] Brooke who in Texas and he was the point
[2:32:23] of connection with all of you and and
[2:32:25] you are my family so consider me your
[2:32:29] family as well with all the love in
[2:32:31] Colombia we wait for you if you want to
[2:32:34] come and visit us and just help us out
[2:32:36] you know in this missionary work that we
[2:32:38] are doing there God bless you all thank
[2:32:40] you

[2:37:28] um last time that I administered we were
[2:37:31] talking about Ruth and I made a
[2:37:33] statement we were talking about
[2:37:35] um the the king I'm sorry Esther young
[2:37:38] we're talking about the the king that
[2:37:40] was upset uh with receiving a portion of
[2:37:44] the land of Galilee and I said that uh
[2:37:47] he shouldn't have been upset with that
[2:37:48] because he didn't realize what was going
[2:37:50] to be coming from that I said can any
[2:37:52] good thing come out of Galilee and
[2:37:56] actually that's not the correct way to
[2:37:58] say that should have been any good thing
[2:38:00] come out of Nazareth
[2:38:03] that was the right way to say that so I
[2:38:05] did I did I want to apologize I had that
[2:38:07] wrong uh but then I did do some research
[2:38:11] and I found out that Nazareth was
[2:38:13] actually inside of
[2:38:16] Galilee so but I did want to make it
[2:38:19] right with you all amen God bless you
[2:38:21] [Music]
[2:38:24] Hallelujah and we understood what he
[2:38:27] said
