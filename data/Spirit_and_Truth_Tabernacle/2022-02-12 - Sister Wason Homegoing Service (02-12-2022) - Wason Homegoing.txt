each amen but let's let's welcome brothers sister keepers amen as they come church member in three [Music] so [Music] god bless you saints and the family well we are brother and sister john capers and um sister wayson oh god i remember meeting uh sister wilson i think it was 1982-83 and she was living down in cory springs and uh she started fellowshipping with uh brother wesko and we were there at the time and i remember the first time she came we wondered how did she get there and she called a taxicab she thought that she called the taxi cab to every service and all and uh all i could say was that sister wiz was a beautiful beautiful christian lady you know and um when we moved from here in 1986 we moved to okeechobee and um eventually sister wayson came out and uh she was working for the family of the pulitzer family to it you know but i can say that sister winston really was a true true christian woman children and one thing i knew about her she was very clean she was extremely clean you know but otherwise we had some wonderful gears together when she was there i didn't know the children at that time and all that you know i really loved her and i miss her so much i didn't have a chance to spend with her as much as i want to over here but otherwise than that i just thank god for her life she lived a true christian life and uh we just really appreciated her but i know she's over there on the heels of glory shouting right now having a wonderful time you know but we're going to miss her but we're gonna see her again god bless you all god bless [Music] god bless everyone this morning what can we say about situation isn't much you can say about it she was a great christian lady i won't say a woman she's a good christian lady uh when she first came out uh she stayed about i guess about maybe three or four months before the home and thing that she was living and finished my house was built first and that's there for about a year and she then that came out and i tried to make her a cowgirl but that didn't work then i tried to get her to be a tractor driver that wouldn't work she she didn't have nothing to do with try driving sister waste and i said you out here i said now you you got plenty of room you can learn to drive it no she she wasn't driving tired so i said okay but i remember vividly was talking one time and she said uh okay i said yeah she said can a jeep go in the water i said yeah sure she said no my brother told me that he saw a jeep going through the water and things and he told me he said you know jeep go through the water so so i got a chance to take out to the hunting camp and we got out to the hunting camp i didn't say nothing to her at first just got down so when we got done camp uh we rode around and uh because the the the camp the only cameras in this humongous is 10 miles square 10 miles and so i told the sister way said we're going to go over certain places but we got to go through a little water you know and she kind of tightened up you know and i said but don't worry i see you're making so we're in the jeep and i took us which got to the flat to go through and uh it was about i guess maybe about a couple of about 200 feet that we had to go through water and the water's about uh almost like two foot high and so i told they said are we going to go through we're going to ease through here you know i said but you probably have to hold your feet up because you won't get wet you know so we got her through them we got come back through that and that was the greatest thing that ever happened to her she said oh my she said when i get home i'm going to write my brother and tell him i said yeah that's possible because i i've done it i've been in the shelter and that's that was the highlight of her whole career out there but anyway sister waiting was a beautiful person and i'll say this and i'm gonna get out of your way uh i i know i know that the the devil glad to see her go the devil was glad to see sister west go because she was a thorn in his side everything he tried to give her she she rejected anything that didn't look like the words she didn't have nothing to do with it you know so she she oh my god she had a fight all right she had a fight she had a fiber sheet she stood the grounds with the devil you know so i'm i'm happy to to have known her and to be with her for the years that we had together and everything you know i'll just say this uh she's in a greater place a place that there's never a sad goodbye and has never uh it's great you know so but uh one thing she didn't let the devil do he couldn't he couldn't convince her to live like the world he couldn't convince her to talk like the world talk he couldn't vince to live like the world he couldn't convince her to dress like the world right so when she left the deputy paul i'm so glad she gone so let us be praying for one another to pray but i'm gonna leave you with this though every every one of us in here has a chance to see her again but now let us not miss that chase amen praise god [Applause] [Music] appreciate uh brother and sister capers at this time we'll also have as a sister in christ also friend sister teresa brown she's going to come and have words wow i considered barrel eureka wayson it was an honor to be called her friend beryl was very firm in what she believed and she definitely was a master of clearliness um through the years i've been knowing beryl about maybe about 35 years and basically i mean we have spent a lot of time together whether it be say on the road going back and forth to church um back and forth to work to the mall um even say traveling together we traveled a lot and barrel was she taught me quite a bit um my children was very fond of her she was like a grandmother slash godmother to them um bell really liked fine things and i could appreciate that beryl i tell you i've tasted some of the finest of cheeses from merrell and she where others would maybe go to the deli she go to the gourmet cheese section and cheese and crackers pickles just different things of that sort daryl i tell you a real soldier of the cross um i really enjoyed her sense of humor she had a great sense of humor and i loved to hear a laugh uh but most of all beryl beryl really was a prayer warrior i'ma tell you you to get i really enjoyed hearing her pray it was so consistent it felt she was a consistent person anyway and uh she was a dedicated person to whatever she believed her prayers just flowed but most of all beryl loved the family of god um she asked a lot of questions we would tease her i mean why is this what is that where where are you going how did you get there how did they do this but it wasn't to be nosy it was so that she can basically get an understanding of how to pray and um it just this is really tough because oh she's just really someone special in my life really special and it's such an honor to me to be able to speak as a friend and a sister [Music] as a church member someone that have been with her through a lot i mean all of my ups and downs over and unders whatever barrel has been right there for me and with me uh she was an encourager to everybody i mean if she talked to you she encouraged you when you left her presence you felt like you can you know do what maybe you thought you couldn't do but she really wasn't encouraging and i like to say this uh truly your life was a blessing your memory or treasure you are love beyond words and you are sure enough miss beyond measure i love you so much feral i have a um tribute that i was asked to read from her auntie ruth she's in trinidad she's her mother's sister and she sent this and it was too late to get into the book but i told her i would read it i remember in 2001 when i spent six months in florida at barrels she was very accommodating generous and kind she took me around showed me places shops stores and most definitely church she without fail would take me to church every sunday morning and thursday evening she was not much for talking at home but was a peaceful pleasure to be around she would listen to brother branham tapes and enjoy every minute of them and the revelations barrel was a stickler for the truth even if it was from her own point of view and in all the name of god she was a true christian and although she might may not have say been ready for this a very painful event for us she was well prepared for she lived a good christian life she would make me chuckle whenever we chatted on the phone she always said auntie ruth it's good to hear your voice now that she is gone i can truly say beryl i would surely miss your voice i treasure the memories my dear barrel rest in peace and god's power your loving auntie ruth i love you bill [Applause] praise the lord um we have also as a cousin uh brother errol jones amen [Applause] most of the two speakers except for everything i had to say what i've just mentioned is even though i never met beverly chernob because i'm from i was born in population college that even though it is so near he's still very far but when he went to trinidad finally her dad told me he said fred you have a house in palm beach so when i get back to penny get back to us i called her and there was this fragrant jolly lady on the phone i couldn't i could never that voice before would always stay with me yeah beryl uh taro was my was my uncle and my mother was bro there's one thing i noticed about barrel from the start she was she had a devoted love for god and she always spoke fondly of her church sisters and and that is something that i was very impressed with and i always make an effort when i come into the foundation to come and visit her and spend some quality time with her and we all enjoy them hi apparel this cousin i hope you're in peace [Applause] praise the lord um we wanted to circle back to a portion of the program have justin smiley come and he'll read it's a reading of a tribute from uh sister wayson's brother rupert wayson and this is a reading of a tribute and following brother justin smiley will have a solo from sister ashley williams good afternoon if i could just share really briefly as i pulled this up a couple years ago at an event much like this i saw sister wayson and i hadn't seen her in a little while and uh the first thing she did she looked me you know when she when she hadn't seen you know why she kind of gave that little look she kind of squinched up her eyes a little bit she looked at me she didn't say hello she didn't say good to see you first thing out of her mouth was brother you need to buy a bigger suit i just said how you doing sister weisse [Laughter] i found out that she could be very very sharp but she was she was very funny uh so we we appreciate sister wayson i did end up getting a bigger suit this letter reads as follows it's titled our tribute to beryl it says beryl wayson was born the fourth of 13 children to cecil and euleen wayson may 20th 1948 in trinidad west indies being one of the older girls she was tasked with assisting her younger siblings i rupert the 12th child was truly impacted by the actions of my older sister beryl's sense of order and hard work was seen early on with the effort she showed in getting us younger ones ready for church or school she insisted on cleanliness and neatness i believe her love of children and their development sprang from the soil of a large family hair must be properly combed teeth brushed closed neatly ironed she did the ironing shoes cleaned barrel worked hard at helping our parents take care of their large family in my early pre-teen years beryl migrated to the u.s during the late 70s she worked as a nanny for several families before ending her work career at a local nursing home working for her was not just a job but a calling a call to serve to give to heal it is this servant's heart that made beryl so special whatever the occasion or crowd beryl was most comfortable helping and ministering to those around her in the homes of the families she worked for beryl brought light and life to the surroundings she would single-handedly bring freshness into an area that once looked jaded and drab not by the purchase of something or remodeling but by her sheer presence and hard work her surroundings too on her personality of order and calm her ability to raise and nurture children was an extension of her large family upbringing tough love and gentle touch was her mo she did the work singing and playing and loving those entrusted to her care her example of joy and consistency made the little ones feel safe and loved bringing out the best in them being well behaved and clean as a child was the way to beryl's heart presents were a big deal with her the giving of gifts for no reason made us feel valued and loved one such time occurred when i was a teenager beryl visited trinidad and she brought me a pocket watch i was totally bowled over by the beauty and uniqueness of the gift no one my age owned or must have even seen such a thing her sense of style and fashion was traditional with a heavy emphasis on modesty this just added to her persona of order and calm beryl enjoyed things of quality and beauty be it clothing or decor simple but unique timelessness took precedence over the latest fad her things bore the stamp of order and taste with an enduring quality that made it appear more sophisticated than extravagant beryl's strength and fortitude was born from the source within barrel was a believer and follower of the god of the bible the maker of the heaven and the earth she surrendered her life to her savior at a young age and continued growing in his grace she was fearless and devoted in her faith undeterred by the sway of the times her heart for the lover of her soul increased as she aged the barrel of my teens has been eclipsed by the barrel of today the servant's heart she possessed through a mustard seed as though a mustard seed as a youth has grown into a mighty tree for others to find shade under its branches the idea of serving others and being a servant is not often spoken of today being known recognized and celebrated is the heights to which most aspire to be unseen by some is like a death sentence beryl took a different path the path of a servant on february 2nd 2022 beryl sat at her at her table having breakfast when the cry of every servant's heart was realized she heard her master's voice saying well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou unto the joy of the lord love always rupert wayson brother [Applause] okay um man a lot can be said about system lacy two hours twice a week that's a that's a lot of time um i started to reflect this morning and just thinking when you when you grow up you don't you think the people in your life are going to be there forever and i sure didn't think uh we'll be standing here today i was telling my mom being an ignorant little girl i thought wasting was her first name for the longest time and i'm like what kind of name is wayson but okay you know this is the ways and then she finally said her name was beryl and that made it worse i was like barrel and i said b-a-r-r-e-l and she said no so i remember going home and actually looking up what barrel means and i realized it was a precious stone so i was like okay she can talk me a little something and then i looked up this morning and it's amazing how much a name can be attributed to a person when i looked it up it says beryl has been said to have the power to keep demons away to promote happiness and marital love increase sincerity cure laziness because she couldn't stand that protect travelers it's no wonder how we got home safe every time from danger and maintain youthfulness she loved children man did she love the jenkins children two out i used to get jealous like if you don't stop talking about them but those were her kids uh she was never a mother and and i always mother's day come around and we always get her something she said well i'm not a mother i said well your mother to many you mother minnie and i'm definitely going to miss her mothering she loved him so i pray that i'm able to do her justice this afternoon tis so sweet to trust in jesus [Music] just to take him at his word just to rest upon his promise and to know the says the lord jesus oh jesus how i trust him how i approved him she proved him more and more [Music] oh jesus pray shall jesus [Music] oh for grace to trust him more great is thy faithfulness oh god my father there is no turning no turning from thee thou changes night like compassions they do not fail [Music] great is thy faithfulness [Music] lord to thee is thy faithfulness [Music] greatness thy faithfulness [Music] morning by [Music] oh she ever needs great is god's faithfulness great is my god's faithfulness [Applause] [Music] grace god's faithfulness lord lord unto thee [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord appreciate the words and the song from sister ashley amen truly god was faithful to sister wayson very very faithful amen we want to ask uh brother glenn roy wasting he's going to come at this time and speak as an aunt and man god bless you [Music] i just want to first and thank everybody for coming here means a lot to me and my cousins and my family thank you for her church family thank you for her friends and family this hit hard it really was tough for the family uh most of us most of the families in trinidad so they weren't able to be here in person but they were able to be here in spirit and also through video for my cousins they remember auntie barrel as a strict art we kind of got a little bit of that sense here today but you know when you're a kid you feel everybody is strict and auntie barrel she really wanted the best for us you see time and time when you know your aunts or your uncles would just let you stare down the wrong path but that wasn't really her vision her vision was although you view me as strict when you're a child you would greatly appreciate that when you become an adult and that's so true for most of my cousins where looking back they're like yes she was strict but the success and the impact that she's played in so much of our lives it speaks uh volumes she would always be a gibbon on as well besides the life lesson she would always give us pocket change or sweeties as my cousins in trinidad would call it i was born in brooklyn new york most of my cousins are in trinidad so i would call it candy they would call it sweeties but that was always auntie barrel she will always be giving for me personally it's tough um i never envisioned myself being here under these circumstances um when i got the call from my uncle on wednesday last wednesday and he told me that she went to the hospital i'm like okay i mean auntie barrel is tough so she's definitely gonna pull through it and you know we talked about in december that i was going to come down i like currently live in new jersey and i talked to her last december and said you know what once covered and everything kind of subside i'm going to be on the first plane to come and spend time with you and whatever you want to do i was willing to do anything if she wanted to skydive that's not anti-barrel but i was definitely willing to do anything that she wanted because you know after my father passed away and when my father passed away before he passed away they had like a grand trip that she went with my father and my father was so impressed with the trip and he was so happy and i was so happy that before he passed away he was able to experience it with auntie beryl and after he passed away we became more close where you know the calls of probably talking once every three months we talked every month and the way how she would just say honey it just it's different and for me this is really tough um i had you know as a young man and still growing i thought i had so much time to just show gratitude to my aunt i really wanted to do so much for her because she's done so much in the lives of so many other so many she's done so much for so many people and i just wanted to do whatever i can it's just a way of showing her gratitude she never cared about the spotlight on her she was always asking people how they were doing and people would ask her back but she never truly wanted to focus on herself and as i become a man i i just after my father passed away i just wanted to show him gratitude and when he passed away i was going to shift that focused anti-barrel because she lives in the u.s so it become more easier versus my aunts and one uncle lives in the u.s and she just meant so much to me personally where i just wish i had more time but as we all realize she was a fair a god fair woman and although she will definitely be missed here on earth we know that she's currently rejoicing in heaven it's very hard to say that because i really wish she was here a person but i have to live with that reality that you know this is god's will be done thank you [Music] [Applause] praise the lord we certainly appreciate that from her nephew um says as a nanny brother james jenkins he's gonna come at this time praise the lord [Applause] good afternoon and it is a privilege to be here and talk a little bit about a lady that i have the utmost respect for and love brother keepers uh i'm glad you failed too because i got her behind in behind the steering wheel twice and we never got it in the drive but we tried um good afternoon a little history literally 30 years ago beryl came into our lives i had a four-year-old daughter amanda a two-year-old son colt and edward was literally born about a month before and my wife was a practicing cpa i traveled a lot for work and wanda made the decision that she wanted it both ways she wanted to be a mom and she also wanted to work and the the solution was barrel manny and i don't panically don't know how we found beryl clearly i know now that god had a hand in that but it's barrel showed up and wanda and beryl bonded very quickly both the significant women of faith what's interesting is that barrel had worked with several other families and i now know grew up in a big family and neither wanda or i did that we had very small families and even though beryl called wanda madam it was pretty clear that madam was not in control and it started it started out madam should we do this and then it became madam we will do this and uh but it was uh it brought some organization to a uh a very loose household uh cleanliness improved and uh you know for me that was on the road it worked out great in beryl we found a woman of great faith and she prayed for our family constantly she did a good job with the kids the kids loved her and she loved on the kids it uh you know she knew where how to set boundaries and needless to say what kids do they if the boundaries here they will stick their toe over that boundary and it was usually met with a stern stare barrel was and then in perfect king's english she would uh remind them what their transgression was and what and what the appropriate uh response uh should be and that was you know that was good but i asked amanda uh i was talking to her the other night said give me a great barrel story and so she recounted that when she was 12 or 13 years old we were building a class float one of those things you take for the homecoming and you decorate it in our backyard and we did a lot of that kind of thing and the girls the 13 year old girls they had on these very tight very small shorts and they were contorting themselves hammering stapling painting all those things you do a float and barrel pulls her inside and says a lady keeps her legs together or crossed and doesn't wear outfits like that uh and uh amanda was a little embarrassed uh but the fact that she would remember the story today uh his evidence of beryl's impact you know looking back what a fabulous job she did with the kids she prayed for them she prayed with them she modeled how to be a christian lady somebody mentioned uh pastor that was always on the tapes she lived in our garage apartment for years and that's what was coming out of those windows whenever she was there and she was either listening to uh music uh him or she was listening to pastor brandon so any event thank you for letting me speak uh what an amazing lady what a gift to our family um i do think we had a hedge of protection around us because of her prayer and you know you know what's what's really special is that she and wanda are together in heaven now and at the feet of jesus and uh i never saw beryl dance but i hope she is thank you [Applause] what a wonderful testimony you know it's one thing when you live a certain way in church but when see people see you on the outside on your job living the same way it leaves a wonderful impression thank you so much for sharing amen brother jenkins at this time we're going to have a another tribute from sister wayson's nephew his name is john warren and it will be read by sister virginia williams god bless everybody it's my privilege to read um this tribute from sis wayson's nephew john it says remembering baron wayson by john edmund warren nephew pleasant good day to everyone as we gather together to celebrate the life of beryl wayson my name is john edmund warren and i am the nephew of beryl wayson she was my mother's big sister my heart's desire was to be there in person to bid my aunt a feral a final farewell but due to travel restrictions i am forced to look on back home in trinidad and tobago with the rest of the family members i was privileged to be a guest at auntie's home on two occasions my experience with her as an adult is a vast contrast to the memories i have of her as a child growing up that woman was strict yes i said that woman she was a disciplinarian though i don't think she ever physically reprimanded anyone her scolding was enough to bring fear in a child's mind she had a stern look sharp eyes and a fearless tendency for rowdy little children that woman was stripped but i remember receiving a birthday birthday cards with a little usd in it regardless of how strict who would not be happy to hear that auntie barrel was coming home we know she was come she was not coming alone her luggage would contain sweets and other goodies that were destined for our greedy bellies she walked very quickly i remember her as an older youth leaving our home walking down i'm not i'm not pronouncing this right bill bellew role in belmont she walked with authority i remember thinking to myself them americans feel like they own everything as she walked in the middle of the street as there was nothing as there was no sidewalk her steps were filled with confidence shoulders upright and a stern look she was the boss it is a vivid memory of her commanding steps i remember clear i remember the clash i remember quite clear i remember the clash of personalities as an adult i was an adult or so i thought i was quickly reminded of my place granny had just passed and she was back home it was over a book granny had said i could take she was not aware of our agreement i ended up leaving the book right there i believe the book is still on the shelf undisturbed i mentioned that i was her guest on two occasions the first time i visited with my wife stacy and it was a pleasant experience looking at her now with matured eyes she wasn't that bad at all in fact she was very loving and proud of me and the wife i had chosen within two years we were there again this time i carried my son zion she fell in love with zion the strict disciplinarian had but all vanished she was still stern but gentle at the same time we had good talks through our visits she shared her experiences we had good dialogue we were all looking forward to visiting a third time but covet 19. she had good friends in the persons of sister brown and sister virginia i know she has other good friends but these are the two that i know she spoke well of her young pastor as well she loved her church family she had many a spiritual conversation we had many a spiritual conversation this was our family upbringing to be close to the lord it is indeed sad to lose her suddenly but her memory lives on i feel robbed her stern look is replaced with a pleasant smile she had a way she used to kind of blush i would say i will remember that always virtuously dressed like her other two sisters my mother and aunt dolores never seen any of them in pants to walk the street always in a skirt we all have that hope in christ jesus to live again until that time i bid thee farewell amen certainly appreciate the

appreciate brother wesko and for just opening up his doors and appreciate uh brother jack i guess she got three pastors this morning up here uh brother wesko and had brother james as a pastor and then i came in i think i might have passed the longest 23 years and we transitioned and we kind of combined our churches uh with spirit and truth and so brother jack is actually a pastor but um i would have felt good if he went on and took it this morning but uh i was supposed to be in arizona this weekend uh preaching out there but um i knew that i could not go uh once i heard that sister waiting that passed it that just the whole thing kind of threw me off a little bit uh seeing her that that sunday and she was fine and you know every sunday she always kind of made it a business to uh shake my hand and we would have a small conversation and and uh she said god bless you to ask me about the family you know my kids are uh adults now and different ones is gone justin is married and william is out of state working andrew moved the way christine is a man but she always uh made it a business to inquire about them my wife and my children and we just have a little quick conversation and i'm jetting towards my car because i'm like man that's a little drive to get get you know to chobe before i get tired and uh so so i took a hand i'm still uh just thinking about you know sunday it was a little bit a little bit cool in the church and she had this little tan hat on and she had a little trench on you know one thing you if you know anything about uh situation i always admired her because she met she kind of reminded me of my my grandmother she had this certain elegance about her and and just her her style and her attire she wasn't flashy but but you could tell that she was influenced by influential people and uh it kind of has strutting everything and she always really kind of because my grandmother maybe was a little bit taller than that but my grandmother was a thin real classy lady real classy lady and and you know uh you i just i think everybody had the same testimony about sister wayson she was elegant elegant and she was all that but sister weiss was tough so sis waste was a tough lady and and my reminder my grandmother she was cool but she was tough don't get her wrong hey man sister wait situation was always something else but uh she was always special to me uh i always look forward to her kind of coming in church and uh just sitting there and just just kind of uh uh maybe watching i maybe want to read the scripture and i'll talk a little bit and we're just kind of move in and try to get out of your way this morning we want to read a little passage of scripture from the book of ephesians chapter one it says uh verse four accord as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him and love having predestinated us to the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has made us accepted and beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace when he has made he has abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the foolish of time he might gather together and won all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be uh to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believe you were sealed with the holy ghost of promise which is the earnest of your inheritance until the redemption to purchase possession until the praise of his glory amen may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word probably a strange scripture to read and read at a funeral was a lot of things that we thought about talking about i maybe want to use as a topic this morning god's purpose uh his plan and his and um just to kind of uh backtrack just a few seconds um like we say we we saw sister wayson and i think our nephew said it uh you just figure sometimes that you got time you you got time we we don't think about uh a lot of times people uh transitioning and things of that nature and and as far as i i saw uh swayze was fine you know she kind of strutted back there but but she was she always been kind of cold nature even even back in okeechobee she'd always say pastor boy this place is cold [Music] it's called butter smiley uh but uh we we really appreciate it but but just hearing of her transitioning it just kind of uh threw me just a little bit because it was something that you know i wasn't expecting and pastoring like we say um for for 23 years uh it's just certain people uh that you look forward to them uh coming to church when they walk in you just feel it's just it's just something about it that as a as a servant of god as a minister of god and the preachers know what i'm talking it's just certain people when they show up you know that they're going to pull on the word of god they go they're going to help you get through it no matter what you're saying amen how you might be cutting what you're saying they're going to be riding with you and sister wayson was that kind of church member one of the things that you know i'm reminded of i remember you know when i started pastoring i was really really young in the ministry and and oftentimes i used to tell god you know why me you know i ain't ready for this he said you might not be ready but you got to do it all right and and and i'll say this and and pastoring and pastoring uh uh matured people in the gospel puts a lot of pressure on you especially especially when when you're young in the gospel and you you don't have the confidence and i ain't that individual in mo all right but at that time amen you know as a young convert i mean a young minister and and you know having to just kind of preach to people like you know sister burrs and sister lewis and crossed over and and sister wasting and sometimes you know uh sister joseph uh would come from trinidad and she'd be in the congregation boy put pressure on you as a young man i tell you and and and you know you just you just looking for a nod you're looking for some kind of response uh or something uh uh from them but you know it it it was a blessing being able to pass to them and preach to them you know because because they were instrumental in my growth amen as a servant of god because they constantly pulled on the word of god they constantly uh uh encouraged me uh in the gospel through through my many my just many ups and downs being there support that means a lot for any shepherd to just find people that's supportive of you amen when when you're just trying to preach christ to the people and and trying to bring the people to a place where they just really understand what amen god's plan and purpose actually is and and you know thinking about her her her death you know uh in in the flesh it's still difficult you know it's going to take a little minute to kind of get over it but but by understanding what god's purpose and plan and promises are that helps me a man as an individual realizing amen um um the deaf angel couldn't have took her until god was done with her right no matter no matter how it looked god god's amen uh uh was done with her service on this earth on this side it was done it was finished is that right death death was just was harmless it was just her transportation from this dimension to that dimension said right now now as a believer it was just her transportation because because amen in the mind of god god said this is the time way before she ever even got here this will be the time this will be the date is that right that she'll transition regardless of what anybody think regardless of what anybody feel this is the time this is the date this will be the moment and i'm gonna tell you something i was thinking about something because we had we kind of have a pretty uh praying church and and we gotta get some results when we start praying and and and you know i was just thinking about something i said god said you know what i'm gonna take a soul swift i'm gonna take out of here so fast i ain't gonna give them time to start praying i ain't gonna give him time to start moaning and and groaning and and pleading with god i'm gonna take the soul swift i was at work and and troy brother troy called me and and and he said you know jack jack called you and i said no he said situation in the hospital and i looked and i saw where jack had sent me a text and i was like what then we you know kind of the day went on and got off work and you know talked about jack and everything and then by i then went to bed and got up next morning i seen the text i was like oh wow mind blowing but it was god's plan amen it was god's plan it was god's it was god's plan it was god's purpose to do it right not for not right you know one of the things i realized and i ain't gonna be here but but a minute right but one of the things i realized we we we are under this notion that we're going to be here amen uh forever but what we don't realize this world is falling apart is that right there's there's something that's there's a shift there's a transition that's taking place is that right this has got to give way so that could come in is that right when we we we understand the principles of scripture right we we realize amen uh the the call of god was for a purpose god calling situation had a purpose a redemptive purpose something that goes far beyond amen all of the things she did in the natural is that right amen you know god had her name placed on the land book of life before the foundational world is that right god called her she heeded the call amen she fulfilled scripture she lived the life on this side is that right but that ain't it is that ain't it i'm always reminded of the song my mother-in-law sings you know somebody tell you that i'm dead and gone don't believe them is that right in another part say my life still going right on is that right see see here's the thing here's the reason i really can't be sad because i realize amen god had a plan and a purpose god has a plan and a purpose and and and that's only going to be somebody going to be alive and remaining going to be changed but everybody else got to come this way also is that right but you know what i realize it's going to be all right but for the believer it's all right right amen there was there was a time in scripture where where people feared death job questioned about it he could see nature having a resurrection but he couldn't see it in humanity right to god gave him a revelation right but but under under grace and truth we we can see clearly by scripture is that right amen the bible said let's just know that if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i got another body this this scripturally scripturally description lets us know that there's the best is yet to come i remember we used to sing that song all the time brother west coast the best is yet to come is that right amen we ain't seen nothing yet the best is still yet to come when when we when we transition right as believers from from this dimension to that next dimension it gets better is that right oh my you know i like bible i just like the bible yeah the bible lets me know you know what when i transition i ain't got to worry about crying no more amen i ain't got to worry about worrying about bills no more i ain't got the i ain't got to worry about the aches and pains no more huh in my other body my hair is there come on when i get when i got converted in 1988 i had hair i you know the little half i had in here it was black all right now now it's great it it it gets better is that right according to god's plan and its purpose it all gets better is that right i watched situation over the years like like people say she just had a strut man walking behind sister waiting you had to have some be in good shape she she'd strike out and probably leave you yeah you know huh and brother west go back in the day brother wesker used to move so fast it was like my god you the long strides but you know what we're we're all getting older we're all getting older we're all getting uh uh closer to what what we we've been preaching about what we've been talking about what what we've been shouting about here since the way she just beat me there right she she she just beat me there said right you know god god was just finished with her life on this side god said you know what hey man go get her is that right he left us because a lot of us probably just need to get ourselves together y'all don't talk to me i'm free to go but right he realized she she lived a life worthy of the gospel right and and you know when it comes down to your eulogy it's it's you live your your eulogy it's the life that you live you know i was at a funeral yesterday uh uh my cousin's husband passed away and uh like the preachers say you know i'm not here to put you into heaven i can't put i didn't put sister waiting anywhere it was the life it was her choice it was her her acceptance of jesus christ and what he did for her amen on calvary accepting accepting his plan and his program and his will right and that's that's the thing that in ministry you you try to relate this is god's plan this is god's program this is god's will either you're going to get with it or you're not right come on somebody and and here's here's the thing it's your choice it's it's your choice whether or not you're going to get with god's plan god's program amen god's thoughts amen and enter into to the jaws of the lord intent to the thing that that's so far you know uh better than than what we got here is that right amen uh i'm looking forward to the change is that right i'm looking forward to the change you know uh none of us are perfect right uh we're not perfect it's it's it's it's all a work of grace in our lives and and and my uh uh my prayers i remember years and years ago i've kind of cloned this brother taylor uh i remember years ago brother telling you i always say lord help us lord help us and and that's still and that's still the thing lord help us all it it it takes it takes him no matter how long you you you've been in church right you know how long you you you've been running we got to keep running we we got to be determined to continue amen to run to continue to fight to continue to get better is that right as christians in all areas of our life amen we just got to be determined is that right just to fulfill amen god's plan god's purpose god's desire for a church he desires to have a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing you know what i'm glad to say that i'm one of them is that right i'm glad to be a part of god's choice he chose me huh he he chose me not because of of who i am but because he know what he could produce in me and i'm grateful to god this morning i'm grateful for the uh opportunity to have pastored sister wayson for for 23 years and and she was just a real joy like brother what's going to say she didn't give me no problems i didn't have to sit with her in the office and counsel and things of that nature she was just a joy uh to pastor and i appreciate her she's definitely gonna be missed in my little corner uh uh where we at now i i used to could just kind of look over there and just kind of see her and everything i see a bobble head and throw her hands up with the word striker uh i won't be able to see her over there uh uh anymore in that corner but it's grateful that i know where she's at is that right and and and and you know i'm just looking forward to the time that you know um we can come together again on the other side and and and fellowship amen we we've lost some giants in the gospel and uh uh they've definitely been missed people that just really was there to help me out uh on on my journey i've kind of transitioned so but i but i appreciate him i appreciate the saints of god and just looking out at some of the folks that have had the privilege uh when i was pastor and being able to pastor uh and hopefully hopefully you know you've been a bit of blessing in some form uh to him uh to the to the wasting family uh we we just want to say how much we really appreciated the opportunity to uh shepherd uh situation i think we since the way sin grew on us and we grew on her amen and so just we just want to continue to pray for one another is that right uh continue to pray for the wasting family um got a chance to meet several several of them and i will say this and i'm going to get out of here her brother brother a herbert uh that that that was my dude right there if i could say it like that he he was my dude i'm gonna share this and i'm gonna go uh maybe a couple of years ago maybe before the pandemic brother jack in them uh would have this valentine's day wasn't the valentine's day thing this this valentine's day uh uh banquet and uh so um herbert herbert you know he used to watch me a little bit and so her brother herbert kind of challenged me he told me say boy i'm to be at that valentine's day and uh i'm going to get you he was talking about dress attire and i said oh yeah oh yeah i said okay come on with it brother herbert brother herbert went shopping white stepped up in there he was shocked he was shocked and uh so i say i say i asked him later on i say y'all hurt it up who you think won he looked at me saying it was a tie he said he said it's a tie i said okay well i'll shake hands on that i'll give you that but uh just some some of the precious members in the waste and family over the years we we have had the privilege of of meeting her mother and and just nephews and different ones uh we we've had the privilege of me so we appreciate the lord and like we say just continue to pray for us uh uh continue to pray for them and uh i think we're we're gonna all we're gonna all be all right is that right let's get a load of hand to pray turn it back [Applause] certainly appreciate brother smiley amen god's purpose uh plan uh his promises and we just uh i thank god for that we're coming to the close of our uh service today and as as he mentioned earlier she's had four pastors here in florida and you all have heard so much about her life and i just happen to be the last pastor uh that that served her and and brother smile was just talking about how we are a praying church and roughly a year ago uh sister wayson when they made the transition she you know kind of took eel and sisters were taking care of her and she had some problems with her with her feet there and um you know she could barely walk barely put shoes on uh it was a real real struggle for and you know she was just saying pray for me i want to i want to be in church and not only just be in church she wanted to be in the prayer meetings that we were having at church you know that was 7 a.m in the morning on sunday mornings we'd be there and uh for years sister wayston was always there even if she was a part of the church in okeechobee she still since she lived right down the street from the church she said i just want to come go to prayer and then i'll go back home and get ready and you know going over to okeechobee so for years you know it's been fellowship like that but uh last year when she came and she was having problems with the feet just really couldn't walk and uh there was a lot of things going on and you know and and the saints just began to pray and as they began to pray we saw god touch uh sister and uh and i remember one morning uh i was coming to prayer and walking through the parking lot and i see sister wayson jumping out the car and uh and just i mean look like she took off almost running trying to get inside the church before the clock struck seven and uh and i was just so blessed and i told my wife i said look at sister ways and look at how god done touched to look at that you know and it just something that uh just really blessed my heart and like brother smiling and saying had god not taken her the way he took her we would have been we then prayed her right on back in amen and and i'm quite sure sister wayson's in a place that had we prayed her back she might have had a stern look for all of us come on somebody amen she graduated amen so we rejoice with our sister and you know as he talked about you know just just death is nothing but a driver transportation to take into the presence of god uh you know they told you the story i and i want you to think about i want you to get this in your mind because what you've heard here today will actually bring judgment to some of us she would catch a cab from coral springs all the way here to west palm beach to this church and and i want you to go maybe go on google and find out how much it costs for you to catch a cab to come to church and she did it faithfully never asking anything of anybody but i believe some saints found out that she was doing this and they decided that they would begin to pick her up and drive her and and one of those things that found out about it was my mother who sung earlier and uh and at that time i was just a young man uh a teenager and i was just learning how to drive and you know so mama uh uh and employed um a driver and uh our responsibility was to you know get in the car with mama and we would drive from here to coral springs to pick up sister wasting and then we would drive back to church and then we have two services on sunday and we'd drive back home that night and then drive back to west palm beach and we did this for for a number of years i was her driver praise the lord i was her driver and um within the last year you know many of you all i i won't let me let me just also include some of you all were responsible for driving her from here to okeechobee and bringing her back i believe sister ashley was talking about early but there are other families in here that were responsible you were her driver you were her driver the reason that they couldn't get her to drive because she needed some drivers about a year ago um a little over a year ago uh the churches merged and uh i had the opportunity to pastor and we've had many conversations just about the word of god and just a real blessing a man to have sister wayson in our uh congregation but through the preaching and the teaching of the word of god i still was her driver and the purpose of driving now is to try to drive her closer to god through the preaching and teaching of the work we were trying to drive her closer to god and i had the awesome privilege to stand at her bedside on the night that she passed and when she called me and they took her to the hospital we went and we prayed over her and prayed with her and some of the saints were there sister michelle and sister brown sister virginia uh uh her cousin errol hey man they were all there and you know just visiting her at the hospital and we we we knew that it would take a miracle for god to raise her up and uh you know we just kind of watched we prayed and we just waited on the lord and you know we said lord it's all in your hands he's the one that gives life and he takes it away it's all it's all up to god so you know we just prayed we had the church praying at night i left the hospital went to the church and did our teaching for the night and and then i got a call you know after uh service was over got a call say hey we're not sure she's gonna make it through the night and and uh so i said okay i'm i'm on my way back to the hospital and we went there to the hospital and um and what we got there is me and sister brown and sister virginia and sister ashley a man uh four four of us that were there and uh the nurse was telling us you know everything that was going on and i was just watching just watching my precious sister and and i have to tell you um it was one of the most peaceful transitions i ever saw in all my life uh seeing her just look like all she did was just fall asleep and i couldn't believe what i was witnessing and i said man this is this is what the bible uh when the bible says precious in the sight of the lord is the death of one of his saints i said this is precious and and as the nurse began to test it now look uh you know we we you know they had a connected to the machines that were supposed to be given a life but a life is just slowly fading away and we knew this was the hand of god so as we were there in the hospital i reached real quick and i got my bible because the nurse the nurse came and she said look i don't think it's gonna be much longer i don't think it's gonna be much longer i say okay okay so i reached and got my bible and i said i think i'm gonna need to drive because i was a driver earliest and i'm gonna be a driver at the end too i say while i'm on this side i want to drive her right into the presence of god so i reached over and i got my bible and i picked up my bible and i began to drive i say the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside steel waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his namesake and i kept driving i say yes oh i walk
