[29:29] a man an introduction
[29:31] um many y'all though most of us know
[29:34] brother caleb and we were trying to put
[29:36] it together i think it's been
[29:38] eight years amen and brother marquis
[29:41] that go that ate again
[29:44] but i think it's been eight years since
[29:47] brother uh caleb has been with us
[29:50] and um
[29:51] you know just
[29:52] the lord
[29:55] through this time he's
[29:57] been called to pastor amen a church
[30:00] there in tucson amazing grace tabernacle
[30:03] and i've had the opportunity to go out
[30:04] and just be in fellowship with them a
[30:06] couple times and we've always enjoyed
[30:08] the fellowship
[30:09] uh but uh but uh you know it just felt
[30:12] like the lord was just kind of keeping
[30:14] that home which i understand when i
[30:15] first started first 10 years i i went
[30:18] nowhere
[30:20] i went nowhere and uh but you know then
[30:22] as the lord just releases you you try to
[30:24] do what you can for the bride of christ
[30:26] uh but uh he's been having in his heart
[30:29] to come this way come this way come this
[30:31] way and we were not just able to get
[30:33] things sorted out and finally finally we
[30:36] got it worked out and on the very week
[30:38] that he was supposed to come the devil
[30:40] attacked his body and uh we were talking
[30:42] on the phone i'm like i don't know i
[30:44] might have to cancel his ticket and uh
[30:46] but uh but he called back and said
[30:48] brother jack i'll see you on thursday
[30:50] i'm feeling a lot better so god touched
[30:52] him and and he is here by the grace of
[30:55] god so
[30:56] uh amen
[30:58] amen
[31:00] so i i hope you all come tonight to pull
[31:03] on the word of god
[31:05] amen and uh i know that we're not um
[31:10] everybody you know that's typically your
[31:11] own stunt is not able to make it on
[31:13] services like this but that's okay i
[31:15] believe god got something special for
[31:17] each and every one of us amen i'm
[31:20] reminded of something that brother hugo
[31:22] said years ago he says you know if you
[31:24] had the opportunity to go to a meeting
[31:27] amen that brother branham was preaching
[31:30] or had the opportunity to have a one on
[31:33] one
[31:34] um interview with them which would you
[31:37] choose
[31:39] now see if your life ain't right
[31:41] you go to the meeting
[31:44] but if your life was right
[31:46] you know you're living up right before
[31:48] god
[31:49] you choose that one-on-one time with him
[31:51] that he could just maybe sit and share
[31:53] some of
[31:54] the secrets of your heart and just give
[31:56] you answers to questions that you might
[31:58] have
[31:58] uh that's what i feel like we have
[32:00] tonight
[32:01] god is coming this is gonna come in a
[32:03] small little group and just give us
[32:06] individual attention
[32:07] amen that we can just uh we can just
[32:10] rejoice in so i pray that the lord will
[32:12] use our brother amen in a very very
[32:15] special way so let's stand to our feet

[36:16] amen amen so god bless you it's
[36:20] certainly good to be back in the house
[36:22] of the lord here it's spirit of truth
[36:23] tabernacle
[36:24] and it i guess i better hold on to it
[36:27] it uh it's been a while like you said
[36:29] about eight or nine years and and we
[36:31] were playing around earlier eight nine
[36:32] ten eleven twelve what the point is it's
[36:34] been too long
[36:36] and it got to that you can keep playing
[36:37] softly or i'll just start preaching
[36:39] without you but i i was saying that uh
[36:43] it got to the point where i thought i
[36:44] was never gonna come back here
[36:46] just not because i don't want to but
[36:48] just because of circumstances and so
[36:50] forth and i think brother jack you've
[36:52] been to tucson almost as many times i've
[36:54] been here maybe
[36:56] and then sister anne and my daughter my
[36:58] daughter's never been here
[37:00] sister anne has and she said to tell you
[37:02] all this is her home away from home
[37:04] and she misses you all in
[37:06] and uh so i told her that you know i
[37:08] said i'll tell him and then nadine says
[37:10] well tell them all i said hi
[37:12] and i said you don't know him she goes
[37:13] tell him i said hi anyway
[37:15] so my daughter says hi
[37:17] yeah and it's it's good to have brother
[37:19] jesse and his wife with me that's not
[37:21] something that happens usually
[37:23] it started off as a joke and then they
[37:25] showed up and i'm glad they're here
[37:27] and little winston and i call him
[37:30] winston the pooh when you get to see him
[37:31] you'll understand why
[37:33] but it's just good to see each and every
[37:35] one of you here and brother jack i
[37:37] couldn't help but get a little
[37:38] sentimental
[37:40] the faces have changed just a little bit
[37:43] you want things to stay the same and the
[37:45] same the fireballs the ones here are not
[37:47] here
[37:48] but god has raised up
[37:50] different fireballs
[37:52] amen amen it's all right
[37:55] you're not going to scare me by saying
[37:56] amen
[37:59] you you think things are always going to
[38:01] stay the same and then we were talking
[38:02] about earlier people have come and gone
[38:04] and and pastoring has been a has been it
[38:06] has been an adventure
[38:08] to say the least and i'll say this with
[38:10] all due respect anybody who wakes up one
[38:12] day says i think i'll be a pastor
[38:14] need to go see a psychiatrist
[38:17] or they can borrow my bible
[38:19] and my notes
[38:21] and brother smiley they can take my
[38:23] phone
[38:24] and i've had brothers say what do i need
[38:26] your phone for i said just give it a
[38:27] minute you'll see
[38:28] you can you can preach your first sermon
[38:30] and take my phone and you put up with
[38:33] all that nonsense and then come back and
[38:34] tell me if you still want to do it
[38:36] brother jesse's one of our preachers in
[38:38] the church and and he sees what i go
[38:40] through sometimes and i i tease him i
[38:42] turn around so you want to be a pastor
[38:43] and he goes no i'm all right you just go
[38:45] ahead
[38:46] you go see
[38:48] so one day he may be raised up to be one
[38:50] but i that's not the point the point is
[38:53] if you want to be one find another job
[38:55] there's better ways to make money
[38:58] brother green used to say there's got to
[38:59] be a better way to make a living right
[39:02] so in the meantime uh my my church uh
[39:05] greets you in the name of the lord jesus
[39:06] christ the amazing grace tabernacle
[39:08] tucson arizona and uh i didn't know that
[39:10] was gonna happen
[39:12] but
[39:13] at the end of an outreach that i started
[39:15] to do
[39:16] and uh for the lord the lord put on my
[39:18] heart actually he had put in my heart to
[39:20] start a church and and i ignored it
[39:22] anybody ever done that anybody ever
[39:23] ignored the lord
[39:25] thank you for being honest i appreciate
[39:26] that
[39:27] and then he told me to start a church
[39:28] and i decided i'd start an outreach
[39:31] that would pacify the lord you know
[39:33] but it didn't do the job and so then
[39:36] after a while when he put on my heart
[39:37] it's time to go
[39:38] i actually met with brother greene and
[39:40] talked to him about it and everything
[39:42] went smoothly
[39:43] smooth much more smooth than i thought
[39:45] it would
[39:46] and when we parted ways brother green
[39:48] told the church there and there's
[39:49] witnesses here
[39:51] at least one in the back there where he
[39:52] said he did not split the church he is
[39:54] an extension of us and don't anybody say
[39:57] that and then he went on and it's on
[39:59] tape i like saying that
[40:00] it's on tape he said he is the only
[40:03] brother that ever left this church and
[40:04] did it the right way
[40:06] so
[40:07] i i don't know he's had like 35 of them
[40:09] leave
[40:10] and so i thought i'm the only one who
[40:11] did it the right way
[40:12] [Music]
[40:15] well all right then and then he did
[40:17] something that surprised me when i us
[40:19] when i announced my resignation
[40:21] you know unofficially resignation
[40:22] whatever so i'd be leaving the next
[40:24] sunday would be my first service
[40:27] he said there's some of you here that
[40:28] are going to want to go with them
[40:30] and you have my permission
[40:32] and so instead of starting off with 20 i
[40:34] started off with 60 or 70. and it seems
[40:36] like every time i preach a funeral i
[40:38] pick up another five or ten right
[40:40] so it's not me it's god doing the work
[40:43] and um last december we had a brother
[40:45] come through and he preached a little at
[40:47] our anniversary meeting and and he said
[40:49] god is not through with tucson yet and
[40:52] we all said amen then he said god is not
[40:54] through with amazing grace tabernacle
[40:56] yet so we got excited and i think
[40:58] tonight i want to say god is not through
[41:00] with the bride of jesus christ
[41:02] amen
[41:03] we're right there
[41:05] we're right there
[41:06] so go on ahead get married have kids get
[41:10] jobs do what you got to do
[41:12] but live like he's coming any minute now

[41:17] heart

[46:05] amen
[46:09] amen so back home uh and and i always
[46:12] thought this would be kind of tacky and
[46:13] i always try not to do it and i said
[46:15] well i'm not going to be one of those
[46:16] preachers that comes you know as a
[46:18] pastor and says what i preach in my
[46:20] church is and uh you know because i was
[46:22] kind of thought man preached something
[46:23] that we ain't that no one else has ever
[46:24] heard you know but uh i i don't i don't
[46:27] i find myself in a very strange
[46:29] predicament because i can understand why
[46:31] the lord would want me to bring this
[46:33] wherever i go because this is the uh
[46:35] hour that we are being plagued with such
[46:38] um such atrocities as you are seen we
[46:41] are in the middle of uh what they call a
[46:42] pandemic we are not only in the middle
[46:44] of a pandemic but there are so many
[46:46] things uh that that you need to be
[46:49] careful what you read on the news and
[46:51] what you see on the news and you need to
[46:53] be careful what you're reading on the
[46:55] internet and if it's not good news and
[46:58] then then you know you can only read the
[47:00] same headline so many times
[47:02] just because they reward it doesn't mean
[47:04] it's different uh you know i don't know
[47:06] i can watch the news uh it's kold 13
[47:08] back home and is that at 13 or cbs
[47:12] whatever it is uh that's one that i
[47:14] usually watch but they always every hour
[47:16] in the morning it's uh it starts at six
[47:17] and then seven eight nine and they have
[47:19] news i like to keep up on current events
[47:21] but i started to realize there was a
[47:23] certain theme any time that they that
[47:25] the new uh what do you call a reporter
[47:27] anchor or whatever it was come on they
[47:29] said the same thing late breaking news
[47:31] on this certain thing and it's late
[47:33] breaking to them because they were
[47:34] asleep the last hour right but they're
[47:36] saying the same thing that that chuck
[47:38] said and that lil said and that this one
[47:40] said but it's late breaking i said i've
[47:42] watched the same story four times it's
[47:44] not late breaking and but they say the
[47:46] word update and i pay attention
[47:49] so tonight i'm going to preach you an
[47:50] update all right i'm going to show it's
[47:53] the same thing you've always read but
[47:55] i'm going to show you an update now this
[47:57] is late breaking i want you to pay
[47:59] attention because this is the latest
[48:01] thing that's come out so far
[48:02] and what and what i'm getting excited
[48:04] about is that i was starting to read
[48:06] scripture and i told brother jack about
[48:07] another scripture that i'm going to read
[48:08] on tomorrow i said brother jack i'll be
[48:10] honest with you i've read the bible
[48:12] through a couple of times i'm not
[48:13] bragging but i've done it we do it at
[48:14] our church as a calendar it's on our
[48:17] calendar every day has got a certain
[48:18] scripture and you all do that yeah we
[48:20] read through it and if you're faithful
[48:21] you read through it the entire year and
[48:23] we're all reading it together
[48:25] and i got some of the folks that got
[48:26] their own little arrogant ways and they
[48:28] say oops
[48:29] i said it i'm not gonna take it back
[48:31] they got their own little arrogant ways
[48:32] and i'll say it if i was there and
[48:34] they'd like they do this certain thing
[48:35] like well i'm going to read the bible my
[48:37] own way with how i'm led i said that's
[48:39] not the point
[48:41] i didn't tell you not to read the bible
[48:42] the way you feel it i said read it with
[48:44] all of us and then do your own
[48:46] devotional on the side or vice versa i
[48:49] said at some point it's bound to happen
[48:51] all of us are going to read the same
[48:53] scripture at the same time and get in
[48:55] one mind and one accord
[48:57] i'm trying to set a stage to get
[48:59] something to happen here
[49:01] and it seems like people don't want you
[49:03] to set a stage they don't want you to
[49:05] create an atmosphere they don't want you
[49:07] to do anything that's going to get them
[49:08] any closer to the coming of the lord
[49:11] let me give you
[49:13] whoa i'm ready see we had brother bernie
[49:16] garcia he passed away
[49:18] and before he had passed away for some
[49:20] 20 odd years maybe 30 he'd made this
[49:22] prediction and he said before he said
[49:25] when the phoenix suns rise in the west
[49:27] and they win the championship he said
[49:30] the rapture will happen not too far
[49:32] after
[49:33] that's what he said so now this last uh
[49:36] when they call it
[49:37] finals what's it called the series or
[49:40] okay finals this last finals i'm not a
[49:43] basketball guy but this time i not only
[49:45] became a fan but i got a jersey too
[49:50] hey
[49:51] but i found out that people were telling
[49:53] brother bernie was telling other people
[49:55] he said you know they pray against us
[49:58] and people think i'm joking and they
[49:59] don't want it to happen and it never
[50:01] dawned on me why would anybody not want
[50:03] this to happen
[50:05] no it's not in the bible no it's not
[50:07] this or that but brother a lot of things
[50:09] that are prophesied are not directly
[50:11] there can you understand what i'm saying
[50:13] god shows you this is going to happen
[50:14] you won't get in that car accident the
[50:15] car accident is not in the bible but it
[50:17] doesn't change the fact that it's been
[50:19] prophesied
[50:20] and if the car accident has to happen
[50:22] before i go to the rapture then let the
[50:24] car accident happen i don't care because
[50:26] that's one thing that didn't that
[50:27] happened and now i can go on to the
[50:29] rapture you understand what i'm saying
[50:31] well they didn't win the championship
[50:33] no not the nation national championship
[50:37] but in order to get to that final round
[50:40] they had to win a championship
[50:42] and the suns did rise in the west i
[50:45] don't care if it sounds like i'm
[50:46] promoting a team like i said i'm not a
[50:47] basketball fan i don't care about kobe i
[50:50] don't care about colby and i don't care
[50:51] about lebron and i don't care about
[50:53] jordan they make money off of something
[50:55] that i didn't pay for and i don't care
[50:58] you know people are cheering for things
[51:00] that they they're not getting paid to
[51:01] advertise why are you wearing that
[51:02] jersey it don't matter to them
[51:05] right they lose one fan they got 10
[51:06] million more who cares right they don't
[51:09] care about me but we know their stats
[51:11] and we know this and we know that and
[51:12] i'm like well what are the stats of
[51:14] saint paul
[51:15] how many times was paul beaten somebody
[51:17] tell me that how many stripes did paul
[51:19] and peter get how many knocks in the
[51:21] head that silas get you know all about
[51:23] jordan all about lebron but how many how
[51:26] many stripes did jesus christ take for
[51:28] your sins and for your healing come on
[51:30] somebody tell me
[51:32] how tall is michael jordan i don't know
[51:33] but how tall was brother branham
[51:37] right you want to talk about world
[51:39] series and how many bats and how many uh
[51:42] what they call it when they hit the ball
[51:43] and it goes all the way out home runs i
[51:45] want you to tell me how many how many
[51:47] home runs did brother branham have in
[51:49] the prayer line when he called somebody
[51:50] out and they were healed how many home
[51:52] runs did that profit have
[51:54] [Music]
[51:56] now let's get to the rookie card how
[51:58] many home runs have i had
[52:00] you know what
[52:02] come on brother jack how many home runs
[52:04] has brother jack had see you know all
[52:06] about i don't know baseball names
[52:08] griffin and whoever else i don't care
[52:11] but this time i paid attention
[52:14] and and brother jesse said now they
[52:15] didn't win the national champion he said
[52:18] but pastor he said they did win a
[52:20] championship and while people the
[52:22] western finals thank you and so people
[52:24] are like oh it didn't happen but i'm
[52:26] sitting there thinking but what if it
[52:27] just did
[52:30] you understand what i'm saying we're
[52:32] trying to get people to change the way
[52:35] they think
[52:37] you understand this is an update this is
[52:39] an upgrade i'm tired this is the same
[52:41] stuff that we've been reading and i told
[52:44] brother jack to me i've read the bible
[52:46] through and we have uh people you're
[52:48] supposed to be doing it together to get
[52:49] in one mind and one accord and i said to
[52:51] him i thought but it's something strange
[52:53] i read in scripture and it looks to me
[52:55] like i've never read it before
[53:00] ever happen to you was that ever even
[53:02] there or i'm not kidding did he just put
[53:04] that there when i wasn't looking because
[53:06] i don't remember it be the ink still
[53:08] looks wet to me
[53:10] all right
[53:12] i'm trying to show people something
[53:14] we've got to change the way we think
[53:17] we have been geared to look at updates
[53:19] we have been geared to look at your
[53:20] phone and brother if you're too busy on
[53:22] facebook and i'm not knocking what you
[53:24] do but if you're using social media for
[53:26] the wrong thing i want you to watch a
[53:28] program called social
[53:30] dilemma has anybody seen it
[53:33] it's from higher ups
[53:35] ceos telling the story of why you're so
[53:38] attached to your phone
[53:40] okay they learn your character yes they
[53:44] do and they know whether or not you've
[53:46] looked at it for a while and if you
[53:48] hadn't they send you an alert to get
[53:50] your attention and in in the in the in
[53:53] the show or the movie the documentary
[53:55] they have people on there like the
[53:57] fellow who invented the like button
[54:00] and he tells you how badly he regrets
[54:02] ever doing that he said if i don't know
[54:04] that that button would have would have
[54:06] appointed or led to so many suicides i
[54:09] would have never told them about it
[54:11] now you think about that for a minute
[54:13] but yet we let our kid we hand our kids
[54:14] the phone and look be honest the reason
[54:16] we give them a phone is because we
[54:18] really don't have time to pay attention
[54:19] because we're too busy looking at our
[54:21] phone
[54:24] be nice to hand them a bible because
[54:25] we're too busy reading our bible so here
[54:27] read one of your own
[54:30] amen
[54:32] i'ma let you sit on that a little bit
[54:33] let it marinate
[54:35] right so watch that and then you all go
[54:37] back and discover and you decide within
[54:39] yourselves whether or not you want
[54:40] social social media anymore that's just
[54:42] a free one okay
[54:44] as for me in my church if you're into my
[54:46] ministry i don't have it
[54:48] i've had deacons take it off i've had
[54:50] deacons pull it out of the house i've
[54:51] had deacon sit down i've had people in
[54:53] my in our church sit down discussing
[54:54] with their families and say we've
[54:55] watched this we've decided for our own
[54:58] we're not going to have any kind of
[54:59] social media whatsoever because it only
[55:00] leads to one thing and that's problems
[55:02] now you all might not have that issue
[55:03] here my brother so you do as you're led
[55:06] it's your church i understand but as for
[55:08] me and my house we're going to look at
[55:09] something else
[55:10] let me explain something to you when
[55:12] jesus christ comes back it's not going
[55:13] to be on facebook
[55:17] don't you think it's strange that the
[55:18] one of the things that we hear jesus say
[55:20] the most which is follow me follow me
[55:22] follow me is the one thing we hear all
[55:24] the time follow me on twitter follow me
[55:26] on instagram follow me on facebook
[55:29] everybody's saying follow me follow me
[55:30] follow me but the only one we should be
[55:32] following is the one who coined that
[55:34] phrase when jesus said tell all that you
[55:36] own and follow me
[55:38] come on somebody shout amen
[55:41] amen guys brother caleb you're all over
[55:43] the place you forgot what it's like to
[55:44] be an evangelist no i didn't that's why
[55:45] i'm doing it
[55:47] all right
[55:48] so we we went back and we started a
[55:50] little experiment
[55:52] and what had happened was i was sitting
[55:54] there and i i couldn't sleep one night
[55:56] you ever had that
[55:57] you're a pastor you sleep soundly every
[55:59] night don't you
[56:00] not not every night i don't sleep at all
[56:02] any night
[56:03] so what had happened was i got up and i
[56:05] said well what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
[56:06] listen to a tape and i i just stumbled
[56:08] on the greatest battle ever fought
[56:10] so i put it on here look at that hum
[56:12] [Music]
[56:14] that's right that's right ooh ooh yeah
[56:16] ooh go back and listen to right
[56:18] so i listen to it and i'm listening and
[56:20] i hear uh brother branham say if there
[56:23] was he no if we all got the same mind
[56:25] same accord and so forth he goes there
[56:26] wouldn't be anybody here that wouldn't
[56:28] want healing that wouldn't get it and i
[56:30] listened i said what was that
[56:31] and i sat up and i kind of heard him say
[56:33] it again and i rewound it and i listen
[56:35] again and i thought to myself in my
[56:37] heart i promise you not out loud i said
[56:39] why not critical now but i said why
[56:41] isn't brother branham saying that and
[56:43] and pertaining to body change and
[56:45] rapture and resurrection but come on you
[56:48] know for the healing let's move on
[56:50] now i'm being respectful now
[56:52] and the lord speaks back to me in a
[56:54] voice not my heart in a voice and he
[56:56] says this because it wasn't time yet
[57:00] so i got depressed immediately put my
[57:02] head down i just got smacked by that pay
[57:05] attention boy shut up you know and i got
[57:07] sad about it but then out loud he said
[57:11] but now is the time
[57:14] all right so then i woke up and the very
[57:16] next morning was sunday and i got up
[57:18] what do you think i preached on greatest
[57:19] battle ever fought
[57:21] so what i did is i started an experiment
[57:23] and i asked my church if they would just
[57:25] faithfully do this for me with me if
[57:28] they would listen to the greatest battle
[57:30] ever fought every day for one every
[57:32] night for one month
[57:34] i said i don't care if you fall asleep
[57:36] because that teaches you to in a
[57:37] different way i said but i want you to
[57:40] get a a habit i want you to pray and if
[57:42] you fall asleep that's fine but you know
[57:44] if you hear it whatever but i want it to
[57:46] be played at least one time every day
[57:48] for a month brother jack i've got to
[57:50] tell you things began to change within
[57:52] our church
[57:55] right
[57:56] i'm glad i got a witness
[57:58] and then so we went on like that for so
[58:00] long that i went to a couple of churches
[58:01] in the phoenix area and and i told them
[58:04] what i did and three different churches
[58:06] in the phoenix area decided to do the
[58:07] same thing
[58:09] i said well we're coming towards the end
[58:10] of our month and the brother said oh
[58:12] you're not going to do it no more and i
[58:13] said well if you all are going to do it
[58:14] then i'll do it so we went on a second
[58:16] month and these churches jumped on it
[58:18] for an entire month and i started to get
[58:20] testimony back they said brother caleb
[58:22] it is changing the way our young people
[58:24] think it is changing the way our elders
[58:27] are thinking it is changing the way we
[58:29] worship the way we approach god and i
[58:31] said i wonder what that is it's not
[58:32] because i did something but it's the
[58:34] greatest battle ever thought and if you
[58:36] go back and you listen to that message
[58:38] word by word and dissect it and listen
[58:41] it begins to transform and rewire not
[58:44] your heart but your mind
[58:48] why because we have been taught by this
[58:51] world to fear everything
[58:55] especially in 2020
[58:58] don't touch this don't eat this don't
[59:00] taste this don't
[59:02] they wanted a shield over your eyes a
[59:04] shield over your mouth gloves on your
[59:05] hands and if you didn't know anybody
[59:07] you're all walking around like this
[59:10] and no nobody know where they're going
[59:12] and if you sneeze for god's sake don't
[59:13] sneeze in a supermarket i sneeze and
[59:16] target and everybody did like this
[59:18] i had masks gloves and goggles and i
[59:21] sneezed because of the mask and
[59:23] everybody moved
[59:24] and i go i go to the house go on calm
[59:26] down
[59:29] oh
[59:30] you and then they're like you're
[59:33] profusely sweating because it's tucson i
[59:36] have gloves on and a mask
[59:39] [Applause]
[59:41] and they want to know why i'm sweating
[59:44] oh you're right i shouldn't be sweating
[59:46] because it's tucson it's 110 and i've
[59:48] got goggles on a mask on and gloves on
[59:52] two pair of gloves because they said one
[59:54] pair wasn't enough
[59:56] they're teaching us to fear
[59:58] everything
[1:00:00] they control this don't go here don't go
[1:00:02] there don't do this don't do that and if
[1:00:04] that wasn't enough they said don't even
[1:00:06] go to church because church is where
[1:00:08] everybody's getting it
[1:00:11] nobody got it in church not in our ranks
[1:00:13] anyway i found out people got it they
[1:00:15] got it in school when they were still
[1:00:17] open
[1:00:19] now we got a bunch of uneducated dummies
[1:00:21] because they didn't do their homework
[1:00:24] they sat at home for a year we got
[1:00:26] people that got lazy and fat and dumb
[1:00:29] because they didn't do what they were
[1:00:30] supposed to do and now they're behind
[1:00:32] their bills and what happened it was
[1:00:34] handed to you what happened
[1:00:36] we were being controlled
[1:00:39] we were being rewired but i'm glad that
[1:00:42] we have a god that saw that and said put
[1:00:45] it on my heart caleb have them listen to
[1:00:46] this while the rest of them are being
[1:00:48] rewired this way you'll be rewired this
[1:00:51] way
[1:00:52] stay in the word
[1:00:54] see it
[1:00:56] are you with me so far
[1:00:58] i read that scripture to point out this
[1:01:00] think on these things whatsoever be
[1:01:02] honest whatsoever be true whatsoever
[1:01:04] whatsoever but this is what we are this
[1:01:06] is how people are all right no one loves
[1:01:08] me
[1:01:10] come on don't act like nobody thinks
[1:01:12] that

[1:01:21] like that now don't make me really get
[1:01:23] serious

[1:01:30] wouldn't get my inheritance and that's
[1:01:31] all they want
[1:01:34] come on right
[1:01:35] if i died they just get another pastor

[1:08:49] pray for your slappy which way do you
[1:08:50] want it it's nothing but a state of mind
[1:08:54] that you have accepted
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:59] i'm ugly
[1:09:02] i'm ugly
[1:09:03] well who said you were ugly i know i am
[1:09:06] well you know
[1:09:08] sometimes we just can't help ugly now
[1:09:10] can't we
[1:09:11] but i've known some ugly people that
[1:09:13] were very beautiful
[1:09:15] you couldn't tell they were ugly because
[1:09:17] the inside of them was shining so bright
[1:09:20] that you didn't matt man i know this
[1:09:21] beautiful girl what is she like don't
[1:09:23] worry about that i'm gonna show you and
[1:09:24] you can tell the brothers like oh come
[1:09:25] on man but he gets to know the girl and
[1:09:27] all of a sudden you find out you know
[1:09:28] what she's a really good i said i told
[1:09:30] you she's beautiful man
[1:09:31] well i'd say he's a really handsome guy
[1:09:33] big old guy coming there he's like what
[1:09:35] i said just talk to him you'll
[1:09:36] understand what i'm saying ugly doesn't
[1:09:38] mean that you're ugly you think you're
[1:09:39] ugly you think you're you look in the
[1:09:41] mirror and you see something that other
[1:09:42] people don't see
[1:09:44] but see i like this because when god
[1:09:45] looks at me he sees something that other
[1:09:47] people don't see
[1:09:51] this might seem like abc's but i'm just
[1:09:53] getting started so just give me a minute
[1:09:58] uh i like this in arguments for
[1:10:00] argument's sake whenever something bad
[1:10:02] happens i'm innocent
[1:10:04] i'm the victim here
[1:10:06] now that's not true and most of us know
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] we need to own what we do to cause
[1:10:11] problems with each other
[1:10:13] it's a whole lot easier uh meemaw i
[1:10:15] learned it's a whole lot easier to
[1:10:17] apologize for something even though i
[1:10:19] didn't do it it's a it's easier just to
[1:10:21] say look i'm sorry for my part i'm sorry
[1:10:23] for the misunderstanding can we just
[1:10:24] move on because if you don't they're
[1:10:26] going to stop keep with the blame game
[1:10:28] blame game you know what you're right
[1:10:29] i'm the pastor i should know better i
[1:10:31] shouldn't have said it like that i
[1:10:32] should and i back up so that they'll
[1:10:34] lean forward just a little bit then i'll
[1:10:35] hug him and i said are we done with his
[1:10:37] nonsense yet
[1:10:39] and we move on right brother jesse knows
[1:10:41] he's seen me do it i've had ministers in
[1:10:42] the in my church at the office while i'm
[1:10:44] dealing with certain things and when
[1:10:45] these people walk out these people when
[1:10:47] the individuals walk out the preachers
[1:10:49] look at me like why you just throw them
[1:10:50] out and i said because i can't
[1:10:53] and uh my assistant pastor says that's
[1:10:55] why you're the pastor and i'm not
[1:10:57] because i told them where to go i said
[1:10:58] that's right that is why we are what we
[1:11:00] are because jesus is not interested in
[1:11:03] kicking people out
[1:11:04] jesus is interested in who to bring into
[1:11:06] the kingdom not throw them out see
[1:11:09] our little vendettas get in the way and
[1:11:11] we start to look for how to get rid of
[1:11:12] certain people so maybe you can play the
[1:11:14] organ or you can play the piano or you
[1:11:15] can do something up here see
[1:11:17] brother jack don't know it yet but i'm
[1:11:19] the talent in this church and if you
[1:11:20] only give me a chance out loud sing out
[1:11:22] play out preach everybody if that's your
[1:11:24] attitude then you ain't got no business
[1:11:25] behind this holy desk and don't you
[1:11:27] worry you're not gonna get your chance
[1:11:28] because preachers can see that a mile
[1:11:30] away
[1:11:31] pastors can see that a mile away
[1:11:33] now i'm meddling i can feel it i'm on
[1:11:35] somebody's toes
[1:11:38] enough's enough we've got to stop
[1:11:41] thinking that everything is about us
[1:11:43] well you see because it is and it isn't
[1:11:46] it's about you if you're going to follow
[1:11:47] in the line with jesus christ but it's
[1:11:49] not about you if you're going to cause
[1:11:50] trouble
[1:11:52] right i'm sorry i didn't realize that
[1:11:54] the amazing grace tabernacle revolved
[1:11:56] around you brother sister how can i help
[1:11:57] you make it an easier time for you
[1:12:00] don't you ever feel like just getting
[1:12:01] smug like that bro you got my blessing
[1:12:04] sir
[1:12:05] he turned around so i'm sorry i didn't
[1:12:06] realize that spirit and truth was raised
[1:12:08] around just your little whatever it is
[1:12:10] you got i'm just gonna listen i'll tell
[1:12:11] you what tell me how to do it because
[1:12:12] i've been here so long i don't know how
[1:12:15] wow
[1:12:20] i don't know what you got going on here
[1:12:21] jack but i'm about to find out
[1:12:25] amen somebody amen
[1:12:32] i'm pathetic
[1:12:34] i'm poor
[1:12:36] i'll never have anything
[1:12:40] well i don't understand that look how it
[1:12:42] says i am poor
[1:12:44] i am pathetic
[1:12:46] you know there was this i am movement
[1:12:48] going around on youtube and they were
[1:12:50] saying things like i am holy spirit now
[1:12:51] there are some aspects to that that i
[1:12:53] believe and understand
[1:12:54] but then when they got to saying i am
[1:12:56] god
[1:12:58] we need to be careful because we are as
[1:13:00] gods we are sons and daughters of god
[1:13:01] that makes us a god but we're not the
[1:13:03] god
[1:13:04] how many understands that it gets a
[1:13:06] little confusing but that is the way it
[1:13:08] is
[1:13:08] you are a god in the sense of this you
[1:13:10] create your own atmosphere you can be a
[1:13:12] god you can and if you're gonna go
[1:13:14] around saying i am pathetic and i have
[1:13:15] nothing and i am poor and i'll never be
[1:13:17] anything and i am nothing guess what you
[1:13:18] are you're going to be you're going to
[1:13:20] become what you say you are
[1:13:22] but i'm going to say i am rich
[1:13:25] because my father is rich
[1:13:27] my father owns the cat on a thousand
[1:13:28] hills the golden amount in the mountains
[1:13:31] of silver mines too and i am heir to the
[1:13:33] father heir to the throne i am in the
[1:13:36] throne of god i'm not on the side i'm
[1:13:37] not in front of my back i'm in the
[1:13:39] throne of jesus christ
[1:13:41] hallelujah
[1:13:44] how many understands what i'm getting at
[1:13:46] i am depressed no you're not quit saying
[1:13:48] it i i i i'm pathetic that's one of my
[1:13:51] favorites i'm pathetic why do you say a
[1:13:53] thing like that why do you say you'll
[1:13:54] never have anything you know i started
[1:13:57] off with nothing but god gave me
[1:13:58] everything i had a little building on
[1:14:01] broadway and the lord blessed it then we
[1:14:02] ended up with the church we have now and
[1:14:04] then when i was in the when i first
[1:14:05] moved there there was a a a back house
[1:14:07] that we wanted to use as a fellowship
[1:14:09] hall and i stood there and i looked out
[1:14:11] at it and i said i need that building
[1:14:12] and the brother said how are you going
[1:14:13] to get it we barely got this i said but
[1:14:15] we did get it so i need that building so
[1:14:17] i said lord i need that building and it
[1:14:19] turned out there was somebody living
[1:14:20] there and uh
[1:14:22] and uh well
[1:14:23] he ended up not being very nice but we
[1:14:25] offered him 1500 to move on out and he
[1:14:28] didn't have much so 1500 bucks was a lot
[1:14:30] of money to him so he took that 1500 he
[1:14:33] left and i got my fellowship all right
[1:14:37] and just to make it look nice and pretty
[1:14:40] what we did was we invited him back and
[1:14:41] baptized him he became a member of the
[1:14:43] church and he is now a good brother
[1:14:45] and he didn't like us when we drove up
[1:14:47] the first time
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:53] i was selling my house and nobody was
[1:14:55] buying it it was on the market for
[1:14:57] almost two years
[1:14:58] yeah ouch ouch ouch and i was preparing
[1:15:02] to move in the fellowship hall because
[1:15:03] we're about to have to give it up and
[1:15:04] didn't have this and didn't have that
[1:15:06] and suddenly somebody bought the house
[1:15:08] next door well i wanted that house but i
[1:15:09] couldn't afford to do the renovations
[1:15:11] nor buy it but somebody bought it and
[1:15:13] renovated it and i was gonna move into
[1:15:14] the fellowship hall when i walked out
[1:15:16] i'm walking out the lord said to me he
[1:15:18] said caleb you're never gonna have to
[1:15:19] live there
[1:15:20] i said well where am i gonna live then
[1:15:21] and he turned my head this way
[1:15:23] so i called the real estate agent the
[1:15:25] very next day and i told the real estate
[1:15:27] agent i said i needed owner kerry so i'm
[1:15:28] not doing it i said i need it. but see
[1:15:30] what happened was before i called them i
[1:15:32] talked to my uh one of my mortgage
[1:15:34] lenders over there called and i said i
[1:15:37] need that house so he made the call
[1:15:38] turns out the guy was his best friend
[1:15:42] i didn't know that turns out that his
[1:15:44] secretary was sister to one of the real
[1:15:45] estate agents in my church
[1:15:47] i didn't know that yet come on right
[1:15:50] and i was like and so both of them said
[1:15:52] you need to sell it to this pastor and
[1:15:54] he says no i don't so anyway he gets me
[1:15:55] on the phone i talked he said well i'm
[1:15:57] not going to do it i said well fine

[1:18:28] but he didn't i went to the church
[1:18:31] and me and the some of the brothers are
[1:18:32] doing some work and i get a text message
[1:18:35] text message is from a family in the
[1:18:37] church and they said brother caleb we've
[1:18:38] got x amount of stock we've sold it we
[1:18:40] have x amount of dollars and i'm not
[1:18:41] making this stuff up i hope you
[1:18:43] understand that
[1:18:45] and they said we failed to give you the
[1:18:47] ties off of it all of it
[1:18:50] and i text back i said i'm not that guy
[1:18:52] you're not going to do that you just
[1:18:54] hold on to it and and i'll just as we
[1:18:56] have need of we'll ask you and so forth
[1:18:58] and my one of the brothers there was my
[1:19:00] cousin he could tell i was disturbed and
[1:19:01] he came along and he said brother he
[1:19:03] said cuz come here man because what's
[1:19:04] bothering you i said i didn't tell him
[1:19:05] how much because i'm not going to ever
[1:19:07] say how much i said this this this and
[1:19:08] this and he goes you just got through
[1:19:10] saying that people don't do that anymore
[1:19:12] that people don't believe in ministry
[1:19:13] like that no more that god doesn't move
[1:19:15] now you have somebody offering you
[1:19:16] something you need and you're saying no
[1:19:18] and i said i need a vindication so i
[1:19:20] went and i prayed and i said lord in the
[1:19:21] next 45 minutes i need it to rain
[1:19:26] that's all i said now i know rain in
[1:19:28] florida is like you know
[1:19:30] every day but in tucson it ain't like
[1:19:32] that
[1:19:33] thank you brother
[1:19:35] and so 45 minutes to the dot it began to
[1:19:39] rain
[1:19:40] was it predicted and it rained for 45
[1:19:42] minutes
[1:19:44] so then i texted brother and i said to
[1:19:45] the family and i said i'll accept your
[1:19:47] offer thank you and he said did it rain
[1:19:49] over there
[1:19:50] and i said why and he said because we
[1:19:52] got together as a family we said lord in
[1:19:54] order for him to believe this let it
[1:19:55] rain wherever he is
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:02] we've got to change the way we think
[1:20:06] so now
[1:20:08] so now
[1:20:09] let me just give you the rest of it it
[1:20:11] was twice the amount of money that i
[1:20:13] asked for
[1:20:14] twice
[1:20:15] and i had the money for the down payment
[1:20:17] and i'm still living in that house today
[1:20:20] don't tell me that god can't do it
[1:20:22] come on somebody's saying man
[1:20:28] i know it sounds like i'm a prosperity
[1:20:30] preacher but i'm not see the problem is
[1:20:32] is the bride is already prosperous
[1:20:34] through jesus christ
[1:20:36] she can have what she speaks
[1:20:39] not what she asks for but what she
[1:20:41] speaks she can have what she speaks she
[1:20:44] can have what she speaks can you say
[1:20:46] amen all she has to do is say i need
[1:20:49] this i hate this i got that and the lord
[1:20:52] will give you what you asked for what
[1:20:54] you speak what you claim what you say by
[1:20:57] faith it's yours in the name of jesus
[1:20:59] christ
[1:21:00] hallelujah
[1:21:03] do you believe it
[1:21:06] so no wonder god bless you may be seated
[1:21:08] no wonder no wonder the bride if she
[1:21:10] says she's ugly she can be ugly no
[1:21:12] wonder if the bride says she's depressed
[1:21:14] she can be depressed
[1:21:16] listen i'm not saying it's ordained of
[1:21:18] god but it's your words that is bringing
[1:21:21] it about
[1:21:22] and if you can bring depression on
[1:21:23] yourself why not bring
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:26] anti-depression if you can speak ugly in
[1:21:29] yourself why not speak beautiful on
[1:21:31] yourself
[1:21:32] if you can speak poor on yourself or or
[1:21:35] broke down and nothing why not bring or
[1:21:37] speak something and riches and and
[1:21:40] wealth in your life if you can say that
[1:21:43] god don't know you then why don't you
[1:21:44] say god knows my name
[1:21:46] if you say that no one loves me then why
[1:21:48] don't you say god loves me god knows me
[1:21:51] god adores me and i love him too
[1:21:54] come on somebody say amen
[1:21:57] if you can say you're not happy then why
[1:21:59] not say every day i'm happy every day
[1:22:02] i've got the joy of the lord is my heart
[1:22:05] and the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:22:08] every day every day
[1:22:12] hallelujah

[1:24:19] negative things don't tell each other
[1:24:20] negative things

[1:24:39] much of your makeup that you don't gotta
[1:24:41] say it anymore it's in your presentation
[1:24:44] you walk into a room and already they
[1:24:46] know you're more than a conqueror
[1:24:48] my brother said he went down to target
[1:24:49] he said i didn't even have a tie on he
[1:24:51] said i was between services i was
[1:24:52] walking down he said it must have been
[1:24:54] the anointing from the service or
[1:24:55] something he said but every employee was
[1:24:57] how can i help you do you need help
[1:24:58] finding something where is it what is it
[1:25:00] i go it is the anointing it's god the
[1:25:02] holy ghost overshadowing you and they
[1:25:04] recognize there is something different
[1:25:06] about this individual
[1:25:10] well what happened your mindset has
[1:25:12] changed
[1:25:13] now look this might sound like it's
[1:25:15] abc's but i want to ask you then why
[1:25:17] haven't we been doing it
[1:25:19] don't don't come at me like well that's
[1:25:21] the greatest battle i ever fought yeah
[1:25:22] but what do you know about greatest
[1:25:24] battle ever fought
[1:25:25] you know that's the name of a powerful
[1:25:26] sermon but have you heard it lately
[1:25:31] i mean lately like in the last two days
[1:25:33] oh it got quiet
[1:25:36] i heard it just this morning
[1:25:38] i heard it last night i heard it on the
[1:25:40] way down to west palm beach i can quote
[1:25:43] it would you like me to because i got it
[1:25:44] right here
[1:25:47] this is what i did
[1:25:49] i printed it out
[1:25:51] in big letters
[1:25:53] on big pages because i didn't want to
[1:25:54] wait for vog to send me a book so i
[1:25:56] printed it out that might be against the
[1:25:57] rules but i don't care
[1:26:01] it should be okay if you would think
[1:26:02] that wouldn't you
[1:26:03] let's just say praise the lord
[1:26:05] i'm gonna read you i'm gonna read you
[1:26:06] some bold print
[1:26:08] you know what i'm talking about
[1:26:10] i'm just going to read the bold print
[1:26:11] but i printed out the whole thing
[1:26:13] and what i did was is i took i don't
[1:26:16] know how many services it was brother
[1:26:17] but it went on for a little bit every
[1:26:19] service consecutively just preaching out
[1:26:22] of this
[1:26:23] i only used a few scriptures and i
[1:26:25] didn't i didn't get all uh you know uh
[1:26:27] what do you call it on tangents i just
[1:26:28] stayed right with it page after page
[1:26:31] line after line
[1:26:33] and after a little while you could tell
[1:26:35] people like man at first i think he got
[1:26:37] on their nerves but after a while like
[1:26:38] hey this is good stuff
[1:26:40] i said you need to listen to this
[1:26:41] because it's doing something to you i
[1:26:42] want you to listen to a couple of these
[1:26:44] things that'd be all right with you
[1:26:46] i want to make a statement that he tells
[1:26:47] you first of all he says it starts here
[1:26:49] and i had a little matter of fact i got
[1:26:51] it but maybe i'll do it tomorrow a
[1:26:52] powerpoint and i showed how the body
[1:26:54] works and the mind and everything and it
[1:26:56] says as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:26:57] because we know
[1:26:58] that the decision to be saved is in here
[1:27:01] right and brother brennan says it starts
[1:27:04] here
[1:27:05] in in the greatest battle he said then
[1:27:07] it moves up here
[1:27:09] he says you you choose god here
[1:27:12] but you make the decision here
[1:27:15] and then it goes back down to your heart
[1:27:18] and from here it goes everywhere
[1:27:22] oh so here's something interesting
[1:27:25] you need your mind
[1:27:28] to cooperate with your heart
[1:27:31] so just to just to get you all to calm
[1:27:34] down and people to relax and whoever's
[1:27:35] watching
[1:27:37] it's the heart
[1:27:39] hopefully and most likely is not the
[1:27:42] problem with the believer
[1:27:44] all right
[1:27:45] we've all been in this room i believe
[1:27:47] we've all been saved
[1:27:49] we've all accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:27:51] in our heart right the troubles not with
[1:27:53] your heart brothers sisters the trouble
[1:27:56] is in your mind
[1:27:58] when it goes up here
[1:28:01] it somehow gets in a gets in a fight
[1:28:03] here now brother branham doesn't say it
[1:28:06] like this because he says constantly
[1:28:08] it's in the mind but if you if you're if
[1:28:11] brother jack feels led to and you all
[1:28:12] decide to do what we did just to try it
[1:28:14] out as an experiment you'll hear after a
[1:28:16] while that he begins to elude that it's
[1:28:19] not just here but between the mind and
[1:28:22] the heart
[1:28:24] the trouble is the heart is fighting
[1:28:26] with the mind the heart knows what to do
[1:28:29] but the mind thinks it knows better
[1:28:33] all right
[1:28:34] because the mind was taught
[1:28:37] to out-think the heart
[1:28:41] how much time do i have because
[1:28:43] cause on my watch it's 6 30.
[1:28:48] say it again brother
[1:28:50] i'm gonna do it
[1:28:52] who is this little whippersnap get up
[1:28:53] here and preach boy no no don't move he
[1:28:55] was going to come up
[1:28:57] he'll come up wouldn't he
[1:28:59] god bless your heart
[1:29:00] look at this
[1:29:02] your heart knows what to do but your
[1:29:04] mind thinks he knows better now here's
[1:29:06] something i'm going to say out here that
[1:29:07] just kind of
[1:29:09] food for thought
[1:29:10] i wonder if we were ever supposed to
[1:29:12] talk
[1:29:15] just just think about that
[1:29:17] the angels the seraphims they don't talk
[1:29:20] they only open their mouth to praise
[1:29:23] they don't sass the lord they don't turn
[1:29:25] around saying we're going to change the
[1:29:26] tomb we've been singing holy holy for
[1:29:28] eons of time and i'm getting tired of
[1:29:30] this song here
[1:29:31] so you got to write something else he's
[1:29:32] god tell them to create a note
[1:29:35] they don't do nothing like that do they
[1:29:37] no they keep singing holy
[1:29:39] holy is the lord our god almighty holy
[1:29:42] holy is the lord
[1:29:43] and i wonder if men were ever supposed
[1:29:46] to talk
[1:29:48] now i know it sounds silly but when they
[1:29:51] and you might laugh you're going to
[1:29:52] laugh because i laughed when i thought
[1:29:53] about it when they say that they saw it
[1:29:55] when people say they see aliens
[1:29:57] they always say the same thing their
[1:29:59] brains were kind of big
[1:30:01] their mouths were really tiny and they
[1:30:03] never said a word and somehow they were
[1:30:05] communicating with each other
[1:30:07] now no okay that's all right but let's
[1:30:09] go back to the animal world you can
[1:30:12] watch a pride of lions
[1:30:14] run after a herd of of of wildebeest
[1:30:18] and it seems like it's chaotic
[1:30:21] but they all got their mind on that one
[1:30:24] no no that was too skinny the fat one
[1:30:26] no that was too big no i'm not the one
[1:30:29] that's kind of there that's the one the
[1:30:31] horns like this yeah that one
[1:30:33] and they're all look like they're doing
[1:30:34] something different but they're all
[1:30:36] working towards the same goal to get
[1:30:38] that poor unsuspect while he's
[1:30:39] suspecting now he's he's it you know
[1:30:41] that will be like man i know it's me
[1:30:42] they're coming after me i know it's me i
[1:30:44] know it is oh god it is
[1:30:47] right he then he knows
[1:30:51] and he's like you don't want me i drink
[1:30:53] coffee all the time you don't want me
[1:30:55] i don't eat you know i eat nothing but
[1:30:57] vegetables you don't want me
[1:31:00] but they all know it's that one and i'm
[1:31:02] just going to ask you we all say it's
[1:31:04] instinct is it
[1:31:06] i'm just asking a question brother i'm
[1:31:08] not trying to introduce some crazy thing
[1:31:10] but is it
[1:31:13] your dogs look at you like they
[1:31:14] understand you do they
[1:31:16] your babies can understand every word
[1:31:18] you say did you know this two weeks out
[1:31:21] of the womb
[1:31:22] they just lack the capacity to answer
[1:31:25] you back
[1:31:26] so it makes me wonder were we ever
[1:31:29] supposed to talk at all
[1:31:32] can you imagine being told when you're a
[1:31:34] little boy or a little girl no not
[1:31:36] don't use words that's rude
[1:31:40] think what you want i'll bring it don't
[1:31:42] cry like that i'll bring you a bottle
[1:31:45] answer me right
[1:31:46] and the baby goes
[1:31:48] and mommy comes over the bottom
[1:31:51] now i know you're laughing but if if
[1:31:53] that was the case and then what would
[1:31:55] our mouths be used for to do one thing
[1:31:58] and one thing only praise god
[1:32:01] there'd be now you wouldn't feel so bad
[1:32:03] when you're praising god knowing you
[1:32:05] just cussed out the pastor two days ago
[1:32:08] or or yelling at your wife or your or
[1:32:10] your husband come on come on come on
[1:32:13] calling your kid some name you shouldn't
[1:32:15] have or whatever it is or in the
[1:32:16] schoolyard cousin and then you come in
[1:32:17] you're talking about amazing grace
[1:32:20] you wouldn't feel bad because you'd
[1:32:21] never use your mouth for something it
[1:32:23] wasn't intended for
[1:32:25] it's just an idea just an idea
[1:32:28] just an idea
[1:32:30] you'd only use your mouth to speak the
[1:32:32] word
[1:32:33] and have no trouble because your mouth
[1:32:36] never spoke anything else
[1:32:41] our faith is all messed up because we're
[1:32:44] trying to do something when all we had
[1:32:46] to do is ignore the mind and let the
[1:32:48] heart do all the talking for us
[1:32:51] is that all right
[1:32:52] just food for thought and i know
[1:32:54] everybody's gonna go crazy brother caleb
[1:32:55] went to brother jackie's and he's saying
[1:32:56] we ain't gotta talk no more
[1:33:01] cell phones are getting back to that
[1:33:03] what's texting
[1:33:05] you're not
[1:33:06] talking just just think about it they're
[1:33:09] trying to carbon copy or try to make a
[1:33:12] cheap copy of what we are really
[1:33:13] supposed to be now i need to move on
[1:33:15] because i know we got we do have a time
[1:33:17] chris strain i think uh he says in that
[1:33:19] thought then if that great heavenly host
[1:33:22] he said has to keep its place to make
[1:33:24] everything in order what about the
[1:33:26] disorder of the heavenly host
[1:33:28] right
[1:33:30] when one gets out of order how it throws
[1:33:33] the whole thing out of cater the whole
[1:33:35] program of god is upset and when one
[1:33:38] member listen when one member gets out
[1:33:40] of order we should continually strive to
[1:33:42] keep the order of the spirit
[1:33:46] he said when one member gets out of
[1:33:47] order just one
[1:33:49] he said throws a whole thing out of
[1:33:51] allicator
[1:33:52] look
[1:33:53] as i would to god this morning that
[1:33:56] that we would bring this to a real
[1:33:58] healing service he said that we could
[1:34:00] keep this part group that we have
[1:34:02] gathered under the roof this morning
[1:34:04] i'll say this evening in such harmony
[1:34:06] that the holy spirit would place every
[1:34:08] member of the body that's here this
[1:34:10] morning in such harmony till there would
[1:34:12] be such a spontaneous healing of soul
[1:34:15] and body if we'll just hold our
[1:34:18] positions
[1:34:20] see instead of being worried about who's
[1:34:23] going to do who's going to say or who's
[1:34:25] going to read or who's going to sing how
[1:34:27] about just get in your position and if
[1:34:29] you're called upon you're called upon
[1:34:33] now
[1:34:34] no that's now that's rather petty when
[1:34:36] you think about the grand scheme of
[1:34:37] things
[1:34:38] what we're asked to do in church
[1:34:42] versus what we're asked to do in the in
[1:34:44] the body of christ is very petty
[1:34:46] we we make such an important things on
[1:34:48] little positions that we have created or
[1:34:51] we think or intelligently try to figure
[1:34:53] out what god was trying to do what he's
[1:34:55] really trying to do is just get us into
[1:34:57] position to do our heavenly duty
[1:35:01] how many understand what i'm saying
[1:35:03] i'm not making light of church duties
[1:35:05] i'm trying to make you understand
[1:35:06] something if all we're focused on is
[1:35:07] what we're going to do in church then i
[1:35:09] i worry about you because we should be
[1:35:11] focused on what we're going to do in
[1:35:12] glory in heaven or in the body of christ
[1:35:15] you may never have a job here in spirit
[1:35:17] and truth but your job may be to win
[1:35:19] people over to jesus christ and bring
[1:35:20] them here
[1:35:24] oh i see don't nobody want to be the
[1:35:25] witness
[1:35:28] i've had people want to preach but they
[1:35:30] don't want to go and win nobody they
[1:35:31] just want to preach to people who are
[1:35:32] won already
[1:35:35] i'm just saying
[1:35:37] that job's been filled
[1:35:39] go get some more bring them in somebody
[1:35:42] catch the fish i'll clean them up god
[1:35:44] will use them don't you worry but they
[1:35:46] want to be heard so you see the problem
[1:35:48] with talking too much
[1:35:49] i'm going to go on i'm going to go on
[1:35:51] all right
[1:35:53] now as i said this morning
[1:35:56] only two powers this is in paragraph 52.
[1:35:58] there's only two powers about halfway
[1:36:00] down and there's only two kingdoms
[1:36:02] listen to this two powers and two
[1:36:05] kingdoms all the rest the little i love
[1:36:08] it the little minor things
[1:36:10] getting caught up in who is president is
[1:36:12] a minor
[1:36:15] sadly they assassinated the president of
[1:36:16] haiti but that's also minor
[1:36:19] whatever china is doing is minor
[1:36:21] we're looking at the news and we're
[1:36:23] getting caught up in what they're
[1:36:25] showing us and not seeing what's going
[1:36:27] on behind the scenes
[1:36:29] when the reality is it ain't about the
[1:36:32] the virus or about the mask they're
[1:36:34] trying to figure out a way to shut you
[1:36:36] up
[1:36:38] to not have a voice
[1:36:41] you see what i'm saying about talking
[1:36:43] the government's trying to get you in a
[1:36:44] place where you don't have a voice
[1:36:47] the lord is trying to get you to a place
[1:36:48] where you have the voice
[1:36:51] come on come on follow me close because
[1:36:53] it gets a little deep
[1:36:56] two kingdoms all the rest minor things
[1:36:58] are connected with either one of these
[1:37:01] powers and those powers is god's power
[1:37:04] and satan's power that's what every war
[1:37:07] every disorder everything that comes
[1:37:10] along is either controlled by god's
[1:37:12] power or satan's power and this is my
[1:37:15] favorite part because that's the only
[1:37:17] two powers there is and that is the
[1:37:18] power of life and the power of death now
[1:37:21] that's the only two powers watch i wrote
[1:37:24] in there negativity does not reflect
[1:37:27] god's power
[1:37:30] all right
[1:37:30] if it's negative it's not god's power
[1:37:34] it's satan's power so if you're if
[1:37:36] you're preaching these negative things
[1:37:38] to yourself or to your family or to any
[1:37:41] church you go to you're preaching
[1:37:43] satan's sermon not god's sermon
[1:37:48] i now i've started to tell people you're
[1:37:50] preaching satan's language i don't i
[1:37:51] don't say amen to that i can't hear that
[1:37:53] stuff that messes me up
[1:37:56] and satan can only paragraph 53 can only
[1:38:00] his power got is the perverted power of
[1:38:03] god
[1:38:04] watch this five words it isn't no real
[1:38:09] power
[1:38:10] i want everybody to say it
[1:38:12] isn't no real power now then why are you
[1:38:16] afraid of satan then
[1:38:18] brother branham said
[1:38:19] it
[1:38:20] isn't no real power
[1:38:23] whose power the devil's that coronavirus
[1:38:26] it isn't no real power
[1:38:30] cancer depression uh diabetes oppression
[1:38:35] whatever it is it isn't no real power
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:41] death it isn't no real power
[1:38:47] come on
[1:38:50] somebody better praise god for that come
[1:38:52] on
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:56] it's a perversion of god's power
[1:38:58] everything that satan has
[1:39:01] everything he has the line before him is
[1:39:03] a perversion of god's power can i go on
[1:39:06] all right we'll skip around a little bit
[1:39:08] i wrote down satan is negative god is a
[1:39:10] positive all right
[1:39:12] so we say today we're sitting here at
[1:39:14] paragraph 54 we are here today sitting
[1:39:16] here sitting here and one or the other
[1:39:18] power is going to control us
[1:39:22] brother smiley you know that one don't
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:25] one or the other is going to control us
[1:39:29] so let's cast down the evil one let's
[1:39:32] take our position like the stars of the
[1:39:34] heavens now look look at this i don't
[1:39:37] understand how to make this more clear
[1:39:39] if god isn't controlling you there is no
[1:39:41] in between if god is not controlling you
[1:39:44] there is no in between i want everybody
[1:39:46] to say it if god is not controlling you
[1:39:48] there is no in between
[1:39:50] if god is not controlling you satan is
[1:39:56] come on somebody
[1:39:58] say it nice and loud if god is not
[1:40:00] controlling me
[1:40:02] if god is not controlling me
[1:40:05] satan is
[1:40:07] all right we can close
[1:40:09] i'm not kidding i'm just kidding i'm not
[1:40:10] going to close
[1:40:12] y'all didn't even believe me did you
[1:40:15] gotta get a few more minutes
[1:40:19] you're going to get in trouble with the
[1:40:20] pastor
[1:40:23] you see that
[1:40:24] it's nothing but negativity
[1:40:26] and if god's not controlling your life
[1:40:29] then satan is
[1:40:30] now i know that as lukewarm believers
[1:40:32] want to think that we're still half in
[1:40:34] and half out but there ain't no half in
[1:40:35] or half out
[1:40:37] either god has got all of you or none of
[1:40:39] you
[1:40:40] god doesn't have the left foot and is
[1:40:42] waiting for the right foot
[1:40:45] god doesn't got the left hand or waiting
[1:40:47] for the right hand listen in the
[1:40:48] olympics if you watched if you watched
[1:40:50] any of them run
[1:40:52] when the when the runner was running his
[1:40:54] whole body was involved
[1:40:57] he wasn't his body was not lukewarm to
[1:41:00] the race

[1:41:23] air they're letting out here the hips

[1:41:46] can't find it here
[1:41:48] let me see if i can find it
[1:41:50] you know you should know these quotes by
[1:41:51] now we've been in this so many years
[1:41:54] here's one in uh paragraph 68 the human
[1:41:56] mind was chosen for the place of battle
[1:41:59] where it was begin and that is because
[1:42:01] that decisions are made in the mind the
[1:42:03] head now they never started from some
[1:42:05] organization they didn't start that
[1:42:07] fight there see they never started from
[1:42:09] some mechanical affair the grounds never
[1:42:11] started there therefore the organization
[1:42:13] can never never do the work of god
[1:42:16] because the battlegrounds where you've
[1:42:17] got to meet your enemy is in your mind
[1:42:21] it's not in drugs
[1:42:23] it's not an alcohol it's not in
[1:42:25] extramarital affairs it's not in money
[1:42:28] it's not in politics it's in your mind
[1:42:32] but look we've made it about corona
[1:42:34] we've made it about mask we've made it
[1:42:36] about church affairs we've made it about
[1:42:38] drugs and we my enemy i just can't get
[1:42:41] over heroin yes you can you don't need
[1:42:43] it yes i do no you don't yes i do no you
[1:42:45] don't your mind has made you think you
[1:42:47] do
[1:42:48] but you don't need it
[1:42:52] oh yeah we always talk about the big
[1:42:53] stuff
[1:42:55] what about blood pressure pills
[1:42:57] that's a drug too
[1:43:00] huh what about a a prescribed a drug
[1:43:02] they got me on now for uh for
[1:43:04] indigestion i gotta have this because
[1:43:05] nothing else works
[1:43:08] look i'm preaching to the choir
[1:43:10] now those aren't narcotics brother caleb
[1:43:12] no they're not but they're still drugs
[1:43:13] and if i stop taking the day my body
[1:43:15] goes i need that
[1:43:17] and i'm sitting there going now how do i
[1:43:18] convince this body of mine no you don't
[1:43:21] it's in your mind
[1:43:24] they're prescribing gabapentin by the
[1:43:26] loads because it calms the nerves
[1:43:29] that tell me how is that any different
[1:43:31] than smoking a cigarette
[1:43:33] i smoke brother caleb because it calms
[1:43:34] my nerves no it doesn't jesus calms your
[1:43:37] nerves
[1:43:39] but your mind is telling you you've got
[1:43:41] to light that thing up
[1:43:44] oh it's not the same thing it's medical
[1:43:45] marijuana you must be dumb
[1:43:49] did you bump your head on the way into
[1:43:50] church or something
[1:43:52] do you realize that the thc levels in
[1:43:55] this marijuana is not the thc levels in
[1:43:57] grandpa's weed
[1:43:59] the stuff we bought i don't know if you
[1:44:01] ever smoke weed but i did i'll just be
[1:44:02] honest the stuff we bought on the corner
[1:44:04] is not the same stuff they're selling
[1:44:05] today
[1:44:06] you're talking 12 thc
[1:44:09] versus 85 thc they're turning people
[1:44:14] into insane animals
[1:44:16] and they're so addicted oh nobody gets
[1:44:19] addicted to weed you're right they don't
[1:44:21] you're addicted to the thc
[1:44:23] and you think that you need it but the
[1:44:26] reality is your mind made you think that
[1:44:29] but you don't need it
[1:44:30] i don't know who that's for but that's
[1:44:32] on somebody online that's the word is
[1:44:33] right there
[1:44:36] i don't know why i'm even talking like
[1:44:37] this but i'll tell you what the spirit
[1:44:38] of god is pulling and you all are too
[1:44:40] somebody needs to hear this today you
[1:44:42] need to get this stuff out of your mind
[1:44:43] it's time to change our way of thinking
[1:44:45] i'm telling you try this try this
[1:44:47] experiment
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:49] decisions and chat and verse uh that
[1:44:51] verse paragraph 70. decisions are made
[1:44:53] in the mind with the with the mind the
[1:44:55] mind the head there's where satan meets
[1:44:57] you the decisions are because that god
[1:44:59] made a man that way see can we go on
[1:45:02] just give me a few more minutes here
[1:45:06] oh i like this
[1:45:08] paragraph 74 but the spirit
[1:45:10] it has only one sense the spirit oh
[1:45:12] let's get it the spirit has one sense
[1:45:14] and that sin is either dominates it's
[1:45:18] either faith
[1:45:19] or doubt
[1:45:21] now there's another one right
[1:45:23] you're either god's power or satan's
[1:45:25] power now you're either faith
[1:45:28] or you doubt there ain't no in between
[1:45:31] do you believe brother what kind of no
[1:45:34] sister do you believe god can heal you
[1:45:36] sort of
[1:45:38] well i'm trying to no no no no i need
[1:45:40] you to believe or don't believe
[1:45:43] see
[1:45:46] faith or doubt that's exactly there's
[1:45:48] only one avenue to it that's free moral
[1:45:51] agency you can accept doubt or you can
[1:45:53] accept faith either one you want to work
[1:45:56] on oh i like that because in other words
[1:45:58] if you doubt you've got to work on that
[1:46:00] doubt
[1:46:01] if you have faith you got to work on
[1:46:02] that faith but if you're doubting you've
[1:46:04] got to work on that you've got to build
[1:46:06] your doubt can you imagine the irony of
[1:46:08] it
[1:46:09] can you
[1:46:10] listen it makes sense if you have to
[1:46:12] build your faith then you've got to
[1:46:14] build your doubt
[1:46:16] if your little doubt is as a faith of a
[1:46:19] cauliflower seed
[1:46:21] because i don't like cauliflower
[1:46:24] right then you can doubt that this
[1:46:26] mountain will move and it never will
[1:46:29] i've never said that before and i kind
[1:46:31] of like it
[1:46:32] huh
[1:46:33] you can doubt that god will heal you of
[1:46:35] cancer and he never will
[1:46:37] you can doubt that you are saved and you
[1:46:39] won't be you can doubt you've got the
[1:46:41] holy ghost and you can just forget
[1:46:42] coming to church
[1:46:43] but if you have faith as a mustard seed
[1:46:46] you could say unto this mountain be thou
[1:46:48] removed and cast in the sea and it shall
[1:46:50] be done and nothing i said nothing shall
[1:46:53] be impossible unto you who believes
[1:46:57] do you believe say amen
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:03] if this church right now can be put
[1:47:04] together and end together in such a way
[1:47:06] that every person would want to would be
[1:47:08] in one accord with not one shadow of
[1:47:10] doubt anywhere there would be not a
[1:47:12] feeble person in our midst in another
[1:47:15] five minutes there would not be nobody
[1:47:17] here desiring the holy ghost but would
[1:47:20] receive it if you could just get that
[1:47:22] certain thing fixed
[1:47:24] this is where the battle begins right in
[1:47:27] your mind whether you will or not
[1:47:32] it's not christian science brother
[1:47:33] brandon goes on to say
[1:47:35] he said it's not mind over matter
[1:47:37] he said it's just a matter of fixing
[1:47:39] your way of thinking let me finish up
[1:47:41] with this jeremiah 29 11.

[1:49:47] he's not doing something to hurt you
[1:49:50] on the contrary you're building your
[1:49:52] doubt to hurt yourself
[1:49:55] but i
[1:49:56] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:49:58] neither are your ways
[1:50:00] my ways saith the lord
[1:50:02] it may not seem like god knows what he's
[1:50:05] doing
[1:50:06] but god knows what he's doing
[1:50:08] it's time to rewire your thinking and if
[1:50:10] you go on and do this message brother
[1:50:12] branham coin's a phrase that's very
[1:50:13] popular in our church now but he says
[1:50:15] this he goes see what happened is this
[1:50:17] individual stopped just for a minute he
[1:50:19] talked about that uh he talked about a a
[1:50:21] friend of his that had been baptized and
[1:50:22] cleaned up her life and then one day
[1:50:24] she'd come banging on the door and
[1:50:26] brother bill brother bill brother bill
[1:50:27] and he let's rain what happened you have
[1:50:28] a heart attack or something said no he
[1:50:30] said then i'd like this he said i put on
[1:50:32] my robe open the door i said come on in
[1:50:33] sis come on insist well if i if any of
[1:50:36] us ever get heard of letting a sister in
[1:50:38] our house who wasn't married we'd get
[1:50:39] nailed to a cross brother jack but the
[1:50:41] prophet of god got no problem getting
[1:50:43] away with it
[1:50:44] you know what because our thoughts are
[1:50:45] somewhere else in the gutter
[1:50:48] pastors have to see people and do things
[1:50:50] that people don't understand but they
[1:50:51] want to criticize us for it but i want
[1:50:53] to ask you if you don't want me to do
[1:50:55] anything which one of you is going to go
[1:50:56] and do it
[1:50:57] i just thought i would drop that on him
[1:50:59] for a little bit
[1:51:00] all right
[1:51:02] we need to do things
[1:51:03] we need to pray for certain people
[1:51:04] anyway he lets her in the room and at
[1:51:06] the living room there and his drunk
[1:51:07] buddy was sitting there and he covered
[1:51:08] him up and said what happened she said
[1:51:10] oh i don't i didn't mean it i didn't
[1:51:11] mean it oh i i didn't i didn't say what
[1:51:13] happened what happened she said well i
[1:51:14] went by the old hangout place and some
[1:51:16] of the gang was there and they were
[1:51:17] playing music and i thought i would just
[1:51:19] i would just go and listen for him and i
[1:51:20] would just stop for a minute he said you
[1:51:22] see what happened she stopped for a
[1:51:23] minute
[1:51:24] and then he turns around and says that's
[1:51:25] what the the the prophet said to heza he
[1:51:27] said i want you to take my staff and i
[1:51:29] want you to go that way if somebody
[1:51:30] salute you don't you shoot them back if
[1:51:31] someone in other words if they say hello
[1:51:33] don't you say hello if they ask how
[1:51:35] you're doing don't say nothing if they
[1:51:36] say hey can i borrow a dollar i want to
[1:51:38] give an offering because they don't you
[1:51:39] stop for nothing you just keep going
[1:51:40] don't you stop for nothing and in my
[1:51:42] church we have a phrase there now and
[1:51:44] what we tell each other is whatever
[1:51:45] happens don't you stop for nothing you
[1:51:48] press on towards the mark of the high
[1:51:50] calling in christ jesus
[1:51:52] what is it it's time to rewire your way
[1:51:54] of thinking
[1:51:55] stop using your own thoughts
[1:51:58] i say it like this back home i hope it's
[1:51:59] right stop using your own thoughts kids
[1:52:02] let's get in the mind of christ
[1:52:04] i want to think like he thinks
[1:52:07] i want to talk like he talks
[1:52:09] i want to walk the way he walks brother
[1:52:10] branham says in another place he said if
[1:52:12] you'll let the holy ghost in he'll do
[1:52:14] your
[1:52:15] walking for you
[1:52:16] and i thought you know how many places
[1:52:17] he'd have kept me out of
[1:52:19] he said he'll do you're talking for you
[1:52:21] you know how many things i would have
[1:52:22] never said
[1:52:23] and he said he'll even do your thinking
[1:52:25] for you
[1:52:27] and your thoughts if it's not important
[1:52:30] if it's not important then i want you to
[1:52:31] answer him riddle me this
[1:52:33] why did the angel lord tell brother
[1:52:35] branham
[1:52:37] tell the people
[1:52:39] to be careful how they
[1:52:41] think
[1:52:43] if it wasn't such a problem
[1:52:45] if it wasn't something to hinder your
[1:52:47] faith or hinder the move of god then why
[1:52:49] did he tell him tell the people to be
[1:52:51] careful how they think
[1:52:54] because their thoughts are louder in
[1:52:56] heaven than their words are on earth
[1:53:00] do you see
[1:53:01] how important it is
[1:53:03] to let your own thoughts escape
[1:53:06] and let the thoughts of god come in your
[1:53:07] minds musicians can i have you come
[1:53:10] let's give the lord a hand to pray
[1:53:12] [Applause]
[1:53:21] do you love him with all your heart
[1:53:23] i hope that wasn't too much or too
[1:53:24] little i think it's important brother
[1:53:27] jack
[1:53:28] we're we're in a place in life right now
[1:53:30] where we just can't afford to fool
[1:53:31] around with it anymore
[1:53:33] we've walked this trail and circled this
[1:53:35] mountain long enough and it's time to
[1:53:37] turn northward and go up to heaven he's
[1:53:39] waiting on us to get ready the bible
[1:53:40] said the bride is greater self-ready
[1:53:41] then another place that says his wife
[1:53:44] is now ready
[1:53:45] made herself that way what is it we got
[1:53:47] to get our thinking out of the way and
[1:53:48] i'll tell you all it is is watching the
[1:53:50] news
[1:53:54] is this me
[1:53:57] i don't know how that even happened
[1:54:00] all i did was put it in my pocket see
[1:54:02] what i mean
[1:54:03] they'll figure out a way to get you
[1:54:04] that's a bad phone right there
[1:54:06] i was looking at you guys what are you
[1:54:08] doing
[1:54:10] believe it or not but it's true
[1:54:12] you heard what she said believe it or
[1:54:14] not but it's true
[1:54:17] something about an elliptical
[1:54:21] that's all right
[1:54:23] the devil didn't do nothing he just
[1:54:24] tried it but it didn't work
[1:54:26] he didn't take away from nothing
[1:54:28] see if he had the wrong thoughts that
[1:54:29] have bothered you
[1:54:31] but god knows all things
[1:54:34] let's play that song again lord i want
[1:54:35] to love you more
[1:54:37] let's buy our heads for more would you
[1:54:38] stand
[1:54:40] heavenly father thank you lord for this
[1:54:42] hour that you've given us or so
[1:54:44] to speak on your truths and in your word
[1:54:47] father i pray that justice was done and
[1:54:49] the things that you wanted to say
[1:54:51] and i remember
[1:54:53] i remember happily the way you used the
[1:54:55] gift in my life that you put there
[1:54:57] and i just let it flow lord because
[1:54:59] that's what you always did but i could
[1:55:01] see lord that it was touching certain
[1:55:02] situations in certain lives and
[1:55:05] i'm not looking for some kind of
[1:55:06] recognition or glory because you receive
[1:55:08] all the glory and everything that you do
[1:55:10] but at the end of the day at the end of
[1:55:12] the day
[1:55:13] i want to think like you
[1:55:15] and i want to talk like you and i want
[1:55:18] to walk like you
[1:55:19] i want to do everything
[1:55:22] just like you
[1:55:24] so father would you bless your people
[1:55:26] tonight would you bless those that are
[1:55:28] watching around the world or in the in
[1:55:30] the country wherever it is whoever may
[1:55:32] watch this later on this week
[1:55:34] would you give them peace of mind and i
[1:55:36] mean that literally
[1:55:38] that it's just the devil telling them
[1:55:40] they're not going to make it
[1:55:42] it's just the devil telling them they're
[1:55:44] not good enough it's just the devil
[1:55:46] telling them that you don't know them
[1:55:48] because my bible here says you're aware
[1:55:50] of everything that i do and everything
[1:55:52] that i've gone through
[1:55:54] and i know your word to be true
[1:55:56] when the prophet said don't you stop for
[1:55:58] nothing help your people tonight we pray
