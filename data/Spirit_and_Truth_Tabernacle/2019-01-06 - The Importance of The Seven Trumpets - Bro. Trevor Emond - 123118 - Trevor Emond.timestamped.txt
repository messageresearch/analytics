[1:05:56] Bible if you can stand go to Sam's
[1:06:02] ninety-one
[1:06:08] the sum of David chapter 91 and we read
[1:06:17] from verse 1 to 8 some 91 verse 1 to eat
[1:06:23] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:06:25] the Most High shall abide under the
[1:06:29] shadow of the Almighty verse 2 I will
[1:06:32] say of the Lord he is my refuge and my
[1:06:34] fortress my god in him will I trust
[1:06:37] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:06:39] snare of the Fowler and from the noisome
[1:06:42] pestilence he shall cover thee with his
[1:06:44] feathers and under his wings shalt thou
[1:06:47] trust his truth shall be destroyed and I
[1:06:51] buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the
[1:06:53] terror by the night nor the arrow that
[1:06:56] flies by the day no for the pestilence
[1:06:59] that walk in the darkness no for the
[1:07:01] destruction that wastes at noonday verse
[1:07:04] 7 a Thousand shall fall at thy side and
[1:07:07] ten thousand at a right hand but it
[1:07:10] shall not come nigh thee only with the
[1:07:12] eyes shall behold and see the reward of
[1:07:16] the wicked amen
[1:07:18] shall we be seated just a little
[1:07:21] hesitation and we'll caption it the love
[1:07:24] of Christ through the law of contrasts
[1:07:27] amen the love of Jesus Christ or the
[1:07:30] love of Elohim the love of God through
[1:07:33] the law of contrast amen if you go to
[1:07:37] book a look at what we don't have the
[1:07:38] time but I will give the scripture to
[1:07:40] you Luke chapter 10 which is the story
[1:07:42] of the Good Samaritan Luke chapter 10
[1:07:44] when you start reading from 30 Jesus
[1:07:47] talked about a man who was traveling
[1:07:50] from Jerusalem to Jericho Jerusalem is a
[1:07:53] type of eternity amen
[1:07:55] before we drop here we were part of
[1:07:57] Christ we went a man of God so that is
[1:08:00] Jerusalem Jeremy is Christ or God Salah
[1:08:04] means city of peace
[1:08:05] so before we came here to this sovereign
[1:08:07] world we were part of Elohim before the
[1:08:10] foundation of the world amen but now
[1:08:13] this one has to travel from the mind of
[1:08:15] Christ or from Elohim to the earth
[1:08:17] Jericho is the earth
[1:08:19] is where we have to come and manifest
[1:08:21] amen before brother Salam put on his
[1:08:24] flesh he was part of Christ part of
[1:08:26] Elohim part of grid I am way before the
[1:08:30] foundation of the world but then for
[1:08:32] redemption seek he has to come pick on
[1:08:34] his flesh and be born as a human being
[1:08:37] so that was a Jenny from Jerusalem to
[1:08:39] Jericho amen
[1:08:40] now the Bible Jesus begin to say that
[1:08:42] this man was caught among thieves who
[1:08:45] ripped him of his rod raiment
[1:08:46] amen what was the raiment as we were
[1:08:49] coming here we're supposed to come by
[1:08:51] the spoken word but we didn't come by
[1:08:53] the spoken word we came through the sex
[1:08:55] line amen which took our our virtues
[1:08:58] away which made the sinners which made
[1:09:01] as feeble which gave us limitation but
[1:09:04] that was not end of the story
[1:09:05] amen so this one was stripped and the
[1:09:07] Bible said that he was half naked sorry
[1:09:09] hop dead and half alive we were sinners
[1:09:13] born in sin ship in iniquity according
[1:09:16] to Romans chapter 3 verse 23 for all
[1:09:19] have sinned and fallen short of the
[1:09:21] glory of God but there was something
[1:09:22] alive with us amen
[1:09:24] the City of God was writing you amen
[1:09:28] so as we know the Eagle story we were
[1:09:30] dead but there was this good samaritan
[1:09:32] who was working by the way who is this
[1:09:34] good samaritan the lord jesus christ
[1:09:36] himself
[1:09:37] amen he passed away he passed my way
[1:09:40] through the weight of your day you could
[1:09:43] be by the motto brother brother brother
[1:09:44] brother Jack or brother Trevor or
[1:09:47] whoever give the word to you that was
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ passing your way amen
[1:09:52] now when you had a go message the word
[1:09:54] for your day it quickly you you begin to
[1:09:58] take away your amnesia the darkness
[1:10:01] their sin the limitation of the sex
[1:10:03] birth to let you know that you are not
[1:10:05] just a limited human being but you are
[1:10:07] an ego amen blessed be the name of the
[1:10:10] Lord you are Christ in manifestation so
[1:10:13] the Lord took away all your pains all
[1:10:15] our sins all our infirmities begin to
[1:10:19] heal our wounds our suffering our
[1:10:21] limitations our ancestral cases the Lord
[1:10:24] took all of them are we bind us with his
[1:10:27] own word with a balm balm of Gilead with
[1:10:30] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:31] and Allah said that he put us in an inn
[1:10:34] what is an inn in the audience is an
[1:10:36] English word to mean a hospital who is
[1:10:38] the hospital that is the holy ghost amen
[1:10:41] I think but I gave the scripture oh I
[1:10:44] don't know yes he gave that scripture
[1:10:45] and if he says 4:30 recently somewhere
[1:10:49] near preaching he said that a grave not
[1:10:52] the Holy Spirit of God which I see this
[1:10:54] onto our redemption amen so you already
[1:10:57] redeemed amen
[1:10:58] don't let the devil tell you that
[1:10:59] us-sunnah you were redeemed before the
[1:11:02] foundation of the world and Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] is manifesting the redemption in our
[1:11:05] life so he said that the Holy Ghost God
[1:11:08] changed his ministry Jesus Christ give
[1:11:10] us the word but any said I'm going I'll
[1:11:13] not leave you comfortless I'll come back
[1:11:15] I'll send a comforter he's going to come
[1:11:17] in another form in the Holy Ghost toward
[1:11:20] to come and come and take over every
[1:11:23] situation so after a Redemption God
[1:11:26] knows that you are still a human being
[1:11:27] amen you're gonna need jobs you're gonna
[1:11:30] need healing
[1:11:31] you're gonna need clothes you're gonna
[1:11:32] need houses you're gonna need direction
[1:11:35] from the Lord so the Holy Ghost in you
[1:11:37] is the director amen
[1:11:40] so is that whatever you spend on this
[1:11:42] patient when I come back I'll give it to
[1:11:44] you so the Holy Ghost is there to take
[1:11:46] away all our our infirmities our sins
[1:11:49] our limitations and everything amen
[1:11:53] because from your Jenny from Jerusalem
[1:11:55] to Jericho and from Jericho back to
[1:11:58] Jerusalem is already been paid for
[1:11:59] amen that is our story the Good
[1:12:02] Samaritan is you and I who were born in

[1:12:08] foundation of the world the Lord for new
[1:12:09] you amen the web part of him you were
[1:12:12] Christ amen if you come to the book of
[1:12:15] Acts chapter chapter 8
[1:12:16] remember saw before he became poor he
[1:12:19] was persecuting the church of God he
[1:12:21] didn't know who he was but I chapter 9
[1:12:24] he was walking on his way to Damascus he
[1:12:28] made his pillar of fire and a pillar of
[1:12:30] fire light speaking to a man what a
[1:12:32] Warner is said Saul Saul why do you
[1:12:35] persecute me
[1:12:36] wow that was surprising is the Lord who
[1:12:39] I who are you because Saul knew that
[1:12:42] that was Elohim
[1:12:44] I was Jehovah himself but they didn't
[1:12:46] know him as Jesus Christ he said I am
[1:12:48] Jesus Christ whom thou persecute amen so
[1:12:53] who is Jesus Christ or who was Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ Jesus Christ with a saint who
[1:12:58] Saul was persecuting at that time
[1:13:01] so where is Jesus Christ you and I amen

[1:13:20] together is Christ a manifestation so
[1:13:23] saw said Lord who are thou say I am
[1:13:27] Jesus whom thou persecute so if anyone
[1:13:30] touched you he touches the apple of
[1:13:32] God's eye amen
[1:13:34] because you are modern-day Jesus Christ
[1:13:35] a manifestation you are God God was all
[1:13:39] by himself we know the story when he
[1:13:41] came to subscribe so the Son of man has
[1:13:42] gone hopelessly he said he wanted to
[1:13:44] have what a mini member ministry so the
[1:13:47] Lord went back Hebrew he finished his
[1:13:49] redemption story look back the flesh
[1:13:51] into the cosmos but then the same Holy
[1:13:52] Ghost that was in him begin to work in
[1:13:54] his church he a man he pour himself came
[1:13:57] back into his church not only in one
[1:13:59] person
[1:13:59] but in many members of the body of
[1:14:01] Christ amen as you are here in West Palm

[1:14:16] infinite he can live in his many member
[1:14:19] people and manifest his glory amen
[1:14:21] I'm not going to take too much time you
[1:14:24] are Christ's manifestation the professor
[1:14:27] that got seven dimension seven Rams that
[1:14:30] we live in
[1:14:31] amen we have got a first second third
[1:14:34] dimension we've got the space that we
[1:14:36] see around as human beings we've got the
[1:14:39] earth your body is earth my body's earth
[1:14:42] the bright body and the earth the mother
[1:14:44] earth that is the second dimension and
[1:14:46] the third dimension is time that we live
[1:14:49] in we see the seasons we see a summer
[1:14:52] winter and all kind of seasons we rise
[1:14:54] up and wake up we look our time we
[1:14:57] time that is what the dimensions of the
[1:14:59] human flesh but then we go to a fourth
[1:15:01] dimension that is called communication
[1:15:04] science call it a radio waves look at
[1:15:07] the computers look at a microphone that
[1:15:09] is free assess dimension God uses it the
[1:15:13] devil uses it human being uses it amen
[1:15:16] God uses it to preach his word
[1:15:18] somebody's in club they're spending and
[1:15:20] doing stuff like that they are sending
[1:15:22] souls to heaven through the same fourth
[1:15:24] dimension then we have the fifth
[1:15:26] dimension which is what which is hell
[1:15:29] Satan demons where unbelievers draw
[1:15:32] people here drunk they don't have peace
[1:15:34] in their heart
[1:15:35] the devil is tormenting them but when
[1:15:37] I've delivered and what being set free
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:41] and we are working with our limitation
[1:15:43] amen we are working manifests in a Luke
[1:15:46] chapter 137 for with God nothing is
[1:15:49] impossible and with you nothing is
[1:15:52] impossible then we go to the two upper
[1:15:54] dimensions the six and the Seven
[1:15:56] dimension that is heaven and Christ
[1:16:00] Himself which is basically the same
[1:16:02] thing
[1:16:02] amen heaven is a new crisis in you amen
[1:16:06] crisis in you heaviness in you when I
[1:16:08] sit my brother
[1:16:09] I see Christ in you when I see my
[1:16:11] sisters I see Christ in them amen and
[1:16:14] that is the dimension that shipping our
[1:16:17] lives or the other dimension is for
[1:16:20] earthly manifestation but your true
[1:16:22] identity is the deity of Christ in you
[1:16:25] the love of Christ true contrasts the
[1:16:29] law committed sin in your way
[1:16:30] the Lord parameter some difficulties
[1:16:32] maybe some somebody's going through some
[1:16:34] challenges probably you've prayed you've
[1:16:36] been proved for but you're not see
[1:16:37] resort it's already been done
[1:16:39] amen time is no limitation glory
[1:16:43] hallelujah because you are part of
[1:16:45] Christ and Christ is in you so Christ
[1:16:48] know that you can bear you can hold on a
[1:16:50] little while so he permits some trials
[1:16:52] it doesn't take it away he wants he
[1:16:55] wanted to strengthen you he wanted tried
[1:16:57] to fall to mold you and shape you
[1:16:59] because what
[1:17:01] Atena manifestation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:04] and the more we are sensitive to the
[1:17:05] sixth and seventh dimension and that is
[1:17:07] our true you a
[1:17:09] man that is true me because this one has
[1:17:11] a limitation this one would bring down
[1:17:13] some D this one can get sick this one
[1:17:16] can feel discouraged but as Christ in
[1:17:19] you who has no discouragement one time
[1:17:23] David David had a battle to fight the
[1:17:27] Lord prepared him to kill a bear he
[1:17:30] could rely on and now he has to face a
[1:17:33] Goliath but before he could face Goliath
[1:17:35] he has to cross over Saul he also proved
[1:17:38] to saw that he was you'll be able to
[1:17:40] face Goliath so he has to give his
[1:17:42] testimony said so line seven has killed
[1:17:44] a bear when I had my my father's sheep I
[1:17:47] got a lion but when it came to Goliath
[1:17:50] he didn't talk about testimonies of
[1:17:52] killing bears and lion he chained a
[1:17:54] battle to his dates amen
[1:17:56] the virtue of Christ in him the kingdom
[1:17:58] of God is in you there might be certain
[1:18:01] challenges that this flesh cannot hold
[1:18:02] it this first second third dimension can
[1:18:06] avoid it you are limited but Christ in
[1:18:10] you has grown no limitation and you have
[1:18:13] to transfer the battle to the cry see
[1:18:15] you or to the Christ in your pasta or to
[1:18:18] the Christ in your sister as for praise
[1:18:20] amen let somebody speak the word let
[1:18:24] somebody pray for you let somebody read
[1:18:26] a Bible for you and I will change a
[1:18:28] situation amen
[1:18:29] so when David brother David got before
[1:18:32] Goliath he said in the name of the Lord
[1:18:34] of Hosts the lot of Israel whom you
[1:18:37] defile he is going to slaughter your
[1:18:38] head amen and we know the story so no
[1:18:42] matter what you are going through
[1:18:43] remember that you a deity and the love
[1:18:46] of Christ is you amen I'm just closing

[1:20:57] what a thought Jesus was the Good
[1:21:03] Samaritan that saw me in trouble my god
[1:21:07] I left Jerusalem and was on my way to
[1:21:10] Jericho

[1:22:26] to the other place he saw his sister
[1:22:28] here in the church and he looked at her

[1:26:31] in your
[1:26:35] yes Word of God speed amen
[1:26:43] resting in the holiness as the Word of
[1:26:46] God comes forth
[1:26:48] isn't that beautiful because God is holy
[1:26:54] and God is something we can someone we
[1:26:57] can rest in oh my my my Word of God
[1:27:01] speak tonight if you have your Bibles
[1:27:04] turn to Isaiah chapter 9 I just want to
[1:27:08] get right into the word and appreciate
[1:27:11] them
[1:27:11] musicians appreciate our brothers words
[1:27:14] and I echo brother Jack you some there
[1:27:18] are days when you are looking at the
[1:27:21] Word of God someone is looking at the
[1:27:23] Word of God and you begin to wonder have
[1:27:25] you ever even read that scripture before
[1:27:31] today was one of those days thought I
[1:27:39] knew that story like I said the other
[1:27:44] night you know we don't some sometimes
[1:27:46] there's such power and we leave some
[1:27:48] things you know we leave John 8 chapter
[1:27:51] 8 like we read last night we just leave
[1:27:53] that in Sunday school as a cute little
[1:27:55] verse but you know we we sometimes leave
[1:27:58] this this little passage this parable is
[1:28:01] a as a sunday-school story but it's then
[1:28:04] we find our life just totally in it oh
[1:28:08] no so we just recognize there's power in
[1:28:13] every single line of the Word of God so
[1:28:17] Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 2 the people
[1:28:23] that walked in darkness have seen a
[1:28:24] great light they that dwell in the land
[1:28:28] of the shadow of death upon them half
[1:28:31] the light shined
[1:28:33] if you turn with me to Matthew chapter 4
[1:28:35] in verse 16 Matthew writing about Jesus
[1:28:43] going to the land of Zebulun and
[1:28:46] Naphtali and these are the the outskirts
[1:28:49] of Israel and they were the the first
[1:28:53] place that was attacked was
[1:28:55] was Zebulun and Naphtali and and that
[1:28:58] that was the time they're in Isaiah's
[1:29:00] time were that that was the darkest
[1:29:02] place and Matthew chapter 4 verse 16 the
[1:29:08] people which sat in darkness saw a great
[1:29:11] light and to them which sat in the
[1:29:13] region and the shadow of death light is
[1:29:17] sprung up I also want one more scripture
[1:29:21] Romans chapter 11 and verse 25 in Romans
[1:29:33] chapter 11 and verse 25 I would not
[1:29:36] brethren that ye should be ignorant of
[1:29:37] this mystery lest she should be wise in
[1:29:40] your own conceits blindness in part is
[1:29:43] happened unto Israel until the fullness
[1:29:45] of the Gentiles be come in if we could
[1:29:50] bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[1:29:51] Heavenly Father Lord show us your light
[1:29:56] tonight Lord Jesus show us where we are
[1:29:59] at Lord God Lord I Lord as I was just
[1:30:06] praying in the back Lord I'm just a
[1:30:08] vessel tonight Lord I want nothing more
[1:30:10] than just to be used by you to speak
[1:30:11] your words Lord of myself Lord I want to
[1:30:16] be eloquent I want to be persuasive I
[1:30:18] want to be passionate but father
[1:30:20] that's nothing if the Spirit of God
[1:30:22] isn't here
[1:30:23] to quicken the word and to open the eyes
[1:30:27] and the heart the understanding Lord God
[1:30:31] so father we invite your presence
[1:30:34] amongst us we know you're here as you've
[1:30:36] promised in your word but Lord we just
[1:30:39] want to let you know that you're welcome
[1:30:40] and that we we adore you father and we
[1:30:46] are looking for you
[1:30:47] to come speak to our hearts now may we
[1:30:52] let go of every inhibition or God and
[1:30:55] just just bask in the holiness of the
[1:30:59] Word of God we ask you to the name of
[1:31:01] Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:19] so I want to speak to you as you can see
[1:31:25] here on the significance of the seven
[1:31:27] trumpets and if these slides end up
[1:31:30] being a bit too hard to see we may can
[1:31:33] we kill that right there fantastic I can
[1:31:36] pretty much preach it up in front here
[1:31:38] and the light may be a little bit and
[1:31:40] we'll just we'll get along fine this I
[1:31:43] don't remember what brother always says
[1:31:45] that but there's a brother it comes
[1:31:47] preaches and we're gonna do this and
[1:31:49] we'll just get along fine so that's the
[1:31:51] way it's gonna be so the significance in
[1:31:54] the seven trumpets and you say what
[1:31:55] brother Trevor the scripture that you
[1:31:57] read had nothing to do with the seven
[1:31:58] trumpets but what I want to bring to you
[1:32:00] tonight is that we could see the great
[1:32:03] symmetry in the Word of God that we
[1:32:06] could see how beautiful as I said Sunday
[1:32:09] morning that this Bible the author of
[1:32:12] this Bible is Almighty God and he is the
[1:32:15] greatest author that you know we we were
[1:32:19] sitting at lunch and we were discussing
[1:32:20] some different books sister Erica likes
[1:32:22] to read and we you know we're all we're
[1:32:24] home schoolers like she was and
[1:32:26] different things you know we have a lot
[1:32:27] in common and that we were discussing
[1:32:29] different books and things like that but
[1:32:31] you know and different authors that we
[1:32:33] enjoyed but but God is the great author
[1:32:36] I mean he is the author of authors and
[1:32:38] and what he can put in the Word of God
[1:32:40] you know we could we could read the Word
[1:32:43] of God for for for years and years and
[1:32:45] years and never see something in the
[1:32:48] Word of God now I had planned on saying
[1:32:50] that all along and then our brother gets
[1:32:53] up and just manifests the Word of God
[1:32:55] like that like all over us
[1:32:59] and there's no other book that can do
[1:33:03] that that you can read again and again
[1:33:07] and it actually gets more interesting
[1:33:09] the more you read it and so there's a
[1:33:13] great symmetry that God has placed
[1:33:15] within history and we see in the word
[1:33:18] where there was a there was a darkness
[1:33:20] going to come there was a blindness that
[1:33:23] was going to come in part to Israel
[1:33:26] until the fullness of the Gentiles would
[1:33:29] come in now so what's that saying is
[1:33:31] there was a time when the Israelites
[1:33:33] could see they knew who it was
[1:33:36] but there was a time that that blindness
[1:33:38] they were gonna become blind and there
[1:33:42] was gonna be a time when the Gentiles
[1:33:44] could now see so we have way of darkness
[1:33:47] and we have light my I don't I didn't
[1:33:49] plan that that would met you know mirror
[1:33:51] what we talked about last night but it
[1:33:53] sure kind of does so that the Israelites
[1:33:56] now they are in a period of darkness and
[1:33:58] there are a period of blindness but
[1:34:01] while they're there we used to be down
[1:34:04] here we used to be the ones that blind
[1:34:05] but now that light has come to us and
[1:34:08] it's now the time of the Gentiles and so
[1:34:12] there's now a time when you and I can
[1:34:14] see but now we listen to the scriptures
[1:34:17] words and it says until the fullness of
[1:34:20] the Gentiles be come in so we know
[1:34:25] there's a time then that that fullness
[1:34:27] will be over and when that happens we
[1:34:31] know that light will then return to
[1:34:34] Israel for a short time we know that
[1:34:37] we're going to take a rapture and that
[1:34:39] during that time Jesus is going to be
[1:34:41] revealing himself to the Brethren a type
[1:34:43] of Joseph we'll get into that just a
[1:34:45] little bit but but so what we're going
[1:34:47] to see is this great symmetry that that
[1:34:49] while the the Israelites can be in light
[1:35:01] we can see this beautiful symmetry that
[1:35:05] God lays in his word and that's what we
[1:35:08] want to talk about is where are we at
[1:35:10] today if this is our last service of
[1:35:13] 2018 and Jesus didn't come in 2018 we've
[1:35:17] got a little bit of time left but you
[1:35:19] know for us here in Eastern time zone
[1:35:21] you know but but we're looking for him
[1:35:24] then in 2019 aren't we but as we talked
[1:35:28] about Sunday morning you know we know
[1:35:30] this event is coming that event came for
[1:35:32] Mary that event is coming for you and I
[1:35:34] so how close is it now we we don't have
[1:35:37] to worry and obsess
[1:35:39] / well will it be next year will it be
[1:35:41] no now nineteen hundred and fifty four
[1:35:43] years - uh you know the square root of
[1:35:45] two and you know 2019
[1:35:49] you know June the ninth you know we
[1:35:53] don't have to do that but as we talked
[1:35:56] about Sunday Morris yeah they were
[1:35:57] Sunday morning you know within those
[1:35:58] three days the Bible gives us
[1:36:00] indications of what there will be so
[1:36:03] that we might know where we're at
[1:36:06] amen so the significance in the seventh
[1:36:09] trumpet specifically the Feast of the
[1:36:10] seven trumpets so we want to look at
[1:36:12] Leviticus chapter 23 here and Leviticus
[1:36:16] 23 the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:36:18] speak unto the children of Israel saying
[1:36:21] in the seventh month in the first day of
[1:36:23] the month shall you have a sabbath a
[1:36:24] memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy
[1:36:27] convocation now you forgive me I'm gonna
[1:36:31] go through this very rapidly I
[1:36:32] absolutely need your attention through
[1:36:34] this entire service or you will be lost
[1:36:36] and I realize this is probably you know
[1:36:40] it's after already after everyone's
[1:36:42] bedtime so this is the probably the
[1:36:43] worst service for me to ask for
[1:36:45] everyone's attention through the entire
[1:36:46] service but here we are so and I'm gonna
[1:36:52] go really fast so if you're if you if
[1:36:54] you get lost pretty jarred I don't get
[1:36:58] it and we'll try to figure it out so I'm
[1:37:01] gonna I'm gonna go fast so I want I want
[1:37:03] your attention now into the seventh
[1:37:05] month in the first day of the month show
[1:37:06] you have a Sabbath a memorial of a
[1:37:08] blowing of trumpets and holy convocation
[1:37:11] oh yeah I'm supposed to be clicking let
[1:37:17] me do that - is that gonna work
[1:37:19] nope oh I probably got to turn it off
[1:37:23] I'm a little it's okay so okay
[1:37:31] yeah you're gonna have to follow me
[1:37:33] maybe back there
[1:37:34] you shall do no servile work therein but
[1:37:38] you shall offer an offering made by fire
[1:37:40] unto the Lord and the Lord spake unto
[1:37:43] Moses saying also on the tenth day of
[1:37:46] this seventh month there shall be a day
[1:37:48] of atonement it shall it shall be a holy
[1:37:53] convocation unto you and you shall
[1:37:54] afflict your souls and offer an offering
[1:37:56] made by fire unto the Lord now now we've
[1:37:59] just talked about the Feast of the seven
[1:38:01] trumpets and we're now going to talk
[1:38:03] about the the Day of Atonement these we
[1:38:05] see these things in connection with each
[1:38:08] other
[1:38:09] here in the 23rd chapter of Leviticus
[1:38:11] now it shall be a holy convocation unto
[1:38:13] you ye shall afflict your souls and
[1:38:15] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[1:38:18] Lord verse 28 ye shall do no work in
[1:38:20] that same day for it is a day of
[1:38:22] atonement to make an atonement for you
[1:38:23] before the Lord your God 29 for
[1:38:26] whatsoever soul it be that shall not be
[1:38:28] afflicted in that same day he shall be
[1:38:30] cut off from among his people and
[1:38:32] whatsoever soul it be it be that do with
[1:38:35] any work in that same day the same soul
[1:38:38] will I destroy from among his people ye
[1:38:41] shall do no manner of work it shall be a
[1:38:43] statute forever throughout your
[1:38:44] generations in all your dwellings it
[1:38:47] shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest and
[1:38:49] you shall afflict your souls in the
[1:38:51] ninth day of the month that even from
[1:38:53] even unto even shall you celebrate your
[1:38:56] Sabbath okay so now brother Branham and
[1:39:01] I'm taking almost all of this from the
[1:39:02] message Feast of Trumpets and brother
[1:39:04] Branham what he's he's trying to show us
[1:39:07] something now if you remember some of
[1:39:08] the history what he's trying to tell
[1:39:11] what he's telling us is that he
[1:39:12] originally he wants to bring the seven
[1:39:15] trumpets and preach them you know just
[1:39:17] like he did the church ages are just
[1:39:19] like he did the seals he wants to take
[1:39:21] you know first trumpet first you know
[1:39:22] Monday night and two you know boom boom
[1:39:24] boom you know all week one a night and
[1:39:27] just go through this but they're having
[1:39:31] a hard time getting the place to rent it
[1:39:33] so they can have the big meeting and
[1:39:34] nothing seems to work out brother
[1:39:36] branham's like Lord what's going on here
[1:39:39] and the Lord tells them oh you this is
[1:39:41] you don't have to preach this this is to
[1:39:43] the Jews
[1:39:44] and that you super naturally I was
[1:39:47] getting there brother Jack that you
[1:39:48] super already supernaturally preached
[1:39:51] them in the sixth seal so brother
[1:39:55] branham is is trying to you know to make
[1:39:58] this all happen and that God shows him
[1:39:59] all of this and so he comes to the
[1:40:01] tabernacle on a Sunday morning and he
[1:40:03] preaches in 1/2 hours sermon the Feast
[1:40:05] of the seven trumpets and and most of us
[1:40:08] you know we listen to the Feast of the
[1:40:09] seven trumpets and we we know that
[1:40:12] brother okay he starts he tells us is to
[1:40:13] the Jews it's not really to us and then
[1:40:16] he makes a whole bunch of confusing
[1:40:17] statements to us and you know we take
[1:40:19] the tape out of our tape recorders and
[1:40:20] we put it back on the shelf and we go
[1:40:22] that was interesting and we never
[1:40:24] listened to that sermon again because we
[1:40:29] don't understand it and it's to the Jews
[1:40:31] anyway now what you see as he's
[1:40:36] preaching this he tells us there's
[1:40:39] something significant there so he wants
[1:40:42] to bring this significance out to us now
[1:40:46] so he comes and what he does is he takes
[1:40:50] the Leviticus chapter 16
[1:40:51] everybody say Leviticus 16 okay he takes
[1:40:55] Leviticus 16 which is the first mention
[1:40:57] of the Day of Atonement and this was
[1:40:59] after Aaron's sons had offered strange
[1:41:01] fire he's in and and now he's commanded
[1:41:05] to go in and this is that you know the
[1:41:07] Day of Atonement the high priest and the
[1:41:09] bells and he goes the one day a year he
[1:41:12] goes beyond the veil into the holiest of
[1:41:14] Holies to sprinkle the blood upon the
[1:41:16] altar they aren't supposed to work it's
[1:41:18] a it's a type it's a symbol that God is
[1:41:21] that's Jesus Christ is gonna die for you
[1:41:24] it's not your work and so the let's
[1:41:28] Leviticus 16 teaches us about what the
[1:41:31] priest was supposed to do now and then
[1:41:33] he contrast that with Leviticus 23 here
[1:41:36] of which we've just read where it places
[1:41:39] the seven trumpets this is the first
[1:41:41] mention in the Bible of the Feast of the
[1:41:43] seven trumpets and he places the Feast
[1:41:45] of the seven trumpets right in context
[1:41:48] with this this Day of Atonement and and
[1:41:51] and we begin to think okay you know when
[1:41:54] I first read this I think okay here's
[1:41:57] description of the Day of Atonement and
[1:41:59] in Leviticus 16 in Leviticus 23 which
[1:42:02] we've just read everybody say Leviticus
[1:42:04] 23 because you're staying with me right
[1:42:07] I'm forgive me I gotta I gotta get you
[1:42:10] information here that might be slightly
[1:42:13] boring so stay with me
[1:42:14] so Leviticus 23 now is the first mention
[1:42:17] of the Feast of the trumpets and and and
[1:42:20] he and it places us in context with the
[1:42:22] Day of Atonement and maybe what we would
[1:42:24] think is is okay Leviticus 16 describes
[1:42:27] the feast and Leviticus 23 tells us when
[1:42:31] it happens and how that all works but
[1:42:34] brother branham he comes there and he
[1:42:36] says now Leviticus 16 the killing of the
[1:42:40] sacrifice Leviticus 23 Day of Atonement
[1:42:45] you're afflicted you're mourning but did
[1:42:48] we read about a sacrifice when we read
[1:42:50] Leviticus 23 no we did not we did not
[1:42:54] read it we what we did read though was
[1:42:56] we read that the Feast of Trumpets would
[1:42:58] happen and then the day of atonement
[1:43:00] would happen and in that day of
[1:43:01] atonement
[1:43:02] you should have flicked your souls you
[1:43:04] should be sorrowful for what has gone on
[1:43:05] and what has taken place but there's no
[1:43:08] killing of a sacrifice in Leviticus 23
[1:43:11] but there is in Leviticus 16 you and I
[1:43:15] don't see anything there but a prophet
[1:43:17] comes along and he begins to make a
[1:43:19] distinction there and we can and we
[1:43:21] begin to we begin to look at that and
[1:43:23] and like our brother here just did you
[1:43:25] know we look at scripture oh that's a
[1:43:27] nice Sunday School story and we go ok
[1:43:29] this is you know and our brother comes
[1:43:31] here we go you know did I just become a
[1:43:35] Christian yesterday and so the prophets
[1:43:39] doing this kind of thing to us is he's
[1:43:41] beginning to distinguish the difference
[1:43:43] here and if we can see if we can sit
[1:43:45] there and follow his train of thought
[1:43:47] something very beautiful opens up before
[1:43:50] our eyes now so you say now brother
[1:43:53] Trevor you're talking about the
[1:43:54] significance of the seven trumpets but
[1:43:56] all we've done here now is talk about
[1:43:58] the Day of Atonement amen okay that's
[1:44:01] yeah that's by design so what is the
[1:44:04] Feast of Trumpets that's gonna make more
[1:44:07] sense don't worry
[1:44:08] what is the Feast of Trumpets now
[1:44:11] next please brother Branham says
[1:44:12] therefore when the trumpet sounds we see
[1:44:15] something in the earth today maybe I
[1:44:19] know ok we see something in the earth
[1:44:22] today there is a great trouble somewhere
[1:44:25] and everybody knows it now so the fees
[1:44:31] are these trumpets what are these
[1:44:32] trumpets doing these trumpets are
[1:44:36] denoting that there's trouble in the
[1:44:38] earth somewhere is there trouble in the
[1:44:42] earth anywhere today think there spend
[1:44:44] some trouble in the earth now the hidden
[1:44:47] brother branham continues the hidden
[1:44:48] mysteries of Christ was fully revealed
[1:44:50] in the seven seals it revealed first the
[1:44:53] seven church ages opened up the ages in
[1:44:56] place then positionally both with
[1:44:57] history and with the Bible set them in
[1:45:01] position how they was and what a
[1:45:04] reflection what a message from God
[1:45:05] Himself that these things are the truth
[1:45:08] he testified it first in his word then
[1:45:11] by his spirit at the platform and then
[1:45:14] declared it in the heavens now that you
[1:45:16] can see the slide here as you notice I'm
[1:45:18] reading a quote but I've kind of
[1:45:20] organized the quote and this is directly
[1:45:22] quoted but first he manifested in his
[1:45:25] word then by his spirit at the platform
[1:45:27] and then he declares it in the heavens
[1:45:30] now he continues on he says there is
[1:45:32] make no mistake about it at all those
[1:45:36] seals and ages are perfectly in line
[1:45:38] perfectly God giving witness by
[1:45:41] supernatural signs and wonders with the
[1:45:43] word and history all placed together in
[1:45:46] the age that we're now living in now
[1:45:49] this is very important we're going to
[1:45:51] see this and I'm going to give you a
[1:45:53] timeline and we're going to drop three
[1:45:55] things on top of this timeline we are
[1:45:57] going to first drop in the supernatural
[1:46:00] signs and wonders and the word and
[1:46:03] history and we're going to see that
[1:46:05] these three things are all placed
[1:46:08] together in the age that we're now
[1:46:11] living in which H is that let us see in
[1:46:15] church age okay room in which age is
[1:46:17] that the latest see in church ages which
[1:46:19] number the seventh okay that's very nice
[1:46:22] very nice good job very well done
[1:46:24] give yourself a hug okay next slide
[1:46:27] please my brother so I just want to
[1:46:29] throw this timeline out for you really
[1:46:31] quick this is the church ages we've got
[1:46:34] the the dates and everything that's just
[1:46:36] so you can recognize there's a real date
[1:46:38] and your your life is you know over here
[1:46:40] in late Asiya you know you know the
[1:46:42] church ages I don't want to spend too
[1:46:44] much time here but but how many church
[1:46:46] ages do we have here one two three four
[1:46:49] five six seven and then we have a
[1:46:51] millennium after a rapture and different
[1:46:53] things marriage supper tribulation
[1:46:56] things like that hey men were together
[1:46:57] right okay so we have seven ages and if
[1:47:02] you're unfamiliar with this this is
[1:47:03] revelations chapter 2 in revelations
[1:47:05] chapter three and and and so we we see
[1:47:09] now that we're in the seventh age and
[1:47:11] that God would send us just just as he
[1:47:14] did to every age he would send a message
[1:47:16] to an angel for that church and we live
[1:47:20] in that day of Revelations 314 and that
[1:47:24] that seventh angel would oh there would
[1:47:27] also be the voice of the seventh angel
[1:47:28] there'd be a days of the voice of the
[1:47:30] seventh angel of Revelations ten seven
[1:47:32] seventh angel of a seventh church age
[1:47:34] comes to a seventh angel in Revelations
[1:47:37] 10 seven and we begin to go oh I see it
[1:47:40] praise the Lord
[1:47:41] so all right and then we can kind of
[1:47:44] throw nextslide my brother to kind of
[1:47:46] slow this throw the seals overtop first
[1:47:48] seal second seal third seal fourth seal
[1:47:50] we won't dive into him too hard
[1:47:51] but if you've ever studied the seals and
[1:47:53] tried to throw them on a timeline and
[1:47:54] then you got to the fifth seal and you
[1:47:56] go huh how do I do that and there's a
[1:47:57] sixth seal in the seventh seal and you
[1:47:59] tried to throw that on the timeline and
[1:48:00] you go I don't get it it doesn't work
[1:48:02] for me my head's about to explode
[1:48:04] go to the end of the fourth seal and
[1:48:06] brother Branham says now these lasts
[1:48:08] these now this four seal is open and all
[1:48:10] of these these things have been
[1:48:11] happening on earth then tomorrow night
[1:48:13] we look in heaven at what's going on in
[1:48:15] heaven for the for the fifth seal so you
[1:48:18] see the view changes from 1st 2nd 3rd
[1:48:21] 4th seal these horse riders here on the
[1:48:23] earth now their souls under the altar
[1:48:24] now there's there's angels use me and
[1:48:28] now there's a great silence in heaven
[1:48:29] where are these things that are in
[1:48:30] heaven is there time in heaven not like
[1:48:35] here not like here
[1:48:38] so when you try to throw 5th 6th and 7th
[1:48:42] seal on a time line it doesn't work for
[1:48:44] you just doesn't work so I just saved
[1:48:48] your brain if you ever start to try to
[1:48:50] study that because it bothered me for
[1:48:51] years
[1:48:52] it drove me nuts I don't get it sister
[1:48:55] told me brother I just I just I don't
[1:48:57] understand it I just try to believe that
[1:48:59] nice that's nice sister I appreciate
[1:49:01] that but I'm actually gonna study this
[1:49:02] and try so and if I and if I if I blow a
[1:49:07] fuse then I'll just believe it anyway
[1:49:09] but I'm gonna at least try so and I say
[1:49:15] that you know so we begin to understand
[1:49:16] if brother Branham and will get into
[1:49:18] this if brother Branham preaches the the
[1:49:20] seven trumpets in the sixth seal and
[1:49:21] that some of that's already happened and
[1:49:23] we're waiting for the sixth seal to be
[1:49:25] the Tribulation Period and we and then
[1:49:27] you'd say like the last church I
[1:49:29] preached this in there like did brother
[1:49:30] Trevor say we were in the middle of the
[1:49:31] Tribulation Period already no that's not
[1:49:33] what I'm saying but you can't look at
[1:49:35] the sixth seal in this in the same time
[1:49:37] elements are there places where to pay
[1:49:40] impacts time yes but you can't look at
[1:49:43] it it's already going on we're just
[1:49:44] waiting on this the rapture waiting on
[1:49:46] the seventh seal all right so we don't
[1:49:49] have to worry about these other things
[1:49:50] now next slide so now I want to add into
[1:49:53] this I want to come back now to our
[1:49:55] Leviticus 23 this we call a we love
[1:49:58] feasts here and I know maybe you can't
[1:50:00] see it so great but this is 12 months of
[1:50:02] the year kind of in a circular pattern
[1:50:05] here the month of Nisan maybe you've
[1:50:07] heard of that with a month of Adar you
[1:50:09] probably read about that and Esther
[1:50:10] that's when Haman wanted to kill
[1:50:12] everybody and so you know we have six
[1:50:14] one two or three four or five six we
[1:50:16] come to the seventh month the in what
[1:50:18] our scriptures say the first day of the
[1:50:20] seventh month there be the Feast of
[1:50:22] Trumpets tenth day of the seventh month
[1:50:24] I love just being in the slide here it's
[1:50:26] great tenth day of the seventh month is
[1:50:28] the Day of Atonement it's so much better
[1:50:31] than going to see that way up there so
[1:50:33] so I can just come and bring you right
[1:50:35] to it so so the the the Feast of
[1:50:38] Trumpets there we read it begins on the
[1:50:41] first day of what month seventh month
[1:50:43] the Day of Atonement begins on the tenth
[1:50:45] day of the seventh month okay I just we
[1:50:50] just had to get there so now these are
[1:50:52] tight
[1:50:52] right I mean this is what the Old
[1:50:53] Testament is is there's types to us
[1:50:56] there in samples these lives were living
[1:50:59] out and they were going to to become a
[1:51:02] spiritual reality later on in our age
[1:51:06] now so we want to go back to our
[1:51:08] timeline thank you my brother we want to
[1:51:10] go back to our timeline and we're gonna
[1:51:14] know the next one sorry I said back but
[1:51:18] I didn't mean that for you okay
[1:51:19] so we want to come back to our timeline
[1:51:21] and we can understand that if it starts
[1:51:24] in the seventh month what is that a type
[1:51:26] of we have the first month second month
[1:51:28] third month fourth month fifth month six
[1:51:29] months seventh month that's our age this
[1:51:33] is a type of the Gentile ages that are
[1:51:37] to come that there would be seven ages
[1:51:40] now so for second third fourth fifth
[1:51:43] sixth seventh month so Amen praise Lord
[1:51:46] now what when did the Feast of Trumpets
[1:51:47] start first day of the seventh month are
[1:51:53] we together okay
[1:51:56] because Leviticus 16 was the killing of
[1:51:58] the sacrifice Leviticus 23 first day
[1:52:01] seventh month then a feast of then a
[1:52:03] feast of atonement tenth day of the
[1:52:06] seventh month I will have voice enough
[1:52:15] to finish this sermon so if you can go
[1:52:18] to the next slide now brother spread
[1:52:21] them says what is it trumpet for now a
[1:52:22] trumpet sounds and it says it'sit's a
[1:52:25] disturbance there's something wrong
[1:52:26] somewhere but what is it trumpet for a
[1:52:28] gathering together of the people now
[1:52:32] brother Branham says now the reason
[1:52:35] these seven trumpets does not apply to
[1:52:38] this church in this age is because it's
[1:52:41] to Israel only it's the calling of the
[1:52:44] gathering of the people and that's why
[1:52:46] he's saying look these seven trumpets
[1:52:48] they don't apply to us Gentiles they
[1:52:51] apply to the Jews it's a gathering
[1:52:54] together of the people amen so as we're
[1:53:00] talking about this this is why he's
[1:53:01] saying like look I wanted to do this
[1:53:03] every every night but then God and we
[1:53:06] just can
[1:53:06] then sit down to one sermon so brother
[1:53:08] Jack go to slides please and and we see
[1:53:11] what his brother branham say about the
[1:53:14] second trumpet in the message Feast of
[1:53:17] Trumpets does anybody know and except
[1:53:22] for the preacher's kid that's not fair
[1:53:26] you don't know you don't know because
[1:53:29] that's a trick question hit next please
[1:53:32] he says oh that that didn't work but
[1:53:35] that's okay we'll go to that slide he
[1:53:37] says absolutely nothing about the second
[1:53:38] the second trumpet and the message the
[1:53:40] seven trumpets he doesn't he just
[1:53:42] doesn't do that he doesn't do what he
[1:53:44] did with the churches and church ages
[1:53:46] and the seals what cuz that's to the
[1:53:48] Jews so he doesn't tell us anything
[1:53:50] about the second trumpet he doesn't tell
[1:53:52] us about the third trumpet but he says
[1:53:53] there's one thing significance in here
[1:53:56] that I want to get to you to get you to
[1:54:01] or however he says that I want you to
[1:54:06] get to I'm trying to say what he said
[1:54:10] yeah okay so let's go back to this we
[1:54:15] love feasts and when I say back from the
[1:54:17] jack I mean forward a slide and we get
[1:54:19] back to this we love feasts now we just
[1:54:23] heard what a trumpet is for right we
[1:54:25] have a feast of trumpets and every day
[1:54:28] there's gonna be a trumpet blown and
[1:54:31] what does that tres a trumpet blows what
[1:54:33] is that supposed to be doing gathering
[1:54:37] people together gathering people
[1:54:39] together now why should they be gathered
[1:54:41] together because of a Day of Atonement
[1:54:45] that's coming and that's why in
[1:54:48] Leviticus 23 we see them in the
[1:54:51] proximity to each other
[1:54:52] is because it's selling us there's got
[1:54:54] to be a Feast of Trumpets because
[1:54:56] there's a Day of Atonement that's coming
[1:54:58] there's got to be something that gathers
[1:55:01] the Jews together to get them to a place
[1:55:03] that they need to be for the feast of
[1:55:06] atonement so you can see that the Feast
[1:55:08] of Trumpets there is a there's a reason
[1:55:11] for that that reason is that it's the
[1:55:13] precursor to the Day of Atonement it's
[1:55:15] the gathering together now unfortunately
[1:55:18] as those
[1:55:19] pants are blown to gather those people
[1:55:21] together as a trumpet sounds there's
[1:55:23] great trouble in the earth somewhere and
[1:55:27] we look at how this happens now
[1:55:30] so why what is it then as we looked at
[1:55:33] 16 Leviticus 16 which was the killing of
[1:55:36] the sacrifice right we're together we're
[1:55:38] on the same page then we looked at
[1:55:39] Leviticus 23 no sacrifice just mourn for
[1:55:42] your sins afflict your souls and it's in
[1:55:45] proximity to the Day of Atonement so
[1:55:47] what is that is there there a difference
[1:55:49] then and we absolutely see in the
[1:55:52] scripture apps yes there's a difference
[1:55:54] what was the day of atonement that the
[1:55:57] reality the manifestation of the type of
[1:56:00] Liberty Leviticus 16 what was that the
[1:56:04] killing of the sacrifice
[1:56:11] this is Leviticus 16 manifested when
[1:56:14] Jesus died for you on I on the cross but
[1:56:18] then Leviticus 23 which happens after
[1:56:20] Leviticus 16 there's no killing of a
[1:56:24] sacrifice why sacrifice has already been
[1:56:26] killed remember this is a type these are
[1:56:29] samples to us God is laying these things
[1:56:33] down so that we can see and we can go
[1:56:36] god you're the author of authors and I'm
[1:56:41] just glad to be a part I'm glad my name
[1:56:44] was written in the book so then there's
[1:56:48] a Leviticus 23 Day of Atonement what is
[1:56:52] that what is that then that that that
[1:56:55] that feast is the one we're talking
[1:56:58] about of the Feast of Trumpets the Day
[1:57:00] of Atonement we're talking about
[1:57:01] Leviticus 23
[1:57:03] what is that day if we go to the next
[1:57:05] slide my brother Leviticus 23 atonement
[1:57:09] the mourning for sins Zechariah 12:10
[1:57:12] they shall look upon me whom they have
[1:57:15] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[1:57:17] one that mourneth for his only son and
[1:57:20] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[1:57:22] that is in bitterness for his firstborn
[1:57:24] next slide we read Zechariah 13 six one
[1:57:28] shall say unto thee one to him what are
[1:57:29] these wounds in nine hands then he shall
[1:57:31] answer those which I was wounded
[1:57:33] in the house of my friends what is this
[1:57:37] day this is the day after the rapture
[1:57:42] that Jesus comes back to the nation of
[1:57:45] Israel who were all saved in a day right
[1:57:48] so what the scripture says they'll be
[1:57:49] saved in a day so Jesus comes back and
[1:57:52] they say oh where did you get these
[1:57:54] wounds since I got them in the house of
[1:57:56] my friends so it's the day and guess
[1:57:59] what they're gonna be doing morning
[1:58:02] morning isn't that what we read can we
[1:58:04] go can we go back my brother they shall
[1:58:08] mourn for him as one morning for His
[1:58:12] only Son isn't that what they're
[1:58:15] supposed to be in the doing in the
[1:58:16] Leviticus 23 day of atonement
[1:58:18] mourning afflicting their souls they've
[1:58:20] done something wrong so here we are
[1:58:23] Zechariah 12 and Zechariah 13 Jesus
[1:58:26] coming back to the nation of Israel and
[1:58:30] guess what they all got to be there
[1:58:34] together they all got to be there
[1:58:37] together for him to show himself to them
[1:58:40] god only blesses Israel when they're in
[1:58:43] the land that God promised to Abraham
[1:58:47] that's why these men say carry my bones
[1:58:49] don't bury me here bury me in Palestine
[1:58:51] they need to be in the land and if
[1:58:56] they're gonna have to be in the land
[1:58:57] something's got to get them there what
[1:59:00] is that thing that gets them there the
[1:59:02] Feast of Trumpets calling the Jews let's
[1:59:06] go get back into your homeland amen
[1:59:08] so now we we understand this in type go
[1:59:11] to brother we understand this in type
[1:59:14] why why they miss him who was this what
[1:59:16] is this a type of this is a type of
[1:59:18] Joseph making himself known to his
[1:59:20] brethren amen so we I think you're
[1:59:23] familiar with that we won't stay there
[1:59:25] very long because we understand that
[1:59:27] this is the type of Jesus his brothers
[1:59:29] sell him into slavery Jesus's own
[1:59:34] brothers the Israelites sell him to die
[1:59:37] on a cross and then but it was what for
[1:59:41] the saving of life because Joseph goes
[1:59:43] he gets a Gentile bride amen praise God
[1:59:45] that's us
[1:59:46] Gentile bride Joseph gets a Gentile
[1:59:48] bride she's now in the palace and then
[1:59:51] he reveals himself to his brothers who
[1:59:53] come and repent for what they have done
[1:59:56] right
[1:59:57] this is Scripture and type being
[2:00:00] fulfilled before us and we're a part of
[2:00:03] this and so we begin to see this then
[2:00:06] this great unfolding of the Word of God
[2:00:10] of the author of authors and so when we
[2:00:14] go to the next slide so that I can
[2:00:15] remind you there's something significant
[2:00:17] here that I want you to get to now we're
[2:00:22] talking about the seven trumpets so
[2:00:24] really quickly I don't need you to go
[2:00:26] there but this will be revelations 8 and
[2:00:28] 9 we want to talk about the first
[2:00:29] trumpet hit me to the next slide brother
[2:00:31] Jack and we're gonna go through these
[2:00:33] next pretty rapidly so what was the
[2:00:35] first trumpet hail and fire mingled with
[2:00:37] blood a third part of the trees burnt
[2:00:39] and the green grass burnt second trumpet
[2:00:42] we'll read an eight eight nine mountain
[2:00:44] burning with fire cast into the sea
[2:00:46] third part of the sea became blood third
[2:00:48] part of the sea life died third part of
[2:00:50] the ships destroyed third trumpet
[2:00:51] burning star fell its name was wormwood
[2:00:54] it fell in rivers mountains at third
[2:00:56] part of the waters became wormwood and
[2:00:57] many men died because of the bitter
[2:00:59] waters the fourth trumpet of Revelations
[2:01:01] eight 12 and 13 a third part of the Sun
[2:01:03] smitten the moon the stars we go to the
[2:01:06] fifth trumpet starting in Revelations 9
[2:01:08] a star fell with key to the bottomless
[2:01:10] pit locusts came out with hair like
[2:01:12] women and teeth like lion's tails like
[2:01:14] scorpions that's a scary thought locusts
[2:01:16] killed men 5 months they will want to
[2:01:18] die and power to hurt those that aren't
[2:01:20] sealed so fifth trumpet sixth trumpet
[2:01:22] and you say brother chevre what are we
[2:01:24] doing we're just we're just really quick
[2:01:26] going through this we can see all of
[2:01:28] these calamities happening okay that
[2:01:30] that's what these trumpets are because
[2:01:32] when a trumpet sounds what is that great
[2:01:33] trouble in the world somewhere right
[2:01:36] okay so six trumpet four angels are
[2:01:39] loosed from the river Euphrates prepared
[2:01:41] to slay a third part of the men and two
[2:01:43] hundred thousand thousand horsemen come
[2:01:45] out of the great river Euphrates and go
[2:01:48] to make war now seventh trumpet skips
[2:01:52] over into revelations chapter 11 it
[2:01:54] finishes sixth trumpet finishes
[2:01:55] revelations nine the seventh trumpet is
[2:01:58] over in Revelations 11:15 through 19
[2:02:00] great voices in heaven twenty-four
[2:02:02] elders worship lightnings voices
[2:02:04] thunderings earthquake and great hail so
[2:02:07] the next slide have we seen any of these
[2:02:09] trumpets have we seen the manifestation
[2:02:12] of any of these things in Revelations 8
[2:02:15] 9 and 11
[2:02:16] have we seen them ask yourself have we
[2:02:18] seen have you looked outside and seen
[2:02:20] you know a third of the grass burnt or a
[2:02:22] third of the sea dead or I mean a third
[2:02:24] of the Sun Moon stars gone a third of
[2:02:27] the men dead you'd think we'd hear about
[2:02:30] that
[2:02:31] you know newspaper maybe would carry
[2:02:34] that story a third of the men have died
[2:02:38] so has that happened has that happened
[2:02:42] have we seen these things we've seen the
[2:02:44] sixth trumpet we've seen the four angels
[2:02:47] loosed from the review fray T's prepared
[2:02:49] to slay a third part of the men and two
[2:02:51] hundred thousand thousand horsemen go to
[2:02:54] slides my brother 6th trumpet we've seen
[2:02:58] the Holocaust which killed approximately
[2:03:00] 1/3 of the Jews of the world what were
[2:03:05] the trumpets - who are they - there were
[2:03:08] two the Jews when a trumpet sounds what
[2:03:11] happens great trouble in the world
[2:03:13] somewhere and when a trumpet sounds of
[2:03:15] the Feast of Trumpets what's it do
[2:03:17] what's the purpose of it to gather the
[2:03:19] Jews together to the homeland so we see
[2:03:23] in Scripture oh praise God we see in
[2:03:26] Scripture that there's going to be a six
[2:03:28] trumpet that's to come where a third of
[2:03:31] the men are supposed to be killed by
[2:03:35] these four kings that come out of the
[2:03:38] review freddie's and 200 thousand
[2:03:39] thousand horsemen come out and make war
[2:03:42] and push them back into their homeland
[2:03:44] so the scripture is telling us about
[2:03:47] these things and then we can go back in
[2:03:49] history and we can see hmm there was
[2:03:50] this thing known as the Holocaust and
[2:03:52] there was you know somewheres around 18
[2:03:54] million Jews around that time and then
[2:03:56] six million of them died we did read
[2:04:01] about it in the newspapers amen
[2:04:06] we have seen the sixth trumpet and and
[2:04:10] if the six if the trumpets are supposed
[2:04:12] to be calling the Jews into their
[2:04:14] homeland for that Day of Atonement which
[2:04:17] we know is a future date to come and we
[2:04:19] know it's not too far away and we can
[2:04:21] understand then we can see wow the sixth
[2:04:25] trumpet has happens and maybe we didn't
[2:04:30] even know it and we were sitting here
[2:04:32] thinking wow
[2:04:33] revelations eight revelations nine yeah
[2:04:35] I'm Tribulation Period wait you know
[2:04:38] that's future all that stuff's gonna
[2:04:40] happen if we don't recognize sometimes
[2:04:42] we don't recognize that about 95% of
[2:04:44] revelations is already fulfilled it's
[2:04:48] already done we literally are standing
[2:04:51] on the precipice of history
[2:04:53] it's about all over now if we can just
[2:04:57] go to slides so if you remember we we go
[2:05:01] back now brother Branham said now we're
[2:05:03] gonna put the the the word supernatural
[2:05:07] signs and wonders and history in the age
[2:05:10] that we're now living in now the Feast
[2:05:12] of Trumpets started on what it is almost
[2:05:18] midnight
[2:05:18] yes yes the first day of the seventh
[2:05:22] month so in my timeline here now I've
[2:05:24] dropped out six months and we just have
[2:05:27] the seventh month this is us this is the
[2:05:29] latest Ian period starting in 1906 1903
[2:05:33] 1933 is the start of the Holocaust don't
[2:05:36] believe me you can ask Google sometimes
[2:05:38] it'll tell you 1941 is the first day
[2:05:40] sometimes it'll tell you 1933 hey Google
[2:05:44] when did the Holocaust start there I
[2:05:46] looked it up for you now so but 1933 was
[2:05:52] the date that his littler becomes
[2:05:53] Chancellor of Germany and the the
[2:05:56] persecutions begin to start for the Jews
[2:05:59] in 1933 so so you know just as we talked
[2:06:03] about Joseph's brothers last night they
[2:06:05] didn't wake up one day and say hey let's
[2:06:07] kill Joseph you know the Germans didn't
[2:06:09] wake up and go hey let's throw a bunch
[2:06:11] of six million Jews into death camps
[2:06:13] cool great gather them up no but it
[2:06:16] starts in 1933 as a process
[2:06:20] okay so if the Holocaust is which just
[2:06:24] fits in history is is a third of the men
[2:06:27] dying and so we can see this is very
[2:06:28] plain is 1933 to 1945 and we know that
[2:06:32] the Feast of Trumpets starts on the
[2:06:34] first day of the seventh month and the
[2:06:38] sixth trumpet started in 1933 and went
[2:06:42] on the 1945 the end of World War two
[2:06:44] where are we at in history where are we
[2:06:48] at in history because there's only seven
[2:06:51] trumpets that happened before Jesus
[2:06:53] comes and reveals himself to the Jews so
[2:06:57] where are we at in history now we can
[2:06:59] begin to see then as we said there's
[2:07:00] going to be supernatural signs and
[2:07:02] wonders which is gonna be here and I
[2:07:03] haven't thrown those up here yet we're
[2:07:04] gonna have the word revelations 8 9
[2:07:07] which is this which is our six trumpets
[2:07:09] we're gonna have history so we see
[2:07:11] history we see a Holocaust we see the
[2:07:13] word revelations 8 and 9 revelations 9
[2:07:15] the end of it is the sixth trumpet am I
[2:07:18] going too fast anybody confused no good
[2:07:20] we got visuals so I'm hoping that's
[2:07:22] helping so next we add on May 7 1946
[2:07:30] does anybody know what that date is this
[2:07:33] is when the Jews become a nation now you
[2:07:36] could argue with me and say now brother
[2:07:38] Trevor we know that the UN recognized
[2:07:39] Israel as a nation in 1948 but I would
[2:07:42] submit to you what has to happen before
[2:07:44] the UN recognizes you as a nation you
[2:07:49] you kind of have to go to the UN and say
[2:07:50] hey UN we're a nation recognize us
[2:07:56] and that happens in May 7th 1946 well
[2:08:01] and then we know that because brother
[2:08:02] Branham told us so now let's go to the
[2:08:07] next slide here so Israel becomes a
[2:08:11] nation we establish that we can go one
[2:08:13] more so oh my now we begin to see some
[2:08:18] supernatural signs and wonders happening
[2:08:22] remember we were gonna have the word we
[2:08:23] were gonna have history and we would
[2:08:25] have supernatural signs and wonders all
[2:08:27] in the age that we're now living in ok
[2:08:31] that's where we are
[2:08:32] praise God
[2:08:33] so 1933 isn't that an interesting date
[2:08:36] for the start of the Holocaust 1930 you
[2:08:38] know something happened in 1930 what was
[2:08:41] that thing that happened in 1933 there
[2:08:43] was supernatural sign of wonder that's
[2:08:45] right
[2:08:46] as brother branham's baptizing this
[2:08:49] pillar fire comes down this this this
[2:08:51] this whirlwind comes down and speaks and
[2:08:53] says this john the baptist was sent to
[2:08:54] forerun the first coming of christ so
[2:08:56] will your message for run the second
[2:08:58] coming of Christ and where you go oh wow
[2:09:00] maybe that's pretty obvious to us when
[2:09:03] it really comes right down to it because
[2:09:04] if we're talking about the seven
[2:09:06] trumpets that are kinda that are gonna
[2:09:08] be what calls the Israel so that Jesus
[2:09:11] the Messiah can come and reveal himself
[2:09:14] to his brethren
[2:09:15] you know the second coming of the
[2:09:17] Messiah you know we would think that hmm
[2:09:19] you know if the first coming had a
[2:09:21] forerunner shouldn't the second coming
[2:09:27] amen so that kind of fits you know that
[2:09:31] somewheres around the same time that
[2:09:33] these trumpets are being blown there's a
[2:09:35] forerunner coming to announce the coming
[2:09:38] of a messiah Oh glory to God I love it
[2:09:41] the author of author so then my brother
[2:09:44] branham's Commission you know may 7th
[2:09:46] 1946 that was an interesting day cuz
[2:09:48] that's the same day brother branham's in
[2:09:49] a cave and we can you know we can we can
[2:09:52] say okay maybe next slide brother we can
[2:09:54] maybe we would stop and think what does
[2:09:56] brother branham's Commission have to do
[2:09:58] with this why is that on the same exact
[2:10:00] day that Israel becomes a nation so then
[2:10:06] we go to the next slide and the next
[2:10:07] three as we read this quote now to see
[2:10:09] whether this message we got is connected
[2:10:11] with it or not the very hour Israel was
[2:10:15] signed in to be a nation it was the same
[2:10:16] very same hour very same day very same
[2:10:18] month everything else I was at greens
[2:10:20] Mill do not blow up on me thank you I
[2:10:24] was at greens Mill Indiana when that
[2:10:27] angel there appeared to me and sent me
[2:10:28] out in the field with this after he had
[2:10:30] met me down on the river and told me
[2:10:32] what would take place then commissioned
[2:10:34] me 11 years later at the same hour that
[2:10:36] Israel was signed in a nation it's all
[2:10:39] connected together so brother Branham
[2:10:42] here is making a very very very bold
[2:10:44] statement you see
[2:10:47] there's only two possibilities here you
[2:10:50] know because if I came to you and I said
[2:10:52] you know God gave me a commission the
[2:10:55] same day Israel became a nation
[2:10:57] what would you say don't think much of
[2:11:02] yourself do you brother Trevor right I
[2:11:07] wait together are we asleep okay you
[2:11:10] know okay
[2:11:11] good cuz cuz I this is what I would
[2:11:12] think you know brother you come to me
[2:11:14] and say you know brother I was praying
[2:11:15] in a cave the very same day that that
[2:11:17] that God that God made his real a nation
[2:11:19] I'd be like that's nice brother he's
[2:11:21] praise God that's that's good that's
[2:11:24] good
[2:11:24] there's only two possibilities he's
[2:11:26] either arrogant and prideful or he's
[2:11:30] true you know it's kind of like God when
[2:11:32] he says in and and I think it's either
[2:11:35] mica or Malachi he says I am the great
[2:11:37] king well that's either arrogance or
[2:11:40] truth that's that's really the only two
[2:11:43] options so brother branham's making a
[2:11:44] very bold statement here and he's saying
[2:11:46] basically my ministry is connected with
[2:11:50] the Jews becoming a nation that's a bold
[2:11:52] statement does he and so let's let's
[2:11:54] look now that this does he does he have
[2:11:56] reason to say that now we've already
[2:11:59] looked at we know that the first coming
[2:12:02] of Christ had a forerunner in the second
[2:12:04] coming of Christ should also have a
[2:12:05] forerunner because God has this
[2:12:06] beautiful symmetry and so let's let's
[2:12:09] look then and we just hold that thought
[2:12:12] and we'll look at these things now let's
[2:12:15] go back and look at what's going on in
[2:12:17] the sixth trumpet brother Jack for the
[2:12:18] next next couple slides here and the
[2:12:20] sixth angel sounded verse thirteen and I
[2:12:22] heard a voice from the four horns of the
[2:12:24] golden altar which is before God saying
[2:12:26] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[2:12:27] loose the four angels which are bound in
[2:12:30] the great river Euphrates and the four
[2:12:32] angels were loosed which were prepared
[2:12:33] prepared for an hour and a day in a
[2:12:35] month and a year for to slay the third
[2:12:37] part of men and the number of the army
[2:12:39] of the horsemen were two hundred
[2:12:41] thousand thousand and I heard the number
[2:12:43] of them now there were four angels
[2:12:44] loosed I don't know where you're at
[2:12:47] brother but there you go okay there were
[2:12:50] four angels loosed and to slay a third
[2:12:53] part of the men now very interesting
[2:12:55] just just an anecdote and I don't make a
[2:12:57] doctrine out of this but I just can't I
[2:12:59] just can't unsee this
[2:13:00] any Morris you know when brother branham
[2:13:02] and this is another thing that used to
[2:13:03] confuse me when I was younger and whose
[2:13:06] Eichmann you know brother Brown would
[2:13:08] talk about Hitler Eichmann Mussolini or
[2:13:11] he'd say Hitler Eichmann Stalin you know
[2:13:14] it's just like who in the world is
[2:13:16] Eichmann Adolf Eichmann EEI ch ma NN if
[2:13:21] you want to look him up in history he is
[2:13:23] the man who proposed the final solution
[2:13:26] for the extermination of the Jews and
[2:13:27] the Wannsee conference in 1941 I believe
[2:13:32] it was sister Erica's nodding so that
[2:13:35] must be right so we had we had dictators
[2:13:42] right because these guys were were these
[2:13:46] that there's four of them here there's
[2:13:48] four four kings when we know there was
[2:13:50] three dictators during the World War two
[2:13:52] we know there's Stalin that was
[2:13:54] Mussolini and that was Hitler and it's
[2:13:57] just so interesting that brother branham
[2:13:59] always just throws Eichmann in there I
[2:14:03] don't know I just I just can't unsee
[2:14:07] that anymore
[2:14:08] because these four kings come out and
[2:14:10] then they have an army the number of the
[2:14:11] army of the horsemen were two hundred
[2:14:13] thousand thousand and these shorter
[2:14:14] thousand thousand what do they do they
[2:14:16] go 1/8 they slay a third part of the men
[2:14:22] to make sense so let's go to the next
[2:14:26] slide and let's look at our our timeline
[2:14:27] so we can see this is what's going on we
[2:14:30] see that Holocaust happening we see that
[2:14:32] these angels these four these four
[2:14:35] dictators these four kings have come out
[2:14:38] and and they've got an army of 200
[2:14:40] thousand thousand horsemen and we
[2:14:41] understand this isn't horseman you know
[2:14:44] I mean it's two thousand eighteen people
[2:14:46] you know you don't see two hundred
[2:14:47] thousand thousand that's two million or
[2:14:49] whatever number you can come up with
[2:14:50] however that works out you know but can
[2:14:52] you imagine seeing two million horsemen
[2:14:54] you know and by the way if you continue
[2:14:56] on they they look weird too it's like
[2:14:58] obviously these aren't men they have
[2:15:00] tails and different things so why
[2:15:02] because in Revelations it's word
[2:15:03] pictures its symbols so we have a symbol
[2:15:08] here that they're horsemen what are
[2:15:10] these horsemen they're demons
[2:15:12] two million demons loosed out of the
[2:15:15] river euphrates and how do you know it's
[2:15:16] demons brother Trevor well they killed a
[2:15:18] third of the men of the earth who do you
[2:15:21] think is gonna do that shoot him with
[2:15:24] bullets till the bullets run out pump
[2:15:27] air into their veins and kill them with
[2:15:30] gas demons do that demons of the four
[2:15:36] kings do that that were loosed out of
[2:15:38] the river Euphrates at the sounding of
[2:15:40] the sixth trumpet because and guess what
[2:15:43] when the sixth trumpet sounded that was
[2:15:44] a great trouble in the earth somewhere
[2:15:47] and what did that Holocaust do that that
[2:15:50] Holocaust that was that sounding of the
[2:15:52] sixth trumpet that was a trumpet blast
[2:15:55] saying Jews gather together because the
[2:15:58] day of atonement is coming and suddenly
[2:16:01] they get the picture they go back to
[2:16:04] Israel and they become a nation I mean
[2:16:11] or I'm crazy one of the two but it it it
[2:16:17] becomes pretty plain doesn't it it's all
[2:16:19] makes pretty good sense doesn't it now
[2:16:24] we're talking about brother branham's
[2:16:27] makes this statement that he combines
[2:16:28] these two things Israel becoming a
[2:16:30] nation and his ministry and we said
[2:16:33] that's a pretty bold statement and why
[2:16:35] does he get to make that statement and
[2:16:36] who does he think he is and and and is
[2:16:39] this really true and and then we're also
[2:16:42] adding okay we had these demons they
[2:16:44] were loose two hundred thousand thousand
[2:16:45] demons they're loose another of
[2:16:47] Euphrates they kill a third of the men
[2:16:49] and then it comes the end of the war
[2:16:51] they become a nation there's still two
[2:16:53] hundred thousand thousand demons loosed
[2:16:55] out of the river Euphrates there in the
[2:16:57] earth but now they're done they're done
[2:17:02] Holocaust
[2:17:03] so to speak you know where'd they go
[2:17:11] what are they doing now you know if
[2:17:13] there was two million demons in the
[2:17:15] earth still don't you think they'd be
[2:17:16] still doing something but the the
[2:17:19] trumpet done blow today it's over so
[2:17:21] that they're not killing Jews anymore
[2:17:23] because it they did what they were
[2:17:25] supposed to do but did they vanish did
[2:17:29] they disappear did they get trapped back
[2:17:33] into the river euphrates no they didn't
[2:17:36] get trapped back in the river euphrates
[2:17:37] we're gonna look at just a little bit
[2:17:38] that river euphrates gonna dry up but
[2:17:42] we'll get there so brother branham gets
[2:17:44] to make where we're looking for these
[2:17:46] demons we're looking for while brother
[2:17:47] Branham gets to make this statement
[2:17:49] right here at night about 1946 and wait
[2:17:53] a second we've got the word and we come
[2:17:57] to revelations 10 we finish with our six
[2:18:00] trumpets and we come to revelations 10
[2:18:03] and see what happened is John the
[2:18:04] Revelator you know he was writing about
[2:18:06] these trumpets and then he saw squirrel
[2:18:08] over here and he says oh look what
[2:18:09] happened over here let's write about
[2:18:11] that and then he comes to the eleventh
[2:18:12] chapter and he goes oh yeah I was
[2:18:14] writing about the seven trumpets and I'm
[2:18:15] gonna finish it up over here is that
[2:18:19] what you think happened that sounded
[2:18:21] pretty ridiculous when I said it yep so
[2:18:23] revelations 8 and 9 finish up the six
[2:18:26] trumpets and the next thing that happens
[2:18:27] is revelations 10 then Heather Lord
[2:18:29] Himself was closed with the cloud
[2:18:33] because brother branham's commissioned
[2:18:35] and finished the sixth trumpet finishes
[2:18:40] and the next thing we see happen in the
[2:18:43] word the next supernatural sign we see
[2:18:45] is him coming clothed with a cloud of
[2:18:49] revelations 10 and verse 1 and we see Oh
[2:18:53] revelations 10 verse 7 that in the days
[2:18:56] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[2:18:57] he shall begin to sound the mysteries of
[2:18:59] God would be finished and it's because
[2:19:01] of that that I can even preach what I'm
[2:19:03] talking about right now
[2:19:04] so in 1963 we see a fulfillment of
[2:19:06] Revelations 10 in the gap between the
[2:19:11] sixth and the seventh trumpet see God
[2:19:14] wrote that in there for a purpose God
[2:19:17] put a gap between the sixth seal and the
[2:19:20] seventh seal go to the next slide my
[2:19:22] brother he puts a gap between the sixth
[2:19:24] seal
[2:19:24] on the seventh seal the sixth incentive
[2:19:26] the sixth seal ends in revelations
[2:19:28] chapter six the seventh seal starts
[2:19:30] revelations chapter eight what happens
[2:19:31] in revelations chapter seven the sealing
[2:19:34] World War one all kinds of different
[2:19:36] things there why God holding back the
[2:19:39] four winds because it's not time yet
[2:19:41] there's a gap for a reason so we come to
[2:19:44] a gap between the sixth and seventh seal
[2:19:46] we see now a gap between the sixth and
[2:19:47] the seventh trumpet we see a gap between
[2:19:49] the sixth and the seventh vial and you
[2:19:51] say brother Trevor where'd the vials
[2:19:53] come from are you kidding me it's
[2:19:54] already 2:00 to midnight and now we got
[2:19:57] to talk about vials really quickly
[2:19:58] please
[2:19:59] will that be all right okay because I
[2:20:05] think this is fascinating
[2:20:06] so okay so maybe the next slide my
[2:20:09] brother so we can see now there's a gap
[2:20:10] we can see now we're living in that gap
[2:20:13] that that sixth seal has already
[2:20:15] happened we now exist in time in the gap
[2:20:19] that is revelations 10 we also can see
[2:20:21] then all of these things manifest it we
[2:20:24] see that these these mysteries that were
[2:20:26] always hid are now revealed to us and so
[2:20:30] we're we're living in this day it makes
[2:20:32] sense with the scripture it makes sense
[2:20:36] in history it makes sense with the
[2:20:39] supernatural signs and wonders so then
[2:20:42] we look at a gap between the six to the
[2:20:43] seventh file and you say okay what are
[2:20:45] those vials so we want to begin to
[2:20:47] contrast the gap between the sixth and
[2:20:50] the seventh trumpet and we want to look
[2:20:51] at the gap between the sixth and the
[2:20:53] seventh files now don't forget here
[2:20:57] networked we're talking what are we
[2:20:59] talking about what we start with that
[2:21:02] there's a fullness of the Gentiles
[2:21:03] coming there's a fullness of the
[2:21:06] Gentiles coming the juice the juice they
[2:21:09] had light they could see but then they
[2:21:13] became blind the Gentiles were blind
[2:21:17] then they could see but then as history
[2:21:20] went on there's coming a time of a
[2:21:22] fullness of a Gentiles there going those
[2:21:24] Gentiles are going to be blinded again
[2:21:26] and the Jews are going to receive light
[2:21:30] amen is that the scripture
[2:21:35] okay so we look at the next slide
[2:21:37] brother branham speaking here he says
[2:21:39] now under the sixth trumpet the
[2:21:41] Pentecostals reject the Bible the
[2:21:43] lukewarm not only the Pentecostals all
[2:21:45] the rest the church world rejects Christ
[2:21:47] and he has put on the outside where's
[2:21:54] this come from how does he know this
[2:21:57] who's preaching revelations three that
[2:22:05] just hurt it just came to me straight
[2:22:08] from the throne revelation 3:14 Jesus is
[2:22:13] on the outside of his own charge
[2:22:15] knocking say hey I'm out here this makes
[2:22:19] sense to us it makes sense to us because
[2:22:23] we understand the fullness of the
[2:22:26] Gentiles have got to come in it makes
[2:22:28] sense to us because we understand guess
[2:22:30] who who was the ones that were blinded
[2:22:33] in the days of Jesus in the first coming
[2:22:36] of the Messiah and those Jews where they
[2:22:40] just kind of out there religiously
[2:22:42] speaking I mean that were they just like
[2:22:44] the farthest thing away from the truth
[2:22:46] ever I mean the Greeks they probably
[2:22:49] kind of had it right or maybe the Romans
[2:22:52] and Jupiter and Mars and you know all
[2:22:55] their gods like they were they were kind
[2:22:56] of closer right no the Jews were the
[2:22:59] closest thing to true Christianity to
[2:23:03] true religion from Jehovah God Himself
[2:23:06] the Almighty the Jews were the closest
[2:23:09] thing to that religion and they were the
[2:23:11] ones who were blinded so in our age in
[2:23:19] the great symmetry that the author of
[2:23:21] authors has written down what would we
[2:23:24] expect and by the way he's pushed out of
[2:23:27] his own church there in revelations
[2:23:29] chapter three axis okay these things
[2:23:36] make sense praise the Lord now the same
[2:23:40] trumpet same seal rather when it was
[2:23:41] open to show Jesus on the outside of the
[2:23:43] church trying to get back in at the same
[2:23:45] time the trumpet sound for the Jews the
[2:23:47] Jews recognized the atonement glory how
[2:23:48] oh my so the Holy Spirit has been bound
[2:23:54] by these denominational rivers for
[2:23:56] almost two thousand years but has to be
[2:23:57] loosed in the evening time by the
[2:23:58] evening time messenger the Holy Spirit
[2:24:01] back in the church again Christ himself
[2:24:03] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[2:24:05] time he said he promised it so the the
[2:24:09] Holy Spirit had been bound these demons
[2:24:13] had been bound but they were what by
[2:24:17] denominational rivers is what brother
[2:24:19] Branham says what were these demons
[2:24:20] bound these two hunters these thousand
[2:24:21] thousand demons bound
[2:24:22] what were they bound by you writ
[2:24:24] Euphrates River show me a river that
[2:24:26] actually does a good job at binding
[2:24:28] anything
[2:24:28] don't forget revelations is a book of
[2:24:31] symbols that a prophet can come and
[2:24:33] reveal it to us and show us what these
[2:24:35] symbols mean so it's not an actual River
[2:24:38] now so we come back to our timeline very
[2:24:41] quickly and we're gonna add in a gentile
[2:24:44] blinding we know that the gentiles
[2:24:46] before Leviticus 23 can happen before
[2:24:49] this Day of Atonement can happen the
[2:24:51] Gentile church will be blind there will
[2:24:55] be a church that has raptured there will
[2:24:57] be a remnant a false virgin she's virgin
[2:25:00] she's clean she's virtuous she's good
[2:25:02] but she lacks the Holy Ghost but she's
[2:25:05] going through a tribulation period and
[2:25:07] during that time Jesus is making himself
[2:25:09] known Leviticus 23 zechariah 12
[2:25:12] Zechariah 13 he's making himself known
[2:25:14] to his brethren why because the trumpets
[2:25:16] blew and gathered Israel back to her
[2:25:19] homeland so we understand that the
[2:25:22] Gentiles in this time period it's
[2:25:24] closing right they're gonna be blind
[2:25:27] before this happens so wait wait wait
[2:25:29] it's not gonna happen in one day but
[2:25:31] it's it's coming it's it's in the
[2:25:33] process so now we can go to the next one
[2:25:37] and well we'll we just read you know
[2:25:39] because they'll say us time rich and
[2:25:41] increased with Goods have need of
[2:25:42] nothing know us now that they're not the
[2:25:45] dour wretched miserable poor and blind
[2:25:49] and they kid so what does the scripture
[2:25:53] telling us this church is going to
[2:25:57] become blind
[2:26:00] the Jews were blinded right before the
[2:26:03] coming Messiah that Gentiles blinded
[2:26:08] right before the coming Messiah this is
[2:26:12] that beautiful I mean you know I'm not
[2:26:15] saying being blind is beautiful I'm
[2:26:16] saying that God puts this symmetry in
[2:26:19] the word and it's an amazing thing so um
[2:26:24] what did we add here okay now how then
[2:26:28] like we can go to the next slide brother
[2:26:30] Jack we can come back here and we can
[2:26:31] say okay these Gentiles are gonna become
[2:26:33] blind how how are they blinded now don't
[2:26:37] forget we talked about two hundred
[2:26:39] thousand thousand demons pushing Israel
[2:26:42] back into the homeland killing 1/3 of
[2:26:44] the Jews and then poof they disappear no
[2:26:50] they don't just disappear do they they
[2:26:52] go and do something don't they how are
[2:26:54] those Gentiles then blinded
[2:26:56] let's now I want to start looking we're
[2:26:59] going to look at sixth trumpet we're
[2:27:00] gonna look at six vial and really quick
[2:27:03] and I got like ten slides and then we're
[2:27:05] done
[2:27:05] okay can everybody together can you hang
[2:27:08] with me hang with me we'll go super fast
[2:27:12] okay so verse fourteen say to the six
[2:27:15] angel which had the trumpet loose the
[2:27:17] four angels which are bound in the great
[2:27:18] river Euphrates what river Euphrates
[2:27:21] this is a sixth trumpet revelations nine
[2:27:23] six trumpet River you're Freddy's go to
[2:27:26] revelations chapter 16 the sixth vial
[2:27:28] the six angel poured out his vial upon
[2:27:29] the great river and the water thereof
[2:27:32] was dried up that the way of the kings
[2:27:36] of the East might be prepared so this
[2:27:43] river that the two hundred thousand
[2:27:45] thousand demons were loosed out of is
[2:27:47] now dry and what happens when a river
[2:27:49] dries up I live real close to the Ohio
[2:27:53] River and I paid two dollars a day to
[2:27:56] cross the bridge going that way and two
[2:27:58] dollars a day to cross a bridge going
[2:28:00] that way but if that River ever dried up
[2:28:04] I could cross that River and I would
[2:28:07] save my four dollars
[2:28:13] the great river euphrates okay ah sit
[2:28:18] strumpet back to virtue after nine and
[2:28:20] thus I saw horses in the vision of them
[2:28:22] sat on them having breastplates of fire
[2:28:24] jacinth and brimstone heads of the
[2:28:25] horses where's my heads of lions and out
[2:28:27] of their mouths issued fire smoke and
[2:28:29] brimstone by these three was the third
[2:28:33] part of the men killed by the fire the
[2:28:35] smoke and the brimstone which should
[2:28:36] shoot out of their mouths for the powers
[2:28:37] in their okay three and mouth right I
[2:28:42] just keep that in mind three and mouth
[2:28:43] okay by these three or third part of the
[2:28:45] men killed the power was in their mouth
[2:28:47] their tails their tails were like
[2:28:48] serpents and had heads and with them
[2:28:50] they do hurt six trumpet oh yeah
[2:28:57] stay here that's what I was keying on
[2:28:59] three and the it issued out of their
[2:29:01] mouths right the fire the smoke the
[2:29:03] brimstone came out of their mouths these
[2:29:05] this is what killed them now six file or
[2:29:09] I'm sorry the gap after the six file
[2:29:11] revelations chapter 16 we just read
[2:29:14] verse 12 which was the six file now we
[2:29:16] were looking at the gap between the
[2:29:18] sixth and the seventh file revelation 16
[2:29:20] verse 13 I saw three unclean spirits
[2:29:22] like frogs come out of the how many were
[2:29:26] there three by these three out of these
[2:29:32] things that issued out of their mouths
[2:29:33] people were killed right for those
[2:29:36] demons they just single poof but they're
[2:29:38] not actually killing Jews anymore but
[2:29:41] they're still killing spiritually by
[2:29:43] these three unclean spirits like frogs
[2:29:45] because we know we know they're gonna be
[2:29:47] blinded we know Gentiles will be blinded
[2:29:49] it's indisputable Gentiles will be
[2:29:51] blinded these three unclean spirits like
[2:29:54] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[2:29:55] dragon the mouth of the Beast out of the
[2:29:56] mouth of the false prophet now brother
[2:30:00] Branham tells us what this what this
[2:30:01] this is what these three unclean spirits
[2:30:03] are and he tells us it's the Trinity
[2:30:05] doctrine it's the Trinity doctrine you
[2:30:08] say no no no wait wait well two hundred
[2:30:12] thousand thousand demons why are they
[2:30:14] religious and I ask you again
[2:30:18] who is the ones that rejected Jesus in
[2:30:19] his first coming
[2:30:21] the religious people of the day the ones
[2:30:24] closest absolutely closest to the truth
[2:30:27] rejected Jesus in his day and in the
[2:30:30] days of the Jews right before right as
[2:30:32] they're becoming blinded so is this
[2:30:33] going to be different in our day for the
[2:30:35] Jen's house no it's not going to be
[2:30:38] different you say now that's that's mean
[2:30:40] how can you say that
[2:30:41] these are Christians and things like
[2:30:43] that and and no I don't like it and then
[2:30:46] we go to verse 14 and they're spirits of
[2:30:48] Devil's working miracles which go forth
[2:30:53] unto the kings of the earth and the
[2:30:54] whole world to gather them to the Battle
[2:30:56] of that great day of God Almighty now no
[2:31:01] no no what's what's the spirit of devil
[2:31:06] doing working miracles when was the last
[2:31:09] time and I know none of you have ever
[2:31:11] gone to a you know a Satanist meeting or
[2:31:12] you know devil worshipping meeting you
[2:31:14] know but when you know I just I just
[2:31:16] sorry I'm just not imagining that you
[2:31:19] know they're in their dark cave and all
[2:31:20] of their hoods and however they do their
[2:31:22] things you know and that they're having
[2:31:23] a prayer line for miracle staff but
[2:31:28] their spirits of Devil's working
[2:31:30] miracles where do you think that's
[2:31:31] happening at in the religious because
[2:31:36] the rain falls on the just and the
[2:31:37] unjust amen
[2:31:40] so in the religious of the day why why
[2:31:46] is this happening this is a travesty
[2:31:48] this is terrible yes absolutely this is
[2:31:51] terrible
[2:31:52] I spend my life saying no don't do that
[2:31:57] don't go into that that Trinitarian
[2:32:00] doctrine and anything you know I told
[2:32:02] you on Sunday morning I was like man I
[2:32:04] wish I could preach about five sermons
[2:32:05] boy I just love to to take the teaching
[2:32:08] on Mystery Babylon and you know and I
[2:32:10] titled the sermon you know I read I read
[2:32:13] his slaps to Babylon so that you don't
[2:32:14] have to and I could show you I could let
[2:32:20] me tell you you don't want to I could
[2:32:22] show you where does this doctrine come
[2:32:25] from Nimrod it comes from Nimrod it is
[2:32:28] astounding to see okay so so I'd love to
[2:32:33] precept but I can
[2:32:34] and it's it's already past midnight so I
[2:32:36] won't switch to those slides next but
[2:32:40] this is a travesty this is terrible that
[2:32:43] there are Christian brothers and sisters
[2:32:44] of ours who are becoming blinded because
[2:32:47] that Euphrates River has dried up those
[2:32:50] demons that were once that sounded under
[2:32:53] the sixth trumpet they're done they're
[2:32:55] not killing Jews anymore
[2:32:57] but the river Euphrates dries up because
[2:32:59] it's dry they don't have to spend four
[2:33:01] dollars each way to go back and forth
[2:33:03] they can cross and do ecclesiastical
[2:33:05] realm and they can come into a religious
[2:33:08] realm and begin to kill and to blind the
[2:33:11] Gentiles just like we know is supposed
[2:33:14] to happen because of Revelations 314 317
[2:33:18] and then then we know there's a blinding
[2:33:21] of the Gentiles and there's a rapture
[2:33:23] coming and guess what Psalms 27 is the
[2:33:28] text that brother Branham uses for the
[2:33:30] rapture and it talks about you know then
[2:33:32] the day of trouble persecutions why
[2:33:38] because of what I'm preaching right now
[2:33:44] because we're saying that the
[2:33:46] Trinitarian doctrine is is out of the
[2:33:48] pits of hell it was a three frog
[2:33:50] doctrine it's it's spirits of Devil's
[2:33:52] working miracles I wouldn't like it
[2:33:56] either if I were them we thank God that
[2:34:03] a prophets message was the same time as
[2:34:06] those demons they're now done and we
[2:34:08] thank God that he loosed a prophet and
[2:34:11] he loosed the Holy Spirit bound by
[2:34:13] denominational rivers because these guys
[2:34:15] aren't bound by didn't by the Euphrates
[2:34:17] River anymore and a prophet can come and
[2:34:20] he can reveal to us what's going on in
[2:34:21] our day and our eyes can come open that
[2:34:24] we're not blinded because the fullness
[2:34:27] of the Gentiles is coming in the Church
[2:34:29] of God is going to be blind because the
[2:34:33] children of Israel were blind
[2:34:35] so is it now so we had a forerunner then
[2:34:37] we got a forerunner now and what does he
[2:34:40] do easy he's he's he's he's saying here
[2:34:42] he is he's coming get ready now
[2:34:49] then revelations 11 up there in the top
[2:34:51] corner we're gonna see that what is that
[2:34:53] that's that seventh trumpet we're
[2:34:55] waiting on a seventh seal the Jews are
[2:34:56] waiting on a seventh trumpet that
[2:34:58] seventh trumpet blows they're God's
[2:35:01] coming back he's gonna he's gonna reveal
[2:35:02] himself to his brother his brother in
[2:35:04] the juice and when that happens it's
[2:35:07] already over for the Gentiles the door
[2:35:09] will already be closed people will go be
[2:35:12] going and thinking they're still being
[2:35:14] saved and they're not and that's a scary
[2:35:18] thing it's terrible and I wish to God it
[2:35:21] wouldn't be that way but it was that way
[2:35:24] for the Jews and God's painting a
[2:35:27] beautiful wonderful picture yes there
[2:35:29] was something rather significant in this
[2:35:31] in this trumpets that he was trying to
[2:35:33] get to us and he was trying to get to us
[2:35:36] that this the sixth trumpet these demons
[2:35:39] they killed the Jews and now they're
[2:35:41] trying to get them into their homeland
[2:35:43] but now you know these these demons they
[2:35:46] don't stop being the same thing they
[2:35:48] were doing right what are they that
[2:35:50] they're killers and their homeland
[2:35:53] pushers right didn't know what they're
[2:35:58] supposed to be doing wasn't it the
[2:36:00] tender hand of Jehovah I mean you know
[2:36:02] hey they I mean you know they shouldn't
[2:36:04] have said his blood be on us and our
[2:36:06] children
[2:36:06] you know they shouldn't have said that
[2:36:08] and then and then so that happens and
[2:36:10] that's fulfilled back here and we think
[2:36:12] that's terrible and it is but God he
[2:36:15] blows the trumpet there's great trouble
[2:36:16] in the earth somewhere that's pretty
[2:36:17] much great trouble and what is it doing
[2:36:19] it's pushing them back into their
[2:36:21] homeland and that exactly is what
[2:36:23] happened these demons are homeland
[2:36:27] pushers they're still killing they're
[2:36:30] still pushing the Bride of Christ out of
[2:36:33] denominations into her homeland
[2:36:35] what is the homeland to the bride of
[2:36:36] Jesus Christ the message of the hour
[2:36:38] what is this message of the hour it's
[2:36:41] revelation 3:14 through the end of the
[2:36:44] chapter that he would send a seventh
[2:36:46] angel to the Church of the Laodiceans
[2:36:48] and that he would have a message that
[2:36:50] would come he would reveal these things
[2:36:54] he would reveal the seals he'd reveal
[2:36:56] all of these things and we can see the
[2:36:58] word we can see supernatural
[2:37:01] signs and wonders and we can see history
[2:37:03] all together in the age that we're now
[2:37:06] living in and if that doesn't astound
[2:37:11] you if this doesn't go if this doesn't
[2:37:13] blow your mind I spent weeks studying
[2:37:16] this listen to the servants a thousand
[2:37:19] times okay that's maybe not quite a
[2:37:21] thousand but this blew my mind but the
[2:37:27] thing that I get from this is how close
[2:37:28] are we
[2:37:29] and just how true the things that we
[2:37:32] believe are because it makes so much
[2:37:36] sense amen
[2:37:40] okay I got two slides left brother Jack
[2:37:46] - where are we at one more so where are
[2:37:53] we at how long have we got
[2:37:55] the Jews are in their homeland the bride
[2:37:58] is called scripturally everything just
[2:38:00] exactly what he promised we're ready the
[2:38:04] hour is here Church its 2019 the hour is
[2:38:10] here the hour is here you saying brother
[2:38:15] Trevor Jesus is coming in 2019 don't
[2:38:17] misunderstand me but the hour of his
[2:38:20] coming is upon us the six six of the
[2:38:23] seven trumpets have sounded those things
[2:38:25] that we thought oh and that's there's so
[2:38:26] much left in Revelations to be fulfilled
[2:38:28] no it's not revelation 17 the revealing
[2:38:33] of the Catholic Church who that who that
[2:38:35] mother Horace revelations 18 come out of
[2:38:37] her my people revelations 19 I saw a
[2:38:41] bride and she's made herself ready
[2:38:47] what's left Church what's left like five
[2:38:54] percent it's left to happen how that
[2:38:57] could we thought there was so many
[2:38:58] things left to happen but there's so few
[2:39:00] things left to happen where we at church
[2:39:03] what hour we at next last slide their
[2:39:07] seventh church age this is where we are
[2:39:09] we're in the seventh church age we're in
[2:39:13] the gap between the sixth and the
[2:39:14] seventh
[2:39:15] we're in the gap between the sixth and
[2:39:17] the seventh seal and we're in the gap
[2:39:18] between the sixth and the seventh
[2:39:20] trumpet
[2:39:21] I hope this has convinced you tonight
[2:39:29] and I hope that you become concerned
[2:39:33] this is what I wanted to say to you for
[2:39:35] 2019 we have every reason to believe
[2:39:37] that the things that we hold so dear
[2:39:40] this message is nothing but the truth
[2:39:44] there's just it's just it can become so
[2:39:47] plain to you and we can see it just so
[2:39:50] perfectly on a timeline aren't we
[2:39:54] blessed blessed people we are I don't
[2:39:58] care what condition you're in
[2:40:00] that you could see this as a blessing
[2:40:03] where are we at how much should we give
[2:40:07] to him how our how our hearts oughta
[2:40:10] just say god I don't want to be blind
[2:40:14] the fullness of the Gentiles is almost
[2:40:17] here God may my 20:19 yes had a sense of
[2:40:22] urgency that I recognize your coming is
[2:40:25] so close Church he's coming we talked
[2:40:29] about it Sunday morning
[2:40:31] what happened to Mary was a prophecy
[2:40:33] that waited for 700 years what what
[2:40:36] we're looking for is a prophecy that has
[2:40:38] waited for 2,000 years now but church it
[2:40:40] is coming it is coming that the wheels
[2:40:45] of this prophecy but the Branham said
[2:40:48] they turn slow but sure but I want to
[2:40:51] tell you Church I believe that they're
[2:40:52] speeding up I believe that they're
[2:40:54] speeding up as we get closer

[2:40:59] of the track that they're going it's

[2:46:33] you know I thank God for how he makes
[2:46:42] all of his ministers so different and
[2:46:45] just the way he uses each one and their
[2:46:51] special ways and all my years of just
[2:46:56] being a part of this message I don't
[2:46:58] think I've heard anybody ever kind of
[2:46:59] put the seven trumpets together the way
[2:47:01] I heard it tonight and it made it
[2:47:04] relevant and I thought it was just very
[2:47:10] fitting you know
[2:47:14] the greatest event that was promised in
[2:47:21] Scripture was the event concerning the
[2:47:25] second coming of our Lord and Savior
[2:47:27] Jesus Christ and there's a people that
[2:47:32] will live in the land I believe you know
[2:47:34] I've been preaching a message pretty
[2:47:36] much everywhere I go about Peter writing
[2:47:39] ye are chosen generation a royal
[2:47:41] priesthood a holy nation and when you
[2:47:44] think about those words that Peter wrote
[2:47:47] you would think Peter being a part of
[2:47:49] the the first coming of the Lord that he
[2:47:51] would I wrote the scripture that I am a
[2:47:54] chosen generation but Peter didn't write
[2:47:56] it that way he says ye are he's talking
[2:47:58] to a future people and that's the people
[2:48:01] that will be living on the earth at the
[2:48:03] time that Jesus comes the second time
[2:48:06] and what you saw here tonight were a lot
[2:48:09] of different signs we saw signposts we
[2:48:11] saw things you know there are things
[2:48:12] that we've probably been waiting to
[2:48:13] happen but didn't realize it already
[2:48:15] happened you know brother Branham talked
[2:48:18] to us about the overlap certain things
[2:48:21] we happen in here but also happening in
[2:48:23] here so a certain things happening with
[2:48:25] the Gentiles but also happening with the
[2:48:26] Jews at the same time we got to catch
[2:48:28] those things spiritually and I want to
[2:48:30] tell you I don't know you know we're so
[2:48:33] close to the coming of the Lord that
[2:48:34] this might be the last time we have a
[2:48:37] watch-night service and how fitting
[2:48:41] would it be for us to see a message
[2:48:42] tonight concerning that second coming
[2:48:46] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ don't
[2:48:48] go to sleep on this one
[2:48:51] Church this is serious business
[2:48:53] everything that brother Trevor was
[2:48:55] sharing we are seeing with our eyes same
[2:48:58] way the Jews spiritual people were
[2:49:01] blinded at the first coming of the Lord
[2:49:03] Jesus
[2:49:04] now when the work goes back to the Jews
[2:49:06] leaves are Gentiles fullness of the
[2:49:08] Gentiles comes in now we got Gentile
[2:49:10] people that are blinded but I think God
[2:49:13] for scripture as Jesus said the Spirit
[2:49:18] of Lord is upon me and he has anointed
[2:49:22] me let me read that let me read that
[2:49:26] Luke 4 look at this and look for verse
[2:49:31] 16 look at this oh my he came to
[2:49:38] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[2:49:39] and as his custom was he went into the
[2:49:42] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[2:49:45] up for the Reed and there was delivered
[2:49:46] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah
[2:49:48] and when he had opened the book he found
[2:49:50] the place where it was written the
[2:49:52] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[2:49:55] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[2:49:57] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[2:50:00] brokenhearted my God to preach
[2:50:05] deliverance to the captives and look at
[2:50:07] this and a recovering of sight see
[2:50:13] recovering of sight to blind it means
[2:50:15] that there might be Gentiles that have
[2:50:17] gone blind Jesus comes to recover the
[2:50:19] sight see to recover the sight to the
[2:50:23] blind and to set at liberty them that
[2:50:26] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[2:50:29] year of the Lord I believe Jesus did
[2:50:34] that tonight I said I believe Jesus did
[2:50:37] that tonight
[2:50:39] don't let it become common to your
[2:50:42] church this was from God this was from
