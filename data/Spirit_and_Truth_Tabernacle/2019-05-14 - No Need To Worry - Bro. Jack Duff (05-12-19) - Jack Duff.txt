don't don't let that be a feeling you got a mama appreciate huh a man I think I was telling my mom recently I just I watched what was this one day my daughter last week she graduated there and and and we had a lot of graduations here amen my daughter and I know that thank you all for supporting justice' my own yesterday their graduation I will say this that Zion gun graduate a man and I will say like I'm got thoughts going all over the place but this is Jessica Luke if you read the Book of Luke Luke was a doctor and he he worked with Jesus a man but I I thank God a man for my mother because I

let's let's let's read a scripture and I have in my spirit a couple things that I want to share and I don't know if we'll be able to get to it but I'm praying that we will you know just just praying it the Lord will just bring it all together for us but nonetheless we won't at least mama to leave here learn courage today turn with me to first King 17 and then I also just want to read a scripture from 2nd Corinthians 5 they will seem like they don't go together but hopefully the Holy Spirit to help us bring it bring it to you so you can catch the thought today a man and I want to appreciate the specials that that went forth on today and you know sister Tina kind of stepped right into I thought I was sitting there trying to like what am I gonna title this you know and and and the Lord had given me a title earlier this morning it just gave me no need to worry no need to worry and she came right and start singing on that song there so I said well that's a confirmation a man from God here first grin first King 17 starting at verse 8 it says in the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to Zarephath which belongeth to Zion and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee a man so he arose and went to Zarephath and when it came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it they called her and said bring me I pray the immortal Rayland I'm ham and he said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil and a cruse and behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me there of a little cake first and bring it unto me after and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel mill shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent his reign upon the earth and she went and did according to the sing of Elijah and she and and he in her house did eat many days in the barreled mill wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he speak by Elijah amen I just want to also just take a scripture from second Corinthians chapter 5 a man trusts that the Lord will help us with this amen on today glory to God here it says for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens amen the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word shall we just have a word of Prayer and we'll let you have your seats father we thank you for this opportunity to reach Scripture but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to bring clarity and understanding to us we trust that you would take control father by thought here today Lord me every mother here leave strengthened and encouraged by your spirit and we trust o God that you would just bless them we thank you for them we realize there's an the the there's the love of a mother is next to the love of God and father how we just appreciate them and their patience their love their everything that they've done the guy their wisdom that they've given two or three years thank you for these godly mothers that have raised children here and and lord I just pray each one would receive their reward not just in heaven but even here on earth may they receive the reward for the great things that they do bless this service today in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you praise the Lord we just want to use for our subject no need to worry certainly if that's just something we can encourage the mothers with no need to worry oftentimes we go through things in life we go through different challenges different trials especially when you're raising a man a family and things that nature things come up they men and families things happen and you know oftentimes the devil is just throwing curveballs and all kind of things like that but I won't encourage your mothers just just don't worry God got everything under control and I mean last Sunday there was a I think with brother J Breathitt sermon our faith was elevated to believe God for our families so many people stand in the gap for their loved ones and and I'm just under expectation that a man you will receive what you asked for amen hallelujah God is the one that made the promise God said the promise is unto you and to your children those that are far off as many as the Lord our God shall call and if God spoke it then it's got to come to pass there's not one word that he has said that will fail Amen not one word will fail so let me just kind of start off here reading a little a little thought from the sermon the invasion of the United States a man the Prophet makes this comment here says to you little mothers this morning that's been real mother's a man just because you can have a child don't make you a mama praise the Lord Amen you got some responsibilities amen and raising that child in the ways of God that's what makes you a mother so says to your little mothers here this morning that's been real mother's and I know there's many of you I think every one of you let me tell you something god bless you you're the fifth gospel and when he's talking about the fifth gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John those are the four Gospels but it's saying you're as mama you are the fifth gospel says let me tell you what's in there for your children just a little thing says because brother Neville will probably preach on about mother tomato whoever one of us that preaches all right about mothers but listen let me ask you something you can see the Prophet did preach about mothers praise the Lord somebody there are all the deep things that he talked about one of the deep things was to talk about Mama's praise the Lord right a man says but listen let me ask you something remember when Moses was a little boy it was a mother who gave him his instruction it was a godly mother who took a little Moses on her knees and said Moses taught him Octomom he was she was his teacher rather under Pharaoh and and said now these things that Moses some day you're going to deliver the children of Israel you were the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you're the one you're the one no other place do we know where he ever went just in a seminary any teaching at all he ever got he stayed right in Pharaoh's Palace which was a heathen but his mother taught him that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the Lord she told him how he must be holy she told him how he what he must live and and what God must do would do for him and it stuck with Moses all the days of his life so I want to tell you mothers make sure you saw these type of things into your children talk to them about living holy talk to them about living right talking about keeping their selves until God give them a husband to give them a wife there's nothing wrong with sharing those things with your children a man the wildly gonna give it to them so you might as well give it to them right come on somebody amen mothers don't be don't be ashamed to have some type of conversations with your children glory to God Amen it's important that a mama tell the child set expectations a man for the children listen says in any good true lawyer mother that'll take her little babies instead of sending them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's it that's that's very very important for mothers to do that that is that is a role that we play I want to just make a few comments here I was like I said I was blessed to have a man a godly mother and and and one of the things that mama did for me even as I you know got into becoming a teenage she was a real example a real example a man of what what a Christian is and there's many little thoughts that go through my head of mama and just how she conducted herself and handled herself through different situations and you know when we didn't really want to serve the Lord she was still a godly mother a man and and and I just saw I remember you know going to a friend's house and we had service on Sunday Sunday evenings and you know going to church once this one sunny was good enough for me at that time we really didn't want to go right me and my brother I can't remember what time we really want to go in and Mama and Daddy decided they wanted to walk to church one morning and we were we were we were too cool a man to be seen walking with our family to church walk to church but hide us in the car and take us right and and and they said no we gonna walk good it's a good day we're gonna walk the church and lord have mercy we say y'all go ahead would catch up with y'all Amen we want to be seen walking with the family and so so mom and daddy went on ahead with our sisters and my little brother and and me older brother we stay we stay back will come will forget their look at their and before we knew it somehow the daddy had made it back to the house before we could get out of the house and daddy staff thought y'all was coming to church yeah we coming and daddy had a belt in his hand and we got at that house real fast right and we walked to church with my dad but you know I remember things like that growing up as a little boy and I remember this one little friend that I go to his house in between services and we always went outside on Sunday a man and we try to hide because we knew that Sunday evening service service would come so we try to hide in a back yard so that when mama came by that house she wouldn't see us in the front yard and it's amazing how we we could tell time at a very early age we knew exactly what time it was and we said now we got that we can we go around the back and man can we hang out in the back now they didn't know why we was hanging on the back but I knew why I want to go to the backyard amen mama was on her way and if mama saw me in the front yard what did you think mama would have did the car would have stopped it would have hurt she might wanna just blow her horn first and I would have to act like I knew what that meant cause if I wouldn't acted like I knew what that meant the mama would have got out hallelujah and all she said church time now I would have been so embarrassed to have to go to church but amen mama mama was just mainstay in our life and you know and even when when I was when I was trying to run from God seeing those type of things in her hallelujah when I got old amen I became the parent that she was Amy she's so certain seeds way back Dean and not its president we're like when I got on some mom I want to tell you and all you other mothers don't worry you keep training up your children right the way that they're supposed to go and when they get all the Bible says they will not depart I don't care what you're looking at right now mama don't worry no need to worry no need to worry let me go to the Prophet this makes a few comments and I'm not going to take take read all these uh quotes but I'll just I'll tell you what the sermon that they're coming from I'm just reading sentences out of it so don't worry about pulling this up in the message mother's day he makes a comment says Abraham Lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was after 21 years old but the Bible and the Fox Book of Martyrs those are only two books he owned up until he was 21 years old because brother brother brother branham said see what you read most of character that you are alright what you read will mold the character of what you are hallelujah and and and and I just I have to take time to read a little something because mama put this in me proverbs 1 verse 8 a man proverbs 1 when I was a young man after you know coming up through school and before I got married I was still at home a man and mama used to just tell me son just reap Roberts just reap reverbs and I'm like I don't want to read proverbs just reap reverbs just read proverbs but you know we grew up with this thing that we were supposed to be obedient our parents anybody else still grown over that and even though we didn't want to do it we did it anyway because we understood that there was a long life associated with being obedient to your parents oh my god ha ha times have changed I see children that actually thank they parents let me ask a question then I'd give birth to you or did you give birth to me huh well if I'm a parent it's gonna be like what I say raisin Lord but things have changed and we don't give some of us parents that gave our kids a little bit too much leeway we gotta keep them in check with Amen God got an order to this thing there are always be your child all right hallelujah amen but mama mom used to tell us read proverbs if read proverbs and and I and and now that same advice I give to other young men I got that from my mama right when I'm talking other young me and what they want to know where where I start out reading Bible read proverbs read Psalms these are easy things to read read that and just let it just soak into your spirit but this is one that mama gave me and and just read proverbs and I just wanted to read a little bit of this and proverbs are one chapter of the first chapters starting at verse actually let's start at verse 7 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction my son and I took that person in my son here the instruction of their father and forsake not the law of thy mother now what would the scriptures say that hear destruction of their father a mistake not the law of thy mother you realize in the house so typically his mom establishing the law hallelujah now she used data Tim forces come on somebody hallelujah she's using daddy to actually make it make it coming to law when it comes out of nice mouth right everybody fall in place but it's mama encouraged of daddy behind the scenes we need to put this in place for them oh come on somebody hallelujah I thank God for my wife a man mothered my children and as you know I say I'm a father of daughters and it's very easy for girls to get underneath their daddy huh right very easy for girls to be a little sly can we put it that way hey man them girls they can get right on me hey daddy just trying to get everything that daddy got mama got her eye on them and mama will say certain things and you know I might sit there you know it's okay she said no you don't understand what's giving it a fit you don't understand you don't see this yeah trust me I am a woman hallelujah and when she used words like that then I got to know it something deeper happening yes no matter how much that girl might be smiling huh how she trying to win your heart over with something she I gave you some compliment and stuff that girl is buttering you up or something [Music] but what you got you got a good godly wife there to kind of show you know watch this and she said that we need to put these things in place so that the kids can't do this mama is established in the law but she gonna use daddy to enforce it all right now let's keep on going since I forsake not the law that mother for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck hallelujah goes on say my son if sinners enticed econsent thou not verse 11 if they say come with us let us lay wait Lane wait for blood let us learn privily for the innocent without cause let us swallow them up alive as the grave and hold those that go down into the pit we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoil they're gonna Rob somebody Casta not sister Mama's telling you watch out who you hang out with and I don't like this friend I don't like that friend proverbs would give you instruction or who to hang out with not hang out with a man read proverbs Lord I say cast in that a lot of mungus let us all have one purse they meant my son whoa not thou in the way with them not it's a scripture telling you exactly what to do don't go that way say what not in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird and they may wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives so are they so are the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereof now you know I was I would sometimes just sit in my own quiet time and I'd just be reading proverbs and and I didn't realize that you know while I was reading a man proverbs that this this wisdom was being imparted in me I wasn't I well I couldn't say that I was meditating on proverbs I mean all I was doing was just obeying my mother who said read proverbs and I would go read it because if she asked did you read it then I could say yeah I read it already but I didn't realize as I was reading it it was actually depositing something inside of me and this thing was actually done control who I was oh my goodness and I thank God mother that would actually instill that in me because it allowed me to make the right decisions through life mama didn't have to come get me out of jail right I'm grateful for that she never had to come get me out of jail hallelujah right so so so so I will encourage a men are not tested that the sons but even the daughters read propers read proverbs Leonard says God your heart catch of my I mean when you read scripture you don't realize power shaping your character Rihan Lincoln was shaped by reading scripture yes hallelujah the Prophet makes another statement here and I thought this was real good in the Philadelphia Church age no no actually let me go a little further this is our Mother's Day he says it says in the face of all that let me go on this court he says what you read most of character that you I listen the message Mother's Day says no wonder we got a bunch of new rocks today little old fiction magazines and vulgar nonsense is placed upon on newsstands here on the Bible the Fox Book of Martyrs look what it made him but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this he said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a godly mother that reared him to serve the Lord and he goes on the process you see a child listens to his mother something little some little touch about that mother that a child will listen to listen when it's hurt when a child is hurt when it's hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it'll go to the Father the Prophet says when a child is hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it'll go to the Father now I think you know we all do that if something's going on the first person we go crying to is his mama and when you got mama dare to listen to you and the bear with you and all of that you ought to thank God for it Amen you ought to thank God for it and and and I know as a as a husband I can appreciate that a man my wife is there for her kids and I see them that you know they talk and they communicate and and and I can appreciate that that knowing that they got that type of relationship right I mean that is a what we call a fix-it man a man he simply wants to take a screwdriver or a hammer praise the Lord whatever is necessary and he want it fixed now glory to God that's how daddy but momma gonna sit there and cry with you little bit huh mama gonna sit there and talk with you a little bit I don't care how old you get they met you enjoy hearing your mama's voice especially when you going through something you enjoy hearing see a child when it's hurt it's gonna go to mother for consolation before it'll go to father this something about a man being held by mama all right he says because she was the first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives a mother to be that way I mean a real mother and I believe that mothers are honorable and godly now here's a statement that was made here in the Philadelphia Church age John Wesley was the messenger to this age and and the Prophet pulls up something a man out of John Wesley's family his daddy was a chaplain which would have made him a preacher a man but brother Rams say his father was a chaplain in the Church of England but it's more than likely that the religious turn of John's mind wasn't based on what his daddy did the religious turn of John's mind was based more upon his mother's exemplary life than upon his father's theology I want you to get that scroll back go go back up yeah there you go he says it was it was more than likely that the religious turn of judgments or the religious turn of of a child's mind a man is based more upon the mother's exemplary life amen then upon the father's theology we ought to think gospel mom for mamas we ought to really appreciate promised if John amen a message of messenger to the aged was more influenced by how his mama handle things and hi his mama did things amen what what type of mother should we be today amen she raised a not I mean a messenger through her exemplary life that's what caused him to want to turn to God all Halloween a man I'll tell you what when you got a godly mother like that it kind of makes it easy for you to say you know what I remember God did this from my mom and God did that for my mama and I want to serve the same God that mama surf hey man momma's y'all y'all don't worry you keep showing you just keep shining like you keep doing what you're doing amen the kids run to mama because it's just natural for them to do that Amen that's natural for them to do that and mama has mama responds differently than daddy does amen right so it's very natural for that nothing wrong with that I want to read this out of the message Amen the influence of another a man will read this one let's just pull this or enough for me the influence of another go right to paragraph 38 on that influence of another the Prophet says this oh your family your family is what you are say you raised your child in a certain environment it's got I like this statement if you raise your child in a certain environment I'm a paragraph 38 says if you Ranger up your child in a certain environment it's got a 98% better chance to go right then then it is then it has if you bring it up the wrong way so your child if your child is raised in the right environment it has a 98% chance to go right then it has if you're bringing up the wrong way now i'ma tell you I'd like to take my chances if I got a 98% chance that my child gonna go right because I raised them right I'm gonna take my chances now you have to expect every child is gonna run to a spot where there's gonna be maybe thinking about not doing it the way that you did man they got kind of go against what you did but if you did what God told you to do once they get to that spot ain't no need to worry it's gonna work out just right chance that this child gonna serve God when they get over because I did what I was supposed to do I like that I like that it says it's a it's got a 98% better chance to go right then it has if you bring it up in the wrong way bring up a child in the way that it should go and when it's oh well not it will not depart from it be brought up right teach the children to do right to be honest b-squared fair even when they're in school now you know just something happened this week that just blessed my heart and I just kind of kept it to myself we were at the house just kind of

Scripture actually I'm let me let me just let me save that let me save that I'll come come back brother jay-bez shared a testimony that I need to share with you all we went to church on a Friday night there brother Ramiz and and he shared his testimony at brother Billy Paul gave said brother Billy Paul was telling us this testimony said there was a man some City he just for some reason man got very depressed very sad very sad no don't know what happened but just very sad story they was taking him to the doctor and the doctors was prescribing you know peels and all kind of things to him but just see my demands just nothing ever changed she just he remained sad just remain sad so the pastor told the wife said you know we need to take your husband to see brother Branham and maybe he can help them you know if we just take him to see him say okay well you know we'll go down there and see him and they they come and they got there to where brother Branham was and and they went to uh they saw Billy Paul first and he knocked on the door and Billy Paul comes out the office and he greets you know the husband I mean in Greece dia the pastor god bless you he greets the wife god bless you and then the husband he says God bless you the man just sit there and just didn't didn't put his hand out then do not make no facial expressions just extremely sad extremely sad so brother Billy Paul trying to detect what's the matter what just got so the wife say for years he's been like I mean for months he's been this way we don't went to doctor after doctor and that's why we come here because we can't we don't understand what's wrong with we can't get this man out of this you know this particular you know this condition we just can't can't get him free from it so she said that's why we came up here you know the pastor say we should come so that's why we're here hoping to see brother branham he said I'll tell you what let me go and get brother branham and I'll be right back so brother Billy Paul runs into the office say daddy there's a man out here you need to pray for him because this man is really really sad I don't know what the matter what's the matter I put my hand out to shake his hand he just looked at me and you know and just staring at me I don't know what's the matter with this man so uh brother brother branham said okay I'll go out and I'll talk to him and it comes out and he talks to the man I mean he talks to you know the pastor and talks to the wife and he does the same thing try to put his hand out and shake all their hands I'm gonna get to the man the man won't shake his hand so he looked at him say okay he said give me a minute I'll be right back you know I'll be right back and it went back inside the door and brother Billy palms to my hand brother Browns on the inside so brother Branham goes in he said give me a minute I'll be right back well thirty minutes go by and he doesn't come he doesn't come back so brother Billy Paul's getting a look at sir like you know daddy I thought she was gonna pray for the man what happened you ain't you ain't come out yet and but brother Billy Paul dude don't go interrupt daddy if he said I'm coming right back then you just wait to Daddy come back right he knew that much so respect to the standing salmon's I wait for them to come back so y'all just you know just wait he'll be fine I will go by and brother branham hadn't really come back you didn't all of a sudden a little ways go by and brother branham comes out of the room and when it comes out he says praise the Lord and the man say hallelujah and any they shake hands and walk away the man walks out you know the wife walks out the pastor walks out and all of them smiling and grinning like my he lifts his hands and I don't know how long and for him say hallelujah it brought a smile on his face and the man walked away brother Branham never prayed for him never prayed for him just praise the Lord and the man say hallelujah and the man walked away so you know they left and they was in the car leaving and they was waving at brother Brandon and man in the car waving glory to God god bless you brother Brandon you don't see you later this just took off my brother Bailey Paul saw this and you know waited long time and he was like brother branham say Paul are you okay it's like daddy you know I'm not okay you know I'm not okay daddy you know that he said you already know what's the matter with me Danny I mean it ain't no sense of me hiding it daddy you never pray for the man what you did was come in the office you stayed here for a little over our and do you come I'm just saying praise the Lord the man said I was Louie and he left daddy I don't know what happened so he told Billy something let me just give you all the scripture on this this is why I read 2nd Corinthians 5:1 all right this way I read this for we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens now I read that scripture because you know what brother Branham said is and I want I would just want to come and drop this you don't just for a little bit I'll finish off the store in a second but I want to drop a little something in here when you're born you know it's mama that make preparation for you when you're born you realize that you know they have the the baby showers and they have all these other things the child does not even have a chance to select the clothes that it wants the child does not have a chance to select the gifts that it wants the child can't even express appreciation for the things that is going to get a man child never even says thank you right but the people are so excited and it's mama a man and other mothers that are like her that want to try to make sure when that child comes into the world that it's got everything is supposed to have hallelujah I got a quota pair won't have time to read it but brother Branham say if your earthly parents will go through great extremes to make sure that you have everything you need when you come to earth your heavenly parents a man goes through greater extremes hallelujah somebody this is why he goes to prepare place for us amen we don't even get a chance to pick out cuz we don't we don't get a chance to say hi it's gonna be design right but but but here it is because he knows what we like na he's already made it that way he's already made preparation pour us a man and not only has he made preparation a man in the end for natural things but even in your body because he knows that he knows to buy things for you before you come before you can even appreciate them if your mama can think like that your heavenly parent thinks greener so the bible tells us that he's already desired this body for us it's already designed this body and you know I read that scripture and I'm gonna just call it another one here for you real quick this is just bless your heart when you you can get a chance to go back and read it a man I this is out of Matthew 18 and and 10 it says take heed that you despise take he that you despise not one of these little ones I said to you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven and I like verse 11 as well for the Son of man has come to save that which was lost so here you know when we look at Matthew 18 10 when it's talking about their angels this is talking about their theophanies hallelujah so mama mama I'm gonna just put it like this the reason that you don't need to worry and you know mine your child got a theophany that came from God can I tell you the reason you need to work because it's going back to God I don't care whether yet I don't care what they've done if they got a theophany that came from God it's going back to God my brother Billy Paul was saying daddy I don't understand what just happened you never pray for this man all you did is come out and say praise the Lord and the man said hallelujah and he smiled and walked away and it was just waving his hand to dinner I don't understand what just happened here so so brother and say Billy you want to know the reason that I couldn't come to you he said you know when I saw the man that we're not there to shake his hand everything he would shake my hand I realized that I could not help that man there was nothing that I could do hallelujah to help that man he was that bad off there was nothing I could do so what I had to do was come in here and start praying and when I start praying I went before the throne of God and I went looking for his theophany when I went to heaven and I was searching around heaven looking for the master Diop aney Amen and when I run into this when I ran to that one and it was of him he said and I couldn't I couldn't find him st often it just took me I realized if he did not have a theophany then there would be no hope for him here [Music] no hopeful how do we he say bad after now so found his dear Fanny and when I found a theophany I went up and I said praise the Lord and his fearfully said hallelujah he said so I took his theophany Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] it's just like a cell phone that got depleted and all they need to do is get plugged in that's why the man was sad he'd miss be to be plugged in he got a charge from his theophany that other body that was waiting for him and when he got his charge what happened with you when you get your charger yourself huh take it off the child just keep going you never pray for it you just you charged it and kept going so mama today maybe you need a charge maybe your children need a charge and we prayed it they're here from a theophany [Applause] that could take us into those rooms and by taking somebody into that room now he never explained it to those other people what happened he never explained to the man what happened he never explained to the the wife or the pastor they might not have been able to receive it right Coop's say that to me just say praise the Lord hallelujah all right god bless you but Billy power can understand these things and then that's why I read these scriptures to put it back in there so that you understand what's going on according to the word there are angels brother Branham actually explains Matthew 18 10 I don't have time to read all this but I'm gonna tell you where to find him and your co D book or questions and answers book you find a questionnaire where brother Branham is explained in Matthew 18 10 now and when he goes explained he says now there's there's kind of two ways that you any ties Matthew 1810 to 2nd Corinthians 5 and one a man if this earthly earthly tavern that could be dissolved I'll read a little bit of that alright let's just read a little bit of that I think it'll help y'all a date a man I won't read the rest of everything but I read this at least he says that you despise not one of these little ones while standing you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of the Father which is in heaven this is all right now but brother whoever who you are of course there's no names just little tickets you see who said I'm sure they were after him actually proper to explain Matthew 18 10 says now you could take two ways of it two ways of it he says you see but I think the interpretation if you just asked me explain this the way I interpret this is this look at this the way I interpret this the Prophet is telling you I told you can go with the prophetic definition or you can go with a man of theologians definition I choose to take profit you can take two ways of you see but I think the interpretation if you just ask me explain this the way I interpret this is this now you turn to 2nd 2nd corinthians somebody 5-6 in this earthly tavern I could be dissolved you know what it is if this herbal attack our earthly tab and I could be dissolved we have one already you know waiting alright now if you notice in Matthew 18 10 he was speaking about taking little children they was little children little tops 3 or 4 years old picked them up so when we talk about Matthew 18 10 a man we might we might be looking at it well you know there because brother branham people talked about how no Billy Paul talked about how one time he they were answering letters from from his dad other mail and they were answering the letters and answer the letters and and and and his little son just kept interrupting him and his daddy answered no less and any say now he's saying I'm certain you gonna have to leave us alone we're doing this now you got to leave us alone so he go away and come back and he start bothering me and he say something I told you you gonna have to leave us alone right so I think the third time is little boy coming there again and interrupt them from answering them letters and and I he said ev'ry so and he smacked him real good and then he say he's sitting on that from sitting out the room so brother branham told Billy Paul you say son I know you're trying to correct you a little winning and you have right to do that he say but when you hit him that time you actually hit his angel you hit his angel a man when you spanked him that time because he hit him out of anger it's one thing to correct your child but it's another thing to do it out of anger hallelujah amen so so he say you you actually hit the angel that time things you didn't like that hallelujah could it be that we're in some of the situation's we in because we actually hit the angel could it be so maybe rather than just apologizing to the child go back to that angel that theophany body I'm sorry I hit you - Amen church you hit the angel because you did it out of anger any man right so so so brother Brad we have to tell them that is like okay you know that humble himself down and and Lord I'm sorry I should've did it like that and even as a parent you learn how to chest out just as you're a man praise God a man you just don't pick up everything and anything and go after angel with them you just can't say anything to it there's an angel with them hallelujah you don't want just to angel watching over them when they when they out in the trouble you know that angel ordered capital round about them that fear let me go home it says now if you notice in Matthew 18 he was speaking about taking little children they was little children little tots three or four years old picked them up they brought them brought unto Him children children comes from the name of child a child is just a little fella not an infant but just between that and a teenager it's not responsible yet for itself hey man now he said take heed that you don't despise if you really take the interpretation of that word is miss treat don't mistreat God help us all don't miss treat sometimes that's hard thing not to do but the Bible tells you not to do it don't miss treat listen to miss treat one of those mistreat a child you should never do that they're children they don't know see and and now notice because they're angels always behold my father's face face which is in heaven you see in other words they're angels their messengers their bodies angelic bodies that they'll go to if they die are always before my father's face in heaven see he says now if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have when ready waiting is that right that's a body look here if I just had time to go through these course I know I'm not going to have it but here let me just give it up to you so it's on tape and you give it anyhow look now this is the other angle he said now cuz we just can't look at it as just a child a man I just told you this brother was sad and he got a charge of his Theophilus so that angel starts with you as a child but it stays with you all through your life because now he's gonna pick up Peter now watch this he says look one night Peter was in prison they had a prayer meeting down at John marks house see and so the angel of the Lord come in that pillow that that pillow pillow fire a light come down and Peter thought he was dreaming when he seen this light come to him the Bible said it was it was a lion see and I believe it's the same one with us see he come down and we get in the same trouble maybe the same thing with happen see and coming here and so he said come go with me so Peter thought I'm dreaming now so I'll just see what this dream means so he walked right on by the guards and thought huh now we going by the door just open by itself went out the next door open by itself went through the city gates it opened myself and he still thought he was dreaming so then so when he stood up there said well I'm free so I'll just go down to John Mark's house and have some fellowship they way they was back there Oh Lord send your angel deliver Peter now this is their praying deliverer Peter and about that time something with the little dancer went to the door and said who's there raised up the little lattice said why is Peter so he went back I mean she went back say hey you can stop praying my penis here oh my god I like that ain't man I can't I can't wait we can start praying in here [Applause] [Applause] listen he says that opener no no says a penis here they said oh my go ahead say your your your see said said open up I'm coming in so it said sorry went back said no it's Peter at the door oh they said now this is what they said they cut his head off already and that's his angel so as angel must look like you that's his angel at the door see yes oh my god you ought to be able to catch by vision your child's angel is in the presence of the Lord worshiping yes and if their angel is there that's the positive the positive has to connect with the negative one time they've got to come together and if I see it in a positive a man I'm gonna see it also here in the negative oh my god he says that's his angel adore see his heavenly tabernacle he done received it if this earthly one was dissolved because it was waiting in heaven for him to come to Lord this is alright for me what I've seen the other day in that vision you know crossed over if earth if this earthly time and I could be dissolved we have one and these little fellows felt our fellows whose done done no sin as yet you see you see okay just let me read this last paragraph from that when a baby is being formed in a womb of a mother soon as it's put there see but first it's a spirit as that spirit begins to take on flesh that's a powerful statement I wish I could just reach that right there before the mama conceives it's a spirit and do you realize that spirit have to find a womb that it could come through and God elected God predestiny that you would come through the womb of your mama but first you are spirit see you came from God and if you came from God then you have to go back to God you cannot be loss see Judas didn't come from God that's why he was lost but if you came from God even though you might be in a simple state right now if you came from God you're gonna get a charge one of these days yes from your feel funny you know sometimes you come to church and you don't even want to say Amen but it's something come maybe jump on your shoulder you don't feel like Santa man you don't fit you don't feel like even being here amen meet him wherever they are I think it was the prodigal son that got a charge to misty - right something told him say you don't need to be living like this go back to your daddy's house hallelujah and when they got there they celebrated a man a man a man a man a man all right let me go and let me try to finish this says it's first it's a spirit as that spirit began to take begins to take on flesh a little German life begins to take on flesh and as soon as it drops now in the womb it's a little quivering jerking muscles we know that that sales just like that like just just like you take a horsehair and put it in the water in a cap over in a move and you'll touch it and it'll jump that's the way a baby is but as soon as it's born in this world and breathes its first breath it becomes a living soul see because as soon the earthly body is born into the world there's a celestial body or a spiritual body to take ahold of it and as soon as this natural body drop there's a heavily Tabernacle waiting for it if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved there's a heavenly tabernacle wait and forth just as soon as the baby is dropped into the earth and flesh there's a spiritual body waiting to receive it and as soon as that spiritual part of natural bodies dissolve there's a spiritual body waiting yonder a theophany we call it a theophany I like that brother branham said he had to go find the man Stephanie right I mean all the way to shake this sadness this man was so down he said I couldn't even shake his hand and nothing that I can do with this man but the only way to shake his sadness that I had to go get his feet off in it now let me tell you something his theophany was not sad see Anthony was saying his theophany when he was greeted when the theophany was greeted praise the Lord hallelujah that's the theophanies response so he had the bring the man's theophany bring it back from heaven and put it right here next to say now praise the Lord hallelujah he don't even realize what happened he got a charge to misty - II never even got grateful all your children needs the charge of me [Music] yeah God has given him a head that angel was there at birth and it goes all the way through life with it and when they get that charge mama you ain't got nothin to worry about daddy ain't got none to worry about they gonna get that charge glory to God see any what I just picked up the scripture you know just trying to tie these thoughts together but this woman that was that was about food they were it was a famine in the land she the Prophet was sent to her house and here come you know the Prophet to this woman's house and brother Graham said what a strange place for the man of God to go to a widow woman and he was already told to go to a certain lake or river and that he'd be sustained there but that river dried up that situation dried up and he had to move on to the next place and and he said go to the woman this widow at Zarephath and say say I've already ordained that she will sustain thee now this is what God says about her and when the Prophet goes into the city and he sees this woman and she's there picking up sticks and get feel the Spirit of God say that that's her just just just go to and just just you know just just talk to it it said ma'am would you please just get me some water now now now the prophet I mean God say that the woman was already prepared to sustain him but notice her response she say they say say would you give him some work she went running to go get the water but as she's on awake so she's already responding properly to what the Prophet acts and as she's on her way to get water he makes another request it's the if you don't mind also bring me a morsel of bread and this is where she says now wait a minute all I got is just enough a meant for me and my son that's all I got is just enough for me myself he said she said now I'm gonna get this glue I'm gonna make this little thing here and say me and him we gonna die after we eat this hallelujah but see here's what God knew that that woman amen was gonna be obedient after she got a little charge from the Word of God hallelujah so he said Oh someday children but you gotta I know they got needs but they need to come to this church [Applause] my children I have to tell my kids a long time ago I love God more than I love you I love you if you ever put me in a position I want you to know the woman said me and my son is about to die I'm gonna do this for him I mean he's gonna die so I would do this for him first he said no no make me a cake first and I guarantee if you do it the way God told you to do it your cruse of oil will not run empty and your barrel of meal will not go dry she went in and just scooped up the last bit and baked a cake for the profit in ticket talk and he said now bake me one first and then bake one for your son so when she come out head and I see no she don't Richard ain't got the last but she was obedient and she got her last and gave it to God i'ma just see your kids might have needs but you don't take your tithe money to supply they need God understand God understand that you just put your child in front of him hey man you don't take your tithes and offering and give that to your kids and say God understand all that belong to God babe got his cake first hear hear hear hear say Knight wasn't right when you bake my cake then you go back and you gonna see it's gonna be some some meal there for you it's gonna be some order for you sir now that lady know she just used her last but by faith she did exactly what the prop said and when she went back that barrel had some not knowing God he didn't fill it all the way up it was just enough to keep up coming back it just enough just to keep up coming back just so you have to continue to depend on him you know she just kid enough for this meal go back the next day so enough for the next meal go back the next day it's enough for the next meal hallelujah but she did what God acts her to do first hallelujah that woman received a promise and that and I believe one other things that this woman in the midst of this great drought that she was in one of the things that really set her apart from everybody else they probably gave her an assurance that gave her a peace is when she heard thus saith the Lord and I want to tell you when you got a bus say that the Lord it changes everything in your life as I was reading I say Lord I just wish we had people that we could depend on that could say thus saith the Lord to our situations not circumstances amen we might not have nobody directly like like God's prophet but we got the word right and just some of the testimonies that we share ought to be of thus saith the Lord enough for you to know you ain't got to worry no need to worry no need to worry I don't care what they conditions like let me I got some things I want to read and I'm gonna close out here today I I promise oh my when that lady got that bus that door from the proper sheet she had no problem ain't been given her last to him oh Jesus this is this is I got I gotta kind of cut this short amen I'm reading from the message divine love and this particular sermon I'm gonna go directly to paragraph be 43 for the sake of time but this particular sermon what I'm sharing here is a man the story a man of the woman in Memphis Tennessee you all know where the random talked about her and how her son was dying there in the house and she was and I should say Lord I'm I'm like the Shunammite woman in the Bible say but where's your Elijah and her prayers calls God to take a plane that was coming over the top of her city and and not just you know the plane didn't just land anywhere it calls the plane that come to hunt Airport because the plane was carrying her prophet and this lady prayed and her simple prayer grounded the plane yeah brought the Prophet - huh city and he didn't know why he was there just he

divine love I'm and my paragraph P 43 so that's the way I dress just exactly oh brother when divine love is projected that mother with a baby nearly a hundred and eighty pounds but he was still her baby laying dying in disgrace no matter how disgraceful he was it was her baby a man you can't I don't care how much you talked about Mama's son thought that boy no Billy that boy is that he's still Mama's baby and if ain't nobody else gonna love them mama will and let me tell you something when you get kids you'll understand why mama feel the way she feel I don't care how bad off the child lid boy are girl mamas do though I don't care how wrong they are Mama's still gonna love them amen hallelujah you didn't give birth to him alright Amen they didn't grow inside of you alright glory to God there's a connection that mama has that nobody else can take from her all right listen no matter how disgraced what he was it was a baby she loved him that's a mother's love no matter how disgraced he brought how much disgrace he brought she still loved him and if you can't forget your baby no matter what done how much more can God not forget you he said your names are engraved on the palms of my hand a mother may forget her suckling babe but never will I forget you no matter what you've done how far back you gone how much you've got into God still loves you God loves you keep moving on don't worry [Applause] praise the Lord there's a just my famous I like reading this at my own mother's date it's the others bear with me this would be the last statement now dismiss musicians y'all can just make your way forward and I want to pull this this is gonna be for Mother's Day paragraph 87 just if y'all ever come to church on Mother's Day and I'm preaching y'all probably gonna hear this quote every time I just love it I love it then as we see him we would not be as we are now well know how to love him more will not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him well he will be more of a relative relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the mortal bodies and we'll have a body like his glorious bodies we know how to worship Him and when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deform Street now Oh we'll understand then why his power healed us the questions that's been in our mind how can he do it what with this somehow mysteriously they'll they'll all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds will it be this could it be somehow another majestic fingers we're just untangle unravel those knots and it all fade into the one big crown of love and you know I'm under I'm under expectation for that I know some of y'all mothers y'all want to see our children right now serving God but one day those those those those majestic things not they'll get a charge from the theophany hallelujah I want to skip down the paragraph 93 says if you're a little weak link that has separated this great family reunion at that date now now before it before I give you that quote just leave it there is talk about how mama loves loved it when all the kids grow up and they leave home mama looks forward to moments where she can have family dinner and bring all the kids back around the table and it's just something about having the kids home again but a lot of times when they come home they're not coming home body itself they're coming home with some with some old people they got their own little families they got mates they got all of this then they bring them back but nonetheless mama liked to have a chair for everybody and a plate for everybody praise the Lord amen sososo and when mama gets to feeling that way what you want to have the kids home make sure get daddy on the phone call and make sure that they coming make sure they come make sure they're gonna be because dinner will not be the same if one child is missing hallelujah now if you feel that way about earthly dinner how do you think God feel about a heavenly dinner right hallelujah heaven won't be the same if one child is missing somehow someway they're gonna get a charge from a theophany if you are that little weak link that has separated this great family reunion at that pain may the God of heaven this morning somehow in a mysterious way unravel those little knots that's tired of your mind and reveal to you the love that he has for you may you come sweetly to serve Him while we think on these things let's pray just before we pray and you have your heads bowed I'm gonna ask you on
