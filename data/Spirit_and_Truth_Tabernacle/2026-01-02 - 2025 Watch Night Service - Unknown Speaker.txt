Does anyone [music] have a testimony tonight? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you. God bless you, church. &gt;&gt; I want to thank God because he protected me from a car accident um yesterday on my way back home after work. I want to thank him for that. Um I saw um the car was coming on my back and then I'm like, where is this car going? because it was uh wash hours so there was a lot of car in the street. I'm like where you going? I don't know how it just pass and then I'm like where? There's a car right next to me. I don't know where the car how he can go. I'm like if that car hit me I wouldn't make it. I I know I wouldn't make it because he was driving really fast and I really thank God for that. And then even when I get to the community, another co I'm like, "Oh, let me go home because I have service too." And then I want to see the next year. So I thank God for that. He protected me and my family. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is a protector. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your purpose is your protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Does anybody else have a testimony you like to share tonight? God bless you, Sister Sarah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I just want to thank God for keeping me this year. It's a definitely a trying year by the way. It was definitely a trying year um with just trying to balance school and work and just life and responsibilities was definitely was a lot on on [snorts] me mentally and just physically just definitely very tired. But um the scripture that I was holding on to this year was um I think it's Joel 2:21. I should have had my phone but um it's a scripture that says be glad and rejoice land for the Lord will do great things. And of course you know the rest of that chapter is we have as a church have been holding on to when it comes to restoration. And so I definitely saw a lot of restoration in my life in different areas, not only just for me, but in family members. I've had cousins and just old friends reaching out talking about how they want to, you know, get back to serving God. And um even just, you know, seeing restoration within my immediate family with my sister and her husband. um restoration and finances or even just provision and finances because it was a lot of times I didn't know how I was going to make it. But God really just, you know, he made a way out of now way for me this year. And I just thank him for restoration even in my spiritual life, you know, giving me the joy of my salvation and just, you know, taking me from the beginning of the year to the end of this year. And just honestly, when I tell you I don't know how I made it, I really don't know how I made it. [laughter] Um, another thing that I really want to thank God for was something that um was just something I desired. It wasn't not necessarily a big thing, but it's just something that I really desired. And one of those was uh um in school I wanted to get all A's one semester. And so I was able to do this this last semester. I didn't have bad grades the other semesters. It's just something I really wanted in order to have honors when I graduate. Um, so I just I thank God for that because even though it's seems small and it's like I wouldn't have failed either way, but it's just something I really wanted. Um, so I thank God for that. I have two more classes to go and then I'll be done. Thank God. UM, [applause] and I definitely want to give him the thanks for giving me the ability to pay to go to school because I really didn't want any student loans. Um, so I thank God honestly for providing a way for me and I definitely didn't lack and I just thank God so much for that. Um, that was it. God bless you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] The Lord is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure we all have a testimony &gt;&gt; about what the Lord brought us. Sister, come on, sister. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I want to thank God for bringing me, my family through this year. For me personally, it was incredibly rough. Um, very painful. Not painful. Yeah, painful at some parts, but mainly just hard. I had to deal with passing my program and my job was giving me really hard time. Um, they were cutting my hours. Oh, they've been cutting my hours and I just can't afford that being in school. So, after graduating, um, I was applying to different jobs and today I got hired a new job AND [applause] my other job texted me and said that they actually don't need me to come in tomorrow because the census is low. And I said, actually, just take me off the schedule. So for good. [applause] SO &gt;&gt; YEAH, I'm very thankful for God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I want to testify. &gt;&gt; You brought me through [singing] this. &gt;&gt; You brought me through that. Lord, I'm grateful.

Um we are going to the book of Joel, uh which was a scripture that has carried us for roughly two years. and and as um the last time I spoke um uh at church, I didn't finish uh one sermon, and we'll get to that later on. Uh but I had something else I just wanted to share here uh tonight, and then um uh we'll we'll move on. But let's let's read Joel 1 uh and then verse 4 and then we'll go to verse chapter 2. It says in verse 4, chapter 1 says, "That which the palmer worm hath left hath the locust eaten, and that which the locust hath left, hath the cankerworm eaten, and that which the cankworm had left, hath have the caterpillar eaten." Over in chapter 2, uh, starting at verse, uh, 21. Amen. Thank God for his promises. Uh, fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great things. &gt;&gt; Uh, be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month, and the and the floor shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. Uh, we know God did that. We know God did that. Uh, and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker worm, and the caterpillar and the palmer worm, my great army, which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God, that have dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. Ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God. And none else, and my people shall never be ashamed. And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit uh upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions, and also upon the servants, and upon the handmmaids. In those days will I pour out my spirit. uh says, "And I will show wonders in the heavens and the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon uh into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord hath said uh and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call." Let's pray quickly. Father, we thank you for the ability to read the scripture. We pray the Holy Spirit would just make uh the word alive to us even tonight that God you would just minister to uh every heart. Um and uh just uh those present, those that are online uh just for remember each one, Father, in their respective places. We thank you for the opportunity to be able to gather. you have kept us throughout this year and God you have provided uh over and over for us Lord and we're just grateful for your goodness for your mercy that has been given to us and Lord we just uh we could never repay you for all the the great things that you've done uh for us. So we pray that you bless Lord this this portion of the service. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. Uh just let me give um um uh my greeting from uh from Ghana. Amen. Many of the saints sensed the greeting uh to you and uh we certainly had a wonderful time while we were there. Uh as we were preparing to go, we were supposed to leave on Sunday. Uh right after service, we jumped in the car to go to the uh airport and we got there and uh when we were trying to check in and give our luggage to the uh counter, they told us that uh hey, you need um you need a visa. I said, "Well, no. I've been to Ghana times and typically we get the visa on arrival." They said, "No, not this time. You're going to need the visa before you go." and they say you're going to need to, you know, um, go to this website, you're going to need to do this. And so they talking, my wife went to the website and found out that the process would be months before we get that visa. And uh, I said, "Look, uh, that ain't going to work. We need we need something different, you know, some other option here." And uh, so calls begin to be made. Uh, brother Quinton was all set. He was already getting on the plane and taking off. And uh me and my wife and sister Sarah was stuck right here. And and but we made some phone calls and found out on the other side uh we had a a brother uh that used to be brother Quinton's pastor up in um in in in Maryland. His name um brother Augustine. He had some connections and he uh began to he said in the morning we'll have your have your visas the numbers to you in the morning. I said well that that'll be fine. Uh, so we rebooked for to leave out on Tuesday and just waiting on things to get settled on on on um on Monday. And finally on Monday, the pastor got involved and he made a few phone calls and and they had them visa numbers to us in about two hours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. AMEN. [applause] So by the grace of God, we got on the plane. I got it all We got it sorted out on Monday. got on the plane and made it there on uh on uh we left Tuesday, made it there on Wednesday. Uh and uh you know and it was just um you know really my we we we kind of hit the ground running and um you know and just we just we thank God we had a fight going and then a fight coming back home and uh so we we got you know through the services and had a wonderful time you know with the saints. But when we finished the last service, we, you know, we get on the plane to come home and and we noticed that they've changed our route, you know, on the plane and we were supposed to fly from Ghana to back to Atlanta. Well, they say they're going to take us to New York and then to Atlanta and and and then we'll come home. Well, because of the changing of the route, we missed our connecting flight in Atlanta to be able to get home on Monday. And uh so we're, you know, we get there almost midnight into Atlanta. Uh and um you know, everything's closed, you know, pretty much. So um we uh we said, "Okay, well, you know what? What's what do we need to do here?" And they said, "Well, we can give you a hotel room." And and I said, "Okay." I say, "My flight is 7:00 the next morning. Um I really don't want to have to go to a hotel and then come back here at 5:00 in the morning. I'm only get about 4 hours in the hotel. I say, "Do y'all have a a day room or something I can use?" I said, "We don't we don't provide them. Y'all need to provide them cuz uh so we decided we'll go ahead and try to take the hotel." But my god, uh, we weren't prepared for the weather. &gt;&gt; And we went out there trying to wait on the buses to take us to the hotel. And and as we got out there and I'm in that weather and I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know what it was, but it was cold." And uh, and I How much was it? &gt;&gt; 30 30 something. I ain't have nothing to deal with. No. 30° weather and uh and that that cold hit your body, &gt;&gt; everything be &gt;&gt; and I stood out there and the bus didn't come and y'all know I'm getting my patience level as I get older start dropping where the bus at. And I said, "Okay, that's it. I'm going back into the airport. I'm going just have to sleep in the airport." But they had us wait about 40 minutes in that cold. And I felt it all all over. So, uh you know, but we made it, you know, we went back and slept on the floor in the um in in the in the airport. And uh we tried to sneak into the what do they call that? &gt;&gt; The chapel. It was warm in that chapel. And we went in that chapel and found ourselves a back of the chapel. And and I I told I told y'all be sleeping in church. So, y'all might as well sleep, right? But somebody come and kicked us out the chapel. I said, "Lord have mercy. Devil just fighting." So, you know, we finally get through the TSA and and and get on the plane and and we get all the way here and and when I get here, um I noticed that my luggage is the only luggage missing. &gt;&gt; I said, "Boy, that devil, he going to fight. But uh God gave us a victory. They brought my luggage to my house and and and and and we made it through. So I tell you sometimes you you go on trips like this and you know and it ain't all fun and games. You got to be ready for a trial, you know, but God brings us through and you know he gets all the glory no matter what. So we we're we're happy just to be back home. Amen. And and and and and they say ain't no place like home. I I say amen to that. Amen to that. But but it's good to be be back here. Amen. So, um I heard Sister Kesha earlier. God bless you. So good to have you with us. Amen. On on tonight. [applause] Praise the Lord. Amen. My sister, so good to see you, Sister Gina. Amen. Tonight. And [applause] and and brother Derek, God bless you. Amen. So good to see you tonight, brother. Praise [applause] God. Amen. Um, we have a just a a little something that I that I I have uh uh the Lord just kind of put in my heart to to do tonight. Uh I will be sharing just a little bit here um on a little thought. Easter for the bride. Amen. Easter for the bride. Uh but uh I will only go so far and then I am going to um turn this mic over to brother Simba. Amen. And and brother Simba is going to recap uh the last two years of this our restore sayeth the Lord. Get back in step. So he's going to recap that. So if you all would just bear with me, let me just give you just a little bit here of this Easter for the bride. We have read our scripture here out of Joel 1 as well as Joel 2. And uh when I think of the word Easter, uh Easter to me is the very thing that separates Christianity from any other religion. Amen. And no matter what people call themselves following, Easter is where Jesus proved who he was. Amen. He he said certain things, amen, out of his mouth, certain prophecies. But when Easter occurred, it actually proved that he was who he said he was. Amen. Uh there is many uh people that follow some leader like we follow Christ but their leader is in a grave somewhere and has not risen again. But Jesus said uh in John 2:19 he said um Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up." Hallelujah. And in three days he did exactly what he said. In Matthew 17:22, it says, "And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, the Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands of man, and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again." And they were exceeding sorry. But uh when he told them in that prophecy that he'd be raised in 3 days and he manifested it, hallelujah, at the resurrection, uh then we know Jesus proved who he said he was. Now there were certain scriptures that I just read here in Matthew 17 and John 2. Uh these scriptures were pertaining to uh Jesus rising from the dead. Amen. We can look back on it and see that now a prophecy went forth and then it was manifested when he got up on the third day. Hallelujah. But I'm here tonight to also just mention to you that just as there were scriptures uh for our Lord Jesus to manifest, there are also scriptures that will be manifested by the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. There is an Easter that comes for the bride. There's a resurrection time that comes for the bride. The same way it happened for the bridegroom, it also happens for the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can tell you over the last two years, there's been some people that have experienced their own personal eas. &gt;&gt; Amen. They come up out of some things that the devil might have had them bound in. Hallelujah. But tonight, when you look back, Amen. on how far God brought you, Amen. You can say I had my own Easter. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just like the devil can hold him down. Amen. The devil can hold you down. &gt;&gt; Just like the devil can hold him back, the devil can't hold you back. Amen. You got joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Despite your test, despite your trials, Amen. You still got joy. Hey, after all the things that I'VE BEEN THROUGH, HEY, I STILL GOT JOY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's because I've had MY OWN PERSONAL EASTER. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There there are scriptures that pertain to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're identified in this. And sometimes you don't even realize that you're a part of, amen, what God has spoken as prophecy in the scripture. We don't even realize we're included in that. And when you are included, I'M TALKING ABOUT IN GOD'S MIND THAT HE HAD YOU INCLUDED IN THAT SCRIPTURE. He might not have wrote your specific name. Hallelujah. But you CAN TELL THAT THAT SCRIPTURE BELONGS to you. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN JOEL 2:25, AMEN. AND IT SAYS, "I will restore to you." WHO IS TO YOU? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It might not HAVE YOUR SPECIFIC NAME, BUT YOU KNOW IT BELONGS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'LL RESTORE TO YOU the years that the locust hath eaten. The cankerorm and the caliper, the palmer, my great army which I sent amongst you. This is your scripture. &gt;&gt; It has to be FULFILLED IN YOUR DAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S a it's a Easter OR RESURRECTION FOR THE PRIDE. HE SAYS, "AND YE SHALL EAT IN PLENTY." HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And when I tell you that that that that probably stood more out to me during our meetings because, you know, we had a a few people that was concerned about who was preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's going to preach the meetings? And I never let nobody know who preaching. &gt;&gt; The reason I do that is because I want you to come under expectation. &gt;&gt; If I give you the name to it, then you can kind of decide, you know, I don't know if I want to hear that brother or not. No, I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SPIRIT. JUST JUST COME JUST KNOWING THAT THE HOLY GHOST GOING to take over THE MEETING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT BUT THE ONE THING I CAN TELL THE PEOPLE IS THAT WE'RE UNDER AMEN. an inspiration for our meetings. And what the Lord HAS TOLD US IS THAT YE SHALL EAT IN PLENTY. &gt;&gt; AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FOR TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN EATING IN PLENTY. &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY DID IT SAY WE'LL eat in plenty, SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE SATISFIED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND BE SATISFIED AND PRAISE the name of the Lord your God THAT HAVE DEALT WONDROUSLY WITH you and my people shall never be made ashamed. Another scripture that belongs to you in this hour. Hallelujah. JUST AS JESUS HAD SCRIPTURES connected to him, I'm telling you, there are scriptures that are connected to you as the bride of Christ. Another scripture is Malachi 4:5 and 6. Behold, I will send &gt;&gt; you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is you? &gt;&gt; Amen. And behold, I was sending you, ELIJAH. WELL, WHAT THIS TELLS ME THAT ELIJAH DIDN'T COME FOR EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH ONLY CAME TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN THE SCRIPTURE, THEN YOU KNOW GOD WAS SPEAKING of you. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. THESE ARE SCRIPTURES THAT BELONG TO THE BRIDE. And therefore, the bride had to have her own Easter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IN ORDER TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE SCRIPTURE, THE BRIDE HAD TO have her own Easter. here in the message restoration of the bride tree. Uh this is actually the last paragraph uh of the sermon. Brother Brandham goes into a prayer line after this. But uh and it's closing prayer and a prayer line. But the last uh uh uh quote there, but the evening light shall rise in the west. It says what for? To to to shine upon the word. What? to ripen the fruit, bring forth the bride tree with the same signs, wonders, and fruits they had at the beginning. Now, I I I like that. I like that because the evening light comes and it shines. Amen. Uh um on us here in the west, just like it did at the those I mean those in on in the east. So, uh somebody made a a a a statement here recently and I thought it was really good. If you ever, you know, I'm I'm one that I like fruit. Amen. You know, some fruit. Not all, but I I do like I like I like a good mango. Uh praise the Lord. I don't mind oranges and, you know, uh things like that. And uh grapes, you know, fruit. I I I like a lot. But it's one thing about fruit. Amen. Um you can you can get a fruit that looks real. It looks like it's ripe. It look like it's ready &gt;&gt; and then you go to cut it and go to eat it and find out this thing ain't ready at all. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going to tell you when you really got in your mouth uh that you already got the taste in your mouth, you ain't even tasted it yet. And you like, man, I can't wait to cut into this thing. And you know, I can't wait. I mean, cut this watermelon open and and and and you cut that thing open and look at it like, oh Lord. I mean either either it's not it's not ripe enough, it's bitter, IT SHOULD BE SWEET. IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN FRUIT has not reached the stage where it's ripe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CHURCH in the church world is that the church has reached a stage where it WAS NOT [screaming] RIPE. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T FULLY RIPE. AMEN. BUT IT'S ONLY IN THIS HOUR THAT THE CHURCH COULD COME TO complete ripeness. AMEN. WHERE GOD CAN GET THE BEST OUT OF THE FRUIT. IT'S ONLY IN THIS HOUR THAT GOD CAN DO THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS THIS, "BUT THE EVENING LIGHT SHALL RISE in the west. Wherefore to shine upon the word, what to ripen the fruit, bring forth THE BRINE tree with the same signs, wonders, and fruits that they had at the beginning. It shall be light in the evening time." Right. All right. Oh, the word will bring forth its fruit in its season. It shall not wither, but it'll bring forth its fruit, David said, in its season. Amen. SAME FRUIT IT HAD AT THE BEGINNING. NOW, I want to I want to just camp there just for a little bit. YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, AMEN. UM, the gifts, amen, have have left the church. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in that at all. I believe that the same gifts that we see in the book of Amen of Corinthians and also in you know and what happened on the on the day of Pentecost in THE BOOK OF ACTS THOSE THINGS ARE supposed to still be manifesting in the church today. The only thing is they just need to be in order. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And and other thing is they need to be uh with a a WITH A LIFE BEHIND IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE KNOW GIFTS AND CALLINGS ARE WITHOUT REPENTANCE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLK, EVEN BROTHER RANDOM START IN THIS DAY. I MEAN, HE RUN ACROSS THEM TWO MEN FROM A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH MANIFESTED IN GIFTS, BUT ONE WAS LIVING A DEMONIC LIFE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT THAT TYPE OF GIFT ANYMORE. WE WANT IT to be the real thing. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AND I JUST I HONESTLY FEEL I KNOW WE HAVE GIFTS ALREADY IN OUR CHURCH. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALREADY PROVEN THAT THROUGH THIS SEASON. AMEN. THAT THESE GIFTS ARE RIGHT HERE. BUT WHAT WE GOING THROUGH IS THAT THAT THE DEVIL HAS BEEN TRYING TO BLOCK. AMEN. AND BIND UP THOSE GIFTS. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] BUT I'M HERE TO TELL THE DEVIL THAT IF THERE'S A PROMISE THAT THESE THINGS WILL BE RELEASED, THEN WE GOING TO HAVE OUR OWN PLACE WHERE they can be released. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. WE GOING TO STOP GOING THROUGH THE WILDERNESS AND GOING FROM AMEN. FROM CITY TO CITY. WE GOING TO GET OUR OWN PLACE and be established. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE THAT WHEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM GIFTS JUST JUST GOING FORTH LIKE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And they're going to be done in decency and in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't believe it's supposed to be anything short of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. So, SO HERE HE SAYS THIS now what what uh with with this word in his predestined stage as he's got it now. And we see these words all being manifested. What is it? It's a perfect vindication that the coming of the Lord is at hand. And the time when he said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all that them cankerorms, all the all that the Methodist left, all that the caterpillar has eaten, all that done after they stripped it down, but I'll restore in the evening time." He says, "Oh my." Woo. So, I believe that we are living in this time of restoration. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The prophet told us, amen, that uh the palm worm, the cankerworm, the locust uh and the caterpillar, they moved through the the stages of the or the church ages, I should say. They moved right through the church ages. The Catholic Church was the first church that organized. They persecuted those that would not agree with them. And uh it says four death messengers, which was the palmer, the cankorworm, the locust, and the caterpillar. Those four death messengers took life from the the tree. But the four life messengers brought the life back into the tree. And the fir the first life messenger was Luther. He began the process of restoration by preaching. Amen. The just shall live by faith. And then Wesley comes along and carried the baton to the next age with sanctification. And then the Pentecostals came along and brought the joy of the Lord through the manifestation of gifts. Hallelujah. Look, I believe that the just still live by faith. I mean, I believe I believe in justification. I believe in sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe in the restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because we made it to the fourth stage don't mean that we lost all these other things. WE GOT THAT PLUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So justification, sanctification, the manifestation of the gifts &gt;&gt; and we also have the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Because that fourth stage or the fourth messenger of life was Malachi 4. He was to restore the truth and our hearts will be turned back to that truth. And I'd like to say this. Amen. Because he said that I will send you Elijah. Glory to God. You know what that does? That make you a part of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. That make you a part of the predestinated word for this day. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going tell you, when you can see yourself in the scripture, then you know where you stand. &gt;&gt; You know where you stand. I mean, Jesus could tell him, say, "Search the scriptures. Look at this. Look at that." And and we can say the same thing. Look at THE SCRIPTURE. IT SPEAKS OF ME BEING HERE. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU." HE WAS THINKING ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE ALREADY KNEW THAT. HE AND HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT MY NAME THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS MANY OF US THAT WERE GOING TO BE YOU. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND WE'RE HERE TO MANIFEST THIS WORD FOR OUR DAY. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's been an Easter &gt;&gt; for the bride. All right. Let me go back to uh another little statement that we read in this journey this side of the sermon proving his word. Uh brother Brandham said notice it was by his believers that he proves his word. And and and this is this is the thing. It's it's the word can only be proven by believers. &gt;&gt; Unbelievers will never prove it. &gt;&gt; Uh make believers will never prove it. But believers will prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. All God had to have is just one you. &gt;&gt; That's all God need is one you. That when he says, "Behold, I send you." He only need one. ONE PERSON THAT WILL RECEIVE IT, &gt;&gt; ONE PERSON THAT WILL ACCEPT IT, ONE PERSON THAT will believe it. And then God's word is made manifest through that one person. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, you know, as we journeyed for the last two years uh through this uh get back in step and our restore, sayith the Lord, that's been our uh journey. Uh it it is it is to me very obvious that God has manifested himself in our midst. &gt;&gt; Very obvious to me that God has manifested himself in our midst. I was um telling uh brother Simba back there, I said, you know, I don't know how long it's been since I heard Sister Boyd sing. &gt;&gt; I don't know how long it's been, but I say to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; I I I say to God be the glory. [applause] Well, that I it it took me way back, you know, uh you know, year years where just coming up in church. She she was one of the ones that used to sing a specials in the church. And to see her get up here and sing that tonight, I'm like, "Praise, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." God God is God is doing great things. When I see Sister Zion come up here and giving her testimony, &gt;&gt; oh my sir, &gt;&gt; I I I know what restoration look like. &gt;&gt; Uh when I when I I I see sister Chenise, I know what restoration look like. When I see Nehemiah on the drums, &gt;&gt; I I know what restoration looked like. &gt;&gt; Uh I I I it just all around us. &gt;&gt; When I when I can share with you a testimony that I I baptized my my son-in-law &gt;&gt; this year. &gt;&gt; I know what restoration look like. [laughter] &gt;&gt; God has manifested this in our midst, right? And and I I believe you know, brother brother Sim as he caps things off, he might remind us of some things that we might have forgot about. But uh but but God proves his word through his believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's been proving it through his believers through this through this season. He says uh it was by his believers that he proves his word. He can only prove his word, not by unbelievers. It it's only by the believers that he can prove his word. No matter how much the rest of them claim to be, "Oh, I believe, brother. See, if you do, God will prove it so. Cuz we look and see the others. How can we say then? See, it's by true believers that he proves his word. Not by those who say they believe, but those who really believe. It's by his believing children that he proves his word. Now, no. Now, he had the believers, the old crop had died off. The unbeliever who said, "We couldn't take it." He let every one of them perish. Why? Every one of them. the believers who was left. Moses had been taken to uh uh taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children. They were only uh they they were there they were only two that crossed over and that was the believers Joshua and Caleb. THEY WAS THE BELIEVERS. THEY WAS THE ONE WHO CROSSED OVER. IT'S THE ONLY WAY GOD CAN DO IT IS by his believing children. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. His believers was the ones that done it. He used them to cross over with. See says now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age. He does it every time by the same method. He has to take believers. And then in order to have believers to meet that word, HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE IT TO THAT AGE. That mean God had to God God had to have God knew he would have believers in an age and he had had to predestinate those believers to come to this age. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Man, THIS IS THE HARDEST AGE TO live in. &gt;&gt; This is the most difficult age to live in. BUT YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW SOMEWAY, WE STILL GOT VICTORY IN THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON, WE STILL GOT VICTORY IN THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE DON'T HAVE TO LOWER THE STANDARDS OF THE WORD &gt;&gt; IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET VICTORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE KEEP THE STANDARD LIFTED HIGH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND AND AND I'M TELLING YOU, GOD GOT A HOLY GHOST THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH &gt;&gt; TO GIVE YOU VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE IT TO THE AGE. YOU SEE, HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE THIS thing to be there to MEET THE CHALLENGE OF the age. Glory to God. There there's a there's a tremendous challenge of the age, you know, and and and and one of the one of the challenges is that you can't approach God just just with head knowledge. &gt;&gt; Intellect. &gt;&gt; Look look, you can't figure God out in intellect. &gt;&gt; Ain't no way. I mean, his his ways are too so so much higher than our our ways. His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. His ways are beyond our comprehension. That's right. &gt;&gt; You got to take God by faith. &gt;&gt; THAT MEAN WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT, &gt;&gt; you got to TAKE GOD AT FAITH. NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW I CAN EXPLAIN THAT I am predestinated TO THIS AGE BECAUSE I JUST READ YOU SCRIPTURES OF ME BEING IDENTIFIED THERE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. He says, um, he's going to have A CHOSEN GENERATION. HE TALKING ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN THAT THAT THAT SCRIPTURE WAS WRITTEN FOR ME, A A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, THAT WAS MY SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but here, you know, we we can we can we can we can we can see these things clearly, BUT THERE SOMETIME THERE'S THINGS THAT COME amen along the road that you might not have an explanation for. &gt;&gt; And that's okay. I got a God that can take care of that. AND AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT MY GOD. THINGS THAT I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND right now, don't let that BE NOTHING TO SHAKE ME. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; There are things I might not clearly see right now and I don't I I don't have to be SHAKEN BY IT BECAUSE AMEN. THAT IF I JUST WALK BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT, &gt;&gt; GOD WILL EVENTUALLY REVEAL THAT THING TO ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT. UH-HUH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST KEEP HOLDING ON TO WHAT WHAT YOU GOT. JUST A LITTLE BIT [screaming] YOU GOT IS ENOUGH TO CARRY YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God wants you to walk by faith and not by sight. &gt;&gt; That That's the way believers That's the way believers walk. They I mean they they live they live by faith. Hallelujah. But here he says this um uh he he he he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age. Did did did he says did it get you? He's got to predestinate this thing to meet the challenge of the age. Did it get you? Did you feel it? Did you see it? He says, do you understand it? That's what's happening today. He predestinated it to this by his fornowledge. When he predestinated Malachi 4, it's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, he goes on. He says when he come over and predestinate anything to happen in his word, he had to prove his word to be so. when he predestined anything to happen and says it will happen. He knows that seed will be there just at that time. &gt;&gt; Just guess what? You were the seed that was supposed to be there at that time. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And a and God knew that's why you know this whole scripture say my my great army which I sent among you. &gt;&gt; The palmer worm the caterpillar locust you know this is a great army that God he sent it and God knew that these what these things would do to us along the journey. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But even in knowing what these ant what this insect was going to do along the journey he put a promise on the other side of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; After you've been struck down by a palmer worm, &gt;&gt; after you've been uh taken to pieces by uh a a canker worm, &gt;&gt; and and you know, and and it's like the devil the devil the devil ain't a ain't satisfied just sending a palmer and a cakeworm, man. He go in the locust stage, &gt;&gt; I mean, the thing look useless already, &gt;&gt; but he ain't done with it yet. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE DEVIL'S JOB TO STEAL, KILL, and &gt;&gt; destroy. SO AFTER THEY GET INTO I MEAN PALMER, canker worm, locust, he takes it to caterpillar phase. Man, he going to eat THE THE VERY LIFE OUT OF THIS THING. &gt;&gt; SOME OF US HAD THOSE TYPE OF EXPERIENCES. &gt;&gt; WE FELT LIKE WE were finished. &gt;&gt; That how we GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF THIS? &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT US NOW. UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; AND THE REASON THAT YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE NOW IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A PROMISE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOUR DEATH MESSENGERS. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; THE PROMISE ON THE OTHER SIDE IS HALLELUJAH. It's that I [screaming] will restore &gt;&gt; SAYITH THE LORD. NO MAN COULD BRING RESTORATION. HALLELUJAH. NO PREACHER COULD BRING RESTORATION. HALLELUJAH. NO POPE CAN BRING RESTORATION. ONLY GOD HIMSELF CAN BRING RESTORATION. ONLY GOD CAN REACH IN AND PULL US OUT OF SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WE WERE IN. [screaming] MAMA COULDN'T DO IT. DADDY COULDN'T DO IT. BUT GOD DID. &gt;&gt; WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE PRODUCTS &gt;&gt; OF GOD'S PROMISE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; OH, blessed be the name of the Lord. I know I am. I'm a product of his promise. That's the REASON I'M HERE TONIGHT. BECAUSE I'M A PRODUCT OF THIS. &gt;&gt; God predestinated me to be there TO MEET THE CHALLENGE &gt;&gt; SIR &gt;&gt; THAT WAS COMING in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Let me move on here. I want to just um just drop this. Amen. You know, we we we as I said, we we we we've seen so much. Um God I believe God has proven u this inspiration for our church. It might not have been for anybody else, but God has proven there's so much that happened along the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So much that happened. And um this this to me is is is nothing but an Easter that we've experienced. And you know and and there's a statement here that that brother Brandham made out of the restoration of the bride tree. He says um it started growing and what it do denominated. So God pruned them off, bound them up, laid them back, let them go ahead and organize. Then the next one come up and he's talking about each age, right? So Luther's time uh uh it was a reformation. It was the beginning of a restoration cycle, but it was a reformation. But they got organized, denominated, and God left it. Right? God left. God God leaves. Anything that's denominated, God leaves it. Because what happens that they start putting periods on the word of God, they believe this and no more. That's how we got so many different denominations. But we don't want to be denominated. And and I'll be the first one to admit to you that even in our message, we have to be so careful. Uh people have tried to denominate this message. That's why anytime you see anybody get a group started with some some catchy something, &gt;&gt; it never lasts &gt;&gt; and it never will last &gt;&gt; because this cannot be denominated. &gt;&gt; Bottom line, it will never be you that might it might take 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, but it will it will fall apart. And any group that I've seen rise up with any little special thing, I've just watched it. This group fell apart. that group felt especially after the lead of the group dies. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; If it's but if it's on the word &gt;&gt; see that's that's the thing brother Brandham was on the word that's why you still see it's still moving forward. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it was false it would have fell apart long time ago. Now now look you going to have false people that come and get a hold of it &gt;&gt; and they going to produce some false stuff. But you got to and I I just thank God not that we had to because the scripture actually says that uh if it were possible it would deceive the very le but since it was not possible we might be in a situation for a number of years. Hallelujah. But because there's a predestinated seed there &gt;&gt; GOD WILL ALLOW SOMETHING TO HAPPEN &gt;&gt; TO PULL US OUT OF THAT TO PUT US WHERE WE NEED to be so we can experience the restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord, I thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I belong to him. I ain't got nothing to worry about. &gt;&gt; Amen. He I I am his responsibility. &gt;&gt; Let me go on right here. He says this. He says, "Let them go ahead and organize." Then the next one come up. He bound them up, laid them off. Tree went on. Uh then he bound them up, laid them off. Now, one of these days they'll be burned. Says, "Bind them up. bind up their bind them up in their organization. But then what? Right in the top of the tree is where the fruit ripens first. That's right. Right in the top of the tree. So it's the top of the tree here that sees the evening light. I like that statement. It's the top of the tree that's going to see the evening light. my mama my mother when when we were coming up and had to go uh raid the mango trees. &gt;&gt; Mama wasn't you know and and you you a mango tree not all the fruit come get ripe at the same time. &gt;&gt; The ones at the bottom are green. And when you see them green like that, you already know don't even try to get that off that tree and eat that. You know something something's that that thing ain't ripe at all. It ain't it ain't had time to sit in the presence of the sun, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But the one at the top and it's turning colors, &gt;&gt; boy, that it got a little yellow in it, got a little red in IT FOR YOUR EYE, go right towards that. And you pick up a rock, a bottle, a stick, a anything. I'm going after that. And and and and mama was one that you know if if if if if she couldn't give it a rock, a bottle, amen, a stick, it was a little bit too high, she had some little fellas &gt;&gt; and y'all have to climb that tree. And and mama be pointing it out from the ground. &gt;&gt; Get that one. And I don't care how scared you are. you can get out there on that limb and get that one &gt;&gt; and be waiting at the bottom for that thing just to fall. Because if it if it's right now, if it's right, all you got to do is just just touch it, &gt;&gt; that thing going to come off that tree. Just just a little touch. &gt;&gt; And and and if you hit it with a rock or a bottle, you do you trying YOUR BEST NOT TO DAMAGE IT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HIT THE GROUND. YOU TRYING TO CATCH IT BEFORE it hit the ground, right? Because one of the things that make you upset THAT THING HIT THE ground and leave it done busted &gt;&gt; and and and hallelujah. If you if you the if you the one that got to go up there and look for another one, you don't you got this one but it fell and hit the ground and busted open. We can't use it. You got to go over here. [laughter] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ONES AT THE TOP OF THE TREE that that that that everybody be going after. THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE THAT THAT THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT HAS A IT IT'S SET IN THE PRESENCE of the su n &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS HOUR WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE S NAL &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE WE'VE SAT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE S O N IT'S IT'S NOW TIME TO TO COME FORTH IN EVERYTHING THAT HE'S supposed to bring forth in us. &gt;&gt; I believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that &gt;&gt; it says the top of the tree where the fruit ripens first. That's right. Right in the top of the tree. So, it's the top of the tree here that sees the evening light. That's something that's a powerful statement. Only the top of the tree going to see the evening light. Now, and and I've also had some green mangoes that got right. They didn't they never got the color, but on the inside they maybe it's because of the process they went through. They they got right and the only way you can tell because the outside will fool you. &gt;&gt; But the only way you can tell is you got to squeeze it. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you don't want God have to squeeze you, do you? &gt;&gt; You don't want God. You don't have to go through that spot process with God. The only way you know is when I squeeze it. Oh. And even sometime you can't even trust it &gt;&gt; because this thing green &gt;&gt; and that color green is telling me that this thing is not ripe &gt;&gt; but it's soft. Something ain't right here. &gt;&gt; And you go to cutting that thing open and next thing you know part of it rotten &gt;&gt; and part of it right because it never went through the full process. &gt;&gt; Don't waste our time. God God wants something to go through the proper process and and it's only the fruit at the top of the tree &gt;&gt; that's going to come to full maturity &gt;&gt; the right way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say this. Says, "Now Noah had three rooms in his ark. One room was for the creeping things. See, the second room was for the fowls, but the top room was where the light was." He says the light that shine first never come on the first floor or the second floor but on the top floor. See he says uh the tree he says he says uh the tree don't bear its fruit first at the bottom or the second like that. It was all pruned off in organization. But it's in the top part where I will restore saith the Lord. That's where the I will restore sayith the Lord is at the top part. It says, "I'll send forth the evening light. It'll bring back bring back the word, making it manifest. I'll restore all that I promised. All that I promised the same Holy Spirit will bring be and bear the same signs." This is why I say uh we're not losing what they got what Pentecost brought back. We This not a church that's that believe we should have lost that. No, that should be a part of our everyday experience. &gt;&gt; It just need to be done proper. That's all. &gt;&gt; That's all. He says this, "All that I promise, the same Holy Spirit will bring bear the same signs." And this is what this is where my thought comes from. I'll have an Easter, a resurrection for the bride. &gt;&gt; God said he going to have an Easter for his bride. I'm here to tell you tonight, you are a part of God's Easter &gt;&gt; for his brides. You are experiencing a a resurrection even when you don't want a resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will still give you one because if you are predestinated part of that word, there's nothing that can stop you from seeing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll have an Easter resurrection for the bride. The same as I had for the bridegroom. See, evening lights come out to shine. Same as the morning. The same signs, same things, the same light will produce the same truth that they had there. If if it's if it's shining on the same tree. Amen. proves his word is now fulfilled. I will restore saith the Lord. I say his word has certainly been fulfilled &gt;&gt; in spirit of truth tabernacle. &gt;&gt; I will restore saith the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; So I want to uh ask that our brother Simba would come. Amen. and he will recap, amen, this journey that we've had through restoration. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's welcome Brother Simba. Amen. TONIGHT [applause] God bless you saints. [sighs] It has fallen my lot to speak tonight. Uh, and uh, if if it was up to me, I would prefer that, you know, the the other brothers speak. Uh, but um, brother brother Jack uh, approached me and um, asked me if I could um, recap the last two years. And when he told me, I said, "Okay, uh, all right. Um, I guess I guess we'll see." But deep down inside, I was going, Come on, man. This is why I didn't want to be a deacon. But but um I was thinking about it and a part of me was ready to uh just let him know that I I was going to pass on it. Um but I remembered um this time last year he had also asked me to to to maybe say something and um he well he didn't ask he he made a suggestion. So he he just said, "Oh, I was thinking." And I said, "Oh, is that right?" Okay. And then I just never got back to him. So I felt uh maybe it was it was it was uh okay for me to take this one. Um how many can say we've we've eaten in plenty over the last two years? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's that's that's a reality for Spirit and Truth. We ate in plenty. Um, and not not only did we end eating plenty, but we were satisfied. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can how many can say we were satisfied? &gt;&gt; Amen. It reminds me of um Thanksgiving this this year. We were at um uh brother brother Jerry and uh sister Melissa's place and just as any Thanksgiving, there was a whole lot of food. Uh, and it was some good food and th those that would there would tell you we had we had uh some good food and so we had plenty to eat and it was it was one of the first times where I put food on my on my plate and you know sometimes you put you know a lot of food on your plate. You eat this and it's good. You eat that and it's good and you eat that and it's like h and you eat that it's like no I don't like that. And when you go to get you know second plate maybe you only get you know half the stuff that you got. But when when we were at their place, I I filled up my plate. I enjoyed every single thing that was on that plate. And I went back and got every single thing that I got the first time because it was good. And so I ate in plenty. And I was very satisfied. And when I got home, I kept telling my wife, I was saying, "Man, I I I really enjoyed that food." And that was because my belly was full, &gt;&gt; because I ate in plenty. And I was very satisfied. It's one thing to eat in plenty, but it's another thing to eat in plenty. and &gt;&gt; be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um to re So, my recap of course is of the inspiration over the last two years, and that's the I will restore inspiration. Um, brother Jack asked me to to do a recap and kind of uh give give like a summary of of the last two years. So, what I'm going to say today is is is nothing that you haven't already heard. uh hope you don't get tired of hearing that I will restore because it's it's it's a promise that we ought to hold on to in this day. And there was so much uh good eating uh in in this in this inspiration that just just one year wasn't enough to contain how much food we had. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we had the the inspiration uh spilling over from 2024 into 2025, right? It was it was it was there was there was a a surplus, right? there was an an overlap an an overflow right and an overflow is when the excess or surplus uh is not able to be accommodated by an available space right so now we moved the I will restore into 2025 because 2024 wasn't enough to accommodate what what what the inspiration has so it fell into 2025 and we had an overflow of the inspiration so now I'm uh I'm going to give a a summary and and one thing I learned in in college with a summary is when someone goes up and does their presentation, at the end of their presentation, they give a summary, right? And they highlight the key points of what they said. And a summary allows uh those that were listening to make sure they understood what was being said. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And not only that, I also realized because sometimes, you know, you you you you distracted when someone is presenting, right? Maybe I like in my case, I was trying to finish my own presentation when someone was presenting, right? So, I didn't catch every single thing, but when it came to the summary, it allowed me to be able to understand everything that the person has said in a in a quick recap. So, I'm I trust that tonight as I summarize, those that understood what was being said in the inspiration will make sure that they got the correct understanding of I will restore. and those that may have missed it for one one reason or the other will get to appreciate what God has done over the last two years. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and and and before I get started, I do have a disclaimer. Uh this is my first time standing in front of you. Um I uh I'm new to this. I have a lot of notes. I tried to cut them down. I don't know if I cut enough or I cut more than I needed to. So, I don't know where we're going to land on time, but I I promise that I won't hold you hostage. Um, so we'll we'll we'll start by reading um a scripture that we've we've been reading throughout the the the two years. Brother Jack just just read it. You don't you don't have to stand up. It was already read. So, I I'll just read it real quick. And that's um Joel 2 uh starting at verse uh 23. and says, "Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he had given you the former rain moderately. He will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, the and the latter rain in the first month, and the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust had eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, the palmer, my great army, which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. And he and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else, and my people shall never be ashamed. The second time he says, "My people shall never be ashamed. And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions, and also upon the servants, and upon the hand handmaids. In those days, I will pour out my spirit." Right? So when we talk of um restoration, the definition um uh uh of of of restoration, right, is the action of returning something to a former owner uh place or condition, right? And restoration is an attribute of God. And we see it throughout the Bible, right? We know God has different, you know, attributes. He's he's an omnisient God, right? Which means he's all knowing. He's an an an omnip omnipotent God, meaning he's present everywhere, right? He could be uh hh uh with with you uh uh healing your body while with me saving me from an accident while with someone else comforting them from loss, right? God is an omnipotent God, meaning he's present every that's an attribute of God. He's also immutable, meaning he's unchanging. So what he was yesterday, he is today and he will be tomorrow and forever more. Amen. He's an immutable God, right? He's a faithful God. He's a father. He's a a healer, a provider, right? But we're focusing right now on the the attribute of restoration. And we see it throughout the Bible through I think the prime example is the story of of Job, right? We see where his life started, right? And then what happened uh in the middle, all right? It took a it took most most of the book of Job is just, you know, the negative stuff that took place and then in the end we see that restoration, right? So he started somewhere, something happened and then he was restored back to where he was, right? Joseph, the story of Joseph. Um, we we see we see restoration when he gets to uh to Egypt. He was in a position of authority in Piper's house, right? Something happened. He ended up in prison, but he was restored back to a place of authority in in in in Pharaoh's house, right? Even more authority than he had before, right? We see it in the prodical son. He was he was in his father's house. He decided to move out of his father's house. And we know what happened there, but he returned back to his father's house. That was restoration. Even the story of Lazarus, we see a restoration. There was life and then death came and Jesus came to bring back that life. That's restoration, &gt;&gt; right? When we talk of so so so as human beings, right? There's two aspects of our lives, right? That that two aspects that our lives revolve around. That's the spiritual aspect, right? And the the the uh the natural uh aspect, right? And we have to attend to the needs of both, &gt;&gt; right? We have to attend to the spiritual needs and also the natural needs. Right? The on the natural you you you you your body needs food, right? You cannot go without food. At some point, you're going to need to put food in your belly, right? Your body needs rest. You can't just stay up all all day. At some point, you're going to need to rest, right? You need shelter, right? That's why we go to work so that we can have money to pay a rent or mortgage so that we have shelter. We're we're attending to our natural needs. So, when we wake up in the morning, get dressed, and go to work, that's because we're attending to our natural needs, right? our spiritual uh uh is is the same as well. We read the Bible. That's because we want to attend to our spiritual needs, right? We go to church, we come to church, we we we pray, we listen to tapes, we we we fast, we fellowship with saints of like precious faith that's feeding the inner man, right? That's feeding the spirit. Amen. So now when it comes to restoration, we must understand that restoration applies to the spiritual and to the natural, &gt;&gt; right? It's not it's not just on the spiritual nor is it just on the natural only. Right? So when we say amen, we must say amen to the spiritual and we must say amen to the natural. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So so when it comes to the spiritual aspect, we'll start with the spiritual aspect. Uh brother Brandham um mentioned to us as as brother Jack has already u spoken about at at Pentecost uh he brother Brandham says at Pentecost God planted a tree, right? And that tree was supposed to bring forth fruit. Amen. But we know that according to the word that tree got attacked by the palmer, right? The locust, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, right? The four death messengers, right? They attacked the tree, &gt;&gt; right? That was planted by God at Pentecost, right? And the brother Brandham goes on to say there were four death messengers, all right, that that ate away at that tree. Now, when restoration comes, there's going to be four life messengers. Amen. And the and as brother Jack already explained, justification, right, through through through Wes through through Luther, sanctification through Wesley, uh baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the restoration of gifts through Pentecost, and then the the word through Malachi 4, right? Those were the four life messengers. Amen. And now, why is restoration important, right? The reason the reason why restoration is important is because Jesus can't come back until restoration takes place. Amen. We must understand that Jesus cannot come back until restoration takes place. &gt;&gt; Now, why do I say that? &gt;&gt; Right? Why do we say Jesus cannot come back until the restoration takes place? Do you want to know why? &gt;&gt; Let me show you. Let's go to Acts 3. &gt;&gt; Uh we're going to read Acts 3 uh starting at verse 19. It says, "Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, &gt;&gt; which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. &gt;&gt; Now, this is this is Peter speaking, right? And he's he's explaining that u this Jesus uh uh heaven must receive him. is referring to what happened. So we know that when when when Christ died, he rose again, right? And when he rose again, he he um he he he showed himself to to some to to his disciples and a few others, right? And he was with them for a short period of time. And then in Acts one, we hear that um once he was done with his work here on earth, he ascended into heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. So that ascension is what Peter is talking about when he says the heavens must receive him, right? Until when? the time of restitution of all things. So for him to come back down as we're expecting, we must look for a restitution of all things, right? Which God has spoken um by the mouth of all his prophets since the world began. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the the uh Jesus also spoke about this restitution or restoration of all things in Matthew 17 uh starting at verse 11. He says, "And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come and restore all things." Amen. And this happened um uh after the transfiguration, right? When Jesus went went up with um Peter, James, and John uh if if if I'm not mistaken. And the transfiguration happened and Peter, James, and John saw something that caused them to start to wonder. &gt;&gt; They said, "Wait, well, don't the script, the scribes say, uh, Elias must first come, right?" And then Jesus said, "Yes, truly I say unto you." Right? Jesus answered them said, "And Elias truly shall first come and restore all things." Right? Now, he's talking about that restitution of all things. Right? But he goes on to say, "But I say unto you that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them." Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the part that may confuse a few people, right? And you can understand why. Because the Bible clearly says the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist, right? But by revelation and through reading the word, we know he was talking about two different comingings of Elias, right? Two different comingings of Elijah &gt;&gt; and and and the the the um the the the the the disciples understood that, right? And so because Jesus even even Jesus himself spoke about this restitution of all things and this restitution or restoration of all things must happen before Jesus comes back down for his second coming then that means if you are a a a a Bible reader right if you are a serious Christian right if you are if you are serious about the coming of the Lord you should be concerned about this restitution of all things &gt;&gt; right if you are serious you should be concerned about this restitution of all Right? And you shouldn't be confused with whether it was John or whe if you are a Bible reader, you should be concerned about the restitution of all things. Right? And when you look when you look at the scripture, uh we we we uh uh I believe brother Jack uh told us when when when when you were pre he was preaching on this and he said, you know, sometimes people will say, oh, it was it was it was uh John the Baptist that res that Jesus was talking about restoring all things. And he said, we you can just ask one question. Do we remember what that question was? &gt;&gt; What did he restore? What is it that John restored that you can listen to us so we understand that it really was John the Baptist? &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he restore? &gt;&gt; Right? And and and and on top of that, uh one of the disciples that was there when Jesus answered this question was Peter, &gt;&gt; right? Peter heard Jesus says saying, "Elias truly shall first come and restore all things." &gt;&gt; Peter was there. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter then in Acts uh uh uh uh uh three &gt;&gt; when Jesus is already gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus is already gone is talking about Jesus is coming back but not until the time of restitution of all things. If John fulfilled the restitution of all things, why good &gt;&gt; why would Peter, who was there when Jesus answered the question, Amen, be talking about a restitution of all things as a future event if it already happened in Jesus' time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter was there and he understood that this restitution of all things is a future event and that is what will allow the Lord Jesus Christ to come back a second time. &gt;&gt; I mean according to the word. Amen. So if you are a Bible reader, serious Christians, serious about the coming of the Lord, Amen. you should be concerned about this restitution of all things. Amen. And you being in the message makes you a part of the restoration. Amen. You are a part of restoration because as we heard about the life messengers, the justification, someone is going to have to be justified. Sanctification, someone's going to have to be sanctified. &gt;&gt; Uh baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and and and the gifts, someone is going to have to receive that Holy Ghost. Someone's going to have to express those gifts. Amen. And someone is going to have to receive the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so like brother Jack said, there is no restoration without you. Amen. The restoration requires you. Amen. If justification comes, sanctification comes, baptism of the Holy Ghost and and the gifts and the word comes and there's no you, then there is no restoration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So um that gives a restoration of the tree that was planted at Pentecost that justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts and the uh the revealed word. Right? We are we are res we we are looking for the restoration of that tree that was planted at pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we must understand what Pentecost had for us to um to see what we should have during uh this restoration right because restoration remember is returning something to its former condition. So we must understand what they had at Pentecost for us to understand what we need to look for or what we must have when that tree is restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everything that Pentecost had belongs to us, right? Everything that Pentecost had belongs to this time of restoration of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we look at Pentecost, uh one of the main things that we realize is at Pentecost they were in one accord. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; At Pentecost they were in one accord. Right? One of the things that were they were in one accord about is prayer. And we see that in Acts uh chapter 1 starting at verse 13. It says, "And then sorry, and when they were come in, they went up into an upper room where abode both Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, the son of uh Alfus, and Simon, Zelottes, and Judas, the brother of James. These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren. Right? So prayer being being uh in one accord in prayer is important, right? If we're looking to have the same results that they had at Pentecost, right? And brother Brandham says in um Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He says um then in every local church there's nine spiritual gifts right should be operating in that church if they're a good praying congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. If they're a good praying congregation. Right? So we cannot look for those nine spiritual gift if we're not a good praying congregation. &gt;&gt; Right now there's two facets or or two facets to prayer life. Right? And those two are uh your individual prayer, right? How you pray at home, &gt;&gt; right? How you pray in different situation as an individual, right? What you pray for for your individual needs or your family, your children, uh whatever it might be, your prayer closet, you fasting, you being in prayer as an individual. That's one facet, right? And the other facet is us coming in prayer together as a church, &gt;&gt; right? And just like with the spiritual natural, you cannot neglect one, right? You cannot focus on praying and say, "Oh, I I I I I I'm not attending the prayer meeting because I'm praying at home." &gt;&gt; They didn't say that at Pentecost. Had they said that at Pentecost, they wouldn't have had the same results. &gt;&gt; Right? So, when it comes to the your your your prayer life, right, there should be a balance between your individual prayer and you praying as a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. And and and we we we we ought to ask ourselves, right, as as spirit and truth, right? Are are we a good praying church? Right? &gt;&gt; Not not not only as an individual. Yes. Actually, as an individual, are you a good praying individual? &gt;&gt; But on top of that, are you a good praying church? &gt;&gt; Right. We have we have um prayer meetings twice every month. That's only two times in 30 31 days, &gt;&gt; right? It's I I don't believe it's too much to ask for if we want to see this level of power that they had at Pentecost. Two nights, right? two nights of prayer, right? We ought to give our best, right? We if if if only only only you know, you and God know how much effort you're putting into the prayer as a church, &gt;&gt; right? On only you know, only you can answer the question. But my question to you is, if God were to ask you, are you giving your best &gt;&gt; to praying as a church? What would your answer be? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What would our answer be? If if God asked us, are you why weren't you? How many times did you make it to pray in 2025? &gt;&gt; What was your excuse right now for of course you know sometimes people work during that time but if you know you know yourself you know whether you could have made it or not you know whether you have a a legitimate reason why you're not making it to prayer. Amen. We cannot expect these things yet we are not being a a praying a praying congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and I I I would hope that we we wouldn't be a church that because at the end of the day, the word of God is going to be to be fulfilled regardless, right? God is going to pour out his spirit on somebody, &gt;&gt; right? Let us not be the church that God looks at and says, "Ah, they're not ready. &gt;&gt; They're not a good praying church." &gt;&gt; Right? And he goes to the next one, they're ready, and he pours out his spirit. They're ready. He pours out the spirit. &gt;&gt; Right? So, we ought to take inventory and see are we are we really being a good uh uh praying congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we move to Acts 2 um starting at verse one, it says, "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting." Right? Now this time it doesn't say in one accord in prayer. It just says one accord in one place. Right? And to me one accord means people being in complete agreement. Right? Being united right all right in thought in purpose or action. Right? Essentially being uh of the same mind, same spirit, right? And to meh that encompasses unity, right? Brotherly love, fellowship, peace, right? No conflict amongst brethren. I don't believe that they they they they they they were up there and one didn't want to sit next to the other or they couldn't one couldn't fellowship with this one or they was they were there without unit. I believe when it says they were in one accord, they were of the same mind, same spirit, complete agreement, united in purpose and in action. &gt;&gt; Right? And brother Jack um made a comment and he said he said we we we we can't even start to talk about these spiritual gifts if we have no unity if we have no brotherly love if there's no fellowship amongst brothers and sisters. Right? And brother Quu made a statement. He said uh when there is division in the church there is no restoration. &gt;&gt; God is not going to restore where there's division here. This one doesn't hang out with that one. when this one uh uh uh is coming to to to to talk to the group, that one leaves. No, God is not going to to to to restore when there's division in the church. Amen. And and and I believe Brother Troy uh mentioned when he was preaching uh during this inspiration, he says, "When we have love for one another, it causes God to move." &gt;&gt; If we want to see God move, we ought to have love for one another. If we want to see a restoration of these gifts, we ought to love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then um we went through uh Pentecost, right? We we went through Pentecost as an experience experience, right? We we we we we know that Pentecost is not a denomination, but it's a truly an experience, right? We referred to Pentecost as being a denomination, but the true meaning of Pentecost is is is a Pentecostal experience, right? and and uh we went through the whole Pentecostal experience uh from the early 1900s, the Isuza Street revival, um William Seymour, you know, the the the moving of the spirit and what happened back then. Um how the spirit was moving uh um even how they were ridiculed. Um and then how they ended up denominating and in denominating they ended up misunderstanding the gifts and until those gifts have have been uh pretty much preached out of the church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But when it comes to restoration, restoration involves bringing back those things back into the church. &gt;&gt; But they have to be handled correctly. &gt;&gt; Right? They have to be handled correctly. That is why brother uh Quinton could come and then preach to us the power of responsibility, right? Because you have to be responsible. Amen. With the gifts that God has given us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I um he I believe he said he got the inspiration from from sister Abby getting a car from from her father. And and he said for her to receive a car from her father, he must have seen something that made him feel that she was mature enough to have a car, &gt;&gt; right? And we know that maturity comes with responsibility. The more you mature you mature, the more responsible you expected to be, right? I cannot expect uh um uh my little mason to have the same maturity and responsibility as uh say brother Josiah, right? There are different levels of maturity and because of that there are different levels of responsibility. Amen. Those two have a direct correlation, right? And so how we then handle those gifts will reflect our level of maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then after that, brother Quinton again came and and and Quinton Jr. came and preached to us about the spiritual gifts of the church, right? And he laid a wonderful foundation on the spiritual gifts of the church and told us that those gifts are here to edify the church. Amen. They're not here uh for for for us to have an individual gain, right? I don't have wisdom so that I can prosper, right? uh you don't have faith so that you can get things that I can't get but it's here to edify us and he gave us a very wonderful example that I still remember um he said when it comes to these gifts that that that edify the body they're there for one another and he used the example of faith and he said there are certain things we have different levels of faith right and there's se certain things someone may have a gift of faith right and I may have something that I need that's within reach within my faith's reach and I can reach out and get it. &gt;&gt; Right? There's certain things that maybe my I cannot reach the thing that I'm trying to get, &gt;&gt; but there's a brother somewhere that has the the the the faith height to reach that thing. Right? Just like a physical height. If I'm if I'm not tall enough to reach something, I can maybe reach out to my brother Garen because he's so tall and so he can reach whatever it is that I'm trying to get, right? And that's how it works with faith that someone may have a level of faith that makes it easy for them to reach out and get something that you're in need of. Right? These gifts are there to edify the entire body, right? And then brother Jack came and and and and took each and every one of those um uh uh uh gifts and dove deeper into each one. you know what wis the gift of wisdom is the gift of knowledge, the gift of faith, the gift of healing, what the what what that is and and and the the gift of miracles, prophecy, uh discerning of gifts, tongues and interpretation of tongues and all that was preparing us for that suddenly that they had at Pentecost in Acts two where where it says and suddenly there was this there came a sound from heaven of a rushing mighty wind, right? and and and God uh by his sovereign grace gave us a suddenly, &gt;&gt; right? One one one of the services uh we we we we we we experienced that suddenly, right? When when when it says suddenly, it's not it's not that you're not expecting it. You are expecting it, but it just comes upon you, right? And when it comes upon you, you must be prepared, right? And that is why we went through this whole journey of being taught how to handle th those gifts. And I believe that uh when when when when when when God gave us the suddenly uh and the spirit came down and and a sister spoke in tongues, right? One of the uh the nine spiritual gifts, right? I believe all of us as a congregation, a congregation, a well-taught congregation started praying for the interpretation of tongues because that's what we were taught to do, &gt;&gt; right? And because everything happened in order, it allowed God to then uh give a vision to a brother, right? give a vision to a brother where he saw the the the the the entire interpretation of the tongues that were spoken and then he spoke out and gave that interpretation of tongues. Why? Because everything was done in order. Amen. And like brother Jack said, I believe there's more where that came from. I believe that we passed the test. Amen. I believe that God is going to give us more of that. And we've got we've got to expect more of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then brother brother Quu came and then preached to us about restoration in completeness. a very powerful service. Um he's talked about us being perfect beings with God, right? We we we came from God and we were perfect beings with with God. But then when we came on in into this world, because of the way we came into this world, we became imperfect beings, right? We enter into this world as sinners, right? And because we are now we move from being perfect beings to being imperfect beings, we have to have a restoration that takes us back to being perfect beings because we came from God and we're going back to God, right? We cannot go back to God as imperfect beings. Right? We have to have a restoration to take us back to being perfect beings. Right? And um you becoming a complete being completes the restoration, right? the justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts in the church and the word. All of that is coming in order to to in order to to to complete the restoration in you and make you a perfect being again. That's why the Bible says, "Be ye perfect." Right? There's nothing in us as human beings that can make us perfect. But it is Christ that makes us perfect. Right? And the restoration is what brings us to that point of perfection. So we can go back to where we came from. So we can go back to being perfect beings. Right? And then um um to even be in the conversation of being perfect again, we have to be redeemable, &gt;&gt; right? And that's why brother Smiley came and preached to us understanding what it means to be redeemable, right? Because this this restoration is is not for everyone, right? Not everyone is going to be made perfect again, &gt;&gt; right? Not everyone came from God and is going back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This restoration is for a special group of people, a predestinated people, a people that was for ordained before the foundation of the world. Amen. The the seed of God. &gt;&gt; Because this this this we we're just passing through this world. This world is not our home. Amen. We're trying to make it back to our home, &gt;&gt; right? And in order for us to make it back to our home, we've got to understand where we're at, &gt;&gt; right? And if you don't know where you are, you are going to get lost in the more of life. And that's why brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother Troy came and preached to us a very powerful service in my opinion about being lost in a mall right he came from home he had a reason to be at the mall he came from his home went to the mall got lost in the mall and that gave him an inspiration to preach lost in the mall because his goal was to get out of the mall make it back home &gt;&gt; right and he typed that to our spiritual lives right we come from home we're in this this this this mall spiritually speaking we're in this mall but we have to find our way out so we can go back home. Amen. And one of the things that he said was that when he got lost, he started trying everything he could. He went here, he didn't find the exit. He went there, he didn't find where he was trying to go. And then he ended up calling his wife and say, you know, help me out, right? He was trying to find a way out, but he just couldn't find his way out to his car, right? And then one of the things that he mentioned is he went to those those maps that they have in the mall, right? That shows you a a blueprint of of the mall, right? And it can show you it it does show you the blueprint of the mall. But there's one important detail on that map that you need. You can see where the exit is, but you have to understand where you are. Right? Because if you don't understand where you are, you won't make it to your exit. Amen. So you have to understand where you are spiritually speaking. Where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we in that restoration? Amen. Where is that restoration? I'm looking for that restoration. I'm looking for that Elias because Jesus will not come back before that restoration happened. I cannot make it back home &gt;&gt; unless &gt;&gt; I know where I'm at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to know where I'm at. And it says right there, you are here. Amen. And we have to understand that in terms of restoration, we are here. Amen. Because the goal is to get out of a mole. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that covers hopefully gives you an understanding of the spiritual um aspect of the restoration right and now with the with the with the natural u aspect of the restoration. We know that restoration covers a lot of things naturally, right? Restoration, right, like we said, is returning something to a former owner, place or condition, right? And restoration covers your family, &gt;&gt; right? The enemy can come in and disrupt your marriage. Restoration will cover that marriage, right? Restoration will bring back your your your your wife. Restoration will bring back your spouse. Restoration will bring back wayward children that the enemy unrightfully and deceitfully stole from you. You are the rightful owner of that husband. You are the rightful owner of that wife. You are the rightful owner of that child. And the enemy has unrightfully deceitfully taken that from you. But restoration covers that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Restoration covers your finances. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were here at one point. The end, the palmer, the locust, the cankerorm, the caterpillar have eaten away at your finances. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're down here &gt;&gt; struggling to make ends meet. I mean, paycheck to paycheck. You used to be comfortable. &gt;&gt; Now you're not. &gt;&gt; Right. Restoration brings back, Lord. Bring it back. Amen. Restoration brings it back. Heavenly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brings back your finances to where they're supposed to be. Amen. Your health, right? Your health. You used to be healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something happened and you're not where you used to be in your health. Restoration covers that. Your position at work, your positions. Maybe you you were a home owner. That was a title that you held and the enemy has taken that away. Restoration will give you back your home and more. Amen. Amen. And and and restoration covers peace, joy, and all these things. Right. Now, let's read um restoration of the bride. Um starting at uh paragraph 83 it says now that's what Webster says the word restore means to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition. And if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place. And may God bless the fe the feeble words. Now to restore means to bring back or to restore a claim can a claim can be enforced. Now to bring um to bring anything back to its rightful owner where it belongs. Therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and can wander around anyway. But to restore is to bring it back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time. bring it back into its natural condition. And in order to do this, we have a right to enforce, I like that word, to enforce. If there is a law, to enforce this rightful condition of restoration to restore. Then he goes on to say, like if somebody stole some property and they're holding that property captive, then you can take the law and go to this person and the law forces enforces this person to restore this property back to its natural owner into its liable first estate. Amen. I like the word enforce. And that word means to cause something to happen by necessity or by force. by necessity or by force, &gt;&gt; right? By I I like that. By force because when it comes to by force, you don't have to be nice. You You ain't got to be nice about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You a You don't have to be nice. He He The enemy was not nice when he destroyed your family. He wasn't being nice when he stole your money. He wasn't being nice. Amen. When he took you from here financially to there, he wasn't being nice. He didn't ask your permission to take your child. He wasn't being nice. So you don't have to be nice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've suffered the violence of the enemy &gt;&gt; because you've suffered the violence of the en enemy. You have to take it by force. Amen. Be violent as well and take it by force. Amen. Like Matthew 11:12 says, the kingdom of God suffer. That's a biblical principle. The kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force. Amen. You got to be forceful when it comes to restoration. Amen. You tell the devil, "Now is when I need my things back. And now and and brother Jack preached on now. Amen. Now I want my son back. Now I want my wife back. Now I want my husband back. Now I want my money back. I want my money and I want it now. Amen. J, you ever heard of JG Wentworth? You seen that JG Wentworth commercial? It's my money and I want it now. Amen. You don't have to be nice about that. Amen. And when someone says now, they mean business. Amen. Now means immediately. I want my son immediately. I want my finances immediately. I want my health right away. Amen. I want my health instantly. Amen. I want my family back ASAP. Amen. Without further delay, I want it now. Amen. You have to be forceful when it comes to the devil. Amen. To take back what he stole from you. Amen. Because he wasn't nice when he did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the other thing I like about the word enforce is when you when you are enforcing, Amen. You are going on the offense. &gt;&gt; Amen. We remember those sermons on going on the offense. Amen. We are in attack mode, heavenly. Amen. Amen. And when the palmer worm, the locust, kangle worm, the caterpillar, Amen. that enemy is attacking, he is on the offense, right? But when it comes to restoration, the ball has changed possession. Now we are on the offense, right? We are on the attack. Amen. Now we can say, "Give it back." Amen. And the Holy Ghost is there to back us up and enforce those claims. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost is the enforcer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then brother Jerry came and preached to us a a sermon called sealed in restoration. &gt;&gt; Another powerful sermon. Amen. And one of the things he said was, "What unlocks the restoration that belongs to us is when we recognize our need for it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless you recognize there's need for restoration, there is no restoration for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's naturally and spiritually. Amen. Unless you come to a point naturally where you say, you know what, enough is enough. I need my joy back. I'm tired of depression. I'm tired of paying unnecessary medical bills. I'm tired of taking these pills. I'm tired of of of whatever it is that the enemy has as a whatever condition the enemy has put you in. Unless you come to that point, &gt;&gt; amen, of realizing and recognizing that you need things to change, restoration is not unlocked. &gt;&gt; Right. and and and and unlock it. Come unlocking it comes from recognizing your need for it. And even spiritually, Amen. Maybe you were up here spiritually before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you were up here spiritually before and something has happened &gt;&gt; and you're not where you used to be. Maybe you're wandering around spiritually trying to find a place to rest and you know you were here before, right? You know you were here. You know you got out of step. Amen. And we the the the the the we had the whole series of uh getting back in step, right? You were here spiritually and something has happened. Now you're not where you used to be. You have to get back in step. Amen. You you you have to realize something must change. &gt;&gt; My inner man needs to be fed like it used to be fed. &gt;&gt; I need restoration. You have to rec recognize that you need that restoration to unlock that restoration. And it reminds me of um uh this this little video um that that I that I saw a couple of years ago. and it was a um a denomin Pentecostal preacher. And I I just as a disclaimer, I don't I don't go listening to denominational preachers. So before before you judge me, I I I wasn't looking for it. But you know on social media sometimes you just come across things, right? And um I was watching uh this little video. Um and this minister says he's talking about how the he was talking about how the enemy the enemy will come and steal stuff from you. And he said, "You mean to tell me you're just going to sit there and watch the devil take your stuff?" &gt;&gt; No, you've got to fight. Amen. That's why brother brother Mark preached it's time to fight, right? That's why we know to go on the offense. That's why we know to be forceful because you cannot just sit there and watch the devil take your stuff, &gt;&gt; right? You've got He's not going to hand it back. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to give you back what he stole from you. Amen. You've got to come to that recognization and say, "Hey, I need my stuff and I need it now. I need my money and I need it now. I need my health and I need it now." You cannot sit there and watch the devil take your stuff. You've got to stand up and fight because it's time to Restoration is a time to go on the offense. Restoration is a time to fight. Restoration is now time. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it's now time, you mean business. Amen. You mean business. All right. Um, and when it comes to fighting, we know that we use this to fight, &gt;&gt; right? We use this. This is how we fight our battles because the claims that we can make are in the word of God. The promises we need are in the word of God. Right? This is how we fight our battle. And and brother Brandham says in uh Believest thou this he says you he says the word of God the written word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time it's written. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say to you there it is. We need the word of God. Amen. All we need to do is recognize uh naturally speaking all we need is to recognize um our need for restoration because that unlocks that restoration. Once you recognize the need for it, find your promise in the word of God. Make your claim and then you leave it to the Holy Ghost, the enforcer, and say, "Lord, it's in your court." Amen. I've done my part. I've recognized my need for restoration. Amen. And I've found my promise. I've made my claim. Now the ball is in your court. You are the enforcer. You go and enforce the claim. You made the promises. Amen. And we're looking to you to to to do the restoration. Amen. And then and then to to to to in closing um I'll say this restoration is an attribute of God that we cannot exhaust. &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot exhaust the restoration of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The promises of God also do not have an expiry date. Amen. So when God says I will restore, right? And that was that was the inspiration for 2024 and 2025. That doesn't mean it stops and ends in 2024 and 2025. Amen. Even though we're entering into a new year with a new inspiration, we still take amen that I will restore with us. Because whatever situation we find ourselves in, we must know that God is a God of restoration. Amen. That that attribute can never be exhausted. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. God bless you, SAINTS.
