have you stand too long i just want to read a man of scripture as we would just uh take a a a little thought here this morning i trust that the lord will just bless us on this day you know um mother's day is a little different from father's day a lot different a lot different and um you know you find all kind of try to find mushy things you can say to mama to encourage you but daddies don't need that mushy they just want you to tell it to them straight up you know and uh but uh nonetheless we we did want to you know try to encourage our fathers in some way and and uh just tell them how much we appreciate them uh everyone that is here within the sound of my voice you wouldn't be here if you didn't have a good daddy he was good enough to have you so appreciate your fathers amen no matter what uh just appreciate your fathers amen amen amen i learned to do that myself but i thank god for the journey that he took me through amen through my life it made me who i am amen i i could not um just settle on the scripture psalms 51 is where i want to go to and um i couldn't settle my heart on a particular verse here so just let me read most of it um this is written by david and uh i think it would be just a blessing on this father's day it says have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold i was shaping and iniquity and and sin did my mother conceive me but behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to no wisdom purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee deliver me from blood guiltiness o god now god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not and burn offerings the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh god thou wilt not despise do good and thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offerings and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine oil to the lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow uh in a word of prayer father we your privileged people to be able to come into your house uh we've gathered in your name and we've come to worship you we thank you for everything that has happened thus far in the service and as we come and turn our attention towards the word of god speak to us through your word speak words that would change us from the inside out and god reacts that you would give life to those that need life bring deliverance to those that need deliverance bring healing to those that need healing salvation to those that need salvation got whatever the need is this morning we pray that you would meet each one at the point of their need bless the fathers that are in the house those that are online bless them abundantly god is our prayer in jesus name we pray amen amen amen you can be seated in the house of the lord praise the lord uh we want to use for our title today uh sovereign grace from our sovereign father amen amen and um i'll just uh start out with maybe just reading a little something here from the the sermon leadership and fathers are are very very important uh very very important and uh we we don't want to ever take that for granted and um um let's just kind of show a few things here that god's prophet said says it's usually a mother that gets to lead a child to its first step it says because she is home while the daddy is out working now uh i know somehow society is changing this uh it used to be daddy was the one out working providing for the family praise the lord amen but society and we got to be careful uh it's one thing if you're sick and can't work and your wife has to do whatever it's that's that's that's totally understandable but but but but but but but if i can be honest men are getting lazy right and and and um you know the scripture says a man not a woman but a man that don't work don't eat right so so so so as men we have a responsibility we have to stand up and accept that a father is the protector amen and provider uh you know he he's supposed to you know do all of those things in his house so we want to make sure we keep men held to a standard amen so it's usually a mother that gets to lead a child to his first step because she is home uh while daddy is out working trying to make a living uh he says but it's uh they they make their first step and at night time when they come in the father he is always saying uh he's always saying oh dad she said johnny and mary the little boy girl can walk come and look in just one step maybe mother had to whole had to hold uh mother's finger let me give you the the quote it's 65 i'm sorry let me i didn't write something down 65 65-1031 a and then the paragraph number is 22. okay sorry about that says um um and just one step maybe mother had to hold had to have the whole mother's finger because you was kind of weak and kind of turned sideways you know and and fall down a little so you had to hold mama's hand to make your first step and some of y'all can go back in memories and think about holding mama's hand says now now somebody help you when you made your first step hallelujah and your last step you ever make in life somebody will be leading you so somebody was helping you when you made your first step and somebody's gonna be leading you when you make your last step now hallelujah right so see that's right i want you to remember that your first step somebody led you and your last step somebody will be leading you all right says we have to be led you know god liking us unto sheep and did you know a sheep can't lead itself amen he'll wander away and stray he just can't lead himself and he has to have somebody to lead him hallelujah amen the shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep now that was back in the days of the lord jesus he was the good shepherd that led the sheep but today you see we're living in another day everything is changed and perverted that's what i was saying early about father's not going to work anymore men find it very gratifying to be at home taking care of kids and and some wives love it that way hallelujah they run into some real problems and realize that man ain't got what it takes on the inside to do what really need to be done he's built differently hallelujah designed differently by god and he has a role that he needs to play but what we need what we need to do in christendom is stay in our lanes hello somebody if everybody just standing lane it'll run real smooth all right hallelujah church right amen and like i say there are times where that might happen but that should not be the norm amen it shouldn't be the norm god god god made it just go back and look at what happened in the garden of eden when the punishments came down who did god send to work adam went to work adam had to work by the sweat of his brow that was god's original plan and let me tell you something god don't change his mind now we might change but god don't change hallelujah and sister make sure you find yourself a man that's willing to work all right now i'm going on a little further amen it says uh um but you say uh but you see today you see we're living in another day everything is changed and perverted you know what man has to lead sheep today a goat and it sees a shepherd's job before but 90 years ago it says and you know where the goat leads them to right into the slaughter them little sheep don't know where they're going so the goat goes up a pen up up at the slaughter and the sheep don't know no more than to follow a leader so it goes in and gets killed see uh i'm sorry follow leave so it leads him right up into the slaughter and then the goat jumps over the track and the sheep goes in and gets killed see the goat a wrong leader hallelujah but jesus the good shepherd who led the sheep he led them to life and held their hand but somebody has to leave the sheep let me go a little further in this quote it says the first is mother's kindness then the father's after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy hallelujah all of us for wisdom because he is the head of the house who's the head of the house all right that is the head of the house he's saying you look the daddy for you for wisdom and usually not that he's any smarter i love the way this is put not that he's any smarter but he's just made a leader of his family now every man in here that has a family is the leader of that family hallelujah that's why you gotta have you got to watch how you lead them god made you the leader of that family you have to lead financially you have to lead physically you have to lead emotionally and you have to leave spiritually right hallelujah he says uh uh just made a lead of his family so we follow what our daddy says do when he says now son i would like for you to do a certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom oh i just want to break in there just for a few seconds you know because sometimes in a household and it just happens on both sides both sides sometimes a mother may not understand why the daddy is saying do something to the kids why tell the kids to do a particular thing the mothers don't understand that and sometimes the mother might feel like you know that's just that's just too mean that's just to this and that's just to that you got to understand your role is to bring the nourishment and that soft side but daddy has to lay down law and i'm going to tell you something if you if you will allow daddy to lay down law it'll keep your kids out of jail sometimes you got to back off and and and the whole hallelujah you you sometimes you're just not going to have to say nothing i remember uncle mine told me he said don't argue a man in front of the kids say if y'all got a disagreement try to go behind closed doors and argue because them kids when they see you disagreeing then them kids gonna use that to their advantage come on somebody right and that kid will find a way to get around daddy because they can go to mama all the time mama you gotta understand his responsibility is to lay down some law hallelujah all right all right let me keep going let me keep going now i'm coming to a few points that i want to make here it says um he's just a leader of his family so we we follow what our daddy says do when he says now son i would like for you to do a certain thing uh then we listen to him because it's wisdom but listen see he has learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by his what he has learned to tell us now don't go and do this because i did that my father told me not to do it but i did it and it caused this to happen to me you're learning from daddy's experience and something back see so see then then he daddy tells us how to do it and what to do right i had a daddy like that i had a daddy like that i'm finished with that but my my my father you know a couple of times i just my mind goes back amen and i think about a couple things but you know i remember there were certain friends in my neighborhood that my daddy just didn't want me running with people that he just didn't want hanging around the house and you know and we would sneak to try to try to run with these guys but my daddy was absolutely right this one guy that he was telling us watch out for him so he's he's uh probably 10 or 15 years older than y'all but he want to hang with y'all something wrong with this guy hallelujah and later on in life we found out there was something wrong with that guy right i mean my daddy had a way of i mean what he was doing was just kind of using his his experience to try to share with us if we could just catch what he was saying not that he was being mean but he was being a protector right hallelujah i remember him trying to instill structure you know in in the household and and i remember one time uh we were just real caught up on on wrestling and we wanted to watch some wrestling on tv i believe it was and uh you know they had to you know back though back in those days andre the giant and dusty rose and sweet brown sugar and and all these other wrestlers and everything that was you know i mean right then west palm beach auditorium and man we would be watching that wrestling and one day we got so engrossed in that wrestling but then to say feed the dog but uh you know like what daddy would get to it and and uh we're just sitting there watching and going from commercial to commercial just watching that and say feed the dog and uh so you know we sitting there nothing we didn't move and and uh we were just so overtaken by what we was looking at on television i would say we'll get to the dog later really all what he was instilling was responsibility right and that it but before we knew it daddy came down the hallway hallelujah and uh and all we heard is a belt wrinkling and you talk about somebody that stopped watching you know wrestling real quick we ran out the house to get to that talk my cousin didn't understand what was going on and he was the last one to get out the house he felt the wrath of daddy but he was just stealing something you gotta you gotta learn responsibility before you got wrapped up in that program the dog needed to be fed and i told you nicely i told you twice nicely but now i got to be the enforcer and households daddy have to be the enforcer daddy when mama come to you with a problem and this kid did this this kid did that sometimes you got to step up and enforce some things don't let them children run over mama because we got it perverted you know children raising parents it should be parents raising children but the children tell us what they want to do and see in my house it didn't it didn't go that way we didn't tell what we i i don't want to do this now you don't want to do what you don't want to eat what and i'm slaved over the stone no you're going to eat this and you ain't going to get up from the table until it's all gone that's the house i grew up in and i thank god i grew up in a house like that because it kept me from eating at a jail table some stats i just love to give stats like this on father's day and and uh i i i reached and grabbed some stats from multiple sources here amen uh i used a website life is beautiful uh modern gentleman.net touchstone mag.com and uh nickcaddy.org so i'm just pulling you know just different articles from these these uh these um different websites and i just want to give you just some qualities here or some stats about about fathering uh they said in one only 68 of children will spend their their entire childhood with an intact family only 68 of children will spend their entire childhood with an intact family all right and and and one of the causing i mean one of the the biggest causes for a child not being able to spend their entire childhood with the with an intact family is because divorce a man is one of the leading leading causes of a fatherless home divorce is the leading cause of a fatherless home all right um they have this and this is a spiritual thing when both parents attend bible study and watch this listen to this listen real good and and and some of y'all might want to elbow the person next to someone listen up now listen up listen up all right says when both parents attend bible study in addition to sunday service listen up elbow i'm not listen up amen when they attend bible study in addition to sunday service 72 of their children will attend sunday school when they're grown that's by just going to a wednesday night service you got a 70 72 chance that your children will also not just go to church but they'll go to bible uh a sunday school when they get older watch that now another stat stat here says 90 of the youth in the united states who decide to run away from home or become homeless for any reason any reason originally comes from a fatherless home so it's good for daddy to be there all right it says if if a father does not go to church no matter how faithful his wife's devotions are only one child and 50 will become a regular worshiper only one child and 50 children will become a regular worshiper if the father does not go to church hallelujah the reason that is is because the children equate church to being something that only a woman does it's for women and children but not for men that's why i take men that come up get up out of the bed and lead your family to church no this ain't just something that women and children do that's something that all of us do hallelujah amen son i go because i need god's mercy i need god's grace and i want to lead by example and i don't want to just go to just sunday morning i want to come wednesday night as well it has an impact on your child when they see you go to church you know i'm a uh you know i always tell this story but i remember uh and these are things that happened that shaped my memory my daddy won a church going man you know all all of our years of growing up we i remember we all had the family church that my daddy attended but i didn't realize why he stopped going just and one of the reasons my dad stopped just because of some of the mess that he saw in church right and and i can understand that but uh but i remember you know there was come a time we were becoming teenagers and and uh we didn't really want to go to church either we didn't want to be known as church boys right and uh and i remember you know daddy one day decided that he gonna go to church but on this day he did something different he said we gonna walk to church i say oh as a teenager walking down the street and all my boys see me walking to church i thought that was gonna be the most embarrassing day of my life i cannot walk to church with the family so me and my brother came up with a plan daddy we'll meet y'all there my dad will say okay i'ma hold you to your word my daddy got up the road a little bit got him rolled a little bit he saw that we was not behind him daddy showed up he had a key to the front though he opened his door and we heard that belt again you want to see how fast we got dressed to get ready for church and daddy walked with us right on down there to the church i don't care how embarrassed we might have felt daddy instilled something in us that day that church was important thank my god for a daddy like that hallelujah listen um if uh this other stat here says uh children who live in a father's home are 279 percent more likely to deal drugs or carry firearms for offensive purposes compared to children who live with their fathers hallelujah think about these stats the father is extremely important all right uh here you know another stat that says 85 of youth who are currently in prison grew up in a fatherless home and i said if a father does go regularly church if he goes regularly to church regardless of the practice of the mother so even though the mama don't go but the daddy decide to go says between two thirds and three quarters of their children will become church goers when that when the children see the daddy going to church it affects them uh mentally it affects them they will want to go to church hallelujah look at this uh another statement children from father's homes are twice as likely to drop out from school before graduating than children who have a father in their lives and this last stat that i want to give you um if a child is the there is the first person in a household to become a christian there is three or 3.5 percent probability that everybody else in the household will follow if the mother in the household becomes a christian first there is a 17 probability that everybody else in the household is gonna follow hallelujah however if the father is the first to fall to start following jesus there is a 93 percent probability that everybody else in the house is going to follow you can see the impact of daddy's serving god the data shows that when daddy serves god it has an impact on his family not just that family but generation after generation after generation is impacted when daddy is serving god i was looking at this amen scripture i i want to read re have you read with me ephesians 6 amen verse 1 just giving you these stats amen is one thing and it just shows the the importance of daddy being involved spiritually and naturally daddies need to be involved hallelujah glory glory glory and uh here you know we we want to look at something in ephesians six verse one says this children obey your parents in the lord for this is right now if your parent trying to get you to do something that's against the word of god that's not what the bible tells you to do but it's in the lord for this is right notice this verse 2 says honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise glory to god by honoring your father your mother you know i and what what this is is a man as a child what you need to think about you you don't want to do anything that's going to bring shame on your father or your mother you don't do anything that's going to bring shame on the name of your family think about what you're doing before you get involved with that right but but honor your father honor your mother this is the first commandment with promise in verse three tells us what the promises says that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth when you see some a person that's kind of gone past that 70 years three score and 10 is what god promised but they way past that you probably need to start asking them how did they treat their parents how did they treat their parents because i mean what was the relationship like with your mother and with your father evidently something happened amen along the line that caused them to be able to get long life from the earth hallelujah this is the first commandment with promise by honoring your father and your mother listen and on the verb the next verse says and ye fathers this is an important one fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurturing admonition of the lord remember when when a father amen is the one that gives his heart to the lord first 93 chance that the rest of his family is going to follow that's that's that's some great stats to me hallelujah but but on the other side i want to tell you fathers the scripture tell us provoke not our children to wrath now what i've learned amen in my years of being a father especially now that my my my girls are grown they not little girls anymore hallelujah hey man this this weekend and it's father's day my girls took off and went to boston praise the lord you know just it just worked out in their schedule this way that's that's the way it worked out but you know one one of my daughters took off she went early before everybody and i'm like man my girl's growing up right i mean these these girls are renting their own car and driving to rhode island and all i'm like what's up and they doing it without me things are changing right things are changing and and what i'm learning a man that you know there might be things that my decisions that my kids will make and i'm learning this i'm i'm a work in progress it might be decisions that they make that i might not agree with but what i'm learning to do is hush my mouth don't say a word hallelujah because i don't want to provoke my children to wrath hallelujah amen if i live the right kind of life before i'm there follow that example but sometimes you gotta learn i mean now there might be a certain age that i'm gonna have to say something but then you're gonna get to another age drama just let you figure it out hallelujah glory to god as a dad you got to know when to pull back and then when to step forward hallelujah somebody but the bible say don't provoke your children to wrath that means as a dad you gotta learn how to respect your children the way you want your children to respect you hallelujah to the lamb of god i'm learning this as a as i get older my job as father will never stop i'll always be a father as long as i got children around amen but i gotta understand you know there's certain things that you have to pull back on some things you got to get involved in some things pull back up you'll learn that you know as as you go forward all right here i want to just bring in a another little quote here and i want to kind of change gears just a little bit this is going to come from the message the waters of separation i was reading this some time ago and and it just kind of struck me and i said you know i i think i want to save that for father's day says this and the message the waters of separation says many times in dealing with spiritual things you see them when they move out someone was just speaking uh just asking me here not long ago i was at calgary canada and a boy came in they had him in a straitjacket i want y'all to get the condition of this boy they had him in a straitjacket and they come in the back of the room and he was cursing and carrying on and i never heard such in my life and the father was trying to hold him and when he got on the inside he looked over to me and said william branham you ain't got nothing to do with me now this is a spirit speaking out of this boy calling brother branham's name called his full name don't play with demons don't play with demons this is real this is re reality and i'm gonna tell you as as as a father you want to make sure you're in a position that if a devil attack attack your child you got you got representation in heaven right you got you got you got you got a connection with god that you can pray and know that in the name of jesus that devil got to get off your child you got to have that type of relationship with god right now i need to call the pastor i need to call no you need to call jesus all right so look at this boy's condition now he says looked over to me and said william branham you ain't got nothing to do with me oh the father looked at him and said he don't even know his own name i know his own name how'd he know your name right i was standing off a great distance from oh how he was cursing me and carrying on and he said you ain't got nothing to do with me and i asked the audience if they'd just be reverent the ushers come to take him out just then i seen the holy spirit move out the angel lord said now bring him here just a minute when they went to bring him he started kicking and frothing and biting he was in a straitjacket look at it since they brought him up close and then when the vision come and told just what it was a sin that had been committed by his father that caused a child to be in that condition the sun is in a straitjacket the boy is kicking and frothing and cursing and doing everything and the reason is boys in this condition is because something that his daddy did oh we need to catch this now we need something that his daddy did caused this boy to be in this condition listen listen listen some of our children are where they are because of what daddy has done hallelujah just stay with me here listen it says this uh uh committed by his father calls the child to be in that condition the father fell down and repented oh i like that right see the daddy handled this thing right when his sin was exposed the daddy made things right before god hallelujah and when he made things right before god let's let's read on says when the evil spirit went from that boy thousands times thousands of people in the stampede grounds there that night looked and like a great big spot and a black shadow floating around oh my was really uh it was uh really quite and and it went around out of the place out through the building and went away the boy got delivered once his daddy repented hallelujah there was sovereign grace given to this boy by a sovereign father once the daddy repented daddy we don't realize the impact that we have on our families i thought about how many boys out there right now struggling with pornography because they saw something underneath the daddy's mattress i mean they're struggling with pornography because they saw something inappropriate on television or on the daddy's telephone see we don't realize the things that we do impact those that follow us that's why i want to impact them the right way hallelujah as i thought about this this little vision amen that brother branham just shared the vision opened up and and just said hey uh told the daddy you did this you did that and immediately man repented the man repented and by him repenting it it caused his family to go free his boy went free a boy was in a straight jacket can you imagine that you you kind of want to ask yourself well what did the what did the daddy do that caused the sun to get that bound what did the daddy do hallelujah that's why i want to be careful about what i do glory to god and here's the other part to that if if i recognize that i've done something wrong that could have affected my family i want to quickly repent i thought about this and you know we we read this scripture i read this out of psalms 51 this is this is david repenting this is david uh recognizing that he'd done something wrong and and quickly he goes to repentance let's let's just kind of pick it up again have mercy upon me oh god according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude i attend the mercies blot out my transgressions glory to god it says wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me this is daddy you got to recognize amen maybe it's because of me that my children are where they are hallelujah glory it says against thee thee only have i sinned and done this even that sight that thou mightest be justified when thy speakers and be clear without judges behold i was shaping in iniquity and then and seeing that my mother conceived me behold thou desires truth in the inward parts i want to tell you that god want truth coming from the inside it's one thing to be acting a certain way on the outside but god wants truth coming from the inside hallelujah thou desires truth from the end with parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom glory to god look at this it says purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be white in the snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice it ain't amen it ain't nothing cowardly about repenting i want to say that he is nothing cowardly about repenting repenting can actually change the course of somebody's fate and and in the case of this little boy his daddy's repentance is what brought the boy freedom i want you to look deeper at this today amen you i mean sometimes we don't know lord is it what it may be something that i've done god that could cause my child to be in this place hallelujah god if if it is short to me have a heart and say lord show it to me so i can make that thing right because it just don't impact just that one child but when that child has children they still dealing with stuff generation after generation after generation still dealing with stuff because the one thing that i did let me keep reading here verse 8 it says make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice i'll rejoice by seeing all my children serving the lord amen i've seen them all serve the lord i can rejoice in that but i want to make sure i haven't done anything to offend them something that would cause them that that they can't certainly on account of me and sometimes you know maybe uh maybe it's just a misunderstanding sometimes like i said daddy gotta lay down law there are some laws that i laid down amen uh as a father and i knew some man this is tough kids don't realize they they put you in tough positions they put you in places where you got to make some real hard decisions and let me tell you something i don't care um let me put it this way if you ain't got children it's hard for you to tell somebody how to raise children right and i'ma tell you there there is no no no no no no book that you can just go to that deals with every circumstance and gives you the insight that you need when this happened do this when this happened do that you got to depend on god through each and every one of them circumstance that rise up and you hoping that you're doing the best that you can but i've had to make some real tough decisions being a parent real hard decisions things that i probably didn't want to do at that time but but you put me in a place you make me have to keep my word you're gonna make me have to keep my words i don't wanna do this but you're gonna make me do it your actions and your your everything you all these decisions that you're making is making me do this and then i gotta trust god that at the end of all this that i haven't provoked them where i can't win them but as a father i got to be a father and notice god is a father not a grandfather when we get granddaddy duty everything changed i mean i i had the the privilege of of of having granddaddy duty this week amen i i had to watch my little grandson i'm just sitting there watching them just run back and forth and having all this fun and i'm like man whatever that fella wanted to do i was willing to do but if if it was his mama one of the other girls what nah get in that out you know that's where father talked but grandfather i'm in a different mode now but but but but as a father i realized that there's a there's a there's a tight line that i'm walking right i'm not trying to offend but i am trying to protect hallelujah right i i am trying to do something that's going to help help you in the future now when we when we look at david look at let me just keep reading here in verse 9 it says have thy face from my sins and blotted all my iniquities creating me a clean heart see it's not a you're not a coward because you repent david did this says creating me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me casping out away from my presence take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with uh free spirit david found himself in a critical spot in his life david was amen just based on this scripture alone you can see why david was called the man after god's own heart um david was a perfect type of the lord jesus christ david was both a prophet and a king jesus is the prophet of all prophets and the king of all kings amen david was the one that was willing to take on this this this this uh um this giant circumstance that nobody else was willing to take it on david went out with a slingshot and and it's lou goliath hallelujah jesus was willing to take on death hell and the grave and this little giant that nobody else could slay hallelujah david opened a sacrifice to stay the plague of death at the thrashing floor of our man christ offered his life on a cross at that same area where the threshing floor was a perfect type of christ david was a pre-anointed fugitive while running from saul amen he was fugitive something it's something that's refused that's what a future is he was a pre-anointed king but he was a feuded of running from saul hallelujah christ is also amen he's been refused he is a future fugitive today because he's on the outside of his church trying to get back in this is what the book of amen revelation tells us in revelation three it says david i wrote out david was a rejected king running from his own son hallelujah absalom he was criticized by cheme as he was on the run shemayu was throwing rocks and sand and and all kind of words that david hallelujah i want y'all to catch this father now this father this dave david his father david is running from his own son sometimes fathers go through things in their life where their children turn on them their children turn on them but you know a real father you know what he does when that happens he prays for his children now david knew he could have whipped absalom as soon as absalom would have stepped on the battlefield but i i don't want to do that to my boy oh hallelujah i don't want to hurt my boy like that he'll he'll never recover from that right he'll never recover so let me just run let me let me get out of here this is what david decides to do right hallelujah but while david was running uh brother branham makes a statement says 800 years from there the son of david was climbing the same mountain looking out over jerusalem's weeping over jerusalem and as a rejected king saying you know jerusalem jerusalem how oft you know would i have hovered you i would have brought you to myself like a hand brewing i would have just brought you to myself but you rejected me david ran the same mountain that jesus ran up david was a great king but david had a problem with passion his passions is what caused him to have to write psalm 51. and i want to just kind of pick up something here in second samuel 12 because this is where we get amen some insight on why david had to write psalm 51. i appreciate him being a father amen that could repent just like this man that i just read to you this man his son is in a straitjacket because of something he did but the man was able to repent and through that repentance he saw a son set free last week as we were you know in church and and uh um i was just blessed by you know our sisters wanting to stand in the gap for their loved ones and as i announced it after the service after the preaching of the word we'll have a prayer line there was a few uh uh that a few people came up and and i was so pleased to see their dad father standing in the gap for their children i thought to myself i said you know what about that nobleman that came to jesus and said you know my son is at home dying would you do something to help my son jesus said go on back you'll find him amen well just based on your faith and the very same hour that the boy got well is when jesus told a man go home and find it the way you believed it this father's willing to stand in the gap on behalf of his son as fathers we've got to stand standing gap on behalf of our children look at this in second samuel 12. now before i give you a man this scripture a little bit more history about david david great king david had a problem with passion couldn't get control of his passion one day david was there while the arm is out battling he's at home and goes outside and when he walks outside he saw something that he probably should not have saw there's a woman a few houses over having happened to be taking a bath on top of her roof and david sees this woman taking the bath and and he uh he says um who is that and he started asking questions around the town who is this woman and they told david that she is the wife of uriah her name is bathsheba and they use the word wife well david saw this woman one too many times and he said i don't care who wife she is go get her for me now david did this at a time that he already had 500 wives and with passion like that there was no need for him to go after this woman hallelujah he already had a wife they're getting quiet in here right now now i'm going to tell you something else the reason that we believe the bible is because the bible have stories in this i mean they tell you the good and the bad it ain't hiding nothing from you it's giving it to you straight that's how you can get delivered when you get it straight david goes after this woman and bible says that he uh you know he got her pregnant and when he gets her pregnant he decides saying because you know she left the house that night and she said word said tell david i'm pregnant no no now her husband ain't there how is she pregnant when her husband ain't home so you know the husband's out of that battle david say uh send a letter by somebody by courier said go tell uh uh joab to send you ryan home he bring your ryder home you're in say uh and he had a battle going oh they doing this they doing that and i can't wait to get back out to the battle well man i'm calling you here for a little vacation you need a little vacation okay king he said here here's something to drink and just relax yourself and you know he got he got the fella so drunk and then at the end of getting him drunk he say now go on home with your wife enjoy enjoy some time with your wife the man went outside stopped at the at the entrance of the doe found himself a rock laid down went to sleep david went to bed and i said okay he's going to get home with his wife he's drunk and things going to happen and you know we going to put this off on him the man never went home so david wake up the next morning and walk out and have to step over you riley man what you doing at the house you're right your eyes say i couldn't i couldn't dare go home and have pleasure with my wife knowing that the soldiers out there battling no king i'm ready to go back i mean the man didn't even want to come home and go see his wife dedicated so today david said i'm going to try it again i'm going to get them drunk again i'm going to man did it a second time will not go home to his wife they would say okay i got to come up with something else wrote a letter wrote a letter and say now go get to the thickest part of the bottom uh the battle put this man uriah at the front and when you got him in the front and the thickest part about at a battle y'all withdraw yourself from him and let him get killed out on the battlefield and then not only this wrote the letter sealed it gave it to uriah to deliver to joab uriah never even opened a letter you talk about a man dedicated to the king brother adam say when you get to heaven that's the first person you want to go meet us uriah what a man here here david has this thing executed uriah loses his life when he loses his life on the battlefield they sent word back to david say this is what happened on the battlefield uriah's dead they would say well you know can't win them all nobody knew what was going on david thought he hid this thing and then here comes here comes uh uh bathsheba she's in mourning and and david say you know what as soon as she finished morning i'mma call her to to me again and and i'm gonna marry her because her husband's dead thought he could hide this sin we pick up in second samuel 12 where his sin has been revealed now i need you to understand is when his sin is revealed in second semi-12 this is where psalm 51 is birth sometimes some good stuff can come out some bad stuff ii samuel 12 look at this and the lord sent nathan see nobody told nathan this but god revealed it to the prophet oh hallelujah and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor and i can just imagine y'all just get on the scene with me because nathan probably come up and hey uh david how everything going oh everything's going well how about the battles well and we win and we got this i got the report about this got the report you know everything going real good prophet thank god says okay then the prophet has to drop in and give him a little parable it says uh there were two men in the city the man the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceeded many flocks and hurts uh but the poor man had nothing save one little u lamb which it brought uh and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children and it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter brother branham say uh this poor man was feeding this lamb with the same spoon he was eating can from imagine that you know people feed their animals cats and dogs and stuff like that now they do that but this i mean to me i'm like oh no i don't know about that but but but but this is what brother man say this is how close this lamb was to this man he's feeding him with the same spoon that he's eating out of look at this verse four uh verse verse four and there came a traveler unto the rich man this traveler is david's passions a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take his own flock and of his own herd and to to dress for the wayfarer man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him look and davis anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die now i want you to notice something david has pronounced death on himself oh hallelujah but sovereign grace was given from a sovereign father to stop stop death from happening to david watch this watch this watch this watch this and he don't he don't he don't you know he he thought he was something good i mean i got judgment on this uh uh oh prophet i got the man that did this gun die okay look at it look at it and he keeps on saying he should restore the lamb fourfold because he had no pity now he did this thing and because he had no pity now first he said the man should should die and then he got to restore the lamb fourfold this is david's own prophecy against himself let's keep reading let's keep reading and remember that verse 6 because i want to come back to it hallelujah and nathan said that david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and uh uh if it had been too little i would have i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things whatever you would have asked me for david i would have gave it to you look at this wherefore has thou despised oh lord have mercy he got busted on this one wherefore has thou despised the commandment of the lord what's the commandment of the lord thou shalt not commit adultery thou has despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight and not only that that's not commit adultery and thou shalt not kill because he had the man killed he just breaking all the commandments look at it says in uh uh thou has killed uriah the hittites with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain with staying with the sword of the children of mind now i just i wanted to just kind of catch this because this is david's problem his problem is with his passions and because he had a passion problem he don't you know he done committed adultery with this woman bathsheba got her pregnant and then had a husband killed in the process all this because he couldn't control his passion now i need you to catch something here because i'm gonna keep just read just a little bit further and i'm i'm gonna break into something says now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because those despise me and has taken the wife of you right the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with our wives in the sight of the son of the son for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before before the son look at this verse 13 and david said unto nathan i have sinned see it i it it it helps when you can repent david realized that i'm wrong and this is this is why i read psalm 51 because that's what it was birthed from this experience david said nathan david said he said i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die see sovereign grace sovereign grace from a sovereign father david deserved to die for what he did but grace stepped in and stopped death from from from from overtaking him however we sow something we have to reap it and david made a statement in verse 6. he should restore the he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity this is david's words david said he gonna have to restore the lamb fourfold even though david did not die his children suffer from his decision now i'm gonna tell you he had four sons to die the first son was the son from bathsheba the first one of his boys to go and and david i mean after she had uh uh uh uh gave gave gave birth to the baby david saw all these problems and he wouldn't have fasted and praying and doing everything he could but god allowed the baby to be taken that was his first son and and they said we couldn't get him to eat while uh while the baby was living how are we going to get him to eat not at the baby dad he said he saw him all talking he said you know what y'all y'all didn't want to tell me this but the baby's dead ain't it he said i'm gonna get up and eat i'm gonna refresh myself he said i'm gonna go to church i'm gonna do all these things i need to do i'm gonna get my heart right with god because look he said he's saying look i can't i can't bring him to me but one day i'm gonna go to where he is his first son is gone will you read the next chapter there's another little problem he has a son you want to know what his son's problem is passion this son is name named amnon and omnon come up with this great plan i'm not had a real bad friend that gave him some really bad advice he says you know he said what's the matter with your man he's saying man i just love my sister tamar you love her yeah i love him now he shouldn't be loving his sister like that something wrong with his spirit he said well you know what you ought to do is act like you sick and then have tamar come to your house and cook you so cook your meal and put everybody out and do what you do man gave him this bad advice he said okay i think i'm gonna take you up on that god has got his daddy to come over act like he was sick daddy just had my sister tomorrow come over and give me a meal and i i think i'll be ready i'll be all right after that tamar comes over fixes him the meal and then after after the after after the meal is you know uh prepared he said put everybody out from me somebody said what's going on what you doing i'm just here to cook your meal saying no no no no i it got to be more than this no no no i he she said look why don't you ask daddy for my hand in marriage ain't got to do this this man passion problem is so bad that he raped his own sister as you start talking things like this in church it get quiet but it's the bible anyhow and i want to tell you if people don't get control of their passions fathers if they don't get control of their passions they'll have worse problems than this in their houses the best thing you can do is repent to god i'm on i'm on just raped assistant and she'd come out from there and she saw her brother absolutely said what happened to you what happened don't tell me i'm not she just couldn't even talk i'm not i mean absalom waited two years sheep shearing time great celebration time and he went to the king and said daddy let all the king's sons come and fellowship with me we gonna have a nice big fellowship and and i got this thing all worked out nice barbecue and everybody gonna eat well and we gonna do this we gonna do that and say why you want all the sunsets i just want everybody to celebrate and while he was while he said let i'm not come i'm not get out there there's a gang already got a plot after i'm saying when you get it whenever we get them drunk i want y'all to slay him now absolutely i'm not gonna slam himself he say but i want y'all to take him out for what he did to my sister they got him i got i'm not so drunk absalom called for the boys to attack and they attacked amnam was dead just like that his second son remember he said 4-4 david has lost the baby from bathsheba david's lost amnon i'm not and then after that you know absalom takes off and he he runs and he's gone for about three years now you know that's the next son that that david loses amen is absalom himself because when he comes back from being in in um hallelujah just being in exile he comes back from being an exile and when he gets back you know he's coming up with all these plots and one of these days he say i see all the people coming to my daddy to get wisdom and and get this he said i just wish they would talk to me because if y'all would talk to me i would do it this way i would do it that way y'all pretty much we don't need that anymore i can take care of this and he got a few people on this side hallelujah to the lamb of god because this happens in families he got a few people lined up with him on his side come on somebody y'all i'm talk this is father's day and father's got to deal with these spirits from their sons just a few people to follow them we say you know what you know what we're going to take over this kingdom here come absalom with his great plan and you know absalom reigning now and and david's taking off running from absalom shammay is throwing rocks at him and words at him and everything and you know you was never good king in the first place and all the stuff you did god getting you back for it now just going off on them and and one fella said should i let his his head stay on him let me take his head david said no god let him talk like that for a reason leaves and goes to battle and tells all it gives all the the the soldiers uh uh he said when y'all find absalom please don't kill him leave my son let me let my son live but don't kill him when you find him please after i'm in battle and and when the boys say i s he went to told joe episode i saw absalom hanging in a tree he had this nice long hair and he went running through a tree hallelujah that nice long hair he shouldn't have had it in battle he got held up by some branches horsten ran from underneath him and he just he just he's at everybody's mercy man say uh man say i saw him in the tree he hanging in the tree by his hair he said where you saw him man how come you ain't kill himself cause if i would have killed him and then they would have told you that i killed him then you'd be killing me so i'll show you where you're at when the show joe ab way was and joab took some hearts right through absolute heart this is david's third son it says the man's got to pay fourfold and you would think after all this bad stuff that's happening to david that maybe he'd just be discouraged but no it's because he had self-fulfilling prophecy coming forth out of his mouth this is why these things had to come to pass and not after he was dead while he was living he saw four sons go well the fourth one was when david got real sick and he's on his way out of here he's leaving he's dying while he's dying there's a a report comes to him from the prophet and from also best she would say now you know what didn't you say that solomon was going to be the next king yeah i said that so why is ada niger rising up saying that he the king david had to do something real quick and and and got got to the anoint at uh uh anointed solomon made him king and sent sent word out that solomon's king and then while they out there during the ceremony somebody got to add a night and say you know what they just anointed your brother to be king say oh lord he comes back and he says you know what just i know i shouldn't have did it he kind of barely repented i said no i shouldn't have did that say but you know just don't take my life uh solomon don't say okay long as you do what you're supposed to do you you know you're gonna be all right well a few days go by and you know what adonij's problem was passion see this thing will take over families from one son to the next son to the next son his problem was a passion he wanted abhishek the concubine to be his wife and they said anytime you took a king's concubine as your wife that meant you had claim to the throne he says he says he says he said he says uh um ask solomon cannot have abhishek he said but bathsheba acts solomon can have episode and solomon says no sons he won't he won't claim to the throne that's what he wants so he got he got he got a greater problem than passion now you're going to lose his life because of that request and he calls somebody to go follow my brother his fourth son dead because he said fourfold now the grace part the sovereign grace is that he didn't lose his own life and another part of sovereign grace is that the woman that he had a passion problem with god gave her a second son and that boy became king see sovereign grace from a sovereign father and i'm gonna tell you something about sovereign grace it don't have to ask anybody for permission does whatever it wants to do when it wants to do it without any explanation let me tell you something you fathers that have repented your fathers that might have done some things wrong but you have repented that is under the blood and you don't have to let nobody hold nothing over your head because you have sovereign grace from a sovereign father and your sovereign father didn't have to ask anybody what they thought about it [Applause] i want to just read a little bit from this message of grace i'm going to skip a little bit um paragraph 123 is where i want to start at thank god for his sovereign grace when david recognized that god knew exactly what he had done wrong he repented and psalm 51 was birthed from that experience there's a man that had a son in a straitjacket coming before the prophet to be prayed for but when he realized the reason this boy was in the straitjacket the reason this boy was in this really uh uh terrible conditions because something that the daddy did that he never repented of as soon as the daddy repented the boy went free look at this god had revealed it to that prophet said david there was a rich man lived on this side of the road and a whole lot of sheep he had a whole lot of sheep oh he was very rich a man lived on this side of road was poor he had one lamb he treated like a daughter he fed it out of the same spoon he eat with he slept with the lamb it was just like a daughter to him and one day a visitor came so instead of the rich man taking one of his own sheep and making a feast for the visitor well instead of that he went over and took the poor man's lamb and by force took the lamb and slayed it and made a fist made a feast now that was david's passions he had 500 wives but when he seen uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wives to peas or satisfy his passions he went took this other man's wife then he killed uriah when she become a mother david didn't know what he was doing why david was ready to pronounce judgment that's the way we are we can always judge the other fella but when it comes to us oh that's different david said the man will pay with his life that'll profit them eyes narrowed down said david surely you'll not die watch grace then go to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet said david's life grace surely you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house till it's thoroughly purged your heart for you you are that rich man or it was different wasn't it uh uh what what saved david when his own judgment said the man will die he'll pay to the utmost and he'll pay for it with his life and the prophet said surely grace surely you'll not die you'll not die david grace has saved you it was grace to save david david it was grace to david that saved him oh my if it hadn't been for grace where would we all be is that right certainly sovereign grace is from a sovereign one sovereign grace from a sovereign one sovereign what can it do sovereign can do whatever it wants to listen to this now sovereign grace can only be given by one that's sovereign and god is sovereign so he can he can he can give sovereign grace therefore being sovereign grace don't have to ask anybody it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't it don't has to ask can i do this or shall i do this can i must i will i doesn't do it it does it itself grace is suffering therefore he can save the violence he can save the worst he can save the impurities he can save the immoralists he can heal the sickest hallelujah i thank god for his sovereign grace i think we have many fathers here that would certainly tell their sons watch out for this watch out for that because of this and even tell their daughters watch out don't don't be like a bathsheba but she even knew where she was taking a bath at she knew where the house was located and she knew the king would be up there she went all innocent herself hallelujah so a father able to kind of tell his sons watch out for the bathshebas amen right hallelujah a father that goes through and makes mistakes and has repented a sovereign god has given sovereign grace to that father and there is nothing against him i thank god for grace like that but i want to i want to forewarn you on this father's day be careful david have this one problem of passion and that thing passed down to his sons if there's anything that i mean today men have to fight it they got to overcome it them passion problems so many people bound by pornography today god want to give you freedom over that because that will affect generations accept god's sovereign grace let's pray lord you our sovereign father that has offered us sovereign grace if we would accept it as men we have a responsibility we realize that the impact is tremendous in our families when we are not in a place where we need to be god there are times that our sin keeps us from being in the place that we need to be but lord we can stand like david create in us a clean heart renew a right spirit within us cast us not away from your presence we recognize how much we need you the father's leading his family to the house of god he's telling his children i need god i can't make it without him my life is total mess as children see that example and father for generations they follow [Music] thank you lord that we can see statistics like this and you can understand that when we make uh decisions that that please you got the impact that it has lord on the rest of our loved ones lord we thank you you've given us a great responsibility as men as fathers you've given us this great responsibility because you have confidence in us that we will do what you've called us to do you didn't change your mind about david he was guilty he was wrong but you didn't change your mind about him even you gave him the greatest compliment that any man could be given you called him a man after your own heart i pray lord this morning that you have other men here that are men after your own heart that will follow you that would serve you that would commit to you and commit to living a life that is pleasing in my sight i pray that you would deal with every heart lord and that you would just lord get the glory and honor from washing us from the inside and allow it to reflect on the outside thank you for these great fathers thank you for these great men

[Applause] stand with me and we'll sing amen just a song of worship and [Music] i want to tell you just if you're a father this morning and maybe the word has found you like the prophet found nate i mean prophet nathan found david that day and all god asks for you to just repent it's not about coming to an altar but it's in your heart right where you are just repenting before god asking him to purify you and to purge you with his make you clean just have your own personal conversation from your heart to god's heart amen the song says create in me a clean me purify me creating me a clean heart so i may worship you oh create in me a clean heart and purify me purify me creating me a clean heart so i will accept thee cast me not away from thy presence please don't take your spirit from

melody to my heart i praise you lord glory jesus praise you lord amen that was just about an hour before i touched down the lord gave me this song and the lord is so sovereign so i arrived on a thursday on the thursday i think brother jack gave you that testimony the pastor took me to her brother who is about 62 65 he was crying like just a baby who's been beaten up he was just crying he had this pain at the spine and he was just crying and crying and crying nothing could stop the pain so the person asked me to pray we prayed we read sorry james 5 to 13-17 and we prayed and in about five minutes he stopped crying and he held my hands and started blessing me in spanish and prophesying and i think rajah gave that already the lord is in my hotel room i went to um we had two services sunday we went to visit uh they called it ranch like a little town village and we had a wonderful uh they called it mariachi songs of worship and praises and the dimensions came around the lord was blessed and we didn't have service just in their home and we prayed and sang with the old pastor so i went to coahuila and we had some services over there in my hotel room the lord did something wonderful there in the morning the people come and clean your hotel room so around 11 30 the lady knocked and she said can i come and clean your room and say yes so she spoke in spanish and sometimes even in the place they have two beds even in the single rooms they have two beds so i have my bible and other stuff on one bed so she saw my blue bible on my bed and said oh eres cristiano i went christine yo tambien uh you saw christian christiana me too i'm a christian and then she started speaking english so i said oh you speak english say yes i used to live in a he's a grand rapids michigan for five years so she was happy talking english and i said well let's talk about the bible since you asked me if i was a christian so we talk about the lord a little bit we talk about some scriptures about baptism and i give the word of the lord to him that lord made the way she received everything with her heart and before i went by the judge gave me some message book he gave me cod in spanish and the resume of the church ages in spanish so i gave one to her and i asked her do you want me to pray for you she said yes we prayed and then i let it go i had another lady also the next cleaner i gave the word of the lord to her i gave her the message and that way too and one security guard who walks around i give one of the books and i prayed for for him as well so the lord was very gracious and one family that i prayed for his father actually was taken by the chronovirus and he had a four-month-old baby girl and the baby was on on the verge of dying with some respiratory problems so we prayed actually i prayed for him on the phone before i left and by the grace of the lord when we went the baby was completely healed another brother too he had cancer of a prostate cancer and it was a bad situation so he had a surgery we prayed and he sent me a message about 15 minutes message he was blessing me and preaching to me and rejoicing talking about the goodness of the lord and the lord has done it already the lord gave him the healing we thank the lord and one old pastor he passed away around the age of 86 his wife is in this 1775 somewhere and when we visited visited her we prayed with her and she had colitis and she was in tears and crying so we prayed for her we went back the next day and the lord has healed and she was rejoicing and thanking the lord for her healing and one sister they actually dropped me at the airport when i was coming the sister said the sister and the brother is called daniel and the wife is called malta in spanish martha so she said brother after your same one the lord gave me a dream i was sleeping last night and i saw the lord jesus christ come and all the body of christ we were raptured and we were moving up higher i said i can he said it's so real to my heart and i'm so happy for that dream because we've been praying for you to come and i know the lord was going to do something for me especially because she was praying for the baptism of the holy ghost she wasn't sure whether she's been born again or not so she asked me to pray for her and the lord gave her that dream and i believe to confirm that the lord has given it the best amen the lord is so good there were a lot of healing uh in places a lot of testimonies i'm still receiving testimonies and i will keep you updated ask the lord amino as i received a testimony a lot of families there's one family that were actually devastated by the coronavirus their brother his is called brother and hilberto like gilbert they call it herbert too his

them the lord sent us around his family his daughters were they were in a message but they were not going to services for years the daughters were reconciled to the lord his son gave me a church book in spanish i gave it to his son he's got three girls and had son so i give it to his son and all his family now want to come back to the word of the lord and so sometimes the lord can use adversity to bring blessing unto his people so just i don't want to keep you too long that's there's a lot of testimonies but i don't want to hold you too long so let's stand and have a lot of prayer yesterday
