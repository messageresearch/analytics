over all the saints while we were away father one from the other but you brought us back together again and we're grateful to be here tonight god it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen praise the lord amen if you just get your bibles i'm going to read a scripture and while you're doing that just a couple of things that i just need to make mention of um we are certainly like happy that the lord opened this door for us to be here and fellowship and those that are joining us online we've been disconnected for a couple weeks but we are in a new location uh having our services and uh just something that the lord has done for this season it's a temporary location amen till we get to our permanent location that god has promised us so we're happy for this uh but uh just want to make mention for our mothers a man uh that with with the children this room right over here with this window is gonna be our nursery amen for our mothers so it's like when they designed this they had us in mind right so so the mothers we got a nursery is right over here so if you if you're sitting on this side it's much easier to get in and out of there but if you're sitting on this side just go out that door and back around to get to the nursery and man that way uh we won't have anybody just walking right in front here the uh other thing is for those that the restroom is outside just go out the hall and just on the other side of this wall there's a men's restroom and a women's restroom over there and uh uh so that's where you go to do that and uh i think uh oh the offering box is there for those that um want to give there and we still have the online amen giving and and we just thank god for that so i think that's all i need to okay all right um wishing sister sister brown a happy birthday on yesterday god bless you thank god for for blessing her with another year how we really appreciate our precious sister amen and just a couple other things here um our morning prayer service has changed we no longer do are able to do the seven o'clock service right now but we will have this space available at 9 00 am so if you desire to come for prayer it will be open on sunday morning from 9 a.m to 10 a.m and then our regular sunday morning services start at 10 30 a.m uh we'll continue to stream through twitter and facebook and now this week we do have our uh tape service and that's done in the in your home uh we'll be listening to the message faith without works is dead amen and and that's 53 905. uh if you want to take a picture of that later on just so you'll have that information um uh for yourself that'd be great and um we have unfortunately we have time limits while we're here and but i know that um this is like i said it's temporary and so i won't speak too long tonight because we have a couple of things we have to get uh break down and all that and and have service and break down before we actually leave so um but we'll do the best we can and this will be our first little run and we'll see how things go amen but it's i'm glad to see y'all amen i'm glad to see all of you all it's so good to be in the house of the lord so i i just want to read from luke 17 luke 17. amen this is just um a scripture that i typically go back to when i guess there are certain milestones that that happen in in life at least ministry and things like that and um i just took some time just to do a little reflecting a man and and i just want to go back to this scripture i want to uh just speak tonight on the title gratefulness amen gratefulness uh so here in luke 17 verse 11 it says and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god uh and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and they said unto him arise go thy way thy faith have made thee whole amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated amen and um like i said i just wanted to um speak on the subject of of gratefulness amen gratefulness and um just uh um to start here we are we're here on the next phase of our journey amen on the next phase this is uh not the ending phase just the next phase and uh you know and as i was approaching you know this first service i know it'd be september first would be our wednesday night service and typically i do the teaching on wednesday night but um i was just feeling in my spirit uh let i wanted to speak this first service rather than just you know do our our normal bible bible study i just wanted to speak here and um i was thinking on this and i found it to be very very interesting i will use the word providential that god had a studying in the in the book of ephesians amen and and we kind of got to the halfway point in ephesians and we we our study stopped you know not only were we teaching in ephesians but uh the lord had us preaching on the seven junctions amen and i think that is providential a man as the tender hand of jehovah has moved us to this location i think it was i think it was god uh i want to just maybe read a little quote here and and i want to also just mention as i say this a lot of things have changed so even as we do the quotes you'll see a different uh system that we're using uh than what we had before and uh but i think it's gonna be it's gonna be good i'm glad that we're kind of moving in this direction um when i was in uh alaska they were using this system and i said i like that i like what they're doing so i'm glad that we're able to implement this too so uh just bear with us we're just doing things a little different but but i wanna just say uh i'm gonna read a quote from the message to god who is rich in mercy and um just want you to think about this because again here we were in the midst of in the middle of the book of ephesians teaching and we're also at the end of the preaching of the series of the seven junctions uh and god at that time allowed us to transition amen i think there's there's something to all of this so uh here in this um uh uh the message to god who is rich and mercy the prophet says now if many of you like to just mark down scriptures that a minister reads and i would like for you to tonight if you would turn to ephesians and he says and i was speaking last sunday on the ephesians how that the book of joshua was the ephesians of the old testament and how it was a book of redemption now this is important to me because he's saying the book of joshua was the ephesians of the old testament and how it was a book of redemption okay and when we when we go back and we look at the book of joshua uh what happens in joshua is that the people uh not only have come into the promised land but now they are dividing up into their inheritance amen which is in the land and and i find that i think that's that's uh to me very special especially during this time because um i think that we're gonna find as we're going through this season that different people are gonna rise up doing different things uh and you're gonna start seeing their gifting coming out if i can put it that way right you're gonna start noticing some of the gifts but i'm gonna tell you something it's only when we get under pressure that the real lust comes out right i mean it's only when you know when when the pressure is there that's when you start seeing people step up and and step into position and things like that so it's i think it's very providential that here we studying on ephesians ephesians is a type of joshua and joshua was a time where it was placed in the promised land here it'll be a spiritual promised land that we're placed in so i'm looking forward to seeing what god's going to do in this season the the quote goes on says and redemption has two different parts oh hallelujah come out of and entering into hallelujah amen you got to come out of in order to enter into first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world to enter into christ you have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of god behind to enter into faith and i believe amen i know brother branham is using this as a type of people coming out of the world but in our transition it took a step of faith amen to say no we're not going to do that no we're not going to pay that that is not the vision that god gave us and it took a step of faith to just just uproot and leave like that it's much easier just to say well you know we ain't got nowhere else to go but god made a way right god made a way yeah we do have somewhere to go hallelujah amen but we have to be able to come out in order to go in and in the midst of coming out to go in we're going to see how god is placing the different people in their positions hallelujah amen and that was the book of ephesians of the old testament joshua where moses represented the law could not save no one but grace could and here joshua's the same word like jesus jehovah's savior says and now when we find that we have to come to another ephesians another episode now where that in our intellectual denomination so forth and all of our educational programs has come to us jordan then we must have an ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the rapture so we thank god for that now uh in one statement he says ephesians parallels the book of joshua uh you see i just read the book of joshua's ephesians of the old testament and how it was a book of redemption and so i thought about you know since we were in the book of ephesians doing our study and we're still there i wanted to go back and just look at a couple scriptures amen uh from the book of ephesians that that relate to redemption let's pull up ephesians 1 verse 6 through 7. amen ephesians 1 verse 6 through 7 praise the lord it says to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted uh in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood amen the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen amen in whom we have redemption through his blood uh the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace also we're skipping down to verse 13 and 14 in the same chapter says in whom he also trusted that after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen also in ephesians chapter 4 verse 29 through 32 we look he told us that the book of ephesians of amen the book of joshua was ephesians of the old testament and it was a book of redemption so we're looking at these scriptures that are related to redemption in the book of ephesians ephesians 4 verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of the edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speak and be put away from you with all malice amen verse 32 says and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you if there ever was a time for the church to be kind to one another amen to be tenderhearted with one another we all going through transition and change ain't easy for everybody right so so we have to learn to just be kind and sometimes you know you have to just go uh go the extra mile to be kind praise the lord somebody amen sometimes you're gonna want to say something but you got to check yourself right you're gonna have to check yourself and say no i ain't gonna say that right i'm not i'm not gon i'm not i thought it but i ain't gonna say it you're gonna have to sometimes you go you're gonna wanna a man give a piece of your mind but keep a piece of your mind because if you keep giving out a piece of your mind you ain't gonna have no more mind right so keep a peace of your mind hallelujah glory to god but if there's ever time for for spirit and truth tabernacle to be kind and amen and tender-hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has given up for giving us forgiving you this is that time right now we want to practice this hallelujah hallelujah amen i was just you know just thinking on that and like i said i believe it's very providential that we're in the book of ephesians teaching on wednesday nights and then also coming to the end of the seven junctions and then god would allow this junction to take place how we thank god for it and as i was just reflecting praise the lord um thought about you know us coming here to this middle school and um i said okay that's you know a little different and there's a couple couple things that i need to say that when i first started out in ministry one of the things that i actually was not wanting to do is go to a school that was one of the things i didn't want to do now i i when i was with brother wesko in the early days we went to the school i used to have to be the guy to go and meet the janitor as i'm talking about as a teenager meet the janitor just to watch over the place until the church came and and but i remember us breaking down and setting up and breaking down and said i said lord i don't want to do to break down and set up i that's just not that's not that ain't what i want to do but god it's god is a good god right and uh and and when we were um fewer in number god honored that but now that we have more help we can handle it you understand we can handle it and and there are some things that i want to say i'm grateful for tonight right i i watched a lot of things that just even during this process and and i'll get to that in a little bit just bear with me but but i'm grateful for what i've been seeing and what i know god is getting ready to do i believe god is positionally placing us getting us ready for our church but we got to have people in place amen already anointed and doing the job not not waiting to do the job but anointed and doing the job and people can recognize those gifts are just flowing oh hallelujah brother branham you know i've thought about this saying now you know we come to a a junior high school and i say you know what brother branham preached in a junior high school one of the most important sermons that uh that we needed to hear was preaching a junior high school but it wasn't just that one sermon he actually did a series of sermons amen and and the messages were the seed is not air with the shook preached at parkview junior high school all right if then he went to the next uh the next sermon this day this scripture is fulfilled important sermons oh hallelujah then he preached god's chosen place of worship hallelujah and after he preached those three sermons then the next one that was really important marriage and divorce hallelujah glory to god and his fifth and final sermon at parkview junior high school was who is this melchizedek right these are very important sermons that that were preached in a junior high school we don't know what god's gonna have preached in this junior high school that's gonna impact people we just wanna be obedient to where he leads us so i want to just pick up a quote here from this who is this melchizedek amen just read it to you and i'll turn amen to gratefulness this is this is this is uh just a little something that he said here in this message that he preached five sermons and here he is at the uh and the fifth sermon at the beginning of the sermon he makes his statement says and now i want to thank the people i want to thank the people for their fine cooperation it says the people of the city here also who gave us let us have the renting of this schoolhouse it says the renting of the the people that the people of this city let us have the renting of this schoolhouse this auditorium and the gym and i want to thank the officials if you're here and also i want to thank houston calvin which is the custodian here now here brother branham is is is is acknowledging the people that are opening and closing hallelujah you know it's in my heart to do some some things for the custodians here i would like to bless them with gift cards sometime have dinner on us right i mean we just want to do something just to be a blessing to them let's not just be like any other church but since god brought us here let's be a blessing to somebody amen maybe at some point in time we'll do something for the principal right i mean we just want to bless you thank you for opening up the schoolhouse to allow us to come in and have church glory to god it says and i also want to thank houston calvin which is a custodian here for his fine cooperation helping us to get this and being with us each night we thank the jeffersonville police force for coming up here and watching with a real cheap cost i think about two dollars an hour that the police would put up here on special duty to park the cars to see there was nothing happen and everything was all right we're grateful hallelujah we're grateful to the people for that and uh uh and also the engineer on the board i've noticed him and all that's affiliated with this we are certainly grateful to you here brother branham preaches in a junior high school and and he mentions you know this this thought of just you know all these people that were involved in and making things happen and he was expressing his gratefulness hallelujah gratefulness means to be warmly or deeply appreciative of the kindness or benefits received it's to be thankful um amen is to express or actuate it by gratitude and and i was just kind of thinking on a little something that happened to me uh some years ago i was um reading a newspaper in my car one morning on the way to work i was just looking down at the newspaper just kind of reading a little bit we're stopped at a light and i'm just reading the paper but somehow i let my foot off the the gas i mean off the brake a little bit and that my car just ran right into this other lady car i said i can't believe i just hit this lady like this so you know we had to stop and she got out and she looked at her car she said you know let me get your number and and um and and i'll take it to my mechanic and i'll just let him take a look at it and you know if everything good you know you want you won't owe me anything it'll be all right i said okay well here's my number and and i didn't hear from her for a little bit so i reached out to him saying you know is everything all right you know uh um you know did you uh you know did you have to get the car fixed do i owe you anything she said no no no everything was good you don't owe me anything you know it's it's all good so i had her address and since i had an address and i was grateful the lady could have told me something another story right and i would i could have been paying all kind of money but uh i mean she did it in such a way that my insurance was not impacted right i it didn't have to be reported to insurance and you know so so uh and then when when um when uh when when a mechanic looked it over and she said well it didn't cost me nothing i'm not charging you nothing so since i had an address i decided to send a vase of roses and a letter a personal letter of thanks just to tell the lady thank you right i was expressing my gratitude and what she did was actually send me back a note amen melded back to me expressing her appreciation for my gratefulness hallelujah oh hallelujah i want you to understand sometime when you show gratefulness amen it will return back to you oh hallelujah and i'm here tonight to show my lord and savior that i am grateful no i didn't want to go to a school when i was younger in ministry but lord i'm grateful i'm grateful that you open up a door for us to be able to come and have fellowship oh hallelujah i was looking at this word grateful from my illumina amen software and it says gratitude is a natural expression of thanks in response to blessings it's a natural expression of thanks in response to protection or love right that said in judeo-christian tradition gratitude is not a tool used to mimic to manipulate the will of god it is never coerced or fabricated in one's mind rather gratitude is a joyful commitment of one's personality to god now i went back in my mind as i was thinking on this if i recall our last service amen one of the songs uh that was being played was uh uh thanks thanks i give you thanks for all you've done and what what it was is a journey down memory lane of 13 years that god provided and he's still providing so we say thanks thanks for all you've done i am so blessed my soul is at rest lord i give you thanks that's how we left amen we left our last amen uh uh address giving god thanks and we entered into the next phase of this amen of our journey and we're still giving god thanks it's an attitude of gratitude glory to god here they made another statement in here um children of israel when they receive good news they thank god for his goodness and great deeds and and i and i want to read a scripture out of that go to first chronicles 16 8 through 12. oh my when they receive good news they thank god oh yes hallelujah first first chronicles 16 8-12 my god my god look at what it says here give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known as deeds among the people sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually and look at this verse here remember my god remember his marvelous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth sometimes we need to take a trip down memory lane and just remember what god has done and when you find yourself grateful for the things that he has done then he'll start doing more but rather than complain about anything let's just remember what he has done they said count your blessings one by one you look back and see all the things that god has done so here the children of israel they gave thanks to god when they received good news but it also said here in the lumina software when they received bad news they also gave thanks trusting that he was a just god can i pull up just job 1 21. amen oh hallelujah god you're worthy oh hallelujah hallelujah job121 see even in in bad times they still gave thanks now i'm gonna tell you i don't think this is a bad time amen i don't think it's a bad time i think god is in this right but but but even in life sometimes we go through good days and sometimes we go through bad days but but like the sons say i won't complain because my my my my good days outweigh my bad days and here in job 1 21 it says and this is when job got all this bad news coming at him and and he was sick sick of the death he says him naked came out out of my mother's womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave come on somebody and the lord have taken away now i like i like that i like that statement the lord gave i can tell you right now god gave us 39 51 heavy hill road sweet 109. god did that himself and when he allowed that note to be put on the door on my birthday it was the lord taken away but notice job's response after the lord gave and after the lord took away joel's response was blessed come on somebody you got to have an attitude of gratitude bless that be the name of the lord he is still wanting to be praised i'm going to still give him glory i'll praise him in the good times i'll praise him in the bad times i'll praise him at all times let his praise continually be in my mouth david said my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear the of him be glad he says oh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together the lord gave the lord took away but blessed be the name of the lord and do and you you know the end of job's story job actually ended up with more on the end he got doubled for his trouble oh i i'm i'm under i'm under some real expectation y'all i'm telling you i'm under some some serious expectation i don't know what god gave me to do but i know it's about to be something powerful it's a mighty mighty mighty but i'ma have an attitude of gratitude all the way through amen let me try to finish up here the children of israel would give god praise anytime he they were delivered from their enemies and maybe it will take time to just read some of these psalms 18 17. anytime they were delivered from their enemies they would give god praise my psalm 18 and 17 it says this um he delivered me from my strong enemy and for them which hated me for they were too strong for me so they gave praise when they were delivered from their enemies when they were delivered from death they gave praise psalm 30 verse 8 through 12. they they were delivered from death and i tell you we have been delivered from death there's there's many that i've heard that have churches that have suffered so greatly from this covet and even the new delta variant uh uh one church was one brothers tell them say they had a hundred people in the church that were all infected and um and and i think six or seven died out of that hundred and and and god's been good to us nobody's lost no lies lost you know by by by the grace of god so i'm grateful lord i'm grateful amen hallelujah he stayed the hand of death here in psalms 30 verse 8 through 12 it says this um i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall i shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper thou has turned for me my mourning into dancing thou has put off of my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent no i'm not coming here to be silent amen oh lord my god i will give thanks unto thee forever another time they gave uh uh uh they were grateful to god it's when just just because he forgave them of their sins amen if you've just been forgiven you need to be grateful right that you find that in psalm 32 and 5 amen they were forgiven of the sins so they were grateful here david says i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions and the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin salah and that's the loss just a little pause amen and meditating on what god has done also they they were grateful for god's answer to prayer psalm 28 and 6. amen psalm 28 and 6 oh hallelujah blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications yeah god is god i've said it before and i believe god answers every prayer it's either going to be yes it's going to be no or it's going gonna be not yet but he answers every prayer but they they gave praise and they were grateful amen to god for answering prayers and also here in psalm 34 they had they were grateful for god's compassions toward the afflicted and the oppressed and this is the scripture that i was just quoting and i'll start at verse 1 it says i will bless the lord at all times his praise should continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear their of and be glad oh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together and i just felt as i was reading this i felt david kind of speaking to me david kind of tends to not not now brother jack i can i can praise him by myself i can do it by myself but i'm just asking magnify him with me hallelujah oh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked them to him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed oh hallelujah no my face is not a shame i i i i you know oh hallelujah all that that scripture that sister tina gave us that he said my people will not be made ashamed oh oh glory to god you know i'm gonna tell you right now there are many people many churches meeting in a school and do not have the ability to go out and buy a church they're trying to save money now but god had blessed us before we came here so we're not ashamed we're just waiting we're just waiting on the lord and and what we realize that he the bible tells me all things work together for goods to them who are called according to his purpose so so i just got i got sense enough to believe that if this the door god opened he wanted us to be here for a reason all right let me keep reading here verse verse five says they looked unto him and were lightened and her face was not ashamed this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel lord and campeth round about them that fear him and deliver them o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him hallelujah oh thank you jesus i was um just you know thinking on this and they got one more scripture that i want to read out of first testimonies 5 18. so they said here in the illumina software they gave god praise in the good times they also gave god praise in the bad times and say paul picks it up amen in the new testament and it says because the expression of gratitude is tied so closely to the response of faith notice this the expression of gratitude is tied closely to the response of faith says paul encouraged believers to give thanks in all things first thessalonians 5 18 in everything give thanks in everything give thanks why for this is the will of god you want to know what the will of god is give thanks this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you i thought about these ten lepers that were healed and this is why i say every time we have a milestone in my life or even in the ministry i always tend to go back to the scripture in um luke 17 those 10 lepers that were healed and we saw you know they they were obedient by just going to show themselves to the priests and i won't dig too deep into all of that tonight i'm kind of winding up so that we can uh we won't go over time but uh but they went back and they here here they're on the way to be in obedience they're going to the uh to see the priests and and all of them recognized in the obedience that they all had been healed everybody was healed through obedience they were healed but what we find is one man that was a samaritan that was a part of this group of lepers um this man recognized his healing had taken place as he was being obedient right he recognized his healing and through that he turned around uh he left the other ones going to do whatever they was planning on doing but he turned around because brother branham said when left when you when you contracted leprosy the only person that could heal you was god the priest could just look on it and actually say either you're healed or you're not healed but the priest didn't do the healing god is the only one that can heal a person of leprosy right when moses stuck his hand in his bosom and it turned leopards and then he pulled it out and put it back in and it was it was clean again it showed that god was the only one that could actually cure leprosy so this man recognized that only god could take care of leprosy i was obedient to what he told me to do but as i was on my way this man told me what to do and as i was on my way i was made whole and i'm going back to give praise to the one that made it happen for me i'mma show my gratefulness and i love the way the scripture said the man did not come silently the bible say the man came with a loud voice can you imagine this man amen on on the streets glory to god i can i can just hear him uh coming down the corner thank you jesus glory to your name i mean can you imagine hallelujah jesus you be praised i mean he got everybody's attention the way that he was expressing his gratefulness hallelujah church i'll tell you i i just want to show i just want to show how grateful i am i thought it was just very very important for us to start this first service just just being grateful i had when we were head to school i had a devotion that i was doing with the students and a couple of statements about gratitude it's hard for a shallow it's hard for shallow whining to find a foothold in the heart of a grateful person it's hard for shallow whining to find a foothold in the heart of a grateful person there is no room for demanding behavior in the life of a grateful person voicing our gratitude humbles us leaving no room for pride expressing gratitude to god actually builds our faith expressing gratitude to god builds our faith and confidence in him when we express our gratitude to god it builds our faith and our confidence in him making doubt take a backseat i just i want you to think about this expressing gratitude to god builds our faith and confidence in him making doubt take a back seat and again i'm expressing gratitude on multiple fronts i i i want to remember the things he's already done because as i expressed gratitude on what he's already done that builds my faith to say you know if he done it before he can do it again it put out it put doubt in the back seat gratitude guards us from what would destroy us in this last little statement the same lips that off off of thanksgiving are less likely to complain bling or gossip the same lips that offer thanksgiving are less likely to complain blame or gossip and if there's ever time for us to be showing love to one another being tenderhearted it's that time right now and the way that we do that is just by just being grateful sometimes it's good for you just to you know tell your brother sister i'm just i'm just happy you here

let's have an attitude of gratitude remember it's you know um as i was just kind of reading these little statements here expressing gratitude to god builds our faith and confidence in him making doubt take a back seat and that's exactly what we want doubt at in the back seat let's bound the word of prayer my flowing from my heart is gratefulness grateful for all that you've done god as paul told us that in everything we're to give you thanks and lord that's exactly what we've come here to do tonight just so much that i've seen and lord just threw out this time and it's just been a real blessing to my eyes just to behold it believe lord there's a positioning taking place you're you're you're positioning your people or for where exactly where you want them people rising up doing exactly what they need to do nobody asking them they see what needs to be done they step into it i thank you for that god thank you for the faithfulness of the saints lord who have stood with the ministry lord over these years and father even standing right now and thank you for that and i know lord that you got something great in store for each and every one of us that we'll just celebrate but we don't have to wait to to rejoice we can start rejoicing right now we can start expressing our appreciation and gratitude right now we don't have to wait for anything but i pray that you would just continue to bless every step that we're taking lord the saints that are watching i thank you for their faithfulness lord some have been waiting for uh the services to come back online i thank you for their faithfulness i thank you for those that give faithfully to this ministry we might not even see him walk through the door but god we have an expectation that one day they will be able to come and fellowship with us god i just appreciate you pray lord your blessings upon each and every one lord even as we leave this place tonight but not your presence bless thee the custodians bless the principal the teachers the students gotta let this be a school that the virus will not have an outbreak here god let it be a place where violence would not outbreak here god let your angels watch over this place [Music] the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear [Music] and deliver them from all their troubles we apply that scripture to this location god we just give you praise we give you honor we give you glory it's in jesus name we pray amen other thing that we found out when we came here [Music] the custodians that told us when we came in it says no one has used this room for the last year and a half and i said what we say once again no one's used this room for the last year and a half they actually look and still looking trying to find a teacher that can hire to do you know this course program but uh but with no one using it it actually gave us the ability to be able to kind of come in and set up and leave most of the things in place so we don't have to do a lot of breakdown instead of praise the lord so until they tell us we're going to leave a pulpit here take some you know important equipment and things like that our cameras we're not going to leave out but uh but but you know some of the things we're just going to leave right in place and one of the blessings that the lord has given us through this journey two things we we got a less expensive keyboard because moving that that really expensive keyboard around we didn't want to break it or have any any mishap so the lord blessed us we went out and bought this a man keyboard just so that we'll be ready and they have not given us the the okay to play that baby brand over there but if they give us okay we'll be playing that too uh and the other thing is that we got ourselves a a set of electric drums so we can just fold them up and unfold them on sunday mornings make it real easy amen for us so so god is good god is good and we're we are grateful grateful grateful let's just sing this of course to this song and we'll prepare to leave say i am grateful for the things that he had done yes i'm grateful for the victories we've won and i could go on and on and on [Music] to praise you lord my [Music] his gratefulness praise the lord amen god bless you church amen i've said the dismissive prayer and uh we will be back here on uh sunday morning nine o'clock it will open up for prayer we have a few pillows and we'll bring the rest of them here we even have a they're giving us a little storage room to store some things everything is right here i'm telling they designed this room for us for such a time as this so we thank god so um be careful as you're going out amen and i think a few of the brothers will have to stay behind just to kind of tidy up some things but let me just say another quick word of prayer and we'll just let everybody go okay father we thank you again for this night and all that you've done and all that you will do bless us now as we leave this place but not your presence give us travel and mercies as we go to and fro bring us back at the point of time is our prayer in jesus name amen god bless you god bless you to those that are online amen
