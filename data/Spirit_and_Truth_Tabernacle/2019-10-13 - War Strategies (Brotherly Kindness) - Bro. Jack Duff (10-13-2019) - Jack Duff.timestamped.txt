[1:00:22] last night my sister was Darren church
[1:00:26] that was a real blessing to see her in a
[1:00:29] manner just you know I just know that so
[1:00:32] many were encouraged they've been my
[1:00:34] vital services so thank you all for
[1:00:36] going and making them a man work what
[1:00:39] they were a man we certainly certainly
[1:00:41] appreciate that I also want to thank
[1:00:43] Lord for his traveling mercies to all
[1:00:45] the saints that were away on last
[1:00:48] weekend
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:52] Canada a man we had we had a quite a few
[1:00:57] that word were out but seemed like we
[1:01:00] had a lot of food show up for church
[1:01:01] last week - that was a real blessing
[1:01:04] they met him and brother late and it's
[1:01:06] did a wonderful job he told us that he
[1:01:08] won got preached at heart but church
[1:01:10] pulled it right out huh
[1:01:13] three so that was that was real real
[1:01:15] special we thank the Lord for that and
[1:01:18] also I I had to leave on Wednesday and
[1:01:22] go up to Galax Virginia for a funeral
[1:01:26] service there and now the family was
[1:01:31] just telling me how much they just
[1:01:33] appreciate
[1:01:35] deserving of their loved one mr. Baum he
[1:01:39] was a gentleman that lived out of the
[1:01:40] which'll be Florida that we would go and
[1:01:41] visit periodically just to you know pray
[1:01:44] with him and everything and you know his
[1:01:48] caregiver they actually have we call him
[1:01:51] caregiver but Pancho just they just did
[1:01:54] what other human should do and he said
[1:01:57] he just could he saw him there in law
[1:01:59] and said just can't leave me here alone
[1:02:00] feeling like this and you know just the
[1:02:02] way that you're going through things I
[1:02:04] just can't leave you like this so just
[1:02:05] got to do it I gotta do it then fine Cho
[1:02:08] said that mr. Baum had something where
[1:02:13] he had to wear a diaper and said he he
[1:02:17] went through 34 diapers I want to say in
[1:02:19] about one or two nights about 34 diapers
[1:02:23] so upon Joe called me and you know and
[1:02:26] and I went out to visit and I just you
[1:02:28] know said a word of Prayer for mr.
[1:02:30] Vaughn he said he said after you prayed
[1:02:33] that prayer I want changing diapers like
[1:02:36] that anymore
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:41] so I say well praise the Lord you know
[1:02:45] and I think I just saw enough for him to
[1:02:49] say that there's something about this
[1:02:50] group of people so long I mean yesterday
[1:02:54] Saturday morning Pancho Simha meet you
[1:02:57] at the church you know with Jovi and it
[1:02:59] came to service on yesterday morning so
[1:03:01] that was a real blessing to see I
[1:03:03] understood everything the preacher was
[1:03:04] saying and he said I might go back this
[1:03:08] morning so I don't know we'll find out
[1:03:10] if he if he showed up at night but
[1:03:13] you know our hope is that when people
[1:03:15] going through things like this
[1:03:18] they're transitioning and that if we can
[1:03:20] just say something to help somebody
[1:03:22] long-awaited
[1:03:24] they'll get glory out of it we took a
[1:03:27] sermon title amen the value of eternal
[1:03:32] life
[1:03:33] you know I told that people say out the
[1:03:35] reason I would leave West Palm Beach to
[1:03:37] come to Galax is because I value eternal
[1:03:39] life and I trust that God will say
[1:03:42] something too to call somebody you know
[1:03:45] to turn their heart towards a little
[1:03:47] series and I would go see Mr Bond
[1:03:49] because I value eternal life and then we
[1:03:52] do these things because there's value to
[1:03:54] eternal life
[1:03:55] phrasing when I was you know we've come
[1:03:57] to church and brother Branham was
[1:03:59] preaching and why Christ speak and he
[1:04:01] started off and he made a statement that
[1:04:03] struck me then and I said when I saw it
[1:04:05] a circuit is cisterna and I'm taking you
[1:04:08] know to get laxen you said they said if
[1:04:10] I if I had the opportunity to go back
[1:04:12] and be 20 years old again I had a button
[1:04:14] that I could press and go back and be 20
[1:04:16] years old again and they're saying and
[1:04:18] live at the age of 24 about 10,000 years
[1:04:22] but in the end it was 10,000 years be
[1:04:25] lost or I had a blessing that I could
[1:04:28] press right now die right now and going
[1:04:30] to eternal life so I would press the
[1:04:32] button to die right now I go towards
[1:04:33] eternal life I said wow what a statement
[1:04:37] there's value to eternal life right so
[1:04:40] you know we were just moved by that and
[1:04:43] I was sharing that with
[1:04:45] and you know I just pray that some seed
[1:04:47] was dropped in a brother sermon say they
[1:04:49] heard the gospel today brother
[1:04:51] I say well praise the Lord were
[1:04:54] certainly happy a man that we could
[1:04:56] serve the family and trust and God would
[1:04:59] just give glory and our going make man
[1:05:02] income and so it meant thank you for
[1:05:04] your prayers thank you for your prayers

[1:06:42] they were supposed to be going to
[1:06:45] brother Nathan's there and in Louisville
[1:06:51] Jeffersonville area New Albany they were
[1:06:54] supposed to come with us but at the last
[1:06:56] minute they

[1:07:01] of work some of the shelters because of
[1:07:03] Hurricane Dorian that was approaching

[1:07:10] you know it said we can't have anybody
[1:07:12] out at this time so they they allow them
[1:07:17] to take time this week so they decided
[1:07:21] well while we are always all the way up
[1:07:22] here we might as well go on over the
[1:07:25] brother Frey and and be part of those
[1:07:26] meetings I said that's a good plan so

[1:07:33] solicit your prayers I'm going for I
[1:07:37] think I have to preach on Thursday night
[1:07:39] so I'll go for Thursday night Friday but
[1:07:44] I'll be back home on Saturday because I
[1:07:48] want to be here on Sunday my schedules
[1:07:50] been really really tight as of Lading
[1:07:54] and I some things that I had actually
[1:07:57] planned and then things that just end up
[1:07:59] on your schedule right one of the things
[1:08:01] that I did plans at the end of the month
[1:08:03] October Isaiah Brooks do not be out
[1:08:05] there to visit him in in Des Moines Iowa
[1:08:09] and you know and I had that plan for
[1:08:12] four months and then I was setting all
[1:08:14] these other things just kind of jumped
[1:08:16] on the calendar I say well Lord you know
[1:08:18] we'll do it we can't so I was I was
[1:08:20] really really weary and tired and and as
[1:08:23] I was just looking at my calendar and
[1:08:24] some of the things I had on I said Lord
[1:08:26] that I'm gonna need some strength I just
[1:08:28] can't do this on my own
[1:08:29] and and I just felt God just give me a
[1:08:32] strength a man as I travel you know
[1:08:35] there to Galax it was getting in that
[1:08:37] midnight you know it's not easy leaving
[1:08:41] here 10 o'clock at night you get there
[1:08:43] at midnight in hotel room 1 o'clock in
[1:08:45] the morning have to be at the the
[1:08:48] service at 11:00 and that's an hour
[1:08:50] drive from your hotel and and I had
[1:08:53] brother Sherman Collins there brother if
[1:08:54] you care early we can do this we can do
[1:08:56] that
[1:08:58] I just don't see it happening
[1:09:04] and so I'll certainly get there as soon
[1:09:07] as I can you know and we get there and
[1:09:09] you know and do the service and spend a
[1:09:11] little time the family didn't go to our
[1:09:13] drive back to the airport to jump on the
[1:09:16] plane to get home at at 12:00 again and
[1:09:19] that plane running late and it's like
[1:09:20] you get home to your bay at 1:00 o'clock
[1:09:22] in the morning then you got services
[1:09:23] that brother smiley the next day so it
[1:09:25] starts to wear on you you know it really
[1:09:28] really starts swearing but you know we
[1:09:30] just think III said this I rather be
[1:09:32] tired for Jesus I rather be wat for
[1:09:38] Jesus then than anything else and I
[1:09:41] realized we gotta take care of our
[1:09:43] health we got to be careful in these
[1:09:44] things so I do have a little little
[1:09:46] something coming up next month where I'm
[1:09:48] gonna get four days of relaxation and a
[1:09:51] little vacation baby I have to try to
[1:09:57] insert things like that too so no
[1:09:59] services no I mean no preaching that I
[1:10:02] know of unless somebody approached me
[1:10:04] and xrx ask me questions but but no
[1:10:07] scheduled services or nothing like that
[1:10:08] you know just just relaxation so four
[1:10:11] days of that and I can see that coming
[1:10:15] so you all keep us in prayer amen keep
[1:10:18] us in prayer god bless you well we want
[1:10:23] to continue our journey a man we have a
[1:10:28] couple more sermons in this series of
[1:10:32] war strategies and and you know I pray
[1:10:35] that as we're going through these that
[1:10:38] you would use some of the strategies for
[1:10:40] the trials that you're facing all right
[1:10:43] God don't just give us this just so it
[1:10:45] can be something going when they're not
[1:10:47] the other but this is for the trial that
[1:10:49] you face it I mean it's not something
[1:10:51] that's gonna happen you know 40 or 50
[1:10:54] years when I was happening right now
[1:10:56] that's right and if you would just apply
[1:10:58] some of this strategy you might be able
[1:10:59] to overcome all right so so we want to
[1:11:02] just kind of continue amen our journey
[1:11:04] here
[1:11:06] in in war strategies we want to deal
[1:11:09] with the subject of brotherly kindness
[1:11:11] today applying the strategy of brotherly
[1:11:13] kindness a man so let's stand to our
[1:11:15] feet let's read a couple scriptures and
[1:11:20] and then we will go from there
[1:11:23] our theme is found in 2nd Peter chapter
[1:11:26] 1 a man-thing
[1:11:29] and the foundation of this this this
[1:11:34] series is here in 2nd Peter chapter 1
[1:11:36] starting at verse 3 according as his
[1:11:39] divine power hath given unto us all
[1:11:41] things that pertain unto life and
[1:11:43] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:11:45] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[1:11:47] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:11:51] great and precious promises that by
[1:11:54] these you might be partakers of the
[1:11:57] divine nature having escaped the
[1:11:59] corruption that is in the world through
[1:12:01] lust and decide this given all diligence
[1:12:05] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:12:07] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:12:09] and to temperance patience and to
[1:12:10] patience godliness and to godliness
[1:12:12] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:12:14] kindness charity but if these things be
[1:12:17] in you right so they have to be in you
[1:12:20] manifesting themselves out out of you
[1:12:22] this is what God has called us to if
[1:12:24] these things be in you and abound they
[1:12:30] got to stay there because the trials
[1:12:32] will come to test to see if they're
[1:12:34] there or not right if these things be in
[1:12:36] you and abound they make you that ye
[1:12:40] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[1:12:43] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[1:12:50] is blind and cannot see afar off and
[1:12:54] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[1:12:58] his old sins a man wherefore the rather
[1:13:02] brethren give diligence to make your
[1:13:04] calling and election sure but if you do
[1:13:07] these things a man
[1:13:10] you shall never fall I want to go back
[1:13:13] to First Samuel chapter 30 and read from
[1:13:17] there and I forgot to also just mention
[1:13:22] we we will be doing a meeting our selves
[1:13:25] and in February it would be February the
[1:13:32] the weekend of Valentine's Day
[1:13:35] we got brother Aaron McGarry coming and
[1:13:38] also brother Danny steamin a man have
[1:13:41] you coming to preach for us a man during
[1:13:45] those meetings so just want to let
[1:13:47] everybody know and I mean I'm going to
[1:13:51] just ask last year we did those meetings
[1:13:54] and and most people didn't realize that
[1:13:56] there was a tremendous expense behind it
[1:13:59] almost about $5,000 that that was paid
[1:14:02] you know just to make those meetings
[1:14:04] happening and I didn't share with
[1:14:06] anybody I just kind of took on the load
[1:14:08] and and just did it but you know I wanna
[1:14:11] I was told make sure to let the church
[1:14:14] know these things because people might
[1:14:17] want to help give and say make sure you
[1:14:20] let people know well enough in advance
[1:14:21] right so I say okay we'll do that
[1:14:24] you know so I'm starting to announce it
[1:14:26] and just let everybody know and if you
[1:14:28] want to give towards that I anticipate
[1:14:31] that our expenses for you know the me
[1:14:33] that's gonna be anywhere from five to
[1:14:34] seven thousand dollars you know this is
[1:14:36] what takes care of people flying here
[1:14:39] coming here their hotel rooms food and
[1:14:42] you know and all these things like that
[1:14:44] so you know but if you would like to
[1:14:46] contribute towards that just take one of
[1:14:48] the envelopes and just write for the
[1:14:50] meetings you know own it and we'll put
[1:14:52] it to the side strictly for the meetings
[1:14:55] but uh you know if we all kind of share
[1:14:56] it the load you got 25 people give $200
[1:14:59] you got $5,000 just like that 25 people
[1:15:03] $200 $5,000 there's all the team a man
[1:15:08] and I'm trying to catch up with folk
[1:15:10] Christmas
[1:15:16] Thanksgiving it should I know you're
[1:15:19] gonna celebrate no no what no Halloween
[1:15:21] but praise the Lord but I'm catching
[1:15:24] before they get you right a man we got a
[1:15:26] meetin coming home a man and we had a
[1:15:30] time I was that I happen to go back on a
[1:15:32] little little thread and blast our
[1:15:34] brother Simba I hear dancing like we had
[1:15:38] a meet yeah I know who I am so you know
[1:15:43] we enjoyed ourselves early this year
[1:15:45] we're looking forward to it next year
[1:15:47] and we'll be doing the banquet and
[1:15:50] everything - we'll let you know about
[1:15:52] that as well soon enough here at First
[1:15:55] Samuel 30 it says and it came to pass
[1:15:58] when David and his man would come to
[1:16:03] Ziklag on the third day that the
[1:16:07] Amalekites said it had invaded the south
[1:16:10] and Ziklag and smitten Ziklag and burned
[1:16:12] it with fire and had taken the women
[1:16:15] captors that were there in when they
[1:16:18] slew not any so sometimes we need to
[1:16:21] even though you're going through a great
[1:16:22] trial it could have been worse than what
[1:16:25] it was so we got to learn to thank God
[1:16:29] for for where we act a look at your
[1:16:33] neighbor say it could have been worse it
[1:16:40] could have been much worse so you need
[1:16:43] to just thank God for what you got you
[1:16:46] understand they say a man had taken the
[1:16:49] women captors that were there in they
[1:16:51] slew not any I had the great or small
[1:16:55] but carried them away and went on their
[1:16:57] way so David and his men came to the
[1:17:00] city and behold it was burned with fire
[1:17:03] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:17:07] daughters were taken captive then David
[1:17:11] and the people that were with him lifted
[1:17:13] up their voice of weapon till they had
[1:17:15] no more power to weep then asked them
[1:17:18] crying
[1:17:19] that's some serious crying I mean I
[1:17:22] ain't mean got stripped to crime no more
[1:17:25] and this is a whole group of them and
[1:17:28] we're gonna read a little bit later on
[1:17:29] it's 600 men crying like this 600 can
[1:17:33] you imagine that
[1:17:34] being a rock men amongst six under
[1:17:36] crying man that would be some sight to
[1:17:43] see but not a cry for a reason right
[1:17:46] there all their families are gone
[1:17:48] why is going children go and have no
[1:17:51] idea where they are
[1:17:52] no whatsoever right so here you know
[1:17:56] said David Davis two wives were taken
[1:18:01] captive ahead of him the Jezreel itis
[1:18:05] and Abigail the wife of Nepal the
[1:18:07] carmelite when David was greatly
[1:18:10] distressed for the people speak of
[1:18:14] stoning him I think that's something now
[1:18:18] when things going good we went to David
[1:18:21] we got your back we got you covered but
[1:18:25] as soon as the tide turns man we gonna
[1:18:27] kill you I mean it just that's the way
[1:18:35] that's the way human nature is soon as
[1:18:36] something go wrong I'm coming against
[1:18:38] him right don't don't don't don't don't
[1:18:40] don't be like that don't be like that
[1:18:43] says David was greatly distressed about
[1:18:45] a man already lost his wives and
[1:18:48] everything that he that you know that
[1:18:49] that that was taken captive David lost
[1:18:52] all that now he losing the men that are
[1:18:54] there with him he losing their
[1:18:55] confidence right and he says David David
[1:18:58] was greatly distressed for the people
[1:18:59] speak of stolen him because the soul of
[1:19:03] all the people was grieved every man for
[1:19:07] his sons and for his daughters now I
[1:19:09] want you to I want you to see David in
[1:19:12] this distressful situation had nobody
[1:19:15] else to turn to but God he couldn't get
[1:19:20] instant he could get encouragement from
[1:19:22] his best friends he couldn't get
[1:19:23] encouragement from relatives amen the
[1:19:27] day was even taught by stone in the
[1:19:28] morning all right but but here the Bible
[1:19:31] says but
[1:19:33] encouraged himself
[1:19:35] oh come on somebody I love this one

[1:20:36] something nothing past I was waiting on
[1:20:45] a call least you can text me Pastor
[1:20:51] David encouraged that that means you

[1:21:47] elect survive pray the bringing me
[1:21:50] hither the ephod and a be atha brought
[1:21:52] theater the II Father David now you know

[1:22:12] another leader right 600 million coming
[1:22:15] against him and he has to encourage
[1:22:16] himself and when David gets into dire
[1:22:19] straits watch what the Bible says that
[1:22:21] he does Bible says and David inquired at
[1:22:26] the Lord that mean he start praying
[1:22:27] about it this is how we fight our
[1:22:32] battles right I mean and sometimes that
[1:22:35] seem like that's like oh that's just the
[1:22:38] the canned response pray about it but if
[1:22:41] you read scripture this is how people
[1:22:42] came through things prayer is the most
[1:22:45] powerful weapon you got and let me tell
[1:22:47] you something when you're praying
[1:22:48] prayers not necessarily change the
[1:22:50] person that you're praying about prayers
[1:22:52] have changed you alright god help me
[1:22:58] David inquired at the Lord Stamp shall I
[1:23:00] pursue after this troop shall not
[1:23:02] overtake them and he answered him pursue
[1:23:04] for thou shalt surely overtake them and
[1:23:07] and will and and without fail recover oh

[1:24:18] she wouldn't be here today because of
[1:24:21] some things that come up Laura she just

[1:24:31] circumstance be with her got through the
[1:24:33] midst of it meet every meet that she
[1:24:35] would have what God is our prayers in
[1:24:36] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[1:24:39] you you can be seated
[1:24:47] a man my god so war strategies brotherly
[1:24:53] kindness a man let me just start by
[1:24:56] reading a little something here in the
[1:24:58] message living dying buried rising
[1:25:01] coming just something here that the
[1:25:03] Prophet says says and when he lived he
[1:25:07] loved because he was God and God is love
[1:25:10] and there can never be anyone who could
[1:25:14] love like Jesus loved a man from the
[1:25:17] very first time his little baby hand
[1:25:20] stroked those pretty cheeks of his
[1:25:23] beautiful mother he was loved from from
[1:25:26] that till he forgive his last enemy on
[1:25:29] the cross he was God's expression of
[1:25:33] love no one can love like Jesus God
[1:25:36] being manifested in a little tiny baby
[1:25:39] come in order to take away the sins of
[1:25:42] the world and when you just speak of the
[1:25:45] word Jesus something there's something
[1:25:49] about it means love that's what the
[1:25:52] world needs more today is not of Jesus
[1:25:55] of some past tense some Jesus of some
[1:25:58] high ethics but a Jesus of love that can
[1:26:01] be expressed in the Church of the Lord
[1:26:03] Jesus especially as its members one to
[1:26:07] another or to always greet one another
[1:26:10] in love I love that the members of the
[1:26:14] body of Christ should always greet one
[1:26:16] another in love a man a man don't walk
[1:26:20] by your brother don't want biases to
[1:26:22] greet one another in love he says in
[1:26:25] traveling I think if there's any great
[1:26:28] thing that I've seen missing in the
[1:26:30] church today - one of the greatest
[1:26:33] hindrance in the church today that keep
[1:26:36] a revival back is the
[1:26:39] of that godly love that Christ expressed
[1:26:43] when he was here on earth
[1:26:45] listen it's easy for you and I to love
[1:26:49] somebody that loves us glory to God but
[1:26:53] Jesus didn't have that kind of love this
[1:26:55] is what he was talking about in Matthew
[1:26:56] 5 when you said be perfect as your
[1:26:59] father in heaven is perfect
[1:27:00] amen they say they say the publicans can
[1:27:03] love those that love them say that you
[1:27:05] not doing anything different than
[1:27:06] anybody else so but it said when you can
[1:27:08] love your enemy someone that
[1:27:10] despitefully uses you or does something
[1:27:14] against you when you can love them now
[1:27:16] you've accomplished something praise God
[1:27:19] it made sense Jesus didn't have that
[1:27:23] kind of love he had God's love and God
[1:27:26] loved his enemies for God so loved the
[1:27:31] world when the world was unlovable God
[1:27:34] still loved the world now we need to
[1:27:37] understand we were included in the world
[1:27:40] a man said but he loved us that he would
[1:27:44] come and die on a cross for us before we
[1:27:47] was even born a man that's love amen an
[1:27:51] inept out here even at the cross Jesus
[1:27:53] is praying for those that are crucifying
[1:27:55] father forgive them for they know not
[1:27:57] what they do we got to come to this type
[1:27:59] of love hallelujah this is what God is
[1:28:02] calling for a man here the color for out
[1:28:04] of his bride he said it's it's a
[1:28:06] different even in the expression the
[1:28:10] worse the phileo love like we have one
[1:28:12] for another
[1:28:13] but the agapo love is the is a divine
[1:28:16] love but and if there's anything that I
[1:28:19] believe that would start a revival in
[1:28:22] Los Angeles would be time that we could
[1:28:25] all break down our different barriers we
[1:28:28] heard that this weekend break down our
[1:28:30] different barriers and come together as
[1:28:32] Christians and love that's the
[1:28:34] Pentecostals the Baptist and the
[1:28:36] Presbyterians and all together we could
[1:28:38] be expressed to the world that we
[1:28:40] love one for another he goes on to say
[1:28:44] this Jesus prayed that prayer that we
[1:28:46] might love one another as he loved us
[1:28:48] and as he loved us and he loved us so
[1:28:51] much that he died for us no one could
[1:28:54] love like that unless with the natural
[1:28:57] love because it would not hold out
[1:28:58] it won't express itself it'll do as long
[1:29:01] as there's friendship connected with it
[1:29:04] see that's that's that's that's sad you
[1:29:06] know we only love as long as there's a
[1:29:08] friendship connected to it right but as
[1:29:10] soon as that friendship is broken we
[1:29:12] stop loving a man if God only loved us
[1:29:15] when we were serving him think about a
[1:29:18] man if anybody's ever backslidden it and
[1:29:20] and and I can tell you this that all of
[1:29:22] us have backslidden in some way right
[1:29:24] but if God only loved us at the time
[1:29:26] that we were serving him and when we and
[1:29:28] when we got away from doing the things
[1:29:29] that we should've did if people stopped
[1:29:31] loving us we'd be without hope right now
[1:29:33] praise God
[1:29:34] I'm glad his love does not run out a man
[1:29:38] his thought his love has no end to it
[1:29:40] glory a man say says it says I do as
[1:29:44] long as their friendship connected with
[1:29:46] it but when the friendship turns then
[1:29:49] people begin to say well he did
[1:29:50] so-and-so
[1:29:51] she did storm so they Baxley real godly
[1:29:56] love goes after the that backslider
[1:29:59] till it finds him can I say that again
[1:30:03] real godly love goes after that
[1:30:07] backslider till it finds him hey man I
[1:30:12] heard a fortune of service on Wednesday
[1:30:14] night and I heard brother Troy Axl you
[1:30:17] know this one ain't here that wouldn't
[1:30:19] hear who was going after them real godly
[1:30:21] love is gonna go wear out them till it
[1:30:23] finds them any man don't just go after
[1:30:26] the ones that you connect with go after
[1:30:30] the ones that you don't connect with we
[1:30:32] don't have that we don't have nothing to
[1:30:33] come and guess you do you got Jesus in
[1:30:36] common
[1:30:38] so talk about Jesus glory to God says he
[1:30:41] says they've actually real godly love
[1:30:43] goes out to that backslide until it
[1:30:45] finds him godly love goes him Stoops to
[1:30:48] the Lords of hell to pick up a man or
[1:30:51] woman that's fallen that's what we're
[1:30:55] lacking today we have a fine cultured
[1:30:58] church educated fine dress fine building
[1:31:00] nice choirs beautiful music some of the
[1:31:03] best the world's ever had but we're
[1:31:06] dying for some of that godly love dying
[1:31:10] for some of that godly love amen let's
[1:31:13] go on hear the message statue of a
[1:31:15] perfect man the Prophet gives us
[1:31:19] something here a man as he's bringing in
[1:31:22] brotherly kindness
[1:31:23] it just makes just a couple comments and
[1:31:26] we'll just read this and we'll go on
[1:31:28] since this he says then sickly let's at
[1:31:33] the Bible said here adding brotherly
[1:31:36] love brotherly kindness now that's a
[1:31:39] good one it says right here the six
[1:31:42] seven all right add and brotherly
[1:31:44] kindness all right when we give to that
[1:31:47] brotherly kindness he says put yourself
[1:31:51] in his place on the matter now this is
[1:31:56] real good right cuz cuz you know
[1:31:59] sometimes we when we process things
[1:32:01] we're processing it only from our
[1:32:04] perspective but but he's saying well yet
[1:32:07] when you when you're adding brotherly
[1:32:09] kindness what you do is you shift
[1:32:11] positions and you begin to put yourself
[1:32:14] in your brothers position or in your
[1:32:17] sisters position hallelujah Amen and you
[1:32:20] begin to see things the way that they
[1:32:22] see things the reason that they respond
[1:32:24] the way that they respond you can
[1:32:26] understand that because you're seeing it
[1:32:27] from their angle Oh hallelujah church
[1:32:30] right amen oftentimes before you make a
[1:32:33] decision if you were just ship
[1:32:36] since it were actually keep some of the
[1:32:39] the stew room and the fusses and the
[1:32:41] argument a man down if we could just
[1:32:43] kind of think about it from another
[1:32:45] person's perspective Oh hallelujah
[1:32:48] church
[1:32:49] glory to God he said he says put
[1:32:51] yourself in his place on the matter they
[1:32:55] said my brother sinned against me and
[1:32:58] Peter said shall I forgive him he said
[1:33:01] seven times a day he said seven seventy
[1:33:04] times seven see
[1:33:05] brotherly kindness now you see if a
[1:33:07] brother is all out of tune don't be
[1:33:10] impatient with him see no no see be kind
[1:33:14] to him go anyhow now you know we're
[1:33:17] gonna read this I will go back to
[1:33:19] Matthew 18 and pull this up but just you
[1:33:22] know if a brother gets out of tune
[1:33:23] because that happens in church people
[1:33:26] get out of tune sometimes the devil
[1:33:28] throw something at a person the devil
[1:33:30] throw a misunderstanding in and next
[1:33:32] thing you know a person's out of tune
[1:33:34] now-now-now i'ma tell you if you ever
[1:33:36] played an instrument that was out of
[1:33:38] tune it don't sound good it mess up
[1:33:41] everything else right if you don't get
[1:33:43] it into I mean it's gonna cost a single
[1:33:45] the sing sing wrong it's gonna cost a
[1:33:48] mint I mean what other people are
[1:33:50] hearing is like oh my that's just this
[1:33:52] is a mess right so when things get out
[1:33:54] of tune to get real ugly hallelujah but
[1:33:57] when it get that way you gotta learn how
[1:33:59] to be patient what happens with an
[1:34:01] instrument is we take we take something
[1:34:03] we just begin to tune it back up now you
[1:34:05] can't play it till it get back into you
[1:34:08] can't use it till they get back in tune
[1:34:10] hallelujah
[1:34:11] but but what we're working on is trying
[1:34:13] to get it back into Oh glory to God now
[1:34:17] now the Prophet is telling us here amen
[1:34:20] if a brother's out of tune don't be
[1:34:21] impatient don't be impatient Lord and I
[1:34:25] would say number the truth I love the
[1:34:26] time enough of how God just kind of does
[1:34:29] these things and and and just just I
[1:34:32] mean I I know God is moving this that's
[1:34:36] all I know God is moving because don't
[1:34:38] don't get impatient things happen
[1:34:40] amen for a reason sometimes when it's
[1:34:42] happening it's to try you
[1:34:45] right it's just to see what's on the
[1:34:47] inside of you
[1:34:48] glory to God I know what I'm talking
[1:34:51] about
[1:34:52] amen it's a god of God God allows that
[1:34:56] thing to come to your life how you gonna
[1:34:59] respond to this how you gonna react to
[1:35:01] this amen
[1:35:03] we got we got our attention focused on
[1:35:05] on the other person but God was
[1:35:07] excellent but God is used to trying
[1:35:08] might fulfill God is using for you Oh
[1:35:12] God if we can understand that Oh
[1:35:16] hallelujah if we can just get that if we
[1:35:20] can get that concept that God this is
[1:35:22] this is this is working together for my
[1:35:24] good not for their good but for my good
[1:35:26] look at this and you know here the
[1:35:29] scripture says if you know brother
[1:35:31] Branham is quoting this in Matthew 18
[1:35:32] we're gonna read this verse 15 he's
[1:35:35] quoting the scripture and he's standing
[1:35:36] up when you when you're dealing with
[1:35:38] brotherly kindness he uses the example
[1:35:41] of Peter coming and asked him you know
[1:35:43] if my brother if my brother fitted me if
[1:35:46] he offend me how often should I forgive
[1:35:48] them you know and what we ought to get
[1:35:51] out of this is that you are going to be
[1:35:53] offended by your brothers no I don't
[1:35:57] know if we got that yet you you got to
[1:35:59] stop going around talk about I can't
[1:36:00] believe they did this oh oh you had them
[1:36:05] on such a high pedestal you had them on
[1:36:08] such a high pedestal that when they fail
[1:36:10] you now you don't know what to do I'm
[1:36:12] the problem Isis that they weren't
[1:36:14] supposed to be on that pedestal God was
[1:36:16] supposed to be there so God actually
[1:36:18] allows people to fail you so you can
[1:36:21] take your face out of people and put
[1:36:23] your faith in God hallelujah Amen listen
[1:36:29] I mean you know even if even in Jesus
[1:36:32] ministry it seemed like Jesus film
[1:36:34] history felt his congregation when
[1:36:37] Lazarus died Jesus could have went
[1:36:40] before Lazarus died and actually
[1:36:43] prevented it and not only Kaji's us to
[1:36:45] it the congregation knew that had Jesus
[1:36:49] come he would have prevented
[1:36:50] have you been here my brother would not
[1:36:54] have died they had that much confidence
[1:36:59] they said time and time again for Jesus
[1:37:02] to come Jesus delayed himself I believe
[1:37:06] for four days the latest is it's going
[1:37:09] to see proper situation and by this time
[1:37:12] the Bible say you know they said you'd
[1:37:14] say roll away the stone say Lord
[1:37:16] he's stinketh can I put it this way by
[1:37:19] the time you get it pastor this thing
[1:37:21] will be so bad it's taketh ain't nothing
[1:37:26] we can do with it by the time you get
[1:37:28] here
[1:37:30] maybe your faces are the wrong people
[1:37:32] whether you got faith in the Lord Jesus
[1:37:34] Christ he can change it and any time he
[1:37:38] walked he can resurrect any damn
[1:37:41] situation Jesus did do that but you
[1:37:47] gotta wait on oh man this car engagement
[1:37:52] like man what kind of pastors this he
[1:37:53] could have he could've did somebody but
[1:37:54] he waited all this time because he knew
[1:37:56] what he was gonna do once he got there
[1:37:59] and prayed for Lazarus called him out of
[1:38:01] the grave he knew exactly what was going
[1:38:03] to happen but but you know sometimes
[1:38:05] they may see my other people fairly
[1:38:07] that's because God wants you to have
[1:38:08] here your faith and your your trust in
[1:38:11] him alone
[1:38:12] IFS God that's gonna fix anything you're
[1:38:14] going through look at this you say if my
[1:38:18] brother offend me if my brother finish
[1:38:21] so that means you're gonna be offended
[1:38:23] by your brother and can I be honest with
[1:38:25] you then I'm gonna be the hardest trials
[1:38:27] you have when it comes from within it's
[1:38:31] the hardest trial you can have a man I
[1:38:35] mean David David made that the statement
[1:38:37] he says you know if it was my enemy that
[1:38:40] did this oh I could have borne that he
[1:38:43] said but you my brother
[1:38:45] you did this something that hurt that
[1:38:49] hurt
[1:38:50] I've never expected that that come from
[1:38:52] you how hallelujah but when it happens
[1:38:57] you got to deal with it
[1:38:59] amen and what God is doing this accent
[1:39:01] he's actually bringing out some
[1:39:04] character it's being folded you when it
[1:39:07] does occur think it not strange to fire
[1:39:10] trials that come your direction look at
[1:39:13] this now he's he's acting the question
[1:39:15] sake should I just forgive him seven
[1:39:17] times and I mean Peter realized that my
[1:39:20] brother didn't offend me and he might do
[1:39:22] the same thing he might do the same
[1:39:25] thing over and over again but but when
[1:39:28] he does it seven times good enough right
[1:39:31] Jesus oh my god I don't know if we get
[1:39:36] that I mean I don't I went through this
[1:39:39] last week I went through this the week
[1:39:41] before how many times I gotta forgive
[1:39:44] this and see when we get to the end of
[1:39:48] this story cuz they say seventy times
[1:39:50] seven when we get to the end of that
[1:39:51] that means unlimited forgiveness you you
[1:39:53] can't count it you can't count 490 times
[1:39:57] okay what you doing like write it down
[1:40:00] and a log you know okay that was your
[1:40:09] all you doing this you killing yourself
[1:40:11] with an approach like that let go and
[1:40:14] let God
[1:40:15] oh Jesus let's read this Matthew 18 says
[1:40:21] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:40:24] against thee go and tell him his fault
[1:40:27] between thee and him alone if he shall
[1:40:30] hear thee thou hast gained thy brother
[1:40:34] but if he will not hear thee then take
[1:40:37] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:40:41] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[1:40:44] word may be established now let me let
[1:40:47] me help you understand if you are the
[1:40:50] one or two more that's going into a
[1:40:52] situation you're there just to listen
[1:40:55] y'all and get it
[1:40:58] you know just to listen it ain't your
[1:41:01] problem is their problem and it's up to
[1:41:05] them to work it out huh it's not your so
[1:41:12] you're not gonna fix it you never listen
[1:41:15] and it's just being a witness to it
[1:41:17] that's pretty much all it is and maybe
[1:41:20] there's a portion of it where you might
[1:41:23] be able to inject just a little bit
[1:41:25] hallelujah but don't try to take over
[1:41:27] the conversation it's not so
[1:41:29] conversation all right well I think no I
[1:41:34] didn't bring you here for that all right
[1:41:37] all right let me go but if he will not
[1:41:40] hear thee then take with thee one or two
[1:41:43] more that in the mouth of two or three
[1:41:45] witnesses every word may be established
[1:41:47] Oh hallelujah and if he shall neglect to
[1:41:52] hear them tell it unto the church but if
[1:41:55] we neglect to hear the church let him be
[1:41:58] unto thee as a heathen man and a
[1:42:00] publican this is a person that won't be
[1:42:04] corrected there'll be a heathen or a
[1:42:07] public or not dis corrected but they
[1:42:08] won't they won't stand there and you
[1:42:11] know try to sort things out as brothers
[1:42:13] and sisters should be able to sort
[1:42:14] things out a man if there's anybody
[1:42:18] should be able to slow down a brother
[1:42:19] and sister in Christ should talk about
[1:42:22] it and let it go
[1:42:23] hey man you shot you should be hugging
[1:42:26] each other by now
[1:42:29] praise the Lord you should have been out
[1:42:31] to dinner by now hey man praise God
[1:42:36] all right all right all right glory to
[1:42:39] God a man going home how about I just
[1:42:42] feel that when they get what you don't
[1:42:43] get how you gonna get rid of that what
[1:42:46] you're gonna do to get rid of that are
[1:42:48] you just gonna keep glorifying it they
[1:42:50] return me why I just feel something and
[1:42:53] then maybe it's not every time they walk
[1:42:55] by it's because you ain't got rid of
[1:42:56] what's inside of you
[1:42:58] all right all right look at it it says
[1:43:03] there less any whatsoever you bind on
[1:43:06] earth shall be bound in heaven whatever
[1:43:07] you loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:43:09] heaven it says again I've said to you
[1:43:11] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[1:43:13] as touching anything that they shall it
[1:43:16] shall be done for them of my father
[1:43:18] which is in heaven for where two or
[1:43:21] three are gathered together in my name
[1:43:22] there am in the midst of them then came
[1:43:26] Peter to him that said Lord how oft
[1:43:28] shall my brother sin against me
[1:43:31] oh I just I love Peters question because
[1:43:36] I want you to understand that your
[1:43:37] brother will sin against you your sister
[1:43:40] will sin against you he said how shall
[1:43:43] my brother sin against me and I forgive
[1:43:46] them till seven times he had his own
[1:43:49] answer Jesus blew his hands out the
[1:43:51] water Jesus saving him I say not unto
[1:43:54] thee until seven times but into seventy
[1:43:57] times seven now you know he's going on
[1:44:01] because brother countless wondered like
[1:44:03] brother Branham said one of the hardest
[1:44:04] things that he finds the greatest
[1:44:06] hindrance in the church the thing that's
[1:44:07] keeping revival back is that the godly
[1:44:10] love that we need to be able to express
[1:44:12] one to another you know as you go on and
[1:44:16] read the rest of this passage in Matthew
[1:44:17] 18 its Jesus also gives a parable about
[1:44:23] a man that you know he owed I believe
[1:44:27] was ten thousand talents or something
[1:44:30] like that he oh he oh he and let me just
[1:44:33] put it in today's terms he owed a
[1:44:35] million dollars so the King here heard
[1:44:39] him say I just don't have it and you
[1:44:41] know I can't pay my dad I just came
[1:44:43] doing I'm so sorry and and not only did
[1:44:46] the King forgive him you know the king
[1:44:50] the King action for him you don't have
[1:44:52] to pay the million dollars amen not just
[1:44:55] not just it's a the forgiveness went not
[1:44:57] just because you couldn't pay but I'm
[1:44:59] also forgiving you where you don't even
[1:45:01] have to pay a million dollars the man is
[1:45:05] released of a debt of
[1:45:06] 1 million dollars I'm striking it off my
[1:45:09] books I'm not holding it against you a
[1:45:11] million dollars it's gone just like that
[1:45:14] and the man leaves this event with the
[1:45:19] king runs into a man that owes him $10
[1:45:24] the probable cause of the pimps amen the
[1:45:27] man owes him $10 and when he runs into
[1:45:29] this man this man says you're not gonna
[1:45:32] give him my money
[1:45:32] grab him by the neck committed to the
[1:45:36] police officers say take him to jail
[1:45:39] because he can't pay me $10 and as soon
[1:45:42] as they put him in jail amen oh you know
[1:45:45] think that the King heard that this man
[1:45:47] did they say bring him back up him bring
[1:45:50] him back into my coat I like my checks
[1:45:52] but gave you 1 million dollars and you
[1:45:56] were adjusting with you were forgiving
[1:45:58] but when it was time for you to forgive
[1:46:00] somebody else
[1:46:02] you couldn't even forgive him $10 worth
[1:46:04] he said ma'am don't commit you to prison
[1:46:08] see this isn't that the key to this is
[1:46:11] that forgiveness releases the prisoner
[1:46:16] only to realize you were the prisoner so
[1:46:22] when you forgive you release yourself Oh
[1:46:26] God when you forgive you release
[1:46:30] yourself otherwise you stay bound to
[1:46:34] something for years and not even realize
[1:46:36] that it is it hurts your health it's us
[1:46:38] all I mean does a lot of other stuff to
[1:46:40] you that just not even SI you a little
[1:46:42] bit short life because you can forgive
[1:46:47] and I'm talked about when your brother
[1:46:49] does it
[1:46:53] can I go further when your spouse does
[1:46:58] it and you gotta sit in Laura Laura I
[1:47:07] forgive God god help me forgive see this
[1:47:12] is it I'm tell you something it's why we
[1:47:13] need prayer meeting that's why we need
[1:47:16] it because you got a brace of things
[1:47:17] before the lawyer I can't do this I need
[1:47:20] you praise the Lord I'm gonna tell you
[1:47:24] what God is calling for out of us is not
[1:47:27] easy these ain't easy things to do but
[1:47:30] nonetheless if we're gonna reach
[1:47:31] perfection this is what this is what it
[1:47:33] takes
[1:47:33] let's go and read the next next part of
[1:47:36] this quote out of statue of a perfect
[1:47:39] man Oh my problems that somebody said
[1:47:43] not long ago said how can you believe
[1:47:47] these things the way you do and still go
[1:47:49] to the semblance of God and the one
[1:47:51] that's all the rest then and then put
[1:47:53] seats he says all the rest in but see
[1:47:56] brotherly kindness T hoping someday see
[1:47:59] patient with him see tempering and doing
[1:48:02] with him knowledge to understand what he
[1:48:05] believes remember it's in his heart
[1:48:07] that's what it is virtue in yourself to
[1:48:11] let it go out with kindness meekness to
[1:48:14] him having faith that someday God will
[1:48:17] bring them in I love the way that the
[1:48:19] Prophet just kind of approaches this
[1:48:21] because you know brother Countess we
[1:48:22] have to be able to go after our brothers
[1:48:24] and meekness and sweetness and and all
[1:48:26] that we can't go after you know you'll
[1:48:28] never get anywhere with anybody if
[1:48:30] you're going with an argumentative
[1:48:31] spirit it's just not going all that does
[1:48:35] is bring more offenses and until you can
[1:48:37] keep your spirit down just don't say
[1:48:39] that maybe that's what God trying to get
[1:48:40] you to do
[1:48:43] maybe maybe God was allowing that to
[1:48:45] kind of temper your spirit and when you
[1:48:48] get to spiritual spot where I'm not
[1:48:49] fussing I'm not fighting I'm not arguing
[1:48:51] it's hard to argue with a dead person
[1:48:55] you understand
[1:48:56] we got a diet ourselves diet our
[1:48:58] feelings that I thought started Dinah
[1:49:00] all of that God what are you bringing
[1:49:03] out of me
[1:49:04] hallelujah church you know I've just you
[1:49:07] know some of these things as Christians
[1:49:12] we act different from the world we we we
[1:49:16] approach situations different than the
[1:49:18] way the world would approach right
[1:49:20] oftentimes we try to take you know a
[1:49:23] psychological approach and not only that
[1:49:25] we live in a world where people tell us
[1:49:26] that you know you deserve better
[1:49:29] you know you don't have to accept this
[1:49:32] this is what this is what people tell us
[1:49:34] if you're in a what we call a toxic work
[1:49:36] environment you don't have to stay here
[1:49:39] you can just quit and leave but but but
[1:49:41] where is the character of Christ being
[1:49:43] full let me ask the question where do
[1:49:46] you want it to be for what I'm trying to
[1:49:49] get you see some of us God is using our
[1:49:52] households to to develop our character
[1:49:56] others God is using our jobs to develop
[1:50:00] our character which where do you want
[1:50:02] God to choose I mean where you want him
[1:50:05] to put you in order for you to get
[1:50:06] character development
[1:50:08] hallelujah somebody you can't pick and
[1:50:13] choose your trials God and His divine
[1:50:17] wisdom gives you what he knows not what
[1:50:22] he thinks God gives you where he knows
[1:50:25] that you can handle can I tell you
[1:50:28] something right now you ain't going
[1:50:29] through nothing that surprised God when
[1:50:35] it pertains to you you ain't going
[1:50:37] through nothing they went one that got
[1:50:39] like oh they gonna be able to handle
[1:50:40] this God that there's nothing shotgun
[1:50:43] don't know you can handle it that's why
[1:50:46] I allow you to go through what we got to
[1:50:48] learn how to do start thinking god what
[1:50:51] a trial that he allows to come into our
[1:50:53] life
[1:50:53] and and and meekness and sweetness and
[1:50:56] kindness just approach the situation you
[1:50:59] have the pray body and keep going and
[1:51:03] those who that got jobs where you call
[1:51:05] it a toxic work environment they didn't
[1:51:07] use words like that years ago now that's
[1:51:09] a new word that's a new word can I tell
[1:51:12] you all something every every work
[1:51:19] environment it's toxic every one of you
[1:51:24] want to know why because all of them got
[1:51:26] unsafe people in them I go a little
[1:51:31] further
[1:51:32] I've been in church work environments
[1:51:35] and they toxic you working in a church
[1:51:39] you didn't expect this in the church but
[1:51:41] it's toxic because it got unsafe people
[1:51:43] in it praise the Lord amen
[1:51:47] don't run from your child run to it lord
[1:51:50] I thank you for it alright let me let me
[1:51:52] let me let me let me go a little further
[1:51:54] I wanna I won't be able to read all of
[1:51:56] this but this was just something that
[1:51:58] blessed my heart my let me see here
[1:52:02] this I want to just go to blasphemous
[1:52:04] names and start here this is about
[1:52:07] sister Sheppard a man sister Sheppard
[1:52:11] had a dream and she was just wondering
[1:52:14] whether she had the Holy Ghost or not
[1:52:17] and she was just so concerned about
[1:52:19] whether she had it or not and she had
[1:52:21] this dream and and completely forgot
[1:52:23] about the dream until brother Brandon
[1:52:25] beginning to preach on statute of a
[1:52:26] perfect man and as he was preaching such
[1:52:28] a perfect man the Lord brought the dream
[1:52:30] back to attention and then she took him
[1:52:32] she just began to share you know this
[1:52:34] dream with the Prophet and and and she
[1:52:36] was just wondering whether she had the
[1:52:38] Holy Ghost tonight I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:52:40] go right to paragraph 98 and blasphemous
[1:52:43] names a man I'm gonna skip around a
[1:52:46] little bit for the sake of time but I
[1:52:48] think it would be a blessing to us says
[1:52:50] now our sisters dream now she was
[1:52:54] worried whether she had the Holy Ghost
[1:52:55] or not when she laid down across the
[1:52:58] dual fold where her husband was reading
[1:53:01] a paper and she has got a little
[1:53:03] once as I have and they're always making
[1:53:06] a noise and things so so in this she
[1:53:09] fell asleep for approximately 10 minutes
[1:53:11] or 15 and she dreamed and she never
[1:53:15] could understand it or get it all
[1:53:17] together from a year ago almost until
[1:53:20] this message was taught
[1:53:22] then while I was teaching it it all come
[1:53:25] back to her as and she dreamed that she
[1:53:29] was praying she was walking the floor
[1:53:32] first before she dreamed and wringing
[1:53:35] her hands and things and thinking lord
[1:53:38] have I got the Holy Ghost can you prove
[1:53:41] to me some says because that I shouted
[1:53:44] or some said because I spoke with
[1:53:46] tongues and we believe in all that but
[1:53:49] have I really got it a man says I
[1:53:52] believe in all those things those
[1:53:53] virtues speaking in tongues and shouted
[1:53:56] in all kinds of demonstration I believe
[1:53:58] in every bit of it but if it's there
[1:54:01] without this he's talking about the
[1:54:02] character of Christ if it's there
[1:54:04] without this there is something wrong
[1:54:06] see now you see you got a shell
[1:54:08] he says if she was worried about it so
[1:54:11] she just laid down across the dual for
[1:54:12] where her husband was reading and she
[1:54:14] went to sleep and this is her dream it's
[1:54:17] a dream she was up on a mountain and in
[1:54:20] this mountain the best sense I haven't
[1:54:23] got the paper before me but I think it's
[1:54:25] like this now not not not understanding
[1:54:27] this
[1:54:28] she told brother Brandon a dream he
[1:54:30] didn't you know he didn't have have it
[1:54:31] written out but he's kind of going back
[1:54:33] from his memory and sharing the dream
[1:54:35] now there's two things I want to bring
[1:54:37] out he's doing one from his memory but
[1:54:39] another because God actually showed him
[1:54:41] the interpretation of the dream and by
[1:54:44] shown in the interpretation he said if
[1:54:46] God gonna show you the interpretation
[1:54:48] you have to see the dream first oh my
[1:54:52] god right when you when when when I
[1:54:56] wonder I can't
[1:54:58] well what would get down to it here in a
[1:54:59] second he said you say say you gotta see
[1:55:01] you gotta be able to see the dream first
[1:55:03] let me also tell you this
[1:55:04] somebody Amen if God has given somebody
[1:55:07] that gift of dreams in the church
[1:55:10] I believe me also give somebody else the
[1:55:13] gift of interpretation praise the Lord
[1:55:16] now with every dream there might not
[1:55:19] come an interpretation
[1:55:20] Amen so don't force yourself to try to
[1:55:24] make up an interpretation hallelujah but
[1:55:27] all the times when you say Amen just
[1:55:29] keep things inside the dream something
[1:55:32] pops in that interpreters mind you hear
[1:55:35] a little bit of say a script to me pop
[1:55:39] Amen you might be saying this is saying
[1:55:41] that you're not thinking but a spliff to
[1:55:43] me pop it there another scripture pop
[1:55:45] and you can start seeing how all the
[1:55:46] dots are connected God is giving the
[1:55:49] interpretation of that dream God is
[1:55:52] showing it to the person as you're
[1:55:53] telling it to them God is showing them
[1:55:55] what you're seeing
[1:55:58] that's how gifts work but see if
[1:56:00] nothing's knows no scripture comes
[1:56:02] connected nothing here connected nothing
[1:56:05] come I mean looking out now if this is
[1:56:07] God it should be connected back to the
[1:56:08] scripture come on church I said if it's
[1:56:11] God it should be connecting back to the
[1:56:13] script but you can't see I know
[1:56:14] Scripture is connecting to it something
[1:56:16] wrong somewhere sometime the devil will
[1:56:19] work with dreams too and you got to be
[1:56:21] able to kind of recognize if this God is
[1:56:23] the devil I got to be able to see the
[1:56:26] word and a person that that that that
[1:56:29] might have the gift of interpreting if
[1:56:30] you really got the gift you know you
[1:56:32] can't interpret every dream because
[1:56:35] every dream didn't come from God so
[1:56:37] ain't no system I wrote it down I got
[1:56:40] another one for you I got another one
[1:56:42] for no no no no I hate what this gonna
[1:56:44] be like how every dream didn't come from
[1:56:47] God so the dreamer got to know that too
[1:56:52] Oh God a person s gifted with dreaming
[1:56:58] will dream every night just about their
[1:57:02] dream every night that no I'm not gifted
[1:57:06] that way I sleep every night right amen
[1:57:11] it's so wait God gave me a dream because
[1:57:14] I'm like that
[1:57:15] when God gave me a dream I know
[1:57:16] something is happening Oh God
[1:57:19] I know God is moving when God give it to
[1:57:23] me like that then I'll say something to
[1:57:24] somebody like I made a statement amen
[1:57:28] I don't know if I might've told the
[1:57:30] church early I saw a certain sister
[1:57:32] walking back into the church years ago I
[1:57:35] saw it happen then when it manifests I
[1:57:37] say oh that's my dream being manifested
[1:57:41] but I didn't go tell everybody I just
[1:57:42] told my wife I told my wife and I think
[1:57:45] I told I might have told maybe one or
[1:57:47] two other people something right before
[1:57:48] happened and then when it wouldn't
[1:57:50] happen there it was manifested praise
[1:57:52] the Lord hallelujah but a real dreamer
[1:57:55] might have a dream every night because
[1:57:57] that's just how their conscience is but
[1:57:59] every dream is not of God can I tell you
[1:58:01] another thing sometimes you just gotta
[1:58:03] wait on an interpretation oh lord have
[1:58:07] mercy
[1:58:07] how long did sister Sheppard wait a year
[1:58:12] a whole year and you just weren't
[1:58:14] yourself to death god I don't know what
[1:58:17] this mean no you just wait on God he'll
[1:58:19] bring in the past here so you wanted me
[1:58:21] if it if it's gotta mean it he'll show
[1:58:24] it to you all right I'm a move on Oh
[1:58:29] Lord Jesus so he area I want to go
[1:58:33] further in this says she dreamed she was
[1:58:37] up on a mountain and in this mountain I
[1:58:39] haven't gotten to people before me I
[1:58:41] think it's it's like this she dreamed
[1:58:43] that she saw a Rock box like a framework
[1:58:47] setting right on top of this mountain
[1:58:50] man now notice her dream say she said it

[1:59:22] a rock box now I'm gonna just get ahead
[1:59:25] of myself brother branham said that Rock
[1:59:28] box a rock represented a confession
[1:59:32] represented a revelation that they would
[1:59:35] step that that we've been centered he
[1:59:36] said throughout the church changes he
[1:59:39] says this page has been there's been
[1:59:42] more require of this age than any age
[1:59:46] hallelujah Amen all they had maybe in
[1:59:49] Paul's day was faith then they come up
[1:59:52] to virtue didn't come to knowledge then
[1:59:55] they come to temperance then patience
[1:59:57] college bully comes and he says that is
[1:59:59] the virtue for our day brotherly
[2:00:03] kindness is a virtue but as we as we've
[2:00:05] come to the revelation of all these
[2:00:07] things then this requirement is for the
[2:00:10] Christians today add to your faith

[2:00:15] to your first time in your knowledge
[2:00:17] temperance patience godless brother cuts
[2:00:19] and be capped off with the love of God
[2:00:22] this is the full requirement for
[2:00:25] Christianity today she say she starts at
[2:00:30] the top of the pyramid say he just it's
[2:00:32] just a rock box it's a confession it's a
[2:00:35] revelation it's an understanding that's
[2:00:38] coming from God look at this he says
[2:00:40] haven't got the brain center I saw Rock
[2:00:44] box like a framework standing right in
[2:00:46] the top of this mountain and her husband
[2:00:49] was just behind her and if she was
[2:00:51] assumes oh and she she was a large man
[2:00:54] standing there with work clothes on
[2:00:56] sleeves rolled up building the most pure
[2:00:59] water that she ever seen and pouring
[2:01:01] into this box by the man is pouring
[2:01:05] water into the box

[2:01:11] and the rock parks would not hold the
[2:01:14] water it rolled right out of there and
[2:01:17] just boiled up all the trash and sticks
[2:01:20] and everything in there amen and bored
[2:01:22] it out and roll down the mountain and a
[2:01:26] rolled up my feet if she was just
[2:01:27] standing right in that stuff only it
[2:01:30] didn't stick to her I got to just just
[2:01:32] bear with me here for a little bit
[2:01:34] this water is the water of the word
[2:01:37] washing out all the trash in my life
[2:01:40] right and I notice now here she's
[2:01:43] standing in the midst of it and can I
[2:01:45] put it this way you standing in the
[2:01:47] midst of some some trashy situations you

[2:02:05] they may you won't carry that you won't
[2:02:08] carry that burden with you
[2:02:10] amen everywhere you go you won't carry
[2:02:12] that it won't speak to you it won't
[2:02:15] change your Christian experience
[2:02:19] hallelujah I've known a who wrote
[2:02:21] but it won't stick to you you'll still
[2:02:24] have brotherly kindness for your brother
[2:02:26] and for your sister it won't stick to
[2:02:29] you it's not supposed to stick to you if
[2:02:34] it's pure water the water of the word
[2:02:37] washing it it's not supposed to stick to
[2:02:39] you look at this he goes home says in
[2:02:43] when she acts while the Box didn't hold
[2:02:45] that the man said that is not water
[2:02:48] that's the Holy Ghost that nothing will
[2:02:51] hold it says and said then he went back
[2:02:54] he got another big bucket it was full of
[2:02:56] honey and poured the honey into the air
[2:02:59] and it said now it will hold this and
[2:03:03] she thought that the box was a rock box
[2:03:07] but was going to burst out and spill the
[2:03:10] honey but it didn't
[2:03:12] it finally stuck together
[2:03:15] and held it the honey inhale now not a
[2:03:19] burr what brother brems say the honey
[2:03:20] represent it was the brotherly kindness
[2:03:22] if you want that to stick oh yes
[2:03:25] hallelujah you want you want your
[2:03:28] brotherly kindness amen to be effective
[2:03:30] in somebody else's life amen you want
[2:03:33] that to stick you don't want the trash
[2:03:34] to stick but you want the character to
[2:03:36] stick she turned and went down the
[2:03:42] mountain going down the mountain she
[2:03:44] stopped at the bottom of the mountain
[2:03:45] look back she saw five streams of his of
[2:03:47] this pure crystal water not contaminated
[2:03:51] by the things that I that it went
[2:03:52] through still pure and clear coming
[2:03:54] swiftly then it slowed up then almost
[2:03:57] faint announced she was wondering if it
[2:03:59] would ever reach the bottom of the
[2:04:00] mountain five streams and she woke up I
[2:04:02] think that's just about that's about
[2:04:05] close to being right isn't it sister
[2:04:07] Sheppard so you know he's going on and
[2:04:09] talking about how you know they she had
[2:04:12] this dream soon she told him the dream
[2:04:14] that the interpretation came and it said
[2:04:16] just like Daniel Daniel had to tell King
[2:04:19] Nebuchadnezzar what his dream was so so
[2:04:22] a person that has the gift of
[2:04:24] interpreting a dream God will show it to
[2:04:27] them they will see exactly what you saw
[2:04:30] and be able to tell you all about it
[2:04:31] hallelujah if God don't show it to you
[2:04:34] then just wait on the Lord now he goes
[2:04:37] on and he makes some comments here I
[2:04:39] want it I just want to kind of bring a
[2:04:41] man bring this in oh I'm going down to
[2:04:44] paragraph 1 well actually I read just
[2:04:47] read a part of 114 then I'm gonna skip
[2:04:49] to 119 it says now here's the
[2:04:51] interpretation of her dream he says she
[2:04:55] was bothered about the Holy Spirit now
[2:04:58] in so much that she's seen the box on
[2:05:00] top of the mountain was the rock rock
[2:05:02] box is a rock confession now like Jesus
[2:05:07] said in Scripture he said Peter said who
[2:05:09] Jesus said who do men say
[2:05:11] I decided mantasy now look he took her
[2:05:14] Rock box and tidy right back to the
[2:05:17] scripture I hope y'all seen it
[2:05:18] amen when she said I was a rock box on
[2:05:22] top of the mountain water pouring
[2:05:24] through water of the Word of God
[2:05:26] right saysay he said but the rock box it
[2:05:29] was a confession that she was that he
[2:05:32] said say just like Jesus told Peter who
[2:05:35] do men say I am Peter said thou art the
[2:05:37] Christ Peter had a conception a rock
[2:05:40] that he was standing on a revelation of
[2:05:43] who Christ was so so sometimes God uses
[2:05:46] things in the dream to symbolize other
[2:05:49] things it's got to tie back to scripture
[2:05:53] it goes only brings us to say that's all
[2:05:56] it was it says it's a rock confession I
[2:05:59] like Jesus say the scripture said Peter
[2:06:01] who to Jesus say who does men say out of
[2:06:03] southern man once said I realize the
[2:06:05] Moses and so forth it said but who do
[2:06:07] you say I am he said thou art the Christ
[2:06:09] the Son of God so he's standing on this
[2:06:11] rock of Revelation a man of who Christ
[2:06:14] is I want to skip down to paragraph 1
[2:06:17] night 2 he's tying a man her rock box
[2:06:19] can fix portion of her dream into the
[2:06:23] confession into a revelation this is
[2:06:25] what Peter had oh man not just what
[2:06:27] Peter had but it's a revelation of stuff
[2:06:30] that the church has got to have today
[2:06:31] look at this in 1:19 he says and that's
[2:06:34] been each church age has had that rock
[2:06:37] confession owned up to this rock
[2:06:40] confession of the Laodicean hallelujah
[2:06:43] he says and now you cannot make a holy
[2:06:46] church there is no such a thing as a
[2:06:50] holy church or a holy organization the
[2:06:54] Holy Spirit can be preached in it
[2:06:56] but in there you find good and bad
[2:07:02] renegades
[2:07:04] indifference and everything I hope y'all
[2:07:07] catch that you you can hear certain
[2:07:10] things priest the Holy Ghost can be
[2:07:13] preached the message can be preached
[2:07:15] people can jump up and say Amen and were
[2:07:18] you watching them say Amen and
[2:07:20] glorifying God you think for sure they
[2:07:23] live in some kind of life and then you
[2:07:25] find that they not living the life that
[2:07:27] you thought they were sleeping it's your
[2:07:29] faith gonna be shaking at that time are
[2:07:32] you gonna keep pressing on because in
[2:07:35] the midst of this church you can have
[2:07:38] good bad Renegades indifferent and
[2:07:44] everything else who you got your eyes on
[2:07:49] I got my eyes on Christ I wanna I wanna
[2:07:54] I gotta read something say so an
[2:07:56] organization when I hold it you can't
[2:07:58] say we got it none of the rest of them
[2:08:00] have it no sir the Holy Spirit is poured
[2:08:02] out on individuals st individual now i
[2:08:03] want to slip back now till war strategy
[2:08:06] would come back amen to this in a little
[2:08:08] bit but i want to go back because as
[2:08:10] he's bringing out this that they know
[2:08:12] the the the the Holy Spirit can be
[2:08:15] preached in it but in there you find
[2:08:17] good bad and renegades as we were
[2:08:19] looking at first samuel 30 story is
[2:08:23] david was supposed to be fighting for
[2:08:26] the philistines and you know and as he
[2:08:30] was you know my this is the pre anointed
[2:08:32] king just trying to get this in your
[2:08:33] mind this is this man's the pre anointed
[2:08:35] king he is joined up with the enemy and
[2:08:38] he's on his way out to battle and
[2:08:41] and with the Philistines and Phyllis
[2:08:43] times column and I said you know what
[2:08:44] we're actually going to battle against
[2:08:46] Israel st. that's something here here
[2:08:49] David is illness he's joined forces with
[2:08:54] the philosophic assault has put him on
[2:08:56] the run and he's he's Derek joining
[2:08:58] forces with the Philistines and he's
[2:08:59] going to have to go against his own
[2:09:01] brothers now he's prepared for this war
[2:09:04] a man the Philistine leaders want to
[2:09:07] check out all the soldiers and here
[2:09:09] comes David in his six hundred men and
[2:09:12] here the Phyllis town leaders I mean
[2:09:14] they look and they say now who would
[2:09:15] this is David this is the one that saw
[2:09:17] latest thousands and and David's latest
[2:09:20] in town this is one they wrote that song
[2:09:22] about right you say so yeah that's him
[2:09:24] he said now we can't take him to battle
[2:09:26] send him back to where he come from
[2:09:28] because he might turn on us in the
[2:09:31] battle they said no we don't we can't we
[2:09:33] can't trust him take him because we're
[2:09:35] going to actually fight against his
[2:09:36] people they turned David back around and
[2:09:39] and David you know puts up this front
[2:09:42] you know he's not even David no he was
[2:09:44] happy to go back he don't even wanna he
[2:09:46] couldn't kill Saul in a case he could
[2:09:50] kill him in the inner you know in a
[2:09:51] manner in a valley he cannot touch so
[2:09:54] had he been with the Philistines have
[2:09:56] had to do this he would have problems
[2:09:58] they knew that he can not touch God's
[2:10:01] anointed but David had to put him on the
[2:10:05] front so what do we do wrong why y'all
[2:10:06] sitting us back what we got to go
[2:10:08] through this so look you know you ain't
[2:10:10] done wrong to me but the Fela style
[2:10:12] leaders just don't want you in your man
[2:10:13] so in the morning y'all please leave all
[2:10:15] right we're leaving and as they go back
[2:10:20] from Z I'm in a thick lag here they find
[2:10:22] a man that uh they they get back and you
[2:10:27] know they can't go to battle they upset
[2:10:29] that they can't go to battle and and
[2:10:31] then when they get back they find that
[2:10:33] they're their families have been taken
[2:10:34] the the camp had been raided
[2:10:38] everybody gone wives gone children gone
[2:10:42] animals go they I mean it was a very
[2:10:45] hopeless situation when they come into
[2:10:48] this and and when they get there
[2:10:51] you know David
[2:10:52] already discouraged that all of his
[2:10:54] families go I mean his wives didn't I
[2:10:57] mean on it he's already discouraged but
[2:10:59] but then the man began to cry because
[2:11:01] they lost everything
[2:11:02] and their final thing is that you know
[2:11:04] what David you've led us this far you
[2:11:07] led us into a trap
[2:11:08] amen our families are gone and and say
[2:11:10] this is the best you can do as a leader
[2:11:12] we're we think we ought to kill you 600
[2:11:15] man
[2:11:15] I'm coming against David and this is why
[2:11:17] the Bible say he had nobody else to turn
[2:11:19] to
[2:11:20] i'ma tell you you might be in a trial
[2:11:23] that you have nobody that you can turn
[2:11:25] to but you can be recessed like David
[2:11:28] encouraged yourself in the Lord do may
[2:11:31] have to read the Bible do have to listen
[2:11:34] to some tapes you may have to do
[2:11:36] something to encourage yourself
[2:11:38] I was listening I heard the prophets say
[2:11:40] this one word from the prophet one word
[2:11:44] from another service will encourage you
[2:11:46] sometimes one word from the scripture
[2:11:50] will encourage you some time but you got
[2:11:53] to learn how to encourage yourself David
[2:11:56] had nobody to lean on nobody probably
[2:12:00] say he encouraged himself and didn't
[2:12:02] then what it there but David does he see
[2:12:04] goes and he he gets the the ephod and he
[2:12:07] begins to pray and begins to seek God
[2:12:09] and and I'm gonna tell you want to come

[2:14:56] wives everybody's lost their children
[2:14:59] hallelujah I just want to say this you
[2:15:02] know sometimes God allowed you to go
[2:15:04] through a wayward child situation so you
[2:15:09] can be a little bit more sensitive just
[2:15:14] somebody else this got away with child
[2:15:17] hallelujah sometimes sometimes God let
[2:15:21] your money get tight so you're gonna be
[2:15:24] a little bit more sensitive with
[2:15:26] somebody else money get tight huh
[2:15:29] oh come on somebody sometime God allow
[2:15:32] you to go through certain things in your
[2:15:34] marriage so you can be a little bit more

[2:15:38] going through oh god no how to use our
[2:15:41] trials here everybody going through this
[2:15:45] and they get there say we can't go no
[2:15:47] further
[2:15:47] so David decides we're gonna go on the
[2:15:49] look we're gonna go on and try weak God
[2:15:51] say we're gonna recover all now what God
[2:15:53] does it's allowed David to run into a
[2:15:55] little man that had been kicked to the
[2:15:58] side right by the invading army they
[2:16:01] they the man got sick and they thought
[2:16:03] that this man weren't gonna make it so
[2:16:04] they just kind of pushed them to the
[2:16:06] side and say forget about him he'll die
[2:16:07] right there in that spot be careful who
[2:16:10] you kick to the side God know how to use
[2:16:14] what you don't kick to the side
[2:16:16] hallelujah you might be a person that's
[2:16:18] been kicked to the side but God will
[2:16:20] strengthen you and use you for his glory
[2:16:23] here here it is this pistol soldier had
[2:16:26] been kicked to the side been left to die
[2:16:27] and David they brought pigs to the man
[2:16:30] he began to eat the figs and he got
[2:16:32] strengthened and they just sent their
[2:16:34] nurse them back to health to me
[2:16:35] getting to spot where he could talk
[2:16:37] about what had just happened say you
[2:16:39] know I was a part of an army and we went
[2:16:42] down and we invaded Ziklag you did what
[2:16:46] hallelujah and then a good thing man
[2:16:49] they held their peace they they they
[2:16:52] make they kept their cool because you
[2:16:55] did what I mean maybe one who doesn't
[2:16:56] say where my wife where my children
[2:16:59] where my dancing and if you don't tell
[2:17:01] me I'm gonna take your hand off but they
[2:17:03] had to hold air - David I'm saying I'm
[2:17:06] not stay back boys he don't let us sit
[2:17:08] on a secret they went the Ziklag indeed
[2:17:10] what say we're disarmed yet say uh I
[2:17:14] said what you want to know where them
[2:17:16] people that they carried away was my
[2:17:18] people and we want to know what that
[2:17:20] army had otherwise you're gonna have to
[2:17:23] suffer for the army but sir if you
[2:17:25] promise not to kill me by taking you
[2:17:27] down into the army I'll take you with it
[2:17:29] yet here this man was used by God to
[2:17:34] take David and 400 men into the camp of
[2:17:38] the enemy they surprised hallelujah and
[2:17:42] when they say say they think they think
[2:17:44] it was a great slaughter
[2:17:46] I think only 400 million got away but
[2:17:48] all of their families their wives their
[2:17:51] children
[2:17:51] everybody was spared their animals
[2:17:53] everything was there they recovered all
[2:17:58] but where's the friendly comments coming
[2:18:00] in that because they killed all the
[2:18:01] enemy they killed on the enemy let's
[2:18:04] pick this up in script I'll show you
[2:18:06] what a brother comes comes in there what
[2:18:11] a brotherly kindness come in that list
[2:18:13] let's read verse 18 first samuel 30
[2:18:20] but David recovered all that the
[2:18:22] Amalekites that carried away and David
[2:18:24] rescued his two wives and there was
[2:18:28] nothing lacking to them neither small
[2:18:30] nor great neither sons nor daughters
[2:18:31] neither spore nor anything that they had
[2:18:34] taken to them
[2:18:36] David recovered oh I liked I liked that
[2:18:41] God don't want to just give you part of
[2:18:43] it back he wants to give it all the
[2:18:44] teeth and David took all the flocks and
[2:18:49] the herds which they drove before those
[2:18:52] other cattle and said this is David
[2:18:55] spoil and David came to the two hundred
[2:18:58] men which were so faint that they could
[2:19:01] not follow David whom they had made also
[2:19:04] to abide at the brook bezoar and they
[2:19:07] went forth to meet David and to meet the
[2:19:08] people that were with him and when David
[2:19:12] came near to the people he saluted them
[2:19:15] see how you responding to folk when they
[2:19:19] done took you through a trial
[2:19:22] this is says he says then answered all
[2:19:27] the wicked then answered all the wicked
[2:19:31] men and the men of Belial see I said
[2:19:33] it's indifferent right it's renegades as
[2:19:36] good as bad it's everything else and
[2:19:39] this in this church of 600 David had
[2:19:43] everything going to church
[2:19:44] oh my mind the men of Belial were going
[2:19:47] to church oh I hope you're a kid right
[2:19:50] now you got you gotta watch who you got
[2:19:52] y'all put your eyes on Jesus the man of
[2:19:57] Belial also in this group you know what
[2:20:02] a man of allow this is a worthless man
[2:20:05] you don't want nobody to card you you
[2:20:07] Manipal I'll that's
[2:20:09] not a good that's not a good turn all
[2:20:12] right listen

[2:20:18] Wentworth dated and say it because they
[2:20:20] went not with this not CCC he got a why
[2:20:23] - who's surrounding you it's somebody
[2:20:25] sometimes people don't come up with some
[2:20:27] evil schemes right and they got they
[2:20:30] want to suggest to you to do something
[2:20:32] evil now notice what they say say uh
[2:20:35] because they went not with us right they
[2:20:39] didn't go to the battle to recover all
[2:20:41] this since they went not with us we will
[2:20:43] not give them all of the spoil that we
[2:20:46] have recovered st. every man his wife
[2:20:48] and his children that they may leave
[2:20:50] them away in the park oh that's sad now

[2:20:54] we're just gonna give you your wives and
[2:20:56] your children we don't even want y'all
[2:20:57] hanging with us no more pretty much we
[2:21:01] want to kick y'all out the church then
[2:21:07] said David you shall not do so thank God
[2:21:10] for a godly leader ye shall not do so my
[2:21:14] brother in with that and notice what
[2:21:18] David is saying with that which the LORD
[2:21:21] hath given us I didn't do this on my own
[2:21:23] I didn't go down and recover all on my
[2:21:26] own if God had not put that man there
[2:21:29] for me to talk to and feed and him show
[2:21:31] me where the camp was I would have been
[2:21:33] lost God set this up for me to get
[2:21:36] everything back see they meant when they
[2:21:38] come in and invade it and took
[2:21:39] everything God is the one that spare my
[2:21:42] family so I'm not gonna let y'all just
[2:21:46] do them like that David says you should
[2:21:51] not do so my brother in with that which
[2:21:54] the LORD hath given us who have
[2:21:55] preserved us and delivered the company
[2:21:57] that came against us into our land for
[2:22:00] who will hearken unto you in this manner
[2:22:02] but as his part is that go down to the
[2:22:05] battle so shall his part be that tarath
[2:22:08] by the stuff they should part alike I
[2:22:11] i I just I just like this IIIi believe
[2:22:17] God is taking us into a new church I
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:24] believe that a new church a new scheme
[2:22:27] and no one nobody else I believe I
[2:22:29] believe y'all have been given from y'all
[2:22:31] heart and God gonna bless y'all giving
[2:22:35] you want to know what else I believe I
[2:22:37] believe it's gonna be people that's
[2:22:39] gonna come in to church affion gave all
[2:22:41] your money and it's gonna be some folk
[2:22:45] that's gonna be runnin around that new
[2:22:47] church that ain't gave a dollar you know
[2:22:52] what else I believe I believe you're
[2:22:53] gonna rejoice with you're not gonna be
[2:22:56] looking at them funny huh do not you not
[2:22:59] gonna meet what you ain't even gave
[2:23:00] nothing towards it
[2:23:01] you may don't think like that because
[2:23:05] you're gonna realize it's not us anyway
[2:23:07] it's Oh God
[2:23:09] [Applause]
[2:23:17] but as his part is that going down to
[2:23:19] the battle socialist Part B that tariff
[2:23:21] buy the stuff that shall part alike and
[2:23:24] it was so from that day forth that he
[2:23:26] made it a statute and ordinance for
[2:23:29] Israel to this day and when David came
[2:23:30] to Ziklag he's sent of the spoil and to
[2:23:33] the elders of Judah even to his friends
[2:23:35] saying behold a present for you
[2:23:37] of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord
[2:23:40] the brotherly kindness is what David did
[2:23:43] to his brothers that could not go to
[2:23:46] battle put yourself in the other
[2:23:48] person's position they were faint they
[2:23:51] just didn't have the strength to go and
[2:23:53] rather than say now you don't good you
[2:23:55] know we're just gonna give you back your
[2:23:57] kids and your wife and we don't want
[2:23:59] y'all to be nothing we don't want
[2:24:01] nothing to do with you no no no no no
[2:24:03] we're gonna give you kids we're gonna
[2:24:05] give you your wife and and you know what
[2:24:08] we're gonna make ya'll more than
[2:24:09] conquerors I remember brother Darrell
[2:24:17] Ward said you know Muhammad Ali
[2:24:19] Muhammad Ali's wife would be more than a
[2:24:22] conquer because you know what she what
[2:24:24] she would never step into the ring she'd
[2:24:26] never take a blow so you never get hit
[2:24:29] by nobody she never even trained didn't
[2:24:32] get up early in the morning to run do
[2:24:35] nothing but when Muhammad Ali go out
[2:24:37] there and knock a fella I you know what
[2:24:40] she enjoys the rewards of his victory
[2:24:42] she live in the house that he buys with
[2:24:44] the money she drives a Carter he buys
[2:24:46] with him and it makes her more than a
[2:24:48] conqueror and y'all didn't go to battle
[2:24:54] boys but y'all gonna get spoiled you
[2:24:57] gonna get to enjoy the things that we
[2:24:59] enjoy and we had the fight for it but
[2:25:02] because you're one of us because you our
[2:25:05] brother
[2:25:09] and I just wonder if you can use a
[2:25:12] strategy like that in order to overcome
[2:25:16] in some situations that you might be
[2:25:18] going through you put nothing in but
[2:25:24] you're gonna get everything out can you
[2:25:31] use that strategy for a brother for
[2:25:35] sister you know Jesus did when he went
[2:25:39] to the cross what did we put in I tell
[2:25:43] you what we put in I was seeing that's
[2:25:46] what we put in but yet we got everything
[2:25:48] out of the sacrifice of him going to the
[2:25:51] cross that's that's brother Candace
[2:25:57] that's brotherly kindness that's what
[2:26:00] he's calling us to I want to finish
[2:26:02] reading just a quota too I forgot to
[2:26:05] bring my my clock up here to tell me how
[2:26:08] long I've been preaching
[2:26:09] so y'all forgive me a manís you know and
[2:26:12] back and brothers brother branham's dead
[2:26:14] man used to put a little white mint in
[2:26:16] his mouth and one time the man forgot to
[2:26:19] put a Minion's now if you put a button
[2:26:20] and it never dissolved so he just kept
[2:26:24] preaching but y'all just bear with me
[2:26:29] here I just I just let me just drop a
[2:26:31] couple things in I want to go back to
[2:26:34] the quote about a statue of a perfect
[2:26:36] man
[2:26:36] I'm sorry blasphemous names I kind of
[2:26:39] cut off right in the middle of a quote
[2:26:40] and I just want to finish that up and
[2:26:42] then now I'll bring that to a close and
[2:26:44] then I just want to read one other thing
[2:26:45] for you
[2:26:46] says so therefore let me go back to is
[2:26:51] that the Holy Spirit can be preached in
[2:26:52] it but in there you find good and bad
[2:26:54] renegades
[2:26:56] indifferent and everything I'm in
[2:26:57] paragraph 120 Rena gates in different
[2:27:01] everything else so an organization will
[2:27:04] not hold you can't say we got it and
[2:27:06] none of the rest of them have it no sir
[2:27:08] the Holy Spirit is poured out on
[2:27:09] individuals it's the individual
[2:27:11] paragraph 1:21 so therefore the rock
[2:27:13] this latter-day Pentecostal church which
[2:27:16] has received the Holy Spirit they did at
[2:27:19] the first all down through the
[2:27:21] just they received the Holy Spirit but
[2:27:23] not see not in the measure that they
[2:27:26] have it now so what what what's required
[2:27:28] of us is much more than what was
[2:27:31] required in where much has been given
[2:27:33] much has been required we have more
[2:27:36] revelation than anybody else so God has
[2:27:38] required more life out of us right a man
[2:27:41] back in Luther's that he can still smoke
[2:27:42] pipes and be Christians not today you
[2:27:47] can't call yourself a Christian you
[2:27:48] smoking and drink and you can't call
[2:27:49] yourself a Christian you should even
[2:27:51] take communion if you're doing that amen
[2:27:54] it can't be it I'm a lord I'm a fifth
[2:27:56] actually to forgive me on Sunday morning
[2:27:58] but then I'm gonna go back on Monday and
[2:28:00] do the same thing God sees that amen
[2:28:05] listen he says not in a measure that
[2:28:09] they have it now because it's a
[2:28:11] restoration of the first as we take the
[2:28:13] candlesticks Alpha Omega how they lit
[2:28:16] the first candle it went high in high
[2:28:18] and got dimmer and dimmer then come back
[2:28:20] again see first and last and so forth
[2:28:23] and it goes on this it says now but in
[2:28:26] this church age the message is being
[2:28:29] poured into the church all these war
[2:28:32] strategies God given us different ways
[2:28:34] to overcome the enemy these you know
[2:28:36] this is the message be important to the
[2:28:37] church it's the washing of the water of
[2:28:40] the words
[2:28:41] amen the message be important to the
[2:28:43] church but the church body itself all
[2:28:45] together say this Tabernacle will say
[2:28:47] this that's where she comes to church
[2:28:49] this Tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost
[2:28:54] tabernacle
[2:28:55] there is no such a thing individuals
[2:28:59] that come into this church is Holy Ghost
[2:29:03] Tabernacles
[2:29:04] they are Tabernacles that contain the
[2:29:06] Holy Ghost but not the Church in the
[2:29:09] body and group therefore it runs out but
[2:29:12] that but what this man who was pouring
[2:29:15] out the water the message to the church
[2:29:17] poured the message into the church but
[2:29:20] what was the water doing what was the
[2:29:22] message doing it was boiling out all the
[2:29:25] trash that was in it see it won't stick
[2:29:27] to you you might be standing in it but
[2:29:29] it won't stick to you it won't stick to
[2:29:32] you it's just getting getting out of
[2:29:33] your life
[2:29:33] boiling out of the trash that was in it
[2:29:36] that's what the Holy Spirit does boys it
[2:29:39] up now now the honey represented
[2:29:42] probably love brotherly kindness which
[2:29:45] is this age I've just got through
[2:29:49] telling see brotherly kindness the age
[2:29:51] that we live in now now I got a I got a
[2:29:54] skip okay I think that's it Oh hold on
[2:29:59] let me see here let me see yeah I got to
[2:30:01] keep reading I got to keep reading says
[2:30:02] now you might say look I sure don't like
[2:30:05] brother Neville seeing it just like I
[2:30:07] just read this story they didn't like
[2:30:09] them fellows for not going all the way
[2:30:11] in the battle with them they didn't like
[2:30:13] say I sure don't like brother Neville oh
[2:30:15] I sure don't like brother Jones
[2:30:17] I don't like brother so-and-so and
[2:30:19] something like that but just let
[2:30:21] something happen to him brother your
[2:30:24] heart is broke it just nearly killed you
[2:30:27] see we can obtain brotherly kindness and
[2:30:30] feelings for one another but to see but
[2:30:33] to maintain and a group of people why do
[2:30:38] you care about why do you care for that
[2:30:40] brother because you broke bread with him
[2:30:42] here at the altar as you will tonight
[2:30:46] you fellowship with him you shook his
[2:30:48] hand you worship with him he's your
[2:30:50] brother and he might do something in the
[2:30:52] flesh that you would disagree with but
[2:30:54] because you kind of stay but which you
[2:30:57] aren't to do but shun him a little see
[2:30:59] when he does something the flesh that
[2:31:00] you disagree with you just shun them we
[2:31:02] all guilty of it we all guilty of it I'm
[2:31:05] guilty of it we Shawn
[2:31:07] man that hurt you shun right but we
[2:31:09] don't want to be that way we got this
[2:31:11] got to be a live voice Oh God has got to
[2:31:15] be expressed on the AI lived on the
[2:31:17] inside and expressed on the outside
[2:31:19] listen he said he says but shun in a
[2:31:22] little but in the bottom of your heart
[2:31:24] if something happened to that brother
[2:31:26] it would just merely kill you or that
[2:31:28] sister I'm an old man I was once young
[2:31:31] and now I'm oh I've seen it down through
[2:31:34] the age do that here people I just won't
[2:31:37] have no more to do with them Oh God
[2:31:42] if we could all just be honest we've all
[2:31:46] got to that spot we've just been so fed
[2:31:48] up that's all we want to stay Lord ain't
[2:31:50] gonna have no more to do with them I'm
[2:31:54] gonna have nothing no more to do with it
[2:31:56] looks that just won't have no more to do
[2:31:59] with them I don't skip that okay and
[2:32:09] something happened to that man it nearly
[2:32:11] kills him he thinks oh god I let my
[2:32:13] precious brother go without making
[2:32:15] friends with him you see you see it's
[2:32:19] brotherly love it looks like it won't
[2:32:22] stick but it does stick because the
[2:32:26] honey it stinks our love will run out
[2:32:33] our emotions our feelings will run out
[2:32:36] but when we can get God's love into
[2:32:37] involved in a situation it's eternal
[2:32:43] brother branham was making a point here
[2:32:46] and I want to I want to read this a man
[2:32:49] this is my last quote the way to have
[2:32:52] fellowship I just felt this morning that
[2:32:55] I mean it to just kind of take time and
[2:32:56] just really read some of these things
[2:32:58] because I think it really just kind of
[2:32:59] set us free you know even when I think
[2:33:03] about the prophets ministry things that
[2:33:05] he preached Church challenged
[2:33:06] Christianity things that he did
[2:33:10] challenged christiana when he went to a
[2:33:12] man across to the border there and a man
[2:33:15] and he had those pecans in his trunk and
[2:33:17] drove for hours
[2:33:20] middle of the night to get to a hotel
[2:33:22] and as he crossed the border they say
[2:33:24] you got any pecans no I don't have any
[2:33:26] pecans then no got all the way to his
[2:33:29] hotel unpacking all of his luggage got
[2:33:33] to the bottom of the luggage and saw
[2:33:35] they were pecans in his trunk not out of
[2:33:36] all the things and out of all the times
[2:33:41] God's showing the Prophet showing
[2:33:44] people's addresses tell them where where
[2:33:47] they live what their names were all
[2:33:50] these things that God would show his
[2:33:52] prophet but he won't show him pecans get
[2:33:58] all the way to the hotel unpack the car
[2:34:01] pecans down he said I told that man I
[2:34:03] didn't have no pecans told his son get
[2:34:06] back in the car we got to go back to the
[2:34:08] border driver I was back to the border
[2:34:11] apologize to the man I tell you I didn't
[2:34:13] have no pecans I got pecans back from
[2:34:16] the border back to the hotel again
[2:34:18] ours that's a challenge to Christianity
[2:34:21] my Christianity I'm an honest that's a
[2:34:26] challenge to my Christianity I'm
[2:34:28] thinking to myself we'll deal with that
[2:34:30] in the morning
[2:34:33] and someone said we ain't gonna deal
[2:34:35] with it but but the Prophet brought
[2:34:39] things that really raise our level
[2:34:41] appreciated to to a place that God is
[2:34:44] expecting us to come to the canvas is
[2:34:48] not something that we just kind of toss
[2:34:50] out the winner and notice where to say
[2:34:51] brotherly kindness just come be have to
[2:34:53] be done
[2:34:55] those that's closest to you the example
[2:34:58] I gave me one what David did with the
[2:34:59] enemy is what David did with his
[2:35:02] brothers after war had been followed
[2:35:08] listen to this last quote the way to
[2:35:13] have fellowship no that's not the right
[2:35:17] cool hold on that's not the right one
[2:35:22] the the Great Commission the Great
[2:35:24] Commission this is where I want to be
[2:35:27] just listen to this from the Prophet
[2:35:29] says may I drop this little thing to
[2:35:32] your brother as I know your different
[2:35:35] denominations I think I've never talked
[2:35:37] like this to a group of people but in
[2:35:39] this locality here and throughout the
[2:35:41] nation it's becoming now if the devil
[2:35:43] can keep us separated he's got a shot
[2:35:47] shooting at one another
[2:35:49] he's got an open target anywhere he
[2:35:51] wants to shoot and what's the use of
[2:35:53] shooting we're shooting one another see
[2:35:55] see so he can just he can just sit back
[2:35:59] and relax I mean the devil not even
[2:36:00] fighting you you fighting each other and
[2:36:03] they're like yeah get him yeah yeah that
[2:36:07] was good yeah we fight each other on
[2:36:12] social media we send different posts and
[2:36:15] who you're talking to you Turner but
[2:36:17] they they know it's fun because they
[2:36:19] send something back and let me also say
[2:36:22] this I saw some folk final social media
[2:36:32] and then I see preachers fight in the
[2:36:34] pulpit so let's say something going on a
[2:36:37] church preacher bring it to the pulpit
[2:36:39] why the church a ticket of social media
[2:36:41] don't do that that's not it that's not
[2:36:45] in
[2:36:46] amen amen
[2:36:49] we got to be able to love one another
[2:36:52] cover each other's if you can alright
[2:36:55] listen did you ever let me just give you
[2:37:01] if I found grace in your sight through
[2:37:04] God you take my word for this brethren
[2:37:06] if you want to be a blessing and get the
[2:37:11] blessing when a man has done you wrong
[2:37:13] and he is absolutely justly I mean he
[2:37:17] has done you wrong and you know that
[2:37:18] he's done you wrong he's done you evil
[2:37:21] look at what the prophecy don't mention
[2:37:25] that you take him to prayer before God
[2:37:28] and don't take it in a way of just a
[2:37:32] selfish and say well I'm supposed to do
[2:37:35] this but stand with your shoulder to his
[2:37:39] shoulder and stand in the presence of
[2:37:40] God amen our Father
[2:37:42] where prayer should be made in the
[2:37:44] presence of God say father here's my
[2:37:45] brother and he's just like he deserves
[2:37:48] punishment because he's done me evil and
[2:37:51] I don't see what he did it then let God
[2:37:55] know this is this is the other thing
[2:37:57] about and I think brother oh brother
[2:37:59] Layton told us when you pray sometimes
[2:38:01] you got to stop and then try to hear
[2:38:03] from God let God talk back to you
[2:38:05] you just finished talking to him now let
[2:38:07] him talk back to you just sit there
[2:38:09] quietly sitting there quietly and you're
[2:38:11] just hearing reports to God sweetly just
[2:38:12] begin to speak to you since they let God
[2:38:15] go to talking to you and you'll see
[2:38:18] maybe what that man's been through the
[2:38:21] devil has twisted him up somewhere and
[2:38:23] caused him to do that though he's
[2:38:25] absolutely wrong before you leave the
[2:38:29] throne of God you'll be feeling very
[2:38:31] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[2:38:34] you'll be sympathizing with that brother
[2:38:37] and when you get back when you get back
[2:38:39] down to earth again you'll go over to
[2:38:42] that brother and shake his hand because
[2:38:44] you know what he's been through
[2:38:46] you can't stand with the mortar in the
[2:38:49] presence of God and condemn anybody I
[2:38:50] don't believe so
[2:38:52] I don't believe no sir even if he's a
[2:38:54] rank Center and what
[2:38:55] about a brother that has made a mistake
[2:38:57] though I say he's wrong sometimes he's
[2:38:59] accused wrong when he's not wrong but if
[2:39:01] he's wrong well if you if we will take
[2:39:04] him to the throne of God standing there
[2:39:06] shoulder to shoulder with our brother
[2:39:07] knowing he's a mortal look at this
[2:39:10] powerful statement maybe his destination
[2:39:14] rests upon our attitude towards him
[2:39:23] eternity for this man rest on your
[2:39:26] attitude towards eternity for assistance
[2:39:29] rest on your attitude towards them
[2:39:33] eternity for your spouse rest on your
[2:39:36] attitude towards them when we come back
[2:39:42] from the throne of God we realize that
[2:39:43] we're very everyone guilty and we all
[2:39:45] need help one one from the other the
[2:39:48] best way to do is pray and I tell you I
[2:39:51] searched we all got things that we going
[2:39:55] through and prayers certainly the key
[2:39:57] sometimes there are certain things that
[2:39:59] you pray for privately not publicly amen
[2:40:03] praise the Lord people don't need to be
[2:40:06] in your business cuz folk do listen to
[2:40:08] your prayer that's why you just need to
[2:40:11] know how it what to pray what things are
[2:40:13] pray for publicly what things are pretty
[2:40:15] pray for privately amen you just got to
[2:40:18] learn how to pray but when you're
[2:40:19] praying for somebody maybe somebody's
[2:40:21] done you're certain when you just go you
[2:40:22] have to go to pray and when you pray let
[2:40:26] God talk to you because maybe God to
[2:40:27] show you why they did what they did and
[2:40:29] when you can put yourself in the other
[2:40:31] person's position on the matter then you
[2:40:35] can have brother kindness towards them
[2:40:37] then you can greet them and and really
[2:40:40] greet them with love hallelujah not
[2:40:44] because you know I know pastor watching
[2:40:46] me so I'm gonna make sure I greet you
[2:40:48] cuz I don't know no that ain't it let
[2:40:50] this day be real from the inside we got
[2:40:54] to be able to have brother chemist one
[2:40:55] to the other god help us is my prayer
[2:40:59] let's pray dear God we thank you Jesus
[2:41:05] for your word
[2:41:08] fit Lord as he just felt in his heart to
[2:41:12] bring to the church the message the
[2:41:14] statue of a perfect man and just going
[2:41:17] through each virtue Lord and Holy Spirit
[2:41:22] this allows us to pick that up father
[2:41:24] and just tie it back to maybe where that
[2:41:27] virtue might have been manifested in the
[2:41:28] Old Testament as a strategy of war God
[2:41:32] don't let these things just be words
[2:41:34] that kind of go in and out we got to
[2:41:38] apply this it's a great challenge great
[2:41:43] challenge to us as Christians God
[2:41:46] nevertheless will rise to the challenge
[2:41:49] you would not present these things to
[2:41:53] our ears Lord if you didn't expect for
[2:41:57] us to come to it and also know that we
[2:41:59] would come to it

[2:48:40] father God walking shoulder to shoulder
[2:48:43] hand in hand Lord in life's journey
[2:48:46] encouraging one another along the road
[2:48:50] sometimes while we do things to offend
[2:48:53] one another Lord Lord may we go to one
[2:48:57] another in the spirit of meekness Lord
[2:48:59] and always be mindful of our brother
[2:49:02] and realize that they never meant to
[2:49:04] hurt us father sometimes things just go
[2:49:08] wrong and sometimes we have bad days at
[2:49:11] sometimes Lord we getting a little pity
[2:49:14] party Satan begins to get the victory
[2:49:17] order sometimes we have to sing the
[2:49:21] songs of Zion and read your word and
[2:49:23] listen to your prophet or God sometimes
[2:49:26] we listen lower to the messages or that
[2:49:29] we've just heard our pastor preach or
[2:49:31] God and we get encouraged we come out of
[2:49:34] that battle sometimes we forget to go to
[2:49:37] our brother and sisters say I'm sorry
[2:49:39] for what I said I'm sorry for what I've
[2:49:42] done
[2:49:42] but when they come to us Lord God is
[2:49:45] already under the blood
[2:49:47] we've already forgiven them Lord but
[2:49:50] sometimes more we need to let them just
[2:49:52] repeat of what they done so that they're
[2:49:54] conscious is forever
[2:49:56] father just being here sometimes they
[2:49:58] don't know I've already forgiven love
[2:50:00] you
[2:50:01] I didn't hold it to your charge let's
[2:50:03] keep pressing about it moving forward in
[2:50:06] the Lord for the coming of the Lord is
[2:50:08] at hand there's no reason for me to hold
[2:50:10] a grudge Lord against my brother buddy

[2:50:16] God that the love of God may seem down
[2:50:19] he's one of our souls Lord
[2:50:22] father that you may have the preeminence
[2:50:24] isn't a small we want to be used by your

[2:50:47] reflect this love at all times may we be
[2:50:50] a blessing to one another father as we
[2:50:53] prepare to leave this place may the love
[2:50:54] of God continue to abide with us Lord

[2:51:03] children as we leave as we meditate on a
[2:51:06] things that we've heard Lord may we walk
[2:51:08] softly before you our law reflecting
[2:51:11] your love and giving your love Lord to
