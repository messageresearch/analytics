Chapter 5 just want to again greet the church and just so happy to be here I just trust everybody managed well through the storm and we know that there's a great God that we serve and um you know I anticipate that we're going to see more of these things amen just a week ago we had one storm that came through and a week later another storm came through you know the Bible talks about wars and pestilence and you know earthquakes in diverse places and these are just the be these are the the the signs of the end and then even as the Bible is saying that the Bible also says look up your Redemption draweth nigh right when people looking all around them trying to figure out what's going on we know the Bible says look upu going home time God's trying to make you feel uncomfortable here right trying to make you feel uncomfortable in your job make you feel uncomfortable at home uncomfortable with your bank accounts come on somebody because as long as we got something to fall back on we feel comfortable I don't know about y'all but I'm falling back on God I'm leaning on the Everlasting name amen praise the Lord I tell you you know one of the things I'm still really just kind of enjoying in my spirit is uh the night of Praise And um my wife's like you going to make a comment or two about that I'm like how could I not make a comment or two about that right it's just I'm going to bring it up cuz it was funny because she it was my first time attending a uh an event like this and I really didn't know what to expect and I don't know where my mind went so I'm thinking just a few of us going to gather in this place maybe expend it out there a little bit and my wife looked at me she's like it's in an auditorium I'm like all right well it I still didn't process that so I'm like well I guess it's not at the the location they're they're normally at so we pulled up and there was like a bunch of cars out there and my wife's like it's at an auditorium like like I still couldn't process it and we got in and I don't know I could be off of my numbers y'all could correct me but it seems like it was a couple of thousand my mind was I don't know where I got a couple hundred from but I tell you what I just you know you know how you just kind of you're you're kind of debating whether or not you should make a an event or not and you know I'm you know I'm coming up with I can't you know we got this going on and I got that going on and the devil start telling me you got everything going on but if there was not if there was if the event was not taking place I wouldn't have had anything going on then I'm like you know what I you know my wife's encouraged me like I don't know if we want to miss this I'm like you know we're going to gather the family we're going to go praise the Lord that's the best decision I could made the devil was mad too oh man that opening and from the moment the service was open it was just like I was just praise worship just want to give God praise and glory that was just fantastic absolutely wonderful and just really you know just really appreciate you all cuz I know there's a lot of work that goes into you know uh coordinating such an event as large at as large as um what we uh what we attended and I just I was just so beside myself went back to our home church and was talking about it I know some of the Saints came up came down and you know we we were just talking about it was just such a glorious and wonderful time of worship and praise I tell you what I mean if you ever want to confuse the devil stop start giving God praise and worship amen so it's just that was just a really awesome time amen Lord bless yall chapter five um just a couple of opening scripture um I appreciate the specials there's one that really caught my heart was um turn your high Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus I know it takes courage to come up for a for for a young believer just to kind of be before the the group and just to kind of sing a song but I I will tell you if it wasn't for anybody else that song was for me amen amen cuz often times when I visit a church I'm always looking for something Lord that kind of gives me some comfort that I mean your channel and when the sister got up to sing that song I said Lord that's it right there just moved me in a special way the reason why that song was so meaningful to me and has been is because I don't know if y'all remember brother Lonnie Jenkins he passed away and gone to be with the Lord but before I had accepted the Lord um he was a a fastic uh uh teacher in the word and um he visited my dad's church at that time and um and you know like a young kid I went to church and just thought it' be another service and the way he Minister just grabbed a hold of me and brother talk you know preaches that message from that time well from that time and every time he would get up to minister one of his songs that he would always sing one of his go-to songs his favorite songs was Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and then sitting back there in my in the study and just kind of collecting my thoughts and the young uh the young individual came up and sung the song I said Lord that was just for me amen you never know because I mean young people you have a purpose in God's kingdom you have a purpose in God's kingdom when Jesus had a need no one else had the ability to give Jesus what he needed except for a young little boy that had a had a fish a basket of fish that fed 5,000 people so you can't exclude yourself you get back up here and you say I have something for the Lord you might think it's just for you you might say I don't feel comfortable but it's a blessing for someone and you may not have no idea if it wasn't for anybody else it was for me and I want to thank the Lord for that I know y'all been standing so turn with me to Matthew Chapter 5 I know you're there we're going to read a couple of scriptures verse 8 thank you blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the pure in heart for they saw for they shall see God turn with me to Psalms 51 I always get nervous trying to figure out did I preach this already and that's right you know and I say all right well that's fine because I mean I have chicken last week don't mean I'm not going to have chicken this week still tastes good amen Psalm 51 verse um 10 verse uh 9 hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit Lord one more scripture reading and I'll let you have your seat Proverbs Proverbs 20 Proverbs 20 am I in the right place there Proverbs bro with me one moment yep Proverbs 20 okay verse six most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him a king that sth in the Throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes now y'all might say what let me put it to you this way when I was acting up when I was a little boy all my dad had to do was give me that look and that scattered away all evil straighten me up who can say I have made my heart clean you can't do it by yourself I am pure from my sin you can't do it by yourself amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated so I I took us to a few scriptures and y'all just bear with me there's just a couple of uh examples within the Bible that I'll just like to just uh draw your attention to so um just bear with me as we kind of build a foundation the Bible talks about blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God I believe it's everyone's desire sitting here this morning to see God can we say praise the Lord that's my desire I want to see God in order to have access to God requires that you have a clean and a pure heart of which brother bam also says that you need to have a clean hand mind that we might come into the sanctuary night after night rejoicing Ing and filled with your spirit so in order for you to receive God in order for you to see God you have to have a clean heart a pure heart Clean Hands and a pure mind and that was the uh case um in the Old Testament in the Tabernacle layout where the priest had a responsibility to go before the presence of God on behalf of the people and as the priest entered in prior to the priest going into the uh the outer Court the priests had to Adorn themselves in a way that is Meaningful in a way that's presentable as they approach God because to not be right in the presence of God meant death for the priest and so there was a lot of stock that went into making sure that you know I had the right dress attire that I was appropriately presenting myself and that you know I didn't come to present myself to God any old fashion or any old way there was some seriousness to how you presented yourself to God you had to be dressed right and then you went they went into the outer court and there were uh uh items within the outer Court such as there was a sacrifice where the priest would offer a sacrifice on behalf of the people and then before going into the holy or the holies of holies the priest uh there was a Labor uh to wash away himself so he had to wash himself he offered the sacrifice and then he had to wash himself and this was a process and once a year the the the priest would have an audience with God and go where the Shak the glory was at and that's in the holies of holies and so the priest would be dressed in a certain way in order for him to see God and it was such a serious ordeal such a serious uh event and so the priest uh made sure they had adorned themselves in the right way and at the bottom of His Garment there were pomegranates and the pomegranates made noise so that way when the priest had uh disappeared appeared out of the sight of the people cuz they watched the the people the multitudes of people watching the priests go into the outer Court uh go into the outer court and they could hear the the the the the the crackling of the of the the pomegranates and it meant that the priest was still alive and all was still well and the priests were going to the holy place and that was where you had the seven candles and all these different things and the people could still hear the noise on the inside which meant also that the priest was still alive and the biggest thing of all was that the priest had to go into the holies of holies and that's where God dwelt and the priest had to present the sacrifice to God and and represent the people and in that moment moment if God didn't receive the sacrifice because there was an art about the priest there was a uh a blemish within the priest presenting himself the priest was struck dead and when the people didn't hear any sound that meant that God didn't accept the sacrifice it also meant that God didn't accept the people and so in the absence of the priest being present in front of them the only thing that they had to rely was on the noise that heard on the other side [Music] amen that's the Book of Revelation there we just don't have time to get into it but when the priest came back out when he returned and the people saw the priest there was Jubilee in the camp there was Worship in the camp there was uh singing and shouting and praising God not only because the priest was alive but it also meant that God had accepted the sacrifice which also meant that God had accepted them am amen and so it was an important thing when the priests was to go behind the Tabernacle to meet God that he was dressed the right way now the Bible tells us this that God is a spirit and can only be seen with a pure heart you with me yes sir God is a spirit and can only be seen with a pure heart now in the flesh everyone saw Jesus but only the elect saw God right the Pharisees saw Jesus the Sadducees saw Jesus the herodians the zealots all the denominations the believer and un unbeliever they all saw Jesus no different than today everybody can look at this Bible and read if you have any common sense to read you could read the Bible you could read Genesis you could read Proverbs you could read Revelation but only a few that's called the elect can see God in the Bible only a few can see God in this ministry hallelujah amen even after his death only elected few contined to receive to continue to see God because they had a pure heart the Bible talks about a blind man named bmus and if you would turn with me to Mark chapter 10 there's a few things that I'd like to read so Mark chapter 10 the Bible talks about blind barus and brother man talks about it quite frequently but we're going to talk about that just a little bit Mark chapter 10 you know what's funny cuz I got this old Bible with Pages falling off and everything else and I don't want to make a big deal about it because people would want to get you a new Bible but I have all my notes in the Bible you know I just know where things are at because I just know where the notes are at you get a new Bible you got to reacquaint yourself like this missing page I mean this page right here it's all meaningful to me I try not to make a big deal about it I like praise the Lord I love my Bible Mark 10 verse uh 46 and there and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bas the son of Tas Sat by the highway Wayside begging no telling how long he's been there not telling how many times people have seen him and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry let me tell you something he didn't know how Jesus looked right he had no visual depiction of who Jesus was but he has heard of his ministry and now there are people that was with Jesus that take advantage of how he looked but they still couldn't recognize who Jesus was and blind barus heard him and he began to cry out because this was his moment his opportunity and say Jesus the son of David have mercy on me and many charge him that he should hold his peace ain't that the way of the devil when there is an opportunity for you to seize your blessing the devil's telling you be quiet when the when God has done good for you the devil saying you don't testify about that I don't care how big that I don't care how big the issue was or even how small the matter was if it's worth giving God praise then give God praise yes sir amen let me tell you something the other day I went out for a walk and I found $5 I thank God for it y'all y'all understand where I'm coming from cuz y'all had that happened to y'all before that man let me tell you when you come across some money on the floor and you're looking around and see who else notic it and it's as if God's talking directly to you you tell me you're not going to have a smile on your face you tell me you're not going to say hallelujah if God is able to do these little things how much more is he able to do big things you may have health problems God is able to take care of their health problem I put that $5 in my my pocket I I walk different my head was going through what can I buy with it praise the Lord and they try to hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal when the devil tries to hold you back when he tries to refrain you from giving God the glory that's even more of a reason why for you to give God the praise you may not see your blessing yet but believe in your blessing amen and Jesus listen to this the Bible says he called on to him he says Thou son of David have mercy upon me and there's no greater scripture than the scripture after this the Bible says Jesus Stood Still my goodness are your prayers that effective that you can cause God to stop dead in his track is your prayer is that committed that you say Lord I need you right here that it cause God to silence all [Applause] Heaven everybody was hollering and screaming everybody was making all this noise and Jesus was walking and blind bom says Jesus have mercy upon me and I can imagine the creator of Heaven and Earth stop amen and looked around because Mar m was looking for the sound of [Music] Jesus and the Bible says Jesus commanded him to come into him long story short his faith was so pure that while all others saw Jesus the flesh he saw God in Jesus hallelujah amen when I was studying upon that I came across this one quote and I think y'all know it but I'mma read it anyhow it's a little bit lengthy so bear with me y'all don't got any place to go right praise the Lord whenever you say something like that you put the church on the on the spot right because they're like well you know I don't want to miss a lunch special and stuff like but God be the glory God be the glory brother Ram talks about John Ryan I love that he says remember here at Fort Wayne oh John Ryan not the man with the whiskers the the other blind John Ryan I was having a meeting up there in a big Tabernacle and I'm fixing the clothes he says I'm going to pray for the sake the man was sitting in the balcony he was Catholic they brought him along the altar brought him up at the platform by his card when he come up where I was at said your name is John Ryan he says that's right you're in your a Catholic and he said that's right you used to ride in the circus let me pause there the devil made him a circus my ridicule he was part of a circus he he was put this way he shouldn't be taken seriously the devil didn't even take him seriously he said that's right said you've been blind now for 20 years or better probably seen every doctor every sight person every expert and not one person could heal him he said that's right some kind of leukemia or some brother saying this another got in the eye another got into his eyes and run him blind I said you're a beggar he said no not exactly a beggar but I do sit on the street and he says well that's right that's all right and I said do you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well he said I do I prayed for him and laid hands on on him I said Lord Jesus I rebuke the blindness now in the name of Jesus Christ let it leave him I turned around and looked and I seen him go walking away with his sight amen I said thus say the Lord hallelujah you received your sight amen amen why he said I can't see anything a prophet just prayed over him it says Lord bless you you receive your sight thus sayth the Lord that's not even the prophet speaking Saints when you hear thus sayth the lord it's God speaking that's why we believe in a prophet that's why we don't believe in no man Ministry we believe in thus sayith the Lord because when God says it it has to be it hallu he says well I can't see and brother R says that has nothing to do with it go on your road rejoicing so he went down now there was a woman in in a few minutes had a great goer hanging on her throat and while she while we was praying for her it went away can you just imagine that he's sitting up there just as blind as he could be and all a sudden he hear shots and Praises somebody just got healed he's still as blind as a bat praise the Lord and while we was praying for her it went away here John come Ryan back pushing through all the ushers and coming back again and so the man was helping me in the prayer line he started to put him off the platform he said I want to see that preacher and so they brought him up here again he said to him he said you told me I was healed brother Bram hold true to the word he says he said you are healed he says well if I was healed I could see brother man says oh no that has nothing to do with it he said well well you said I was healed and the prophet said well you said you believe me come on Saints you can't be sitting in church and saying I believe this word and then leave this place doubting God you may not see your Miracle tomorrow but you hold on to that word amen when the Hebrew children's was put in the fiery furnace they told the they told the king says we will not bow down to your God he says we they says we believe that God will Deliver Us from the fiery furnace and then they Hebrew uh children had the audacity to look at the Kings and say even if we don't get delivered we still won't bow down to your god what I'm going tell you Saints even if you don't get your healing he's still the [Applause] Healer praise the Lord hallelujah amen I said you said you believe me he says I do believe you I said then what what are you doubting about he said well if I was heal couldn't I see brother man said well you will see when God showed me a vision that you were seeing it has to happen he was a Catholic and he never been taught anything like that he said well I don't understand it what should I do I said brother man says well the only thing to do is go on your road just praising God for your eyesight whatever need you have this morning just say Lord thank you for thank you for your blessings thank you for granting me my need thank you for your promises thank you thank you for my children thank you for my health thank you for my job thank you for paying the bills thank you for watching me thank you for putting food on the table thank you for him for someplace to see Lord I thank you you may not have it but thank him you may not see it but thank him [Applause] amen and then he says where are you started pushing on wait a minute what's your name that's John Ryan that says this brother brand says brandom and then he says let me feel you he's touching him and he put his hands on him he says Mr brandom as a Catholic I'm taught to believe my priest and he said and he said I'm I've come to you for help and he told me who I was and all about my conditions what nobody knows but God I believe it to be true and I will keep on saying praise God off the platform he went just as blind as he went up and there something just as blind as he went why I couldn't hardly believe the service of the next two nights he'll get up there where I was at praise the Lord for healing me just as blind as you want to be you got to leave people alone if you see them worshiping God let them worship God if you see them shouting leave them alone you might be saying to for she got problems back home leave her alone she's praising God oh I know she got problems I know he got problems but they're trying they're believing in God that God's going to deliver [Music] [Applause] them every time the prophet would get up the last couple of nights and he's trying to preach and the man come up here says praise the Lord I want to thank God for my sight can you just imagine the critics in the audience watching this blind man just looking at like what's wrong with him people might look you sideways but you still give God the praise they might not like the way you praise God you praise Him anyhow Praise Him in the storm we know a single to about storm Praise Him in the storm Praise Him in the hurricane he's still God in the valley as much as he's God of the Mountaintop don't never let the devil rob you of your blessings every breath in your body you give praise to God [Applause] hallu brother say and he was down there hollering extra praise the Lord for healing me they laughed at him and made fun of him little boys hissed at him can you just imagine and I'm I could just only imagine this the audience just watching the congregation watching this and he's sitting up there just trying to hold himself up because he probably don't know where he's Going's say I just want to thank God for my sight I want to praise him with all my might praise the Lord thank you Jesus when you see your brother and sister rejoicing Rejoice with them you may know a little bit about them in their background don't worry about that just Rejoice with them uplift them encourage them Hallelujah now here's what gets interesting they give him a job selling paper ain't that the irony of that man can't read but he can't cuz he can't see but he's selling papers just a irony from being in the circus to being told that you're healed and still blind and now he's selling papers that he can even read they gave him job selling papers nearly a month was gone hollering praising a month come on somebody some of us would some of us would have got tired that next day I went up for prayer and the pastor told me that I should be I receed my healing here it is a week later I'm still waiting for it you keep praising God right praise God they gave him my job some papers nearly a month was gone holling praising the Lord for healing me and he was down there he hollered extra praise the Lord he me the half um the people on the streets and they said extra extra Read All About It praise the Lord for healing me extra Read All About It praise the Lord they took him and they questioned him he said I'm just as normal in my mind as I ever was because when you look at somebody like that that's blind as a bad but just praising God and say God has healed me you would think that they're crazy in their minds but he knows where he stands with God when people look at you and you're worshiping God and no matter how difficult of the situation is you might be going through trials and tribulations and people don't know anything about it or they may you still give God praise amen amen it thought he was crazy in his mind he says but I believe God praise the Lord for healing me un likee that he was holding on to the six cense skipping down brother BR says a little boy led him across the street to get a shave in a barber shop praise the and some little smart alec Barber wanted to make some fun of him so he lathered up his face right good and other Barbers and he wink his eye at them like that watch this he said God shaving him he got to shaving him got about half the side of his face had Tower laying up there you know just on the barber chair and just you know he's just probably singing the tune glory to God Victory in Jesus you know just his mind just going people calling him just he's crazy he's insane you know just leave him alone he's just in he's in the presence of God blessed are pure in heart for they shall see God Amen laying up there you know he says Papa Ryan he said yes son said I heard you go over there to see that Holy Roller when he was up there he said yes I did he said I heard that you got killed this is from an unbeliever I heard that you got healed he said yes I did pray praise the Lord for healing me he kept on to his testimony and when he did that his eyes came open in the barber chair and out of the chair he jumped with the towel around his neck the barber run to the door with the rais in his hand and down the street the old man rying just as hard as he could screaming and shouting praise the Lord he has healed me he held on to that he believed did he never was shaken off of it in his testimony followed that Miracle you might have just went and saw a doctor last week and the doctor might have given you some evil report you know you you consult a second physician and see what God says about it is that when you run it through the scripture I don't have any of these diseases that this man talk about I don't care what his charts tells me I don't care what school he went to I don't care what degrees are PL in this W I believe this spoken word you can run all the test you want you can strap me up with all the machines you want but as long as I believe this word I have none of the diseases that you're telling me I have high blood pressure you're God diabetes you're God arthritis you're gone whatever the sickness this doctors gave them fancy name it's still a devil you may have gone to school to give a devil a fancy name but in God's words it's still a demon and your education cannot take away a demon but I believe in the power of prayer I believe in a God that's more than capable amen thank you Lord I mean sometimes you go pay you go see a doctor and they'll say all these fancy words and elaborate terms and you know I'm right here looking at the doctor I'm like you know doctor tell give it to me straight how many days are we talking about two three days and then there kind of dumb it down for you it's like no you just got a cold it's like what why didn't you just say that but they work you up they work your spirit up and if you didn't get clarity you go back and I you know having a conversation with my wife like you know I only got two or three days I'm let me hug you guys and all you have is just just a common cold but they scare you with all these things those are goliaths in our day Giants men of renown they speak certain way and so now kind of that's why you you don't need to get shaken up that's why the Bible says fear not let a flock trust God he's brought you this far he's not going to leave you amen he received his sight his heart was pure every day he says I believe it for a month he held on to it I don't know what you're holding on to but you hold on to it and say Lord Jesus I receive it I lay claims on it if it's for your family lay claims on it if it's for your children you lay claims on it if it's for your job you lay claims on it let me take you to another example go with me to Genesis chapter 14 Genesis 14 we're going to take a look at Abraham for a quick moment going to look at a few characters that that saw God because they were pure in heart as you make your way to Genesis 14 let me offer a quick background Abraham separated himself from his family grabbed his wife and left and the Bible says lot also went with Abram Abram lot also went with him which evidently Abram did have a lot of trouble it started with there was Strife between Abraham's herdsman and lot's herdsman they outgrew the area that they were in and so the Bible talks about how Abraham said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray three between me and your herdsman and thy herdsman and he goes on to say because we're brothers we're brothers and the Bible also says that the whole that there were that there were um that there were unbelievers in the land so they they they were watching the The Strife between lot's herdsman and Abraham herdsman and so lot and so Abraham in his wisdom says look we don't want Let's Be Peace let's we're Brethren there's this land here you could go there and I go here or I could go there and you could go here and lot chose where he wanted to go and Abraham left it like that and peace continued and then chapter 14 the Bible talks about how it came to pass in verse one it came to pass in the days of amrel king of shanar ARA king of elisar shamer king of Elam and tile king of Nations that these were with barah Bersa shanab Adama shim right so there was war that occurred within the land that lot was in and as a result of that lot was caught up in this conflict meanwhile Abraham is just enjoying just a peace and the Bible says in verse 12 lot gets carried away into this battle and in verse 12 and they took lot a verse 12 and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom in his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told Abraham the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of memor the Amorite brother of escol and brother of Anar and these were Confederate with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive all he had to do is here I don't know where Abram was he could have been eating that he could have been eating dinner eating lunch just enjoying the tranquility and the peace that he was in and somebody comes running Abram Abram Abram we got problems Abram's like calm down what happened it's like lot got caught up there's a war that ensued over in the land over there and they took lot Abraham heard that his brother not his enemy his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants the reason why this is important because the Bible does say he armed servants he wanted to get the best of the best right he wanted to get those that had experience in battle he wanted to get those that he knew would not Retreat when the enemy coming up coming at them that's right why because his brother was too important to him Abraham did not disuss himself or with others that you know what lot made the wrong decision right that didn't matter to Abram he could have just said you know what lot is a hot-headed person he just doesn't think right and he always makes the wrong decision that wasn't Abram all right he acted in the way that we would expect a servant of God to act and he says I want to rescue my brother sometimes you may find yourself in trouble and I thank God for the trained prayer warriors who knows how to call upon God's attention not your once in a while prayer I'm talking about the ones that's constantly in the prayer closet sir brother talks about that black woman whose son was dying when she when he when he met with them you know you know y'all know the story and he went in the in the little house where she was at brother Ram gave way for her to pre to to pray and she began to pray and the prophec say you know she had been with God right amen you can just tell when someone begins to pray that they know how to talk with God Amen and so whenever you in trouble you say Lord I need help Abram gathered his trained servants not a whole lot but the trained ones and he went after and pursued after lot he didn't care about what the kings were doing that was not his business in the middle of the fight in the middle of the confusion he was looking for his elect after Abraham rescued lot the Bible says in verse 18 and MDC king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God Abram had an opportunity to see God but the only way he saw God was after he rescued his brother right amen amen amen the moment you lose your passion for another you lose the purpose of why you're walk you're walking this Christian walk do you realize this whole thing is being held up because of one elect that God's waiting for because God says I will not lose not one that the father has given unto me this whole thing is being and let me tell you things don't look over your shoulder one you better get your act together it could be you it could be you you right here waiting for the last elect that could be you you are probably the last elect God's probably waiting on you and you're right here looking at brother so and so looking at sister so and so and you're looking at their lives and you're looking at their testimony hearing their praise report and oh myy God into to this and all my they got into that but God's dealing with them God's working with them and meanwhile you're not even looking out for your own self you're looking at the stick in somebody else's eye and meanwhile you got a telephone pole in your eyes come on somebody work out your own salvation with fear and trembling don't worry about your brother and your sister you got to get your house and Order [Music] amen if you want to see God pray for one another and be sincere about it cuz there's nothing more disheartening when you say pray for me it's like I pray for you and you know sometimes you know the person and I and I get guilty I'm like well Lord I should have pray for this person if you say you're going to do it do it they came to you for a reason they need your prayers some things men cannot do requires divine intervention and God is capable of all things the Bible says I can do all things to Christ who strengthens me hallelujah hallelujah check the time oh we're doing good on time by the time we done we still might make the special turn with me to Exodus 32 let me give you a background around uh Moses these are Servants of God that have seen God yes sir y'all know the background of Moses just raised up under the household of pharaoh and then he realized what his true calling was killed an Egyptian trying to do the work before he was properly called so he had to make a run for it because his life was not in danger but his heart was always right with God and then he saw a burning bush in the distance science might try to explain why that Burning Bush couldn't was burning like that but we know that was that was just a supernatural act of God and God knows how I get your attention cuz Moses was on the run and then as he was running he saw like this little flicker of light over here and he stop God knows how to get your attention we're like fireflies sometimes you know like little little little fireflies that night that just comes they just go to the light and they get stung God knows how to get your attention and so here you go and he goes to the he goes to that burning bush and it's just burning up in flames and it's not being consumed and they hear a voice that says remove your shoes for the ground that you stand is Holy Mo Moses didn't debate that I'm sure that's the first time he heard the voice of God so he just took off his shoes immediately God was calling Moses and then Moses you know how the story goes Moses goes back and he leads the people out of uh out of Egypt and so God calls for Moses to have an audience with Moses and Moses grabbed Joshua he says he come with me um I want you at the foot of the mountain but I'm going to go talk to God now in verse 32 and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount now again these were the people that saw the miracles of god how he parted the Red Sea how he defeated Pharaoh's armies how he brought all these uh uh judgments upon the land of Egypt so they knew what God was about and they saw Moses bringing them out and Moses disappears off into a mountain and the people saw that Moses like Christ delayed his coming are we staying together the Bible says some say you know some question the promise of his coming but the Bible says the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness and so when they saw that Christ hasn't returned yet they've been preaching this message for years y'all getting quiet when they when they they believe this message since they babies now they got kids all we know is that God is coming back God is coming back I'm telling you whether I reach 70 years old or not I'm still going to preach Jesus is coming back amen I'm far too invested in this I have too many battle wounds for me to go back now true and when the people saw that Moses delayed his coming the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron the ministry of that time and said unto him make us Gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we don't know what became of the second coming of Christ that's the reason why in the building of the pyramid the stature of the perfect man the foundation was what patience amen you got to believe this word with all of your heart it's a total commitment yes sir amen you got to be totally committed to it not just contributing you got to be totally committed to it yes sir think I might have shared this it was a it was a funny thing where a chicken and a pig wanted to start a restaurant and they said well what are we going to serve the chicken thought about it and it's like I got it we're going to serve eggs and bacon and the pig's like I don't know if I like that idea the chicken says why the pig says well you would be contributing but I'm fully committed let me tell you Saints we're not here to just participate we're fully committed to this sir if the Rapture doesn't happen tomorrow you see me in church on Sunday you see me in prayer service on Wednesday night as long as God is not here yet I'm still going to praise him and the reason why I know he hasn't come is because I'm still [Music] here you got to believe that the reason why the Rapture hasn't happened is because you're still here yes sir amen amen you got to believe you're that important to God amen amen when I was weak in my faith I had to rely on other people yeah before the days of cell phones I had to manually call people when they didn't enter the phone my heart dropped especially the ones that I I viewed as the most sainted individual brother so and so when I call him up he didn't pick up the phone rung and rung and wrong I called brother so and so the phone rung and Rong and wrong no one picked up you thought the Rapture happened right didn't have cell phones back then yeah so then you thought the Rapture happen finally someone picks up and you like praise the Lord I'm so happy to hear your voice God bless you you going to be in church Sunday I'm going to be in church Sunday too you want that reassurance and you relied on other people but you've reached a maturity in your Christian walk whether you're walking straight or not I'm going to work out my salvation I believe that God is coming back specifically for me there was a minister that there he said brother B says if if God if God comes back for one person in each state he says I'm going to send my wife to Georgia one of my children to um New York the other one to Michigan cuz if he's coming back from one person for each state I want one of my family members you got to believe it I know it's a bit of exaggeration but you got to believe that that the only reason why you're still here is because God is still waking working with you and the Bible says this and so they blame it where say where's Moses where's the second coming and Aaron said unto the unto them break off the Golden Aries the ministry started to crack it started to break the people started to put pressure on the ministry Aaron should have known better but the pressure of the people they start to question things is this true or not did this really happen or not do you believe it this way or not yeah these are testing times when we talking about the pressure The Squeeze we always thought it would be from the outside no Saints this is from the inside this is directly with those that are sitting with you the Bible says there will be weeping and whing and nashing of teeth unbelievers know where they're going there's no weeping and whing and nashing of teeth they know where they're going but those that have come to church day in and day out Sunday in and Sunday out and thought they were serving God that's the Weeping that's the Wailing that's the nashing of teeth because they believed in the way that they thought was the correct way the pressure is here Saints and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives your sons your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the Golden Earrings which were in their ears and they brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and listen to this and fashioned it with graving tool he fashioned it he took the earrings and he molded this Graven image and fashioned it with a Graven too after he had made it a molten calf and said these be thy Gods now they could look at something and say this is your god and the people were pleased with that and when Aaron saw he built and when Aron saw it he built an altar for it he got caught up in all of this and and Aaron made Proclamation said tomorrow is the Feast of the Lord and they rose up early in the morning and offered burnt sacrifice and brought peace offering and the people sat to eat and drink and Rose up to play that's the times we're living in today Saints people don't care anymore everything's just playing around having a good time don't worry about the consequences what God what Jesus we don't believe in that let me tell you something just because you don't believe in it doesn't mean it doesn't exist praise the Lord people like well I don't believe in Black Magic it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist it exists right I don't believe in the devil well exist that I could tell by the way you're acting that he exists well that's the truth I could tell by your acting by your action that God exists just because you don't believe it and I can't scientifically prove it and I don't have the MTH to supported doesn't mean that God doesn't exist he's alive and well living in me to tell the whole world that he's the same yes today today and forever that was the that was just like it was in the days of Noah they couldn't believe I mean Noah was saying hey it's going to rain is going to water is going to fall from the sky if we need to make shelter we need to get ready their scientific equipment could not really explain how that could happen right so you know what the people did they Shrugged him off we don't believe this nonsense there's no place to preach something like that in this place and they carried on the merry way they were shouting and screaming and playing like they were there they created their own Gods and one day a drop of rain hit can you just imagine by that time Noah was already in the ark they were just maybe might have felt on a few just a handful but everybody else was shotting screaming then hey Bob did you feel that maybe it was nothing I felt this one this time I felt it they were confused they couldn't explain it cuz it didn't meet their expectation God doesn't follow the ways of the world his ways is different it he'll cause every the Bible says every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess they start feeling a little drops of rain and in the distance to see these dark clouds forming they hear loud Thunders like I've never seen this before can you just imagine their heart just sinking into their and all of a sudden they feel a little gust of wind and little rain they're like hey maybe it's not that bad where this is very un usual well let's just play this out let's see what and they were intrigued I can only just imagine because they've never seen rain before they never seen rain before cuz the Bible says there was a dud that came from the there was a dud that came from the ground that watered the Earth that's where that's how life that's how life was produced that because of the water from the Earth but water from the sky they never saw that and so when the water start to fill up the Earth and didn't recede that didn't look too good like that that that the category three category four that we went through that that's a dropping a bucket to what happened back in the day of Noah multiply that by a million around the whole earth and so much that when when Noah you know let the the the dove out to go find a place to rest its feet the Dove came back like I don't got no place to rest my feet I need to come back here there's no place that's what they were doing here this our singing and shouting and roles to play they were just ignoring God they want to believe their God the world has made a proclamation I'm going to worship my god well you have added I'm going to worship mine I believe that in this day there's an Elijah that's withstanding 400 prophets of Baal sir let them call upon their God and we will call upon Jehovah and we'll see the god that answers by fire now here's the thing God's having a conversation with Moses just I don't know what the conversation is about but I'm going to ask when I get there on the other side but God was having conversation with Moses cuz I'm I'm just I'm nosy like I want to know what they were talking about I got some questions when I get to I y'all tell y'all can't tell me you don't have questions I got questions when I get over there so I was like Moses what you guys talk about while you guys up there and so while God was talking with Moses God was observing what was happening down in the valley and the Bible says and the Lord said unto Moses get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves go down there Moses your people now follow the language of the Bible because it was God's action bringing the people out these were God's people and God turns around says Moses your people cuz God was hot that's what the Bible says he was hot your people have corrupted themselves meanwhile the hollering screaming pray you know doing praising the Lord God and stuff like that not thinking that God can see this he's seeing everything develop they have turned aside quickly that's what the Bible says out of the way which I commanded them they have turned aside quickly let me tell you you could be sitting in church right now all inspired of God no sooner when you walk through those double doors you're challenged by the devil don't be turned aside quickly amen you carry that same anointing that you receive here in service to your work tomorrow morning amen amen you anoint your office you anoint your place cuz where the souls of your feet touch it is blessed yes sir everybody's worrying about their jobs not me I'm trusting God Amen everybody's worried about how they're going to feed God feeds me every time amen you said Brother G I got some important things coming up in the in in the great scheme of things when you look at God your things aren't that big but it's important to God cuz my little daughter as young as she is she's asking me for what time it is I'm like well you got to be someplace but apparently it's important to her to know the time Daddy what time is it I'm like what it's 2 o'clock she don't have to be nowhere but I want to satisfy that God knows your need God I have a need I got you amen amen cause Jesus to stand still cause God to be still offer your prayer don't let the devil hold your prayer back amen amen they have made themselves a Molen calf they have worshiped it they have sacrificed unto it these be thy gods of Israel God is repeating everything to Moses that was said down in the valley God was with Moses and in the valley listening to them and the Lord said un to Moses I have seen this people and they behold it is a stiff neck people and therefore let me alone that my wrath May Wax Hot against them and that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation God was going to wipe the entire people that was your fate when you were born you were subject to judgment there was a Death Wish over you but had it not been for the blood of Jesus Christ that when he died on Calvary 2,000 years ago and he wor he said the word it is finished that word traveled through 2,000 years and into your life sir amen I'm wrapping it up bear with me and now listen to this Moses in his wisdom he besought the Lord his God and say Lord why does thy wrath Wax Hot against your people that was that was a good move when I when I see Moses I like Moses that was a good one that was a good one why are you hot against your people which you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand God this is all you the Bible says he that has God started a good work and you will finish it yes sir thank you Jesus Hallelujah you might look in the mirror every morning say man I'm just a messed up product you keep at it you say Lord you started a work in me you will finish it amen and Moses say remember Abraham Isaac and Israel your servants to whom you swore by your own self he was just he was just letting God know he like I don't know what to tell you God but this is your word right this is your word I believe your word now now the doctor told me I got this disease but you [Music] said I am healed now now my God tells me that you know I'm not going to make a name come they're going to give me downsides they're going to do but you said that you would never leave me nor forsake me now God I know my children's out there running a mic and I'm just you know but you said you given them every one of them to me there's nothing wrong about reminding God saying God you said don't be timid Hallelujah don't be timid Esther was the only one out the entire Kingdom them she approached her her King and when she went to the door the King was delighted like oh that's eser he was he was delighted and he pulled out the sepra and Esra came forward just as confident as she want to be cuz she knows she has his heart and the King says tell me what you need if it's half the kingdom you can have it you're my wife what do you want that's how God is with you you got to walk Before the Throne of God boldly say God I have a need and God is obligated to meet that need sir hallu don't let the devil make you timid you weren't timid out there in the world you shouted you screamed you hollered but now that you're on that side of Glory now that you're on the right side with God you speak to God that's the reason God told to Moses why cry [Applause] speak don't get me wrong every one of us have a purpose and I I call my pastor sometimes say Lord Pastor you know remember me in prayer but sometimes you don't need your pastor sometimes you don't need your Deacon sometimes you just got to speak for yourself don't get me wrong that Ministry is important it's a needed but when you're standing by yourself the Bible says having done all to stand stand Hallelujah and in verse 14 after Moses did his tactics the Lord Lord repented of the evil God just kind Cal he's like all right all right all right you're right you're right I see where he coming from with that and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people and Moses probably like that was a close one that I had to stay quick but here's the thing God s now remember now catch this now God's anger was waack hot he was he was getting ready to tear the people just consume them all because he saw what was happening Moses was with God he like can't be that bad but let me just reminder some things and he calm he calm got go got down and Moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables and feeling really good about what he just did he like well I just spare the people and on the one side read on both sides and and the tables were the were the work of God and when J then he came down and said hey Joshua how you doing Joshua like man sounds like there's war down there that's what Joshua said sounds like there's war and mo was like nah no it's just people acting up you know I had to stand on their behalf you know God was getting ready he killed him and so I had to say something about that so but praise be to God like that's what he did he's like he had to rehearse the whole thing back to Joshua he's like yeah God was going to kill them but you know you and not we would have been spared but I talked to God so we're good now so then he goes down and it came to pass as soon and it came to pass yeah as soon as he came into the camp follow this he saw the calf which God has saw and the dancing which God has seen yeah and Moses anger waack hot he's like this is why God wanted to kill y'all he saw for himself he's like oh it made sense now but so he t god down and then he realized what just happened he's like unbelievable his anger whacks hot and he cast the tables out out of his hands and break them beneath the mount and look at the look to the took the calf which they had made and burnt it with fire and grounded into powder ground it into powder I don't know what technology he had but he had the ability to take that Cal that was it must have been a massive Cal but he took that Cal and he grounded until it was just nothing but powder you got to take when the devil got you on the throat you got to wrestle with the devil put the devil back on your feet and then grind your feet grind the devil into powder you don't belong in my house you don't belong in my family you don't belong in this church devil you don't belong in my job you got to grind the devil kick him just kick the dirt out just let just let the dust fly right when we live in North Carolina my wife and I there was a man down the street there was a man down the street from us he saw a black snake so he killed the snake but as if that wasn't bad enough to kill the snake he took the snake like he I guess he grabbed something he took the snake put it on the street just as calm as you want to be went back into the garage just as calm as you want to be grabbed gasoline poor gasoline on the snake went back inside the house grab a lighter he dealt with that devil y'all laughing cuz y'all could relate y'all got to treat the devil the same way it's not enough just to put the devil down you got to grind the devil you got to burn him up you got to take him out you got to grind him like powder it's the devil not only that but he probably he proba he did that CU he wanted the other snakes to see what happened he could have done this very quietly but he wanted other snakes to see what happened you got to let the devil know if you got others that's going to try my family remember what I did to this [Applause] devil if you're going to try my home remember what I did did to this devil you got to fight for what God has given unto you don't be scared thank you Lord and stred upon and he stred upon water and made the children of Israel drink of it my goodness there's something to be said about that but we keep going and Moses said unto Aaron what did this people unto thee that thou brought so great a sin upon them what did they do to you you know Aaron was like before he was talking to people what y'all want give me your earrings everyone he was preaching loud give me your earrings give me your kids earrings give me everything we G to make a cal and I'm going to take my time it's going to be the be the most beautiful thing that anybody ever seen I got y'all praise the Lord we're going to do this and now he's called out and Aaron softly said let not the the anger of my Lord Wax Hot he's trying to act like Moses you know the people they always into Mischief you know how the people are most just sitting there just listening to him for they said unto me make us Gods like I have anything to do with this which shall go be first for as for as for this Moses you know I I was I I was tired of having you back the man that brought us out of the the land of Egypt we don't know what became of him even though they know that he was in the mountain and I said unto them whosoever I said unto him whosoever has gold not as if he didn't say give me your gold but if anybody got anything y'all want to give up y'all could give it to me let them break it off and so they gave it to me then I cast it now listen to the language of this then I cast it into the fire and there came out this Cal just miraculously out of nowhere I don't know where it just came from I just gathered their all their earrings and all their jewelry and I put it in the fire and this Cal just came out of nowhere Moses like I you know fashioning it and anything like that I had that was just I mean I'm just as surprised as you are too your words you you may try to say things a different way but God knows your heart God was watching this unfold your pastor may not be around but God sees you car God sees you at work God sees you at school yall getting quiet on me the Deacon may not be around but God's around the holy spirit's around he sees your every action amen imagine if we could as big as the screen is imagine if we could replay your life what happened to you this week if I say if there's any unconfessed sin come now or let's reveal it on the screen half of you if not all of you will be up here Am Lord I want to make it right right now God is light you cannot hide anything from light no sir nothing from light let me tell you when that hurricane came through we were in Gross Darkness for a while thank God for a flashlight amen because there were toys everywhere and if I hadn't seen them it would have cost me my life but nothing hides from like God is light you might say little things you might act certain way and you might disguise yourself a certain way where people can't see it but God sees it you might come to church and clap your hands sing the songs throw your hands up and do everything but God knows you you might fool me you might fool your brother your sister your Deacon the pastor but you can't fool God and you can't fool the devil come on Saints you got to be serious with God don't let the devil wake at you after he dropped you off at church and says I see in a little bit come on somebody we're in a battle with the Devil he's not here to play with you he's here to tear you up bring you down but you got to take the word of God seriously cuz your life depends on it your family's life depends on it amen I've taken up too much time I'm wrapping it up and when Moses saw that the people were naked for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the Lord's Side let him come unto me and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him they wanted to see God so they made a calf and they worshiped it that became to God that's what we're seeing today that's exactly what we're seeing uh being replayed today people want something to worship they want something to kind of uh to kind of gloat over and so they're they're this is just we're becoming a handful a few a minority that's believing God because the world they're going a different course we're living in Gross darkness and if there's ever a time for your light to shine it is now there is a clear line of different of differentiation between what we stand and what we believe and what we say Amen to versus what the world believes you're G to be tested in every way but that's just because God has confidence in you you're going to be tried in every way that's just because God believ you're going to overcome you're going to have trials and tribulation but the Bible says to him that overcometh to him that overcometh not to them but to him it's an individual Affair it's an individual Affair if you want to see God created me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me create in me my Lord a clean heart blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God God bless you Saints I know I've taken some extra time but appreciate you this [Applause] morning let's stand to our feet God dealt with the situation with Moses and the people there so much to be said but there's countless examples throughout the Bible of how God servants how they saw God whether it was Abraham we didn't get even didn't even get into Jacob that wrestled with God Jacob was getting ready to face his past he was getting ready to face Esau they didn't leave in good terms so he was afraid to meet Esau and he needed to see God he wrestled with him all night wrestled wrestled sometimes you're so Disturbed in your spirit that you can't sleep that you just need to find yourself committed to prayer wrestling with God say Lord I need something from you and when Jacob was done he never walked straight again he never walked straight again but his name changed from Shyer and all these things to Prince of God we're an elect group Saints the days are winding down I'm sure I'm not the first to make comments on this but we see how the political uh landscape is playing out we see what's happening Wars around with Russia and Ukraine we see the disturbance with Israel and the surrounding areas with Hamas Hezbollah these are all signs of the time it was the angel that says watch Russia watch Russia the King of the North it's been laying dormant for a while and now Russia flexed its muscle and says I'm going to go after Ukraine and it's caused the NAT Nations to say what are we going to do about this situation because it's a delicate situation Ukraine's not part of NATO so they can't react and that's one of the reasons why Russia is going after Ukraine to prevent them to be part of NATO because now if they are part of NATO then that allows the NATO countries to have access to Russia and Russia's like I ain't going to have that so the bear has been awakened and he's flexing his muscles in Israel from the attack with Hamas back in October 7th of last year to Iran Hezbollah Lebanon these are not just coincidental things Saints we just came out of a great pestilence Co and we're seeing history potentially on the verge of occurring with a new presidential candidate these are all signs don't be so grounded in what you're work this be studying in the scripture the Bible says look up your Redemption draweth nigh and even Catholicism they're not silent they're operating behind the scenes Saints because remember the prophet says don't worry about the bamboo curtain that was of China don't worry about the purple curtain the Iron Curtain but he says worry about the purple curtain denominations are forming a coalition around Catholicism they're saying we're not so bad we're not so different let's just give arms and arms that's the mark of the beast so much to get into but these are signs of the time the Bible says man's heart are filling them for fear that's what the Bible says men's hearts are filling them for fear I remember right before the invasion of Ukraine they were interviewing the people there they're saying we're not worried about anything and all of a sudden this happened the Bible says when they say the Bible says when they shall they say peace and safety then sudden destruction when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction God's waking us up I go back to how I first intr I first started to say in the beginning don't trust on your bank account don't trust on your job don't trust on your position your roles don't trust on your house your cars you got to be vigilant and make sure that your family is in order your life is in order because this is the great taken away of the church the Bride of Jesus Christ that day is going to happen Saints let me tell you when a when Noah went into the ark the Bible says it was nice and sunny for 7even days not a drop of rain fell so people sat there and ridiculed like what was he talking about there is nothing what was like there was nothing to worry about 7 days nothing change when the bride gets out of here Saints everything's going to go as they have been people are going to go to work politics is still going to play business is still going to play they're going to go to the ball games life is going to continue as it is and then boom a sudden [Music] awaken I I don't know how you phrase it but I was talking to a friend of mine and he was talking we were talking about nuclear power and they were talking about Mutual destruction there's a there's a term for it it's called it's mutual destruction that means I have the ability to annihilate you and you have the ability to annihilate me so we mutually agree not to get beside ourselves because it could be total Annihilation and now we're and now we're seeing where we're just tempting fate in these powerful Nations whether it's Russia China North Korea those places that hold that have nuclear Powers there's just one finger away from pressing that button but before that button is pressed every one of us is going to be out of here I have a home somewhere beyond Glory there's a land beyond the river that is called the sweet forever I don't know about you Saints this is not fantasy this is reality I'm longing for a place where certain profession doesn't exist there won't be a need for doctors over there I appreciate them for what they do here but there won't be a need for them over there there won't be a sound there will be a certain sound that don't exist over there there won't be the sounds of sirens anymore yes on my way to go grab something some lunch I have my kids with me in the way that I would normally take the route that I would normally take was blocked so I had to go around and then I saw that it was also blocked there was a Florida state troopers on one end Florida state troopers on the other end and as I got to the light I looked in the distance it was a horrific accident that just had happened I looked back to my children I say to myself Lord haste the day of your coming cuz I believe in you but there's a certain degree of fear that you have that you're constantly Waring against Lord watch over my family watch over my loved ones I believe in God you don't know what family is bound is now going to get that news you treat every moment with just such preciousness I remember and I'm closing I I don't mean to take you I remember when we lived in North Carolina I had a coworker of mine her and her husband went for a bike ride she took the day off they wanted to do something as a couple she had just bought him a motorcycle and that day they went for a bike ride that evening there were services that were happening at their Church she was telling me about it they were all excited about going to services that evening so they came back after what was a really beautiful day was a Friday and then she gets off the bike he looks at her and says those words and I remember how she says it because it really impacts you he says I'm going to go for One Last Ride those were his exact words those were also his last words he never made it to church that night he never got a chance to make it to an altar call and just stuck with me ever since that was years ago I said Lord every time there's an opportunity let me not miss it if you're tugging at my heart let me respond to it cuz the Bible says in Hebrew while did is yet called today Harden not your heart as in the day of provocation if God's speaking to to you listen to that still Small Voice you could be sitting here going through the motions of church service but never really invited him in invite him now these days are going to get darker the times are going to get more difficult but I believe that the Bible says greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world with every heads bowed and every hearts and every eyes closed heavenly father I just come before your throne of grace I always appreciate just being here
