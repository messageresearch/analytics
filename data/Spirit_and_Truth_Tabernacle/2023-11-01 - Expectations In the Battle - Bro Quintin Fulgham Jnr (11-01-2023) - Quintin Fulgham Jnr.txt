victory in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen so I'll get right away with the message um the title of the message that the Lord inspired me inspired to give me was uh is a continuation in this in this uh series that I was preaching last time so last time it was in the valley and now this is expectations in the battle so we're going to uh turn to 2 Chronicles 20 uh we're going to read verses 11- 15 um as our opening verse and just say Amen once you get there and it says behold I say how they reward us to come cast us out of thy possession which thou Hast given us to inherit Oh Our God will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know what we to do but our eyes are upon thee and all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their children then upon jezel is the the son of Zachariah the son of Bah the son of Jael the son of matiah a levite of the sons of Assaf came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehosaphat thus sa the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's the battle is not yours and it's such a beautiful uh type of what's kind of happening going on in Israel right now uh um with the battle that they're expecting because uh what the what the natural eye doesn't see is they're just possessing what's already theirs right and they don't understand that God has already given them that inheritance and they're just fulfilling their god-given rights so it's not them fighting but it's God fighting for them right it's God fighting for them so we're going to go through some quotes uh from the prophet to kind of um uh as we're going in the battles from day-to-day life to kind of see what this Christian life is all about so the first quote is going to be the angel of the Covenant oh you may be see it as well yes the first quote is the Angel of the Covenant uh 54310 paragraph 3 4 and it reads here starting from the 34th paragraph now let's break that down for a moment now the land belonged to him now God didn't say I'm going to go in there and empty up the land and put you in it he said I've give it to you now you go fight it out with them there you are God's give you healing tonight lady you every one of you he's give you the healing it's your possession so what the prophet is saying is this is something you've already possessed it's not a question of you whether you have it or not it's in your possession right he says it's all bound down with amorites and Canaanites and everything else of unbelief but go in take it over it's yours it belongs to you that's right I must fight if I should rign increase my courage Lord this is not a picnic ground this is a battlefield SE not a place where we lay back and say now Lord you just come force it right in me then I'll do it no no you don't do it that way God never did it that way he has a basis amen and we're going to read another quote from the message of deceived Church by the word 590 628 paragraph 8 and I'll go ahead and read it and it reads remember we are not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield right many people just think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that settles it forever as they are a Christian and everything is going to come easy don't never get that in your head for I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines we are Christian Soldiers and we got to be trained and brought up and know all the the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight and we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other Nation tells us when we go to war some other ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the commander-in-chief of the army of Christians amen we're constantly in a battle yes right and we're going to go to uh the message Revelation 5 uh number two paragraph 37 Lord right we want to really sink this thing down uh uh uh of this war that we're in amen and it reads now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth true just remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time because you're in a battle did you come to Christ did you come did you ask to come to Christ to go into a picnic where you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle I've been on the field for 31 years and I fought every inch of the way that's right Israel had to fight every inch of the way they Palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it am amen every inch of the way to get it and we're going to Le we're going to go to this last uh quote and the trumpet gives us uncertain sound it's paragraphs 107 through 108 this be our last quote and it reads now army war it's always been War we never join the church or come to the church to come to a picnic we must realize we are coming to a Battleground I never come for people to Pat me on the back and say brother brandom you're a wonderful person no sir I come there with a shield I don't need a shield for that I come with a helmet and the armor I come to fight fight every inch of the ground God told Joshua every place The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I give you so footsteps mean possession and God has not changed his mind about us and what our footsteps go every footstep we take is possession right and if it's a possession that means it already belong to us so get we have to get the thoughts out of our head that we're trying to get something no we already have possession of it right we just want the Holy Spirit to come and realize that possession for us so as the prophet was saying in these quotes we are constantly in a battle and that's the first thing we have to do every morning that we wake up is to realize that it's a fight going on and when when you're in the world you see all the movies and the TV shows and the reality shows and you see even people in the world they just live it seems they live a good life where you know they wake up and the sun shining and drinking coffee and just going on about their day and everything seems good and fine and I feel that the American culture and I used to argue with some of my African friends when I was younger cuz they used to talk so much bad about America and being American you know it's it kind of offended me because I was an American until I begin to realize that you know they're right about that because the Le the L this last age America is a very very big representative of that because the PE it says that the people are rich right and but but yet they're blind naked and don't know it and when I begin to think about it in America America has the highest GDP where we have an abundance of resources we have an abundance of entertainment and so it's made us comfortable to think we're not in a war right right and so I I I in in uh in history class I know I read about the Vietnam War and the soldiers there wouldn't even go to sleep sometimes because they realized they could die in their sleep so they stayed up all night every day because they were in a fight could you imagine them uh uh streaming Netflix or you know uh on social media all day right realizing that if they didn't keep guard their life would be gone and so I feel that American people we've kind of the enemy can kind of creep in and make us comfortable right make us comfortable to unarm us it's not that we don't have the weapons it's just he wants to unarm us and the weapon being the word so I went to this concert um I believe it was Sunday and this guy was talking about about this one girl this little girl there where these people were writing letters to the um these little uh kids uh and it was Christian people writing letters to these kids and these are these are people that don't have the Comforts and enjoyments of the world that we do they don't have beds they don't have you know they can't choose between a water bed and a a um uh Orthopedic nice bed or or they don't have a carpet they can't choose between these things they eat a piece of bread of day they don't have the comfort so when this guy said he saw this little girl when she was holding on to this letter because someone had written her some words of encouragement right it meant so much to her right because she didn't have these other things to distract her from those words and I feel as Christians that sometimes we can allow the Comforts of the word to distract us and our confidence in God's word right because the ultimate love letter that we have is the Bible you will not get any Victory outside of the word it doesn't matter how you feel I don't care how you think about about it I don't care how much you say you love God but there is no Victory outside of the word right so our first expectation uh especially as Americans uh is that outside of our dreams and plans because a lot of us you know we have some people have dreams they want to be doctors they want to be business people they want to raise a family they want to do all these things and it's all well and fine but our first expectation is that we are in a war right in the back of your mind and deep inside your heart you have to remember that you're in a fight and you're not just here to enjoy the things of the world when Adam and Eve sinned in the beginning in the garden they forfeited our right to have a picnic on Earth God told them because you've done this thing now you have to fight now you have to fight so we can't we can't put ourselves in the Millennium uh uh when we're currently fighting right now so we have to be diligent we have to be diligent we have to we have to uh wake up and uh uh seek the Holy Spirit early in the morning to ask him where is the battle at where is the battle today right and I I remember there's this one Bible verse when I was young and when I was a young Christian I read and I didn't really understand it but it said Jesus said take no thought of tomorrow for tomorrow will think of itself he said sufficient is the evil in the day that you have thereof and I and I didn't know what that meant but as you begin to grow in Christ he'll begin to open these things up to you and what that was is the battles that you're facing today that's what you need to focus on a lot of times we allow the past all right the past mistakes and stuff to distract us or we allow the future to try to distract us but there are battles that are going on currently in our life that we have to overcome and we're not going to do only way we'll overcome is by the revelation of the Holy Spirit and that's what the the prophet was telling us that the Holy Spirit has to give us the Revelation that one you're in a fight and then give you the revelation of what you need to do to overcome it so I thought that was a very very good Bible verse because it proves that every day we're fighting and we're looking to God to give us the word to overcome what those battles are for today right in this day and another expectation that we have to realize in this fight is that God always trains you before the battle fights God never sends a soldier into a fight unprepared right never never send you into a fight unprepared and I know that some of us have been in a situation where we've gotten new jobs and the onboarding process was horrible you know you're asking people to help you with this and that and they just say hey just read that just watch this video and then all of a sudden you just you just feel so overwhelmed right because we it's it's the mentality of a you know everybody for himself and so when the pressures of the job then become then then start to squeeze you you're always asking people for help right you feel frustrated you want to leave the job because you're not prepared to fight it uh and I know at my job I remember so we hired this one lady and um and she and I went up to her and she was just frustrated man she just seemed like she was just frustrated and stuff so I was telling some other the people and other the leaders of my job I'm like hey can someone go and Shadow her can someone go and like you know and what shadowing is shadowing is that you do the work first and let them watch you and then you step take a step back and then you let them do the work and as they're going through the pressures and stuff you're seeing how they react and you're you give them a word to say hey do this hey in that situation don't do that and then when they feel confident that's when you leave and then the and then now the person feels like I'm prepared right and if anything gets too drastic I can still call on someone from help right and so that's why I love that God doesn't think like man right God doesn't think like man like that no when God when God sees that a battle is coming up no he's giving you the best weapon that he could the army with which is his word right and it's his word and he'll prepare you before he sees cuz cuz the battles are are big and are small all and we don't know when they're going to come but God does know and when he sees the big battles coming down the road he starts to prepare you right he starts to prepare you right so that you can have Victory into that because the thing about it is when God sends you somewhere his name is attached to you that can't fail right it cannot fail uh a lot of times when we go into situations in our own uh uh our own thinking and our own will and then stuff just gets all messed up and and God so God can't attach himself to our thoughts right because then it would fail and it give the enemy a reason to mock God right so uh um David is a great example of this um I love reading about David um so you see Samuel Samuel had anointed David and uh anointed him the King right and so I can imagine David was happy he was out in the field watching the watching the Sheep sitting behind a tree sitting on a tree or something like that but he was just so happy that he was chosen uh not because of uh how good he was or how smart he was but because God just loved him right God just loved him then I can imagine you know a bear just came out of nowhere and took one of the sheep and David Rose up and started to go toward this bear and you know how it is when you're first doing something it's a nervousness right it's a nervousness so I can imagine you know David maybe running toward this bear and his knees were shaken but then I can see the Holy Spirit kind of overshadow David and say hey David Remember When when you was slinging that using that slingshot in your backyard and hitting that tree I want you to do the exact same thing and throw it at the bear all right right and so then David took that sling threw it at the bear hit the bear the bear dropped right bear was a a thlb bear 10 foot pound bear and it just dropped before him right and and and the the prophet said that that was such a supernatural event to David because David was a ruddy guy he was small and he knew that it would have been impossible for himself to take on a bear like that so I believe that moment gave David confidence in God's word yes sir right in God's word this is before Goliath came on the scene right and so then I can see maybe you know now the lion came out of nowhere right and the lion just took a sheep right and he had the same he used the same exact faith that he used to take the bear and he took that slingshot threw it at The Lion and the Bible says that the lion drop the sheep and drop down but it Rose back up but when the lion Rose back up that didn't Shake David cuz a lot of times when we go through our trials and we're overcoming something we're overcoming something then something else comes that is not the same and then sometimes you can get all out of control just like if you're on the job and a situation comes up that you that you're not sure about so when this lion rose up David still have faith right cuz he had seen a supernatural event and the Bible says that he took the lion by the beard and a knife and slew him him right so he realized that he was no longer ordinary but that the god that anointed him even though he wasn't on paper he wasn't strong enough to fight against these things but this but this Supernatural vent that God had uh uh uh uh given David gave him confidence in the word and it gave him so much confidence that when he was going to fight Goliath he didn't know he was going to fight Goliath right it was it was an unexpected battle right and I'm telling you right now that there's going to be a lot of those coming in your life Goliath is not going to tell you he's coming he's just going to show up and so you're going to need to be prepared to be able to fight it or else you're going to run away but David was just walking just to give uh some of his I think some of his brothers lunch and he saw Goliath boasting in against the children of Israel and the Bible says that he said I'll go and fight him and everyone was looking at him like he was crazy cuz it was just little kid maybe uh the same size as Joseph they thought well what how what gives you confidence that you can do it he said well uh there was a bear there was a lion and I slew it right I threw I had a slingshock i slew it and it fell and this battle will be the exact same no matter how much Goliath was taller and bigger than these things he had faced but because God had prepared him right God had prepared him it gave him confidence that he would be able to take out Goliath what was God doing during that time he was preparing David for the great battle so you see the uh um it was the victories that that David had before that gave him confidence for this big victory and I'm telling you right now that it's it's the little victories that you have every single day that prepare you for the big stuff that's why a lot of times when people come across great trials and they're cowering and their F and and and they're afraid and they're praying and they're crying out it's because they didn't recognize what God was doing to try to prepare them for it right what God was trying to prepare them for it so it's just the small victories that you face every single day right uh uh that help you to uh overcome bigger ones because healing is easy victories are easy when when David saw Goliath it was a easy fight for him no matter how big he was it was such an easy fight for him right it was and he never fought someone that big before but he was confident in the word that he had so it's it's we have to we have to look at ourselves and our lives and our in our life and how can we expect God to give us the faith right to to heal a great disease or great situations uh when we can't even apologize to our brother that we've done wrong all right right you know small things like that or you know you uh uh um or you can't have patience with people on the job right and you're making let's say $20 an hour and you want God to give you $50 an hour and you can't even have patience at 20 or $15 an hour and you want God to give you a big increase which is just a bigger battle right so it's what you overcome what with what you have before you that helps you to prepare for that battle uh uh in the future so you know and everybody wants to move everybody wants to stop the sun when we read the Bible everybody wants to stop the sun everybody wants to walk on water everybody wants to cast out demons and all these things and I was thinking and there was a situation at my house uh when I was when I was with my dad I came home and he had accidentally opened up my mail and I just got all upset I was like why you open up my mail this is my stuff and I got all upset with him and I went back to my room and I sat down and the Holy Spirit came and said you know you shouldn't have talked to your dad like that and I said Lord you know in my heart I didn't mean to say that you know I did not mean to say that he said I understand that but you need to go up and apologize and there was a battle because Pride was in the way because I didn't want to get up and go and say that even though I knew I was wrong and I was sorry about it so there was a little battle there right we want to move mountains and stuff like that but can't even move our pride out the way right and so I had to I had I had to hunker down and the Holy Spirit still dealing with me and I had to get up out my chair that was a great Victory then I had to take steps and I started walking to my dad's room and I went to my dad I said Dad I'm sorry for saying that to you please forgive me what a great Victory because I can take that to a great situation now and I can look back into and say hold on a second if I Deni myself then I don't care what the doctor says because the doctor's going to come with you with specifics he'll say that your blood level is this you see your white blood cell count is small your losing strength there's no hope for you and if you don't know how to deny yourself you're going to believe it so it's those small victories that you get every single day that help you to fight the goliaths when they come right am amen so we're going to also so now let's go to the uh let's go to the New Testament now uh just to see some more examples of God preparing you for the fight uh and we're going to look we're going to take a look at our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh now Jesus had a friend in Lazarus right and Lazarus got sick one time and the family went to uh Jesus for assistance because they knew he could turn the situation around but God had something else for Jesus to do right and so when Martha went and told him all these things God had Jesus do something else right so another expectation you have to realize in the Battle Is God don't give you all the details for Stuff God doesn't give you all the details so you got to trust uh uh in his word and in his timing and when he says things right cuz Jesus told them that Lazarus doesn't have a sickness unto death right he didn't have a sickness unto death and then but uh um but as we as we read later on in the Bible verse Lazarus did end up dying so could you imagine the battle Martha was in at night time knowing that Jesus said oh no he's not going to die and then he died right that's when the enemy loves to come in your ear and say hold on a second Martha you know Jesus can heal you've seen him healed millions of times before can you imagine the battle in her head where she's wondering why why' you let him die Jesus right and all a sudden now she's in she she's in a great battle right and and and and maybe Jesus uh uh maybe Jesus so so the thing about it is Jesus before all this happened Jesus was in the will of God and doing the perfect will of God and God had maybe he was uh after a healing service or something he was out and about and God gave him a vision and that Vision was him standing before a grave crying out to Lazarus to come out so God already knew something was going to happen but God had given him the assurance and the victory that uh uh Lazarus would live but he didn't say all those things right and so sometimes God won't tell you all these things you just got to trust in what word he gives you right he knows exactly what's going on and that can be hard and it's it's and it's a trying time for our faith right it's a trying time for our faith right uh and so we have to uh um and so we're going to turn to uh uh turn our Bibles and you don't have to turn to I just go to the Bible verses just to uh kind of go through the situation we're going to go to John John 11 just to kind of show John 11:20 and this is when this is when uh Martha was um Jesus was coming back he already had the vision that Lazarus was going to live and this was Martha coming and this is look at Martha's attitude after she had gone through those battles at night time where she uh uh was battling with hold on a second Jesus you could have heal you could have healed my dad the Bible says in John 11:20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him and I like that because she didn't run away from him right she didn't run away from him she still went to the word no matter how she was feeling no matter how she was upset she didn't understand what was going on but still ran to the word right but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been there my brother had not died but I know now but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask God God will give it to thee now can you imagine like give me that kind of faith that uh even when a situation and you just don't you don't have all the answers and and that's another expectation in the battle like I said before you won't have all the answers and that in itself is a battle that in itself is a battle where you're looking to find a reason of what's going on and regardless of all that you still have to trust in God right you still have to trust in God so when we come down here to verse uh 33 um it reads here when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they said they said unto the Lord come and see in verse 35 it says Jesus wept now this is a this is an interesting thing cuz um this is actually a short bible verse and we had from the youth I didn't know they answered that a question they said what is the shortest Bible verse now I knew right praise God but here it says that it says here that Jesus it says here that Jesus wept uh and if you read the message uh people tried to challenge the prophet and a lot of people still believe today in religion that Jesus was just a man and they use this Bible verse as a a proof to show how can God cry uhuh right how can God and it looks it looks very very conf convincing because he had the victory uhuh he knew Lazarus had the victory yeah so why is he still crying why is he still crying right uh um and but I love it and that's why you need the prophet you need the Holy Spirit to open the word to you I love that he wept the Bible says that he was tempted so he could help those that are tempted right he went through things that we did as a man so he could understand how we felt about things right how we felt about things he didn't just come on Earth and a lot of people thought he would come on Earth as like a king and just conquer everything and you know coming uh purple and gold and just Untouchable but he came just as us he was tempted like he was tempted as us uh uh he wept like us to understand what are these people going through so that I can give them a victory right and and and uh um and we have uh uh and we have the and and we have to realize that for our situations we also have the word we all it may have not been a vision but we also have the word to help us overcome in our situations right God has already given us a vision that we're coming out of our situations as our precious brother Jerry preached last week it was before the foundation of the world we already had the uh uh uh the Victory and stuff but sometimes the emotions can just overtake you right emotions just overtake you even though you got the word you know we get sad we get upset you know we question God why is it is happening to me right so it's and and and and and it's tough because you're just going through your life plans you may you know you may want to uh um you may some of the sisters you know you talk to some of the sisters and they want to start a family right it's in their heart for them to start a family God gave them the possession to be a mother and to have kids and then you go to the doctor and the doctor says well you'll never have kids right now they know the Bible verses where God has delivered people before they've all heard it before but this but because they're going through it the elves it's tough for them to see the word it's tough for them to see the word so that's why I appreciate how Jesus could cry could come to Lazarus grave and begin to cry and begin to uh and begin to weep even though he knew the victory was assured but sometimes when you're in the flesh it just overtakes you sometimes so I'm glad that God can himself be tempted and be and go through situations like that and still see the word through that right and and because we uh um because we all we all deal with those frustrations you know when a doctor gives you the report and says that you're not going to get better you're not going to get well it drops your heart right or when uh when you hear about someone uh uh a wayward kid the kid says you know I don't want to serve God no more right it just causes your heart to drop there's not enough word that can prevent that that feeling from coming even though you know you got the Bible verse that says th in the household shall be saved but nothing prevents those emotions from over overing you right so another expectation is in the battle is that no matter what you're going through the frustrations uh uh the sadness and and the tears and and and the questioning and stuff always speak the word after and that's what the prophet has said about Jesus when he said yeah he sure did wept he wept when he was a man but after that when he told Lazarus to rise about the grave it was God and so in our situations we have to recognize that we can still speak the word afterwards there was a man in the Bible who was uh he wanted to get healed right and he had leprosy or some some sickness on his skin or something like that and they were telling him to do this and do that and he was just frustrated he didn't want to do none of that they told him hey you need to go into this uh uh this um these these Waters over here he said these waters are dirty right and he was just frustrated all the time but the beautiful thing about that is he still believed the word after all those frustration he still belied the word after all those frustrations and God came through for him right so I'm and and and I like that typing and I like that um uh uh the typing for even for Christ himself to see Lazarus come out to see Lazarus die and then come out the grave so that one day when he would be on the cross right and he would be approaching death he could look back to what God had already did for Lazarus and have the confidence to come back out of the Grave right so that's the expectation is God always prepares you for a battle that's coming up right and so now we're going to turn to uh exodius Exodus I mean Exodus 3 uh we're going to read uh chapter 11 we're going to read chapter uh no chapter 3 verse 11 we're going to look at Moses someone else that God uh God had to prepare before A great battle was come right and we're going to yep so like so it says here and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the CH children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve me you shall ye shall serve God upon this mountain and another expectation have when you're in battle is it's already won amen it's already one when God told Moses that he said when you guys come out of here this is the mountain y'all going to serve me on the one that you standing on right now you're going to come right back here on this mountain right which was their possession right the battle had already been won when God has said that first word right and we're going to turn to chapter uh go to chapter chap 4 now to see another expectation right and we're going to go to verses uh 6-8 we're going to read verses 6 through 8 because a lot of times you know when God told Moses that it should have been enough right but you got to remember that we're in the flesh now right we're in the flesh and we struggle with these things you know so God has to build our confidence God has to show us uh uh uh in little victory that he is able to do what he said he would do because sometimes we we we just need that we need that uh uh uh experience to trust God for bigger things so verse four says and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take uh um put forth thine hand and take it by the oh wait no it's uh yeah six yeah yeah verse six yeah yeah verse six it says and the Lord said furthermore unto him put now thy hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was lepos as snow so leprosy was a disease during that time that was like the cancer for our day right it was something that was uh uh people when they saw that you were lepos they kicked you out they didn't want nothing to do with you because they didn't want that spreading right this it was such a big deal in their day and here was God and if we could put our spiritual binoculars on in this single verse right here in the spiritual realm God was allowing that demon to come on to Moses right God allowed this demon to come on to Moses and then when he told him to take his hand his uh uh his hand out of his bosom he said the demon all right now you got to go he was trying to show Moses who was in charge right he was trying to show Moses who was in charge right right eight and it shall come to pass reading verse eight and it shall come to pass if they believe if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and this is why other expectation comes into play right um You got to expect to get hit you got to expect that Satan's going to hit you Satan is not like a little um you know a a little nerdy kid and uh one of those nerdy kids in high school where bullies just pick on him and just do whatever they want to say no the Bible says he is a worthy adversary which means that you got to take him serious you got to take him serious right and the prophet said uh uh um the prophet preaching the message he says sometimes when God gives you the victory he says that you're healed from your sickness he says sometimes you get sicker when God gives you the victory over a situation that you have sometimes it gets worse right Prophet says sometimes it gets worse and when Moses went to the children of Israel uh uh and tried to and perform the signs and stuff like that there was one time where the uh Pharaoh caused them to do more work he took away the task Masters and he caused them to do more work than what they needed but God still had the victory in their eyes and they could not see that so that's why it's important to keep your focus always on the word uhhuh amen right always on the word right um so it was it's it's a um and and another another expectation uh uh in this fight is God does not need much in order for you to win and that's a big one and that's a big one because a lot of times we think we need so much and that's why God hates denominations right when you look at the denominational Spectrum on one end you have Catholics and Catholics you know they're not even allowed to read their Bible because you know the minister is supposed to uh minister is supposed to interpret that and then they have the confession box and things like that and it and it it puts God in the past because when uh when the children of Israel went before God he was in the temple at one time right and then you have uh the other uh spectrum of the uh denominations which is the Pentecostals and the Pentecostals they put themselves in the Millennium but with sin and it's like no you can't just yeah you may have experienced The Filling of the Holy Ghost and uh enjoyed the uh the gifts and stuff like that but you still have to live a clean life right so God hates denominations because it just it just spins you all over the place and it takes away how the Simplicity of the Gospel because a lot of times in some of your victories all you need is obedience right all you got to do is obey sometimes God says do that you do that the victory W right and a lot of Pentecostals don't get that right because they think they can do whatever they want live in sin and still have the victory all right and that's why they struggle with a lot of things uh on the Catholic side uh uh they need uh on the Catholic side they put their faith too much in men right but you can't follow a man and that's why uh even in this message like people try to bring the denominations into the message and that's why we don't bow down to the prophet we love brother Brandon right we love our Prophet right but uh uh if you read the story uh in the life of the Prophet you'll see when he was young I believe he shot himself in a foot or something and the Bible said that and not the Bible said but he said that he was falling down in the hill that's right and he said he was calling for his mom and dad when someone's going through hell you don't want to follow somebody that's calling for their mom and dad oh my you want someone that's calling for mommy and daddy when they're going down to hell cuz the Bible says that when Jesus descended into hell he was preaching right which is a type of Life which he was still living the standard in the region of hell you want to follow someone that has confidence that no matter what they're going through in the region of hell with all the tears and the horrors he was still keeping the standard he wasn't calling on God he wasn't afraid or nothing the prophet even said that he went right up to the throne of Satan took back the keys and kicked them that's somebody that you want to follow when you're going through a battle right and Jesus had the word to give him Victory through that but right because he knew Lazar had Rose from the gra rose from the dead he knew that uh uh Jonah was would be delivered out the uh uh the belly of of the fish right he had the word and that's why it's important for us sometimes that uh uh to deny ourselves denying yourselves gives you the victory right denying yourselves gives you the victory that's why a lot of times you know you're expecting God to do great things in your life but can't even wake up to read your Bible you can't even deny yourself to wake yourself to to read your Bible you can't deny yourself food to fast right fasting hasn't changed with American culture and current denominational preaching and stuff you would think these things don't exist no more but God hasn't changed his word amen sometimes you got to fast all right sometimes you got to put down the plate amen amen and in American culture it's real hard because we have an abundance of stuff you go into the store the candy aisles are full you go the public everything is full right so it's hard for you to deny yourself but sometimes you got to fast for a victory right another thing and brother Jack preached this sometimes you have to praise God when you're not when you don't even feel like doing it you got to praise God when you don't feel like doing it right all God all God is doing in these situations is teaching you how to deny yourself because just as much just as much as it is important to have faith in God oh I have faith in God it's just as important to deny the flesh amen it's important to deny the Flesh in order to get a victory and God does not need much God does not need much uh uh I can imagine that when David was going to fight Goliath right um I me let's say David went by a stream and he was going to go and let's say there was was a bunch of stones out there and David was going to pick maybe David was going to just a dramatization maybe David was going to pick up a big rock and God said no just pick up the small one pick that small one up yeah right pick that small one up right CU I can I can I can see you know maybe Jesus looking back cuz he said you know if you had the faith of a mustard seed it'll move a mountain which is and and what people what people uh the prophet taught us this thing is uh of having faith in mustard seed is just not having small Faith it's that your faith I mean that faith is completely unadulterated it's nothing but God's word ain't mixed with nothing that amount of Faith right can move a mountain and that's why the prophet was inspired to say that when the weakest Christian that's right even if you're in a situation and the enemy comes in your ear and says you're weak go ahead and agree with him because the prophet said when the weakest Christian gets on their knees hell trembles hell trembles there's still a victory right God doesn't need much but a lot of times we we in our minds and you think about it in the world today you know we got atomic bombs and you know in back in the 90s they talked about a space program where they wanted to create satellites to shoot uh shoot the missiles out the uh out the sky and we got all these bombs and stuff like that and it's like you don't need that much to fight if you have arms with if you have a problem with your brother just go and say sorry that's right one of the greatest weapons to cease all the wars just say sorry brother if I've offended you you're my brother and I love you see Christians don't need much to win and a lot of times and that's why a lot of times you see a lot of the Pentecost Pentecostals all the shouting they do and smacking people in the head and stuff on stage you don't need much to win Victory as long as there's faith and there's love right and even in a small abundance Satan doesn't like that right because it's a Living Word it's a living example it's it's showing him something that he's not and he can't stand and he can't stand against that right so in closing um you know it's it is important for us as Christians uh to recognize that we're living in a culture that is the opposite of what God thinks we're living in a culture that says it's okay to go through life and have plans and have uh uh uh uh uh try to try to plan your future and live in abundance things and just go you know going on vacation and stuff like that but sometimes when you're on vacation it's a battle may come up with family I know a lot of us have probably experienced that you're going on a vacation with your family you expecting to be relaxing and all a sudden somebody says something it's like oh man we supposed to be we supposed to be enjoying ourselves and all a sudden you in a battle and it's a reminder that you're constantly in a war right the world says you're on vacation God says you're in a war right no matter what you're going through God says you're in a war right so it's it's imperative as as Believers to take God and trust him uh uh uh in his word learn to deny ourselves recognize we are in a war no matter the situation no matter what we're no matter how good things look we can't fall to that deception right as we want uh pray to close out Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for your word oh Lord Lord God that has come oh Lord we thank you oh Lord God for the truth that you've placed in us oh Lord God it's a it's a confidence that we can stand on oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord God we know that we can't do the victory we can't we can't win the battle within ourselves oh Lord God that's why you that's why you told uh the children of Judah oh Lord in 2 Chronicles you said the battle is yours oh Lord God and Lord you prepare us oh Lord God and in that preparation the preparation is to deny ourselves so that you can shine through right and that's why people they didn't understand Christ yes he wept as a man that was to show that there was still there's still a man aspect there oh Lord but when that man aspect has gotten to the point where it can't do nothing else God you have to show yourself oh Lord God we're not depending upon our own strength oh Lord God we're not depending upon our own knowledge we're not depending upon our own ways of things to bring about a victory over Lord but we're trying to do whatever we can to deny ourselves oh Lord God and let you win the victory for us oh Lord God oh Lord God we know Lord the one of the greatest weapons in the Bible is rest the prophet said the holy spirit is rest that we rest and knowing oh Lord God that you have everything in control you know all of our needs oh Lord God you know the battles that we'll Face Tomorrow next year 10 years from now Lord God and we don't know it oh Lord Jesus Christ that alone should make us depend upon you oh Lord God oh Lord but the but the luxuries of this life the abundance the internet where we can get so much information to to to to the point that it would that we would we can think that we don't need you oh Lord God oh Lord but we're thankful Lord God uh uh for the discipline oh Lord God that you allow us to get broken down oh Lord Jesus Christ and the in in even with all of these devices around us oh Lord God you would break us down Lord God to show oh Lord God that you're the one in control of Our Lives oh Lord God no matter how smart we think we are no matter how or how powerful that we think we are how much we got it together oh Lord you want to show us oh Lord God that you're the one that's in control Lord God we thank you oh lord for the victory oh Lord God while we're waiting we don't know all the answers to stuff oh Lord God but you never expected us to know all the answers oh Lord God so we cast that out of our heads oh Lord God and we just trust oh Lord God that you said you would do what you would do in our lives oh Lord God we thank you and we love you Lord God in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen thank you brother God bless you amen praise the lord we certainly thank God for his word uh on tonight uh brother Quinton just sharing with us the expectations in the battle and uh I like to say it's a very practical uh things that he uh laid out uh for us and uh recognizing first that we are in a war um and um God never sends us into the war unprepared and um you know and the other things that God's not going to give us all the details and um um and God doesn't need much for us to win so um that that was just a really really wonderful thought here uh on tonight and really really appreciate our brother uh just uh bringing that to our hearts amen it's good to come to church amen always good to come to church and I and I like that little example that he used of um um you know us not following a man uh when it comes to um brother brandom he's a prophet it yes and we respect his office but our adoration our Glory our praise it goes to the Lord Jesus Christ and um you know just the example of both Jesus going to hell and brother brandom going to hell brother brandom going to hell screaming for Mama and Daddy and God you know I mean he didn't say there was no mama there there was no Daddy there there was no God there he just you know he was in trouble but when Jesus went to hell he preached preach to the souls that were lost and the pre the souls in prison he went there preaching so he is our example amen that we're following I just I like that I really really like that I'll use that again sometime amen amen I give credit where credit is do but but that was real good tonight praise the Lord uh let me have uh tonight's announcements and um you know um I keep forgetting there is another meeting that's coming up and I I have a flyer at my house and I need to bring it to you but brother steeman they're having a meeting the first

before we leave tonight anybody have a praise report or prayer request that they want to make mention of uh before we go okay I see a couple all right he'll bring the microphone to you amen thank you brother God bless you I actually have two pray requests um the first one is my one of my oldest Grands um is suffering from a constant nose bleed and today this morning it's actually gotten worse where where it's bleeding it's just running like water as blood clots so I'm not sure what the doctor's going to do with her as of yet she have to see a specialist when they talking about hospitalizing her to um take care of that issue and then the second one I have a um a patient that was diagnosed with breast cancer she asked for prayer um when they they diagnosed her back in August of breast cancer and they constantly was giving her medication and making it giving her more than what she was supposed to take and and um it burnt her skin real bad um her skin started peeling her face her hands she was hospitalized for a week this past week gone she couldn't walk her whole body had un swo up real bad so she was asking for prayer and if she's up to her she'll be in church with me on Sunday so just keep her in prayer um okay okay praise the Lord and um I know we have another the request back there but before I forget let me just share two things uh we'll pray for her tonight but if she does come with you on Sunday we'll anoint her with oil and pray for her uh again all right uh other thing is for your um granddaughter um you can either do this or you can have brother Jimmy do it but brother brandom said that anyone that had a nose bleed um what you do is you read Ezekiel 16 and6 three times over them and then you say a word of prayer so just make sure you read Ezekiel 16-6 three times and then have a word of prayer over her okay before they take her to the hospital uh our daughter had the same thing one night and we I thought she was going to go to the hospital but I read that three times and prayed and she ain't had another nose bed since that time so not that I know of so um but just read that amen over your granddaughter yes brother you had um something pray I got an interview tomorrow and I just ask that the Lord go before me but also overshadow the interview just to make sure it goes well all right all right amen we will certainly certainly do that brother Jos here has his hand up um short testimony uh I thought it Go real good with the message um uh so a a lot of times like he was saying with David things that happen strengthen us strengthen our faith especially I think another message that he preached he said that even when something happens and you're you're uh uh strong through it and follow the word it actually also strengthen your faith you know it gives you better Victory so um uh recently I I had uh raised some of my prices and I made a letter uh stating that why my prices were going up and and and that my profit margin was staying the same was just the cost of uh Fuel and and and and and and stuff and there was two people this this one day I think it was last week on a Thursday um two people that that I needed hiding God in and I needed was going to them and I needed to let them know and it was kind of battling the devil was like kind of battling my head telling me don't don't don't tell them you know they're not going to go They're not going to accept it they're going to they're going to fire you they're going to say something so I just kind of like as I was going to the first stop I I in my heart I was just driving and ask the Lord I said Lord you know I feel that you led me to do this so so would you help me here take control of this I went to the first stop um I I finished the horse and I I when I'm leaving the lady wasn't there send her a text put her in a text you know why price are going on I said from here on the next time it's going to be this much because of this um and she sends me a text back and she's like oh it's not a problem actually I'll just I'll pay that from from this time so whoa praise the Lord you know I get I get to my next customer and and the the guy works overnight and he's not there when I go and if he is he's sleeping and he leaves the money for the horses under this little doggy in in the in the um in the front of the house so when I get there the the I see the dog sparking and the guy's there so I already had the text all set and I said when I finish the horse and I leave I grab the money I'll send them the text he comes out and and and and I'm doing the horse and he comes out there he's like man I haven't seen you in a while how's everything doing I everything's good you know doing the horse fin I'm doing the horses and and he he's like when he's about to leave he says hey do do I owe you any more money do do do your races did your prices go up do do I need to pay you more and I was like no no no what what' you say I said you got to see this man you got to see look look at this text that I have written down for you that I was going to send you cuz my price this did go up but don't worry about it it's it from next time forward this is what's going to be he said next time forward no no no no I'm going to pay you that right now so so I just want to say that the when whenever the Lord is got something for you you know the devil's going to tell you don't don't don't do it so anybody this H uh Lord's leading them to get a race or maybe they need it or something just if the Lord is leading you just go ahead and do it he will help you through it cuz he helped me through that amen amen praise the Lord certainly appreciate uh that that testimony very very encouraging um all right um two things I want to ask prayer for my uncle I forgot to mention he um he lost his wife um want to say a week or so ago and um just want to remember my uncle James in prayer and uh my praise report is that I'm happy to be home uh we uh um we we made it there uh safely and and returned safely and I was um I can't say that you know when I when when I think about trips that long I I it's hard for me to get my expectations up uh because of just the the tra traving but we we didn't have we had one issue going where one flight uh was uh kind of like um not cancelled just delayed by an hour which would have caused us to miss our connecting flight which is you know that was a flight going all the way to Sydney but um uh we had prayer we asked for prayer Brothers prayed and God grounded the plane for us again and uh and they held they plane held up in Los Angeles and waited for us to get there from Atlanta before they would you know they would take off and there were 11 other people that were going with us but uh I believe it's because the two sons of God was on the plane uh that's why you know they they they did it but we uh we thank God for that and meetings were uh a great success um Australia is a nation that rejected or denied brother brandom from entering into their Nation uh he had filed his visa and they told him that he couldn't come and uh so you know when you have people that were re reject the prophet you can imagine just spiritually where uh where people are and most of the messages come into Australia through people that have moved there from other countries like Zimbabwe um um um New Zealand uh all kind of of the Philippines and people have come in and that's how the message is actually entered into uh the country but um you know when you get there and you see just um just the needs of the people spiritually you realize that hey if God has giv you something to be able to help somebody then you want to yield um whatever God has given you to be able to help so we were happy to be able to go and just be a blessing uh to the church they were certainly a blessing to us and and they're already talking about trying to do it again you know and this was not even the pastor I mean it was the people that came to the meeting the very first day of the meeting the very first day um they um they asked the pastor like are you going to do this again next year we need the next year and the year after that and you say well so I can't promise y'all uh that I'll be back but I certainly pray you know uh about it and we'll see what the Lord will do but um I say certainly we want to do all we can to be a help but uh we just got to wait on the Lord amen so uh but we thank God for a very very successful uh meeting there in uh Melbourne uh Australia amen uh so let's uh let's pray over the request that we have tonight and um and we will um prepare to dismiss uh father we um first want to thank you for the testimony there from brother and God how you just blessed him uh with raising his prices and and even confirmed it with two people that were willing to pay right then uh on the price increase and Lord we just uh pray that just continue to bless his uh business um and and and and hearing that brother Garen is about to step into an interview on tomorrow and uh we're asking that you would go before him that you would bless him as he walks through the door uh and that you God would just give him all the answers that he needs to make the people feel comfortable that they're hiring the right person uh for the job may they look Beyond time uh Lord many things and just give him a peace Lord God that that that that would help him Lord just to settle in and and and answer whatever question is being presented uh to them Father we uh want to pray for uh the request of sister Vera her um grandchild that's having this issue of the bloody nose God has uh they would gather around a child and read Ezekiel over that child three times Ezekiel uh 166 uh God I I watched you do it for my daughter so God I'm I I know that you'll do it for uh her granddaughter that you God would just uh bring healing to that body uh we can we curse it at its root whatever it is we curse it and father May life come forth uh even right now also this friend that is suffering from cancer not even anything they did uh but Lord just something went wrong my process that went wrong and now they're dealing with the consequences of it we know that not even cancer will stand in the way of a prayer so as Believers we pray and God we uh uh ask that you would move on the scene for this friend uh Lord uh we know that you are a Healer we know that there's nothing too hard for you so we pray that you would just uh uh uh Lord get involved in this and Lord if this is an opportunity for her to come closer to you then we welcome the opportunity grateful that she's able to come to the house of the Lord uh we we want to lay hands and pray over as the scripture tells us to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is what the Bible says so God we do things according to the Bible and God we expect you to do what you said you do no matter what the condition is no matter what the situation is we just expect you to fulfill your word Lord we uh pray that as we leave this place but not your presence that you would go with us that you would keep us uh until we're able to come to together again as we will listen to the tape on Friday night may you speak to us uh once more through your word and may you receive all the glory all the honor and all the praise for all that we do God it's in Jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord Amen brother Mark would you dismiss everybody God bless you
