sort of goes with the purse only on Starkman so instead of reading a psalm I wanted to read this quote to you says no man knows the things of God say the Spirit of God and he to whom the Spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted a Bible we have accepted a great thing the truth of it but it is still not real to most people because the revelation by the Spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible says in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by arguing with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us that will take the revenue amen we need revelation more than anything and we must understand that we are the very righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ I'm so grateful for that praise our Lord amen let's end this little song together I know who I

Jerry and Mike and brother Devon and brother Jeffrey I understand they went out there Okeechobee to start handing out flyers to let everybody know we were we were coming a man and I was told that brother Devon happened to run into one particular lady who was responsible for publishing things in a newspaper only God could orchestrate there and he talks to her and tell her what they was doing and I mean they ran out of flyers they went to Walmart and the lady at Walmart got bit some flyers for all right and you know they've just you know wonderful testimonies already coming back from from

be a kind of in the city letting people know that we're come in with lightning fire again a man and that's the the theme of our meetings a man light the fire again and so we have some some poster boards that brother Ford made and you know kind of like what you would see when people say vote for me vote for me and I got all this stuff post around where we ain't vote for nobody but Jesus but we're gonna have like the fire again you know and strategic places there then one big sign once you get to the tent but next next Friday at 7:30 we'll be there and next Saturday at 7:30 we'll be there I think brother Mike called me and told me that there was a man in the neighborhood that he works it gave him a flyer and the man say what I'm uh I'm driving over to Okeechobee to be a part of it so now this man don't even know us oh this y'all church this what's up Church doing right you need to be part of what's going on it's a man a man a man it was a statement made I was reading recently some people was complaining about the brother brand was preaching I he should just lay off the sisters and all this and and he'd come right back the next service and told him everything they said in the conversation and they still didn't repent right but he told him at the end of service he said sisters or is it you know he just kind of said it anything sisters just a congregation so you've gone as far as you can go in God say until you're ready to give more you have gone as far as you can go until you are ready to give more you have gone as far as you can go I say what a statement right so if you looking for more from God maybe God looking for more from you right but you've gone as far as you can go until you're ready to give God more I give you more I give you more I give you more praise the Lord so long a man we just love the Lord all right so let's read here I got two passes of scriptures that I want to read and also brother Ruben is that - Aden is that right okay brother Ruben so good to have you with us god bless you amen I invited my brother Jerry hey man all the specials man I really enjoyed those specials and I heard that song that sister Sean was saying just a few weeks ago and and you know she brought that forth I said man that was alright when I heard it it was a gap planning guitar and he was singing up and so she was saying I'm thinking myself man I wish brother Jeffery could give that guitar just you know work with that then next special brother Jeffrey come up here with this guitars as they brought ass alright that that's that's that's the only comes but I just appreciate that and sister Michelle thank you so much I appreciate you all and just everything that's happened here enough in the name of the Lord a man a man and if you all just noticed some of the words and brother Jeffery songs I see a generation rise enough to take their place with selfless faith with selfless faith this is I see a near revival stirring as we pray and seek we're on our knees were on our knees so that goes right along with let the let the light in the fire again and that's what we preached on today light the fire again a man a man praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 12 verse 29 says for our God is a consuming fire a man our God is a consuming fire and I I do have another verse and judges too but I tell you what I had y'all standing for so long I'm gonna just say a word of Prayer and then y'all can get that it you know hold to it a little school bring it out amen here in our sermon let's pray amen before you have your seats father we are grateful for everything that has happened here this morning we have felt the anointing of God in this place and God we know that there is more that you want to do so we're praying that the Spirit of the Lord would have the preeminence a man and this portion of the service as we endeavor to just bring a thought a man as you have given it to us and help me God to get myself out of the way help the people also to get themselves out of the way may they pull on the Word of God and me you speak Lord the things that need to be spoken here today I may have no but God you're in control so take take all of us that move us to decide that you might get all the glory and all the honor a man out of this portion of the services in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated so so our thought here is is like the fire again and I feel that I'll just need to kind of lay a foundation for a few things a man but let me let me read the scripture out of out of judges to a man if you would just follow me there I want to start hit verse 70 and it says and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlive Joshua who have seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance and Timnath Harris and the mouth of ephraim on the north side of the hill - and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there rose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel a man and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Lord and serve Balaam and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of land of Egypt and followed other gods the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to anger and they forsook the Lord and served bail and Ashtaroth and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers and spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so they could not any longer stand before their enemies with a soever they went out and the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord has said and as the Lord has sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed it meant so I wanted that's a background scripture that we want to try to work our way back into a man but if you just bear with me here today I want to kind of lay a couple things in we're doing something that for spirit and truth has never been done before amen we're doing something that really a lot of other churches don't do anymore a man and with this tent that we're taking - you know with light the fire again - something that the Lord put in our heart and I know that being message believers a man you know we don't see that too much anymore and there's probably a number of reasons why we don't see it a man one one particular reason is that is is I got to be careful when I say this but one particular reason that is not effective my god right that's one particular reason is that the Lord is certainly you know there was a generation that came before us a man where that was very effective and now Dawn has moved on to something else where so what they did before or what they did before is not it's not effective today so what I want to just kind of start off by saying is that we're not trying to revive the world right we're not trying to set up a tent that could pull 14,000 people in a man and and and we're not trying to be like Billy Graham right we're not trying to be like all Roberts you know and I think that's where we kind of got a little confusion in because even though we're not trying to be like them we are trying to get that last seat so if one comes for from this then our work was worth it's alright a man so yeah we're not trying to be like them but we are trying right to get that last seat praise the Lord and that's where the church has missed it right we're very comfortable being within our four walls but every once in a while we need to get on the outside and do something meet somebody where they're at they haven't come to you you go to him amen and and we know that brother Branham told us a story of the mother Eagle right the mother Eagle had to go looking for her baby she never waited for the baby to come to her but she went flying over the area setting up a tent huh amen she went flying over the area trying to find that seat she be there was one there but she didn't know where it was so she went out amen and she began this let out a scream and when I scream without that baby can identify the baby was found in a chicken coop oh alright some some may not be with me so let me slow down just to hit me but what happened was that you know the store was told that this mother Eagle lost more than eggs and I couldn't kid mama couldn't understand where the egg was you know and uh but she knows she gave birth she knew that you know I got three eggs I only have two here somebody got one of my eggs right and somehow the egg ended up out of her nest and ended up in a chicken coop now you need to understand something that amen if the atmosphere is right it'll bring forth a birth and because that bait that that baby eagle was in the atmosphere underneath a mother hen but even though that atmosphere birth took place the ego was never a chicken the eat of the eagle you know could not understand why it was different but you can understand why it acted different why it look different it just have no identification but that is they better they stay faithful in the chicken house stay right there and once they run I still got my baby out here and my baby Pelican has already come to cook but I gotta go find my baby and the mother Eagle f7 always just beginning a lot of screaming and while she's screaming the loot baby Eagles down there in a chicken coop and looks at them say I'm not gonna buy with that say I don't know I never heard this term before never uh preaching like this before but I'm identified with that type of screen and then the lovely eagle just began to circle and just begin to scream and weren't they Halloween you wanna go by the water spot maybe that will either have some questions for the chickens Roy came out so like that and the chickens say you were made then enough but I look different than y'all why can't I be out there like that don't even move a certain way somewhere honey somebody and wherever there we went finally when they could get the answers that they needed from the chickens can't give the answers they needed from the chickens mama comes free with again and then where mom alone that scream struck on the inside of that baby but I was down down the chicken coop you say and then squeeeeeeze begin to go back and forth they begin to communicate and Mama begin to tell that eagle I'm not coming down to the chicken coop but i'ma let you know you can't come out you can't come out [Applause] I'm only inside of you that you can come out of the chicken coop when you get ready just two weeks and before you knew that Eagle was at the chicken coop never to see the chickens again profit all that stay and everything like what in the world is that but he was talking about you because you was that Eagle locked down and denominational systems use that even locked into the fence in a little but when you finally heard the word of God something struck on the inside of him and he couldn't help but respond hallelujah that one part of my notes I'm just trying to set a foundation so we understand what is going on why don't water Holy Spirit would just lead us to do something like this like I said we're not trying to go out and win the nation but we are looking for that last seat and and we'll do this to try to get their attention whatever we can and so anybody that want to criticize it well praise the pray for us amen amen just just pray for us that you finally really bad that you know you you know crabs are something else I mean you know they here here one day they buddies is trying to get out the pot they know what's given to happen in here and it's craft trying to get out that pot but he got his other crafts pulling them right back down into the pot ain't man so let's not pull each other down let's lift each other up alright I want to read a little thought here brother Troy sent this quote to me and I want to just kind of set this up before we go further a man out of pom or locust canker worm caterpillar a man says says now we're coming into a serious thought of subjects here I believe that there will come a time of the restoring the whole things that has been done wrong now I believe that too and now I'm believing it's going beyond we know brother branham's managed to fulfill that we know that but it's going even beyond that right we talk about all things families have fallen apart the restoration of all things right lives a man handed by sicknesses the restoration of all things we believe that right so it says I I believe that there will come a time restoring of all things that has been done wrong and we are trying this is the statement here we are trying with all that is within us and other men are trying such great evangelists as Billy Graham and old Roberts and many other of the outstanding evangelist ministers pastors who a lawyer to their posts are trying to see revival in our time now if they were trying in their turn on the sea revival what about holiday right what should we be doing we should also be trying but if they were trying we also ought to be trying in how're they listen a man sir he says a receiver volatile and you the truth of God are praying for a revival in our time and then we can't keep talking about what God D six to seven hundred years ago we need to talk about what he's doing right now if somebody gotta get started if you suck them right so we're praying amen oh you shouldn't god I pray for revival tens of thousands of prayers meet God every hour for revival in our time and it is written in the scriptures if the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and will pray then I'll hear from heaven now that didn't stop him brother branham's day that that promise is still for us today if we would have said we will hop allow ourselves employees seek the face of God God said he will hear from heaven I am don't let nobody take that promise surely a man this is my generation this is the time I live and I think I mean hearing what God did in the generation past I get faith and then my think it's an order to believe that that that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever and he'll do the same for me what good is of me to share testimonies of God healing people 50 60 years ago when we got sick people right now the reason I share the testimony system nature things to believe that God can do the same thing for you hallelujah rights and receive another cop I'm a man show assuming themselves together will prove them out here from heaven now if the children got out simple assembling themselves together and praying for revival in our time and revival is not coming so wait a minute if we assemble together and we pray for revival in that time we should expect to see God move and if God don't move he said then there must be something wrong somewhere and that's why we had to go through when a couple Friday nights what we went through because we want to know that we want to make sure there's nothing blocking God from hindering amen from blocking God from actually doing what he promised that he would do Amen we want to get everything clean all right I was thinking here say our God is a consuming fire and I my thought is what he did in one generation he will do in the next a man but his his consuming fires to fire to burn up all of our unbelief a man and also his Holy Ghost consuming fires to burn the sin out of our lives Amen hallelujah we required the live holy - not just a mama and all of my call to live holy daddy and all in one call to live holy granddaddy ain't only one call it holy all of us are called a live holy and only way you're gonna live whole is when you got the Holy Ghost Oh blessed be the name of the Lord's so you know what this is our day hey man this is our time this is our generation and and I don't have time to read it all but I know that every generation gets their chance at the revival and you know this is our generation so we're doing all we can to try to bring revival to our generation right in brother branham's day Billy Billy Billy Graham and or Roberts all of them they did everything they could to bring revival in their day so this is our time right and we're trying to bring bring bring revival that the whole thing is about atmosphere right and we have a responsibility to create the right atmosphere a man and here I want to just bring a quote here out of divine love you know if we want to see God do something that we have to put people in the right atmosphere for God to do it a man listen and divine love II says now you've got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it they were all in the upper room with one Accord now you know when God moved in the upper room to notice there was all in one Accord if we try to do this in one pulling this way and one pulling that way and everybody not pulling together we gonna have some trouble but if we can bring the church into one Accord then God gonna like the fire again listen he says now you got to create an atmosphere your faithful do it they were they were all in the upper rooms when a court when suddenly there came from heaven as a sound of a rushing mighty wind the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything it takes an atmosphere to do anything just just breaking that quote down this for a second you know there was another quote I was looking at I didn't bring it here but he said you know if you were trying to set up the atmosphere for a dance and you put a band on the stage and say now now set an atmosphere we want to have a dance and after that if the band went up there and start playing blessed assurance Jesus is mine that right you will look at the band the record said look you ain't creating the right type of atmosphere we said dance not not church service right Amen because see there's 30 atmospheres that go with certain things you know you can't even do certain things until you put yourself in the atmosphere of doing it huh you know you listen that you want people walking down the street with their headphones in they had and and they just dancing looking I mean they look crazy right but but because that person got something in their ears they are in a particular atmosphere that's Romanian and they are responding to the atmosphere the news that creates the atmosphere are you somebody a man so when we come to church which one have the right singer sing songs they help create an atmosphere the world comes in to create an atmosphere and when the atmosphere is created the devil is God amen the devil is cast because our atmosphere healings take place deliverance take place whatever you can have when is the right atmosphere now you have some people that like to help create the atmosphere and then you have others that just like to drain it so you got it you got it which one you gonna be yeah DJ sets the atmosphere all right the DJ he sets the atmosphere he got certain music and he got he got what you call a playlist and some of y'all pairs need to see what y'all kids got in a playlist you want to know why they acted the way they act him it's because of the atmosphere glory to God if they get rid of that and you know oh my god you know if they listen to the words you'll see a different child if they listen to a praise and worship right certain certain music you'll see a different child amen you know atmosphere has you know I'm gonna finish this in second but you know there was a statement made there was these boys I think my four five for sharing a room together and and in the room you know they they all grew up in this room and and and and as one you know get to a certain age you decide I'm going to the Navy and then the second we become of age I'm going to the Navy in a third one I'm going to the Navy all the way down to the fifth boy every board in that family say he was going to the Navy and they tried trying to figure out why did all these boys grow up and want to go to the Navy like this what happened here they went to the vibra house walked into the room where the boys were sleeping and they noticed one picture on the wall and this one picture was a ship in the ocean and that was looked at that every night they went to bed they woke up in the morning they saw the same picture and that picture creative desire but those boss the wallet going beyond the seat so the only way they can get there is by joining the lazy one picture created a desire if a picture of a boat can do that to some Lawrence well put the picture of Jesus Christ hanging in your house to to your children what were the sadness see me and my house we will serve the Lord what will that do to your children you have to learn how to create that much smears hallelujah glory to God daughter do anything anything happen if the atmosphere is right right and what we're trying to do is create atmosphere I can tell you how God moved in my day but you got to experience that same God and I want my kids to experience Lord bless my grandkids I won't didn't experience God so I'm not constantly - the day I die we create an atmosphere all right we'll go from one meeting to the next see the atmosphere and I mean also just mention this I've noticed I have not asked nobody for no money nothing just want your presence but ain't nobody had to give no money all we want you to do is come and create an atmosphere that's so what what now that it's free how many things in this world is free free temp service all right and that wasn't a plug either so don't don't don't don't what feels no conviction on that it was everything is good brother Troy share the testimony how a man gave him some funds so brother Troy took the funds and actually gave it towards the the tent so that's how you do things you passed a blessing alone all right so I'm not actually able to do nothing so please don't don't I don't want to see them brother Jack no don't do that don't do that don't don't do that it's all done this one is taking care now the next one all right let me keep reading yeah I got to get into something here this is says uh the sound of a rushing mighty wind the atmosphere was right it takes atmosphere to do anything oh there was one of the little thing I wanted to add Darris listen to the man talking yesterday and he was telling me how he was he grew up in Zambia Zambia and you can take that down he he grew up in Zambia and while growing up in Zambia he would read magazines that came from America he would see books and things like that that came from America just flooded you know the area and and because of him reading the books from America it put a desire in him that he wanted to become an American citizen and that man would not let go of that dream and that all was birthed from what he was reading right what he was what he was you know the environment that he put himself in and I'm saying it because parents if we put our children in the right environment you'll see certain things get birth in them and let me tell you something just coming to church and gonna be good enough you got to do some things at home right that that's right when we were coming up it was a blessing and our parents sent us off to meetings and ones that they couldn't go to they was cinders but ones that they could go to they took us let me say that again was that they couldn't go to they census was that they could go to they took us my daddy won't even serve in the law but he still took us to meetings and by putting us in atmospheres like that that's where I received the baptism the Holy Ghost right he put me in an atmosphere to get something my daddy took me to it glory to God it changed the board that was in his house you want to see your children change you can have to do something different you got the maker sacrifice you know if they don't if it's not important to you your kids don't see that they will recognize what's important to you your actions demonstrate what's important to you what you spend your money on demonstrates what's important to you you want to know what's important look at a checkbook you already know what's important hallelujah all right let me go home please Holy Ghost amen listen God's but this man you know he was looking at these books and everything and you know he went through great extremes to actually get here to the u.s. he packed his family up I think he had two kids under two years old he was 24 years old he got on us a boat ride for six weeks six weeks and got to Canada and say but that's not good enough I don't want to come to Canada I want to be a US citizen and he kept working for another four or five years in Canada to finally got a job that allowed him to transfer into the US and he became a US citizen now you know what happens is that that man got all that from reading a book he got the inspiration he got everything just from reading a book or reading multiple books about what America was like so and again he was under certain atmosphere and it produced that if it do that thing if it do something like that naturally then what can we do spiritually amen it's one thing to tell our kids to get the Holy Ghost but there's another thing to put them in an atmosphere where they can receive all right lord help us God all right so came us down from heaven or Russia right away in the atmosphere was right it takes an atmosphere to do anything you know the regular procedure to hatch chickens is to put them under the hand but get the egg in the right atmosphere it'll hatch anyhow listen brother if a man loves God and the right kind of an atmosphere he could get into it'll produce a newborn baby just as certain as I'm here it's the atmosphere that cows let this little handful of people sitting here tonight getting perfect at getting the perfect atmosphere watch what takes place amen there will not be a fearful among one in our midst of the cripples we're left if we had the right atmosphere right the blind will see the Deaf will hear the dumb will speak without prayer or anything the atmosphere if the aperture is right people can be here without nobody even laying hands on him people can get delivered from spirits without nobody laying hands on them if the atmosphere is right Oh going to God that's why that's why we take our family's place we're up to a church where we know the right atmosphere is being created a man I don't I don't want to see you keep living and seeing there's one thing that caught us in but don't don't see and see you got to come out of it some kind of way but the only we gonna get out cuz they delegate a struggle in your life I mean if sometimes people really want to be free and they don't know really what to do they they kind of get caught in something and what do I do here all I can take just giving to the right atmosphere and you stir in the right atmosphere God will do what he said you'll do glory to God amen it can happen without prayer amen it's the act must fear it's the atmosphere that's best that's what this whole thing is all about is trying to create the right atmosphere all right all right okay let me just kind of slip over here to a quote at Ephesian Church age I don't even know what time I got started don't know how long I've even been up here man I'm loaded with notes up here now I don't want to weigh out a lot but my whole focus is we want to light the fire again in our it's coming from from this now like I was telling this to brother smile and say you know this is our theme but we want to light the fire again you say that some of them need to light the fire the first time so they can light it again they need to get it lit the first time I said no that's true that's true but I'm pulling my thought from this quote a man I read this and brother Troy called it and he repeated it back to me when he repeated back to my saying that's our theme for the meeting you know so here it is in a Ephesian Church age a paragraph 88 one the Prophet says this it says revelation 2 4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love now and this is a problem in the in the early church that where they left the first love and I can tell you that problems still exist today people have left their first love right and when you leave you leave your first love which should be God right that's when you get trapped into stuff that you should never Gaven got involved with right but but but you know God don't want to leave you there he hasn't he has provisions made for you to come out of that situation that you're in right they may he's a good good father a man a man he's a great father glory to God he's not like a earthly father the earthly father get disappointed in just old man just forget about it but not God gotta be right there with you right through thick and thin already knowing what she was gonna do and then he he'd just be waiting to just kind throw his arms around you as soon as you read it for him he ready for you and I'ma tell you can go thousands of miles to get away from him but when you make one turn towards him do you realize you only got to make one step and he's right there and you might have taken a thousand steps from him but as you go he's following you he's just walking with you and he's watching over you even and you'll see him he don't want you to die like that you could have died many a times but but he's watched over you but no no don't touch him I know dance they say they love me yet but you came touching right you can't you came to this you cannot know you came to it and he just wait for you to make that turn soon and make your turn he right there with open arms ready to embrace you oh what a glorious father we have he says nevertheless I have somewhat against it because I was left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the Spirit is not speaking to the original saints of Ephesus alone right he says this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and the third generation embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame see that and that's if we're if we're honest with ourselves that's exactly where we are right so you know brother Branham comes on the scene and and you know different things happen in his ministry I've been reading the book here brother Peregrine about Acts of the Prophet and he's sharing testimonies of just things that he went through the things that he was an eyewitness of and want one particular situation the Prophet told this one brother that was manager of setting up his meeting say now when you do put me in a hotel where the people don't know where I'm at because I won't get no sleep at all because once the people find out where I'm at they'll be coming to the room trying to actual prayer and I won't get in sleep so put me in it put me in a room where nobody knows where I met nobody he said the only person you let know where I met is maybe the pastor that's that's helping the sponsor to meetings he said okay we'll do that so you know and and the brother had you know set up the hotel and he told the pastor and it's in our brother brand I'm gonna call you when he's coming and that way you can meet him at the hotel and everything like that so they they go through the evening and no call and they get all the way late in the night and no call all right Wow you know we expected him to call maybe he's not coming so you know maybe something is not right or whatever so I said well we'll just you know going up to the hotel and everything and they got to the hotel in the hotel attendants area Reverend Branham checked in hours ago now he never been to this city how do you know what hotel that we were in right and and and brother peregrym mayor Greene beginning to realize this man is a prophet God would show him the exact hotel where the reservation was without nobody telling him where it was and he would go check in now how many people you know can do that right I mean God will reveal things to him he said he said I just had a way of just knowing things it was God showing everything God showed that prophet right I mean you know we're not playing games here when we talk about a prophet right I mean I mean if you just read you know again this is atmosphere if if you got into the same atmosphere then I put myself in what I did when I first heard this message I actually went to start reading about his life story I read that for myself right I rather than take what the internet see it I read I read his personal testimony of his life who better can tell you about they life than the person that's living it how you gonna tell me about my wife right it's gonna make no sense right but but you know here I read his own person just when I began to just be sum of things until when you listen to other people that was their texture five pounds like there's something to this there's a lot more to this than what people saying it's just scarecrows out there all right but you know but but here you know as as we look at it you know brother brother Peregrine would come and as I'm reading a book man so many other things that he shared you know you know weren't one of these things that I was just reading this week you know over an and and and and in Luke 4 there was a scripture and I mean I read this real quick I mean I wasn't planning on saying this but the Holy Spirit know all things but Luke look for a man is something that I'll read here we had a word prophet the word prophet now I got to try to read this real quick if I can't Luke 4 verse 16 and it came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for the read now the first thing I want you to understand and say it was Jesus custom to go to church hello I'm gonna say that again it was Jesus custom to go to church and and you think you gonna get by with just half half half way attendant things Jesus custom let's go to church right there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when they had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and notice verse 20 and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day the scripture fulfilled in your ears now there was something significant that happened in brother branham's ministry if you notice here that was looked for but he said he opened to isaiah so let's go over here as a a' chapter 60 I believe Amen let's read something in there and there's a couple things that happened Jesus read to a certain part in the Book of Isaiah and they closed the book and said this day the scriptures were filled now 61 Azir 61 Jesus was reading Isaiah 61 when it when he said that another Peregrine happened to be in a service one day and brother Branham preached a message on birth pains and when he went to preach this sermon on birth pains he was actually showing how this was going to be a time of vengeance you know that God was going to be pouring out his wrath upon the people for their sand and things like that and you know but he said the only safe place that you could find is in Christ now before brother Branham preaches discernment in birth pains what happened as he was going to church his wife had just bought him a gift bought him a new Bible and now he had never used this Bible before he just grabbed it you know kind of off the shelf and just took off running the church out real fast and never used the Bible once before God the church opened up his scripture reading that morning and and as we began to read the scripture he knew what the verse said but somehow the the pages were stuck together and he couldn't read you know what wait what he wanted to read it was just like meant something wrong and he say he was looking so you know he just didn't understand what was going on so there was a bunch of Ministers on the platform that day and as they were they were all sitting there you know on the platform only one decided to get up and give brother Branham his Bobby say my brother's ain't such a set written in this particular chapter he said well how come I don't see it in my Bobby he didn't realize the pages were stuck together so a Catholic priests and his Catholic guard got up and say hey hold steady young man God is doing something he say read it out of my Bible like Catholic priests gave him the Bible now I want you to stay with me on this because Jesus when he went to the temple it was the priests that gave him the Bible and he picked it up and he began to read Isaiah 61 but he got to a certain spot and I said 61 and he stopped now watch this here in Isaiah 61 a man the spirit of Lord God is upon me because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound now watch this to proclaim the acceptable be able or it now if you go back to Luke 4 you'll see Jesus stop right there where it said it's the priest except we'll be in the Lord but notice what Isaiah prophesied and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn now Isaiah prophesized that Amen somebody is going to Brooklyn the chapel year of the Lord and the day of vengeance so here when the Catholic priest gives brother Branham the book and he preaches on birth pangs he is actually fulfilling the second part of description that's why the Catholic priests had to be the one oh my when I thought about it you know God ordained that name to grow up in a house to learn Catholic traditions that he would become a Catholic priest someday dress in the GAR woke up and give the Papa the Bible God predestinated that man to be there to do that and honor for the rest of the scripture the people feel you go back to listen to birthdays just see it was all right there and you know we you know I hate to see that people falling out over simple things but we had a prophet come and and fulfill Scripture you know and you know brother Peregrine sharing all these things I began to think about him being a part of a particular generation but God has called him off the scene now the testimony that he shared it certainly impacted my generation I'd be what we call third generation right I'm one of them in the third generation I just believe this I might not have experienced all the things that they experienced but I yet believe it but something's happened in the fourth generation we just got in verse now we got a few that believe it but there has never been an onslaught against the generation of people then the generation that's on the earth today and this is why this quote means so much to me when we go back here Ephesian Church age again it says in the generations of Israel we see revived in one generation only to see the fire fading in the next and the third generation ampers maybe glowing slightly we're trying to create atmospheres hey man we don't want just involute wanted to be on fire right Amber's maybe going blowing slightly but in the fall there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and if that's not where we are are you telling me where we are there might be no vestige amen whatsoever of that original frame people don't even believe that sent a prophet no more no mass niche of the original flame that's just three or four generations removed right but the quote don't stop there even when it gets in that condition the quote goes on it says then God lights the fire again and that's where we are Church they're trying to see God the fire again in the past inhalation let God like the fire team let that destroy his people again oh my you know you go back and look at Joel's prophecy it was four stages there's four stages of the same bug but after that fourth stage guys say I will restore sayeth the Lord the Palmer arm the King corner of the caterpillar locust four stages of the same bug but God promised to restore so I'm not leaving them where they are I'm just showing you where we are but we're expecting God to light the fire again let me finish reading the quote now I'll go into the scripture and I'll let you go here today alright says then God likes to fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural burp just because you was born in this message don't mean nothing you still have to have a personal experience with Jesus Christ your mama was brought you up in it your daddy brought you up into it but you ain't had a personal experience with Christ you've had an intellectual experience but we talk about a personal experience alright this is says it is a simply a manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more then there is any truth to apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along they are no longer just playing Christians but they are taking a denominational name and are now Baptists Methodists that is exactly what they are - they are not Christians you have to be born on the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down and they are not the same anymore so now that takes us over here to Joshua if we could just look at that again I'm sorry judges we were in the book of Judges and now so brother Branham brought out that this this this this thing happened in Israel revival on one generation only to see the fires fading in the next generation so it happened in Israel and we're picking this up here in the book of Judges notice this verse 7 says and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua ok let's keep going they serve the Lord all the days of City have respect for him right they knew God was with him right and as long as Joshua was living and knowledge oshawa but notice this says the people say the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived asura so all the people that was along in Joshua's generation the Caleb's that was there they serve the Lord because they understood what God did for them and that thought went with that in place and then they have respect for these men so it's very easy for them to serve the Lord but God don't have grandchildren they never had a personal experience look at this he said he says so and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who ain't seen oh my god when they seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel now these are the people that experienced Donovan in a particular way so they were convinced ain't no way you would have been able to tell Peregrine that God didn't sent a prophet this man in a hotel room and I made room reservations and say he'll call me when he get here hey give me any good hotel if I'm at the man the Lord he checked him for hours ain't no way you're gonna tell him that God did send a prophet way too many experiences like that for him not to believe he's going to take a lot more than a bridge it's gonna take a lot more than that to shake a man like him and that's why you didn't see this book released in that thing they waited to these people that [Music] didn't hit the earth but while they were here nobody had no questions but because they see a intellectual birthday don't get it people got to have an experience with God here we gotta have a true Holy Ghost experience and not just one you need to be put by mean the rain falls off I'm totally nervous every time we come together we ought to be entering in man I tell you I feel like preaching I feel like preaching I heard I heard this guy last night you know he was preaching about the the word praise and he said in the Book of Psalms the word praise has seven different Hebrew meanings and boy he started going through the Mina's and told on and whatever the other ones was I can't even think but I'm gonna have to go get at him and preach it myself right but up but I think the total was the extension of the hands and they say say when you extend your hands and praise that's not only just praise him for what he done but a totai praise was appraised to thank God for what he was getting ready to do and some of us need ourselves a total please stop letting the devil drown your fire and then you need to just keep pace already para to all that the father's giving me real or etekaaf say you the truth now I'm gonna hear that lumber probably bring it bring a whole series on Friday nights amen on them seven Hebrew names appraised and what they what they what they mean and I know that the the the the nominal church world probably been preaching it for years that's all they can they can't read these quotes that's all they got but I can take that and add a little bit more to it all right praise the Lord a man he read in the scripture that's what I want to try to just make this picture plain to you a man so here we're looking at them and and and that he's that here's the children of Israel and verse 70 or judges to the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel right and Lotus dose notice this and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being a hundred and ten years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath harris and the amount of ephraim on the north side of the hill - now now had they come up with anything in Joshua's dave Joshua would have sniffed that thing I said no no no no I remember when God did this for Moses and I remember when God said this I was there you can't tell me nothing right but when Josh was off the scene they don't have anybody tech that can respond like that that's why the devil waited to these warriors a man these generals went off to sing in order to release this attack on the bride listen look look at what happened in verse 10 and also all that generation would gather to their father so here we talk about Joshua is gone and now the elders are going the ones that outlive Joshua's now they're going look and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there are rules another generation after them listen which knew not the Lord what a powerful statement some of them think they know God but they knew not the Lord and not only that yet the works which he had done for Israel so since they had not experienced God the way the former generation had experienced God they were not able to hold to the word you know let me just tell you you know the first generation would have been Moses time and in Moses time just think about all the people and what they were what they would have experienced you know you know Moses no mass Jehovah Moses you know and no investor hope it means that he was Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God so Moses had the ability to the call for different things and the power to bind and loose he lure mastery over they that generation saw the the rod of Moses turning to a snake and then not only that they saw Moses snake eat the snakes of Janus and Jambres not now I want you to understand that this from what my understanding from my just my little research I could be wrong on this but my little research that I did I found out that there was only one snake that actually eat other snakes and then and this happened to be you know a king cobra a king cobra will eat any other cobra right any other state a king cobra will do that he'll eat regular Cobras if you have to right but but but some what I realize is that maybe Janus and Jambres around some cobras but Moses God gave Moses a king cobra they - no codebase but Moses had a king cobra and that's where that king cobra eat up the other Cobras and Moses just reached out and picked them up anybody else is afraid of a cobra snake that's why you go back to your read the book of Exodus when Moses first tear down the road and saw that thing turn into a snake that's not a snake a king cobra lonely start running but God took that fear out of Moses walk that man took such a brother - you touch him by the tail and watch watch what happened had to walk by faith touched him by the tail and he went back to stick lord have mercy he probably said lord please don't make me do that memo but when they got down there when they got down there to Egypt you know that rot you would undid this before throw it down there and Moses might not have known what he had he probably know he had a king cobra sometimes you don't realize what you got what do you got you got the King of Kings and the moses wrought turned into that snake and that snake ate the snakes of Janice and Jane Janice and Jane breeze that generation saw water turned into blood for seven days that generation saw frogs come out of nowhere because Moses called for it they saw lights come out of nowhere because Moses called for then they saw flies come a man from nowhere because Moses come for that when it sort of flies they recognize that the Flies was only in Egypt but not in Goshen right when the plague on the cattle that was only in Egypt but not in Goshen and when Moses come for the plague of cattle the Bible actually tells us that the Lord did the thing it's so bad they say hey there so locusts there's no darkness in Egypt for three days watch them threes but in question there was light right and finally saw the death to the firstborn if the token had not been applied to that house now with all these miracles they couldn't help but believe God in that generation but it didn't stop there they experienced the opening of the Red Sea they crossed on dry land they rejoiced after they saw the Egyptian army drowned you talk about a shout in good time they had a Pentecostal Jew bees and I'ma tell you when you see your enemies drown you ought to let out a shout [Music] while they were in the in the wilderness they were provided manna and water from a rock how does water come out of a rock these are the things that these people experience but they all dive in the wilderness because of their unbelief their parents that was born in the wilderness underneath Joshua's leadership were the ones that went into the Promised Land they knew of Joshua's experience with the capture of the hosts the same way that Moses met a man the the met God at the burning bush a man and he heard you know I am that I am and sending you you know and I come down deliver my people and take off his shoes because the ground your own is holy ground Joshua had the same experience but this time what was in the bush the pillar fire that was in the bush became a man and Joshua saw him as a man as the captain hosts and was told the same thing take off your shoes you're on the holy ground they crossed the Jordan just like they pairs across the Red Sea and they experienced the parting of the water right they saw the walls of Jericho come down after marching around for seven days and and then letting out that great shout right they possessed the land through many battles and only lost 36 men after a can fill to obey the Word of God he stole the clothing and he stole the money during the fall of the wall but this fourth generation this third fourth generation this is you know the ones that starting to have problems and this is why the Bible is showing us here that you know after after Joshua had died and after the ones that outlive Joshua now we see a group coming home that don't know the Lord neither the works which he had done for Israel they were all being worn by a painted fire but they had not experienced their own personal fire and let me tell you cannot get warm by a painted fire can I go in a little further here now there were others in that day even though the majority of that pulled away they were still some that still holding on to the truth and this is why you see people like Anthony I'll become the first judge in Israel you know I feel was the guy that actually went to take the mountain amen when Caleb said you know you know he said give me this mountain well say well I need somebody to go up there fight with me and obviously I'll take her Jeff Seifer I believe it was yeah I'll take her Jeff Seifer and he received Caleb's daughter as his wife you know it was off me of the nephew of Caleb right at that point in time which showed that it had to be a kinsman redeemer I can't preach all that right now but maybe one day I bring that sermon back around the y'all but I opted Amir was still holding on to the word during that time okay so now let's pick up here and see I just wanted to show you just a load of something here Amen and then we'll try to let it go but over here and and judges 2 and verse 10 again and also all of that generation were gathered unto their fathers and their rows another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel since they did not know the works of what God had done watch what happens to them and the children Israel did evil in the sight allure and served Balaam and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of land of Egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were what the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to anger now what I want you to see is that this generation this 4th generation is the generation that went back into bondage however is a different type of bondage they're not in the bondage of their grant they're great they're great grandparents that was coming out of Egypt that was a physical bondage now they have gone into spiritual bondage because they're no longer serving god they're serving bail now can I go a little further now by serving bail it's still Mickey religious it still make you go to church right you still do all the all the other things that that everybody else do you you still play the music you still like brother brother brother brother Henry told us you get your praise on you still do all that right but you're serving a different gods and don't realize it you've compromised Maria you didn't contain and now because there was no containment we got people that's bound with spiritual leprosy because you didn't take it through the proper channels I was saying this with brother smiley yesterday we almost had another true belief you know that the Levites were actually on a day to be able to come in contact with leprosy and not get sick only the Levites could do that anybody else that came in contact with leprosy they would get sick that's why I had to be handled by the pastor they could they could they could pronounce this and pronounce that deal to all the ones that can come in contact with leprosy hallelujah but when we got everybody else that they're trying to answer questions that's why we get problems I'm gonna tell you if we do things the right way we won't have a lot of sick people and don't you think it's the reason why your family won't come to me it's not because I'm that meaning I mean I know I'm not that mean I can be hard and I have to be that way to be a leader I have to be that way other I spoke just run right over you but you got to say things a certain way some time in order to you're dealing with spirits not people's spirits right and I've been fighting an intellectual spirit for years I've been trying you you didn't got it yet you got it you got it intellectually but when you get it really a few relationships something gonna change how do I know that because some changed in me and it so they serving Balaam and notice what the scripture was telling us here they begin to follow other guys other gods or the people that were round about them so this church got something going on here we serving what they doing oh come on y'all y'all like y'all and preach would we eat laughs yeah you know you ain't never gree with none of that before but now all of a sudden you just eaten it all up if this ain't a repeat of what happened in scripture see things don't happen just to be happening you can place these things right back in the words look at it say the sort of so they begin to follow other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them I need you to understand something even though they bound themselves to these false gods they are still the children of Israel they're still God's children and at some point in time God got to bring them out of the circumstance that they're here what is he doing when he brings them out what do you think he's doing lighting lighting the fire again can I just finish reading and follow other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them have provoked the other to anger nada you know I was sharing this with a brother you know Paul said if they preach to you another Jesus why would he put words like that ain't another Jesus I thought there's only one Jesus but why would Paul say they preaching another Jesus as you know the dark denominations they can they can priest Jesus that went to Calvary but can we preach about the Jesus that got up and start doing some stuff after Calvary because if you've missed the rest of the New Testament it didn't stop with just the four Gospels you got to get over the revelation now and can you preach from that open book right all right let's keep going and and and they look verse 13 says and they forsook the Lord and served a land Astra the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he delivered them into the hands of the spoilers that's for them and sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not not any longer stand before the enemies now I want you to understand something else as we read this God allow unwanted circumstances to put the people in a place where would bring them back to where they were supposed to be let me also say this don't pray that God sent I'm one of the circumstances to don't pray that now the reason I'm telling you don't pray it because these are your people and whatever they go through you gonna be feeling it too so your prayer is not God send them through it your friend like God helped me to endure what you're getting ready to do but see what happened here in scripture I mean even often to them I feel and and all the others that were holding on they were still impacted by what the people is going through here but God kept him alright little further and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before the enemies with a sort of they went out the handle look was against them for evil as the Lord has said and as the Lord has sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed greatly distress my god you know you have a family they got multiple cars hey everybody go on a different way to go to church but what God does is start this car goes down this car goes down this car goes down that we got one car and that car goes to a particular church that car goes to a particular church I would say that again that car is ordained to go through a particular Church you say you want to go to church this car will not take you to another church y'all think I'm crazy but I'm gonna tell metell your test for a second this car can't go to another Church if I try to go to another Church in a turn on me if y'all don't believe me I wish brother Mike was here brother Mike to tell y'all he was trying to go to church and they got to a certain street and conviction just fell on them he had to turn and go down the street to where spirit and truth was you see the sign on the front his gospel truth tabernacle that Cobb alone and spirit and truth that man so ain't no system he's trying to go nowhere else now you say you want to go to church can i actual a question I make sure I'm gonna just ask a question I'm trying to get out of here I'm trying why is it that if you were invited to go to church you would actually have no problem going with people today Church you could you would take them and some kind of sometimes enjoy yourself a little bit but as soon as you invite them to your church here you ought to see the spirit that come off of them why is that that oughta let you know right Dean I'm dealing with a spirit right I can go with you but you can't go with me what will you tell me what's the matter with my church will you tell me cuz I know how to affected my life so you tell me what's the matter with my church all right my car's ordained my mind is ordained and I think I'd get in trouble if I've tried to go somewhere else no no I'm ordained I might go visit but I ain't coming to state and you know what a visit is that's like one week at most two weeks but after that I'm done I got to go back the way to food is I'm hungry all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right okay all right I wanted to read just maybe just one more quote if maybe let's see what I got here to that there's a lot here two quotes one is going to come out of the resurrection I want to read this because the Prophet actually said it right here in West Palm Beach I thought it was be appropriate on this this is out of the message the resurrection and then I got one more than it will let it go he says see I don't want to blame you people is to pull this where it started no wonder that's the damnation of the country when Satan's got in the pulpit it's the truth failing to preach the unadulterated Word of God and the Word of God will produce just exactly what it said it would do but we explain it all the way it's all a way it's for some other day so when people even talk about attempt you know us doing a tenth we explain it all the way I don't want nobody explaining what God's they do what we're doing it to all right a man and if once if one soul come out it was worth it all I mean you don't you don't control how God reaches people and man I mean been on that Main Street coming down I'm praying for in it little you don't know who passing through there hey man we're doing everything we can to see God moving our day okay since could you imagine some understanding at the platform saying baptism of the Holy Ghost divine healing that's for another day said it's like trying to introduce a man freezing to death and paint some five for him and say there's a fire fire that's what was you came worn by a painted fire that was fire one time but what about fire now right Holy Ghost had power at Pentecost through the first Age second agent on down what about this H he's the same holder goes today the same power the same signs of saying one does the same miracles if he can get the same kind of faith amongst the people God doesn't change now I I passed something here today only because the account of time but I heard you know system engineer that when you invite somebody to come to your church they come up with all kind of excuses I want to give you all a man just a little homework assignment a man you can kind of get in a channel where I was but there's a verse a man Luke 14 verse 15 through 24 you'll read a man in that particular passage of I won't have time to read it right now but you realize how Jesus gave I've talked about a parable of a man given an invitation to bring people to the marriage supper a man to a great supper that the King had had produced but as he gave the invitation all the people began to come up with all kind of excuses as to why they could not come to the supper oh my and I'm glad the Lord brought this back because brother Branham said that in the days of Moses they gave excuses in the days of Jesus they gave excuses in the days of Noah they gave excuses he says that even today they give an excuses and what that means is that somebody gonna say well I can't come to the tent because that's an excuse and let me tell you something excuses only satisfied the person that's making them praise the Lord we got two nights pick one at least one that you can come and be a part of the services praise a lot just pick one right but don't come with excuses and no to think the other thing that I wanted to read is you know I'll get to get you there there was three pools inside that chapter inside that it's not that pastor scriptures he went you know first to try to get them all you know get them all to come the ones that were invited they wouldn't come then he went to you know the ones that was sick but the RAM said it was a divine healing took place right in order to try to fool the people and then finally what he did because they wouldn't come they begin to make excuses too he said finally the last thing that happened he said go to the hedges the highways of highways and invite anybody and that's exactly what the brothers did they went right out there with with tracts and they hand or in vacations and invited anybody we're in the word that's what Jesus told us to do we're trying to get people to come on invitation but somebody has to give the invitation alright one last quote here Christ identified the same in all generations no no that's not right hold on that's not right hold on a second Oh yes yes that is right Christ identified the same in all generations look at this it says so this week this is my last quote and I want to leave this Amen over the church this week the rest of this week let's put our faith up there like really Abraham seat like we're supposed to be let's believe God right and then we'll pray for the sick and do everything we can to help alone and when we leave we trust that there would be an old-fashioned revival through this country here that people will be swarming in from everywhere jam up these churches and so forth for an old-fashioned revival we just passed through a great revival last fifteen sixteen years we've had great leaders as all its broke all history records as far as I know history usually a revival lasts about three years but this has gone on for many years and now the revival fires are quieting down the enthusiasm of the people is dying off and you can see it in the old Temple of Vesta in Rome when the fires went out the people went home but we're trying to rebuild these fires again on every Hill that we can I cannot do it no minister can it takes all of us together and prayer and believing and trusting God to see the Holy Spirit continue to bless his people as we wait on his coming see there is questions you know and questions and answers and you know people asking questions about why don't we see God moving the way that he used to move you know they were someone asked a question what what seems to be wrong in the day that we're living in being a believer in following the message and the messenger of today when you cannot seem to pray pray like you would like to brother branham said it's because the revival fires has gone out that was his answer and then in that same questions and answers it said it seems among ministers of the word that we have little or no burden to pray to preach too fast for lost souls that might still be out there somewhere in the world would you please tell us what to do about this condition thank you very much brother random for this and this answer you know to that says preachers a minister don't have burden burdens for lost souls I believe it's lacking of the revival I believe we should still try to pray to God to give us passion the lost souls until Jesus comes well we're gonna do our part and this is part of what we do like the fire again god bless you amen [Applause] have a word of Prayer there God we are grateful for what the Holy Spirit is doing in this hour where we know that you're at at work we know that you're moving in God as a church we are trying to follow as close as we possibly can we don't want to get too far in front of you I certainly don't want to be too far behind you we want to be in position where we can see you move and we can enjoy everything that you do so God as we prepare for this week first of all I pray that you bring all of us into one heart into one mind into one Accord if there are any excuses that we have Lord let us push those things to the side and let us not use the same old thing God understands God if this doesn't happen that often we don't do these things that often some of the ones here should be sharing the testimonies of what you've done for them and if sometimes Satan to put so much in their path that they can't do what you call them to do we read in Sunday school that each one has a ministry each one have something that they need to do it's not just the past it's not just the worship leaders but everybody got something that they're supposed to be doing god help you people find that help help them to find that and Lord if they came to nothing else they can tell people of goodness and the grace and the mercy that they have experienced the Lord as we prepare to go out Lord to okeechobee God we believe that you've already gone before us we've hearing testimonies already of what you've already done we don't know who walked through that place but let us be spiritual help us to be wise and the way that we handle and conduct ourselves out there Lord let us let us not be clannish when we go but let us look for opportunity we can be a witness to somebody Lord let us seek out that hey let us go through this week just praying and fasting and just meditating on what we're getting ready to do and and Lord the way we feel that you're the same God that that left a revival went across the sea a stormy sea just to get one soul because that one soul was worth more Lord than there's so many worlds and God that's the way that we feel today one soul is worth more than a thousand Lord worlds so god help us to be obedient amen to the Spirit of God and let us give our all we've only gone as far as we can because we have not been willing to give more of ourselves so Lord if there's more to surrender help us to surrender that even on today God continue to deal with our hearts continue to minister to our needs and while labor head is bowed I want to miss an opportunity there's some here even in our myths that do not know Jesus the way that you should know Jesus and you want to acknowledge in this presence that you need them I just want you to lift your hands wherever head is bowed I want to pray for you one thing before we go and do anything we got to get to stand out from amongst ourselves the devil can be exposed in you if you're not clean if you're not pure before God there's something in your life that's hindering you from having true relationship with God I just want you to lift your hand right where you are I'm not going to ask you to do any more than lift your hand I just want you to be honest and the presence of the Lord that Lord I'm not I'm not where I need to be but I want to get there Bible says repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost as promises unto you your children those are the father's many if the Lord I got your call if the Holy Spirit is still with your heart today just slip your hand right where you are throw the jack I'm not where I need to be and I want it I want to get things right with God today I don't want to leave this place knowing that my heart is not right this might be your last chance if your hand right where you are God sees their hands God sees the hands I'm gonna pray for you while your hand is lifted in this presence I just want you to also pray along with me and your hardened and I believe God would meet you and just do the thing that he need to do in your heart today father I just felt checked in my spirit just to make sure Lord that the Saints were properly prepared there's one thing that go minister to a community out there God but when we fail to minister to the people that are right here and I miss then we're missing it God today you spoke and Lord for the past few weeks you've been speaking God so Lord Jesus I'm asking that you would Lord that you would uh you would you would see the hands that are lifted underneath that hand is a heart God that needs you and then father my prayer is that you would meet them right now right where they are that Lord you would come down with your presence and that you would show them that you have forgiven them for whatever it is that they're asking you for forgiveness for that you got will cleanse them that you approach them that you would make them whole God I prayed it to remove by your spirit upon each one Jesus Oh God don't let him leave here with the burden of standing anymore but may they leave knowing that Christ has sent them free Oh God father I pray that you would do the work that only you can do in every life we thank you Lord for these trophies of your grace from the word that has been shared here today God in them made you like the fire

explanation or this fourth generation how they are being attacked and all Lord God we just pray Oh God you know like the fire again in Lord father we need that all that first morning of the Holy Ghost law of God or the fire would go out so we ask an O God even now that you would grant a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord God that when you like that fire again Lord God our souls will burn in such a way North that will burn it to the coming of the Lord and father as the prophet of God prayed in the message of the indictment Lord God he prayed for a revival of the Justin he said Lord God that is not easy to pray for because you promised you promised the revival once again in the land before your coming Lord you're gonna like the fire once more Lord and father we're ready River we're preparing
