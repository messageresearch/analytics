all right it's all right certainly disapproval Lord Jesus this morning a man my God my God my God you get into little grooves like that you just want to state anything become a concert a man on Sunday morning you know what one day we're gonna enter into a place like that where it just gonna be singing and you know just just worship eternally a man the gospel won't need to be preached in and won't because everybody there already be saved all right so then we just so we did worship just worship I go see somebody bumping say let me get a little party to happen just alright let me get a little party that right we just we just gonna enjoy ourselves in Jesus Amen I want to read a man from two portions of Scripture today one found in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 a man 2nd Timothy chapter 3 in verse 16 and then the other will be found in Exodus 14 to short passages but I trusted the Lord help us to bring a manís thought together 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness a man so all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness and let's just go over to Exodus 14 we man Lord Amen Exodus 14 and just reading here Amen verse 13 starting at verse 13 I'm sorry yeah yeah verse 13 says it Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever when verse 14 says this the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace man praise the Lord hey man just tell us about the Lord gonna fight for you just have a word of Prayer father how grateful we are for your word it's inspiring to us it strengthens us it helps us wherever we are whatever things that we are facing the word has a way of speaking to our conditions Lord we pray that you would speak this morning to every need we take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost and we trust Oh God that uh that you would just take control of every thought help us to Center our thoughts around what we've just read as we send our thoughts around that we gain inspiration to change the situations that we are involved in we go to work we go to school we go to all these places God and just devil is attacking us on every side but God would come here to the house of the Lord to give him to your presence so we can get something fresh a man to overcome the enemy so speak father and only a way that you can today's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can seated a man those scriptures a man can just be preached from so many different angles especially as we read there from 2nd Timothy 3:16 a man tell us that all Scripture is given a man by inspiration and the inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness various things can be said there but I want to just take for our subject today just a word inspiration a man inspiration just want to just want to use that and I'm pulling from a quote here that I read some time ago and just been holding amen this dear to my heart out of the message here you him the Prophet makes a statement here and here you him and he says now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired Word says the two inspirations together gives a result so it's one thing a man for you to be inspired hallelujah amen but if you're inspired without the word there won't be a result come on somebody amen and it's another thing we already know the scripture is inspired because all scripture amen is given by the inspiration of God so God not write things just to be writing things he's trying to inspire you so what the Prophet assumes that when your inspiration comes in contact with the scriptures inspiration then we'll see some results hey man he says now when a man and when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired Word the two inspirations together gives a result now no matter how well you study the word it never do you know good till your inspire yourself it takes your inspiration the words already inspired any man he goes on a little further says so what we need today it's an inspiration over us I believe that what we need today is an inspiration you want to see some things change you want to see some things fixed a man what you gonna need today is a new inspiration a fresh inspiration coming from the Word of God to change your situation come on somebody look at this he says it says I'm not sure what we nee today's an inspiration over us God sweeping down with the new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might inspire us to quicken and waken us to his words hallelujah I like that we want to be quickened to the word and then the word being brought into that spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two just come together and he goes we're saying brother Joseph I just saw just printed a message that I was preaching a three-sport on the Dove and the lamb many of us has read it how that only two that could get along with the Dove was the weakest of all the birds of heaven and the lamb was the weakest of all the animals on the earth and the Dove could not come and abide upon a wolf it could not abide upon nature because her nature was different and she could only about weather nature was the same as her so now he's talking about a man these two inspirations and how we got to get your inspiration connected with God's inspiration then we'll see some results now I looked at I looked at a word here just just kind of looking up this word inspiration it's the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something especially to do something creative listen the it's racist the process of being mentally stimulated Amen because you got to understand that before you see anything in the natural you have to first see it in the spiritual hallelujah and oftentimes Amen for you to grab a hold of something in faith you're gonna have to catch it in the spirit realm hallelujah you're gonna have to be mentally stimulated glory to God that mean you got to catch inspiration do you realize before the seat that you can sit in a man was made somebody caught inspiration they were inspired to put four legs amen oh no on the bottom and and then maybe maybe I they started just with the four legs on the bottom so now we don't need something to rest our back on the DNA made something for the back to support the back somebody was inspired amen to create that seat God gave them that inspiration hallelujah Amen before anything takes place in amen the physical realm it has to come through inspiration the Prophet makes a statement a man it says let me just see if I can find all real has to come through inspiration I want you to catch that all real has to come by inspiration all real everything you see that's real it came by inspiration now let's go on and look at this or again inspiration is the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something especially to do something creative now when we look at the universe we see the inspiration of God right when you just look at there's the moon and the stars and a man galaxies and planets and you know and everything it's all the inspiration of God that's just very earth that we live on is the inspiration of God man God saw when he looked at the earth the Bible says that it was null it was void said darkness was upon the face of the deep in man and pretty much when when when I when I look at that scripture I can say when God looked at the earth he saw nothing hallelujah he saw nothing a man but but because of inspiration he turned nothing into something whoa hallelujah all real comes by inspiration so if God had that quality in him where he can turn nothing into something and he has made you a son and a daughter of God then the same team that was in God has been passed down to you and you're gonna have to catch things by inspiration before we saw like God was inspired to call for light hallelujah amen he said let there be and there was a man his design of the galaxies the Stars the plans to put them all in their places he meant all that was done by inspiration man was made in the image of God amen by inspiration hallelujah hallelujah and I want you to I want you to kind of catch something today because I want to speak to a man gesture and maybe to your personal situations that you might be going through businesses are started because of inspiration books are written because of inspiration songs are written because of inspiration and not only are songs written because of inspiration but songs conozco also be same because of inspiration hallelujah it's not just getting up singing whatever hallelujah but but when a person is inspired to sing a particular song at a particular site at a particular time you will you begin to see not only that's that inspiration flow through them but it begins to flow to others my god because even when one person is inspired through through inspire preached hidden you can be delivered hallelujah through an inspired song you can be set free they made inspiration will feed more inspiration amen lives of change because of inspiration but it's not just any old type of it's rich it's your inspiration being connected with God's inspiration it will produce a result I love this see businesses are started because of inspiration books are written because of inspiration songs are written and sing because of inspiration poems are written by inspiration buildings and houses and bridges are meet because of inspiration I like this right you know I mean if you're not under inspiration when you're doing something it turn out it's a flop have any I'll ever track now I'll be honest I tried to write songs you know and I you know you think these words go together and you just start putting them on paper and then you you know you look at it later on like what in the world was I writing see where was no inspiration Oh hallelujah amen you can do a lot of things and without inspiration specially a godly inspiration you'll get nothing from it no resource at all but when you connect that thing to the Word of God you'll see great things happen connect your business to God's Word hallelujah connect your business to God amen whatever you do in word of doody word or deed do it all for the glory of God once god bless your business hallelujah not because everybody else doing that because God gave you the idea God inspired you amen no matter how many other folk out there doing it if God has spiars you and you step by own God's inspiration you will see things coming to pass hallelujah all right all right all right Amen I was looking at Amen a look look look quote here from it wasn't so from the beginning and you know even as ministers we get inspiration from one from the other right I listen to another preacher preach and I start writing notes any I know something they don't do that number we used to when we go to church we take not only our Bible we have one of these right we take this to church with us and we have a pen with us and when something is spoken by inspiration we write it down you know because when you're in the channel that's the only time you're gonna receive right but when you get out of the channel Amen you need to go back to read what was given to you why you was in the channel hallelujah Amen so you got to learn to take notes some us a smart like that we just remember all kind of things but you got to learn to take notes when you're underneath inspiration because that's gonna feed you one day that's gonna help you through some situation one day when you go back and just look in that notebook of all these look thoughts of inspiration hallelujah amen one little doctor really can lead to Whoopi written one more thought can lead to song being written one little thought can change situations it's racing a very powerful thing the Prophet was in church one time and I won't try to catch this we're gonna read something here a man he was in church and he made a comment here in this message it was a it was it was it wasn't so for them again he said that's right you can always tell a Christian many of course are women not with manicure ever what's tough is they wear not wearing that but I mean you can tell it otherwise they're just marked and a Christian has an atmosphere because though he is a son and a daughter of God he is a creator a Christian has an atmosphere though he is a son a daughter of god he is a creator look at this ever who that little fellow us teach them Sunday School there this morning I sure appreciate that message not brother branham in a church listening to a brother teach Sunday School and it says he was alright I liked it he says you the brother well right here well that's fine you formally must have must have been a Baptist because I could tell the way you was talking it kind of it kind of puts a little mark back there but will outlive her he's joking with him there says you see now now Baptist brother would just kindly wanted to teach she want 131 to each other but it cuz but but when he said the expression that he made I jotted it down on a piece of paper so the Prophet taking notes why he in Sunday school all right hallelujah the promise say shut it down on a piece of paper now watch what this brother said I'll pick it up out in the office there - I'm impotence met that's all the Prophet wrote down its to omnipotence men they said that's true when God and a believer nice there's two omnipotence cuz God a man is a part of God he is a son of God and he says and when and when that little he joins it joins with the entire body and Jesus said over mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain be moved on down in your heart but believe what you said you can it will come to pass believe that what you said in a Christian is so murk and around him it's an atmosphere now all he did was just take that note to omnipotence meant he heard her brother teaching that and Sunday school and he drew inspiration from it now I'm gonna pick up later on in his ministry where he brings this start out this is out of the pat mcpherson see he took the note that he got from inspiration hallelujah amen and then he goes back to it and picks it up and then it begins to expound upon it a little bit more because God just begins to reveal more - on that little thought that he heard in Sunday school let me go a little further they say the patmans preacher says hallelujah amen that's what the prophecy amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the name the Garden of Eden said I was gonna choke it but I'm gonna say it man it's omnipotence I mean man is all-powerful that man is all-powerful since man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent hallelujah amen did not he see him mark 11:22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said I love it he goes on what happens when to omnipotence meets when God and man comes together through our nipa tense something's got to say whatever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it and he said it in this word it creates a power oh I like this it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings that thing to pass things that it's not it makes them as though they are amen because to omnipotence have met there he's danced oh isn't he wonderful you know I you know as I was reading this and just kind of meditating on this because see this is you know you have your own inspiration right God has given it by you being made in the image of God God was inspired everything you see in this earth was come from the inspiration of God so that that that power that Lading God you being a son of God you've been a daughter of God that same power lays in you hallelujah amen but you won't see anything till you can get inspired to see it alright listen when you made the statement here it takes your inspiration with the word that's already inspired I just begin to kind of question that to myself amen what is your inspiration what is your inspiration right and I start you know I know that it should be there because we're made in the image of God I know that it's supposed to be there but but what is your inspiration and any just as I as I began to meditate on it I felt that we probably would not recognize what our inspiration was until we found ourselves in a moment of great trial I think that's when you find out what your true inspiration is it's when you're going through something a man then you then you force the camera a man be something that's it didn't want to be you forced the camera elevate into a level that you didn't really want to what you were comfortable just let God take care of it hallelujah but there are some things God wants you to take care of hallelujah somebody right a man look now now you know I just read that scripture and I'm gonna come back to it here and in Exodus because what we read about Moses Moses did that by inspiration God didn't tell Moses to do that God never told Moses just just to say the Egyptians you've seen today you'll see no more forever God didn't tell Moses to say that right Moses got into that situation because the people were afraid Oh hallelujah fear has the people a man they were looking here we are a man facing the Red Sea this thing looks insurmountable if I can use the word impossible how are we gonna get across the Red Sea Moses where the boss where are the ships well I mean how are we supposed to get across this situation not only I was facing Morenci now we hear Pharaoh's army is right behind us and he knows I mean the people know Pharaoh and his armor they're upset we don't die right here at the Red Sea now under this type of pressure Moses rather than buckle and a man he stood up and set before he cried cuz he did cry he did cry amen but before he cried he spoke hallelujah amen and he stood up to a man he stood up before the people who say these citizens that you have seen today he said fear not the Egyptians who I seem to think you shall see them no more forever now do you realize when Moses said that he had nothing hallelujah nothing from God to give him the authority that is speaking he had no word from the Lord he had no tests at the Lord I want to put it this way the reason he didn't have a bus at the Lord it's because the thus says the Lord was already so when you up against the Lord toward adjouris riches in glory when the devil is attacking your body by His stripes I'm inspired by the Word of God stripes I am healed inspiration strikes you when you're going through talking to a friend of mine Oh yesterday and he was saying how I wish I was wrote the scripture down it's not no side of Proverbs but he was saying how you know the doctors that coming to the room in and began to tell them to just give up on mama give up on her she's not gonna make you give up on him he's like no wait a minute we were doing this we were doing that we were doing this and I thought you notice what the other doctor said no we telling you just give up on y'all stop this well no we can't we can't do that you know I mean we got to keep trying so you know they were going back and forth and when the doctor says this to you hey man it just kind of weakens your face so you know this friend and his family they begin the count of weep and cry and and you had one pessimist you know in in a group amen so much got friends like that the pessimist and they like to tell you just an optimist yes I am a man I'd rather believe in doubt because believe in can change things I'm willing to accept God's will but I know that I'm I fainted change stands so if this is an opportunity for me to exercise my face then let me exercise my faith don't think I don't lost my mind because things didn't go the way that I that I was expected to do just like you know I'm gonna keep going back to church even if God take my love when I'm going back to church so how can you believe a god like that well how can you believe a doctor like that that doctor that lost patience but you go right back to his office prays alone but he say he said they were you know tell them all this and they just begin to get a little discouraged so he got her talking it with a another brother a manatee and the brother Tom say I see after they laid out all this problems he's a nice time for you to exercise your Christian faith he said now tell me what scripture you're standing on now you don't told me about your problems but what Scripture are you standing on and they say you say uh you know I didn't I hadn't thought about in fact you know actually while I was going through I didn't even think to read the Word of God so he saved you getting to read and he read something in Proverbs about you know the word providing health to us or something like that I forget exactly what what I said but he said he took that one scripture out of Proverbs and and he just began to speak fit words over his mother encouraging words over mom and used to say he would just start saying because see my momma was losing and then how her mind there a little bit and you know and they couldn't talk to the way they used to talk to it he say just begin to tell her say mom I just appreciate and my mom grateful for how you raised me and mama you did this and the mama you did that and mama mama you did this and I'm so grateful them before you Northey the inspiration struck his sister and it's just beginning to say yes mama you did this for me and then mama you did Saturn and mommy you did that and before you know it all the pessimism was hard to rule amen and everybody was optimistic and when the doctors are giving up on mama those fit words begin to change mama and her reactions begin to be normal because she heard it words why she was underneath Amen that condition hallelujah they were inspired by the Word of God and through that inspiration they change the situation in that room if you can ever get inspired by the Word of God you will see your circumstances change you will see your situations change but you must be inspired by what's already inspired because all scripture amen is given by inspiration the thing changed mama left that hospital and went home never giving up on mama mama left the hospital we're home now we know one day mama gonna have to go a man but they can stop at least thank God for that miracle oh I'm a spy it what is what is your inspiration right I believe it comes when you're going through see when Moses and the children of Israel were going through you know he spoke these words out of Exodus 14 say standstill verse 13 Moses said unto the people fear do not stand still now he's just making this up as he go God had told him to say this to the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord now he put it right back on God when he pretty much sentence I'm not gonna do this but God is see the salvation of the Lord which he he put it all on God which he will show to you today I can see my most God you don't put me out here now I'm gonna have to put you out here hallelujah Amen I'm stepping out on faith I'm I got it you told me to bring the people to this spot I came here by faith I did not know when I got here that you weren't gonna open up the sea like that I didn't know that she was gonna let Pharaoh's army chase us I didn't know he was gonna do that but God allowed Moses to get into this situation in order to resurrect something that was already inside of losers he would have never saw it if he had not come through it and that's a thanks you would have never know what's inside of you the only time you see him is when you come in to test a trial so that's why you got to learn the praise card in the midst of whatever you're going through hey glory to God if you learn how to worship Him in the midst of it you watch you you see your worship will change your attitude your worship will change your outlook your worship changes things hey man church blown in a guy your worship begins to change it Halloween no matter what she's going through no matter what she's going through [Applause] they might have told you no but your worship will change it to a yes Wow brother Jack how can you say that because the prophecy the right mental will change any situation so yes racist starts mentally right inspiration starts mentally you know let me let me read this can see inspiration oh my god I come back to that inspiration is how we got the the masterpiece Moses [Music] Michelangelo where he was designing that masterpiece the man was moving by a mental picture let me tell you this my Michelangelo had never seen a picture of Moses never the man who never said no I mean there was nothing that he could look at that that was show what Moses looked like no evidence at all no artist ever took it upon themselves they're trying to draw Moses so the man had nothing to look at and you can see him a man taking this chip of marble and he begins to chip a little bit here and it chip a little bit there and I can imagine all the critics coming by what are you forming here don't worry I'll worry about it I'll tell you later and he just keep chipping and they keep chipping and he's doing all the chipping by inspiration I want to tell you something there's some things when you're doing it by inspiration you can't explain it to everybody else you can't share with everybody else because they don't see what you see amen they don't see what you see so sorry just shipping and shipping and shipping and he's four minutes imaging and then they said now we know we see a man but who is this man my glass I'll tell you just keep shipping and keep carving to keep dish to keep that and keep hallelujah and I think finally told somebody maybe might have told somebody say this is Moses Michelangelo you ain't never seen Moses in your life how you know this is Moses because this is what I saw in my inspiration and see what he saw in his mind mentally he finally formed it and it become material and when it became real oh I hope y'all can follow me on this amen this is just like it is with God a man God thoughts for us were real folks at the beginning you know God was fellowshiping with you before you even got here y'all might not know might not understand God was God was enjoying your worship before you even got here brother Jack how can you see that well the Bible say where were you Joe said where were you when the sons of God sit down when the sons of God just stared and looked notice something godless but they were shouting for what shall I praise God amen new date I mean they one day I mean you oughta have joy even when you're peels man you wanna have so when the devil attacking your body praise God you still wanna have joy the Songwriters thing I still have joy I still have joy after all the things I've been through I still have joy Michelangelo say it say this Moses and he was so inspired by what had come out of his mind into reality the Michelangelo took his his his his thing that he was chiseling with and he struck it on the knee he is so hard that it chipped it and a very thing a man that he had been waiting on I mean trying to bring it to perfection now he's damaged it but when he did that he see there he yelled and screamed at Moses this is a man that is moving by inspiration he's speaking to a rock [Applause] because Moses himself spoke to a rock now Michelangelo by inspiration is speaking to a rock and he said speak Moses inspiration might make some of y'all look like you lost your mind but you're moving by something that other people can not see Halina inspiration see we can have the church inspiration sake we can have the school inspiration say it'll be like me saying if you say to the mountain be thou removed and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say why it's per a sudden [Applause] you got to have some inspiration you find it in Scripture Moses when he spoke these words in Exodus 14 that Moses was was was challenged the Red Sea in front of him Pharaoh's army behind him he's in a dire straight he's been in between a rock and a hard place and rather than Moses a man let me let me put is what he did cry we didn't read that he did cry but before he cried he spoke something by inspiration and that's where we read here in Exodus 14 13 Moses said unto the people theory not standstill see the salvation of the Lord begin put it back on God which he will show you I'm not gonna do this God gonna do this which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today saying that what this is to me is that Moses was sick and tired of being sick and tired he knew that they a man had reached the point where the promise said that they were only being bondage for so long they had reached that state so now they're supposed to be delivered because God said so so if God promised deliverance then Egyptians can't take us back can I tell you that if God has promised you deliverance then those Egyptians cannot take you back into bondage if this is your season then this is your season and in your season your leave will not risk your leaf won't dry up in your seats praise God so he goes on to say the Egyptians whom you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever all that spoke by inspiration Moses speaking this by inspiration and look at this he goes on to put it on God again the Lord shall fight for you and he should hold your peace and I'm gonna tell you something I like when God fight see if this was Moses fight he might have took a sward out and you know killed another through Egyptians like he did the one Egyptian I don't know what he did to kill one Egyptian he probably took a sweater he had already been trained the way amen Egypt he knew that a military strategist he knew how they fought he knew olives so Moses would have been prepared anybody killed maybe one or two or three Egyptians rester y'all run while we get this run damn I got one very hot God fight hallelujah and after Moses published this where we see him crying hallelujah he tell her hold your peace now he start crying like oh Lord I don't know what I just said hallelujah see our God is not like that every word that he speaks is calculated God does not mean the guy don't have to say nothing and take it back right so so so he want us to realize that we had that same type of authority in us therefore we need to watch what we say therefore we need to watch what we say praise God because there's power in your words how would I give life a power to take it away death and life lies in the power of the tongue look at this the Lord said unto Moses where for Christ's first 15 where for Christ I want to me speaking to the children of Israel that they go for it now this is where God has given him instruction before he didn't have no instruction before he spoke by inspiration but because God was in Moses because the thus saith the Lord was in Moses God had to back up what Moses said and so when Moses didn't know what to do and he was all frustrated and maybe flabbergasted with okay now which direction do I go now God now gives him and stretch they speak right we say don't cry to me wait for crossing me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward don't even look back go forward don't look back go forward hallelujah don't look at your mistakes don't look at your pass go forward from this thing go forward that is inspiration jot it down like the Prophet here from this day go forward April 7 to 2019 go forward you see how God does things in the fourth month on the seventh day he speaks go forward what is full the number of deliverance what is seven completion and on the for the fourth month seventh day go forward see you right little things like that down because you'll come back and pick that up again hallelujah all right all right all right all right it meant somebody else should a yell like sister Rita that's for me that's for me she's taking it personal know how to speak to you look at this says in the Lord said to Moses wept for Christ down to me speaking to the children Israel that they go forward now he's giving them instruction but lift up lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea now God's giving them instruction now but before he had inspiration not instruction inspiration now you're waiting for instruct instruction but God wants you to move by inspiration can I say that again you're waiting for instruction but God wants you to move by inspiration [Music] I'm accident hard question what was what's really in your heart what's really in your heart she was in David's heart to Bill got a temple right that was what was in his heart and when he started moving by what was in his heart the inspiration of his heart actually the property even told him do all that it's in thine heart the Prophet told him that now now now now when the Prophet hadn't prayed and got the will of God so when God shows that no no no I don't want David to do that God stopped him so let me tell you this if you move by inspiration and this room God will stop now I had to say that to release you so you can start moving by inspiration you waited for instruction but God wants to give you inspiration can I can I can I put it this way when I talk about the children of Israel leaving each and we know what God did i'ma say it like this y'all forgive me if it don't come out right but God wanted to share his glory with Moses so he allowed Moses to speak something and place Moses words in the scripture so God willing to share some things with you right but he gotta put you in a situation where you can turn around and write the testimony I said but you wouldn't get that until he actually inspired to the same so why he giving you glory you given him glory what's your inspiration I believe you find it when you're going through your moments of trial that's when your inspiration actually comes out you might not even know it's there but it shows up when you're going through trial that I had one time on my job I was manager and I just got this employee man we I thought my team was doing really good and man we might be straight are we good and we go to a meeting thank you things like a little worship service that we went to and we come out to worship service and one of the guys who and as I said Jack I need to talk to you say okay all right no problem what's going on how can I help you it's a I got a new job and I'm believing in two weeks we've just got the team together so you leaving me in two weeks I said yeah I believe it in two weeks or something Hannah so I ran I'm alright I'm real sorry to hear that sorry to hear that so you know I say okay so I you know when I told my boss what was going on and said we you know we're gonna lose them and in two weeks and so on and so forth and and I said well I was a little just despondent about it look just you know upset about it I'm like man I don't know what I'm gonna do I just got all this together I'm not sure what I'm gonna do and so then he came back to me like maybe a day of so later late and he said Jack I know I told you two weeks but I'm have to leave at the end of this week so what I don't even have time to replace you I don't know what I'm gonna do I don't know you know what you know what how's this gonna happen I said man I say all right I'm like man you do that do it like that we have Church they don't do us like that's alright alright if you got to do what you got to do that's fine so he went on and I'm like Lord how am I gonna replace this guy Lord what am I gonna do and as I start praying about it God led me to a scripture and say I could have been alone I could have just walked around with this very static countenance and poor me hoping everybody felt sorry for me but God led me to scripture and I went back to the scripture we're set well Sammy was told by God say Saul I have rejected as King and they say now and and Samuel was a little discouraged like man I know that this guy the be king I've known that same year and and I know he left it I mean I know that song say but Lord Lord you know and God said no no no no don't even worry about praying for me I have I have rejected him and God was friendly saying I got another King God was already prepared can I put it that way God waiting on you to catch up God already done walk this thing got he waiting on you to catch up God was already prepared and and when I looked I looked at I might wait a minute you know he say you say I rejected sent me I got me another King now you know there's another thing I'm just taking my time here I don't even know where I'm I don't even know how long I've been here but I know that I'm this is the thing he say I already got another King go to Jesse's house now I had two acts of myself a question if God told them who has to go to why didn't God tell him which boy was gonna be he told him the house and the name of the house but he didn't tell him which boy because I think in the process but I'm not sure which boy God also shows something to send you don't judge people the way other people judge people say I look gonna miss heart I don't look the way other people look because in looking at the statue of this man but I'm looking at the character of a man he never even told him the boy he told him the house but not the boy because God wanted to show something more - and let me tell you something when you're going through something just because God want to show a little bit more to you he went on down there and and anointed David to become king and when when he got David as his King you know and I looked at that store I said okay Lord what you're telling me is that you already got the next person for me for this job you already know who they are and you just know where they are and and I had to change my attitude and once I changed my attitude and not caught things by Scripture I caught it by Scripture then I just begin to look different that and then it just kind of struck me so remember that one night and I thought it was a mistake I went to working and I was going to be trained for you know running the camera and stuff like that and and as I was being trained for running the camera I went at a particular time I remember getting the email and I went about 4 o'clock for the train and they say Jack you didn't respond to the email in time so the trainer not happening till 7 o'clock if you were to respondent when we needed you to respond you would have been able to do it at 4 o'clock but you didn't respond so you got to come back at 7 o'clock so I called my wife and said you know dear I'm gonna be late getting home I got a you know stand for this training you know I'm gonna be running or working on the cameras so I'm gonna just be late getting home tonight she's like okay and and and and when I was when I thought I was making a mistake God had already wall things up so here I didn't make it to the four o'clock because I didn't respond well about me going to the 7 o'clock training we all start introduced myself well I'm Jack and I work here this you know and in this department I work in the IT department I do this thing and then the next thing I say I'm sorry so and I work for I work in out t at this job nothing shy I'm so so I work in IT at this job next one I work in IT I'm like everybody work in IT that's coming for training and everybody had different comings they're working for and I'm like man this is something amazing now God allowed that little situation to happen so understand my mind so when I lost this employee my mind went back to that situation remember all them guys that volunteered and they work in IT said I called it later that that arranged the meeting and I say you know you got any email addresses a contact information where I can reach out to these guys to see you know check and see if they want a job she sent me the emails I sent out email blasts and one guy responded and the one guy responded is the one guy hired see God had already walked the thing out but I had to change my attitude and I had to get some inspiration from the scripture see my inspiration connect with his inspiration it's gonna produce a result and this is what the Prophet says when your inspiration if whatever you do don't let the devil take your inspiration Joe had inspiration when he was going through his inspiration was I know that my Redeemer liveth see though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God that was his inspiration I believe the Centurion a man had an inspiration when he met the Lord Jesus it says I'm a man under Authority and I tell this one to come and he comes and I tell that when they go and he goes he say if you would just speak the word only my servant be made whole that was his inspiration and and there was a result from his inspiration hallelujah amen I remain I know the woman a and that with the issue of blood she had an inspiration if I could just touch the hem of His garment then I know I'll be mijo when her inspiration connected with the Living Word it produced a result amen there was there was one woman the South Phoenician woman a man come big and you know just for her daughter say you know I know if you just kind of came and pray for my daughter he said look I'm not even sent to your people I'm not sent to your people he say he said she say now you write you write you say say say your people are dogs that's what he called your people with dogs and I'm not sent to them she said you know you're right you're right that's exactly right huh attitude was right and she say she say but even the dogs even dogs can lick a crumb from the masa stick I don't need a whole meal but a crumb from your table will satisfy you say great is your faith woman go go find in the way that you believed it her inspiration connected with the Living Word it produced a result David had inspiration and I want to leave you with this from that I I got more here but I ain't gonna hang go and go through all this today but David had inspiration David walked out there he wasn't even supposed to be there but then the Philistines had them under duress and David walks out that bring his brother some some lunch or something like that from the house and just kind of see about their their their well-being and they say and he see Goliath come walking out and make this both Goliath I mean David said now who is this uncircumcised Philistine he's they talk different than everybody else who is this uncircumcised Philistine saying this I don't care how big he is who is he can you see David is pointing his hand yeah y'all gonna do some David oh so you think you certain so yeah I am I don't think I'm something I know the God that's in me a song how can you say that greater is He that is in me than he that's in the world so in all I could say is that I've gotta face bigger bigger problems in this imma face bigger Giants than this and this ain't nothing and I don't think God do it befo gotta do it he was moving by inspiration and because of the way he talked it began to you know get around in the camp it everybody be like well who was just a little fella that's talking he was a young man right 17 18 years old young man out there talking like this and and finally got the hot salsa court like like who wants this junk fell out here talking like this and then they say what bring him in here let me talk to me say he say he would see Pro saw sitting now I don't know who this uncircumcised feel selling us but I'd be glad to find ya so looked at son we appreciate your enthusiasm we really appreciate your enthusiasm but we tie by the nation of Israel is resting on your shoulders people I mean it means the lives are resting on your shoulders and I got I'm sorry I got no confidence in this other folk might not have confidence in your inspiration but when God's revealed it to you you got to stand on it they're not moving by what you see only you can move by what you see so he stood her sake he gave him a testimony he's saying if you don't mind let me testify all right it says you know I was out watching my daddy she and and saw a bear came in and got one of the sheep and I went and took that bear right from out of that bear that bears grass so you did that say yes I sure did oh he said man that's pretty good cuz bears could stem eight feet tall themselves brother branham shot at 8-foot grizzly right so you say say say so that's pretty good you did they say yeah yeah I certainly did sir he's saying and also while I'm there fighting off the bear and I got him out of there hello lion come up ain't gonna take one of my daddy's sheep now you know you know it's a shame for a shepherd to lose sheep you know that right you say so so sir I had to finish up this bear and then I went after the line you did what I went after the line grab him by his beard took my sheep back nurse the sheep back to health huh and and restored that sheep he said he said but neither the lion nor the bear got my daddy she know I know nobody was out there to see me but I'm telling what happened and that's why I'm not afraid of this guy and say he said he said he is defying the armies of the Living God it's not even my batteries God's back and all God need is somebody to do what show up say okay I got your testimony has impressed me but I'm just still a little unsure because you ain't got no army going out here get this this giant it gave him some armies and and I just always ask the question if if Saul didn't believe in his own armor protecting him to go fast like Goliath why he gonna give it to David David said no no no I don't need this he said when I when I fought the lion and the bear I didn't have all this all I had was five smooth stones in this slingshot and if God rescued me with this he gonna rescue y'all with the same instrument David went out there and he fought Goliath and I want I wanna I want to say something to you when it comes to inspiration some of y'all might be looking forward to get through a situation that you might be in right now I want to tell you something your prior victories should inspire future success can I right y'all gonna write that down anybody gonna write that down that's what God said to tell y'all your prior victories should inspire future success and I can just tell you this right now I've seen God make a way for some y'all some of y'all I don't seen him do it I don't watch them providing ways that go beyond your expectations I seen him do it before I know he'll do it again hey man I've seen when you got your first house and I saw how God did it they might so got with my own eyes I saw God when you got your first house I saw God provide when you got your first apartment I saw God provide when you got your first car I saw God provide I saw some of y'all children born and how you gonna raise them up to be a man adults I saw God provide for y'all you're past victories your past your prior victories should inspire future success if you did it before you'll do it again lion went down bear went down and why did Goliath have to go down because God has perfected gospel fected in threes oh my I can't get him tall that I'll just have to let it go I just God wants you to know that there's inspiration Moses moved out by inspiration and when he said the Drifters that you've seen today you'll see them no more forever through that inspiration we noticed the end of the story that Pharaoh's army came after he stretched his this rod across the scene and it divided hither and thither hey man brother quick coup it divided and they walked across some dry land here come Pharaoh Veronica's God don't fight like we fight he not just taking once warden you know y'all know that right you know when when even when Joshua said son stand still that was his inspiration God didn't tell Joshua to say that that was Joshua's inspiration and God honored his inspiration and when he said that not only not only not before he said it God was fighting the battle they were just they were slaying this and doing and they they today's killing as many people as they could but when God start fighting you know how God felt hailstones okay I want y'all to see God can you see yourself fighting the enemy and you just did with your sword and a house don't come hit him and miss you Utah by calculated Utah by precise Utah by perfect here the thing hit show you like and you turn around together in a hail stone and the Bible say mo were killed with hailstones then with a sword so when God fight it's over Moses Moses I don't know how we gonna lose God said and I just take it Rob stretch it out and y'all walk cross go forward just keep going forward man they start walking forward and and and and here God was holding up the Egyptians put that pillar there that pillar pillar cloud and all that there to kind of hold them up but then he just lifted it just and when he lifted they thought they thought Oh for God oh he done made a way for me to went running across a million God wait to they got what it was on the show come on in here you know Pharaoh Pharaoh I got this they thought they got away come on boys everybody running after them and God waiting they got real good inside then we did something for and by closing it up by closing it up he actually fulfill Moses inspiration the Egyptians you have seen today you'll see them no more forever Moses didn't think that Moses didn't even know how was gonna happen he said God don't show you how it's gonna happen hallelujah and I can I say it like like Moses said in Exodus and the Lord did take inspiration don't let them take inspiration you're gonna need that to defeat some demos and if he's done it before he'll do it again and let you pass your prior successes inspire future success amen let's pray musicians if you would make your way forward father we are so grateful for the word your prophet just tell us Lord these little things of how we have to allow our inspiration to connect with the inspiration that is in the word Lord then we'll see results you know the things that we're faced and you know the things that we're up against the rock and a hard place that may be before us the father will speak by faith knowing that if we say to the mountain be thou removed our cast into the sea don't down their hearts then we can have what we see Lord our prayer our desire it's supposed to be in to walk Lord in these places that you have called us to nor know God that the the enemy desires to keep us from these things that's his desire the Lord I pray that we will all just begin to take a walk down memory just begin to think on the things that you've already done you have proven yourself over and over and over again one thing you cannot do is fail song was sang a little earlier through it all we've learned to trust in Jesus alone would learn to take you at your word and father we are encouraged we encouraged God that you hold is still carry us through and Lord I don't know I don't know the different Egyptians that the people may be facing and I know the Egyptians that they dealt with before they came here sometimes it represents a spirit Lord that we don't know what what folk were facing but we can say that the Egyptians they saw today they'll see no more forever we speak it by faith by inspiration and believe o God that you will bring your word to pass some Jesus name that we pray amen amen amen let's give the Lord a hand [Music] at some point in time the songs that we sing just can't remain songs but they have to become manifestations in our lives the song years ago and I'm glad that the musicians is kind of picked up on it and brought it here I wanted to invite us all to stand and somebody says I shall have what I
