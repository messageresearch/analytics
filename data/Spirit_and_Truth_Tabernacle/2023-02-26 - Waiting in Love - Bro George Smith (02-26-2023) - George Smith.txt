disappreciate the Lord Jesus it's more than I I I'm um I bring you greetings from New Mexico and Las Cruces and also in Phoenix Arizona I was there ministering in both places uh last last Saturday there in Las Cruces and just wonderful wonderful Fellowship there with the church there amen Cedar Hills a church of the Cross brother the pastors brother Caleb Pettis amen I told him now over here in uh in South Florida we would say Perez amen but out there they say Paris amen so I'm learning how to you know use you know pronounce it the right way where I go you know but uh but we we had a wonderful time there that their theme for the meeting was the day I died and uh I said well okay now uh we can we can find something to work with that theme and you know we went back to the archive about 12 years ago when a man brought out the uh it's time for I to die amen and we just had a wonderful wonderful time of fellowship and and we made our way through Tucson just for a couple days of rest and I got into a hotel room and and I stayed in there pretty much for two days and only came out to eat breakfast and eat dinner and just locked in there and just spending time with the Lord and just so refreshing for me I needed I needed some time like that not not worried about work not worrying about nothing but just sitting there reading my Bible and reading other things and just you know just just locked in with God so I I was I was very very refreshed a man amen in that and I realized how important it is for me to probably do that amen a little bit more often maybe a couple times a year just taking Monday and twos and just steal away I used to sing that song Steal Away Home I ain't got long but stay here amen so we just appreciate that and we made our way up to Phoenix brother Aaron mcgarran you all remember him uh brother Aaron came here with brother Danny steaman and preached a few years ago and um and brother Aaron while he was preaching uh him being a lawyer at the end of his sermon uh he uh just he said I rest my case [Music] that Calvary [Music] or creams and blood [Music] shed forward The Ransom paint My Liberty Hallelujah and I rest my case Hallelujah Calvary you know a lawyer coming to our church and singing something like that I say brother that's a drop the mic moment and uh we will never be the same and you know we we were just really just Reminiscing on some precious times and not now the Lord has called him to start a work there in Phoenix and um just some of the testimonies that they were sharing with me of just what God has done uh I was just I was just absolutely blown away I was refreshed again you know just hearing that our Lord is moving in a very special way um you know different saints that have come from different places to to make the church what it is and we had a wonderful time and brother uh I preached there on Wednesday night the Christmas sermon uh the attribute of Salvation and uh brother brother Aaron said when I read the scripture he said oh I know which way you're going he was leaning say but then as you start going through the message I say oh my goodness so I start leaning the other way I say well praise the Lord Brother he said he just really really enjoyed it and the church enjoyed amen just a little thought there on the attribute of Salvation and and on last on Friday night they had a couple's banquet well really just couples Fellowship I should say on the property that they have there um and I was just I was I was just a beautiful evening in Phoenix and I told them the only thing the reason I can't call it a perfect evening it's a good evening but the reason it's not a perfect evening it's because my wife is not here with me if my wife was here then it'd be a perfect evening but since I'm standing here alone it's not perfect amen but but nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves and uh and I had to speak there a man to uh to the couples just to kind of encourage them a little bit and uh just just some things that the Lord put in my heart um that I learned and then Lord showed me how some of these things I learned how they a lot even in the message so we was able to kind of bring that together and just just really have a wonderful time so brother Aaron sent his greetings to you all and I told him at some point in time we'll have to have them come back this way again amen so we thank the Lord let me give you today's announcements let me also say um two two things amen I don't see brother kwaku here but uh actually brother quick who was scheduled to preach today and uh and I told him I said brother uh brother George is passing through and he said brother I'm local I'm local let brother George preach cause I'm local I say brother I appreciate that and uh I appreciate the spirit and amen is heart and this morning uh we'll we'll have brother George coming a little bit to to minister for us I thank God for brother Troy on Wednesday night amen [Music] stream the service because you're two hours behind out there but I was able to stream the service and I thought it was just so appropriate the way that he just ministered and then just tied it right into this this fasting that we're entering into amen it's 21 days of fasting so um this week this week we'll have service on Wednesday night um at 7 30 our streaming continues through Twitter Facebook as well as our church website john423.org I was speaking to a friend of mine yesterday uh brother Anthony Baggs and uh he was calling me up and brother Anthony he streams our services I wanna I wanna say something to uh brother Simba because uh brother Anthony say you know he's up up there in North Carolina and he says you know he says I really appreciate you Brothers you know getting the sermons out there on YouTube faster it says because I have to sit and wait a couple days to to see what was what was said and he said it used to be almost like a week go by before we get to now a couple days is there he said I really appreciate that so then I told him say Well now you know tomorrow you can stream the service live at john423.org he says I'll be on so brother Anthony if you're there God bless you and uh uh it was good to hear from him he's uh he's one of the brothers that go way back we were young people and um you know he he just been there for us he told me recently just went through a time where he was in uh take they had to put him in a coma for a couple days they couldn't figure out what was going on with him so they put him in a coma and then he had to go in dialysis for a couple days uh for about a month and um but then they released him from the dialysis and said everything as well and it back to normal routine so we thank the Lord for touching uh brother Anthony Baggs and they say this this is the third time God has had him very close to death like that but they keep bringing them back and they realize that there's a purpose for him coming amen back so we we just we we were happy to hear his voice on yesterday and just trust that the Lord will just continue to touch him he is determined to surprise us with a visit amen so I pray God Will Make A Way that he'll be able to get down here and just shock us amen glory to God so we thank the Lord our our corporate fast amen this is something we do as a church every year where we uh we just fast together uh very similar to what they did in the Bible when Esther was a getting ready to approach the king she uh she said please everybody go on a three-day fast with me because I'm I'm I'm putting my life on the line here and I just want God to go before me so corporately they fasted together and that's what we're doing it started today and like I say this is I don't like to dictate how you fast some might be able to fast at 12 o'clock some might be able to faster three o'clock some might be able to fast at six o'clock some might do Daniel Fast some might do technology fast I mean whatever it is that you want to do just enter in and join you know with us during this time over the next 21 days and let's just believe God to just move in our midst amen so that's starting today and it will end on March 18th so keep that in mind also uh Friday we have our home tape service that everyone will be listening to at home the unchangeable God Amen is what we'll be listening to the date there 60 0 3 26 the

one of them churches we we We're Not Gonna Let You just come and sit not not brother George Smith I'm sorry and for our young people that might not be aware uh brother George Smith is actually the son-in-law of brother Branham amen so we have a a real eyewitness amen here in our midst and um you know no other thing about brother George that I appreciate I had the opportunity to travel to Israel with him a couple times and and he he he spoke prophetically over me and um somebody had asked me when I got there I think for the it might have been the second time I was there because brother Dave and sister Hannah went with us on that second trip and um sister Cobb sister bird sister Brown on a man they were all with us and um you know and and my friend uh uh Joyce she was with us and we just had we had a wonderful time but brother brother um somebody asked me say is this your first time you know hearing Israel I said you know it's it's not my second time I mean it's my second time and brother brother George said yeah and there'll be many more trips [Music] okay I received that prophecy uh because I tell you what life changes you know the Bible changes a lot of things change when you just go to Israel and you and you just see the place where Jesus actually went and all the things you read in the Old Testament this is the land where these things happen it's it's a good land you know it's it's a blessing so I pray that we'll have an opportunity to go and we'll be able to take other Saints from uh from the church to be able to go there and amen just enjoy Israel at least one time in your lifetime amen you'll you'll never be the same again I promise you that so this morning uh I'm not going to take any more time I want brother George to come and just have his Liberty amen

our precious brother George Smith to the pulpit this morning Amazing Grace that's saved her rich hold on one second I'm sorry I forgot something I told you it was a prayer praise sister Shonda says I

of my grandson so praise God I know the sisters had that in prayer on one night God heard your prayer amen by this answer for our sister God bless you praise God pray [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] God [Music] typical sound system it's not a million dollars God bless you all it's good to be here and um it looks like a different crowd than was here last time I was here all right kids grow up and all right we get a little balder except for you but this morning we're glad to be in Florida where there's beautiful weather most of the time and we bring you greetings from many other places where we've been if you've got your Bible let's not waste any time turn to Luke chapter 8. in Luke chapter 8 is where Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee for one man right and you can read all about it now the Sea of Galilee is not a sea like you have out here it's a lake right eight by 13 miles no problem and um Jesus went across the lake delivered one man from many many spirits his name was Legion the spirits went into the pigs the pigs drowned in the sea that's right and life went on but in Luke chapter 8 where we at here in verse 38 now the man out of whom the Devils were Departed beside him that he might go with him he wanted to follow Jesus he wanted to stick with him right but Jesus sent him away and said hey go back to your house show what great things God has done unto you so the gospel is spread by people that know what they're talking about that I've had a personal experience we can't all sit in the boat with Jesus all right brother we've got to go yes sir amen and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him and it came to pass that when Jesus was returned returned where back where he came from over there by Tiberius when he returned uh the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him are you waiting for him today amen amen did you come just for the free air conditioning come look at the girls no come to hear from God okay turn over two pages to Luke chapter 12. that's the historical that we read about there now we're coming over here to their prophetic in 39 and 40 of chapter 12. we find it here real quick yes 39 and 40. and this know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered this house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh in an hour that you think not so are we waiting for him or are we not all right you know what is our attitude this morning now turn over to the second Thessalonians yeah we're gonna we're Bible preachers we're not preaching out of the funny books this morning um second Thessalonians chapter 3 and verse 1. finally Brethren prayed for us that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and that you may be that and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked man wow yeah clear back there at the beginning of the Gospel there was unreasonable people making foolish arguments and it's best just to draw a line okay you go that way I'll go this way wow the weekend for all men have not the faith yeah they're not all Christians and the Lord is faithful but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the Lord touching you that you both do and will do the things which we command you verse 5 of seconds Thessalonians 3 and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ the Holy Spirit brought you here today Empty Chairs don't even phase me right because they're either home watching TV or they're down at the flea market they're out on a boat you know but God sent you here yes you see so you made the right choice amen and are you expecting Jesus to say something that's what we come for amen he only comes to those that are waiting for him he doesn't force himself on anybody that's right the title today is waiting in love so pay attention we don't plan on repeating stuff let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy today we thank you that you brought us all here to the right place the right time and I'm sure that there's something in all of this that'll be for each one bless each person here bless those that are out there on the internet Lord speak to them out there where they're listening where they're watching Lord we don't know where they are we know where these people are help us today we ask in Jesus name amen amen amen you may be seated So today we're going to preach from Brother randoms absolute but fair enough yeah mine's red and yours is probably black the holy scriptures okay amen now the fact is that if you do a little bit of research you'll find over 200 times brother Ram says back to the word all right so it's not a suggestion it's not if you feel like it it's a command and so um I've also heard brother M say clearly that this Bible is our road map yes it's all here but it's got to be properly put in order we're not building an ark we're not you know going to traips Across the desert there is an exit right it takes the ministry of of Ephesians 4 11 and 12 to put it in order that's right that's how the bride comes into Perfection so God sent brother Branham with the spirit of Elijah in a fulfillment of scriptures see God doesn't do things like we do if if uh if brother Jack's wife says you know I'd really like you to to paint this or fix this well I'll get around to it and you know and it never happens you know he doesn't say like you know you know what Adam said whenever Eve said you know honey that that tree's in the way oh yes dear let me move that for you that's right why didn't I think of that oh man but you see God has a way of doing things it all comes back to Holy Scripture amen because the promise in Malachi 4 says I'm going to send you Elijah he's going to turn your hearts back to the original so this might be important amen not when you feel like it right you know and and if you don't like the Old Testament okay let's go over to Matthew 17. Jesus said Elijah shall truly first come and restore all things now the disciples were good guys and they were the chosen of God but they were a little bit thick-headed sometimes oh that means John and he didn't say words okay y'all you'll catch it eventually right but uh the preacher says over in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven a time and a season for everything okay and that covers everything every detail of your individual lives this little boy on the front row is not worried about the things that you're worried about back there he doesn't worry about credit payments and if the car is going to start no no not his problem right let's read about lunch amen and I guarantee you we will be out before lunch I'm not a three-hour preacher I know you had some but we're not one of them so God knows all the details and it's all the things about your individual life today tomorrow through the resurrection and to the other side amen and he'll reveal to you what you need as you need it you see and so he knows exactly what the solution is to your problem it's not always a hundred thousand dollars no all right we go through trials God supplies and we move on all right so I'm only here to remind you we didn't bring any you know I don't have any magic nothing special we're just here to remind you amen and I'm not an Entertainer just a person to give a true witness amen of a mighty message and so we want you to you know look in the mirror now this mirror doesn't need cleaning your job is to put to put in the right position to see yourself why he provides the mirror but we got to get it in the right position I've been to Africa a few times and I was in a nice home one day and you know you're over here washing your face but the mirrors on this wall back here well that doesn't work too good right couldn't see the comb my hair or anything you know had to go over there but we have the mirror right here in front of us so um God is always interested also in Balance yes sir we got some nice cars out here but on every wheel there's a little bitty thing made out of lead it costs about 50 cents and without that you have a horrible ride right and so God has sent you here today to see about getting in balance and that's why that I carry this level with me and uh we'll see if there's anything to attach it to no no metal here well anyway you got the picture let's put it on something that'll stick anyway yes we must be in Balance okay now a long time ago I was married to Rebecca Branham and the Lord took her home at the end of November of 2006. so after the funeral and you know now we gotta regroup and go forward you can't stay because there's no standing still so I asked the Lord to keep me busy and keep me focused and keep me balanced amen and so there's a formula for balance yes we'll get to that later all right so pay attention so our Focus today is on waiting that's patience you know it's a bit of a foreign concept to a lot of people because we live in an instant world now you get out here on 95 and there's going to be somebody that's got a faster car than you and he's much more important those rules aren't for him all right he has to get there and he might find a tree on the way but if you just go in Balance you will get there you know and so people live in this instant world you put the pedal down it goes faster uh you know they they just are that way but as Believers that we are plugged into God's economy and with his perfect timing we are in fact waiting for the Redemption of these mortal bodies okay and we're waiting for the full salvation of our soul now we're saved by grace through faith in the atonement of Christ at Calvary that is still the gospel every day everybody it's not just the Baptist not just Billy Graham it's for you that's right and Carol what your name is or what but you must come the right direction and so we're saved by by grace through faith in the atonement of Christ but we're waiting for the completion or the closing we are Christians in progress right some are farther down the road some you know are beginning so we've got to have patience you see now David wrote over here in Psalm 62 let's see 62 and verse 5 says here my soul wait thou only upon God yes for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God's their refuge for us all that you need is in the word of God Amen Okay so our only hope our own security is in God so in Romans 13 11 and knowing the time that now it's high time to wake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believe amen it's not completed that's at the end you know but it's nearer and while we wait we're not wondering or guessing but we're busy getting ready amen just like you had to get up at a certain time to get yourself prepared to look decent like this young man here with a nice tie and everything pretty Sharp I thank your mom and um so you have to get ready to be here on time and I congratulate you got people on time because some places you know they come dragging in 30 minutes late yes not good amen but um we're not wondering we're getting ready First Peter chapter one that the trial of your faith so your faith will be tried nobody's exempt right those are parentheses the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth all will be tried and fire yes so that's the parenthesis so the trial of your faith might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen nobody here has seen him we have the record whom have you not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls the closing is coming right we're just in the process you see in Romans chapter 8 one of my favorite chapters says we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he get hope for it but if we hope for that which we see not then we do with patients wait for it so we must be patient steady balanced moving forward so everything of value you've got to wait for it whether it's lunch whether it's finding a good coffee shop or whatever you got to wait for it as a child everything was weight my son a little bit later well we didn't know when that later was coming you said wait you know and waiting for a trip was always a challenge and then as young adults which I see a few here I used to be a young adult long time ago young adults have very little experience right okay right you were there one time yes sir yeah and so as a young adult we had lots of opinions and um we we wanted to offer advice to our mother that's good preaching big mistake she says you just wait till you have some children amen so now my dad you know he was a good Christian Baptist preacher and he said God always answers my prayers yeah it's either yes or no or wait a while all right all right so there's always an answer so um the Christian Life does not take us to perfection in this body all right now you can take all the vitamins eat all the broccoli you know stay away from chocolate stay away from all the good stuff but you got to be balanced you know so if you're never going to get to perfection in this flesh if that's what you're looking for you're the wrong church amen but we live daily amongst Sinners it's in our Dark World totally immersed in sin I mean just look at him you know you you go to the mall you see these people but we do not conform to their ways okay we don't conform to their desires we're not looking around getting nervous we're looking up okay Luke 21 28 and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your head redemption's drawing nigh the world is falling apart the dollar is going to go to zero the only reason it works is because people have faith in it but when we lose faith when we lose faith in that dollar bill it's going to go to zero that's right the whole world's in chaos you see so it's really close that's why the believer with the Holy Spirit anointing in his soul can walk right through dark laodicea without damage without becoming casualty and without looking like laodicea all right hey we don't have to look like them we can look like Christians that's right amen whereas if the only has the genuine and only of God on the flesh or on his Spirit that's when the music's playing oh yeah we're in the spirit you know when the Music Stops you fall flat oh we got something to last forever you know but if that's the only Spirit you have on your flesh or on your spirit uh that person will fail miserably and end up in the hot place guaranteed amen okay so let's move ahead here um you must have the Holy Spirit of God on your soul sealed securely until the day of your Redemption so we can live here we can use the benefits the tools of laodicea and not only survive but we're destined to be more than conquerors that's right amen yes sir I'm just barely getting by you know we're Victorious laodicea Believers and when we cross over to the other side and some of you might go before I go I don't know only God knows see for every one of us there's a line in the road you will not go past that line so if you get there first they might be handing out t-shirts I don't know but it's not going to say Survivor all right okay who's in charge of that couldn't you hear back there no we got it you got it okay um but it's not going to say Survivor it's going to say Overcomer right right man that's right you know there's these these competition they call boxing which is really kind of a little game they put on but there's only one winner right the other guy he's flat too bad so so the winner he gets the big Buckle that's right he gets the check he's the Overcomer amen but when he gives a check to his wife she's more and we have the benefits now I got a friend out west and uh he's a preacher so you know you've got to be careful when you give the creature a microphone you know so he says he dreamed that he got to heaven and he's walking around now short people usually look for somebody just a little bit shorter to talk to they don't look around they're not looking for somebody taller yes and so he's walking around he found somebody a little bit shorter so he's talking to him and um and so the the shorter brother said oh uh where are you from well sir I'm from wow somebody actually made it from Leticia man tell me about it so being a preacher he had the microphone so he goes on and on and tell them all about you know laodicea and all the trials and everything so finally after because nobody has a watch up there so it doesn't matter so finally he said oh and sir and what was your name oh I'm just Moses so they will be surprised that we make it now we are living in dark laodicea and you might have heard me say this before but you see brother Ram traveled a lot and in 1959 he was traveling down here in the in the islands in Jamaica and so forth and there was a a uh some Americans with him and so one of them says that he had um a four-hour session with brother random one day and they talked about a lot of things and he asked brother and why do you say so much about 1959 about 1977. they're in 59 he's talking about 77 which is 18 years out there who knows if we're even going to get there and so brother Ram says well because as I look through the stream of time so he's seeing numbers he said when I got to 77 it was so dark I didn't see how anybody could live in that kind of Darkness well guess what we're 47 years the other side Now 46 whatever that's right and it's more darker it's more deceiving and because you see there's there's promises in the Bible and we always go to the positive promises but there's negative promises there's things that must come to pass on God's clock and one of them is Matthew 24 24. there's going to be something come along some Force through some people that is going to be so deceiving it's going to take even right up to the elect everybody else so that we're safe okay so but um all these promises must have a fulfillment right but the redeemed are waiting in love praise God you might never heard that phrase but it's in the message we'll get to it eventually so many people are waiting to hear the gospel for the first time they might be your neighbor they might be people at Walmart wherever you see so through radio through internet the gospel is reaching people that we can never go preach to you see the scriptures and the message it's all available in many languages on every cell phone but you got to know what numbers to push right to bring it up you see and so it's available all the time now in the ministry of Jesus Christ as you know if you've read your scriptures um he didn't deal with the nice people of society he dealt with people that we wouldn't even want coming in here they didn't dress right they didn't act right that's good but they had to Encounter With Jesus Christ and their life changed amen and so many hundreds of uh Dangerous Drug people in Mexico have heard the gospel hundreds and hundreds have been baptized so it's doing you know the gospel over the radio and through the uh memory sticks that we've distributed and so forth is doing much more to solve the problem than all the soldiers at the border and all the stuff that's going on Wow Wow and just this week they indicted another high official that was taking money under the table so things are happening you see and the book of Acts you know is not finished yet it's still in the writing here in the 21st century we're part of it you're a part of it so we're still translating still printing um because there's hungry people there's people out there just like you sitting in churches this morning some of them have never seen even seen a book for five years so we're printing in China Distributing throughout Latin America and they have the message in their language something I can underline turn back you know and if you don't have a church age book we got some out in the car there's no excuse me okay so many people in the scriptures had to wait we have the story in Luke 2 of old the old man called Simeon and he was getting old he wanted to die but God spoke to him he says son you're not going to die until your eyes have seen the consolation of Israel amen so he gave him some kind of sign we don't know what it was we don't know how long he waited but he was waiting because there was a an expectation in the air for the Messiah and um to to know what's going on and and some people like him there's only a few that recognize what God was doing in present tense you see and so he would um uh let's we don't know but let's assume that they had a certain day of the week that they dedicate the babies so the long line of women and their babies are out there and he'd go out and he'd look no no sign today go back to bed one day he goes out and he saw the sign that he was looking for amen we don't know what it is it's not important and so he goes out there and he stands right there beside Mary and Joseph and only Mary and Joseph and Simeon knew what was going on the rest of them it's just another day of dedicating babies and so he goes up to her and says may I hold the baby sure and that he said in prayer let thy servant now depart in peace my eyes have seen what do you see a baby a crying baby but that was God's solution and so um he was part of Israel at that time very few people recognized what God was doing Jesus didn't come with with a crown with gold robes no he looked like everybody else you know and so uh that was then now what about Israel today well they're doing fine thank you they're in their Homeland according to scripture and they're waiting for the Messiah and they're currently currently crying out for Redemption because God is in control he doesn't need us to go over there and slip in you know tracks They know the god of the Bible we got to do our part you know and so in Genesis 12 it says I will bless those that bless thee amen and I will curse those that curse them and so those who have been over there you've seen the blessings all the neighbors are crazy they want to bulldoze them into the sea right but they're standing that's right they're they're fine and like the brother said yes we do still take people over there amen I'm not in a wheelchair yet oh so we have a trip in June we have a trip in December so get your coins together now in our scripture in Luke chapter 8 also in mark five when when Jesus came back to the port they've been across the sea across the lake they came back and he uh he always drowns the crowd whoever he's had and so here comes the um the uh the boat and there's people down there well there's one little sister lived up on the hillside and she's up there in her rocking chair knitting and she sees that crown down there huh I wonder what's going on down there now she was sick okay she'd been sick for 12 years had a blood issue that wouldn't cure she went to every doctor she'd already mortgaged her Farm she sold the animals she was desperate and nothing worked oh my God and so she's at the end of her rope and so she said well I'll go down and see what's going on well she got down there close oh Jesus is coming by and so when she got you know a little closer God gave her a revelation that if you just reach over there and just just touch just touch His Garment do I have to have a three-hour interview don't need to be prayed for it just just touch his garments that's right that's right right and that's what she did there's all these people Milling around and she reached his own touched His Garment and the disciples were there and so uh Jesus said no wait a minute somebody touched me that's right I guess it was right beside him Big Mouth Peter he had a habit of speaking before he thought amen I know some people like that that's right he says Lord please all these people Peter zip it that's right this was different amen and so he looked around he discerned a house it was you and she was healed end of a problem that's right amen so you need to read about that in Luke chapter 8 Mark 5. um yeah so she she received her her healing now in Luke 19 we have some another guy that was waiting for Jesus now Jesus had been busy you know and the scripture says he went to Village to Village preaching and so he's coming through um coming through Jericho and somebody was there waiting for him right and all these people and the master said you know the Master's been tired been praying for sickness stand back a little bit but you see there's a man there he was short and so he had he not only was he short but he he had that name sort of a scene so he was always at the back of the line yes Zacchaeus and so his wife Rebecca they owned a restaurant and Jesus would stop there sometimes but Zacchaeus just couldn't get it together how can he be a prophet look at those sorry people he hangs around with and so um he heard he was coming so you've heard the story many times he gets up in the tree and where he can look down and get a good view and so with his you know great discernment he's going to tell whether it's a prophet or not and so Jesus coming along he stops right under the tree hi is Zacchaeus come on down I'm going to your house he'd been waiting amen now he got a result that he wasn't waiting for you know and um so then as he's leaving um uh what do we call a Jericho see all the all the towns had a wall around him he didn't have airplanes so if you're going to attack him you have to come through the gate so they had this wall around him and um so in the in the shadow of the wall there was a man waiting and his name was Bartimaeus and he um they didn't have German Shepherd dogs back then they had a lamb that they'd trained to take him to the wall and bring him back wow and so you know that was the Lamb's job and so he's in the shade of the wall and he can't see he's blind and he hears all this noise and so he's asking his um his buddy there what's all this noise about well it seems like there's a man coming by that they say is a prophet really yeah and his name is Jesus Jesus is here and you didn't tell me oh wow so he starts screaming out you know son of David have mercy on me it's another Mark chapter 10. and so Jesus couldn't hear him he's you know 100 yards away but he felt the cry amen and he came and healed him praise God so all these people were waiting for him now Jesus is leaving Jericho which is below sea level and he's coming up to Jerusalem okay A little path there's all these people with him the crowd is growing and um so the the the road it's about 24 miles and it climbs 3 600 feet it's all uphill because Jericho's below sea level and Jerusalem's up here and so they're going along and Jesus Takes a break and he sent his disciples over to the next village now all this is in your Bible okay and so he says now look over that other Village over there and you're going to find a um a donkey and that donkey's the mother donkey he's got a little white baby donkey with it and I need it now he's not making this up it wasn't because he was tired but it's because 500 years before a prophet said over in Zechariah 9 9 Rejoice daughter of Jerusalem thy King cometh unto thee he is just having salvation lowly that means he's humble and he's writing what Cadillac no Big White Horse no no no shiny new truck no riding on a cold the fold of an ass a small insignificant donkey that's right so a prophet said it and then time passes amen 500 years if you look at your you know history book 500 years ago was Martin Luther or you know Columbus and so forth so a lot of things can happen well if a prophet said this then the first guy that had a white donkey this is the one praise God this is the one wow and then down the road another guy had well which one is it amen they all died but finally there's one fulfillment a lot of interpretations only one fulfillment so the crowd was on the way to the temple screaming from Psalms 118 25 and 26. now in English we say hosanna in Spanish we say hosanna but they're saying Hosanna which means blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord so they're quoting scripture they're going along you know and they're putting branches down for him to walk on you know the donkey and so forth now the Romans were there they were the they were the highway patrol they were the policemen and they're just watching be sure everything's not out of control but they had no Revelation but there was also people waiting called Pharisees now Pharisees knew their prophet's Bible precisely they knew how many of those he said and how many uh they they had all that figured out you see and they were waiting in arrogance not in love and they were waiting for an opportunity to make Jesus smaller that was their job the manifested word of the hour to show a bad attitude and in Luke 19 39 says they jumped out in front of the you know the parades coming so they jumped out in front of the parade and um and they said now Master you need to calm these people down you know and we know that you're not the one that the scripture talks about you're just a bunch of Fanatics you know and um and um so we know that you're not that person now they knew their prophets words perfectly okay they didn't have iPad they didn't have a tape recorder they read they memorized all these years now they've been 400 years without a prophet and so they had a lot of traditions down this is the way it's got to be right you know and um they figured out that he wasn't the one that fit the description they were legalists yes they were afraid that somebody was going to be happy in church can't have that no all right scared to death that prophet's words might actually Bloom out and manifest into something amen we don't argue hey Prophet said now there's a time when it blooms out down here where it's warm all the time you don't know when things are going to bloom or not but up in the North Country there's those rose bushes and if it wasn't for the Thorns you wouldn't know what it is but then there comes a day when the flower comes out the pear tree produces wow and so today we have any number of people and you probably know some of them they're ready to listen or they'll listen 24 hours a day quote it word for word okay so far so good but scared to death that there might be a fulfillment of the prophetic word but it might actually Bloom out in something especially in a brother like Jack are you kidding me you know all right I don't know God is God glory he's going to manifest himself however he please right yeah and so um they are afraid that somebody's going to say this is that this is exactly what Mighty Prophet William Brown spoke of but see we're in a minority because we believe it doesn't matter who he uses what time of day God is God so Jesus was also waiting for his opportunity and he looked around he said now you see all these rocks boys I can tell these people to be quiet they'll be quiet but if I tell if I tell them to be quiet all these rocks are going to scream out brother Jack was over there picking up rocks hey you'd be surprised we had a guy over there once one of the trips and um we were in this Elijah's cave well it's a Catholic Church yes don't let that scare you thanks to the Catholics there's something to go look at because it was the Pentecostals like us that already took it all home so so it's Catholic okay they have candles so we get back on the bus and this guy's got black what are you doing well I was looking for a loose Rock and Elijah's cave yeah thousands of millions people have been through there and you're going to find a loose Rock I can write a book but anyway that's right um so there's some of the rocks are still there that's right you know and I don't want any Rock taking my place the friends we walk by faith not by sight but God does encourage us from time to time and he lets us see a little evidence he does answer our prayers yes no a little later and so um we um we know that God is in charge now our only desire is to please God with our thoughts our words our Deeds you see we're directed by his holy spirit brother Adam says you will have difficulty with this flesh until the day he calls you home now there's some smooth sailing and there's more Hills and Valleys but we are going someplace you see and um by by Grace every believer will overcome and so um it's a dark world but the scripture says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony his blood and your life once you manifest your reactions to the testing you see God could put everything in order in our lives before lunchtime fill your bank account you know give you another another car you do a lot of things things you think are a problem yeah bring your waiver children back you can do all that but he lets it go on and on and on and he's watching for your reactions how do you react to the test so what are you reflecting here in dark laodicea what it depends what you're feeding on right if you're going to feed on the news you're going to go crazy if you're going to look at the stock market report you know it's not going to work right you know so you must be balanced in spirit and in truth like Jesus told the woman at the well God is seeking those that worship Him in spirit and in truth it's going to be balanced you can have you can have all kinds of spirit oh man we tore the church down we wrecked the chairs we tore up the organ and then what had to buy more you know that's right or you can have all kinds of Truth oh man we got it down tight but no manifestation it's got to be balanced it's got to be balanced Okay so what um what about your children what do they see in you because children record everything remember those days when they were amen and they let it out at the strangest times amen yeah I like your grandma's house but uh what does your wife see in you she knows you best amen what does your unconverted neighbor see does he see a Christian or some kind of fanatic always quoting William Branham they don't care about William Branham they want to see the Life of Christ in you you know so uh just live your message and those that are anointed that you know they'll ask questions but you can't refer them all to brother Jack you've got to have answers you've got to go to your Bible and show them the five comings of Elijah and we're over here and the next one's coming get ready so II Peter 1 19 we have also more sure word of Prophecy under who you do well under which you do well to take heed as unto a light that shines in a dark place until the day star arise in your hearts so we got to stay balanced we got to stay steady and um we've got to stay in step with the beat and the rhythm of the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ okay but you must maintain the vertical I see like this thing here it's Pulpit now the vertical that is your prayer life that's the long part of the cross you do your part you stay in prayer God will take care of the horizontal okay let's see what the prophet says here in 1965. uh a man running from the presence of the Lord now this is February 17th of 1965. and it just so happens that brother Brown had promised the people I will come back I will preach on merge and divorce I'll let you know so he let him know that there's going to be four services in that week in the middle of February so that you know they're living in Tucson the kids are in school and um so he drove back by himself now when he when he when he traveled by himself he uh he was just wears his boots and some blue jeans and stuff and he wouldn't even stop at a hotel he'd go when he got tired he would take a power nap this stops in place 10 15 minutes ready to go keep going so he arrived back there in Jeffersonville early hours of Wednesday morning and the first service isn't until Thursday evening it'll be Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday and so he's up there at the house by himself in Jeffersonville and um he uh he thought well I can't stay up here all the people around the church Wednesday night I'll go down there and maybe gather some inspiration well when they seen him come in brother Neville said hey bro Bill compare so he doesn't have anything he's not prepared church is tomorrow night so he goes up there and preaches this great message a man running from the presence of the Lord and he says I believe we have truth I'm satisfied of that I believe the wheat absolutely the shuck is pulling away from it great kernels of Truth here so we don't have to wonder whether this is true or not amen a Vindicated Prophet said it's true you might not understand all the things he says but the only thing you got to believe is an angel did meet him and sent him and you know he brought the truth so God says so has been Vindicated around the world and even after all these years brother Brown's been gone over 50 years it's still the truth it's still being Vindicated everywhere you see and so it's it's being it's out there in many languages so we should respect this ministry and not lean to our own understanding well I think it's like this I don't care what you think we got people preaching right now well we don't need William Brandon anymore we'll just go over here oh that's not right Spirit that's right amen no um people are trying to figure out the things they don't like or things not according to their you know Methodist understanding whatever right so may God have mercy on these people so we gotta we got to stay in Balance not go to extremes it just takes a little bit and got to stay balanced amen now brother random sister took the Catholics 2 000 years to get to where they are today it says it took Pentecost 50 years to accomplish the same thing that's right so the amount of followers are Malachi 4 are in trouble amen we've been at over 50 years now you see and so um many tonight today are in worse condition than some of the Pentecost was with the Catholics because they're an idolatry you see it's it's not the fault of the messenger wow it's because of unbalanced teaching yes sir so if you start teaching you know for whatever reason just start going eventually your way out here amen and then there's no fellowship with anybody else you're the only ones going that's right that's crazy that's right so they're wandering away from the original speculating wow so imagine trying to build a house without a without a level amen if you have marbles going every which way you know it doesn't work that's right so um we um we think well what about these extremes I've been police I've seen extremes okay we got people today in some places in the planet that are burning candles to weigh Brandon's picture they're kneeling and praying now they've been exposed to unbalanced teachings but God is watching after his seed okay yeah they're doing this because they're not doing what Paul said and not saying what brother Branham said not paying attention to Galatians chapter 1. Paul had been on this missionary trip now maybe next time I come we'll get into the book of Acts but Paul traveled over ten thousand miles in 30 years he didn't have an SUV right no he walked okay wow and so he had been to a certain area and there's fruit people and you know baptized and so forth he comes back a few months later and these people were already you know out of balance they were going in another Direction yes he said what's wrong with you people where you're going is zero there's only one gospel amen he said Hey in fact he said if I come back next week or if Silas or Jack Duff or whoever comes back and preaches something different than what I've already given you by revelation going down amen and so we got people today everywhere saying things are in the Bible they're not no tape anywhere and we got problems but see that has to be God has a way of luring people let them go that way that's what they're called so Matthew uh Matthew 24 24 is real there's that is a real Spirit okay so God is not nervous everything is on schedule you know what time did you get in last night 12 12. yeah but you were depending on that plane getting there at the right time so God's program is all on schedule it's going to happen so let's go ahead here and see if we can get finished here so the solution is back to the sure word of Prophecy right here now you don't understand it we'll read it again you don't understand it ask the pastor God put five Ministries in the church to for the Perfection to bring the church to the Rapture okay so extreme is very dangerous and um we don't want to lean during understanding and let's see here there are there are forces at work today they were here when William Brown was here you see I'm going to be 78 years old in a few months so I remember back then there was people that were right there they look like red hot followers but they were they were already on the wrong track oh wow they could repeat the words but the spirit was wrong wow you see and so there's people today with that same anointing they can well they can quote it but there's a there's there's a spirit about it it ain't right amen see and they're they're separating out the deity of Jesus Christ and that causes confusion you see brother REM says over here on um great servant Moses as Moses went with that judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could have ever gotten that little little stick out of Moses hands he they would have had him whipped and when the devil can ever get the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ he's got the church whip amen and I know some of those people they only want Victory kids are going crazy because unbalanced teaching it's got to be right okay so there's forces that were there they're still here today and um it only causes confusion causes doubt it takes the people away from Jesus Christ now this this level has another purpose see one thing is you know but now if I see anybody trying to go to sleep laughs it usually works so in Isaiah chapter 40 it speaks about waiting they that wait and that's not everybody but those that wait upon the Lord they'll renew their strength Mount up with wings as Eagles run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint so one of God's favorite methods of preparing us for something great is to send us into the Shadows to wait okay that doesn't mean you're doomed to to terminal Darkness right there's a British author that said waiting is a common instrument of providential discipline for those to whom exceptional work has been appointed who should have thought of that but it's true you see and like you quoted earlier Esther Now esther is a very special person back here in the Old Testament okay don't forget we got four steps to talk about balance so Esther was a just another Jewish girl in the crowd that got taken away to Babylon and um it's a great love story of God's providential care how he cares for his own and guess what in the Book of Esther God has not mentioned one that's right brother what you're doing there God is in control he doesn't depend on us you know and so by but God's choice she became Queen and was able to deliver the Jewish people from destruction God is always in control he doesn't have to consult with us you know so she was just another believer that waited and in chapter 4 16 uh her hour of decision came you know and there seems to be a blank spot for three days from uh verse 17 to chapter 5 verse one nothing's recorded in that part of the drama nothing's happening but it was during this time that she was fasting she was praying seeking the mind of Jehovah because she's getting ready to step off into who knows where you know and during this time she was probably reading the book of Isaiah which was written 300 years before her wow where it says fear thou not I am with thee be not as maid I am thy God I will strengthen the yea I will help Thee I will uphold thee with my right hand yes Lord behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing for the uh and they that strive with thee Shall Perish she found her identification in the Bible amen not you know TV the Bible so when the believer over here in our age is in tune with the spirit of God you're doing all that you know to do that believer can identify with the portion that applies and you will see how God will make the word come alive in your life might maybe something small I've seen many things happen you see and God can bring circumstances around that you haven't you couldn't imagine putting people in your life you know so you might be going through some blank days like she was where we've seen that nothing's happening but it's during those times that you need to find balance with prayer and reading God's word and you can't every one of you you everyone you can create an atmosphere depends on your attitude how you answer your mother how you react to things you create an atmosphere and it's time like that that you you could say well I'm not rushing into uncertain things I have no direction I can't find my way I'll just wait and see how God wrecks he has a way okay the God of this evil age August of 1965. now this day is very important because I was there I was there for some of those services in July of 1965. I was sitting that close when he's preaching 91s at the end time wow and of course I was young I was focused on the girl not on a message I was still still looking at the bait you know but um that was on a Sunday August 1st and I knew that we were going to be driving back to Tucson that week so that evening I asked brother M will there be time for you to baptize me correctly before we go back oh sure well he'd been waiting three years for that you know so he took me down on Monday morning and he baptized me correctly and turns out that was the last person he baptized wow well anyway on this message in the morning of uh August 1st says here she as the Bride is a part of the groom true to him in every Point waiting for the wedding and uniting not at the economical Council but in the sky at the wedding supper she has been given and has been revealed to her the seven sealed Mysteries of the Bible she sees the Folly of the deceiver okay we're talking about the bride she's Wide Awake she sees all this she sees the seven sealed Mysteries of the Bible she sees the Folly of the deceiver which is so close to the truth almost deceives the elect she sees it says see the two opposing spirits that work in this evil age can you see it each very religious Cain and able Spirits again coming to their head or their full manifestation safe still the same as they started out no change the Same Spirit just more mature it seems um says the one worshiped by Beauty and knowledge education science and ethics all sounds real good I mean look at this school you know it sounds good and the other one by faith of the revelation of the word of God whether she knows that she knows both of them are standing right in this building this morning oh wow see a prophet could he could discern that he knew that some of them people are just make Believers you know and so he says both of them in the standing in this building this morning the one is a prostitute the Bible says she's the mother of harlots they all come together and that kind of a woman is a woman that's untrue to her husband and claiming Christ as her husband and belonging to a denomination such nonsense saying we belong to Christ and this area is full of large churches we belong to Christ that's right there's people right here on the same grounds claiming the same thing I have no idea what the Bible says amen amen um but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride a person here they're off somewhere else another church some other denomination wherever it is she believes the word of God Amen right now we happen to have a bunch of them together here but they're spread out everywhere they're everywhere she believes the word of God obedient see where we at here uh she's obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed amen now if you're waiting for something to be confirmed you have to know the something first all right you know you're thinking of some of you already thinking about KFC because you've been there and you know exactly what and if they left out one of those 11 ingredients you're going to know it so she's waiting for the promise of the age to be confirmed so you got to know what the promise of the age is we're not building an ark no we're not walking in the streets of gold just yet we're in laodicea you see says she is watching for it she is part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word amen don't worry about everybody else see we know that in every group of people there's three kinds of believers don't worry about this one who are you man yeah that's one to concentrate on so uh that's where he mentions waiting in law okay so she's not looking for the flaws and others oh you should do this and you should do that in your hair you know no she's not like that no uh not looking for doctrinal differences yeah but those people over there you know it's our age of perfection we're headed up to this peak and we're all we're looking at the flaws and everybody else just take care of yourself she's part of that word watching for her life to manifest that word amen that's the secret you see so if anything is out of order just wait God will bring correction at the right time with the right spirit thank you so quote she is watching for her life to manifest that word not slamming and correcting everybody no waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed watching for her life to manifest that word so may God help us I'm just reminding you what he said you know I've come up with a few sayings in my short lifetime illustrious preaching doesn't always translate into Victorious living wow wow how many brothers Jack knows people man they got a gift that's right mow everybody down that's right but turn them loose on the freeway let's see what kind of Life they live I'd rather walk you know so um William Branham lived what he preached I was not attracted by The Miracles wow I was attracted by the fact that a man lived the spirit of the scripture because the Bible is the ultimate that that's where it's all at and he lived it now he didn't waste any time he didn't uh he never took time to slam those that didn't believe it exactly his way I mean you have a woman coming in the prayer line she's obviously a woman preacher he prays for amen he doesn't kick her out he was a gentleman so I hope that you can see yourself in the mirror here somewhat today and that God gives you a peace that goes beyond the things you understand so we understand at a certain point I don't understand how those cars work I know you push the button and it goes but there's all kinds of intricate things yes I don't have to understand all that that's right so God's peace is beyond the things you understand his peace goes beyond the legalism and the religious fanaticism God promises that all things work together for good to for those that love God and are called according to his purpose you see so don't waste your time or your pastor's time trying to figure things out leave it alone relax wait in love for the manifestation of the promise in your life amen just just leave it alone yeah brother Brown says here [Music] um in uh 1955 the Devils Tremble When the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devil's tremble amen it ought to be that when you when your feet land on the on the floor in the morning they're back amen so the devil knows when it's from the teeth out you know he knows when you're serious he's not deaf now brother Randall had to wait he didn't have all the answers at all times he was human you see and so when he was ready to preach Seven Seals everybody's waiting you know everything's ready he comes by Billy Paul's office he sent a bill if he ever prayed for Daddy right now I don't know what I'm going to say to these people he had to walk by faith now uh the new ministry so we got here that you might know that Sovereign Grace reigns with God did you know that those two boys sister had his boys that woman's children that were saved God knew that before the foundation of the world the same for each of you God knew that you'd be sitting here with those clothes on before the world was even formed exactly right amen um yeah their names are on the Lamb's Book alive the Bible says that it only had to come down to this minute see did you know that God knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever formed did you know that he uh he knew we'd be standing here this morning the infant is to see of God um knew every fly every Nat every mosquito every cockroach all those details you know he knew why Jack put on a white shirt today yes amen you know all these details he knew all that before the world was formed and um and so he says now so you say well if he knows all that why are you preaching that's part of God's program yeah preaching is his program when he looked upon the on the apostles and he looked upon the Harvest he said the Harvest is right and the labors are few pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into his Harvest he says here why would they have to pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers into his Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing how it would be done good question he says God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and me and as long as we're as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his amen so because of your little excuses and you know sometimes too scared to step out my faith in other words you're you're wanting to do something for the missionary work but lowered that hundred dollars you know I got to take the family well this is the whole thing is a life of sacrifice if you'll step out by faith God will bless you so many ways you know and so as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves under the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing his program so just follow God's leading he will provide every time so let's see if we can wind this up here um you know many times we've rehearsed the scene of Abraham and Sarah living there under in that tent under the oak tree remember the whole story they moved they're under this big oak tree and they're there and the uh three uh people came by and you fixed them lunch and all that it's near Hebron which is south of Jerusalem and um and guess what the tree's still there most people have records of 5 000 years of that tree when I was there in uh 1984. there's still some green leaves on it so it's real but these people waited they waited in love not knowing it would be another 25 years when when God told them your time of life and so forth well they're expecting the child in nine months no long ER and that's why we got people flaking off today because well it's too long where's the promise of his coming you know and so they returned back young not just to have the child but because God said so see and so God can do anything so brother REM says he showed in Abraham and Sarah what he's going to do to you and your wife one of these days turn you back young again we are the seat of Abraham on our road to the promise I take uh well I say it humbly but my wife is waiting she's already turned young she's waiting for me now that might be words to some people but you see whenever uh whenever she was very aware ill maybe two weeks before she left I said look you're not just anybody you lived with the prophet of God for all those years you know what faith is you know what Miracles are and you know that God can put you back brand new next 20 minutes it can happen but if he chooses to take you well then you look for your dad and wait for me there amen Simple Solution amen well time goes on time passes you know so about two years ago a friend of mine that we work with a lot in the missionary work he called me early one morning of course he only speaks Spanish and uh he said he's crying man I have this dream well tell me about it well so in this dream he's in heaven and he's talking to William Branham I said wait a minute he doesn't speak Spanish you don't speak English yeah but we were talking so it's another language and um and he's so he had a lot of questions and they were talking and um so um he uh and you notice this young girl on brother brown right right beside him he looked at her I know that's Rebecca you know young and so she gives him a big smile she says you tell George I'm right where he told me to wait so it's real [Applause] so all we're trying to do is make Christ real to the people we're not trying to give you a shortcut or a pass because you're you know jacked Up's grandson or whatever no we're all going to go the same route you know and um so brother Brown says that some Greek Believers you know they had heard now they wanted to see Jesus we would like to see Jesus and so they'd already heard but they wanted to know more now God doesn't send entertainers he he sends preachers to preach his word amen amen well you know the whole story about the about the uh man that went out west to find the bride and so forth right look her troubles weren't from the next Village it was the same house all her troubles were right there so uh God knows what he's doing and so we waited his door with prayer we waited his foot with humility we waited his table with service and we wait at his window with expectancy now the four steps to get to Balanced Life every day from the youngest yeah you're right there on the second row every day you read one chapter of the Bible now you can do an order don't just jump around with it go through there one chapter of the Bible you read one page out of your church Facebook get serious okay read one chapter of the Bible read one page out of your church age book you listen to at least 20 minutes of God's Prophet it's on every phone on the planet and you pray four steps and with that I guarantee you your life will be more balanced you'll have a better attitude and the church will prosper okay may God bless you [Applause] I certainly thank God for our precious brother just passing our way and I remember the last time brother George came it gave us those four steps and and I remembered the the one page out of the church age book I remembered the prayer and I I believe um you know reading a chapter of the Bible but I am adding the um uh uh less than 20 minutes to God's profit every day right this is what brings you balance and everything so I I hope you all wrote that down if y'all didn't I'm in the process of writing this down I'm gonna have this and and we're gonna we're gonna use this uh this is what maintains balance brother George we appreciate you [Music] [Applause] um there was a very very there's many things that he said but one of the things that probably um Minister's ministers to me the most and uh I believe it's something that he probably got from being there with with brother Brown is the humility and which uh brother brother George brings the word of God all I felt today is that he was pointing us to Christ just just just point us directly to Jesus I mean this you know I don't even I don't even know how to say it but being the son-in-law of a prophet not and and I want to go a little further it's not you know this is a prophet that was uh promise according to scripture that would come to the Earth you go to the Book of Malachi chapter 4 and God said I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord God said that in his word and um uh so there had to be somebody that would come on Earth that would be the Fulfillment also according to Revelation 10 7 it says that when the seventh angel would begin to sound all the mysteries of God would be finished so so we see that somebody had to fulfill this and and you know I always tell people this I said you know if brother Branham brother William Miriam Branham was not the Fulfillment of that then just show me who it is that's all I mean I just believe it was his ministry that fulfilled it right and if he's not we let's agree to this that this is a promise in God's word and it must happen in this time right so God sent this Prophet called him off the scene in 1965 life but uh so many great things like brother George said he's got a church age books in his car if you don't know anything everything we believe about this message was revealed in that church age book everything every doctrine that that people have come up with it is in that church age book and always try to tell people go back there go back to that church age book uh in order to prove what you're trying to say I just recently had a conversation deal with somebody we were dealing with the subject of the seven Thunders and what I realized uh is that this brother would actually uh put down the church age book and he would make a statement like this he says well uh I believe the church age book but you know it's not the voice of the Prophet speaking it I only want to hear the voice of the prophet and what he was trying to tell me is that he's discrediting the church age book right but brother Brandon watched over that book for a very specific purpose and it was a reason why God allowed the book to be completed in 1965 December 1965 and at the end of its completion God called him home everything we believe you will find it in churches but if you're trying to get an understanding on a revelation go back to what he said what he allowed to be written oh I can go many places with that I can go many places you know even your Bible you can't go you can't stand up and tell anybody I just want to hear the voice of Moses I want to hear the voice of Paul you know you came to you got to believe it by faith and same thing with that church Ace Book right but in there brother random told us that the uh the Thunders were the Mysteries contained to end the Seven Seals not just one but all Seven Seals he says they were the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals and that was his Prophet I mean it was the prophet's duty to reveal that to the people oh church we got we got we got we gotta we got something precious in our hands and um and I thank God for it I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them amen amen [Music] um I'll say this too that I I want to remain humble um I mean uh I I do appreciate the fact that we've had many ministers to pass through our Pulpit I appreciate that and um you know I appreciate the ministers that we even have here in this church like I told you earlier brother Quaker was scheduled to preach today but he when I told them the change was like brother I'm local don't worry about that well it'll be another time for me I appreciate a heart like that I appreciate the spirit like that you know and I believe God got great blessings in store for our precious brother and it's not the first time that he's done it it I mean there's been other times somebody else passes through and he'll he'll he'll just give the pulpit over so I'm I'm grateful God bless you brother quick who amen we appreciate you uh God is good God is good next Sunday we have our brother Nathan Erickson uh he'll be coming to minister for us he called me up and said hey I'm Gumby and Cocoa Beach for a uh a conference on my job and he says I looked it up and I see him about an hour and a half away from him said yeah yeah brother brother Solomon do that with no problem brother you can come so uh brother Nathan Eric is going to be with us on next next week from Ohio and uh I'm just going to be enjoying each gift that God sends amen our way so let's just have a word of prayer amen father we are so appreciative of the word of the Lord today Lord I just believe it was a a perfect word for where we are right now God we need to wait in love don't get ahead of you don't get too excited just wait this love Lord just this uh demon of thought we'd been talking about that to different Brothers where you you always have an answer to prayer sometimes this yes sometimes it's no and sometimes it's just a little later not now Lord we thank you for the confirmation that you've brought here through your servant Lord and him just getting himself out of the way and allowing you to speak through him to us we receive Lord what heaven brought to us today we trust o God that you would bless our precious brother brother George that you would Lord restore and give back to him all that he has given out and we actually God that as he even goes tonight they're at a Boynton Beach to minister may you use them for the congregation there and we trust Lord Jesus that uh that they would be Lord and a fact by the word of God thank you for the saints that have gathered Lord here today those that watched online we thank you for them we know that people have um Lord just just received strength through the word of God today and uh it's it's this word that is challenging us and changing us and Lord even as we would uh or leave the service let us be mindful of these things that will keep us balanced one chapter out of the Bible one page out of the church age book 20 minutes of the Prophet every day and God prayer father these these four things that have been given to us Lord are things that would help us in the journey so Lord we just pray that we would Embrace this and that Lord we would just draw closer to you we pray that you would keep us all until we're able to come back together again in this place in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord I do need to meet with the church so if you all would just remain seated let me just greet brother George but brother Solomon you can come and just lead us in a couple songs amen while we're when we're doing that and God bless you yes Lord yes Lord yes to your will Wednesday your guest I will trust you and obey speaks to me my whole heart I'll agree [Music] say I'll say yes Lord yes to your will and to your way I say yes Lord yes I will trust you and Obey when your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I'll dream and my answer oh yes come on one more time oh I'll say yes Lord yes to your will oh I'll
