to have the meetings there they're not going to host them at his church in july so he just said that they just needed to cancel so uh just want to make you aware of that and there are a number of other meetings that will be held in the next few weeks and we've tried to place all of them on the board i know uh brother keith brown was having meetings this weekend brother jason watkins next

you can be a part of it anything that you can that'll be great and um i did want to give you a brother capers called me on last week and said please tell the church who said god bless you uh they certainly appreciate your prayers sister sister cables is doing much better i was told that the doctors say she has been the best patient uh that he has had and uh just the lord is really touching her and she's uh she's coming along very well so continue to keep them in prayer man as they uh she recuperates and one other last thing i want to just make mention of um some of the saints that approached me we you all know that brother brother uh kwaku his father passed away and uh he'll be um going in a few weeks going back home and they'll be bearing his father and everything and and some of the saints that i mentioned that they would love to be able to give towards just that and i thought it would be a good idea he's one of the ministers here in the church and he we feed from him quite often and uh so i just wanted to encourage you if you'd like to just help me i know he's going to be leaving in a couple weeks if you'd like to help him just take one of the envelopes that's there on the table and just make sure you you're right uh offering for brother kwaku and we'll make sure that he gets it amen but just put it on one of the envelopes there and just put it inside the box and we'll be sure to give it to him uh just to be a blessing to him and his family in this time of their loss so keep that in mind all right let's turn here to acts chapter 2 and we will start reading um at verse 15. amen the lord is good amen verse 15 um says i'm sorry go to verse 14 i'm sorry uh but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them the men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk and as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel amen i just think to myself trust the lord will endow us and we'll have the similar experience amen here in our midst as they had on the day of pentecost this is a promise for our day verse 17 says and it shall come to pass and the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord to come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on that that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a brief word of prayer father we are certainly privileged to be able to come into the house of god and as we come we trust that you god amen would just reveal yourself to us we have felt your presence in the uh worship this time of worship lord we felt your presence and now as we enter into this time to receive the word speak from heavens uh it's been requested time and time again speak omnipotence speak to our needs speak to our circumstances speak to our situations speak in only way that you can and father uh let us leave here uh with hearts burning knowing that we have been in the presence of almighty god may we leave change by your spirit and may we have a heart to draw closer to you father uh is our prayer it's in jesus name we ask him amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen praise the lord i did want to acknowledge our precious sisters dairy man uh good to have you all and fellowship with us on today amen um we uh off a couple things i probably should have mentioned as well i want to thank everybody for their support on last week and coming out to the meetings there the combined service meetings we had a wonderful time there at uh brother brother jeans brother louis jeans uh we had a a wonderful time and thank you all for just praying for us that god would just give us strength i was drained when i left a church on sunday night and i went to sleep when i got home and and i don't think i woke up to after nine o'clock the next day something like that but it was it was probably a much needed rest and and then that following day we had the the picnic which was a real blessing i want to thank you all again for you know just making that a success everyone that prepared a meal and uh appreciate uh the brothers a man and contributing to the meat and brother uh stephen and brother garren took on undertook the task of repairing the meat and we certainly appreciate those brothers for doing that it was a real real blessing amen we thank god thank god thank god uh so amen amen praise the lord so uh we are going to continue our journey uh here in this this sixth junction we uh got started on that a little bit last week and and i was bringing to you all um you know just just uh uh just an understanding that the prophet uh told us that there were kind of like six events that he saw in scripture uh that he would consider junctions amen uh what or what we call like great changes that were taking place and um you know noah in the ark was one of those moses and the children of israel coming out of egypt was another big junction uh abraham and a lot the destruction of sodom gomorrah but got calling abraham out and i mean calling lot out and god changing the body of abraham and sarah during that time to receive the promised son that was another major junction elijah and the 450 prophets of baal was a major junction when jesus came to earth the very first time that was also a major junction which was the fifth junction and uh and then we talked uh started last week because he said the sixth junction was martin luther and john wesley now now the both of those events happen at separate times in uh church history if we can put it that way both of those events happen at separate times there was a time that god allowed martin luther to come on the earth and he gave him a very specific ministry of the just shall live by faith uh martin luther was completely uh just you know actually the man was in the pulpit preaching without even being saved and uh once he had a a conversion experience and god began to reveal his word to him uh martin luther come to the point is like you know what he was a catholic priest he was a catholic priest and he says you know what what what my church is doing what what i'm supporting here in my church is catholic church it's against the word of god right and martin luther uh began to thunder out from his pulpit things that he saw that the church was doing but the word said something different and it says you know we can't keep doing this something something's wrong uh with this picture here uh we're gonna be judged by what god said in his word not by what some priest said right so so martin luther got anointed to write 95 theses and after he preached it from his pulpit he stepped out went to the catholic church door and nailed this 95 thesis to the catholic church church store on october 31st and the 1500s and you know and and every time october 31st comes by a lot of people always have in mind uh halloween amen but as a believer i can't help but have in my mind what happened with martin luther glory to god i ain't gonna let the devil take that holiday amen but i i like to celebrate what god did through martin luther by by nailing that 9-5 thesis to the door what what he was doing was protesting protesting the catholic church protesting the teachings of the church protesting amen these things that uh that they they were sharing and you know and and it was against the word of god martin luther decided to protest it it took an anointing for that man to protest that you realize back in church history and i'm using a lot of that as we preach this sermon but in church history uh during that time if you were not catholic you were good as dead right if you did not agree with the catholic church you would die hallelujah we don't we don't realize what uh people had to go through for us to get to where we are today plus to be able to come into the church and even preach things like this if i if i were to preach something like this in the 1400s and 1500 i might be dead after the sermon right but but we have i mean martin luther's anointing that he was on the brought us a freedom that we're expect that we're experiencing today and we thank god for the ministry of martin luther but brother branham said it was martin luther and john wesley that was considered the sixth junction now uh the other thing i just want to say this before i get into john wesley today there was a statement that the prophet made about martin luther and um and and i just want to just touch it just a little bit uh this is out of the message that greater than solomon is here uh greater than solomon is here just a little something that he said and i didn't read this last week but uh but he made this comment he says uh luther many of you lutheran people why history claims it wasn't a mystery i have this on the front and on the back says it wasn't a mystery they said many of you luther's people while history claims it wasn't a mystery how that martin luther protested the catholic church and got by with it he says but how he could hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed the revival right so so so what we get out of this little statement here is that when martin luther was protesting the catholic church god had anointed his ministry to stand up and and and try to carry the people back to work now he couldn't take bring him back to a complete place of restoration but he was able to be used as a reformer glory to god hallelujah but but here we we we we see something here is that you know that you can take that down the big thing here in martin luther's ministry as he was protesting is that martin luther had the ability oh hallelujah to keep his head above the fanaticism now i say that and i want to draw just a little attention there because as message believers in this hour this message that we follow glory to god if you just do a google search out there you'll see all kind of fanaticism and this is why people don't want to come to the message but there's a group of people that god has placed on their earth that can keep their head hallelujah above the fanaticism brother i'm not looking at the fanatics i'm looking at the truth i'm not concerned about fanatics as soon as i hear it if somebody take off going in the direction i ain't got to follow that i don't care who they are and what they titled i ain't got the fall of fanaticism i'm gonna stay with this word hallelujah glory to god there's so much fanaticism that follows this message you know our our introduction to the message glory to god just just to jeff just for you to be sitting here the way you sitting here right now it shows that somehow somewhere down the line you overcame all the fanaticism you overcame and still overcoming because we all got introduced to fanaticism in this message people will point us in all types of directions it's the truth any high they told me the seven thunders was the seven virtues brother branham never says that but i would just follow me because that's what they were saying and when somebody would ask you a question what the thumbnails are you had no answer but all we had to do is say what the prophet said he said the seventh thunders all the revelations that's contained in the seven seals not just one seal but every seal hallelujah as the thunders were other than their voices the revelations was unfolding to us that's what the prophet told us if we had others you know said uh they had a teaching out in arizona there was a a church that had seven preachers in him they say these seven preachers are the seven thunders right you know you had some telling us that uh glory to god uh you know we pretty much that there was nothing else for us to look forward to because we had to wait for brother branham to come back we had all kind of stuff but it was fanaticism oh yeah i mean you know that there's there there's so much that that that that we had to shake ourselves from people that don't want to fellowship fanaticism i had somebody call me one time and say uh don't fellowship with them they shuck believe us you telling me believers are shocked no i'm not gonna go with that and then put my own family in there now you taking my promise from me right holler hey you got to be able to recognize i don't care who is coming from i don't care what their title is hallelujah i don't care how long they've been in ministry if they preaching fanaticism then that's exactly what it is oh glory to god there's so much more that we don't found ourselves through it's many many more i i i i i'm gonna just say this while i'm here because and and it might and if it get me in trouble that's fine i'm gonna just tell you go read the quote right but some of the fanaticism that uh a young sister could not have a necklace that was fanaticism oh y'all ain't gonna preach with me a young sister her husband had to buy it for no no wait a minute that's not what the prophet said let's look at some of these things look here here's what i say let's look at all the prophets said not just one quote don't bring that here because it puts the church in the wrong position hallelujah we we have to rise above fanaticism and the holy spirit has anointed us to keep our heads above fanaticism you couldn't celebrate christmas you couldn't even fellowship with your own family at christmas time because of fanaticism oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me somebody's done lost family members along the way they don't want nothing to do with the church come on church we had to keep our head above this fanaticism i'm not saying get lost in this stuff now there's a balance that you can find and what we had is a lot of unbalanced things that was being brought to us there's another thought out there says that if if uh uh you know brother branham said that if a man's wife uh left him then that'll take him out that'll take him out of pulpit now if you read the quote the quote actually say they'll take me out not that will take me out they'll take me out who is there now i didn't say god was taking them out it's the people that did that read the quote but see here's the thing we don't we don't hurt fanatical preachers right we don't listen to it but did not go back and see what the prophet said about it no no no i'ma just i'm gonna have to drop some bombs if y'all don't mind because i mean he said luther and wesley and if y'all did some research on wesley's life it should have took him out the pulpit based on your understanding oh glory to god if y'all just do i ain't gonna share too much but you can do the research he had marital problems wesley wife dragon dragging him across the room by his hair marital problems a messenger a star in the hand of jesus marital problems do your research all right we have to keep our head above some fanaticism it it it takes a lot to try to keep your head above and try to rightly divide the scripture right don't just lean one way or the other somebody tell me if my one of my children uh backslide in my house and not serving lord then i shouldn't preach anymore now wait a minute wait a minute there comes a certain time where they're responsible for their own sins i can't make them live i mean they can be coming here looking one way and then living some i can't make they got to stand before god for themselves i just do my part i train up a child and the way they should go when they get old they won't depart that's what god told me now i can't make them be saved they got to come to that realization that they need christ for themselves and i pray god will send trial after trial and test out that test until that child gets broken down flat on their back when they realize they need jesus glory to god amen fanaticism it's a lot of fanaticism lots lots lots lots lots less and it's most stuff that y'all probably can tell me about but we're trying to keep our head above this there there is a truth to this message there's a truth and you got to find that that that that middle line and just walk there don't worry about what this one's saying what that one's saying and that's why many people are all caught up today and that's why they're not they're not worshipping in spirit and truth the way they need to because they got caught up in fanaticism fanaticism all you need is go back and look at it for yourself hallelujah oh glory to god all right so uh i'm just uh moving you know here from luther because this this the sixth junction two great ministries that occurred was the ministry of luther and the ministry of wesley right and uh both of these uh would be considered uh uh reformers but also i don't want to minimize the fact because we off we often you know i saw we pushed as the reformer part but they saw something in the word to be able to elevate them a little higher than everybody else hallelujah right so they also were seizures they were seers because the lamb had seven eyes on the seven horns and i has to be able to see glory to god amen and i know that they walk in all the truth luther certainly been walking on the true luther still uh baptizing in in the name of father son and holy ghost he didn't have all the truth it showed that he was lacking something and by him lacking something it showed we needed more god allowed him to lack something so to show that we needed a little bit more but the restoration process from god began in luther's ministry all right let's let's stop let's start here amen if we can i i want to try to get a couple things in uh on friday night we listened to the tape uh to whom shall we go and we were blessed by you know the prophet just preaching and man the anointing uh uh glory to god i mean there's about 150 people in church in it and then folk got to praising god it felt like thousands they almost stole the service from the prophet just worshiping right just one person getting healed it just you just my just i mean what i'm sitting there in my house like man i wish i was at that service just an anointing that was there we know god was with his prophet right and uh but he he brought some truth before the anointing came and it says um there were seven reasons why we need to come to jesus seven reasons why we should come to jesus he said the first reasons because jesus is the way hallelujah the second reason jesus is the truth jesus is the light now now that this may seem simple but i want to go a little deeper if i can with some of those things jesus is the way jesus is the truth come on let me just just a little bit because you know uh oftentimes we serve god with our emotions we worship with our emotions i'm about to lose this one i don't know i feel hear something glory to god uh but but that you know i don't know why that's happening let me get you let me get another i hear a feedback or something let me just take that one out you know sometimes the devil fights you with the microphones and all kind of stuff yeah just so praise the lord all right one go down we pick up another but we serve god oftentimes from our emotions uh we will look at people who say well they read the bible uh they must love god they don't read the bible more than that and read the bible now just because they read the bible don't mean they walking in the way just because they read the bible don't mean they walk in according to truth oh hallelujah jesus is the way jesus is the truth jesus is the light you can have a bible amen under your arms and still walking in darkness reading it every day but still living in darkness you have to follow jesus who is the way the truth and the life now it's more than just coming to an altar hallelujah somebody because there's many churches today gonna have a lot of people at the altar they're gonna be recording each and every number this name got saved in that name let me tell you something when you come down and sit at an altar or kneel at an altar sit in the chair that's not the thing you got saved hallelujah amen it might been the day that you recognized that salvation was brought to you but if you were seed of god you were saved before the foundation of the world and if you're saving for the finished world then you can't be lost on this side god ain't gonna save you there and lose you here oh i love i love my lord no matter what you go through god ain't gonna save you there and lose you here now what happens is that we think that because this person do this this person do that that they they got something but if they can't walk according to the truth they're missing everything brother jack how can you say that it's uh it's more than that it's more than just you know knowing that jesus is the way jesus is the truth jesus life it's more than just worship it's worth more than just going to altar the reason i can say that because the very first two people or uh uh uh four people adam eve uh cain and abel um kane brought an offering to an altar abel brought an offering to an altar they i just want you to see them both going up to the altar see them coming down their hearts are broken crying and snotting i'm bringing my my best to god this is lord this is what i grew for you this is this is i mean i lord i saved the best i was looking at and i thought i would take that for myself say but no i'm gonna save this for god at an altar and then he here came come with us his fruits and vegetables and his brother coming with a bloody lamb and looking at his brother saying you know god ain't gonna accept nothing like that why you bring some uh some some fruit from the field look at how beautiful this is son he said watch when i get into the presence of god how he accepts my sacrifice and at the altar oh jesus it was at the altar that god actually rejected his offering and it's at the altar that a lot of people have been rejected because it's not from their hearts they refuse to walk in truth after they get up from the altar cain had the ability to walk in truth when he came to the altar god said now i don't like what you brought me but i like what your brother brought me give me give me the same thing he got now he had just finished criticizing his brother so now that's gonna make him eat his words hallelujah's somebody is he saying oh you know that's many people don't criticize you they don't criticize you and they have to eat their words and sometimes that pride is what stops them from coming through the door but god gonna find that pride and get rid of it glory to god god got a way of putting you in a spot where the only person can pray for you is a person that's a believer [Music] your pastor can't pray for you because your pastor don't believe amen you know that church you go to them people are not believers they can't pray for when you when you hit rock bottom and you need somebody to get to god you know where to go we're going to be right here too can't say kane say uh say but you know that look at his office i'm not i don't want that i want blood kane if you give me the same thing king i mean that abel gave me i don't i i'll accept it can't say i can't i can't i can't do that i just criticized him so what does cain do he kills his brother and let me tell you something there's people trying to kill your influence they kill your character hallelujah that's what they're trying to do but when god is giving you character can no man kill it no woman can kill it when god is giving it to you and cain found himself at a spot where he could not even um obey a direct commandment from god so this is why i say look it's more than just going to the altar it's more than just reading your bible it's more than that it's being able to come in line with the truth for your day all right the prophet said seven things seven reasons why we should come to jesus jesus is the way jesus is the truth jesus is the light he also said jesus is the only safe and secure foundation and when he said that he said we i i i i remember we can't put our trust in politicians here we can't put our trust in the democratic party we can't put our trust in the republican party because the prophet said both parties are rotten brother if anybody ever gave me some fruit that was rotten i would not eat it and i ain't gonna eat no fruit from the democratic and the republican party either it's rotten to the core jesus is the only safe and secure foundation saints should not be fussing and fighting over what the democratic and republican party are doing not saints saints you need to be commenting on the internet on social media about that type of stuff it's a spirit to divide the people you want to talk in your house that's one thing but don't send that stuff out there or over the way so you can create some some some viral posts and think about what you're doing because it reflects on this church it reflects on me as your pastor think about what you're doing before you do it hallelujah glory to god the prophet said it's rotten i don't eat rotten stuff all right glory to god he said jesus is the only successful and secured happiness and peace glory he also said jesus the other reason you should come to jesus because jesus is the only lasting achievement so many things here and there there are sermons in all of this i just i can't preach it all today but i might come back and hit some of this he said and the last thing he said here jesus is the only one that can translate your body that's why you ought to come to jesus that's why you ought to serve jesus because he's the only one offering translation powers he he said your medicine can't translate you amen it says your medicine can't change you from an old person to a young person no appeal can do that no level of education can do that no career can do that no amount of money that you attain can buy you translation power that's why it's best just to serve the lord jesus because at the end you're gonna need something to translate you something that'll change your body second corinthians 5 1 says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal and the heavens we have something to translate us even when we come to death we got a promise when we're walking with the lord jesus i'll tell you there's a lot there and i just wanted to kind of drop this off because uh you know jesus being the way the truth and the life we got to be we got to be connected with him it's more than just going to the altar it's more than just reading your bible but it's being able to walk according to the truth for your day see luther had the truth for his day wesley had the truth for his day but there's another truth that's coming our day and we've got to be able to walk in that truth all right all right let's so let me uh i read this scripture i don't know i'm i'm hearing and it's just uh okay all right praise the lord i read this uh last week and i want to pick it up revelation 14 uh verse 6 to 12. let's read this now uh when we when we talk about this message that we follow it's in the bible it was actually promised according to scripture right and uh so we're not we're not just kind of following something willy-nilly it's it's we gotta we gotta be able to um you know we gotta we gotta be able to see ourselves in scripture hallelujah amen here in revelation 14 verse six it says and i saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell in the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters and there follow another angel okay there followed another angel saying babylon has fallen it's fall in that great city because she made all the nations drink of the wine of of of the wrath of her fornication and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand now let me just pause just for a second hallelujah because there's this fanaticism that we got to keep our heads above and one of the fanatical thoughts that's out there is that if you were to take the vaccine you'd be taking the mark of the beast that is fanaticism i have you to know that the bible says that if i were to drink anything badly it would not harm me this is more of the system right it's not about a vaccine the prophet prayed for vaccines now i'm not telling you to go take a vaccine but i'm telling you that if you have to it's okay if you don't want to you know what it is it's okay but it's not the mark of the beast the prophet did not say that amen let's go back to what the prophet said the prophet never said a vaccine was the mark of the beast so don't y'all get yourself caught up in this nonsense this is fanaticism that you got to keep your head above amen all right amen it shouldn't separate you if a brother say i want to take the vaccine that's i know a brother you know he he around people all the time said brother i just felt better taking ain't nothing wrong with that brother i got no problem with that he asked me had i i haven't and there shouldn't be nothing wrong with me either we should still be able to fellowship glory to god amen church it's fanaticism that we got to keep our heads above around here and i ain't gonna let the devil divide a church over a vaccine the same god that protects you with it is the same god protect you without it it's the same god so don't let that i mean it's just okay if that's what you choose to do that's fine don't even equate it to faith it ain't got nothing to do with faith it is what we call preference i i told some people say now i have to travel i've traveled overseas in the past uh the different countries in africa and i had to take a vaccine before i could go there now if they make that a requirement again you know what i'm going to do go down and get the vaccine i'm going to get it and i will not have the mark of the beast because i know that's not what the prophet taught that mark of the beast is when you when you see it in hand they say it's you working for the system right with that that mark in your head it's it's your it's not just your knowledge but it's how you think about the system you can't even see nothing outside the system all you see is what the system say my my pastors say my preachers say my my bishops say but what does the word say this person said that i ain't got nothing to do with that i'm gonna stay with what the words say you know there's another i'ma just have to say it it's coming out of my mouth like this fanatical thought there's another thought out there say we don't need preachers no more somebody get married we play a tape from the prophet no no that's fanaticism that ain't even your name on the quote that's not even your name that he's saying there that's that's what i mean i'm just trying to tell y'all this is what's out there and it takes something to keep your head above this no no i can marry them i can bury them that's that's what my job is as a pastor and you know you know brother branham never said it do any of that play this tape uh when when it's uh when so-and-so get married play this tape that ain't doing what the prophecy when somebody get they die and they you got a bear and play prophet never said nothing like that we got to live above fanaticism and still love our brothers and sisters in the in the midst of it that that don't mean go to the go to go go to social media now you see somebody believe that way now you just attack them you're fanatic that's not love that ain't christ i'm just telling you you know since this is this is just the shepherd talking to the sheep keep your head above fanaticism it's all out there but just keep your head above it all right all right let me let me i i read the scripture now let me read this quote i believe no i didn't finish reading the scripture uh verse 9 says and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice uh if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark and his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with the fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast in his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus amen uh i i want to just kind of bring this out because you know brother smiling made a comment last week when he was going to say you know we just take things for granted right and and i just read that scripture and for me i take it for granted i take it for granted i know what it means right there's a lot of churches that will avoid the book of revelation there are saints that's probably even sitting here right now listen like well brother jack you know what that mean how do you know what that mean the reason i can tell you what that means because the prophet told me what it meant glory to god and and all i do is apply what the prophet said see so so when we talk about you know just you know when i say jesus is the way there were certain things that jesus was doing at the calvary i hope we get it there were certain prophecies that were still waiting to be fulfilled after calvary and what we got to do is kind of get amen a prophetic lens and look at the scripture a little differently i mean how many out there reading a bible ask them what does this verse that i just read out of revelation 14 what does that mean all the reading of the bible they've been doing they have no clue what it means well here's the thing if they would come underneath the prophetic anointing then they would get an understanding as to what that meant it's more than just reading your bible it's more than just going to alter it's more than that can you walk in the truth for your day because that's what cain failed to do he could not walk in the truth for his day and all he had to do is one thing god only gave him one thing to do one thing give me the same offering that your brother just gave me it wasn't even a mystery amen yeah anyway he ain't have to figure out what type of animal to go get god gave him the exact thing to do but he refused to do it and this is what the problem is with people today they refuse to walk in the fullness of the truth as it has been given to them in their day and i'm going to tell you something i'm not going to serve god in my emotions i'ma just tell you like it is you got to come according to truth amen all right mark of the beast and the seal of god now uh this is a message i'm quoting from it'll be good for you to maybe go back and listen to that tape if you want to know what the mark of the beast is that way you won't be going around telling people it's the truth anyhow you won't be going around telling people oh you got you got the mark of the beast you took the vaccine that's a lie and god did not give us a spirit of fear but of love power and sound mind now let's read this quote here i'm trying to get on out of here uh he says this and and let me just also drop this coming in if it took prophets to write the word of god it'll take a prophet to interpret the word of god not a theologian not a man that got a doctorate degree a prophet interprets the word of god so even when i look at that i might i might i might have my own thoughts when i look at that scripture but a prophet tells me what it means now watch what the prophet says here it says now you see how it was represented in ezekiel the 9th chapter at jerusalem now we come to revelation and now like you that's got your pencils to write this down i'd like you to write down revelation 14 uh verse 6 to 12 that's the three last angels let me just help you what do you talk about here the three last angels would be luther wesley branham now uh i i said last week that it said malachi original it says elijah right but but it's the spirit of elijah according to malachi that's been promised for this day so the last three stars the last three messengers uh a a junction that took place amen in church history happened when luther came on the scene luther wesley branham last three angels last three messengers identified in revelation 14. these last three angels three angels after the seven last angels they were three special angels come forth lotus ready to say three special ain't luther especially wesley was special william branham was special all right it says uh did you notice that and now i want you to notice them three last the first angel that's revelation 14 6-12 the first angel had sounded the trumpet of the gospel and had the everlasting gospel to preach to all the world the second angel kind of preached the holiness gospel see because he said the church had committed fornication my and the third angel roared out to escape the mark of the peace watch the first angel at the reformation luther preached the gospel second angel wesley sanctification the fornication he's straightened up of the church i'm i'm gonna just have to say something to straighten up the church fornication this is this is having sexual affairs and not being married right um jesus when he came on the scene he had to deal with that problem it's a woman one time that had herself a bunch of different men and jesus sent his disciples into the into the um the market to go buy some vittles and when they come back they saw him talking to this woman at the well and it says uh you know the woman was having conversations like you know that's not good for us you know we have two different races we shouldn't be out here talking together like this he says uh she's i'm samaritan you jew and you know we shouldn't be out here saying you know we worship here and y'all worship there and y'all just say he said look uh uh woman you know just give me a drink and say actually you know if you would ask me for a drink you would never thirst again say what kind of you ain't got nothing to even draw with what you what kind of water you're giving and he started just communicating with her and next thing you know she's like oh light start coming on and she's like you know what i want some of that water sir give me some of that what you talk about you know i never thirst again he said yeah you can have something this will say but before you get it now go get your husband all right and the lady said something said now i don't have a husband say you told the truth you told the truth you ain't got no husband that you're sleeping around without a husband and then he made another statement say the one you living with and this is where we got a problem in the church we got folk living together not married that's sin that is sin god came blessing that hallelujah either marry him or get out of there but don't walk it don't live in sin your blessings are held up because of sin your blessings are held up because of sin right either either either get in there or get out of there and i'm talking about right away i ain't talking about waiting all year we're gonna get married in a year if y'all gonna get married here y'all shouldn't be living together until you get married it's the truth in the hive that that means you got to get two or three jobs to support then get two or three jobs of support or live right before god don't die in that condition we we still believe in sanctification around here we believe in justification we also believe in sanctification you got to live right how are you going to get a blessing from god living like that and actually living like that that you know i know i know why some people don't come to church when they just pop in here and there you ain't fooling nobody the holy ghost know what you're doing when you leave here and you say well i just don't want to handle the church blessings yeah we appreciate you having that much respect but have a have a have more respect for yourself that you don't want to hinder your own blessings live right before god if they're not going to marry you get out of there hey man it's the truth thing to have they if you if you don't you don't pose the question they got not gonna marry get out of there leave and young lady you got a man that that he he see enough in you to sleep with you but but he don't see enough in you to marry you i just need to say these things ain't it spring spring cleaning right but the man the man the man see enough in you to sleep with you to write your name on the bathroom wall huh right he he he he got he he got that much respect for you but to marry you that man say no way you need to get out of that relationship run for your life that's why you need to wait on god to give you a holy ghost for your husband holy ghost be a wife but now you don't got yourself out there you need to marry it it's the truth anyhow amen i i play this tape when you go home tell them they need to hear this it's the truth and how we talk about sanctification this is what wesley was bringing back to the church glory to god and the church ain't got away from it amen he had a special message a message of sanctification all right hey man mamas and daddy's y'all y'all i i my friend that was just with me she said uh george she was telling me how she got lost in the parking lot uh at home and um she was just lost couldn't figure out where her car was and um so she walking and then you know some people approach and say ma'am can we help you it says uh she said yeah i'm lost i don't know where my car is now now he's saying that to these strangers it was a setup that was a setup for her to get robbed but she's not thinking she said my name is joyce and what's your name my name is george tucci gave him a whole name my name is joyce tucci what's your name and the guy said his name was i'mma just use her name because i don't know what the name was my name is bob jones and then the ladies say my name is sally smith oh okay um y'all um y'all uh y'all married uh no no no no no we're not we're not we live together but we're not married oh y'all not married y'all living together y'all not married no that's not right before god you you're dying you're sin these people there to help her but really she was there to help them and they they helped to get to a car but they was they was burning and singing and and just her words was piercing their spirit you living in sin you can't keep living like that glory to god that's another thing when you get married young lady you take on that young man's name you don't keep your own name now we don't we we gotta live above the fanaticism i i know a fella that got married to a girl and took her last name perversion all around us and the guys think he doing something by doing that it's fanaticism it's it's sin at the highest level and we're living in this we're living in satan's eating trying to keep our head up other fanaticism and he's smiling telling everybody he took her name god help us right but i i want your parents you you got kids out there living like this it's okay to tell them are you living in sin you're living and sin they might not want to call you well i don't want to say that because then they don't they don't want to come by you better say it so you can keep them out of hell do you want them to come by hell you better tell them hallelujah if you can't tell him play the tape push play you need to be sad we got to get the same question settled look if you i mean i know folk they they won't come because they walk living in sic i i say i'm not talking about just i'm talking about really living in sin right now while they listening to this this this message they ain't seen and if they were to die right now they'd die and wake up in hell so i got to tell them no no no you need to get out of right now pop the question now i'ma just put it like this if they're good enough for you to live with them they're good enough for you to marry him if you can get that low to live with him you might as well go lower marry him is the truth any high let god give you grace to come out of it you should have never put yourself in that position now that you're there you got to deal with it it's the truth anyhow but don't live in sin amen don't live in sin don't don't do that you're going to hell living like that amen amen i'd rather see you make heaven than anything else hey look y'all gonna be bold i might as well be bold up any kind of way do it no no no no no you know we teach better than that you going to hell like that amen hallelujah all right all right uh uh uh brother brother brother brother capers called me last week and said brother that's a greasy bag and you know and i'm like say well he said you know some people in school you see them come to come to lunch come come with a lunch box a lunch bag they say that if if it ain't no grease on the back ain't no good lunch in there see if you see grease it might be some fried chicken that's the guy you're going to want to beat up to get his lunch might be a poke chop in there or something glory to god we're not trying to serve you uh uh uh uh grilled cheese sandwiches we want to give you some meat all right all right let me let me keep reading this now the the first angel at the reformation luther preached the gospel second angel wesley sanctification the fornication he straightened up the church uh warning he says but the third messenger the pentecostal message should be the true messenger warning them to escape the mark of the beast saying whosoever receives the mark of the beast the same will drink the wrath of god pour a port out without mixture into the cup of indignation be poured out upon the people that's the very message today it says the third angel the third message the last message the the lutheran message of justification the wesleyan message of sanctification the pentecostal uh message of the seal of god escape the mark of the beast come out of them big walls of babylon be sealed and cut into the kingdom of god now uh so here we are you know we find at this juncture in the sixth junction one of the great ministries that god used was the minister luther and the ministry of john wesley now i don't have time to go through all the history today but i'm going to just try to give you a little bit uh we know that at a junction uh god god sends angels god sends the the supernatural the miraculous comes at the junction uh when we when we started the life of luther this man had all nine spiritual gifts operating in him that is amazing to me that god can trust you with all nine of the spiritual gifts i mean speak in tongues interpret wisdom knowledge right healing gift of healing all these things to being one man you know the supernatural is following his ministry right but here in wesley let's pick him up this is this this sermon i will restore god help us to come around and get that one at the end here i will restore he makes a statement about john wesley it says john wesley when he was here in america riding to pray for a sick woman one day his horse stumbled and fell and broke his leg john took his anointed oil a leg you all understand when a horse get a broken leg my brother's brother brother brother uh uh josue no more than i do but from my understanding a horse get a broken leg they go get the gun they go get the gun it's over we're not gonna use you no more i don't care how many races that horse ran i don't care how many how many how many races he won that horse is useless to his his uh owner at that time once he has a broken leg but not john wesley he's not getting a gun he's not getting a knife he went and got his anointing oil oh somebody look at this look at this look at it he says he says um um stamina fell broke his leg john took his anointed oil and anointed the horse and said you made that horse the same as you made me got on him and wrote it one waiting to see if it popped back in place of nothing no i'm anointed with oil and i'm expecting you to just get right back in your place and got them kept rotting amen glory to god it says uh uh you made that horse the same way you made me got on him and wrote it rolled him away that's what the methodist had what your mother had long time ago but it's died out i don't want that to be our testimony that that's what we had what we had should still be here says but i will restore saith the lord god will send his power in down me and god will send somebody that will accept it i believe that church i'm on the expectation for that you know other things about uh wesley's that they said you could not find him in lowness of spirit even a quarter hour that means for 15 minutes the man would not be discouraged some kind of way when discouragement would come and maybe you know how your spears get down a little bit and the devil said i got him and you know sometimes y'all experience get down the devil try to take y'all into depression oppression regression your spirit is down right but john west says something he had a internal mechanism maybe he looked at his watch and tell the devil i'm giving you 14 minutes come on somebody 14 minutes to have that bad thought 14 minutes to feel uh gloomy in my spirit but on the 15th minute that's it get out of here with all that gloom and doubt i will not receive it some kind of way there was a mechanism in john wesley and i told you the man had marital problems [Music] can you imagine that being drugged by his hair by his wife but in 15 minutes oh glory to god that's a man that's living by scripture life nor death nor this nor that nothing gonna separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus my lord i'm not i'm sorry i know we disagree i know we i know we disagree and yeah that's why i said on sunday you know when we we got that we you know we we don't took that scripture and we want to make it apply and i i think it does apply you try scripture say don't let the sun go down upon your wrath he said well we got to talk out every problem before we go to bed it sounds so good but but what about when the sun already went down and we're in a disagreement and that invisible line come out y'all ain't gonna talk to me y'all married people you know the invisible line that be inside your bed don't come over my side and i won't come over on your side that invisible line be there the sun went down here's the thing we all know that that happens here's the thing don't allow that to stay there there ought to be something in your heart to want to get get back across that invisible line where y'all can cuddle a little bit more amen but sometimes you got to learn how to put some conversations in the parking lot and come back and talk about them later now don't don't leave it in the parking lot all right when we sometimes we take them trips when we get the bus we put our cars in the parking lot but when the bus get back get your car at the parking lot amen and be committed to talking about it look sometimes you know as a husband i have to tell my wife okay uh and i have to be the one to say okay i'm not ready to talk about that now but on such and such a day we're gonna talk about that and when i give her the day i can't let nothing come between that time see uh it's i ain't in father's day yet i'm almost there but these are things that got to give to the fathers and husbands but you know but but be committed that when you say we're going to talk about it talk about it and sister sometimes you got to know when to talk and when not to talk on the way to church is not the time to pick a fight maybe just say honey you know i do have something in my heart i just when you got time i like to talk to you about it all right but don't be trying to pick fights all the time hallelujah and just give me your overcoming power when you're on the house if if you can conquer your own house you can do some concrete in other places it's the truth anyhow but this man this man could not find 15 minutes in any hour where he was discouraged for over 15 minutes what a man they say he slept no more than six hours a day let's just read this philadelphia church age go go to that quote let's read this uh just talking about this messenger how god used them mighty man of god and i i am i i'm gonna have to go over time for y'all today if y'all don't mind amen just give me i just i want to bring this one to a close that way i can get into the the seventh uh here it says um wesley was a remarkably strong man he says of himself that he could not remember to felt have felt loneliness of spirits for even a quarter hour since he was born he slept no more than six hours a day arose in time to start preaching at five practically every day of his ministry preach up to four times on a single day so that in a year he would average average over 800 sermons when i first started the ministry i said lord how am i gonna get 52 messages for 52 sundays in a year god that's a lot then i read this quote i said lord jesus this man preached over 800 sermons a year i ain't got nothing on it right he said he traveled multiple thousands of miles as did his circuit riders who carried the gospel near and far in fact wesley traveled 4 500 miles per year by not in a car not flying horse now you can imagine why he prayed for that horse he could have been in the middle of nowhere i ain't got time for this horse to go out on me i'ma lay hands and i'm gonna pray and we're gonna get up and keep riding sometimes you gotta understand your position as a son and daughter of god no i'm gonna let the devil just do that to me amen right it says uh he was a believer in the power of god and prayed for the sick with great faith and wonderful results many of his meetings saw the manifestation of spiritual gifts now here's the the thing and i want to try to bring this home if i can god help us their ministries was used as a restoration i mentioned to the the first three ages when you read revelation chapter 2 um the age of ephesus smyrna pergamos uh it was all the open door to the false vine there's an open door to the false vine and in thigh tier we actually saw the full manifestation on the maturity of that false vine coming to thy tier right uh that was the age of 1500 years of darkness there in thigh tier that's why you see it up there columbus being the messenger but it was it was what they call the dark ages even in history right but but after the dark ages came a time of reformation right the church began to reform on the luther on the wesley to finally hit this day and we completed that that that process i should say not just a reformation but a restoration begin to happen hallelujah now here uh joel 1 4 let's read that see the first first three ages was open door to the false vine but the last three ages started as philadelphia laodicea that's the open door to the the truth the open door to the true vine the truth all right so here uh and joel 1 4 says that which the palmer worm hath left have the locust eaten and that which the locusts have left half the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left have the caterpillar eaten so now there's four uh uh four insects that are identified in this scripture we got the palmer worm we got the locusts we got the cankerworm we got the caterpillar now what the prophet tells us this is the same insect at four different stages hallelujah amen and and what the palmer warren's job to do amen when it came to the church and this is what happened not only in church history through the ages this this happened but also it happens to us as individuals glory to god some of us are in these stages right now the palmer worm when he comes around his job is to take the fruit of brotherly love he takes the the sense of loving your brother and loving your sister he takes that from the church he allows something to happen he causes something to happen where a sister falls out of love with her sister he allows something to happen where a brother falls out of love with with his brother amen they know that uh oh that ain't nothing but the devil but they allow the devil to sit there and feed on that negativity you're being affected by a palmer worm that's right right the locust dance that that when and if you let the palmer sit there too long he goes into another stage and he becomes the locust and what the locust is he starts eating at the joy hallelujah the joy and the leaves of fellowship amen that's why we wanted to come together last week intentionally just to have some fellowship and i just i thank god that we have an opportunity to get there and have fellowship with you get a chance to know me in a different setting i get a chance to know you in a different set we just have fellowship don't let the devil eat the joy of the leaves of fellowship if we can't have fellowship here how are we going to have it on the other side we got to start practicing heaven now the third stage if he starts taking the leaves of fellowship because that's where the tree as it has the leaves those nice branches there with the leaves you want to get up underneath that tree and just get some shade but if you don't have no leaves there you can't get it just bare sun you don't get no you get no benefit from the tree but the devil goes to the next stage so he starts with cankerworm i'm at palmer and then he starts with locust then the third stage he goes to cankerworm now first he took the fruit of brotherly love then he took the leaves of fellowship now he's attacking the bark of the tree now seeing our english like english english language the word bark has many definitions because a dog can right a dog can bark and as that dog is bark that dog that the bark to the dog is his protection that's what he's going to use to kind of kind of get you off of them let you know he's there a little ground in a little bark hallelujah amen but for a tree the bark is the tree's protection amen the bark is the outermost covering of a tree trunk and the branches it's the protective skin of the tree hallelujah the bark is also what conserves water and serves serves to protect the trees essential living systems from environmental and situational dangers the bark protects it from situational dangers the the bark protest protects it from living systems that's coming to try to damage the tree oh hallelujah the bark is what protects it and if you don't have bark amen you you you're like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water right but if your bark is destroyed it's going to destroy the life inside of you you need that protection you need fruit you need leaves you need bark but here's what happens the last stage of this is the caterpillar and when it's the bark has been penetrated the the bark is no longer has that outward shell on the tree now the caterpillar can get right in to where the real tree is and begin to suck the life out of it recently me and my wife was on a little trip and we went to a little uh little city hey man georgetown south carolina i believe it was and we stopped there i told you i didn't know where i was going i just got in the car and started driving i ain't even ain't no no georgetown south carolina existed until i ended up stopping that day and we stopped there at this hotel uh and uh i went to pull into a parking space to get a little closer because you know my wife liked to park close she don't like to walk too far right so she say that's a close-up parking space right there so i got into the closer parking space and uh i backed up and and uh and i come out and the first thing i saw was this big bug coming at me i said my god i don't know what that is and and and it landed somewhere in my truck i say that's a pretty big bug dear you know watch out for that bug and she said where's it at you know it took off and started flying said it's gone and she turned around and looked at her tree says oh i say well what's the matter with you she said that just look oh no that don't oh i suck there's something wrong with this tree and this caterpillar's just lined all up all over the tree i mean just just just i i want to say thousands from one tree to the next tree and it was only as i started preparing the sermon that i realized what those caterpillars was doing was sucking the life out of that tree right i mean and they they came in droves to take the life out of that tree and you might not realize that when you lose the fruit hey man hallelujah when you lose the fruit of brotherly love when you lose a man leaves a fellowship when you allow the enemy to start attacking the bark then the caterpillars come and they begin to take all the life but i got good news for you there is an intelligence that's inside the tree hallelujah and that intelligence says caterpillar i'm not gonna let you take on a life the life begins to go down into the roots and brother branham called it the predestinated roots and there comes a time when amen the the process of death reverses and now becomes a process of life god says i will restore [Applause] oh that the palmer worm oh that's a locust glory to god all that the cankerworm all that the caterpillar has taken away god says he's going to restore hey and we are living in the restoration of that hallelujah everything the devil did through the dark ages we've come back to the full restoration hallelujah let y'all let your marriage go through that restoration let your personal life go through that restoration hallelujah hallelujah glory to god i thank god for this it says uh it says this process that began in the ministry of luther continuing wesley the process of restoration the process of of bringing the church back to where it used to be back to his glory it began in luther uh continuing wesley pentecost revival and now finalize the restoration of the word uh every fresh and true revival will come because people got back to the words amen and i just want to uh want to bring out this little quote out of restoration of the broad tree let's get this uh paragraph 502 and we'll be bringing it home here it says now listen closely listen i don't miss it this now there was four deaf messengers or would you rather we just closed uh uh this morning says listen real close now look there was four death messengers kill that tree that's right what what was it palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar is that right amen four messengers of roman devils dogmas killed that tree one took his fruit one uh took his bark or took his leaves one took his bark one took the life is that right four messengers of dogmas kill the tree all but the roots and i i thank god that uh you might have loved ones that's not here and it may look like they're in a real dead condition but there's a root there there is a root still there the devil ain't been able to bring out his stump grinder he can't grind the roots man we we were over in palm beach y'all seen that tree over in palm beaches i mean i think it's a banyan tree you look at the root system of that tree it ain't going nowhere no storm gonna take it out right and what you need to know i don't care what your children going through they they've been rooted they've been rooted glory to god they're gonna come back to this the same way you have a desire to live for the devil god gonna give you a desire to want to live for him your desire is perverted but god will change your perverted desire amen glory to god it says this says and if four messengers of death kill the tree four messengers of life restores the tree says do you get it it says amen for god said i will restore it he's going to restore it how by four death messengers killed it then four life messengers will restore it amen he says what was the first martin luther justification what was the second john wesley by sanctification what was the third pentecost with the restoration of the gifts now listen the church as it was going to uh going through his restoration it had to go through justification sanctification restoration of the gifts why do you think we're having a terrorist service because that's a part of the church's restoration the gifts are supposed to be flowing in the church it's just got to be done correctly but we encourage the gifts hallelujah amen we're not pentecostals we're not going to get lost lost in these things but we want to see everything that god promised to be in the church we wanted to be there amen it says this he says um uh wesley about sanctification what was the third pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost what was the fourth this is this is the important part glory to god what was the fourth the word what the word they were for great prophecy it's not just stopping at justification it's not just stopping at sanctification it's not just stopping at the amen at the baptism of the holy ghost but we must have the word that is the fourth stage of restoration hallelujah this is why pentecost they'll take the gifts but they won't take the word there's many other churches out there that take all these other things but they won't take the word we must have the word and notice what brother branham said that they were four great prophets that mean he called luther prophet he called wesley a prophet and and and pentecost was uh william seymour he had the ability to see that god could do more in his church and god honored that man honored this man's faith and allowed the baptism of the holy ghost to pour out there in a sousa street in the church has never been the same since we thank god for where we come from and what what we come through where we come from and what we come through i don't i don't say everything i went through even some of the fanatical things that i went through it wasn't all for naught no god had purpose for bringing me through that but he gave me the strength to hold my head above the fanaticism thank god for that here he says this one of them martin luther he began to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification alone came wesley stronger sanctification after wesley came stronger than him pentecostal the baptism of the holy ghost and another great prophecy and he says um but in the last days of malachi 4 elijah is to come with the very word the word of the lord came to the prophet and the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of their father the faith of faith of god the fourth light now you can just see right there that's another junction the fourth light is actually another junction which is actually the final light hallelujah it's the final age this is why if you can't recognize the word for your day you're lacking still can i just read out of uh um joel and we'll bring it to a close brother branham always took this scripture from from acts 2 and i read from verse 14 to 21 but when you go back to joel 2 you'll see that that's where he got it from this is the promise for our day and this promise amen comes right through what luther and what wesley started i'm starting at verse 23 joel chapter 2. i'll read this and then we'll close this church that that we all are part of we're not here by accident we're not here by chance we are here by predestination i want to tell some of y'all some of y'all uh uh the relationships that people have gotten into you know it didn't start in the church it started outside the church it started outside the church and and you know oftentimes you know certainly i i'll be the first to admit i always want to see believers marry believers i always want to see that it save save a lot of trouble say the pastor haven't stopped he don't have to have as many meetings when believers married believers because the pastor just give them the word and they take the word amen and they apply that and they go on but we got an unbelieving a believer they the unbeliever don't even want to hear the word now you got to get the spirit of discernment and you wore out tired looking for the spirit of discernment and try to give them something that'll help them right but but but but but but um when it does happen and it does here's the other part to that because the good thing about this god already knows it was going to happen before it did god already knew so sometimes you just stop fighting and i'm gonna tell you who you're fighting god you think god couldn't stop them from getting involved in that you think god couldn't wipe that that person out do you think god couldn't no god allowed it to happen for a reason and i'ma give you the reason i'm gonna give you the reason why i got allowed to happen you want to know the reason because god uses human beings to redeem other human beings i got to be careful when i say that because now some young person gonna say well you know the pastor said god uses human beings to redeem of the now you ain't got to make that choice now if you make that choice with that with that quote you're going to redeem them but jesus went to a cross to redeem us he went to a cross he went through some pain so you want the other side of that and don't don't when you when it get painful don't talk about quitting then go back to that same quote that led you out there keeping them keep it on the top of your lips god uses human beings to redeem other human beings joel 2 verse 23 let's read be glad then your children are zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you to rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil revelation and i will restore to you the years i love this promise you might go through this process you feel like i lost a lot of time god said i'm gonna give you back the years that you thought you lost i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker and the caterpillar and the palmer my great army which i sent among you look at this and ye shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people i thank god for this promise shall never be ashamed you know i i like that i just i i'm gonna just camp that just for a second you know sometimes satan gets you get our young people in a certain situation and and they can do things that embarrass us it's embarrassing for you to carry yourself like that it's embarrassing for you to be dressed like that it's embarrassing because you know better it's embarrassing but you know maybe satan may flaunt them out there like that but wait till god turns them around on the inside then you can go right back to the devil and quote this scripture that god said my people would never be ashamed because actually it's a greater testimony when you come from somewhere when you don't come through something it's a it's a greater testimony it gives god even more glory hallelujah that don't mean leave here and go try to get a testimony you got to try to walk right down the middle folks they might just be everywhere they will just throw anything at you don't don't just eat anything it's it's better when you can have somewhere that you come from you can talk to somebody about something it's also good it's also real real good it's great it's better if i can i can use that word too when you keep yourself and remain faithful to god in the midst of whatever it is keep your head above fanaticism just because you see some other brother sister go out don't mean you got to go out keep yourself above the fanaticism and this is what happened when the dead when one go down he always trying to take another one down with him that's why you got to watch it you become a target but i ain't going down with you i see you i ain't going down with you though if you want to come up now come to church amen but repent all right and god will bring you i'm at verse um 28. and it shall come to pass after that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem and in spirit and truth shall be deliverance as the lord has said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call we're living in the time of this restoration what was lost through the first uh few ages amen has now come back to whole and and luther and wesley their ministries would use to bring the church back to this place that we're living in right now but remember uh first light was luther's light second light was wesley's light third light was actually the light of the pentecostals it's the light of the pentecostals but we're not walking in that light anymore the fourth light is the restoration of the word of god and that's the light we're walking in with the expectation that we will have justification we will have sanctification we will have the gifts of the spirit with the word the sixth junction praise the lord i just love the lord um musicians y'all prepared to come and just give me this last quote out of harvest time it says look hurrying there must come a true seed there has just got to be because he's coming for the bride without spot or wrinkle he's coming for it a word vindicated pride oh should be such a little bitty group because people look at you know these great big mega churches and you know we think god is in it no the bride will be a little bitty group jesus said as it was in the days of noah wearing eight souls was saved is that right so shall it be in the coming of the son of man how many i don't know but see that bride is going to be made up of all down through that had the word in their age so the bride is made up of all these seven ages right it says it's not just this last group god is going to take the whole thing out of here it says oh no it'll be so small it'll be surprising they'll come up missing you won't even know they're gone what if he took 500 in this last day you you would never know it took 500 in a few days uh time two or three days there's that many people comes up missing across the world don't even know where they're at never hear nothing about them the secret coming of the lord jesus shall be taken away and the rest of them go right ahead preaching just like it was in the days of noah my glory to god we got it hallelujah and sealed to their death that's what the bible says and it can't fail this is the statement i want to leave you with as moses as as noah moses david reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so has luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride as noah moses david reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so has luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride can i tell y'all something we are here that perfect bride is on the scene now i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them let's give the lord a hand to praise oh my let's have a word of prayer brother solomon i will turn the service over to you amen you all stand with me and we'll have a word of prayer father we just thank you for the word of the lord thank you for the ability to see not only what you're doing but what you have done it's great ministries that you've sent to the earth the ministry of luther the ministry of wesley great men of god that you use in a mighty way wesley being a man that god not even 15 minutes of a day that man could be found discouraged he would not allow that um palmer worm to even get started for the if if the pommel worm sits there too long then it evolves to locus locust a cankerworm can't go room to a caterpillar god before we know the tree is completely destroyed but he would not allow it help his father to to find that type of resolve to have that same type of mechanism on the inside that we just want to allow the enemy god to just do whatever he wants to do towards us that we will stand true to the word of god and be encouraged no matter what it is that we're facing i pray lord that this won't just be a message that goes in one ear and out the other but lord if there is sin in the life of your people i pray that they would get those things right your coming is upon us it's upon us right lord at any moment god you could crack the sky any moment you could you could be coming for the prophet said one of these mornings between six and nine we don't know when is it gonna be the last day that we'll meet here at this church for service we want to live under expectation help him to heed godly counsel god make things right in your sight not with me but with you i don't have a heaven or hell to put nobody in but god that belongs to you and i just pray that souls would get right i pray that there'd be a burden placed on the family members that would tell their families tell them even hurt tell them the truth the truth hurts but god it'll save him from destruction scott i pray that you give us that holy boldness to speak it let the word settle on good ground that it might produce fruit today in jesus christ's name
