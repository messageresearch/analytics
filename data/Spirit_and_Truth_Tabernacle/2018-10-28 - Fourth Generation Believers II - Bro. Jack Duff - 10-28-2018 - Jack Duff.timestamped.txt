[1:03:07] I'll be leaving going that weekend
[1:03:09] brother smiley be coming to preach here
[1:03:11] the church will still have church for
[1:03:13] those that like one or two songs to have
[1:03:15] Church brother smiling to be here and
[1:03:17] but uh but that'll be coming up to so
[1:03:19] just keep those things in mind and keep
[1:03:21] them in prayer let's turn our Bibles it
[1:03:23] may while you're standing and man
[1:03:25] everyone stand I can't stand turn in
[1:03:26] Genesis 15 we want to continue forward
[1:03:30] with our thought from last week Amen all
[1:03:34] fourth generation believers a man and
[1:03:38] just pray that the Lord would just take
[1:03:40] us a little further and this today
[1:03:44] Genesis 15 and let's just start reading
[1:03:51] at verse 13 man Genesis 15 verse 13 and
[1:03:56] it says and he said into April know of a
[1:04:01] surety that thy seed shall be a stranger
[1:04:04] in a land that is not theirs and she'll
[1:04:07] serve them and they shall afflict them
[1:04:09] for hundred years now now notice those
[1:04:13] terms
[1:04:15] 400 years typically every 40 years is a
[1:04:19] generation okay so here we're seeing
[1:04:22] that they would actually be in bondage
[1:04:24] for ten generations okay they're in
[1:04:27] bondage for ten generations but I'll
[1:04:30] watch the scripture a man verse 14 says
[1:04:33] and also that nation oh they shall serve
[1:04:35] will I judge and afterwards shall they
[1:04:37] come out with great substance then you
[1:04:39] go back and read scripture when they
[1:04:41] came out of Egypt they borrowed from the
[1:04:43] Egyptians and they left with great
[1:04:46] riches and I believe that as we're
[1:04:48] leaving a man in a rap - we're not
[1:04:50] leaving broke when I think of poor you
[1:04:57] know in order to do that right I was
[1:05:00] just listening to a message - speaking
[1:05:01] brother branham saying we gotta take
[1:05:03] care of our little debts
[1:05:06] alright brother branham say that right
[1:05:08] don't matter he said like we know about
[1:05:10] your house and stuff like that but
[1:05:12] little thank you Oh somebody paid them
[1:05:15] right pay pay you look this go over to
[1:05:19] God right but uh but but you know so for
[1:05:22] us to get our blessing to leave here we
[1:05:24] gotta take care of what we gotta take
[1:05:25] care right a man but I believed it as
[1:05:28] they left Egypt they left with great
[1:05:30] substance and as we leave the earth will
[1:05:32] leave with great substance all right
[1:05:34] might as well start enjoying some of
[1:05:36] this cuz we gonna be walking streets ago
[1:05:39] and remember that right asphalt cold
[1:05:48] concrete though that's that's best what
[1:05:52] he promised does right hallelujah
[1:05:55] alright alright the goal is important
[1:05:59] right when you get gold you know out of
[1:06:02] the fire like brother Troy told about
[1:06:04] you gonna be in one fire you think I'd
[1:06:06] be in the devil's fire you're gonna be
[1:06:07] in God's fire then we gotta find he's
[1:06:10] trying to burn the life of God out of
[1:06:11] you know I gotta find he tryin to put
[1:06:14] the life of God in you because he wants
[1:06:17] to see his reflection and that's how to
[1:06:19] hold a gun I mean that I'm sorry that's
[1:06:21] how I go we know go let's go when I beat
[1:06:23] a pizza and you can see your reflection
[1:06:25] in the gold you know it's good stuff
[1:06:27] right I'm at first 14 and also that
[1:06:33] nation oh they should serve will I judge
[1:06:34] and after what they shall come out with
[1:06:36] great substance in the first verse 15
[1:06:38] and thou shall go to that fathers in
[1:06:40] peace thou shall be buried in a good old
[1:06:43] age but in the fourth generation they
[1:06:45] shall come hither again for the iniquity
[1:06:48] of the amur assets not yet full now
[1:06:50] catch that because it was 400 years
[1:06:53] which would been ten generations but in
[1:06:56] the fourth generation they come alright
[1:07:01] but in the fourth generation they shall
[1:07:04] come hither again for the iniquity of
[1:07:05] the emirates not yet full a man let's
[1:07:08] leave it right there

[1:09:20] we spent so much time responding to what
[1:09:23] the devil is doing let's forget about
[1:09:25] what the devil do 1 and let's think
[1:09:27] about what God has good

[1:10:41] church hey man we're under expectation
[1:10:44] you know I got talking about these
[1:10:46] fourth generation believers a man
[1:10:49] because you know how I was just sharing
[1:10:51] you know just kind of bring you up a
[1:10:52] little bit there are things that I'm
[1:10:54] seeing in this generation that I know
[1:10:56] that I would have never seen before
[1:10:59] right there are things that are
[1:11:01] happening and I'm talking about amongst
[1:11:03] believers a man amongst people that say
[1:11:07] they believe the message they may not
[1:11:09] I'm watching things happen and I know
[1:11:11] and I'm just I'm just looking at a lot
[1:11:13] of stuff and I thought as I seen as I
[1:11:15] say Lord that would have never occurred
[1:11:17] in my generation right I would have
[1:11:20] never saw a man some of the dances that
[1:11:23] I see people doing some of the some of
[1:11:26] the music that people listen to write
[1:11:29] some of the things that people are doing
[1:11:30] we would have never even thought to do
[1:11:33] anything like that
[1:11:34] hey man you you would never go to a
[1:11:36] wedding and see dancing
[1:11:37] praise the Lord hey man hallelujah glory
[1:11:41] God you will never go and see drinkin
[1:11:45] I'm just telling you things that I see
[1:11:48] happening in this generation that would
[1:11:50] have never happened before right I'll
[1:11:52] talk about even before we came to them
[1:11:54] there was a certain amount of holiness
[1:11:58] right there was holiness we wouldn't
[1:12:00] dress certain ways certain things on TV
[1:12:04] we would not look at right but but in
[1:12:07] this fourth generation in an innocent
[1:12:09] it's important for me to cry out because
[1:12:11] you know why there's another generation
[1:12:13] and after this way and if this
[1:12:16] generation is not changed then god help
[1:12:19] us gonna come in the next generation
[1:12:22] all right raishin does not experience
[1:12:26] the baptism of the holy ghost god help
[1:12:28] us so what's gonna happen in the next
[1:12:30] generation Oh Church all right so let me
[1:12:34] uh let me just kind of go along here
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] I go back actually brothers brother
[1:12:41] Devon gave me a cool I'm gonna read it
[1:12:43] this is on the back sheet of paper
[1:12:44] they're out of an enzyme a man an enzyme
[1:12:49] and it says this it says an all sickness
[1:12:52] is caused by sin all sickness is caused
[1:12:56] by sin that's right before we had sinned
[1:13:00] we had no sickness seeing our sickness
[1:13:04] is an attribute of sin right sickness
[1:13:07] became I mean sickness came because of
[1:13:10] sin maybe not what you done now think
[1:13:14] about that youyou could be a man
[1:13:16] suffering from an illness in your body
[1:13:18] and you didn't do anything in the kidney
[1:13:20] but it says it was inherited right you
[1:13:25] inherited it Amen just by being born in
[1:13:28] the family that you were born in you
[1:13:30] inherited something my god but what
[1:13:33] breaks that is the power of the Holy
[1:13:35] Ghost since three or four generations it
[1:13:40] will follow God said so right so you
[1:13:43] know brother branham's referring back to
[1:13:44] a man of Scripture here in Exodus 20 and
[1:13:47] verse 5 they meant Exodus 20 and verse 5
[1:13:52] says thou should not bow down thyself to
[1:13:54] them nor serve them for I the LORD thy
[1:13:58] God am a jealous God visiting the
[1:14:02] iniquity of the father's upon the
[1:14:04] children unto the third and the fourth
[1:14:07] generation of them that hate me
[1:14:10] so the slope so when the father's a man
[1:14:13] get out of place when the father's start
[1:14:16] walking and disobedience they don't
[1:14:18] realize that their their steps are
[1:14:20] impacting generations to follow now you
[1:14:24] all remember the story a man of brother
[1:14:28] Branham he shared how this
[1:14:30] it was Christmastime and the daddy had
[1:14:33] was going from house to house and his
[1:14:35] little boy was falling they were snoring
[1:14:37] all on the ground and they had snow all
[1:14:39] over the place the boy was following
[1:14:40] daddy and and as he was going from house
[1:14:42] to house daddy would just take a little
[1:14:44] sip of something right and then he go to
[1:14:47] the next house and he take another
[1:14:48] little simple son a man and didn't go to
[1:14:51] the next house and it taking a little
[1:14:52] sip of something now his boy weren't
[1:14:54] taking those sins but the daddy was
[1:14:57] taking six so the daddy got to walk in a
[1:15:00] manner he got he done got drunk because
[1:15:03] he been sipping on something a man at
[1:15:05] every house he went to and as he's
[1:15:07] walking he's impaired
[1:15:09] he's impaired he doesn't realize it so
[1:15:11] it's walking in the soul and he sees a
[1:15:13] step here and he sees the step there and
[1:15:15] he doesn't realize it but his boy is
[1:15:18] walking in his steps and everywhere
[1:15:20] daddy was step the baller put it and I'm
[1:15:23] daddy go over here the ball would put
[1:15:25] his foot and every time that ball would
[1:15:26] put his foot down the dad and looked
[1:15:28] around and say why what's the matter
[1:15:29] with you why are you walking from here
[1:15:31] to there to there
[1:15:32] what you doing this walk straight he
[1:15:34] said daddy I'm following your steps he
[1:15:39] was selling but pattern for he meant for
[1:15:41] his son not realizing and when that boy
[1:15:44] got old enough in the Holy Ghost then I
[1:15:47] get there and get control of that boy
[1:15:49] when that boy got old enough he was
[1:15:51] gonna go from house to house and take a
[1:15:53] sip and even go to the next house and
[1:15:56] take a sip and he's gonna go to this
[1:15:58] house and take a sip the reason I do
[1:16:01] that is because he saw his daddy and I
[1:16:06] noticed when that boy has a boy his boy
[1:16:10] gonna do the same thing he did because
[1:16:12] it was something that was passed down
[1:16:13] from generations but the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:16] able to break whatever speared the devil
[1:16:21] is trying to pass down through
[1:16:22] generations now stay with me here a man
[1:16:26] on this I want to just kind of share a
[1:16:28] couple things a man if I can oh god help
[1:16:32] us we were you know so description and I
[1:16:35] just read here out of our Exodus 20:5
[1:16:39] thou should not bow down thyself to them
[1:16:42] nor serve them for the LORD thy God am a
[1:16:45] jealous God visiting the iniquity of the
[1:16:47] fathers of mother children unto the
[1:16:49] third and fourth generation of them that
[1:16:50] hate me now let's look at this because I
[1:16:53] brought this in a few weeks ago
[1:16:55] hallelujah when we look at a man you
[1:17:00] know brother Branham gave a quote and
[1:17:01] let me pull this up the power of the
[1:17:03] devil let's just look at that real quick
[1:17:05] then I'm gonna slip back into what
[1:17:06] something I shared a few weeks ago the
[1:17:08] power of the devil says look at it in
[1:17:10] the time of Joseph when God was making
[1:17:12] manifest the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:17:15] through Joseph look how Satan come about
[1:17:18] the 27th chapter of Genesis there how
[1:17:20] that Satan come to destroy Joseph and
[1:17:22] would have done it so the very tool that
[1:17:24] God was going to use he said Satan's
[1:17:26] trying to destroy the very tool that's
[1:17:28] God that God's going to use and I want
[1:17:30] to just inject Amen to this fourth
[1:17:32] generation you are the very tool that
[1:17:35] God wants to use but Satan is trying to
[1:17:38] destroy you
[1:17:39] you gotta recognize this the devil you
[1:17:42] got to know who your enemy is
[1:17:43] but Satan won't stick I mean Satan wants
[1:17:46] to destroy the very thing that God wants
[1:17:49] to use now now stay with me here it says
[1:17:51] over in chronicles about the 22nd
[1:17:54] chapter the royal seed how he tried to
[1:17:56] destroy that and all over in matthew out
[1:17:59] a second look at matthew - he says look
[1:18:02] how quickly that Satan was on on the job
[1:18:04] when he knew it was about the time for
[1:18:06] the Redeemer to be born he got into the
[1:18:09] political leaders and set forth an issue
[1:18:13] and destroyed all the young children
[1:18:14] from two years Oh down in order to kill
[1:18:18] the Lord Jesus now you know you have to
[1:18:21] even think about that what would be the
[1:18:23] purpose of him going after the children
[1:18:25] right now you know what if he stopped
[1:18:28] the parents they couldn't have normal
[1:18:29] children but why was he going after the
[1:18:32] children right there's something in the
[1:18:36] children then they're not I mean who's
[1:18:38] that up I think Hitler made some type of
[1:18:40] comment about you know you you give me
[1:18:43] the music or something like that and I
[1:18:45] can control the minds of the children a
[1:18:47] whole generation of children right he
[1:18:50] said we can just kind of take control of
[1:18:51] the children that he can do great things
[1:18:53] in intonation right it's such a thing as
[1:18:56] always after the children always after
[1:18:59] particular generation I want I want to
[1:19:02] go further with this I want to show you
[1:19:03] all something because we got we gotta
[1:19:05] hit hit that over into our Genesis 15
[1:19:08] again we'll get back to that in a second
[1:19:09] aid man just stay with me let me just
[1:19:11] coast a little bit but here you know
[1:19:13] brother random sense now look back a man
[1:19:16] look he says uh over in Quran occurs
[1:19:19] about the twenty seven twenty second
[1:19:20] chapter the Royal see how he tried to
[1:19:22] destroy that now let's just let's just
[1:19:24] go back because I brought this out to
[1:19:26] you a little bit but when you go back to
[1:19:27] second chronicles a man chapter twenty
[1:19:30] two this speaks of a man a lady a ruler
[1:19:34] at the time by the name of a failure a
[1:19:37] man and her attempt to actually try to
[1:19:40] destroy the royal seat right and and and
[1:19:44] and I'm just going to kind of take you
[1:19:45] through just a little journey here if we
[1:19:48] can she tried to destroy the royal seat
[1:19:51] but only one child was saved and then
[1:19:54] they keep that child in to you know hide
[1:19:57] them in the chambers but about six years
[1:19:59] foot actually brought them forth and let
[1:20:01] him take his rightful position as king
[1:20:02] but let's just kind of see something a
[1:20:05] man as to how he got to that point where
[1:20:07] a thin he's trying to destroy the royal
[1:20:09] seat she actually ran for six years she
[1:20:11] reigned over Israel she was not a man a
[1:20:14] true daughter of Israel but yet she was
[1:20:17] ringing Oh Holly Lou
[1:20:19] god help us here help us here yet she
[1:20:22] was reigning as a queen
[1:20:25] up up above God's people now watch this
[1:20:28] let's let's follow the journey here's
[1:20:29] how they got there
[1:20:30] amen so in second chronicles 22 a man is
[1:20:34] talking about how they were able to save
[1:20:37] one of the king's son his thing was
[1:20:39] joash and he was the rightful heir to
[1:20:41] the throne he was a great-grandson which
[1:20:46] mean even have been fourth generation he
[1:20:48] was a great-grandson to King Jehoshaphat
[1:20:51] now King Jehoshaphat was a very special
[1:20:54] man he was a godly man right Jehoshaphat
[1:20:59] if you remember when Ahab call a man job
[1:21:03] Spencer would you go out with me and and
[1:21:05] let's go to battle amen and and reclaim
[1:21:07] my mouth Killian I don't know you got to
[1:21:10] read your Bible understanding sex right
[1:21:12] but it's okay if you haven't read your
[1:21:14] Bible maybe the caused you to go back
[1:21:16] and read this after we talk about today
[1:21:17] but but you say sailing let's go let's
[1:21:20] go and reclaim what God gave us it and
[1:21:23] they have I mean a handful he said of
[1:21:26] jobs that say well before we go should
[1:21:29] we hear the word of the Lord from a
[1:21:30] prophet hallelujah should we hear the
[1:21:35] word of the Lord from a prophet and then
[1:21:37] they answer yeah yeah we should hear
[1:21:39] from the Prophet I got 400 of them and
[1:21:42] we're gonna let them prophesy and after
[1:21:44] they prophesy then we'll go out the back
[1:21:47] so he brought phone with me before and
[1:21:49] all of them stood up would say the Lord
[1:21:52] is with you go out Amen is gonna give
[1:21:54] you the land and Joseph that heard that
[1:21:57] John Francaise is there at least one
[1:22:01] more says at least just walk properly
[1:22:04] because it's no way that 400 men can

[1:23:54] he needed to do was show up for the
[1:23:56] battle amen if they were need to fight
[1:23:58] because God was gonna sent and blood
[1:24:00] Smiths against the enemy and and after
[1:24:02] God defeated the enemy for Jehoshaphat
[1:24:05] they were three days and gathering the
[1:24:08] spoils he was a man of God now I want
[1:24:12] you to understand something about him a
[1:24:15] man it was during this time of
[1:24:18] jehosophat's rain that a powerful
[1:24:21] Scripture was recorded and I want to
[1:24:24] read this to you second chronicles
[1:24:26] chapter 20 verse 20 a powerful Scripture
[1:24:30] was record

[1:24:34] this
[1:24:35] second chronicles 20 and 20 this is
[1:24:38] where they were recording out the battle
[1:24:40] they didn't have to fight in the battle
[1:24:42] God was gonna fight for him all they had
[1:24:43] to do is just show up listen say their
[1:24:46] roles early in the morning and went
[1:24:48] forth into into the wilderness of the
[1:24:50] cold and as they went forth Jehoshaphat
[1:24:53] stood and said hear me o Judah and he
[1:24:56] inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the
[1:24:59] Lord your God so shall he be established
[1:25:03] believe his prophets
[1:25:06] so surely prosper hallelujah amen the
[1:25:12] only way to recover prospers by
[1:25:14] believing what the prophets say Amen
[1:25:18] somebody that's where your property is
[1:25:21] this when you believe what the prophets
[1:25:23] say glory to God so here this powerful
[1:25:26] scriptures recorded during this time of
[1:25:28] jehosophat's reign now I'm following him
[1:25:30] because he's the first generation yes
[1:25:32] sir
[1:25:33] now I'm going on because now there was
[1:25:35] something to happen with all these great
[1:25:37] things there was one little thing that
[1:25:39] happened that began to since they sowed
[1:25:42] the seed that would kind of bring
[1:25:44] ruination to the people of Judah to the
[1:25:48] Israelites that were under the reign of
[1:25:49] the tutor of Judean kings say this with
[1:25:52] this one thing that he did begin to
[1:25:55] instead a seed for something that was
[1:25:58] gonna sprout up later hallelujah amen
[1:26:01] and what what he did was actually marry
[1:26:05] his son to Ahab's daughter I want you to
[1:26:11] catch that Jehoshaphat allowed his son
[1:26:14] to get married to a Habs daughter all
[1:26:20] right you want to know who his daughter
[1:26:22] was a failure
[1:26:24] so now this father is now within this
[1:26:27] next generation a man and here's his
[1:26:29] jobs that son
[1:26:30] it's called sure Ram of Jehoram a man
[1:26:34] he's also a king in Judah now where he
[1:26:36] rose to become king he slew his brothers
[1:26:39] after his father jobs van pass and man
[1:26:43] the Bible declared them 2nd chronicles
[1:26:45] 21 and 13th he married his the daughter
[1:26:48] of Ahab her name was Italian Italian
[1:26:50] amen and this was a bad marriage that
[1:26:54] would impact future generations that's
[1:26:56] why you gotta watch who you marry
[1:27:00] this was a bad marriage that was going
[1:27:03] to impact future generations the
[1:27:06] children in this relationship
[1:27:09] think about it we'll have a half and
[1:27:13] Jezebel as grandparents so so so here
[1:27:21] Jehoshaphat has allowed his son to link
[1:27:25] up with a failure now now I caution his
[1:27:29] grandchildren to be shared with his
[1:27:32] house and with a hams house a happens
[1:27:36] marriage to Jezebel which is a really
[1:27:38] wicked one now can't you imagine sending
[1:27:42] the kids over to grab my chest man how
[1:27:48] you gonna stop him from going to Grandma
[1:27:50] Jesse Bill's house huh you allowed that
[1:27:53] marriage to take place and now that
[1:27:56] they're married not connected and not
[1:27:58] just connected up through friendship cuz
[1:28:02] you can stop friends from being friends
[1:28:04] you can block them but when a family
[1:28:08] oh we may become family it's a totally
[1:28:13] different story you can't stop the blood
[1:28:16] right so here you can imagine these kids
[1:28:20] going to grow my chassis bail and being
[1:28:22] instructed that girl my Jezebel's house
[1:28:25] seized that was so while they're hanging
[1:28:28] with jessie bail watch it now watch
[1:28:31] watch it look at this
[1:28:33] hey man I hear a Dahlia was Jezebel
[1:28:36] Astoria daughter she demonstrated more
[1:28:38] wickedness than Jezebel she judged
[1:28:42] enough product to have meatball kill but
[1:28:44] I'll tell you kill the Royal see right
[1:28:48] I meant Joe Ranft died with an incurable
[1:28:50] disease according to a licensed prophecy
[1:28:52] but in all this wickedness he was
[1:28:55] allowed to reign because God promised
[1:28:57] David that he was he would give up give
[1:29:01] him a son to sit on the throne forever
[1:29:03] that God made that promise to David even
[1:29:06] though children was wicked even though
[1:29:08] he married the wrong woman
[1:29:09] God was keeping a promise today three
[1:29:12] children stay with me here he died the
[1:29:18] next one this is the third generation
[1:29:20] aha see it comes up amen AHA gia is the
[1:29:25] is the son of Joh Ram a man and a
[1:29:28] failure now here's the problem not only
[1:29:31] was a failure his mother but the Bible
[1:29:33] says that a tell you became his
[1:29:35] counselor hallelujah they remember a
[1:29:39] half's daughter
[1:29:39] Jezebel's daughter up there is now the
[1:29:42] counselor to her son who is the king and
[1:29:45] now you can imagine how they influence
[1:29:47] of gentle Bell it's passing down
[1:29:50] everything is passing down now watch
[1:29:53] this a
[1:29:53] saya failure was his mother and
[1:29:55] counselor she counted him to do wickedly
[1:29:58] the Bible says that his second
[1:29:59] chronicles twenty two and three he only
[1:30:01] reigned this man has he only reigned for
[1:30:05] one year but it was loaned enough to
[1:30:08] give birth to another king
[1:30:11] listen the Bible says that he did eat
[1:30:14] when the silent Lord like the house of
[1:30:17] Ahab now wow here he is coming on the
[1:30:20] Jehoshaphat's lineage but it said he did
[1:30:23] evil like the house of Ahab because a
[1:30:26] tempest his granddaddy he's being
[1:30:32] influenced by his granddad his house not
[1:30:34] his daddy's house so you gotta watch who
[1:30:38] you just connect to it you see how the
[1:30:39] state started pack 2 generations now now
[1:30:42] notice he's only been around for 1 year
[1:30:44] he was that wicked only been around for
[1:30:46] one year but he gave birth to a son now
[1:30:49] the son that he gave birth to a man was
[1:30:52] not from this was from the daughter of
[1:30:56] zibeon he gave birth to a son his name
[1:30:59] was Joe Ash and this is the one that
[1:31:01] they had to hide inside the temple for
[1:31:03] so many years a man but in the seventh
[1:31:06] year Joe ass came out he began to reign
[1:31:08] glory to God he was reigning as a seven
[1:31:10] year old king he was responsible for
[1:31:12] helping to repair the house of God
[1:31:14] according to second second chronicles 24
[1:31:17] - but this man joash is now what we call
[1:31:20] the fourth generation hallelujah and as
[1:31:23] a fourth generation Israelite from
[1:31:25] Jehoshaphat
[1:31:26] it seemed he only served God while the
[1:31:29] priest Johanna was living when you read
[1:31:32] his story this man only served God
[1:31:34] because of the experience he had with a
[1:31:36] priest and here's what I mean the young
[1:31:40] people understand this is why I promise
[1:31:42] here God does not have grandchildren God
[1:31:46] only has sons and daughters so every one
[1:31:50] of us have to have our own experience
[1:31:52] with God you can't go to heaven because
[1:31:54] your momma went to heaven
[1:31:57] you can't go because daddy went to
[1:31:59] heaven you gotta have your own
[1:32:01] experience with God's God don't have
[1:32:04] grandchildren he only have sons and he
[1:32:06] only has taught us
[1:32:08] hallelujah somebody can I go a little
[1:32:11] further here all right listen
[1:32:13] so answer answer as a as a
[1:32:14] fourth-generation Israelite from
[1:32:17] Jehoshaphat he only served God while
[1:32:20] Yahaira the priest was living was
[1:32:23] Johanna died he turned to idolatry he
[1:32:27] even killed to hide a son who prophesied
[1:32:29] against him he died
[1:32:31] this man joyous also died on a sick bed
[1:32:34] and his servants conspired to kill him
[1:32:36] and I noticed also in the Scout joash
[1:32:38] even though he's in the lineage of the
[1:32:41] kings this man was in the lineage of
[1:32:43] either bringing Jesus Christ to the
[1:32:45] earth but when you look at it
[1:32:47] Amen in the Matthew 1:8 his name is not
[1:32:50] listed this man joash was in the lineage
[1:32:54] of Jesus Christ but his name was not
[1:32:56] listed because of the wickedness because
[1:32:59] of the evil that was done his name was
[1:33:01] not listed and there were others that
[1:33:03] did not have their name listed even
[1:33:05] though they were in the lineage now
[1:33:07] watch that watch that watch I want to
[1:33:09] just kind of show some things the other
[1:33:11] thing that happened during this time of
[1:33:13] Josh's reign as the 4th generation he
[1:33:15] turned he turned the children of Judah
[1:33:18] because they were splitting an Israeli
[1:33:20] had Judah he turned the children Judith
[1:33:22] any half misleading a man Israel
[1:33:24] Jehoshaphat was leaving Judah ain't
[1:33:26] having Jezebel had already brought in
[1:33:28] idolatry to Israel but here Judah was
[1:33:30] still holding on but now because of this
[1:33:32] marriage and generations later now we
[1:33:34] see Judas turning from God as well yes
[1:33:37] it happened in the fourth generation it
[1:33:41] happened in the fourth generation let me
[1:33:43] just kind of throw a couple other things
[1:33:44] at you 4th generation I'm talking about
[1:33:46] this but if you
[1:33:48] even at the church ages the darkest age
[1:33:51] up here
[1:33:52] Amen was a five-tier in church age and
[1:33:55] that happened to be the fourth church
[1:33:57] Inc amen
[1:33:59] and I want you to understand another
[1:34:01] thing about five-tier being the fourth
[1:34:03] church in Thyatira the name actually
[1:34:06] meant the name Thyatira meant dominating
[1:34:09] female dominated female brother Branham
[1:34:14] said that was the worst curse that the
[1:34:17] world ever had when they got a
[1:34:18] dominating female now if we're really
[1:34:24] honest with ourselves right we can see
[1:34:27] that dominating female spirit coming in
[1:34:29] again because when a dominated female
[1:34:32] female spirit they can't be told nothing
[1:34:35] no respect for leadership and if you go
[1:34:41] back to type it look at gently male look
[1:34:43] at Etherea no respect for leadership no
[1:34:46] much swim that same spirit got released
[1:34:49] full generation in the Bible now we see
[1:34:52] in the church age that same thing for
[1:34:54] church age most Dark Age yes sir
[1:34:56] and the dominated female sphere was
[1:34:58] released I won't bring another one
[1:35:01] brother Troy it gave me discipline think
[1:35:03] about this after God had destroyed the
[1:35:07] earth with rain Noah was on the boats
[1:35:11] and his family was on the boat but but
[1:35:14] for four generations from Noah a man his
[1:35:17] great-grandson it would've been or it
[1:35:20] would have been whammed hilary cush then
[1:35:23] we would have had nimrod hallelujah
[1:35:26] and when we look at nimrod a man we can
[1:35:29] see that the world just end up
[1:35:30] the complete chaos in the fourth
[1:35:32] generation hallelujah in the case of
[1:35:36] Jehoshaphat all the way down to Josh
[1:35:38] they ended up in complete chaos
[1:35:40] now I want to read something now to
[1:35:41] program your church age about Nimrod
[1:35:44] fourth-generation things happen that's
[1:35:46] why we got to understand now I'm
[1:35:47] counting from a specific period I'm
[1:35:50] actually counting from when a prophet
[1:35:52] comes on the scene yes sir
[1:35:54] Noah was a prophet right and look at
[1:35:57] three four generations later look at
[1:35:59] what happens amen to his seat look at
[1:36:02] them right now I want you I want you to
[1:36:03] catch this because this is coming out of
[1:36:05] burning me at church age I want you to
[1:36:06] watch this Roberto makes a statement
[1:36:09] says Babel his original name for Babylon
[1:36:13] it means confusion right said it was
[1:36:16] literally started by cush Belleville was
[1:36:19] started by cush right then I noticed
[1:36:23] this curse did not get all the credit
[1:36:26] that member I got right but but it was
[1:36:29] started by cush to the ideas the
[1:36:32] thoughts
[1:36:33] Amen all that started in the third
[1:36:35] generation but now we see a
[1:36:37] manifestation of those thoughts in the
[1:36:40] fourth generation oh my God my God my
[1:36:44] god I wish I could just kind of you know
[1:36:47] whenever we look at this we look at this
[1:36:50] you know there were things like I've
[1:36:51] told you last week that we said a third
[1:36:53] generation say when I get older I'm not
[1:36:55] gonna raise my kids like that yeah do
[1:36:58] not get old imma do this and I would do
[1:36:59] that I'm
[1:37:00] I'm not going to do this with my kids
[1:37:01] and don't you realize that the devil was
[1:37:03] a Norton you way back they can I cannot
[1:37:08] you know they're things that you know
[1:37:10] I'm gonna tell you we compromise
[1:37:12] sometimes in the third generation yes
[1:37:14] yes I've heard this I've heard this
[1:37:18] statement from a lot of people a lot of
[1:37:20] people I've lots in the third generation
[1:37:23] I'm telling my generation one that one
[1:37:25] of the things that we said was that I've
[1:37:27] heard people say they're louder kids and
[1:37:29] do certain things in the house

[1:37:33] the house right and it's it I don't want
[1:37:37] to lose them well let me ask you a
[1:37:38] question with what they doing in your
[1:37:41] house ain't they already lost and well

[1:37:48] heaven or hell

[1:37:51] they in your house they going to heaven
[1:37:54] because they ain't Christ right amen but
[1:37:58] but we but sometimes we compromise

[1:41:51] gotta keep an environment for them but
[1:41:53] I'm not the one keeping you the Holy
[1:41:55] Ghost look you cuz when you leave my
[1:41:58] house do you have something on the
[1:42:01] inside that account you to love God more
[1:42:04] than you love the things of the world so
[1:42:08] we let down some of the standards in the
[1:42:11] third generation right we let them down

[1:45:38] parents let your kids get busted
[1:45:42] experience that they will have will stay
[1:45:45] with them for a lifetime in Turkey put
[1:45:52] them in the Nile River and let them get
[1:45:54] busted forgive me a churchy
[1:46:01] let me read this for you I'm coming Noah
[1:46:04] ham cush Nimrod Babel is the original
[1:46:12] name for Babylon it means confused and
[1:46:14] it was literally started by cush the son
[1:46:16] of ham but was brought to a kingdom of
[1:46:19] power and grandeur under his son nimrod
[1:46:23] the mighty hunter right now i understand
[1:46:28] when they call this man the mighty
[1:46:29] hunter he wasn't going out killing
[1:46:32] animals he was hunting nations
[1:46:35] hunting people right right and he was
[1:46:38] trying to destroy nathan a conquered
[1:46:40] nations that's why he's called the
[1:46:42] mighty hunter all right notice mighty
[1:46:46] hunter nimrod according to the Genesis
[1:46:49] 11 account and also according to profane
[1:46:53] history set out to accomplish three
[1:46:56] things now now notice I want you to
[1:46:57] catch this because nimrod represents 4th
[1:47:01] generation so there's something that
[1:47:03] happens in the 4th generation and watch
[1:47:05] this spear three things that happen in
[1:47:07] Iran Nimrod once the three things that
[1:47:08] happen here today
[1:47:09] look look he wanted to build a strong
[1:47:12] nation which he did he wanted to
[1:47:16] propagate his own religion right so he's
[1:47:21] not following the Prophet he got
[1:47:23] something new that he want to bring
[1:47:26] right amen what the Prophet said is not
[1:47:29] good enough and then we go further than
[1:47:32] the Prophet that's what they say in the
[1:47:33] fourth generation right right and they
[1:47:35] didn't go further in Arak that's against
[1:47:37] the work say say he wanted to propagate
[1:47:40] his own religion which he feared and he
[1:47:42] wanted to make a name for himself
[1:47:49] you know preaching amongst the bright
[1:47:51] weren't good enough I know what I'm
[1:47:58] talking about man I already found it in
[1:48:01] the message brother branham let me know
[1:48:04] what this spirit is so being amongst a
[1:48:06] bright weren't good enough the crowds
[1:48:09] not larger night the church is not large
[1:48:12] enough there's a little bit more
[1:48:14] attention if I can get on stage right
[1:48:16] here I get myself a little bit more
[1:48:20] exposure on YouTube if I can just get
[1:48:24] much I need to make a name for myself
[1:48:26] because the name I got amongst these
[1:48:28] little churches ain't big enough I want
[1:48:34] to play for this church I got a talent I
[1:48:37] got a gift I can play for that church
[1:48:39] and if I if I got up on stage in that
[1:48:42] church just think about all the people
[1:48:44] that I can impact oh you ain't you ain't
[1:48:47] you yeah I mean you gotta talk to me I
[1:48:48] know what I'm talking about let me tell
[1:48:54] you something you talking to one that
[1:48:56] was damn I worked in I work in that
[1:49:00] environment have you prayed about coming
[1:49:07] to join up with us then what never
[1:49:09] really tell me have you thought about
[1:49:11] shutting down your church and becoming a
[1:49:14] part of this church
[1:49:15] look at how grand we are look at how big
[1:49:18] we are we can make you a pastor I'm
[1:49:22] already a pastor
[1:49:28] I'm already a pastor right because I
[1:49:33] wouldn't actually a man fall for it Amen
[1:49:36] I went full-time in ministry read
[1:49:38] between the lines but if God is for you
[1:49:46] then we'll give me again I took my stain
[1:49:53] and I stay with the Word of God and God
[1:49:57] has been blessing everybody's the church
[1:50:05] spiritually financially emotionally
[1:50:11] physically plexus miracle after miracle
[1:50:17] because somebody took the stand for the
[1:50:19] word but the fourth generation sees it
[1:50:25] as an opportunity mem rocks right so
[1:50:29] that's an opportunity see so you see his
[1:50:33] daddy introduced polytheism it used to
[1:50:38] be just one God everybody believed in
[1:50:41] one God
[1:50:41] it was a monotheistic religion one God
[1:50:44] but but cush begin to bring in hardly
[1:50:47] see yourself right polytheistic
[1:50:50] I mean here you got multiple gods so so
[1:50:52] he take that teaching it to the son and
[1:50:54] now his son is taking it to another
[1:50:55] level
[1:50:56] all right stay with me amen
[1:51:00] we believe used to believe be baptized
[1:51:02] the name of Lord Jesus Christ now third
[1:51:04] unit I mean fourth generation going so
[1:51:06] many baptized the name of Father Son and
[1:51:08] Holy Ghost they move move from
[1:51:10] monotheism to polytheism
[1:51:13] that happens in the fourth generation
[1:51:16] man notice now I'm bringing this out I'm
[1:51:20] showing this to you and let me just
[1:51:21] finish reading this quote because I got
[1:51:23] to come back around because not
[1:51:24] everybody the fourth generation gonna
[1:51:26] get company I'm swinging right now for
[1:51:29] you okay just let me finish read this
[1:51:31] quote saying they say Nimrod according
[1:51:33] to Genesis 11 account and also according
[1:51:35] to profane history set out to accomplish
[1:51:38] three things he wanted to build a strong
[1:51:40] nation if I can just put it this way
[1:51:41] build a strong denomination there I'm a
[1:51:45] strong nation which you did not now not
[1:51:48] just because somebody say they are
[1:51:50] nondenominational that don't mean they
[1:51:53] following the work we will talk about
[1:51:57] that and some school day it's not just
[1:51:58] believe the Bible or oh we can put it
[1:52:02] this way man you gotta believe the word
[1:52:03] it's not just that either
[1:52:05] it's believed though we're word for
[1:52:08] you're not just the word but the reveal
[1:52:14] word for your you gotta know what say
[1:52:18] you living in you're not living in
[1:52:19] Noah's day so ain't no stinson nobody
[1:52:22] coming to build a little boat time I get
[1:52:23] on we're not getting no work we don't
[1:52:27] believe that I mean it was in the word
[1:52:29] that's already gone by we not we not
[1:52:31] following that no more amen we use it as
[1:52:34] an example right yes but you gotta
[1:52:37] believe the word for your days who's the
[1:52:40] Prophet fit your date and God almost in
[1:52:43] one
[1:52:47] guys to have proper step a quarter to
[1:52:50] Ephesians there are some apostles some
[1:52:53] prophets some evangelists some teachers
[1:52:56] some Pat yeah we believe that - yes amen
[1:53:00] and people want to get what a chicken
[1:53:02] Thomas me as a prophet let me tell you
[1:53:03] something let me tell you something
[1:53:05] right now if we have to acknowledge you
[1:53:08] like that I doubt you a prop somebody
[1:53:16] have to give you tight that type of
[1:53:18] credibility you got a bag for it
[1:53:20] something wrong with your experience you
[1:53:24] know the Bible say a man's guilt make
[1:53:30] room for itself whether they acknowledge
[1:53:34] it Dom acknowledge it
[1:53:35] you'll give still gonna make new person
[1:53:38] and nobody got to do nothing extra for
[1:53:40] you let me show you what the real deal
[1:53:45] is this is what you're going after he
[1:53:48] wanted a car set out to accomplish three
[1:53:50] things he wanted to build a strong
[1:53:51] nation which he did he want to propagate
[1:53:55] his own religion which he did he wanted
[1:53:58] to make a name for himself which he also
[1:54:01] accomplished his accomplishments were so
[1:54:06] monumental that the kingdom of Babylon
[1:54:07] was called the hand of gold
[1:54:09] amongst all world governments that his
[1:54:13] religion gained prominence and proven by
[1:54:16] the fact that scripture identifies it
[1:54:19] would say you did all that but your
[1:54:29] ministry identified with see actually
[1:54:34] anointed by the devil
[1:54:37] oh maybe the devil can use you in church
[1:54:46] you know you know there's a lot of folk
[1:54:48] go to church week in and week out and
[1:54:51] don't realize that they worship in the
[1:54:53] devil right in church I'm telling you
[1:54:58] right I mean you know when it comes down
[1:55:00] to church is that it's got to come back
[1:55:03] to regular word for you see you really
[1:55:06] not worshiping in spirit and in truth
[1:55:09] yeah yeah it's because the father
[1:55:11] looking for he looking for people that's
[1:55:14] gonna worship in spirit and in truth
[1:55:15] some horse have been spirit but don't
[1:55:17] have true so I've got the truth ain't
[1:55:21] got no spirit yeah but he won't spirit
[1:55:24] and man and that's this just so happened
[1:55:30] to be on Church name right but but
[1:55:33] that's not what I'm talking I'm not
[1:55:34] talking coming to this building
[1:55:35] alright I'm talking worshiping in spirit
[1:55:38] but with a revelation whining worship
[1:55:41] all right amen
[1:55:45] all right so he goes on to say this he
[1:55:48] says that his religion game promised is
[1:55:52] proven by the fact that scripture
[1:55:53] identifies it it was Satan completely in
[1:55:56] Isaiah chapter 14 and in Revelation
[1:55:58] chapter 17 through 18 and by history we
[1:56:01] can prove that it invaded the whole
[1:56:04] world and is the basis for every system
[1:56:07] of idolatry and the theme of that Ana
[1:56:12] theme the theme of mythology through the
[1:56:15] name though the names of the gods
[1:56:16] different various sections of the land
[1:56:18] according to the language of the people
[1:56:20] that he made a name for himself and as
[1:56:22] follows goes without saying for as long
[1:56:24] as this present age goes home until
[1:56:27] Jesus reveals himself to his brother he
[1:56:29] will be worshipped and honored through
[1:56:31] under though under different name from
[1:56:33] Nimrod and in a temple slightly
[1:56:36] different from the one in which he was
[1:56:37] originally adorned all right now I'm
[1:56:40] bringing that church because oh my
[1:56:45] goodness you know we we need to
[1:56:49] we need to see we need to see that same
[1:56:53] spirit has come and hit the Fortuner
[1:56:55] reach that's right that's right reach
[1:56:57] it's hit the fourth-generation and I
[1:56:59] have to count from a profit notice what
[1:57:02] I went when I gave you Genesis 15 and I
[1:57:05] went a little circle background hit this
[1:57:07] and then I'll try to close it today but
[1:57:09] Genesis 15 and verse 13 it says instead
[1:57:12] of an April know of a surety that that
[1:57:14] seat should be strange in the land that
[1:57:15] is not theirs and shall serve them in
[1:57:17] Asia afflict them for hundred years that
[1:57:20] represents ten generations four hundred
[1:57:23] years would actually represent ten
[1:57:24] generations right now when you skip down
[1:57:27] to verse 16 it says but but yes in the
[1:57:33] past generation they shall come hither
[1:57:36] again for the iniquity of the ever race
[1:57:39] is not yet full right now notice that
[1:57:42] now they're gonna be there for for ten
[1:57:46] generations right ten generations
[1:57:48] they've been punished but in the fourth
[1:57:51] generation and the reason that we got
[1:57:52] what we see is that it's the fourth
[1:57:54] generation from a prophet the fourth
[1:57:58] generation from when Moses hit the
[1:58:00] scenes now now now now now you know when
[1:58:03] we get this because they did not come
[1:58:05] back into the promised land until Moses
[1:58:08] that come on the scene he started it but
[1:58:10] he didn't actually take them into the
[1:58:11] Promised Land
[1:58:12] right now no monist Moses would have
[1:58:15] represented the first generation right
[1:58:17] shots when Caleb and the generation that
[1:58:20] died in the wilderness would have been
[1:58:22] the second
[1:58:23] Amen generation right but the third
[1:58:25] generation a man is those that were born
[1:58:27] in the wilderness hallelujah they were
[1:58:31] born in the woods they would have been
[1:58:33] that third generation but notice amen
[1:58:36] they would have been the ones that go
[1:58:38] into it but by the time it got to the
[1:58:40] fourth generation and they would have
[1:58:42] been experienced a blitz of the promise
[1:58:43] thing but also this was the one that
[1:58:46] would have gone into judges apostasy
[1:58:51] because in the book of Judges every man
[1:58:53] did what was right as oh nice but I need
[1:58:55] you to catch something in the scripture
[1:58:57] about the fourth generation this is why
[1:58:58] I go back to the scripture and you got
[1:59:00] to know who you are yes because the
[1:59:03] scriptures say this is the generation
[1:59:04] that seeks him now you're not because
[1:59:07] what I'm says that even as I'm preaching
[1:59:09] this if you've got a revelation you say
[1:59:11] brother Jack I understand what you're
[1:59:12] saying I get it I follow I'm not a part
[1:59:14] of that group all right that's going off
[1:59:17] into a pasta yes
[1:59:19] I understand it with the word in my
[1:59:20] generation and the reason I say that
[1:59:23] notice this notice is verse 16 watch it
[1:59:25] again but in the fourth generation they
[1:59:29] shall come hither again for the iniquity
[1:59:32] of the Amorites is not yet full so what
[1:59:35] it tells us that in the fourth
[1:59:36] generation iniquity tamaracks was gonna
[1:59:38] get full it was gonna be I mean in
[1:59:40] iniquity animal rights they were doing
[1:59:43] things that was so displeasing to God
[1:59:44] that God had to kick them out of the
[1:59:46] land but it was also in that generation
[1:59:49] that they would possess the land but
[1:59:59] when that happens is the fourth
[2:00:00] generation that goes into the land
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:06] Church I tell you what God got great
[2:00:08] things for the fourth generation and
[2:00:10] Inga's realizes this is this is yeah
[2:00:13] this is a generation where a lot of
[2:00:14] stand a lot of stuff happening that that
[2:00:16] shouldn't happen but it's also the
[2:00:17] generation that's fully I'm in they
[2:00:19] supposed to enjoy the greatness of God
[2:00:21] like no other generation
[2:00:23] they matter this is that generation that
[2:00:26] seeks him so that's why I counted from
[2:00:28] the profit I counted the profit his
[2:00:31] first generation I counted my parents
[2:00:34] would have a second generation I counted
[2:00:35] myself third generation but my children
[2:00:37] would be four generation a man we have
[2:00:41] to look at it from the angle of property
[2:00:43] look at Noah Noah was a prophet started
[2:00:45] with him then it went to him then it
[2:00:46] went the goods didn't went to Morocco
[2:00:48] all these things happen in the fourth
[2:00:50] generation but can I just read your
[2:00:51] promise I read it before I must read it
[2:00:55] again I don't need future change this is
[2:00:59] for you fourth generation believers
[2:01:02] hallelujah I'm not leaving you out there
[2:01:04] it's not just gonna come up here blast
[2:01:06] in another long till it's unfortunate
[2:01:09] reason believers go they can experience
[2:01:10] some great names they're trying to build
[2:01:13] a name for themself all right then I'll
[2:01:17] stay right here with this word gotta
[2:01:19] make you everything you need to be right
[2:01:21] here glory amen man look at this this is
[2:01:25] your promise revelation 2 4 nevertheless
[2:01:29] I have somewhat against thee because
[2:01:33] thou has left that first love to
[2:01:35] understand this you must realize that
[2:01:37] the Spirit is not speaking to the
[2:01:38] original Saints of Ephesus alone who
[2:01:41] says this message is to the entire age
[2:01:43] which lasted about a hundred and twenty
[2:01:44] years its message then as to all the
[2:01:47] generations in that span now history
[2:01:52] keeps repeating itself in the
[2:01:54] generations of Israel we see revival in
[2:01:58] one generation only to see the fires
[2:02:00] fading in the next and the third
[2:02:02] generations embers maybe glowing
[2:02:05] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[2:02:09] no vestige whatsoever of that original

[2:02:22] thing you know it's in the fourth

[2:04:45] sights set hallelujah got Trotec yeah
[2:04:50] you got your Bible but you gotta have
[2:04:52] that other future that you're looking at
[2:04:54] your back cuz you can look at your Bible
[2:04:55] through a theological silver-gilt but
[2:04:59] I'm looking at through a prophetic
[2:05:00] filters hallelujah that certain
[2:05:04] scriptures if I came to you when I
[2:05:06] understand you go try to get somebody's
[2:05:08] material try to understand this
[2:05:10] scripture but right don't get somebody
[2:05:12] that has not been vindicated take a
[2:05:15] profit live it up get your sights set
[2:05:19] you'll hit the turkey but in this
[2:05:25] generation that the original flame
[2:05:28] even the how we got here that original
[2:05:31] flame is going out hallelujah that's
[2:05:35] right let's read the rest of the course
[2:05:38] was already ahead of me he already had
[2:05:41] he already got yes
[2:05:43] they already gathered again because you
[2:05:45] know my brother told me saying I went
[2:05:46] swimming at throw in there when the when
[2:05:48] the embers I'm going out in a fire so
[2:05:54] what happened was that people walk up to
[2:05:55] me just
[2:05:59] they blow up yeah and what it does is
[2:06:02] start a fire over here now right and
[2:06:05] this is why this is why we've been
[2:06:06] talking about the Holy Ghost because
[2:06:07] Jesus and you say receive ye the Holy
[2:06:12] Ghost right so so so that's why the holy
[2:06:16] girls been pouring that we've been
[2:06:17] preaching it talking about that Holy
[2:06:18] Ghost coming in and I would say you
[2:06:20] don't want to just come on you he wants
[2:06:24] to come and when he comes by just let
[2:06:29] him in open up the door of your heart
[2:06:32] and let him II generation I love cuz
[2:06:38] when the Prophet put does he say he say
[2:06:40] he's saying up the messages to the
[2:06:41] entire age would last about 120 years
[2:06:43] its message to install generations then
[2:06:45] that's been out history keeps repeating
[2:06:46] self in the generation of Israel we see
[2:06:48] revival one generation only see the fire
[2:06:50] Satan in the next in the third
[2:06:52] generation enemas maybe glowing slightly
[2:06:54] but in the fourth there may be no
[2:06:56] vestige whatsoever of that original
[2:06:57] flame and I like this because this is a
[2:07:00] promise this this statement right here
[2:07:04] is prophecy this is what I'm looking for
[2:07:07] this is restoration
[2:07:10] this is delivery hallelujah so no matter
[2:07:14] what you see right now it's not gonna
[2:07:16] stay in that condition all you saw was a
[2:07:19] fourth generation process but the
[2:07:21] Prophet says then God so when it gets
[2:07:25] like this the ink on you know you don't
[2:07:28] have brother branham totally say say
[2:07:30] sometimes in your darkest hour ha ha ha
[2:07:33] and your caucus hour when you are tossed
[2:07:37] on the river
[2:07:37] I own the lake and don't know how you
[2:07:40] gonna get is
[2:07:41] dawna conditions all around huh anything
[2:07:46] like that big cheese's comes walking on
[2:07:49] the ward safe they say checkmate when
[2:07:51] you're done it's our then Jesus comes so
[2:07:55] here in our darkest hour in the fourth
[2:07:57] generation we see the sphere of what the
[2:08:00] devil is duck let's whip all hell breaks
[2:08:03] loose we have a promise that all heaven
[2:08:09] will also break loose
[2:08:11] then God likes the fire can hallelujah
[2:08:18] church that fell among expectation for
[2:08:21] the same generation that saw the
[2:08:24] iniquity of the amorite get fool yeah
[2:08:26] it's the same generation that possesses
[2:08:29] the promise leanness the promised land
[2:08:34] in the Holy Ghost oh y'all ain't seen
[2:08:40] nothing yet
[2:08:41] for generation y'all ain't seen nothing
[2:08:46] yet
[2:08:49] this is the generation that sees him
[2:08:52] that seek thy face o Jacob some says the
[2:09:01] same process is repeated simply the
[2:09:04] manifestation of truth that God has no
[2:09:06] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[2:09:09] by natural birth anymore them it is
[2:09:12] there any truth to apostolic succession
[2:09:14] it is it isn't in the word you start out
[2:09:17] we're truly going to give believers and
[2:09:20] when the next generation comes along
[2:09:21] they're no longer just plain Christians
[2:09:23] but they have taken a denominational
[2:09:25] name and are now Baptist Memphis
[2:09:27] etcetera that's exactly what they are -
[2:09:30] they are not Christians you have to be
[2:09:32] born of the will of God not the will of
[2:09:33] man to be saved but these folks are all
[2:09:36] coming together now by the will of man I
[2:09:38] don't say that some of them aren't right
[2:09:40] with God not for a minute do I say that
[2:09:42] but the original fire has died down they
[2:09:44] are not the same anymore he goes on the
[2:09:47] fervent desire to please God the passion
[2:09:51] to know his word the cry
[2:09:54] for reaching out in the spirit see that
[2:09:56] when we come to church with you have a
[2:09:58] fervent desire hey man every generation
[2:10:00] yes younger sa-do's don't be ashamed to
[2:10:03] praise God I talked about the one that
[2:10:06] put breath in your body
[2:10:07] Oh gave you the activity of your Linh so
[2:10:10] don't be ashamed of praise
[2:10:12] thank God you got a voice too priest
[2:10:15] then the FIR out I remember man one time
[2:10:17] I head up and got cancer in the throat
[2:10:19] and to say he couldn't he couldn't eat
[2:10:21] anymore you see you alone to just go to
[2:10:23] a Burger King and just grab a Walkman
[2:10:26] eat it but he couldn't because of the
[2:10:28] effect that we're having just imagine
[2:10:30] you not being able to do things you used
[2:10:32] to do so why you got the activity give
[2:10:36] God everything fervent desire to please
[2:10:43] God the passion to noise word the
[2:10:45] cropper reaching out in the spirit all
[2:10:48] begins to fame and instead of that
[2:10:51] church being on fire with the fire of
[2:10:52] God it hasn't cooled off and become it
[2:10:55] has cooled off and become a bit formal
[2:10:58] that is what's what was happening back
[2:11:00] there to the Ephesians they were getting
[2:11:02] a bit full the abandonment to God was
[2:11:04] dying out and the people weren't too
[2:11:06] careful about what God thought of them
[2:11:07] as they began to be careful about what
[2:11:09] the world thought of them see love not
[2:11:13] the world or the things of the world
[2:11:15] because the love of God wouldn't be any
[2:11:17] of you do that right so we don't care
[2:11:19] what the world thinks we want it we want
[2:11:21] to care about what God is that second
[2:11:24] generation coming always just like
[2:11:25] Israel they demanded a king to be like
[2:11:29] the other nations when they did that
[2:11:31] they rejected God but they did it anyway
[2:11:33] that is the history of the church when
[2:11:35] it thinks more of conforming to the
[2:11:38] world instead of conforming to God it
[2:11:40] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[2:11:43] the things they used to do no tell me I
[2:11:46] don't tell me
[2:11:50] soon as the person leave this business
[2:11:52] and it don't take them a good mind
[2:11:59] holding the standard is god yes let me
[2:12:05] just finish someone when I'm coming over
[2:12:07] right here I'm leaving
[2:12:11] he says oh my god Lord Jesus you know I
[2:12:20] was telling you last week that it was
[2:12:23] brother Branham saw the bride get out of
[2:12:25] stem and when she got under steps she
[2:12:28] was dancing same thing we see in church
[2:12:31] people doing the dance
[2:12:33] it might not be at church but it might
[2:12:35] be at a wedding they dancing brother
[2:12:38] branham saw that and he yelled get back
[2:12:41] and step right right he said when he saw
[2:12:44] that second group coming in i'ma tell
[2:12:46] you what brother Graham said he said son
[2:12:47] a second group the second preview the
[2:12:49] bride you say they came in with no
[2:12:50] makeup right the bride had no makeup
[2:12:55] when brother Branham started when they
[2:12:58] got back in Stephanie to come to me I'm
[2:13:01] just telling you what what the bride
[2:13:03] look like in the vision right Church I
[2:13:07] mean we got to get back
[2:13:09] can I see things come to be in creeping
[2:13:11] in we want to get closer to God don't
[2:13:17] bring that in God delivered us from men
[2:13:19] right so I'm gonna go back to what God
[2:13:21] deliver us from I mean I used to move
[2:13:23] like that when I was in the world I'm
[2:13:25] not going back to that I used to listen
[2:13:28] to songs like that when I was in the
[2:13:29] world I'm not listening to that boy
[2:13:33] hallelujah Church look at this he goes
[2:13:36] on to say this these things I'm just I'm
[2:13:38] sitting the man of the King to be like
[2:13:39] the other nations when they did they did
[2:13:41] to protect it God but they did it anyway
[2:13:42] that is the history of the church when
[2:13:46] it thinks more of conforming to the
[2:13:47] world instead of conforming to God it
[2:13:49] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[2:13:51] the things that used to do and start
[2:13:53] doing things they wouldn't do initially
[2:13:55] they've changed their manner
[2:13:57] dress I tell me that ain't the truth
[2:13:59] they've changed their manner of dress
[2:14:02] the dresses get shorter title I see
[2:14:09] young you know it's not a young man not
[2:14:16] supposed to have long hair trying to
[2:14:18] description for our african-american

[2:15:05] hair because the Bible tell me to do
[2:15:06] that that's brother cut my hair is that
[2:15:13] the truth what brother gave me a
[2:15:18] scripture that's not round in the
[2:15:20] corners of you hate it man I'm gonna say
[2:15:23] that's what it means but you know you
[2:15:24] think about it but it does say something
[2:15:26] round in the corners of your head there
[2:15:27] in Old Testament praise the Lord
[2:15:30] it's in there now you might have a
[2:15:32] different interpretation oh so you do
[2:15:34] what you feel but keep your hair cut
[2:15:38] but you see your medicines as soon as
[2:15:40] they as soon as they leave the word hair
[2:15:42] get nappy and I don't know what these
[2:15:46] new styles is look like somebody from
[2:15:50] Mars and then they put color the world

[2:16:30] you just weird stuff going on you're
[2:16:32] getting that from the world you're not
[2:16:34] that is not an example that you start
[2:16:36] from another Christian you've got that
[2:16:38] be somebody in the world and you want to
[2:16:41] introduce these amen Church right but
[2:16:46] these are the things episode so you know
[2:16:47] oftentimes people that struggle in those
[2:16:49] areas can I just be honest yeah I know
[2:16:52] I'm over time I'm sorry but he went
[2:16:54] struggle in those areas that's why I
[2:16:55] sneeze for them to go to church that
[2:16:57] allow them to do that yeah ain't gonna
[2:17:00] preach about that over here yeah you're
[2:17:02] right you're right being they gonna tell
[2:17:04] you a lot of things over there yeah show
[2:17:08] take your money yeah and also taking ale
[2:17:14] all right I'm moving on I'm coming to a
[2:17:17] close they demanded the King to be like
[2:17:21] the other nations when they did that
[2:17:22] they rejected God but they did it anyway
[2:17:24] that is history of the church when it
[2:17:26] thinks more conformed to the world
[2:17:27] instead of conforming to God it isn't
[2:17:29] long until you see them stop doing the
[2:17:31] things they used to do and start doing
[2:17:33] things they wouldn't do initially they
[2:17:35] wouldn't do initially they change their
[2:17:36] man address their attitudes huh notice
[2:17:39] notice oh it is that change they change
[2:17:41] their man address their attitude and
[2:17:46] their behavior Oh y'all used to talk
[2:17:51] tonight I come you know you don't put me
[2:17:57] down I put you down you put me down
[2:17:59] Yeah right
[2:18:03] they attitude because they see what's to
[2:18:06] reason the elkay talkin about cuz you
[2:18:07] can't talk about the time they attitude
[2:18:10] that change so did you say the prophecy
[2:18:12] told their attitudes their behavior look
[2:18:21] at this one they get lacks is he saying
[2:18:27] he say what'd he say sound good it what
[2:18:32] I do I know I'm good he say but if I get
[2:18:35] complacent right now walking in I do
[2:18:38] something say just gonna be a greasy
[2:18:39] spot
[2:18:41] where our stand they won't even find his
[2:18:44] body been absorbed by elements they get
[2:18:56] lakhs that is what emphasis mean relaxed
[2:19:00] and drifting why I tell you what I can
[2:19:10] keep reading forever but I just want you
[2:19:13] to see that in the fourth generation I'm
[2:19:15] not leaving you completely out there's a
[2:19:17] lot of things that we can see according
[2:19:19] to scripture when we look at Moses the
[2:19:23] children of Israel then we're coming out
[2:19:25] and they made it to the promised land
[2:19:26] that then they got next and they ended
[2:19:28] up you know in the book of Judges but if
[2:19:30] you read the book of Judges God just
[2:19:32] kept coming back and lighting the fire
[2:19:33] again kept coming back like the fire
[2:19:35] again and one-time aspiring to get lit
[2:19:37] it's gonna stay late and we got the word
[2:19:40] by that cycle anymore right you know no
[2:19:43] one knows they oven or ham cush Nimrod
[2:19:47] they went into apostasy but you just
[2:19:50] look at those things I've talked about a
[2:19:51] jaw Safed all the way down a joash and
[2:19:54] it went to apostasy but we can break
[2:19:57] that cycle yeah we can break that cycle
[2:19:59] now we have an understanding of what the
[2:20:00] devil is doing in this hour wants to the
[2:20:02] covers been pulled off on their skin
[2:20:04] let's defeat that down and the biggest
[2:20:08] thing greatest thing best thing we can
[2:20:10] do is press into the Holy Ghost and to
[2:20:14] make your shout let it make you shout
[2:20:16] make you cry let it make you cry they
[2:20:20] make you stop let it be that long as you
[2:20:26] get it that's what man is a man we need
[2:20:31] mo Holy Ghost
[2:20:33] we leave Ohana chimera amen
[2:20:37] this is the generation that seeks that
[2:20:40] face of Jacobsen live that's who we are
[2:20:45] let's pray father we're so appreciative
[2:20:49] of the word the devil is exposed we know
[2:20:54] just what he is doing his attack his
[2:20:58] tactics Lourdes tricks my god what an
[2:21:03] attack on the 4th generation and Lord as
[2:21:07] the problem was saying sometimes there
[2:21:09] are things that happen not even they
[2:21:11] don't even realize but it sins that
[2:21:12] happened in generations before them now
[2:21:15] they are under the attack of sins that
[2:21:18] were not covered under the blood years
[2:21:20] before father my prayer is that as we
[2:21:24] recognize this that we would press more
[2:21:26] and more into the Holy Ghost realizing
[2:21:30] how much more we needed God how it keeps
[2:21:34] us how it sustains us how it protects us
[2:21:37] how it Lord just provides the shelter
[2:21:41] that we need for the hour which we live
[2:21:44] though the enemy come in like a flood
[2:21:47] the Spirit of God will raise the
[2:21:48] standard and God the standard that is
[2:21:50] raised is having the word quickened to
[2:21:53] us and as that word is quickened and
[2:21:56] made alive to his God we begin to walk
[2:21:58] according to him Jesus Jesus we need
[2:22:04] more of you God we need more of you God
[2:22:08] help us Lord Jesus to draw closer you
[2:22:12] told us if we draw him out of you that
[2:22:14] you would draw mad at us we ask it in
[2:22:18] the mighty name of Jesus amen
[2:22:22] amen brother Solomon he would come and
[2:22:25] disclose the sound of today I think the
[2:22:30] song is very appropriate
[2:22:32] [Music]
