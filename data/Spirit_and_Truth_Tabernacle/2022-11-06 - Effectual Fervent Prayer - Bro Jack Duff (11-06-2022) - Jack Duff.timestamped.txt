[48:49] be in that situation much longer so
[48:51] we're trusting the Lord to open up a
[48:53] door that we cannot see
[48:55] amen amen amen
[48:59] amen James chapter 5.
[49:02] we will read a man from verse 13.
[49:09] here in James chapter 5.
[49:12] praise God
[49:15] the Bible declares is any

[49:39] anointed him with oil in the name of the
[49:43] Lord
[49:44] Amen in the prayer of faith
[49:47] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[49:50] raise him up
[49:51] and if he have committed sins they shall
[49:54] be forgiven him
[49:56] I confess your faults one to another and
[49:59] pray one for another that ye may be
[50:02] healed
[50:03] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[50:06] righteous man
[50:07] Avail it lunch
[50:10] Elias was a man subject to like passions
[50:12] as we already prayed earnestly that it
[50:14] might not rain and it rained not on the
[50:16] Earth by the space of three years and
[50:18] six months and he prayed again
[50:21] and the heaven gave ring and the Earth
[50:23] brought forth her fruit the Lord had a
[50:26] blessing to the reading of his word was
[50:28] just bow in a record of prayer father we
[50:31] thank you for the uh
[50:34] privilege of reading the word of God we
[50:38] thank you for your presence that is here
[50:40] today we know that you're here and now
[50:43] we pray that the Holy Spirit now we're
[50:44] just quick in our understanding to the
[50:47] word in which we are that we have read
[50:49] and father may you make it live for this
[50:52] very moment and which we're in and may
[50:55] the Holy Spirit take complete control of
[50:57] our thoughts uh take control of the
[51:00] congregation speak to every heart those
[51:03] that are present those that are online
[51:04] speak father the only way that you can
[51:06] God it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[51:11] God bless you you can be seated
[51:16] foreign
[51:37] we want to take for our top topic today
[51:40] uh effectual fervent fervent prayer
[51:44] a manufactured fervent prayer
[51:48] uh we we read that there in the
[51:50] scripture in verse 16 where it says
[51:53] confess your faults one to another and
[51:55] pray one for another that you may be
[51:58] healed uh the effectual further forever
[52:01] righteous man about it much and you know
[52:03] I might forget to say this later so let
[52:06] me just say this now
[52:09] um there is to me a
[52:12] um
[52:14] there's a pandemic
[52:17] that uh is going that that I've heard
[52:20] about and it's a pandemic of of mental
[52:24] health issues
[52:25] uh and uh I mean it's a pandemic and I
[52:29] I'm gonna preach a sermon on it later so
[52:31] I'm gonna try not to say too much right
[52:32] now but I do want to say this uh that
[52:35] one of the things that I have noticed
[52:37] with this pandemic is that a lot of
[52:40] people like to confess their mental
[52:43] health problems uh in a public forum
[52:47] and uh what I find in Scripture that
[52:51] that is not the way to handle anything
[52:55] you're going through like that according
[52:57] to what we just read in the Bible it
[53:00] says to do two things first is confess
[53:04] your faults one two
[53:07] another it didn't say take it publicly
[53:09] find somebody that that you can that you
[53:13] consider to be trustworthy that you can
[53:16] take that to a man and confess that to
[53:18] them that this is what I'm dealing with
[53:20] now after you confess that to him you
[53:22] don't take it to people that you look
[53:24] and just agree with you what you do is
[53:26] you take it to people that actually have
[53:28] a prayer life because after you have
[53:31] spoken these words the thing that
[53:33] they're supposed to do amen the Bible
[53:35] says is pray
[53:38] that's right for one another and the
[53:41] prayer is so that you might be healed
[53:43] that means you don't have to take it to
[53:44] the Past you can take to any other
[53:46] believer that you got confidence in you
[53:49] can take it to them and the Bible says
[53:50] that the effectual
[53:52] [Music]
[53:53] fervance
[53:55] prayer of a righteous man or woman
[53:58] avails much if you really want to be
[54:01] free
[54:02] follow the scriptural principles
[54:06] we don't want to just talk about it we
[54:08] want people to be free
[54:11] amen
[54:12] but this um this this effectual fervent
[54:16] prayer and I got just a little uh
[54:19] inspiration of of Triple A man uh with
[54:23] this Triple A man just stay with me
[54:27] um
[54:29] um here you know the uh the prophet
[54:33] makes a statement and we want to try to
[54:35] uh background and lay down you know the
[54:37] foundation for what prayer is
[54:40] um
[54:42] in this message the Supernatural and
[54:44] brother Brandon makes a statement says
[54:46] man and women
[54:49] who live in there this atmosphere prayer
[54:52] who are living there are misunderstood
[54:55] so as you see it they they become
[54:57] peculiar
[54:58] uh they don't hear the things of the
[55:02] world people that live in this state of
[55:04] prayer they don't hear the things of the
[55:06] world if they do so they sometimes they
[55:09] might hear if they do they don't pay
[55:11] attention to them
[55:13] all right now amen they don't pay
[55:15] attention to them they just move on God
[55:19] never put that in there for nothing God
[55:22] never come for just any haphazard way
[55:25] prayer is not a perhaps
[55:30] glory to God amen amen prayer is not
[55:34] something we gambling with
[55:36] amen prayer is certain
[55:39] prayer is sure
[55:42] amen pray prayers the way we get in
[55:44] contact with God
[55:46] prayer activates Triple A
[55:51] all right Hallelujah just stay with me
[55:54] here prayer is a sincere thing
[55:57] prayer is talking to God
[56:01] amen I love this prayer is not get down
[56:05] shut your eyes and thinking about your
[56:08] washing or your work you'll uh uh work
[56:10] you're doing say Lord help me and John
[56:13] and heal Miss Jones and so forth that's
[56:16] not prayer that's repeating some words
[56:20] but prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[56:24] where you realize that you're in the
[56:26] presence of God and you're moving to
[56:29] then in the deepest of sincerity
[56:33] hey man first you say a little worship
[56:37] get that now amen when you when you're
[56:39] praying and you're seeking God first
[56:42] come before God went worship
[56:44] and we're going to read that in the
[56:46] scripture in a little bit but but this
[56:47] is how you approach God always start out
[56:49] with a little worship or let them know
[56:52] how great he is let them know how good
[56:54] he is let him know I remember you did it
[56:57] before I know you're able to do it again
[57:00] Hallelujah but if you don't do it Jesus
[57:03] I'm still going to worship him and I'm
[57:05] still gonna praise you because I love
[57:07] you God
[57:09] prayer prayer amen first you say a
[57:12] little worship oh Jehovah how I love you
[57:15] you see it then after the worship of
[57:17] prayer then you come with a sincere
[57:20] heart asking
[57:22] if you abide in me not go out from
[57:25] behind the curtains in the world today
[57:27] and run around and try to get back in
[57:29] the curtains tonight if you abide in me
[57:33] my words abide in you otherwise if you
[57:36] like Aaron's Rob that's pulled up to the
[57:38] Shekinah Glory by the golden pot of
[57:40] manna where you can eat at any time and
[57:42] your soul is refreshed and blooming and
[57:44] yielding abiding if you're abide in me
[57:47] my words are bothering you then ask what
[57:49] you will it'll be given to you
[57:52] I'm gonna I'm gonna just put a pause on
[57:55] that quote right there uh I want to just
[57:58] kind of catch a scripture here out of
[58:00] Matthew six amen
[58:03] uh praise the Lord this effectual
[58:06] fervent prayer
[58:09] amen amen sometimes that's probably why
[58:12] we haven't seen answers because we're
[58:14] not coming the right way
[58:16] effectual fervent prayer uh you know
[58:19] this I'll just be honest I I got this
[58:22] little inspiration
[58:24] um it was a little over a year ago
[58:26] and uh roughly a year ago the Lord
[58:29] allowed us to just kind of approach a
[58:33] church about uh purchasing their their
[58:36] building
[58:37] and um you know I had got some inside
[58:39] information that this church was uh very
[58:43] small congregation and the older
[58:46] congregation I said you know what let me
[58:47] just approach him see if they'd be
[58:50] willing to sell and uh you know so the
[58:53] real estate agent that I was using she
[58:56] she actually uh went by the church on a
[59:00] Sunday morning and set in the
[59:01] congregation and waited for the pastor
[59:04] to finish and just hung around didn't
[59:06] know really who who waited just hung
[59:09] around and then finally this is the past
[59:10] approached her and said can I help you
[59:13] and she's like uh yeah I'm looking to
[59:14] talk to the pastor of the church he's
[59:16] like I'm the pastor so she start telling
[59:18] him you know what our what her plan was
[59:20] and she was representing our church and
[59:22] that she was there uh you know he said
[59:25] okay I'll sit down at least talk to you
[59:26] so we got lunch prepared and I went down
[59:29] there and sat with lunch with the with
[59:30] the pastor and mine he was telling me
[59:33] that you know he said you know years ago
[59:35] there was a church that I was speaking
[59:36] in I was filling in for pastor they had
[59:38] lost their passing I was filling in and
[59:40] I walked out you know to the church and
[59:42] I read James 5 the factual forever
[59:45] righteous man rebellious much and uh and
[59:48] he said I walked out and I just began to
[59:50] uh I read my scripture and it says that
[59:53] church when I read it it said they said
[59:55] read it again
[59:57] so you know what kind of turkey with
[59:58] that amen read it again and you say the
[1:00:01] affection for every righteous man
[1:00:03] available as much he said I don't think
[1:00:04] he understood why they said read it
[1:00:06] again because that really struck a chord
[1:00:09] you know for them and uh so he was
[1:00:11] telling me that story and I said well
[1:00:12] yes you know you don't realize I'm
[1:00:14] praying over your church and uh and you
[1:00:17] just telling me the effectual fervent
[1:00:18] prayer of a righteous man Avail much you
[1:00:21] know and I just kind of held on to that
[1:00:22] for a little bit and you know and and I
[1:00:24] just just kind of had it in my notes and
[1:00:26] and I ran into something else uh here
[1:00:28] lately and I said you know what I think
[1:00:29] I'm a preach this sermon uh but I just
[1:00:31] want to just kind of talk about this
[1:00:33] prayer amen today because Prayer Changes
[1:00:36] Things
[1:00:37] prayer prayer settles things
[1:00:40] prayer prayer is our weapon
[1:00:43] come on church prayer is our weapon
[1:00:47] amen glory to God is the greatest weapon
[1:00:49] we have in our under our control amen we
[1:00:52] got to use it
[1:00:54] Hallelujah glory to God Amen so here
[1:00:57] let's pick up Matthew uh six verse 5 and
[1:01:01] uh here you know brother Brandon's just
[1:01:03] telling us in this when we're
[1:01:04] approaching God come amen with a uh with
[1:01:07] pretty much the attitude of Thanksgiving
[1:01:09] let's start with Thanksgiving and Jesus
[1:01:11] actually says that here in Matthew
[1:01:13] chapter 6 verse 5 praise God Amen uh he
[1:01:19] says this and when thou
[1:01:21] when thou and when thou praise thou
[1:01:24] should not be be as the Hypocrites are
[1:01:26] for they love to pray standing in the
[1:01:29] synagogues and in the corners of the
[1:01:31] streets that they may be seen of them
[1:01:33] verily I say unto you they have their
[1:01:36] reward amen but thou when thou prayers
[1:01:40] enter come on now into thy closet and
[1:01:44] when thou has shut thy door pray to thy
[1:01:47] father which is in secret and thy father
[1:01:50] would seeth in secret shall reward thee
[1:01:53] openly
[1:01:54] all right amen but when you uh when you
[1:01:58] pray use not vain repetition as a
[1:02:01] heathen do for they think that they
[1:02:03] shall be heard for their much speaking
[1:02:07] but uh be not ye therefore like unto
[1:02:09] them for your father knoweth what things
[1:02:11] ye have need of Amen before you ask him
[1:02:15] so if God already know what I need
[1:02:17] before I ask him then why does he want
[1:02:19] me to pray because that's the way y'all
[1:02:22] communicate that's the way he talks to
[1:02:24] you and you talk to him praise God I'm
[1:02:27] even you know I'm the same way I'm a
[1:02:29] father myself and you know my I might
[1:02:31] know that my children might need
[1:02:33] something amen but oftentimes I'm
[1:02:36] waiting for that child to ask for what
[1:02:39] they need I don't want to just assume I
[1:02:42] want them to ask what they need and then
[1:02:44] as a father I like to step up and try to
[1:02:46] amen make that thing happen for them
[1:02:48] when I wait for my children to ask
[1:02:50] sometimes I don't want to get ahead of
[1:02:52] the game they may be trying to work it
[1:02:54] out on their own hallelujah amen but
[1:02:57] when they come in their ass then it
[1:02:59] invoked something inside of me same
[1:03:01] thing with God when we go to God and we
[1:03:04] ask it invoked something out of God he
[1:03:07] wants to meet your need he wants to heal
[1:03:09] your body he wants to satisfy your soul
[1:03:12] he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:14] he wants to do these things he wants to
[1:03:17] do it more for you than you want it
[1:03:19] yourself
[1:03:21] okay
[1:03:23] look at this and that but when you pray
[1:03:25] he was not vain repetitions as the
[1:03:27] Heathen do for they think that they
[1:03:29] shall be heard for their much speaking
[1:03:31] be not ye therefore like unto them for
[1:03:34] your father knoweth what things you have
[1:03:36] neither before you ask him look at this
[1:03:39] verse 9 after this manner therefore pray
[1:03:41] you our father Jesus given us how to
[1:03:44] pray and this is the worship part Our
[1:03:46] Father which art in heaven
[1:03:48] Hallowed that is worship brother Brandon
[1:03:51] said praise approach him with worship
[1:03:53] with Thanksgiving Hallowed be thy name
[1:03:56] hallelujah look at this thy kingdom come
[1:04:00] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:04:03] heaven amen even before you ask what you
[1:04:08] need realize that his will must be done
[1:04:12] amen So you you're submitting yourself
[1:04:14] to God's will before you even ask
[1:04:17] come on church amen thy kingdom come thy
[1:04:21] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[1:04:24] give us this day our daily bread and
[1:04:27] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:04:29] debtors and lead us not into temptation
[1:04:32] but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is
[1:04:35] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:04:37] forever amen
[1:04:41] Schofield made some notes on this prayer
[1:04:43] and he uh he says these in in in just
[1:04:46] his notes he says prayer begins with the
[1:04:48] attitude of worship that's what brother
[1:04:50] Branham just said uh it's Hallowed be
[1:04:52] thy name this is an acknowledgment of of
[1:04:55] the absolute Holiness of all that God is
[1:04:57] and does we acknowledge his Holiness
[1:05:00] prayer contains an element of
[1:05:02] Thanksgiving who can hallow God which
[1:05:05] means to hold him sacred and offer
[1:05:07] worship to him amen who can handle a god
[1:05:09] without Thanksgiving all right another
[1:05:12] thing Schofield says true prayer accepts
[1:05:15] in advance the will of God true prayer
[1:05:19] accepts in advance the will of God
[1:05:22] whether known or unknown whether to
[1:05:24] Grant or to withhold we still accept
[1:05:26] Amen in advance the will of God all
[1:05:29] right also another thing about prayer
[1:05:31] prayer should always Envision the Divine
[1:05:34] will and Kingdom as objectives which
[1:05:37] will be realized on Earth so prayer
[1:05:40] again should always end Vision the
[1:05:42] Divine will and Kingdom as objectives
[1:05:45] when uh which will be realized on Earth
[1:05:48] that's why I say thy kingdom come thy
[1:05:50] will be done as it is in heaven it'll be
[1:05:53] done on Earth let me pick up the rest of
[1:05:56] this quote here that I just stopped that
[1:05:58] brother Branham tells us there amen
[1:06:00] prayers not haphazard amen prayer is not
[1:06:04] just get down and just say a little
[1:06:06] repeating of words amen uh prayers just
[1:06:09] getting getting real sincere before God
[1:06:11] you know just I think it was this week
[1:06:15] yes it was this week I had a specific
[1:06:18] need amen and I said you know and I had
[1:06:20] a number of things that would just count
[1:06:22] on my plate and I said I just just got
[1:06:24] to go into my closet and I don't mean a
[1:06:26] physical closet it's just a a special
[1:06:28] place you can go to and it's just you
[1:06:31] and God alone so I just went into my
[1:06:33] office and shut the door and I I got
[1:06:35] down I began to pray and I just began to
[1:06:37] Worship the Lord amen and and you know
[1:06:40] I'm gonna tell you something about
[1:06:40] prayer Hallelujah uh it don't take God a
[1:06:44] long time to answer you
[1:06:46] now some things he might have you wait
[1:06:49] on
[1:06:49] amen but sometimes God will just come
[1:06:52] immediately and speak to you prayer is
[1:06:54] not always you doing the talking
[1:06:57] prayer sometimes is getting your spirit
[1:06:59] quiet enough where you can listen and
[1:07:02] hear what God has to speak to you so I
[1:07:04] had a specific need that I was that I
[1:07:06] was I was I was uh kind of looking for
[1:07:08] and you know and I knew kind of what it
[1:07:10] was and I just counted Lord if you know
[1:07:12] if it's your will whatever you want to
[1:07:14] do in this situation God I'm just gonna
[1:07:16] bring it to you give me your wisdom on
[1:07:18] how to handle it and if it's not for me
[1:07:20] to handle then just let me Let It Go and
[1:07:22] uh and as I just begin to just seek the
[1:07:24] Lord uh the Lord remind him says uh I
[1:07:27] need a worker for a particular thing
[1:07:29] amen and and Lord say uh remember uh in
[1:07:33] the prayer he's telling me say remember
[1:07:34] so and so fill out an application call
[1:07:36] her she'll be the one to do the job I
[1:07:39] say uh
[1:07:41] wrote that down real quick and then I
[1:07:43] kept praying and uh and when I got up
[1:07:44] from praying I sent the little text to
[1:07:46] the young lady and she didn't respond to
[1:07:48] me before you know I think about four or
[1:07:50] five hours went by she responded to say
[1:07:52] yes I would love to take that position
[1:07:54] and I and I got all connected and then
[1:07:56] when she got with the client the client
[1:07:58] said this lady know what she doing
[1:08:01] but I got the answer for that particular
[1:08:04] person to be the caregiver through
[1:08:06] prayer
[1:08:08] God will speak to you and give you the
[1:08:10] answer that you need if you could just
[1:08:12] stop for a moment and seek his space
[1:08:16] oh Hallelujah whatever you've gone
[1:08:18] through in life prayer is what you use
[1:08:21] to get in contact with God
[1:08:24] it activates Triple Eight
[1:08:27] let me just go on a little bit more in
[1:08:29] this in this quote Supernatural reading
[1:08:31] brother random says you see the failures
[1:08:33] of the church the Pentecostal Church the
[1:08:36] method is the Baptist and all it's a
[1:08:38] failing to that uh to that abide and
[1:08:40] grace of God tonight you'll shout and
[1:08:42] clap your hands and dance in the aisles
[1:08:45] speak in tongues that's gifts gifts is
[1:08:47] no good unless you're abiding in the
[1:08:49] Shekinah Glory
[1:08:53] we don't want folk just coming here with
[1:08:55] gifts we want people that's got a life
[1:08:57] of Prayer
[1:08:59] they are they sincere amen they're
[1:09:02] serving God in sincerity amen now God
[1:09:04] can anoint those people in the
[1:09:06] congregation Hallelujah it says he says
[1:09:08] this uh uh uh uh those things are fine I
[1:09:12] have nothing to say against them they're
[1:09:14] of God shouting and blessing God is
[1:09:16] wonderful speaking in tongues or
[1:09:18] translation in tongues or I mean
[1:09:20] interpretation of tongues it's the same
[1:09:21] all these other things Gifts of healing
[1:09:24] prophecies and and all these things are
[1:09:26] marvelous but they're no good they're
[1:09:29] not fruitful they can't yield the right
[1:09:31] uh they're you you're the right unless
[1:09:33] you're living in the presence of the
[1:09:35] Shekinah the atmosphere around you is
[1:09:38] Godly
[1:09:39] all right that's the reason that men and
[1:09:41] women are not permitted to these things
[1:09:43] because you go out here and call a
[1:09:44] blessing over something uh got it curse
[1:09:47] a curse something got it bless it's a
[1:09:49] abiding presence to know the will of God
[1:09:52] then don't don't look uh what the
[1:09:55] world's gonna say about you is what God
[1:09:57] thinks about you then you're living in
[1:10:00] his presence
[1:10:03] oh Lord that's exactly where we want to
[1:10:05] live
[1:10:06] in the presence in his presence this
[1:10:09] effectual fervent prayer
[1:10:14] is uh fervent is active that's what
[1:10:17] fervent means it's active it's having or
[1:10:20] displaying a passionate intensity
[1:10:23] amen fervin is is having a or displaying
[1:10:27] a passionate intensity
[1:10:29] right uh effects was having Invincible
[1:10:32] energy
[1:10:34] I like these words effectual having
[1:10:37] invincible
[1:10:38] energy you know you realize when you
[1:10:41] pray in the name of Jesus
[1:10:44] it's just as if Jesus himself was
[1:10:48] praying Jesus was never denied by God
[1:10:51] let me tell you something you also will
[1:10:53] never be denied by God sometimes the
[1:10:55] answer is yes sometimes the answer is no
[1:10:58] and sometimes the answer is not yet but
[1:11:01] you'll never be denied by God
[1:11:04] amen but it's effectual is having
[1:11:07] Invincible energy and I wrote this note
[1:11:10] down this type of prayer will not take
[1:11:12] no for an answer
[1:11:15] any sexual prayers a prayer that won't
[1:11:17] take no for an answer now I might have
[1:11:19] to wait on it amen but I'm not taking no
[1:11:22] for an answer hey I might have to wait
[1:11:24] on my healing but I'm not taking no for
[1:11:27] an answer I might have to wait for that
[1:11:29] bill to be paid but I'm not taking no
[1:11:31] for an answer
[1:11:32] oh Hallelujah somebody amen if that's
[1:11:36] what the prayer with Invincible energy
[1:11:38] amen this is a prayer that is certain
[1:11:41] that the answer will be yes
[1:11:44] I like this amen of valeth when it says
[1:11:47] available much is to have strength to
[1:11:49] overcome to be a force amen that's what
[1:11:52] this available I want to just kind of go
[1:11:54] I got a a a
[1:11:56] um a PowerPoint that I just want to
[1:11:58] share with you I was doing some research
[1:12:00] and um uh just looking at this this
[1:12:03] topic of prayer and and Charles Spurgeon
[1:12:06] it's kind of just wanted to see what he
[1:12:08] had to say about prayer and there are
[1:12:10] some things he wrote some statements
[1:12:12] down and I just want to share some of
[1:12:13] those statements with you of of what he
[1:12:15] said about prayer praise God praise God
[1:12:18] in that um I have a uh the the what's
[1:12:22] called there it is amen
[1:12:24] um just a couple statements here the
[1:12:26] very Act of Prayer is a blessing
[1:12:30] get that just a very Act of prayer is a
[1:12:33] blessing and I remember I think it was
[1:12:35] brother Jason that mentioned to us that
[1:12:37] what made us different from any other
[1:12:39] animal that soul that we have on the
[1:12:40] inside is it has the ability to contact
[1:12:44] its maker
[1:12:46] the soul can connect to God In Prayer
[1:12:49] this is a I mean it's a direct
[1:12:52] connection it's a direct Channel when
[1:12:55] you use prayer it's a direct channel to
[1:12:57] get into the presence of God Amen the
[1:13:00] very Act of prayer is a blessing another
[1:13:03] statement he makes is to pray is to
[1:13:06] enter the Treasure House of God and to
[1:13:10] gather riches out of an inexhaustible
[1:13:12] storehouse
[1:13:15] when I pray I enter into Treasure House
[1:13:20] oh my I can just see myself looking
[1:13:24] around amen and brother Brandon even
[1:13:26] told to say when you pray climb up on
[1:13:28] that ladder amen get all the way to the
[1:13:30] very top don't just take the things that
[1:13:33] you can get to down here them five
[1:13:35] dollar blessings are them ten dollar
[1:13:37] blessings God I need ten thousand I need
[1:13:41] twenty thousand I need fifty thousand I
[1:13:44] need a million God
[1:13:46] I'm climbing way to the top and I'm
[1:13:49] going into the storehouse Amen to gather
[1:13:52] riches out of an inexhaustible
[1:13:54] storehouse
[1:13:57] this other statement he makes he says
[1:13:59] you are before the Lord when you're
[1:14:01] praying you are before the Lord
[1:14:03] let your words be for you
[1:14:08] you gotta you gotta remember who you
[1:14:10] talking to
[1:14:12] you ever took you before the one that
[1:14:14] can change the situation
[1:14:16] in prayer especially when you come with
[1:14:19] that attitude of gratitude with that
[1:14:21] Thanksgiving it puts you into his
[1:14:22] presence and now when you get there
[1:14:24] realize whose presence you're in
[1:14:27] let your words be for you
[1:14:29] and let your heart be perfect
[1:14:31] let your Words Be Few and let your heart
[1:14:34] be fervent another statement he makes he
[1:14:37] says as well you can as well could you
[1:14:40] expect a plant to grow without air and
[1:14:44] water as you expect your heart to grow
[1:14:46] without praying faith
[1:14:49] amen look at this another one You
[1:14:51] observe that the desire to commune with
[1:14:55] God and that's what prayer is it's not
[1:14:56] all all the time just asking asking
[1:14:59] asking but it's a desire to commune with
[1:15:01] God you know there are times where I've
[1:15:04] already asked and God has already
[1:15:06] answered and now my responsibility go
[1:15:08] back and thank him
[1:15:09] that's that's prayer now I go back and I
[1:15:12] start thanking him for what he did
[1:15:13] that's me communicating with my God
[1:15:16] hallelujah glory to God Amen he says you
[1:15:20] will observe that desire to commune with
[1:15:22] God is intensified by the failure of all
[1:15:27] other sources of consolation
[1:15:31] your desire to commune with God is
[1:15:33] intentional I didn't mean you get
[1:15:35] desperate when everybody else is saying
[1:15:36] no and you can't get no answer from no
[1:15:38] you get desperate you go before God Amen
[1:15:40] You observe that the desire to come in
[1:15:42] with God is intensified by the failure
[1:15:45] of all other sources of consolation
[1:15:50] prayer is the best response
[1:15:54] to hatred
[1:16:01] prayer this is Charles Spurgeon making
[1:16:04] these comments prayer is the best
[1:16:06] response to hatred
[1:16:09] glory to God here's another one it is
[1:16:12] well said that neglected prayer is the
[1:16:16] birthplace of all evil
[1:16:19] me
[1:16:21] neglected prayer is the birthplace
[1:16:25] for all evil
[1:16:28] amen here's another one prayer is an art
[1:16:33] which only the spirit can teach us
[1:16:36] I think uh
[1:16:40] yeah only the spirit can teach us he is
[1:16:43] The Giver of all prayers
[1:16:46] I love that only spiritual teachers hey
[1:16:49] man here's another one no man can
[1:16:51] progress in Grace
[1:16:54] if people seeks prayer
[1:16:58] the actual fervent prayer amen no man
[1:17:01] can progress in Grace if people say
[1:17:03] prayer and here's one more he who knows
[1:17:07] how to overcome with God In Prayer has
[1:17:10] Heaven and Earth at his disposal
[1:17:17] you get into the storehouse anytime you
[1:17:20] need to but you're not just going in
[1:17:22] just to get things from God but you're
[1:17:25] going in because you want to have a
[1:17:26] relationship with them
[1:17:29] knowing that he is the give of every
[1:17:31] good gift
[1:17:32] hallelujah hallelujah all right let's
[1:17:34] move on a little bit I'm gonna come back
[1:17:36] I got some more from Charles Spurgeon
[1:17:37] there but I'll come back to that in a
[1:17:39] second amen here um
[1:17:42] when we look at this scripture
[1:17:46] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:17:47] righteous man about much fervent is
[1:17:49] active effectual is having Invincible
[1:17:52] energy available is to be a forced
[1:17:56] um I was just looking amen at some notes
[1:17:58] here from Schofield and Scofield type he
[1:18:02] actually uh said the prayer of faith let
[1:18:04] me just read this out of verse 15 again
[1:18:06] uh James 5 15.
[1:18:09] it says in the prayer of faith
[1:18:11] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[1:18:14] raise him up and if he have committed
[1:18:17] sins they shall be forgiven him confess
[1:18:20] your false one to another and pray one
[1:18:21] for another that you may be healed the
[1:18:23] effectual fervent prayable righteous man
[1:18:25] of God much now um Scofield tied a note
[1:18:29] here in uh verse 15 the prayer of faith
[1:18:32] he tied that to mark 11.
[1:18:35] I like that tie-in and I want us to read
[1:18:38] Mark 11 22.
[1:18:40] glory to God this effectual fervent
[1:18:43] prayer amen this prayer fake tied over
[1:18:45] here to Mark 11. Amen in verse 22 and
[1:18:49] Mark 11 says and Jesus answering saith
[1:18:51] unto them have faith in God
[1:18:56] glory for verily I say unto you that
[1:19:00] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:19:03] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:19:08] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:19:11] but shall believe that those things
[1:19:13] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:19:17] shall have
[1:19:19] whatsoever he saith
[1:19:22] glory to God therefore I send to you
[1:19:24] what things soever you desire
[1:19:27] when ye pray believe that you receive
[1:19:32] them and ye shall have them see prayer
[1:19:34] ain't gonna take no for an answer
[1:19:36] all right amen it goes on the sex and
[1:19:39] when you stand praying for kids if they
[1:19:42] have all the gifts in it that your
[1:19:43] father also which is in heaven May
[1:19:45] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[1:19:47] do not forgive neither will your father
[1:19:49] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:19:51] trespasses now I love the way Schofield
[1:19:53] tied that Amen to Mark 11 this prayer of
[1:19:56] faith and I want to just kind of pick up
[1:19:58] a couple quotes amen from Brother
[1:19:59] Branham uh regarding that this this
[1:20:02] first one is coming out of service we
[1:20:03] would see Jesus amen serves we will see
[1:20:06] Jesus look at what the prophet says he
[1:20:08] says we should never glory to God I like
[1:20:11] this one here we should never live under
[1:20:15] our privileges as we are today
[1:20:19] that's what they say we should never
[1:20:21] live under our privileges as we are
[1:20:24] today the great powers of God lays
[1:20:27] within the reach of every member of the
[1:20:30] body of Christ look at this he says
[1:20:33] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:20:36] pray believe that you receive it and you
[1:20:40] shall have it it shall be given to you
[1:20:48] I don't care what the devil say Amen
[1:20:50] I'ma activate amen my connection with
[1:20:54] god
[1:20:55] oh Hallelujah and prayer is what I use
[1:20:59] to activate that connection any time of
[1:21:03] the day I can start praying anywhere I
[1:21:06] can pray glory to God I can be my call
[1:21:09] just driving down the street knocking
[1:21:11] into into prayer I can be in my closet
[1:21:14] in the house I can enter into prayer
[1:21:16] Glory to God I can be walking down the
[1:21:19] hall of my of my job and I can enter
[1:21:22] into prayer wherever I go and I get a
[1:21:25] direct connection
[1:21:27] praise God Amen the connection is never
[1:21:30] broken
[1:21:32] and it's never fussing going in and out
[1:21:34] it's direct praise God
[1:21:37] Hallelujah and it activates Heaven on my
[1:21:40] behalf

[1:21:44] do anything
[1:21:45] effectual fervent prayer of the
[1:21:48] righteous avails much
[1:21:51] I'm tired of living underneath my
[1:21:53] privileges amen I'm tired of it he said
[1:21:56] he says it shall be given to you it says
[1:21:58] I was reading in the Lexicon the other
[1:22:00] day over there and look at the scripture
[1:22:02] I was just quoting the original habit
[1:22:04] when thou press he says here's what I
[1:22:06] want to get to he said if you should say
[1:22:09] to this mountain
[1:22:10] be thou plucked up and cast into the sea
[1:22:14] amen and believe in your heart
[1:22:17] that is being done believe that it's
[1:22:19] being done believe that it is being done
[1:22:24] you catch those words believe that it is
[1:22:26] being done
[1:22:28] amen even right now my healing is
[1:22:30] manifested
[1:22:32] even right now my child is on the way
[1:22:34] back
[1:22:35] my way with child is on the way back
[1:22:37] amen you gotta see it being done no
[1:22:41] matter what you hear no matter what the
[1:22:43] doctor says no matter about anybody you
[1:22:46] gotta see it being done through prayer
[1:22:49] look at this now Glory he says uh now a
[1:22:53] lot of people that say pray for me
[1:22:54] brother all right Lord help this dear
[1:22:57] brother give them a prayer card and and
[1:22:59] best you can and they've seen others
[1:23:01] heal night after night time after time
[1:23:03] uh I didn't get it I'll try it again
[1:23:06] tomorrow night you discredit God
[1:23:10] you discredit God you discredit his
[1:23:13] words now now notice what he just said
[1:23:15] this is the person that keep coming into
[1:23:16] the prayer line
[1:23:18] they've been prayed for once amen and
[1:23:21] nodded back again Hallelujah and they
[1:23:24] say you discredited in God when you do
[1:23:25] that now remember brother Branham gave
[1:23:27] some very good advice to uh uh blind
[1:23:30] John Ryan because he he got in the
[1:23:33] prayer line multiple times he said now a
[1:23:35] brother Brandon you prayed for him you
[1:23:36] told me I was healed you say yes you are
[1:23:39] healed and he said not only not only did
[1:23:41] I tell you I was here you told me you
[1:23:44] believed it
[1:23:46] right he said well I do believe it and
[1:23:49] and I believe what you said and I
[1:23:50] believe I'm Healed he said it's just
[1:23:52] something going wrong he said he said no
[1:23:53] brother this is what you need to do he
[1:23:55] says since you believe what I said amen
[1:23:57] you've already been prayed for not go
[1:24:00] thanking God for being healed
[1:24:03] hey Hallelujah you don't already ask God
[1:24:06] for this blessing and that blessing now
[1:24:09] it's time for you to start thanking God
[1:24:11] and let me taste some God do things
[1:24:13] opposite
[1:24:15] we think we think people after they have
[1:24:18] given us something
[1:24:20] we thank them after they give us a gift
[1:24:22] we say thank you after it happens and I
[1:24:25] think that's actually caused us to to
[1:24:27] doubt God sometimes because the way we
[1:24:30] treat one another in just this uh human
[1:24:32] relationship but God wants us to start
[1:24:35] thanking him before we even receive it
[1:24:39] before we see the manifestation of it we
[1:24:43] thank him because our things will bring
[1:24:46] it into manifestation
[1:24:49] Hallelujah
[1:24:54] Hallelujah it says watch if you believe
[1:24:57] in your heart that is being done maybe
[1:25:00] that mountain looks just exactly like it
[1:25:03] always looked
[1:25:04] but in your heart
[1:25:07] you believe it there might not be but
[1:25:10] one little grain of sand but something
[1:25:13] is tearing loose
[1:25:17] I got a big mountain and I just said be
[1:25:20] cast into the sea and this mountain only
[1:25:23] lost one grain of sand but it still
[1:25:25] looked like a big mountain I'm not
[1:25:28] looking at the mountain I'm looking at
[1:25:31] the grain of sand that left because if
[1:25:34] one thing of sand will leave then the
[1:25:36] next screen of sand will leave and the
[1:25:38] next grain of sand relief and before you
[1:25:40] know it that mountain that's become a
[1:25:42] plane
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:46] focus on the grain of sand not the
[1:25:49] mountain
[1:25:54] something's tearing loose something
[1:25:56] began to take place see when we believe
[1:25:59] that it's being done but you'll see we
[1:26:01] just want something spontaneously
[1:26:05] and what do we get left out left out
[1:26:07] because it weakens
[1:26:09] in a few nights I want to get on that on
[1:26:12] faith the Lord hosting of the the Lord
[1:26:15] of hosts in you see so see we don't want
[1:26:18] this thing just to weaken us we want to
[1:26:20] stay amen committed to the journey and
[1:26:22] that's what effectual fervent prayer is
[1:26:24] it's it's remained an active remaining
[1:26:26] engaged amen remaining remaining
[1:26:30] committed not taking No Finance it might
[1:26:32] not be yet but I'ma get it because this
[1:26:35] is in the will of God it's in the will
[1:26:37] of God for me to have my children
[1:26:39] it's in the will of God no matter what
[1:26:41] I'ma just keep praying
[1:26:47] let me uh pick up a little bit more from
[1:26:50] spurt
[1:26:53] these statements that he make I think is
[1:26:55] real blessing
[1:27:00] this this other one amen uh I thought I
[1:27:04] had did a update to this but it looked
[1:27:06] like it's a repeat but I'll say it again
[1:27:08] because maybe God wanted to say it again
[1:27:10] prayer itself is an art which only the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost can teach us
[1:27:15] he is The Giver of all prayer
[1:27:17] pray for prayer
[1:27:27] pray for prayer
[1:27:31] pray till you can pray
[1:27:35] foreign
[1:27:43] he says this if if you want that
[1:27:45] Splendid power in prayer
[1:27:48] you must remain in loving
[1:27:51] abiding Union with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:57] look at this one
[1:27:59] a mighty piece of weaponry
[1:28:02] in the Battle of prayer is God's promise
[1:28:10] let's let's make sure we got that a
[1:28:14] mighty piece of weaponry
[1:28:17] in the Battle of prayer is God's promise
[1:28:20] and what I what I've always uh told you
[1:28:23] just a few weeks ago when we were
[1:28:24] preaching amen
[1:28:26] um uh the battle's not yours amen and I
[1:28:30] forget what we titled but the battle is
[1:28:32] the Lord I showed you all how uh they
[1:28:35] begin to remind God of his promise while
[1:28:38] they were praying amen so a mighty piece
[1:28:42] of Weaponry Amen in the Battle of prayer
[1:28:44] is God's promise you have to know God's
[1:28:47] promises so you can remind him of what
[1:28:50] he said
[1:28:51] so another thing that's going to go
[1:28:53] along with prayers reading your Bible
[1:28:55] we heard a prophet say Amen that I for a
[1:28:59] Christian to grow stronger amen they
[1:29:01] ought to pray and read their Bible every
[1:29:03] day
[1:29:06] read your Bible to understand his
[1:29:09] promises amen and then in prayer you can
[1:29:11] remind him of what his word said
[1:29:15] I don't know about you but you know and
[1:29:17] some of y'all fathers hey man you've had
[1:29:19] children that will remind you Daddy you
[1:29:20] said
[1:29:23] and you know I'm gonna tell you
[1:29:25] something when when when when that child
[1:29:27] come with a daddy you said
[1:29:29] it changed everything
[1:29:31] all the excuses
[1:29:33] go out the window I know I said but no
[1:29:37] you don't use that link you you when you
[1:29:39] hear Daddy you said like
[1:29:44] you're right child I did say it I don't
[1:29:47] know how but we gonna make this thing
[1:29:48] happen because as a father you want to
[1:29:51] come true and if you got that inside of
[1:29:54] you where you think you got that from
[1:29:56] that comes from almighty God when we
[1:29:59] remind him daddy you said
[1:30:02] daddy you promise daddy you spoke this
[1:30:05] to me
[1:30:06] Oh Daddy I know you won't let me down
[1:30:08] daddy you never failed me yet Daddy
[1:30:16] a mighty piece of weapon in the battle
[1:30:18] prayers God's promise here's another one
[1:30:21] cold prayers
[1:30:23] asked for denial
[1:30:27] so you got to be sincere when you're
[1:30:30] approaching God
[1:30:31] come with a heart a heart heart of
[1:30:33] gratitude amen and stop thinking from
[1:30:35] what he's already done and Lord let your
[1:30:37] will be done in this situation too
[1:30:40] but cold prayers asked for tonight
[1:30:43] and y'all know we sometimes give God
[1:30:44] them cold prayers
[1:30:46] well Lord I'm supposed to pray about it
[1:30:48] so I'ma just uh that's a cold prayer and
[1:30:51] you just asking for denial
[1:30:56] here's another one groanings which
[1:30:58] cannot be uttered are often prayers
[1:31:01] which cannot be refused
[1:31:08] I get in prayer and I don't even know
[1:31:09] what to say anymore
[1:31:13] I don't know if you've ever been there
[1:31:15] before don't even know what to say when
[1:31:17] you're praying
[1:31:19] grownness that cannot be uttered
[1:31:23] are often prayers which cannot be
[1:31:25] refused foreign
[1:31:30] here's another one true prayers Trading
[1:31:33] of the heart with God
[1:31:37] that's what thou will be done
[1:31:39] not not my will but let your will be
[1:31:41] done I'ma treat my heart with yours
[1:31:43] what's your desire guard in this
[1:31:46] true prayers training of the heart with
[1:31:48] God
[1:31:49] here's another one sometimes when we do
[1:31:52] not receive confidence in our prayers
[1:31:54] when we are broken and cast down that is
[1:31:57] when we are really wrestling and
[1:31:59] prevailing in prayer
[1:32:01] when we don't receive comfort in our
[1:32:04] prayers when we are broken and cast down
[1:32:05] that is when we're really wrestling and
[1:32:07] prevailing in prayer here's another one
[1:32:09] I like this one
[1:32:11] prayer plumes the wings of young English
[1:32:16] so that they may learn to mount Above
[1:32:19] the Clouds
[1:32:21] because you know Eagles the bill is a
[1:32:23] bird that's built to rise above a storm
[1:32:25] they don't just get trapped down inside
[1:32:27] the storm they can actually rise above a
[1:32:29] storm and what what prayer does prayer
[1:32:31] is the tools that you use to get you
[1:32:34] above the storm
[1:32:36] prayer brings in a strength to God's
[1:32:39] Warriors amen and sends them forth to
[1:32:43] spiritual battle with their muscles firm
[1:32:45] and their armor in place
[1:32:49] I love this here's another one that he
[1:32:51] says
[1:32:52] we know not what prayer cannot do
[1:32:58] and there's some double negatives all
[1:33:00] over the place
[1:33:01] but we know not what prayer cannot do
[1:33:07] that means prayer can do
[1:33:15] prayer can do anything
[1:33:17] there's no limits when a Believer gets
[1:33:20] on their knees and begin to pray and
[1:33:22] there's sometimes you can't even get on
[1:33:24] your knees
[1:33:25] but you just enter into the channel
[1:33:29] wherever you are entering to the channel
[1:33:32] realize the power that you have that is
[1:33:34] in your prayer
[1:33:36] can we go a little further
[1:33:38] here the uh
[1:33:42] okay
[1:33:47] I said uh
[1:33:49] Triple A
[1:33:54] and as I was thinking about this I just
[1:33:56] began to think you know about out you
[1:33:58] know a lot of times we use prayer we
[1:34:00] kind of use it like Triple A
[1:34:04] hello somebody
[1:34:08] only oh you only called AAA
[1:34:14] but that's not prayer
[1:34:17] that that's not that's not communicating
[1:34:19] with God when you have an emergency
[1:34:21] that's the only time you go to him
[1:34:24] no that's not how we want to treat God
[1:34:26] now we know he'll be there in in a time
[1:34:29] of emergency but that's not the only
[1:34:31] time we're going to talk to him
[1:34:32] come on somebody
[1:34:34] right amen I I I I begin to just think
[1:34:37] about this prayer is not just roadside
[1:34:40] assistance to the believer
[1:34:42] foreign
[1:34:46] how we communicate with our maker
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:50] amen I said prayer is not just asking
[1:34:54] but prayer is also thanking
[1:34:58] first Thessalonians 5 18 says this in
[1:35:01] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:35:04] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:35:06] you
[1:35:07] I started looking at this you know AAA I
[1:35:10] did a little uh uh uh uh uh Google
[1:35:14] search hey man and and I said well I
[1:35:17] said what's the benefits of having AAA
[1:35:20] and uh you know and as I as I start
[1:35:22] researching some some other things came
[1:35:24] up and and let me just kind of tell you
[1:35:26] what my uh my Triple A is my AAA that
[1:35:29] I'm talking to you today is activating
[1:35:31] Angelic assistance
[1:35:36] so prayer is your AAA
[1:35:38] prayers were activates
[1:35:41] Angelic assistance
[1:35:43] Hallelujah now now as I looked at this
[1:35:47] amen and Google it brought up amen
[1:35:50] um a uh uh
[1:35:53] a term for ah I.T information technology
[1:35:58] or computer term technology
[1:36:01] technological term can I use those words
[1:36:04] they use AAA in technology
[1:36:08] Stay With Me
[1:36:10] and what Triple A in technology is it's
[1:36:13] um it's security uh for Authentication
[1:36:18] authorization and accounting amen AAA in
[1:36:22] technology it's in the security field
[1:36:24] amen AAA security is for authentication
[1:36:27] authorization and accounting
[1:36:30] how many of y'all have email in here
[1:36:33] hey everybody got an email address hey
[1:36:36] man you don't realize when you are using
[1:36:39] email hey man you're using this type of
[1:36:41] security
[1:36:42] hey man if you have any type of online
[1:36:44] portal that you're trying to get access
[1:36:46] to you have to go through this security
[1:36:48] model you have to go through
[1:36:49] authentication authorization and
[1:36:52] accounting
[1:36:54] oh Hallelujah somebody
[1:36:56] amen now authentication it involves a
[1:37:00] user providing as to who they are so
[1:37:04] oftentimes we need to know your username
[1:37:07] before we can log you in before we can
[1:37:10] give you access we need to know your
[1:37:12] username
[1:37:13] glory to God and everybody's username is
[1:37:17] is unique to them
[1:37:20] hey God wants to know what your username
[1:37:23] is
[1:37:24] father come in the name of Jesus
[1:37:30] starting to gain access now
[1:37:32] amen not only am I coming in the name of
[1:37:35] Jesus but God I'm thanking you for what
[1:37:37] you did for me you woke me up this
[1:37:39] morning
[1:37:41] amen you provided my needs on yesterday
[1:37:43] and I and I just believe like the like
[1:37:47] despair if you woke me up today you can
[1:37:49] provide a worm for me today too
[1:37:53] amen hey you never failed me yet God
[1:37:58] this is my authentication as I'm
[1:38:00] approaching God
[1:38:02] oh hallelujah it's your username and
[1:38:05] your password that's what allows you to
[1:38:07] get access to the different platforms
[1:38:10] all right hey man authorization actually
[1:38:13] follows Authentication
[1:38:16] so once we realize your password is
[1:38:18] Right amen your username is right then
[1:38:21] we authenticate you and we allow you we
[1:38:23] give you authorization to access
[1:38:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now you
[1:38:30] gotta understand something about I mean
[1:38:31] here it says authorization is different
[1:38:34] from authentication and that
[1:38:36] authentication only checks the user's
[1:38:38] identity whereas authorization dictates
[1:38:41] what the user is allowed to do
[1:38:45] so once I have been uh authorized
[1:38:48] hallelujah amen I've given my username
[1:38:51] I've given my password now I'm
[1:38:53] authorized to use the system amen as I
[1:38:55] have need of
[1:38:57] I'm authorized to approach heaven I'm
[1:38:59] authorized to approach God I'm
[1:39:01] authorized to get what I need from God
[1:39:04] I'm authorized to climb this ladder and
[1:39:07] make my request known to God I'm
[1:39:09] authorized to do it
[1:39:11] amen and Hallelujah if the devil did not
[1:39:14] want me he should not have given me
[1:39:16] access
[1:39:17] oh he should have he should have made me
[1:39:19] forget my password but but since I
[1:39:22] remembered my password and I remembered
[1:39:25] my username I'm authorized to ask God
[1:39:29] for anything
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:31] if you say to the mountain be thou
[1:39:34] removed and don't doubt in your heart
[1:39:36] you can have what you say you have been
[1:39:39] authorized
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:46] Hallelujah
[1:39:51] foreign
[1:39:52] tication
[1:39:54] has gone forth my username and password
[1:39:57] my authorization gives me access to all
[1:40:00] of Heaven
[1:40:01] but now it's accounting
[1:40:04] and what accounting does Amen accounting
[1:40:07] tracks where you go
[1:40:10] after you receive access to the system
[1:40:14] where you going
[1:40:16] and now that you don't come into the
[1:40:18] presence of God
[1:40:19] where you going church
[1:40:22] Hallelujah
[1:40:23] glory to God make sure as you're going
[1:40:25] before God that you amen you don't have
[1:40:28] nothing in your heart against nobody
[1:40:29] because that'll block your prayer
[1:40:32] that'll block the answer to prayer make
[1:40:34] sure your heart is clear now you can
[1:40:35] just ask whatever you want before God
[1:40:38] you're authorized to do that
[1:40:45] I was just looking at this and
[1:40:47] amen and thanking God uh uh you know
[1:40:50] just for for this the security amount of
[1:40:52] authentication authorization accounting
[1:40:54] amen but as I was looking at amen um AAA
[1:40:58] roadside assistance because again people
[1:41:00] use prayer just as a a tool to get when
[1:41:04] they broke down now I want to get God
[1:41:06] involved my health is broke down I want
[1:41:08] to get God involved amen this happened
[1:41:10] in my family I want to get you know
[1:41:12] sometimes prayer can be a preventative
[1:41:14] mention
[1:41:15] yeah
[1:41:18] prayer can be used as a preventative
[1:41:20] measure before something happens to your
[1:41:24] family
[1:41:26] that's what happened with Joe before his
[1:41:29] children were lost job had already
[1:41:31] offered prayer on their behalf
[1:41:36] Hallelujah
[1:41:38] prayer
[1:41:39] how we communicate with our God I was
[1:41:41] looking at this so what are the benefits
[1:41:42] of AAA at roadside assistance and I
[1:41:44] found amen their their benefits is it is
[1:41:46] roadside assistance
[1:41:48] amen uh they also got identity theft
[1:41:51] monitoring so nobody can steal your
[1:41:53] identity hey man uh if you get locked
[1:41:56] out of your car
[1:41:57] amen AAA can be called to come and pop
[1:42:00] your locks
[1:42:02] but I'ma tell you another thing I see I
[1:42:04] remember brother wisdom I believe
[1:42:05] brother wisdom that shared it with me
[1:42:07] one time uh he was in a situation no it
[1:42:10] wasn't oh two situations one with
[1:42:12] brother wisdom one was brother Wesco a
[1:42:14] man one with brother wisdom uh he was in
[1:42:16] a situation where he was driving and I
[1:42:19] guess got so caught up in and realized
[1:42:21] that uh uh my goodness I'm about to run
[1:42:25] out of gas out here on this highway he
[1:42:27] says I I I didn't want to walk wherever
[1:42:30] I was so so I just began to pray that
[1:42:32] God would just put enough gas in the car
[1:42:34] to get me to a gas station
[1:42:37] see you don't need to call roadside
[1:42:39] assistance he has something greater than
[1:42:41] roadside assistance I'ma use my prayer
[1:42:43] amen and God just put enough gas in here
[1:42:46] so I can get to the gas station
[1:42:48] I heard somebody else say that amen they
[1:42:50] didn't have no gas and I guess didn't
[1:42:52] even have money to get gas they took
[1:42:54] water
[1:42:55] put it in the gas tank and the car kept
[1:42:58] going
[1:42:59] now some of y'all say hey I ain't gonna
[1:43:01] do that but you know what there's a guy
[1:43:03] that's already proven that his car could
[1:43:05] run by water
[1:43:07] that's true
[1:43:09] it's wherever their faith is at brother
[1:43:11] time where brother Wesco one time was he
[1:43:13] in the snow in New York glory to God and
[1:43:17] he realized he'd unlocked his keys in
[1:43:19] the car his family called heco God how
[1:43:22] am I gonna amen get into this car I
[1:43:25] ain't got no way to get it he said a
[1:43:27] word of prayer and it said after he
[1:43:29] prayed he saw the locks just popped
[1:43:33] why did the locks pop he activated
[1:43:37] Angelic assistance come on somebody amen
[1:43:42] he activated Angelic assistance when he
[1:43:45] played
[1:43:47] and prayer can do anything
[1:43:49] when you find yourself in any situation
[1:43:53] prayer can do anything
[1:44:04] oh Jesus
[1:44:07] see
[1:44:09] roadside assistance is usually contacted
[1:44:11] when there's an emergency
[1:44:14] let's see for the believer
[1:44:16] amen when we're activating Angelic
[1:44:18] assistance
[1:44:20] log in
[1:44:22] and uh once they've logged in and
[1:44:24] checked their credentials as a believer
[1:44:27] your credentials need to be checked as a
[1:44:30] believer amen as a Believer you're
[1:44:32] authorized to speak to your mountains
[1:44:35] amen and this is better than roadside
[1:44:37] assistance
[1:44:38] because uh you can call them when you're
[1:44:41] in trouble but I noticed something with
[1:44:43] roadside assistance that you can call
[1:44:45] and when you're in trouble but sometimes
[1:44:47] they still don't know how to get to you
[1:44:51] and you're out here in the middle of
[1:44:52] nowhere and they ask you for a crossroad
[1:44:54] all right if you have I'm I'm logged it
[1:44:57] on with the app and this app has my GPS
[1:45:00] coordinates put those GPS coordinates in
[1:45:03] your computer and come see about me
[1:45:08] come on right but but don't don't don't
[1:45:10] don't be talking I can't find and I
[1:45:12] can't look when we're going to heaven it
[1:45:14] ain't never none of that
[1:45:15] it ain't no I can't get to it no no no
[1:45:18] no no amen maybe the Prince of Persia
[1:45:20] might be trying to stop a blessing from
[1:45:22] coming your way but there's a blessing
[1:45:24] on the way
[1:45:28] I love this I love this see we don't we
[1:45:31] don't have no relationship with God
[1:45:32] where we just depend on a man a roadside
[1:45:35] assistance when we need it this is this
[1:45:37] is 24 7 coverage
[1:45:40] Psalms 34 7 says Angel Lord
[1:45:43] cometh round about them that fear Him
[1:45:46] and delivereth them and I just love the
[1:45:49] way brother Brandon makes a statement
[1:45:50] about that he says there uh he says
[1:45:52] people are not conscious of God says
[1:45:54] they're not conscious of God they don't
[1:45:55] remember what the Bible says that the
[1:45:57] angels of God are encamped about those
[1:45:59] who fear Him they don't only just come
[1:46:01] and visit them
[1:46:03] he said the Angels just don't come and
[1:46:04] visit says they stick their tents down
[1:46:11] do you realize wherever you go Angels
[1:46:14] already already at your disposal
[1:46:18] angels are a position around you
[1:46:23] they put their tents down that's
[1:46:26] residents
[1:46:29] the angels of God say they stick their
[1:46:31] tents down amen the angels of God are
[1:46:34] encamped about those who fear Him stay
[1:46:36] there day and night
[1:46:39] and on the time the only thing I need to
[1:46:41] activate my Angelic assistance
[1:46:43] prayer
[1:46:49] let's go and catch uh this third slide
[1:46:52] here from
[1:46:55] Spurgeon
[1:46:57] let me give you a little bit more
[1:47:01] it makes this common it says
[1:47:04] nothing
[1:47:06] bring such leanness into a man's Soul as
[1:47:09] a lack of Prayer
[1:47:12] nothing brings such leanness into a
[1:47:14] man's Soul as a lack of Prayer
[1:47:18] here's another one prayer
[1:47:20] is doubts Destroyer
[1:47:26] so if you're if you ever doubt in this
[1:47:27] and you're doubting that the best thing
[1:47:29] to do is go into prayer prayer is doubts
[1:47:31] Destroyer
[1:47:34] I love this word ruins remedy
[1:47:39] prayers ruins remedy
[1:47:42] prayer is the antidote to all anxieties
[1:47:49] here's another one all good is born in
[1:47:51] prayer
[1:47:52] and all good Springs from it
[1:47:59] another one continue in prayer
[1:48:01] and though the blessing Tarry
[1:48:04] it must come
[1:48:08] in God's Own time it must appear to you
[1:48:12] effectual firm prayer won't take no for
[1:48:15] an answer
[1:48:16] though it Terry it must come
[1:48:22] here's another one whether we like it or
[1:48:25] not asking is the rule of the Kingdom
[1:48:30] y'all got that one
[1:48:31] I told you sometimes I want my kids just
[1:48:34] to ask for it
[1:48:36] yeah God already know what you need but
[1:48:38] he still wants you to ask
[1:48:39] asking is the rule of the Kingdom
[1:48:46] here's another one anything is a
[1:48:48] blessing
[1:48:49] which makes us free
[1:48:58] if it cause you to pray
[1:49:04] oh Pastor you don't know this happened
[1:49:06] and that happened did you pray about it
[1:49:09] because it if it caused you to pray
[1:49:12] it was a blessing
[1:49:16] ain't got another one I would rather
[1:49:18] teach one man to pray
[1:49:21] then 10 men to preach
[1:49:32] I would rather teach one man to pray
[1:49:34] than 10 men to preach
[1:49:37] here's another one but if one neglects
[1:49:40] his closet then all evil comes of it
[1:49:43] another repeat but we need it
[1:49:45] says I believe that God hears your
[1:49:47] prayers because there's a secret work of
[1:49:50] the spirit going on within you teaching
[1:49:53] you to pray
[1:49:58] true prayers and approach of the Soul by
[1:50:00] the spirit of God to the throne of God
[1:50:03] and here's here's another one here
[1:50:06] pray until you can pray
[1:50:11] pray to be helped to pray
[1:50:15] and do not give up praying because you
[1:50:18] cannot pray
[1:50:22] because you know people say that I I'm
[1:50:24] not a prayer Warrior we all our prayer
[1:50:26] warriors
[1:50:28] all of us are
[1:50:30] and it's not how much you say don't get
[1:50:33] that don't think you got to say more
[1:50:35] than the next person it's just being
[1:50:38] sincere
[1:50:40] and you ain't look sometimes we pray
[1:50:43] expecting the people that's hearing us
[1:50:45] to be the answer to our prayer
[1:50:47] I'm not talking to you
[1:50:51] I'm talking to God
[1:50:53] and if somebody gonna criticize you for
[1:50:55] the high you pray just tell them I want
[1:50:57] talking to you
[1:50:59] foreign
[1:51:01] I wasn't even expecting you to even
[1:51:03] grant me no request
[1:51:06] I'm glad you heard it but I weren't
[1:51:08] talking to you
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:11] Hallelujah
[1:51:13] glory to God pray until you can pray
[1:51:16] pray to be helped to pray and do not
[1:51:19] give up praying because you cannot pray
[1:51:24] ER here it is for it is when you think
[1:51:27] you cannot pray
[1:51:29] that is when you are praying
[1:51:38] when you think you cannot pray that's
[1:51:42] when God is listening now you find an
[1:51:44] internet to the channel
[1:51:48] y'all know what brother Brandon did on
[1:51:50] this first time praying he said he know
[1:51:52] what he was doing
[1:51:53] he said just took a little note
[1:51:55] and he wrote something down on a sheet
[1:51:57] of paper and he stuck it on a tree
[1:52:00] now just think about that I'm just going
[1:52:03] to take this note and I'm gonna put it
[1:52:04] on the tree I don't even know if God is
[1:52:06] out here or not I don't even know if God
[1:52:08] see my note I don't know nothing
[1:52:10] but they put it on the tree just in set
[1:52:12] sincerity and then in some kind of way
[1:52:14] just act out now if that was you would
[1:52:16] you come by and do this would you let
[1:52:18] the wind do that and God did it every
[1:52:19] time showing them that I'm here with you
[1:52:21] I can see what you wrote I can hear what
[1:52:24] you saying I can even hear what you
[1:52:25] thinking
[1:52:28] look I promise never to leave you nor
[1:52:29] forsake you now don't let it I got
[1:52:31] angels that are encamped around you in
[1:52:34] the woods then camped around you in your
[1:52:36] home the encountered in your car in
[1:52:38] school wherever you go angels are there
[1:52:40] and when you begin to pray you activate
[1:52:43] Angelic assistance
[1:52:49] brother I tell you what this ain't like
[1:52:51] a cell phone that sometimes you got
[1:52:52] connections sometimes you know
[1:52:55] and you're just struggling actually I
[1:52:57] got an important call to make it I can't
[1:52:59] get no signal
[1:53:00] not with not with prayer always got to
[1:53:03] sing
[1:53:05] father in the name of Jesus
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:08] what a tool we have in our hands
[1:53:14] let me uh
[1:53:20] let me give you
[1:53:24] another quote here
[1:53:26] oh my my my my my
[1:53:31] well let me see I I got another quote
[1:53:34] that I want to be but it's gonna take us
[1:53:36] until something here I I I'm gonna have
[1:53:39] to say
[1:53:47] I got a whole bunch of them over here I
[1:53:50] got a whole bunch I'm just trying to
[1:53:52] figure out where to where to get out
[1:53:53] here uh I I say we need to quote I I get
[1:53:59] quote they're not finished off with just
[1:54:00] a small statements here from
[1:54:02] um
[1:54:03] Spurgeon Jairus
[1:54:06] a secret believer
[1:54:11] oh my
[1:54:14] driver's a secret believe look at this
[1:54:16] what the problem says
[1:54:18] get on out his little Hut
[1:54:21] oh Hezekiah turned over began to talk to
[1:54:24] the Lord
[1:54:24] said Lord I beseech thee to consider me
[1:54:27] but I walk before you with the perfect
[1:54:29] heart
[1:54:31] that's a great big word it isn't
[1:54:32] testimony like that I ha I have walked
[1:54:35] with a perfect heart and he needed 15
[1:54:37] years more now the King was the highest
[1:54:40] figure Earthly speaking or politically
[1:54:42] speaking in the whole nation of Israel
[1:54:45] and the greatest man politically
[1:54:47] politically speaking was was talking to
[1:54:50] the King of Kings now
[1:54:52] um
[1:54:53] now it looks like the King of Kings
[1:54:56] would have had it would have had
[1:54:58] anything to say back to the king he
[1:55:00] would have spoke to him
[1:55:02] but it should prove that he was talking
[1:55:04] to him but God has ways and means of
[1:55:08] doing things his own way and instead of
[1:55:10] that he goes back out to the prophet and
[1:55:13] he says to the prophet now you go tell
[1:55:15] him I heard his prayer and I'm going to
[1:55:17] spare him 15 years now I don't read the
[1:55:21] scripture but he was talking about
[1:55:22] Hezekiah the prophet Isaiah come in and
[1:55:25] announce man you get your house in order
[1:55:27] you're gonna die
[1:55:28] and as he told Hezekiah it is Hezekiah
[1:55:31] just turned his face to the wall and it
[1:55:33] began to break
[1:55:34] and when he prayed God immediately heard
[1:55:38] Hezekiah and he gave an answer to the
[1:55:41] prophet as he was walking out of the
[1:55:43] Courts of the king God spoke just that
[1:55:46] fast back to the prophet Isaiah said now
[1:55:48] go back and tell him I heard his prayer
[1:55:51] and he gonna live again he gonna live 15
[1:55:53] more years it don't take God long to
[1:55:55] answer a prayer if you're doing it the
[1:55:57] right way now when you read the story of
[1:56:00] Hezekiah maybe you should have went
[1:56:01] ahead and died right then
[1:56:03] because he got them 50 more years and he
[1:56:05] didn't live right before God it probably
[1:56:08] would have been best for him to just die
[1:56:09] right then
[1:56:10] amen Hallelujah God Knows Best right but
[1:56:15] so so here he says the prophet said it
[1:56:17] said to make sense that here he is the
[1:56:19] king and the highest uh political place
[1:56:20] and here he's talking to the King of
[1:56:22] Kings his God but God does not speak
[1:56:25] directly to amen Hezekiah he speaks
[1:56:28] through a prophet back to Hezekiah
[1:56:31] Hallelujah
[1:56:34] he says could you imagine the position
[1:56:37] that put Isaiah in here he comes right
[1:56:40] back through the gate again thus saith
[1:56:43] the Lord he's going to live right up to
[1:56:46] the soldiers thus said the Lord is going
[1:56:48] to live right into the celebrities thus
[1:56:50] said the Lord is going to live without
[1:56:52] imagining to say what kind of prophet is
[1:56:54] that
[1:56:55] what was the big difference
[1:56:58] prayer
[1:57:00] change from Death To Life amen it'll do
[1:57:03] it for every sinner here tonight amen
[1:57:05] from Death To Life it'll do it for every
[1:57:07] stick person tonight from sickness to
[1:57:09] health Prayer Changes Things So always
[1:57:14] bear that in mind pray without ceasing
[1:57:17] if you want to be an impediment to the
[1:57:19] meeting
[1:57:21] just don't pray
[1:57:23] I like what the prophet just said
[1:57:26] if you want to be an impediment
[1:57:28] oh my God if you want to be something
[1:57:31] that hurt
[1:57:33] the meeting
[1:57:34] if you want to be something that hurt
[1:57:36] the church if you want to be something
[1:57:38] that hurts your family
[1:57:41] don't pray
[1:57:45] don't pray it says just don't pray if
[1:57:48] you want to be the greatest help this
[1:57:49] meeting can this meeting can have it's
[1:57:52] not financially
[1:57:56] here is the greatest help you can be to
[1:57:59] this meeting set aside an hour or two
[1:58:01] every day that you pray for the meeting
[1:58:04] go out and visit someone if the Lord
[1:58:06] puts it on your heart and bring them
[1:58:08] into the meeting then pray that God will
[1:58:11] save them when they're in there if
[1:58:14] they're not safe
[1:58:15] heal them if they're sick and in need of
[1:58:18] healing pray for them say that's the
[1:58:20] greatest contribution that you can give
[1:58:22] to any meeting is to pray and seek God
[1:58:26] to help in this time of trouble
[1:58:30] greater than your finances
[1:58:34] we meet
[1:58:36] your prayers
[1:58:43] if I didn't have to give towards
[1:58:45] something I would just be praying God
[1:58:47] meet the need
[1:58:50] and then my prayer would just keep
[1:58:51] Rising God used me
[1:58:55] to meet the need
[1:58:58] God sent something my way so I can be a
[1:59:01] blessing
[1:59:04] I was just telling somebody I'm I'm out
[1:59:06] of time here I'm out of time uh I was
[1:59:08] just telling you know uh when when you
[1:59:11] look at Miracles there's
[1:59:13] two different groups involved in America
[1:59:16] I'm going back to the last thing on
[1:59:18] Spurgeon here just uh give me that last
[1:59:20] one there's two different groups
[1:59:21] involved in the miracle
[1:59:23] there is
[1:59:25] the group that stands by and watches the
[1:59:28] miracle happen
[1:59:32] and then there's another group or
[1:59:34] individual that actually is a partaker
[1:59:37] of the miracle
[1:59:40] and which group do you want to be
[1:59:42] because I'm gonna tell you nobody writes
[1:59:44] about the people that stood by and watch
[1:59:47] but we don't we only tell the stories of
[1:59:50] those that were the partakers
[1:59:52] I want to be a partaker in America I
[1:59:54] might not have it right now God but if I
[1:59:56] I might not be able to give finances I
[1:59:58] can sure give my prayer
[2:00:01] because Prayer Changes Things let me
[2:00:03] finish it with uh uh uh spurgeons these
[2:00:06] uh these last uh things from Spurgeon
[2:00:08] prayer is a creature's strength it's
[2:00:12] very breath
[2:00:13] and being
[2:00:18] prayer is not a hard requirement
[2:00:21] it is the natural duty of a creature to
[2:00:23] its creator the simplest homage that
[2:00:26] human need can pay to Divine liberality
[2:00:31] prayer is the Slender nerve look at this
[2:00:34] one the Slender nerve that moves
[2:00:38] of omnipotence
[2:00:41] prayer is the Slender nerve that moves
[2:00:45] the muscle up omnipotence
[2:00:48] the man who has his mouth full of
[2:00:51] arguments in prayer shall soon have his
[2:00:54] mouth full of benediction and answer to
[2:00:57] prayer
[2:01:00] the man who despite the teaching of
[2:01:02] scripture tries to pray without a savior
[2:01:05] insults the deity
[2:01:08] so you got to have the right
[2:01:09] Authentication
[2:01:11] you got to have the right credentials
[2:01:14] the ship of prayer may sail through all
[2:01:16] Temptations
[2:01:17] doubts and fears straight up to the
[2:01:20] throne of God
[2:01:24] I like this one prayer and praise
[2:01:29] are the oars by which a man May roll his
[2:01:33] boat into the deep Waters of the
[2:01:35] knowledge of Christ
[2:01:40] I know of no better thermometer
[2:01:43] to your spiritual temperature than this
[2:01:47] the measure of the intensity
[2:01:51] of your prayer
[2:01:53] effectual
[2:01:55] fervent prayer
[2:01:58] of a righteous man a woman
[2:02:00] a veileth much
[2:02:04] the Lord bless you
[2:02:14] that's great
[2:02:23] Lord how our spirits
[2:02:28] have been ministered to the depths of
[2:02:30] our soul
[2:02:33] we realize the power of this great
[2:02:35] weapon that took place in our hands the
[2:02:38] weapon of Prayer
[2:02:42] it's the tool that we use to communicate
[2:02:45] with them
[2:02:47] sometimes Lord Satan does all he can to
[2:02:51] get us to uh
[2:02:54] to not see the importance of the tool
[2:02:56] that we have
[2:02:58] but I thank you that you would take time
[2:03:00] to remind us of God that we could come
[2:03:02] to you uh in prayer asking anything
[2:03:07] we could speak to mountains and they
[2:03:09] would be casting to the Sea and not down
[2:03:11] the heart we can have what we say
[2:03:14] father I I trust the Lord that if
[2:03:17] there's anyone here that that's not in
[2:03:19] good standing with you they're not
[2:03:21] Christians
[2:03:22] Lord that they would come to a place of
[2:03:24] true repentance
[2:03:26] realizing on God that this is what gives
[2:03:28] them an access when they repent and they
[2:03:30] become uh Believers in you father and
[2:03:33] the sacrifice that you did at Calvary
[2:03:35] Lord this is what puts us back in
[2:03:37] connection with you we lost that
[2:03:39] connection in the Garden of Eden but it
[2:03:40] puts us back in connection with you once
[2:03:43] we repented now we have access to all of
[2:03:46] Heaven
[2:03:47] Lord let the Believers
[2:03:49] let the Believers realize Lord the this
[2:03:53] this this this great weapon greater than
[2:03:56] any atomic bomb on the Earth today
[2:03:59] this weapon of prayer is the thing that
[2:04:02] changes thing if prayer could change the
[2:04:05] mind of God and hezekiah's situation
[2:04:08] prayer can change anything
[2:04:13] let us realize what we have oh God
[2:04:18] I trust Lord that you would help us Lord
[2:04:21] to amen activate this Angelic assistance

[2:04:25] the people have Lord marriages need you
[2:04:28] homes need you job people need jobs

[2:04:37] activate Angelic assistance
[2:04:40] is through prayer we come knowing god
[2:04:43] that you've already granted the request
[2:04:46] we realize Satan will do all he can to
[2:04:48] try to block it
[2:04:49] but we're not taking no for an answer
[2:04:51] especially when we know it's in the will
[2:04:52] of God
[2:04:53] and it's in the word of God
