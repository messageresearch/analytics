[Music] [Applause] god bless you baby seal amen we greet you church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's been a while since you've been here so with a pleasure to be here with you I love you every time I'm here I feel at home and I thank you for that because it's the way you receive me amen that allows me to feel at home the Lord bless you for that man I know that your pastor is not here called me to be here with you and a man has to trust another man you know to know that when he's going away he can trust and trust you as someone else to be with his church because I mean you guys need to understand this is not a joke I'm saying you are not a joke okay because you are the precious blood of Jesus Christ what about I'm saying you are more precious than that blood so you were given into brother Jack's he needs to to watch over so he needs to know who he can trust who gets them behind this Bobby because what's being said here is life and death you know and I think God that you know he trusts me enough to be here while he's not here you know I mean it's a blessing it's an honor that I don't take for granted what you guys to know that you know and that is why we're not here I preach to you my heart you know so I know sometimes I see you know words and [Music] forgive me me not for the word but you know it's not my will to hurt nobody but the word you know I just think that's wrong Amazing Grace you know that grace something that you did not deserve that didn't have to do it but yet he did it and there's a reason why he didn't and what you need to know my but you know to kind of bring that out in my message to be that the grace of God was actually for a specific group of people [Music] does that know who would receive that grace I know will not so I mean it's not like someone is gonna wake up to then oh my god okay now you know today I'm going to believe in God and I'm going to go to church I'm gonna change my life and then God is going to be like I did not know no nothing will surprise him I mean you and I son you know certain things we can do to it or oh my God thank you for the surprise I didn't know not to God you know there's nothing you can't surprise him he already know everything so His grace was designed for someone specifically you know because he didn't go die and then after that wait to see who's going to see and accept him just oh okay how he died for me oh I guess I should accept it no he died because you didn't knew you would accept it so he came made it happen so you can be where you are today that grace my brothers and sister hopefully I can help you see it through my message today because I believe last time I was here I started talking about them with the value of the weaker vessel and we're gonna continue on that same subject because it's really important today in the day that we live in people are leaving the message left and right for one reason because they don't believe it or they don't understand it the main reason is that they don't understand the message and in the pyramid days knowledge so knowledge is part of the message it means you must understand what you believe when God called you at first he didn't ask you to understand them to believe he asked you to believe then you will understand so so you will never be left without you no understanding it's part of it just it's in my heart it's wrong for you to be here and not knowing why well I'm I love God I'm here I don't need to understand that's not sure that's a lie of the devil it's not sure you have to understand because you know why there is light the light was given for a purpose to see were you going so God is the light God is understanding so you just you need to understand the message why are you here because otherwise you should should leave just like everybody else you know so we here today hopefully we can bring out no understanding about the message to help you in your walk amen I bless the newly bright a man we got bless her can say Shalom anymore amen sister maybe bless your marriage god bless you I can't see I wish I could [Laughter] Amazing Grace yes thank you I mean can make a joyful noise but I can't see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen bless you so we are with the world we're going to read in first Peter chapter three one verse verse 7 thank you my sisters first Peter 3 verse 7 it's a husband's likewise dwell with them which is your wife with understanding giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel and as being they being hares together or the grace of life that your prayers may not be hindered man may God add blessing to his words you may be seated amen the value of the weaker vessel we started last time fully we can get a little bit deeper in this end again the reason why I got for this in my heart it's because of things that have seen that's going on around the message grown young people adult you know leaving left and right and then after that the way they talk about the message and you can understand it's a lack of understanding but truly the will seed will not depart if you are called by God we all know that but what I'm preaching saying you know and it doesn't ask us to understand when he's called you first called you he doesn't ask you to understand but he never said you will never understand you will remain without understanding he never said that he also said come as you are he never said you will stay the way you are okay so come as you are yes because if you can help yourself you don't need God you know you don't if you can't change yourself what's the use you know we don't need them but he wants you to come just the way you are so you know that he is able to change you and that is why sometimes you know I talk to people and they let you know I I feel like I'm not ready to come to God because I got so much going on and I should leave this first I should stop doing this first and then I can come together I'm like then if you can you might as well stay where you are you know because when you come to God already fix what is going to be left for him to fix you know that is a mechanic is that the right word okay so he likes broken cars so don't feel bad because you're broken because God is feeling good because you're broken because he knows he can fix you you know so don't feel bad cuz he wants you broken so you know he can fix now let's say that I I have a mechanic you know and I have a car and my car is never broken down how will I know this guy is good when there's nothing wrong ever with my car to bring to him so he can prove to me he's worth you know and for me it's like I'm gonna be looking at like okay I don't know you know you don't have to stay around because I don't need you right now my car is working perfectly you know can I don't have any problem with my car but I'm going to know what it's capable of when my car breakdown on the highway and now I need I need someone to help me so it's the same thing for your life if your life is all good you only know God you need no one but the minute your life you broken like you know you're broken and you can't fix it yourself that's when you come to realize you know the how God is able to do things for you because why does it say in the Bible when you weaker like when you in your worse it's when you can't really do anything for yourself that's when you step in cause the mill you know as long as we know we can we know we can go there and knock and we can get whatever we need that is just gonna stand and wait for you until you can't anymore now I want you to know something you know the message like to fix book and things because the message is God okay so if you in the message and you feel broken don't run away from it but rather ask what's the worth of it to prove you know get the message prove to you it's worth you see you can Lord you send this message I'm broken please show me the worth of what you say God likes to be challenged so Challenger you know so again it's a lack of understanding that's why people are living the message left and right you know and it's heartbroken so now you have your sons and daughters you gave all to raise them right in the message that you know deep down in your heart that it's the truth and for them after they you know become of age and they feel like you know what mouth what you thought was right it's not right and then they think they know better and they get up and leave it's going to you know you're going to be heartbroken you know and you don't want that it's the same for a pastor trying to do all he can bring forth the words to the people and then suddenly have the church get up and say they don't believe you know everything you've been preaching for the last 20 years never done anything for them you know they get up and leave it's like nothing like okay so 10 years it's like you never really believed what was you know spoken here so it's a must for us to have an understanding of the message there's no way out of it can't serve God without understanding you can't you know so he set revelation so you can understand that is the purpose of Revelation okay cuz once it was hidden so revelation comes to do what to open it so you can see and understand that's the whole purpose of it I'm gonna read this quote for you because we're gonna kind of go through most of the codes so we can bring our what we would like to bring out by the grace of God now in this message called what here is down Elijah preach 1959 April 12 1959 Pagar 34 I'm gonna read this for you and you're going to understand something about the message and but when I was talking we friend to a man named John Sproul and he said John sprawl a friend of mine taking his wife and took a trip over to I'll say chlorine friends and the guide was taking them through a strand garden and he showed them a statue of the Lord Jesus Christ in the garden there was that statue so in the end brothers Paul said he was looking at that statue he said what did the sculpture sculptor have in his mind when he was making the statue so he was looking at it but he can figure out what was the man taking off when oh when he was doing that then why I don't see any suffering of Christ I don't see anything just looks like the statue what does that mean so it's looking at the statue and his asking question but it doesn't mean anything to him the way he was looking at it and the guide said to him mr. Ashbaugh you perhaps criticizing that statue said I am said I don't know what the sculpture had in his mind he said the thing of it is you have to know what this sculpture had in his mind before you can see what he was trying to do so we receive a message and most of us is asking okay what what is this what is this message but you have to know what was in God's mind to know what's the message about okay so you have to be in the sculptures mind he said now come down here the guide told mr. Stroud to come down because apparently he was somewhere up looking at the statue okay anyway down to the foot of the cross and there was a pod he said kneel down and said now look up so mr. sprong was looking at the statue while he was standing up while he was tearing up he could not see anything like any real thing that would make the statue like stand out so it was it looked like any ordinary life statue for him so the guide said the way you looking at it you can fully see what was in the sculptures mind so you have there's a way you have to look at it so steady enough is wrong so the guide is gonna tell him how to see the message behind the statue so he said to him come mr. Schwaab kneel down and look up so you can't stand up and look up thinking you can really see anything that's well in order for you to see the will something truly like we're the real thing the real meaning of God you get stood up and seeing you but you have to kneel down to see it so standing up looking at the stature he couldn't see anything but the guy said come down kneel down and said now look up and mr. Strauss said he thought in his rod would break because now he's kneeling there was every agony that Jesus went through on the cross all featured in the statue so standing up he couldn't see it but once he kneel down now he could see it looking at the message standing up you will not see not understand anything but when you go down on your knee when you go down on your knees and you look up there you will be able to see the reason of the message so you have to kneel down not standing up and talk at home para bellum said this and this is contrary to the Bible where do you get your coming to say that what he said is culture to the Bible like how did you get that idea where does it where did it come from on what ground you are base you know for your for what you saying because you can't just say something is wrong when you have no base for it no foundation for it so now if you choose the Bible to say what about I'm said was wrong and you say and it's the Bible you use it to say what is it was wrong so I just forgot to go back in the Bible again and read it over to see what he said was it culture to the Bible but still standing up you won't see it meaning we drive you can't see it so you can never reach God you know by standing up can never find him by standing up the only way to find God is to come down you know so as he's nailed down he said I saw every agony that Jesus went through on the cross all feature he said you see sir the statue was made to get down and look up not stand off and look over the message wasn't given to stand up and look over at but it was given to kneel down and look up so the first thing you need don't just get up and leave because of something that is said that doesn't fit well for you what you need to do is kneel down go down on your knee pray because praying is looking up see while you pray in your head is battle right but yet your prayer is going on so you nail him down and he said look that you look up so yawn when you nail him down it's in your prayer that you're looking up to God for him to come down and you know the graceful not you because you cannot again understand this message in your pride get away get out of yourself and say Lord well you know what again it's not the amount of prayer that gives you the revelation of this message anyway let me let me let let me bring this out thing it's not the how you pray it's not the like you 40 days of fasting Oh teddy however long you wanna do it that will bring you the revelation of the message because it's actually given to a chosen people because I'm gonna tell you this the bride never had to pray to receive the revelation of the message I mean you still have to pray I'm not saying go brain but the bride of Jesus Christ it's not because she prayed then God gave her the revelation no it was made for her praying or not what are you prey or not if you are the bride and will come to you and that's a no great but what I need you to understand is that but this revelation the message was brought and was sent to a specific group of people and those people got know them he know he knew who they are no matter where you are the message will find you and I'm gonna tell you this before we continue you cannot pray enough to bring your husband in the message you can never pray enough to bring your wife in the message you can never pray enough to bring your children in the message never your prayer is not what make God bring people in the message no no so therefore you cannot pray and ask God please Lord I want my children in the message because the message is for the bride so if your children are not part of the bride they can never be in the message because the message can save anyone true salvation is not just for the bride salvation is for everyone living on earth okay salvation is for everyone but the rapture is for a specific group of people the message is for a specific group of people the message did not come to save [Music] the message was never said to save people the message was sent to gather a bride so no matter what I would try to bring out if you're not part of the value in the beginning so if you stay it's that because you're better than those who live if you stay it's because that something is holding you here not in the church this building in the message because you can never go in the rupture outside of the message okay because if I'm trying to go to Haiti I cannot stay here and get on the airplane what do I have to do go where to the airport so therefore that is a place I must be for me to go to Haiti so to go to the rapture there's a place you must be and God prepare the place for you to be ah and that place is the message well whether they stay or leave so the message is none other than the God you are praying sir okay now and that message also is none other than you so the message was sent to people that were already a message themselves so it's just that this the message is like the bridegroom that was missing apart so he come out to look for his other half so this message is the God you are praying to which is the Lord Jesus Christ that same Lord Jesus Christ went out left his throne come down looking for his other half then his other half can never be anything else but the message so therefore to be in the message you have to be the message to stay in it I mean I'm trying to help you see something so I'm gonna go read some quotes for you because I don't want to go ahead over myself let me read let me read this for you didn't bring my phone because I want to try now watch the time thank you all right now but when I preached a message called the masterpiece which in 1964 that's like July 8th 1964 proud of 46 he said as he begin to work upon creeping things so that's when God was making you know the creation like open the little animals upon earth and then he began to bring it from that it's into something else higher then finally he brought it into a larger animals such as the lion tiger bear then he brought it into the life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so forth now not an evolution the way that creates because there is always a pattern like a trace from one species species to the other it looks like evolution so to the science mind it's evolution but its creation okay so what they call evolution is what that calls creation that is why the science said there's a missing leg okay so that missing link because that's why they say old men from apes you'll become what you are now that was the last time you seen it become a man I mean we've been saying man from ape so when was the last time science proved to you they observe because I'm gonna tell you why I'm saying this and you're gonna see we know how a butterfly is made right don't science show you how a butterfly become a butterfly dude what they do it from one caterpillar so therefore science has their microscope in a low wherever that thing is so they look at it like look at this alright alright now after 10 days brings a butterfly okay so therefore when I'm looking at a butterfly I can truly say that was once a caterpillar now you said I come from an ape you must show me show me prove it to me just like you prove the butterfly from account will prove to me and men for many but they can never do it but yet they keep on chained you from egg well today not me summer creation alright so if they can't show it to you they need to shut up oh what a wretched day go to school they have PhD in this I have g.od that's what I have a g.od God is what I have all right so right from the whip and the way it was gonna be like me no app is ever going to be like me okay no it was created in God's image so don't come for me and say hold from ape no no sir so just little tips whenever they save you from it and tell them that so it was not an evolution that was a complete creation God working in a pattern but finally then there came forth upon the earth of perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that men that look like him the men look like God because the men looked like God that's why the men was called a perfection okay that was the perfection so a perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that he it looked like him that men look like God and now when he looked up on him he was a reflection of what his create or was so what about what I need you to understand what the men looked like is what God look like whatever that the man however the man was it was perfectly the same way God was okay so he was a reflection of what his creator was so no matter how you look at Adam how you turn him that was you can say that's God because he looked like him act like him feels the same way God he'll pick the way God thinks so Adam and God was like a mirror image to each other now in Prague afford yet the same message he said and then I might say to this that when he made this man this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right remember God created a lot of perfect men but yet when God looked of it okay so that man he said something is still not right wait I need you to get this because we're gonna get somewhere he made a perfect man but yet after that when he looked over to the man he's like still something here right so remember the men and God is the same okay so therefore if God could look over to him and said still something and right so therefore when God looked at himself you can say the same thing okay cuz I want you to understand that because these things are not just said to be said because that's reason behind these see this what I'm saying if you know the message you've got to understand it so when God looked over to Adam and it's like something there right so it tells me when he look up himself he feels the same way all right so because and and he said and yet that didn't look just right because he was by himself so he created a perfect man but because that man was alone something was missing now so if that can look at the men in his life but he look lonely so it tells me God once was lonely so he displayed in Adam not he felt because Adam was the mirror image of God so whatever God felt I don't feel okay alright so because he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was eternal and the men now in the image of that also existed on earth by himself so he must have what shrunk a little blow over on his left side I mean you see what this thing is going to write struck a low-blower on his left side and from there he took the piece that struck off of it and a medium or helped make or what a wife so what I need you to understand my room just read god looked at Adam he saw Adam was running and Adam surely felt lonely because the Bible say when that brought all the animals before Adam he looked at them they came in pair before Adam so Adam saw each and every one was male and female after he done name all of the animals over in the garden so now he looked at himself Adam okay Adam looked at himself and it's like there was nothing like me right he said that in the Bible now Adam said he'd find nothing like him it's the same thing that happened with God that created the heavens could the stars the moon and then then planets in all these things then come and create angels out of all the things God created and he sat back one day looked at himself and still feel lonely because when God looked over all the creation there was nothing like him he felt lonely so that looked at the angels and just beautiful things right that's what we say beautiful but I said that over my home church once you know you more beautiful than an angel did you know that no angel can compare to you see you can say Amen cause for you in your head angel is oh pretty butter Reggie I mean have you seen an angel I mean oh you've seen what they show you want TV you'd never seen no angel you've seen what an image a man gave you but I want to tell you even if you seen it the word angel I want you to know this no angels no angels is as pretty as you are why no angels was created in that image so therefore is there more prettier than you then I guess God is you know okay now i'ma tell you this my young sisters when a young boy I come to you not saying don't you know be fresh young brothers you know when you're trying to talk to us this very few of the agent you can do it I window when they don't man come chanting girl you like a ninja girl you know you look like an angel from heaven I need you to understand something hmm nice words you know pick-up line and everything beautiful pickup line girl how was it heaven when you left it so therefore they refer and see you like you an angel because who's up there angels alright so how is that when you left it i'ma tell you this this person don't let no young man call you a demon anymore because I'm gonna tell you this you didn't know this gods and Joel are still in heaven the angels are on earth are demons you know angel oh oh you didn't know now you do see you laughing but it's the truth and Jose if a man say I was heavy when you left it what do you mean am I going back on my stay here which because if you stayin we got a problem here that's that's what you call a fallen angel who can't go back up so you and your fallen angel you took cute you took breathing alright so let them know I didn't listen my bad I mean I know you know you trying to you know go with this beautiful pickup line but I'm a creation of God made in His image so I'm prettier than an angel one - I know fun an angel okay so god bless you I mean my brothers I mean if you want another pick-up line you gonna have to look for another one alright so love you please don't hit me alright so an angel was never made in God's image so an angel may look perfect to you but to cut the perfection is you okay and angels to your eyes is something perfect but to God the perfection is you nothing else there is not ensure that God ever color masterpiece what is a masterpiece is something that the sculpture can never make higher or better than an angel will never be able to be better than you so anything God Himself can never ever make or create anything better than you so because given God Himself can never create anything better than you then tell me who's above you okay so nothing nothing angels fear God never bothered they feel God okay let them go but you feel that got up is that nada they bother him when you feel he trouble it you trouble God since you fell that never rested and just fell before you God went on eating partying having fun how did they do it up there we're gonna find out when we go oh we go find out brother yes so whatever they do up there we go find out as a matter of fact we're going to be the party let's leave this alone so he never bothered but when you fear Oh heaven God left his throne for you never did it find you so the love of God is not for an angel but it's for you so you're looking at angels how we gods and God is looking at you do you even know who you are so change your mind about angel now okay so dad felt lonely just like Adam Adam for God to take away his loneliness what did God do put him to sleep take a bride out of him right all right we get in somewhere let me read this for you now okay you're gonna get there in the message called Corinthians book of Correction preaching March 14 57 actually April April 1457 bagua 49 I feel can find it so we can read it here for you now he said in Quentin's book of Correction zero for 1457 tiger 49 now god when he made men he made him a dual person both male and female the men we're talking about here was not flesh that's Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 27 the creation of men is different from the making up from the from the making of men so in Genesis chapter 1 that create men in chapter 2 he made men so God created men a to a person male and female that's why I said let them in Genesis chapter 1 he created he them so that men in spirit was - please understand the men is the mirror image of who God if the man is spirit in spirit was - then it tells me God in spirit was - now my own sisters there's no way I'm bringing trying to bring this up just like that it's because I'm gonna say this when you hear in the message but I'm going to preach the hardest on women the reason is that women you my sisters are the mirror image of what God had in his mind for him when he was creating everything you see so God just like Adam Adam was a dual person then so was God because my Bible said he made men in his likeness so whatever that was the Adam was the man was okay so Adam was lonely when in his spirit he was - there was no one like him what did that God have to do he had to put him to see okay now he said here he separate him in flesh same message and put him here on earth and the female part was still in spirit look friends that was so careful don't let this leave you god never now listen close got a head full of dust and made an Eva why had it taken a handful of dust separate from the creation from Adam had he took another so it would have to speak out a female spirit by itself because brother Branham says in the message women are not in the original creation okay why because in Adam was the reflection of God God doesn't have a separate did not have a separate spirit of being next to him so when he made man he couldn't admit what he looked like one but yet in that one God there was you the bride so in Adam was his bride okay so since that was one there was no - there was no female spirit next to God o female being next to God none of that so when it's Adam into existence because that's the original creation the spoken word is the original creation so when he said you are not in the original creation it means you are not spoken out like he spoke on the tree like his for the animals out that he spoke the man out he did not speak you out but there's a reason so when it struck Adam into existence though he did not spit the woman out into existence but yet in Adam was her so because of that when he made Adam out of the dust appear to make it if he could not also reach down separate from Adam from the man to take another handful of the stomach Eve because it was never a separate game so he had to reach inside Adam first take part of that sim dust okay me Eve then reach back in Adam part of his spirit now God never got a handful of dust a minute Eve she did a different creation she's not a creation she's a by-product da da made a lot of sisters or women in the message mother who black father don't call me a byproduct I can do what every man can do well it's not a byproduct then let's go back to God let's ask him something was there a female being next to you because my Bible said you may have men in your image never said he made female remember men the world what we call men is not what we call Adam men became Adam Adam come from the earth thus okay so man was the creation so he never said a man spoke a man and spoke a woman never did so for him to do it he would have to have that image up there you gotta understand that to have to create that he would have to have an image so therefore you would have to reflect something since there was nothing to reflect you so he could only make you out of something else why because there was something in God that you wanted to take out okay so it's not an insult when the prophets say you are by product it's actually grace upon grace it's actually the best see I'm gonna tell you why it's actually the best thing turn again yeah I'm gonna get a little bit of man ahead of myself why because if Eve was created separately from Adam you could never be the same like Jesus you could never be the same again like Jesus you could never said to be like Jesus no because to be like Jesus means everything that was in Jesus everything that Jesus was you have to be but yet if you something separate you can't be it you can't so and you could never said you going back to God cuz you never came out of him so Eve could go back to Adam cause she came out of him so in order for her to say I'm going back to God then you would have to come out of him but if you were a separate creation how would you go back to someplace you were never you know so that's what it means going back to that means where you came from so meaning you came from God just like Eve came from Adam you came from God therefore you can't go back to him that's what it means and what about I'm saying they of perfect oneness perfect oneness can never be a separate thing from each other he came now now for when I'm said in drove a gyro 1961 March 12 1961 0-3 1261 it said in spirit he was both feminine feminine and masculine in spirit so to make them one to show that he did he open up the side of Adam and took part of Adam's flesh so that they wouldn't be separate they would be one and two part of Adam spirit Moses wrote in the Bible flesh of my flesh bone of my bone right where in the Bible Moses ever said speed of my sphere no way but yet it took a prophet to go further than Moses so what about I'm had to reach further then Moses did Moses wasn't there when God was creating Adam right but yet he told you how they were created so if you can believe Moses word when he wasn't there tell me what button wasn't there how would you know I won't tell you I would believe what would you believe Moses please like a magic he was a man shot at mother Burnham so therefore something had to come to Moses and give him the things he brought so the same thing I've come to buy the mother may give him the things he said okay so but what I'm saying now Eve was Adams flesh bone and he's spirit so because of that Eve now listen by-product is not whenever I'm referring to you as a by-product is not referring to you in spirit did you understand because it's in the message but what I'm saying the byproduct is not the spirit the byproduct is the flesh it is so why the byproduct is not the Spirit because the spirit was a spoken word because the spin was a spoken word since you were in Adam so your spirit is not a byproduct it's the very same spirit that was poking out of God's mouth that was in Adam that made you are you here with me now there's a reason why I'm saying this so the flesh is the byproduct the bride is the same the bride is the same now let me read something for you reason why I'm reading these because before I say when I wanted to see let me read these marriage and divorce but when I'm seeing first Adam sorry so it's 0 2 21 1965 Mergent was dragged off two nights in recent now the first Adam and Eve type ii Adam and Eve so whatever that happen in the first Adam must happen in the second Adam right okay remember the first Adam at first was lonely so therefore the second Adam was lonely the first Adam was put to sleep to take the Eve out of him so the second Adam must people to see to take the second in out of him okay the first Adam was not created a spirit Mel and then a separate spirit female so it was one spirit that one spirit had a door person in it male and female so when gets pop Jesus into existence you were in him again we're talking about the bride which is you please understand this I'm talking about you I was failing to you Church when that's picado it wasn't him so when God spoke Christ you were in him so that separate Adam to give out he took part of his spirit it was no spirit from anywhere else it was the spirit of who Adam rather it means when God put Christ to sleep on the cross the Bible said blood and water came out of him but about him said that gave birth to the bride so potentially that's a body that was being formed now that body you would call you know it's many the byproduct but remember the spirit is not the back brother let God get the spirit to give Eve from Adam so when the bride was given birth on the cross so God could never take a spirit from anywhere else but in Christ so the Holy Spirit you have but a listener the Holy Spirit you have is that feminist spirit that made the bride I'm sorry I don't want to get too excited but but you see we're not the Holy Spirit is God right but do you know that's a lower version of God so therefore ever was a lower version of Adam the spirit that made F was nothing else but the spirit of Adam the spirit that made you was nothing else but the Spirit of Christ the spirit but when I'm said listen again it's not my words but when I'm whose words he said the first Adam to hide the second Adam so what does it mean anything that happened in the first Adam it's the same thing happen in the second Adam so Christ was created a third person the Holy Spirit you received is nothing else but that weaker part of God but yet because that spirit is none other than God that's why when brother bottom refers to you he said you are only putting so then why because the Spirit is one God so it's not really the same spirit like Adam spirit that made Eve because the spirit that came out of God can't be weak can't be you know worthless or helpless cuz whatever that came out of God is nothing else but God himself whether it's a little speck that came out of that great fountain is God when you go to the sea to the beach take a spoon take a spoonful of water when you take it out of the sea does that become something else then see what is that still see put in a spoon so adult God came out came the Holy Spirit so the Holy Spirit is not other but God himself now listen because the Holy Spirit is none other than God Himself makes you made you what God Himself then but it doesn't say listen when Adam went after if to save if he could not save if what he felt Eve right why because his spirit was made to form why because God put that spirit in the flesh so the okay becomes like subject to form because that the spirit didn't have a flesh it wouldn't never fall so because the spirit was subject to fall God put that in you know in a flash and then it fell so now God just like Adam in spirit could not come and die so he had to come down in flesh so just like he made Adam because he again I'm gonna tell you this when God was making the earth the heavens you know he wasn't taking about anything else but you he saw you just like I'm looking at you looking at me he saw you and he's hot already fell in love for you so therefore everything he was doing was doing for you so his heart was crazy and to have you today so he was lonely before he's not lonely anymore why because he has a wife he's longing to be with his wife in the Millennium so everything he was making he made them for you in his mind and that is why when you referring to the bride you're not referring to anything like to do something that's whatever and that's why you cannot pray for someone to be in the right cause God knew he is bright god no who is brightest so I cannot pray for no one here to be part of the bride you're gonna have to change your prayer if you were praying like that because you can't change God's mind you can pray God to save your children to save your husband you're a part of the bride there will be but God please I want my husband to be with me in the rupture who are you you ain't got that right to tell God that you want your husband to be in a rupture your wife but you can tell him to save them the rapture is only given to God God alone no one else that you know you are his bride it doesn't give it to you why because our young man my own sister just got married the young man that shows her there was a lot of other sisters here but he chose to be with her was it because she was praying so much to him no if he's her I didn't go to her he would marry her it's not the amount of failure but he had to love her she had to love him for them to be together God did not make a mistake choosing you he knew he would love him he knew he would remain faithful God would not make a bet on job hadn't known that job would forsake him but he knew and he said do what you got to do cuz he would never forsake me and you did his wife for sake but job Stood Still okay so God doesn't make a mistake about his bride so don't worry who's come and go don't worry about that that's God's business your business to make sure your soul is right with him okay so when God made Adam Eve was in him so when God made Christ you were in him so that is what about him said when he died on Calvary I died with him he walked on Galilee I worked with him he was sleeping on the board I was sleeping with him they spit on his face they spit on our face because we were in him so whatever that happened to him happened to you okay now when you consider yourself as a young lady that you are not going to be called by-product or you want to be recognized as equal to a man what do you think you gonna make the bribe look like the bride of Jesus Christ because you are the mirror image of the bride of the Lord so your action speaks of the bride because Adams actions speak of God the same thing Adam did God did Adam loved if so much he gave his life for Eve so Adam wasn't doing anything contrary to God so now you have to understand your behavior your action your thoughts on comparing to the bride's action behavior and thumbs so now the way you talked either be a slap in that face are you spinning in his face again so when you standing and say you know what you're gonna let yourself be invade that the speed of the world feminism so that's spinning in God's face so you don't have to stand for these things and it's not God that is not lowering you lower than nobody no but God wants you to understand that in you he had something in his mind that you wanted to bring up so he couldn't do it any other way but to put it in you so that's what I do but I've said you or when a woman knows her place she has a greater reward than a man it's in the message you have a greater reward than the men so you don't have to fight to be like a man to Akaka men from people to know that oh man I am NOT gonna let no man disrespect me you don't have to do that I'm I'm gonna remind you do you know that God are quicker for you than a man faster why because he's the one that said you a weaker vessel therefore he got to okay so he got to step up for you quicker faster than the men okay so now listen when the woman but when I talk about the woman in the message that her husband didn't want her to go to church so she her car key and he took the in rouen away so she won't do anything she did not leave her place oh you took my you boom I'm gonna show you you you don't know who you messing with and then they they're right under is where do you know you actually that's when you lower yourself down like you're degrading yourself when you're doing that because they're bringing you up oh oh you all know you messing with and they think you know they pissing himself you know no it's the great the degrading for a woman to add that way so she did not do that or you through Mike you away or gonna say I'm gonna burn your clothes so she didn't do that she let go reach up in the closet and take all the frozen dictum I am drama go to his going take a baseball bat enema she didn't do that or take a spray and spray up with a he's cold you take a good mess with me know so you don't have to do that what did she do you know what she did she said honey what would you like to eat today what would you like to eat today fish okay baby she went to the marketplace she never prayed for God to give her no keys back no she ever fought for it but she was being the women got met her so because she was doing that dad had to step up for her and yes he did because what happened so when she went in the water person to buy the fish please tell me if he cut a miracle a kid I was thrown but in the river or where they threw the key so he went by the fish you know preparing the fish cut it open where was that kid inside the fish why the only reason why she could she found the key was because she remained in her place so there's no reward for you out of your place that has no reason to ask for you when you taking the flight into your own hands that's what the Bible say if you want to win your husband stay quiet you can win him in silence you don't have to fight with you because God is the world with the big muscles okay he didn't make you to be a Brenda like a manner like a man go to the gym and lift up weights you don't make you for that so because he knows you can't live for weights like that then he's going to lift it up for you so if your husband is too much for you turn him over to God sister na you will have to fight your battles he said God you call me to be this way right no problem then you take over take over so she stayed in her place and God came through for her it's the same that you serve in today my young sisters listen you don't have to you know like going back and forth with a boy to make the boy respect you as a matter of fact he will never respect you going back and forth with him no let him talk you know so when God said you know the weaker vessel doesn't mean you have floor mat or you know he can do what a very pleased with you push you around no because I need you to remember this before you are any means you were God first so God will always come through for you always always come through for you so when the message called you a weaker vessel it's the same thing for the bride the bride is the weaker vessel so if you want to be like a man so you telling me the bride has to oh we want to be like that's not the same thing it's not the same thing you want to act like a man do everything a man can do that's not what we singing bill to be like that's not what it is it's not the same thing when it could be like Jesus not wanna be like a man like a man no because the Bible said Christ is the husband you the wife so Christ is the head you cannot beat her head to be like Jesus than me and you gotta be the head like Jesus doesn't know there's only one head and it's Jesus Christ so let me tell you this to finish God said if him created Eve a different creation in the invisible union of the bride he said if he created Eve a different creation it would have been this complementary to God's grace wisdom it would have been this complementary to God's great wisdom why but why do so meaning if we spoke about so it would have been stumped something wrong with the wisdom of God why because remember in the creating in the creation of man God was wasn't looking at nothing else but himself so because he was looking at himself he know what was in him that he wanted to display okay so he made the men like him so in that man he showed an image of what he was going to do later on so the bride today if you understand the creation of Adam and Eve you will understand your relationship with God and that is why what I wanna make sure that you understand that Jesus Christ is not a small God with a great God he's not a second in a Trinity of God because if it is like that something is wrong with the image okay so because Jesus is the God so therefore when you came out you did not come out in flesh from Jesus okay that's where we're trying to go so we can close we we did not come out in flesh that is why the Batwa said you must be born again because you are not supposed to be burned away you were born you are supposed to be spoken up okay so Jesus was spoken up so your flesh did that come out of Jesus okay but what came out of Jesus that made you was only his spirit that should call today the Holy Ghost you here with me now now the holy ghost is a spirit just like the spirit that came out of Adam which was if needed what a body so the Holy Ghost needed needed a body okay so now remember what about I've said God is powerless without a body when he's talking about God is referring to the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost can do without a body and the radicals was only given for the grandmother alone so the Holy Ghost was not given and when you go out there you seen the religion people on speaking in tone it's not really the Holy Ghost because when you referring to the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of God given to his bride and the bride alone the spirit of Adam was never in any other female body so this we love God can never be in any other trust but he's bright Jesus I also don't understand that now when you have the Holy Ghost what do you need for the Holy Ghost to be complete not this blood not this body not this flesh you need what a spoken word body are you here with me now you need what a spoken word body that is where everyone I've said the bride must be what does the spoken word just like Jesus Christ is what the spoken word so now don't look at your flesh because in your flesh you will miss the image and your spoken word body is coming because red lights being formed how in three stages first this flesh second the oh honey third what glorified body that's when you have the complete word so when you say you wanna see Jesus like he is you cannot see him in his body and that's what about the Bible says you will be like him this is not like Jesus so to be like him to become like him so you would have to have the same body Jesus huh Jesus had a glorified body he still does and the body Jesus was created in was not a body made through sex it was spoken up you know you were never spoken up I'm gonna tell you this you know there was only one soul mate and then after that one soul mate there's only another swear there was only two people that can really tell they also met so in English I hear people say that a lot when they married someone or they have boyfriend and girlfriend or whatever oh that's my soul mate no no no no and no so me okay when you referring to soul mate I'm gonna explain to you this Adam and Eve could refurb as so big why because the spirit the very spirit that was the Adam was truly made Eve he made Eve truly made Eve so after that after the fall no man or woman good wasn't it the same way so you can never call yourself so mean so the second person that can call themselves so many's Christ and the right why because the Spirit of God is in the right so after in between there's no soul mate and that is why the Bible say who can be in the bed one goal once day so if you saw me you both gotta go because you are so met with Christ that's why you can't go to the rapture that's right so Adam could never let Eve die by herself why because they were so me if Adam let Eve went to Hell by herself Adam would have never ever been able to have another you cuz what would God I had to do god I gotta already taken to the spirit of Eve out of Adam so there was nothing else left so where did well with that so he would have to create and Eve so he was he he couldn't do it he couldn't do it so the same for you the spirit in you is God and because the Spirit is God it makes you none other than God also cause in the Bible when you call Adam didn't one didn't come you know how many people came to people because when you call Adam Eve did not name was not named Eve her name was Adam and that is why what about aunt called you today what Jesus is Jesus Christ so you see the same thing is happening with you but we have to stay in our place to close this is what I'm gonna tell you church barb Adam says the Alpha and the Omega okay the Alpha is the first one right Omega is the last right so in between Alpha and Omega you know there is nothing god is not alpha through Omega okay so meaning is not nothing in the middle so he's the beginning right he's the end right he also called you what the same thing Alpha and Omega okay in between the Baptist the Methodist so did not part of the bride alright so why are you the Alpha the Omega because the Omega was none other than the same Alpha that came back around so the bride is none other then Jesus Christ came back in a body of people are you here with me so if it is Jesus Christ that came back in a body of people what do you think is going to happen what do you think is going to happen so one day but about I'm say when they look at you they will know Jesus Christ was here but will they see Jesus will they see him walking like it was working on Galilee but how they will see him through you through you so the woman became the main at the end but in one way by his spirit she didn't fight for him by his spirit so Church I'm gonna let you go with this thing you don't have to pray God to give you something that's already yours you don't have to fight for word you don't have to cry out for it because it's already given to you you know the only thing you need to do is just reach and take it just reach and take it your sorrows can be over if you know joy was given to you praying day and night won't bring you joy the reason why I'm telling you this because I come to find out the other day and nobody was preaching any state that and I'm like that's still good brain day and night won't give you joy all you think you got to do is one reach and take it so if you wanna if you if you say you wanna stop all the cryin the only thing you got to do is one stop crying you don't have to pray to stop crying you stop crying okay God is already has already given you everything that you have needle why because the husband is in the bride is what what what I've said he is in the bride who you are is what he is you don't have to fight anymore you don't have to labor anymore just take what you need now I left something behind another day I bring it to you because my time is up sisters god bless you you don't have to take on the spirit of the world to feel like you something you are already more than something you don't have to you know for marriage to lasts you know what didn't what it means understanding he knows his place she knows errs does it that's all otherwise we're going to fight god bless you gonna leave you with this word I'm not gonna hide no more remember remember your place that's what I'm saying remember your place god bless you oh let escape [Applause] praise Lord let's give the Lord another hand clapping Wow so much for saying brother Reginald god bless you we certainly do appreciate that message amen man we all need an understanding whether it's male or female when a brother recognize is truly what that sister means to him he'll know how to treat her right amen I don't have to force my wife to do anything if I love her right she'll do it all it takes is love and understanding like our brothers saying you know I was the whole time he was preaching all I could see was redemption story you know he'd been a part of Adam we were talking about in Sunday school one so when Eve had fallen again she wasn't Eve at that time she was at him but when she fell she came back to Adam Adam was still standing there in eternity and Eve was already in time when she approached him Adam was in eternity she was in a fallen condition in time and God was going to take her life but Adam had to move over and inject some of himself into her so God could not take her and that's the same thing our Lord did we were in a fallen condition Jesus stepped out of time to become our sin like Adam did for me and all I could see was Redemption as she was preaching brother amen when a man takes a woman like brother Steven took sister Rachel at the end of the ceremony I now present to you mr. and mrs. Funderburk they became one again that was redemption he redeemed what was already his that woman that was taken from his side he redeemed her back that's what a wedding ceremony is all all I could see was redemption he did so much for us he did so much let's stand together let's sing this little song together and bow down and worship Him his brother-in-law was speaking earlier song came to my mind as he was talking about the brother at the foot of that [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Wow [Music] we man Hey so [Music] [Music] Jesus wait to say like you this race Hey my a change Mesmer [Music] my god father the work that your father's understand we can't pray one another to Prodigy's smooth but it's all very small energy choices and you knows the in from the beginning you saw not God that we have overseen notice you make you lords for so you put the wedding band of predestination is one of us for God that we may come Lord to the message of our Father if we were back in the days of Moses we would have believed in the we were the days of Noah we would have believed in the days of John the Baptist we wouldn't believe them in today's call our brain is poly car all the different ones Lord God we would have believed because we believe the word is out I'm so glad that you wore Danis for the hour that you come would never touch them we shall be changed [Music] then just sing revelation tears you have spoken to mrs.
