our thought before we left uh we thank God for taking us and bringing us back home safely uh it's good to be back amen uh you missed the Mr Saints uh but but we certainly enjoyed our our our trip there the crews that the Lord allowed us to go with our family we just thank God for that a wonderful wonderful time and and I'll bring a portion of the cruise out today amen uh and y'all just it'll be fitting through certain sermons here and there so y'all just get ready to hear anything I got to share you know but we thank the Lord for for all things uh Luke chapter 4 verse 16 says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah um uh and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me and he hath anointed me uh to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the Brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised and I just love the the way that the scripture says the recovering of sight uh because when when you see that recovering uh to recover something you had to lose it first and then it's recovered so somehow a man the gospel must be preached in order for those that used to see something that have lost their sight spiritually they used to believe what you believe but they lost their sight spiritually but Jesus comes with an anointing a man to help people recover their sight come on somebody amen the Bible says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord which is the Year of Jubilee uh and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wandered at the the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and he said uh and they said is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily I said to you no Prophet is accepted in his own country but I say unto you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when thou when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save unto serepto a city of Sinai unto a woman that was a that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in a time of at least elysius the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian verse 28 says in all they in the synagogue when they heard these words were filled with wrath amen they got upset at the review real word amen praise let's bow in a word of prayer father we thank you for uh the opportunity we have to come and to Lord just worship you and to praise you and to thank you and Lord as we enter into this portion of the service we pray that you take complete control over every thought that is being presented in every thought that is being received we take control we we by about a help of the Holy Ghost we take control over every spirit that is against the spirit of God and we pray that you would just have the preeminence uh in this place bless those that are present those that are online those that will watch later we ask that you administer to every heart and to every need God we give you all the glory all the honor and all the Praises in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen God bless you can be seated uh we are continuing our journey amen through um a a a a a sermon that I titled God is in his man and uh as as we're going through this I just kind of felt to kind of go back uh to a series that I did on uh God is in his people God is in his Universe God is in nature God is in his word God is in his son and then finish it off with God is in his man uh so we're we're revisiting or the last time I preached we Revisited some of those uh sermons we'll do a little bit more revisiting today amen until we get ourselves into this thought of God as in his man but before uh I uh get started down that path uh this was a testimony that I I heard this morning and and when a brother uh uh Josue came in towards his brother Felix and his wife is coming this morning I said well is that right so I just got this testimony this morning and uh God knows how to speak to his people amen so this uh is a testimony from a brother by the name of brother Sajid now brother Sajid lives in Pakistan and uh brother Sergeant he says he he says hello brother Lee and you know he's talking to a brother that that that actually uh is responsible for the eight o'clock call that we do in the morning and uh brother Lee lives out in California but brother sergeant in Pakistan reached out to brother Lisa hey brother

here to preach now and and I want y'all to understand a lot of times I I have to say these things because you know we living here the reason I preach a lot of faith is because I see where the church living you want to know how you want to know how I know how you where you living it's based on how you talking I just listen how you talk I listen at the things you say and then tell me you live in here we are we are people that's supposed to be way up here [Music] come on church amen spoken word creation comes from these lips come on Churchill I mean we gotta you know we can't we can't come in here and be saying amen and then go out there and start saying something different you you just amen it's like it's like uh uh uh planting a seed are y'all with me it's like playing to see God gives you his word his word is C and when you take that seed and plant it you have to commit it to the Earth and then you have to water that seed and the way you water the seed you have to give it give God praise that's how you water your seeds you gotta thank God before you even see it you got a fake copy before you even feel it Hallelujah somebody you got a water to see with praise not with doubts because when you speak Dallas amen all you did was dig up the seed and you got to go through the process all over again I know what I planted so I thank God for it already being done all right all right I am trying my best I'm trying my best Hallelujah we were um talking about God is in his man and we started this Sermon Just giving a little story of a Young Man that wanted to see God and and I just wonder are there people here this morning that want to see God we've heard about what he's done amen we've heard about his power we've heard about his greatness we want to see that God in action the Bible says he is the same yesterday today and forever and so I don't put a question on if he is no no that's not even part of my vocabulary I know he is the same yesterday today and forever so since he is then we want to see him do what he did amen it's one thing to be encouraged by what happened in somebody else day but this is my day come on I have a Red Sea that I'm standing in front of and I need a God to come on the scene and open up a Red Sea for me um I I found myself dwelling in the midst of some Lions I need God to shut the lion's mouth for me Hallelujah somebody amen I know God Did It for Daniel it's not if he did it I know God Did It for Daniel I know he did it for the Hebrew boys I know he did it for a man of the Israelites I I know he did it praise God and now is my time now it's my turn if the Bible had to be Rewritten they'd be writing your testimonies by faith Jack by faith brother keep us back by paint sister Brown by faith sister Erica but I think sister Nelly sister Michelle by faith brother Mark by faith sister Tina praise God by faith brother Troy bye Faith sister Sandra believe God by faith [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah they'd be reading your testimonies people want to see God we want to see them we want to experience them amen amen amen brother Branham even told us amen that that we have to be a part of a church where uh the supernatural is made known to the people something they can get a a hold on they can grab it and hold on to it the supernatural amen Hallelujah so this young man wanted to see God and he went to his mom and said mama can I can I see God mama had no answer for him she's like I don't know if you can see God or not she said why don't you uh go ask your Sunday school teacher they they going through the scripture with the acts of Sunday school teacher so he went to the Sunday school teacher and he asked a question I mean can you just see him sitting there listening at the lesson and they just going through the lesson at the end he said I got one question can I see God I know you're talking about him but can I see him and uh and the Sunday school teacher said I don't know now you probably need to ask the pastor that question so the pastor amen the boy finally make his way to the past and and maybe the pastor talking to this person talking to that person like what you want Sonny I just got one question Pastor can I see God you've been preaching about him the Sunday school teacher talking about him Mama make me come to church to hear about them but cannot see him the pastor tells the little boy said oh no man can see God and live a little young fellas say oh okay all right uh no man can see God and live and say all right okay it didn't satisfy the longing that was in his heart the Bible I mean the Bible says there's a deep calling amen then there has to be a deep to respond to that crime Hallelujah so this boy still had a deep in him amen that that wanted to see that that question satisfied so he found himself in a boat one day amen with an old fisherman and inside the boat they come up a storm amen and an old fish was kind of getting things preparing like we gotta we gotta weather this storm we gotta get out of here somehow you know and I don't want you I pretty much I don't want your blood to be on my hands son we gotta we gotta figure out how to get out of this situation so God let the storm pass over glory and I believe the Storm Is Passing over for some of y'all glory to God Amen the storm passed over and a big rainbow came out and an old fisherman just began to cry and a little boy said now why would he cried that rainbow like that he the man knew God's promises that was in the rainbow that God wasn't going to destroy the Earth with water again he knew the promises of God that was there so he said The Boy The Boy got excited he came from the back of the boat to the friend of both say I asked my mama I asked the Sunday school teacher I asked my pastor and nobody got an answer for me how he said now I want to ask you the question can I see come the man looked up say son amen everywhere I turn I see God I see him in the rainbow amen I see him even in the storm hey I see him in my storm because he's the one that's able to calm the storm Hallelujah eyes everywhere I turn I see God I see him in his people I see him in nature I see him in the animals come on I see God everywhere I turn glory to God I see him in his word I see him in his son I see him in his man I see God hallelujah hallelujah so we talked about this amen God was in his people and that creative characteristic that was in Moses glory to God that was not Moses creating uh flies and frogs and lice and all that it was a creative characteristic of God that was dwelling in Moses amen also we uh we we looked at God in his universe and brother Brandon made the statement God is just like the air he feels all the universe amen we looked at God in nature and we talked about that Tola worm amen and how the total worm attaches itself to a tree and when that when that that that that female worm is going to get attached to that tree she has one purpose that's to give birth and she realizes that once she attaches there is no getting her out that tree amen and she attaches herself she wants to give birth and she realizes once she does give birth she will also die hey hallelujah amen when Christ was attached to a tree attached across amen he died but he also gave birth to us so we see God in nature God is in his word God is in his son God is in his man let's pick up this thought on God is in his word amen for today if we can and we'll go as far as we can and let the Lord take it from there all right this uh statement out of the sermon modern events are made clear by prophecy uh we we want to look at God in his words you you you know I don't know if you've ever experienced this yourself but there's been times Amen in my life that I'm going through a particular trial amen and as I'm going through the trial uh sometimes I just don't know where the encouragement Gonna Come where the strength Gonna Come and there are times that I just pick up my Bible and and it's not it's not even a whole chapter sometimes it's just a phrase in the verse come on somebody it don't even have to be the whole verse but just a phrase in the verse and I would find inspiration from what God wrote in his words the one thing I know is that God cannot lie and I don't I don't I don't take the Bible to say this was only to a generation in the past if I'm holding it I don't care if it was written to the the uh the the Israelites amen I don't care who what letter Paul might arrest to some City amen if it's written if it's written to them it's written to me so I I make the word of God personal amen if he says I'm the Lord that healeth all your diseases he was talking to me it's his word is real sometimes the word just magnifies that are scripture that you don't read for years and all of a sudden you run into it in a certain season of your life it just means more to you God's in his word the prophet says this in the message modern events are made clear by prophecy it says now the events that we see taking place it's absolutely showed in the Bible of every age we think we're all out of Cana he says but we're not everything's moving just exactly with God's word now the Bible is a different book from any other sacred poop my there's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God oh the Bible and you want to know why the devil fights you from reading your Bible because the Bible is God in word form see a word is a thought Express God's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets and they wrote the Bible which is in word form and Jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of his kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere hallelujah amen this book of Prophecy is foretelling future events now the book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add to it or take from it and every Revelation must come by it see it must be the word now you know there's a statement regarding the Bible not moving amen from here to the next quote going to be Dr Moses but before I get there amen um the the Bible brother man who says no book like it no book like it and uh uh the one of the things that you find in the Bible is unique because it was written by over 40 authors amen over a 1500 year span think about it which is 40 Generations 40 over 40 authors through for 40 Generations on three continents the Bible is constructed over three continents and these continents it was constructed in Africa the Bible was constructed in Africa Hallelujah because the children of Israel was down in Egypt oh come on somebody amen and they were down in Egypt which is a part of Africa writing and Moses was there when the children leading him to the promised land right it was Africa in Asia as well as Europe also it was uh comprised in three different languages they got the Hebrew amen the Arabic as well as the Greek and we use the Greek Lexicon because this is the origination of the scripture these languages amen the Bible has been read by more people and published in more languages than any other book in history another thing over a billion copies of the Bible have been published the Bible has survived persecution and criticism over the centuries and I just a reminder of uh brother Brandon telling a story of how um you know in the in the Tabernacle they had a flood one time and uh and when they had this flood amen he had his Bible open on the pulpits amen and somehow uh when when the flood happened I think the pulpit even raised but when it came back down the Bible was still open God protected his words there's other things in the church that was destroyed but not the words glory to God the word was protected and the word is still protected here brother Brandon makes a statement in the message is Dr Moses he says well what do you uh what do you do what do you now just about two dozen that's never been in one of the campaigns before we certainly welcome you our beloved friends and and love uh and love with the Lord Jesus may his Spirit stir you tonight in your emotions greatly to love him more and more that's the whole thing we want you to love God more and more so now this is always fundamentally the correct word of God the Bible and look at what it says every bit of it is inspired and it's all God's word and God is in his word so if God is in his word then if you receive the words you receive God if you receive the word you receive God what about if you reject the word you reject God plain and simple amen if you receive the word you receive God Amen he says uh now that is God's plan God's motive God's attitude God's love God's salvation everything rests in his printed words amen and if those words are just like greens or seed that you could pick out and swallow every one of them would produce just exactly what it says it'll do here but by faith we receive them go on it says this now someone asked me some time ago said brother Brandon when those Visions come is that part of God I said that secondarily God the vision is secondarily gone right it says uh it says it says it's that secondarily God's word if that would say something that wasn't according to this Bible then it would be a it would absolutely be wrong this and when it's saying this he's doing this this is first Hallelujah the word of God is first I don't care what nobody say the word must be first not nobody's Vision not nobody's dream not nobody's experience it's got to be the word first if division the dream The Experience does not line up with the word then discredit it because it's an evil spirit that's trying to take you away from the word brother Branham had to get that brother straightened out he's he's he's want to run the city I mean run the country he got a wife at home but he got a woman that's running with him that's been divorced multiple times but she got a lot of money and uh and she want to go from City to City uh you know with his brother to meetings and and just telling the prophet that you know we feel led to do this and and uh brother random say well you feel led to do that say yeah yeah we feel that what you think about it say don't ask me what I think don't ask me what I think well we just want to know you don't agree with this and they just kept digging kept thinking he said no I don't agree with it it's completely off the word of God you got a wife at home my brother you need to be home with your wife not running the country with this woman it don't look right Hallelujah he says it don't look right for you to do something like that you bring reproach on the gospel you see the word got to be first I don't care about nobody's dream nobody's Vision amen keep it in the word make sure that thing line back up with the words all right let's keep going see that's secondarily God's word if that if that would say something that wasn't according to this Bible then it would absolutely be wrong this is first and now this is God he said I'm I'm the Lord that healeth thee all the healing comes from God he's the one does the healing all the Divine promises come from God because it's his word to you and to me now let's just look at a scripture here when he says all the word of God is inspired you know because people will tell you that well this man that wrote the Bible and and and and and the truth of the matter is it was man that wrote the Bible that's that's true part true this man that wrote it but he was inspired by God right second Timothy 3 16. all scripture all scripture amen is given by inspiration of God Glory I like this and it's profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that is what scripture is used for it's a man is is profitable of a Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction righteous now just keep the scripture there for me amen I I went to the scripture in the emphatic diagram and also say this it says all scripture divinely inspired is indeed profitable for teaching so amen if we gonna teach something we got to teach it from the Bible glory to God I thought when I first started out the ministry I I mentioned to the Lord I just had a talk with the Lord I said Lord I've heard a lot of preachers preach in my day and uh and I didn't agree with everything they said I saw a lot of people say amen I saw the church that's on fire but in my spirit I was not agreeing with what they were saying I say Lord if I came see it in the scripture I can't preach it I don't care how many people said amen if I cannot base that old scripture then I came preaching glory to God Amen even to this day I hear different Brothers might go into the message they pull this out and pull it out if I can't see that thing flowing in the scripture I ain't saying and I ain't repeating it I don't care how many people say it come on search glory to God you you want to be a part of a church that is standing on the words see Heaven and Earth have passed away but this word gonna be gonna be remaining we want to stand on the word not an experience come on church not an experience not a dream not a not a not an emotion we want the words all right now amen could the devil give you all that just to get you off to work all right now he says oh he says uh emphatic dialogue says all scripture Divine Inspire is indeed profitable for teaching another other thing the scripture is used for amen it stands up a profitable Doctrine but for reproof you see that there well what what that means the word of God is profitable amen for conviction let me just put it like this if the word don't convict you you can't be convicted the words should get kind of cut you get you know make your toes feel a little short sometimes pull them in them inside your shoes the word should do that to you sometimes come on somebody's word is not picking on you but it's picking off you the word should bring conviction you and if you if you if you feel conviction you ought to thank God for it that means god dealing with you when you stop feeling conviction you got a big problem on your hands the words amen it says all scripture divinely inspires indeed profitable teaching for teaching for conviction for correction for that for that discipline which is in righteousness so I like that for when it says profitable for Doctrine is instruction or learning when it says profitable for reproof or convictionist it's instructive conviction in the ways of God God wants you to live according to his words amen profitable for correction means chastisement and the Bible says that whom the Lord loves you chase he chastises when it's profitable for instruction that means discipline amen and what it means is it's the whole training and education of the children of God and this cultivates your your mind and your morals the word of God should cultivate your mind and your morals come on somebody the reason the sisters dressed the way they dress is because the word of God says so the reason the brothers dressed the way they dressed it because the word of God say so come on not just because brother Branham said brother Branham only said what the Bible said hello somebody amen we're following because it's what the Bible said oh come on give me Deuteronomy 22. verse 5. see it's in the Bible and when we found it in the Bible we just live it this is what the Bible say the woman shall not wear that which was pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garments for all that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God now most people say that was for the Old Testament no no no you can't say that because in the Old Testament they also had thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness thou shall not Thou shalt not they had all the Ten Commandments and that was just not for the children of Israel that's for us right now so from Genesis to revelation we believe the word let's move on here let's move on here I want to just show you God is always hiding things in his words when we read the story of Abraham and Isaac God was hiding something amen when Moses made the statement the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me God was hiding something amen when he came to Isaiah and said a virgin shall conceive God was hiding something but when Jesus was born and Jesus began to walk the face of the Earth he was the Fulfillment of these things that God was hiding now I want you to catch this now out of the pergament church age I want you to catch this because God is in his word and and and and when God when God God God gave his word God gave prophecies and thank God was in that God was in it all and when when Christ came and manifested that prophecy now God is in a man the same God that was in his word is the same God that is taking on flesh and he's in a man don't miss God being in the man Glory Hallelujah now I want you to catch this because one of my favorite quotes I like to read out of purging me a church age God is in his words if you ever want inspiration if you ever want encouragement if you ever want strength if you ever want correction go back to the word of God amen let God take care of it you'll find him in his word amen but here I love the statement I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word are we impressed with the words in our midst right it says let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in the name amen or it's in his name or if there isn't any answer so now now see I want y'all to get that now please get that when you pray don't just be using cute words always put the name of Jesus in your prayer Amen in the name of your son what is his name his name is Jesus right so he said if you pray in his name then you'll get an answer to your prayer but if you don't pray in his name you can't expect an answer it says yet in in first John 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will glory he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of God it says there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God if you want to know what the will of God is read the word of God here we go he says uh uh uh uh uh what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Lamentations 337 who is he that saith and it comes to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it all right so we can ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask until it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate God in the word they are one now he goes on and makes this comment here because I just love it it says now then this word right here this words Glory uh he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith all right look at it now he says when you accepted by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life John 6 63 B but that is exactly what he is John 14 6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8 9 be if any man have not the spirit a man of Christ is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word now here's that statement here it is so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking that's the same as deity speaking now you know God come come up here and hide himself in and and reveal himself in Simplicity you know you know now now some of y'all if brother Brandon would have been here and said I give you your son I give you your daughter I give you this I give you that you're like oh praise God the promise said well what about when somebody else come up and say it I I heard I heard um uh we was at the meetings last year and and uh uh brother brother Solomon was was talking to a couple sisters about some things that they were looking for amen the house that they were looking for and these sisters heard them just kind of sharing they um they they hurt and at the end of the conversation themselves to say both of them at the same time say we give you your house nah nah you know what you can sit there and say well that's just these two sisters no you got to recognize God and his people and if you could if you could apply with faith you can receive what the person is saying I give you your healing you can receive that right now oh my God my God my God hey man oftentimes we want to wait to feel something you ain't gotta wait to feel nothing when somebody say I give you the Lord I receive it I give you that customer Lord I receive it come on somebody amen I give you that job Lord I receive it you ain't got to be sitting well I just wondered no no is that God is that not God you sit there in your down you'll never have nothing come on when a spirit man come on church this is what the problem where he says when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and don't leave it there in your heart place it upon lips which means don't cross Pete place it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking and then it don't stop there Every Mountain [Music] [Applause] I ain't gotta wait to see the mountain go brother random see if we leave one grain of sand at a time it's still moving praise God Every Mountain has to go the mountain of sickness has to go the mountain of disease has to go the mountain of unbelief has to go I mean every Mountain I don't care what it is to go and you want to know what else he said Satan cannot stand before that man [Applause] what's that statement you made brother about uh fighting a defeated enemy don't let a defeated enemy defeat you that's just ridiculous you're gonna get defeated by a defeated enemy person that's already lost you gonna be defeated by that not me praise God I'ma keep the devil in this place anybody know what this place is [Applause] we used to sing that I went come on church I took back what he stole from me oh you better go get it hey man it don't belong to the devil God gave it to you so you go get it back from the Devil my I took back what he's told from me oh Jesus oh my my my my my is under my feet Church God is in his word God is also in his son I'm talking about God in his son Jesus had to tell him say when you seen me you've seen the father they they like that shows the father says you know you don't get it you don't get it you're looking at God when you see me you're seeing the father right and and hey brother Brandon amazing super say the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible is that Jesus is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ you want to know God's name Jesus all power was given to Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament Acts chapter 9 verse four through five glory to God look at this it says and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul which is Paul he's talking about Saul saw why persecuted thou me and he said who are thou Lord Paul talking to a pillar fire amen this great light that's shining Paul shining and Paul not only sunlight but there was other people saw the light but Paul heard the voice that came from the light glory to God here's the question there's many people that saw the pillar fire in brother branham's day but did they hear the voice because God is in his man did they hear the voice that was coming from the pillar fire hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he says who are thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is harmony to kick against the pricks it was it was it was it was here Paul on the road to Damascus amen when he has his experience and he recognizes that that same pillar fire that led the children of Israel out of out of Egypt glory to God he was talking to that very same pillow fire same pillow fire that when God spoke in the beginning let there be light and that wasn't so s u in light that was s o n light and when that son light came forth this is the light that Paul was talking to and that light took a picture with a prophet today we know he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm Jesus whom you persecute look at this out of the message who is this Melchizedek brother random says now we find out that this person had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life it was God in morphe now the word comes he says the Greek word means change is a change was used the Greek word means change was used changing himself in more faith from one person one person the Greek word they're in morphe means it was taken from the stage act that one person has changed his Mass to make him some other character look at it this is like in school just recently I believe Rebecca just before she graduated they had one of Shakespeare's plays and one young man had to change his clothes several times now in the play it's the same young fella acting out different parts now here's the thing the congregation or the audience knew that it was the same Young fella how could they tell how could they tell not by his outfit but his voice would give him away maybe the height of this young man would give away maybe his stature or his bill would give away so no matter what part he was playing it was still the same young man and this is where we got to be able to see amen and father Son and Holy Ghost is still the same God in the office of father in the office of son in the office of holy spirit it's the same God changing his Mass it's not three different gods it's the same God look at it now it says to change his clothes several times because he played two or three different parts but the same person had come out one time he was a villain and when you come out the next time he was another character and now the Greek word and morphe means that he changed his mask goes on Glory Glory Glory he said that's what God did it's the same God all the time God in the form of the father of the spirit the pill of fire the same God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in morphe brought out so he could be seen amen and now that same God is the Holy Ghost father son uh not three Gods three opposites three acts of the one God the Bible said there is one God not three but that's how they says uh they couldn't you you can't get that get this straightened out and have three Gods you would never sell a Jew that I'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one God this is why a lot of people don't follow Christianity because they they still bringing out three Gods that's amen that's that's that's actually polytheistic you got to get back to Revelation that God is one amen God is one it was God in the father God and the son God in the in in the Holy Ghost is the same God and all those three officers now is God dwelling inside of you glory to God stay with me here he says The Great I Am I'm sorry I'm going to the message the revelation of Jesus Christ amen let me uh yeah this is this is kind of where I want to be here Revelation Jesus Christ we're just talking about I'm hitting the highlights on this God is God is in his son the greatest Revelation you can ever get is that Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ is God not not a set and I'm gonna go a little further we don't heard the scripture preached us so many times that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life and we got signed that sign that showed up at football stadiums John 3 16. and people have done it without Revelation and understanding let me let me try to make sure you understand it wasn't just God sending his son I want you to think about this if you had a son praise God Amen and um uh your son had done nothing wrong but maybe you love me so much you say you know and you might have set up a rule say now brother Jack if you go over this line if you go over this line you're gonna die brother Jack and uh I said okay that's the rule if I go over the line and then I go and I step across the line oh you like well brother Jack I love you so much I don't want to see you die I'ma bring my son over here he gonna die in your place you're gonna call your son whatever his name is he'll come here come your son he say son I'm sorry I don't want to see brother Jack die I'm gonna have to send you down there yes son if I was your son if I was just I'd say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what was the rule if you said brother Jack go cross the line he died it brother Jack go across the line what brother Jack gone by I didn't go across the line so I ain't dying for him if I was just something that's the way I respond I mean God thinks big bigger and better than that so it wasn't God giving us his son God actually became the son so he could die for us oh my God had to take on flesh in order to die for us so he he went from Spirit form because God was a spirit and they that worship Him must worship him in in spirit and in truth come on God was a spirit so God had to take on flesh and he took on flesh in the body of Jesus it was the same God all the time changing his Mass let's pick this up the revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brandon make some statements here says The Great I Am the almighty God has come as Spirit to fill his true church he says he has a right to move anywhere he wants to and upon anybody he wants to we don't make any holy men amongst us but the whole true Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because of the presence of the Holy Spirit it is he the holy spirit that is Holy not the congregation of itself it's not you but it's what God has done in you and what he is still doing in you it says now that is a revelation Jesus Christ is God the Jehovah of the Old Testament it is the Jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three gods at least not to me you can't it says but it also takes the Revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it take a it take a revelation for you to understand the truth that God is one the Lord our God is one Moses said that right it said to take a revelation to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that Jehovah the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he goes on and makes this statement it says I admit it takes a revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the godhead these days when we are in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture he says but the prevailing overcoming Church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us it says however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism now this is one he said you don't even need God to reveal this to you man it's not even one to pray over you know I don't want to uh uh uh make it so simple but like you know I I you know how some people try to be so spiritual they I mean they just they just you know the the Lord lead me to do this the Lord lead me to the Lord ain't LED you to do all that and God ain't talking as much as you say he talking anyway the Lord this the Lord did they put they blame everything on the Lord the Lord told me to leave this job and go to what job you still got to work right because the Bible also say a man don't work right we got to keep it in the word the Lord this the Lord the Lord the Lord I mean everybody and then they get so Spirit today they go to they go to Walmart and then they're praying on the toothpaste out Papa which toothpaste should I buy don't do don't don't don't waste prayer like that with God don't waste God time get the one that's on sale don't waste God's time praise the Lord amen but you know but people try to be so spiritual and when it comes to what about baptism you ain't even got to be spiritual right brother random say you don't even you don't even need a revelation on this it's just so plain right there in the scripture I want to just deal with it just for a few minutes amen here it says this you don't need a revelation on water baptism it is right there staring you in the face would it be possible for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the Lord to baptize in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and then find them in willful disobedience now let me just you know just I'm I'm a I'm gonna jump in and out of that quote let's go to Matthew 28 real quick and we'll read what our brother Brandon's referring to here Matthew 28 verse 18. amen through 20. now Jesus is uh risen from the dead and here at this moment he is uh telling the uh the disciples giving him some Commandments here you know he they have a they have something that they need to do oh my oh my mama hallelujah amen he gives them a commandment here he says uh uh Jesus came and spanking him saying all power was given to me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost so here Jesus gives them a man direct commandment Hallelujah baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost verse 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you and Lord I'm with you always even until the end of the world Amen Jesus gives him very specific instructions but ten days later we find the day of Pentecost occurring Acts chapter 2 verse 38 through 41. Jesus say baptize in the name of the father and of the Sun and of the Holy Ghost but 10 days late on the day of Pentecost verse 38 and Acts 2 then Peter said unto them repent glory and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are forth even as men as the Lord Our God shall call I like this verse 47 with many other words that he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand Souls now let's go back to the quote brother Brandon was saying it's no way that the disciples would have got this wrong it's no way Jesus telling him baptize the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and then they say baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no way he would have got that wrong what was being said what was being said they caught the revelation of what was being said the church has confused us over the years but said there comes a time where God sends the Revelation back where people can catch it and understand who is the father who is the son who is the Holy Ghost the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ when you see me you've seen the father they called the Revelation this is why they told everybody to be baptized away and when you look in the book of Acts everybody was being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can't find one place in scripture where somebody was baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost it's not there you got to catch a revelation of what Jesus was saying look at it the prophet says and I and I wanna I wanna I'm I'm I'm coming home here I got something to show you amen I got something to show you look at this this quote I want to finish it just real quick would it be possible for one minute for the apostles to be led astray from a direct command of the lord lord to baptize the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost and then find them in willful Disobedience they knew what the name was and there is not one place in scripture where they baptize any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ common sense we'll tell you that the book of Acts is the church in action and if they baptize that way in the book of Acts then that's the way to baptize now if you think that is strong if you think that is strong what do you think it is anyone who was not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus had to be baptized over again now I want to say that I want to make sure you're not just reading the quote I want you to become the quote if you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you've been baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost you need to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there's nobody in the Bible that's ever been baptized that way and I know the church taking them down every week in the name of father son or Holy Ghost without an understanding that the name of the Father the name of the son and the name of the Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ if you want to receive the Holy Ghost you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you want to go to heaven you got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you can't stick or say what God understand no God understand that he told you the truth and now you got to do something with the truth that you've heard Paul told him that to be re-baptized and we'll pick it up here in Acts 19. I'm just giving you a description then I want to show you something I'm coming I'm actually closing right now I'm closing I don't get scared I'm closing I'm closing I I see I I I got my next part is God is in his man but I I had to stop here today I wanted to stop right here I want to close right and I want to make sure it's clear if you have not been baptized according to Acts chapter 2 38. you need to be baptized that way amen even in the Bible Paul had to tell them that they had to be re-baptized here in Acts 19 we found out what Paul told him now had you been a part of Paul's Church would you have listened to what Paul said let me tell you something if you won't get re-baptized today you wouldn't have did it back then Acts 19 look at it verse 1. and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus it means a little something different for me today because I just left Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much asked her whether that be any Holy Ghost and he said to them unto what then were you baptized see they was baptized wrong that's why they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet right it says he sent them to wealth then where are you baptized now let me let me also say this now you know you can you can actually receive the Holy Ghost without being baptized hello somebody it happened in uh in Acts chapter 10 Cornelius house right they had the Holy Ghost without even being baptized but when you do got the Holy Ghost it'll take you to the water to get baptized come on chirps right he say say say this now it says until then what were you baptized they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they heard the words they felt the conviction the Bible says they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus they were re-baptized now John had a really good baptism John was a prophet and these people heard the word of the prophet he was followed but it wasn't enough God had went further than John John was baptizing unto repentance but not as someone that can forgive you for your sins not only forgive you but cleanse you from it and give you give you give you his spirit so you don't have to go back into that sin no more oh I love this I love this verse 6 says and when Paul laid his hands upon him the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied please give me amen the slides there Amen in that PowerPoint I love this because the the Bible says that Paul was passing through the coast of Ephesus it was in the emphasis that they they had a problem and they had to be re-baptized well this uh picture that you're looking at is a a picture of a a baptismal area a man in Ephesus in this uh this particular building is actually a building where they call it Saint John's Basilica because it's the place where John the Revelator was buried and these are some of the ruins of uh of this building that they have there and uh and the way that baptism happens is uh you know you start out here you can see this wall right here and the baptism areas inside but on this wall is what they call the preparation area you had to kind of prepare yourself amen before you would go in to be baptized they had three areas they had the preparation they had the baptism area and then they had an area for you to pray in after he got baptized so you know a convert once they heard the word let's say Paul would preach to them the word and and their their hearts would be convicted and these are people being re-baptized that you know what I I heard the word I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they would come from the preparation area then they would go into the baptismal area I think the next picture there please they would come into this baptism there go back just a little bit for me seeing this baptism area there's in the center here steps going down into the water and steps coming out the water then you have these two sides over here now now for them they got this holy one that's what this little small thing is but there's two sides uh the the the the guy there his name was Sammy says I want um I want I want y'all to come he says I want I want it I I think the the uh the term that he used was righteous men he says I need two righteous men to stand here and here two righteous men not just anybody but they got to be righteous standing there in this place so on the next slide you'll see that me and my my son-in-law have to stand here Amen in this little spot as Sam is coming in to be baptized and he's just going through the um uh uh the procedure with us and he's telling us how how this happened say he says now what it is that I just need y'all to hold my hand and it says uh you got to hold my hand because I I'm what I'm supposed to do is I'm being baptized I gotta walk down these steps into the awareness of when I walk in I gotta immerse myself just everything go down in that water everything cover everything everything like all your sins being covered and and and he said he said I just need you to hold me as I'm as I'm as I'm as I'm walking in he said now now we actually didn't actually do the Bachelor because nowadays we take people we dump them in the water and nothing wrong with that nothing wrong but back there in this in this time the the one that was coming to be baptized they had to be fully committed to the process so they actually had to walk into the water themselves and they had to just they had to just I mean empty everything out go into that water lower their head and be fully immersed in the water before they come out oh my my my I mean it showed that the conviction that they had right uh so so here here is they they walk through a man uh Sam Sam go to the next the next slide Sam told us the purpose but but for us holding his hands the purpose that we had to hold his hands when in that last that last picture it says because when I when I go and I and I get baptized everything in Hallelujah see the reason gotta hold my hands is because you gotta stop me from looking back he says because if I look back then the baptism didn't take place he said he said say so you got to make sure that when I when I come in and I dip myself that I keep walking out but don't let me look back hallelujah amen and I just believe amen there's been many that have maybe I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but somewhere along the road you don't start looking back and maybe you're at a point now where you need to rededicate your life to God do you need to recommit yourself to God Don't Look Back look forward he says hold my hands righteous men hold my hands and don't let me look back don't let me turn back don't let me go back God has done something in my heart I want to go forward from this point amen I don't want to go back to where I came from Hallelujah the one that was being baptized they had to make a commitment then I'm I'm laying it all down in the water and this is what baptism really represents it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's the old you coming into the water but it's the new you coming out just as Jesus was raised from the dead baptism is is symbolic of a resurrection it's the old person going into that watery grave but it's a new creation coming out repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins the Bible say you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I love this the promise is unto you and to your children see this is this is this is this is another another part that I like about this mamas and daddies if y'all know y'all went through this process and you didn't look back you're still moving forward there's a promise hanging over you I know your child is all messed up I know your child going through all kinds of stuff but when you go through this process there's a promise hanging over you the promises to you and your children those that are far off as merely as the Lord Our God shall call when you go through this process no no no no no no looking back and and see when you leave when you leave the baptism area the one thing now the next place they take you to is a room for prayer and you just sit there in that prayer room and I can just imagine many people going into this church and going into that prayer room and that's where God probably met him with the Holy Ghost brother Brandon would do it this way when when he when he baptized people in the name of Lord Jesus Christ immediately after they come up he have a word of prayer for him right there expecting God to fill him with the Holy Ghost he says he says when you come when you come like this determine under conviction believing that the word of God Is Right that God is in his word that it was God that spoke to you through his word when you come like that it says God is obligated God is obligated just be with the Holy Ghost and let me tell you something you ain't gonna be the first one to make God a liar but you got to make sure that you're coming fully committed not somebody encouraging you I know you come ready to Lord I'm ready to give it all up I'm ready to let it all go and I'm ready to walk in this newness of life I'm Not Looking Back I think brother Jerry told us that on on Wednesday nights about Lot's wife how she looked back we don't want to be like Lot's wife I'm Not Looking Back you know what caused Lot's wife to look back brother Brandon actually told us he said her grandkids he said her grandkids caused her to look back now you might ask the question well how did she have grandkids a young little fella little fella I was at brother Nathan Bryant church and I was teaching on uh a lot and um little fella said well I asked a question well what to me why do you think she looked back a little little say her grand her grandkids I see where'd you get that from you say you say brother Brandon said let's see what grandkids let's say when I read my Bible it said that Lott had two daughters and and the daughters um were uh were the ones that came out and those daughters was married now they was married praise God they had husbands but didn't have no children I don't know what the problem was but they they and and them boys had a homosexual Spirit but still married to his daughters all right that's the Bible but when you when I I that's all we was taught but when you go back and really read the scripture in Genesis 19 actually put me up gym since 1912. pull me up there because brother Brandon said that they uh that was grandkids but where the grandkids come from how would a prophet be able to tell us that Genesis 19 I believe is verse 12. the angel come down there to try to get lot out and tell him that don't don't look back don't look back when you leave here you go Full Speed Ahead don't look back but look at what the the angel said says and the men said in the lot has thou hear any besides son-in-law when I read that one I said that young man was right on he said exactly what the prophet said and thy Sons we heard about the daughters coming out but what happened to the sons and their families don't look back don't let your family cause you to look back hold to the promise word of God that said Lord if I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ keep that scripture there I'm not finished with it if I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you said the promised unto me and to my children those that are for office Minister Lord of God means the Lord my God to call imma take that seed that God gave me and I'm gonna just start giving God praise for it being manifest in my life because God can't lie God is in his word the men said in a lot has thou hear any besides son-in-law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thy has in the city bring them out of this place Church Don't Look Back give everything you got to following God and I just I had to pause I want to make sure it's clear I don't want us to shout over it I want to jump over it if you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ make your way to the water quickly you don't need a revelation to understand that you just need to be obedient pool is always ready for you to be baptized here's the way you come repent don't just don't don't don't come in to the water a dry sinner and then leave the water a wet sinner repent be Godly sorry for all that you've done wrong repair sometimes people get baptized just to please the pastor you ain't pleasing me you ain't pleasing me you ain't doing nothing for me you ain't that that is not for me do it for God be sincere about what you're doing I I I've even heard of people couldn't even find nobody to baptize and they baptized theyself they went down in the water theyself I couldn't find nobody to baptize me I'm gonna tell you another thing about baptism you don't even have to wait for the pastor to baptize you another believer can get another Minister from the church they can I've seen fathers baptize their own children amen praise the Lord I just want to make sure I just put as much emphasis on that today as I can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift for the Holy Ghost the promise is unto you your children those that are froth as many is the Lord our God to call God is in his word let's pray father your word is going forth you knew every heart that would be here today you know what word needed to be spoken fathers we heard here that scripture is given by inspiration all scripture it's profitable for Doctrine it's profitable for reproof for conviction it's profitable for for correction to instruct Us in righteousness now that it has been given let it bring forth there's any Lord that is within the sound of our voice and have not repented they have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray Lord that this would be the day that they would come to repentance they would come to a decision that I want to be baptized the right way even if I've been baptized before it was wrong I want to I wanted to be done the right way like the the people in the book of Acts 19 did the spirit of conviction hit every heart God may we be determined when we leave this place that we're not going backwards we're not looking back but we're going for it and we trusting Lord that you will lead us and you would guide us and you would take us forward let the spirit complete the work that has begun father's in Jesus name that I pray amen amen there's any that has heard the word of the Lord today and conviction is come to you and you want to respond to that we're here a man to pray with you and we invite you amen if you want to be baptized you let us know and we will make arrangements to get you baptized as soon as possible don't let it go in one ear and out the other but let it
