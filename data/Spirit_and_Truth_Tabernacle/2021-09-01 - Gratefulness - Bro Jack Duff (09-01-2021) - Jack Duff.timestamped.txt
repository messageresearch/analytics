[4:20] amen
[4:21] amen
[4:24] praise the lord
[4:25] amen if you just get your bibles i'm
[4:27] going to read a scripture and while
[4:28] you're doing that
[4:31] just a couple of things that i just need
[4:33] to make mention of
[4:35] um
[4:36] we are certainly like happy that the
[4:39] lord opened this door for us to be here
[4:40] and fellowship and those that are
[4:42] joining us online
[4:43] we've been
[4:45] disconnected for a couple weeks but we
[4:46] are in a new location
[4:48] uh having our services and uh just
[4:51] something that the lord has done for
[4:53] this season it's a temporary location
[4:55] amen till we get to our permanent
[4:58] location that god has promised us so
[5:01] we're happy for this uh but uh just want
[5:03] to make mention
[5:04] for our mothers a man uh that
[5:08] with with the children this room right
[5:10] over here with this window is gonna be
[5:13] our nursery amen for our mothers so it's
[5:16] like when they designed
[5:18] this
[5:19] they had
[5:20] us in mind
[5:22] right so so the mothers we got a nursery
[5:24] is right over here so if you if you're
[5:26] sitting on this side it's much easier to
[5:27] get in and out of there but if you're
[5:29] sitting on this side just go out that
[5:31] door and back around to get to the
[5:32] nursery and man that way uh we won't
[5:35] have anybody just walking right in front
[5:36] here the uh other thing is for those
[5:40] that the restroom is outside just go out
[5:43] the hall and just on the other side of
[5:45] this wall there's a men's restroom and a
[5:48] women's restroom over there
[5:51] and uh uh so that's where you go to do
[5:54] that and uh i think
[5:56] uh oh the offering box is there for
[5:59] those that um want to give there and we
[6:02] still have the online amen giving and
[6:05] and we just thank god for that so i
[6:07] think that's all i need to
[6:12] okay
[6:13] all right
[6:14] um wishing sister sister brown a happy
[6:17] birthday on yesterday
[6:19] god bless you
[6:21] thank god for for blessing her with
[6:23] another year how we really appreciate
[6:25] our precious sister
[6:26] amen and just a couple other things here
[6:30] um our morning prayer service has
[6:33] changed we no longer do
[6:35] are able to do the seven o'clock service
[6:37] right now but we will have this space
[6:39] available at 9 00 am so if you desire to
[6:42] come for prayer it will be open on
[6:43] sunday morning from 9 a.m to 10 a.m and
[6:46] then our regular sunday morning services
[6:48] start at 10 30 a.m uh we'll continue to
[6:50] stream through twitter and facebook and
[6:53] now this week we do have our uh tape
[6:56] service and that's done in the in your
[6:59] home uh we'll be listening to the
[7:01] message faith without works is dead
[7:05] amen and and that's 53 905. uh if you
[7:08] want to take a picture of that later on
[7:10] just so you'll have that information um
[7:12] uh for yourself that'd be great and um
[7:16] we have
[7:18] unfortunately we have time limits
[7:21] while we're here
[7:22] and
[7:24] but i know that um
[7:26] this is like i said it's temporary and
[7:28] so i won't speak too long tonight
[7:30] because we have a couple of things we
[7:32] have to get uh break down and all that
[7:35] and and have service and break down
[7:37] before we actually leave so um but we'll
[7:39] do the best we can and this will be our
[7:41] first little run and we'll see how
[7:43] things go amen but it's i'm glad to see
[7:46] y'all amen i'm glad to see all of you
[7:48] all it's so good to be in the house of
[7:50] the lord so
[7:51] i i just want to read from
[7:53] luke 17
[7:55] luke 17.
[7:57] amen
[8:02] this is just
[8:04] um
[8:06] a scripture that i typically
[8:10] go back to
[8:12] when
[8:13] i guess there are certain milestones
[8:15] that that happen in in life
[8:18] at least ministry and things like that
[8:20] and
[8:21] um i just took some time just to do a
[8:23] little reflecting
[8:25] a man and and i just want to go back to
[8:28] this scripture i want to uh just speak
[8:31] tonight on the title gratefulness
[8:34] amen gratefulness
[8:36] uh so here in
[8:38] luke 17 verse 11 it says and it came to
[8:42] pass as he went to jerusalem
[8:45] that
[8:46] he passed through the midst of samaria
[8:48] and galilee and as he entered into a
[8:50] certain village there met him ten men
[8:53] that were lepers
[8:54] which stood afar off
[8:56] and they lifted up their voices and said
[8:58] jesus master have mercy on us
[9:01] and when he saw them he said unto them
[9:03] go show yourselves unto the priests and
[9:06] it came to pass that as they went
[9:09] they were cleansed
[9:11] and one of them when he saw that he was
[9:14] healed
[9:15] turned back and with a loud voice
[9:19] glorified god
[9:21] uh and fell down on his face at his feet
[9:24] giving him thanks and he was
[9:27] a samaritan
[9:29] and jesus answering said were there not
[9:31] ten cleansed
[9:33] but where are the nine
[9:36] they are not found that return to give
[9:38] glory to god save
[9:40] this stranger and they said unto him
[9:42] arise go thy way
[9:45] thy faith have made thee whole amen the
[9:49] lord had a blessing to the reading of
[9:50] his word you can be seated
[9:53] amen and
[9:54] um
[9:56] like i said i just wanted to
[9:58] um speak on the subject of of
[10:01] gratefulness amen gratefulness
[10:04] and um
[10:06] just uh um
[10:13] to start here we are
[10:15] we're here
[10:17] on the next phase of our journey
[10:21] amen on the next phase this is
[10:24] uh
[10:24] not the ending phase just the next phase
[10:27] and uh you know and as i was approaching
[10:30] you know this first service i know it'd
[10:32] be september first would be our
[10:33] wednesday night service and typically i
[10:36] do the teaching on wednesday night but
[10:38] um i was just feeling in my spirit uh
[10:41] let i wanted to speak this first service
[10:44] rather than just you know do our
[10:46] our normal bible bible study i just
[10:48] wanted to speak here
[10:50] and um
[10:53] i was
[10:54] thinking on this and i found it
[10:57] to be very very interesting i will use
[11:01] the word providential
[11:02] that god had a studying in the in the
[11:05] book of ephesians
[11:08] amen and and we kind of got to the
[11:10] halfway point in ephesians
[11:12] and we we our study stopped you know
[11:16] not only were we teaching in ephesians
[11:18] but uh the lord had us preaching on the
[11:22] seven junctions
[11:23] amen and i think that is
[11:26] providential a man as the tender hand of
[11:29] jehovah has moved us to this location i
[11:32] think it was i think it was god uh i
[11:34] want to just maybe read a little quote
[11:37] here and and i want to also just mention
[11:39] as
[11:40] i say this a lot of things have changed
[11:42] so even as we do the quotes you'll see a
[11:44] different uh
[11:45] system that we're using uh than what we
[11:47] had before and uh but i think it's gonna
[11:50] be it's gonna be good i'm glad that
[11:51] we're kind of moving in this direction
[11:53] um when i was in
[11:55] uh alaska they were using this system
[11:58] and i said i like that i like what
[11:59] they're doing so i'm glad that we're
[12:00] able to implement this too so uh just
[12:02] bear with us we're just doing things a
[12:04] little different but but i wanna just
[12:05] say uh i'm gonna read a quote from the
[12:08] message to god who is rich in mercy
[12:10] and um just want you to think about this
[12:13] because again here we were in the midst
[12:15] of in the middle of the book of
[12:17] ephesians teaching and we're also at the
[12:20] end of the preaching of the series of
[12:22] the seven junctions uh and god at that
[12:25] time allowed us to transition amen i
[12:28] think there's there's something to all
[12:30] of this so uh here in this um
[12:33] uh uh the message to god who is rich and
[12:35] mercy the prophet says now if many of
[12:37] you
[12:39] like to just mark down scriptures that a
[12:41] minister reads
[12:43] and i would like for you to tonight if
[12:46] you would turn
[12:48] to ephesians
[12:50] and he says and i was speaking last
[12:52] sunday on the ephesians how that the
[12:55] book of joshua was the ephesians of the
[12:59] old testament and how it was a book of
[13:02] redemption now this is important to me
[13:04] because he's saying the book of joshua
[13:07] was the ephesians of the old testament
[13:09] and how it was a book of redemption okay
[13:13] and when we when we go back and we look
[13:14] at the book of joshua uh what happens in
[13:17] joshua is that the people uh not only
[13:20] have come into the promised land but now
[13:24] they are dividing up into their
[13:27] inheritance amen which is in the land
[13:30] and and i find that i think that's
[13:32] that's uh to me very
[13:34] special especially during this time
[13:36] because um i think that we're gonna find
[13:40] as we're going through this season that
[13:42] different people are gonna rise up doing
[13:44] different things uh and you're gonna
[13:47] start seeing their gifting coming out
[13:50] if i can put it that way right you're
[13:52] gonna start noticing some of the gifts
[13:54] but i'm gonna tell you something it's
[13:56] only when we get under pressure that the
[13:58] real lust comes out
[14:00] right i mean it's only when you know
[14:03] when when the pressure is there that's
[14:04] when you start seeing people step up and
[14:06] and step into position and things like
[14:09] that so it's i think it's very
[14:11] providential that here we studying on
[14:13] ephesians ephesians is a type of joshua
[14:16] and joshua was a time where it was
[14:18] placed in the promised land here it'll
[14:20] be a spiritual promised land that we're
[14:22] placed in so i'm looking forward to
[14:24] seeing what god's going to do in this
[14:26] season
[14:27] the the quote goes on says and
[14:28] redemption has two different parts
[14:32] oh hallelujah
[14:33] come out of
[14:35] and entering into
[14:37] hallelujah amen you got to come out of
[14:41] in order to enter into first you have to
[14:43] come out some people wants to bring the
[14:45] world in with them but you got to come
[14:48] out of the world to enter into christ
[14:50] you have to come out of unbelief to
[14:52] enter into faith there cannot be one
[14:55] thing in your way to really have genuine
[14:57] faith you must absolutely leave
[15:00] everything that's contrary to the word
[15:03] of god behind to enter into faith
[15:06] and i believe amen i know brother
[15:08] branham is using this as a type of
[15:10] people coming out of the world but in
[15:12] our transition it took a step of faith
[15:15] amen to say no we're not going to do
[15:17] that
[15:18] no we're not going to pay that that is
[15:20] not the vision that god gave us and it
[15:23] took a step of faith to just just uproot
[15:26] and leave like that it's much easier
[15:28] just to say well you know we ain't got
[15:29] nowhere else to go but god made a way
[15:32] right god made a way yeah we do have
[15:34] somewhere to go
[15:36] hallelujah amen but we have to be able
[15:39] to come out in order to go in
[15:42] and in the midst of coming out to go in
[15:44] we're going to see how god is placing
[15:47] the different people in their positions
[15:51] hallelujah amen and that was the book of
[15:54] ephesians of the old testament joshua
[15:56] where moses represented the law
[15:59] could not save no one but grace could
[16:01] and here joshua's the same word like
[16:03] jesus jehovah's savior says and now
[16:06] when we find that we have to come to
[16:08] another ephesians another episode now
[16:10] where that in our intellectual
[16:12] denomination so forth and all of our
[16:14] educational programs has come to us
[16:16] jordan then we must have an ephesians
[16:18] again we must have an exodus to come out
[16:22] and to go into
[16:24] for the rapture so we thank god for that
[16:26] now uh in one statement he says
[16:28] ephesians parallels the book of joshua
[16:31] uh you see i just read the book of
[16:33] joshua's ephesians of the old testament
[16:35] and how it was a book of redemption and
[16:37] so i thought about you know since we
[16:39] were in the book of ephesians doing our
[16:41] study and we're still there i wanted to
[16:43] go back and just look at a couple
[16:45] scriptures amen uh from
[16:48] the book of ephesians that that relate
[16:50] to redemption let's pull up ephesians 1
[16:53] verse 6 through 7. amen ephesians 1
[16:56] verse 6 through 7
[16:58] praise the lord
[16:59] it says to the praise of the glory of
[17:02] his grace wherein he hath made us
[17:05] accepted
[17:06] uh in the beloved in whom we have
[17:09] redemption through his blood
[17:11] amen the forgiveness of sins according
[17:14] to the riches of his grace amen amen in
[17:18] whom we have redemption through his
[17:20] blood uh the forgiveness of sins
[17:22] according to the riches of his grace
[17:24] also we're skipping down to verse 13 and
[17:26] 14 in the same chapter says in whom he
[17:30] also trusted that after that you heard
[17:33] the word of truth the gospel of your
[17:35] salvation and whom also after that you
[17:37] believe you were sealed with that holy
[17:39] spirit of promise
[17:41] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[17:44] until the redemption of the purchased
[17:46] possession unto the praise of his glory
[17:50] amen also in ephesians chapter 4 verse
[17:53] 29 through 32 we look he told us that
[17:57] the book of ephesians of amen the book
[18:00] of joshua was ephesians of the old
[18:02] testament and it was a book of
[18:03] redemption so we're looking at these
[18:05] scriptures that are related to
[18:06] redemption in the book of ephesians
[18:08] ephesians 4 verse 29 let no corrupt
[18:12] communication proceed out of your mouth
[18:16] but that which is good to the use of the
[18:19] edifying that it may minister grace unto
[18:22] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[18:25] spirit of god whereby ye are sealed
[18:28] until the day of redemption let all
[18:32] bitterness
[18:33] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[18:37] speak and be put away from you with all
[18:39] malice amen verse 32 says and be ye kind
[18:43] one to another
[18:45] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[18:48] as god for christ's sake hath forgiven
[18:50] you if there ever was a time for the
[18:54] church to be kind to one another amen to
[18:57] be tenderhearted with one another we all
[19:01] going through transition and change
[19:02] ain't easy for everybody right so so we
[19:05] have to learn to just be kind and
[19:08] sometimes you know you have to just go
[19:10] uh go the extra mile to be kind
[19:13] praise the lord somebody amen sometimes
[19:15] you're gonna want to say something but
[19:17] you got to check yourself
[19:20] right you're gonna have to check
[19:22] yourself and say no i ain't gonna say
[19:23] that right i'm not i'm not gon i'm not i
[19:26] thought it but i ain't gonna say it
[19:27] you're gonna have to sometimes you go
[19:29] you're gonna wanna a man give a piece of
[19:31] your mind but keep a piece of your mind
[19:34] because if you keep giving out a piece
[19:36] of your mind you ain't gonna have no
[19:37] more mind
[19:38] right so keep a peace of your mind
[19:40] hallelujah glory to god but if there's
[19:42] ever time for for
[19:45] spirit and truth tabernacle to be kind
[19:47] and amen and tender-hearted forgiving
[19:50] one another even as god for christ's
[19:52] sake has given up for giving us
[19:54] forgiving you this is that time right
[19:57] now
[19:57] we want to practice this
[20:00] hallelujah hallelujah amen i was just
[20:03] you know just thinking on that and like
[20:05] i said i believe it's very providential
[20:07] that we're in
[20:09] the book of ephesians teaching on
[20:10] wednesday nights and then also coming to
[20:12] the end of the seven junctions and then
[20:14] god would allow
[20:16] this junction to take place
[20:19] how we thank god for it and as i was
[20:21] just
[20:23] reflecting
[20:24] praise the lord
[20:26] um
[20:27] thought about you know us coming here to
[20:29] this middle school
[20:31] and um
[20:32] i said okay that's you know a little
[20:34] different and there's a couple couple
[20:36] things that i need to say that when i
[20:38] first started out in ministry one of the
[20:41] things that i actually was not wanting
[20:43] to do
[20:44] is go to a school
[20:46] that was one of the things i didn't want
[20:48] to do now i i when i was with brother
[20:50] wesko in the early days we went to the
[20:52] school i used to have to be the guy to
[20:53] go and meet the janitor
[20:55] as i'm talking about as a teenager meet
[20:57] the janitor just to watch over the place
[20:59] until the church came
[21:01] and and but i remember us breaking down
[21:03] and setting up and breaking down and
[21:05] said i said lord i don't want to do to
[21:06] break down and set up i
[21:08] that's just not that's not that ain't
[21:10] what i want to do but god it's god is a
[21:12] good god
[21:13] right and uh and and when we were
[21:16] um
[21:19] fewer in number god honored that
[21:22] but now that we have more help
[21:25] we can handle it
[21:28] you understand we can handle it and and
[21:30] there are some things that i want to say
[21:31] i'm grateful for tonight
[21:33] right i i
[21:34] watched a lot of things that just even
[21:36] during this process and and i'll get to
[21:38] that in a little bit just bear with me
[21:39] but but i'm grateful for what i've been
[21:41] seeing and what i know god is getting
[21:44] ready to do i believe god is
[21:46] positionally placing us getting us ready
[21:49] for
[21:50] our church
[21:52] but we got to have people in place
[21:55] amen already anointed and doing the job
[21:58] not not waiting to do the job but
[22:00] anointed and doing the job and people
[22:02] can recognize those gifts are just
[22:04] flowing

[26:15] of the kindness or benefits received
[26:19] it's to be thankful
[26:21] um amen is to express or actuate it by
[26:25] gratitude and and i was just kind of
[26:28] thinking on a little something that
[26:29] happened to me uh some years ago
[26:33] i was um
[26:34] reading a newspaper in my car one
[26:36] morning on the way to work i was just
[26:38] looking down at the newspaper just kind
[26:40] of reading a little bit we're stopped at
[26:41] a light and i'm just reading the paper
[26:43] but somehow i let my foot
[26:46] off the the gas i mean off the brake a
[26:48] little bit and that my car just ran
[26:50] right into this other lady car i said i
[26:53] can't believe i just hit this lady like
[26:54] this so you know we had to stop and she
[26:57] got out and she looked at her car she
[26:59] said you know let me get your number and
[27:00] and um and and i'll take it to my
[27:03] mechanic and i'll just let him take a
[27:04] look at it and you know if everything
[27:06] good you know you want you won't owe me
[27:08] anything it'll be all right i said okay
[27:10] well here's my number and and i didn't
[27:12] hear from her for a little bit so i
[27:14] reached out to him saying you know is
[27:15] everything all right you know uh
[27:17] um you know did you uh you know did you
[27:19] have to get the car fixed do i owe you
[27:21] anything she said no no no everything
[27:22] was good you don't owe me anything you
[27:24] know it's it's all good so i had her
[27:27] address
[27:28] and since i had an address and i was
[27:29] grateful the lady could have told me
[27:31] something another story right and i
[27:33] would i could have been paying all kind
[27:35] of money but uh i mean she did it in
[27:37] such a way that my insurance was not
[27:39] impacted right i it didn't have to be
[27:42] reported to insurance and you know so so
[27:44] uh and then when when um when uh when
[27:47] when a mechanic looked it over and she
[27:49] said well it didn't cost me nothing i'm
[27:51] not charging you nothing so since i had
[27:53] an address i decided to send a vase of
[27:55] roses and a letter a personal letter of
[27:58] thanks just to tell the lady thank you
[28:00] right i was expressing my gratitude and
[28:02] what she did was actually send me back a
[28:05] note amen melded back to me
[28:07] expressing her appreciation for my
[28:09] gratefulness
[28:11] hallelujah oh hallelujah i want you to
[28:14] understand
[28:16] sometime when you show
[28:19] gratefulness
[28:20] amen it will return back to you
[28:23] oh
[28:24] hallelujah and i'm here tonight to show
[28:27] my lord and savior that i am grateful
[28:33] no i didn't want to go to a school when
[28:35] i was younger in ministry but lord i'm
[28:37] grateful
[28:38] i'm grateful that you open up a door for
[28:40] us to be able to come and have
[28:42] fellowship
[28:44] oh hallelujah i was looking at this word
[28:47] grateful from my illumina amen software
[28:51] and it says gratitude is a natural
[28:53] expression
[28:55] of thanks
[28:56] in response to blessings
[29:00] it's a natural expression of thanks in
[29:02] response to protection
[29:04] or love
[29:06] right that said in judeo-christian
[29:08] tradition gratitude
[29:10] is not a tool used
[29:13] to mimic to manipulate the will of god
[29:16] it is never coerced or fabricated in
[29:19] one's mind rather gratitude is a joyful
[29:22] commitment of one's personality to god
[29:26] now i went back in my mind as i was
[29:28] thinking on this if i recall our last
[29:31] service amen one of the songs uh that
[29:34] was being played was uh
[29:37] uh thanks
[29:38] thanks i give you thanks for all you've
[29:42] done and what what it was is a journey
[29:45] down memory lane of 13 years that god
[29:48] provided and he's still providing so we
[29:50] say thanks thanks for all you've done i
[29:54] am so blessed
[29:56] my soul is at rest
[30:00] lord i give you thanks that's how we
[30:02] left amen we left our last amen uh uh
[30:06] address giving god thanks and we entered
[30:09] into the next phase of this amen of our
[30:12] journey and we're still giving god
[30:14] thanks
[30:16] it's an attitude
[30:18] of gratitude
[30:21] glory to god
[30:22] here they made another statement in here
[30:26] um
[30:27] children of israel when they receive
[30:29] good news
[30:31] they thank god for his goodness
[30:34] and great deeds and and i and i want to
[30:36] read a scripture out of that go to first
[30:38] chronicles 16 8 through 12.
[30:41] oh my
[30:43] when they receive good news
[30:45] they thank god
[30:49] oh yes hallelujah first first chronicles
[30:53] 16
[30:54] 8-12
[30:56] my god my god
[30:59] look at what it says here
[31:03] give thanks unto the lord
[31:05] call upon his name make known as deeds
[31:08] among the people
[31:10] sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk
[31:13] ye of all his wondrous works
[31:15] glory ye
[31:17] in his holy name let the heart of them
[31:19] rejoice that seek the lord
[31:22] seek the lord and his strength seek his
[31:25] face continually and look at this verse
[31:28] here
[31:29] remember
[31:31] my god
[31:32] remember his marvelous works that he
[31:35] hath done
[31:37] his wonders and the judgments of his
[31:40] mouth sometimes we need to take a trip
[31:41] down memory lane and just remember what
[31:44] god has done
[31:46] and when you find yourself grateful for
[31:48] the things that he has done then he'll
[31:50] start doing more
[31:52] but rather than complain about anything
[31:54] let's just remember what he has done
[31:57] they said count your blessings one by
[32:00] one
[32:01] you look back and see all the things
[32:03] that god has done
[32:05] so here the children of israel they gave
[32:07] thanks to god when they received good
[32:10] news
[32:12] but it also said here in the lumina
[32:14] software when they received bad news
[32:18] they also gave thanks
[32:21] trusting that he was a just god
[32:24] can i pull up just job 1 21.
[32:28] amen
[32:30] oh hallelujah god you're worthy
[32:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah job121 see even
[32:37] in in bad times they still gave thanks
[32:40] now i'm gonna tell you i don't think
[32:42] this is a bad time
[32:45] amen i don't think it's a bad time i
[32:47] think god is in this
[32:49] right but but but even in life sometimes
[32:51] we go through good days and sometimes we
[32:53] go through bad days but but like the
[32:55] sons say i won't complain
[32:57] because my my my my good days outweigh
[33:00] my bad days
[33:02] and here in job 1 21 it says
[33:04] and this is when job got all this bad
[33:06] news coming at him and and he was sick
[33:08] sick of the death he says him naked came
[33:11] out out of my mother's womb
[33:12] and naked shall i return thither
[33:15] the lord gave
[33:17] come on somebody
[33:19] and the lord have taken away
[33:21] now i like i like that i like that
[33:23] statement the lord gave i can tell you
[33:25] right now god gave us 39 51 heavy hill
[33:29] road sweet 109. god did that himself
[33:33] and when he allowed that note to be put
[33:35] on the door on my birthday it was the
[33:37] lord taken away but notice job's
[33:40] response after the lord gave and after
[33:43] the lord took away joel's response was
[33:46] blessed
[33:48] come on somebody you got to have an
[33:51] attitude of gratitude bless that be the
[33:55] name of the lord he is still wanting to
[33:58] be praised i'm going to still give him
[34:01] glory
[34:05] i'll praise him in the good times i'll
[34:07] praise him in the bad times i'll praise
[34:10] him at all times
[34:12] let his praise continually
[34:14] be in my mouth
[34:18] david said my soul shall make her boast
[34:21] in the lord the humble shall hear the of
[34:24] him be glad
[34:25] he says oh magnify the lord with me
[34:29] and let us exalt his name together
[34:45] the lord gave
[34:47] the lord took away
[34:50] but blessed be the name of the lord
[34:53] and do and you you know the end of job's
[34:56] story
[34:57] job actually ended up with more
[35:00] on the end he got doubled for his
[35:02] trouble
[35:10] oh i i'm i'm under i'm under some real
[35:13] expectation y'all i'm telling you i'm
[35:16] under some some serious expectation i
[35:18] don't know what god gave me to do but i
[35:20] know it's about to be something powerful
[35:23] it's a mighty mighty mighty
[35:25] but i'ma have an attitude of gratitude
[35:27] all the way through
[35:30] amen let me try to finish up here
[35:34] the children of israel
[35:36] would give god praise
[35:40] anytime he they were delivered from
[35:42] their enemies
[35:45] and maybe it will take time to just read
[35:47] some of these psalms 18 17.
[35:50] anytime they were delivered from their
[35:51] enemies
[35:53] they would give god praise
[35:56] my
[35:58] psalm 18 and 17 it says this
[36:04] um
[36:07] he delivered me
[36:09] from my strong enemy and for them which
[36:13] hated me
[36:14] for they were too strong for me
[36:16] so they gave praise when they were
[36:18] delivered from their enemies
[36:20] when they were delivered from death
[36:22] they gave praise psalm 30 verse 8
[36:24] through 12.
[36:26] they they were delivered from death and
[36:28] i tell you we have been delivered from
[36:30] death
[36:32] there's there's many that i've heard
[36:34] that have
[36:36] churches that have suffered so greatly
[36:38] from this covet
[36:39] and even the new delta variant uh uh one
[36:42] church was one brothers tell them say
[36:44] they had a hundred people in the church
[36:45] that were all
[36:47] infected
[36:48] and um and and i think six or seven died
[36:51] out of that hundred
[36:53] and and and god's been good to us
[36:57] nobody's lost no lies lost you know by
[37:00] by by the grace of god
[37:03] so i'm grateful
[37:05] lord i'm grateful
[37:07] amen
[37:10] hallelujah he stayed the hand of death
[37:12] here in psalms 30 verse 8 through 12 it
[37:14] says this
[37:16] um i cried to thee o lord and unto the
[37:20] lord i made supplication what profit is
[37:22] there in my blood when i go down to the
[37:24] pit shall i shall the dust praise thee
[37:26] shall it declare thy truth
[37:28] hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord
[37:31] be thou my helper
[37:32] thou has turned for me my mourning into
[37:35] dancing
[37:36] thou has put off of my sackcloth and
[37:39] girded me with gladness
[37:41] to the end that my glory may sing praise
[37:43] to thee and not be silent
[37:46] no i'm not coming here to be silent amen
[37:49] oh lord my god i will give thanks unto
[37:51] thee
[37:52] forever
[37:54] another time they gave uh uh uh they
[37:57] were grateful to god it's when just just
[37:59] because he forgave them of their sins
[38:02] amen if you've just been forgiven you
[38:04] need to be grateful
[38:06] right that you find that in psalm 32 and
[38:09] 5
[38:11] amen they were forgiven of the sins so
[38:13] they were grateful here david says i
[38:15] acknowledge my sin unto thee
[38:17] and my iniquity have i not hid i said i
[38:20] will confess my transgressions and the
[38:21] lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of
[38:23] my sin
[38:24] salah and that's the loss just a little
[38:26] pause
[38:28] amen and meditating on what god has done
[38:32] also they they were grateful for god's
[38:35] answer to prayer psalm 28 and 6.
[38:38] amen psalm 28 and 6
[38:41] oh hallelujah blessed be the lord
[38:44] because he hath heard the voice
[38:47] of my supplications
[38:49] yeah god is god i've said it before and
[38:52] i believe god answers
[38:54] every prayer
[38:55] it's either going to be yes
[38:57] it's going to be no or it's going gonna
[38:59] be not yet
[39:00] but he answers every prayer but they
[39:02] they gave praise and they were grateful
[39:05] amen to god for answering prayers
[39:08] and also here in psalm 34
[39:11] they had they were grateful for god's
[39:13] compassions toward the afflicted
[39:15] and the oppressed and this is the
[39:17] scripture that i was just
[39:18] quoting
[39:19] and i'll start at verse 1
[39:22] it says i will bless the lord at all
[39:23] times
[39:25] his praise should continually be in my
[39:26] mouth my soul shall make her boast in
[39:28] the lord the humble shall hear their of
[39:30] and be glad
[39:31] oh magnify the lord with me and let us
[39:33] exalt his name together and i just felt
[39:35] as i was reading this i felt david kind
[39:37] of speaking to me david kind of tends to
[39:39] not not now brother jack i can i can
[39:42] praise him by myself
[39:44] i can do it by myself but i'm just
[39:46] asking magnify him with me
[39:49] hallelujah oh magnify the lord with me
[39:51] and let us exalt his name together
[39:54] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[39:55] delivered me from all my fears they
[39:58] looked them to him and were lightened
[40:00] and their faces were not ashamed
[40:02] oh hallelujah
[40:04] no my face is not a shame i i i i you
[40:08] know oh hallelujah all that that
[40:10] scripture that sister tina gave us that
[40:11] he said my people will not be made
[40:13] ashamed
[40:14] oh oh glory to god
[40:17] you know i'm gonna tell you right now
[40:19] there are many people
[40:21] many churches
[40:22] meeting in a school
[40:24] and do not have the ability to go out
[40:27] and buy a church
[40:34] they're trying to save money now
[40:37] but god had blessed us before we came
[40:39] here
[40:41] so we're not ashamed we're just waiting
[40:46] we're just waiting on the lord and and
[40:48] what we realize that he
[40:49] the bible tells me
[40:52] all things
[40:54] work together for goods
[40:56] to them who are called according to his
[40:58] purpose so so i just got i got sense
[41:01] enough to believe that if this the door
[41:03] god opened he wanted us to be here for a
[41:05] reason
[41:07] all right let me keep reading here verse
[41:09] verse five says they looked unto him and
[41:11] were lightened and her face was not
[41:12] ashamed this poor man cried and the lord
[41:14] heard him and saved him out of all his
[41:15] troubles the angel lord and campeth
[41:18] round about them that fear him and
[41:19] deliver them o taste and see that the
[41:21] lord is good
[41:23] blessed is the man that trusteth
[41:25] in him
[41:27] hallelujah oh thank you jesus
[41:31] i was um
[41:32] just you know thinking on this and they
[41:34] got one more scripture that i want to
[41:36] read
[41:37] out of first testimonies 5 18.
[41:39] so
[41:41] they said here in the illumina software
[41:42] they gave god praise
[41:45] in the good times
[41:46] they also gave god praise in the bad
[41:48] times and say paul picks it up amen in
[41:51] the new testament and it says because
[41:54] the expression of gratitude is tied so
[41:56] closely
[41:57] to the response of faith notice this the
[42:00] expression of gratitude
[42:02] is tied closely to the response of faith
[42:05] says paul encouraged believers to give
[42:07] thanks in all things
[42:10] first thessalonians 5 18
[42:14] in everything
[42:17] give thanks
[42:18] in everything
[42:21] give thanks why for this is the will of
[42:24] god you want to know what the will of
[42:25] god is
[42:26] give thanks
[42:29] this is the will of god in christ jesus
[42:33] concerning
[42:34] you
[42:35] i thought about these ten lepers that
[42:37] were healed
[42:38] and this is why i say every time we have
[42:40] a milestone in my life or even in the
[42:42] ministry i always tend to go back to the
[42:44] scripture
[42:45] in um luke 17 those 10 lepers that were
[42:48] healed
[42:49] and we saw you know they they were
[42:52] obedient by just going to show
[42:53] themselves to the priests and i won't
[42:55] dig too deep into all of that tonight
[42:57] i'm kind of winding up so that we can
[43:00] uh we won't go over time
[43:02] but uh but they went back and they
[43:04] here here they're on the way to be in
[43:06] obedience they're going to the uh to see
[43:09] the priests and and all of them
[43:11] recognized in the obedience
[43:13] that they all had been healed
[43:16] everybody was healed through obedience
[43:19] they were healed
[43:21] but what we find is one man that was a
[43:23] samaritan that was a part of this group
[43:25] of lepers
[43:27] um this man recognized his healing had
[43:30] taken place as he was being obedient
[43:33] right he recognized his healing and
[43:35] through that he turned around uh he left
[43:38] the other ones going to do whatever they
[43:39] was planning on doing but he turned
[43:41] around because
[43:43] brother branham said when left when you
[43:44] when you contracted leprosy the only
[43:47] person that could heal you was god
[43:49] the priest could just look on it and
[43:51] actually say either you're healed or
[43:52] you're not healed but the priest didn't
[43:54] do the healing god is the only one that
[43:56] can heal a person of leprosy right when
[43:59] moses stuck his hand in his bosom and it
[44:01] turned leopards and then he pulled it
[44:03] out and put it back in and it was it was
[44:05] clean again it showed that god was the
[44:07] only one that could actually cure
[44:09] leprosy so this man recognized that only
[44:12] god could take care of leprosy i was
[44:14] obedient to what he told me to do but as
[44:17] i was on my way this man told me what to
[44:19] do and as i was on my way i was made
[44:21] whole and i'm going back to give praise
[44:23] to the one that made it happen for me
[44:26] i'mma show my gratefulness
[44:29] and i love the way the scripture said
[44:30] the man did not come silently
[44:35] the bible say the man came with a loud
[44:37] voice can you imagine this man amen on
[44:41] on the streets glory to god i can i can
[44:44] just hear him uh coming down the corner
[44:46] thank you jesus
[44:48] glory to your name
[44:50] i mean can you imagine hallelujah
[44:54] jesus you be praised
[44:58] i mean he got everybody's attention the
[45:00] way that he was expressing his
[45:01] gratefulness
[45:04] hallelujah church i'll tell you i i just
[45:07] want to show
[45:08] i just want to show how grateful i am
[45:16] i thought it was just very very
[45:18] important for us to
[45:20] start
[45:22] this first service
[45:24] just just being grateful
[45:28] i had when we were head to school i had
[45:30] a devotion that i was doing with the
[45:31] students and
[45:33] a couple of statements about gratitude
[45:35] it's hard for a shallow
[45:37] it's hard for shallow whining
[45:40] to find a foothold
[45:41] in the heart of a grateful person
[45:45] it's hard for shallow whining
[45:48] to find a foothold in the heart of a
[45:49] grateful person
[45:52] there is no room
[45:54] for demanding behavior
[45:56] in the life of a grateful person
[46:02] voicing our gratitude
[46:05] humbles us
[46:06] leaving no room for pride
[46:10] expressing gratitude to god actually
[46:14] builds our faith
[46:17] expressing gratitude to god builds our
[46:19] faith and confidence in him when we
[46:21] express our gratitude to god it builds
[46:24] our faith and our confidence in him
[46:26] making doubt take a backseat
[46:32] i just i want you to think about this
[46:34] expressing gratitude to god builds our
[46:37] faith and confidence in him making doubt
[46:39] take a back seat and again i'm
[46:41] expressing gratitude
[46:43] on multiple fronts i i i want to
[46:45] remember the things he's already done
[46:48] because as i expressed gratitude on what
[46:50] he's already done that builds my faith
[46:52] to say you know if he done it before he
[46:54] can do it again
[46:57] it put out it put doubt in the back seat
[47:02] gratitude guards us
[47:04] from what would destroy us
[47:09] in this last little statement
[47:11] the same lips
[47:14] that off off of thanksgiving
[47:17] are less likely to complain
[47:19] bling
[47:20] or
[47:22] gossip the same lips that offer
[47:26] thanksgiving
[47:27] are less likely to complain
[47:30] blame
[47:31] or gossip
[47:34] and if there's ever time for us to
[47:37] be showing love to one another being
[47:38] tenderhearted
[47:40] it's that time right now
[47:43] and the way that we do that is just by
[47:45] just being grateful
[47:47] sometimes it's good for you just to you
[47:49] know tell your brother sister i'm just
[47:51] i'm just happy you here i get
[47:53] i get i get i get
[47:56] i get a blessing just seeing you in

[57:43] expectation that one day they will be
[57:45] able to come and fellowship with us
[57:48] god i just appreciate you
[57:51] pray lord your blessings upon each and
[57:53] every one
[57:55] lord even as we leave this place tonight
[57:57] but not your presence bless thee
[58:00] the custodians
[58:02] bless the principal the teachers the
[58:06] students gotta let this be a school that
[58:09] the virus will not have an outbreak here
[58:13] god let it be a place where violence
[58:15] would not
[58:16] outbreak here god let your angels watch
[58:19] over this place
[58:21] [Music]
[58:24] the angel of the lord encampeth round
[58:26] about them that fear
[58:27] [Music]
[58:28] and deliver them from all their troubles
[58:33] we apply that scripture to this location
[58:37] god we just give you praise we give you
[58:38] honor we give you glory
[58:41] it's in jesus name
[58:43] we pray
[58:44] amen
[58:46] other thing that we found out when we
[58:48] came here
[58:50] [Music]
[58:51] the custodians that told us when we came
[58:53] in
[58:54] it says
[58:56] no one has used this room for the last
[58:57] year and a half
[59:00] and i said what we say once again no
[59:02] one's used this room for the last year
[59:04] and a half they actually look and still
[59:05] looking trying to find a teacher that
[59:07] can hire to do you know this course
[59:09] program but uh but
[59:13] with no one using it it actually gave us
[59:16] the ability to be able to kind of come
[59:18] in and set up and leave most of the
[59:19] things in place
[59:21] so we don't have to do a lot of
[59:23] breakdown instead of
[59:25] praise the lord
[59:31] so until they tell us
[59:34] we're going to leave a pulpit here
[59:38] take some you know important equipment
[59:39] and things like that our cameras we're
[59:41] not going to leave out but uh but but
[59:43] you know some of the things we're just
[59:44] going to leave right in place
[59:46] and one of the blessings that the lord
[59:48] has given us
[59:49] through this journey two things we we
[59:51] got a
[59:52] less expensive keyboard
[59:55] because moving that that really
[59:57] expensive keyboard around we didn't want
[59:59] to break it or have any any mishap so
[1:00:01] the lord blessed us we went out and
[1:00:03] bought this a man keyboard just so that
[1:00:06] we'll be ready and they have not given
[1:00:08] us the
[1:00:09] the okay to play that baby brand over
[1:00:12] there but if they give us okay we'll be
[1:00:13] playing that too uh and the other thing
[1:00:16] is that we got ourselves a a set of
[1:00:18] electric drums so we can just fold them
[1:00:20] up and unfold them on sunday mornings
[1:00:23] make it real easy amen for us so so god
[1:00:26] is good
[1:00:27] god is good and we're we are
[1:00:30] grateful
[1:00:31] grateful
[1:00:33] grateful let's just sing this of course
[1:00:35] to this song
[1:00:36] and we'll prepare to leave
[1:00:38] say i
[1:00:40] am
[1:00:41] grateful for
[1:00:43] the things that he
[1:00:46] had done
[1:00:50] yes i'm
[1:00:52] grateful for
