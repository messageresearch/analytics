[56:02] brother Solomon still recuperating a man
[56:05] we pray God will just continue to
[56:07] strengthen him and and just bring
[56:09] healing to his body amen and but while
[56:13] he's recuperating I just figured I'd
[56:15] jump in and help out where I couldn't
[56:17] praise the Lord
[56:19] so it's not a one-man band or one-man
[56:21] show but it's just getting in where you

[56:28] the goal is as you can see I like to
[56:30] have replication just about every area
[56:33] here in our ministry and so we're gonna
[56:35] be replicating on this song leader not
[56:37] you know what I would I what I I
[56:39] realized some time ago that when God
[56:45] called me to ministry they never took
[56:47] the singing away from me hey man when
[56:50] God called David a man to become king he
[56:55] was still a shepherd right he still
[56:58] understand you know the Easter
[57:00] understood these things he was still a
[57:01] musician he was still all those things
[57:03] so the God don't take away he just add
[57:06] you know get that you don't take from me
[57:09] does he just add to you a man and so you
[57:12] know I just I'm just happy about serving
[57:14] the Lord I'm gonna tell you if I could
[57:16] play an instrument y'all see me playing
[57:18] y'all see me all over the church I'll be
[57:21] singing

[57:26] done so much to me I can't do enough for
[57:29] him I take a get tied and play a guitar
[57:32] be on the drums beating I did anything I
[57:36] can do for Jesus my God if I could run
[57:39] for Jesus I'd run if I could jump for
[57:41] Jesus I would jump
[57:43] he's just been that good to me y'all I'm
[57:45] sorry hey man i'ma tell you when you
[57:47] when you fall in love with him like that
[57:49] ain't no you can't you came to enough

[57:54] Lord so we just we just thank God for
[57:56] all things but we we appreciate the Lord

[58:50] careful how to sister you know they come
[58:52] out like Martin Luther King and I want
[58:53] to sound like that but uh but the Lord
[58:57] had given me a dream man recently I was
[59:00] I was I was and I don't dream that's
[59:03] just not me I'm a very hard sleeper my
[59:07] wife will tell you faith can be
[59:09] happening all around did you hear that
[59:11] accident no you know there was shooting
[59:15] nights I didn't hear it I was I was
[59:18] knocked out and we learned through the
[59:20] message you know brother branham told us
[59:22] that you know people that sleep that way
[59:23] typically God don't deal with them in
[59:25] dreams right and so when I when anytime
[59:28] I have a little dream I always take it
[59:30] seriously
[59:31] you know and
[59:33] so you know we had a had a the Lord just
[59:36] kind of told me about having a a sunrise
[59:45] service for Easter and so we usually
[59:50] come for prayer for the first for
[59:53] service but we'll have a sunrise service
[59:55] on Easter a man and and so the Lord that
[59:59] put that in my in the dream about having
[1:00:01] the sunrise service and he told me who
[1:00:03] was supposed to speak so I said okay
[1:00:04] Lord I'm gonna be obedient so with that
[1:00:07] we already know we're gonna have a good
[1:00:08] Friday service y'all know that you know
[1:00:12] we gonna be here on Good Friday
[1:00:15] right and so I just I said well was the
[1:00:18] Lord put in my heart you know we are he
[1:00:20] had to put in my heart
[1:00:21] Good Friday that that was already there
[1:00:23] you know what I'm saying
[1:00:25] Easter was already there you'll have to
[1:00:28] be you'll need a dream back going to
[1:00:31] church on Easter you know need a dream
[1:00:38] by that you'll need a dream by Good
[1:00:40] Friday you'll need a dream by about
[1:00:42] Easter but you know the Lord Lord put in
[1:00:44] my spirit a sunrise service and I say
[1:00:46] you know what we're gonna do we'll add a
[1:00:48] Saturday service for that - we have a
[1:00:50] Friday Saturday Sunday sunrise and
[1:00:54] Sunday morning service at Easter time
[1:00:57] you know we're gonna be doing coming
[1:00:59] right out of our fast going into for
[1:01:02] services like that and we're not
[1:01:03] inviting anybody we got help right hand
[1:01:06] the church so we're gonna use the help
[1:01:07] that we got we're gonna have full
[1:01:09] services just like that coming out of a
[1:01:12] fast I want y'all expectations up god
[1:01:16] want to do something for us Amen God
[1:01:19] wanna do something so I'm letting that
[1:01:23] let everybody know about that so that'll
[1:01:25] be coming and man at Easter time we'll
[1:01:28] be announcing about the fast as we get
[1:01:30] there but it'll be 21 days before Easter
[1:01:32] we'll probably in the fast either just
[1:01:35] the day before Good Friday there will be
[1:01:37] the goal to in the fast the day before
[1:01:39] Good Friday so we'll go right into
[1:01:41] Easter a man just after 21-day fast and
[1:01:46] and that fast could be you know just a
[1:01:48] number of things we don't we know we
[1:01:49] don't limit it you know but typically
[1:01:52] what I do is what they call the Daniel
[1:01:54] Fast I still eat but I just eat certain
[1:01:56] things there others might say why well I
[1:01:59] will I'll eat whatever I want to eat but
[1:02:01] I won't eat until three o'clock you know
[1:02:03] something like that of us you know and I

[1:02:30] man or change your diet or do something
[1:02:33] amen but but I will give you more
[1:02:35] information but that'll that'll be
[1:02:36] happening that's a corporate a church
[1:02:38] why fast that will be doing they're
[1:02:41] starting in the month of April it coming
[1:02:44] out of March going into April will be
[1:02:46] starting that fast so everybody be aware
[1:02:48] and everybody be ready everybody be
[1:02:50] prepared for that is that Alright okay
[1:02:53] all right so I want to read two
[1:02:54] scriptures this morning and one from
[1:02:58] Romans 12 and the other from first
[1:02:59] Corinthians 15 and we will just present
[1:03:03] our thought here to you today Romans 12
[1:03:08] everybody standing that can't stand
[1:03:13] Romans 12 says this I this seeks you
[1:03:21] therefore by the mercies of God that ye
[1:03:28] present your bodies you know that's the
[1:03:32] least you can do is give God your body
[1:03:34] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:03:38] notice this not only present your body
[1:03:41] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:03:46] reasonable service reasonable that's
[1:03:50] give God your body a man it says and be
[1:03:54] not conformed to this world but be
[1:03:58] transformed
[1:03:59] by the renewing of your mind that you
[1:04:04] may prove what is that good and
[1:04:07] acceptable and perfect will of God a man
[1:04:12] perfect will of God all right so let's
[1:04:14] turn over here to first Corinthians 15
[1:04:33] mmm
[1:04:36] first Corinthians 15 and I'm reading
[1:04:39] from verse 50 amen and this says now
[1:04:43] this I say brethren that flesh and blood
[1:04:46] can not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:04:50] neither doth corruption inherit
[1:04:53] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[1:04:57] we shall not all we shall not all sleep
[1:05:01] that maybe not all gonna die a man a man
[1:05:05] this script try to be more precious in
[1:05:09] today than any other time we're living
[1:05:12] in a time and a day somebody not gonna
[1:05:14] die to go to heaven amen praise God
[1:05:19] somebody's gonna get in through
[1:05:21] different means than death alright but
[1:05:24] I'll show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:05:26] sleep but we shall all be changed right
[1:05:31] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:05:35] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:05:38] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:05:41] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:05:46] for this corruptible must put on
[1:05:49] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[1:05:54] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:05:56] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:05:58] mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:06:00] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:06:03] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:06:06] victory Oh death where is thy sting o
[1:06:09] grave where is thy victory the sting of
[1:06:11] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[1:06:13] the law but thanks be to God which
[1:06:16] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[1:06:18] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[1:06:21] brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable amen
[1:06:29] don't let the devil get your sidetrack
[1:06:31] Amen unmovable always abounding in the
[1:06:37] work of the Lord for as much as you know
[1:06:40] that your labor is not in vain in the
[1:06:44] Lord Amen let's have a word of Prayer
[1:06:47] over the scripture
[1:06:48] father we thank you for the opportunity
[1:06:51] to read the word of the Lord
[1:06:53] but we know takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:55] bring clarity to the things that we read
[1:06:57] speak to our hearts Lord through your
[1:07:00] word today may encourage us and
[1:07:03] strengthen us and help us in our journey
[1:07:05] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:07:08] bless you can be seated praise the Lord
[1:07:18] so we want to take for our title today
[1:07:21] we shall be changed a man we shall be
[1:07:26] changed
[1:07:26] that's not just a song that is a promise
[1:07:30] according to the scripture and I am
[1:07:33] certainly looking forward to it by the
[1:07:36] grace of God I want to take us back we
[1:07:40] came out of us the subject on talking
[1:07:43] about those three realms and you know
[1:07:46] the three realms that God deals with
[1:07:48] people in the humanistic realm the rim
[1:07:51] of visions or sometimes dreams because a
[1:07:55] dream correctly interpreted is a vision
[1:07:57] and also brother Ram said thus saith the
[1:08:00] Lord God uses those those three realms
[1:08:02] in order to speak to his people amen
[1:08:05] so I'm pulling from the sermon is this
[1:08:08] the sign of the answer and I just want
[1:08:11] to read a couple things a man from that
[1:08:13] out of it is this a sign of the answer
[1:08:15] so stay stay with me here it makes it
[1:08:18] says could you just scroll up just one
[1:08:23] paragraph there oh me just just take it
[1:08:25] up one day you go 2:43 all right it says
[1:08:28] so now let's note a few of these
[1:08:31] mysteries and if you want to write them
[1:08:33] down first I'll take what Scofield says
[1:08:36] here now he's using Scofield he's
[1:08:38] referring to matthew chapter 13 it says
[1:08:41] if you like to type some of them down if
[1:08:44] you haven't got a Scofield Bible you
[1:08:46] might read what he thinks some of the
[1:08:50] mysteries are now in the eleventh verse
[1:08:52] now this is Scofield notes brother
[1:08:53] branham has actually given you Scofield
[1:08:55] notes okay
[1:08:56] and it says and now he uses the language
[1:08:59] these are some of the things he thinks
[1:09:01] this is what school
[1:09:03] thinks if you got a Scofield Bible you
[1:09:05] can just go look look right down at the
[1:09:07] bottom of it and these are some of the
[1:09:09] notes that'll be there so I went through
[1:09:11] mine on last night just looking at all
[1:09:12] the little notes then and the scriptures
[1:09:14] and everything that Scofield was
[1:09:15] referring to but look at this he says
[1:09:17] number one the mystery of the kingdom of
[1:09:19] heaven that Scofield these are mysteries
[1:09:21] that got to come let me um oh no no no I
[1:09:25] skipped something he says now now in
[1:09:29] eleventh verse and he answered a set of
[1:09:31] them he's reading Matthew thirty 11 and
[1:09:32] he answered and said to them because
[1:09:34] it's given to you his disciples because
[1:09:36] it's given to you to know the mysteries
[1:09:39] of the kingdom of heaven but not to them
[1:09:43] but to them is not given
[1:09:45] now Scofield say that there are
[1:09:47] mysteries that the disciples are not
[1:09:50] just my I should say the current day
[1:09:52] disciples wouldn't know that the others
[1:09:54] would not know Oh
[1:09:55] stay with me there's mysteries that you
[1:09:58] wouldn't know that the others would not
[1:10:00] know there's a mystery that Abraham knew
[1:10:03] that Locke did not know you understand
[1:10:06] what I'm saying
[1:10:07] amen there's mysteries that you will
[1:10:09] know that others will not know it goes
[1:10:11] on he said and then he gave a this a
[1:10:13] scope is definition of a mystery the
[1:10:16] mystery here oh my the mysteries here is
[1:10:19] the mystery a mystery is Scripture a
[1:10:22] previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:10:27] reveal but which is a supernatural
[1:10:30] element still remains despite the
[1:10:34] revelation I like that hallelujah
[1:10:37] because as we go through some of these
[1:10:38] mysteries right what we see is as you
[1:10:41] know Scofield say this is coming well
[1:10:44] the grandmum picks up what Scofield say
[1:10:46] this is coming and he can say this is it
[1:10:50] hallelujah somebody a man and not only
[1:10:53] this is it but a supernatural for those
[1:10:57] that differ with what he said a
[1:11:00] supernatural element was there to prove
[1:11:03] that what he said was right so the
[1:11:06] supernatural skull said the supernatural
[1:11:09] element remains despite the revelation
[1:11:13] Oh glory to God amen stay with me here
[1:11:18] because that you know we watching that
[1:11:19] Scofield was looking for he didn't see
[1:11:20] it in his day but he left this you know
[1:11:22] in the Scofield Bible he left this there
[1:11:24] he says says the greater mysteries and
[1:11:27] the great mysteries are number one the
[1:11:30] mystery of the kingdom of heaven that's
[1:11:33] the one we're talking on now
[1:11:35] third Matthew 13 verse 3 250 all right
[1:11:38] and now he says now the second mystery
[1:11:40] the mystery of Israel's blindness during
[1:11:43] this eight line he's a Scofield notes
[1:11:45] Romans 11:25 with the context third
[1:11:49] mystery is the mystery of the
[1:11:50] translation of the living Saints at the
[1:11:52] end time of this apes first Corinthians
[1:11:55] 15 and also Thessalonians 4:14
[1:11:58] 2:17 now that's the one I want to focus
[1:12:00] on the day a man when I say we shall be
[1:12:03] changed
[1:12:03] that's the one we're focusing on because
[1:12:05] Scofield said we need to understand that
[1:12:07] mystery how does change gonna happen
[1:12:11] because the Bible say we shall be
[1:12:14] changed
[1:12:15] well how is this change supposed to take
[1:12:17] place don't you want to understand the
[1:12:20] mysteries alright let's go on a little
[1:12:22] further say the fourth mystery of the
[1:12:24] New Testament church as one body
[1:12:26] composed of both Jews and Gentiles
[1:12:28] Ephesians 3 1 to 11 Romans 16:25
[1:12:32] and also Ephesians 619 Colossians 4 3
[1:12:35] you go through Scofield notes he got all
[1:12:37] these things written down there the
[1:12:39] fifth mysteries of the church as the
[1:12:41] Bride of Christ Ephesians 5:28 232 amen
[1:12:46] 6 mysteries of the Living Christ same
[1:12:48] yesterday today and forever Galatians
[1:12:51] 2:20 and and now now brother Branham
[1:12:53] slipped in there Hebrews 13:8 amen it
[1:12:57] says in many places like that because of
[1:13:00] Scofield notes where he said of the six
[1:13:02] mystery was the in living Christ but
[1:13:04] brother Branham said it was a mystery of
[1:13:07] the living Christ not just in living
[1:13:09] Christ but the living Christ in his TUC
[1:13:11] Hebrews 13 and eight they're showing
[1:13:13] that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday
[1:13:16] today and forever let's go a little
[1:13:17] further say the seventh mystery is of
[1:13:20] God even Christ as the incarnate
[1:13:22] fullness of the godhead embody and who
[1:13:24] all divine wisdom he said Colossians 2
[1:13:28] and 9 first Corinthians 2:7 amen and
[1:13:30] then he says in godliness restored to
[1:13:33] man now and then he goes on says ninth
[1:13:36] mystery is the mystery of iniquity found
[1:13:37] in 2nd Thessalonians and throat so forth
[1:13:40] now when I look that you know I had to
[1:13:42] go back to the notes and I missed it
[1:13:45] oh my I missed it because he said the
[1:13:48] seventh mystery was a man a mystery of
[1:13:51] God even as Christ as it in currently
[1:13:53] fullness of the godhead in body and then
[1:13:55] he went on saying whom all divine wisdom
[1:13:57] and godliness is restored to man well if
[1:14:00] we didn't if we if we didn't go back and
[1:14:02] check the notes we didn't realize that
[1:14:04] really that eighth mystery was godliness
[1:14:07] being restored to man because when I
[1:14:09] looked at the notes of Scofield it said
[1:14:11] the eighth mystery of the mystery of the
[1:14:13] process in which God likeness is
[1:14:17] restored to men stay with me here just
[1:14:20] for a minute
[1:14:21] Scofield says a man number eight was the
[1:14:24] mystery of the process in which God
[1:14:27] likeness is restored to man now I when I
[1:14:30] looked at I said now Oh III see where
[1:14:33] that was fulfilled it's no longer a
[1:14:36] mystery because brother Branham come
[1:14:39] along and preached statue of a perfect
[1:14:41] man hallelujah and God likeness how we
[1:14:45] can become like God was restored to me
[1:14:48] add to your faith virtue into your
[1:14:51] virtue knowledge into your knowledge
[1:14:54] temperance to your temperance patience
[1:14:56] to your patience godless to your godless
[1:14:58] brotherly kindness and then be capped
[1:15:00] off with charity the love of God
[1:15:03] we understood by revelation how godlike
[1:15:06] this was restored to man catch all of
[1:15:08] this now the brother brother probably
[1:15:10] not just kind of throwing things out
[1:15:11] there I mean like I said he says these
[1:15:13] were Scofield notes but he can say he
[1:15:16] can stand there in the pulpit pretty
[1:15:18] much and say this day this is fulfilled
[1:15:22] this rep these revelations have already
[1:15:24] come forth to the church or let me go on
[1:15:27] a little further and Manny says the
[1:15:29] ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity
[1:15:30] found in 2nd Thessalonians and so forth
[1:15:33] the tenth mystery is of the seven stars
[1:15:35] of Revelation 1:29 Scofield was
[1:15:37] for a revelation of that my brother
[1:15:40] Brandon revealed it in the church ages
[1:15:41] is that right
[1:15:42] we've just been through that the seven
[1:15:44] stars or the seven churches the seven
[1:15:46] messages and so forth and 11th mystery
[1:15:48] is the Mystery Babylon the prostitute
[1:15:50] revelation 17:5 2:7 let me go on in this
[1:15:53] quote he says thus that's that some of
[1:15:56] the mysteries
[1:15:56] see that's what Scofield had that's all
[1:15:58] you can see that some of the mysteries
[1:16:00] that this angels supposed to wind up all
[1:16:02] the mystery all the mysteries of God
[1:16:04] revelation 2:7 all the missiles of God
[1:16:06] on the other may I say this with
[1:16:08] reverence not referring to myself but
[1:16:11] referring to the angel of God he says
[1:16:13] another mystery the serpent seed that's
[1:16:16] been a hidden mystery all through the
[1:16:18] years and I'll tell you what it's you
[1:16:21] know on Wednesday night we got the
[1:16:23] touching on that a little bit and you
[1:16:26] know and and and my friend was here and
[1:16:28] she like she never heard anything like
[1:16:33] that you know and I never heard it
[1:16:37] either till I heard God's prophet I
[1:16:40] didn't know what happened in the Garden
[1:16:42] of Eden till I heard God's prophet and
[1:16:45] no matter how much you might think that
[1:16:47] that revelation has got to be wrong
[1:16:49] there's a supernatural element that
[1:16:51] remains despite the revelations
[1:16:54] hallelujah and if God vindicated that be
[1:16:57] true i'ma go with what God said amen
[1:17:00] hallelujah I ain't think I've indicated
[1:17:03] nobody let's talk about an apple on
[1:17:05] apricot went went went but when he told
[1:17:07] us a man that a man it was a adultery
[1:17:10] that happened in the Garden of Eden God
[1:17:13] vindicated that and got testifies of his
[1:17:16] gifts all right let's go on a little
[1:17:18] further he said he said the Serpent's
[1:17:20] eat that's been a hidden mystery all
[1:17:22] through the years say the grace
[1:17:24] straighten out not disgrace oh I can't
[1:17:30] hack it again because you know you got
[1:17:33] people out there taught radical grace

[1:17:39] life you want to live and thank God
[1:17:42] gonna love you in half
[1:17:44] amen hallelujah amen you wouldn't even
[1:17:49] want to be in a relationship where love
[1:17:50] only went one way if you had a wife or a
[1:17:59] husband that was you the only one giving
[1:18:01] out love you and you would see this is a
[1:18:03] this is a terrible relationship if you
[1:18:06] give love you want to receive love and
[1:18:08] if God gave love he wants to receive
[1:18:11] love and the least you can give God you
[1:18:15] can present your body a living sacrifice
[1:18:19] that's so reasonable service live holy

[1:21:53] anything that was eternal never had a
[1:21:55] beginning or in hell was created all
[1:22:00] these mysteries the mystery of the
[1:22:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost and look at
[1:22:03] this one the baptism Holy Ghost without
[1:22:07] sensation so you can actually get the
[1:22:09] Holy Ghost without crying you can get
[1:22:12] the Holy Ghost without snot you can get
[1:22:14] the Holy Ghost without jumping you can
[1:22:16] get to go Holy Ghost without running but
[1:22:19] you can't get the Holy Ghost without
[1:22:20] seeing a change in your life we're gonna
[1:22:25] see a different senior come on somebody
[1:22:28] so we're not trying to make everybody
[1:22:30] jump and shout and speak in tongues but
[1:22:32] we want to see that difference in your
[1:22:33] life
[1:22:34] Oh hallelujah it said it missed it about
[1:22:37] - no egos without sensation but the
[1:22:39] person of Christ perform it in you the
[1:22:42] same works that he did the mystery of
[1:22:44] the water baptism where the stream
[1:22:47] trinitarianism has brought it into
[1:22:48] titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and
[1:22:50] the mystery of the guy had been
[1:22:52] fulfilled in the baptism of the name of
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ according to the Book of
[1:22:56] Revelations that the church and this
[1:22:58] time was to receive there is some of the
[1:23:02] mysteries the pillar of fire returning
[1:23:04] back amen that's the thing that's
[1:23:06] supposed to take place and we see it oh
[1:23:09] how we could go on naming the mysteries
[1:23:13] I thank God for that I just wanna this
[1:23:15] is my starting point here
[1:23:18] and and I already see that the way that
[1:23:20] this is going I'm probably not going to
[1:23:22] finish but that's ok we as long as we're
[1:23:26] here we got time a man as long as we're
[1:23:29] here we have time but the Bible says I
[1:23:32] beseech you therefore right brethren by
[1:23:35] the mercies of God this is Romans 12
[1:23:37] verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren
[1:23:39] by the mercies of God that you present
[1:23:40] your bodies a living sacrifice holy not
[1:23:47] sexy holy acceptable unto who because
[1:23:55] brother Troy told us a lot of stuff we
[1:23:56] do is for men we're not doing it for God
[1:23:58] but when we're doing it for God is holy
[1:24:01] acceptable unto God which look at this
[1:24:06] and this the least you can do which is
[1:24:08] your reasonable service
[1:24:10] dressing right is the least you can do
[1:24:14] oh my god all right Amen it's the least
[1:24:20] you can do a man a Manny Manny Manny
[1:24:24] Manny I'm gonna just have to say it cuz
[1:24:26] it's the way it came before you even
[1:24:27] give God your money give him your body
[1:24:34] before you give me money give me your
[1:24:36] body it's your reasonable service
[1:24:39] all right and be not conformed to this
[1:24:43] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:24:47] of your mind that you may prove that or
[1:24:49] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:24:50] perfect will of God now we look at this
[1:24:52] word conformed Amen it means to be made
[1:24:55] like as believers are to be conformed to
[1:24:59] the holy character of Christ amen and
[1:25:01] not to the corrupt ways or the
[1:25:04] principles of the world don't be don't
[1:25:06] be conformed to the ways of the world
[1:25:07] but be conformed to the holy character
[1:25:10] of Christ now when we when we look at
[1:25:13] that just turn back just a couple verses
[1:25:15] a man when we are just kind of get a
[1:25:17] what this word conformed is a descriptor
[1:25:20] Romans eight let's just look at it from
[1:25:21] that angle hallelujah conformed is to be
[1:25:23] made like s believers to a man be
[1:25:26] conformed to the holy character Christ
[1:25:27] not to the corrupt ways or principles of
[1:25:30] the world
[1:25:31] now let's look at this a man to back it
[1:25:33] up with script to Romans 8 let's start
[1:25:35] at verse 28 glory to God one of our
[1:25:37] favorite passages a man every Christian
[1:25:40] loves Romans 8:28 hallelujah Amen if you
[1:25:44] don't don't go down went through some
[1:25:45] trials and some struggles and tribute
[1:25:47] tribulations this is one you should be
[1:25:49] able to go back to it's when you commit
[1:25:52] to memory a man and we know that all
[1:25:55] things a man work together for good to
[1:25:58] them that love God to them who are the
[1:26:01] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:26:04] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[1:26:07] and look at this to be conformed so you
[1:26:11] were predestinated be conformed to be
[1:26:13] conformed to the image of his son
[1:26:16] you predestinate it to look like Christ
[1:26:19] amen
[1:26:20] you not predestinate it to look like the
[1:26:22] world but God predestinated you to look
[1:26:26] like Christ to act like Christ to talk
[1:26:29] like Christ to walk like Christ
[1:26:32] listen amen for whom he did foreknow he
[1:26:35] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:26:38] the image of his son that he might be
[1:26:40] the firstborn among many brothers
[1:26:42] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[1:26:45] he also called and whom he called them
[1:26:47] he also justified and whom he justified
[1:26:49] them he also glorified you know that
[1:26:52] thing justified when we look at that it
[1:26:54] means just as if I never did it so when
[1:26:57] God looks at me you don't look at my
[1:26:58] mistakes because when he look at me he
[1:27:01] looked at he look at my sins confessed
[1:27:02] underneath his blood hallelujah thank
[1:27:05] God for that
[1:27:06] so we protest innate it amen to be
[1:27:09] conformed to the image of the son to be
[1:27:12] made like believers I conform ain't
[1:27:14] meant to be conformed to the holy
[1:27:15] character of Christ not to the corrupt
[1:27:17] ways of this world but conformed to the
[1:27:20] holy character of Christ now let's look
[1:27:22] read a quote here Amen the Prophet makes
[1:27:25] this the statement out of the message
[1:27:26] power of transformation Amen power
[1:27:29] transformation I'm starting at paragraph
[1:27:31] 37 a man who says in Romans are there
[1:27:34] for me a chapter I want to take a few
[1:27:37] verses in about the first two or three
[1:27:39] verses two verses I think he says
[1:27:44] I think it is and read and then this try
[1:27:46] to explain it the best that I know how
[1:27:48] by the help of the Holy Spirit Romans a
[1:27:51] twelfth chapter I beseech you therefore
[1:27:52] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:27:55] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:27:56] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:27:59] reasonable service I thought that was so
[1:28:02] beautiful for this group this morning
[1:28:04] what you what you done did now and now
[1:28:08] and is a conjunction as I understand and
[1:28:10] be not conformed to this world and Beach
[1:28:13] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:28:16] your mind that you may prove what is
[1:28:19] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:28:21] will of God
[1:28:22] that's what we all want to do is be not
[1:28:25] conformed to this world but be
[1:28:27] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:28:29] minds to do the perfect and acceptable
[1:28:31] will of God now that we have now that we
[1:28:34] have been saved as we are and that we
[1:28:36] have been filled with the Holy Ghost as
[1:28:38] we have now we want the mind that was in
[1:28:40] Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:28:43] transformed from the natural things of
[1:28:45] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:28:48] will of God by transformation now let
[1:28:51] notice what he just say we need to be
[1:28:52] transformed from the natural things of
[1:28:55] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:28:58] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:28:59] Spirit by his word now there's a lot
[1:29:02] that he said in just that one sentence
[1:29:04] and we'll go deeper in this as we get
[1:29:06] there he said but we won't be
[1:29:07] transformed from the natural things in
[1:29:09] life you know you know sometimes the
[1:29:12] stuff that we go through this is what

[1:34:15] the world of talk the transformation
[1:34:22] occurs God does it by by the spirit of
[1:34:27] his word
[1:34:28] he transforms well I'm gonna keep on
[1:34:31] reading but I bring it home and help you
[1:34:33] help you see what he's saying there amen
[1:34:36] God does it by the spirit of his word he
[1:34:38] transforms he plants his seat and the
[1:34:44] word is a seat right and you know how
[1:34:46] you gonna hear unless a preacher preach
[1:34:50] right he plants his seat throws his
[1:34:55] spirit on it so the word itself is a sea
[1:34:59] and then he throws the spirit on it
[1:35:02] which is the water Tennessee everything
[1:35:05] happens by the spirit listen he plans
[1:35:09] his he throws his spirit on it and it
[1:35:12] brings forth the product his holy spirit
[1:35:16] transforms a C word into a and to be the
[1:35:21] vindicated of its kind I'm gonna just
[1:35:23] keep reading this quote and then we'll
[1:35:25] hit something solid or it'll sink in it
[1:35:28] does about a spirit of his word it says
[1:35:33] what kind of seat you are that shows
[1:35:37] what's in you you can't hide it whenever
[1:35:39] you are inside it shows outside you just
[1:35:42] can't keep from it you can't make the
[1:35:44] tree anything but what it is see it's
[1:35:46] going to be that way the Holy Spirit
[1:35:47] transforms the sees that's on the inside
[1:35:50] of it no matter what kind of seed it is
[1:35:52] it'll transform into transforming if
[1:35:55] it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's
[1:35:57] a hypocrite it'll bring forth the
[1:35:59] hypocrite if it's a genuine Word of God
[1:36:01] and I bring forth the genuine son or
[1:36:02] daughter of God though I'm thinking that
[1:36:06] through a thinking man's filter when the
[1:36:08] seat comes up it comes through that it
[1:36:11] dueces a son and a daughter of God now
[1:36:15] let me let me just kind of work with
[1:36:17] this for a little bit you know because
[1:36:19] the transformation happens and what the
[1:36:21] transfer transformation is just sort of
[1:36:23] you know a transformation is a change in
[1:36:26] character a change in the mind of a
[1:36:30] Christian they said say the minds of
[1:36:32] Christians are transformed by reading by
[1:36:34] the renewing influence of divine grace
[1:36:36] the minds of Christians are transformed
[1:36:39] by the renewing influence of divine
[1:36:40] grace qualifying them to obey and
[1:36:43] glorify God all right now look at this
[1:36:46] when we look at something you know we're
[1:36:48] gonna turn back to a quick script - here
[1:36:50] you have the very first of the Bible
[1:36:53] Genesis 1 let's just look at this glory
[1:36:55] to God remember now God does this how
[1:36:58] does it how does the what is the
[1:37:00] transformation how do we get it what
[1:37:02] what does it God does it by the Spirit
[1:37:05] of his word now I want you to look at
[1:37:08] this in Genesis work and when we look at
[1:37:10] this think about yourself think about
[1:37:17] yourself a man look at this it says in
[1:37:21] Genesis 1 in the beginning God created
[1:37:22] the heavens the heaven and the earth and
[1:37:27] the earth was without form and void
[1:37:31] that's you because you come from the
[1:37:35] earth right the earth was without form
[1:37:37] and void you had no direction right
[1:37:40] right you you were lost yet he's trying
[1:37:43] to find you wait until you came in
[1:37:44] contact with Christ right say the earth
[1:37:47] was without form and void and darkness
[1:37:50] was upon the face of the deep
[1:37:53] now notice this before
[1:37:56] let there be light I want you to catch
[1:38:00] this now before God spoke let there be
[1:38:03] light
[1:38:03] what happened to the earth he says and
[1:38:06] the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:38:11] the waters
[1:38:12] Holly Lou waters represent people's
[1:38:15] right and what we need this is why we're
[1:38:18] crying out for we need the Spirit of God
[1:38:21] to come upon it
[1:38:22] the Bible says G
[1:38:23] said my words are spirit and life
[1:38:26] hallelujah amen he say saying I'm not
[1:38:29] God God moved upon the face of the
[1:38:32] waters now after the spirit move then
[1:38:34] verse 3 God said let there be light and
[1:38:38] there was light
[1:38:39] but the light did not come until the
[1:38:41] spirit move first Oh hallelujah
[1:38:45] [Music]
[1:38:46] you won't be able to walk in true
[1:38:48] revelation understanding to the spirit
[1:38:49] come you understand you will never be
[1:38:52] able to catch it something we're trying
[1:38:54] to catch this thing intellectually we
[1:38:57] will miss it the only way you're gonna
[1:38:59] understand God is you got to accept his
[1:39:01] spirit oh my and can I tell you
[1:39:04] something else the Spirit of God is
[1:39:06] what's going to connect and help you
[1:39:08] make a rapture brother Branham talked
[1:39:10] about the the magnets he went into the
[1:39:14] little the shop you know and they were
[1:39:17] cleaning up the floors and and he saw
[1:39:19] this stuff and he say uh what would
[1:39:21] happen is that they would send a magnet
[1:39:22] by and would come by and he said he
[1:39:25] would see different things that was on
[1:39:27] the floor stay on the floor but other
[1:39:29] stuff that had something in it would
[1:39:31] actually get attached to that magnet and
[1:39:34] be drawing away it drawing off the floor
[1:39:35] and he say he said now wait a minute
[1:39:37] he said now what about that piece there
[1:39:39] that should have went up say why why did
[1:39:41] that go he said because it's bolted down
[1:39:43] it might be made of the right material
[1:39:45] but because it's bolted down it can't
[1:39:48] come up hallelujah somebody I don't know
[1:39:52] what your bolted down to I don't know
[1:39:54] what you connected to what you don't
[1:39:56] want to let go of hallelujah but don't
[1:40:00] let that stuff keep you down because
[1:40:02] that magnet was representing a rapture
[1:40:07] hallelujah somebody and in order for you
[1:40:10] to be able to attach to the magnet you
[1:40:12] had to have something on the inside that
[1:40:16] could be magnetized and the only thing
[1:40:20] inside of you that can be magnetized to
[1:40:22] him is his spirit hallelujah you don't
[1:40:26] want this intellectually you want the
[1:40:29] real things and don't you stop until you
[1:40:33] get the real thing

[1:40:46] gonna please God hallelujah somebody
[1:40:51] this can't be intellectual this thing
[1:40:53] gotta be real all right I'm going on a
[1:40:57] little further notice not a Spirit of
[1:40:59] God came first before he actually gave
[1:41:01] his spoken word before the condition
[1:41:03] change the spirit the spirit had to move
[1:41:06] on it the spirit the change takes place
[1:41:08] by the spirit of his word he transforms

[1:45:42] I'm a virgin I've never never been
[1:45:45] touched by man and Mary understood the
[1:45:47] depth at the mechanics of having

[1:45:51] could I have a man a child and and I'm
[1:45:54] bringing this out because I want you to
[1:45:55] understand when I say we shall be
[1:45:58] changed you look at your condition just
[1:46:00] like Mary looked at her condition a man
[1:46:03] your
[1:46:03] here you sometimes you're in darkness
[1:46:05] sometimes your light sometimes you you
[1:46:07] know you're up sometimes you down
[1:46:09] sometimes you got vision sometimes
[1:46:11] you'll know where you're going huh a
[1:46:13] menu and you ain't you influx all the
[1:46:16] time hallelujah but what changes the
[1:46:19] condition is when the Spirit of God
[1:46:22] moves on the face of the waters
[1:46:24] and when God begins to move on the face
[1:46:27] of the waters then light did he can come
[1:46:29] for light and light comes forth
[1:46:31] amen when God moved on me he told me say
[1:46:34] say say Mary said how this thing gonna
[1:46:36] be he said say Mary the Holy Ghost
[1:46:39] the answer was real simple the Holy
[1:46:42] Ghost is going to overshadow you amen
[1:46:46] and hallelujah remember the Holy Ghost
[1:46:48] without sensation we back at it again
[1:46:51] right because ha she had no feeling she
[1:46:55] had no emotion but she had a promise and
[1:47:00] with that promise the Spirit of God I
[1:47:03] don't know when it came man I don't know
[1:47:06] how it came in but one thing I do know
[1:47:08] is that Mary produced a child hallelujah
[1:47:12] and if the Holy Ghost can cause Mary to
[1:47:15] come forth with a child then that same
[1:47:18] Holy Ghost can change you from the
[1:47:21] mortal to immortality from corruption to
[1:47:25] incorruption it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:47:27] that does the change the change comes
[1:47:30] God does it by the spirit of his word
[1:47:33] [Applause]
[1:47:37] you got the example in the scripture
[1:47:40] Mary conceived and bore Christ after the
[1:47:44] Holy Spirit / she's out of her and I'ma
[1:47:46] tell you the only way you're going to
[1:47:47] actually get a change it's the Holy
[1:47:49] Spirit I have to also make a difference
[1:47:51] in you Oh somebody glory to God somebody
[1:47:55] not going to see death somebody gonna be
[1:47:59] caught up to meet him in the air but
[1:48:01] you're gonna have to have the material
[1:48:02] on the inside in order to do this this

[1:48:06] this is where you need to get down to
[1:48:08] business with God now you say Lord I
[1:48:11] can't identify what brother Jack said

[1:49:59] it you ain't felt it you a unit you know
[1:50:02] no sensation was there but you actually
[1:50:04] being changed the eat your very presence
[1:50:07] here this morning shows that a change is
[1:50:10] happening
[1:50:10] some of y'all a year ago would not be
[1:50:13] sitting here
[1:50:14] some of y'all two years ago wouldn't be
[1:50:17] sitting here
[1:50:18] some of y'all ten years ago wouldn't be
[1:50:21] sitting here hello
[1:50:23] some of y'all 20 years ago wouldn't be
[1:50:25] sitting here come on son bye
[1:50:28] you ought to look back and see where God
[1:50:30] brought you from what what was that on
[1:50:33] the inside of you say well I think I'm
[1:50:35] gonna start going to church huh when you
[1:50:38] you want nothing to do with God but what
[1:50:41] was that that just beginning to deal
[1:50:43] with your heart say I think I want to go
[1:50:44] to church amen
[1:50:45] that was part of the transformation you
[1:50:48] never even felt it but it's happening
[1:50:50] anyway you know when I when a frog is
[1:50:54] born he looks like a fish huh and his
[1:51:02] tadpole stage he looks like a fish
[1:51:04] hallelujah swim like a fish
[1:51:07] act like a fish but as that frog
[1:51:10] continues to develop hallelujah amen
[1:51:14] eventually what happens is he loses his
[1:51:16] tail and let me tell you something as
[1:51:20] you continue to develop you lose the
[1:51:22] things of the world and you don't even
[1:51:26] know when they drop off but because you
[1:51:29] grown into this thing the things of the
[1:51:32] world begin to grow strangely dim and
[1:51:34] the light of his glory and grace and you
[1:51:37] don't know why you don't like the things
[1:51:39] you used to like you don't know why you
[1:51:41] don't want to go to places you used to
[1:51:43] go it's because a transformation has
[1:51:46] begun without sensation and if you can
[1:51:53] see that just in your natural man the
[1:51:56] transformations also began spiritually
[1:51:58] where you gonna be changed in a moment
[1:51:59] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:52:01] let me just read it oh my god you know
[1:52:05] that that frog when he drops his tail
[1:52:07] hallelujah when he when he drops his
[1:52:09] tail he becomes I mean he goes from
[1:52:11] tadpole to being thought he brother
[1:52:13] branham say he thinks that's what paul
[1:52:14] was referring to when he wrote
[1:52:15] description looking at a frog not only
[1:52:18] does a frog go through a transformation
[1:52:19] you know a caterpillar
[1:52:24] we talk about being transfer when we
[1:52:27] tell our goal from Caterpillar stage and
[1:52:28] you know if yeah you know if y'all just
[1:52:31] honest you see a caterpillar by ready to
[1:52:33] squash it but when you see him in his
[1:52:39] transform stage he's gentle oh y'all in
[1:52:47] with me he's colorful he's beautiful and
[1:52:52] you want him to just land somewhere
[1:52:54] million do you want to take pictures of
[1:52:57] him but before he got to that stage he
[1:53:02] had to go through a transformation
[1:53:06] hallelujah he had to go into a cocoon
[1:53:10] this was a really difficult test and
[1:53:13] when you in the cocoon there's no room
[1:53:16] for nobody else this is something that
[1:53:23] you gotta work out on your own and
[1:53:26] brother branham say when amen if you
[1:53:28] take scissors and you cut the cocoon you
[1:53:31] were actually deform the caterpillar you
[1:53:35] would be for mum rather than allow him
[1:53:37] to be transformed you deform them
[1:53:40] hallelujah somebody but if he is true
[1:53:44] caterpillar if he gives them to that
[1:53:46] that that cocoon it begins to work
[1:53:48] things out don't worry I don't care how
[1:53:50] long the process takes
[1:53:51] he will come forth hallelujah he'll go
[1:53:56] in a caterpillar where he'll come out a
[1:54:00] butterfly
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:04] he'll go in bound to the earth he'll
[1:54:08] come out a heavenly being come on church
[1:54:13] amen he was bound down he couldn't get
[1:54:16] no higher than the ground but when he
[1:54:18] comes out you don't have to go back down
[1:54:20] to the ground no more that's a real
[1:54:24] transformation and the Word of God is
[1:54:28] what does this to you a caterpillar got
[1:54:31] to make this happen it's just in his
[1:54:33] nature this is it there's a certain time
[1:54:37] period that he has to go to that cocoon
[1:54:38] and when he goes in that's it when I
[1:54:41] come out I'm it's gonna be all right
[1:54:43] my God my God my God this earth is like
[1:54:47] our cocoon but God is not cutting us out
[1:54:50] we got to work through every trial work
[1:54:52] through every tribulation work through
[1:54:53] every distress because we shall be
[1:54:55] changed
[1:55:01] expectation how could you a drunkard a
[1:55:04] few weeks ago or a few months ago in a
[1:55:07] gentleman this afternoon how could you
[1:55:11] a street harlot a few weeks ago and a
[1:55:15] lady this afternoon by the transforming
[1:55:19] power of God being transmitted by the
[1:55:23] Holy Ghost into your heart
[1:55:26] so the transforming part of power got
[1:55:28] about Holy Ghost it's coming into your
[1:55:31] heart change your nature and change your
[1:55:36] making it made you another person that's
[1:55:40] why Paul could say things like the the
[1:55:42] life that I now live I live by the Son
[1:55:46] of God see what Paul said I used to live
[1:55:49] a different life but now because Christ
[1:55:51] has come in I live eight I live
[1:55:53] something different now hallelujah

[1:55:59] again made you another person that's
[1:56:00] right you might not have felt I don't
[1:56:04] know about that but it's here anyhow
[1:56:06] that's once a Holy Ghost without
[1:56:07] sensation you might not have felt it but
[1:56:10] it's here anyhow whether you feel it or
[1:56:12] not whether you feel like you're being
[1:56:14] transformed not
[1:56:16] let's give God thanks for thank you for
[1:56:23] changing me amen in order to make the
[1:56:31] rapture you gonna have to go through a
[1:56:32] change
[1:56:34] hallelujah you know I'm gonna come back
[1:56:38] this quote marry one the only one that
[1:56:41] had to go through a change in order or
[1:56:44] transformation in order to receive
[1:56:46] Christ or to produce Christ she went all
[1:56:48] the way we have other scripture examples
[1:56:51] when you go back you look at the story
[1:56:53] of Abraham and Sarah they went through a
[1:56:55] transformation and you know for the
[1:56:59] Brandon tells us a story how you think
[1:57:00] you know what one more than Abraham just
[1:57:02] wake up and look at Sarah light what
[1:57:03] happened overnight you change Sarah and
[1:57:07] your age hasn't changed but your body
[1:57:10] has and you a 90 year old woman but
[1:57:14] you're looking like you 18 Sarah
[1:57:18] whatever happened here and she looked
[1:57:21] back at Abraham saying Abraham what
[1:57:22] doesn't happen to you you look like you
[1:57:24] about 21 again what's going on and the
[1:57:27] way that you could tell that something
[1:57:28] happened is that they went down to a
[1:57:31] place they weren't supposed to go but
[1:57:34] God would put you in situations that you
[1:57:38] was supposed to be in in order to prove
[1:57:40] to you who you are
[1:57:47] and he sent them I mean he allowed them
[1:57:49] to go down and took Gerard I believe it
[1:57:51] was it and here the king sorry like the
[1:57:54] king was praying that God would send my
[1:57:56] wife he wanted some Susumu chilling
[1:57:59] hello somebody but he wanted a nice wife
[1:58:02] and he and Winnie and when he went with
[1:58:05] it when he got he saw Sarah come he said
[1:58:07] oh my god has answered my prayer and
[1:58:11] Abraham shouldn't have been there and
[1:58:13] should've did what he's here but he says
[1:58:16] she my sister now now to some us that's
[1:58:19] just a little lie a little lie is a lie
[1:58:23] and Abraham should not I saw his wife
[1:58:25] out like that what kind of man would
[1:58:28] give his wife over to something like
[1:58:30] that
[1:58:30] he don't even you know he showed that he
[1:58:32] don't even love his wife he loved his
[1:58:34] life more than he loved his wife but a
[1:58:38] real man had put his life out for his
[1:58:41] wife is that the truth if he really
[1:58:44] loved hey glory to God you ain't sittin
[1:58:47] up to the dough the face nobody somebody

[1:58:55] real man don't do not like that yeah I
[1:58:57] got this I got this you know hey man
[1:59:00] glory God you ain't got nothing but just
[1:59:02] act like you got it Abraham give his
[1:59:07] wife or with a bit election and when
[1:59:09] when he say oh yes Lord thank you God he
[1:59:11] got that program say got down on his
[1:59:13] knees at night he began to pray like
[1:59:14] lord I thank you for this woman that you

[2:00:49] watching over his promise that he gave
[2:00:51] to Abraham and Sarah
[2:00:52] he said Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[2:00:56] and because God said that God even when
[2:01:00] you fail God got to watch over his word
[2:01:03] that he promised you so I want to tell
[2:01:09] you this ain't got nothing to do with
[2:01:11] you this whole God and if God say you

[2:01:50] man and when he got this young woman
[2:01:53] feels like right Lord this is something
[2:01:54] but God proved that the change dollar
[2:01:56] taking place brother Branham said God
[2:01:57] didn't just change the outside but what
[2:02:02] God did was changed the plumbing on the
[2:02:04] inside because they didn't just go back
[2:02:08] to being young people again because
[2:02:09] while they were young people they still
[2:02:11] can have children huh he didn't just
[2:02:14] take the outside and change it god oh my
[2:02:17] god he's not just transforming your

[2:02:58] person that's right you might have felt
[2:03:00] I don't know about that but if there's
[2:03:02] any anyhow whether you feel it or not

[2:06:37] standing there like Oh til the power of
[2:06:39] God comes down when it hits it says yes
[2:06:43] next man says
[2:06:50] it says yes and the next man says yeah
[2:06:55] let's try the different way than all
[2:07:00] y'all doing we're gonna start with you
[2:07:03] brother Gary it says yes and the next
[2:07:06] man says
[2:07:16] yes

[2:07:31] yeah yes
[2:07:52] yes yeah
[2:07:59] next man says yes let me tell you
[2:08:03] something when when everybody get into a
[2:08:05] move like that things begin to happen
[2:08:08] this will say yes and the next man says
[2:08:12] yes and the next man says yep it begins
[2:08:16] to create an atmosphere nobody in the
[2:08:20] church said no everybody everybody get
[2:08:53] the same spirit you didn't even want to
[2:08:56] wave but if you break it
[2:09:05] if you break the way they got to start
[2:09:08] all over again so don't break the spirit
[2:09:12] don't break the wave of the spirit huh
[2:09:16] and when the first man say yes the next
[2:09:20] man see pulling a clock when we get a
[2:09:24] church him and for me
[2:09:25] somebody Allah yes you gotta say yes

[2:09:37] something
[2:09:38] [Applause]
[2:09:40] praise God
[2:09:46] you might not even feel it but why you
[2:09:48] saying yes you surrender it to the world
[2:09:51] and the wine is producing a change in
[2:09:54] your body
[2:09:55] and before you know it one day we won't
[2:09:58] be grounded no more we shall be changed
[2:10:02] and notice what the Bible say in the
[2:10:04] moments that mean you'll never feel it
[2:10:09] you'll never feel it but because of
[2:10:12] promised sinning and even when you go
[2:10:15] astray because God made a promise he got
[2:10:21] to bring you back
[2:10:23] to fulfill his promise that's why I
[2:10:26] could sing mercy said God can't let you
[2:10:34] go he won't to to fulfill this promise
[2:10:36] you shall be changed in a moment in the
[2:10:41] twinkling of an eye hallelujah
[2:10:44] hallelujah hallelujah all right let me
[2:10:47] just finish this please it says that
[2:10:50] they're standing there till the power
[2:10:51] God comes down when it hits it says yes
[2:10:55] next man says yes look at it you got
[2:11:00] double powers of yes then the Holy
[2:11:05] Spirit moves in and confers the Word of
[2:11:07] God with signs and wonders following
[2:11:09] that's it that's what we meet and
[2:11:12] expectation see how that double the
[2:11:16] power yes and you know just one person
[2:11:17] yes and then that thing just pick up
[2:11:19] like that you just start feeling
[2:11:20] something isn't this the world calls it

[2:11:30] of y'all said yesterday and you didn't
