[33:14] noted they man in your books that we did
[33:17] not bow hallelujah and brother Branham
[33:21] said we need to turn our attention to

[47:08] amen just thankful to be here tonight
[47:12] we're here visiting with my grandfather
[47:16] and we just learned this week that these
[47:20] services were put together and I was
[47:23] writing we were riding in a car on our
[47:25] way here and I started kind of just
[47:28] thinking about some of the sermons that
[47:32] my grandfather is preached and on faith
[47:35] and only believing and I had remembered
[47:39] a time where he said there's a
[47:41] difference between believing and only
[47:43] believing believing still leaves room
[47:47] for doubt
[47:48] all right but when you only believe
[47:50] there's no space for doubt you only
[47:52] believe and so tonight you know we were
[47:56] just trusting God my wife and I we've
[48:00] been believing the Lord and I've kind of
[48:03] shared just a little bit we've just been
[48:05] believing the Lord to bless us with a
[48:06] child and you know we we don't know what
[48:10] God has in store for us but we're only
[48:14] believing and we've turned it over to
[48:16] the Lord and we're just trusting him
[48:20] amen so I just hope that this would
[48:22] encourage somebody tonight so can I get
[48:25] a sheet sauces you don't have to worry
[48:33] then don't you be afraid joy comes in

[53:29] some few years ago we had a service here
[53:35] on a Saturday night like this and
[53:38] brother Nathan came
[53:41] and he prayed for the sick that night
[53:44] and and there were many
[53:48] positive things that came forth from
[53:50] those services reminded of one
[53:53] particular relative we had here it was
[53:55] his first time coming to church was that
[53:57] night and then he was going through
[54:00] situations blind in both of his eyes and
[54:03] on his first time here he came that was
[54:05] pray for his sister inviting the comedy

[54:10] back a few weeks later set up past to
[54:12] God restore him sign in with her - and
[54:14] he's been faithful to church ever since
[54:17] that time big man and we just thank God
[54:19] for them
[54:23] a male in
[54:25] there was a gentleman that had come and
[54:29] he was bringing a relative of his here
[54:31] to the service that night he was from
[54:34] Washington DC and he was just passing
[54:35] through just visiting didn't know
[54:38] anything about the service and he walked
[54:39] in on that night bringing this kind of
[54:41] bringing his cousin I believe in and
[54:43] said I want to be pray for two and you
[54:45] know and he was prayed for and about a
[54:48] few months later he was back down visit
[54:50] his cousin we were at the hospital
[54:52] together they said pastor I need to talk
[54:54] to you
[54:55] they pulled me outside the night and the
[54:57] hallway they said you know that night I
[54:59] came to churches my first time coming
[55:00] and he says I got an afraid line to be
[55:03] prayed for it says I had a cyst that was
[55:06] right here you know on my hand and you
[55:10] know we didn't know really what was
[55:12] gonna you know what we were gonna do but
[55:13] it was there on my hand I remembered
[55:15] that he said but I got prayed for
[55:18] after that prayer lamb the cysts was
[55:20] gone
[55:25] and here he was just passing through
[55:27] just you know not knowing anything about
[55:29] our church and and he come back to
[55:31] testify that God touched his body and
[55:35] we're witnesses that Jesus Christ is the
[55:39] same yesterday today and forever and
[55:41] also you know the Lord just kind of put
[55:43] it on my heart to do this and a few
[55:46] years ago we went to brother Nathan's
[55:48] Church and a precious sister 15 man's
[55:53] and sometime yet she had she had been
[55:55] prayed for once before for the Nathan
[55:56] was here and she had a issue where she
[55:58] couldn't move
[55:59] she couldn't rotate the shoulders she
[56:01] couldn't move it and my brother Nathan
[56:02] was pretty for that night say that same
[56:05] night that she was grateful she went
[56:07] home and she pulled out the iron and she
[56:09] was ironing the way and she said you see
[56:11] notice that hey my son my shoulders
[56:12] moving in ways that it wasn't moving
[56:14] before and God did it in one night one
[56:17] night so you know she she had she had
[56:19] faith to say you know what I got another
[56:21] situation and I'm facing
[56:25] you know she developed a growth you know
[56:28] in her in her scalp
[56:31] and the doctor told her that it was
[56:32] cancerous that this was a cancerous
[56:35] growth and and said you know we're gonna
[56:37] have to remove that and you know she was
[56:39] just standing in faith believing God
[56:41] that you know something would happen and
[56:43] we that we went out there to
[56:45] Jeffersonville and we had meetings there
[56:48] and brother Nathan's Church the Church
[56:49] of the open door there in Sellersburg
[56:52] area and and as we were as we were there
[56:56] having service just say you know what
[56:58] before I go back home I want you all to
[57:00] pray for me
[57:02] you know just just pray for Mesa garden
[57:04] God heard your prayer once before and I
[57:06] believe he'll hear it again so just pray
[57:08] for me before I go back home and at the
[57:10] end of the last service you know he
[57:12] called her up to be prayed for you know
[57:15] she came up and I believe my mom came up
[57:17] as well and and mom had been going
[57:19] through something where she was having
[57:21] cramps you know in her legs and she had
[57:23] a very hard time sleeping but that night
[57:25] that she was prayed for she had one of
[57:27] the best sleeping nights that she could
[57:28] and and you know God touched her in her
[57:31] body and she were coming back home the
[57:33] next day and so sister Tonya told the
[57:35] doctor before she left you said you know
[57:37] I'm getting ready to go to some meetings
[57:39] in Indiana just say the doctor said
[57:43] we're gonna have to do surgery on that
[57:44] now said well before you do surgery let
[57:46] me just go to the meetings and and you
[57:48] know let's just you know after I get
[57:50] back then we'll do the surgery you know
[57:52] after I get back
[57:53] the doctor said okay that's fine you do
[57:55] all this weekend to the meetings so she
[57:57] went and she got prayed for the internet
[57:59] last service and when she was prayed for
[58:02] she came back home maybe she went
[58:05] through Monday we flew back home and I
[58:07] think Tuesday was the day that she was
[58:09] supposed to go and have this surgery and
[58:11] she woke up that morning and she pulled
[58:14] out her comb and she began to part her
[58:17] hair to look for this growth that was
[58:20] there cancerous growth that was there
[58:21] and was she part of the hair the growth
[58:24] was gone the cancer gone just like that
[58:29] absolutely go
[58:34] so you don't know when it fell off all
[58:37] she knows that it fell off between
[58:39] prayer and going back to the doctor and
[58:42] you know just pull that up for me if you
[58:44] can this just kind of shows where the
[58:48] cancer was you'll just hit that light
[58:49] switch there for me
[58:50] [Music]
[58:53] it shows this is where the growth was a
[58:56] man in this area it was cancerous but
[58:59] this was before prayer and this was
[59:01] after prayer a man just
[59:06] God give us evidence that he's the same
[59:09] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[59:12] [Music]
[59:15] you know we think the Lord and you know
[59:18] when we were me
[59:19] experience things like this it's hard
[59:21] for us to doubt no matter how difficult
[59:24] the situation is they meant how
[59:27] impossible it may seem our God is the
[59:29] God that specializes in impossibilities
[59:32] a man I was listening to quote just a
[59:35] few days ago and the Prophet was
[59:37] referring to the healing of congressman
[59:42] congressman Upshaw I believe the man was
[59:44] in a wheelchair for 50 or 60 years and
[59:46] that 86 years old the man was made home
[59:49] he got up out of a wheelchair and what
[59:52] the Prophet says they say God it doesn't
[59:54] matter
[59:55] there's no age limit when it comes to
[59:57] healing no age limit you know you get 86
[1:00:01] years old and you go to the doctor
[1:00:03] they'll actually tell you now you have
[1:00:04] to expect some things when you get this
[1:00:06] aged hallelujah but as a Christian you
[1:00:08] know what you can expect some things you
[1:00:11] can expect God to heal you
[1:00:14] hallelujah amen whether it was a baby or
[1:00:17] whether it was a ninety-year-old you can
[1:00:19] expect healing from an Almighty God
[1:00:21] he sets no age limits when it comes to
[1:00:25] healing the honors faith and tonight
[1:00:29] we're coming a man with our faith amen
[1:00:32] under with an expectation that whatever
[1:00:35] it is that you're facing here tonight
[1:00:37] God is able to heal it and we've acts
[1:00:40] you know what we want to initially do is
[1:00:43] try to get those to have a very serious
[1:00:46] case very difficult case a man may be
[1:00:49] something that the doctors have given up
[1:00:51] on but we want to invite you after the
[1:00:53] Word of God has preached to you tonight
[1:00:55] and maybe we'll have a prayer line and
[1:00:57] we want to pray especially for the sick
[1:00:59] our God is real our God is able to he's
[1:01:03] still a healer he never stopped healing
[1:01:05] they may still heal he's still in the
[1:01:07] healing business so we want to invite
[1:01:09] you to come for prayer and you know and
[1:01:11] after a man we've kind of gone through
[1:01:14] some of the hard cases then we may open
[1:01:17] the floor up for others that might be
[1:01:19] standing a gap for somebody else you
[1:01:21] know but we just want the Spirit of Lord
[1:01:23] just to lead our precious brother as
[1:01:26] as God will and we just want him to have
[1:01:29] his liberty as he comes here tonight
[1:01:31] amen to preach the gospel and the pray
[1:01:33] for the sick pray for him that God would
[1:01:35] strengthen him they meant tonight
[1:01:36] there's other testimonies that he would
[1:01:38] probably share but these the ones that
[1:01:40] we know that happened right here one
[1:01:42] other that night that we had that
[1:01:43] service my wife had an uncle if I had to
[1:01:48] be honest amen as he was walking into
[1:01:50] the church and days and months before it
[1:01:53] seemed like he was walking death if I
[1:01:56] had to be honest he was he look like he
[1:01:58] was going out he was going down we
[1:02:00] invited him to the service to come and
[1:02:02] be prayed for he couldn't Drive his
[1:02:05] appetite was was very I mean had a very
[1:02:08] low note really almost no appetite at
[1:02:11] all wasn't eating well and just you know
[1:02:13] just really going through a lot in his
[1:02:15] body and we invited him to come to that
[1:02:17] service he came and he got prayed for
[1:02:20] and that night he hadn't been driving
[1:02:22] for four months for a good while but
[1:02:25] that night he got in the car and left
[1:02:27] service and he said I'm gonna drive home
[1:02:29] and he drove home 45 minutes first time
[1:02:32] he had driven you know in a while and he
[1:02:34] made it home no problems next day got up
[1:02:37] kept driving
[1:02:38] the next day kept driving his appetite
[1:02:40] came back he started eating and if you
[1:02:42] saw the man today you never know that
[1:02:44] was the same man that came to be prayed
[1:02:45] for
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:49] we've seen him do it before we know what
[1:02:51] he's able to do hallelujah somebody Amen
[1:02:55] so tonight Amen you've been invited to
[1:02:57] come hear me pray for and it was so glad
[1:03:00] that you came I was talking with a man
[1:03:01] recently and we were inviting him
[1:03:03] inviting him to come tonight and and he
[1:03:06] he was he say so in order to be prayed
[1:03:09] for we got it we got to come to the

[1:03:12] that's that's said to be brief uh come
[1:03:13] to the church so he says he say well
[1:03:16] that's guys gonna be hard so I told them
[1:03:19] I said you know the condition that you
[1:03:21] have if the doctor would have called you
[1:03:23] right now and say I got a new pill that
[1:03:26] just came out and this will handle
[1:03:28] everything that you're going through
[1:03:29] it'll take care of everything if if you
[1:03:32] just get to my office and get the pill
[1:03:33] say I guarantee you get in your car and
[1:03:36] get to the office to get that pill so if
[1:03:38] you do that for the doctor you got to do
[1:03:40] the same thing for God
[1:03:42] hey man he ain't got a pill he just lay
[1:03:44] hands on you
[1:03:46] hallelujah lay hands on the sick and
[1:03:48] they shall recover that's that's what he
[1:03:50] said in his work so we're not the only
[1:03:51] pill we give about us Gospels but you
[1:03:58] gotta have the same confidence in God
[1:04:00] that you have in a man

[1:04:20] in a very special way God wants to speak
[1:04:23] to our heart hallelujah during his words
[1:04:27] and then from there we'll pray for the
[1:04:29] sea
[1:04:31] if you're not a Christian tonight we're

[1:08:18] Jesus Christ god bless you richly good
[1:08:25] to be here with you again this evening
[1:08:28] West Palm Beach Thank You musicians I'm
[1:08:31] not going to try anything else good to
[1:08:35] have my oldest son Phillip with me
[1:08:37] traveling with me to Florida this time
[1:08:39] and and my wife and other two children
[1:08:42] send their greetings and just wanted to
[1:08:45] make mention who was the the brother
[1:08:48] that's saying with Jesus I can make it
[1:08:52] with brother I heard you saying that you
[1:08:56] and your wife is or wanting a child and
[1:08:59] have been having we had a sister I guess
[1:09:02] it's been about a year ago her and her
[1:09:04] husband had been trying for seven years
[1:09:06] to have a child and at the end of his
[1:09:09] service we'd actually had a baptismal
[1:09:11] service and at the end of the service
[1:09:13] brother Billy Paul was there and I know
[1:09:16] that he had prayed for several and and
[1:09:18] and that had been in situations like
[1:09:21] that and they'd had children from that
[1:09:23] prayer and we also had a sister there
[1:09:27] that was her blood sister that had had a
[1:09:29] child but had a lot of birth defects and
[1:09:31] things and had passed away just a few
[1:09:33] days old and so I had asked for the
[1:09:35] Billy Paul to come up and pray for that
[1:09:37] sister that couldn't have children is
[1:09:39] interested in the way
[1:09:40] it worked out and asked him to pray for
[1:09:42] her and her and her sister both came up
[1:09:44] and so he laid his hands on on the
[1:09:46] sister that couldn't have children I
[1:09:47] prayed with him for her and then he kind
[1:09:49] of stepped back and I prayed for the
[1:09:51] sister that had had the child that that
[1:09:53] had died and and she was wanting another
[1:09:55] child and everything to be okay and and
[1:09:58] both of those sisters I had the honor
[1:10:01] and privilege last couple months to
[1:10:02] dedicate both of their children amen so
[1:10:06] we know that God's more than able raised
[1:10:09] the Lord for whatever you have need of
[1:10:13] tonight we believe that Hebrews 13:8
[1:10:15] Jesus Christ is still the same today
[1:10:18] that he was yesterday so if we can look
[1:10:20] into the Bible we can read the things
[1:10:22] that Jesus did yesterday and find out
[1:10:24] that he was able to heal the sick and
[1:10:26] raise the dead and open the eyes of the
[1:10:27] blind and the deaf ears and all that he
[1:10:30] did deliver the demon oppressed if he
[1:10:32] was able to do that back then then he's
[1:10:34] able to do it again tonight or there's
[1:10:37] something wrong with Hebrews 13 and
[1:10:38] eight but but we believe that it's right
[1:10:40] we see the evidence of it I know brother
[1:10:43] Jack shared with you many of the
[1:10:45] testimonies and things that that
[1:10:46] happened the last meeting I don't want
[1:10:48] to keep you standing too long but I just
[1:10:49] want to share two other quick
[1:10:50] testimonies with you we had a sister a
[1:10:54] brother and a sister that one of my
[1:10:56] Deacon brothers and his wife they had a
[1:10:58] little girl and and she's just a little
[1:11:01] bit younger than my little boy and
[1:11:03] that's here with me tonight and and she
[1:11:06] has scoliosis and was two inches shorter
[1:11:08] than she should have been the x-rays
[1:11:09] showed her spine looked about like that
[1:11:11] just crooked and so they brought her up
[1:11:14] for prayer and we prayed for and about a
[1:11:15] year later the the doctor took another
[1:11:17] x-ray and it looked like that so we know
[1:11:20] God is able
[1:11:21] [Applause]
[1:11:28] where the random tells us many times
[1:11:30] none of us have the symptoms that Jonah
[1:11:31] had there's none of us here tonight that
[1:11:34] has quite as bad as symptoms as he had
[1:11:35] in the belly of the whale three days and
[1:11:38] three nights she may have had symptoms
[1:11:39] tonight but you're not in the condition
[1:11:41] that Jonah was and God brought him
[1:11:43] through so we know that I was able to
[1:11:44] bring ether as well and then when I was
[1:11:47] in in Finland a couple years ago I think
[1:11:48] you all were there September in New
[1:11:51] Albany at the church when sister Tanya
[1:11:53] was healed of the cancer and then that
[1:11:55] very next month in October I flew to
[1:11:57] Finland and I was in a prayer line there
[1:12:00] and had this same Bible in the same
[1:12:01] prayer cloth that I've got in this Bible
[1:12:03] and there was a sister that came up and
[1:12:05] she told me that she'd had chronic ear
[1:12:07] pain for 23 years what she didn't tell
[1:12:09] me was that she had thyroid problems for
[1:12:11] 24 years as well I took that prayer
[1:12:14] cloth and laid it on her ear and prayed
[1:12:15] for her and when I did she told me after
[1:12:17] the service through an interpreter since
[1:12:19] she felt a hot sensation starting her
[1:12:21] thyroid gland and it went up through the
[1:12:23] top of her head and when it passed by
[1:12:24] her ear the pain left instantly amen
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:30] hallelujah that doesn't make me anything
[1:12:35] but that makes him everything
[1:12:36] amen the same God that healed the people
[1:12:39] that you've heard the testimonies about
[1:12:40] tonight he's still here tonight he cares
[1:12:43] about you just the same as he does them
[1:12:46] his word is just the same for you if
[1:12:48] you'll accept it the way that they did
[1:12:50] Amen you get the same results let's turn
[1:12:53] to proverbs chapter 18 and verse 24 and
[1:12:58] just want to read one verse there
[1:13:01] tonight and then you can be seated after
[1:13:04] that proverbs chapter 18 verse 24 might
[1:13:07] seem like a very odd scripture to read
[1:13:10] for a prayer line service but maybe you
[1:13:14] understand a little bit shortly here's
[1:13:16] why I chose this first proverbs chapter
[1:13:19] 18 verse 20 for a man that hath friends
[1:13:23] must show himself friendly and there is
[1:13:26] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:13:30] brother
[1:13:31] Amen god bless she can be seated tonight
[1:13:34] I had been preaching at the church a few
[1:13:48] months ago and and had had kind of just
[1:13:51] before this service on actually right on
[1:13:53] my way out the door to the service I
[1:13:54] just wrote down one word and and from
[1:13:58] that one word I at the end of the
[1:13:59] service I begin to talk about a story
[1:14:02] that I want to share with you tonight
[1:14:03] and in doing that kind of went down this
[1:14:07] line of thought and when brother Jack
[1:14:08] invited me to come and and have a prayer
[1:14:11] line here and we're going to try and I
[1:14:13] don't make any promises but we're gonna
[1:14:15] try to keep the service a little shorter
[1:14:16] tonight so that we can go into the
[1:14:18] prayer line without keeping you too late
[1:14:19] but when he invited invited me I thought
[1:14:23] that I would share this with you and I
[1:14:25] just want to look just briefly at this
[1:14:26] thought of my friend and then I want to
[1:14:30] read you some quotes and scriptures in
[1:14:31] the lines of healing and what God does
[1:14:34] for the healing of the body some things
[1:14:36] I believe will will lift our faith by
[1:14:40] you just pray for me tonight it's a
[1:14:42] little bit different you know just
[1:14:44] coming out and preaching the word is one
[1:14:46] thing but but when you're praying for
[1:14:48] the sick and the needy and there's
[1:14:49] there's things in their lives that that
[1:14:51] they're obviously here for a reason
[1:14:54] that maybe maybe many severe needs it's
[1:14:58] just a little bit different atmosphere
[1:14:59] so we want the Lord to come and have his
[1:15:02] way but I want to tell you just a little
[1:15:06] story about a man that if there was
[1:15:09] anybody in all of history from the
[1:15:11] beginning of time until now if there was
[1:15:14] anybody that had a right I feel to be
[1:15:17] able in the natural to say that that
[1:15:19] Jesus waited too long that God was too
[1:15:23] late that it was this man and and this
[1:15:26] man had a friend and their friendship I
[1:15:29] would say was probably one of the
[1:15:32] strangest friendships that we could ever
[1:15:34] look at in all of history they had known
[1:15:36] each other since they were little
[1:15:38] children and but yet their their
[1:15:40] friendship would be different than any
[1:15:42] friend that she would have in the
[1:15:45] trope that you could compare it to this
[1:15:47] little boy they would grow up and they
[1:15:49] would have sleepovers together and this
[1:15:52] young man began to recognize very early
[1:15:55] on that there was something different
[1:15:56] about his friend than anybody else that
[1:15:58] he knew yet even when they were little
[1:16:00] boys he began to recognize there was
[1:16:02] something different about this friend
[1:16:05] from everybody else that he knew and as
[1:16:08] twelve-year-old children they would
[1:16:10] travel to a religious ceremony and on
[1:16:13] their way back home this little boy's
[1:16:16] parents would come and find him and I
[1:16:18] very frantically asked him have you seen
[1:16:20] your friend and you know I haven't seen
[1:16:22] him and they rushed around to all the
[1:16:23] other parents and the different people
[1:16:25] there and they caravan with him have you
[1:16:27] seen this little boy's friend now we
[1:16:29] haven't seen him and so the no doubt is
[1:16:32] they begin to travel back and very
[1:16:34] concern trying to find him they go back
[1:16:36] to where this religious ceremony was
[1:16:37] held and they find this little
[1:16:39] twelve-year-old boy and he's not he
[1:16:41] wasn't playing video games and he wasn't
[1:16:43] out you know just throwing rocks at
[1:16:46] people's windows with his other friends
[1:16:48] and things but they find him and he's
[1:16:50] sitting there talking to some rabbis
[1:16:52] probably in their 80s that knew the
[1:16:54] Scriptures very well and and they like a
[1:16:56] lot of theologians were probably sitting
[1:16:58] there and debating scriptures and one
[1:17:00] said well this is how I see it
[1:17:02] because Moses wrote it over here in
[1:17:04] Levitical law this is what I leaned to
[1:17:05] another one said well I can't reconcile
[1:17:07] that with numbers over here and so I
[1:17:09] leaned it I leaned a little bit more
[1:17:11] this way and they were debating their
[1:17:13] doctrinal differences and arguing and
[1:17:15] fussing and and one said well rabbi
[1:17:17] Levinsky teaches it this way and other
[1:17:19] ones said well I don't care this is what
[1:17:21] my daddy taught me and a little
[1:17:23] twelve-year-old boy standing over there
[1:17:25] very respectfully you may be raises his
[1:17:27] hand they said what what do you want son
[1:17:28] you need prayer something said no here's
[1:17:30] what what the the thing that ties these
[1:17:33] two scriptures is if you go over here to
[1:17:34] Deuteronomy it'll tie your question to
[1:17:37] Leviticus over here to your question of
[1:17:39] numbers and it'll come out just
[1:17:41] perfectly and they sat there dumbfounded
[1:17:43] a little 12 year old boy begin to
[1:17:46] explain the scriptures tune
[1:17:48] and as this this young man walks up
[1:17:51] maybe he came back with Mary and Joseph
[1:17:53] there to find his friend and he's amazed
[1:17:55] that his friend is able to teach the
[1:17:58] rabbis as they would grow up and they
[1:18:01] would become young men he could
[1:18:03] recognize that even in his teenage years
[1:18:05] he could recognize there's something
[1:18:07] different about his friend than the
[1:18:09] other friends that he would associate
[1:18:11] with you know maybe some of his other
[1:18:12] friends were a bad influence on him and
[1:18:15] they were always trying to get him to do
[1:18:16] something and it was odd to him to see
[1:18:18] this friend because the one little
[1:18:20] friend he is seemingly he could be
[1:18:23] tempted just right along with him like
[1:18:25] all of his other friends but when it
[1:18:26] actually got up to the point of an
[1:18:28] action to do something that was wrong he
[1:18:30] would always make the right choice now
[1:18:33] the you know the little boy he would try
[1:18:36] to make the right choice and sometimes
[1:18:38] he would and sometimes he wouldn't but
[1:18:40] his other friend he always made the
[1:18:42] right choice and so he grew up and he
[1:18:46] didn't understand exactly how this could
[1:18:48] be and what the difference was but he
[1:18:51] knew there was something different we
[1:18:52] find that as time goes on they begin to
[1:18:55] be young men they go down to the river
[1:18:57] one day brother band said they went arm
[1:18:59] and arm down to the Jordan together and
[1:19:01] here Jesus comes walking down with his
[1:19:04] friend and John the Baptist's are
[1:19:06] standing out there in the water
[1:19:07] baptizing people and they walk out there
[1:19:10] to the Jordan River and his friend walks
[1:19:13] out there into the water and John says
[1:19:15] behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[1:19:18] the sins of the world is the little boy
[1:19:20] looks all around now he's a young man
[1:19:22] and he doesn't see anybody out there but
[1:19:24] his friend brother Jack the Lamb of God
[1:19:27] that's gonna take away the sins of the
[1:19:28] road that's my friend I grew up with him
[1:19:32] I used to have sleepovers at his house
[1:19:35] in Nazareth he came from the worst city
[1:19:38] in all of Galilee and here John stands
[1:19:42] out there and says the Lamb of God that
[1:19:44] taketh away the sins of the world and
[1:19:45] this young man faints the prophet of God
[1:19:48] tells us he would he would be sitting
[1:19:53] there in Cana of Galilee and his friend
[1:19:56] would be there as well and his friend's
[1:19:57] mother and his
[1:20:00] sitting there you know maybe just often
[1:20:02] a corner humbly not making a big scene
[1:20:05] but as his friend's mother comes running
[1:20:07] in frantically wringing her hands and
[1:20:09] and since all there's a problem at the
[1:20:11] wedding there's a there's a problem
[1:20:13] they've ran out of line and she says
[1:20:16] look whatever whatever his friend tells
[1:20:19] you to do do it it might seem crazy it
[1:20:22] might seem ridiculous there was
[1:20:24] something about it this this man she
[1:20:27] recognized you know raising Jesus he had
[1:20:30] recognized something in his life there's
[1:20:32] no other recorded miracles in the
[1:20:34] scripture that he did as a child or a
[1:20:36] teenager not that's recorded in the
[1:20:38] scriptures but she must have recognized
[1:20:40] something in his life because there was
[1:20:42] a problem at the wedding and she didn't
[1:20:45] take him to Kay Ephesus and she didn't
[1:20:47] take him to the bank and she didn't take
[1:20:49] him to the lawyer and she didn't take
[1:20:51] him to some spiritual person in the
[1:20:53] family she took him to Jesus if we would
[1:20:57] do that when we had problems we'd be a
[1:20:59] lot better off oh there's all there's a
[1:21:01] problem there's an issue I'll run and
[1:21:03] I'll get a loan or I'll run to the
[1:21:05] lawyer I'll run to some spiritual person
[1:21:07] I'll run to some personality in the
[1:21:09] message do what Mary did take it to
[1:21:11] Jesus take it to Jesus she said whatever
[1:21:15] he says do it now sometimes we come into
[1:21:20] church and we want to be very proper and
[1:21:22] and all my if he asked me to raise my
[1:21:24] hand I'll do that and if he asked me to
[1:21:27] sing a special I guess I'll do that and
[1:21:30] if he asked me to dismiss in prayer I'll
[1:21:33] do that as long as they don't make me
[1:21:34] come up front and and you know we limit
[1:21:37] God if we're not careful I had just
[1:21:38] heard our church - a while back she said
[1:21:40] brother Nathan you would never make us
[1:21:42] do it Jericho March Woods yes I said
[1:21:44] well I don't think I've ever made
[1:21:45] anybody do anything except maybe my
[1:21:47] children you know made them take out the
[1:21:49] trash or something like that
[1:21:51] I've never really made anybody do
[1:21:53] anything in church he said well if you
[1:21:55] had a student Jericho Mart she said I
[1:21:56] just don't think I would do it I don't I
[1:21:58] don't think I could ever do that and so
[1:22:00] we were having a service there a few
[1:22:02] weeks later or maybe a few months later
[1:22:04] and the Holy Spirit was just falling in
[1:22:07] the service and my just wave upon wave
[1:22:09] the Holy Spirit coming into service all
[1:22:11] of a sudden I see this sister stand up
[1:22:13] brother Jack and there she goes around
[1:22:14] the church and she makes it all the way
[1:22:17] around she stops right in the middle of
[1:22:19] the aisle she walks back and forth the
[1:22:20] few times and here she goes again
[1:22:23] don't tell God that she won't do
[1:22:25] something Amen if you really don't want
[1:22:29] to do it then don't tell God I'll never
[1:22:31] do it or he may just make you do it
[1:22:33] brother Brandon said he was standing
[1:22:35] there and in its own tabernacle there
[1:22:37] and and he said he began to watch as a
[1:22:40] woman preacher came into the sanctuary
[1:22:42] and they got up to sing a special and he
[1:22:44] said he thought if the thing it had four
[1:22:45] decks she could have played all four
[1:22:47] decks on the piano there and he said she
[1:22:49] began to play and one of the little
[1:22:50] sisters from her church got out there
[1:22:52] and began to dance and the spirit he
[1:22:54] said there i sat in the seat of the
[1:22:55] scornful oh that's the problem we have a
[1:22:58] lot of times the church has too many
[1:22:59] people come and instead of sitting in
[1:23:01] the shouting seed or the rejoicing seed
[1:23:04] or the thankful seat they want to sit in
[1:23:06] the seat of the scornful sister so and
[1:23:08] so she I see her raising her hand and
[1:23:10] amen and over there but I know what she
[1:23:12] did last month and oh there's brother
[1:23:14] so-and-so and he claims to be
[1:23:15] such-and-such now but I remember what it
[1:23:17] used to be and if we're not careful we
[1:23:19] sit in the seat of the scornful oh man I
[1:23:23] want to send them in the seat of the
[1:23:24] worshipper hey man when I want to come
[1:23:26] to church now if I'm gonna sit in the
[1:23:28] seat lord let me just worship you you
[1:23:32] know we've seen when we all get to
[1:23:33] heaven we all get excited but when it
[1:23:35] comes to things that we're actually
[1:23:36] going to do in heaven many times when we
[1:23:38] come to church we sit there like a bump
[1:23:40] on a log and my
[1:23:42] get the heaven I brother Westcott want
[1:23:44] to run down to his feet and I wanna hold
[1:23:47] on to those precious feet that took my
[1:23:49] nails for me and I just want to lay
[1:23:51] there in worship
[1:23:53] hey man but why is it so hard when we
[1:23:55] come to church I saw a bumper sticker
[1:23:57] one time said you wanted to say you want
[1:23:59] to go to heaven but she won't go to
[1:24:00] church said well how would you enjoy
[1:24:03] going to heaven if you don't enjoy the
[1:24:05] church all the things we do here we're
[1:24:07] gonna be singing and shouting praising
[1:24:10] his name and worshiping somebody that
[1:24:13] don't like to go to church they won't
[1:24:14] like heaven very much they'll be
[1:24:16] disappointed there won't be no
[1:24:18] television won't be no remote controls
[1:24:20] won't be no internet hey man I don't get
[1:24:24] me wrong I'm not I'm not so you trying
[1:24:26] to you know just preach legalism tonight
[1:24:28] to you and say that all those things are
[1:24:30] on those things have their place and
[1:24:31] they can be used for the right thing but
[1:24:33] we find about 99.5% of the time they get
[1:24:37] used for the wrong thing amen but when
[1:24:40] we get to heaven I don't care who your
[1:24:41] favorite sports team is there ain't
[1:24:43] gonna be no basketball or football or
[1:24:45] soccer or whatever in heaven brother
[1:24:47] Brandon brother Nathan you saying
[1:24:48] basketball and football and soccer oh no
[1:24:50] I'm absolutely not saying that but if
[1:24:52] they if they become your God where
[1:24:54] that's more important to you then going
[1:24:56] to church or reading your Bible or pray
[1:24:58] and then what we call that as idolatry
[1:25:01] idolatry amen doesn't have to do that it
[1:25:04] can be hunting or fishing or our movies
[1:25:07] or whatever it is whatever you put above
[1:25:09] God it becomes an idol hey man I don't
[1:25:14] want anything in front of God I love my
[1:25:16] mommy I love my daddy I love my wife I
[1:25:18] love my children
[1:25:19] but they don't go above Jesus hey man so
[1:25:23] we want to put God first and all that we
[1:25:25] do put him first in your decisions put
[1:25:29] him first in your finances jesus said in
[1:25:31] Saint Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 seek ye
[1:25:34] first the kingdom of God and all these
[1:25:37] things will be added unto you but yet we
[1:25:39] find a lot of people well Lord when you
[1:25:40] bless me and
[1:25:42] coming to my first million then I'll do
[1:25:44] something for you Lord then then I'll
[1:25:46] pay my tithes then I'll give offerings
[1:25:48] then I'll do stuff and then we find
[1:25:50] people that get to that point then
[1:25:51] they're making too much money that oh I
[1:25:52] couldn't give 20% now goodness 10% I'm
[1:25:56] sorry you don't have to give 20% but if
[1:25:59] you want to that's alright hey man hey
[1:26:05] man Lord if you bless me with a million
[1:26:07] I'll pay 20% on it alright is it okay to
[1:26:12] pray like that I'll look at some people
[1:26:16] and I wouldn't want their millions I
[1:26:17] wouldn't want the pressures and the
[1:26:19] things that they face and and you know
[1:26:21] sometimes the more money you have it
[1:26:22] just means that there's more people
[1:26:23] coming around and thinking and expecting
[1:26:25] that you can do something for I'm and so
[1:26:27] I God didn't promise me a mansion over
[1:26:29] here but I do have one waiting over
[1:26:31] there hey man I didn't come for your
[1:26:33] money tonight I just came to preach the
[1:26:35] word to you there's a friend that
[1:26:38] sticketh closer than a brother he sees
[1:26:40] she comes and she tells him she said
[1:26:42] whatever he says to you to do do it some
[1:26:47] people say oh I I could never speak in
[1:26:49] tongues or I could never shout or I
[1:26:51] could never run the aisles I couldn't do
[1:26:52] this without the other brother branham
[1:26:54] said he was sitting there in the seat of
[1:26:55] the scornful and said that little lady
[1:26:57] dancing out there now he said well is
[1:26:58] there any scripture for that and he said
[1:27:00] I begin to think about Miriam when she
[1:27:02] came across and he said she looked back
[1:27:04] at all the taskmaster Slade behind him
[1:27:06] in the Red Sea and he said there there
[1:27:08] Moses came across and he began to sing
[1:27:11] and he said Moses Miriam rather began to
[1:27:14] get the tambourine and begin to dance
[1:27:15] and and worship with the daughters of
[1:27:17] Israel and he said I begin to Pat my
[1:27:19] foot a little bit he said I got my
[1:27:21] methodist foot patent you know and he
[1:27:23] said then I begin to think about David
[1:27:24] how that when he begin to bring the Ark
[1:27:26] of the Covenant back to the back to
[1:27:28] Jerusalem there and he was so excited to
[1:27:30] see the heart come back into the city he
[1:27:33] said he began to run around the dark and
[1:27:35] dance and a sound and his wife stood at
[1:27:37] the window looking out at him and said
[1:27:38] oh goodness look at that little Holy
[1:27:40] Roller out there he said do you think
[1:27:41] that's something watch this and around
[1:27:43] and around he went again he said before
[1:27:45] you know it I was out there dancing with
[1:27:47] her hey man so don't don't tell
[1:27:50] you're not gonna do something whatever
[1:27:53] he says my I don't I don't think that
[1:27:55] God would ask me to brother Solomon but
[1:27:57] if God told me tonight to lay down in
[1:27:59] the floor and roll down the aisle I'd do
[1:28:01] it if I really thought it was him
[1:28:02] whatever he says I'm willing to do if he
[1:28:06] tells me to go testify to somebody that
[1:28:08] I don't think has a chance I'll go do it
[1:28:10] amen because a lot of times hey maybe
[1:28:13] there was some that wouldn't come and
[1:28:14] testify to you and they didn't think you
[1:28:16] had a chance but yet here you sit in
[1:28:18] church tonight so I thank God that
[1:28:20] somebody got through to you
[1:28:22] that God used somebody he brought
[1:28:24] somebody by your way I don't know about
[1:28:25] you I know there was no angel that
[1:28:28] floated down out of heaven and came and
[1:28:29] said Nathan you know God God came and
[1:28:32] died for you and and then there's a
[1:28:34] message and a truth for the aged but
[1:28:36] somebody brought this all on my path
[1:28:38] amen so I believe somebody got to use
[1:28:40] somebody to get to you brother Branham
[1:28:43] teaches the seat always comes through
[1:28:45] the body it came through Philip to the
[1:28:47] eunuch in it or through the Ethiopian
[1:28:49] eunuch there and and it comes through
[1:28:51] the body to somebody so amen many times
[1:28:54] I think God is waiting on us to be that
[1:28:56] somebody that the word comes through to
[1:28:59] me that somebody that'll testify down at
[1:29:01] Walmart or that's your job or at your
[1:29:03] school or whatever it be so many times
[1:29:05] we get so afraid because of political
[1:29:07] correctness and people's opinions and
[1:29:09] things today that we're afraid to
[1:29:11] testify but but yeah brother brother
[1:29:13] Jack was tell me there's a there's a
[1:29:15] brother here tonight I believe that it
[1:29:17] heard about this church so because
[1:29:19] somebody just lived a life out there and
[1:29:21] they recognize that's a sister hey man
[1:29:27] sometimes that's all you got to do
[1:29:29] sometimes it takes more but sometimes
[1:29:31] all you gotta do is just walk down
[1:29:32] through and live a good clean holy life
[1:29:34] and people will get thirsty and
[1:29:36] recognize there's something real about
[1:29:38] that person there
[1:29:39] something that they have not an old
[1:29:41] legalistic something with your nose
[1:29:42] stuck up in the air and then get on
[1:29:44] better than all these people down here
[1:29:45] and my job
[1:29:46] but just a life of humility and a love
[1:29:49] of Jesus Christ that they recognize
[1:29:51] there's something real hey man whatever
[1:29:55] he says do it whatever he tells you to
[1:29:58] do
[1:29:59] hey man who do you think you are brother
[1:30:01] Nathan I'm I'm like that song that they
[1:30:03] say I'm just a nobody trying to tell
[1:30:05] everybody all about somebody that saved
[1:30:08] my soul Amen that's who I am I'm not
[1:30:11] anything brother Solomon but he's
[1:30:12] everything hey man I don't claim to be
[1:30:16] anything great but I serve one that's
[1:30:17] mighty greats hey man he's wonderful you
[1:30:21] know I'm getting off topic tonight left
[1:30:23] and right but let me just say this I was
[1:30:24] preaching recently and you know I was
[1:30:27] talking about David and Goliath and I
[1:30:28] always tease when a brother comes
[1:30:30] through and preaches on Dave and Goliath
[1:30:32] you know we've heard Dave and goliath
[1:30:33] 578 different ways from from 50
[1:30:36] different preachers but yet something
[1:30:38] about it the anointing of the Spirit can
[1:30:40] come and you can begin to look into
[1:30:41] things and and you begin to see things
[1:30:43] about these stories in the Bible that
[1:30:44] you never saw before you've heard it a
[1:30:46] thousand times but yet what is it the
[1:30:49] word is eternal and so because the word
[1:30:52] is eternal if the Lord tarries another
[1:30:54] five years or 50 years or a hundred
[1:30:56] years whatever it'll be they'll still be
[1:30:58] an anointing on the word that people
[1:31:00] still be bringing things you'll think my
[1:31:02] goodness I never heard it like that why
[1:31:04] because the word is anointed and it's
[1:31:07] eternal and so you might be in a
[1:31:09] situation five years down the road that
[1:31:11] you're not in tonight and then you open
[1:31:13] up the Bible or you turn on a tape or
[1:31:15] you hear a minister get in the pulpit
[1:31:17] and you think why didn't I ever hear
[1:31:18] like that before because you didn't mean
[1:31:21] it like that before
[1:31:23] hey man but the light oh my I'm not
[1:31:25] looking for more light to unfold and has
[1:31:27] already been unfolded but I'm looking to
[1:31:29] walk into more of it than I've walked in
[1:31:31] hey man I don't think we're here to try
[1:31:33] to bring more revelation but I think
[1:31:35] there's a lot of Revelation that was
[1:31:36] brought that we've just scratched the
[1:31:38] surface of hey man so I want to keep
[1:31:41] digging into the revelation David when
[1:31:45] he got out there to fight Goliath you
[1:31:46] know everybody else was looking at the
[1:31:48] size of Goliath and compared to the
[1:31:50] Goliath the David it seemed absolutely
[1:31:52] ridiculous the size difference there and
[1:31:55] no doubt everybody else they'd heard
[1:31:57] this challenge go forth for 39 days and
[1:32:00] brother Brandon teaches us that 40 is
[1:32:01] the number of temptation Moses went up
[1:32:03] into the mountain 40 days Jesus went
[1:32:06] into the wilderness 40 days and so now
[1:32:07] the 40th day this giant has come and
[1:32:10] tempted them and said bring me a man but
[1:32:12] it just so happened to be that that day
[1:32:14] there was a man that had had an
[1:32:16] experience with God and had seen what
[1:32:18] God could do and he said hey if God can
[1:32:20] deliver me from a lion and a bear
[1:32:22] that wasn't even challenged in God they
[1:32:25] were just doing what their own natural
[1:32:27] animalistic instinct was that they
[1:32:29] smelled a sheep and they was hungry and
[1:32:31] they started to go after it they weren't
[1:32:33] challenged in God and rebuking of the
[1:32:35] children of God but here this man stands
[1:32:38] and he's defined the Living God david
[1:32:40] says hey if he delivered me from a lion
[1:32:42] and a bear that was just doing what
[1:32:44] their natural instinct was how much more
[1:32:46] will he deliver me from this
[1:32:48] uncircumcised philistine hey man let me
[1:32:51] say tonight if God brought you out of
[1:32:53] darkness to truth and if these pains are
[1:32:56] bills and he's given you a house
[1:32:57] whatever the whatever Satan has tried to
[1:33:00] come in tonight and rob you of the
[1:33:02] same God that can deliver you from the
[1:33:05] lion and the bear he's the same God
[1:33:07] tonight amen we put our testimonies back
[1:33:14] in the past if we're not careful all he
[1:33:15] did this for me back then but I want to
[1:33:17] tell you many of us if we live to be
[1:33:20] much older at all our best testimonies
[1:33:22] are in the future not in the past
[1:33:24] amen some of our best victories have God
[1:33:27] Terry's there in the future brother
[1:33:29] Jack's why because there's a brother in
[1:33:31] my church says it just keeps getting
[1:33:33] gooder and gooder I mean I know that's
[1:33:36] not proper English but I like it it just
[1:33:38] keeps getting gooder and gooder I mean
[1:33:41] that's how I feel about the Word of God
[1:33:43] hey man is so David but see everybody
[1:33:46] else looked at the size of Goliath and
[1:33:48] the size of David and it looked
[1:33:50] ridiculous but David wasn't worried
[1:33:52] about comparing his size with Goliath
[1:33:54] size he was comparing Goliath size to
[1:33:57] God size and compared to God Goliath was
[1:34:00] pretty puny I mean that's the problem
[1:34:03] with us many times we compared well you
[1:34:06] know this brother over here the brother
[1:34:08] Jack he's the pastor he's probably a
[1:34:10] better prayer warrior than I am and
[1:34:11] sister saw us over here she probably
[1:34:14] lives a better life than me but oh I
[1:34:15] know I'm a better Christian than brother
[1:34:17] so-and-so though because I know he don't
[1:34:19] make it to church near as much as I do
[1:34:21] and I've seen when the basket comes
[1:34:22] around he don't even put no money in the
[1:34:24] offering plate and ice I'm out here you
[1:34:26] know talking to some worldly woman the
[1:34:27] other day and so I know I'm a better
[1:34:29] Christian than him we begin to look
[1:34:31] around and compare our size to everybody
[1:34:33] else's amen but I'm not here to compare
[1:34:36] my anointing with some other ministers
[1:34:38] anointing or to compare my ministry with
[1:34:41] somebody else's ministry or compare my
[1:34:43] Christianity with somebody else's
[1:34:45] Christianity why I'm not depending on
[1:34:48] any of that I'm depending on Jesus
[1:34:50] Christ amen he's bigger than my problems
[1:34:53] he's bigger than my trials he's bigger
[1:34:56] than the Giants that are standing in my
[1:34:59] hey man stop comparing everything to
[1:35:02] your sis to yourself or to your church
[1:35:04] start to your pastor to the Deacons or
[1:35:06] whatever and compare it to Jesus Christ
[1:35:09] hey man whatever he says do it we'll get
[1:35:12] to it eventually
[1:35:13] whatever he says do it and this young
[1:35:17] man recognizes my friend can turn water
[1:35:21] into wine a little while later they're
[1:35:25] traveling through the city of nain and
[1:35:27] here comes a widowed woman this lost her
[1:35:30] son and they're packing the casket out
[1:35:32] there and she's mourning and weeping and
[1:35:34] and and his friend didn't stop and have
[1:35:36] a prayer meeting he didn't he didn't try
[1:35:39] to whip up a bunch of dancing and
[1:35:41] running and jumping although hey I'm all
[1:35:43] for dancing and running and jumping if
[1:35:45] it's the Holy Spirit
[1:35:46] I'm just not for working it up when it's
[1:35:48] not him amen you can tell when it's
[1:35:50] salmon when it's not him hey man you can
[1:35:52] tell when he's here and every service is
[1:35:54] not the same amen tomorrow morning Lord
[1:35:56] willin if he tarries we're gonna have
[1:35:58] another service in the morning it won't
[1:35:59] be the same as tonight hey man that
[1:36:02] don't mean it'll be better or worse it
[1:36:03] just means what the specific anointing
[1:36:05] for a service God hasn't planned and if
[1:36:08] we're not careful
[1:36:08] oh my remember remember last year those
[1:36:11] services we had brother Jack why didn't
[1:36:14] you invite that brother to come again
[1:36:16] and then if the Lord tarries another
[1:36:19] year all my remember when brother Nathan
[1:36:20] was here why'd you invite this other
[1:36:22] brother why didn't you have him back
[1:36:24] because the Lord had ordained for the
[1:36:26] time and the service what was supposed
[1:36:28] to be and sometimes brother Solomon will
[1:36:31] get up and sing your favorite song and
[1:36:32] sometimes he'll get up and sing somebody
[1:36:34] else's favorite song and sometimes it
[1:36:37] won't be your favorite song sometimes
[1:36:39] it'll be your favorite piano player an
[1:36:40] organ player in the next service it
[1:36:42] might not be your favorite but you know
[1:36:43] what God had something specific ordained
[1:36:46] for that service and I believe he has
[1:36:48] something specific ordained for tonight
[1:36:50] so whatever it would be god we can't
[1:36:53] compare service to service and revival
[1:36:55] to revival but God has sometimes it's
[1:36:57] running and jumping and shouting and
[1:36:58] sometimes it's a still small voice and
[1:37:00] you just lift your hand and wait to God
[1:37:02] and and you know we don't compare all
[1:37:04] those things he doesn't always come
[1:37:06] sometimes he comes like a mighty rushing
[1:37:08] he did that on the day of Pentecost we
[1:37:10] thank God for that and sometimes it's a
[1:37:12] still small voice amen and we should be
[1:37:15] able to rejoice that one just as much as
[1:37:17] the other it's the same God hey man
[1:37:20] that's why we still you know I I know
[1:37:21] it's not popular around the message but
[1:37:23] I still believe in a God called ministry
[1:37:25] and not just my favorite office or not
[1:37:28] just my favorite preacher and not just
[1:37:30] my favorite personality but I believe
[1:37:32] it's a many membered body not just five
[1:37:35] ministering gifts but nine spiritual
[1:37:37] gifts and many different gifts that that
[1:37:39] God places into the body brother Graham
[1:37:40] said even as a housewife has a ministry
[1:37:43] so don't let the devil belittle you and
[1:37:45] your place in the kingdom of God tonight
[1:37:47] each one of us has a part to put in but
[1:37:50] I thank God for a 5-volt ministry
[1:37:52] because some people you know they they
[1:37:54] feed on teaching and some people get
[1:37:55] stirred up by preaching and some people
[1:37:57] you know we'd grow different ways but
[1:37:59] yet we all can be blessed by different
[1:38:01] types of ministries and different types
[1:38:03] of seasons and are in our life and
[1:38:05] different things that we're going
[1:38:06] through sometimes we need just some good
[1:38:08] solid teaching of the word to stabilize
[1:38:11] us and balance us out
[1:38:12] oh it may not make us want to run and
[1:38:14] jump but it'll ground us in the word
[1:38:16] amen so God sends different gifts our
[1:38:18] way and I thank God for him Jesus just
[1:38:22] walks along and all he did brother Jack
[1:38:24] was just touched the casket oh my I wish
[1:38:29] he'd touched some caskets around some
[1:38:31] message churches some people is dead and
[1:38:35] sins and trespasses they come into
[1:38:38] church and they're there they're
[1:38:39] physically present but it looks like
[1:38:41] somebody just propped them up against
[1:38:42] the wall or later mount in the chair you
[1:38:47] can count them you know well we had this
[1:38:49] many people here tonight but I don't
[1:38:51] want to count the dead ones I just want
[1:38:52] to count the ones that are alive and
[1:38:54] they came to church
[1:38:56] and that want to be there hey man I
[1:38:59] don't care you know I don't care nothing
[1:39:01] about just fill in pews you know we've
[1:39:02] got some people that come to church in
[1:39:03] about five minutes in doesn't matter how
[1:39:08] hard up reach how loud I preach how
[1:39:10] quiet I preach how slow or how fast I
[1:39:12] preach they're gonna be out well they're
[1:39:14] warming a seat but I don't know how much
[1:39:16] they're getting out of it
[1:39:17] hey man notice somebody might say wake
[1:39:20] up God's here tonight amen nobody it
[1:39:27] doesn't matter that brother Nathan's
[1:39:29] here it matters that God is here tonight
[1:39:32] hey man I don't want to just warm a seat
[1:39:35] but I want to put something into the
[1:39:37] service some brothers came through
[1:39:39] recently and one of the brothers was
[1:39:41] telling a story and he said there was a
[1:39:43] man and his son came into the church and
[1:39:46] he said they passed the offering plate
[1:39:47] and said a man put in a dollar and they
[1:39:50] passed it on different people putting in
[1:39:52] different things when the service was
[1:39:53] over he said the Deacons was walking out
[1:39:55] with the offering plate and the man
[1:39:56] didn't like what the preacher preached
[1:39:58] he said he reached over and he took that
[1:40:00] dollar bill back out of the offering
[1:40:01] plate and the little boy looked at it
[1:40:02] and said daddy he said what son said if
[1:40:05] you were to put more in you would have
[1:40:06] got more out you can take that either
[1:40:13] way you were talking about offerings
[1:40:15] they're talking about just into the
[1:40:16] service but if you come to the service
[1:40:18] and you sit there like a bump on a log
[1:40:19] and you won't raise your hands and
[1:40:21] praise them and you won't say thank you
[1:40:23] Jesus for hallelujah or amen
[1:40:27] you go out at church do you think oh I
[1:40:29] didn't get very much out of the service
[1:40:31] tonight well why didn't you put more in
[1:40:33] hey man don't depend on brother Jack or
[1:40:36] brother Nathan her brother let's go to
[1:40:37] do all the work but you got to put
[1:40:40] something in - oh Jesus did was just lay
[1:40:46] his hand on the casket and a dead man
[1:40:49] set up you know we never can find in
[1:40:51] Scripture or history wherever Jesus
[1:40:53] attended a funeral when they actually
[1:40:56] got to the end of the funeral
[1:40:57] hey man every funeral he attended it was
[1:41:00] no longer a funeral that was a
[1:41:01] celebration this young man says my
[1:41:08] friend can raise the dead he's sitting
[1:41:11] there on the hillside and it's a hot day
[1:41:13] and they're out in the wilderness and
[1:41:15] he's listening to his friend teach and
[1:41:16] he's amazed to hear this young man that
[1:41:20] he grew up with sit there and and break
[1:41:23] down the word in a way that the common
[1:41:24] people could understand and he's sitting
[1:41:27] there and and the people begin to get a
[1:41:28] little restless and and Jesus turns he
[1:41:31] asked the disciples he said have you got
[1:41:32] anything to feed the people I love when
[1:41:34] Jesus asks a question like that because
[1:41:36] he already knows the answer but he just
[1:41:39] wants to see how we'll respond and in
[1:41:41] fact any any question that Jesus asked
[1:41:44] is really a rhetorical question he
[1:41:46] doesn't need you to tell him the answer
[1:41:48] he already knows the answer hey man have
[1:41:52] we got enough to feed him Philip he said
[1:41:54] all my said well you know we don't
[1:41:57] really have anything there's not there's
[1:41:58] not any grocery stores nearby if we did
[1:42:00] we don't have the money to buy the food
[1:42:02] he said all we got one little boy played
[1:42:04] hooky from school and he's got a couple
[1:42:06] loaves and a couple pieces of fish and
[1:42:08] Jesus said bring that here and he begins
[1:42:10] to take it and break the bread you see
[1:42:11] many times we got to think we've got to
[1:42:13] do some great big something or as Lord
[1:42:15] with I can just get to this point in my
[1:42:16] life spiritually or if I can just quit
[1:42:18] this or I can just do that all right
[1:42:20] then I'll really be a good Christian of
[1:42:22] mine you know if I could do enough works
[1:42:25] to be a really good Christian then Jesus
[1:42:27] Christ died in vain now I believe when
[1:42:29] we recognize what Jesus Christ did for
[1:42:32] us it'll produce works in our life
[1:42:33] because we love him so much
[1:42:35] that we want to do something for him
[1:42:37] don't get me
[1:42:38] I'm not just throwing works completely
[1:42:39] out tonight but if you're trying to work
[1:42:41] your way in you're putting the cart
[1:42:43] before the horse because if you could
[1:42:45] have worked your way in then the
[1:42:46] Pharisees have had it right in Jesus
[1:42:48] didn't a man it wasn't working your way
[1:42:51] in but this little boy he didn't have
[1:42:52] much to offer but when he gave it to
[1:42:54] Jesus Jesus was able to accomplish some
[1:42:57] more with it than he could have ever
[1:42:58] imagined and maybe you don't have much
[1:43:01] to offer tonight but give it to Jesus
[1:43:03] one time and see what he can do with it
[1:43:06] he begins to take and break this fish
[1:43:09] and his friend would sit there and watch
[1:43:10] maybe he would peek through the crowd
[1:43:11] and see nudges sister see did you see
[1:43:14] that my friend can multiply creation
[1:43:17] amen you know people get scared today
[1:43:20] they question you know squirrels being
[1:43:22] smoking to existence and things like
[1:43:23] that but yeah we find out how did the
[1:43:26] first one get here hey man if you can't
[1:43:31] believe in squirrels being spoken to the
[1:43:32] existence you'd have a hard time when
[1:43:34] God said Let there be squirrels you'd
[1:43:40] have a hard time you say oh I don't
[1:43:41] believe in no fish being resurrected
[1:43:42] you'd have a hard time when there was no
[1:43:44] fish and God's saying let there be fish
[1:43:45] oh I don't believe a possum could be
[1:43:47] healed I don't think God would do
[1:43:49] something like that and care about
[1:43:50] something that's so insignificant you'd
[1:43:52] have a hard time when God said there
[1:43:53] wasn't no opossums on the whole world
[1:43:55] and God said let there be a possum God
[1:43:58] why would you care to create a possum
[1:44:00] you know there's a lot of things I don't
[1:44:01] understand I don't understand why
[1:44:02] created spiders I don't understand it
[1:44:04] but he did it I don't understand why he
[1:44:07] created snakes sister Sara but he did it
[1:44:09] so there's a purpose and a reason behind
[1:44:11] it somewhere hey man I'm not gonna
[1:44:13] question him I just don't understand it
[1:44:15] all oh my friend can multiply on
[1:44:21] creation he here's a story where they're
[1:44:24] out the disciples are out there fishing
[1:44:25] and Jesus just come he didn't have a
[1:44:28] boat he didn't have a jetski he didn't
[1:44:30] have anything he just comes walking
[1:44:32] across the water he says my friend can
[1:44:34] walk on water he hears about him
[1:44:36] crossing a stormy sea - again answer it
[1:44:39] Jesus had - he had created the fish and
[1:44:42] the loaves multiplied creation now he
[1:44:44] gets in the boat and he goes to the
[1:44:45] other side of the sea you know and I
[1:44:47] find it so funny you know we got a lot
[1:44:49] of people like that around the message
[1:44:50] still today
[1:44:51] the the the Pharisees all they took out
[1:44:54] of that story if you go back and read
[1:44:55] the scriptures when 5,000 people was fed
[1:44:58] by one little boys lunch and what they
[1:45:02] took away from the from the story if you
[1:45:03] read the very next three verses is Jesus
[1:45:06] why didn't your disciples wash their
[1:45:09] hands out there before they fed all
[1:45:13] those people before they ate you know
[1:45:15] they was hinting that was so unsanitary
[1:45:17] they was handing out bread and fish in
[1:45:20] the desert and didn't even wash their
[1:45:22] hands the way that our tradition says
[1:45:24] that they have to oh isn't it sad that a
[1:45:27] lot of people still today have that same
[1:45:28] mentality about the Word of God they
[1:45:31] want to nitpick little things well why
[1:45:33] didn't you do it this way and why don't
[1:45:34] you and yet the supernatural being done
[1:45:38] and he gets in the boat he's tired he's
[1:45:41] prayed for the sick he's multiplied
[1:45:43] creation he's going over to pray for a
[1:45:45] demon-possessed man across the way and
[1:45:47] he gets in the boat and the devil tries
[1:45:49] to drown him and the disciples a storm
[1:45:50] comes up and they tell him they said if
[1:45:52] you would have been there said mine
[1:45:54] never seen anything like I said he just
[1:45:55] put his foot up on the side of the boat
[1:45:57] and he didn't scream he didn't he didn't
[1:46:00] get mad he just said peace be still and
[1:46:02] the winds and the waves obeyed him he
[1:46:05] said he said that's my friend my friend
[1:46:08] can stop the storms my friend can calm
[1:46:12] storms he can calm troubled seas they
[1:46:15] talking about when they got over and he
[1:46:17] prayed for leaves and a man that was out
[1:46:19] in the in the tombs cutting himself
[1:46:20] began to be free sand my friend can
[1:46:23] can't but can cast out Devils and he's
[1:46:27] standing there with him one day and and
[1:46:29] they the the Pharisees you know they
[1:46:31] thought for sure they'd catch him and
[1:46:33] this one they brought a woman caught in
[1:46:34] the very act of adultery and threw down
[1:46:36] at his feet and said hey what do you
[1:46:37] think we should do with their Moses law
[1:46:39] says stoner he said that's right
[1:46:40] and he used without first without sin
[1:46:43] pick up the first stone there he was the
[1:46:45] only one that could have really picked
[1:46:47] up a stone being without sin but yet he
[1:46:49] turns around he says where are thy
[1:46:50] accusers she said I have none he said
[1:46:53] neither do I accuse you go and sin no
[1:46:55] more and he sits there he says my friend
[1:46:58] can forgive sins
[1:47:02] and all of a sudden he begins to get
[1:47:05] sick now he has seen this friend cast
[1:47:09] out devils heal the sick raise the dead
[1:47:11] and he begins to get sick and he tells
[1:47:14] his sisters he says listen he said I I
[1:47:17] don't know where my friends at I haven't
[1:47:20] been able to find him but said the
[1:47:22] doctor says there's no hope for me the
[1:47:25] doctor says there's nothing they can do
[1:47:27] I've tried medicines
[1:47:28] I've tried chiropractors I've tried all
[1:47:31] kinds of different things and the
[1:47:32] doctors all say the same thing there's
[1:47:34] no hope and I don't know where he's at
[1:47:35] in revival but you go and you try to
[1:47:37] find him because you know what he could
[1:47:39] tell him he said look as a little boy as
[1:47:41] a teenager as a young man there's been
[1:47:44] many times that I've let him down by the
[1:47:46] Westco but he said but my friend has
[1:47:48] never let me down I mean that's my
[1:47:50] testimony tonight brother Jack I don't
[1:47:53] stand up here perfect before you there
[1:47:55] have been many times that I've let him
[1:47:57] down but he's never let me down and so
[1:48:01] he gets sicker and sicker his lungs
[1:48:03] begin to fill with blood brother Brennan
[1:48:04] tells us in several different places
[1:48:06] that that he died of tuberculosis and
[1:48:08] that a hemorrhage a hemorrhaging of the
[1:48:10] lungs is what he said historian's told
[1:48:12] us that that actually killed him and so
[1:48:15] he gets he gets sicker and sicker they
[1:48:17] can't find him anywhere and and he
[1:48:20] begins to cough and coughing up blood
[1:48:21] and he's laying there and he's slowly
[1:48:23] beginning to die and he begins to fade
[1:48:25] in and out of consciousness and as he
[1:48:27] comes back to himself
[1:48:28] have you found my friend no we haven't
[1:48:31] found him it's okay it's not too late
[1:48:32] yet my friend has never let me down he's
[1:48:36] never been late he's never failed me
[1:48:39] he's never failed me it's not too late
[1:48:45] there is coughing up blood and then
[1:48:48] bringing him some more towels and things
[1:48:49] and coughing up more blood it's not too
[1:48:52] late brother Troy he ain't let me down I
[1:48:55] don't care how sick I am I don't care
[1:48:58] what the symptoms look like I don't care
[1:48:59] what the doctor says he's never let me
[1:49:02] down he's never failed me he gets sicker
[1:49:07] and sicker and as he regains
[1:49:10] consciousness the last time it maybe he
[1:49:12] means to think I don't understand I
[1:49:14] don't understand I thought for sure he'd
[1:49:16] be here by now I don't think I can hold
[1:49:18] on much longer I thought he would be
[1:49:20] here by now and he goes and he dies and
[1:49:23] his sisters have looked everywhere they
[1:49:26] sent out the 70 looking for the
[1:49:28] disciples they couldn't find him nowhere
[1:49:30] couldn't find Jesus nowhere and he
[1:49:33] doesn't know they don't know what what
[1:49:35] happened but then they think it's gonna
[1:49:37] be all right
[1:49:37] I remember I remember the widow's boy in
[1:49:41] nain you remember that Martha you
[1:49:43] remember all he did he didn't even pray
[1:49:45] he didn't preach the funeral he didn't
[1:49:47] do nothing he just laid his hand on the
[1:49:48] casket it's not too late Mary it's not
[1:49:51] too late maybe he'll get back in time to
[1:49:53] preach the funeral and there won't be no
[1:49:55] funeral and they're waiting I don't know
[1:50:00] who got up and preached the funeral but
[1:50:01] if they're waiting and they turn around
[1:50:02] look and they're not hearing anything
[1:50:04] that he said it's a funeral I doubt
[1:50:05] brother Westco they're looking around
[1:50:07] waiting for that back door to open and
[1:50:09] Jesus come walking in and say it's all
[1:50:11] right your friends here but he didn't
[1:50:16] come he didn't come brothers Roy and
[1:50:19] they take him and they put him they put
[1:50:23] him in this tomb and they they roll a
[1:50:26] stone over it and they could sit there
[1:50:28] and remember different things that
[1:50:31] Lazarus had told him about his friend he
[1:50:32] said my friends the only one that can
[1:50:36] say I always do that which pleases the
[1:50:38] father he was the only one I don't say
[1:50:41] it to belittle anybody but Moses st.
[1:50:43] Paul brother branham you mean nobody
[1:50:46] could ever say I always do that which
[1:50:48] pleases the father except this man's
[1:50:50] friend
[1:50:51] amen you might think you can say it but
[1:50:53] your wife will kick you in the shins and
[1:50:54] call you a liar he was the only one that
[1:51:01] could say I have power to lay my life
[1:51:03] down I have power to take it back up
[1:51:05] again he was the only one that can say
[1:51:07] it he was the only one that could say I
[1:51:10] am the resurrection and the life and
[1:51:13] they waited and made
[1:51:15] maybe they were sitting there reading
[1:51:16] the scriptures brother Jack and they
[1:51:18] they begin to talk to one another said
[1:51:21] you know I don't understand there's been
[1:51:25] times we've had sickness in our family
[1:51:26] there's been times we've had financial
[1:51:28] troubles there's been times you know we
[1:51:30] were arguing and bickering back and
[1:51:31] forth and our friend always showed up
[1:51:33] and just knew exactly what to do and
[1:51:35] exactly what to say and here he is and
[1:51:37] he's not he's not here yet and here our
[1:51:40] brother lays in the grave and they began
[1:51:42] maybe they picked up a scroll and they
[1:51:44] begin to read over in the Psalms and
[1:51:46] David said I'll not suffer my Holy One
[1:51:48] to see corruption they said oh so here
[1:51:50] we go brother Troy there's still hope
[1:51:52] left there's still hope yet it hasn't
[1:51:55] been 72 hours yet and corruption hasn't
[1:51:58] set in maybe he'll come and he'll raise
[1:52:01] him from the dead before corruption sets
[1:52:03] in and he's not too late yet fourth day
[1:52:07] all hope is gone never you go back
[1:52:12] through all the history of the Bible all
[1:52:13] there'd been a dead man they threw in on
[1:52:15] the bones of Elijah one time he was just
[1:52:17] freshly dead a knee raised there was
[1:52:19] different ones that raised from the dead
[1:52:20] but there was never one Jesus raised
[1:52:22] several from the dead the the one there
[1:52:25] that we just talked about the little boy
[1:52:27] that in cane the widow's son that he
[1:52:29] prayed for but never had anybody ever
[1:52:31] been dead for days and come back all
[1:52:36] hope was gone he's too late our friend
[1:52:39] let us stand I don't understand and here
[1:52:42] he comes walking down the road four days
[1:52:45] late and they came to me and said we
[1:52:47] don't understand if you'd been here our
[1:52:49] brother wouldn't daddy sit on he said
[1:52:51] it's okay your brother all rise again
[1:52:55] they said all we know we know Lord he'll
[1:52:57] rise in the in the resurrection you know
[1:52:59] they weren't Sadducees they were looking
[1:53:01] for a resurrection said all mine said
[1:53:05] he'll rise again he said no no you don't
[1:53:06] understand I am the resurrection of life
[1:53:10] said where have you laid him but you're
[1:53:14] too late Lord you're too late
[1:53:18] and I can imagine Lazarus here he is a
[1:53:21] four days journey in another dimension
[1:53:24] and he's probably sitting there brothers
[1:53:27] Solomon fellowship one of Abraham and
[1:53:29] Isaac and Jacob and they're telling him
[1:53:31] all about the things that they saw and
[1:53:33] all the things and he begins to tell
[1:53:35] Jobe
[1:53:36] he said you remember that one you said I
[1:53:38] know my redeemer liveth I met him that's
[1:53:41] my friend that's my friend I've
[1:53:44] recognized that's got to be my friend
[1:53:46] ain't nobody been able to do things like
[1:53:49] Jesus has done that's my friend Daniel
[1:53:52] do you remember that one you saw oh
[1:53:54] that's the one that I saw but I saw him
[1:53:56] in the flesh
[1:53:57] you remember Ezekiel that wheel in the
[1:54:00] middle of the wheel I wrote down the
[1:54:02] road with him
[1:54:03] amen oh I say you remember that virgin
[1:54:06] that was going to conceive and bear a
[1:54:08] child and his name was going to be a
[1:54:09] manual I slept right beside him on a
[1:54:13] camping trip Amen God with us God was
[1:54:17] with me in a tent on a camping trip God
[1:54:20] was with me in the back of the boat on a
[1:54:22] fishing trip Emmanuel God with us I used
[1:54:27] to have sleepovers at a Manuel's house
[1:54:33] and they begin to get excited Abraham
[1:54:37] you remember that one you saw at the off
[1:54:38] anybody and you ain't with him that one
[1:54:41] time I you see with him all the time I
[1:54:43] know his favorite fish place and they're
[1:54:51] rejoicing all of a sudden from another
[1:54:53] dimension here it's not not a quiet
[1:54:54] voice like a lot of us when we come to
[1:54:56] church - amen but the scripture said he
[1:54:59] cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[1:55:02] forth and he cried loud enough that
[1:55:04] Lazarus heard him in another dimension
[1:55:07] and all of a sudden these lungs that had
[1:55:09] been filled with tuberculosis and
[1:55:10] hemorrhaging and bleeding a few days
[1:55:12] before all of a sudden air begins to
[1:55:15] breathe back in those lungs and that
[1:55:18] heart that had been dead for four days
[1:55:19] begins to pump and that knows that it
[1:55:22] began to sink in comes back out right
[1:55:23] but he's still bound and he's still in
[1:55:27] the darkness like a lot of us when Jesus
[1:55:30] came by and delivered us but it wasn't
[1:55:32] just enough for him to speak life but he
[1:55:34] said loose him and let him go a man
[1:55:40] that's my friend oh my he's still a
[1:55:45] present help in the time of trouble
[1:55:48] there's a friend that sticketh closer
[1:55:50] than a brother if you don't know him
[1:55:53] that way tonight he can be your friend
[1:55:55] too brother Branham tells us several
[1:55:59] different places I'll read you a couple
[1:56:00] of them he says in one place sight in
[1:56:02] time is God's worst enemy in divine
[1:56:04] healing another time he says time in
[1:56:06] sight is the worst enemies that God has
[1:56:08] time and sight and that's what most of
[1:56:11] us if we'll be honest with ourselves if
[1:56:13] we're not careful we begin to look at
[1:56:15] the clock or look at the symptoms and
[1:56:17] like Lazarus we think Lord has it's been
[1:56:20] too long if he was going to heal me like
[1:56:21] congressman Upshaw that brother Jack was
[1:56:23] talking about their sick for 60 some-odd
[1:56:25] years
[1:56:26] crippled and yet God heals him in his
[1:56:29] 80s why didn't God heal him when he was
[1:56:30] younger because God wanted to be
[1:56:32] glorified in it hey man if he would have
[1:56:35] healed him right away maybe nobody would
[1:56:36] have heard about it but by now this
[1:56:37] man's a congressman he begins to send
[1:56:39] letters to the King of England he begins
[1:56:41] to send letters all around the world to
[1:56:43] other congressmen and leaders of state
[1:56:45] and things and God had a plan in it but
[1:56:48] we if we're not careful we begin to look
[1:56:49] at the clock and we begin to look at the
[1:56:51] symptoms and and that's why the
[1:56:53] scripture tells us that faith is the
[1:56:55] substance of things hoped for the
[1:56:57] evidence of things not seen now when God
[1:56:59] spoke and said let there be there was
[1:57:01] nothing to see but everything that we
[1:57:03] see here tonight came from something
[1:57:05] that was nothing you say well you know
[1:57:08] somebody formed this wood together and
[1:57:11] somebody put the metal together and all
[1:57:12] that but if you take it back to its raw
[1:57:14] materials everything that we see whether
[1:57:16] it's a person or I
[1:57:17] house or a car or a tree or whatever it
[1:57:19] be an animal at one point in time it was
[1:57:22] smoke from nothing and then the seeds of
[1:57:25] what we see today whether it be animal
[1:57:27] life or plant life or human life all
[1:57:29] those seeds were in those originals that
[1:57:31] God said let there be and there was and
[1:57:33] so when it many times when we look we
[1:57:36] look to the scene instead of looking to
[1:57:38] the unseen we look at the doctor
[1:57:41] statements my if that little girl would
[1:57:43] have just looked at the x-rays she
[1:57:45] wouldn't have been two inches taller
[1:57:46] tonight she wouldn't have had a normal
[1:57:48] sign tonight but they didn't just look
[1:57:50] to the x-ray they look to Jehovah Jireh
[1:57:53] amen so we find that God brother Ben
[1:57:56] tells us God can correct all wrong if
[1:57:59] anything's wrong he can make it right
[1:58:03] amen that's a big statement but we serve
[1:58:05] a big God if anything's wrong God can
[1:58:09] make it right now I know we're
[1:58:10] emphasizing on physical healing tonight
[1:58:12] but I want to say if you have emotional
[1:58:14] scars we got a lot of those around the
[1:58:18] message too don't we brother Troy people
[1:58:21] got hurt by their family by some little
[1:58:23] school friend that they used to play
[1:58:24] with that got made fun of some type of
[1:58:27] work situation or some church situation
[1:58:29] some church leader hurt them or let them
[1:58:31] down or disappointed them and people
[1:58:33] pack around scars all the time and they
[1:58:36] can't move on and can't forgive and
[1:58:38] can't grow in God because of emotional
[1:58:40] scars but if God if there's anything
[1:58:42] wrong God can make it right I mean
[1:58:46] that's not just for broken bones and
[1:58:48] cancer but anything that's wrong mental
[1:58:52] problems children born with mental
[1:58:53] problems I believe God can heal bands
[1:58:55] he's if he can heal the body he can heal
[1:58:58] the mind he can heal the family he can
[1:59:01] heal the finances he can heal the
[1:59:03] emotions if
[1:59:05] anything's wrong he can make it right
[1:59:08] again he tells us what the devil done
[1:59:11] any time God can take it away so
[1:59:15] whatever condition you're in tonight
[1:59:16] well the Satan allowed this to happen in
[1:59:19] my life and Satan allowed this to happen
[1:59:20] in my family and Satan allowed this back
[1:59:23] in my past all this anything what the
[1:59:25] devil done anytime God can take it away
[1:59:30] Moses tells us that he's the Lord that
[1:59:34] healeth thee David tells us bless the
[1:59:38] Lord O my soul and forget not all his
[1:59:39] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:59:41] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:59:44] you see it's always been a dual
[1:59:47] atonement the same God that can forgive
[1:59:49] thine iniquities can heal your diseases
[1:59:52] David didn't just say that Isaiah came
[1:59:55] and said he was wounded for our
[1:59:56] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:59:58] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:00:00] was upon him and with this stripes we
[2:00:03] are healed not we might be healed not I
[2:00:06] hope we'll be here we are healed whether
[2:00:09] you can physically see it or not tonight
[2:00:11] you are healed not because brother
[2:00:14] Nathan might lay hands on you in a few
[2:00:16] minutes or because some of these
[2:00:17] brothers are gonna say a prayer over you
[2:00:19] in a few minutes or because we've got a
[2:00:20] prayer cloth as acts 19 tells us or
[2:00:23] anointing oil as James tells us in James
[2:00:25] chapter 5 none of though that's just
[2:00:27] obedience to God's Word that's not what
[2:00:29] heals you that just builds your faith to
[2:00:32] accept what God already did for you by
[2:00:35] His stripes you are already healed and
[2:00:38] James tells us is there any sick among
[2:00:40] you let him call for the elders of the
[2:00:42] church let them pray over him anointing
[2:00:43] him with oil in the name of the Lord and
[2:00:46] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[2:00:48] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[2:00:51] he have committed any sins they shall be
[2:00:53] forgiven him so it's a dual atonement
[2:00:58] forgiveness of sins and healing how many
[2:01:00] times when Jesus prayed for somebody and
[2:01:02] they was sick did he say go and sin no
[2:01:04] more or less the worst thing come upon
[2:01:06] you so we find you don't have to be a
[2:01:08] Christian to be healed but you have to
[2:01:10] be a Christian to stay healed now
[2:01:13] brother min tells us again in deep
[2:01:15] calling to the deep in 1956 he said
[2:01:17] people
[2:01:18] for healing of the body to be so
[2:01:19] complicated it's very simple just taking
[2:01:23] God at His Word just saying the same
[2:01:25] thing that he does that's all we may get
[2:01:29] some big complicated thing all brother
[2:01:30] so-and-so would just come and pray for
[2:01:32] me or all this could just happen or God
[2:01:34] if you could just show me a sign or if I
[2:01:36] could just my symptoms could just get a
[2:01:38] little better then I could believe in be
[2:01:40] healed no healing isn't complicated it's
[2:01:43] just taking him at his word he said that
[2:01:46] you're healed so you are healed no
[2:01:49] matter what the doctor said no matter
[2:01:51] what I say or anybody else says you're
[2:01:53] healed because his word says that you're
[2:01:55] healed now whether you're gonna see the
[2:01:57] manifestation of it or not depends on
[2:01:59] whether you can take him at his word or
[2:02:01] not but you're already healed if you can
[2:02:04] accept it let me say this tonight God
[2:02:10] loves you not because of anything he can
[2:02:13] show you or give you he loves you
[2:02:14] because he said he loves you and no
[2:02:17] matter what anybody else says or no
[2:02:19] matter what you convinced yourself of
[2:02:20] that all I've gone too far I've made too
[2:02:22] many mistakes or I just don't think he
[2:02:24] could love somebody like me he loves you
[2:02:27] because he said he loves you that's the
[2:02:31] proof of his love a man if God blesses
[2:02:34] me with a bigger car or a nicer house or
[2:02:37] more money in the bank account or more
[2:02:39] health in my body that is wonderful and
[2:02:41] I appreciate that but that doesn't prove
[2:02:43] his love to me his love has already
[2:02:45] proved because he said he loved me and
[2:02:47] either I take him at his word or I don't
[2:02:50] and that's the same for healing for
[2:02:52] salvation for whatever you have need of
[2:02:54] tonight either you take God at His Word
[2:02:56] tonight and you walk out of here healed
[2:02:58] either you take him at his word tonight
[2:03:00] you walk out of here save you take him
[2:03:03] at his word tonight and you walk out of
[2:03:04] here with peace and victory or you doubt
[2:03:06] his word you go out and well I'm still
[2:03:08] nervous I'm still upset I'm still
[2:03:11] depressed I'm still sick I still got
[2:03:13] this cough I still got this ache I still
[2:03:15] got this pain why brother Nathan because
[2:03:17] you didn't take him at his word again
[2:03:20] brother Graham tells us if you've got
[2:03:22] faith enough to walk across the floor to
[2:03:25] walk across that floor you've faith
[2:03:27] enough for anything God promised
[2:03:29] if you got faith enough to raise up your
[2:03:32] hand why you've got faith enough for
[2:03:34] anything else it's simple faith now I
[2:03:36] don't have I don't claim to have
[2:03:37] SuperDuper faith I don't claim to be
[2:03:40] some great mighty magnificent faith
[2:03:43] warrior but I do have enough faith
[2:03:44] tonight by the grace of God to walk
[2:03:46] across the floor you didn't think I had
[2:03:51] faith enough to do it did you
[2:03:54] I've got enough faith why because I've
[2:03:57] done it before I've walked across the
[2:03:58] floor before I've done it brother Jack I
[2:04:01] don't have to wonder now careful these
[2:04:03] legs I'm not sure if they work right or
[2:04:04] not
[2:04:05] here's the floor does this floor move do
[2:04:07] you have it on a tilt just against there
[2:04:08] is a ring gonna spin around or are we
[2:04:11] gonna drop 50 feet what is it no I've
[2:04:13] walked across this floor before in fact
[2:04:16] brother Jackson I don't know why he puts
[2:04:17] up with me but he's been inviting me
[2:04:19] back for years I've walked across this
[2:04:21] floor many times sometimes I've walked
[2:04:23] back and forth across it so many times
[2:04:25] I've probably made some of you nervous
[2:04:27] but I have faith that I can do it
[2:04:30] because I've experienced it before and
[2:04:31] if you if you've been healed before or
[2:04:34] you've seen God heal somebody before
[2:04:36] then you know that he's more than able
[2:04:39] you know that he's able so why don't you
[2:04:42] put your faith in action and say hey I
[2:04:44] believe it tonight I have faith to
[2:04:45] receive it tonight if you've got faith
[2:04:48] enough to walk across the floor you got
[2:04:49] faith enough for that if you got faith
[2:04:51] enough to raise your hand now you have
[2:04:53] to you know you know unless you've got
[2:04:55] some serious muscle or or some type of
[2:05:01] problems nerve problems or whatever it
[2:05:02] be I don't think there's anybody in here
[2:05:04] that just raises their hand
[2:05:05] involuntarily if so then you're probably
[2:05:07] encouraging the pastor because you just
[2:05:09] every once a while
[2:05:09] raise your hand like that but I don't
[2:05:12] think there's anybody in here tonight
[2:05:13] that just involuntarily raises their
[2:05:15] hand so if you're gonna raise your hand
[2:05:19] it takes a conscious thought and there
[2:05:21] has to be a spirit inside of you that
[2:05:23] has life that's able to make that that
[2:05:26] conscious thought go through and and the
[2:05:29] neurons in your brain begin to fire they
[2:05:31] send they send messages to the nerves
[2:05:34] and to the muscles in your body and you
[2:05:37] don't have to sit there and think about
[2:05:38] it and work it up and say Lord it's been
[2:05:40] about three hours since I raised this
[2:05:42] left
[2:05:42] armen I sure hope it still works I don't
[2:05:45] know now let's see the word said this
[2:05:46] and brother Jack teaches this and
[2:05:48] science says this and and history says
[2:05:51] that and my mommy and my daddy taught me
[2:05:52] this sigh I guess I hope that my arm
[2:05:55] still works to raise it you don't have
[2:05:58] to work it up and figure it all out you
[2:05:59] just raise your hand because your brain
[2:06:01] told you to and you've experienced it
[2:06:03] before you know that those muscles work
[2:06:05] and the arm works and your mind tells
[2:06:07] your body to do it and it's not it
[2:06:09] doesn't take a lot of conscious thought
[2:06:10] you just do it praise God that's how
[2:06:14] healing is Lord I take you at your word
[2:06:16] Lord I accept what you did for me I
[2:06:19] don't gotta figure it all out I don't
[2:06:21] gotta work it out I don't have to take
[2:06:24] science and history in the Bible and put
[2:06:26] them all together and come out with some
[2:06:27] equation to be healed I'm healed because
[2:06:30] he said so he says right out in front of
[2:06:35] you stands a person just like he was a
[2:06:37] few minutes ago you were sit down here
[2:06:40] but there's a well person standing there
[2:06:43] Jesus Christ is calling to that well
[2:06:46] person right beyond it now you just by
[2:06:49] faith as you close your eyes walk right
[2:06:51] into that well body see then just keep
[2:06:54] on walking just keep on going now we had
[2:06:58] a prayer line I'm not gonna do it here
[2:06:59] tonight but we had a prayer line a few
[2:07:01] weeks to go to our church and I read
[2:07:03] this whole brother Jack and I told the
[2:07:04] church I said now I'm not gonna lay
[2:07:06] hands on you tonight because I don't
[2:07:07] want anybody be able to say well brother
[2:07:08] Nathan laid hands I mean this is what it
[2:07:09] was
[2:07:10] but I told him I said you just
[2:07:11] visualized that well body and you start
[2:07:13] over here and you walk your way into it
[2:07:15] and when you get there you just say Lord
[2:07:17] that's my well body I'm walking into and
[2:07:19] I'm gonna keep on walking and you just
[2:07:20] imagine Jesus on the other side saying
[2:07:22] come on into this well body and we had
[2:07:24] people walk by and people started
[2:07:26] screaming and shouting and some of them
[2:07:27] was healed instantly I didn't touch them
[2:07:30] but something touched him amen he
[2:07:32] touched him or they touched the hem of
[2:07:34] His garment
[2:07:35] he tells us just take a little mental
[2:07:38] trip now and remember imagine sing the
[2:07:41] Lord Jesus walking right down the aisle
[2:07:43] standing there by the side of you now
[2:07:47] let's be honest we've been taught that
[2:07:50] he has no hands but our hands and no
[2:07:52] letters but our lips no feet but our
[2:07:54] feet if he's gonna do something he's
[2:07:56] gonna do it through the body but let's
[2:07:57] be honest tonight if it wasn't me your
[2:07:59] brother West or brother Jack here
[2:08:00] tonight but Jesus of Nazareth came
[2:08:02] walking in the door and walked around
[2:08:04] and came up the back aisle and stood
[2:08:06] right beside you and put his hand on you
[2:08:09] and said I want to heal you more than
[2:08:12] you want to be healed you'd have a
[2:08:14] shouting fit right here you'd have a
[2:08:18] shouting fit so why don't we do it why
[2:08:20] don't we accept our healing like that
[2:08:22] because we don't take him at his word
[2:08:24] the way that we should but he said
[2:08:28] imagine Jesus coming walking down the
[2:08:31] background stand and besides you and
[2:08:33] saying my child child of mine I want to
[2:08:39] heal you more than you want to be healed
[2:08:42] now we've heard him say that he wants
[2:08:45] that God wants us to have the Holy Ghost
[2:08:46] more than we want to receive it but here
[2:08:50] he's saying he Jesus Christ is standing
[2:08:52] there saying child of mine I want to
[2:08:55] heal you more than you want to be healed
[2:08:57] now how many tonight whether it's
[2:09:00] physical emotional mental family
[2:09:02] whatever it is how many needs healing in
[2:09:04] their life some form of healing you want
[2:09:08] the healing you really want it he wants
[2:09:13] you to have it more than you want it his
[2:09:16] desire he said I would that she prosper
[2:09:19] in health even as your soul prospers he
[2:09:22] wants us to be well spiritually
[2:09:24] physically emotionally mentally in every
[2:09:28] way he cares about you he loves you when
[2:09:31] you come through this line tonight I
[2:09:32] don't want you to just say well there's
[2:09:34] brother Nathan and brother Jacqueline
[2:09:35] different brothers they're gonna lay
[2:09:36] hands on me and pray for me and I guess
[2:09:38] it'll just be another prayer line
[2:09:39] another service but I want you to
[2:09:41] visualize what he said there's your sick
[2:09:43] body stand and there's you come along
[2:09:45] but when you get to the end over here
[2:09:46] and don't let the devil lie to you and
[2:09:49] say well
[2:09:49] Manor I'll just walk down the middle
[2:09:50] I'll go ahead and walk on across the
[2:09:52] floor prove the devil you got enough
[2:09:54] faith to walk on across the floor and
[2:09:56] visualize that well body or that family
[2:10:00] that's back together again or that job
[2:10:03] or that fan a financial issue that
[2:10:05] you're facing all better or whatever it
[2:10:08] is some situation at your school or some
[2:10:10] mental oppression that the devil is
[2:10:12] trying to give you anxiety or fear or
[2:10:14] depression or whatever it is imagine
[2:10:16] walking into that well body with all
[2:10:18] that better all those negative things
[2:10:20] gone all those emotional scars from when
[2:10:23] you got made fun of when he was a kid or
[2:10:24] or whatever it was got abused or
[2:10:27] whatever and you walk right into that
[2:10:28] well body you say I'm delivered I'm
[2:10:30] victorious I'm gonna walk out of here
[2:10:33] different than I came in I'm never gonna
[2:10:35] complain again I'm never gonna have a
[2:10:37] negative thought again if I do I'm not
[2:10:39] gonna dwell on it I'm gonna have a
[2:10:40] positive testimony when somebody asks me
[2:10:43] I'm not gonna tell them how bad I'm
[2:10:44] feeling I'm gonna tell them I'm healed
[2:10:46] because jesus healed me I'm healed
[2:10:49] because Jesus wants me to be healed more
[2:10:51] than I even wanted to receive it I mean
[2:10:54] you do that and you take God at His Word
[2:10:55] I guarantee you you'll notice a
[2:10:57] difference in your life you know or you
[2:10:59] can go out and say well there's just
[2:11:00] another service I'll come back again or
[2:11:03] maybe it'll be different
[2:11:04] Amy let's bow our heads together dear
[2:11:08] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[2:11:11] that we have that same friend that
[2:11:14] Lazarus had Lord we love you tonight and
[2:11:20] Lord we just take you at your word Lord
[2:11:25] as we enter into this service I pray
[2:11:27] that she'd be with us be with each one
[2:11:28] that has a need Lord no matter how
[2:11:32] severe how small Lord every need Lord if
[2:11:36] the people care and they they have a
[2:11:38] desire in their heart or do you care you
[2:11:42] care about their situation you cared
[2:11:44] enough to sent into your word and to
[2:11:46] send your prophet and to send ministers
[2:11:48] by Lord to try to encourage hearts and
[2:11:51] try to help us to build our faith to a
[2:11:53] place where we can take you at your word
[2:11:55] you care tonight for these people
[2:11:57] whatever they're facing Lord whatever
[2:11:59] the devil has tried to rob them of
[2:12:01] whether it's their health
[2:12:02] or whatever it would be Lord we believe
[2:12:04] that you're more than able and that you
[2:12:06] care about them and or whatever the
[2:12:08] devil's done at any time you're able to
[2:12:09] make it right father well we take you at
[2:12:12] your word tonight we accept it by faith
[2:12:14] in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[2:12:18] I don't know exactly what brother Jack
[2:12:21] has in mind but I would say this for the
[2:12:24] musicians maybe just let one musician
[2:12:27] come up and play and let the rest of
[2:12:29] them any of them that wants to come and
[2:12:31] and and be prayed for let them come
[2:12:33] through and then when they get through
[2:12:34] if whoever's playing wants to come
[2:12:36] through the prayer line let them play
[2:12:37] let's just just something simple sister
[2:12:39] Rachel just the Great Physician or
[2:12:42] something like that then actually do you
[2:12:47] know healing is here and I receive it do
[2:12:51] you know the Great Physician that's fine
[2:12:53] a man will just join together in faith
[2:12:58] while these people are coming through
[2:12:59] being prayed for you pray with us agree
[2:13:02] with us for their healing and their
[2:13:03] deliverance brother did you want to say
[2:13:05] anything before we do just
[2:13:15] as the brother Nathan was saying we
[2:13:17] wanna those that want to be prayed for
[2:13:19] we want you to just line up on this on
[2:13:21] this wall here and as you're lying now
[2:13:24] we will anoint you with oil according to
[2:13:27] the scripture
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:33] those data are in receipts if you just
[2:13:36] keep your head back
[2:13:40] all these are coming through to be free
[2:13:43] for tonight
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:48] this is a gift from God you healing
[2:13:51] tonight is a gift from God so we want to
[2:13:54] encourage you to receive that
[2:13:57] and as you're receiving the gift is just
[2:14:00] telling them thank you and just worship
[2:14:02] him in your own special way
[2:14:06] but God has gifts that he wants to give
[2:14:09] to each and every one that's coming
[2:14:10] through the slant tonight with faith I
[2:14:12] believe that

[3:10:31] it's not based on the feeling is not
[3:10:33] based on an emotion it's based on what
[3:10:35] God said
[3:10:36] I believe if you walk out of here
[3:10:39] tonight with the faith that was preached
[3:10:42] to us you'll experience your own
[3:10:45] personal miracle
[3:10:49] I'm on the expectation that many y'all

[3:11:43] born of a virgin if there was anything
[3:11:45] impossible that was something that
[3:11:48] should have been impossible but by him
