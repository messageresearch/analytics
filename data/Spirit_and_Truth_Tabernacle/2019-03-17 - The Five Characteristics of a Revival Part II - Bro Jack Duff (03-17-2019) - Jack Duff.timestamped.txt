[1:08:56] a blessing to the reading of his words
[1:08:57] you can be seated in the presence of the
[1:09:00] Lord
[1:09:01] we started a man on a topic of 5
[1:09:05] characteristics of revival a man 5
[1:09:09] characteristics of revival and this is
[1:09:13] part two to that sermon and just a
[1:09:16] little recap from some of the things
[1:09:18] that be shared just to kind of make sure
[1:09:20] we'll go back pick these up and bring
[1:09:22] them forward
[1:09:23] we were just revival this term has been
[1:09:29] used amen
[1:09:31] I want to say very loosely throughout
[1:09:33] church history and even today at when I
[1:09:37] was coming up the the way that we would
[1:09:38] understand it was Rev I was always so
[1:09:40] guest preacher coming to town and and
[1:09:43] you know growing up in the Baptist
[1:09:45] Church the guest preacher would come and
[1:09:47] they would
[1:09:48] you know he would preach and he was
[1:09:49] saying as happy and you know and after
[1:09:51] service he'd go to one of the mother's
[1:09:53] purchase of one of the mothers of the
[1:09:55] church go to hell house and eat some
[1:09:56] chicken a man it just if it just so
[1:09:59] happened to be yo grandma was one of the
[1:10:00] mothers you'd be invited a man to be
[1:10:02] there to eat chicken with the preacher
[1:10:04] Amen praise the Lord and and you know
[1:10:07] they do that and you think that that's
[1:10:09] the only time that there was revival but
[1:10:11] when we come to the revelation of the
[1:10:13] word we found out it's not necessarily
[1:10:15] when a preacher comes a town that's not
[1:10:17] when you haven't revival a man and and
[1:10:20] and could because the revival doesn't
[1:10:22] come by the minister
[1:10:23] the revival actually comes by what the
[1:10:25] people are doing in their homes and you
[1:10:28] know when we're seeking the Lord and
[1:10:30] we're praying and you know we're doing
[1:10:31] all these things when revival comes it's
[1:10:33] not necessarily to add new members to
[1:10:36] the church a man revival comes in order
[1:10:38] to revive what was already in the church
[1:10:40] praise the Lord a man sometimes God got
[1:10:44] the send your revival to remind you
[1:10:46] where you used to be come on somebody a
[1:10:49] man and god I have to God I have to kind
[1:10:51] of reignite a man a little fire that
[1:10:54] used to be burning inside of you glory
[1:10:56] to God there was a time where you you
[1:10:58] didn't want to miss church hallelujah
[1:11:00] amen but somehow you let them revival
[1:11:03] fires burn down sometimes somehow you
[1:11:05] let the embers a man get a little bit
[1:11:08] too low and and I'm reminded of a story
[1:11:11] one time of a you know a preacher there
[1:11:13] was a brother he had kind of stopped
[1:11:15] coming to church a man and he really
[1:11:17] didn't want to be bothered too much but
[1:11:19] too many people and so you know the
[1:11:21] preacher happened to go out to his house
[1:11:23] and I was a little warm I mean a little
[1:11:25] cool that day and so they had the fire
[1:11:27] burning and the preacher they really
[1:11:29] didn't say any much a man to up to the
[1:11:31] man because he didn't really like the
[1:11:32] talk so you know he walked into the
[1:11:34] house and you know could I have a seat
[1:11:36] and sat down and you know yeah and maybe
[1:11:38] got a little something to drink and they
[1:11:39] just sat there by the fire and and while
[1:11:41] they were sitting by the fire there was
[1:11:43] a little log a man in the fire that
[1:11:46] began to kind of fizzle out a man you
[1:11:49] can see it was it was burning hot and
[1:11:50] then it got it just got you know just
[1:11:53] fizzling out where it wasn't burning hot
[1:11:54] anymore
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:56] and what the preacher did is he walked
[1:11:57] up and he and he took the little thing
[1:12:00] and he pushed it a man into the into the
[1:12:03] midst of the heat you know where where
[1:12:05] the fire was really blazing and I all he
[1:12:06] did was just pushing him before you know
[1:12:08] it that little thing that was burning
[1:12:10] out reconnected it rekindled him and the
[1:12:13] fire got rekindled and when and when the
[1:12:15] man you know they know the visitor I
[1:12:18] mean the whole stack that was hosting a
[1:12:20] preacher saw that he looked at the
[1:12:22] preacher say I'll be in church on Sunday
[1:12:25] cuz he realized he was a little long you
[1:12:28] understand he was a little odd that was
[1:12:30] once on fire and then he lost his fire
[1:12:33] somehow he he got disconnected from
[1:12:35] everything and the only way to get your
[1:12:37] fire restarted again is get back where
[1:12:39] get back into where it started out the
[1:12:41] first place hallelujah somebody a man so
[1:12:45] so when we talk about you know revival
[1:12:47] there are some characters
[1:12:48] characteristics that we would see a man
[1:12:50] and and and and I want to just you know
[1:12:52] I kind of lay a couple of things and I
[1:12:55] mentioned this this quote out of the
[1:12:57] third seal and and the prophet made a
[1:13:00] statement said the bride hasn't had a
[1:13:03] revival yet there's been no revival
[1:13:06] there no manifestation of God to stir
[1:13:08] the bride yet we're looking for it is
[1:13:10] what he said and it says it will take
[1:13:12] those seven on them unknown thunders
[1:13:14] back there to wake her up again he will
[1:13:16] send it Amen he promised it so you know
[1:13:19] I was I was telling you how when I grew
[1:13:20] up they used to preach that particular
[1:13:22] quote and they always kept revival
[1:13:24] happening in the future
[1:13:26] Amen we don't need a revival in the
[1:13:28] Millennium Amen whinny revival now right
[1:13:32] and if the Prophet told us that the
[1:13:34] bride hadn't had a revival yet he said
[1:13:36] God will send it hallelujah and what we
[1:13:40] had to do is kind of read between the
[1:13:41] lines and find out where God had sent it
[1:13:44] they kept pointing me to just one little
[1:13:46] quote a man in the fourth church age but
[1:13:48] I mean in the fourth seal but that
[1:13:50] wasn't it it was all the seals a man
[1:13:53] could he say the bride hasn't had a
[1:13:55] revival yet no manifestation of God to
[1:13:57] stir her yet we're looking for it we'll
[1:14:00] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:14:01] there to wake her up again I want to
[1:14:03] read this quote out of laodicean church
[1:14:05] age a man
[1:14:06] if I can just to kind of show you that
[1:14:08] we are in continuous revival even right
[1:14:11] now Amen we are in continuous revival
[1:14:15] and this statement says now this
[1:14:17] messenger glory of Malachi 4 and
[1:14:20] revelation 10
[1:14:22] Amen this message of Malachi 4
[1:14:25] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:14:28] things
[1:14:29] amen according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[1:14:33] the hearts of the children to the
[1:14:35] father's amen and says - he will reveal
[1:14:39] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:14:42] Revelation team which are the
[1:14:46] revelations contained in the seven seals
[1:14:50] so the prophet has clearly identified
[1:14:53] weather revelations are contained amen
[1:14:56] so if you if you want to get in revival
[1:14:58] you're gonna have to come to the word
[1:15:01] hallelujah amen if you're not man I'm
[1:15:04] not I mean you say you're a revival but
[1:15:06] I'm not if you want to get there you got
[1:15:08] to come to the word hallelujah because
[1:15:10] revivals always on the word and any true
[1:15:13] revival will come because people got
[1:15:16] back to the word listen to this he says
[1:15:18] says says I contained in the seven seals
[1:15:21] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:15:23] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:15:27] hearts of the children to the
[1:15:28] Pentecostal fathers exactly so brother
[1:15:31] Branham has come brother Branham has
[1:15:33] gone brother Branham revealed these
[1:15:35] truths to us with fellowship and around
[1:15:37] this word so no longer are we waiting on
[1:15:40] revival we are amen it's based on these
[1:15:44] statements we can clearly say we are in
[1:15:46] revival hallelujah alright let's go on I
[1:15:52] made a couple statements where it's
[1:15:55] revival when it comes even when it came
[1:15:58] in the days of Jesus only a small
[1:16:00] minority is gonna know that it's
[1:16:02] happening only a small minority other
[1:16:04] thing is when God begins to shake things
[1:16:07] people don't realize what's even being
[1:16:09] done when God's movement people have no
[1:16:12] idea what God is really doing amen
[1:16:14] hallelujah hallelujah God is shaking his
[1:16:17] church even right now
[1:16:18] all right a man we are in revival all
[1:16:22] right let me go on a little further
[1:16:24] hallelujah now there are characteristics
[1:16:27] to this revival let me just read this
[1:16:30] quote out of a man speak to this
[1:16:32] mountain and then we will will go
[1:16:34] forward there this is where we're
[1:16:36] getting our thoughts from how to speak
[1:16:38] to this mountain he says this is now
[1:16:40] where we're trying to place the revival
[1:16:42] just in the best setting that we can we
[1:16:45] do not what we call major on divine
[1:16:47] healing because divine healing is a
[1:16:49] minor and even though we thank God for
[1:16:51] divine healing which we have that praise
[1:16:54] God you know some churches that's they
[1:16:58] get a miracle and they're so surprised
[1:17:00] that it happened they don't know how to
[1:17:02] go further right
[1:17:04] but miracles should be everyday
[1:17:06] occurrences here all right and not that
[1:17:09] we get so relaxed that it happened that
[1:17:11] we don't give God praise for it but it
[1:17:13] should be it should just be normal
[1:17:15] Amen to see miracles that's normal
[1:17:18] God is in the midst there's a
[1:17:19] supernatural God that dwells in the
[1:17:22] midst of his people so he does
[1:17:23] supernatural things right Amen some
[1:17:26] miracles should be coming praying all it
[1:17:29] take is faith and all of you to see a
[1:17:31] miracle hallelujah amen I mean you know
[1:17:36] I was mentioned there's so many
[1:17:38] different things that happen here
[1:17:40] recently and and you know we've seen
[1:17:42] cancer heal a man we've we've seen a
[1:17:46] number of things that happen in this
[1:17:48] church you know I told you how precious
[1:17:51] you know sister just testified we had
[1:17:53] two sisters recently healed of cancer
[1:17:55] you know and and my dad was healed of
[1:17:57] cancer right cancer is not to half of
[1:17:59] God listen when they tell you for stage
[1:18:02] don't fear
[1:18:06] you you you're in the full state you
[1:18:09] know and it's like doc you never even
[1:18:12] diagnosed the first stage
[1:18:13] you never even diagnosed the second
[1:18:16] stage I came the office once and I'm in
[1:18:20] full stage right what that is that's a
[1:18:23] scare tactic that's that devil trying to
[1:18:26] put fear in you hallelujah but if you
[1:18:29] refuse that package that the devil
[1:18:32] centum sent into you you will experience
[1:18:35] the miracle of revival because in
[1:18:39] revival they're supposed to be healing
[1:18:41] of the seer right that supposed to
[1:18:43] happen when revival and when you can say
[1:18:45] the Saint huh me revive I don't know
[1:18:47] about you but I remember in vaudeville
[1:18:48] so I'm expecting my body to be healed
[1:18:51] hallelujah somebody glory to God a man I
[1:18:55] mean it's time for us to stop running
[1:18:57] from the devil start running the devil
[1:19:01] glory to God he's under my feet Church
[1:19:04] hey man a man so he goes on he says it's
[1:19:08] now we're trying to place the revival
[1:19:09] just in the best setting we can we do
[1:19:11] not what we call major on divine healing
[1:19:14] because divine healing is a minor and
[1:19:16] you cannot major on a minor we know that
[1:19:18] so the great thing that we're after for
[1:19:21] any revival is to bring lost souls to
[1:19:24] Christ all right we want to see lost
[1:19:27] souls come to Christ and that that could
[1:19:29] be lost they never know nothing about
[1:19:31] Jesus or lost because you done Baxley it
[1:19:35] but we want to see lost souls come to
[1:19:37] Christ and see see when we have meetings
[1:19:40] it creates an atmosphere where people
[1:19:43] want to walk in and get underneath that
[1:19:46] anointing hallelujah but I'm here to
[1:19:48] tell you that when the meeting is over
[1:19:50] the Norton has not gone anywhere that
[1:19:53] same anointing is still here and
[1:19:56] whatever you need God's got it
[1:20:00] if you need deliverance contact if you
[1:20:03] need showing God's got it if you need
[1:20:07] peace of mind God's got it whatever you
[1:20:10] need Todd's got it and we're not waiting
[1:20:14] for a preacher to come amen we just want
[1:20:17] to get into the presence of God let the
[1:20:19] Holy Spirit do what only he can do
[1:20:23] alright let me go on a little further
[1:20:25] here he says this is to bring lost souls
[1:20:28] to Christ first then he says revive the
[1:20:32] church back into a spiritual condition
[1:20:34] now this is important I want to hit this
[1:20:36] today we want to revive the church back
[1:20:38] into the spiritual condition I want you
[1:20:40] to think about where you used to be
[1:20:42] where where where where where you know
[1:20:44] man where I mean I used to have a prayer
[1:20:47] life I used to have this you said think
[1:20:50] about where you used to be in God
[1:20:51] hallelujah and revival was to take you
[1:20:54] back to that place oh come on somebody
[1:20:57] see revive the church back into a
[1:20:59] spiritual condition to where it should
[1:21:01] be
[1:21:02] listen he said close communion with God
[1:21:05] bring fellowship amongst the churches
[1:21:07] third in print and fourth pray for the
[1:21:09] sick that's our aim our try is sinners
[1:21:13] first fellowship with the churches and a
[1:21:15] close walk with the church up to God and
[1:21:17] then pray for the sick so I listed these
[1:21:19] out a man winning souls to Christ was
[1:21:21] number one number two was restored the
[1:21:24] church to his right condition of
[1:21:25] spiritual conviction condition number
[1:21:27] three was close communion with God a man
[1:21:30] for was fellowship amongst other
[1:21:32] churches and five was praying for the
[1:21:34] sick and like I mentioned to you before
[1:21:36] I remember some time ago I was just in a
[1:21:40] meeting and brother belching that
[1:21:41] mentioned these five things about that
[1:21:43] characteristic survivor and I wrote that
[1:21:45] thing down said man I got it I got to
[1:21:47] use that one day and I held on to it for
[1:21:48] probably more than a year but I want to
[1:21:51] just kind of come and bring this back to
[1:21:52] the church because I believe we're here
[1:21:54] right now this is what we're
[1:21:56] experiencing now we know we've seen lost
[1:21:59] souls come to Christ we've seen that
[1:22:02] we've watched we've watched that so that
[1:22:03] lets us know that we are in revival Amen
[1:22:06] we know that we've seen healing here in
[1:22:08] our church
[1:22:10] hallelujah in it and it's good to be
[1:22:12] able to talk about what's going on in
[1:22:14] your church early it is this week one of
[1:22:16] the brothers was at a at the hospital
[1:22:19] you know just kind of talking with
[1:22:20] somebody and any and he ran into this
[1:22:23] person and they had a pretty serious
[1:22:25] situation I think of a seven-year-old
[1:22:26] that was that was suffering from cancer
[1:22:28] think about that seven years old
[1:22:30] right suffering from cancer but it was
[1:22:33] good that the brother has some
[1:22:34] ammunition he could walk in there and he
[1:22:41] can say I noticed may seem impossible
[1:22:43] I've noticed may seem hard yeah your
[1:22:47] seven-year-old child got got cancer but
[1:22:49] but but God can heal cancer and you can
[1:22:53] stand there and tell that parent that
[1:22:55] and you know I mean they hear what the
[1:22:56] doctors say but maybe they just need to
[1:22:58] hear a testimony they meant from
[1:23:00] somebody else that that can tell you not
[1:23:02] I heard about it
[1:23:04] no we experienced it in my church this
[1:23:08] is what happened at my church God is
[1:23:11] still healing tense sighs amen it's not
[1:23:15] to a God can do impossible things God
[1:23:18] can do incredible things
[1:23:19] hallelujah in a step there and begin to
[1:23:22] talk about the things of God with this
[1:23:23] family and somebody else came up or so
[1:23:26] you know what I feel the presence of God
[1:23:27] here and if somebody else is identifying
[1:23:31] the presence of God through a testimony
[1:23:35] God didn't give you that for you to keep
[1:23:38] it God want you to share it because your
[1:23:41] testimony is gonna send somebody else
[1:23:44] free praise God hallelujah Church right
[1:23:49] so when we share things like that he's
[1:23:51] just sharing in the hospital and
[1:23:52] somebody said I feel the prim guys well
[1:23:54] let's pray right here right now amen we
[1:23:57] don't know what God to do right but I
[1:23:59] believe God can hear that seven-year-old
[1:24:01] a man cancers not too hard when you
[1:24:04] revive you expect things like this you
[1:24:07] say look you know the reason that this
[1:24:09] happened in our church cuz we in revival
[1:24:11] how come I never heard nothing about it
[1:24:14] it's because it's only a few people know
[1:24:15] about it
[1:24:18] glory to God all right let's go on a
[1:24:20] little further here I wanted to bring in
[1:24:22] because we got lost souls to Christ and
[1:24:25] man we got with no prayer for the sick
[1:24:28] and we sing God heal the sick is not
[1:24:29] just prayer but God will heal the sick
[1:24:31] amen we've seen that but we want to talk
[1:24:33] about this a man today fellowship
[1:24:36] amongst other churches this is this is
[1:24:38] another sign of revival and and we know
[1:24:41] that God has allowed this particular
[1:24:43] area to experience a man of some unity
[1:24:46] like we have never seen amongst churches
[1:24:48] all over the world ain't number the
[1:24:52] truth right God has given us a such a
[1:24:54] unit it ain't always been this way so
[1:24:58] you know and us knowing that it has not
[1:25:00] always been this way we do everything we
[1:25:01] can to keep the devil out where he might
[1:25:04] try to stop the fellowship amen right we
[1:25:08] do everything to try to keep the devil
[1:25:10] out there's there's a thing that we do
[1:25:13] as pastors you know that if you know
[1:25:15] there's nothing wrong if a person feel
[1:25:17] late so you know I brother Jack I want
[1:25:19] to go to this church you know there's
[1:25:21] nothing wrong I'd rather see hallelujah
[1:25:24] I rather see Saints leave this church
[1:25:26] and go to another message Church
[1:25:29] hallelujah because now when I talk about
[1:25:32] fellowship a bunch of churches I'm not
[1:25:33] taught by any church I got some quotes
[1:25:36] on this I'm not just talk about
[1:25:38] fellowshipping at any church I'm talk
[1:25:40] about fellowship at amongst people of
[1:25:42] like precious faith so if you come and
[1:25:45] say I want to go to this other mr.
[1:25:47] Church we're gonna pray with you and
[1:25:48] maybe we're gonna pray for you and and
[1:25:51] then I have conversation with the pastor
[1:25:54] let them know hey the Saints want to
[1:25:56] come and fellowship at your church no
[1:25:58] problem they left here under really good
[1:26:00] conditions amen receive them they are
[1:26:02] not a problem in the church the these
[1:26:04] are faithful people these are good
[1:26:06] people
[1:26:07] right the deeds the type of
[1:26:08] conversations that we have hallelujah
[1:26:10] can some thought be running from stuff
[1:26:13] oh I know what I'm talking about you all
[1:26:16] never you all ever read the story of
[1:26:19] Abner in the Bible huh amen and Abner if
[1:26:25] I'm not if I'm if I remember correctly
[1:26:27] Abner was whispers you know he was he
[1:26:30] has it wasn't Abner wasn't the other guy
[1:26:33] jo-ann no no no no no it was Abner Abner
[1:26:37] Abner he was there you know in the
[1:26:41] scripture not now I'm just kind of
[1:26:42] calling yourself a memory so y'all just
[1:26:43] bear with me if I don't have it right
[1:26:45] I'll get it right Amen but but there
[1:26:48] David had the kingdom established and
[1:26:50] this man at first they didn't want to
[1:26:52] make David the fool king they they they
[1:26:55] I mean Saul's son I can't think of his
[1:26:58] name right now but Saul son was the
[1:27:00] other King and this guy Abner begin to
[1:27:02] take advantage of some of the Kings
[1:27:04] wives hello somebody
[1:27:07] hallelujah the king called them out on
[1:27:09] this town the king said why you do this
[1:27:12] I mean you're not suppose this is
[1:27:14] adultery man you're not supposed to do
[1:27:16] the Word of God says not to do it right
[1:27:20] so somebody stood up to me say you're
[1:27:22] not supposed to do this and he said now
[1:27:23] who you are Here I am protecting you and
[1:27:26] I'm getting control of this army I got
[1:27:29] all this power and authority and you
[1:27:31] gonna challenge me I'll tell you what
[1:27:33] I'll do I take your army and I go to
[1:27:36] David hello somebody right this man was
[1:27:40] not really interested in fellowship this
[1:27:44] man should have been interested in
[1:27:46] repenting right he was trying to run
[1:27:50] from some problem that he calls
[1:27:53] oh come on somebody amen so so so when
[1:27:57] he got over there with David David oh
[1:27:59] yeah will welcome me right in but Joab
[1:28:01] say now I know this guy AB name right
[1:28:05] and Joab deserved a different spirits
[1:28:09] hello and joy I've said
[1:28:11] I'm sorry Dave we're gonna have to take
[1:28:13] this in our old hands and Joep begin to
[1:28:16] get with this felling Joe al qasas got
[1:28:18] to die now he shouldn't have did it that
[1:28:20] way but what Joe thought he was towards
[1:28:23] protecting David's and he probably was
[1:28:26] right so sometimes you got to discern
[1:28:29] the spirit and the way you're discerning
[1:28:31] is by the pastors communicating hello
[1:28:34] somebody
[1:28:35] knowing that things have been done in
[1:28:37] decency and in order
[1:28:39] it keeps the fellowship amongst the
[1:28:42] churches this is why the devil can't get
[1:28:46] a 1-up over here hey man what up in
[1:28:50] South Florida because these we handle
[1:28:52] things the right way it keeps the devil
[1:28:56] out now let me say something let me say
[1:29:00] something
[1:29:00] can I say something every pot let me
[1:29:11] every plant doesn't grow in the same
[1:29:15] soil can I say that again every plant
[1:29:23] doesn't grow in the same soil there are
[1:29:27] certain trees that grow here in Florida
[1:29:29] you cannot take them out to the desert
[1:29:31] in Arizona and expect them to grow and
[1:29:33] there are certain things that grow in
[1:29:35] Arizona that will not grow here in
[1:29:37] Florida certain things in Florida won't
[1:29:40] grow in Michigan or whether you have to
[1:29:44] have it planted in the right spot
[1:29:49] for it to grow but the reason that you
[1:29:53] plan it
[1:29:54] oh hello somebody the reason you plant
[1:29:57] yourself in a church it's so that you
[1:29:59] can grow I hope you can read between the
[1:30:06] lines you gotta know what's all you need
[1:30:09] to be planning here and when you get
[1:30:12] there when people see fruit they may
[1:30:14] then got nothing the same but in the
[1:30:20] midst of we should lose fellowship
[1:30:21] because that is a characteristic of
[1:30:24] revival hello somebody first thing I say
[1:30:27] now okay so it's okay we welcome
[1:30:29] everybody but now that you're not
[1:30:32] leaving you don't have nothing your
[1:30:33] heart against this other church do you
[1:30:35] because we fellowship all the time
[1:30:38] sometimes we go over there and sometimes
[1:30:41] they come over here and I want to make
[1:30:43] sure that when they come over here you
[1:30:45] in church are you in revival oh come on
[1:31:02] somebody and revival is not when your
[1:31:05] favorite preachers preaching people this
[1:31:10] morning revival is not only when your
[1:31:13] favorite preachers preaching revival
[1:31:16] happens with somebody else's preaching
[1:31:18] oh alright church but fellowship amongst
[1:31:23] other sister churches and no church that
[1:31:26] dominate it should be fellowship
[1:31:29] everybody should be encouraged to do
[1:31:31] something I feel good any hi so let me
[1:31:38] just kind of drop this I want to put
[1:31:39] this quote in here on this on this
[1:31:41] fellowship amongst other sister Church
[1:31:42] because I'm not talking about I'm not
[1:31:44] talking about fellowship in anywhere let
[1:31:46] me let me drop a call here for you god
[1:31:48] of this evil age look at this there is
[1:31:51] only two classes of people spoke of in
[1:31:58] the New Testament
[1:32:00] man we was trying to state it with
[1:32:02] somebody it's only to look at this only
[1:32:04] two classes of people spoke of a New
[1:32:07] Testament the children of God and the
[1:32:10] children of the devil that's it right
[1:32:13] you say did you know that you want to
[1:32:15] put a scripture down for it first John
[1:32:18] 3:10 as you'll read it it says an
[1:32:21] institute of God manifest and the
[1:32:22] children devil whosoever does not do if
[1:32:24] not righteousness is not of God neither
[1:32:26] he that loveth not his brother so all
[1:32:28] the children of God and the children of
[1:32:29] the devil that's the only two groups it
[1:32:31] is says if you want a scripture I'm
[1:32:32] reading it right here got it wrote out
[1:32:34] all right all right and Ephesians 2:2
[1:32:37] they are called the children of
[1:32:38] disobedience right like Eve with
[1:32:41] disobedient to God's Word the children
[1:32:44] of obedience and disobedience have
[1:32:46] nothing in coming let's go on a little
[1:32:50] further then how can the Bride of Christ
[1:32:55] associate in a denomination sorry talk
[1:33:00] about fellowship and everywhere how can
[1:33:02] the Bride of Christ associate in a
[1:33:04] denomination when one is disobedient in
[1:33:07] the other obedient listen how can how
[1:33:11] can one be the word and the other one
[1:33:13] perverted words how can a prostitute and
[1:33:17] a clean woman walk together in agreement
[1:33:19] listen they can't do it they have no
[1:33:23] fellowship at all come out from among
[1:33:26] them it's of the devil it's the mark of
[1:33:29] the beast heading right into it now Oh
[1:33:33] denomination I want to make sure we get
[1:33:37] that clear you know you talk you talk
[1:33:39] you talk fellowship why me just about no
[1:33:41] I can't fellows with people that don't
[1:33:42] believe what I believe we ought to do
[1:33:45] that I said now I'm just had the
[1:33:46] conversation with somebody didn't
[1:33:48] believe what I believe we could not see
[1:33:50] eye to eye I don't want to call it an
[1:33:53] argument but we knew that we were not
[1:33:55] seeing we were looking at the same
[1:33:57] scripture seeing two different things
[1:33:59] and I'm looking at it and I say I say
[1:34:02] this no you're just making the words so
[1:34:05] difficult
[1:34:05] no you missing some things it say this
[1:34:10] see two can walk together said they've
[1:34:13] agree so we're not will hallelujah
[1:34:15] can I I want to say this while I'm here
[1:34:17] let me finish this quote I'm gonna say
[1:34:18] something just give me a second give me
[1:34:20] a second
[1:34:21] how can he said cut up amongst him and
[1:34:24] it's of the devil it's the mark of the
[1:34:26] beast heading right into it now all
[1:34:28] denominations I don't care who it is God
[1:34:30] has taken God has taken not a
[1:34:32] denomination of people for its name a
[1:34:34] denomination won't receive these truths
[1:34:37] it will take an individual person that
[1:34:41] can see God look at its word and believe
[1:34:44] it and belong to no organization but
[1:34:47] live for God not for its organization
[1:34:50] the intellectual wisdom of some Bishop
[1:34:52] of something that's taught it that's
[1:34:54] right see that's that's not what we're
[1:34:55] looking for so we talk about fellowship
[1:34:56] amongst the church talking about this
[1:34:58] every church you know I've had I've had
[1:35:00] plenty of people asked me about wanting
[1:35:03] to come and fellowship with our church
[1:35:05] so you know maybe we ought to get our
[1:35:08] churches together and just have some
[1:35:09] fellowship we'll talk about that you
[1:35:14] know we'll talk about that next subject
[1:35:17] because I'm not releasing that here
[1:35:19] everybody they can't receive these
[1:35:21] truths right and and I'm just not gonna
[1:35:24] put anything before you glory to God I
[1:35:26] want to make sure you're healthy
[1:35:28] spiritually so I'm just not putting
[1:35:30] anything for you before I mean Balaam
[1:35:33] went when the children Israel got mixed
[1:35:35] up with Balaam they got in trouble
[1:35:36] that's not the fellowship that God
[1:35:38] wanted them to have
[1:35:39] alright Church so look I mean not that
[1:35:42] we don't love people but look we are
[1:35:44] before we actually have a combined
[1:35:46] service like that we gonna sit down and
[1:35:47] talk about a few things
[1:35:49] glory alright not that we don't love
[1:35:54] people but you know here here to say
[1:35:56] we're not fellowship with just with
[1:35:57] everybody we talk about people that
[1:35:59] believe what we believe and I was just
[1:36:02] taking myself you know just even in in
[1:36:04] our plaster these truths that God has
[1:36:06] given us and we're so we got so many
[1:36:09] churches that that see us can you
[1:36:11] imagine in no one's day maybe there were
[1:36:17] a couple other people building boats
[1:36:21] and one boat was right next to Noah's
[1:36:24] pump it looked like it would be safe and
[1:36:31] maybe somebody that was owned Knorr boat
[1:36:33] got off Noah's boat to go on the other
[1:36:36] boat and they were that close to Noah's
[1:36:44] boat yeah I hope you read between the
[1:36:46] lines they were that close to nose boat
[1:36:49] and when destruction came they realized
[1:36:52] they were in the wrong boat but they had
[1:36:55] the opportunity to be in the right boat
[1:36:57] I hope you can read between lemon so
[1:37:01] when we talk about fellowship in a month
[1:37:03] churches we not talk about we not talk
[1:37:06] about denomination we talk about people
[1:37:09] that believe this same truth that we
[1:37:11] believe and let me take something we are
[1:37:12] not one-of-a-kind here if you would open
[1:37:16] up in fellowship you will see that as a
[1:37:18] whole bunch of us around here in Palm
[1:37:20] Beach County Palm Beach Brower day it's
[1:37:25] a whole bunch of not just there all over
[1:37:27] the world praise God when you can see
[1:37:33] brother Quaker coming in and preaching
[1:37:34] and say my way brother Quaker from from
[1:37:37] not not our Ghana Ghana right darlin
[1:37:41] from Ghana how did he can I just you
[1:37:46] know cities are these are his testimony
[1:37:48] how he got here all right he was at
[1:37:51] school supposed to be a man getting
[1:37:54] something to eat and the thing that he's
[1:37:56] supposed to get to eat that day they
[1:37:58] didn't have it so he went to another
[1:38:00] little spot so let me try this and when
[1:38:01] he got there he saw a sister and they
[1:38:04] looked at it saying I she look like us
[1:38:08] you from Ghana who is us
[1:38:12] whose ass how do you know us it's like
[1:38:19] she looked like us and sister yes you go
[1:38:24] to church yes
[1:38:26] what church you go to Spirit of Truth
[1:38:29] Tabernacle and say that's not that's not
[1:38:32] good I need to go for that back that the
[1:38:34] Clinton question I'm just trying to open
[1:38:38] up the door but I need to drive the nail
[1:38:40] home I don't know if she ready for this
[1:38:47] but I need to know I can I'm looking at
[1:38:50] her and she looking look she looked like
[1:38:52] us but I'm gonna be able to tell real
[1:38:55] quick if she us real quick one question
[1:39:06] is she awesome not before before you go
[1:39:11] one question who is your prophet
[1:39:18] William Marion Branham what where is
[1:39:20] your church that's the church that I
[1:39:23] want to go to so we fellowship we table
[1:39:29] our fellowship amongst people of like
[1:39:31] precious faith you can be in a whole
[1:39:34] nother country and people can tell by
[1:39:38] the way you dress and you want us glory
[1:39:45] to God glory to God so so it's not it's
[1:39:48] not denominational churches that's not
[1:39:50] what we talk about it a man and and it
[1:39:52] you know sometimes people get and I'm
[1:39:55] gonna just be honest folk get hurt in
[1:39:56] church they do now I'm gonna say two
[1:39:59] things to that one is people do get hurt
[1:40:01] in church another is that not all the
[1:40:04] time is the ministry trying to hurt you
[1:40:12] not all the time is the ministry trying
[1:40:14] to hurt you
[1:40:15] that's not people's intention amen all
[1:40:18] right
[1:40:19] so so if you get hurt sometime you might
[1:40:20] have to take your little plant and plant
[1:40:23] it somewhere else it's okay as long as
[1:40:25] you grow
[1:40:26] you know I say it's okay cuz I was
[1:40:29] playing it somewhere else before before
[1:40:30] I start a spirit of truth to have an
[1:40:32] ankle so I don't have to move churches
[1:40:34] I've done that right so I think that
[1:40:37] happens with everybody there's nothing
[1:40:38] wrong with that nothing wrong with long
[1:40:40] as you do it in the right spirit God
[1:40:42] will bless it
[1:40:43] you understand hey man no don't come
[1:40:46] here and start talking about the other
[1:40:47] church oh this don't do that
[1:40:49] no we trying to keep fellowship you saw
[1:40:53] in discord man just understand your your
[1:40:57] your plant got to be in certain soil in
[1:40:59] order to grow that's it all right
[1:41:04] can I go on a little further you know
[1:41:07] there was a time that his brother was
[1:41:09] talking about this when we talked about
[1:41:10] fellowship the time his brother made a
[1:41:12] comment about some ducks and they were
[1:41:15] in this pan they had ducks on on one
[1:41:18] side and ducks on the other side and and
[1:41:20] man they they could suppose see that
[1:41:22] they were ducks they want to fellowship
[1:41:24] with one another but because of the
[1:41:25] walls the division that was among them
[1:41:27] they couldn't get the fellowship can I
[1:41:29] tell y'all something it used to be a
[1:41:31] time there was so much division just
[1:41:33] right here in this area
[1:41:34] oh my y'all believe seven fellas y'all
[1:41:39] don't believe seven thunders how do you
[1:41:41] know what I believe
[1:41:42] I believe what the Prophet said but we
[1:41:45] were dividing over simple things in the
[1:41:48] message and we were all ducks not only
[1:41:51] ducks we were we were all in the same
[1:41:52] family divided in the same family
[1:41:57] something was wrong with that picture we
[1:42:00] believe the same message and we divided
[1:42:02] them same family come on somebody this
[1:42:04] God did not send her a message to do
[1:42:06] that right so so here we are divided in
[1:42:09] the same family came even fellowship we
[1:42:12] were ducks that wanted to fellowship but
[1:42:14] because ministers put up walls it's the
[1:42:18] truth in it hide
[1:42:19] ministers were the ones that put up
[1:42:21] walls and in order to be identified with
[1:42:23] a particular Minister I'm talking to
[1:42:25] y'all this morning and already identify
[1:42:28] with a particular
[1:42:28] Minister you stayed with that wall but
[1:42:31] you had young cousin your mama your
[1:42:34] brother your sister
[1:42:35] you couldn't fellowship with him because
[1:42:37] of that wall but I thought you wanted to
[1:42:41] see the wall come down well nobody was
[1:42:45] gonna knock the wall down
[1:42:46] so what God had to do is Simpson water
[1:42:50] and when the water come it began to
[1:42:53] raise up a little bit and when the water
[1:42:56] raised the duck were trees and then the
[1:42:59] water raised a little bit more in the
[1:43:00] duck WA tree some more and eventually
[1:43:02] the water got so high that the water
[1:43:04] overtook the wall and when the water
[1:43:07] overtook the wall the Ducks could no
[1:43:10] longer see the wall because they were in
[1:43:12] fellowship can fellowship again our true
[1:43:29] revival will produce fellowship I thank
[1:43:38] God that I've seen walls come down we
[1:43:41] are under where we're experiencing that
[1:43:43] we are experiencing it a man the other
[1:43:46] thing that happens when let me just read
[1:43:48] this this is out of the message
[1:43:50] presuming Allah thought here and and and
[1:43:53] all of this happens church when we
[1:43:55] mature in God when we mature in God look
[1:44:00] at this it made the statement says I
[1:44:02] happen to think kind of put a spiritual
[1:44:04] a little interpretation to that when I
[1:44:06] was a young minister every man that made
[1:44:09] a mistake I want y'all to catch what the
[1:44:11] prophets saying here every man that made
[1:44:13] a mistake he was cut out of the picture
[1:44:16] if you make a mistake that's it you're
[1:44:20] out that ain't that ain't even
[1:44:22] christ-like right amen they say every
[1:44:26] man made a mistake he was out of the
[1:44:27] picture he couldn't even run in the race
[1:44:30] that's all
[1:44:31] if he wasn't a Baptist he just was out
[1:44:33] of the picture that's all see he just
[1:44:35] had to see things see the things I saw
[1:44:38] or the man was altogether wrong and then
[1:44:41] after I got a little bit older I begin
[1:44:43] to realize that you know the blanket
[1:44:44] kind of stretched a little I've seen
[1:44:47] where he had to and what he had to go
[1:44:50] through with a lot of toils a pastor of
[1:44:52] a church and the heartaches that goes
[1:44:55] with it
[1:44:55] I realized that this blanket spreads a
[1:44:58] little over him too you know to kind of
[1:45:01] keep him from getting cold and now as we
[1:45:04] come on down to about where I am now I
[1:45:06] tell you we meet one another so bad
[1:45:09] we just can't hardly do without one
[1:45:12] another that's all there is to it and as
[1:45:14] we see the day is getting evil and
[1:45:17] things the way they are why I think it's
[1:45:19] good that we come together fellowship
[1:45:21] together and I just I just longed to get
[1:45:24] with the Brethren and talk to them and
[1:45:27] so forth all the different churches and
[1:45:29] Brotherhood I love that see is something
[1:45:31] about it that's real I was just thinking
[1:45:36] to myself you know there was a statement
[1:45:40] that the Prophet says when we were
[1:45:41] working together it will send a revival
[1:45:43] into every church when working together
[1:45:46] it'll send a revival into every church
[1:45:48] and I've been at services where I've
[1:45:50] heard different testimonies I remember
[1:45:51] we had a service here we was hosting
[1:45:53] another church and what the brother
[1:45:55] Isaacson not was sharing his testimony
[1:45:57] how he got filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:58] that bless me that seemed a little
[1:46:00] revival fire sparked through me just to
[1:46:03] hear him say something like that right I
[1:46:05] mean when I heard brother Vince
[1:46:06] testimony over at brother jeans that
[1:46:08] blessed me when sometimes you just get
[1:46:10] amongst the Saints you hear different
[1:46:12] things and it it sets a revival in your
[1:46:14] church this is what happens see and I
[1:46:19] want to I want to make it very clear you
[1:46:21] know because I had this happen a couple
[1:46:23] of times recently and we went to a
[1:46:26] service and and and I didn't tell
[1:46:28] sometime I didn't tell who was preaching
[1:46:30] so I got the question are you preaching
[1:46:33] because what you're asking me and or
[1:46:35] what you're actually telling me not
[1:46:37] asking me if you're preaching I'll go if
[1:46:41] you're not preaching I won't go
[1:46:44] that ain't revival
[1:46:48] that's not revival and hallelujah
[1:46:51] revival is not based on brother Jack and
[1:46:56] last week I was supposed to preach but
[1:46:57] things you know just got changed a
[1:47:00] little bit and that someone's like oh
[1:47:02] man I heard somebody said you got to
[1:47:04] stop doing my pastor now come on y'all
[1:47:06] don't do that don't don't say it like
[1:47:08] that don't be that way right it's okay
[1:47:10] and when we got there last week we saw
[1:47:13] why God did what he did
[1:47:17] won't he do it so you just let God be
[1:47:22] gone and just keep having revival is
[1:47:27] that Alright
[1:47:28] okay let me go on a little bit further
[1:47:30] that's best uh so revival should bring
[1:47:33] one of the characteristic of the revival
[1:47:35] should bring fellowship amongst other
[1:47:38] sister churches a fourth characteristic
[1:47:40] I want to talk about here is reviving
[1:47:42] the church back into a spiritual
[1:47:45] condition bringing the church back into
[1:47:47] a spiritual condition many of us can go
[1:47:50] back and look at various places where we
[1:47:52] were in God and and we can see man I got
[1:47:55] away from that spot
[1:47:56] I want to get back to where I used to be
[1:47:58] in God right and revival is sent in
[1:48:01] order to bring you back to that
[1:48:02] spiritual condition that you were in now
[1:48:05] look at look at this this statement here
[1:48:07] at Ephesian Church the Prophet makes a
[1:48:09] statement says now all right he says now
[1:48:13] what was the spiritual comment of that
[1:48:16] church this is a church of ephesus what
[1:48:18] was the spiritual climate of that church
[1:48:20] it had left its first love my god see
[1:48:25] when we were evolving the church
[1:48:26] bringing it back to a spiritual
[1:48:27] condition it's because the church got
[1:48:29] away from its first love it had left its
[1:48:32] first love leaving its first love of the
[1:48:35] word of god amen was revealed to us as
[1:48:38] having fallen from its origin which was
[1:48:42] Pentecost he says in plain English that
[1:48:44] means this church was in danger of being
[1:48:48] taken away from the leading of the Holy
[1:48:51] Spirit the control of the Spirit this
[1:48:53] was exactly what took place after Moses
[1:48:56] led Israel out of Egypt goes on and says
[1:48:58] this the way of
[1:49:00] I want you to catch that the way of God
[1:49:03] was to lead them by the cloud of fire
[1:49:07] prophetic utterance miracles and science
[1:49:11] and god-given wonders so God's Way of
[1:49:15] leiva's people is through a cloud of
[1:49:16] fire prophetic utterance miracles and
[1:49:20] science and I got given wonders see
[1:49:23] that's why I say you know look we're not
[1:49:24] looking for revival month denominations
[1:49:26] they have rejected the Prophet for this
[1:49:28] day hallelujah
[1:49:29] right and if we gonna have revive we got
[1:49:32] to come back to the vindicated and word
[1:49:34] that got promised for this hour you've
[1:49:36] got only have revival underneath the
[1:49:38] message remember I told you if my people
[1:49:42] called by my name everybody can have
[1:49:47] this you have to be called by his name
[1:49:49] and you have to belong to him
[1:49:52] how you gonna have revival baptized in
[1:49:55] the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:49:57] huh how you gonna have revival like that
[1:50:00] glory to God amen amen
[1:50:03] it won't happen Church unless we come
[1:50:05] back to this word we won't even see
[1:50:07] revival revival is on the word the
[1:50:10] revealed word that's been given to us
[1:50:11] the way of God was to lead by the cloud
[1:50:15] of fire prophetic utterance miracles and
[1:50:19] signs and god-given wonders this was to
[1:50:21] be accomplished by God elected I like
[1:50:23] this
[1:50:24] God elected God ordained and God equip
[1:50:29] and God sent God sent what God sent me
[1:50:40] now if it's a woman preacher leading a
[1:50:42] church you're not in revival
[1:50:46] because God never called a woman to
[1:50:48] preach the gospel and let me say this
[1:50:51] again never not one time in the Bible
[1:50:57] that God called a woman to preach the
[1:50:59] gospel now I know nowadays we we just
[1:51:01] you know sister say I felt the mantle
[1:51:04] drop which one which mammal dropped on
[1:51:08] you because dismantle the mantle you
[1:51:11] talked about is not in God's Word and we
[1:51:13] need to follow the pattern of what's in
[1:51:15] the Word of God God never ordained a
[1:51:18] woman to preach the gospel it's gonna be
[1:51:20] a god-sent man alright so if you you
[1:51:25] call yourself having revival and it's a
[1:51:27] woman preacher that's not revival that's
[1:51:30] confusion praising that is confusion and
[1:51:37] God is not in nothing like that
[1:51:39] hallelujah invite me for what know a man
[1:51:43] they know that want to bring your church
[1:51:45] break we're not bringing the church over
[1:51:51] for that praise the Lord Amen that's why
[1:51:54] we're not fellowship with anything and
[1:51:56] everything we want to fell see what
[1:51:57] people that's fellowship and around the
[1:51:59] word the true Word of God Genesis to
[1:52:01] Revelation I mean well I just felt fire
[1:52:04] that's fine you feel fire but you know
[1:52:07] you ain't you still in call I'm gonna
[1:52:12] tell you it ain't but a few churches
[1:52:13] that's gonna say this today aim but a
[1:52:15] few ain't but a few most churches gonna
[1:52:18] go right along with it well you know
[1:52:20] that was for that time and you have to
[1:52:23] in you have to you have to give context
[1:52:25] for the time so you telling me what do
[1:52:29] what you actually telling me as God is
[1:52:30] dumb that's what you're telling me that
[1:52:34] God my God can only think about that
[1:52:37] know what God wrote was eternal
[1:52:41] it wasn't just for that tires for that
[1:52:44] time this time and if it's at IMATS it
[1:52:47] is gonna be for that too
[1:52:48] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:52:52] and forever
[1:52:54] not some time all the time
[1:52:57] praise the Lord somebody I told you this
[1:53:03] reviving for everybody it's for if my
[1:53:06] people which are called by my name
[1:53:10] praise it praise God any high but we
[1:53:14] don't use that scripture up something
[1:53:16] but you better really read what is what
[1:53:18] it's saying Amen hallelujah all right
[1:53:20] I'm going on a little further
[1:53:22] God sent man with the whole camp being
[1:53:26] dominated by a Holy Ghost move the they
[1:53:30] rebelled and warned it a set of rules
[1:53:32] increase go by then they wanted a king
[1:53:34] then they wanted to be exactly like the
[1:53:36] world and went into complete apostasy
[1:53:39] and oblivion that that is exactly how
[1:53:41] the first church age started it will get
[1:53:43] worse and worse into the Holy Spirit is
[1:53:45] completely rejected and God must destroy
[1:53:47] the people so what we're seeing here is
[1:53:49] people have gotten away from the word
[1:53:50] the children of Israel was a clean a
[1:53:54] clear example they would get away from
[1:53:56] the word so often especially in the book
[1:53:59] of Judges they they'd be doing very well
[1:54:00] for season it done very well they
[1:54:03] servant got they got got first then
[1:54:05] their style start allowing themselves to
[1:54:06] get influenced by some of the other gods
[1:54:08] of the other nations and they get away
[1:54:11] from God then they go into bondage amen
[1:54:13] they they gif they get free from bondage
[1:54:15] then they go back into plumbers gonna
[1:54:17] get free from and it was just a cycle
[1:54:19] just seemed like they can never break it
[1:54:20] but the only time they would ever come
[1:54:23] out of a man bondage is when they turn
[1:54:25] back to God hallelujah and all the time
[1:54:29] you're gonna come out of spiritual
[1:54:30] bondage as when you turn back to God let
[1:54:35] me go on a little further here there's a
[1:54:38] statement made Oh glory to God in
[1:54:44] revival I can just imagine sometimes we
[1:54:49] get a little carried away in our worship
[1:54:52] but you know Paul said we worship God
[1:54:55] it's called here see and if you ain't
[1:54:58] talking about us then we ain't worship
[1:55:00] yet can I say that again
[1:55:03] if you ain't talking about us that we
[1:55:06] ain't start worshipping yet praise the
[1:55:09] Lord somebody because we supposed to be
[1:55:12] worshipping God in a way that's called
[1:55:14] here see and actually what they'll says
[1:55:16] that you just in your flesh
[1:55:18] I don't heard that you know sometimes I
[1:55:22] was singing at different places a
[1:55:23] brother Jack just singing in his flesh
[1:55:26] and what you're really saying is that I
[1:55:28] really like what brother Jack doing I
[1:55:30] wish I could do that
[1:55:32] that's what to really say hallelujah
[1:55:35] somebody but but see the greatest form
[1:55:38] of I mean flattery is criticism hello
[1:55:44] somebody
[1:55:45] so info criticized you must be doing
[1:55:47] something right I learned a long time
[1:55:49] ago that folk will not throw rocks they
[1:55:52] will not throw bottles they will not
[1:55:54] throw sticks at trees that don't have
[1:55:57] fruit huh praise the Lord
[1:56:01] people don't throw rocks and bottles at
[1:56:03] trees that don't have fruit the only
[1:56:04] time you're gonna get hit with a rock
[1:56:06] you're getting hit with a bottle get hit
[1:56:09] with a stick because your tree must have
[1:56:11] some fruit and it's fruit that people
[1:56:15] wrote come on somebody that's why you
[1:56:18] get hit the way you did hit but that's
[1:56:22] alright don't worry let him throw a rock
[1:56:24] let him throw a bottle and let him knock
[1:56:26] off some fruit because I'm a bear again
[1:56:29] praise God I know God has a cycle God
[1:56:34] has a low yes lovely God has an inside
[1:56:39] my roots and I'm gonna bear again no
[1:56:43] matter what I go through
[1:56:44] praise God search you got to know who
[1:56:48] you are in Christ but I could imagine
[1:56:51] because because we we might worship a
[1:56:54] little different you don't even know
[1:56:58] worship like I can take you to some
[1:57:00] places for you to see some worship and
[1:57:02] I'm a teen you only you know when you go
[1:57:06] to some of the places that I go to and
[1:57:07] see worship you don't criticize you just
[1:57:09] get right on me you'll be trying to find
[1:57:15] get in where you fit in prays alone and
[1:57:18] when everybody around you doing it then
[1:57:19] is everybody in a flesh no you in your
[1:57:23] flesh if you ain't got a step it's help
[1:57:37] out there for you if you want if you
[1:57:40] wanna step but don't criticize us
[1:57:43] because we want to worship I mean some
[1:57:46] of y'all know when y'all was even in in
[1:57:48] denomination you had your step the
[1:57:50] message that come to take your step
[1:57:53] the message to give you motor step
[1:57:55] provides message they come to take this
[1:57:59] from you so if we want to cut a rope
[1:58:02] we'll cut it wrong when you get good to
[1:58:06] you this is what we used to do and we
[1:58:08] did that just on music now I'm doing it
[1:58:11] on revelation understanding I got
[1:58:16] understand I know why I shout man when
[1:58:21] John saw his name he shouted to glory to
[1:58:24] God you know hallelujah they might have
[1:58:30] said it something different if then if
[1:58:31] John was actually from Africa it might
[1:58:33] be written a little different John saw
[1:58:36] his name and he let out a dance glory to
[1:58:45] God a man church but see I want I want
[1:58:48] to just drop this look because there's
[1:58:50] something that the Prophet said right
[1:58:51] here in our city the message message to
[1:58:54] the resurrection look at this he says
[1:58:56] this how easy the Jews condemned Jesus
[1:59:01] when they say when they walked through
[1:59:03] the Red Sea and the fathers had and on
[1:59:06] dry land and all these miracles and
[1:59:08] signs and then still didn't believe that
[1:59:10] that was their God who was doing the
[1:59:13] same thing that's the way it is today
[1:59:14] it's a failing of the church theology
[1:59:18] and such an educationist took the place
[1:59:20] of the old-fashioned mourners bench we
[1:59:22] used to have a mourners bench bench
[1:59:24] you took that down in the basement we
[1:59:27] don't use it no more that's the truth
[1:59:29] all the fire we ever had on the altar a
[1:59:33] man we put it in the stove what we need
[1:59:37] today you say well brother Branham I'm
[1:59:39] afraid you'll get a little fanaticism a
[1:59:42] little wildfire look at what he said
[1:59:45] right here in your city I'd rather have
[1:59:48] a little wildfire then no fire at all
[1:59:55] so I hope I just set some people free we
[1:59:59] rather have some wild fire there's no
[2:00:03] fire at all
[2:00:04] let the folk dance if they wanna dance
[2:00:07] let them worship if they wanna worship
[2:00:10] however they want express themselves to
[2:00:13] God
[2:00:13] let the people express themselves
[2:00:17] I felt like Moses Pharaoh let my people
[2:00:21] go
[2:00:22] a man Church alright you've gone we
[2:00:27] gotta get a little criticism but
[2:00:28] understand if we didn't get the
[2:00:30] criticism we must not have been doing
[2:00:31] something right because we worship God
[2:00:34] in a way that's called here see amen
[2:00:36] now you notice let me finish read this
[2:00:39] I'm gonna say something here sure I
[2:00:40] would I can put up with a little
[2:00:42] fanaticism before I could put up with
[2:00:44] something that's so icy and stiff and
[2:00:47] starch and what else and ungodly how can
[2:00:56] God move into a place like that go to a
[2:00:59] place in the spiritual thermometer
[2:01:02] registering a hundred below zero
[2:01:06] somebody say man and everybody stretch
[2:01:12] their neck and look around and see who
[2:01:15] said it preacher said you interrupt me
[2:01:17] it's just one little mama he actually
[2:01:21] called a mammy his boy got old enough
[2:01:24] and he moved away from his little church
[2:01:25] that he was going to and didn't worship
[2:01:27] in a certain way and he got away from
[2:01:29] that he went to this little church and
[2:01:30] he took his momma says mama was dressed
[2:01:32] so old-fashioned he was just embarrassed
[2:01:34] to have his mama come to church and mama

[2:01:38] this church was a a sadiddy' you know

[2:01:47] preached and nobody say man everybody
[2:01:49] just sitting there right and it was very
[2:01:51] cold so preacher got to saying something
[2:01:53] about Jesus and the mom said Amen and
[2:01:56] preaches it

[2:08:23] is over which and young people if you
[2:08:26] coming up with people are you just in
[2:08:28] your flesh and I'd rather you have some
[2:08:31] little wildfire getting your flesh every
[2:08:34] once in a while don't don't don't don't
[2:08:36] don't don't don't be too reserved on God
[2:08:38] man you want God to give it to you
[2:08:41] sparingly we're gonna give it to him
[2:08:43] sparingly give them everything you got
[2:08:46] oh my god brother Jai it's gonna be
[2:08:51] fanaticism that's okay we'll take some
[2:08:53] of it if we get too crazy we know good I
[2:08:56] don't see some of them dancers get out
[2:08:58] of hand to praise the Lord young people
[2:09:00] so you don't people bring dances that I
[2:09:02] know that came from the club
[2:09:08] and I'm gonna tell you something when
[2:09:10] you're dancing you know the Holy Ghost
[2:09:12] check you if one of your moves ain't
[2:09:14] right and when you check you guess what
[2:09:16] you do you don't do that with no more we
[2:09:28] talk about revival all right this last
[2:09:32] element of revival is close communion
[2:09:35] with God close communion with God and I
[2:09:41] would just remembered a scripture out of
[2:09:42] Revelation 3 and 20 behold I stand at
[2:09:45] the door and knock If any man hear my
[2:09:48] voice and open the door I will come in
[2:09:51] to him and will sup with him and he with
[2:09:55] me and this is to the individual because
[2:09:58] as a church the church has put Christ on
[2:10:00] the outside he's knocking on his own
[2:10:02] church door trying to get back in
[2:10:04] but it's the individual that is allowing
[2:10:06] Christ to come back in and when it comes
[2:10:08] back in they're having close communion
[2:10:10] with one another hallelujah listen
[2:10:13] there's a statement here that I want to
[2:10:16] read out of the Queen of Sheba and but
[2:10:19] before I read that brother Branham made
[2:10:21] a couple statements he says I'm sorry
[2:10:23] just a little little thought that I had
[2:10:25] here I want to inject Moses had to leave
[2:10:27] Egypt in order to experience the burning
[2:10:31] bush and when he got to the burning bush
[2:10:34] he was having close communion with God
[2:10:37] but in order for him to get into this
[2:10:40] place of close chameleon there was some
[2:10:42] stuff that he had to leave and I want to
[2:10:45] tell you this as we turn from our wicked
[2:10:48] ways it brings us into close communion
[2:10:53] with God the Queen of Sheba the Prophet
[2:10:58] says this then if he sends the thing
[2:11:01] it's up to the people to receive it or
[2:11:04] reject it and I'm telling you our God
[2:11:06] has already sent it so receive it and
[2:11:08] each one as an individual not because of
[2:11:12] your church standing but as an
[2:11:13] individual it doesn't lay with them
[2:11:15] whether your church accepts it it's
[2:11:17] whether you accept it salvation is a
[2:11:19] person
[2:11:20] work it's a personal faith not a
[2:11:22] universal Church faith but a personal
[2:11:25] faith in the Lord Jesus no matter if
[2:11:27] father don't believe it and mother don't
[2:11:29] believe it it's what you believe and
[2:11:31] notice when they did receive it them
[2:11:34] great signs and wonders in Jubilee broke
[2:11:36] out but when they rejected it
[2:11:38] then darkness and gross darkness come to
[2:11:40] the people and old people of the last
[2:11:44] day can't just see why gross darkness
[2:11:45] has fallen on this country the gospel of
[2:11:47] Christ has been rejected you don't want
[2:11:50] to believe that but it's a noted fact
[2:11:52] it's the truth is too bad but it's the
[2:11:55] truth and I think that if that be the
[2:11:57] case that each one of us should take
[2:11:58] inventory of our own experience and our
[2:12:01] own standards with God and see how we
[2:12:04] stand in his sight look at this he says
[2:12:06] not by any tradition not by any mental
[2:12:08] workup but by that clothes hidden
[2:12:12] communion not because of our
[2:12:14] intellectual conception and so I love
[2:12:16] this as not by mental worship you know
[2:12:17] you know there there are times where you
[2:12:19] know we don't come to church every
[2:12:22] Sunday for somebody to give us the
[2:12:24] priests music you go to other churches
[2:12:29] that man we had the funeral other
[2:12:31] weekend I saw this one fella man he
[2:12:33] could wait a couple of days just
[2:12:36] couldn't wait one one guy on the drums
[2:12:38] he just when you gonna let me go when
[2:12:39] you gonna let me go and just he just
[2:12:41] needed me to just see just a couple
[2:12:43] things and once he got it out he went
[2:12:49] and sat down somewhere that's not what
[2:12:51] we talk that's a--that's a mental workup
[2:12:54] I'm talked about man you this thing been
[2:12:57] burning in you old oh we can and finally
[2:13:00] that song it got me pull it right out
[2:13:04] you right we talked about we talked
[2:13:06] about instantaneous spontaneous worship
[2:13:10] hallelujah I'm watching some of y'all
[2:13:13] man y'all getting into y'all groove I
[2:13:15] come out here and brother Solomon
[2:13:17] started that little song at the end and
[2:13:18] he brought me out and everybody's you
[2:13:20] know well get ready to do something here
[2:13:25] you feel that Oh hallelujah
[2:13:30] it says and I think that is that that be
[2:13:35] the case though that each one should
[2:13:37] take inventory of our own experience and
[2:13:39] all standing with God and see how we
[2:13:40] stand the sight not buying a tradition
[2:13:42] not by name in a workout but by by that
[2:13:44] close hidden communion not because of
[2:13:49] our intellectual conception of his Creed
[2:13:50] or of the Creed of the church or even
[2:13:52] the knowledge that we have with the word
[2:13:54] but some people knows the word real well
[2:13:57] but don't know the author Moses note the
[2:14:03] word real well but that blessed hiding
[2:14:06] place was it not ridiculous to see Moses
[2:14:10] standing in a king's court with all the
[2:14:11] celebrity with the finest of language
[2:14:14] trained and all the wisdom of the
[2:14:15] Egyptians and smart but God had to take
[2:14:18] him out behind the mountain for 40 years
[2:14:21] God schooling is always right
[2:14:23] God schools his man and remember as
[2:14:26] trained as an Egyptian a sheep herder
[2:14:29] was it was an Obama was an abomination
[2:14:31] and isn't it strange to see how foolish
[2:14:34] it would seem in the hearts of men with
[2:14:36] wisdom with a man with all of his great
[2:14:38] intelligence with all the great armies
[2:14:40] from his education step away
[2:14:43] I like this y'all stay with me on this
[2:14:45] one step away from his worldly wisdom
[2:14:47] step away from his great associates and
[2:14:50] go out behind the desert to become into
[2:14:54] an abomination to the people that he
[2:14:56] wants associated with think about that
[2:15:00] he goes on to make a few more statements
[2:15:03] about that may I say this with reverence
[2:15:06] it's tonight that when God calls men
[2:15:09] many times he has to step out of the
[2:15:11] political ranks out of the social ranks
[2:15:15] and walk out into a place if it would be
[2:15:17] necessary if his associates had to say
[2:15:20] he's going crazy or he become a Holy
[2:15:22] Roller but it's that secret place
[2:15:25] it's that spot oh don't miss it my loyal
[2:15:27] friends every one of you that's received
[2:15:30] Christ of all your teachings your fine
[2:15:32] passes your great affiliations with your
[2:15:34] churches which is all right don't miss
[2:15:37] understand me but you are trying to
[2:15:40] place that before this but that little
[2:15:44] time that God gets you away from all
[2:15:46] your associates gets you gets you way
[2:15:49] back in the corner brings you into a
[2:15:52] place in a secret place where that the
[2:15:55] wisdom of the world becomes so
[2:15:58] insufficient to where all the education
[2:16:00] that you ever had doesn't mean nothing
[2:16:02] Internet divine presence till the lust
[2:16:05] of the eye gets so dim you can't see it
[2:16:08] anymore until the love of money has
[2:16:10] completely vanished away from you and
[2:16:13] when you stand there alone with your
[2:16:14] over God that's the thing that counts
[2:16:17] that's the thing that makes you forget
[2:16:19] all you ever knew he goes on that's what
[2:16:27] Moses that's where Moses had to get so
[2:16:29] we talked about communion with God
[2:16:32] that's where Moses had to give and what
[2:16:34] a beautiful picture got revealed himself
[2:16:36] there and a burning bush and Moses know
[2:16:39] more about God in five minutes in the
[2:16:43] presence of that burning bush then he
[2:16:44] learned forty years in Egypt that's the
[2:16:47] place to be alone with God the next day
[2:16:52] on his road to deliver Egypt or Israel
[2:16:54] out of Egypt with his wife setting on a
[2:16:56] meal with it with a little child under
[2:16:58] each arm and the long whiskers blowing
[2:17:00] in a stick in his hand going down the
[2:17:02] road screaming at the top of the top of
[2:17:04] his voice or said Moses where you're
[2:17:06] going I'm going down to Egypt to take
[2:17:08] over a one-man invasion going against a
[2:17:11] greater in number that all the world had
[2:17:14] the chariots and horsemen and spearmen
[2:17:16] and bowmen of Egypt and one little old
[2:17:18] wrinkled up eighty year old man with a
[2:17:19] stick in his hand and the white whiskers
[2:17:21] blowing going down to Egypt to take over
[2:17:23] and the thing of it was he did it
[2:17:26] because he had been alone with God
[2:17:30] that's where the church needs tonight I
[2:17:33] want to see today is not some fantastic
[2:17:36] not some new denomination but beter but
[2:17:39] but to be alone with God oh all
[2:17:41] selfishness all malice all fear or
[2:17:45] unbelief just fades away and God becomes
[2:17:48] preeminent
[2:17:50] there it is that's what makes the person
[2:17:52] different that's what made Moses
[2:17:54] different that's what makes you
[2:17:56] different when they went down that time
[2:17:58] with the vision not with his education
[2:17:59] he could have called more people
[2:18:02] together with his education than he
[2:18:04] could with his gift I want to read that
[2:18:07] again he could have called more people
[2:18:10] together with his education than he
[2:18:14] could with his gift but Israel was ready
[2:18:18] to receive and they did listen now what
[2:18:23] did they do they were laying out into
[2:18:25] the wilderness and led across Jordan to
[2:18:27] the promised land what a marvelous thing
[2:18:29] you know Moses had to get along with God
[2:18:31] and it was only after he left Egypt that
[2:18:34] he could get to this place we can get
[2:18:36] along with God I don't know what it is
[2:18:38] that God might be trying to call you
[2:18:40] from I don't know what it is that he
[2:18:42] might be trying to call you I don't know
[2:18:44] but he wants to have that sweet
[2:18:46] communion with you sometimes it's a
[2:18:48] career sometimes a man we put so many
[2:18:52] things in front of God that we we just
[2:18:54] don't give him the proper time that he
[2:18:56] needs right but but revival should
[2:18:58] produce a man close communion with God
[2:19:02] that should be one of the
[2:19:03] characteristics and and I tell you I
[2:19:05] think as we just all do a personal
[2:19:07] evaluation a man just a personal
[2:19:10] inventory God where some of these areas
[2:19:13] of my life that I can give up where I
[2:19:14] can I can get close with you and
[2:19:16] sometimes what God does he start taking
[2:19:18] some things from you
[2:19:19] I just learned you know as I read
[2:19:24] scripture man I was this morning the
[2:19:27] Lord spoke something to me I was reading
[2:19:28] about Joseph and I wanted I want to tell
[2:19:30] you I was looking at Joseph and in
[2:19:31] prison I mean how do man get from prison
[2:19:35] he was his daddy's favorite son and here
[2:19:37] he and just went out one day looking for
[2:19:40] his brothers and from that day on his
[2:19:42] life change all he was doing is trying
[2:19:45] to do it his dad action to go look for
[2:19:46] his brothers man ended up in in a pit
[2:19:49] from hit went to part of his house part
[2:19:51] of his wife total Island the man ends up
[2:19:53] in prison and I was just thinking about
[2:19:56] ministering and Joseph was a young man
[2:19:58] he was 17 years old when he left his
[2:20:00] daddy's when he not I mean when he left
[2:20:02] him when his brothers put him in a pit
[2:20:03] he was 17 years old
[2:20:04] he was a young man think about the how
[2:20:08] young he was standing before Pharaoh
[2:20:09] giving him all this wisdom Joseph but
[2:20:12] when I thought about Joseph pilla prison
[2:20:14] the Lord spoke to my spirit he says
[2:20:16] where you are is right where I want you
[2:20:20] to be and I want to tell you that today
[2:20:25] I don't know what you're going through
[2:20:27] but I want to say where you are is right
[2:20:31] where God wants you to be in this place
[2:20:37] so have close communion with you let's
[2:20:42] pray
[2:20:46] father we're just moved by your word
[2:20:51] guard your profit has been bringing us a
[2:20:56] little thought for us to ponder these
[2:20:59] five characteristics of revival and how
[2:21:01] we just see that the various things Oh
[2:21:04] God
[2:21:06] we can just from the quote that he gave
[2:21:09] us for these various things the winning
[2:21:11] of souls to Christ we've seen that the
[2:21:14] church restored to his right condition
[2:21:16] for seeing that close communion with God
[2:21:22] we're seeing that God but we want to
[2:21:25] give more fellowship amongst other

[2:21:43] things just go over our heads but Lord
[2:21:44] let us really dysreflexia gave me this
[2:21:50] morning and reading the life of Joseph
[2:21:52] and just thinking how he sometimes we
[2:21:54] look at circumstances in situation we
[2:21:56] wonder how did we get here how did it
[2:21:58] happen like this but God you said where
[2:22:01] we are is right where you want us to be
[2:22:05] had Joseph not been where he was then it
[2:22:09] could not be raised to the position that
[2:22:12] you have for him so help us thought to
[2:22:15] accept and to walk by faith Lord in
[2:22:20] these places with you where you've
