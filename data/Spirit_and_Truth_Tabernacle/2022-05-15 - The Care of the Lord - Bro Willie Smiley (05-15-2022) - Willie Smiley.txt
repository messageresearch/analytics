father we just thank you o god for this opportunity once again to be able to be in the service of the living god this morning lord we just come lord humbly as we know how before you father realizing the gift is the ability to get oneself out of the way lord we know that it's about you it's about just channeling your thoughts through human lips oh god this morning lord we ask that you just pray for the saints that's not here this morning and just out and about and traveling we pray that you give them traveling mercies oh god and watch over and keep them lord and bring them back safely and we just appreciate this this opportunity to stand behind the sacred dance lord we thank you for uh brother jack's confidence sent us lord jesus and we just don't want to portray portray that confidence lord we just want to be loyal oh god and uh just subject to the spirit lord we don't want to speak in just ill way father we just want to be used this morning we're grateful lord we actually just continue to bless us we thank you for uh watching over my family and bringing my daughter to this uh junction in our life and uh helping us with our studies to get this degree and just pray that you just continue to be faithful just ask these prayers and blessings in jesus name amen amen amen amen let's just get our bibles out this morning it's good to be here it's good to see brother stephen and nope amen it's good to see everybody this morning i look like harmony over this good to see her y'all just y'all just pray for me i i kind of i couldn't print so you know i'm still a little old-fashioned i'm a paper i should have been a paper boy coming up i still like the paper but i told brother jack i guess i'm gonna have to maybe learn i watched brother troy and he'd be pushing and scrolling and i said man i'm still i like to have mark all on my papers and bible we're gonna look in isaiah 54 this morning all right so y'all pray for us i had to try to do this when i was out of town and we prayed at the computer act right but nevertheless y'all know me i might be here and then i'll be there just depends on where the spirit of god moves isaiah 54 we want to start at the 11th verse it says o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colors and lay thy foundation with self fires i will make thy windows of a gates and thy gates of kaaba knuckles and all thy borders of pleasant stones all and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children that's a powerful statement in itself it says in shall thou be established thou shall be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear right now and from terror for it shall not come near thee behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold i have created the smith and the that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their and their righteousness is of me said the lord amen may the lord add a blessing to his word this morning he may be seated uh we want to use as a little topic this morning um the care of the lord and uh as a sub title uh the strength of his promises and i i've kind of i i just have several things that i i desire to preach but i'm like brother jack was saying a while back uh when he preached on um the recent message that he was preaching on hurt people hurt people sometimes god gives you things and but it takes the unction of the holy spirit to instruct you when he wanted preach because i believe that you know seed sown got to be sown in the right season in order to bring forth a harvest is that right that's just the laws of of nature is is uh to be able to do things at their appointed time the scripture says there's a time and an appointed time for everything under the sun so the main thing we want to always be in in the perfect will of god is that right um as we begin to look at our text this morning um we we we find um god addressing the redeemed is that right yes amen um and and a lot of times a lot of times people might feel like well god don't care come on but as as i was reading as i was reading the text um this morning and i was just thinking about the mere fact that he's addressing the the saints of god is a real indication of his care yeah a lot of times you know um and you know i was i'm i'm still maturing my mother's still alive by god's grace and uh but coming up a lot of times um i i totally misunderstood my mother not realizing the the mere fact that she would address me right and address situations was an indication that she cared you know i i've had the opportunity over the last couple of weeks to spend time with my my sisters and we we got the we just got the talking and just talking about my mother and just our upbringings versus you know how she allowed us to do certain things and and how you know uh i raised my children and how she raised her daughter and things of that nature she was sharing with me the fact that um my niece was a little upset because my daughter my sister was a little bit uh strict on her and i said well uh i was strict also but but i but i said something to my my sister said but i wouldn't change a thing all right if i had to do it all over again i'll do it the same way that i've done it right based upon scripture and also based upon amen my personal experience in life right amen right right that i would do it the exact same way i would hope that it would garner a different result a lot of times but i don't think that because a lot of times we say hindsight is 20 20. but but i i believe that in in order to get the proper results as believers yes right yes you got to stipulate certain things as believers we have got to realize we are believers right is that right and and our approach cannot be a carnal approach in order to get the desired results from the word all right right this this i was sharing some things i'm gonna get to where i'm gonna go i guess y'all just pray for me uh i was i was talking to my son uh justin uh at the graduation and we were talking and he did a podcast with some of his fellows and this is this young man that was about a few years younger than me he passed away and he had this podcast dealing with uh uh kevin sammy's if y'all ever heard of him and and yeah i used to listen to his podcast a little bit but it's just a lot of things that he he he he referenced wasn't from a biblical standpoint and and the thing of it is when it's secular you're not going to get a balance right you you and then if you're teaching people anything right uh and in this legit you want well he's not a christian i don't think but for me in order to get the balance you got to bring the balance through the scriptures because anything else won't pass through right brother bannon preached a thinking man's filter right and so uh a real thinking man wants the word amen amen let's say that again amen right you you want the word if if not if you're not a thinking man's you want a conal opinion all right all right but see as a christian i'm a thinking man so i want a word perspective because that's the thing that's going to bring the balance all right let's go a little further right when we when we when we think about ministry when when we think about brother jack uh it's just not excitement i like to be exciting we've been excited the other week we were excited we almost total building down i like to be apart as much as possible tearing the building down all right but i'm one that i like to calm everybody down all right all right you know i like for us to be excited but i also like for us to get a realistic view of what's being said not just being excited all right see the address of the word is the care of god channeled through a ministry all right all right right yeah right so it's it's when we're excited but also we want to we want to you know be inspired to recognize god amen right because so often the presence of god goes unrecognized is that right and a lot of times we we can't see be be beyond the human instrumentality the veil we get caught up right that's what this brother smiled all right right but but but what about the the the care of god what about the inspiration we just being a channel where god is trying to show us how much he cares right see god cares yes he does do you right hey man and then you we gotta ask the question then what do we really care about all right come on how much how much of the the perspective of the work we really care about we care as long as we're not getting our feelings hurt all right all right right we we maybe we care as long as uh uh um it doesn't interfere the word doesn't interfere with the way that we think now i'm gonna get off this in a minute cuz y'all real quiet on me i'm about to preach to the lights this morning see but but you know that's kind of how it is it's like you know we care as long as the word don't rub us the wrong way in our idea we care praise god hallelujah but but when the word begins to uh uh rub us the wrong way and rub out our carnal ideas we sit back we can't we can't hardly get no amens from the church like i can't hardly get no amens from y'all this morning see so it's just so unfortunate that god's got a god is a god of variety and i'm one of those guys that you know i just like to ruffle your fellas a little bit it's all right now i can preach it happy too but it just ain't seem like lately he gave me those happy preaching messages now if y'all want me to make it happen then y'all got to pull see when y'all sit and stare at me kind of kind of you know y'all don't realize now the gift will start going and meddling all right but long as y'all smiling and happy and pulling an amen amen we'll keep we'll keep it we'll keep it happy amen but here in in the in the scriptures um just kind of land a little foundation this morning so that we'll understand that uh god cares right i think brother jack kind of preached a little on the lines but we'll just see how things go he says oh ye oh you afflicted once now watch his address if he didn't care he wouldn't make no references no statement all right all right he'll just kind of let us go through and suffer right won't be no no real absolute giving yeah and and listen church for me we can't make it that way right we're not built that way as as human beings we we're built uh we we need uh affirmations and different things of that nature is that right hopefully that was the right word that's right right we we we at times we need something you know to settle us it's it's like it's like the baby that falls down you know the mother's care he picks it up oh but y'all know how you know grown folks have to revert back oh baby you know daddies don't hardly work like that much but you know daddy's just got to find a way down you know and and it's not you know uh and and i'm gonna say something to the fathers too because we were real we're uh but shut up sit down men don't cry those are lies those are some of the worst things that has ever been taught you you you you want to project uh masculinity right but at the same token you want to show care you want to show love love us boys get up shut up don't cry what man don't cry men do cry [Applause] men do cry men will cry let men get up underneath pressure they'll cry every all the wives that's been mad a little while know what i'm talking about well praise god huh it's the truth men will cry they will pout they will suck so don't tell your children sit down shut up don't cry this daddy you gotta show some sort of care some sort of compassion because if you don't they'll get it from somewhere else and it might not be the place that you want them to get it from [Applause] is that right man you know we we was taught i remember my dad my dad just had this this masculine thing all wrong i remember one time he came down from up north and uh my mom told me to wash the dishes and he told me my son ain't washing no dishes and she said he gonna wash the dishes and he said he ain't gonna wash no dishes and i was sitting there like god you got me it's like buddy you gonna leave you you're gonna leave and i'm gonna be in trouble you know so you got to get me out the hot seat right there's nothing wrong with you know it's it's a part of it's a part of of growth you know i thank god that i learned how to wash dishes and and clean and cook and different things you know i i don't do it as much as i used to but when my wife go away i still got two young fellas at home and i when you know i feel like well those are the times where i i bring out the cooking skills all right all right you know i i want to try to get back to cooking a little bit more i bought i bought some oxtails and stuff home now listen listen listen i didn't finish the rest of the story i bought some oxtails and stuff home last night because i was like man i want to you know i won't even box here it's been a minute this and that but i kind of forgot how to cook him so my wife came with all this meat doing in there you go cook i like no no you know my care was that i bought them and you don't care if you let you go you'll cook them you know until i get my skills back up you know i'm a little rusty with with the kitchen with the kitchen but but while she says oh yeah afflicted once right right and and that's uh afflicted is of a problem or illness cause pain or suffer to a burden bother a distress right god is showing listen your afflictions mean something right amen right amen other as as christians and i think brother jack was was working with some things uh wednesday night with witnessing uh you you can't be an appropriate witness outside of care right amen true christianity is about a man care all right i mean we we i i don't know somewhere i think uh the message supposed to produce uh a perfect understanding right when that which is perfect could come that which is in part supposed to be done with but i still think sometimes we operate in part understanding instead of a man complete understanding is that right this just from my observation because of our attitudes and our approach to people whether they're nominal or not right all right right and and i think you know um what what makes the difference for people like the queen of sheba what made the difference for her is when she came in in contact with with the church she saw everything in order right she saw the the proper characteristics on display right and see uh when when god said amen the son of man on the earth he had the appropriate response to every situation is that right that's right yeah that's right his his response was was was just spot on right woman at the well spot on he understanding the immaturity of the church and said man y'all go get some videos yes and that's the same thing sometimes people see you talking to somebody wait a minute what rap doing why reb got to be doing anything inappropriate all right right come on come on come on i'm quite quite sure you know being that there was different discrepancy when they came back and saw jesus oh you know how people wheels turn a lot of times right yeah oh so was that the reason why he sit this way all right come on church there's a there's a realistic response that people have even even as christians we have we have realistic a lot of times carnal responses but we do have realistic responses that's right right our wheels get determined whether it's you know sometimes the spot on the devil or whatever it might be they they are real responses right we have whether we say it or not in our thinking a lot of times you know they might not have said it but jesus jesus already knew y'all can't handle this but amen my leading ain't being led by almighty god [Applause] right amen i'm here for the sake of one amen amen yeah i i'm here for the sake of one right it she had a thirst yes and i'm the water i'm gonna introduce it now brother jack just preached this i'm i'm gonna introduce her to something that's far beyond anything and then that she's faced she tried she tried men men didn't work right and men and women still won't work drugs won't work i'm a living witness to those things those things don't work it takes a man coming in contact with the river of life oh hallelujah right those are the only things that are quenched the thirsts that we have is that right glory to god you just look at society it's it's it's people trying to quench verses that'll never be quenched never be quenched young men weed and you know men and being money and this and you'll never do it you'll just you just always be grabbing and always seeking and there'll just never be a settling amen in your heart right and i don't know about you you know you you want to be settled right see jesus i mean in this scripture trying to bring a settlement because you know we've all been afflicted come on we we we've all been hurt [Applause] right don't know which way to turn i think we've all been there a time or two amen glory is that right come on that's that just goes along with life naturally and spiritually well i'm saying sanctified holy goats feel and fire baptized yeah but you got an enemy that you gonna fight there's there's you know because you we don't start out as as christians mature come on the holy ghost comes in us as a button all right come on and there's got to be some growth there's got to be some some maturity then you can sing the song the things i used to do i don't do no more [Applause] but as long as you're immature you're going to continue to do the same thing you're going to continue to act the same old way until god comes in amen and brings about the change you're going to be the same yeah yes sir right oh glory to god so so you know we we we've all been tossed and driven right but but god's desire right is for us to be settled right according to ephesians 4 right watch watch the blending y'all just got to watch the blending of the thoughts right god gives a five-fold ministry for the perfecting the maturing the growth of the church amen is that right see i believe that my approach is definitely different than it was way back when all right because way back when boy it was no grace it was a graceless gospel it was it was just blood no blood on the mercy come on no blood since the dixon might have sung this song is dripping with blood i used to read sister dixon's famous song thank god for mr dixon right but but just our approach it was no blood sometimes it still feel like that it's no blood it's no grace until we end something until until we need grace as long as we don't need grace it's just blood it's blood crucify him [Music] crucify him it's the slaying of the with the sword but then but then when it's us and then when it's our family [Music] as long as it's my children huh you heard with brother smiley's brother smiley children as long as it's my wife as long as it's my cousin but when it's yours those that know the words of prayer please pray for me [Music] i got a little baptism in me i feel good now somebody's sister you know about that you kind of look like you came up in the back to chat come on those that know we get and dignified with it but long as it's somebody else's crucify him is have you heard it's everybody it's it's everybody you know on the phone huh and here's the here's the ironic thing when when when a story is first told it's told one way when again on the west coast it's totally different it's like it's been embellished it's been so many lies added to it it's like grand day what i was preaching in carolina i had to tell them listen church if y'all if y'all want to know anything about brother smiley just get my number and call me on the phone and i'll be glad to tell you what's going on cause i ain't scared right come on yes come on one thing one thing about it you know it's a message that i want to preach boy i tell you see i'm i'm i'm in the discovering phases of my life and so when you're in the discovery and i'm gonna just touch it i'm gonna leave it alone come and preach it you know you you no longer fear the opinions and different things of people come on i'm gonna leave that alone [Applause] oh yeah i got a whole lot to preach on now church but i'm here this morning i don't know how far i'm gonna get it it's it's a lot when last time brother jack was was was out and we preached we was talking about a whole a holistic view because we we've spent so much time on doctrine right and the bible said let us put aside those things right and let us let us go on let us go on huh we we've got to go on we've got to take the people further than the doctrines of baptism and whether brother brian we all know i'm not sitting around fighting with anybody whether or not brother branham was a prophet and all that i don't have time no sir is that right because one thing he said this is for the people who god has given me to preach to so so i'm i'm listen if you're a new convert that's one thing but most of us has been around for i'm gonna say it like we used to say um ten years all right i don't know what umpteen deals but you know we used to say that we've been around a little minute is that right i have to get y'all you know um all right so so we we gotta go because you you start watching where's the youth we're the young people where the young adults where where's our grandchildren all right come on all right all right somewhere we missed something right and this is the season for us to continue to grow up like like brother brother jack was saying earlier okay y'all said this well we'll implement this right that's right there's things i think is needed for this season right glory to god because what we're seeing right what we're seeing we're seeing more divorces than i've ever seen we're seeing families shaking at the core right right glory to god young young men and young women just out here you you see young people that growing up in the churches that we've pastored doing things unimaginable that you never could have grasped you never would have you never could have conceived that they would be in these situations but could it be that we missed it this this ain't no slight it's i'm not trying i ain't that smart now i'm just being inspired in the season right things is just dropping in my spirit because my own personal uh experience right that god is uh uh awakening like we say everything is in his season everything is in his time maybe it wasn't the season but we're in the winding up time we're in the winding up season and then you know we do have a promise we gonna get to it i don't know how i'm gonna get but but i'm feeling good anyway this morning we have been given a promise by god for our young people right uh but you know we we've got to we've got to re-examine right we we've got to really understand who i am who we are right because you could be in church you could be in church and most people in church if you asking a question who are you who are you i'm saying i'm a leader alone but i feel good who are you apart from your shout out all right who are you apart from your amen in the charge all right on a personal note who are you in the spiritual and in the natural yeah come on who are you well i'm in the message that's not who you are right see who if i ask these young men in here this morning who are you as an individual right can you define for yourself on a personal note this is who i am see if not you should never even get married all right all right all right i'm gonna leave that alone before it's gonna be for another day but i feel good right it's a lot i probably never should have gotten married when i did oh my god right because i didn't even know who i was as an individual all right right come on glory to god and and growing up and all you all it is you fighting here is fighting over doctrines right and and we we're wadding people just by the grace of god you know says erica we all have still been been together all of these years that's right right but cause all we heard was a bunch of infighting over this doctrine and that doctrine and this doctrine and that doctrine yeah right and and the laity they don't even have a clue for the most part let me go now but i'm glad in this season that he can't right he he cares right glory to god he cares i i i believe that through through all of my ups and downs and through everything that i've gone through and the things that i'm present they wrestling with god cares right see oh yeah flick the one tossed with the tempest and not comforted wow what a powerful statement right all right right with all of the millions of so-called believers in a world is not comforted wow wow like you know we worse off than we've ever been we got the opening of the word of god but but i mean we kind of worse off than we ever been look at look at society as a whole right in a day when the book has been open the mighty conqueror descended right his ministry was to declare he is here amen then you know it was a question axe if that's the case right if there's bomb and gilead then why the people ain't healed right and i know a lot of things comes down to predestination and the foreknowledge and the leading of god we can bring all those different things but we got to bring these things in here to shape the way that we begin to think in this hour right amen see you you look at the the the the modern-day christian them and even brother bannon he strike this right because he was watching the difference uh when the church got money all right right and when the church grew up right right and status now we got five of buildings we got more of this and we got more of that he said we were better off out on the streets with a tamarind amen with old base drum y'all don't know nothing about that and a wash bowl y'all don't know nothing about that huh i know some of the old timers though see y'all young people y'all don't know nothing about that y'all ain't old enough huh before before we got all of these elegant you know musicians and all of this but the people the state of the people are worse off than it's ever been right people people are tossed like never before like like the tempest on the sea right tops these young generations talks help me pre-sister nelly [Applause] cc cincinnati sat under me 23 years so i know she arrived with me if nobody else will she understands me praise god but it's it's the truth could could this be why folks are hanging up marriages after so many years people don't even know what love is really a lot of times people don't even know what a good man is people don't even really know what a good woman is oh y'all gonna preach with me come on people people walking out people walking out and leaving nice houses nice cars and everything else he don't love me really have you turned around two or three times in your house huh he faithful he lawyer he go to work come on people right see these we got to get an understanding of care right and and understand care manifested yes sir yes sir right because we we like to look up come on y'all don't get quiet on me now right i'm about done i don't know how i got a little time right see that now i'm i'm bringing it here but let's let's let's bring it down to 2022 god veiled in his church christ in bribe form what's what's our response or how are we responding yeah right i think we need to grow up a little bit more glory to god i'm preaching to me too uh because hey you know it's it's all illumination it's here a little there a little line upon line precept upon precept come on well i've been in the church 30 years that man i don't even impress me no more well i can quote brother branham said on page i ain't impressed by that no more right that just shows you you got an ability don't show that you got a maturity it don't show that care is in your heart cares being made manifest because somebody asking for two dollars you gotta get him to sign a promissory note to pay you back [Applause] y'all want to talk to me preach people come on right and that's what brother battle said did he not say that all right right it used to be where you know and and times gone by where you could go borrow if you you we knew our neighbors back then it was a it was a village and you could go you know sister silent may child going on over there across the street to tell sallie mae that that uh i need a cup of sugar come on but but but you know now we we're more educated now we got a little bit more money a little bit more prestige now and and you know and i know and the hood is rough but we outside of the hood now y'all never talk to me and we don't even know our neighbors

bring it right down right to the seats i don't care but let me keep going and keep going keep going see you know it used to be it was a time in scripture where man you knew who was christians and who weren't christians that's right when when the disciples were were filled with the baptism of the holy ghost giving power from the people around them knew who they were they knew the difference right and people people argue with you or argue with us or try to argue with us about dress standards and all of those different things right see it used to be a time when i was coming up uh if you if you saw a woman you know dressed a certain way you automatically kind of knew that she was a street walker or she was a prostitute right that's right uh if you was a little young that folks in the neighborhood used to call you fast she's so fast a little tight pass on you and see look at it today it's even worse like brother i winkers i bet i can't i hope this don't hurt y'all feelings but i'm

suffer with you know some things i just won't say most of the time i won't say nothing but there are times when you when you get a little because i care i care that's that's the care part of me i remember one time i remember one time um um years ago we we had a big meeting at brother west coast church thank you jack remember this man must have been about 1500 folk at the meeting and uh some some young sister she went to the she went to the gas station close to my mother-in-law house and some some guy just off the rip he tried to wrap or nothing he just offered her some money right and she went out and told her brother and he comes storming in there like you know aggressive so the dude just kind of told him well what do you expect look how she look look how she just said we we i'm just trying to bypass the formalities and get right down to it [Music] come on now see so who could they be offended could they be offended see real care real care would say baby girl uh what are you called that church what church that ain't church outfit that drop it while it's hot outfit that's swinging on the pole outfit but that that ain't church that's right that ain't church we still believe in modesty [Applause] but we still believe in looking good right oh to god if y'all know anything about me i enjoy fashion i enjoy dressing up right but you ain't gonna never see me with pass so tight you can see the veins popping out my leg they so tight if i sit down too fast i'ma bust the seat out i i you know what i i have to tell my dudes and i'm like whoa whoa whoa that's a little bit too much there there it's a little bit too tight bruh they were laughing i said i got to be able to if i can't do nothing else like the song say i got to be able to raise my hand sometimes i still got to be able to do my dance too right but but the the inspiration of these things i ain't getting nowhere i'm out of the clothes hey maybe another time we'll pick it back up right there's a lot in here i ain't got nowhere you know i just kind of like a i guess a big brother talk all right you know it's kind of a big brother talk right sometimes like you know coming up we used to hate to hear my my older cousin uh we used to try to bypass him oh he come junior cause you know see he was out there so he knew what was out there so he used to try to inform us we used to try to bypass the information right but the information was good information right i i may not make you jump i can like i say but i'm just i i got just a different i'm a little bit different we're a five-fold ministry i've been praying god help me change me i wanna i wanna change i wanna i don't wanna meddle i don't i want to make everybody like me and jump up and down and run around the church when i preach but when i get up here i realize you know what it's 23 years a pastoring and some years of evangelism where i just be inspired and let him use me so all i can say is you know you thank god when those times come where i preach a faith message i thought this was going to be good different i thought this was going to be really different you know it just ain't going to make you shout but our guarantee is gonna make uh it's gonna help us we got we got we got these kids growing up in church right and it's it's important for um now i don't know their names i know they're your children so you help me out okay alexander all right it's important as he grow up he learn and get an understanding who he is as a person under understand his family dynamics right his family pedigree but also learn who he is as because he's got to have something that'll keep him when the pressure yeah see you i'm watching people fall apart i'm watching folk that i've known been around church my mind is being blown and and and and all i could come up with right god god starts striking something is like what it is is that people do not know who they are if if you take them away from the main church body they don't know who they are right we we saw good looking and fine and this and that and the other she don't know who she is he don't know who he is and and all of a sudden it's like wow huh come on we we get older and and the wild factor kind of like and we realize who am i you wake up out this far who am i yeah see come on church i'm preaching god i'm finna i'm gonna go though right i'm gonna take a little tax on it and i kind of gave y'all a backdrop of it but we we gotta we gotta it's so important right because because you see of what what we see is ministry people up and down and young it's like praise god my wife always told me you start out a message and everybody with you when you done everybody quiet i'ma tell you something this was good [Applause] [Music] it's been good to be here today see y'all probably ain't even know i was going to preach this morning that brother didn't tell y'all i did it so y'all couldn't have stayed home but smiling preaching lord i ain't going you know like like they say when preachers who preaching the meeting but smiley gonna preach to me when he preaching i won't be at that service no i'm just kidding people people enjoy me and i i trust that y'all enjoy me i i believe brother jack enjoyed me we we've been we've been ministering together for over 20 years we've gone quite a few places and we we just work together we're different but i by listening to brother jack he just do it a little bit different than me but uh if you really listen to him close he'd be right on saying on the same page right be right on the same same page same wave lengths and sometimes you know as the pastor i know this you might want to say certain things that you can't say and then you'll be like lord who should i bring up cause i need this fear and he never you know what he never really even tells me uh what's on his heart a lot of times i just hear it i hear it all right i hear his heart when he preaching amen i know what's on his heart by listening to him right i know where he's at by listening to him i catch things because i can i can hear amen i can i can hear i listen to the preachers i i know it's on their heart i hear y'all shout i sit in the back i listen ain't nothing wrong don't stop shouting that ain't what i'm saying don't stop shouting don't stop shot don't stop shy i can't i can't jump up out of that chat away that y'all do anyway let the musicians make their way up i had to get up in stages back there y'all be them jumped up and sat down before i finally oh lord you know after after working after doing construction 40 years but hey by the end of the week these knees boy i'm starting i'm starting to go back to the gym a little bit so i'm going to try to work on the leg i'll watch out them popped up hey man i'll be finally trying to get up they're gonna sit down so i just i have to give you one of these numbers when i stand i'm standing i'm not sitting back down at the end of the service when you say let us all stand i'm standing i ain't sitting back down i'm gonna walk out that door because it's gonna be a minute but i but i but i trusted uh something was said like i say i i i had it all outlined but i'm just built in a way that i just learned to let god have his way uh y'all just continue to pray for me we'll be at brother joe's next week and uh pray that you know we i'm just i'm grateful for this season that i'm in that you know we could take all of my years of experiences and my growth and what god is revealing to me now and just share it i i want i want to say something i want to make myself clear right as as your brother i'm not here to be offensive i'm not here to hurt your feelings right i'm just here to try to um educate us a little bit more right point us to something that's because we we we we we're walking out in deep waters now we ain't not on the bank right and as as we walk out god god has given us giving us what's needed for the season in the hour that that we're in right because we got we got loved ones we got family members and uh we we got our children and you know even though my children are grown i'm still growing with them i'm still learning and you know uh i said i i still call them and send them texas and all that that's needed you know i i sent i sent uh one of my fellas a text last night to let him know i appreciated his effort you know you i still realize you know what they they're adults and they doing their thing but i want them to always know that i i love you i may not like what you're doing but i do love you i i care and i'm always thinking about you right so y'all continue to pray for me right continue to pray for one another continue to pray for brother jack right uh in the ministry here um and i i just want to say that so because i want you to i you know i want everybody to understand who i am right and my my sole objective when you come up here you may shout you may not i'm fine with that i just joke with y'all about that but i'm going to say how what he places on my heart and sometimes you may not like it sometimes you may if you differ with me that's that's your choice you know like i preached out of town a couple of weeks ago and a brother was standing there waiting on me that's why i want to talk to you i disagree with what you said that's good that's your that's your choice but but when i when i let him know you know this is what i was trying to say and da da da da well i well that's your choice but it don't change don't really change anything yeah you don't really change anything i i said what i said and i understand why i said that based upon the word whether you agree with that or not i'm not gonna take that back because you don't agree with it as long as i can prove it by not one scripture but i can prove it through the bible i really don't care about your feelings because they hurt right god wanted that to be said man so he inspired me to say it so either you're gonna do it just say lord help me and come up i just continue in the way that you're going and wrecker what a mighty god [Music] whoa what a mighty god [Music] angels [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody jesus one more time in jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] heart [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord how we uh appreciate them brother smiley on the spot in the care of the lord as he was just kind of working through the sermon and certainly just the way god gives it to brother smiley to give it to us we realize god cares amen and you know just looking at the he was going down a channel there how jesus came to the woman and just how you know maybe the disciples just misunderstood uh why jesus is there talking to that woman but uh and maybe all the the the uh just maybe some of the criticism that could have come out of it uh but the reason jesus was at the woman with uh i mean at the well with that woman talking to that woman is simply because he cared amen and he cares enough just for one he'll go out the way just to get to that one i believe god sent us a message this morning to show he cares no matter what we're going through just just a scripture you go back and just reflect on that to the afflicted toast right i mean just those are words that you can really ponder on god god cares he has a special message directly for you in the midst of being afflicted and being told at the end of that you know when he got to the end of the
