[52:27] for him
[52:27] he walked back to the hospital didn't
[52:29] even take a ride just walk back
[52:31] when they got there and re-ran the test
[52:33] his problem was taken care of
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:40] so when we when we come into contact
[52:43] with different things i want to
[52:44] encourage
[52:45] church only belief only
[52:49] believe our god is is faithful
[52:52] you know and we just we're just going to
[52:53] come against the devil on behalf of her
[52:55] and
[52:56] and i found out while she was taken to
[52:58] the hospital
[52:59] there was a lot of concerns and things
[53:01] like this and and we got
[53:02] got when she got there there happened to
[53:04] be one of us
[53:06] on on duty all right
[53:09] one of the one of the saints on duty
[53:13] and and that that that saint of doctor
[53:15] you know was there to kind of
[53:17] see some things through so god know what
[53:19] he doing
[53:20] and just leave it all in god's hands
[53:22] amen amen
[53:24] let's read a second uh i mean acts
[53:27] chapter 2 verse
[53:28] 15 uh for these are not drunken
[53:33] uh as he supposed seeing it is but the
[53:36] third hour of the day
[53:39] but this is that which was spoken by the
[53:42] prophet joel
[53:45] and it shall come to pass in the last
[53:48] days saith god i will pour out of my
[53:50] spirit upon all flesh and
[53:52] your sons and your daughters shall
[53:54] prophesy and your young men shall see
[53:56] visions and your
[53:57] old men shall dream dreams
[54:01] and what we need to gather from this uh
[54:04] passage is that it's pretty much saying
[54:07] god is gonna move
[54:08] in the last days and uh and however he
[54:11] decides to move that's up to him but
[54:14] he is going to move that's a promise a
[54:17] man through scripture so
[54:18] verse 18 says and on my servants and on
[54:21] my handmaidens
[54:22] i will pour out in those days of my
[54:23] spirit and they
[54:25] shall prophesy all right and i will show
[54:29] wonders in heaven above
[54:30] and signs in the earth beneath and blood
[54:32] and fire
[54:33] and vapor of smoke uh the sun shall
[54:38] be turned into darkness and the moon
[54:40] into blood
[54:41] before that great and notable day of the
[54:43] lord come and it shall come to pass that
[54:46] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[54:47] lord shall be
[54:49] saved so the lord had a blessing to the
[54:50] reading of his word shall we just bow in
[54:52] a brief word of prayer
[54:54] god we thank you for the uh privilege
[54:56] and
[54:57] opportunity we have to come into the
[54:59] house of god
[55:01] uh how we appreciate the spirit of the
[55:03] lord that has been
[55:05] um moving in this place through

[55:14] of god it's good to feel the presence of
[55:16] god and good to
[55:17] feel the spirit of god and lord we just

[55:21] do in our midst so we ask that you would
[55:22] just take complete control of the
[55:24] thought

[55:27] word uh realizing heavens and earth will
[55:29] pass away but the word will remain

[59:10] different angles but you know
[59:11] i looked at it from the angle of the
[59:13] catholic church looked at it from the
[59:14] angle of
[59:15] other powerful women that rose up but he
[59:17] said thus saith the lord
[59:19] he said a woman will be vice president
[59:22] or
[59:22] president amen uh pretty much before
[59:25] jesus come he said if it don't happen
[59:28] he says i am a false prophet and he said
[59:31] thus saith the lord right he said it
[59:32] twice
[59:33] right and we saw it manifest itself and
[59:35] then not only that he said i saw a woman
[59:37] she was
[59:38] decked in purple right this is what i'm
[59:41] just telling this division
[59:42] and here she comes out in the
[59:44] inauguration decked in purple
[59:46] even saying she had pearls on i mean
[59:49] this is very precise for a prophet right
[59:51] and uh 87 years you know he said seven
[59:55] things would happen before the coming of
[59:57] the lord jesus
[59:58] and that was the sixth of the seven
[1:00:01] things
[1:00:01] the next thing that happens before the
[1:00:03] coming of the lord he said he said there
[1:00:05] would be debris all over the land of
[1:00:07] america
[1:00:08] so we are we are headed for some things
[1:00:11] and uh and i don't know about you but i
[1:00:12] am
[1:00:13] i i i i know that we're closer now to
[1:00:16] the coming of the lord than we've ever
[1:00:17] been
[1:00:18] and uh and i'm on the expectation amen

[1:02:34] just vindicated this message once again
[1:02:38] once again all right let's uh let me
[1:02:41] start here the junction of time
[1:02:43] um it says my subject this morning if we
[1:02:45] should call it such will be
[1:02:47] the message to the church is the
[1:02:49] junction of time it says and always in
[1:02:51] the days gone by the dispensations has
[1:02:53] always come to their end
[1:02:56] and we hit a junction amen we hit a
[1:02:59] junction
[1:03:00] uh you know and he says um uh there's
[1:03:03] junctions on the highways
[1:03:05] glory to god they junction on the roads
[1:03:08] that we travel
[1:03:09] in this world so so so so there's
[1:03:12] junctions on
[1:03:14] natural highways if i can put it that
[1:03:15] way and there's also
[1:03:17] junctions on spiritual highways
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:21] glory to god and i can just put it like
[1:03:24] this everybody that is in this
[1:03:26] church right now starting from the
[1:03:29] pulpit
[1:03:30] to the back door hit a spiritual
[1:03:33] junction
[1:03:35] every last one of us had to hit a
[1:03:37] spiritual junction and there's things
[1:03:39] that have to
[1:03:39] happen when you hit the junction glory
[1:03:42] to god if we make the wrong decision at
[1:03:44] the junction
[1:03:46] it can create havoc
[1:03:49] glory to god church amen glory so let's
[1:03:52] go on says
[1:03:53] it says there are junctions on the
[1:03:54] highways the junk they junction on the
[1:03:56] roads that we travel in this world
[1:03:58] they junction on this grand old highway
[1:04:00] that we travel to glory
[1:04:01] and always it takes the miraculous to
[1:04:04] speak of omnipotence
[1:04:05] omnipotence is the all-powerful and it
[1:04:08] takes the miraculous
[1:04:10] to vindicate the omnipotence and really
[1:04:12] what i get from that is that
[1:04:14] at a junction we look for god to
[1:04:16] vindicate the decisions that we make
[1:04:20] hallelujah and i'm trusting that god
[1:04:23] will vindicate
[1:04:24] every decision that has been made
[1:04:28] when you hit the junction god vindicates
[1:04:34] oh glory to god i i just this quote just
[1:04:37] hits me i don't i don't remember
[1:04:39] amen the exact word but you know um uh
[1:04:42] uh brother branham was preaching and
[1:04:44] after he finished preaching
[1:04:46] brother walked up to him and said
[1:04:47] brother that could be the 23rd
[1:04:49] chapter you know of the book of
[1:04:51] revelation
[1:04:52] and uh he said i don't want to be
[1:04:53] sacrilegious and add to the word say but
[1:04:55] that could be the 23rd chapter of the
[1:04:57] book of revelation
[1:04:58] and uh and and he said as the brother
[1:05:00] was talking the holy spirit
[1:05:02] came upon the brother he began to speak
[1:05:04] in tongues
[1:05:05] the man had never spoken tongues one day
[1:05:06] in his life but he began to speak in
[1:05:08] tongues
[1:05:08] and while he was speaking in tongues
[1:05:10] after the sermon glory to god
[1:05:12] he was speaking in tongues he say uh
[1:05:14] there was three people
[1:05:16] standing in the area and the three
[1:05:18] people say oh
[1:05:19] that don't need no interpretation
[1:05:22] they say why because it's perfect prince
[1:05:25] the man didn't know french he said but
[1:05:27] that is perfect french that don't need
[1:05:29] no interpretation brother brandon said
[1:05:31] wait wait wait wait before y'all say a
[1:05:32] word
[1:05:33] you go over there you go over there you
[1:05:35] go over there and write down what he
[1:05:37] said
[1:05:38] each one came back with what they wrote
[1:05:40] down and each one was exactly the same
[1:05:43] hallelujah and i believe in there he
[1:05:45] says uh he says
[1:05:46] uh you know you chose the heart away
[1:05:49] you know it was and it wasn't easy but
[1:05:52] when you got to the junction
[1:05:54] come on somebody you chose god didn't
[1:05:58] make you do it but
[1:05:59] you chose the hurdle way
[1:06:03] and then an interpreter say this is my
[1:06:06] way
[1:06:07] and because you chose the hardaway it
[1:06:09] will bring to pass
[1:06:10] a tremendous victory in love divine
[1:06:16] i'm expecting the miraculous a man to
[1:06:20] speak of
[1:06:21] omnipotence all right he says and only
[1:06:24] the miraculous can do that
[1:06:26] he says teach another word is a very
[1:06:28] fine thing
[1:06:30] he says and uh it comes faith comes by
[1:06:32] hearing and hearing the word
[1:06:34] but it always takes miraculous to
[1:06:36] vindicate that the omnipotence still
[1:06:39] lives and reigns
[1:06:40] we must have the miraculous
[1:06:45] glory to god i'm expecting that in this
[1:06:48] church
[1:06:49] glory to god amen if you have to use
[1:06:51] sister wayson to prove that he's
[1:06:53] miraculous
[1:06:54] then let him use sister wayson but i'm
[1:06:57] expecting that
[1:06:58] all right now another thing that i want
[1:07:00] to point out here because this is going
[1:07:02] to be important as we go forward i'm
[1:07:03] going to the message here you him
[1:07:05] uh as we go forward in the sermon we're
[1:07:07] just laying the foundation
[1:07:08] amen for this it says every uh every
[1:07:11] junction of time
[1:07:13] god sends forth prophets
[1:07:17] then angels and gives a warning so in
[1:07:20] every junction of time
[1:07:21] god sends forth prophets then angels
[1:07:24] and gives a warning like in uh before
[1:07:27] the antediluvian destruction before
[1:07:29] every other time god always sends
[1:07:32] warnings
[1:07:33] first amen and then he says um
[1:07:36] uh he cannot put punishment on the earth
[1:07:40] without and be just without first
[1:07:42] sending
[1:07:43] warning all right glory to god so he has
[1:07:47] to send a prophet then he says
[1:07:48] angels and that's to give a warning to
[1:07:51] the people
[1:07:52] glory to god glory to god we have
[1:07:53] received our prophet for this day
[1:07:56] amen god always does it that way before
[1:07:59] uh when a junction occurs all right i'm
[1:08:01] gonna stop right there in that
[1:08:03] particular quote
[1:08:04] and uh and this will i'm gonna move on
[1:08:06] down to
[1:08:07] uh when their when their eyes were open
[1:08:10] all right so just just bear with me
[1:08:12] because i believe that this is where we
[1:08:14] are now
[1:08:14] also as as i just kind of define this a
[1:08:17] junction
[1:08:18] is a point where two or more things
[1:08:22] are joined
[1:08:26] and i preached this amen the first
[1:08:28] sunday of the year this is my first
[1:08:30] message the first
[1:08:31] junction and i said a junction is a
[1:08:34] point
[1:08:35] where two or more things are joined
[1:08:38] right come on church i don't have to be
[1:08:42] that basic i mean that that basic with
[1:08:44] you
[1:08:45] right i mean it's not it's not there's
[1:08:47] not no uh
[1:08:48] no big revelation that's going over
[1:08:50] anybody's head
[1:08:51] this should be very simple i said a
[1:08:54] junction is a point
[1:08:58] where two or more things are joined
[1:09:01] and i told the church on on that sunday
[1:09:03] now we're at a junction
[1:09:05] and then i had to announce something to
[1:09:07] him after service and brother smiley
[1:09:09] announced something after his service
[1:09:11] and can't y'all see two or more things
[1:09:13] joined
[1:09:16] what does that tell you if ain't no
[1:09:18] other church there we
[1:09:19] are there we're at a junction
[1:09:23] and decisions have to be made at the
[1:09:26] junction
[1:09:27] and god has to confirm the decisions
[1:09:30] god has to prove that he is in the
[1:09:32] decision
[1:09:34] and i i am i'm telling you right now i
[1:09:36] don't want you to be alarmed i am
[1:09:38] expecting god
[1:09:40] to prove that he that that the right
[1:09:42] decision has been made
[1:09:44] i'm looking for god himself to confirm
[1:09:47] some things
[1:09:48] i'm looking for god himself to vindicate
[1:09:50] some things
[1:09:51] hallelujah church i'm looking for the
[1:09:54] supernatural
[1:09:55] i'm looking for the miraculous i'm
[1:09:57] looking for omnipotent to do something
[1:10:01] i'm omnipotence must speak the
[1:10:03] miraculous will take place
[1:10:06] all right watch this and christ is
[1:10:08] identified
[1:10:10] in uh and it's in in these ages now um i
[1:10:13] want to bring this in because
[1:10:14] a junction is also a place where we
[1:10:16] might have sometimes we have to turn
[1:10:18] corners and sometimes they have to keep
[1:10:21] going straight
[1:10:23] you know you ever been into like you get
[1:10:25] over to england they don't have
[1:10:27] a lot of stop lights they have the
[1:10:29] roundabouts
[1:10:30] right and then a roundabout you still
[1:10:32] kind of have to slightly make a
[1:10:33] a turn to get through that roundabout
[1:10:36] and you better know if you
[1:10:37] you get lost in a roundabout you can oh
[1:10:39] my god
[1:10:41] it might be some trouble but you got to
[1:10:43] know exactly which turn to take
[1:10:46] if you don't if you're not careful
[1:10:48] you'll find yourself right where you
[1:10:49] started
[1:10:52] and now you now you're starting all over
[1:10:54] again because you got lost in the
[1:10:56] roundabout
[1:10:59] sometimes they have some real large
[1:11:01] roundabouts
[1:11:02] traffic coming from all directions but
[1:11:05] you better know how to squeeze your car
[1:11:07] into if you want to get off there you
[1:11:09] got to squeeze that car in to get it off
[1:11:10] there
[1:11:11] otherwise you stuck in the roundabout
[1:11:13] trying to oh what am i
[1:11:15] you can't be like that you got to
[1:11:16] sometimes be a little bit aggressive
[1:11:21] and with the devil church sometimes you
[1:11:24] got to be aggressive
[1:11:26] you can't always be on the defense you
[1:11:29] need to go on the offense
[1:11:31] praise god amen as believers we don't
[1:11:35] always run
[1:11:36] from the devil when the season change
[1:11:39] we chase devil
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:43] hallelujah glory to god
[1:11:47] wanna chase a thousand and two will put
[1:11:50] ten thousand to a flight i told you i
[1:11:53] don't even understand that mathematics i
[1:11:55] don't realize
[1:11:56] i have no idea what three will do and
[1:11:57] what fool will do and what five will do
[1:12:00] i know this much we won't be defeated
[1:12:03] [Applause]
[1:12:05] glory to god so when we get to terms
[1:12:10] we get to junctions and then we have to
[1:12:12] make turns sometimes it's difficult for
[1:12:14] some people
[1:12:18] it's difficult for some people right
[1:12:21] and this is what the prophet said in
[1:12:23] christ is identified the same in all
[1:12:25] generations
[1:12:26] it says and now we find that in
[1:12:29] each one of those ages ages usually
[1:12:32] people don't want to believe it
[1:12:34] because they're already set in their way
[1:12:37] ain't none but the truth right and and
[1:12:40] the reason that people can't make the
[1:12:42] turn with you
[1:12:43] because they already set in their way
[1:12:45] they already in a made a decision before
[1:12:47] they come to the pastor
[1:12:49] and actually the the coming to the past
[1:12:51] is really not to get any counsel
[1:12:55] it's not to get advice it's just to
[1:12:57] inform
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:02] i'm just coming to inform you i'm coming
[1:13:05] to let you know
[1:13:07] so when you stand before the church you
[1:13:08] can tell them that i talk to you
[1:13:10] all right no problem i got the
[1:13:12] information i'll share with the church
[1:13:14] but if you wanted uh you wanted somebody
[1:13:17] to give you counsel godly counsel
[1:13:20] now that's a different approach come on
[1:13:22] somebody
[1:13:24] pastor i like to talk i like to get some
[1:13:26] godly counsel
[1:13:27] i like to get maybe what the lord might
[1:13:28] be sharing with you
[1:13:33] right hey man this rifle get lost in the
[1:13:35] roundabouts
[1:13:36] you know all right now i'm just
[1:13:40] i'm just going i'm going forward amen
[1:13:43] but but we don't want to see nobody lost
[1:13:44] in the roundabout
[1:13:46] right just just follow just follow some
[1:13:50] some of us or a man uh like like in
[1:13:53] in the duck family there's one duck
[1:13:56] anointed to lead
[1:13:58] everybody else follows if we had all the
[1:14:01] ducks trying to lead
[1:14:02] we would see no ducks in the south
[1:14:07] but some duck had to submit and say you
[1:14:10] know what i'm a follower
[1:14:12] i hear what you're saying come on when
[1:14:15] that duck say
[1:14:16] hunk i hear what you're saying it sounds
[1:14:18] pretty good
[1:14:20] all right i think god is in the duck
[1:14:26] all right it says uh usually people
[1:14:29] don't want to believe it because they're
[1:14:30] already setting their way you're turning
[1:14:32] a corner
[1:14:34] you're turning a corner you're building
[1:14:37] a building
[1:14:38] and then get to the corner everybody's
[1:14:40] running this way and they don't want to
[1:14:41] turn that corner
[1:14:42] but the building goes that way if the
[1:14:46] word
[1:14:46] says it goes that way see there's where
[1:14:49] we get those junctions of time
[1:14:51] that's where it's hard that's where men
[1:14:55] had
[1:14:56] had to sweat it out all right so when we
[1:14:58] hit a junction
[1:15:00] sometimes things get a little difficult
[1:15:03] adjustments have to be made
[1:15:05] praise the lord and if you're not
[1:15:07] prepared for a junction
[1:15:08] you know things can happen to you along
[1:15:10] the way you can become what we call a
[1:15:13] casualty
[1:15:13] yeah we don't want that to happen to you
[1:15:16] what we're trying to share with you by
[1:15:17] the spirit is that we are here at a
[1:15:19] junction this is a time of change for
[1:15:22] everybody
[1:15:24] it's a time of change for the nation
[1:15:29] even if you don't want change
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:36] they can have a chair set for you for
[1:15:38] you to be a part of a certain event
[1:15:40] you don't show up to sit in your chair
[1:15:41] they still gotta have the event
[1:15:45] i hope you can read between the line
[1:15:50] they don't have the event glory to god
[1:15:53] you don't stop nothing
[1:15:56] that that's the problem all right we
[1:15:58] feel like we're the ones that can you
[1:15:59] don't stop
[1:16:00] nothing i've learned a long time ago
[1:16:03] somebody will replace you fast
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] my brother taught me that they say you
[1:16:11] think you're the only one somebody will
[1:16:13] replace you
[1:16:14] you come back to church with somebody
[1:16:16] sitting in your chair
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:25] praise the lord anyhow just stay
[1:16:29] stay connected during this junction all
[1:16:31] right so let me go on a little further
[1:16:33] this message when their eyes were open
[1:16:35] um i want to bring this in uh
[1:16:39] and then we'll kind of slip on down a
[1:16:41] little further here okay
[1:16:43] uh how many read the sermon when
[1:16:45] omnipotence speaks
[1:16:47] miracles happen did you you believe that
[1:16:50] certainly omnipotence spoke at every
[1:16:52] junction
[1:16:53] and when the church cooled off and then
[1:16:55] omnipotence spoke miracles take place
[1:16:58] and this is the junction of
[1:17:02] all junctions this is the
[1:17:05] end time the end of the whole history of
[1:17:08] the world
[1:17:09] is right now at hand i want to tell you
[1:17:13] you're not waiting on the future
[1:17:16] you're actually living in it
[1:17:20] right there's a lot of churches they
[1:17:22] waiting on things in the book of
[1:17:23] revelation to be fulfilled
[1:17:25] don't realize it's already been
[1:17:26] fulfilled right
[1:17:28] hey man you stick around here long
[1:17:30] enough we can show you where these
[1:17:32] things have already happened
[1:17:34] right you look at that that this this
[1:17:35] chart over here the seven church ages
[1:17:37] that's revelation one two and three
[1:17:40] completed already completed
[1:17:44] amen and at the end of you know leaders
[1:17:47] in church age which is the age that
[1:17:49] we're living in
[1:17:49] right now right we're we're living in it
[1:17:52] but we're not
[1:17:53] of it so i'm not allowed to see him
[1:17:58] and i'ma say you're not allowed to see
[1:18:00] it you are the bride of jesus christ
[1:18:03] who happens to be living in laodicea
[1:18:07] glory to god but there's a there's
[1:18:09] there's many things that we can look at
[1:18:10] from a scripture standpoint
[1:18:12] and realize we we're at the end of the
[1:18:13] end there's nothing else coming after
[1:18:16] this
[1:18:16] and when we look at them seven different
[1:18:18] visions we know and six or seven
[1:18:20] already fulfilled like that we already
[1:18:22] know it ain't much
[1:18:23] it's not much left i i'm my prayer is
[1:18:26] even so come lord jesus right
[1:18:28] so so church i tell you uh we got to
[1:18:30] recognize where we are we're not we need
[1:18:31] to get in our hurry for god
[1:18:33] amen we need to get in a hurry uh
[1:18:35] brother west could you say get all you
[1:18:36] can and can't all you get
[1:18:38] amen with the new administration i would
[1:18:41] not doubt that we might not be able to
[1:18:43] meet like this
[1:18:45] i wouldn't doubt it that the church
[1:18:47] doors could get shut
[1:18:49] i wouldn't doubt it amen we saw just a
[1:18:51] little bit of it
[1:18:53] but it might get greater than that all
[1:18:55] right so you better take advantage of
[1:18:57] what you got now
[1:18:58] glory to god all right all right let me
[1:19:00] go it says uh
[1:19:03] the church cooled off and then
[1:19:04] omnipotence spoke miracles take place
[1:19:06] and this is the junction of all
[1:19:08] junctions this is the end time the end
[1:19:10] of the whole history of the world is
[1:19:11] right now at hand
[1:19:12] so you can expect omnipotence to speak
[1:19:15] and you can expect the greatest and
[1:19:17] mightiest miracles
[1:19:19] that's ever happened on the earth will
[1:19:21] happen in the next few years to come can
[1:19:23] i just
[1:19:24] inject something there you know and in
[1:19:26] the past few years
[1:19:28] we saw you can take that one down uh uh
[1:19:31] and i'm gonna come right back to in a
[1:19:32] second
[1:19:32] uh but in the past few years we have saw
[1:19:35] some of the greatest
[1:19:36] triumphs that we ever saw
[1:19:40] i mean if somebody would have told us 30
[1:19:42] years ago
[1:19:43] that we'd be going through some of the
[1:19:44] things we've gone through right now we
[1:19:45] would have told them
[1:19:46] you're a lying prophet you know ain't no
[1:19:50] way
[1:19:50] that's going to happen impossible right
[1:19:53] we were just told there ain't no way
[1:19:55] you know but but when we look at it now
[1:19:57] we have been hit with some of the
[1:19:58] hardest stuff that
[1:20:00] that that i think anybody in scripture
[1:20:02] might have been hit with
[1:20:04] we we had to endure it glory to god but
[1:20:07] but here's the good thing about it
[1:20:08] if we seen satan act up amen
[1:20:12] if we see satan cut loose then it's time
[1:20:16] for
[1:20:16] god also to cut loose so since we
[1:20:20] weathered the storm why not expect
[1:20:23] omnipotence
[1:20:24] to do something miraculous in our midst
[1:20:28] praise god
[1:20:31] he said so you can expect omnipotence to
[1:20:35] speak
[1:20:35] and you can expect the greatest and
[1:20:37] mightiest
[1:20:38] miracles that's ever happened on earth
[1:20:40] will happen in the next few years to
[1:20:42] come
[1:20:42] if jesus tears it will be he says then
[1:20:46] watch for satan to raise up
[1:20:47] raise up his two when all heaven turns
[1:20:50] loose
[1:20:50] all hell turns loose too so he's telling
[1:20:54] us we need to be watchful of that
[1:20:56] the devil's going to try to do something
[1:20:58] and this is why brother branham says
[1:20:59] just stick that closer together
[1:21:02] you have to be under you know satan
[1:21:03] gonna try to do something when brother
[1:21:05] branham was told by the
[1:21:06] you know the angel already saying now
[1:21:07] there's a trap set for you
[1:21:10] now i just just recently as i was
[1:21:13] thinking on this
[1:21:14] if the angel can tell them there is a
[1:21:17] trap
[1:21:18] can't that same angel tell them what the
[1:21:21] trap is
[1:21:23] not not just there is a trap tell me
[1:21:26] what the trap is
[1:21:28] right but the angel didn't do you say
[1:21:30] just be careful there's a trap
[1:21:32] now the reason that the angel didn't
[1:21:34] tell him what the trap was
[1:21:36] because we all must walk by faith
[1:21:42] and not by sight so even the prophet had
[1:21:45] to walk by faith
[1:21:47] and he had to listen to what they said
[1:21:49] now there's a trap set for you
[1:21:51] he says okay i don't know what this is
[1:21:53] but he told the church he said told some
[1:21:55] brothers say
[1:21:56] the the spirit lord told me there's a
[1:21:57] trap set for me i don't know what the
[1:21:59] trap is but it's one set for me
[1:22:01] and he going to church he starts
[1:22:02] preaching he's preaching
[1:22:04] and the next thing you know this young
[1:22:06] man this young woman in church and they
[1:22:07] start making out
[1:22:09] and they say uh just stop y'all that's
[1:22:11] that's not the right time the right
[1:22:13] place for nothing like that please don't
[1:22:14] do that
[1:22:15] stop he goes on the preacher the man
[1:22:17] just looked at him and laughed at him
[1:22:18] just kept on
[1:22:20] you know doing what he was doing with
[1:22:21] his girlfriend brother man i'm saying
[1:22:22] now if y'all want to go get a room or
[1:22:24] something go get a room but don't don't
[1:22:25] do that in the house of god
[1:22:27] and uh you know you're just getting fed
[1:22:29] up with them and the guys start
[1:22:30] you know it was like a challenge you
[1:22:32] know the guy started looking and
[1:22:33] laughing at him like oh lord you know
[1:22:35] and it just struck him this is the trap
[1:22:39] it's like oh there's the trap say okay
[1:22:43] uh and then they say heard a voice say
[1:22:46] if you say blindness they'll be blind if
[1:22:49] you say
[1:22:50] death it'll be death right now whatever
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:54] say is going to be just like that
[1:22:55] challenging him
[1:22:57] hallelujah glory to god so brother
[1:22:59] branham looked at the situation he said
[1:23:01] oh lord i don't i don't know what to say
[1:23:03] and god wouldn't tell him what to say
[1:23:06] but he said then he looked at the
[1:23:07] situation like
[1:23:08] uh uh
[1:23:11] i forgive you
[1:23:14] not death and that thought didn't
[1:23:19] the come was death or blindness
[1:23:22] something evil something wicked
[1:23:24] to show how much power you got
[1:23:27] huh but no but but but he said i forgive
[1:23:31] you
[1:23:31] and and and then he said god said he was
[1:23:33] pleased
[1:23:35] with that decision that he made it was
[1:23:38] showing the character of christ
[1:23:41] that was inside the prophet and we got
[1:23:44] to have that same
[1:23:45] character being manifested inside of us
[1:23:48] so you're gonna go through some trials
[1:23:51] you're gonna go through some temptation
[1:23:53] but you have to be ready as a junction
[1:23:56] to make the right decision
[1:23:58] amen watch with satan
[1:24:02] to raise up his two when our heaven
[1:24:04] turns loose all hell turns loose
[1:24:06] and it's prophesied that there be a
[1:24:08] janison james on the earth in the last
[1:24:09] days
[1:24:10] who would almost impersonate the real
[1:24:12] thing so close it'll deceive the very
[1:24:14] elect if possible see
[1:24:15] we're looking for all of that all right
[1:24:17] now i'm i'm slipping down
[1:24:19] a man here because we talked about
[1:24:22] there was brother branham brought out in
[1:24:24] scripture he said he looked in scripture
[1:24:26] he found seven different junctions and
[1:24:29] uh
[1:24:29] one of them was noah in the ark another
[1:24:32] was moses and the children of israel
[1:24:34] uh the third he says abraham and lot now
[1:24:37] uh when you look at that
[1:24:39] amen uh according to scripture the story
[1:24:42] of
[1:24:42] abraham actually came before you know
[1:24:45] the story of moses
[1:24:47] all right but this you know so we don't
[1:24:48] we're not necessarily listening to
[1:24:50] the junctions chronolog chronologically
[1:24:55] we're just saying the seven junctions
[1:24:58] all right
[1:24:58] and i but i'm preaching it the same way
[1:25:00] the prophet brought it
[1:25:02] right so so we got knowing the ark moses
[1:25:05] and the children of israel
[1:25:06] abraham and lots that was another
[1:25:08] junction the fourth junction he says
[1:25:10] elijah in the 450 prophets of baal
[1:25:13] the fifth junction he said jesus came at
[1:25:16] the fifth junction
[1:25:17] so the first coming of christ would have
[1:25:19] been the fifth
[1:25:21] junction glory to god and then he says
[1:25:23] the sixth junction
[1:25:25] was martin luther and john wesley now
[1:25:28] we're gonna have to dig in there and
[1:25:29] when we get there we will dig a little a
[1:25:31] little further just to kind of show you
[1:25:33] uh just even in the book of revelation
[1:25:35] just when you look at revelation chapter
[1:25:37] two
[1:25:38] and when you look at revelation chapter
[1:25:39] 3 revelation 2
[1:25:41] amen was what we would call the open
[1:25:44] door to the false vine
[1:25:46] amen and and brother branham said that
[1:25:48] the false violence had their revival
[1:25:50] first
[1:25:51] it's all laid out in revelation 2 where
[1:25:53] the false vine went into the dark ages
[1:25:56] and it looked like the church was lost
[1:25:59] it looked like things was hopeless
[1:26:01] it looked like the church wouldn't be
[1:26:03] able to live through a condition like
[1:26:04] that but all of a sudden here comes
[1:26:06] luther
[1:26:07] nailing his 95 thesis to the catholic
[1:26:09] church door
[1:26:10] and light began to come sprout up a
[1:26:12] little bit life began to come back forth
[1:26:15] and when you look at revelation 3 you
[1:26:17] can see the restoration work has begun
[1:26:20] till we get to the end where god sends a
[1:26:22] prophet
[1:26:24] hallelujah and restores everything that
[1:26:26] was lost in the
[1:26:27] in the previous ages we're going to see
[1:26:30] that so martin luther and john wesley
[1:26:32] was the sixth junction and brother
[1:26:34] branham said the seventh junction
[1:26:36] will be the second coming of christ
[1:26:40] now we're gonna we're gonna take our
[1:26:42] time and get into all of that
[1:26:44] but uh you know just i was just writing
[1:26:46] some notes on that and just kind of
[1:26:47] thinking about it
[1:26:48] because there was a prophet that was
[1:26:50] sent to every junction
[1:26:53] yeah and and the second coming of christ
[1:26:57] we know that there was a prophet sent
[1:26:59] but i i have to
[1:27:01] you know just preserve a little bit of
[1:27:02] that because i want to i want to see how
[1:27:04] the bride
[1:27:05] types and some of that because the bride
[1:27:07] is supposed to prophesy
[1:27:09] again amen hallelujah
[1:27:14] we'll get there we're not there today
[1:27:15] but we'll get there can i go back and
[1:27:17] just touch a little bit on the first
[1:27:18] junction
[1:27:19] this was a quote that would share a man
[1:27:22] in our brother's
[1:27:23] chat group and and uh you know and and
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:27] uh i was just blessed when brother
[1:27:28] solomon put this out there
[1:27:30] and this is coming out of a junction of
[1:27:32] time paragraph e16
[1:27:34] and this is talking about that first
[1:27:36] junction in noah's day
[1:27:38] noah a man hamming away building that
[1:27:41] ark
[1:27:41] even though everybody else did not see
[1:27:44] what he saw
[1:27:44] his family didn't see what he saw they
[1:27:46] didn't understand his vision
[1:27:48] but he yet stayed true to what god
[1:27:50] showed him
[1:27:51] in that first junction that shows that
[1:27:53] we're gonna have to have the same type
[1:27:55] of determination
[1:27:56] even when people don't understand why we
[1:27:58] make the decisions that we're making
[1:28:00] why we do what we do but we got to be
[1:28:02] just like noah
[1:28:03] keep hammering away amen
[1:28:06] my daddy told me son if you hit the rock
[1:28:10] and you keep hitting the rock say one
[1:28:12] day the rock gonna break
[1:28:15] praise the lord so we want to just keep
[1:28:17] hitting church
[1:28:18] amen now here um in that in that in that
[1:28:22] and there's a number of things that i i
[1:28:24] could say here let me just see if i
[1:28:26] just brought in the notes when we look
[1:28:28] at the days of noah
[1:28:30] uh there was a great building programs
[1:28:32] that went on a lot of building
[1:28:33] and and we see that right now i was
[1:28:36] saying sharing some brothers
[1:28:37] it used to be where we're having church
[1:28:38] at right now this was way out of town
[1:28:42] where we live that on the east side like
[1:28:44] this was way out of time
[1:28:46] i mean man you you in the middle of
[1:28:48] nowhere now it's becoming the heart of
[1:28:50] the city
[1:28:52] great building programs right people
[1:28:55] multiply on the face of the earth
[1:28:57] uh also as the people multiply
[1:29:00] sin and wickedness multiply hallelujah
[1:29:04] brother branham said sin and wickedness
[1:29:06] set in men's hearts begin to wax coal
[1:29:08] from god
[1:29:10] amen and this is another thing that just
[1:29:12] kind of struck me
[1:29:13] in the days of noah there was little to
[1:29:16] no
[1:29:16] repentance
[1:29:20] little to no repentance you want to know
[1:29:23] how
[1:29:24] hard it is to have a altar call
[1:29:28] i mean you know that the the spirit of
[1:29:31] god is moving in the church and
[1:29:32] you know god then spoke to some people
[1:29:34] but they refused to move from their
[1:29:36] seats
[1:29:38] right if this is not the days of noah
[1:29:41] all over again i don't know what it is
[1:29:43] man back in billy graham's day he didn't
[1:29:45] have to say much for people to go to the
[1:29:47] altar
[1:29:48] but now you can preach one of the most
[1:29:50] powerful sermons where you know god
[1:29:52] is moving on the hearts of the people
[1:29:53] nobody moves to go to the altar
[1:29:57] we are back in the days of noah again
[1:30:00] all them years of preaching couldn't get
[1:30:03] nobody to come on the ark
[1:30:06] nobody nobody out the city wanted to go
[1:30:08] in that arc
[1:30:09] the only only only people that the man
[1:30:11] could get was his own family
[1:30:13] and now today our families fight against
[1:30:16] us
[1:30:18] if this ain't the days of noah i don't
[1:30:20] know what it is
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:25] hallelujah brother branham said god's
[1:30:27] calling for another zeal
[1:30:29] and saying that's a zeal to cry i am
[1:30:31] wrong
[1:30:33] be zealous to say i'm wrong be zealous
[1:30:35] to repent
[1:30:36] in the days of noah there was a lot of
[1:30:38] violence in the land
[1:30:40] i was driving down the street a few
[1:30:43] weeks ago and um you know
[1:30:47] and you know they they they things gonna
[1:30:49] change there too i know it's gonna
[1:30:51] change
[1:30:51] you know some some of y'all have guns
[1:30:53] but you know they're gonna be coming for
[1:30:55] them
[1:30:56] they're gonna be coming for you i'm just
[1:30:59] letting you know that and you know but
[1:31:00] you know these fellas
[1:31:02] they they were supposed to be at a gun
[1:31:03] show and selling guns but now they
[1:31:05] didn't want to go to gun show they put a
[1:31:06] big
[1:31:07] big huge truck on the side of the road
[1:31:09] when you pass by
[1:31:11] and they say we got guns for trump
[1:31:14] i say wait a minute what is this and
[1:31:17] when i say
[1:31:18] violence in the land i mean come on
[1:31:20] church y'all can see it
[1:31:22] you know whether whether it's somebody
[1:31:24] being shot by the police or somebody
[1:31:26] shooting the police
[1:31:27] violence in the land so bad to one of
[1:31:31] the things that
[1:31:32] have never happened people stormed
[1:31:36] the capitol and people got
[1:31:39] shot at the capitol right i mean it's
[1:31:42] just
[1:31:43] it's violence in the land
[1:31:47] uncontrollable in what we call
[1:31:49] lawlessness
[1:31:51] in the book of judges the bible said
[1:31:53] that it was like that
[1:31:54] say every man did what was right in his
[1:31:56] own eyes
[1:31:58] they didn't they stopped following the
[1:32:00] law didn't care who was putting up laws
[1:32:03] violence in the land afraid to just step
[1:32:06] out our front door
[1:32:08] don't know what's gonna happen glory to
[1:32:11] god who would have thought
[1:32:12] fights would happen in the streets
[1:32:14] because somebody voted for somebody else
[1:32:17] violence in the land church we are we
[1:32:20] are we're living
[1:32:21] in the days of prophecy jesus said
[1:32:25] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[1:32:27] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:32:29] amen amen and then he stopped they said
[1:32:32] as it was in the days of lot
[1:32:35] so shall it be in the coming of sun man
[1:32:36] i i you know i'm i'm
[1:32:38] i might one day end up in jail because
[1:32:42] of preaching like this
[1:32:44] we had the new president come in and new
[1:32:47] administration and some of the people he
[1:32:49] done already promoted
[1:32:51] and one guy that he put on the team in a
[1:32:53] very high profile position
[1:32:55] is is known
[1:32:58] no nation not nationally known
[1:33:01] to be a man a transgender guy
[1:33:05] so one of the reporters is trying to
[1:33:07] report
[1:33:08] it's like uh yes sir uh sir can i sir
[1:33:11] can i ask you this sir he said don't
[1:33:12] call me
[1:33:13] sir call me ma'am
[1:33:18] uh sir right ma'am
[1:33:23] sir
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:28] now i'm gonna tell you that reporter
[1:33:30] gonna lose his job
[1:33:33] but but what did god call you yeah when
[1:33:36] you were born
[1:33:37] sir look
[1:33:40] can i just put it this way your gender
[1:33:43] is not
[1:33:44] based on how you feel
[1:33:50] that's a spirit that's not your gender
[1:33:53] it's very simple to know what a boy cat
[1:33:55] and what a girl cat is
[1:33:57] very simple to know a boy dog and a girl
[1:33:59] dog it's very simple and a human
[1:34:02] anatomy to know what a boy is and what a
[1:34:05] girl is
[1:34:07] it ain't based on how you feel
[1:34:10] but see this is this is the days of noah
[1:34:13] and this is the days of lot
[1:34:14] all at the same time
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:24] just trying to move a little just let us
[1:34:26] know but this is this is a junction
[1:34:28] this is this is this and you got to make
[1:34:30] the right turns at the junction
[1:34:32] you know and even even when you're
[1:34:34] taking a stir a turn for the spiritual
[1:34:36] you have to stand stand for the word of
[1:34:38] god
[1:34:40] i'm i'm gonna go as far as say this some
[1:34:43] of us
[1:34:44] may get misplaced
[1:34:47] on our jobs and i i i use the word
[1:34:50] misplace
[1:34:51] because i'm saying that you're gonna get
[1:34:53] another job
[1:34:54] god gonna make a way god gonna provide
[1:34:58] when you take your stand amen
[1:35:01] praise the lord amen all right here
[1:35:05] i'm going back to this quote uh this
[1:35:08] lines up with the days of noah e16 says
[1:35:11] notice uh as noah began to warn the
[1:35:13] people
[1:35:14] and preach many of them laughed at him
[1:35:15] scoffed at him because his message
[1:35:17] seemed entirely out of reason
[1:35:19] and today how could people today when
[1:35:21] they say we got the best doctors in the
[1:35:23] world
[1:35:25] we got the best clinics we ever had we
[1:35:28] got all this
[1:35:28] that and the other way and why do we
[1:35:30] need he says listen today we need divine
[1:35:33] healing
[1:35:34] worse than we ever needed it he says and
[1:35:37] as the days go on
[1:35:39] and on and on so will it be more and
[1:35:42] more
[1:35:42] needed it says it'll come to pass after
[1:35:45] a while that unless a man is
[1:35:47] sealed with the holy ghost his heart
[1:35:50] until he's laid himself
[1:35:51] open to all kinds of things come not not
[1:35:54] any of those who has the seal of god in
[1:35:55] their forehead
[1:35:56] then them tremendous plagues begin to
[1:35:59] fall
[1:36:00] we're at the junction the crossroads now
[1:36:02] now brother random say tremendous
[1:36:03] plagues will begin to fall
[1:36:05] in another place they say plagues that
[1:36:07] they won't have a remedy for
[1:36:11] and and what was this what was this
[1:36:14] we had to wait for the remedy people
[1:36:16] died waiting for the remedy
[1:36:18] and when a new strand comes what do we
[1:36:20] do then
[1:36:21] we keep depending on god the same god
[1:36:25] that brought us through
[1:36:26] this one god bring us through the next
[1:36:28] one
[1:36:30] amen all right
[1:36:33] it says notice and see know how he went
[1:36:36] about warning the people saying
[1:36:38] there was coming to rain the people
[1:36:39] didn't even know that they
[1:36:41] know what the rain meant that that's we
[1:36:44] take it for granted but
[1:36:45] in noah's day they had never ever seen
[1:36:48] rain
[1:36:48] right that was a you know i i could put
[1:36:51] it this way
[1:36:52] that was a new word it wasn't even in
[1:36:54] the dictionary
[1:36:56] there was no definition for rain
[1:37:00] none whatsoever so when noah come out
[1:37:02] and preach like it's gonna rain
[1:37:04] then you gotta imagine what the people
[1:37:06] wait uh
[1:37:08] right break the word down for us noah
[1:37:12] we i mean you know we've we've been in
[1:37:14] school we've been educated we got all
[1:37:15] this
[1:37:16] but where'd you get rain from it came
[1:37:19] from heaven praise
[1:37:20] god and we're preaching things that
[1:37:23] people have never heard before in all
[1:37:25] their life
[1:37:26] but this message has come from heaven
[1:37:29] as a warning to the people before the
[1:37:32] second coming of the lord jesus
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] just as they had to listen to noah's
[1:37:38] message in his day
[1:37:39] we better listen to the message in our
[1:37:41] day
[1:37:44] it'll never rain there's people in the
[1:37:46] world today after two thousand years of
[1:37:48] gospel preaching don't know what it
[1:37:49] means to be born again of the spirit of
[1:37:51] god
[1:37:52] they don't know what omnipotence means
[1:37:54] what that
[1:37:55] god and this great omnipotent power that
[1:37:57] can transform a soul
[1:38:00] from a street to angelic position in
[1:38:02] god's kingdom
[1:38:03] as a son and daughter of god they don't
[1:38:05] understand it
[1:38:06] they're too uh taken up infatuated with
[1:38:10] the things of the world
[1:38:11] glaring flirting with the world so many
[1:38:14] people doing that
[1:38:15] glaring and flirting with the world
[1:38:18] praise god we got some sampsons out
[1:38:21] there
[1:38:23] amen samson sam says stop
[1:38:26] running out to delilah don't
[1:38:31] women like her because you already had
[1:38:34] an experience with a woman like her
[1:38:36] they are trying to destroy you sampson
[1:38:39] but god
[1:38:39] raised you up to destroy them
[1:38:44] oh good god almighty okay now let me
[1:38:47] just let me jump in this
[1:38:49] brother quaker was sharing his testimony
[1:38:50] with me i'm gonna come back to that
[1:38:52] saying that uh uh brother branham had
[1:38:55] gone to
[1:38:56] a restaurant to eat him and some other
[1:38:58] brothers
[1:38:59] they were sitting there um eating and
[1:39:03] saying when when the waitress would come
[1:39:05] brother brandon would always just drop
[1:39:06] his head
[1:39:08] keep his head down every time she came
[1:39:10] over he just put his head down
[1:39:12] look at the at the menu or look at
[1:39:14] something like this he always just keep
[1:39:15] his head down
[1:39:17] see but the other brother when the
[1:39:18] waitress come he put his head up
[1:39:21] and he looked at the waitress and you
[1:39:23] know whatever
[1:39:24] says now after they left that that that
[1:39:26] that that restaurant
[1:39:28] um the brother that put his head up
[1:39:33] snuck around and went go back to the
[1:39:34] restaurant
[1:39:36] to get to know this sister you know what
[1:39:39] i'm saying yeah
[1:39:40] and uh you know brother random had
[1:39:42] already saw what was going to happen
[1:39:44] but he just kept his head down right so
[1:39:46] then the uh
[1:39:47] so the brother got wrapped up in a
[1:39:50] relationship that he should not have
[1:39:51] been involved in
[1:39:52] right an adulterous relationship and
[1:39:54] here he uh he
[1:39:55] so finally gets to the point where he
[1:39:57] wants to repent so he come back to
[1:39:58] brother brown and say
[1:39:59] brother branham i got something to say
[1:40:01] i'm sorry say uh say what is it brother
[1:40:03] say you know i you know remember when
[1:40:05] went to that restaurant and you know
[1:40:06] that that waitress i said he said yeah
[1:40:09] brother i knew about it he said
[1:40:10] remember we was at that restaurant if
[1:40:12] you notice
[1:40:13] i kept my head down rather than lifting
[1:40:16] my head up he said because i knew that
[1:40:18] lady
[1:40:19] had an adulterous spirit on her and if i
[1:40:22] would have looked on the eye
[1:40:24] i would be the one in your condition
[1:40:28] say but i had to put my head down what
[1:40:29] i'm telling y'all there's some things
[1:40:30] that y'all gonna have to
[1:40:35] there there are some posts out there on
[1:40:37] the web

[1:40:43] don't get yourself involved in it
[1:40:46] right you got you got to be very careful
[1:40:48] because the devil is sneaky
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:55] don't flirt with the world samson
[1:40:57] flirted with the world and he got
[1:40:58] himself in
[1:40:58] all kinds of trouble yeah all right he
[1:41:01] says uh
[1:41:01] infatuated with the things of the world
[1:41:03] glaring flirting with the world
[1:41:05] and don't realize that that's an evil
[1:41:07] spirit
[1:41:08] and a great marking signpost for the
[1:41:12] people of this day to watch and be ready
[1:41:13] jesus said when these things begin to
[1:41:15] come to pass lift up your head your
[1:41:17] redemption's drawn now
[1:41:18] not only that but god showed signs
[1:41:20] through enoch he showed signs through
[1:41:22] noah
[1:41:22] and the world laughed at it but one day
[1:41:25] there come a thundering lightning
[1:41:27] there come fire out of heaven and a
[1:41:29] lightning and thunders began to roar
[1:41:31] that was a miracle in itself and rain
[1:41:33] began to fall it goes on
[1:41:35] but here is the great miracle it says
[1:41:38] the miracle
[1:41:39] was of how god had his believing child
[1:41:42] tucked away in the ark of safety
[1:41:45] so when you're looking for miraculous
[1:41:47] things that happen
[1:41:48] sometimes we with the simple things that
[1:41:50] are happening are the great things
[1:41:53] i say the simple things are the great
[1:41:55] things this simple thing of them
[1:41:57] these few believers tucked into a spot
[1:42:01] amen that while uh destruction was at
[1:42:04] hand
[1:42:04] they was protected that was the miracle
[1:42:08] and i want to tell you why the
[1:42:09] structures all around these there's a
[1:42:11] group of people
[1:42:12] that's been protected that's a great
[1:42:15] miracle
[1:42:18] it says god had his believing child
[1:42:20] tucked away in the ark of safety
[1:42:22] all the time the thunder was going on
[1:42:24] the rain was falling
[1:42:25] noah was resting the ark of god
[1:42:27] predestinated for ordained to walk into
[1:42:30] that ark
[1:42:30] when the plagues was falling noah was at
[1:42:33] rest and safety
[1:42:34] who had been laughed at have then
[1:42:36] entered into the rest
[1:42:38] those who they laugh and make fun of
[1:42:40] today because you desire to live a full
[1:42:42] surrendered life to the lord jesus they
[1:42:44] don't realize
[1:42:45] uh they don't realize is you are tucked
[1:42:47] away under his everlasting arms
[1:42:49] don't realize that you're resting just
[1:42:51] as safely as you can be
[1:42:53] in the omnipotence and nothing
[1:42:59] nothing can harm you glory to god
[1:43:04] hallelujah
[1:43:07] amen we'll leave that there just
[1:43:09] bringing them noah but now let's start
[1:43:10] let's strike the second
[1:43:12] junction and we'll slip down to uh
[1:43:15] paragraph e19 in the same
[1:43:19] uh message but moses
[1:43:23] moses and what happened with the
[1:43:24] children of israel amen in egypt
[1:43:28] uh would have been the second junction
[1:43:30] and um
[1:43:31] when we when we look at you know what
[1:43:33] what happened there with moses
[1:43:35] uh the miraculous took place in that day
[1:43:38] god allowed moses to come and
[1:43:40] and uh and speak things into existence
[1:43:43] uh call for flies and lice and and all
[1:43:46] this god was the omnipotent power god
[1:43:48] was moving
[1:43:49] in moses day god was bringing his people
[1:43:52] to a place of
[1:43:53] deliverance god had made a promise in
[1:43:55] abraham's day that the people would be
[1:43:57] in that land for roughly 400 years
[1:43:59] but they would be brought out with a
[1:44:01] mighty hand and not only that he said
[1:44:03] that
[1:44:03] they weren't going to leave the land
[1:44:04] poor hallelujah
[1:44:07] but they would actually be rich as they
[1:44:09] were leaving land and when the children
[1:44:10] of israel start leaving
[1:44:11] you know leaving egypt they borrow from
[1:44:14] the egyptians
[1:44:16] they borrow gold and they burn all these
[1:44:18] things and and and
[1:44:19] the bible said they borrowed it but i
[1:44:21] can tell you this much they were never
[1:44:23] going to give it back
[1:44:25] amen amen they weren't going to give it
[1:44:27] back god wanted to make sure that they
[1:44:30] that the promise was secured to them if
[1:44:32] not only are you
[1:44:34] not only going to leave each other but
[1:44:35] you're not going to leave egypt poor
[1:44:38] right i hope you get that i mean some of
[1:44:40] us have gone through some things in our
[1:44:42] life
[1:44:43] amen but god sees everything that you've
[1:44:46] gone through
[1:44:47] and god is willing to make a way out of
[1:44:49] no way for you
[1:44:50] he said you're gonna leave but you won't
[1:44:52] leave paul

[1:45:08] know they're they're they're
[1:45:09] uh uh you know we would look in this
[1:45:11] daily bible study that i do

[1:45:15] the material that's in the city
[1:45:17] some of these gems are gems that we
[1:45:18] don't see in the earth today
[1:45:21] some of these gems are not gems that you
[1:45:23] see so many things i mean god described
[1:45:25] like but where have you seen that
[1:45:27] so some things that we're going to have
[1:45:28] that we you know eyes have not seen
[1:45:31] ears have not heard what god has in
[1:45:34] store for those that love him
[1:45:36] church i'm on the expectation i won't
[1:45:38] leave paul
[1:45:40] amen amen amen amen i won't leave paul
[1:45:44] that's my revelation anyway
[1:45:46] amen amen amen i'm not that i'm putting
[1:45:49] it all on my own money it's not
[1:45:50] it's not uh uh what they call that uh
[1:45:54] prosperity teaching
[1:45:57] amen it's just a prosperity thought
[1:46:01] but it's not prosperity
[1:46:06] all right but in the days of moses
[1:46:10] uh and pharaoh pharaoh had a question
[1:46:13] there in exodus five
[1:46:15] one and two and let's just maybe pick up
[1:46:16] a couple of these scriptures and
[1:46:18] and we'll we'll bring these out exodus
[1:46:20] five one and two
[1:46:22] uh the bible amen declares this
[1:46:26] praise the lord says and afterward moses
[1:46:30] and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus
[1:46:33] saith the lord god of israel
[1:46:35] let my people go that they may hold a
[1:46:38] feast unto me
[1:46:39] in the wilderness verse two it says and
[1:46:43] pharaoh said
[1:46:45] who is the lord
[1:46:48] that i should obey
[1:46:51] his voice to let israel go and look at
[1:46:54] pharaoh he's a
[1:46:55] he's a rough fellow i know
[1:46:58] not the lord since i don't know him
[1:47:03] neither will i let israel go i'ma tell
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:06] god had to make a man like pharaoh
[1:47:10] god had to design a man like this in
[1:47:13] order to release these types of words
[1:47:14] out of his mouth
[1:47:16] and what we find is that like brother
[1:47:17] whisper told us god has to make a dirty
[1:47:20] man
[1:47:21] for a dirty purpose
[1:47:25] hallelujah and it's some it's going to
[1:47:27] be some some dirty folk that show up in
[1:47:29] your life
[1:47:30] but remember god let a dirty man a dirty
[1:47:32] woman be made
[1:47:34] for a dirty purpose pharaoh wanted to
[1:47:37] know who was the lord
[1:47:39] who is this you know i don't i don't
[1:47:41] know the lord you you're telling me the
[1:47:43] lord said

[1:47:46] am i gonna let his people go

[1:48:10] [Applause]
[1:48:13] he didn't know the lord before but every
[1:48:16] time a plague dropped
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:19] and when his magicians could not get rid
[1:48:22] of the plagues

[1:48:30] omnipotence was speaking
[1:48:32] amen every time a plague dropped now i
[1:48:35] need you to understand
[1:48:36] it was omnipotence hiding himself in
[1:48:39] moses

[1:48:42] but it was omnipotence veiled in
[1:48:44] moses i want to tell you something

[1:49:06] six
[1:49:06] i want you to see this is god in in in
[1:49:10] in moses god and moses give me just a
[1:49:12] little bit of your time
[1:49:14] glory to god here in exodus 6 and verse
[1:49:17] 1
[1:49:18] says then the lord said unto moses now
[1:49:20] shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh
[1:49:23] but with a strong hand shall he let them
[1:49:25] go
[1:49:26] and with a strong hand shall he drive
[1:49:28] them out of
[1:49:30] his land verse two it says
[1:49:33] and god speaking to moses said unto him
[1:49:35] i
[1:49:36] am the lord so moses knew who the lord
[1:49:38] was
[1:49:40] pharaoh didn't know him because pharaoh
[1:49:41] had not had an experience with it
[1:49:44] see when you have experience then you
[1:49:46] can tell people who he is
[1:49:49] glory to god verse 3 says this and i
[1:49:52] appeared
[1:49:53] unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob
[1:49:57] by the name of god almighty but by my
[1:50:01] name jehovah was i not known
[1:50:04] was i not known to them see so so um
[1:50:08] if i could just kind of break into that
[1:50:10] god needed
[1:50:12] other attributes released out of him
[1:50:14] yeah
[1:50:16] so god had to allow a certain situation
[1:50:20] amen to exist in the earth so that he
[1:50:23] can see
[1:50:24] that attribute express see y'all don't
[1:50:27] know me about jehovah
[1:50:30] you know you know me by god almighty but
[1:50:32] you don't know me by jehovah
[1:50:34] right i want you to know me as jehovah
[1:50:37] gyra
[1:50:39] so in order for you for for you to know
[1:50:41] me as jehovah jireh
[1:50:43] your bills might have to get a little
[1:50:44] tight you're going to be trying to
[1:50:46] figure out how things going to get
[1:50:48] worked out
[1:50:48] but when jehovah jairus steps in
[1:50:52] come on somebody then you know him as
[1:50:54] jehovah
[1:50:58] maybe your body might get a little sick
[1:51:01] but you haven't understood him as
[1:51:03] jehovah rapha
[1:51:05] lord's your healer so he allows that
[1:51:07] sickness to attack your body so he can
[1:51:09] make a way out of nowhere
[1:51:11] and he becomes jehovah rapha
[1:51:15] hallelujah glory to god maybe
[1:51:18] amen you were so wrapped in sin that you
[1:51:20] didn't think you could ever be righteous
[1:51:22] but you realize that he provided his
[1:51:25] righteousness
[1:51:26] for you then you understood him as
[1:51:28] jehovah tits canoe
[1:51:31] come on somebody and if you ever been in
[1:51:34] trouble didn't know how you was gonna
[1:51:36] get out of the fight
[1:51:38] come on somebody he had to surround
[1:51:42] you it may look like i'm surrounded
[1:51:46] but i'm surrounded by you he had to come
[1:51:49] to your rescue so you can get to know
[1:51:52] him as
[1:51:53] jehovah neesee
[1:51:59] maybe some of y'all been having some
[1:52:01] sleepless nights
[1:52:03] didn't know how you was gonna go to bed
[1:52:05] that night
[1:52:06] couldn't get no peace but then you begin
[1:52:09] to understand him when he gave you sleep
[1:52:12] that night
[1:52:12] he became jehovah's summer
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] thank you
[1:52:32] actually i gave him the wrong title he
[1:52:34] was jehovah shalom
[1:52:36] when they gave you peace he gave he was
[1:52:38] jehovah shalom
[1:52:40] but when you ever felt alone
[1:52:44] felt lonely you needed a presence
[1:52:48] you got the presence jehovah shaman amen
[1:52:58] god he had to prove himself as jehovah
[1:53:03] he had to have a situation there so he
[1:53:05] could a man demonstrate these
[1:53:07] attributes and he's doing the same thing
[1:53:10] in your situation let me read this quote
[1:53:12] out of the message adoption
[1:53:13] amen glory glory glory glory hallelujah
[1:53:17] this message out of the uh
[1:53:18] uh this this quote says but in genesis 2
[1:53:23] when he made man he said i am
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:27] y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h
[1:53:28] yahuwah jehovah what did it mean
[1:53:33] he says i am the all-existent
[1:53:36] one who has created something off of
[1:53:39] myself
[1:53:40] i ain't i'm not junk i'm telling you
[1:53:42] that right now i was created
[1:53:44] all for gods
[1:53:52] i know who my father is right
[1:53:55] it says i am the all-existent one who
[1:53:57] has created something
[1:53:58] off of myself to be a son of mine
[1:54:02] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[1:54:05] of mine
[1:54:06] you mean i can be a temporary on this
[1:54:09] earth i can be a temporary one
[1:54:11] well i am going to be a temporary glory
[1:54:14] to god he said he says uh
[1:54:16] a temporary or amateur little one of
[1:54:18] mine oh glory why
[1:54:20] he gave man jehovah means that he gave
[1:54:23] man to be an amateur god
[1:54:26] that's what jehovah means we need to
[1:54:28] know him as
[1:54:30] jehovah he gave man to be an image of
[1:54:34] god because
[1:54:35] he is father god and he made man an
[1:54:38] amateur god
[1:54:39] so he isn't self existence anymore he
[1:54:42] exists
[1:54:43] with his family
[1:54:47] the jesus in me loves the jesus in you
[1:54:51] it's so easy
[1:54:55] easy to love amen says he made man in
[1:54:58] him to god so he
[1:55:00] uh he isn't self-existent anymore he
[1:55:02] exists with his
[1:55:03] his family amen eli eli elohim now he is
[1:55:06] jehovah
[1:55:07] jehovah meaning the one who exists
[1:55:11] with his family now god made man to
[1:55:16] predominate over all the earth
[1:55:22] god made man to dominate
[1:55:27] pre-dominated waldos he had dominion and
[1:55:29] the earth was
[1:55:30] man's dominion is that scripture then if
[1:55:33] that's his domain
[1:55:34] he was god over the earth
[1:55:38] he could speak and it would be so he
[1:55:40] could speak this and it would be so
[1:55:42] there he is god jehovah the one who once
[1:55:45] existed
[1:55:46] in self-existence but now exists with
[1:55:48] his family and his little ones with him
[1:55:50] there you are
[1:55:53] he wants to be known as jehovah
[1:55:56] but not just a man in those seven
[1:55:59] compound titles that i gave you
[1:56:01] he wants to be in you expressed
[1:56:04] as jehovah
[1:56:07] sometimes situations will present
[1:56:09] themselves and and god wants you to take
[1:56:11] control of it
[1:56:14] realize when you know you know the the
[1:56:17] the the prophet told us that when the
[1:56:18] weakest
[1:56:19] christian right hits their knees
[1:56:23] all hell began to shake so sometimes
[1:56:26] news be coming at you and just be
[1:56:27] rattling
[1:56:28] what the devil trying to get you to do
[1:56:30] is not hit your knees
[1:56:33] but if you would just hit your knees
[1:56:36] that that don't mean if you call this
[1:56:37] person
[1:56:38] and i don't mind you can call me but i

[1:56:43] authority that i have
[1:56:45] you can drive a devil out with one
[1:56:48] simple prayer

[1:56:53] from your heart
[1:56:54] the only thing i'll tell you whatever
[1:56:56] you ask just ask it in his name

[1:58:04] they get in trouble they ain't got no
[1:58:05] problem using the name
[1:58:08] but when they try to impress people they
[1:58:10] don't want to use the name of jesus
[1:58:13] no in the name of the lord jesus christ

[2:01:32] we're going to overtime glory
[2:01:35] [Applause]
[2:01:38] i mean at a football game of basketball
[2:01:40] high five and over time
[2:01:50] um we read exodus 5 1-2 exodus 7 1-2 i
[2:01:54] want to read that really quick
[2:01:56] it wasn't moses it wasn't him that was
[2:01:59] doing this jehovah that was in moses
[2:02:01] that did these things and that same
[2:02:03] jehovah wants to live in you
[2:02:05] to manifest himself in this hour in
[2:02:07] exodus 7 verse 1
[2:02:09] it says um this and the lord said unto
[2:02:12] moses see i have made thee a god to
[2:02:14] pharaoh
[2:02:16] and aaron thy brother shall be thy
[2:02:18] prophet
[2:02:19] verse 2
[2:02:23] he says thou shalt speak all that i
[2:02:26] command thee so this was not
[2:02:28] moses speakingness when
[2:02:31] when a fly came it was god telling moses
[2:02:34] call for flies it wasn't like moses
[2:02:37] calling for life is god
[2:02:38] telling moses what to do god inspired
[2:02:42] moses
[2:02:43] but he still made moses the the he says
[2:02:45] i'ma make you a
[2:02:46] god to pharaoh and i'm gonna make your
[2:02:50] brother your prophet
[2:02:52] that's powerful since then shalt uh then
[2:02:55] then shall
[2:02:56] thou shalt speak all that i command thee
[2:02:58] and aaron thy brother shall speak unto
[2:03:00] pharaoh
[2:03:00] that he send the children of israel out
[2:03:02] of his land and i'm just i'm gonna just
[2:03:03] drop something here real quick
[2:03:05] when moses got to leave in egypt
[2:03:08] right and they were they were on the way
[2:03:10] out and pharaoh's army had been
[2:03:12] you know i mean decimated pretty much by
[2:03:14] everything that was happening but
[2:03:15] yet there was enough to still try to
[2:03:17] fight the children of israel so here
[2:03:18] they come
[2:03:18] chasing him and caught him at the red
[2:03:20] sea right now when moses got to the red
[2:03:22] sea
[2:03:23] god had already been telling moses say
[2:03:25] this say that say this say that
[2:03:27] and what it was it was a training
[2:03:29] process
[2:03:30] oh y'all ain't with me yet when moses
[2:03:33] when god was telling him say this said
[2:03:35] that that was a training process
[2:03:37] he needed to know that god was already
[2:03:39] in him and that whatever he spoke
[2:03:42] was gonna come to pass so by the time he
[2:03:45] got to the red sea
[2:03:46] god didn't tell him this come on
[2:03:49] somebody
[2:03:50] but he said the egyptians that you've
[2:03:53] seen today
[2:03:54] you will see them no more forever god
[2:03:57] didn't tell moses to say that but
[2:03:59] because he
[2:04:00] said it god had to back it up
[2:04:05] there might be some things you will
[2:04:06] speak on the inspiration
[2:04:08] but because you said it god gonna have
[2:04:11] to back it up
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:17] glory to god moses called for frogs
[2:04:22] lice flies locusts that was all the
[2:04:25] spoken word of god
[2:04:27] moses knew him as jehovah
[2:04:30] moses demonstrated the power to bind and
[2:04:33] loose
[2:04:35] moses did all these things uh i'm just
[2:04:38] gonna have to skip some of my notes here
[2:04:40] but uh but the one thing that we do know
[2:04:43] amen that according to
[2:04:45] exodus nine and five and six let's pull
[2:04:48] that up nine
[2:04:49] five and six it was still one moses even
[2:04:52] though moses might have uh
[2:04:54] said the egyptians that you've seen
[2:04:55] today yes he said it but it wasn't moses
[2:04:57] doing it
[2:04:58] omnipotence was in moses doing all this
[2:05:02] how do we know that exodus nine five and
[2:05:04] six look at this
[2:05:06] it says uh and the lord appointed a set
[2:05:10] time so god's saying i mean this thing
[2:05:13] gonna be over god got a set
[2:05:15] time right the lord upon a set time
[2:05:18] saying tomorrow
[2:05:19] the lord shall do this thing in the land
[2:05:23] and look at this the next verse it says
[2:05:25] and the lord
[2:05:26] did that thing on the morrow
[2:05:31] i'm telling you the lord god do that
[2:05:33] thing all over again
[2:05:35] hallelujah all the cattle of egypt died
[2:05:38] but of the cattle the children
[2:05:39] of israel died not one
[2:05:43] church i'm expecting for the lord to do
[2:05:45] that thing all over again
[2:05:47] it's not it's it's not us doing this god
[2:05:49] doing it in us
[2:05:51] all right all right all right let me
[2:05:54] just read this last quote
[2:05:56] out of the papa's vision
[2:06:00] these are things that happened at the
[2:06:01] second junction
[2:06:03] a turn glory to god took place in
[2:06:06] amen and one of the big things that
[2:06:08] happened there in the days of moses
[2:06:09] which i don't have time to go into but
[2:06:11] the biggest one of the big things that
[2:06:12] they had to apply the blood of the lamb
[2:06:15] on the door yeah the token had to be
[2:06:17] applied and today it represents
[2:06:19] being filled with the baptism of the
[2:06:21] holy ghost now the
[2:06:22] uh brother jason watkins made the
[2:06:24] statement this morning and i was blessed
[2:06:26] by
[2:06:26] say the baptist holy ghost don't just
[2:06:28] come just for you to have a good
[2:06:30] feeling uh just for you to speak in
[2:06:32] tongues or
[2:06:33] you know just for you to interpret you
[2:06:35] know that's that's not the those are
[2:06:37] secondary reasons
[2:06:39] but the primary reason that the holy
[2:06:41] ghost comes
[2:06:42] is so that you can walk in all truth
[2:06:47] that's the primary reason the holy ghost
[2:06:49] came
[2:06:50] because when he the holy ghost comes he
[2:06:53] will lead you
[2:06:54] and guide you to truth all
[2:06:58] truth that's the primary purpose of
[2:07:02] having the holy ghost so you can walk in
[2:07:04] truth for your day
[2:07:06] not just a hiccup messiah a honda
[2:07:09] prelude
[2:07:10] no that ain't it that's good
[2:07:14] but that ain't it all right
[2:07:20] um patma's vision i want to just read
[2:07:22] this
[2:07:24] amen cut every obstacle from human
[2:07:25] beings
[2:07:27] that they might be connected like in the
[2:07:28] garden of eden
[2:07:30] i mean i was gonna choke it but i'm
[2:07:32] gonna say it
[2:07:33] and i'm so glad the prophet decided to
[2:07:36] say
[2:07:36] it man is omnipotent
[2:07:43] why because you cut from the same cloth
[2:07:46] man
[2:07:46] is omnipotent that means all powerful
[2:07:50] right man is man is omnipotent you don't
[2:07:53] believe that
[2:07:54] but he is a man fully
[2:07:57] surrendered to god is omnipotent
[2:08:01] amen hallelujah then he said in mark 11
[2:08:04] 22
[2:08:05] whatsoever things you say and don't
[2:08:08] doubt in your heart
[2:08:09] it'll come to pass you can have what you
[2:08:12] said
[2:08:14] now can i just inject a little something
[2:08:16] notice what the quotes say
[2:08:18] you it doesn't say what you can have
[2:08:19] what you say
[2:08:21] the quote actually said you can have
[2:08:23] what you that mean you don't already
[2:08:25] spoke some things
[2:08:27] amen hallelujah and you can have what
[2:08:29] you already done spoke
[2:08:31] amen you can have what you said
[2:08:35] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[2:08:38] when god and man comes together through
[2:08:40] omnipotence
[2:08:41] something's got to shake whatsoever you
[2:08:44] say
[2:08:44] with that creative power of omnipotence
[2:08:46] of god knowing that he's promised it and
[2:08:48] he said it in his word it creates a
[2:08:50] power
[2:08:50] that goes out young and brings things to
[2:08:52] pass things that is not
[2:08:54] it makes them as though they are because
[2:08:57] two omnipotents have met
[2:08:59] there he stands oh isn't he
[2:09:02] wonderful i say yes he is wonderful
[2:09:07] wonderful wonderful jesus is to me amen
[2:09:12] now bringing it to a close but i wanted
[2:09:15] to
[2:09:16] just share something here
[2:09:22] in acts 2 peter's referring back to
[2:09:24] joelle 2.
[2:09:26] brother ramsey notice how it's put in
[2:09:28] the second chapter of acts and in the
[2:09:29] second chapter
[2:09:30] of joel god just you know
[2:09:34] confirming some things but in acts 2 it
[2:09:36] says um
[2:09:40] we read verse 17 i believe it shall come
[2:09:43] to pass
[2:09:45] the last day saith god i will pour out
[2:09:48] of my spirit
[2:09:49] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[2:09:51] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[2:09:52] men shall see visions and your old men
[2:09:54] shall dream dreams
[2:09:56] and i was when i when i i was trying to
[2:09:59] not figure it out but you know i was i
[2:10:02] was trying to
[2:10:03] understand the prophet when he took this
[2:10:06] scripture
[2:10:07] to preach on junctions yeah
[2:10:11] it just i'm like wow where you get
[2:10:14] junctions
[2:10:15] out of that but that's the scripture
[2:10:17] that the lord gave him to preach
[2:10:19] on these seven junctions so i'm using
[2:10:22] this scripture it's gonna be our
[2:10:23] foundation because that's what the
[2:10:24] prophet used
[2:10:25] and there was a purpose that he would
[2:10:27] use that
[2:10:29] it's not nothing don't happen by
[2:10:30] accident about chance
[2:10:32] hallelujah see he talked about the
[2:10:34] omnipotence he talked about the
[2:10:35] miraculous
[2:10:36] talk about the spirit of he talked about
[2:10:38] all this and we see this as a promise
[2:10:40] for this day right it says so and it
[2:10:43] should come to pass in the last day said
[2:10:44] god i will pour out of my spirit upon
[2:10:46] flesh and your sons and your daughters
[2:10:47] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[2:10:49] see visions
[2:10:49] and your old men shall dream dreams and
[2:10:52] all my servants and all my handmaids
[2:10:54] i will pour out in those days of my
[2:10:56] spirit and they shall
[2:10:57] prophesy glory to god
[2:11:01] so um at the beginning of the year the
[2:11:03] lord just kind of put in
[2:11:04] my my spirit to uh for us to just talk
[2:11:08] on the subject of dreams
[2:11:10] and i took the first two wednesdays and
[2:11:12] actually this was a sermon that i had
[2:11:14] from last year but i was in a i was
[2:11:17] can i put it this way i was in a vision
[2:11:20] i stepped into a vision and i just kept
[2:11:23] preaching about stepping to the vision
[2:11:25] and
[2:11:25] i i i was in a series of sermons
[2:11:28] and i just wanted to stay there but god
[2:11:30] had given me this on dreams and i'm like
[2:11:32] i know i need to share this with the
[2:11:33] church i'm just kind of waiting on the
[2:11:34] right time
[2:11:35] and you know a lot of things was
[2:11:36] happening at that time i was getting
[2:11:38] dreams from everywhere
[2:11:39] you know but i'm like i i'ma share with
[2:11:41] the church
[2:11:42] and one time i shared it with a
[2:11:44] particular person say look they're
[2:11:45] sharing a dream with me saying now do it
[2:11:47] this way for me
[2:11:48] i want to hear the dream but i got a
[2:11:50] certain way that i'm kind of doing
[2:11:51] things the lord has led me to do things
[2:11:53] say you know we got we got people with
[2:11:55] the gift of discernment
[2:11:57] that's gonna look over that dream and
[2:11:59] pray over that dream and then i'm gonna
[2:12:01] talk it over with them and we're gonna
[2:12:02] see what the lord say
[2:12:04] i said just just just do it that way for
[2:12:06] me but please
[2:12:07] you know i don't mind listening but you
[2:12:09] gotta understand as a pastor there's a
[2:12:11] lot of things going through this head
[2:12:14] a lot going through and and i know your
[2:12:16] dream important i know it is
[2:12:18] i can't comprehend it all right you know
[2:12:21] how much information just flying through
[2:12:24] every day you get a text just coming
[2:12:26] through a prayer request
[2:12:27] and not only just the prayer because of
[2:12:28] church people send you prayer requests
[2:12:30] from all over the world
[2:12:32] your phone never stop pray for this pray
[2:12:35] for that okay
[2:12:36] okay okay okay we'll stop and pray right
[2:12:38] now amen
[2:12:39] i got the prayer the prayer request i
[2:12:41] just father touch kennedy in the name of
[2:12:43] jesus that's all i can say
[2:12:44] that's always needed
[2:12:53] but uh but but you know things just come
[2:12:55] like that so we have to set up a certain
[2:12:57] order we had a junction right so
[2:13:00] we're you know and and at a junction you
[2:13:03] know the
[2:13:04] the the the stop sign is put there so
[2:13:07] that people don't run into each other
[2:13:09] right the stop light is to control the
[2:13:11] traffic
[2:13:12] at the junction
[2:13:18] and you have to have brother zion came
[2:13:21] and told us that we needed these three
[2:13:23] things
[2:13:24] right he said he said you needed the
[2:13:26] joyous where you just do whatever you
[2:13:27] want to do
[2:13:28] right you say but then you go to ethical
[2:13:30] stage he said that's when structure
[2:13:33] rules and regulations come in he's
[2:13:35] saying when you get through that
[2:13:37] now you can go to the next level he said
[2:13:39] which is spiritual
[2:13:41] and he said when you get to the
[2:13:42] spiritual level now you can take a leap
[2:13:43] of faith
[2:13:46] but someone's taking a leap of faith
[2:13:48] without going through structure
[2:13:52] you preach it so i you know i say this
[2:13:55] is just the way we want to do it now i
[2:13:57] weighed it to the lord just kind of gave
[2:13:58] me all the things and
[2:14:00] i heard brother troy use a quote i said
[2:14:02] okay that's a quote that i want to use
[2:14:03] and
[2:14:04] and it was out of church order and maybe

[2:17:47] okay we can see god in this so i'm
[2:17:49] taking the church and i'm putting you
[2:17:50] right now
[2:17:51] back in acts 2 verse 15 through 21.
[2:17:56] and it shall come to pass in the last
[2:17:59] days says god i will pour out of my
[2:18:01] spirit upon all flesh of your sons

[2:18:12] spirit
[2:18:12] and they shall prophesy so i'm taking us
[2:18:16] back and i'm placing the church
[2:18:17] at the junction inside the scripture
[2:18:23] first tree now i'll tell you this
[2:18:26] also the way that these dreams came
[2:18:31] the way that i'm reading to you are not
[2:18:32] the exact way that they came
[2:18:34] but the holy spirit through discernment
[2:18:38] had me put it in this order okay
[2:18:42] i had a dream early this week in it
[2:18:46] we seem to be at another church
[2:18:50] you and i were getting ready to go into
[2:18:52] the church and you were telling me
[2:18:54] that they wanted me to sing and they
[2:18:56] wanted three songs for me
[2:18:59] i was flustered because it was
[2:19:00] unexpected and now this dream
[2:19:03] is just that simple right and uh and i
[2:19:06] told y'all
[2:19:07] that every dreamer god deals with
[2:19:09] dreamers
[2:19:10] differently just like he does with uh
[2:19:11] ministers differently
[2:19:13] praise god he deals with singers
[2:19:15] differently everybody can't sing the
[2:19:16] same song
[2:19:18] your voice made for something else y'all
[2:19:21] stay with me
[2:19:21] right so so so it just said that i was
[2:19:24] uh um
[2:19:25] uh when this came back to the sister
[2:19:27] that shared this with me i made a
[2:19:29] comment that i was gonna be going to um
[2:19:31] uh brother paul's church i think next uh
[2:19:34] not next month but in
[2:19:35] march and i was gonna be i was actually
[2:19:36] saying three songs when i made that
[2:19:38] announcement
[2:19:39] the dream came back to the system so she
[2:19:41] shared it with me and uh
[2:19:42] now i it was three songs in the dream
[2:19:46] and she was flustered because it was
[2:19:48] unexpected amen
[2:19:49] now the rest of these dreams were also
[2:19:52] unexpected
[2:19:53] but i told you three songs but i told
[2:19:56] you three different people
[2:19:58] gave five dreams unexpected
[2:20:01] all right y'all stay with me the next
[2:20:04] dream
[2:20:06] brother had a dream and stated that
[2:20:08] there were about 15 saints from the
[2:20:09] church assembled but not at our specific
[2:20:11] church
[2:20:12] now wait a minute i keep hearing this
[2:20:14] not at our specific church in these
[2:20:16] dreams
[2:20:18] there's some gear and change of
[2:20:19] destruction
[2:20:23] as the saints were fellowshipping he
[2:20:26] noticed
[2:20:27] one of the sisters would stand in line
[2:20:30] and she had a bump
[2:20:32] you know that mean this sister was
[2:20:34] pregnant now when you see a woman in a
[2:20:36] dream
[2:20:37] you have to think church but also
[2:20:40] sometimes you see a woman in a dream
[2:20:42] it's for that specific person you don't
[2:20:45] know what they're going through
[2:20:47] so the dream said i saw the sister with
[2:20:50] a bump
[2:20:51] amen and uh and she was expecting so
[2:20:54] you know we look at these things both
[2:20:56] naturally and spiritually i believe it's
[2:20:58] for that sister
[2:20:59] now you don't need to know who the
[2:21:00] sister is
[2:21:03] just know that before it happens the
[2:21:05] dream was shared
[2:21:07] amen praise the lord amen and i believe
[2:21:10] also that the church is expecting
[2:21:14] amen we believe that the church is also
[2:21:17] expecting great things will come forth
[2:21:19] in this season all right third uh the
[2:21:22] the uh the third dream
[2:21:32] says i had a dream and then this dream
[2:21:34] we were in church
[2:21:36] didn't seem like it was our present
[2:21:38] building
[2:21:40] we were in worship and i looked at a
[2:21:42] distance from me
[2:21:43] and noticed that my daughter had come in
[2:21:46] and was getting settled in her seat
[2:21:48] now this meant something because a
[2:21:50] daughter
[2:21:52] don't necessarily come to church so this
[2:21:54] is a dream of restoration
[2:21:56] let's go on hallelujah says i noticed
[2:21:59] that my daughter had come in
[2:22:00] and was getting settled now notice it
[2:22:03] was unexpected
[2:22:05] for that daughter to be coming in to sit
[2:22:07] in that seat it was unexpected but yet
[2:22:09] it was being manifested
[2:22:11] hallelujah glory i'm going to just share
[2:22:14] some other things
[2:22:15] god gonna do some unexpected things
[2:22:20] in this season things that you have
[2:22:23] already been praying for
[2:22:25] god getting ready to do some unexpected
[2:22:27] things
[2:22:28] right it says uh uh i looked at looked
[2:22:31] the distance from
[2:22:32] from me and noticed that my daughter had
[2:22:34] come in and was getting settled in her
[2:22:35] seat
[2:22:36] my heart was overjoyed but i didn't go
[2:22:38] over to her
[2:22:40] as we continued in worship i turned
[2:22:42] around to find
[2:22:43] that she had moved to the seat right
[2:22:46] behind me
[2:22:47] and embraced me tightly
[2:22:50] she had not come with a husband but had
[2:22:53] driven
[2:22:53] by herself after attending her church
[2:22:56] and leaving disappointed
[2:22:58] after the service i followed her home
[2:23:00] and stayed there talked with her
[2:23:02] don't know where her home was but this
[2:23:05] was different home
[2:23:10] all right we're expecting restoration
[2:23:14] and we're also expecting a different
[2:23:16] home
[2:23:23] since i dream i left home and somehow
[2:23:25] ended up in africa
[2:23:28] no one knew i was going i wanted to get
[2:23:31] back home i
[2:23:32] i went to a brother and sister's house
[2:23:34] to figure out
[2:23:35] how i could get back home it says uh and
[2:23:38] once i realized i could not get home
[2:23:41] i text back to say i won't be in church
[2:23:44] i then
[2:23:44] met a sister whom i know but i don't
[2:23:47] remember who she was
[2:23:48] she said she was going to church so i
[2:23:50] decided to go with her
[2:23:52] when we got there she went in and i
[2:23:55] noticed it was like a convention
[2:23:56] i walked in and saw brother jack and we
[2:23:59] spoke
[2:24:01] i did not know he was there servants was
[2:24:03] about to start
[2:24:04] and the choir was getting ready to sing
[2:24:06] assisting the cry again to praise god
[2:24:08] and everyone
[2:24:09] in the convention started to worship i
[2:24:12] was
[2:24:12] at a table getting ready to eat a piece
[2:24:14] of bread and then brother wesco walked
[2:24:17] over
[2:24:17] to me and looked at me with surprise i
[2:24:20] said you didn't know i was here huh
[2:24:22] he said no with surprise i asked him he
[2:24:24] wanted a piece of bread and he said yes
[2:24:26] i cut the bread and held up the pieces
[2:24:28] for him to choose which one he
[2:24:30] wanted he chose his piece and began to
[2:24:34] walk off
[2:24:35] and as he as he did he stumbled and
[2:24:38] stumbled a little and disappeared into a
[2:24:39] room
[2:24:40] i was worried about him so i began to
[2:24:42] look into the different rules for him
[2:24:44] when i found him he was sitting at a
[2:24:46] desk preparing to speak
[2:24:47] i asked him are you okay he said yes i
[2:24:49] said are you really okay
[2:24:51] he said yes but it comes and goes but
[2:24:53] i'll be okay
[2:24:54] and i woke up after that
[2:24:58] hallelujah now uh
[2:25:01] as i'm speaking these uh different
[2:25:04] dreams and i know
[2:25:05] some of some of us like you know what
[2:25:07] this mean that to me this mean that me
[2:25:09] that's fine i'm not here to debate any
[2:25:12] of that right
[2:25:12] i believe god is using this to speak to
[2:25:15] us
[2:25:16] hallelujah and i'm not going some of
[2:25:18] this i'm not going to put an
[2:25:19] interpretation on
[2:25:20] i'm just sharing with you the dream i
[2:25:24] know something spiritual to it
[2:25:26] but i'm just sharing with you the dream
[2:25:29] and this last one was his brother and
[2:25:32] his family were in a car
[2:25:33] riding with someone else driving you
[2:25:36] notice the black cloud ahead and
[2:25:37] realized had the driver made
[2:25:39] the turn the black cloud would have been
[2:25:42] right over the top of he and his family
[2:25:45] he says he stayed he stated that the
[2:25:47] driver rather than making a turn see i
[2:25:49] say sometimes you got to know whether to
[2:25:50] make a turn or whether to go forward
[2:25:53] when you get at a roundabout you got to
[2:25:54] know which which decision to make he
[2:25:56] said the driver
[2:25:57] you know rather than make the turn he
[2:25:59] went forward and by going
[2:26:01] forward this allowed him to steer clear
[2:26:04] of the storm sometimes
[2:26:07] we get to a situation we want to turn
[2:26:09] around
[2:26:10] go forward praise the lord amen
[2:26:14] now god has sent this and and this is
[2:26:16] where i just want to drop this because
[2:26:18] as i was just sharing this with you know
[2:26:20] a few
[2:26:21] that i feel like the lord has given us
[2:26:22] to to to help us with these things
[2:26:24] uh we were just kind of discussing and
[2:26:26] one of the things that came up
[2:26:28] is that uh we had tongues and
[2:26:31] interpretation
[2:26:32] in the church recently in the church now
[2:26:35] we just had
[2:26:36] three different people share a total of
[2:26:38] five dreams
[2:26:40] this confirms that god is moving in our
[2:26:42] midst
[2:26:43] amen and and what i want to ask of the
[2:26:46] church
[2:26:47] remain spiritual remain
[2:26:50] sensitive to the spirit
[2:26:54] don't allow the enemy just to kind of
[2:26:55] come in and cause all kinds of things we
[2:26:57] got to be watched with this because
[2:26:58] he wants to he wants to get in there and
[2:27:00] mess up something and and and i'm
[2:27:02] i'm i'm saying follow the instruction
[2:27:06] that we gave when it comes to sharing
[2:27:08] this please don't
[2:27:09] leave the church go out to the parking
[2:27:12] lot
[2:27:13] you know the lord gave me
[2:27:17] don't do that we trying to keep order
[2:27:20] we welcome the gifts that's why i read
[2:27:23] them because i want to let you know
[2:27:24] we welcome it and i believe at this time
[2:27:27] with three coming from
[2:27:28] i mean uh three different people having
[2:27:30] five different dreams i believe god's
[2:27:31] speaking to us through i believe it has
[2:27:33] both a
[2:27:34] natural and a spiritual meaning some of
[2:27:37] the natural things like you know
[2:27:38] and in this last one you know you got to
[2:27:41] be careful what decisions you make as a
[2:27:44] church we got to be careful what
[2:27:45] decisions we make
[2:27:46] if we make the wrong turn it could be
[2:27:48] destruction a black cloud represents
[2:27:50] death
[2:27:51] and it could be spiritual death not
[2:27:53] natural death but the wrong turn can
[2:27:55] cause spiritual death in somebody's life
[2:27:58] hallelujah so god could be saying just
[2:28:00] just keep going straight
[2:28:06] the lord is i was telling somebody you
[2:28:08] know and you know there's a lot that
[2:28:10] that we can we can look at but uh i'm
[2:28:13] gonna just put it like this
[2:28:15] i i'm not focused
[2:28:18] and i can't be focused on anything else
[2:28:22] but spirit and truth tabernacle
[2:28:24] that's where my attention is but i know
[2:28:26] god is doing other things and we're just
[2:28:28] watching god but you can
[2:28:30] i can i said this earlier all of us here
[2:28:33] at spirit and truth we came
[2:28:35] here because we hit a junction
[2:28:38] i hit a junction i i'm just talking
[2:28:40] about myself i hit a junction
[2:28:42] and when uh on wednesday i mean on
[2:28:44] friday night when we come to the
[2:28:45] business meeting
[2:28:46] i'll share more with you you know on
[2:28:48] that you know how did this church get
[2:28:50] started
[2:28:51] how did this get started right what
[2:28:53] happened here
[2:28:55] you need to know the story the history
[2:28:57] of your own church
[2:28:58] but the reason i'm here is because i hit
[2:29:00] a junction there was a there was a
[2:29:02] a turn that i had to make in my life and
[2:29:04] i can look back now and say god has
[2:29:06] blessed
[2:29:07] and vindicated the term
[2:29:10] you all have the same experiences
[2:29:14] same you come to the same conclusions
[2:29:17] and i can tell you god has already
[2:29:18] blessed and vindicated your terms
[2:29:21] they're going to do more church this is
[2:29:24] a critical hour
[2:29:25] it's a serious hour it's a lot to be
[2:29:28] expecting
[2:29:29] expect the unexpected
[2:29:33] say that again expect the unexpected i
[2:29:35] believe family's going to be restored
[2:29:39] i i believe that
[2:29:41] [Applause]
[2:29:46] don't be surprised you're sitting here
[2:29:48] in somebody i ain't even know you
[2:29:50] expect the unexpected
[2:29:53] somebody getting tired of watching
[2:29:54] online
[2:29:56] and you know and people do watch you'll
[2:29:57] be surprised that he'll be watching us
[2:29:59] like how you know about the service they
[2:30:02] know everything can tell you what
[2:30:04] happened
[2:30:06] i didn't think you believe this no more
[2:30:08] it's because you can't get away from it
[2:30:11] right i mean you think if somebody don't
[2:30:13] believe it they would just cut
[2:30:14] ties at least that's the way i would be
[2:30:18] i'm cutting ties with it but no people
[2:30:19] still connected
[2:30:21] why because they was never disconnected
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:26] amen amen church be on the expectation
[2:30:31] god bless you amen
[2:30:33] [Applause]
[2:30:38] praise the lord let's just have a word
[2:30:40] of prayer
[2:30:44] lord jesus we are
[2:30:48] mindful of your very presence your
[2:30:52] anointing
[2:30:53] that is in this room to destroy the yoke
[2:30:55] of the enemy
[2:30:58] mindful that you are in our midst that
[2:31:00] you are moving
[2:31:05] lord just a few months ago you let us
[2:31:06] experience a very
[2:31:09] powerful service here and
[2:31:13] brother quaker just brought it back to
[2:31:14] our attention on last week lord and
[2:31:18] helped us to see lord just how just even
[2:31:20] the people that you chose to speak
[2:31:22] through
[2:31:24] god had significance
[2:31:29] and father um as you've led us to just
[2:31:31] kind of talk on the subject of dreams
[2:31:33] and
[2:31:33] god immediately after that i mean the
[2:31:35] very night that i ended it
[2:31:37] start getting text messages and end up
[2:31:39] getting five
[2:31:41] different dreams from three different
[2:31:43] people
[2:31:46] god you're just confirming your presence
[2:31:47] the the the supernatural is here the
[2:31:50] miraculous is here
[2:31:51] we're not here just trying to put
[2:31:52] interpretations on everything i think we
[2:31:54] can read between the lines and see what
[2:31:55] the spirit is trying to tell us some of
[2:31:57] it
[2:31:58] very direct some is very direct
[2:32:02] but some of it oh god we have to catch
[2:32:04] the spirit spiritual component
[2:32:06] help us lord to to really be mindful and
[2:32:09] just
[2:32:10] also god just to remain humble
[2:32:13] we don't want to raise ourselves up to
[2:32:15] to be anything more than what we are but
[2:32:18] as i shared these dreams with the people
[2:32:20] i was reminded how the prophet stepped
[2:32:22] out and preached the message
[2:32:24] is this the end uh is this
[2:32:27] service is this the end the services
[2:32:29] it's a time uh
[2:32:30] signs at the end he took six dreams and
[2:32:33] a vision
[2:32:34] and he preached a sermon just to try to
[2:32:36] show the people where we
[2:32:38] were and god right before uh
[2:32:41] before the mighty amen explosion out
[2:32:44] there in arizona and the angels sending
[2:32:46] the prophet back to preach the seals
[2:32:48] god he shared these dreams and he shared
[2:32:51] the vision
[2:32:52] and god lord maybe before you do
[2:32:54] something great you just want us to
[2:32:56] share with the people that god you're
[2:32:58] here
[2:32:59] we're going to see miracles we're going
[2:33:02] to see lord things that we never thought
[2:33:04] could happen
[2:33:05] this is the we're on the expectation for
[2:33:07] these great
[2:33:08] great times and lord i just believe oh
