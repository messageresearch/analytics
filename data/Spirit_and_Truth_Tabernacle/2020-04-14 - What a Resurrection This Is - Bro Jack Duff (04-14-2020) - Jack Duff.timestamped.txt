[0:37] praise the Lord to a stand this morning
[0:42] get our Bibles we'll open the service
[0:45] the reading of the word of God I wish
[0:48] everyone a Happy Easter
[0:50] on today so good to be in the house of
[0:55] the Lord
[0:56] man I want to read from the book of Song
[1:00] chapter 22 this particular passage is
[1:06] David prophesying over our Lord and
[1:11] Savior in some of the things that he
[1:13] went through as we were reading through
[1:15] this this morning I want you to just
[1:17] kind of picture in your mind some of the
[1:20] things that the Lord went through during
[1:23] this Easter season as I was just
[1:27] reflecting missed I thought about what
[1:29] we're going through now with this
[1:31] coronavirus it can't even compare to
[1:34] what our Lord and Savior went through
[1:37] when he faced Calvary and the reason
[1:41] that we even stand in the house of God
[1:43] today is because of what he overcame he
[1:46] overcame death hell and the grave and
[1:48] we're so grateful for his tremendous
[1:51] sacrifice so here in Psalms 22 starting
[1:56] at verse 1 says my God my God why hast
[2:00] thou forsaken me why art thou so far
[2:05] from helping me and from the words of my
[2:07] Rory oh my god I cry in the daytime but
[2:11] thou here is not and in the night season
[2:14] and I'm not silent but thou art holy o
[2:18] thou that inhabits the praises of Israel
[2:21] our fathers trusted in thee they trusted
[2:24] and thou didst deliver them they cried
[2:27] unto thee and were delivered they
[2:29] trusted in the end were not confounded
[2:31] but I am a worm and no man a reproach of
[2:35] man and despise are the people all day
[2:39] that seeming laughed me to scorn they
[2:41] shoot out the lip they shake the head
[2:44] saying he trusted from the Lord that he
[2:47] would deliver him let him deliver him
[2:49] seeing
[2:50] he delighted in him and this is exactly
[2:53] what took place at the cross but our key
[2:56] that took me out of the womb now this
[2:59] make me hope when I was a pun my
[3:02] mother's breasts I was cast upon thee
[3:05] from the womb thou art my god from my
[3:08] mother's belly be not far from me for
[3:11] thou the trouble is near for there is
[3:15] none to help many Bulls have compassed
[3:18] me strong Bulls of Bashan have beset me
[3:20] round they gaped upon me with their
[3:24] mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion
[3:27] and poured out like water and all my
[3:30] bones are out of joint heart is like wax
[3:33] it is melted in the midst of my bowels
[3:36] my strength is dried up like a potsherd
[3:39] and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and
[3:44] thou has brought me into the dust of
[3:46] death but dogs have compassed me this
[3:48] simply of the wicked have inclosed me
[3:50] they pierced my hands and my feet I may
[3:55] tell all my bones that they look and
[3:57] stare upon
[3:59] they parked my garments among them and
[4:01] cast lots of on my vesture says but be
[4:07] not far be not thou far from me O Lord o
[4:12] my strength haste thee to help me amen

[4:19] of his word let's just bow in a word of

[25:49] appreciate that we have a birthday
[25:53] coming Saturday sister Zion and then we
[25:58] celebrating the birthday on Saturday we
[26:01] want to wish our sister happy birthday
[26:04] thank God for let me see another year
[26:09] god is good
[26:12] don't forget a man this we just kind of
[26:15] go forward in this season we will
[26:18] continue just a periscope the services
[26:21] on Wednesday night extra Lord we were
[26:27] having some issues they were periscope
[26:29] and sometimes it was going in and out so
[26:32] we decided to actually start also
[26:36] broadcasting the services on YouTube I'm
[26:40] sorry
[26:41] Facebook Facebook we started a church
[26:44] Facebook a page so we can also stream
[26:47] through there and the Lord blessed us
[26:49] with some new equipment on yesterday and
[26:52] and actually have a camera that is live
[26:56] streaming through both sources it goes
[26:58] through Facebook as well as it goes
[27:01] through periscope so we have that in
[27:04] place and we thank for that and just
[27:07] trying to make sure everyone has a
[27:08] wonderful experience so Wednesday nights
[27:10] we'll be doing that we thank God for
[27:11] this past Wednesday brother Troy came
[27:14] and spoke about the secret place of the
[27:16] Most High we had a wonderful wonderful
[27:18] time
[27:19] Magnusson joy joy the word of the Lord
[27:22] for my precious brother and so we'll
[27:25] continue to do Wednesday night streaming
[27:27] amen so just keep that in mind also know
[27:31] no Friday night services until they
[27:33] meant things are lifted and as far as
[27:36] our Sunday services will continue to do
[27:38] 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. and I believe
[27:41] everyone has accepted one or the other
[27:44] services and with dis managing things
[27:46] accordingly what we are trying to do is
[27:50] do our best to stay within the
[27:51] guidelines a man that's been given to us
[27:53] I heard that some churches they
[27:56] completely well know the governor took a
[27:59] ban off it but we still want to be
[28:01] careful in this season so we're trying
[28:04] to just keep it where we can keep
[28:05] everybody six feet apart and one thing I
[28:08] don't want the devil to do is is take a
[28:11] testimony out of Spirit of Truth that
[28:12] something broke out spirit of truth
[28:14] tabernacle that it be that would be a
[28:16] lying devil and so we want to make sure
[28:20] that we're doing everything we can to
[28:21] keep everybody out of harm's way but we
[28:24] still want to worship the Lord the
[28:26] scripture says give Brenda diseases what
[28:28] it seizes but also written unto God what
[28:31] is God's and he deserves our glory he
[28:34] deserves our worship he deserves our
[28:36] praise so just keep those things in mind
[28:39] a man as we go forward continue to pray
[28:42] for each other that God would just
[28:45] continue to protect us and keep us
[28:46] during this time a man
[28:49] you know he is moving in the midst of
[28:51] all this on over the on Friday I had an
[28:54] opportunity to baptize a precious young
[28:57] lady and then in the name of the Lord
[28:59] Jesus Christ and and I was a man
[29:02] praise the Lord I was just so elated to
[29:08] have the opportunity I was telling her
[29:10] this is a perfect day to be baptized
[29:13] because it's the same day that you know
[29:15] we celebrated him going to cross and
[29:18] being buried in a grave and baptism is
[29:20] symbolic of that that experience of
[29:23] going to the grave but raising into the
[29:25] newness of life and you know we just
[29:27] think for her and our children just keep
[29:30] her in prayer the devil fights people
[29:32] after they've been baptized and you know
[29:35] but we know that if they're seized of
[29:37] God and there is nothing that devil can
[29:39] do to stop them from coming forth a man
[29:42] so a keeper in prayer continue to keep a
[29:45] man those that are on the front line in
[29:48] prayer we we have saints that work there
[29:52] in the hospitals and and they are in
[29:55] contact with some some some different
[29:57] various situations and their lives
[30:01] amen are are in danger every time they
[30:04] go out to work but these are people that
[30:08] can't live in a state of fear they have
[30:09] a job to do and they rise up to the
[30:12] responsibility we thank God for that but
[30:14] pray that God will protect them and keep
[30:16] them amen as they're out there on the
[30:18] front lines and now we're just trusting
[30:20] God that you know we will see the little
[30:23] a man that in itself is a miracle that
[30:26] God can keep you amen in the midst of
[30:28] all these sick people amen that's that's
[30:31] that's that's the scripture that no
[30:32] plague will come now my dwelling Amen a
[30:35] thousand may fall at my side and ten
[30:38] thousand at but no plague on come nigh
[30:40] my dwelling Amen cover ourselves in the
[30:43] Word of God amen
[30:45] praise the Lord so we won't necessarily
[30:48] pass the offering bucket
[30:51] Amen but what we will do is when you
[30:53] want to give Amen either as you're
[30:56] coming into service or as you're exiting
[30:58] we have a box there on the table and you
[31:00] can just put it inside a man the box
[31:02] that we have on the table but at this
[31:05] time a man will just have a word of
[31:07] Prayer not access to Tina if she would
[31:08] come and just blessed this Amen but
[31:11] let's just bound a word of Prayer and
[31:13] then father we thank you for how good
[31:16] you have proven to be to us in this
[31:19] season and in this time we thank you for
[31:21] your divine protection and thank you for
[31:24] the miracles that are happening Lord
[31:26] every day thank you for watching over
[31:28] those that are on the front line and God
[31:30] remember our precious sister Liz and
[31:32] sister Tammy this is a time you Lord
[31:36] sufficient era God so many Lord that are
[31:39] on the front line that need you to watch
[31:42] over them we just pray that you continue
[31:44] to do that Lord you've done it thus far
[31:45] we know you'll continue to do it reacts
[31:47] God that you would just continue to meet
[31:49] the needs of the saints that you would
[31:50] bless them in ways that go beyond their
[31:52] expectations that you moving
[31:54] mighty mighty ways show that you are God
[31:58] even in the midst of this tremendous
[32:00] time well we just prayed it bless a man
[32:04] the rest of the servicemen you get all
[32:06] the glory all the honor and all the
[32:07] praise this in Jesus name we pray amen
[32:10] one other thing I needed to make mention
[32:12] of I was told that on tomorrow
[32:15] the governor is requesting that
[32:18] everybody wear mass amen as they are
[32:21] when you go out of public they are
[32:23] requesting that everybody wear mass
[32:26] and and I must say I'm grateful for the
[32:29] governor that gives us this opportunity
[32:30] to be able to do what we are doing but
[32:32] we want to try to follow that so you
[32:34] know please you know if you're going out
[32:37] in public you have to wear a mask that
[32:38] means even when you come in the church
[32:40] you smell the way of mass that's what
[32:41] they're telling us to do so a man and
[32:44] you know we just want to follow a man as
[32:46] they or get guiding us and leading us
[32:48] through this so less less less less
[32:51] render unto Caesar what is Caesar's god
[32:53] bless you god bless you
[33:04] years I spent in vanity and pride caring
[33:13] not my lord was rude see fine

[38:51] before he had a tremendous testimony of
[38:54] going into some country and getting a
[38:58] car that somebody

[39:09] going through but he was in ICU okay
[39:12] so brother Gerald but they're in England
[39:14] he was in ICU recently and the Lord
[39:18] brought him out and he was in church
[39:20] this morning giving his testimony of how
[39:23] God brought him out so we're seeing
[39:25] God's healing power

[39:30] we thank God for watching over our
[39:32] precious brother amen
[39:34] let's read a couple scriptures Matthew
[39:37] 27 and then also Romans 8
[39:41] but Matthew 27 a man and we'll start
[39:48] reading at verse 50
[39:56] says Jesus when he had cried again with
[40:00] a loud voice yielded up the ghost and
[40:06] behold the veil of the temple was rent
[40:08] in twain from the top to the bottom and
[40:11] the earth did quake and the rocks rent
[40:14] and the graves were opened and many
[40:19] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[40:25] praise the Lord
[40:27] and came out of the graves after his
[40:31] resurrection and went into the holy city
[40:34] and appeared unto many a man let's also
[40:38] just read from Romans 8
[40:57] and just one one verse here at Romans
[41:02] eight a man and just only read verse 11
[41:07] if we can but if the spirit of him that
[41:14] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[41:17] you he that raised up Christ from the
[41:21] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[41:25] bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
[41:28] you amen the Lord had a blessing to the
[41:32] reading of his words let's just bow in a
[41:34] brief word of Prayer father we thank you
[41:36] for the ability to read the word God we
[41:41] trust that the Holy Ghost would now come
[41:44] and help us to understand what it is
[41:46] that we have rent this day God make it
[41:50] live for the time of which we are
[41:54] standing and we just take every spirit
[41:58] that's against the Spirit of God
[41:59] underneath the control of the Holy Ghost
[42:01] may you be glorified and magnified and
[42:03] exalted through your word Jesus name we
[42:07] pray amen amen
[42:09] praise the Lord God bless you I want to
[42:13] just use for a title today what a
[42:17] resurrection this is a man what a
[42:21] resurrection this is a man just going
[42:28] back you know we will start with a quote
[42:32] here to go tell my disciples but Easter
[42:36] a man is a very special time of year for
[42:41] Christians a man and however for true
[42:46] Christians Easter is not a one day event
[42:50] or one weekend event Easter is something
[42:54] that occurs every day in the Christians
[42:56] life a man is something that they
[42:58] celebrate every day you know one of the
[43:02] things you know
[43:03] a lot of people in especially here in
[43:06] the US they they're what we call c-e-o
[43:11] Christians a man CEO Christians and what
[43:16] that means is that they go to church at
[43:18] Christmas and Easter only hallelujah a
[43:22] man
[43:23] CEO Christians but we don't want to be
[43:25] that way right and in Christianity we
[43:29] want to we want to celebrate the
[43:31] resurrection every day the story or a
[43:34] man the songs that we sing about the
[43:37] blood of Jesus Christ they never get old
[43:39] a man they never get old they always
[43:41] have meaning when we think about the
[43:43] blood that was shed that allows us to be
[43:45] able to come together to worship a man
[43:48] in spirit and in truth so we thank God
[43:51] for this so let's let's just start a man
[43:53] with a little quote here I to go tell my
[43:55] disciples and then I want to we'll just
[43:57] kind of move forward in this thought
[43:59] what a resurrection this is a man it
[44:02] says then when alone came Jesus they
[44:07] done to him what they said they would
[44:09] when he was born in Bethlehem he came in
[44:12] by the way of a stable door went out
[44:15] through capital punishment hallelujah
[44:19] amen while he was here on earth he never
[44:22] made a 50-mile journey in his life he
[44:25] never went anywhere around Palestine yet
[44:29] the message of his gospel has traveled
[44:33] to every crack and corner of the world
[44:36] he says he never wrote a book in his
[44:38] life yet the book was written of him has
[44:42] outsold every book in all ages the Bible
[44:47] and yet in there he never went to
[44:50] college in his life and yet there's been
[44:52] more colleges erected in his honor than
[44:56] any other thing that has been upon the
[44:58] face of the earth or any other name or
[45:00] any other man and he never went very far
[45:04] he lived a humble low life he was made
[45:07] fun of scarf laughed at now you know we
[45:11] look at this man Jesus that never went a
[45:13] man
[45:14] more than 50 miles from the place that
[45:17] he was born and yet so much as his life
[45:21] has impacted every place in this world
[45:25] when people hear the story of Jesus
[45:27] it does something hallelujah amen I uh
[45:30] you know the the precious young sister
[45:33] that we had a chance to baptize I was
[45:34] just getting her background she said I
[45:36] come from a Hindu background I say well
[45:38] my praise the Lord
[45:39] to see how amen the story of Christ and
[45:42] not just it's not just a story we know
[45:45] that He is risen the way that we know
[45:47] that he is risen
[45:48] it's because he lives inside of us glory
[45:51] to God
[45:52] i'ma get ahead of myself and I'm gonna
[45:54] just say something amen you know his
[45:56] resurrection produce many resurrections
[46:00] Lorre to God amen many resurrections
[46:04] came from one resurrection that I myself
[46:10] have experienced a resurrection amen I
[46:14] was dead in sin and trespasses but
[46:17] because I came in contact with Jesus I
[46:20] have been resurrected glory to God and I
[46:23] can say this morning what a resurrection
[46:27] this is hallelujah amen when you can see
[46:31] yourself in what the Lord Jesus has done
[46:35] for you individually you can say for
[46:38] yourself what a resurrection this is
[46:43] we're not gonna put it past tips we're
[46:46] not putting in two thousand years ago he
[46:49] is still resurrecting today look at this
[46:52] in the message in his the rising of the
[46:54] Sun it says now as the world today in a
[46:59] memorial in a memorial service or at
[47:03] least in the United States and the side
[47:05] of the earth is this morning and the
[47:07] churches of throughout is celebrating a
[47:09] memorial of the greatest triumphs that
[47:12] man ever had glory he says I think I
[47:16] saved you when he died or as an infant
[47:19] when he was born he could not have been
[47:21] here less being coming into the earth
[47:25] and when he died certainly he atoned for
[47:27] our sin but yet there's been many fine
[47:31] little babies born and there's been many
[47:35] man who has suffered and died for real
[47:38] cause but there never was one that could
[47:40] raise his self up again until this thing
[47:44] glory to God
[47:46] this was the Lord Jesus that raised
[47:48] himself up again you say you know you
[47:50] destroy this body and in three days I'll
[47:54] raise it up again you destroy this and
[47:56] in three days I'll do that and there was
[47:59] many people come and made all kind of
[48:01] claims but he didn't just make a claim
[48:03] he manifested what he talked about
[48:06] and that's why Christianity is different
[48:09] from any other religion Amen Jesus is
[48:13] different from any other leader he's the
[48:16] only one that could prophesy and say
[48:19] what was going to happen and being
[48:21] manifesting glory to God amen even our
[48:26] our purpose for going to church on
[48:28] Sunday a menace in its action honor of
[48:31] his resurrection because he resurrected
[48:34] on the day after the Sabbath hallelujah
[48:37] amen it says he resurrected on the day
[48:40] after the Sabbath we celebrate his
[48:42] resurrection every time we come together
[48:44] glory took on amen I wanna I wanna let
[48:50] me just maybe just keep reading on that
[48:54] no no no I want to go to another little
[48:56] quote here this is probably on the end
[48:58] of my um on the end of my notes back
[49:01] there but uh he atoned for our sins I
[49:04] want to go to this message living dying
[49:06] buried arising coming home five seats if
[49:11] that ain't nothing if that ain't enough
[49:12] to be happy about I don't know what its
[49:15] gonna take for us to get happy I'm
[49:18] already got here the tone for everything
[49:20] look at what the Prophet says here he
[49:22] says in this message living dying berry
[49:24] rising coming he says but oh that Easter
[49:28] rising he justified freely forever he's
[49:33] quoting a song glory to God living he
[49:37] loved me
[49:38] dying he saved me buried he carried my
[49:40] sins far away rising he justified freely
[49:44] forever one day he's coming back o
[49:46] glorious day
[49:47] and I'm under expectation for that look
[49:50] he says rise and he justified freely for
[49:53] you have a living he loved me dying he
[49:56] saved me buried he carried my sins far
[49:59] away for the men say that was alright
[50:01] says but rising he justified it was it
[50:06] was enough to start shouting on the
[50:08] living he loved me it was enough to
[50:10] start shouting Oh dying he saved me it
[50:13] was enough to give praise him buried he
[50:15] carried my sins far away the Prophet
[50:19] said all right
[50:22] glory to God he says but rising he
[50:27] justified amen what was that raising up
[50:31] it was God's receipt that the bills been
[50:35] paid rise and he justified freely
[50:39] forever
[50:39] oh what a savior rising what had God
[50:43] done a man can suffer a man can die a
[50:46] man can be buried but Easter was the
[50:49] greatest of them all for it was God's
[50:52] endorsement my law has been met my
[50:55] requirement has a husband has been I've
[50:58] been met by him he rose him up from the
[51:01] dead
[51:01] raising he justified freely forever
[51:04] blessed be his holy name I was I was
[51:08] rejoicing when I read this quote you
[51:11] know I love brother Branham using this
[51:13] type it says what was that raising or
[51:15] that resurrection it was it was showing
[51:18] that it was it was God's receipt that
[51:21] the bills been paid God's receipt that
[51:27] the bill has been paid now you know I
[51:31] just begin to ponder that a little bit
[51:33] in and I begin to think about you know
[51:35] how some of the sisters a man may get a
[51:38] gift for their birthday or some event a
[51:41] man and maybe somebody else buys them a
[51:43] gift maybe Bhama some clothing or
[51:46] something like that
[51:46] but typically a man when the sister
[51:49] receives this she also is given the
[51:53] receipt hallelujah
[51:56] a man of what she just got and the
[51:58] reason that another sister might give it
[52:00] a receipt you say now I thought this
[52:02] might be your size but just in case a
[52:05] man you need to get a different size or
[52:07] a different color or whatever you want
[52:10] to do I'm giving you the receipt blessed
[52:13] be the name of the Lord the sister which
[52:17] he goes back to the store she can go
[52:20] back with a confidence she can put the
[52:23] receipt in her purse and just carry the
[52:26] garment back into the store and when she
[52:28] walks inside the store maybe the first
[52:30] person look at him say now now look we
[52:32] don't take that back we're not taking
[52:34] that back no no no no no no no are you
[52:36] gonna take this back how do I ain't
[52:38] showed you what I got in my purse but
[52:40] you gonna take this back do you have a
[52:42] comfort tip when you're standing there
[52:45] talking to a cart when you can show them
[52:48] your receipt rather when you pull out
[52:52] the receipt sister when you pull out the
[52:54] receipt the argument is over you have
[52:57] proven to them that this garment was
[53:00] purchased here amen so I'm here to get
[53:04] another sighs I'm gonna exchange it for
[53:07] what I like if I want a different color
[53:09] I'm gonna get a different color if I
[53:11] want a different size I'm gonna get a
[53:13] different size whatever I won't I'm
[53:16] gonna get because I have the receipt and
[53:19] I'm here to tell you this morning it's
[53:22] time to take the receipt of the
[53:25] Resurrection suet to the devil tell the
[53:29] devil I'm here to exchange I'm giving
[53:33] you back depression I'm giving you back
[53:36] heartache
[53:37] I'm giving you back pain I'm giving you
[53:41] back sickness
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:44] Elin I'm leaving here with my
[53:46] deliverance I'm leaving here with my
[53:49] Easter glory to God hallelujah amen
[53:57] that's what the resurrection was all
[53:59] about initial paid receipt and when you
[54:03] got a receipt you can stand with
[54:05] confidence glory to God you're gonna get
[54:08] what you went in there for hallelujah
[54:10] hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory
[54:13] amen let's go back here to a little
[54:17] statement that the Prophet makes in I
[54:19] just want to read this scripture
[54:21] revelation 1:18 revelation 1:18 he says
[54:26] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[54:31] behold I am Alive for evermore amen and
[54:35] have the keys of hell and of death
[54:42] if Jesus is the one with the keys the
[54:45] devil can't do nothing unless he has
[54:48] permission hey man you understand that
[54:51] the devil can't do anything unless he
[54:53] has permission even amen
[54:55] he don't have keys his own house glory
[55:04] to God Jesus says I have the keys of
[55:07] hell and of death that's why when we
[55:10] recognize this we don't have to fear
[55:12] anything Jesus is in control even in
[55:15] death Jesus is in control look at this
[55:18] now brother Branham makes a statement
[55:21] here in this message in US the rising of
[55:23] the Sun it says I'm at paragraph 50 a
[55:26] man in this sermon he says now notice
[55:29] now as the gloom cover the earth and the
[55:34] seeds could not live without the SU into
[55:37] rice and gloom and cover the earth and
[55:40] now the S Oh n was risen and all gloom
[55:44] was vanished by this light as it spread
[55:47] across the nations to the people that he
[55:50] is not here but he is risen what a
[55:52] statement says he approved his words he
[55:56] had proved it to
[55:57] he proved it B to be true for he for he
[56:01] had now conquered death hell and the
[56:03] grave but before Jesus came everybody
[56:07] feared Amen death
[56:09] everybody fear the great even Joe back
[56:11] quest like what happens after man dies
[56:13] he says I see that when a flower dies
[56:17] it'll come back up when a tree goes
[56:20] through its winter sees him it'll come
[56:23] back up hallelujah amen he says but what
[56:26] happens to a man when a man dies what
[56:28] happens to him and you know this is why
[56:30] you know I remember you know last year
[56:33] when we preached for Easter
[56:35] I brought a quote with brother Branham
[56:36] said Joe was the first one to see at
[56:39] Easter when Joe was discouraged at a
[56:42] situation of wonder what was going to
[56:44] happen God elevated Joe and John began
[56:47] to look and say I've known my Redeemer
[56:49] liveth a man and I shall see him in the
[56:52] last day he said no the skin works
[56:55] destroy of this flesh yet in this flesh
[56:59] I shall see God and not another window
[57:03] saw that he was looking at Easter for
[57:06] the first time hallelujah hallelujah
[57:08] glory to God it encouraged him when he
[57:11] got a glimpse of Easter it will
[57:13] encourage you when you get a glimpse of
[57:15] Easter amen
[57:17] look at what the Prophet goes on to say
[57:19] here glory glory they made for he had
[57:23] proved it B to be true for yet conquered
[57:26] now he had now come to death hell and
[57:28] the grave I will notice this the Trinity
[57:31] of the devil death hail and grief
[57:36] brother branham called it the Trinity of
[57:39] the devil he said for Satan is the
[57:41] author of death he is the possessor of
[57:44] hail and also the grain and that was the
[57:48] Trinity of Satan because our being
[57:51] caused by one thing that was death then
[57:53] you go at the grave and being a sinner
[57:56] you go to hell so we try to be trying to
[57:59] curb that process we don't want you if
[58:01] you had to die don't die a sinner amen
[58:04] die in Christ glory to God because we
[58:07] have a promise that your bones would be
[58:09] wicked hallelujah at his coming if you
[58:12] die in Christ everybody might have to
[58:15] die someday now I think we're living in
[58:18] a day where what some people are not
[58:19] going to taste death
[58:20] some people gonna actually catch a
[58:22] rapture and I believe we're living in
[58:24] the time we agree we can expect that to
[58:25] happen any day now just as the scripture
[58:29] promised that Jesus was coming the first
[58:31] time and he came the scripture also
[58:34] promises that he's coming again
[58:36] and he will come and I want you to know
[58:39] when he comes it will come at a time of
[58:42] pressure glory to God
[58:45] it'll come at a time when we a man we it
[58:47] might be worse than what it is right now
[58:49] but that's the time we can expect Christ
[58:52] to come
[58:53] hallelujah hallelujah look at this he :
[58:56] says the Trinity of the devil death hell
[59:00] and the grave a man the Satan's off the
[59:03] death he's the possessor of hell and
[59:04] also the grain and that was the Trinity
[59:06] of Satan me cup being caused by one
[59:08] thing that was death death you go ahead
[59:10] at the grave being a sinner you go to
[59:13] hell all the very one thing the Trinity
[59:16] of Satan which was death that had held
[59:19] man in captivity all these years now
[59:22] look at this because he it's just
[59:24] beautiful the way the Prophet brings
[59:25] this and this is why I appreciate a
[59:28] prophet he brings out things that we
[59:31] probably never look at in Scripture he
[59:33] brings out little thoughts that we never
[59:36] even considered now I'm preaching to you
[59:38] what a resurrection this is I didn't
[59:42] make that up I actually got that from
[59:44] the Prophet and I'm going to show you
[59:46] the quote where he says a little bit
[59:48] later but what a resurrection this is
[59:51] when he brought that statement he was
[59:53] trying to get him to see don't keep it
[59:55] 2000 years ago
[59:57] amen but we got to see ourselves right
[1:00:00] now do you realize the reason you hear
[1:00:03] in church the reason that you're sitting
[1:00:08] here in shirt is that you yourself have
[1:00:11] experience right a resurrection
[1:00:16] brother/sister that devil had you going
[1:00:18] places you should not have been going
[1:00:20] that there were had to in places where
[1:00:22] he was trying to kill you he tried to
[1:00:26] stop you from getting to where you are
[1:00:28] right now
[1:00:29] but whether resurrection this years oh
[1:00:34] not a resurrection that was but what a
[1:00:37] resurrection he sees glory tuck ah let
[1:00:43] me go further
[1:00:44] amen and this he says but now the trip
[1:00:47] now the true Trinity of God being one
[1:00:50] manifest in Christ that's Father Son and
[1:00:52] Holy Ghost being one that's the true
[1:00:54] Trinity of God he says but now the true
[1:00:56] treated God being one manifested Christ
[1:00:58] who was like Jesus said I come that you
[1:01:01] might have life and had that more
[1:01:04] abundantly says the true Trinity of God
[1:01:08] being one man one manifest in Christ who
[1:01:11] was life and hat broke the seals and
[1:01:13] conquered the enemy and rose up the one
[1:01:16] through a living God I am he that was
[1:01:19] dead and I'm alive forevermore and had
[1:01:22] the keys of death and Hell God and one
[1:01:25] made man and dwelt among us and
[1:01:28] conquered every enemy and had proved
[1:01:30] that the Trinity of Satan was conquered
[1:01:32] and that the Trinity of God was made
[1:01:34] known cause and not now we're here just
[1:01:37] a beautiful statement here here when
[1:01:40] death hell and grave is conquered
[1:01:42] because of a resurrection that brother
[1:01:45] branham say it defeated the Trinity of
[1:01:47] Satan but it also a man expressed the
[1:01:51] Trinity of God hallelujah and the
[1:01:54] Trinity of God was wrapped up in one man
[1:01:57] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he is
[1:02:00] the father he is the son he is the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost
[1:02:07] so the Trinity of God defeated the
[1:02:11] Trinity of Satan hallelujah that's why
[1:02:14] we celebrate Easter glory to God look at
[1:02:17] this he goes on the city and she says
[1:02:18] and prove that the Trinity of Satan was
[1:02:21] conquer and that the Trinity of God was
[1:02:23] made known because only God alone had
[1:02:26] power to bring life
[1:02:27] again he was that Emmanuel God had been
[1:02:31] manifested in the flesh no wonder he
[1:02:35] could claim their Matthew 27th chapter
[1:02:38] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:02:42] into my hand and I send you to be my
[1:02:45] witnesses all the world he had conquered
[1:02:47] both death hell and the grave not only
[1:02:51] did he do that and come out try up with
[1:02:54] all the power in heaven and earth all
[1:02:56] that was the father and and all that was
[1:02:59] the Holy Ghost and all that they ever
[1:03:01] was was in him all powers in heaven and
[1:03:04] in earth is given unto me everything
[1:03:07] else is powerless he accompanied that
[1:03:11] statement everything else is powerless
[1:03:16] even this virus how when it comes to the
[1:03:21] Lord Jesus claim no power say brother
[1:03:27] Jack what if you are what have you got
[1:03:29] sick and you died good for me the other
[1:03:34] saying good for me I as a Christian I do
[1:03:38] not lose in the ocean because they
[1:03:47] couldn't get a grave to put me in I
[1:03:49] still will not lose hallelujah this
[1:03:59] earth the key so we don't have anything
[1:04:01] to fear he's conquered everything Oh
[1:04:05] blessed be the name look look I can tell
[1:04:08] you right now God is on the other side
[1:04:09] of this there's still tribulation left
[1:04:11] to be done

[1:04:14] judgment that has to happen according to
[1:04:16] scripture that's still a millennium rain

[1:06:35] time to do it amen I know I know if you
[1:06:38] want to come with a mask our baptizing a
[1:06:40] mask
[1:06:43] hey man but we want to get people ready
[1:06:46] how do we want to get you into the
[1:06:48] secret place glory to God hallelujah let
[1:06:55] me just keep reading by the grace of God
[1:06:57] a man look at this he makes a statement
[1:07:01] here in the message I am the
[1:07:03] resurrection and the life says Oh
[1:07:09] Christianity is based upon the
[1:07:12] resurrection he says the that's our
[1:07:16] hopes now let's find out why the Creator
[1:07:19] has so set it in order if we did not
[1:07:23] even have a Bible look at this now if we
[1:07:26] didn't even have a Bible we would still
[1:07:29] know that Christianity was right over
[1:07:32] all the other religions if I didn't have
[1:07:34] a Bible I would know Christianity
[1:07:37] Christianity is right now notice what
[1:07:39] Christianity is based upon the first
[1:07:41] statement that was in that in that says
[1:07:43] Christianity is based upon resurrection
[1:07:46] now he goes on he says now resurrection
[1:07:50] is not replacement
[1:08:15] but resurrection resurrection is
[1:08:21] bringing up the same thing that went
[1:08:24] down but this morning standing here
[1:08:30] where I'm standing I can say I have
[1:08:31] experienced a resurrection and I can say
[1:08:36] this - what a resurrection this is says
[1:08:45] now resurrection is not replacement
[1:08:47] resurrection is bringing the same thing
[1:08:50] up that went down if I should drop the
[1:08:53] Bible from the stand on the floor and
[1:08:56] catch some another Bible and replace it
[1:08:59] that's replacement since what
[1:09:02] resurrection is bringing the same Bible
[1:09:05] up that went down
[1:09:07] that's what resurrection means to be
[1:09:10] raised up so resurrection means to be
[1:09:15] raised up can I ask the question has
[1:09:18] anybody in here been raised up brother
[1:09:32] Branham section she come to church say I
[1:09:34] want to thank the Lord that I'm not
[1:09:36] where I want to be I'm not where I ought
[1:09:40] to be but I sure thank God that I'm not
[1:09:44] what I used to be the reason I can say
[1:09:48] you used to be because oh I see in my
[1:09:52] own life that God has resurrected me I
[1:09:55] don't care if nobody else don't see it I
[1:09:58] don't know where God has brought me from
[1:10:01] hallelujah that's why I can claim well a
[1:10:04] resurrection this is some personal
[1:10:08] testimony Church look at this look at
[1:10:11] this he made a statement if I didn't
[1:10:15] even have a Bible we didn't even have a
[1:10:17] Bible we would still know that Christian
[1:10:19] is right not just you know thought about
[1:10:20] this and and I want to just kind of go a
[1:10:22] little further amen
[1:10:24] just just reminding us of some things
[1:10:27] the resurrection is demonstrated in
[1:10:29] nature I've talked about Joe a little
[1:10:31] early let me go back and just kind of
[1:10:33] talk about that a little bit more Joe
[1:10:35] could actually look and see that
[1:10:38] winner-winner when a tree died say that
[1:10:41] tree came back the next year you know
[1:10:46] the Sun the Sun amen every day
[1:10:52] it rises in the morning it sets in the
[1:10:55] evening hallelujah that the night comes
[1:10:59] in and the moon is shining glory to God
[1:11:01] you don't see the Sun anymore it it
[1:11:03] brings its the greatest light source
[1:11:05] that we have the Sun amen
[1:11:07] but at night time the Sun is missing we
[1:11:10] don't have it anymore but but but the
[1:11:12] good thing about is that if we can just
[1:11:14] make it through the night we will see
[1:11:17] the same Sun that we saw yesterday will
[1:11:21] rise again the next day as a cycle amen
[1:11:26] and it's in what I would call a
[1:11:28] resurrection cycle if you didn't have a
[1:11:32] Bible you can't just look at nature and
[1:11:35] see that God is in nature Christianity
[1:11:39] is based upon this principle of
[1:11:41] resurrection Oh glory to God now I was
[1:11:44] just thinking to myself there's some
[1:11:47] mourners that you wake up you know the
[1:11:50] Sun rose but because of storm clouds you
[1:11:53] can't see the Sun hallelujah glory to
[1:11:57] God what I call that is a temporarily
[1:12:00] block of your view of seeing the SU in
[1:12:04] amen but even though you have a
[1:12:06] temporarily a temporary block a man from
[1:12:10] actually seeing the SU in that does not
[1:12:13] mean that the SU in did not rise you
[1:12:18] might have a temporary a may your view
[1:12:21] may be hindered temporarily but it does
[1:12:24] not mean that the SU is did not rise and
[1:12:27] some of us temporary where the temporary
[1:12:30] block from the enemy allow us to see
[1:12:33] that the s om has also risen glory to
[1:12:38] God but your temporary trouble Amen in
[1:12:41] your temporary mindset does not stop the
[1:12:44] fact that the s in has risen and one day
[1:12:49] that base top will shine inside your
[1:12:52] heart if we didn't have a bar but we
[1:12:57] were still no Christianity was right
[1:13:01] when that tree loses it leaves in the
[1:13:05] fall the SAP begin to drop down in the
[1:13:08] roots during the winter and that tree
[1:13:11] may look dead in the winter time but
[1:13:14] it's this time of year spring time the
[1:13:17] same time we celebrate Easter it's the
[1:13:20] spring time that that the tree begins to
[1:13:23] live again and that the same tree that
[1:13:25] looked dead in the winter now begins to
[1:13:28] show forth a man leaves and blossoming
[1:13:31] and just doing all kind of things it
[1:13:32] showed that the tree still had life as
[1:13:35] long as a person didn't cut that tree
[1:13:37] down
[1:13:37] it had a it had an intelligence God was
[1:13:41] a men still dealing with that tree in a
[1:13:43] show that I still have like I don't care
[1:13:45] where a person might be right now if
[1:13:48] they have come from God they will go
[1:13:50] back to God there will be a resurrection
[1:13:54] there will be an Easter in the spring
[1:14:04] and fall here it's going through the
[1:14:07] process of dying in the winter you don't
[1:14:09] even see it anymore you don't see it now
[1:14:12] you know what God is not planting a new
[1:14:16] flower for the spring but what happened
[1:14:20] amen before the winter something
[1:14:23] happened in the flower there was a seed
[1:14:26] in the flower that went back into the
[1:14:30] earth hallelujah and since it was a seed
[1:14:34] from the flower that makes it the same
[1:14:38] flower it's the resurrection of the same
[1:14:42] flower and in a gulp of that process
[1:14:44] year after year after year
[1:14:47] so before you went through your Amen
[1:14:50] your winter season and like something
[1:14:52] dropped and that's why in springtime it
[1:14:56] comes back up it just has to get in the
[1:14:58] right position for the SU in to strike
[1:15:01] it and then it begins to live again
[1:15:03] that's why you're living again why the
[1:15:05] resurrection this is look at this
[1:15:12] the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[1:15:16] produces many resurrections we look
[1:15:22] there in in Matthew 27 I read that for
[1:15:28] you earlier in Matthew 27
[1:15:47] Matthew 27 verse 52 says and the graves
[1:15:55] were opened and many bodies of the
[1:16:00] saints which slept arose now when did
[1:16:03] this happen
[1:16:06] verse 53 and came out of the grace after
[1:16:11] his resurrection so many of the people
[1:16:14] that were sleeping actually got up after
[1:16:18] his resurrection all right
[1:16:20] Laurie to God so here's one resurrection
[1:16:23] produce many resurrections glory to God
[1:16:27] his one resurrection changed many
[1:16:31] people's situations here's one
[1:16:33] resurrection is still change in our
[1:16:36] situation glory to God now let me just
[1:16:39] Oh glory glory glory glory glory let me
[1:16:45] uh let me let me
[1:16:47] I'm just Coast you a little bit I read
[1:16:52] before I read this one when we talk
[1:16:56] about this resurrection
[1:16:57] it's a raising up I can't help but go
[1:17:00] back to the story of Peter and Peter
[1:17:05] denied him just like the other disciples
[1:17:08] denied him they all left him at this
[1:17:10] time that the soldiers would come in to
[1:17:12] take him away and Judas sold them out
[1:17:14] with this this kiss where he betrayed
[1:17:17] the Lord Jesus and and Jesus told Peter
[1:17:19] said now and you know he was telling
[1:17:21] what was getting ready to happen proper
[1:17:23] sign to them and I appealing like no I'm
[1:17:26] not gonna leave you I'm gonna be right
[1:17:27] there everybody else may do it but I'll
[1:17:29] be right there
[1:17:29] and and Jesus say you know what before
[1:17:32] the cop actually crow twice you're gonna
[1:17:35] be done denied me three times people say
[1:17:37] oh not me he said okay all right right
[1:17:39] no I'm not even argue it already I'm
[1:17:41] telling you what the vision sing
[1:17:42] hallelujah he'd say but i'ma meet you in
[1:17:44] Galilee I'm gonna meet you Galilee too
[1:17:47] now now I can imagine Peter a man going
[1:17:50] through and and hear you denied the Lord
[1:17:54] three times and then the crowing
[1:17:57] I've just let Jesus down and I can see
[1:18:00] their eyes just catching each other and
[1:18:02] Jesus pretty much totally did not tell
[1:18:05] you what you're gonna do and being like
[1:18:07] I can't believe it took off running
[1:18:09] didn't know what to do just just in a
[1:18:12] manic state of conviction condemnation
[1:18:14] all over him
[1:18:15] but but he had also said Peter I'm gonna
[1:18:17] meet you in Galilee I know you're gonna
[1:18:19] deny me I know you're gonna do this
[1:18:21] under you don't do that but I must still
[1:18:22] meet you in Galilee I'm still gonna meet
[1:18:25] you
[1:18:26] so I'll Peter you know after you went
[1:18:29] through I listened and the news came
[1:18:30] that that Jesus had risen they went he
[1:18:33] told me it's on the total ad say go tell
[1:18:36] my disciples and Peter that I will meet
[1:18:41] them in Galilee
[1:18:42] let me Peter I don't care how discourage
[1:18:44] you up Peter I don't care I've defeated
[1:18:47] you up Peter I don't care how you've
[1:18:49] given up on yourself I'm gonna meet you
[1:18:51] still in Galilee and God used that same
[1:18:54] pinna to be the spokesman on the day of
[1:18:57] Pentecost his spirit glory to God and
[1:19:06] some of us see the resurrection of our
[1:19:08] spirit even at a time like this we need
[1:19:12] to experience a resurrection God is
[1:19:15] still in control glory hallelujah
[1:19:19] Peter had a resurrection of his spirit I
[1:19:22] think about the brothers on the road to
[1:19:24] Emmaus they were a little discouraged as
[1:19:25] they were going back to Emmaus and they
[1:19:28] were man they were so down Trotman and
[1:19:30] as they went they were sitting there
[1:19:32] talking about the events that occurred
[1:19:34] the Bible say a stranger came from
[1:19:36] behind the bush began to walk with them
[1:19:38] we need that same stranger to walk with
[1:19:40] us and as Jesus began to talk say now
[1:19:44] what would things happen what's also sad
[1:19:46] about what's going on they say are you a
[1:19:47] stranger around here you don't know what
[1:19:49] them happening and in in the city like
[1:19:51] what what things what things are
[1:19:52] happening and as they began to say you
[1:19:54] know you know we were expecting this
[1:19:55] Jesus to do it to do this thing to do
[1:19:58] that and they don't crucified him and
[1:20:00] he's dead and say we don't know what to
[1:20:02] do and as as they were sitting so the
[1:20:03] skirts they were on the way back to
[1:20:05] their old churches
[1:20:07] they were only way back to their old
[1:20:09] situations they want all the way back to
[1:20:11] a man all circumstance they will only
[1:20:13] wait back to something that felt
[1:20:14] comfortable glory to God but uh but by
[1:20:19] Jesus beginning the camera break open
[1:20:21] the scripture any say now this man Jesus
[1:20:23] that you talk about in the Bible say
[1:20:25] this and then the Bible say that and
[1:20:27] then the Holy Scriptures say this then
[1:20:29] the Word of God say that didn't it and
[1:20:31] then they say oh my yes that's exactly
[1:20:33] what the Word of God said didn't that
[1:20:35] man fulfill these scriptures they say oh
[1:20:38] yeah that's exactly what happened as
[1:20:40] they begin Oh hallelujah as they begin
[1:20:44] to fellowship around the word it brought
[1:20:47] encouragement I want to encourage you to
[1:20:49] do something in this season give people
[1:20:53] the Word of God don't give them nothing
[1:20:57] else give people the word give them the
[1:21:01] scripture if you want to see people get
[1:21:04] encouraged can't them the scripture but
[1:21:14] actually begin to share the scripture
[1:21:15] with with us as you share with us as he
[1:21:19] broke open his word to us they say they
[1:21:22] got to the city and Jesus acted as if he
[1:21:25] was going to keep going on the journey
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:30] they step into a restaurant saying the
[1:21:33] waitress brought some food he's saying
[1:21:36] when the waitress brought food food he's
[1:21:38] saying he's saying Jesus bless the bread
[1:21:41] and he broke the bread right there in
[1:21:44] the restaurant now this is just a quote
[1:21:45] that I bet you know brother branham you
[1:21:47] know you say he's broke the bread
[1:21:48] right down the restaurant he said when
[1:21:50] the umbrella saw him break bread Oh
[1:21:52] hallelujah I wish they could have caught
[1:21:55] it a little earlier amen they could
[1:21:57] catch it when he was breaking the
[1:21:59] spiritual bread of scripture revealing
[1:22:02] the Word of God - but they caught it
[1:22:03] when he broke natural bread and they say
[1:22:06] only Jesus could break bread the way it
[1:22:09] has been broken and when they recognized
[1:22:12] that it was Jesus he disappeared but you
[1:22:15] know what they're in their
[1:22:18] discouragement also
[1:22:20] disappeared what we need is the Lord
[1:22:25] Jesus to break bread again with us and
[1:22:28] watch this courage disappear what we
[1:22:42] need is the resurrection in our spirits
[1:22:45] I don't care what you're going through
[1:22:47] God can give you a resurrection in your
[1:22:50] spirit this resurrection produced many
[1:22:57] other resurrections you experienced a
[1:23:01] resurrection when you're baptized in the
[1:23:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:23:05] tells us in Romans 6 verse three and
[1:23:08] four three through five it says know ye
[1:23:12] not that so many of us as were baptized
[1:23:17] into Jesus Christ Romans 6 verse 3
[1:23:19] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:23:22] into his death therefore we are buried
[1:23:26] with him by baptism into death that like
[1:23:31] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:23:33] the glory of the Father even so we also
[1:23:35] should walk in the newness of life for
[1:23:38] if we have been planted together in the
[1:23:40] likeness of his death we shall be also
[1:23:42] in the likeness of his resurrection and
[1:23:46] I always like to read the scripture with
[1:23:47] people that have been baptized in the
[1:23:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it
[1:23:51] shows us that when we're baptized
[1:23:53] just like Jesus went into the heart of
[1:23:55] the earth for three days a man we might
[1:23:58] go into the water for three seconds but
[1:24:00] just like Jesus rose a man from that
[1:24:03] death amen when we rise out of the water
[1:24:06] Jesus rose and it changed life for
[1:24:08] everybody
[1:24:09] glory to God but when we rise from that
[1:24:12] water our life is changed forever
[1:24:14] hallelujah
[1:24:16] baptism is symbolic a man of a
[1:24:19] resurrection a man you can experience a
[1:24:22] resurrection in your spirit when you're
[1:24:25] baptized in the name of Jesus glory amen
[1:24:29] you can and
[1:24:31] and I want to mention this Oh glory
[1:24:34] glory glory
[1:24:36] Ephesians 2:1 he feeds us to one it says
[1:24:40] and you have he quickened who were dead
[1:24:46] in trespasses and sins now to be
[1:24:50] quickened is actually to be made alive a
[1:24:53] man and what happened with Christ when
[1:24:55] he was in the grave he was quickened
[1:24:58] now I got a quote here now and I will I
[1:25:01] won't I might not have time to read it
[1:25:03] but I'll just tell you what it is the
[1:25:05] probably said when Jesus went to the
[1:25:08] grave you realize a man that got up from
[1:25:14] the grave glory to God nobody racism it
[1:25:18] was the Spirit of God that quicken him
[1:25:21] and calls him to Rozzie
[1:25:22] do you realize a man with that power he
[1:25:25] could arose in one minute of his death
[1:25:28] he could arose in one second of his
[1:25:32] death he could arose in one hour of his
[1:25:36] death he could have risen in one day of
[1:25:41] his death but the reason he did is
[1:25:43] because the Word of God said that he had
[1:25:46] to stay there for three days he was
[1:25:48] bound by his own word hey man he had the
[1:25:56] power to get up glory to God but he did
[1:25:59] not break the word that was said he had
[1:26:01] to stay there for three days but he had
[1:26:09] the whole truth to the Word of God so
[1:26:11] after that third day brother the devil
[1:26:13] was in trouble lost the key says Houston
[1:26:16] there the whole world has been turned
[1:26:18] upside down
[1:26:19] glory to God when Jesus rose again now I
[1:26:24] want to tell you this a man that was a
[1:26:26] powerful powerful resurrection but as we
[1:26:31] read in the scripture you hath he
[1:26:32] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:26:34] and sin now if you were honest with
[1:26:37] yourself we all have
[1:26:39] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:26:42] God but the reason we're sitting here
[1:26:45] right now is because we have received a
[1:26:48] resurrection and I'm here to say what a
[1:26:51] resurrection this is
[1:26:58] when brother branham was i said i said
[1:27:01] his his his death produced many
[1:27:05] resurrection me even in our own lives
[1:27:09] we've been resurrected from sin if
[1:27:11] you've ever been sick in your body and
[1:27:13] you've been healed by the power god he
[1:27:15] was resurrected for them from illness
[1:27:18] we've been resurrected if some of us had
[1:27:21] the opportunity to go through
[1:27:22] denominations do you know by coming out
[1:27:25] of the denominational system and coming
[1:27:28] here to the message do you know do you
[1:27:30] know you experienced a resurrection you
[1:27:34] were dead in denominations but because
[1:27:38] you came out oh I don't know if we get
[1:27:41] the same voice that called Lazarus of a
[1:27:46] grief is the same voice that called us
[1:27:49] out of the grave the denominator if you
[1:27:53] were in a bar dying and you heard the
[1:27:57] voice of God you know people go to the
[1:27:59] bottom they talk about God they supposed
[1:28:02] to be out there talking about something
[1:28:03] else they end up talking about God and
[1:28:04] something strike him on the heart I
[1:28:06] shouldn't be doing this I shouldn't be
[1:28:08] out here this club you are experiencing
[1:28:10] a resurrection and that that's why you
[1:28:14] can say what a resurrection see when
[1:28:16] your eyes come up into it
[1:28:18] not what a resurrection that was what a
[1:28:22] resurrection this is make it president
[1:28:33] Jesus made it present it's when he got
[1:28:36] there to the grave of Lazarus he told
[1:28:38] Martha I am the resurrection and the
[1:28:41] life he made it present it not not he
[1:28:44] gonna rise getting latter day I don't
[1:28:45] talk about right now he's gonna rise
[1:28:47] because I am the resurrection he made a
[1:28:50] president and he is still the
[1:28:52] resurrection the resurrection is a
[1:28:54] person the person of the Lord Jesus and
[1:28:57] if he has done anything for you anything
[1:29:01] you can't say what a resurrection this
[1:29:05] is let me go a little further if you
[1:29:10] came out of denominational Church you
[1:29:14] had a resurrection now I'ma tell you
[1:29:16] that statement and this me is where
[1:29:19] brother Branham gave us discount and I'm
[1:29:22] gonna read this quote for you so you can
[1:29:25] see where I got it from
[1:29:27] it is the Raja of the Sun look at what
[1:29:28] the promises he says as Christ was the
[1:29:34] first one to raise paragraph 94 says
[1:29:37] this Christ was the first one to raise
[1:29:39] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:29:43] although typed in many places
[1:29:45] he was the first fruits of those that's
[1:29:47] left in the bride coming of Christ I
[1:29:52] love this coming out of the church
[1:29:56] there'll have to be a sheaf waved again
[1:29:59] in the last days
[1:30:00] oh my waving of the sheath says what was
[1:30:04] the sheet what was the sheaf the first
[1:30:06] one that comes to me to mature the first
[1:30:09] one that proved it was a week that
[1:30:12] proved it was a she you know talked
[1:30:18] about in Israel's history they would
[1:30:19] plant their crops and they plant wheat
[1:30:21] and in the first they watching the crop
[1:30:24] oh I mean
[1:30:25] crops you know you got it if you are a
[1:30:28] farmer depending on your crops you would
[1:30:30] be great for your pram for Raymond and
[1:30:32] Israel it doesn't rain like it rains
[1:30:34] here you know they have a certain season
[1:30:36] they have to get written they got to get
[1:30:38] so much rain for that season it has to
[1:30:40] carry them through the year they got
[1:30:42] vets that they build and and whales that
[1:30:44] they built to try to capture all the
[1:30:46] water that comes during that season and
[1:30:47] if it doesn't rain they gonna have a
[1:30:49] drought so they pray for rain they
[1:30:52] danced for rain kids come out of the
[1:30:54] school and start shopping and dancing
[1:30:57] and jumping and glorifying God when it
[1:30:59] rains they're happy to have rain so so
[1:31:02] you know when they're doing this a man
[1:31:04] over there in Israel you know they're
[1:31:05] watching for the crops in and this man
[1:31:07] is growing weaning and what he's doing
[1:31:09] is looking for the first sheet that
[1:31:10] comes to mat or the first one that comes
[1:31:13] to to be grain he says when he fired was
[1:31:15] the first one he picks it up and he just
[1:31:18] weaves it and what that is a wave
[1:31:21] offering the God and it's saying that
[1:31:23] God I thank you for this but there's
[1:31:25] gonna be more that come forth to
[1:31:26] maturity amen my crop is going to it's
[1:31:30] gonna make it we're gonna live we gonna
[1:31:32] sell this and my family's gonna be all
[1:31:34] right because I got the first witness
[1:31:36] customer to it now glory
[1:31:37] it ought to give you it would give the
[1:31:39] farmer encouragement when he sees the
[1:31:42] first one waved now we know Jesus Christ
[1:31:44] was the first one way that came up from
[1:31:47] the dead and if he rose we're going to
[1:31:51] rise amen since he rose we're already
[1:31:54] rising hallelujah we're already
[1:31:58] experiencing resurrections since he rose
[1:32:01] because many of the things arose after
[1:32:04] his resurrection and many of us have
[1:32:06] risen from our dead denominations from
[1:32:09] our dead a man stands in and talks in
[1:32:12] our character we have risen from that
[1:32:14] and we come alive in Christ Jesus the
[1:32:21] Lord Jesus and what he did for the
[1:32:23] rabbits even bringing it forward to him
[1:32:24] because he being a manifested son of God
[1:32:27] was the first one to come to maturity in
[1:32:30] our day and he was way before the people
[1:32:32] and what we saw in his ministry is what
[1:32:35] we expect to see in the bride
[1:32:38] the rock coming of Christ can I go a
[1:32:44] little further with that waving of the
[1:32:48] sheet what was a sheath the first one
[1:32:50] that come to maturity the first one that
[1:32:52] proved it was wheat that proved it was a
[1:32:56] sheaf it says I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:33:01] talking about
[1:33:02] it was waved over the people and the
[1:33:06] first time there will come forth for the
[1:33:08] bride age that's the age you live in
[1:33:10] here right the bride age for a
[1:33:13] resurrection out of dark denomination
[1:33:16] ISM see that you have been resurrected
[1:33:18] out of dark denominationalism the same
[1:33:22] voice that said Lazarus come forth is
[1:33:24] the same voice we heard when we were in
[1:33:26] denomination and it called you by your
[1:33:28] name come forth
[1:33:30] that's why brother Branham gave us the
[1:33:32] tight of the mother Eagle flying over me
[1:33:36] when the mother Eagle come flying over
[1:33:38] that little baby you can have no idea
[1:33:39] what that was but he can identify with
[1:33:41] the screen we didn't know nothing about
[1:33:43] this God sent the Prophet God did this
[1:33:45] we don't know but we could identify with
[1:33:47] the screaming just by hearing
[1:33:49] revelations about what happened in the
[1:33:50] garden of evil God being one when we
[1:33:53] heard these revelations the Bible begin
[1:33:55] to click then because we couldn't accept
[1:33:57] all the other stuff that they were
[1:33:58] teaching we heard the screen of the
[1:34:00] mother Eagle we identify with it we had
[1:34:04] a resurrection amen
[1:34:10] he says and the first time they would
[1:34:12] come forth Oh glory for the bride age
[1:34:16] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:34:18] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:34:21] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:34:23] back again in its full power and being
[1:34:27] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:34:30] and wonders that he did back there look
[1:34:32] at this because I live he live also look
[1:34:37] at what he say speaking to his wife so
[1:34:41] that scripture because I live he live
[1:34:44] also is not for everybody brother
[1:34:47] Branham says he's speaking to his
[1:34:49] wife is his wife sitting here this
[1:34:51] morning
[1:34:52] amen he's speaking to his wife because I
[1:34:56] live ye live oh look at this Amen look
[1:35:03] at this he says speaking to his wife
[1:35:08] what a resurrection that that was and
[1:35:14] what a resurrection this is so he's
[1:35:19] taking us back there to look at you know
[1:35:21] what happened some 2000 years ago but we
[1:35:24] coming out of dark denominationalism we
[1:35:27] coming out of the things of the world we
[1:35:30] coming out of discouragement we coming
[1:35:33] out of sickness we coming out of the
[1:35:37] virus but when a resurrection he says he
[1:35:54] says what a resurrection that that was
[1:35:57] and what a resurrection this is to be
[1:36:02] quickened from the dead to be made made
[1:36:05] alive in Christ Jesus by God's Quinten
[1:36:07] power he was waved to them the word
[1:36:10] which he was was way back to them on the
[1:36:13] day of Pentecost the word made manifest
[1:36:15] now and as I say is to be waved again in
[1:36:18] the last day now for instance he said
[1:36:21] and that's just just one statement that
[1:36:23] he makes but I was blessed by that
[1:36:25] because I was thinking that what a
[1:36:26] resurrection this is he made it present
[1:36:29] tense the Prophet brought the story of
[1:36:32] Easter and put us in it we are a part of
[1:36:36] that resurrection the same way he came
[1:36:39] out the grave we came out of the grave
[1:36:41] and denomination you're experiencing you
[1:36:43] came out of the grave of the world the
[1:36:45] devil tried to bury you the devil tried
[1:36:47] to kill you some of y'all were dead dead
[1:36:49] in sins and trespasses we all were there
[1:36:52] Laurita God but he has quickened us
[1:36:56] the same way he was quickened from the
[1:36:58] dead we had been quick
[1:37:05] it's a little last statement I think I
[1:37:07] want to read here
[1:37:13] this is out of the message feet
[1:37:20] says when you got to use faith in God to
[1:37:24] make it work so you got your own
[1:37:29] resurrection inside
[1:37:36] can you imagine brother branham coming
[1:37:39] to your church notice the paragraph
[1:37:41] number in that one before he opens his
[1:37:46] Bible he walks up into the pool and the
[1:37:52] fret he don't say god bless you good
[1:37:53] morning friends
[1:37:54] nothing just walks out see see this way
[1:38:00] when you come to church you better be
[1:38:01] ready to say a man because something
[1:38:03] would go right over your head and you
[1:38:04] won't even know the first statement that
[1:38:07] he walks out him says when you've got to
[1:38:09] use faith in God to make it worse he so
[1:38:12] you got your own resurrection inside of
[1:38:14] you know you know you're gonna sit there
[1:38:17] thank you what did he just say the
[1:38:20] resurrection is wet you got your own
[1:38:23] resurrection inside oh no you're not
[1:38:29] waiting on a resurrection you already
[1:38:32] got your own resurrection I'm sorry and
[1:38:35] this is why I've been telling you've
[1:38:37] been experiencing it all along that's
[1:38:40] why you can look that there was a lot of
[1:38:42] resurrection this is you got your own
[1:38:45] resurrection inside of you look at this
[1:38:48] he says your resurrection lays inside of
[1:38:55] you in your spirit Oh glory to God since
[1:39:02] now you know when Jesus died on the
[1:39:04] cross his soul descended into hell and
[1:39:07] preached to the souls that were in
[1:39:09] prison that repented not in that
[1:39:12] repented not in long-suffering in the
[1:39:13] days of North his body went into the
[1:39:16] grave but before he thought he committed
[1:39:17] his spirit into the hands of God it
[1:39:21] reminds me of that flower that seed that
[1:39:23] drops in the earth before anything
[1:39:25] happens there's a seat that drops in the
[1:39:27] earth and when that when springtime
[1:39:28] comes that flower has to come
[1:39:30] and resurrection is not replacement
[1:39:33] resurrection is the same thing that went
[1:39:35] down must come back up look at it he
[1:39:38] says so you see his spirit went to God
[1:39:41] his soul went to hell
[1:39:42] his body went to the grave now that
[1:39:45] spirit that was in him was a spirit of
[1:39:47] God and that spirit and sundry times and
[1:39:50] divers manners time knowing that the
[1:39:51] prophets to bring the message to the
[1:39:53] people in the last days through Christ
[1:39:56] and now these days here through the
[1:39:59] gospel says now when we receive Christ
[1:40:03] into our hearts since that's theirs
[1:40:06] all that we have need of theirs eternal
[1:40:09] life now Christ could not come back
[1:40:11] until three days was so filled because
[1:40:13] the spirit was behind the screen like a
[1:40:16] bar like this that it could not cross
[1:40:18] over that bar because it was a spoken
[1:40:21] word of God that he was delayed in the
[1:40:23] grave for three days and three nights
[1:40:25] now he could not come back until that
[1:40:29] three days and nights was up then when
[1:40:32] three days and nights was up his spirit
[1:40:35] was loosed it went directly to his soul
[1:40:38] and his soul came back and picked up the
[1:40:41] body and fulfilled what he said I have
[1:40:44] power to lay my life down I have power
[1:40:47] to take it up again
[1:40:50] Jesus made that made that comment I have
[1:40:54] power to lay down my life I have power
[1:40:56] to pick it up again no you can always
[1:41:06] put this two thousand years ago what
[1:41:07] Jesus said but you know your
[1:41:09] resurrection lays inside of you and the
[1:41:12] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:41:15] dead if it wasn't you it will quicken
[1:41:19] your mortal bodies it'll make you come
[1:41:22] alive you know what you can't even
[1:41:26] even if you tried to stop it you can't
[1:41:29] Oh
[1:41:31] if you come from God you will go back to
[1:41:34] God a man turns watch this watch this
[1:41:37] thickness now each one of you
[1:41:45] the same power that you say I know man
[1:41:49] take my life but I'll lay it down
[1:41:51] he says he says I have power to lay it
[1:41:53] down to have powered reason brother
[1:41:54] Branham says and I need y'all to get
[1:41:56] this these are his first comments in the
[1:42:00] sermon faith have you realized he made
[1:42:03] comments like this is really taking us
[1:42:05] beyond faith
[1:42:10] glory glory glory he says now each one
[1:42:13] you have power the same way because you
[1:42:17] are sons and daughters of God and the
[1:42:21] very spirit that is in you this morning
[1:42:24] the Holy Spirit that's in you this
[1:42:26] morning that same Holy Spirit will raise
[1:42:29] you up look at this so you have power to
[1:42:37] raise yourself back up

[1:43:02] it's time to change that you pray for
[1:43:05] yourself

[1:44:03] son of God and I'm a daughter of God I
[1:44:06] can have what I what I'm asking God for
[1:44:09] the same power that Jesus had in him say

[1:44:43] you want to know why because
[1:44:44] resurrection power is already inside you
[1:44:50] what the resurrection
[1:44:56] when you die your soul we're going to
[1:45:01] not also to go alright right in the
[1:45:03] Friends of God man your spirit will go
[1:45:04] to God but you cannot come back remember
[1:45:06] the Bible said silver an altar crying
[1:45:08] Lord how long how long they could not
[1:45:10] return it to the scriptures for field
[1:45:11] and like Christ could not return to the
[1:45:13] scriptures
[1:45:15] you know brother Branham goes on later
[1:45:19] on he just begins to explain about those
[1:45:21] dimensions six dimension and even
[1:45:32] brother went into that dimension Paul be
[1:45:40] judge the same way I have to be just yet
[1:45:42] Paul gonna be judge the same way he said
[1:45:44] well I preached the same thing he said
[1:46:00] that millions millions that yelled out
[1:46:03] for the brand up say I saw you there he
[1:46:06] was talking to his church I got a chance
[1:46:10] to hear it and since he said it I
[1:46:13] absolutely believed he saw me there and
[1:46:22] he say he say he said Jesus was in the
[1:46:24] seventh dimension he say and one day
[1:46:26] he'll come to you
[1:46:27] glory to God one day he'll come to you
[1:46:29] it says but right now we just go to the
[1:46:31] sixth dimension when we die that's why I
[1:46:33] say if if the took me out if I
[1:46:36] baptized somebody they had the virus and
[1:46:38] didn't I got it y'all let everybody know
[1:46:41] that tizen somebody in the name of the
[1:46:43] Lord Jesus Christ tell him I said it on
[1:46:46] don't think I'll die
[1:46:48] baptizing somebody in the name of the
[1:46:50] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah right
[1:46:53] because one soul is worth ten thousand
[1:46:57] worlds whatever happens
[1:47:23] quote the Word of God to the devil and
[1:47:26] watch God come with an anointing on his
[1:47:28] word God will quicken the word God will
[1:47:31] anoint the word the Spirit will come on
[1:47:33] the word and watch God to feel what he
[1:47:36] said
[1:47:36] if he did it in Jesus he'll do it in you
[1:47:39] your resurrection is in you what a
[1:47:45] resurrection
[1:47:55] Father in the name of Jesus
[1:47:59] how grateful we are for the word of the
[1:48:02] Lord's prophet God is bringing things to
[1:48:07] our attention God things that we
[1:48:11] wouldn't hear in the average church as I
[1:48:16] was just listening to this sermon Lord
[1:48:18] on it is the rising of the Sun just
[1:48:23] thinking how the Prophet said he was
[1:48:24] just he woke up that morning five
[1:48:27] o'clock or so in the morning listening
[1:48:29] to the birds singing and I just really
[1:48:31] didn't know which way to go with his
[1:48:33] thought he just didn't know what to do
[1:48:37] but Oh God a little girl walked in with
[1:48:40] a car and said daddy and me and daddy
[1:48:42] won to give you this Easter card and in
[1:48:45] the car that talked about the rise of
[1:48:46] the Sun so the Prophet drew an
[1:48:48] inspiration from that
[1:48:50] and Lord with him going out to that
[1:48:52] pulpit and sharing thoughts like this
[1:48:54] helps us to see Lord that father
[1:49:01] we are experiencing resurrections even
[1:49:04] right now this is not an event that
[1:49:07] occurred just two thousand years ago but
[1:49:10] it's still happening
[1:49:10] even today I believe somebody can
[1:49:12] experience a resurrection
[1:49:14] well maybe somebody's watching at home
[1:49:17] Missy I've never heard it that way
[1:49:19] before but I want to have the
[1:49:21] resurrection in my life god I created to
[1:49:25] it do a mighty work in their view you

[1:49:30] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:49:33] hath everlasting life
[1:49:34] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:49:36] passed from death unto life as the word
[1:49:39] is being heard let the word transform
[1:49:42] hearts bring the people to a place of
[1:49:44] true repentance God that they would
[1:49:47] desire to be baptized in the name of the
[1:49:49] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:49:53] sins you promise according to your word
[1:49:56] that they would receive the gift of the
[1:49:58] Holy Ghost that's the place of safety
[1:50:02] God that's what we want to buy and
