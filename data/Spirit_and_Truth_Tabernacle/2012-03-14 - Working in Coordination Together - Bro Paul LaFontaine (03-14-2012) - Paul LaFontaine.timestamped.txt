[40:04] sisters it's out of isaiah 4
[40:06] beautiful branch of the lord and i'm not

[41:23] plan

[51:55] little bit with what we want to
[51:57] share with you this morning in the word
[52:00] and
[52:01] once again we appreciate the privilege
[52:03] and the time together that we have a
[52:05] couple times a year sometimes we
[52:07] come down maybe once a year but it's a
[52:09] real privilege to be able to walk with
[52:11] you
[52:12] and i stand amongst royalty here this
[52:15] morning i believe that with all my heart
[52:17] it won't be difficult to preach because
[52:19] we are hungry people
[52:20] and we're hungry for one thing that's
[52:22] the open word of god
[52:24] amen we have that in common praise the
[52:26] lord we pray god blesses the pastor
[52:28] while he's away
[52:29] from us and blesses his preaching
[52:31] today's ministry to there
[52:33] in the i think he's in uh not charlotte
[52:35] where's he at and
[52:36] columbia i think he's this morning so we
[52:38] pray god will just be with him
[52:40] amen i'm going to read from a couple
[52:42] places one in the old testament one in
[52:44] the new
[52:46] and uh i just want you to turn if you
[52:47] would to nehemiah chapter 10
[52:51] and there's so many different things
[52:54] that the lord has blessed us with in the
[52:58] word
[52:59] and praying and just looking at it and
[53:01] we're going to take a just a little
[53:03] different avenue might be just a bit of
[53:04] a teaching this morning
[53:06] and but we're going to do that
[53:10] and mind the lord amen a lot of
[53:12] different subjects a lot of different
[53:13] things that we could
[53:14] touch on and we have been on the series
[53:17] at home on joshua
[53:18] and these different things but we're
[53:19] going to go back into this and we pray
[53:21] that this will be an edification to the
[53:23] church
[53:24] here in west palm here this morning god
[53:26] bless you uh
[53:27] nehemiah chapter 10 and uh
[53:31] verse 28 nehemiah 10 verse
[53:35] 28 and the rest of the people
[53:39] the priests the levites
[53:42] the porters the singers
[53:45] the mythonyms and all they that had
[53:49] separated themselves from the people of
[53:51] the lands
[53:52] unto now notice they just didn't
[53:55] separate
[53:56] but they separated unto something
[53:59] it's one thing to separate but you've
[54:01] got to go to something
[54:03] and they all separate themselves from
[54:05] the people of the lands unto
[54:07] the word of god the law of god their
[54:10] wives
[54:11] their sons their daughters everyone
[54:14] having knowledge and having
[54:16] understanding they clave to their
[54:19] brethren
[54:20] their nobles and entered into a curse
[54:22] and into an oath
[54:24] to walk in god's laws which was given by
[54:27] moses the servant of god
[54:29] and to observe and to do all the
[54:31] commandments of the lord our god
[54:33] and his judgments and his statues these
[54:36] people once the word was restored to
[54:39] them and their temple was restored to
[54:41] them
[54:41] they felt it wasn't good enough they
[54:43] wanted to enter an oath together
[54:45] they wanted to separate from the peoples
[54:47] of the land and they wanted to cleave to
[54:50] one another and cleave to their wives
[54:51] you notice
[54:52] the relationship that is involved here
[54:55] it's not just that we separate from the
[54:57] world or separate
[54:58] from other people but we must cleave to
[55:01] something that's in the marriage
[55:03] covenant that god gave a man shall leave
[55:05] father
[55:06] and mother but he needs to cleave unto
[55:09] his wife
[55:10] here they clave to their brother and
[55:12] they claim to one another
[55:13] and they claim to the word of god very
[55:16] important
[55:17] as we see the people of god doing that
[55:19] now in the new testament
[55:20] we want to go to ephesians and see the
[55:24] same theme
[55:24] that paul is bringing in here in
[55:26] ephesians chapter 4
[55:28] under the holy ghost church and here in
[55:30] ephesians 4 and verse
[55:32] 15. but speaking the truth in love
[55:36] ephesians 4 15 speaking the truth in
[55:40] love
[55:40] may grow up into him in all things which
[55:42] is the head
[55:44] even christ from whom the whole body
[55:48] fitly joined together and compacted by
[55:52] that which
[55:52] every joint supplieth according to the
[55:55] effectual working
[55:57] in the measure of every part now
[56:00] saints of god i know it's not difficult
[56:03] to see
[56:04] that paul says here that christ is the
[56:06] head but there's a body to the head
[56:09] and that body is joined together and
[56:12] every joint supply if i don't see
[56:14] anything there of
[56:16] individualism that someone separates
[56:18] himself
[56:19] if you're a holy ghost body member you
[56:22] are joined together with the body
[56:25] by spirit can you say man there is no
[56:28] man
[56:28] on an island doing his own thing if
[56:30] you've got the holy ghost you're joined
[56:32] together
[56:34] whether you whether you get along all
[56:36] the time with the person next to you
[56:38] it's not a personality thing it is it is
[56:41] something that
[56:42] is birth by spirit that every joint
[56:45] supplyeth when it is joined together
[56:49] and working in the measure of every part
[56:51] maketh
[56:52] increase of the body unto the edifying
[56:55] of
[56:56] itself
[56:59] it doesn't even say that that god does
[57:02] it we know god does it but it's edifying
[57:04] itself
[57:05] as it's joined together it's building up
[57:08] itself
[57:09] we don't need to necessarily have
[57:11] someone come from the outside and build
[57:13] it up
[57:13] the body's edifying itself
[57:16] amen i think those are powerful words
[57:18] heavenly father bless your word lord as
[57:20] we just
[57:21] cement ourselves to the word that you
[57:23] dropped in our heart last night
[57:25] we know this might be a little bit more
[57:26] of a teaching we don't know which
[57:28] direction it'll go
[57:29] but we know that your presence is here
[57:32] we know that we felt your presence
[57:34] we know the song the sister sang
[57:36] ministered to us in such a great way
[57:38] lord
[57:39] and we give you glory today through the
[57:41] songs of zion we give you glory
[57:43] speak to your people bless the pastor
[57:45] while he's away him and brother smiley
[57:47] just be with them lord anoint them
[57:49] and i pray you'll bless this church
[57:51] bless the future of this church
[57:53] fill every one of these seats and more
[57:55] with hungry souls i pray
[57:57] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[57:59] we commit this service to you
[58:01] in jesus name amen god bless you may be
[58:04] seated
[58:06] now we're going to share some things
[58:07] here and uh
[58:09] some of the things are i will make
[58:12] assumptions that you have studied the
[58:14] book of nehemiah
[58:15] and there's so much in there about the
[58:17] people they had come to a restoration of
[58:19] the temple
[58:20] and that is a type of the bride because
[58:22] we've come to a restoration to the word
[58:24] so i'm going to make assumptions that
[58:25] you understand where we're jumping into
[58:27] the scripture
[58:28] i don't need to qualify that too much
[58:31] but we see that nehemiah's people and
[58:33] the people in the nehemiah
[58:34] was a people that was under the restored
[58:36] word in the restored temple of god
[58:39] and they had there's many great places
[58:40] in there where the the book was restored
[58:43] to them it was open to them
[58:45] they were the people of the open book
[58:46] the word was open
[58:48] and their response to the word was very
[58:51] special after
[58:52] some hundreds of years of rebellion and
[58:55] the reason the temple was destroyed and
[58:57] the reason the people were destroyed
[58:59] and went into captivity is because of
[59:01] the rebellion and getting away from the
[59:02] word
[59:03] once these people realized that god
[59:06] supernaturally
[59:07] had restored them brought them back to
[59:09] jerusalem
[59:10] gave them the power even by authorities
[59:12] to rebuild their temple
[59:14] they could only stand back and say god
[59:16] is in this god wants to restore our
[59:18] temple
[59:18] and so there was there was a respect
[59:21] there was an honor there was a
[59:22] there was a soberness in the people that
[59:25] we
[59:26] never want to do this again we want to
[59:29] hear
[59:29] one place that says in nehemiah that the
[59:31] people listen intently to the word of
[59:33] god
[59:34] no more playing games i want to know
[59:36] what this word says is because when i
[59:38] when we got away from this word our
[59:40] children got away from this word
[59:42] that's when everything fell apart
[59:46] and when they heard the word they said
[59:48] the people listened and i counted up the
[59:50] hours one time because they read
[59:51] all through the moses writings and all
[59:53] through the prophet's message
[59:54] it was some four or five and six hours
[59:56] they read it as the people listen
[59:58] intently the children all
[1:00:00] that's an amazing thing but they were so
[1:00:02] sober to the fact that i've got to hear
[1:00:05] and not only here the bible says they
[1:00:07] wanted the priest to explain it so they
[1:00:09] understood the word not just hear it but
[1:00:12] understand it i tell you under this open
[1:00:15] book with the seven seals taken over
[1:00:17] this book
[1:00:18] it's not just some book on a shell
[1:00:20] somewhere but it's the revelation that
[1:00:22] god gives
[1:00:23] it's the understanding of where we are
[1:00:27] we're not living in a time where we just
[1:00:28] read our bibles just like a baptist and
[1:00:30] i'm not knocking that but we're praying
[1:00:32] god reveal this book to me amen
[1:00:35] amen lack of revelation is how we get in
[1:00:37] trouble
[1:00:39] so the people of nehemiah were the word
[1:00:41] restored to them
[1:00:42] there's but there's just something
[1:00:44] further as we move into
[1:00:46] the end of nehemiah we saw that we found
[1:00:49] let me jump quickly to it
[1:00:50] what my subject is today there's
[1:00:52] something further
[1:00:54] that is essential that we look at and
[1:00:56] that is that we found that hundreds of
[1:00:58] people if not
[1:00:59] thousands found their individual places
[1:01:04] and begin to work in harmony after the
[1:01:06] temple was built
[1:01:07] they began to work in harmony together
[1:01:10] for the house of god and the reason they
[1:01:12] were working for the house of god
[1:01:13] is that's the place where the word was
[1:01:16] brought forth
[1:01:16] and that's the place his glory came down
[1:01:20] and so now we have people mentioned that
[1:01:23] had offices in the church of singers and
[1:01:25] porters and
[1:01:26] priests and methodisms and if you're
[1:01:29] saying what in the world is mythonyms
[1:01:32] well i'm i'm going to tell you in a few
[1:01:33] minutes methanes and all these different
[1:01:36] ones that just begin to work
[1:01:38] around the house of god and begin to
[1:01:40] give their all
[1:01:42] and most of all they begin to work
[1:01:43] together in harmony you find priests and
[1:01:46] levites and
[1:01:47] porters and singers and all these that
[1:01:50] found their place
[1:01:51] but they said they worked in harmony
[1:01:54] together for the house of god
[1:01:56] it wasn't just they had positions but
[1:01:58] they were working
[1:01:59] in harmony and i want to preach a little
[1:02:02] bit about working
[1:02:04] in coordination together
[1:02:07] when paul speaks about it he speaks
[1:02:09] about different gifts in the church and
[1:02:10] he says in
[1:02:11] first corinthians 12 28 he says and god
[1:02:15] hath set some in the church first
[1:02:17] apostles
[1:02:18] secondary prophets i want you to notice
[1:02:20] here how he breaks some of these things
[1:02:22] down and then
[1:02:23] then as the mythonyms are mentioned in
[1:02:25] the old testament the porters
[1:02:27] which you may not know what those are
[1:02:28] but those aren't the singers or the
[1:02:30] upfront people
[1:02:31] the porters sometimes worked in
[1:02:32] janitorial work the porters worked and
[1:02:34] assisted the priests in different things
[1:02:37] the nifonyms were helpers and workers
[1:02:39] that worked and just
[1:02:40] did about everything and anything in
[1:02:42] between that needed to be done
[1:02:44] i have a lot of nifonyms in my church if
[1:02:46] i didn't have them i couldn't have a
[1:02:47] ministry
[1:02:49] just as important as the priests porters
[1:02:52] and mythologies and so
[1:02:53] but paul know it words it this way and
[1:02:56] god has set
[1:02:57] some in the church notice god has set
[1:03:00] them
[1:03:01] in the church amen amen
[1:03:05] you don't set them in the church you
[1:03:08] don't take them out god sets them in the
[1:03:11] church
[1:03:12] amen when the holy ghost is leading the
[1:03:15] church
[1:03:15] he'll find those and place them
[1:03:18] sometimes be
[1:03:19] before they even get an official
[1:03:20] position they're already working in that
[1:03:22] because they've kind of found their
[1:03:23] place
[1:03:24] naturally by the holy ghost you know
[1:03:26] this isn't a mechanical thing
[1:03:28] this isn't a political thing god's
[1:03:30] church isn't run by politics can you say
[1:03:32] man
[1:03:32] or governments or something like that it
[1:03:34] should be ran by the holy ghost
[1:03:36] under the headship of the pastor can you
[1:03:38] say amen
[1:03:39] amen exactly amen so he says
[1:03:43] god has set some in the church
[1:03:46] first apostles secondary prophets
[1:03:48] thirdly teachers
[1:03:50] after that miracles then gifts of
[1:03:52] healing
[1:03:54] helps just when he says helps it just
[1:03:58] kind of seems like it lost its fervor to
[1:04:00] it you know
[1:04:01] we got apostles and prophets glory be to
[1:04:03] god
[1:04:04] helps just kind of falls off
[1:04:07] it helps it's probably what they thought
[1:04:11] nehemiah's day when he said
[1:04:12] mythonyms
[1:04:15] gifts of healing teachers miracles gifts
[1:04:18] of healing
[1:04:19] governments diversities of tongues helps
[1:04:24] i love it when my dad used to teach on
[1:04:26] this you know just the little word helps
[1:04:28] is just placed right in there
[1:04:31] but it's placed in there by god
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:36] and none of them are more important than
[1:04:37] the other amen
[1:04:39] just helps no big names
[1:04:43] they didn't bring the house down with a
[1:04:45] special singing it
[1:04:46] right right but the church needs helps
[1:04:51] any of you ever remember when jesus
[1:04:53] prayed that the lord of the harvest
[1:04:56] he said praise the lord of hearts
[1:04:58] there's a great harvest going on
[1:04:59] and pray the lord of harvest sins
[1:05:02] preachers
[1:05:03] no prophets no
[1:05:07] laborers in his vineyard
[1:05:11] amen amen
[1:05:15] hallelujah so don't take the helps out
[1:05:19] it's just as important as the rest
[1:05:22] i believe we're going to learn something
[1:05:23] here this morning
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:25] are you with me so now in this day of
[1:05:28] nehemiah thousands came to worship but
[1:05:30] there were others who helped around the
[1:05:32] house of god
[1:05:33] with a goal in mind they had a goal in
[1:05:36] mind now
[1:05:36] you can have a lot of helpers and you
[1:05:38] can have a lot of positions and you can
[1:05:39] have people doing a lot of stuff
[1:05:41] but everybody has to have the same goal
[1:05:44] everybody has to have the reason why
[1:05:46] else it becomes churchianity it becomes
[1:05:48] some uh
[1:05:49] building up a pride of a position you
[1:05:51] have to have the same
[1:05:53] humble goal as everyone in that assembly
[1:05:55] and where did they find their goal
[1:05:57] they found it when they read through the
[1:05:59] scripture and read back in the first
[1:06:00] dedication of the temple
[1:06:02] when everything was in order when the
[1:06:04] 120 trumpeters were there
[1:06:06] all the musicians was in place solomon
[1:06:09] was in place the sacrifices were there
[1:06:11] everything was in order the temple was
[1:06:13] built and the children and all of them
[1:06:14] were reading
[1:06:15] that when solomon come and they brought
[1:06:17] the sacrifice and they entered the
[1:06:19] temple
[1:06:20] the glory of the lord came down
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:25] and it was so powerful such a thing that
[1:06:28] come in that place
[1:06:30] the minister couldn't even stand to
[1:06:32] preach because
[1:06:33] he come on the scene god come down and
[1:06:36] says this has my approval
[1:06:38] i see the harmony i see people working
[1:06:40] together i see the humility
[1:06:43] i see there's one goal and when god's
[1:06:45] seen that he says
[1:06:46] i'm coming down i'm filling this place
[1:06:49] with my glory
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:52] amen and when that's the goal you see
[1:06:55] people come to church
[1:06:57] with all different type of things on
[1:06:58] their mind
[1:07:00] people come to church and that's the
[1:07:01] problem we're not in one mind and one
[1:07:03] accord
[1:07:04] but we've got to get one goal and it's
[1:07:07] not about you being glorified
[1:07:09] it's not about your gift being seen
[1:07:12] we haven't had church unless he comes in
[1:07:15] the scene
[1:07:17] [Applause]
[1:07:22] amen so when you have the golden you can
[1:07:24] look back and see
[1:07:25] the little boy saying these boys on the
[1:07:27] front row here that's what happened
[1:07:29] daddy
[1:07:30] that's what took place that the glory of
[1:07:32] god filled that temple
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] they did all that work they built the
[1:07:36] bricks they put it in place they had the
[1:07:38] porters they had the singers
[1:07:40] they labored for for years to get that
[1:07:42] temple done
[1:07:44] but daddy god came down the glory of
[1:07:48] lord we just had a service a couple
[1:07:49] weeks ago
[1:07:50] and i want to say something about it
[1:07:51] because i'll give glory to the lord i
[1:07:53] come to the end of the service and
[1:07:55] god just stopped me at the service just
[1:07:57] stopped and i had been reading the night
[1:07:59] before
[1:08:00] it really wasn't related completely with
[1:08:01] my subject but i said i got to say this
[1:08:03] i said did you know that brother
[1:08:05] branham's service after service all
[1:08:06] through the cities he visited
[1:08:08] he says he would look and see and he
[1:08:10] would say sometimes he would say
[1:08:12] he said there's a blackness there's a
[1:08:14] darkness over the congregation
[1:08:15] because there were skeptics there
[1:08:17] skeptics
[1:08:18] and actually skeptics hurt the
[1:08:20] atmosphere
[1:08:22] but then if you'll notice even in the
[1:08:24] film deep college to the deep that's one
[1:08:25] place he mentioned this
[1:08:26] he says oh he says this place is
[1:08:29] becoming milky
[1:08:30] he said i can hardly make out anything i
[1:08:32] can't see anything
[1:08:33] he says you're really beginning to
[1:08:35] believe now
[1:08:37] everybody's beginning to believe and the
[1:08:40] place is milky
[1:08:41] and he says hold on here he says
[1:08:44] anything
[1:08:45] could happen
[1:08:49] he said it about 80 times he said that
[1:08:52] milky thing came in the room
[1:08:54] and what was it simply was that there
[1:08:55] was some big no
[1:08:57] the people begin to believe and trust do
[1:09:00] you mean
[1:09:00] do you believe me to be god's prophet if
[1:09:03] you become a skeptic you're going to
[1:09:04] find things wrong
[1:09:06] but do you believe me to be god's
[1:09:07] problem you believe he had to get the
[1:09:09] people to believe
[1:09:10] and it was just simply that it was just
[1:09:12] lay down your skepticism
[1:09:13] and just believe it and when they seen
[1:09:16] this and he kept people going
[1:09:17] and there was enough miracles some
[1:09:18] people are doubting thomas but
[1:09:20] he went to city's friends where that
[1:09:22] milky spirit didn't come in that
[1:09:24] that no he went and he says some cities
[1:09:27] he said
[1:09:27] i don't know if i'll ever be back there
[1:09:29] because of the people's unbelief
[1:09:31] why is he saying i'm wasting my time
[1:09:35] if you're going to sit there as a
[1:09:36] skeptic your whole life it's we're not
[1:09:38] going to see
[1:09:38] it you're wasting time at church
[1:09:41] if god doesn't come down amen amen
[1:09:46] i got to the end of that and i just
[1:09:48] shared it real quickly
[1:09:49] and i says what would happen if you
[1:09:51] would trust me as a minister this
[1:09:52] morning
[1:09:53] see that's the problem today we have a
[1:09:55] lot of lack of trust
[1:09:57] nobody trusts anybody that's why
[1:09:58] people's hearts are locked up
[1:10:01] i'll go to church but i've got my wall
[1:10:02] up if that's the problem
[1:10:04] you got to trust somebody you got to
[1:10:07] trust somebody
[1:10:08] satan has destroyed your trust but you
[1:10:11] got to trust the man of god
[1:10:13] you got to trust that there's true
[1:10:14] ministers you can talk to me all day
[1:10:16] about false ministers and ones who fell
[1:10:18] in sin
[1:10:19] and a false doctrine i can talk only i
[1:10:21] got a number hundred of them to tell you
[1:10:22] about
[1:10:23] but if there's a false there's a real
[1:10:25] servant of god if there's a false dollar
[1:10:27] there's a true dollar
[1:10:30] we gotta trust and i said to the
[1:10:32] congregation how many will trust me
[1:10:33] right now how many
[1:10:34] trust me that i've preached the truth to
[1:10:36] you and they begin to raise i said how
[1:10:37] many needs healing got a brother with
[1:10:39] cancer in the church
[1:10:40] got a couple others that i didn't even
[1:10:41] know what they had how many brother bram
[1:10:43] says
[1:10:44] raise your hand right now because that
[1:10:45] that spirit is here if you raise your
[1:10:47] hand right now
[1:10:48] he pointed to a lady in a wheelchair he
[1:10:50] says if you get out of that wheelchair
[1:10:51] right now i believe you can come up
[1:10:53] and there was mass healings all over the
[1:10:54] congregation well my people begin to
[1:10:56] lift their hands
[1:10:57] people heal the cancer people heal their
[1:10:59] disease
[1:11:00] people heal all kinds of things in a
[1:11:02] moment's time
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:05] had a sister with a growth here on what
[1:11:07] was that on a thyroid under on her neck
[1:11:09] she had it for years and so in that
[1:11:11] service in the morning she claimed her
[1:11:13] healing wasn't till communion that night
[1:11:15] she was praying and worshipping the lord
[1:11:16] she wretched up and she didn't feel
[1:11:18] anything it was gone
[1:11:20] it was gone amen
[1:11:24] this has nothing to do with building up
[1:11:26] my church or anything like that for
[1:11:27] instance that
[1:11:28] if you believe and you trust just simple
[1:11:31] you don't have to do anything
[1:11:32] you have to be just a perfect can you
[1:11:34] say amen just begin to believe
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:42] so many skeptics so many people with
[1:11:45] their walls up yeah
[1:11:47] no wonder we can't get any further
[1:11:52] they seen the glory of god come down in
[1:11:53] solomon's day
[1:11:55] glory of god came down any other reason
[1:11:58] for church
[1:11:59] that is lifted above that is a flawed
[1:12:01] reason
[1:12:03] any other reason for having church then
[1:12:06] him coming down
[1:12:07] is flawed they found their place they
[1:12:11] found their jobs they found their
[1:12:13] positions they found relationship and
[1:12:15] connection to one another
[1:12:17] appointed to a certain job around the
[1:12:20] house of god
[1:12:21] all the jobs were related creating an
[1:12:23] atmosphere in the house of god just lost
[1:12:25] a man
[1:12:26] been with me about 23 years just passed
[1:12:28] away
[1:12:29] and that brother some of this stuff i
[1:12:32] didn't expect to say today but just so
[1:12:34] dear to my heart right now i always told
[1:12:38] him brother gary i said i couldn't do
[1:12:39] what i do
[1:12:41] freely without you and what you do in
[1:12:42] the church you know what he did
[1:12:44] he went through the pews and cleaned the
[1:12:45] church after every service and he locked
[1:12:48] it up for me i told him 20 years ago i
[1:12:49] said i need somebody to lock up because
[1:12:51] i'm tired
[1:12:51] nobody else will lock up he says i'll do
[1:12:53] it for you for 20 some years he went
[1:12:55] through
[1:12:56] cleaned up the church afterwards and
[1:12:58] locked the door
[1:12:59] for 27 years i said brother you
[1:13:01] contributed
[1:13:02] to my ministry and when we receive
[1:13:05] rewards on the other side now i've got
[1:13:07] to go meet him he's already there
[1:13:09] i said you'll stand with me in the
[1:13:10] ministry he had this area wasn't is it
[1:13:12] just the preachers
[1:13:13] can you say man it's who made that
[1:13:16] ministry run smoother
[1:13:17] it's who help who's the helps who's the
[1:13:20] one that's saying we just want to see
[1:13:21] the glory of god come down
[1:13:23] amen
[1:13:26] so they found their place and
[1:13:29] they recognized what they were there for
[1:13:32] the biggest part of is they work
[1:13:33] together in this effort with
[1:13:35] one key that i want to talk about this
[1:13:37] morning
[1:13:38] and brother brahm talks about it quite
[1:13:40] often romans 12
[1:13:41] paul talks about it i'll read the
[1:13:43] scripture first on it
[1:13:45] where he says paul romans 12 and verse 3
[1:13:48] for i say through the grace given unto
[1:13:51] me to every man
[1:13:52] that is among you not to think himself
[1:13:56] of himself more highly than he ought to
[1:13:59] think
[1:14:01] but to think soberly if you're thinking
[1:14:04] more highly of yourself than you ought
[1:14:06] to be thinking
[1:14:06] you're not thinking soberly as a
[1:14:08] christian
[1:14:09] think soberly according as god had dealt
[1:14:12] to every man in the measure of faith for
[1:14:14] as we have mercy have we have many
[1:14:15] members in one body
[1:14:17] and all members have not the same office
[1:14:19] so we being many are one body in christ
[1:14:21] and everyone remembers one of another
[1:14:23] having then gifts differing according to
[1:14:25] the grace that is given to us
[1:14:26] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:14:28] according to the proportion of faith
[1:14:30] or ministry let us wait on our ministry
[1:14:33] or he that teacheth on teaching he that
[1:14:34] exhorted
[1:14:35] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[1:14:38] with simplicity
[1:14:39] he that ruleth with diligence he that
[1:14:41] showeth mercy with cheerfulness
[1:14:43] let love be without hypocrisy
[1:14:46] dissimulation
[1:14:47] let your love be without hypocrisy let
[1:14:50] your love for one another be real
[1:14:53] i said let your love for wanting to be
[1:14:55] real
[1:14:56] not put on not fake not i've got to love
[1:14:59] you because you're sitting beside me
[1:15:01] let your love be real let it be purged
[1:15:05] of hypocrisy
[1:15:07] amen let your love be without
[1:15:09] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[1:15:11] cleave to that which is good
[1:15:12] be kindly affection one to another with
[1:15:14] brotherly love
[1:15:15] in honor preferring one another starts
[1:15:18] the verses with humility
[1:15:19] let no man think the only way for gifts
[1:15:22] to work
[1:15:22] the only way for the church to work with
[1:15:24] god in charge
[1:15:26] is humility let no man think more highly
[1:15:29] of himself
[1:15:31] than he ought to think amen amen amen
[1:15:34] i might as well go ahead and say it that
[1:15:36] with this subject this morning i've been
[1:15:38] so disturbed lately i've been disturbed
[1:15:40] for years but
[1:15:40] so much lately that there are so many
[1:15:43] know-it-alls in the body of christ
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:47] young couples tend to think they know it
[1:15:49] all about raising children
[1:15:52] you know how i know that because i was
[1:15:53] that way i was raised in a great family
[1:15:56] my dad and mom were the best families
[1:15:57] you could be raised in
[1:15:58] i'm proud of that so i guess that
[1:16:00] brought pride that i could raise kids
[1:16:01] found out a few late
[1:16:02] years later and finding out now listen
[1:16:05] there's there's no guarantee of this
[1:16:07] stuff
[1:16:07] it's trusting the lord there's no
[1:16:09] perfect parent can you say man
[1:16:12] but when we're young we don't need to
[1:16:14] ask the older ones because we know it
[1:16:16] all
[1:16:19] amen you can't tell young couples give
[1:16:22] them advice because
[1:16:23] you can't give anybody advice today
[1:16:25] because they already know everything
[1:16:27] they googled it they googled it and now
[1:16:29] they're a professor in every subject
[1:16:31] because they're on the internet every
[1:16:33] day
[1:16:36] praise hello brothers and sisters
[1:16:39] you can't get on me about this i'm on
[1:16:40] vacation
[1:16:44] they know everything already and then
[1:16:47] you get to 54 and as you get older you
[1:16:49] realize
[1:16:50] you really don't know anything
[1:16:53] i didn't know what i was doing and i
[1:16:56] made some damage to my kids
[1:16:57] i've had to make some of that right
[1:16:59] because i didn't paula fontaine i didn't
[1:17:01] do it
[1:17:02] all right i made some damaging things to
[1:17:04] them because
[1:17:05] you know why i did it because i thought
[1:17:06] i knew i was doing right right
[1:17:09] everybody's to know it all today
[1:17:10] everybody has a google knowledge and
[1:17:12] everybody's
[1:17:13] they've got it all they don't have to
[1:17:14] get a degree because they've read up
[1:17:16] enough up on the internet
[1:17:17] they're they're an expert on on the
[1:17:20] covet they're an
[1:17:21] expert on all the subjects
[1:17:26] am i supposed to be wearing a mask right
[1:17:27] now or am i okay
[1:17:29] i didn't even ask if that was the rule
[1:17:33] i'm hot enough please don't make me wear
[1:17:35] a mask
[1:17:37] i'll stay distant friends so don't spit
[1:17:39] on you out there hey i've already had
[1:17:41] the thing man i'm done with it been
[1:17:42] there
[1:17:43] done that got the t-shirt
[1:17:44] [Applause]
[1:17:48] yeah know it alls i got to get off this
[1:17:50] cause i got a lot here
[1:17:51] but listen listen we're missing humility
[1:17:55] in the body and when you've got the body
[1:17:59] with gifts working
[1:18:00] even gets working but you got that thing
[1:18:02] if everybody's thinking more highly of
[1:18:04] themselves than they ought to think
[1:18:06] they're the authority on the matter when
[1:18:08] there's no humility it's not going to
[1:18:09] work effective can't work
[1:18:12] together effectively with it an honor
[1:18:15] brother love preferring one another now
[1:18:16] when brother brahm talks about it in a
[1:18:17] little message called humble thyself
[1:18:19] which is just a little bit after the
[1:18:21] seals that he preached and incidentally
[1:18:23] he preached and humbled thyself he
[1:18:24] refers to the the third poll and refers
[1:18:27] to what it would begin to do
[1:18:29] and it's a it's just a little message
[1:18:30] what even a sermon he just got up and
[1:18:32] talked a little bit about humility
[1:18:33] after another minister spoke but it's
[1:18:36] powerful what he says i'm going to read
[1:18:37] a little bit from it
[1:18:38] and one of the spots in that message he
[1:18:40] says i was i was thinking here
[1:18:42] of that little illustration to back to
[1:18:45] what he said the other minister had
[1:18:46] mentioned
[1:18:47] now we look at this watch and find out
[1:18:49] what time it is
[1:18:50] unless that every instrument in that
[1:18:53] watch is coordinating
[1:18:55] one with the other will never know the
[1:18:57] correct time
[1:18:58] right is that right and that
[1:19:02] takes all of us together if we want to
[1:19:05] see the third pole really do something
[1:19:08] for god it's coordination with every one
[1:19:11] of us together
[1:19:13] to humble ourselves before god and
[1:19:17] confess
[1:19:17] our wrongs and pray and believe god for
[1:19:20] these things
[1:19:22] and you all been taught right you know
[1:19:24] the 1963 when the seals were open
[1:19:26] the third poll not the first and second
[1:19:28] but now we come into the phase of the
[1:19:29] third poll
[1:19:30] that thing was launched that thing began
[1:19:32] but it was only in its early stages of
[1:19:34] the opening of the word
[1:19:35] what it would do in the people was still
[1:19:37] to come
[1:19:39] and so now as i said he begins to talk
[1:19:42] about it
[1:19:42] and he's talking about humble thyself if
[1:19:45] we really want to see
[1:19:46] the third pole do something among us
[1:19:50] we work in coordination together
[1:19:53] amen like the watch and he
[1:19:56] elaborates on this it says every uh
[1:19:58] coordinating part
[1:20:00] inside has to be working so he points us
[1:20:03] to something to me it's very wonderful
[1:20:05] in this season of the third poll being
[1:20:07] opened up
[1:20:09] for those of you who don't know the the
[1:20:11] third poll is the three parts of the
[1:20:12] ministry of the last days
[1:20:14] three parts of jesus ministry you've
[1:20:16] been taught those that are here but if
[1:20:17] you're a visitor
[1:20:18] there were three main parts of jesus
[1:20:20] ministry the first poll the healings
[1:20:22] the second poll discerning the people's
[1:20:24] hearts like the woman at the well
[1:20:25] and the third poll when he began to open
[1:20:27] the word to his disciples
[1:20:29] we've had that same transition in the
[1:20:31] last days we come to the final part
[1:20:33] it's no public show but yet it's here
[1:20:36] the third pool is here
[1:20:37] it arrived at the opening of the word
[1:20:39] just like in nehemiah's day
[1:20:40] but you see now they come to the opening
[1:20:42] of the word but see now it's
[1:20:44] it arrived but we're looking for it to
[1:20:47] do something
[1:20:47] it points us to working together in
[1:20:50] humility
[1:20:51] confession prayer simple belief all the
[1:20:54] elements are there
[1:20:55] but the body must be working together
[1:20:58] the potentials of the third pole
[1:21:00] are not in a book or in a tape or in
[1:21:03] a church building or in the bible it's
[1:21:06] here
[1:21:07] it needs us working together to see it
[1:21:09] manifest more in our midst
[1:21:11] it is in the body now it's the holy
[1:21:13] spirit in
[1:21:14] us the body and it's important
[1:21:18] don't distance yourself away from the
[1:21:20] body of christ
[1:21:23] you know people are doing that at the
[1:21:25] worst time they could do it
[1:21:28] we're almost there people leaving this
[1:21:31] message
[1:21:32] now we're at the climax this is
[1:21:36] it man this is the wrap-up
[1:21:39] what are you doing if you're listening
[1:21:41] on the internet what are you doing
[1:21:43] wake up because this is the hour this is
[1:21:45] the time
[1:21:47] 50 60 years after this open word came to
[1:21:49] us and now this bride is coming to a
[1:21:51] place
[1:21:52] we're gonna see the final vindication of
[1:21:54] this thing
[1:21:56] hallelujah don't distance yourself away
[1:22:01] so when he refers to a watch then we
[1:22:03] realize that
[1:22:04] you know i read up a little bit on this
[1:22:06] there's a like a hundred
[1:22:08] in a swiss watch which is a pretty
[1:22:10] expensive watch there's about 130
[1:22:12] to 150 moving and non-moving parts to a
[1:22:16] switch
[1:22:16] watch in a rolex watch which i don't
[1:22:19] know if anybody has one here today
[1:22:21] i certainly don't have one very
[1:22:23] expensive watch
[1:22:24] rolex one of my one of my friends has
[1:22:26] one and so that's why i stay his friend
[1:22:28] maybe he'll hand it down to me
[1:22:32] a rolex has a hundred and seventy now
[1:22:34] you imagine this little watch
[1:22:36] 175 to 200 working
[1:22:39] and non-working parts you wonder why
[1:22:41] brother branham referred to this because
[1:22:43] it's just this little thing
[1:22:45] and yet so many moving and unmoving
[1:22:47] parts in it
[1:22:48] and if they didn't work in coordination
[1:22:50] connected together we couldn't tell the
[1:22:52] time
[1:22:54] what a great what a great word picture
[1:22:57] the prophet gave us
[1:22:59] it's a little just a little just small
[1:23:01] can you say man
[1:23:02] just my wife bought me a watch here i
[1:23:05] don't know uh
[1:23:06] 20 years ago yes and it was a bolovin
[1:23:09] watch and it was it was 300
[1:23:12] i thought it was the richest man in the
[1:23:13] world she bought me that watch i wanted
[1:23:14] a nice gold watch
[1:23:16] and a beautiful watch bolvin so i was
[1:23:18] down here one of my vacations
[1:23:20] and i was driving down uh in between
[1:23:23] west palm here in miami
[1:23:24] and there's this little watch place that
[1:23:26] had signs on the door i said you know
[1:23:28] what i'd like to upgrade to something
[1:23:29] different not
[1:23:30] i could bring this in and i could you
[1:23:32] know let me just say this before i tell
[1:23:33] this little story
[1:23:34] anybody ever walked into a place and you
[1:23:37] realize after a few minutes
[1:23:38] you didn't belong in there
[1:23:43] sister alan a few honest people
[1:23:46] you thought you were something and then
[1:23:48] you walked into this place and
[1:23:49] said you ain't nothing you ain't got
[1:23:52] squat
[1:23:54] i thought i was big time with a 300
[1:23:56] watch and i said
[1:23:57] i'm gonna go in and they're gonna be so
[1:23:58] happy i'm gonna trade this thing and
[1:24:00] upgrade to something
[1:24:01] nicer and so i walked through the store
[1:24:03] i said that's nice that's
[1:24:04] i did notice the prices were a bit high
[1:24:07] but i had a 300
[1:24:08] watch i had a good trade-in you know and
[1:24:10] so finally i guess says
[1:24:11] i got this watch if you want to look at
[1:24:13] it it's a boulevard
[1:24:15] she goes what is it
[1:24:18] oh my gosh what brand is that
[1:24:22] i said i'd like to trade it in and maybe
[1:24:23] get something nicer and
[1:24:25] i bought it for 300 you know 20 years
[1:24:27] ago and maybe i could do something and
[1:24:29] she said
[1:24:30] sir our our used watches traded our used
[1:24:33] watches start
[1:24:34] at fifteen thousand start
[1:24:39] praise the lord i said have a good day
[1:24:42] ma'am and i walk back
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:51] i was driving a rental car that was a
[1:24:53] convertible
[1:24:56] but it didn't do any good she didn't
[1:24:58] look at that at all
[1:25:01] but some of these expensive watches
[1:25:03] friends it's the unseen parts
[1:25:06] all of those parts besides the what's on
[1:25:09] the front the
[1:25:10] the what the the what do they call them
[1:25:11] though
[1:25:13] huh the hands every other part is
[1:25:16] invisible
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:19] i'm telling you in a local body what
[1:25:21] happens behind the scenes and what
[1:25:23] happens in prayer
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:34] and the reason that our sister could
[1:25:35] come and sing this morning and be such a
[1:25:37] blessing
[1:25:38] be anointed in all this that wouldn't
[1:25:40] happen even unless some other parts have
[1:25:42] been taking place in praying
[1:25:43] and getting their hearts ready for that
[1:25:45] to take place it all works in
[1:25:47] coordination together
[1:25:50] and if the devil is setting you sitting
[1:25:52] there this morning that you're not apart
[1:25:54] the devil is talking to you and you need
[1:25:56] to quit having your wall up
[1:25:58] and you just say what can i do for the
[1:26:00] kingdom of god
[1:26:01] where is my place in his kingdom
[1:26:05] because there's no big eyes or little
[1:26:07] used there's no one with great positions
[1:26:09] can you say man
[1:26:10] you are important you are part of the
[1:26:13] body of christ
[1:26:14] and we can grow and we can see more
[1:26:16] lives changed we can see our numbers
[1:26:18] grow
[1:26:18] we can see all these things and the
[1:26:20] glory of god most of all
[1:26:22] coming down see when that happens
[1:26:25] friends
[1:26:25] if a visitor comes in that does all the
[1:26:28] explaining can you say man
[1:26:30] that's the thing that speaks to people
[1:26:32] that's the thing that'll make
[1:26:33] some people come back amen can you say
[1:26:36] praise the lord
[1:26:38] oh my working together in coordination
[1:26:41] and god he goes on to say god can only
[1:26:43] operate as we let him operate
[1:26:45] you know people want power and really
[1:26:47] they really don't know what power is
[1:26:48] they really don't know what goes with
[1:26:51] the power
[1:26:52] the way up is down always if you want
[1:26:54] power
[1:26:55] see how humble you can get just get away
[1:26:57] from your worldly thinking
[1:26:59] humble yourself before god and then
[1:27:01] you've got more power than the man that
[1:27:02] runs all over the building and makes a
[1:27:04] lot of big noise
[1:27:06] see because you've been able to conquer
[1:27:08] yourself and commit yourself to christ
[1:27:10] you see to humble yourself
[1:27:12] before him that's really power you show
[1:27:14] me a church
[1:27:15] that's humble real humble and not
[1:27:17] arrogant a church just sweet
[1:27:19] humble church i'll show you a church
[1:27:21] that has the favor
[1:27:22] and the power of god in it that's right
[1:27:24] that's the thing that takes humility
[1:27:26] humbling ourselves before god letting
[1:27:28] god just work through
[1:27:30] us don't have to make a lot of noise
[1:27:32] sometimes as the farmer said
[1:27:33] he went out to the field with his wagon
[1:27:35] and every time he hit a bump it rattled
[1:27:36] and went on
[1:27:37] but when he come back he hit the same
[1:27:39] bump and didn't make no noise at all
[1:27:41] because
[1:27:42] because it was loaded with good things
[1:27:45] so i think that's just about right
[1:27:47] that we get filled up with good things
[1:27:49] of god that the fruit of the spirit
[1:27:51] might be known through us
[1:27:53] as he referred so much to the first
[1:27:55] things have not charity it's nothing
[1:27:57] it profiteth me nothing and you've got
[1:27:59] to look this out and
[1:28:00] come sweet before the lord and i've
[1:28:02] always found that a man that humbles
[1:28:04] himself
[1:28:05] is the man that god exalts when you take
[1:28:07] a person
[1:28:08] with his chest out and knows everything
[1:28:12] and you can't tell him nothing
[1:28:15] amen and he is arrogant
[1:28:18] see you you're talking about people out
[1:28:20] there no no no i'm talking about
[1:28:21] in-message churches
[1:28:22] i've got some of them in my church you
[1:28:24] can't tell them nothing
[1:28:26] i don't even know why they come
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:30] because they get their high taken off
[1:28:32] about every service
[1:28:33] and they keep coming they're not
[1:28:36] yielding they're not surrendering
[1:28:37] and you couldn't ever personally counsel
[1:28:39] them and correct them and exhort them
[1:28:41] as the bible said we should be able to
[1:28:43] do exhort one another is a slight rebuke
[1:28:47] but you don't dare do that today oh boy
[1:28:50] i'm on my subject i better watch what
[1:28:52] i'm saying
[1:28:52] [Applause]
[1:28:54] people need to read their bibles how the
[1:28:56] body works
[1:28:57] but we're still got our wall up we don't
[1:28:59] dare go and correct somebody today
[1:29:02] it's the culture that we live in
[1:29:05] let me be me and nobody says nothing to
[1:29:08] me that's not the body of christ
[1:29:14] you can say amen but just remember when
[1:29:16] somebody comes to you to say something
[1:29:17] to you
[1:29:19] that's when you feel it a little bit
[1:29:22] amen you know my wife always says this
[1:29:25] is submission and we're counseling
[1:29:27] sisters and couples and things and
[1:29:28] submission comes in actually when you
[1:29:30] disagree with
[1:29:32] what the head is going to do
[1:29:35] it's not really submission when you
[1:29:37] agree with it
[1:29:39] oh boy oh man i'll tell you
[1:29:44] there's a is that a back door right
[1:29:45] there so i can get out of here
[1:29:49] it's not a thank you for telling me it's
[1:29:52] a closet and i'd be caught in that
[1:29:53] closet
[1:29:58] people don't we're in a culture watch
[1:30:00] the young people coming up
[1:30:02] study the generations generation x
[1:30:04] generation y
[1:30:06] instead of the employers that are having
[1:30:08] trouble because you can't tell those
[1:30:10] employees nothing
[1:30:14] that does not work in the house of god
[1:30:18] we need submission pure submission
[1:30:21] the right kind we don't need
[1:30:22] dictatorship
[1:30:25] and we don't need rebellion we don't
[1:30:28] need the nicolaitan spirit
[1:30:30] and we don't need the jezebels did you
[1:30:33] notice both of those things are brought
[1:30:35] out in the church ages
[1:30:36] a nicolaitan spirit and a jezebel spirit
[1:30:42] the nicolaitan is when the the headship
[1:30:45] gets out of order
[1:30:46] and dictates to the people without the
[1:30:48] holy ghost the jezebel spirits he won't
[1:30:50] submit
[1:30:52] we want to purge that out of our midst
[1:30:55] no need to be that way can you say amen
[1:30:58] so this watch is what we're
[1:31:00] looking at and humble in ourselves and
[1:31:02] he says we must
[1:31:03] that's right every piece of this watch
[1:31:05] church must be together and you must
[1:31:07] keep your part of it
[1:31:08] so we see what time we're living in we
[1:31:10] may be closer than we think
[1:31:12] it's all about humility working in
[1:31:14] coordination together in true humility
[1:31:16] is the key i won't be much longer i want
[1:31:18] to jump to a part here in a minute
[1:31:25] so we must work together
[1:31:31] besides the world falling apart we have
[1:31:34] an enemy working overtime attacking the
[1:31:36] message
[1:31:38] attacking the people who believe it
[1:31:39] right making people think that it's
[1:31:41] these people
[1:31:42] that we withdraw from and not worldly
[1:31:44] people
[1:31:45] that's the message it's preachers and
[1:31:47] its people are the problem there
[1:31:49] the satan is making people's eyes that
[1:31:50] the message is the problem
[1:31:52] the people in the message are the
[1:31:53] problem you young people listen to me
[1:31:56] the voices of the enemy are on the
[1:31:57] internet every day to teach you
[1:31:59] that the real problem must be the
[1:32:01] message or the people of the message and
[1:32:03] i'm here to say
[1:32:04] that's the biggest one of the biggest
[1:32:05] lies satan can tell you
[1:32:07] god sent a message to a prophet and got
[1:32:09] people believing it
[1:32:10] i don't care if you think they're weak
[1:32:12] or whatever they are there's holy ghost
[1:32:14] filled people there
[1:32:15] and if you turn to chum and hang out
[1:32:18] with worldly people
[1:32:19] and hang out with everybody else and
[1:32:21] shun the real people of god you're going
[1:32:23] to pay for that amen
[1:32:27] amen you take some of our groups and
[1:32:31] some of the people you take us at our
[1:32:32] very worst
[1:32:33] i'd rather have my kids hanging around a
[1:32:35] church like this
[1:32:37] amen than some of the atmospheres out
[1:32:39] there
[1:32:40] amen amen you take the very worst of
[1:32:44] things that happen in the church things
[1:32:45] happen people in sin or people treat one
[1:32:48] another wrong
[1:32:50] people come up walk up and give you the
[1:32:52] elevator look looking you over
[1:32:55] that's right come on now looking at
[1:32:59] everything you're wearing
[1:33:02] judge you by that first it happens all
[1:33:04] the time can you say man
[1:33:06] but i'm telling the young people don't
[1:33:08] you let satan talk to you with that
[1:33:10] because you you might have the elevator
[1:33:12] look at walmart
[1:33:16] you might get more at walmart because of
[1:33:18] the way you look
[1:33:21] that's right a bunch of hypocrites at
[1:33:23] that message church message message
[1:33:24] messages and the devil gives the message
[1:33:26] a bad name a bunch of hypocrites there
[1:33:28] there's hypocrites at walmart
[1:33:34] amen you take the very worst i told
[1:33:37] parents i said
[1:33:38] our youth group we got a youth group for
[1:33:40] some 28 years we every friday night we
[1:33:43] met with youth me and my wife had them
[1:33:45] we want to give them a place to go
[1:33:47] shared the word with them we had a good
[1:33:48] time had some fun every friday night for
[1:33:50] some 20 years
[1:33:51] now some other brothers take care of it
[1:33:53] for me
[1:33:54] give the other youth a place to go they
[1:33:57] had a couple pairs say
[1:33:58] i don't know what your teachers are
[1:33:59] teaching and stuff like that and then
[1:34:00] let them go
[1:34:01] let them go be with a bunch of other
[1:34:03] youth groups
[1:34:05] i said i set this youth group above any
[1:34:07] of that i trusted above
[1:34:09] any of it as opposed to being out there
[1:34:12] take us at our very worst i still think
[1:34:16] it's a good atmosphere to have your
[1:34:17] family in
[1:34:19] i'm talking about working together
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:25] praise the lord
[1:34:43] humility says i'll go the way of the
[1:34:46] cross
[1:34:48] dying to myself for the sake of christ
[1:34:50] and for the sake of the whole body
[1:34:52] humility says i'm no better than anyone
[1:34:54] here
[1:34:56] humility says i put my prayers and my
[1:34:58] gifts in with the rest
[1:35:00] mine is no better i'm no better and if
[1:35:02] someone excels in their gift beyond me
[1:35:05] and god makes a gift more visible than
[1:35:07] mine then
[1:35:08] when i praise the lord for that and i
[1:35:10] pray for that
[1:35:11] that it will be excelled even more
[1:35:13] humility before god and one another is
[1:35:15] the true
[1:35:16] prerequisite to his glory coming down i
[1:35:19] believe that with all my heart
[1:35:20] it says in philippians 2 if there be any
[1:35:22] a consolation in christ
[1:35:24] if any comfort of love philippians 2
[1:35:26] verse 1
[1:35:27] if any comfort of love have any
[1:35:28] fellowship with the spirit if any bowels
[1:35:30] and mercies
[1:35:31] fulfill ye my joy that you may be
[1:35:33] like-minded having the same love being
[1:35:35] one
[1:35:36] of one accord one mind let nothing be
[1:35:39] done through strife
[1:35:41] or vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[1:35:44] that each esteem others better than
[1:35:46] themselves
[1:35:48] look not everyone on his own things but
[1:35:50] every man also on the things of others
[1:35:52] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:35:54] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[1:35:56] god
[1:35:56] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:35:58] god but made himself of no reputation
[1:36:02] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:36:04] was made in the likeness of men
[1:36:05] and being found in the fashion as a man
[1:36:08] he humbled himself
[1:36:10] christ humbled himself
[1:36:14] and we don't have to christ humbled
[1:36:16] himself
[1:36:19] not robbery to be equal with god and yet
[1:36:22] he humbled himself as a servant
[1:36:25] he made himself a note that's why you
[1:36:27] find jesus saying don't tell any man
[1:36:28] about this don't tell man
[1:36:29] you got healed don't tell them about
[1:36:31] that that doesn't sound like a lot of
[1:36:32] radio preachers
[1:36:33] they blasted around the world if they
[1:36:35] have a healing jesus said don't tell
[1:36:37] anybody about
[1:36:38] it why because jesus wasn't trying to do
[1:36:41] his marketing
[1:36:42] to build up his gift we got a great gift
[1:36:45] here we got to do some more marketing we
[1:36:46] got to get it built around the world
[1:36:48] that's not the body of christ just do
[1:36:51] what you do worship the lord serve the
[1:36:52] lord
[1:36:53] and he'll build it up the way that he
[1:36:54] wants to
[1:36:56] he'll fill these seats with people that
[1:36:58] are hungry he'll give you a new building
[1:37:01] just work together in communication and
[1:37:03] coordination and
[1:37:04] love among one another you watch
[1:37:07] something come out of that
[1:37:09] humble yourself can you say man he made
[1:37:12] himself of no reputation
[1:37:13] somebody's saying the other day you need
[1:37:15] to do this promotion you need to promote
[1:37:16] this you need to promote that
[1:37:18] i said no i want to be less known i
[1:37:20] don't want to be more known
[1:37:21] i want my name to be less known i just
[1:37:24] want to write my little songs and preach
[1:37:26] the gospel
[1:37:27] i don't need my name on any kind of
[1:37:29] lights
[1:37:31] i'm going jesus path here he
[1:37:34] intentionally made himself
[1:37:36] of no reputation amen amen
[1:37:41] praise the lord amen
[1:37:46] amen so many things christ humbled
[1:37:49] himself to the cross
[1:37:50] the way of the cross unselfishness it's
[1:37:52] all about others before himself you get
[1:37:54] that you understand that
[1:37:55] can you say amen i'm skipping away down
[1:37:57] here so i can find this spot that i want
[1:37:59] to close

[1:38:03] the porters
[1:38:04] the singers all through themselves into
[1:38:08] the temple threw themselves into it to
[1:38:10] see god's glory come down

[1:38:15] the nithinims methanes means the given
[1:38:18] ones
[1:38:19] methanes mean the given ones the
[1:38:22] nithinines were set up by david and ezra
[1:38:26] as if you want the reference as uh
[1:38:28] chapter 20 and verse 8
[1:38:30] david set up the nithyanims as a
[1:38:32] position actually
[1:38:34] and they needed them around the temple
[1:38:36] they needed them around
[1:38:37] as helpers the levites they were service
[1:38:40] to the levites
[1:38:41] they were assisting the levites in their
[1:38:43] job that they did
[1:38:44] doing the in between stuff so the
[1:38:46] levites could do their job
[1:38:47] you got some brothers and sisters here

[1:39:59] get a home down here get a membership in
[1:40:02] this church
[1:40:03] [Applause]
[1:40:04] this church
[1:40:08] and spend time with my granddaughter
[1:40:13] you know how i'm getting to that place
[1:40:15] after 33 years
[1:40:17] pastoring you know i'm getting that
[1:40:19] place because god has
[1:40:21] supplied methanes
[1:40:24] helpers servants
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:29] hallelujah so
[1:40:33] when paul
[1:40:36] when paul gets into this i want you to
[1:40:40] turn here and well
[1:40:40] i promise we'll close on this first
[1:40:43] corinthians chapter 12.
[1:40:46] when paul gets into this subject
[1:40:50] of the body or in the subject of
[1:40:53] the holy ghost and how it's working
[1:40:55] through gifts because we know first
[1:40:56] corinthians he deals with the gifts
[1:41:00] talks a lot about it the diversities of
[1:41:03] gifts
[1:41:04] and so when he's talking about gifts and
[1:41:05] i imagine your pastor's taught on this
[1:41:08] uh on the gifts and your evening of
[1:41:10] tearing for the lord
[1:41:12] uh when he speaks about it then
[1:41:16] he goes into this word picture of a
[1:41:18] natural body
[1:41:20] okay he feels to use a word picture of
[1:41:22] the natural body and how that works
[1:41:24] together
[1:41:25] and how some points about the body picks
[1:41:28] it up in verse 12 where he says
[1:41:29] as the body is one and half many members
[1:41:31] and all the members of that
[1:41:32] one body being many are one body so also
[1:41:35] is christ
[1:41:36] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:41:38] into one body
[1:41:39] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[1:41:41] we bond or free and have been all made
[1:41:43] to drink of one spirit
[1:41:45] for the body is one member but many
[1:41:48] excuse me the body is not one member but
[1:41:49] many
[1:41:50] if the foot shall say because i am not
[1:41:52] the hand i am not of the body is
[1:41:54] therefore not of the body
[1:41:56] if the ear shall say because i am not
[1:41:58] the eye i am not of the body
[1:42:00] is it therefore not of the body if the
[1:42:02] whole body were an eye where were the
[1:42:04] hearing if the whole body were hearing
[1:42:05] where were the smelling
[1:42:06] but now god hath set the members every
[1:42:09] one of them in the body
[1:42:11] as it hath pleased him
[1:42:14] i like god god has said amen
[1:42:18] so my dad used to say he might even said
[1:42:20] it here in your church i don't know he
[1:42:21] says
[1:42:22] he says so you didn't put me in and you
[1:42:24] can't kick me out
[1:42:28] right god has set some members in the
[1:42:31] body and some of them
[1:42:32] you're wondering why did god set them in
[1:42:36] the body
[1:42:37] well that ain't none of your business
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:41] i don't know why god set them in the
[1:42:42] body i never understand that
[1:42:45] maybe they thinking the same thing about
[1:42:46] you why'd god
[1:42:48] set you in this body
[1:42:53] and if the foot shall say excuse me if
[1:42:55] the whole
[1:42:56] but now god has set some members so you
[1:42:59] know you know these scriptures okay so
[1:43:00] here
[1:43:01] paul brings up the word picture of a
[1:43:03] body
[1:43:05] and that we should never be saying i
[1:43:10] have no need of you
[1:43:13] and the reason he's saying that the
[1:43:14] reason paul's preaching this about a
[1:43:16] body
[1:43:17] is because it's pretty stupid to think
[1:43:20] that one of your natural body members
[1:43:22] could say that it's almost
[1:43:24] it's impossible one of your natural
[1:43:26] bodies like your hand
[1:43:28] couldn't say to another i don't need you
[1:43:31] because we need everything here
[1:43:34] there's a couple parts they take out
[1:43:36] that you can get by without
[1:43:38] right right but most of it it needs the
[1:43:41] body can you say man
[1:43:42] and so this whole thing where is this
[1:43:44] whole idea i have no need of you it's
[1:43:47] stupid
[1:43:47] that the body could think that but if
[1:43:49] it's true of the natural body it has to
[1:43:51] be true
[1:43:52] of this body of christ you can never
[1:43:55] have the pride to say to anyone
[1:43:57] i have no need of you you actually
[1:44:00] should be saying in humility
[1:44:02] i have need of you i need you
[1:44:06] some people today they come to church
[1:44:08] and they don't need anybody at church
[1:44:10] they don't need anybody there they need
[1:44:12] to hear their sermon and go home i don't
[1:44:14] need it i just need my family my family
[1:44:16] my family
[1:44:16] well some of your family may fail you
[1:44:18] too someday
[1:44:21] i don't need anybody at that church i
[1:44:23] just need my family
[1:44:25] my mama my papa my uncle i just need
[1:44:28] that and you know
[1:44:28] people today are clinging to family even
[1:44:31] unsaved family they cling to them
[1:44:33] because it's emotional it's family
[1:44:35] but they won't give their heart to the
[1:44:37] church they won't give their heart to
[1:44:38] the body of christ
[1:44:40] i'm saying you're setting yourself up
[1:44:42] for failure there's nothing against
[1:44:44] family families family understand that
[1:44:46] but don't you
[1:44:46] ever set them above the body of christ
[1:44:50] you are royalty this is the family of
[1:44:52] god
[1:44:53] this is your true family
[1:44:58] amen is anybody getting something out of
[1:45:00] this this morning
[1:45:01] are you listening to do you trust me
[1:45:05] this will help you if you just believe
[1:45:07] me and trust me and believe it
[1:45:08] this will help this church it will help
[1:45:10] you individually to come out of your
[1:45:12] shell to come out of your walls you got
[1:45:14] up
[1:45:16] we tend to default to our family members
[1:45:19] and mommy and daddy in default
[1:45:21] because in this age we don't trust
[1:45:22] anybody we don't trust the church we
[1:45:24] don't protect the people at church
[1:45:25] so the family's only one we can really
[1:45:27] trust don't be so sure
[1:45:31] they could turn on you just like that
[1:45:34] but i'll love them anyway because
[1:45:36] they're family
[1:45:36] how come you don't do that with the body
[1:45:38] of christ
[1:45:40] amen so
[1:45:44] paul says this because what he's dealing
[1:45:46] with this is i have no need of you
[1:45:48] because some carnal person back then
[1:45:51] in the body of christ would actually say
[1:45:54] something like that or
[1:45:55] show the actions i have no need of you
[1:45:58] paul must be saying it for a reason it
[1:45:59] must been people had that attitude
[1:46:01] i don't need you i like paul's preaching
[1:46:04] i'll come to this message church but i
[1:46:06] don't need you i don't need you
[1:46:10] i only need me
[1:46:17] somebody must have been saying that i
[1:46:18] just want to come to a church i've had
[1:46:20] them say
[1:46:20] i just i've been through so much i just
[1:46:22] want to come to a church
[1:46:24] but i don't need anybody in that church
[1:46:26] i just want to come will you got me come
[1:46:28] by the paul and i usually say hey just
[1:46:30] come let the
[1:46:31] let the presence of the lord do
[1:46:32] something for you but i'm always
[1:46:33] thinking my mind
[1:46:34] how can you accept the lord and not
[1:46:36] accept where the lord's living right now
[1:46:41] your hurts and pains are so bad that
[1:46:43] you're
[1:46:44] blocking out one of the most important
[1:46:46] things that could be a benefit
[1:46:48] to your healing
[1:46:52] amen oh friends say i just want my
[1:46:55] healing from the lord while the lord is
[1:46:56] in the body
[1:46:58] two sundays ago a sister she had
[1:47:00] migraine headaches for about a week
[1:47:02] constant
[1:47:03] and in that same service that same
[1:47:04] communion service she said sister would
[1:47:06] you lay hands her sister lay hands on
[1:47:08] her
[1:47:08] she's never had a migraine since just
[1:47:10] the sister of the church don't even she
[1:47:11] didn't say her name she laid her hands
[1:47:13] on that sister
[1:47:14] migraines were gone amen so i'm making
[1:47:17] the point
[1:47:18] i'm making the point i need the lord but
[1:47:20] i don't need anybody
[1:47:22] the lord's in his people
[1:47:25] amen amen you know the reason that paul
[1:47:28] brought this up
[1:47:30] is because there's two complexes
[1:47:33] how many believe you need one another
[1:47:38] yes you do you may say you don't need
[1:47:40] anybody but you need the body of christ
[1:47:44] you'd be best to form your friendships
[1:47:45] more out of the body of christ anywhere
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:48] else
[1:47:56] you know anybody got been married a long
[1:47:58] time and you realize you start to need
[1:48:00] one another
[1:48:01] more and more 54 years old
[1:48:05] you finish each other's sentences your
[1:48:08] mind goes and you don't have a clue what
[1:48:10] to finish the sentence and your wife
[1:48:12] finishes it for you
[1:48:22] sometimes we don't want to admit it but
[1:48:24] we need each other
[1:48:26] we were in georgia for a convention
[1:48:28] daniel gisenander's last september
[1:48:30] we got this motel we're getting ready
[1:48:31] for church we come in early getting
[1:48:32] ready for church there's two motels
[1:48:34] beside one another
[1:48:35] and i i was in room we were in the room
[1:48:38] 340. we got set up in the room i wanted
[1:48:39] to study
[1:48:40] she wants to get something to eat across
[1:48:42] the street and she's going to bring it
[1:48:43] back to her
[1:48:43] she brings it back but she
[1:48:47] she comes back and she calls me from
[1:48:50] room 340 she says where are you at i'm
[1:48:52] in the room i said no hon i'm in the
[1:48:54] room i'm in 3 40.
[1:48:56] she says no you're not i'm in 3 40.
[1:49:00] i said huh i can tell you right now i'm
[1:49:02] looking at the phone and the door and it
[1:49:04] says 340.
[1:49:05] the same room we checked in in with my
[1:49:07] luggage in front of me
[1:49:08] and she starts to look around this room
[1:49:11] it's 3 40 but there ain't no luggage in
[1:49:12] it
[1:49:16] and she had walked to the right
[1:49:18] [Laughter]
[1:49:21] i'm glad she's in the nursery right now
[1:49:24] she had walked from that restaurant not
[1:49:26] even it went into the other motel
[1:49:28] walked upstairs and that room happened
[1:49:30] to be open walked into 340 in the other
[1:49:32] motel completely
[1:49:35] and that's why i said honey you need me
[1:49:37] don't you you're getting the place of
[1:49:38] life
[1:49:38] you need me in life
[1:49:42] it's not just that i need you you need
[1:49:45] me honey
[1:49:47] sweetie pie we're getting the place we
[1:49:50] need each other
[1:49:51] you'd be lost without me over there in
[1:49:52] that motel
[1:49:55] i said bring me my food over here i'm
[1:49:57] over here in 3 40.
[1:50:02] amen get rid of these lines that we
[1:50:06] don't need the body of christ we don't
[1:50:08] need that person in the body of christ
[1:50:10] if they're in the body you need them
[1:50:13] every joint supplieth to one another
[1:50:16] it increases to the edification of the
[1:50:18] church
[1:50:19] the reason that paul talked about this
[1:50:21] is because there's two main complexes in
[1:50:24] people
[1:50:24] and if i had another knight i would talk
[1:50:26] about complexes complexes
[1:50:29] that's what happens to you is your
[1:50:30] complexes
[1:50:32] and paul is addressing deep hindrances
[1:50:35] in the church and there's two main
[1:50:36] things
[1:50:37] there's a group that might say that in
[1:50:40] complexes now
[1:50:41] i'm i'm not happy with me i want to be
[1:50:44] you that's one complex that's an
[1:50:47] inferiority complex
[1:50:50] i'm not happy with how god made me so i
[1:50:52] want to be you that's why paul says
[1:50:54] the foot can't say to the hand i don't
[1:50:56] want to be the foot
[1:50:58] i want to be the hand that's an
[1:51:01] inferiority complex
[1:51:02] you're not happy with what god gave you
[1:51:04] to do and how he made you
[1:51:07] that's an inferiority coming complexes
[1:51:09] don't worry at work in the body of
[1:51:10] christ
[1:51:13] but there's another one that paul
[1:51:14] mentions not an inferiority complex
[1:51:18] but the second one that says i'm
[1:51:20] perfectly happy with me
[1:51:23] and i don't need you amen
[1:51:27] if the foot shall save the hand i have
[1:51:28] no need of you
[1:51:30] so one of them is an inferiority complex
[1:51:33] the next one is a
[1:51:34] superiority complex and they're both
[1:51:38] just as bad
[1:51:41] one says i'm totally happy with myself i
[1:51:43] don't need nobody
[1:51:45] i don't need anybody in my life
[1:51:47] especially the body of christ
[1:51:49] and the other one says i'm not happy
[1:51:51] with myself
[1:51:53] never been happy with myself i want to
[1:51:55] be everybody
[1:51:56] else i don't want to be a lay member i
[1:51:58] want to be the preacher
[1:52:00] i want to be the deacon why can't i sing
[1:52:03] a special
[1:52:06] you better pray and find your place
[1:52:11] you want to get up and sing every
[1:52:12] service and the lord may have you back
[1:52:14] there cleaning them toilets
[1:52:20] i pray that he doesn't have you doing
[1:52:21] that but you've got to find out
[1:52:23] what god wants you to do
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:26] amen praise the lord amen i did a study
[1:52:29] on this one time
[1:52:31] in complexes and i feel like that's what
[1:52:33] paul was talking about the superiority
[1:52:35] complex that says
[1:52:37] i am completely content
[1:52:40] with myself and i don't need anybody
[1:52:42] else and inferior says
[1:52:44] i'm not content with myself i'm not
[1:52:45] settled with myself
[1:52:47] and i want to be someone else that's
[1:52:49] where you get the social media
[1:52:51] girls and guys copying what everybody
[1:52:54] else is doing
[1:52:56] dressing superstars sports stars
[1:53:00] you haven't found your place in christ
[1:53:02] yet because you've got to be everybody
[1:53:03] else except what god made you
[1:53:06] it's time to grow up in the lord and
[1:53:07] find your place this is who i
[1:53:09] am this is what i do this is my walk
[1:53:12] with christ
[1:53:12] i am confident in this it's what god
[1:53:15] gave me to do
[1:53:18] and once you get that confidence you
[1:53:19] place that in the body
[1:53:21] say use me lord can you say man
[1:53:24] you get in there you say lord if you can
[1:53:27] use anything lord you can use me
