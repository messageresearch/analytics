[56:08] sister Tom Wayne Amen back did to have
[56:12] her amen and uh we we thank God for
[56:17] keeping her while she was
[56:18] away uh this morning we had our Sunday
[56:22] school and and I want to say thank you
[56:24] to all the parents that press to bring
[56:28] their children here uh for Sunday school
[56:31] brother brandom say don't send
[56:33] them you're supposed to bring them and
[56:38] um and um I'm grateful for all the
[56:40] parents for the sacrifice you know if we
[56:43] if we get them up to go to regular
[56:46] school we wake them up tell them they
[56:49] can't over sleep they can't do none of
[56:51] this you got to get your work done you
[56:53] got to be just as
[56:56] Vigilant when it comes to Sunday school
[57:00] amen uh these are the things that shape
[57:03] them as young people so we want to have
[57:05] amen an environment where we can do that
[57:08] I just thank you all parents for coming
[57:10] amen and and bringing your your uh your
[57:13] youth amen for the uh Sunday school this
[57:16] morning um as you saw we will be
[57:19] starting our fast today amen it's a
[57:22] 21-day fast we call it a corporate fast
[57:24] because
[57:25] and and again I don't make this um I'm
[57:28] not trying to be legalistic in any way
[57:30] at all but uh however the Lord would
[57:34] lead you to fast and that can be food
[57:38] can be to a certain time of day 12:00
[57:41] 3:00 now I no this that when your
[57:45] doctor ask you to
[57:49] fast you don't give
[57:53] no
[57:55] uh resistance or feed you know not not
[57:59] it's not feedback but push back you
[58:02] don't give no pushback okay doc no
[58:04] problem Dr Jack
[58:07] Duff if you need me to carry that title
[58:11] I'm asking you to join us in this
[58:13] corporate fast the reason we call it
[58:14] corporate because when you look in the
[58:17] Book of Esther uh there was a time amen
[58:21] that they uh they needed Esther to go
[58:23] before the king because there was a a
[58:25] decision that had been made they were
[58:27] going to kill all the Jews and Essa had
[58:28] not shared who she was but Mori told her
[58:31] look don't think just because you in the
[58:33] King's house that you're going to be
[58:35] spared when they realize who you are
[58:37] you're going to die like the rest of us
[58:38] it says and but but maybe God has place
[58:41] you in this position that you can go to
[58:43] the King on behalf of your people and
[58:46] let me let me help you to understand
[58:47] Esther's position as Queen was not her
[58:50] highest role that she was to play right
[58:53] but when she stepped in into amen this
[58:55] role of
[58:58] Savior she went before the king and says
[59:00] you know look I if I die I'll die she
[59:03] say if I perish I perish but I'm going
[59:05] to go see the king but before she went
[59:07] to see the king she said look I need
[59:08] everybody to enter into corporate
[59:12] fasting not just you Uncle Mori I want
[59:14] the whole nation of Israel so we all
[59:18] together enter into this time of fasting
[59:20] it might be social media it might be
[59:23] food it might I don't know what it is
[59:26] that God will lead you to do but
[59:28] whatever the Lord lead you to do do
[59:30] something during this next 21 days the
[59:32] other thing that we are under we're
[59:35] under this and uh at the same time that
[59:38] our fast will end we are also under
[59:41] manded not to say anything negative we
[59:45] had a 40-day challenge don't say one
[59:47] thing negative everything got to be
[59:49] positive coming out of your
[59:51] mouth don't let the devil make you say
[59:53] nothing negative
[59:55] hallelujah we're just going to see what
[59:57] the Lord does for us Amen brother

[1:05:19] will to
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:23] um
[1:05:27] let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:30] 12 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:35] 12 yeah brother Quinton he corrected me
[1:05:38] also um I was commending him on his his
[1:05:42] organization and cleaning
[1:05:45] skills in the in the place that they
[1:05:47] provided for us to be able to stay in
[1:05:49] and he said well it's actually a young
[1:05:51] lady brother that comes and cleans so
[1:05:54] but she does a good
[1:05:56] job amen she must have been in the
[1:05:59] [Laughter]
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] military amen so all right 1 Corinthians
[1:06:06] chapter 12 starting at Verse 18 it says
[1:06:09] but now haveth God set the members every
[1:06:11] one of them in the body as it hath
[1:06:13] pleased him and if they were all one
[1:06:17] member he says where were the body but
[1:06:20] now are they many members yet but one
[1:06:23] body and the I cannot say unto the hand
[1:06:26] I have no need of thee nor again the
[1:06:28] head to the feet I have no need of you n
[1:06:32] but much more those members of the body
[1:06:34] which seem to be more feeble are
[1:06:36] necessary right and those members of the
[1:06:39] body which we think to be less
[1:06:41] honorable upon these we bestow more
[1:06:44] abundant honor and our uncommonly parts
[1:06:47] have more abundant cess for our calmly
[1:06:51] Parts have no need meaning it's always
[1:06:54] taken care of our face our head
[1:06:57] right but certain parts aren't as highly
[1:07:00] as you know esteemed that's it as other
[1:07:03] parts right um and and it exists amongst
[1:07:07] the body of Christ sadly to say at
[1:07:10] times praise God amen amen it says our
[1:07:14] comely Parts have no need but God have
[1:07:18] tempered the body
[1:07:22] together so there's a certain
[1:07:26] perspective right and relationship that
[1:07:29] God wants each member to have one to the
[1:07:33] other that's very important to
[1:07:36] him it's important to him how we see one
[1:07:39] another how we handle one
[1:07:42] another
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:45] amen it says having giving more abundant
[1:07:48] honor to that part which lacked it says
[1:07:51] that there should be no Schism in the
[1:07:54] body that's it that's it that's it no
[1:07:56] division right
[1:07:58] whatsoever none amen can we say praise
[1:08:01] the
[1:08:02] Lord and this is a father talking about
[1:08:05] his
[1:08:06] family that's right yes sir
[1:08:12] amen my it says but that the members
[1:08:15] should have the same
[1:08:18] care one for another that's it and
[1:08:21] whether one member suffer all all the
[1:08:24] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:08:27] honored all the members Rejoice with it
[1:08:31] Glory now ye are the body of Christ he
[1:08:34] says and members in particular Glory I
[1:08:37] want to go here one verse of scripture
[1:08:39] Romans chapter
[1:08:42] 5 and verse
[1:08:50] 19 Romans 5 verse 19
[1:08:54] it says for as by by one man's
[1:08:58] Disobedience many were made

[1:09:04] many be made

[1:09:22] desire that we love you with all of our
[1:09:24] hearts all of our mind and all of our
[1:09:27] strength and that's been the main motive
[1:09:30] Lord behind our entire Christian journey
[1:09:34] is for you to bring us into that kind of
[1:09:36] A Love For You Lord at the relationship

[1:10:58] about many things Lord but help every

[1:11:07] that all things are well thank you Jesus

[1:11:14] mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:11:16] Christ Let the church say amen amen you

[1:11:22] Saints
[1:11:34] amen so I really enjoy you all this
[1:11:38] worship amen
[1:11:40] uh just a blessing and it it really
[1:11:43] helped me in the back to get settled in
[1:11:46] my heart and that's the intent right
[1:11:48] that's the purpose to help us to settle
[1:11:50] down and to move into that channel of
[1:11:53] God all right amen that we might be in
[1:11:55] sync all right amen with him and that he
[1:11:58] might have his way Among Us
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] um so I have somewhat of a strange topic
[1:12:06] but it's something I've not been able to
[1:12:07] get away from for quite some time now um
[1:12:11] it was very necessary for me to come
[1:12:14] into these things to the understanding
[1:12:16] of these things um and just just
[1:12:19] concerning my walk with God right but it
[1:12:23] it it it just took me into a place
[1:12:25] saints that I I I I don't even want to
[1:12:28] come out of it amen okay amen um and the
[1:12:33] topic itself is
[1:12:36] coordination
[1:12:38] coordination and as a
[1:12:40] subtopic
[1:12:44] connected
[1:12:47] connected so coordination just to help
[1:12:50] you to follow me a little bit
[1:12:51] coordination means the process of
[1:12:53] organizing
[1:12:55] people or groups so that they work
[1:12:58] together
[1:12:59] properly and
[1:13:02] well my God my God it says the
[1:13:05] harmonious functioning of parts for
[1:13:09] Effective
[1:13:13] results all of us in here we have
[1:13:15] different backgrounds different families
[1:13:18] some some have maybe the same families
[1:13:20] depending on how close you are you know
[1:13:22] as relatively relative speaking um but
[1:13:26] we come from different backgrounds you
[1:13:27] know uh in a company right you know all
[1:13:31] of us for the most part work for a
[1:13:33] company of some sort unless you're an
[1:13:35] entrepreneur and that company uh it's
[1:13:38] one company but it hires team
[1:13:41] members right these people have
[1:13:43] different skill levels different
[1:13:45] backgrounds different upbringings
[1:13:47] different beliefs right right but this
[1:13:50] company's objective is to bring all
[1:13:53] these individuals that differ one from
[1:13:55] another sir Under the Umbrella of that
[1:13:58] company and that company has a vision
[1:14:02] isn't that right right and it it it it
[1:14:05] it desires that each member that it
[1:14:07] chooses to hire to bring Under the
[1:14:09] Umbrella of that company it desires that
[1:14:12] that individual catch the vision of the
[1:14:16] company itself right but not just one
[1:14:19] individual each individual needs to
[1:14:21] catch that vision because once they all
[1:14:24] catch the vision that actually
[1:14:27] contributes to them being able to come
[1:14:29] together and begin to work together cuz
[1:14:33] everybody has a part to play everybody
[1:14:35] has a
[1:14:36] position you know how it is right when
[1:14:39] you're a part of a team and you have a
[1:14:41] position but everybody else has a
[1:14:43] position everybody want everybody else
[1:14:45] to do their
[1:14:48] job in order for us to meet production
[1:14:50] in order for us to meet our quota or
[1:14:53] whatever whatever the case might be
[1:14:54] Everybody Must operate within their
[1:14:57] positions
[1:14:59] efficiently
[1:15:01] consistently right if anybody slacks up
[1:15:04] that means somebody else got to work
[1:15:06] harder to try to fill that
[1:15:09] Gap brother now let me see by a show of
[1:15:12] hands who desires to be that person that
[1:15:14] has to fill in the
[1:15:16] Gap come
[1:15:19] on to do a portion of somebody else's
[1:15:22] job
[1:15:25] and they getting paid just like you
[1:15:27] getting
[1:15:28] paid truth
[1:15:30] brother right during my military time I
[1:15:33] was in the Marine
[1:15:35] Corps
[1:15:37] and certain people just have certain
[1:15:39] makeups right yes
[1:15:42] sir and nothing to myself by far but
[1:15:46] while I was in boot camp they chose to
[1:15:49] make me the guide of the
[1:15:51] platoon right so that that see that
[1:15:54] might seem like a glor you know other
[1:15:56] people wanted that position but that
[1:15:58] wasn't a glorious
[1:15:59] position because I was held
[1:16:04] accountable for everybody's
[1:16:08] actions I remember one time in
[1:16:10] particular Saints where one one
[1:16:12] individual forgot to lock their lock on
[1:16:15] their duffel
[1:16:18] bag and guess what the drill instructors
[1:16:21] went through while we were at child they
[1:16:22] found it
[1:16:23] and when the whole plon got
[1:16:25] back the individual that did it they
[1:16:29] wern't aware that they did it but when
[1:16:31] we came into that door the drill
[1:16:33] instructors called me front and center
[1:16:36] wow and when they called me front and
[1:16:38] center they pointed out the mistake that
[1:16:40] person
[1:16:41] made and they say now we going to get
[1:16:44] recruit
[1:16:46] McBride to pay the price wow for that
[1:16:50] individual not locking their lock wow
[1:16:53] and I had to get down and do push-ups
[1:16:55] until they told me to
[1:16:58] stop how you think I
[1:17:03] fell huh me and that individual that
[1:17:06] didn't lock they lock we had to have a
[1:17:09] talk we ain't going to be doing this
[1:17:11] again my brother I ain't going to pay
[1:17:14] the price for what you fail to
[1:17:17] do right but what were they trying to
[1:17:20] build come on they were trying to build
[1:17:23] a team sir you understand what I'm
[1:17:25] saying they were trying to create a
[1:17:27] situation to where everybody was
[1:17:30] watching how they did things so that it
[1:17:32] wouldn't negatively affect the other
[1:17:35] person yes sir come on brother I'm
[1:17:39] talking about coordination amen amen so
[1:17:43] to bring everybody together to catch
[1:17:45] that
[1:17:46] vision and once you catch that Vision
[1:17:49] that should encourage you to do your
[1:17:53] part because you see that by you being
[1:17:55] if everybody see that by being in their
[1:17:57] positions it contributes to the success
[1:18:00] of the entire
[1:18:02] company when everything is running
[1:18:04] smoothly as it's supposed to be
[1:18:06] everybody wins everybody gets bonuses
[1:18:09] everybody gets pay raises the whole
[1:18:12] company
[1:18:14] wins but sad to
[1:18:17] say whether it be a
[1:18:20] company and please forgive me let let's
[1:18:23] let's do one thing together just real
[1:18:25] quick all right do me a favor everybody
[1:18:27] repeat after
[1:18:29] me everybody say we love we love brother
[1:18:36] McBride remember that
[1:18:39] [Applause]
[1:18:41] now that's good I'm just a
[1:18:45] messenger I didn't put this on my own
[1:18:48] heart this was ministered to
[1:18:51] me I'm only giving to you what was given
[1:18:54] to me for me so I'm not preaching at no
[1:18:59] one so God as we read in our opening
[1:19:02] scripture he desired that everybody in
[1:19:05] the body have an actual
[1:19:08] care one for another amen amen in my
[1:19:12] home as a father that's my desire I want
[1:19:16] we got five kids well young adults
[1:19:19] adults and I want everybody to work
[1:19:21] together I don't even want to hear wrong
[1:19:24] tones toward one
[1:19:27] another I might be in another room
[1:19:29] somewhere but I'm paying
[1:19:31] attention and as I hear conversations
[1:19:33] and whatever and something sounds kind
[1:19:35] of off I want to come and I want to
[1:19:38] investigate is everything okay are there
[1:19:41] any issues you know why why why why why
[1:19:44] are you talking like that one to
[1:19:47] another why because in my home I want
[1:19:50] there to be a
[1:19:51] Harmony I want to feel good coming in my
[1:19:54] own home I want to be able to relax I
[1:19:57] want people to be happy and joyous I
[1:20:00] want God to have an atmosphere that he
[1:20:02] can come down in I don't want to have an
[1:20:06] atmosphere filled with confusion and
[1:20:08] fussing and backbiting and all kind of
[1:20:10] stuff going on what kind of a home is
[1:20:14] that if you got a business you don't
[1:20:16] want your your your your your your team
[1:20:18] members fighting amongst one another
[1:20:20] working against one another what a work
[1:20:23] environment is
[1:20:24] that that'll lead to the defeat of the
[1:20:27] whole company it a Lord have mercy the
[1:20:30] whole company will absolutely fail
[1:20:33] that's right brother due to wrong
[1:20:35] attitudes and things of that
[1:20:37] nature when you ain't working together
[1:20:39] you working against one another
[1:20:41] defeating the
[1:20:44] purpose killing the
[1:20:46] vision
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:49] amen can we say praise the lord lord
[1:20:55] okay so now let's kind of move into this
[1:20:59] other area here we read also in Romans
[1:21:03] where it says by one man's sin one man's
[1:21:07] Disobedience how many
[1:21:12] men what kind of an effect did that one
[1:21:15] man's decision
[1:21:18] have you and I are still dealing with
[1:21:21] the results of that decision
[1:21:23] today one
[1:21:26] man brother Brandon makes a statement he
[1:21:29] says that eternal life is living your
[1:21:33] life for who for
[1:21:37] yourself no for
[1:21:39] others what does that
[1:21:42] mean
[1:21:46] it what does that mean
[1:21:49] Saints normally when people commit
[1:21:52] crimes
[1:21:53] right they're a it's like they're more
[1:21:55] easily able to commit a crime you might
[1:21:58] have a man that has a
[1:21:59] family right but he's Bound by a certain
[1:22:04] Spirit he loves his family he might have
[1:22:07] kids he loves his kids but he's Bound by
[1:22:10] a certain
[1:22:12] spirit and sometimes in a when a way a
[1:22:14] person thinks they can actually commit a
[1:22:17] crime because in their mind somehow they
[1:22:20] think that I'm only a affecting myself
[1:22:24] right that's right I'm willing to take
[1:22:26] this risk to commit this crime because
[1:22:29] if anything goes down I'll go to
[1:22:32] jail come
[1:22:34] on but they don't think it's going to
[1:22:37] affect their loved
[1:22:39] ones
[1:22:41] truth isn't that right yes
[1:22:44] sir so when any evil spirit anoints
[1:22:47] someone it brings about a mindset of
[1:22:51] selfishness amen amen
[1:22:55] amen yes sir so Adam's one decision
[1:22:58] we're still dealing with the
[1:23:00] repercussions of back
[1:23:01] today even listen now even though
[1:23:04] Calvary took place that's
[1:23:09] right you understand now brother Brandon
[1:23:13] made a statement I want to make it very
[1:23:14] clear right now right even though Adam
[1:23:17] did what he
[1:23:18] did we can't
[1:23:21] blame
[1:23:23] today for what alt together for what
[1:23:27] we're deing he said because each one of
[1:23:28] us every day every minute every second
[1:23:32] every hour we have that same choice to
[1:23:34] make whether we going to eat from the
[1:23:36] Tree of Life or the tree of knowledge of
[1:23:39] Good and Evil with every decision amen
[1:23:42] every Deion amen every day nobody in
[1:23:46] this room is exempt from what I'm
[1:23:47] talking about right
[1:23:49] now Hallelujah I'm talking about
[1:23:51] coordination
[1:23:55] but on the same note just like Adam's
[1:23:58] decision affected
[1:24:02] us our decisions affect one
[1:24:05] another whether we realize it tonight
[1:24:09] whether we want to accept it or not
[1:24:11] we're actually
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:19] connected let's go
[1:24:21] to
[1:24:23] remember what you said in the beginning
[1:24:25] now you said we love brother
[1:24:27] McBride let's go to Joshua chapter 7
[1:24:31] there it is let's go to Joshua chapter 7
[1:24:34] I want to go to verse
[1:24:36] one cuz even know we know that God deals
[1:24:40] with Israel as a nation and he deals
[1:24:43] with the Gentiles as
[1:24:45] individuals yet by the grace of God we
[1:24:47] want to bring out that we're still
[1:24:50] connected we still have an obligation to
[1:24:53] one
[1:24:55] another we have a responsibility to one
[1:25:00] another to live a life that's worthy of
[1:25:02] the Gospel
[1:25:08] amen Joshua 7 verse1 says but the
[1:25:11] children notice how it words this now
[1:25:14] but the children of Israel committed a
[1:25:18] trespass who did it children of Israel
[1:25:21] God counting it to the whole
[1:25:25] group yes
[1:25:28] brother
[1:25:30] yes Lord you mean to tell me you will
[1:25:33] cause other people to
[1:25:35] suffer because of one man's
[1:25:38] Disobedience there it
[1:25:40] is it says the children of Israel
[1:25:43] committed a trespass in the accursed
[1:25:45] thing it says for aen one man the son of
[1:25:49] Cari the son of zabdi the son of zer of
[1:25:52] the tribe of Judah took of the accursed
[1:25:55] thing and the anger of the Lord watch
[1:25:57] this one man did it one man took it upon
[1:26:02] himself to satisfy his own lust wow
[1:26:06] right one
[1:26:09] man and the Bible says when he did that
[1:26:12] it says God's anger was kindled against
[1:26:15] the children
[1:26:17] plural right of Israel that's right
[1:26:22] amen that's
[1:26:25] right prior to
[1:26:28] this they were at
[1:26:31] Jericho right and God call them to march
[1:26:37] around the land right the walls there
[1:26:41] and just before they were getting ready
[1:26:43] to
[1:26:44] enter God paused and he gave a warning
[1:26:48] through
[1:26:49] Joshua and he says now this place is a
[1:26:55] cursed he says when we go in here he
[1:26:59] says don't none of you take anything out
[1:27:04] of this
[1:27:06] land because if you individually take
[1:27:09] anything out of this land the individual
[1:27:11] that took it is a cursed amen right
[1:27:15] that's right but he he goes on to say
[1:27:17] saints that when you bring what you took
[1:27:19] that was a curse it it it causes you to
[1:27:23] become a cursed but then when you bring
[1:27:24] it back amongst the camp of Israel all
[1:27:27] of Israel is going to be a
[1:27:32] cursed amen everybody understand
[1:27:38] that so
[1:27:40] aen everybody supposed to be focused on
[1:27:44] the
[1:27:45] objective that God has set forth for the
[1:27:49] whole tribe of
[1:27:50] Israel and in order for them to be
[1:27:53] successful listen Saints they had to be
[1:27:57] obedient right that's good that's good
[1:28:01] you couldn't Veer off you couldn't you
[1:28:04] you you had to keep every
[1:28:07] word brother brandom says Canaan was not
[1:28:10] a type of the Millennium
[1:28:13] right because there was Wars it was
[1:28:15] fightings it was
[1:28:17] killings he said but it was a type of
[1:28:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] and he said what it stood for he said it
[1:28:25] had to be a perfect walk that's it
[1:28:29] brother that's
[1:28:31] it but brother McBride and now you know
[1:28:33] we human I do know that we're human
[1:28:36] right but God has laid out Provisions
[1:28:40] that takes away every excuse you could
[1:28:43] ever come up with he shed his own blood
[1:28:47] amen that forgave all of us of every
[1:28:50] trespass and he gave his own Spirit to
[1:28:53] come on the inside of each one of us to
[1:28:56] give us power to be able to live what we
[1:28:59] could never do on
[1:29:01] ourselves so we ain't talking about
[1:29:03] self-righteousness now but we talking
[1:29:05] about every member dying to themselves
[1:29:08] and yielding to God and allowing God to
[1:29:10] come inside of their souls and take the
[1:29:13] full
[1:29:14] preeminence take control of your mind
[1:29:17] take control of your
[1:29:19] body and listen now he said I cause you
[1:29:22] to live according to my word I'll cause
[1:29:24] you to work walk right amen it's not us
[1:29:27] it's him and as we yield ourselves to
[1:29:30] him we allow him to do exactly
[1:29:33] that brother Brandon was a man like you
[1:29:36] and I born in sin had to come to a
[1:29:39] conversion yes sir but he came to a
[1:29:42] yielding and such a love for God until
[1:29:45] God can take control of that man and
[1:29:47] freely flow through his being glory to
[1:29:50] God yes sir many people exalt the
[1:29:53] prophet many people highly esteem him
[1:29:56] but he was a brother just like us and
[1:29:59] God only show through him what every one
[1:30:02] of us have the
[1:30:04] potential to move up
[1:30:07] into there's nobody in here that's
[1:30:09] exempt from that you got the
[1:30:11] potential to live just like
[1:30:14] that but it's through a
[1:30:17] relationship it's through a willful
[1:30:20] submitting of yourselves is through a
[1:30:22] love for God so when everybody's
[1:30:25] supposed to be focused on the mission
[1:30:27] everybody is supposed to be in their
[1:30:29] positions doing what they're supposed to
[1:30:31] do what they've been called to do aen he
[1:30:35] had this Spirit of lust on
[1:30:37] him that's it an evil
[1:30:41] spirit that calls him to desire to do
[1:30:45] contrary to do the exact opposite of
[1:30:49] what God was calling for right glory to
[1:30:52] God Spirits make people
[1:30:55] disregard the word of God you understand
[1:30:59] what I'm saying Saints amen aan heard
[1:31:02] very well what Joshua said right but he
[1:31:05] thought it was just a man
[1:31:07] see
[1:31:09] yeah amen you know that devil evil
[1:31:12] spirits want to make things very
[1:31:15] common so that we lose the
[1:31:18] respect amen that we should have toward
[1:31:22] the program of God and what God has
[1:31:24] established Among Us amen amen amen he
[1:31:30] want people to let down their guards he
[1:31:32] want people not to fear
[1:31:37] repercussions how was Eve able to
[1:31:39] venture beyond the word of
[1:31:41] God Lord have mercy
[1:31:44] Saints oh my we love brother Saints
[1:31:48] praise God you understand brother
[1:31:51] brandom said where Eve made her mistake
[1:31:54] listen to me Saints and this is where
[1:31:56] everybody makes their mistake whenever
[1:31:58] they allow themselves to fall into sin
[1:32:00] he says Eve stopped for one
[1:32:03] moment and considered the
[1:32:06] suggestion that the devil brought to her
[1:32:08] mind through the serpent and when she
[1:32:11] considered it that Spirit came inside of
[1:32:13] her right
[1:32:15] there right whenever you you whenever
[1:32:19] you allow yourself the Ponder of the toy
[1:32:22] around in your mind with suggestions
[1:32:25] that Devils bring to you to try to lead
[1:32:27] you into some way or another to hurt you
[1:32:31] come
[1:32:33] on but not just you come
[1:32:36] on Devils know that we're
[1:32:39] connected those Devils knew that achin
[1:32:42] was

[1:32:46] saying them brothers out there fighting
[1:32:50] they out there doing exact L what God
[1:32:52] Said trying their best to be obedient
[1:32:55] for the success of the whole
[1:32:59] group but everybody wasn't a team

[1:33:05] selfish all he thought about was
[1:33:09] his and what help what was satisfi what
[1:33:12] he wanted at at that time in that in

[1:33:25] land he supposed to be fighting he know
[1:33:28] that God said don't you take of one
[1:33:30] thing but now he going running through

[1:34:17] success said man let me and listen now
[1:34:22] he had to take that garment Saints and
[1:34:24] what do he have to do with it he
[1:34:26] couldn't just take and just
[1:34:29] walk go show people look at what I got

[1:34:34] there cuz he he he might he might talk
[1:34:37] to the wrong person he might he might
[1:34:40] talk to a person whose mind is stayed on
[1:34:42] the Lord amen and he didn't want to get
[1:34:45] a reuke while he was abiding his sin so
[1:34:49] he was careful who he talked to yes sir
[1:34:53] Jesus come
[1:34:55] on Sir many times people that are called
[1:34:58] away listen now they might be real
[1:35:01] brothers and
[1:35:02] sisters but they sto for a
[1:35:05] moment and allowed an evil spirit to
[1:35:08] come and anoint them and brother
[1:35:10] brandham said this
[1:35:13] right the bride has
[1:35:18] sins black
[1:35:20] spots that
[1:35:22] come and her spirit gets stained with
[1:35:25] these black
[1:35:26] spots but then of course by the grace of
[1:35:29] God we come to church where you might be
[1:35:31] at home and the Lord might lead you to
[1:35:33] listen to a certain sermon and now amen
[1:35:36] that spirit that black spot gets

[1:35:41] the word amen what is God doing God Is
[1:35:44] Lifting that stain praise God Amen so he
[1:35:48] can wash it off amen the deliver that
[1:35:51] Saint from that listen now temporary
[1:35:57] bondage the prophet said that a
[1:36:01] possession is when Satan comes and
[1:36:03] attaches himself to a person's spirit
[1:36:07] and that gives them unclean
[1:36:10] habits that they find themselves not
[1:36:13] being able to break away
[1:36:15] from cuz it's some place somehow they're
[1:36:19] yielding themselves to a devil through
[1:36:21] some Avenue you can't blame it on the
[1:36:24] devil cuz the devil can't make us do
[1:36:27] nothing how many say Amen to that we got
[1:36:30] the power of decision Saints to be able
[1:36:33] to resist the Bible say resist the devil
[1:36:36] and he'll free in order for a devil to
[1:36:39] come and stay somebody ain't
[1:36:47] resisting
[1:36:49] amen forgive me S

[1:36:57] enticements of the devil amen his
[1:37:00] selling he he got he got excellent
[1:37:01] salesman

[1:37:06] glory to God why you think so many
[1:37:07] people Abiding and sin amen Satan done
[1:37:10] sold them he done presented it in such a
[1:37:12] way until it seems like they can't
[1:37:15] resist and they got to taste they got to
[1:37:18] touch they got to get
[1:37:20] in
[1:37:22] for a temporary
[1:37:25] appeasement it's the truth brother it's
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:28] truth
[1:37:30] Jesus he said now that's a
[1:37:34] possession he says but you can have
[1:37:36] somebody with the Holy
[1:37:39] Ghost that might just be
[1:37:44] oppressed that means that what I just
[1:37:47] talked about it's a
[1:37:49] spot at the Lord Lord got to come and
[1:37:52] help to clean you
[1:37:55] from can you bring that a little clear
[1:37:57] brother
[1:37:57] McBride when brother brandham
[1:38:02] lied that was in
[1:38:05] oppression that was a real
[1:38:07] demon that brother brandom yielded
[1:38:09] himself
[1:38:10] to and he carried out the lust of that
[1:38:14] Spirit can we say praise the
[1:38:16] Lord
[1:38:18] amen and as a result of that see oh God
[1:38:23] he amen he was
[1:38:25] connected to that young
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:28] baby that needed help right
[1:38:32] brother and he went on to try to still
[1:38:35] pray for that baby and when he went to
[1:38:38] go and try to carry out his commission
[1:38:42] right God came in the same God of love
[1:38:46] the one that died on calvary's Cross for
[1:38:50] the sins of all of us us you understand
[1:38:52] the blood done been shed now but even
[1:38:55] with the blood present see many people
[1:38:56] don't understand what that means to be
[1:39:00] under the
[1:39:01] blood you understand because the prophet
[1:39:04] was right there and he went to lay hands
[1:39:06] on that baby and that voice came to him
[1:39:08] and said you going to lay your lying
[1:39:10] hands on that
[1:39:13] child God withheld his power oh glory
[1:39:18] amen from a man that flow
[1:39:21] that was able to tap into the channel of
[1:39:24] God on numerous occasions God withheld
[1:39:27] his power says and wouldn't release it
[1:39:30] Lord and didn't permit the prophet to
[1:39:33] pray amen because he yielded in a time
[1:39:37] of
[1:39:40] pressure wow wow wow now we talking
[1:39:44] about these things out here we want to
[1:39:45] bring it right home to every one of our
[1:39:47] hearts sir you talk about living your
[1:39:50] life for us Brothers what does that
[1:39:54] mean that mean doing good
[1:39:56] deeds you need some gas I come get you
[1:40:00] some gas brother you you need some eggs
[1:40:04] I got I got five cart you can come get
[1:40:07] four of them now you need some threads
[1:40:10] some
[1:40:11] clothes I can help you
[1:40:14] out what did Paul remind us of saints
[1:40:17] come on you can give your body to be
[1:40:19] burned you can give your Goods to the
[1:40:21] poor listen now it goes beyond that you
[1:40:24] can have faith to move
[1:40:26] mountains but if you don't have the Holy
[1:40:30] Ghost if you don't have a person of God
[1:40:32] himself inside of your soul controlling
[1:40:36] you causing you to live listen
[1:40:39] now except your righteousness exceed
[1:40:42] that of the Pharisees they didn't have
[1:40:44] the Holy Ghost where they were still
[1:40:46] trying to live the word by
[1:40:49] willpower
[1:40:53] amen glory but our righteousness got to
[1:40:56] exceed that it ain't a religious
[1:40:59] show we we depending on what crowd you
[1:41:05] with see depending on the environment
[1:41:07] you with that that dictates the behavior
[1:41:11] at times amen we're all a work in
[1:41:14] progress I'm not above nobody I told you
[1:41:18] this was preached to me right but
[1:41:21] depending on the environment you in that
[1:41:23] that determines what you allow to be
[1:41:26] released but we want to be real
[1:41:29] Christians amen we want to be real
[1:41:32] Christians we want to have a real love
[1:41:34] for God a real relationship with God we
[1:41:37] want to have real fellowship with God to
[1:41:39] a point to where no matter where we are
[1:41:42] no matter what's presented to you and I
[1:41:44] our love for God will be so high until
[1:41:48] nothing else can't catch our
[1:41:49] attention did not the prophet talk about
[1:41:52] that Shepherd that was leading those
[1:41:54] sheep and all those things those sheep
[1:41:56] love they were walking in the midst
[1:41:59] of but they refrain from satisfying
[1:42:02] their own desires because they were
[1:42:04] keeping their eyes on the
[1:42:09] shepherd that's the kind of love God
[1:42:12] want us to have for him to where the
[1:42:15] devil can't dangle Shake do nothing
[1:42:18] before us amen our hearts are pulled to
[1:42:22] attention and say I love my husband and
[1:42:24] you will keep going on in a faithful
[1:42:28] manner because of a love see the Bible
[1:42:31] says the love of God is shared abroad in
[1:42:32] all Hearts by the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:42:37] so achen took the
[1:42:39] Garment he went and took the gold he saw
[1:42:43] silver he took silver and I want to I
[1:42:46] want to emphasize this because the holy
[1:42:48] spirit is helping me to do that right
[1:42:50] now
[1:42:51] he couldn't walk out right with it share
[1:42:54] it with nobody that's right he had to
[1:42:56] hide
[1:42:58] it in such a manner to nobody will take
[1:43:03] notice while he got his on his while he
[1:43:05] got it on his person while he's in the
[1:43:07] midst of the crime he might come in
[1:43:10] contact with a
[1:43:11] brother and he had to try to keep his
[1:43:19] composure tell the
[1:43:21] brother cuz he ain't want nothing to
[1:43:23] leak
[1:43:24] out holding it getting a cramp in his
[1:43:26] arm trying to hold
[1:43:30] it Lord have mercy trying to make sure
[1:43:33] that thing don't fall down cuz they
[1:43:35] ain't have no pants
[1:43:38] now that they fall right to the ground
[1:43:42] so that brother had to be mindful and
[1:43:44] when demons come on people and they're
[1:43:46] anointed listen now it makes them real
[1:43:49] super mindful
[1:43:51] and they make sure everything is covered
[1:43:53] real tight so when they come to church
[1:43:56] or when they see one of the Saints or
[1:43:57] whatever man everything is real tight
[1:44:00] they they ain't comfortable at all they
[1:44:02] very
[1:44:04] uncomfortable right and they hoping that
[1:44:06] they hurry up and
[1:44:07] leave that church hurry up and be over I
[1:44:09] want nobody asking me no qu I want
[1:44:11] nobody to pick
[1:44:12] up cuz when you in the presence of the
[1:44:14] Lord Saints you get
[1:44:16] uncomfortable why you think Adam and Eve
[1:44:19] ran God just came walking the voice of
[1:44:22] the Lord walking he always did that but
[1:44:26] what made the
[1:44:27] difference come on brother why did they
[1:44:29] try to
[1:44:30] hide cuz the spirit of the devil came on
[1:44:33] them amen
[1:44:37] truth so aen had to conceal it hold it
[1:44:41] real tight till he made it to his
[1:44:44] tent and once he made it to his tent
[1:44:47] what did he do
[1:44:49] Saints he buried
[1:44:51] it he knew it was
[1:44:54] there now they went ahead and went
[1:44:56] through Jericho just fine but now they

[1:45:09] look at the Lord word came to pass just
[1:45:11] like he said the walls came down we
[1:45:14] destroyed everything like God said but
[1:45:16] listen now ain's actions had already
[1:45:19] taken effect yes
[1:45:22] sir and the people didn't even know it
[1:45:24] listen Joshua didn't even know
[1:45:29] it now they going against
[1:45:31] Ai and Joshua say well go scout out the
[1:45:34] land see what we need to be able to
[1:45:36] fight against these people they went
[1:45:38] over there and they was like man we got

[1:45:43] just take three th we ain't got to take
[1:45:44] many just take 3,000 people 3,000 men
[1:45:49] and they went up to take 3,000 and men
[1:45:50] they thought for sure see God UNT told
[1:45:52] us they weren't aware of the secret
[1:45:56] sin Lord Jesus now I'm going say a few
[1:45:59] things by the grace of God
[1:46:01] Saints anything you got to hide right
[1:46:05] you ain't got to ask nobody if it's
[1:46:14] wrong that's right praise the lord lord

[1:54:52] of God coming down into those vessels
[1:54:54] and being expressed but look at how they
[1:54:56] were handled the very people God sent
[1:54:59] them to to help them they allowed the
[1:55:02] devil to give them a wrong mindset
[1:55:04] toward the very vessel being used and
[1:55:06] they kill the vessel yes sir Lord Jesus
[1:55:09] truth that's the mindset Devils want to
[1:55:11] bring they want to make you rebel

[1:56:06] Joshua knew it was God promis yes sir
[1:56:09] and Joshua was faithful Joshua was
[1:56:12] steadfast Joshua loved the

[1:56:19] of a sudden what wasn't supposed to
[1:56:21] happen is happening right God said no
[1:56:24] man will be able to stand before you now
[1:56:26] they're being defeated by the
[1:56:28] enemy and they're running down running
[1:56:31] now away from the enemy and 36 men
[1:56:35] listen Saints was
[1:56:39] killed aen was still
[1:56:44] alive the one that committed the sin was
[1:56:46] still
[1:56:47] alive these men had
[1:56:50] families these men were being obedient
[1:56:53] these men loved the Lord they were
[1:56:55] trying to keep the vision trying to go
[1:56:57] for the objective to satisfy God's
[1:57:00] desire and they
[1:57:05] died because achen wanted to satisfy his
[1:57:08] lust in a selfish frame of mind that
[1:57:11] that devil brought on him when Devils
[1:57:13] anoint people it makes them forget about
[1:57:16] everybody that's why people on drugs or
[1:57:18] whatever all they do is try to go for
[1:57:20] that hit they don't care they don't care
[1:57:22] if they steal or whatever they don't
[1:57:24] think about the repercussions of their
[1:57:26] decisions
[1:57:28] right a can still
[1:57:31] living 36 men
[1:57:35] dead it affected the whole group now

[1:57:53] another battle hold on Joshua we die we
[1:57:56] got men that die and Joshua this is the
[1:57:58] thing that caught me Saints Joshua is
[1:58:01] confused
[1:58:03] right oh my God Saints go back and read
[1:58:06] it yeah Joshua Joshua actually thought
[1:58:10] that God wasn't keeping his
[1:58:15] word Lord why did you how are we goingon
[1:58:18] to go forward the other countries when
[1:58:20] they hear about this he knew what God
[1:58:23] had said but he didn't know what aen had
[1:58:27] done so he saw defeat amongst his
[1:58:31] congregation brother and he knew that
[1:58:33] was wrong what's going on it made him
[1:58:36] question things that he should never
[1:58:38] have
[1:58:41] questioned so he fell on his face he was
[1:58:44] crying out to God lord what's this right
[1:58:46] here that's got taking place and God
[1:58:48] looking at
[1:58:50] Joshua and God said now hold on Joshua
[1:58:53] in order for you to act like that son
[1:58:56] you act like my word ain't true right
[1:58:59] you act like my promise ain't true but
[1:59:02] don't you remember what I told you
[1:59:04] before you even came in the land and you
[1:59:06] told Israel that so in order for this to
[1:59:09] take place there must be sin in the
[1:59:12] camp I told you that if they brought
[1:59:15] that a cursed thing back it was going to
[1:59:17] cause all of Israel to be a cursed and
[1:59:19] God said I'm not going to be with you no
[1:59:22] more
[1:59:24] Lord it caused the anointing of God to
[1:59:27] lift up off of the whole
[1:59:31] group because of the secret sin of one
[1:59:36] person I don't have to go much longer
[1:59:39] you got
[1:59:41] it living your life for others is living
[1:59:44] your personal life right not allowing
[1:59:47] the Devil to get any Foo whole like in
[1:59:50] whatever the devil has established in
[1:59:52] our lives this should make us go and
[1:59:55] rededicate our lives to
[1:59:57] God Amen and fight with everything
[2:00:01] that's within us because we ain't just
[2:00:04] affecting ourselves we're affecting our
[2:00:06] brother and our sister
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:12] amen I'm going try to bring this down to
[2:00:14] a closed
[2:00:18] sentence he he says and they
[2:00:21] slayed he says the amorites the Hittites
[2:00:23] but there wasn't one her among among any
[2:00:26] of them until sin came into the camp and
[2:00:29] when achen took that Babylonian garment
[2:00:31] and that gold wedge and hid it under his
[2:00:33] Camp then the next day they lost and
[2:00:35] brother brandom say 16 but it was 36 he
[2:00:38] says stop stop wait a minute there's
[2:00:40] something wrong something's wrong here
[2:00:42] we're going to call a seven days fast he
[2:00:45] says God made us a promise he says there
[2:00:48] would be nothing hurt us our enemies
[2:00:50] will fall at our feet and there's
[2:00:52] something wrong here something went
[2:00:54] wrong somewhere brother brandham says
[2:00:56] why did they die he says innocent man
[2:00:58] because one man stepped out of
[2:01:01] line he says you see the reason this
[2:01:04] needs to be
[2:01:06] taught yes sir I got a few things I want
[2:01:08] to share with share with you Saints
[2:01:10] listen the success of the body of Christ
[2:01:13] is dependent upon
[2:01:15] this and God is the father of us all you
[2:01:19] understand that so the Holy Ghost is
[2:01:21] coming through the land because when it
[2:01:23] was time God came down he anointed
[2:01:25] Joshua and God weave through the whole
[2:01:28] group of Israel until it brought it
[2:01:30] right down to Ain and when it brought it
[2:01:32] down to achen he says give glory to God
[2:01:34] son he says what have you
[2:01:37] done what is the purpose of the gift
[2:01:40] Saints to keep the church clean yes sir
[2:01:44] you understand listen now I'm telling
[2:01:46] you by the grace of God I believe what
[2:01:48] our prophet said by the spirit of God
[2:01:50] and those gifts are are listen now I
[2:01:53] believe those gifts are coming into view
[2:01:55] yes sir believe it yes sir where the
[2:01:57] Holy Ghost is going to anoint ordain
[2:02:00] individuals with the gifts that he's put
[2:02:02] into their souls you understand me and
[2:02:05] as they yield themselves to God God is
[2:02:07] going to bring help and health to every
[2:02:11] local assembly he's going to push those
[2:02:14] evil spirits right out they ain't going
[2:02:16] to have no place to hide you talk about
[2:02:18] another book of act
[2:02:21] God had to set the tone he had to let
[2:02:24] everybody know if you join yourself with
[2:02:26] this you better come clean in the New
[2:02:29] Testament once God made an example of
[2:02:32] Anan and Safara people were scared to
[2:02:35] come to church they ain't going to come
[2:02:36] to church any kind of way it made them
[2:02:39] straighten up pray him say you
[2:02:41] understand what I'm
[2:02:42] saying Glory
[2:02:45] Hallelujah once God made an example of
[2:02:47] aan he said give glory to to God Son why
[2:02:50] have you done this he said now because
[2:02:52] you troubled Israel we're going to
[2:02:54] trouble you listen to this he was
[2:02:58] connected with his
[2:03:01] family 36 men that wouldn't in his
[2:03:04] family died but now as a repercussion of
[2:03:07] what he did God call him and his family
[2:03:10] to be stoned and
[2:03:14] burned his wife didn't take it his
[2:03:18] children didn't take naked but their dad
[2:03:21] caused the whole family to
[2:03:25] die they were
[2:03:36] connected he says when we bring the sick
[2:03:38] up before us and they fail to be healed
[2:03:42] we need to call a solemn fast he says
[2:03:45] call an assembly something's wrong
[2:03:47] somewhere God made the promise God's got
[2:03:50] to stick to that promise and he will do
[2:03:56] it a few more things and we'll be done
[2:03:59] Saints everybody's
[2:04:02] okay I love
[2:04:04] you I mean
[2:04:07] that drove nine hours nine hours of
[2:04:13] Love

[2:04:20] praise
[2:04:22] God what is the works of God that's the
[2:04:24] name of the message brother brandom says
[2:04:26] my finger could never take the place of
[2:04:28] my ear no matter how much it tried
[2:04:31] neither could my mouth take the place of
[2:04:33] my eye he says but each member knows
[2:04:36] what it can do and he says this and all
[2:04:39] of them coordinating together makes the
[2:04:42] body
[2:04:43] move if this church can only see that if
[2:04:47] you can only see that it takes takes
[2:04:49] coordination it takes
[2:04:52] cooperation with all the body of
[2:04:58] Christ now the message humble
[2:05:02] ourself when I read when the Lord helped
[2:05:05] me to I done heard that message I don't
[2:05:06] know how many times but he honed me in
[2:05:08] on this one piece right here and this is
[2:05:11] actually where did this was the
[2:05:13] beginnings of this particular
[2:05:15] inspiration here
[2:05:17] Saints brother says in paragraph 73 of
[2:05:21] humble thyself he says I was thinking
[2:05:23] here listen to this very carefully now I
[2:05:26] was thinking here of one of of one
[2:05:28] little illustration to back up what he
[2:05:30] said he says now we look at this watch
[2:05:33] he says to find out what time it is
[2:05:35] unless that every instrument in that
[2:05:37] watch is
[2:05:39] coordinating he says one with the other
[2:05:41] we'll never know the correct time he
[2:05:44] says is that right he says and that
[2:05:46] takes all of us all together if we want
[2:05:51] to see the third pool really do
[2:05:54] something for
[2:05:55] God he says it's
[2:06:02] coordination with every one of us
[2:06:07] together to Humble ourselves before God
[2:06:11] confess our wrong and pray and believe
[2:06:15] God for these things and we want to see
[2:06:18] the Third pull come and do something for
[2:06:20] God he said it takes
[2:06:25] coordination amen Heavenly

[2:12:41] help for his
[2:12:47] wife
[2:12:50] he caused it to come on his
[2:12:52] wife Jesus the doctor couldn't help with
[2:12:57] that it took the Holy Ghost through a
[2:13:01] Divine
[2:13:03] physician to come down in the midst of
[2:13:05] the people and God LED that couple you
[2:13:10] understand they were children of God God
[2:13:14] LED that couple to come to that
[2:13:15] particular service and the Holy Ghost
[2:13:18] wasn't going to let them leave without
[2:13:19] being dealt with so that light went and
[2:13:22] hung over
[2:13:23] her other people needed help but God
[2:13:26] wanted to deal with this
[2:13:28] situation can we say praise the Lord
[2:13:31] Saints he says you believe that isn't
[2:13:34] that right he says I can't see you from
[2:13:35] here and you know that but you're
[2:13:37] carrying cigars in your pocket in the
[2:13:40] front he couldn't even see the God he
[2:13:43] says that's right lay the things out and
[2:13:45] put your hand over on your wife tell God
[2:13:48] that you are through with that kind of
[2:13:50] stuff listen and you will go home well
[2:13:53] and you and you and your wife will get
[2:13:58] well Jesus that little habit he was
[2:14:02] connected to his wife's heart condition
[2:14:05] he was the cause and he was The
[2:14:16] Cure this last one Saints and I'mma to
[2:14:19] close on this there was a young girl
[2:14:22] this message here is called the greatest
[2:14:23] battle ever
[2:14:25] fought it was a young girl who was
[2:14:28] diagnosed with hodkin
[2:14:31] disease it's a very dangerous
[2:14:34] disease she was dealing with it it would
[2:14:36] appear it would cause formations in
[2:14:38] certain areas of her body and then those
[2:14:41] and I'll just read a little piece here a
[2:14:43] little girl come here he says not long
[2:14:45] ago from high school her mother called
[2:14:47] me up said brother Brandon my girls got
[2:14:49] hodkin disease that's cancer forms and
[2:14:52] lumps and the doctors took a piece from
[2:14:55] a break on her throat and that's a
[2:14:58] demon in demonology the prophet showed
[2:15:01] how demons because they don't have their
[2:15:03] own body once they get into the human
[2:15:05] body they start making all these strange
[2:15:08] formations right that was a devil inside
[2:15:11] of her daughter amen watch this he says
[2:15:14] that's cancer forming lumps and the
[2:15:16] doctors took a piece from the break over
[2:15:17] her throat on her throat sent it away
[2:15:20] and it was perfectly Harkins disease he
[2:15:22] said the next one breaks may break over
[2:15:24] her heart when it does she's gone said
[2:15:27] she hasn't got the way they're breaking
[2:15:29] she's got anywhere about 3 months to
[2:15:31] live the mother said what shall I do
[2:15:33] send her back to school he said let her
[2:15:35] go because she'll probably go suddenly
[2:15:38] she'll Pro she'll go probably suddenly
[2:15:40] and said this uh just let her go on and
[2:15:42] live a normal life and and she can as
[2:15:45] she can don't tell her nothing about it
[2:15:47] so so the lady said to me what must I
[2:15:51] do the son of man rising with healing in
[2:15:54] his
[2:15:55] wings my God I said bring her up uh

[2:16:02] line and I said you come with her I felt
[2:16:06] the little funny

[2:16:11] was causing this
[2:16:14] disease he says and when the little girl
[2:16:16] came by that morning with blue looking
[2:16:18] lips and makeup he says as a school has
[2:16:21] them and the little thing come by I

[2:23:45] a more perfect
[2:23:48] sermon uh as we enter into this time of
[2:23:52] fasting and um you know sometimes
[2:23:55] fasting just becomes a um
[2:24:00] tradition um and we don't want it to be
[2:24:02] that way we we need to approach this
[2:24:04] with uh the right
[2:24:06] heart uh and um just the way that the
[2:24:09] Lord LED
[2:24:10] brother MB this morning just feel like
[2:24:13] this is just a time for us to really
[2:24:15] think about rededicating our lives Liv
[2:24:17] to the Lord and um just just I think the
[2:24:22] Holy Spirit was just too too
[2:24:24] perfect what I heard the Holy Ghost say
[2:24:27] today in your cell
[2:24:30] phone if there is anybody in your cell
[2:24:33] phone that you can't put their name to
[2:24:36] it it need to be
[2:24:39] deleted not next
[2:24:43] week it's got to happen
[2:24:45] today and um I mean you um God God has
[2:24:50] spoken this place uh and uh anything
[2:24:53] that you might be hiding any secret sin
[2:24:55] this is a time where you Lord I'm sorry
[2:24:59] uh forgive me uh it's a time of
[2:25:02] repentance uh because you don't want to
[2:25:04] see anybody hindered from you know
[2:25:06] getting what they need from God uh we
[2:25:08] got sister Capers out there Desiring to

[2:25:13] out to see them the other day and you
[2:25:14] know she's she had some good days some
[2:25:16] bad days and I think on next Saturday
[2:25:19] she'll be 82 years old uh but what I've
[2:25:22] learned is that God did not put a age
[2:25:25] limit on
[2:25:28] healing we don't think in our mind well
[2:25:30] she 82 no no no no God still want he
[2:25:32] says my will for her to be in good
[2:25:34] health and to prosper even as a soul
