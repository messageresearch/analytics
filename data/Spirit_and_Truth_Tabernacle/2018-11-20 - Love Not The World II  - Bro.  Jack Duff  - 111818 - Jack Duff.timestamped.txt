[1:05:25] and a school and some other stuff and
[1:05:30] and I just want you to be praying for us
[1:05:33] because you know we that the negotiation
[1:05:37] process is quite challenging but just

[1:22:08] amen god is good god is good all right I
[1:22:12] want to I'm just reading one scripture
[1:22:14] and
[1:22:15] we did not finish our thought from the
[1:22:19] last time I spoke on this subject of
[1:22:22] love not the world and and I'm not even
[1:22:25] sure if I'm gonna finish my thought
[1:22:27] today but I will go as far as I can and
[1:22:30] then you know from there the Lord has us
[1:22:33] to give a little more than we'll do that
[1:22:34] but I do want to try to try to take this
[1:22:37] a little further
[1:22:38] amen on today lets us stand and let's
[1:22:42] reach just one scripture have a word of
[1:22:44] Prayer and go from there
[1:22:51] this is out of first John chapter 2
[1:22:53] verse 15 first John 2 and verse 15
[1:23:00] praise the Lord says look not the world
[1:23:10] neither the things that are in the world
[1:23:14] If any man love the world the love of
[1:23:17] the father is not in him a man let's
[1:23:23] pray father we thank you for your word
[1:23:26] thank you for them the ability to read
[1:23:29] it but it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:23:31] anoint what we've read to give us
[1:23:33] clarity and understanding so father we
[1:23:35] could walk clearly amen
[1:23:38] in the revelation of what you have for
[1:23:41] us we pray God that you a dis minister
[1:23:43] to each and every heart thank you for
[1:23:44] your anointing that's been in this place
[1:23:45] thus far and how we thought your
[1:23:47] presence and my you it's just amazing
[1:23:52] Lord that and sometimes when you come in
[1:23:55] it just makes it seem like like it was
[1:23:58] last night full of people but father we
[1:24:00] we we feel your anointing here today and
[1:24:03] we know that you're making a difference
[1:24:04] amen and our gathering so if you weren't
[1:24:07] here it wouldn't be worth our coming but
[1:24:09] we know that you are here now take
[1:24:10] control over the thought that's being
[1:24:12] presented here today to the people we
[1:24:15] take control of every spirit that's
[1:24:16] against your spirit and we cast it down
[1:24:18] now and pray that we receive from heaven
[1:24:21] it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god
[1:24:24] bless you can be seen
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:30] so we are talking about this if you
[1:24:35] could just brother Jared maybe lower the
[1:24:39] the house just a little bit there a man
[1:24:43] the we're talking about this love the
[1:24:46] world and what I wanted to I mean we you
[1:24:52] know here you know I mentioned this you
[1:24:54] know when we first open this up and
[1:24:56] start ministering on it here John is
[1:25:01] telling us love not the world neither
[1:25:03] the things of the world that are in the
[1:25:06] world
[1:25:06] If any man love the world the love of
[1:25:08] the father is not in him and as we're
[1:25:10] looking at that but we also notice over
[1:25:14] in John 3:16 Amen it's written that for
[1:25:18] God so loved the world that He gave His
[1:25:21] only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:25:23] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:25:26] have everlasting life and when I look at
[1:25:27] that these two scriptures and compare
[1:25:29] them my question is now if God so loved
[1:25:33] the world and then we get told love not
[1:25:35] the world what world is God talking
[1:25:38] about which world is he is the one that
[1:25:41] he loved which ones is he telling us not
[1:25:43] to love and you know so we start going a
[1:25:45] little deeper in Scripture in Hebrews 1
[1:25:48] and verse 1 through 3 tells us God who
[1:25:51] at sundry times and in divers manners
[1:25:53] spake in time past unto the father's by
[1:25:55] the prophets hath in these last days
[1:25:58] spoken unto us by his son he says whom
[1:26:01] he hath appointed heir of all things by
[1:26:04] whom also he made the world a man he
[1:26:09] made the world's Hebrews 1 he made the
[1:26:13] world's in verse 3 here in Hebrews 1
[1:26:15] says who being the brightness of his
[1:26:17] glory and the Express image of his
[1:26:20] person and upholding all things by the
[1:26:24] word of his power when he when he had
[1:26:26] made when he had by himself purged our
[1:26:28] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[1:26:30] Majesty on high so there in verse 2 we
[1:26:32] can see that Amen there are whirls amen
[1:26:36] so when we when we when we look at this
[1:26:38] that God so loved though
[1:26:40] well we got to find out which world you
[1:26:42] know is talking about because there are
[1:26:44] worlds now also look over here in
[1:26:46] Colossians 1:16 just the kind of a man
[1:26:49] kind of clinched this praise the Lord
[1:26:52] says Colossians 1:16 says for by him
[1:26:55] we're all things created that are in
[1:26:58] heaven and that are in earth visible and
[1:27:02] invisible hallelujah all things were
[1:27:07] created by him that are in heaven and
[1:27:10] that are in earth oh my god
[1:27:13] now if we just really looked at that so
[1:27:15] really in heaven a man I mentioned to
[1:27:18] y'all before brother Branham even
[1:27:20] brought this out to us that there's like
[1:27:21] three areas you know even even in he
[1:27:25] called it the region of the blest you
[1:27:27] know and then he broke it down into
[1:27:28] three areas and then he also called the
[1:27:31] region of the loss which was a part of
[1:27:32] the underworld and he broke that down
[1:27:34] into three areas right so here we're
[1:27:36] looking at this Amen says all things
[1:27:38] were created that are in heaven and that
[1:27:41] are in earth and even dimensions that we
[1:27:45] talked about here right on the earth
[1:27:47] glory to God your cell phone is
[1:27:49] operating a different dimension amen
[1:27:52] when you receive email amen
[1:27:54] a text message or whatever that's
[1:27:57] operating in a different dimension and
[1:28:00] God made that dimension hallelujah Satan
[1:28:04] uses it but God made it do you know amen
[1:28:07] the same way that a devil can attack you
[1:28:10] and angel can visit you right hey
[1:28:15] hallelujah amen sometimes when you
[1:28:17] trying to figure out why you can't go to
[1:28:19] sleep and why you came this and why you
[1:28:21] can't that's why I mention to you put on
[1:28:23] a tape glory to God let the prophets
[1:28:26] voice just play that atmosphere because
[1:28:28] it drives out the demons hallelujah
[1:28:31] you're gonna either win by going to
[1:28:33] sleep or you're gonna get the words one
[1:28:36] of the you're gonna win no matter what
[1:28:38] if you just put on a tape right
[1:28:39] hallelujah but by understanding this
[1:28:42] scripture here it's telling us that for
[1:28:44] by him we're all things created that are
[1:28:47] in heaven and that are in earth visible
[1:28:49] and invisible whether they be Thrones
[1:28:54] or dominions or principalities or powers
[1:28:57] all things were created by him and for
[1:29:01] him hallelujah so now we're kind of
[1:29:05] getting a little it meant we want to go
[1:29:06] a little deeper as I mentioned to your
[1:29:09] last last time I preached this it's very
[1:29:12] easy when we look at the Scriptures they
[1:29:14] love not the world neither the things of
[1:29:16] the world it's very easy just to kind of
[1:29:18] stop that you know the way that we dress
[1:29:20] and the way that we present ourselves
[1:29:22] now don't get me wrong I think that's
[1:29:24] extremely important
[1:29:25] amen I know I feel like holiness is
[1:29:28] being redefined or trying to be
[1:29:32] redefined right I mean a lot of people
[1:29:35] try trying to redefine the soul in
[1:29:37] satara it's a it's a matter the heart
[1:29:39] actually it is and if you had something
[1:29:42] in your heart it would be expressed on
[1:29:45] the outside right if it was in your
[1:29:48] heart right but but you know I think
[1:29:51] that people you know let me um I'm I got
[1:29:54] I got a I got a say a couple things here
[1:29:56] I told you how Satan a man was in the
[1:30:00] Garden of Eden and Eve what brother
[1:30:02] Brandt says she peeked at the world
[1:30:04] peeked at the world now I wonder how can
[1:30:08] Eve she wasn't dealing with what y'all
[1:30:10] dealing with right she wasn't dealing
[1:30:11] with Amen some some magazine and getting
[1:30:14] a style from a magazine right she wants
[1:30:17] she wasn't dealing with peer pressure
[1:30:18] Amen in school she wasn't dealing with
[1:30:21] you know things on it I mean people
[1:30:22] inviting you to happy hour on the job
[1:30:24] huh Eve weren't going through anything
[1:30:27] like that
[1:30:28] how do EVP at the world amen and in the
[1:30:33] ending Garden of Eden it was just even
[1:30:35] was Adams a bunch of animals but hearing
[1:30:38] a serpent I'm not about a devil begin to
[1:30:40] present a certain conversation to Eve
[1:30:42] and when she began to open up her
[1:30:45] spiritual womb hallelujah amen to that
[1:30:48] conversation do you realize Eve to
[1:30:51] compete at the world in order to and
[1:30:55] when you do the same thing that they
[1:30:58] when you open up your spiritual wound to
[1:31:00] gossip when you open up your spiritual
[1:31:03] womb to nonesense
[1:31:05] you don't realize it
[1:31:06] to begin to take a peek at the world I
[1:31:09] know you're pressing rights I know
[1:31:10] you're looking right but when you open
[1:31:13] yourself up to these things you begin to
[1:31:16] be there for all I want to just read a
[1:31:20] scripture that just really blessed me
[1:31:22] turn the galatians 5 verse 7 and 8 you
[1:31:25] know a brother brother Paul hit it last
[1:31:27] night
[1:31:27] you can't talk to everybody you can't
[1:31:32] not not when they not when they've been
[1:31:34] influenced y'all y'all you know can you
[1:31:38] can you trust a drunk person right when
[1:31:42] they talking under the influence can you
[1:31:45] trust anything that they say right when
[1:31:48] they when there's an influence Amen you
[1:31:50] got you got to be careful you can not
[1:31:52] hold that he made you take it well they
[1:31:55] said they say they were drunk when they
[1:31:57] said it
[1:31:57] amen it won't hold up even in the court
[1:32:00] of law they were drunk they were a man
[1:32:02] they were under the influence and if you
[1:32:06] can't trust somebody naturally that is
[1:32:08] under the influence then you also can't
[1:32:11] trust somebody spiritually that is under
[1:32:15] the influence of another spirit but you
[1:32:19] have to be the one to recognize that
[1:32:22] they they aren't they under the
[1:32:23] influence where are they getting their
[1:32:26] inspiration from what world are they
[1:32:30] getting their inspiration from the
[1:32:32] humble role or is it coming from the
[1:32:35] above world you can tell which world is
[1:32:38] coming from right and in here to here to
[1:32:40] here what the skip to say laughs not the
[1:32:43] world all right all right all right I'm
[1:32:47] just trying to win him I think they
[1:32:50] trying to win you huh okay man I'm gonna
[1:32:54] you know I'm Eve when she took a peep at
[1:32:57] the world right brother branham said you
[1:32:59] know when Satan beginning to talk to her
[1:33:01] about knowledge she just had to take a
[1:33:02] little peep at the world just a little
[1:33:05] peep so I mean just just just opening
[1:33:09] herself up to some of the stuff that the
[1:33:10] devil is trying to present to her cause
[1:33:12] her to get off track and if we're not
[1:33:15] careful a man will get off track as well
[1:33:17] real fast you forget where God brought
[1:33:20] you from
[1:33:20] you forget what God did for you right
[1:33:23] amen because you don't fell in love with
[1:33:25] the world
[1:33:26] hallelujah can I can I just read a
[1:33:28] scripture Galatians 5 give me this I was
[1:33:31] reading this recently verse 7 give me
[1:33:34] first seven amen
[1:33:37] verse seven here in Galatians five it
[1:33:39] says this ye did run well I just want to
[1:33:44] talk to you you did run well who but but
[1:33:47] notice notice notice who not what who
[1:33:53] that this is Eve right we can see her in
[1:33:56] the scripture
[1:33:57] she was running well but who hindered
[1:33:59] huh whose doctor when she took a peep at
[1:34:02] the world who who did hinder you that
[1:34:05] she should not obey the truth I like
[1:34:08] that I like that because see sometimes
[1:34:10] it's the conversations that we get in
[1:34:11] that's pulling us from a mental love for
[1:34:14] God oh my don't let the devil so DS type
[1:34:18] of seeds in your spiritual wound be
[1:34:20] careful watch that devil hallelujah
[1:34:24] somebody now I want you to know
[1:34:26] something that ye did run well who not
[1:34:30] what but who did hinder you that she
[1:34:34] should not obey the truth now look at
[1:34:35] verse eight I love this because it
[1:34:39] doesn't say this persuasion Oh glory to
[1:34:43] God so who did hinder you and you know I
[1:34:45] often times you want in a man everyday
[1:34:48] what they was serving God they would in
[1:34:49] stay with that but but somebody came
[1:34:50] along and said something somebody came
[1:34:53] along and and indeed something and and
[1:34:55] when they did it the Bible say this
[1:34:57] persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:35:00] calleth you amen not of him that counsel
[1:35:03] that persuasion didn't come from God oh
[1:35:06] my can I go a little further that
[1:35:09] conversation didn't come from God but it
[1:35:13] come from another room the underworld
[1:35:15] was trying to pull you down and we don't
[1:35:20] realize that that sometime the delicate
[1:35:22] I mean even Jesus recognized that the
[1:35:26] devil was anointing Peter a close friend
[1:35:30] of his a man a man that he had just
[1:35:32] given the key
[1:35:33] to the kingdom but in a few more verses
[1:35:36] he said get behind me Satan man on my
[1:35:40] Peter could have took it efficiently
[1:35:41] you're trying to call me the devil no
[1:35:42] I'm calling you the devil I'm just
[1:35:44] saying that the devil has anointed you
[1:35:46] that thought that you just present it
[1:35:48] came from the devil that didn't come
[1:35:50] from God and if you keep yielding
[1:35:53] yourself to those type of thoughts I'm
[1:35:55] not gonna be able to talk with you
[1:35:58] alright let's go on a little further
[1:36:01] here a man I want to just make sure that
[1:36:04] we're we're getting this I'll go back to
[1:36:07] this quote that I read oh no no no
[1:36:09] actually I want to bring in another
[1:36:11] quote last Sunday man brother Lusaka
[1:36:14] share this this is not a Feast of
[1:36:15] Trumpets this was the last quote on the
[1:36:17] last page but he shared this quote
[1:36:19] awesome and I gotta add that one too you
[1:36:21] know my thought here the Feast of
[1:36:23] Trumpets he says this the hour that
[1:36:26] we're living the ecclesiastical of
[1:36:29] spirits uniting together now and
[1:36:31] bringing them all to this big one
[1:36:33] slaughter to blot out it's already in
[1:36:36] writing here in this nation now that
[1:36:39] these churches has to be closed unless
[1:36:41] you're with the organization it's a
[1:36:44] union
[1:36:44] it's a boycott just like the mark of the
[1:36:47] beast and he goes on saying now you see
[1:36:49] what the Beast is don't you it's a power
[1:36:52] a power ecclesiastical power Jesus said
[1:36:57] it'll be so close like the real thing
[1:36:59] in a deceive the very elect the very
[1:37:02] elected if it was possible but this is
[1:37:04] the part that I wanted to get but he
[1:37:06] promised to have something here for us
[1:37:08] in that day that we wouldn't be deceived
[1:37:11] and that's the word and Christ to make
[1:37:15] it manifest to us and this is real
[1:37:17] important he said there are supernatural
[1:37:20] Devils unseen to the eye but you can see
[1:37:25] what they're doing a supernatural devil
[1:37:29] that is unseen to the eye but you can
[1:37:32] see what he's doing right so so this is
[1:37:34] why this why we got to understand
[1:37:35] sometimes when a man people are trying
[1:37:38] to get you to peep at the world a man
[1:37:41] it's a supernatural devil amen anointing
[1:37:45] them to say what
[1:37:46] saying Amen to get you off your course
[1:37:49] oh my god
[1:37:51] and I won't I want you to I want you to
[1:37:53] be very very careful here look we ain't
[1:37:55] got to be worried about our boss and our
[1:38:01] co-workers people that don't know
[1:38:03] nothing about the Lord right we ain't
[1:38:05] got to really be worried about them
[1:38:06] deceiving us they're not going to
[1:38:08] deceive us that's not gonna happen right
[1:38:10] I mean what what you want to just try to
[1:38:12] influence them where you got to worry
[1:38:14] about the deception is right within the
[1:38:15] family right within the church right
[1:38:19] that's where you got to really worry
[1:38:20] about the deception you gotta you got a
[1:38:22] watch spirits that will have naught
[1:38:23] people there oh my god hallelujah Amen
[1:38:29] there there's this um this little let's
[1:38:33] see here uh another scripture that I
[1:38:35] wanna yeah I'll bring it out in a little
[1:38:36] bit
[1:38:37] amen but so we're watching out because
[1:38:40] here the supernatural Devils that's
[1:38:41] unseen to the eye see they living in a
[1:38:44] different world right unseen to the eye
[1:38:46] but however you can see the
[1:38:47] manifestation of what those Devils are
[1:38:49] doing you might not see the devil you
[1:38:51] just see the manifestation and when you
[1:38:53] see the manifestation you know it's
[1:38:54] something that you got to avoid alright
[1:38:57] let's go on a little further amen
[1:38:59] so he says this in a message God's power
[1:39:01] to transform it says just step over and
[1:39:04] I'm a paragraph 126 amen and God's power
[1:39:07] to transform he says just step over on
[1:39:09] that side one bit let that creeper just
[1:39:13] get in one little hole around the shuk
[1:39:15] of that corn one time watch what takes
[1:39:17] place the corn is gone oh yeah it's done
[1:39:20] got him and that's the way it'll do it
[1:39:22] it'll do it every time Eve had to take
[1:39:25] just one peep at the world and it goes
[1:39:27] on say and let me say something to you
[1:39:29] brothers sister in first John the second
[1:39:32] chapter and the 15 verse we can read it
[1:39:34] if you wish to the Bible says if we love
[1:39:37] the world or the things of the world
[1:39:40] it's because the love of God is not even
[1:39:43] in us now the Prophet is quoting this he
[1:39:45] says now the world there is not earth so
[1:39:50] we're looking at that scripture the word
[1:39:51] love not the world it's not just talking
[1:39:53] about the earth and and this is why I
[1:39:55] was saying last time we brought this
[1:39:57] this goes a little beyond where Penn
[1:40:00] comes took us right Pentecost can only
[1:40:02] talk about the way we dress but this
[1:40:04] goes a little further beyond just the
[1:40:05] way we dress and yes we still need the
[1:40:08] dress only I believe that but this goes
[1:40:10] a little bit further a man just don't
[1:40:12] stop it then the way we dress we gotta
[1:40:14] watch what we listen to and then we got
[1:40:17] a watch amen what we feed all hallelujah
[1:40:21] spirit glory to God they say now that
[1:40:24] the word there's not the earth it's a
[1:40:27] it's a Greek word
[1:40:28] it's cosmos which means the world's
[1:40:31] order a man it's a Greek word which
[1:40:34] means the world's order now brother
[1:40:36] branham also gives us a little bit more
[1:40:37] clarity even on that on the world order
[1:40:39] now I'm going to bring two different
[1:40:41] thoughts on this world order but I'm
[1:40:43] going to use this first one they just
[1:40:44] given us here amen because you know a
[1:40:48] definition I mean I'm sorry I work and
[1:40:50] have multiple definitions hallelujah
[1:40:56] can I just tell you about that word
[1:40:57] cosmos what it means it has multiple
[1:40:59] definitions one of the definitions for
[1:41:02] the word conversation and a harmonious
[1:41:06] arrangement or constitution order a
[1:41:09] government I think you might like my
[1:41:11] brother Jack what is that an apt and
[1:41:14] harmonious arrangement or Constitution
[1:41:17] order government that's
[1:41:18] denominationalism right when we try and
[1:41:21] establish denominationalism Amen you
[1:41:23] actually are taken of the world order oh
[1:41:26] my if you if you wanna if you wanna
[1:41:29] hallelujah it may you I mean went went
[1:41:31] went went when Israel decided that they
[1:41:35] wanted a king brother branham said they
[1:41:37] want it to be like the world hallelujah
[1:41:41] when you want a bishop rather than a
[1:41:43] prophet
[1:41:45] you want to be like the world
[1:41:49] hallelujah somebody it mean you want a
[1:41:51] great preach it and work than just a
[1:41:53] prophet and what the Prophet said you
[1:41:55] want to be like the world and the Bible
[1:41:58] say love not the world lot of things
[1:42:02] that are in the world because the love
[1:42:04] of God is not in you so see if you love
[1:42:06] those type of things something wrong
[1:42:07] with your experience hallelujah another
[1:42:10] another definition of this word caused
[1:42:13] most is they aren't godly multitude the
[1:42:17] whole mass of man alienated from God and
[1:42:20] therefore hostile to the cause of Christ
[1:42:22] amen so we shouldn't want to hang around
[1:42:25] with people that are actually hostile to
[1:42:27] the cause of Christ amen I might as well
[1:42:31] just say these things if you got a
[1:42:33] desire to hang with people like that
[1:42:35] something is wrong with your experience
[1:42:40] love not the world what we supposed to
[1:42:43] love everybody love not the world so you
[1:42:47] better find a balance in all these
[1:42:48] states don't let people trick you with
[1:42:51] scripture you know the devil used the
[1:42:53] scripture gets Eve don't let people
[1:42:56] trick you with the Bible well you know
[1:42:59] I'm just not sure if you don't know just
[1:43:01] don't talk to him because any time you
[1:43:04] might get a look confused God is not the
[1:43:06] author of confusion God is not the
[1:43:10] author that you know the devil trying to
[1:43:12] trick you when you get into something
[1:43:14] well ain't we supposed to love everybody
[1:43:16] yeah I mean God look God love God love
[1:43:20] the sinner but hate the sin all right
[1:43:23] hey man yeah we love everybody but I
[1:43:24] don't like the spirit that's dwelling in
[1:43:26] you and operating in you right now it's
[1:43:28] supernatural devil and you know you
[1:43:31] don't realize the supernatural Devils
[1:43:33] coming after them he already got them
[1:43:35] who the supernatural devil coming after
[1:43:37] you all right let's go see the ungodly
[1:43:42] multitude the whole mass of men
[1:43:44] alienated from God and therefore a
[1:43:46] hostile to the cause of Christ now let
[1:43:50] me also give you another definition it's
[1:43:51] we and this one I can't really get into
[1:43:54] this because this is really where I want
[1:43:56] to go with this scripture when I told
[1:43:59] you all the write down you know when I
[1:44:02] just read the script I say just write
[1:44:03] down you know what what does that mean
[1:44:05] that you love not the world what does
[1:44:06] that mean to you but but we didn't read
[1:44:08] the rest of the scripture and today I
[1:44:11] can't even go to the rest of the
[1:44:13] scripture but this definition goes to
[1:44:15] the rest of that scripture and hopefully
[1:44:17] you know next week I'll be able to kind
[1:44:19] of go into that part just to show you
[1:44:21] because the rest of the scripture said
[1:44:23] this for all that is in the world that's
[1:44:25] verse 16 for all
[1:44:27] in the world the lust of the flesh and
[1:44:29] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:44:32] life is not of the Father but is of the
[1:44:35] world oh love not the world or the
[1:44:38] things of the world and now we find out
[1:44:41] what is in the world the thing that's in
[1:44:43] the world is the lust of the flesh right
[1:44:46] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:44:49] life now when we when we when we when we
[1:44:52] get into that we're going to see how
[1:44:55] that's exactly what Nimrod wanted right
[1:45:02] he wanted the lust of the flesh lust of
[1:45:05] the eyes and the pride of life
[1:45:07] hallelujah that's exactly what Nimrod
[1:45:10] run and that's why we got to be careful
[1:45:11] with that because the scripture is
[1:45:14] warning us of something here if we're
[1:45:16] chasing those things and not chasing God
[1:45:19] we're missing it all right
[1:45:23] amen God got to be first place God got
[1:45:27] to be first place right now let me read
[1:45:29] you this definition say world affairs
[1:45:31] the aggregate of things earthly the
[1:45:34] whole circle of earthly good endowments
[1:45:38] riches advantages pleasures etc which
[1:45:42] although Hollow and frail and fleeting
[1:45:45] stir desire seduced from God and our
[1:45:49] obstacles to the cause of Christ so here
[1:45:52] we are we're looking at this thing some
[1:45:54] of the things that are in the world are
[1:45:55] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:45:57] the pride of life of things that
[1:45:58] actually take you further from God they
[1:46:01] don't actually bring you closer to God
[1:46:03] but when you begin to lust after those
[1:46:05] things they take you further from God
[1:46:07] and what the Bible says that love not
[1:46:09] those things because if you start loving
[1:46:10] that it shows that the love of the
[1:46:12] father is not inside of you oh I know
[1:46:16] what I'm talking about this morning let
[1:46:18] me go on a little further I want to just
[1:46:21] try to drive this home if I can let me
[1:46:25] read this amen amen
[1:46:28] all right so uh I told you I want to
[1:46:34] bring two different definitions from
[1:46:36] what the prophets said about cosmos so
[1:46:38] hearing God's power to transform he says
[1:46:40] now
[1:46:41] and paragraph 128 says now the word
[1:46:43] there is not earth it's a Greek word
[1:46:47] it's cosmos which means the world's
[1:46:49] order if we love fascists this is this
[1:46:51] is one of his definitions if we love
[1:46:54] fashions of the earth the world if we
[1:46:57] love the trend of the date night now
[1:46:59] don't don't get the profit wrong here it
[1:47:01] ain't nothing wrong with looking nice
[1:47:03] ain't nothing wrong with looking nice
[1:47:05] there's nothing wrong with that at all I
[1:47:07] mean I think I think everybody should
[1:47:09] want to look nice aim that's that's
[1:47:11] great I think we're the spirit come in
[1:47:13] is that that's the only reason you come
[1:47:15] in the church uh-huh I'll come on y'all
[1:47:20] y'all in st. y'all wait talking to me
[1:47:22] right your reason for coming to church
[1:47:25] because you got to show everybody what
[1:47:27] you got what you look I mean oh man you
[1:47:29] can't wait for Sunday and you have a
[1:47:31] certain time that you want to walk
[1:47:33] through the door when you know everybody
[1:47:36] gonna be I mean we did that in Baptists
[1:47:38] right hey man you you you noticed a
[1:47:40] certain time that you walked through the
[1:47:42] door can I can I be honest
[1:47:44] oh my right a man if God bless you with
[1:47:49] a new vehicle you park it in a certain
[1:47:51] place huh right we park it so we want
[1:47:55] everybody to see this and sometimes not
[1:47:58] I want people to see my blessing
[1:48:00] sometimes it's a little pride behind
[1:48:02] that Oh glory to God right amen you get
[1:48:06] some new clothes special if it's Easter
[1:48:08] Sunday amen
[1:48:10] you come with the wrong intentions ain't
[1:48:14] no trouble again and then trust me if
[1:48:16] somebody hallelujah
[1:48:18] got a look too close to you and was in
[1:48:21] the spirit beginning it's not on your
[1:48:23] clothes your spirit change just like
[1:48:27] that it shows that you did not come with
[1:48:31] the right spirit
[1:48:31] you didn't even buy that in the right
[1:48:33] spirit huh right number with fashion but
[1:48:40] it's just the spirit that goes behind
[1:48:42] these things all right that's what
[1:48:44] that's what we talk about love not the
[1:48:46] world love not the world I'm not the
[1:48:47] world
[1:48:48] Oh God Oh God and if I could just you
[1:48:52] know also saying I know some of us we so
[1:48:55] so so sadiddy' if I can use that word

[1:49:18] daddy used to call it but he used to
[1:49:19] tell I ain't wearing them clothes see
[1:49:23] what I've seen see that's why we got to
[1:49:25] watch the spirits that that come with
[1:49:26] you know you know that spirits even on
[1:49:28] clothes it's spirits in everything that
[1:49:33] we do sometimes your sisters y'all don't
[1:49:35] realize some of the designers are the
[1:49:38] clothes that they met homosexual men
[1:49:43] right Amy and they want it they want to
[1:49:46] show certain parts of the body they want
[1:49:48] they want to try to push those parts of
[1:49:49] the body right I mean you got you got to
[1:49:52] watch these spirits that's behind it you
[1:49:54] just can't go running and getting
[1:49:55] everything it's a spirit there
[1:49:58] hallelujah
[1:49:59] you know can I just be honest you know
[1:50:02] it's certain even even even in our
[1:50:04] Christian faith sister sometimes there's
[1:50:07] certain skirts that that a sister can
[1:50:09] wear that's just as bad as pants
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:16] can I be honest see I'm a lord help me
[1:50:20] God you know it's just you know I want
[1:50:24] to be honest you gotta watch how it's
[1:50:26] cut right amen everything is not of God
[1:50:30] Amen it might hit your leg a certain way
[1:50:33] when you walk him oh my god and part of
[1:50:38] the skirt is high part of its low what
[1:50:41] part you think the man go see the part
[1:50:44] that's a low right you got you don't
[1:50:47] know I know I let me let me just be like
[1:50:49] this let me just let me just tell you
[1:50:50] like this as a sister you can't think
[1:50:53] like a man so that's why you might put
[1:50:56] it on you don't even think you know that
[1:50:58] ain't nothing wrong with that no a man
[1:51:00] sees something different in that keep it
[1:51:02] all covered you can't make it too short
[1:51:06] you can't make it too tight huh you
[1:51:09] can't make it too low same thing with
[1:51:12] brothers I said this before you gotta
[1:51:14] watch how you dress too come on somebody
[1:51:17] and then we still need this the
[1:51:20] difference I mean the a lotta stuff is
[1:51:22] anointed by the devil and we're going
[1:51:25] after the things that the devil's
[1:51:26] presented to us no but God given to us
[1:51:29] that style did not come from heaven that
[1:51:33] haircut didn't come from heaven huh that
[1:51:37] hairstyle didn't come from heaven
[1:51:39] it was the influence from another world
[1:51:41] the underworld right it's the truth
[1:51:45] anyhow glory to God seeing it now I'm
[1:51:49] giving you his definition because you
[1:51:51] know he said that that world there that
[1:51:54] word world in 1st John 2:15 love not the
[1:51:57] world he says the world there is the
[1:52:00] word there's not earth it's a Greek word
[1:52:02] is cosmos which means the world's order
[1:52:05] now he gives you even a little further
[1:52:07] you know definition here in this
[1:52:09] paragraph he says if we love fashions of
[1:52:11] the earth the world if we love the trend
[1:52:15] of the day if we think this is a
[1:52:18] wonderful time oh we have all these
[1:52:21] things if you think that is because your
[1:52:24] thinking is wrong right if you think
[1:52:27] that you have all these things if you
[1:52:28] say if you think
[1:52:30] because you're thinking it's wrong it's
[1:52:31] perverted by the devil oh my god your
[1:52:37] thoughts can be perverted by the devil
[1:52:39] it's say your thinking is wrong it is
[1:52:41] provided by the devil so if you love the
[1:52:44] world's order and the things of this
[1:52:47] present world is because the love of God
[1:52:49] is not even in you and you know I mean
[1:52:51] you as you just read that you can just
[1:52:53] think about Lot's wife she loved the
[1:52:55] world
[1:52:56] she loved the condition that she was
[1:52:58] living in she loved that more than death
[1:53:00] in the message she heard from an angel
[1:53:03] not wonder how many of us are really
[1:53:06] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:53:08] that's in our mix I mean sufficiently
[1:53:12] impressed that this word is enough of me
[1:53:15] God I find got nothing else I got the
[1:53:16] word can I just you know I just I just
[1:53:20] want I want to go a little further I
[1:53:21] want to try to get as far as I can here
[1:53:23] today here's another definition out of
[1:53:25] the message birth pains a man out of the
[1:53:28] message birth pains the Prophet talked
[1:53:32] about this cosmos this world order so
[1:53:33] now we know it deals with clothing that
[1:53:35] that's a part of the world order because
[1:53:37] we're going after the fashions and
[1:53:38] things of the world hallelujah that's
[1:53:40] wrong that's perverted from the devil
[1:53:42] and here another thing in birth pains he
[1:53:44] says this this is another definition
[1:53:46] said now let's just think for a minute
[1:53:48] never has the world had a messenger over
[1:53:50] the world
[1:53:51] we had finish Sankey's moody's finished
[1:53:53] Knox Calvin so forth all around the
[1:53:56] world messages to the church in these
[1:53:58] birth pains but never did we ever have a
[1:54:01] man going out with the International
[1:54:04] message until this day with his name
[1:54:06] ending in H am a b ra h am which is six
[1:54:12] letters a br aham is seven is seven
[1:54:18] letters we got one today name gra h am
[1:54:22] six letters and six is the number of the
[1:54:25] world right it says creation day when
[1:54:28] did the world ever have a man have a man
[1:54:32] down into it preaching down in the
[1:54:35] cosmos
[1:54:35] now there's another definition here a
[1:54:37] man preaching down in the cosmos down
[1:54:41] there in the world
[1:54:44] I'm they're calling the people out let
[1:54:46] me say repent repent perish or come out
[1:54:49] of it until this age gr aham look what
[1:54:53] he's doing
[1:54:54] preaching the word blinding the outside
[1:54:56] us Colin come out a messenger from God
[1:54:58] Jesus said that would take place just
[1:55:01] when the southern man will be revealed
[1:55:02] himself now that that's where that's at
[1:55:05] out there in the church orders world and
[1:55:08] they begin to hate the man for it now
[1:55:10] you know as I look at that so brother
[1:55:12] branham's telling us down in the
[1:55:13] denomination because Billy Graham gr
[1:55:15] aham he went amongst the denominational
[1:55:18] churches preaching the word right he and
[1:55:20] he had a message that I mean if you ever
[1:55:22] hurt one of his sermons on repentance
[1:55:24] you'd be ready to repent that man had
[1:55:27] the anointing for that right but look at
[1:55:29] how the Prophet drops that so I'll drop
[1:55:30] that on he kept putting it on gr aham
[1:55:34] six letters number of man going to the
[1:55:37] world but he never even introduced to
[1:55:40] the people that his name also ended in H
[1:55:43] a.m. it was BR a n H a.m. which was
[1:55:47] seven letters that wasn't going to the
[1:55:49] world that was going to the pride OH
[1:55:56] so if you love denomination then you
[1:56:02] love the world and guess what just
[1:56:05] against what the Bible say if you love
[1:56:07] the world I don't care how much they say
[1:56:10] what a there's no love down there if you
[1:56:14] love the world the love of God is not in
[1:56:18] you I didn't say that
[1:56:20] John said it I just preached it Lou yeah
[1:56:27] amen
[1:56:29] but here GRA H am went to the world and
[1:56:32] that was a messenger to the world but
[1:56:34] br8 in h am seven letters came to the
[1:56:38] pride I thank God for that
[1:56:41] now can we go on a little further
[1:56:43] smyrnaean church each stay with me here
[1:56:46] glory to God glory to God and I'm gonna
[1:56:49] hit just a couple more things here is
[1:56:52] this how tragic that was how tragic that
[1:56:55] was I'm in paragraph 123
[1:56:57] how tragic that was little did they
[1:57:00] realize that when they were asking God
[1:57:02] to let them be like the rest of the
[1:57:05] world they were rejecting him he talked
[1:57:09] about Israel right when they were David
[1:57:11] when they won a king right rather than a
[1:57:13] prophet to lead them
[1:57:14] and trust me I talked to y'all I talk to
[1:57:19] y'all I've tryin to let y'all know about
[1:57:20] this beer is that spirit of Nimrod that
[1:57:22] wanted to conquer certain things right
[1:57:25] he wanted to make a name for himself he
[1:57:27] had to go into certain he had I mean
[1:57:29] it's the same spirit today you can't
[1:57:31] make a name amongst the message people
[1:57:34] you're not gonna get enough exposure so
[1:57:37] you have to go into areas other churches
[1:57:40] play on certain stages preach on certain
[1:57:43] platforms in order to make a name behind
[1:57:46] everything that you saying is this
[1:57:49] spirit that loves the world you won't
[1:57:53] that's what pride of life popularity
[1:57:57] right people love popularity they want
[1:58:00] to be popular if this ain't the age for
[1:58:03] that if this thing the age whether I
[1:58:06] mean everybody want followers and you
[1:58:09] trying to get more followers you don't
[1:58:10] realize how the devil is anointing that
[1:58:15] hallelujah you're not trying to give and
[1:58:18] let me tell you something if you was
[1:58:20] given scripture nobody would follow you
[1:58:24] if you give in quotes personally nobody
[1:58:28] would follow you that lets you know that
[1:58:31] they not real friends or they not real
[1:58:34] followers oh my god my god watch it
[1:58:38] we've taken a people at the world
[1:58:39] alright stay with me I want I want to go
[1:58:42] a little further with this
[1:58:43] it says how tragic that was little did
[1:58:47] they realized that when they were asking
[1:58:49] God to let them be like the rest of the
[1:58:51] world they was they were rejecting him
[1:58:52] because God had ordained that his people
[1:58:55] act different from the world they are
[1:58:58] not of the world here's another one they
[1:59:00] don't look like the world and they don't
[1:59:04] act like the world so when we got folk
[1:59:07] in the church looking like the world we
[1:59:09] don't know which okay which side you
[1:59:10] won't
[1:59:13] you know the people in the church
[1:59:14] supposed to look different it's like
[1:59:18] we're not supposed to blend in with the
[1:59:20] rest of world when and when you leave
[1:59:21] Church you still supposed to be looking
[1:59:23] different hallelujah glory to God I mean
[1:59:27] I the pass over here next door he could
[1:59:30] tell the difference they come out one
[1:59:33] day and he told me said I went and told
[1:59:34] my church I want y'all sisters to dress
[1:59:38] like that he pointed over here dressed
[1:59:41] like them cuz he could tell the
[1:59:43] difference and then trust me every
[1:59:45] church that moves into this Plaza can
[1:59:47] see the difference y'all just stand up
[1:59:51] that's a testimony so we love not the
[1:59:55] world nor the things of the world you
[1:59:56] can't you can't you know you can't do
[1:59:58] that and say that you love God you don't
[2:00:00] you don't love God actually what you are
[2:00:03] you are infatuated with the idea you
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:10] you're infatuated with the idea of being
[2:00:14] in love but you don't love God right
[2:00:17] it's a it's a difference of being
[2:00:19] infatuated with the idea and then
[2:00:22] actually being in love hallelujah I'm
[2:00:25] coming back to this don't don't don't no
[2:00:26] I'm coming it says God ordained it as
[2:00:29] people act different from the world they
[2:00:31] are not of the world they don't look
[2:00:33] like the world and they don't act like
[2:00:34] the world they're crucified unto the
[2:00:36] world and the world is crucified unto
[2:00:38] them and it gives us a verse of
[2:00:41] scripture 2nd Corinthians 6 verse 17
[2:00:43] through 18 wherefore come out from among
[2:00:45] them and be ye separate saith the Lord
[2:00:50] that's not even since the Prophet that's
[2:00:53] not saying brother Jack come out be
[2:00:56] separate stance the Lord you are not
[2:00:59] shining light in a denominational Church
[2:01:03] and don't don't give me that I can see
[2:01:06] right through you not shining a light no
[2:01:08] denominational Church not not not every
[2:01:10] Sunday you go there the first Sunday you
[2:01:12] might be shining light but every time
[2:01:14] you go and you starting to knuckle down
[2:01:15] to what they doing you're like just when
[2:01:17] I you might be dressing different your
[2:01:20] dress don't tell the story
[2:01:22] Amen you might be dressing a little
[2:01:24] different

[2:05:16] let me let me finish this I I wanna I
[2:05:18] got something that I want to do here
[2:05:20] today listen but I got before I get that
[2:05:23] I gotta say sir a few things 2nd
[2:05:25] Corinthians 6:17 3 and wherefore company
[2:05:27] out come out from among them and be
[2:05:28] separate saith the Lord and touch not
[2:05:30] the unclean unclean thing and I will
[2:05:32] receive you and will be a father unto
[2:05:34] you and ye shall be my sons and
[2:05:36] daughters saith the Lord Almighty but
[2:05:38] you got to come out of there right you
[2:05:39] can't go into it and expect to be a son
[2:05:41] of God you got to come out amen now look
[2:05:44] at this when the church gets away from
[2:05:46] the word it will believe anything I
[2:05:50] wanted to just kind of drop a little
[2:05:52] something in on that alright and brother
[2:05:55] Branham goes on to talk about Eve how
[2:05:57] she made a statement when she had came I
[2:05:59] got a man from the Lord right she made
[2:06:02] that statement and and yes I mean in any
[2:06:05] birth God has to be involved in it but
[2:06:07] but but King did not come from God Cain
[2:06:11] came from a situation where Eve got
[2:06:14] herself by peeping into the world she
[2:06:16] got herself into a situation that she
[2:06:18] couldn't get herself out of and she got
[2:06:20] pregnant
[2:06:21] a man from from the serpent now a lot of
[2:06:24] people I was reading something on the
[2:06:25] internet and understand we people that
[2:06:29] follow brother Branham they call us
[2:06:30] brand of mites right and they say they
[2:06:32] say they believe that Eve had a sexual
[2:06:35] relationship with a snake no no that's
[2:06:39] not what we believe let me let me
[2:06:41] straighten that out let me straighten it
[2:06:43] out and then you can go back and read
[2:06:45] your Bible and find out that it wasn't a
[2:06:48] snake that was slithering on the ground
[2:06:50] she didn't have sex with an animal like
[2:06:53] that she did have sex with the serpent
[2:06:55] let me tell you something in case you
[2:06:58] didn't know is through sexual contact
[2:06:59] that that babies are born there's only
[2:07:04] one baby that was born without sexual
[2:07:06] contact that was the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:10] that was through the spoken word right
[2:07:12] but but all babies are born through
[2:07:15] sexual contact even in the animal
[2:07:17] kingdom animals are born through sexual
[2:07:20] contact truth any high right so it was
[2:07:25] not so
[2:07:26] snake on the ground it was a beast
[2:07:28] that's brutal two feet that looked like
[2:07:32] a man talk like a man walk like a man
[2:07:36] and that piece after it was involved in
[2:07:41] the fall that beast got cursed and if
[2:07:46] you don't believe me go back and look at
[2:07:47] Genesis 3 why was Adam cold into God's
[2:07:50] presence why was Eve cold until God's
[2:07:52] presence and why was the serpent called
[2:07:54] into God's presence he didn't call for
[2:07:57] no alligator he didn't he didn't call
[2:08:03] for a lion he didn't come for an
[2:08:05] elephant he called the serpent and I
[2:08:08] said because who did this curse you'll
[2:08:10] be and you'll be on your belly for the
[2:08:12] rest of your days so he lost his ability
[2:08:14] to stand on two feet and now he's on the
[2:08:17] ground that's what we believe
[2:08:20] praise God that's the missing link now
[2:08:22] you're gonna give me a gorilla I don't
[2:08:24] believe that but when the church gets
[2:08:34] away from the world in a believe
[2:08:38] anything brother Branham say a hungry
[2:08:43] hungry person will eat out of a garbage
[2:08:46] can can I tell you something if you
[2:08:49] spiritually hungry you eat from a
[2:08:52] denominational garbage can not a
[2:09:00] seven-course meal a denomination of
[2:09:04] garbage can and I can go further than
[2:09:10] that you know how a dog is can I put it
[2:09:16] this word Bigfoot this way a dog is
[2:09:18] nasty nasty you know why I call them
[2:09:27] nasty cause he'll vomit throw up in
[2:09:31] front of you and then go right back and
[2:09:37] start
[2:09:40] the stuff that he just threw up and the
[2:09:43] street see the way y'all shake your head
[2:09:45] and I ain't no way but that's I said dog
[2:09:47] is nasty and and and can I just just be
[2:09:50] honest if you can go back into
[2:09:56] denomination church after hearing this
[2:09:58] word after after living this word and go
[2:10:02] back and feel comfortable you're a dog
[2:10:04] that went back to his vomit when the
[2:10:23] church gets away from the word and you
[2:10:26] think you got the word if you're not
[2:10:28] looking at it through a filter a
[2:10:30] prophetic filter you ain't got nothing
[2:10:35] either believe anything you know and I
[2:10:38] want I got to bring this out because I
[2:10:43] hear this and y'all might be hearing the
[2:10:46] same thing - people say things like we
[2:10:49] can't be justified by the law and and I
[2:10:57] want to say amen to that because that's
[2:11:01] what the Bible's saying we can be
[2:11:04] justified by law that's why we needed
[2:11:05] Jesus but just because we can't be
[2:11:08] justified by the law don't mean we have
[2:11:10] to get rid of the law
[2:11:16] don't mean now you start going against
[2:11:18] the law because you can't be justified
[2:11:21] by I don't mean that you give up on the
[2:11:23] law no I think we still need to you know
[2:11:26] not not bear false witness I think we
[2:11:29] still don't need to serve idol gods I
[2:11:31] think we still need to honor the Sabbath
[2:11:33] I think we need to still honor our
[2:11:35] Father and our mother I think we should
[2:11:38] still not kill and steal we should steal
[2:11:42] honor the law of God
[2:11:46] can I go further I still think that a
[2:11:50] menace against the Word of God in
[2:11:51] Deuteronomy for women to wear pants or
[2:11:56] to wear any any garment pertaining
[2:11:59] that's what the Bible say if it pertains
[2:12:02] to a man a woman not supposed to put it
[2:12:05] on if it looked like a man aware it a
[2:12:10] woman not supposed to put it on and a
[2:12:13] man not supposed to wear a garment of a
[2:12:15] woman hello somebody
[2:12:18] I still but that's that yes that was in
[2:12:21] law Deuteronomy mean two laws it was in
[2:12:24] the law but it still tough saith the
[2:12:26] Lord and it's still prevalent today all
[2:12:33] right hallelujah Church we might as well
[2:12:38] just stop and say these things and make
[2:12:41] sure it's real clear because we not just
[2:12:44] yeah you can't be justified just in your
[2:12:46] skirt you can't justify just in your
[2:12:49] dress you gotta have something changed
[2:12:51] on the inside and if it does change on
[2:12:54] the inside and I told you to dress right
[2:12:58] because you to live right any man but
[2:13:03] I'm hearing that I'm hearing that and
[2:13:05] that just bothers me I got I got some
[2:13:06] y'all just bear with me I got two
[2:13:08] scriptures I want to read if y'all would
[2:13:10] just bear with me

[2:13:44] serpent when she was peeping at the
[2:13:46] world and sometimes you don't know you

[2:15:51] Lord God help me Jesus
[2:15:53] Romans three let's just read this verse
[2:15:56] 19 look at this because we hear this we
[2:15:58] hear this it we can be justified by the
[2:16:02] law watch them statements watch watch
[2:16:04] that when people start talking that
[2:16:06] nonsense especially somebody done walked
[2:16:08] away from this word if they start
[2:16:10] talking that they they're setting you up
[2:16:12] because they are getting ready to wear
[2:16:14] something that you didn't think they was
[2:16:16] gonna wear as soon as they say I'm we
[2:16:19] came he justified by the law there's
[2:16:21] another spirit behind that it's coming
[2:16:23] you will see it because Lord I'm coming
[2:16:29] to this scripture y'all bet I can't even
[2:16:31] get too many thoughts coming to me you
[2:16:34] know any time and I said this before
[2:16:36] i'ma say it again any time that it like
[2:16:42] a person that's moving into
[2:16:43] homosexuality if they want the world to
[2:16:46] know because it's not natural
[2:16:48] I don't you know we don't even have the
[2:16:49] net we don't have to do nothing to
[2:16:51] announce that I'm a boy it don't even
[2:16:57] mean nothin to nobody
[2:16:58] yeah we know you're a boy I'm a girl you
[2:17:02] know you know we don't even have to
[2:17:03] announce that right but black but when
[2:17:06] you when you want to go from being a boy
[2:17:08] to being a girl or you want to be a girl
[2:17:10] from a girl to being a boy you always
[2:17:12] have to do some grand announcement
[2:17:13] because it's not natural and not only
[2:17:16] that it's not accept it so since it's
[2:17:19] not accepted you got to try to make
[2:17:20] people accept you have to put a grand
[2:17:23] announcement so so when people leave
[2:17:25] this word Amen and they begin to going
[2:17:27] to dress in ways that they didn't used
[2:17:29] to dress that way they have to post it
[2:17:31] and announce because it's not
[2:17:34] natural anytime you see a big post like
[2:17:43] that
[2:17:43] how come it's just a postive look at me
[2:17:45] in a skirt
[2:17:46] look at me in a dress but they have to
[2:17:49] always post when they start wearing
[2:17:51] pants
[2:17:55] now when they go back to address
[2:17:58] they won't post it it's a spirit all
[2:18:08] right so when we see this justified by
[2:18:12] the law let's read the Bible
[2:18:15] Romans 3:19 now we know that what things
[2:18:21] soever the law saith it's said to them
[2:18:23] who are under the law that every mouth
[2:18:26] may be stopped and all the world may
[2:18:29] become guilty before God there's that
[2:18:31] word world again and here's the world
[2:18:33] being guilty before God because we're
[2:18:35] not following the law right since
[2:18:38] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[2:18:41] shall no flesh be justified in the sight
[2:18:43] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[2:18:46] that's why God gave us the law to help
[2:18:47] us understand what was righteous and
[2:18:49] what was unrighteous okay says but now
[2:18:52] the righteousness of God without the law
[2:18:54] is manifested being witnessed by the law
[2:18:57] and the prophets even though even the
[2:19:00] righteousness and see I could just stop
[2:19:02] right there now the righteous of God
[2:19:03] without the law is manifested being
[2:19:05] witnessed by the law and the prophets a
[2:19:06] man here the prophets are giving us the
[2:19:08] interpretation of what the law is
[2:19:11] okay hey man you're gonna reject the
[2:19:13] prophet he tell you what the law is
[2:19:14] saying okay listen even the
[2:19:17] righteousness of God which is by faith
[2:19:19] of which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[2:19:21] unto all and upon all of them that
[2:19:23] believe for there is no difference look
[2:19:25] at this for all have sinned and come
[2:19:27] short of the glory of God being
[2:19:30] justified freely by His grace so yes we
[2:19:33] are justified by His grace through the
[2:19:35] redemption that is in Christ Jesus see
[2:19:37] they could not reach perfection through
[2:19:39] the law because there was nothing to
[2:19:41] change the inside now we got something
[2:19:44] that changes the inside that can bring
[2:19:46] us to perfection in God's eyes this whom
[2:19:49] God has set forth to be a propitiation
[2:19:51] through faith in his blood to declare
[2:19:53] his righteousness for the remission of
[2:19:55] sins that are past through the
[2:19:58] forbearance of God listen to declare I
[2:20:00] say at this time his righteousness that
[2:20:03] he might be just and the justifier of
[2:20:05] him which believeth in Jesus where
[2:20:08] boasting then it is excluded by what I
[2:20:11] mean by what law of works name but by
[2:20:14] the law of faith therefore we conclude
[2:20:17] that a man is justified by faith that's
[2:20:21] exactly what Paul said we can't be
[2:20:24] justified by the law but by faith
[2:20:26] therefore man is justified by faith
[2:20:28] without the deeds of the law is he the
[2:20:31] god of the Jews only now look at what
[2:20:34] he's doing it's all about in the
[2:20:35] scripture we got the Jews and we got the
[2:20:36] Gentiles you see the God of the Jews
[2:20:38] only is he not also of the Gentiles
[2:20:41] yes of the Gentiles also this is what
[2:20:44] Paul is trying to get us to see not
[2:20:46] trying to get rid of the law trying to
[2:20:48] get a seat at the Gentiles and the Jews
[2:20:50] are being accepted in God's presence
[2:20:52] just because the Jews had the law them
[2:20:55] did it did make a perfect they had to
[2:20:57] come through the blood just like the
[2:20:59] Gentiles so no we're not justified by
[2:21:04] the law we understand that we're
[2:21:06] justified by faith now let's go on here
[2:21:09] look at this verse 30 seeing it is one
[2:21:12] God which shall justify the circumcision
[2:21:14] by faith and uncircumcision through
[2:21:16] faith look at this do we make void the
[2:21:20] law do do we make void the law I know
[2:21:28] you say we can't be justified by the law
[2:21:30] but my question is do we make void the
[2:21:33] law do you faith god forbid not only
[2:21:42] that not only not only god forbid can i
[2:21:47] read the rest of the verse I'm talking
[2:21:53] about what Paul said God forbidden and
[2:21:56] brother Branham preached the same thing
[2:21:59] Paul preached a million said we're
[2:22:04] resting on that God forbid yay we
[2:22:10] establish we don't get rid of it no we
[2:22:16] establish the law
[2:22:20] we make it greater so we want everything
[2:22:24] from Genesis all the way to Revelation
[2:22:28] amen
[2:22:29] and if a prophet told us that it was
[2:22:32] wrong to dress a certain way and he took
[2:22:34] us back to the law and showed us it was
[2:22:36] because the Prophet had the ability to
[2:22:38] do that
[2:22:39] amen all right I told you they eat out
[2:22:44] of garbage can when the church gets to
[2:22:46] work gets away from the order to believe
[2:22:48] anything anything now I'm skipping a
[2:22:52] little bit in this quote because I got
[2:22:53] to I got something that I want to do
[2:22:54] today and i'ma let y'all go after I do
[2:22:56] this amen
[2:22:58] I'm gonna skip this quote I'm gonna read
[2:23:00] the quote I'm gonna read the quote and
[2:23:02] y'all just got the going overtime with
[2:23:04] me I gotta get these things out I'm in
[2:23:11] paragraph 125 two and I need a somebody
[2:23:16] just get ready for one of y'all brothers
[2:23:18] get ready I'm gonna get something I got
[2:23:19] something for you when the church gets
[2:23:22] away from the word it will believe
[2:23:23] anything
[2:23:24] it is like II when Cain was born she
[2:23:27] said I've gotten a man from the Lord now
[2:23:30] do you realize that she really meant
[2:23:32] that she thought she had a man for the
[2:23:35] Lord you see once she had been deceived
[2:23:38] by taking the word of Satan instead of
[2:23:40] the Word of God she then thought that
[2:23:42] whatever she sent was right if she said
[2:23:47] that she had a man from God then she had
[2:23:50] a man from God you know people say I
[2:23:52] felt led and whatever they say it's
[2:23:54] right no long you ain't feel that you
[2:23:56] was you was anointed by a supernatural
[2:23:58] devil didn't recognize it
[2:24:02] you start feet and just like Eve was
[2:24:05] feet and you got anointed by a
[2:24:06] supernatural devil
[2:24:08] amen listen he says whatever whatever
[2:24:12] she said was right if she said that she
[2:24:14] had a man from the Lord from God then
[2:24:16] she had a man from God but God has set
[2:24:18] laws in this universe a good C can only
[2:24:20] bring forth good fruit and evil C can
[2:24:22] bring forth only evil fruit now each
[2:24:24] seed though different you will utilize
[2:24:27] the same earth nourishment moisture and
[2:24:29] sunshine but it will bring forth after
[2:24:31] some kind
[2:24:33] and got away from something here hold on
[2:24:37] what paragraph away at my end what
[2:24:42] paragraph is 126 125 I miss a good
[2:24:48] secret Allah bring forth good fruit and
[2:24:49] the evil secret can bring forth on the
[2:24:51] eve now each seat though though
[2:24:52] different would utilize the same earth
[2:24:54] nursery moisture and sunshine but it
[2:24:56] would bring forth after its own kind
[2:24:57] notice the history of the cane line
[2:24:59] notice the history of the South line
[2:25:00] only one difference between the original
[2:25:02] seed nothing else between them the
[2:25:05] original seed nothing else it goes on it
[2:25:08] says if you look at the statement of Eve
[2:25:10] real close you will notice that she had
[2:25:11] more of an understanding than most
[2:25:13] realized she did not attribute the Sun
[2:25:17] to Satan for that would have made him
[2:25:19] equal with God only God could create the
[2:25:21] egg in the womb of Mary Satan couldn't
[2:25:24] do that even knew that Satan can only
[2:25:26] pervert so he begat her with the wrong
[2:25:28] seed it was a serpent seed that brought
[2:25:31] forth Cain it was Adam seat that brought
[2:25:33] forth Abel and Seth those seeds went
[2:25:36] through exactly the same process but the
[2:25:38] children were different for they were
[2:25:40] from different seeds she believed that
[2:25:44] Cain was from God she accepted the
[2:25:47] devil's lie as the truth of God that is
[2:25:51] exactly what we have now churches set
[2:25:54] themselves up as sponsors of truth but
[2:25:56] the truth is not in them that can I go a
[2:26:00] little further
[2:26:01] okay I might as well hurt people's
[2:26:03] feelings even you got the word truth in
[2:26:05] your name don't mean you following truth
[2:26:08] I might as well just hurt your feelings
[2:26:17] even though you got the word truth in
[2:26:20] your name don't mean you following truth
[2:26:26] amen
[2:26:27] I'm going further ain't done yet she
[2:26:35] accepted the devil's lie as the truth of
[2:26:37] God that is exactly what we have now
[2:26:39] churches set them up that set themselves
[2:26:41] up as Fountains of truth but the truth
[2:26:43] is not in them yet they're begotten
[2:26:45] children swear
[2:26:46] them and will even kill to uphold their
[2:26:51] huh how do they kill how not necessarily
[2:26:57] getting a gun and shooting yeah did the
[2:27:04] Prophet teach us this is not getting a
[2:27:07] gun on our knife and stabbing your
[2:27:09] brother
[2:27:09] no it's killers influence say something
[2:27:14] about them that get the people to
[2:27:16] counter shook up about him right and
[2:27:20] some of us just cannot just be I'm gonna
[2:27:23] be honest so gullible that we won't even
[2:27:26] find out both sides of the story we just
[2:27:28] take off of one side no that's the
[2:27:31] supernatural devil don't do that she
[2:27:36] don't love not the world that best
[2:27:38] that's where we talk about world cosmos
[2:27:40] that's what Eve did when she peeped at
[2:27:42] the world she fell in love with a lie so
[2:27:47] must actually want it do we want that we
[2:27:49] want it to be right we actually want
[2:27:51] that lie to be truth but it ain't can I

[2:33:59] hello somebody and if that don't work
[2:34:02] change the number all right I'm going on
[2:34:05] see verse 5 tell us from such turn away
[2:34:09] and look now let's go to verse 6 for
[2:34:12] this sort or a day which creep into
[2:34:15] houses and lead captives silly women
[2:34:17] lately no of sins let away of a German
[2:34:20] list silly woman how come he not going
[2:34:28] through the husband how come he not
[2:34:31] calling the husband ain't we seen this
[2:34:35] pattern before then what happen what Eve
[2:34:41] well the conversation she got into oh
[2:34:44] y'all don't talk to me today this is the
[2:34:50] same pattern I told y'all Eve Pete
[2:34:53] that's the world guess what if Eve
[2:34:57] wouldn't did that we wouldn't be what we
[2:34:58] had
[2:34:58] Oh Eve looking at you now to see you
[2:35:06] gotta watch when you pointin one thing
[2:35:09] always remember especially if you do it
[2:35:12] like this 1 2 3 4 a porting right back
[2:35:19] at ya watch the spirits notice it and
[2:35:29] and we could probably break down why I
[2:35:31] call them silly women because a lot of
[2:35:32] times it's the sisters now don't get me
[2:35:35] wrong I'm gonna say most of the time as
[2:35:37] sisters that get caught up in gossip
[2:35:41] there are some brothers that will gossip
[2:35:45] and when you got a gossip and brother
[2:35:46] you really got a problem you may
[2:35:51] he can he always I call it diarrhea of
[2:35:56] the mouth
[2:36:01] mouths it loose you watch a fellow like
[2:36:05] that and don't you talk too much around
[2:36:07] him
[2:36:08] yo bidness yeah let me go on verse verse
[2:36:15] 7 ever learning and never able to come
[2:36:19] to the knowledge of okay I gotta stop
[2:36:21] there you know it's all kind of
[2:36:23] revelations that day I told y'all about
[2:36:25] this thing on on what people saying as
[2:36:28] far as you know we can't be justified by
[2:36:32] the law tells another that I heard
[2:36:34] recently about what happened in the
[2:36:35] Garden of Eden the garden the trees in
[2:36:37] the garden I was told that and I don't
[2:36:40] know maybe I might be not mentioned this
[2:36:43] right so forgive me from saying this
[2:36:44] wrong but I was told that somebody had a
[2:36:45] revelation that it was the trees in the
[2:36:48] garden the Tree of Life and tree of
[2:36:49] knowledge of good and evil was the Old
[2:36:51] Testament and the New Testament see when
[2:36:55] you get away from the word you'll eat
[2:36:56] anything Old Testament New Testament did
[2:37:00] not even exist at that time not in the
[2:37:03] Garden of Eden it didn't all we got to
[2:37:07] do is take what the Prophet said don't
[2:37:09] try to come up with nothing just go back
[2:37:11] to what the Prophet said he said the
[2:37:13] Tree of Life was Jesus and said the tree
[2:37:16] of knowledge of good and evil was the
[2:37:17] devil and Eve had a conversation with
[2:37:22] the devil that's what got her into that
[2:37:24] condition
[2:37:25] supernatural devil let's go on now as
[2:37:29] Genesis and Jambres withstood Moses so
[2:37:33] duties also reset the truth resist
[2:37:36] resist the truth see they can resist the
[2:37:40] truth as well okay that's there and
[2:37:42] that's the hour that you live in and
[2:37:43] there's Patti high-minded lovers of
[2:37:45] pleasure more than lovers of God they
[2:37:46] resist truth let's go on men of corrupt
[2:37:50] Minds reprobate concerning the faith
[2:37:53] totally against the faith but they shall
[2:37:57] proceed no further Oh for they folly
[2:38:01] shall be manifest unto our men

[2:41:25] myself I mean why am I gonna go out
[2:41:28] there and try to put on a muscle shirt
[2:41:32] man hide that verse 16 all Scripture is
[2:41:45] given by inspiration of God and is
[2:41:49] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[2:41:52] correction for instruction in
[2:41:55] righteousness that the man of God may be
[2:41:58] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[2:42:01] good works
[2:42:02] all right brother Branham told us to
[2:42:03] read all the second Timothy three and
[2:42:05] then he also said to read a few verses
[2:42:08] of second Timothy four verse one through
[2:42:13] five and I'll read that it says I charge
[2:42:14] thee therefore before God and the Lord
[2:42:17] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[2:42:18] and the dead at his appearing and his
[2:42:20] kingdom read that from the brother
[2:42:24] Jeffrey preach the word be instant
[2:42:27] season out of season reprove rebuke
[2:42:32] exhort with all long-suffering and
[2:42:35] doctrine
[2:42:36] no brother Jeffrey out I made some
[2:42:38] people upset saying things in this
[2:42:43] pulpit
[2:42:49] they're gonna go to youtube and see the
[2:42:51] sermon and they're gonna give me a
[2:42:52] thumbs down I got a job and I want to
[2:43:09] tell you something I was hired by God
[2:43:13] even when I wasn't asking for the job
[2:43:17] I got called in for an interview and I
[2:43:26] realized a long time ago that I couldn't
[2:43:28] wrestle with God and win so I just
[2:43:31] surrendered and now I can't help but do
[2:43:34] what God called me to do and that's
[2:43:35] preach the word be instant and why in
[2:43:41] season obviously I know you might say
[2:43:43] well some of this time I tell y'all this
[2:43:45] is seasonal for what you're going
[2:43:46] through right now but some of y'all it's
[2:43:50] out of season it's coming go back to
[2:43:53] this sermon love not the world see when
[2:43:58] you look at the title you gonna think oh
[2:43:59] brother Jack disputing about dressing
[2:44:01] yeah it's dresses and it's in there yeah
[2:44:04] but we also talked about a little bit
[2:44:06] more the same thing that Eve got caught
[2:44:09] up cuz she peeped at the world she was
[2:44:12] struggling with dressing what was she
[2:44:14] struggling with same thing we all
[2:44:16] struggle with some different
[2:44:19] interpretation of the word verse 3 go
[2:44:26] ahead brother for the time will come
[2:44:28] when they will not endure sound doctrine
[2:44:31] but after their own lusts shall they
[2:44:35] heap of themselves teachers having
[2:44:37] itching all right so they got engineers
[2:44:40] and they got brain instead of their own
[2:44:42] teacher now you know in the book of
[2:44:43] Judges that happen you know they were so
[2:44:45] far gone they didn't have priests so
[2:44:48] this man kind of created his own gods
[2:44:49] and then a higher priests high priest
[2:44:54] and then what come along a whole truck
[2:44:56] come along and took the priests out of
[2:44:58] out of his house
[2:45:00] say look you can serve us you can get
[2:45:01] paid more about coming up that man
[2:45:03] dropped his job and if you know if
[2:45:06] you're not careful just look around a
[2:45:08] lot of folks that are that are out there
[2:45:09] in these systems they go from church to
[2:45:12] church why prestige mo money lust of the
[2:45:16] flesh lust of the eyes pride of life
[2:45:19] that's what drives them they not satisfy
[2:45:23] preaching to 25 can we just call it like
[2:45:32] it is
[2:45:33] I remember brother Anderson say if God
[2:45:39] gave you game call you to be passed and
[2:45:41] he told you gonna pass the 499 you will
[2:45:43] not pass the 500 and you will not pass
[2:45:46] the phone 98 you will pass the 499
[2:45:50] they've got call you to pass the 9 you
[2:45:53] not pastoring 10 and you won't pass the
[2:45:56] 8 you a pastor 9 you got to be some
[2:46:02] impressed and and satisfied with what
[2:46:05] God is giving you verse 4 and they shall
[2:46:12] turn away their ears from the truth and
[2:46:15] shall be turned unto fables don't tell
[2:46:19] me what the prophets said I don't want
[2:46:23] it hidden on got no profit y'all heard
[2:46:25] that spirit before this is the spirit of
[2:46:28] the last day just just preach Jesus I am
[2:46:34] I'm preaching Jesus they shall turn away
[2:46:39] their ears from the truth and shall be
[2:46:41] turned unto fables verse 5 but watch
[2:46:45] thou in all things endure afflictions do
[2:46:53] the work of an evangelist make full
[2:46:57] proof of that ministry
[2:47:07] so you love not the world all the things
[2:47:09] of the world because if we if you know
[2:47:12] the Bible says if any man love the world
[2:47:15] the love of the father's not in him
[2:47:17] verse 16 says for all that is in the
[2:47:19] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[2:47:23] the eyes the pride of life is not of the
[2:47:26] Father but is of the world
[2:47:28] verse 17 said and the world passeth away
[2:47:31] and the lust thereof but he that doeth
[2:47:34] the will of God abideth forever
[2:47:38] I'm not finished I got to go into that
[2:47:41] lust of the flesh lust of the eye proud
[2:47:42] of life I got to go deeper than that
[2:47:44] because that's what Nimrod fell for and
[2:47:47] that's what people fallen for today
[2:47:49] Church be careful supernatural Devils
[2:47:53] anointing people and and see again that
[2:47:58] scripture that we read you know in
[2:48:00] Galatians who hindered you right and
[2:48:04] whoever it was that hindered you they
[2:48:07] were not sent by God annoying it by a
[2:48:09] devil to come in hinder you
[2:48:11] god help us to be careful let's pray
[2:48:16] Jesus your word is true your word is
[2:48:19] real your word is necessary your word is
[2:48:23] needful it purges us it cleanses us it
[2:48:27] washes us God and my prayer is we just
[2:48:31] bring this thought to the people as
[2:48:32] you've laid it in my heart
[2:48:34] now that we would hear what the Spirit
[2:48:36] is trying to say to us say when the
[2:48:41] enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit
[2:48:43] of the Lord will raise a standard
[2:48:45] against the enemy I gotta let the word
[2:48:51] be quicken I understanding me open
[2:48:54] revelation be given let us receive
[2:48:58] warning of the Holy Ghost of God that we
