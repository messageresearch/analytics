[33:52] trying to think of any prayer requests
[33:54] we want to continue to pray
[33:56] for brother daniel gets guessing that i
[33:58] still don't know the full story of what
[34:00] went on but
[34:02] i believe um
[34:04] i believe his son uh left the word
[34:08] and i don't know if there was some harsh
[34:09] words or whatever but
[34:12] he really needs prayer
[34:14] amen and it came to us i guess tuesday
[34:17] right before
[34:18] the brothers prayer meeting
[34:20] and we heard about it it just struck my
[34:22] heart that you know when it comes to
[34:24] believers
[34:26] things happen to us it's not for
[34:28] ourselves
[34:29] it's for other people
[34:32] it really is you know god may give
[34:35] brother daniel something to preach to
[34:37] the people that are strengthened because
[34:39] of the situation that has arisen
[34:43] i tell you what
[34:45] you know my heart
[34:47] bleeds for nehemiah he's not standing
[34:49] with us
[34:51] but there was something that happened to
[34:52] brother willie
[34:53] that made him being a minister a
[34:56] spectacle to the world
[34:59] and all of us could watch brother willie
[35:01] stay with the word
[35:04] and he has a promise you hold that token
[35:06] over your family
[35:08] amen he has a promise he can stand on
[35:11] and we're believing with him
[35:12] and i believe we're going to see
[35:14] his entire family
[35:16] sitting beside him
[35:18] serving alone
[35:19] [Music]
[35:21] [Applause]
[35:23] that happened to him because he had a
[35:26] strength that none of us had at a time
[35:29] and god knew that
[35:31] and he's still standing
[35:33] he's still preaching
[35:35] he's still believing
[35:37] and we thank the lord for you brother

[53:25] [Music]
[53:27] because all through my life i've been
[53:29] trying to whisper
[53:34] so
[53:35] if it made me what i am
[53:38] by trying to whisper i wonder what i
[53:40] would have been
[53:41] if the name had not been that
[53:43] [Music]
[53:45] but now i know someone like me
[53:47] is my grandson
[53:50] so he's shouting
[53:52] [Music]
[53:56] uh god bless you
[53:58] whilst you're standing shall we just ten
[54:00] our bibles to the book of fresa 23
[54:04] so that we can go straight into the
[54:06] reading of the word
[54:08] amen
[54:10] praise the lord
[54:21] amen
[54:24] you've got it on the projector yeah
[54:26] perfect that's it
[54:27] first summer chapter 23 i'm going to
[54:30] start reading from verse 25 here
[54:33] so also and these men went to seek him
[54:35] and they told david wherefore he came
[54:38] down into a rock and aboard in the
[54:40] wilderness of mount and when so had that
[54:43] he pursued after david in the wilderness
[54:46] of mount
[54:47] and saul went on this side of the
[54:49] mountain and david and his man on that
[54:52] side of the mountain and david made
[54:54] haste to get away for fear of soul for
[54:57] saul and his man compassed david and his
[55:00] men round about to take them
[55:02] but there came a messenger unto saul
[55:05] saying hesty and come for the
[55:07] philistines have invented the land
[55:10] wherefore saul returned from pursuing
[55:12] after david and wind against the
[55:14] philistines therefore they called that
[55:17] place selahamalekhov
[55:22] we may be seared
[55:28] i want to take a title from that very
[55:32] last part of verse 28
[55:36] and they called the place
[55:38] selah malekov
[55:41] and the title i want to speak on is
[55:43] selahamalekhov
[55:46] amen
[55:49] now
[55:50] many times you know us as preachers
[55:53] we're always preaching all the time
[55:55] and the biggest barrel that we have is
[55:58] when you go to a different place what do
[56:00] you actually preach of all the sermons
[56:03] that you have been
[56:05] preaching how he wants to come and
[56:07] preach with grandfather
[56:11] of all the sermons that you've been
[56:13] preaching
[56:14] then
[56:15] you
[56:16] you wonder where am i gonna start from
[56:19] it becomes such a battle
[56:21] but this time around i
[56:23] did not have to battle
[56:25] because
[56:26] when brother jack came to uk over ista
[56:30] what a blessing we had
[56:33] and the saints that came together with
[56:34] him we appreciate every one of them for
[56:36] that but when brother jack came he he
[56:39] was preaching
[56:41] the last service and he preached on a
[56:43] message that he titled
[56:45] our rock is not like they are wrong
[56:48] and we've just been fellowshipping
[56:50] around more like the same thought
[56:53] so when he preached on that
[56:55] at that very time i say to myself
[56:58] when i go to
[57:00] his church
[57:01] i'm going to preach on exactly the same
[57:04] thing
[57:05] so we're just resetting back to easter
[57:10] amen and that's why i'm bringing this
[57:14] subject select
[57:16] amen but let me start by reading what
[57:19] david says in psalms chapter 103
[57:23] in psalms 103 verse 2 the bible says
[57:27] bless the lord all my soul
[57:30] and forget not all his benefits
[57:34] what a powerful scripture that is
[57:37] bless the lord o my soul
[57:40] and forget not all his benefits
[57:43] in other words worship god save god
[57:45] please god
[57:47] but in all that
[57:49] don't forget his benefits
[57:53] there are benefits in serving god
[57:56] do me a favor and look to somebody next
[57:58] to you and tell them do you know their
[58:00] benefits in serving god
[58:04] their benefits in serving god
[58:06] bless the lord o my soul
[58:09] and forget not
[58:12] his benefits
[58:14] let me say when we serve god amen we
[58:17] come under a heaven full comprehensive
[58:20] coverage
[58:22] we have a policy we have an insurance
[58:25] that covers us fully
[58:28] the prophet of god many a time you know
[58:30] he would be found in this businessman
[58:33] meetings and they would ask him are you
[58:35] a businessman and the prophet always
[58:37] used to say yes i'm in a i'm a
[58:39] businessman i said what business are you
[58:41] in he says i'm in the assurance business
[58:44] we can talk a policy right now if you
[58:46] need one
[58:48] so there is a policy amen
[58:51] and that policy is a blessed assurance
[58:54] hallelujah jesus is mine
[58:58] and one guy say to brother branham and
[59:00] he says oh no but that one won't take
[59:02] you to the grave and brother branham
[59:04] said i'm not worried about going in i'm
[59:07] worried about going out
[59:09] [Music]
[59:11] so we have a policy church
[59:13] and that policy not only does it take us
[59:16] when we go through the river jordan but
[59:18] it takes us out
[59:21] hallelujah it's a blessed assurance
[59:24] jesus when he becomes yours you have
[59:27] this blessed assurance
[59:30] praise god in the highest
[59:32] amen but let me also say that this
[59:35] policy though brother branham speaks
[59:37] about it is taking you out of the grave
[59:40] but it don't start working there
[59:42] it starts working now
[59:45] hallelujah it covers us during this life
[59:50] why do i say that because it has a
[59:52] protection coverage
[59:55] hallelujah
[59:57] amen the scripture says touch not
[1:00:00] mine anointed
[1:00:02] in other words i have a protection over
[1:00:04] them
[1:00:05] touch not my anointed do my prophets no
[1:00:08] harm
[1:00:09] these angels encamp round about them
[1:00:12] that fear him it is a protection
[1:00:15] this coverage also has health coverage
[1:00:18] in it
[1:00:19] by his stripes
[1:00:21] we are healed
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] with the other ones they might fail amen
[1:00:27] to honor it but with this one the bank
[1:00:29] of heaven it always honors any claim to
[1:00:33] them that come believing by his tribes
[1:00:36] we are healed
[1:00:39] and let me also say it is a family
[1:00:41] coverage
[1:00:42] when you take the policy it just doesn't
[1:00:45] cover you
[1:00:46] it covers you and your household
[1:00:49] can you say amen
[1:00:52] can you say amen
[1:00:53] moses was about to leave egypt and when
[1:00:56] he was about to leave egypt he said he
[1:00:58] was asked who is gonna go and moses said
[1:01:01] we are going with our young we are going
[1:01:04] with our old not even just that we are
[1:01:06] also going with our cat oh we are going
[1:01:08] with our flock
[1:01:10] not a roof shall remain it covers
[1:01:13] everything that we have it has a family
[1:01:16] coverage you have your assets covered it
[1:01:19] has everything that we need covered
[1:01:22] under that policy can you say amen
[1:01:24] somebody
[1:01:26] then i find a rehab a man in jericho
[1:01:30] when the spies came she was told yes you
[1:01:33] have a coverage and this cover will
[1:01:35] cover your entire family she asked can i
[1:01:38] bring my mama up say go bring your mama
[1:01:40] can i bring my papa say go bring your
[1:01:43] papa can i bring my uncle oh that will
[1:01:46] come under the token you can bring them
[1:01:49] if they are protected
[1:01:51] oh let me say to somebody here you have
[1:01:54] a policy that covers not only you but
[1:01:57] your loved ones apply the token and when
[1:02:00] you apply the token they will come under
[1:02:03] that token
[1:02:04] the devil have to let them go
[1:02:07] i don't care who it is but the devil
[1:02:10] will have to let them go
[1:02:12] and the good thing about this policy is
[1:02:15] you don't need money to buy it
[1:02:18] come by of me
[1:02:20] without money
[1:02:22] and without price
[1:02:25] so we have the most comprehensive
[1:02:27] coverage
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] and let me say this cover
[1:02:32] it covers you
[1:02:33] even when you are not aware
[1:02:37] you see when you have a policy you have
[1:02:39] to be aware
[1:02:40] of the contents of your policy
[1:02:43] that when a claimable event happens
[1:02:46] you should be able to go and claim
[1:02:48] against your policy now if you don't go
[1:02:51] to claim they are not going to come and
[1:02:53] tell you we have covered you we are
[1:02:55] giving you this
[1:02:57] they don't work that way
[1:02:59] you got to know the benefits of your
[1:03:00] claim and when a claimable event happens
[1:03:03] then you're supposed to go and make a
[1:03:05] claim
[1:03:06] so even with hours as well at times
[1:03:08] you've got to go and make a claim
[1:03:10] but let me also say it covers us even
[1:03:13] amen when we are unawares
[1:03:17] that's how faithful our god is
[1:03:19] that he does not need to explain every
[1:03:22] single detail to you when he has not
[1:03:24] even explained what he's about to do you
[1:03:26] just find that there are benefits that
[1:03:29] are accruing
[1:03:30] when you are sleeping you find there are
[1:03:32] benefits that are accruing why because
[1:03:35] we have a 24 7 coverage
[1:03:39] the angels of god they came around about
[1:03:42] them they are not there part-time but
[1:03:45] they are there on a full-time basis
[1:03:48] hallelujah that when you are even
[1:03:50] unaware
[1:03:51] it is covering you all the same
[1:03:54] so god does not need to explain
[1:03:55] everything to us
[1:03:57] at times we just see benefits
[1:04:01] they just drop in
[1:04:03] and you just wake up to say thank you
[1:04:05] lord
[1:04:06] i thank you lord
[1:04:08] now let me get to my
[1:04:10] semen first samuel we started with
[1:04:14] the scripture says and david made haste
[1:04:16] to get away for fear of soul for so and
[1:04:19] these men compassed david and his men
[1:04:20] round about to take them but they came a
[1:04:23] messenger unto souls saying hast thee
[1:04:25] and come for the philistines have
[1:04:27] invented the land wherefore saul
[1:04:29] returned from pursuing after david and
[1:04:32] went against the philistines therefore
[1:04:34] they called the place
[1:04:37] and our title is coming from this verse
[1:04:40] 28.
[1:04:41] now many times when you read the bible
[1:04:43] you find some of these words
[1:04:46] that are written in their original form
[1:04:49] so even when the translations happened
[1:04:51] they were kept in their original form
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:56] now many times when you come across some
[1:04:58] of these words at times you are given
[1:05:00] the reason why that word is there
[1:05:04] but at times we are not told
[1:05:07] now take for instance when you go into
[1:05:09] the bible you'll find that isaac dug
[1:05:12] well and when i said duck the world they
[1:05:14] called it essec
[1:05:16] and the reason of it was because they
[1:05:18] strove with him
[1:05:21] and then he dug another one and he
[1:05:22] called it real both
[1:05:24] and he says the reason of it is the lord
[1:05:27] has made room for us
[1:05:29] so we are given the meaning of that word
[1:05:32] moses had a son and he called his name
[1:05:35] geshong he says for i've been a stranger
[1:05:38] in a strange land
[1:05:40] we find joseph as well joseph amen he
[1:05:43] had two sons and one he named him
[1:05:45] manasseh and the other one he named him
[1:05:46] ephraim
[1:05:48] and the reason why he called this one
[1:05:49] manasseh he says the lord had made me to
[1:05:52] forget my toys and my father's house
[1:05:56] and then he named the other one ephraim
[1:05:58] he says for god it caused me to be
[1:06:00] fruitful in the land of my affliction
[1:06:03] so we are told the meanings of these
[1:06:05] words
[1:06:06] but then there are times a man where the
[1:06:08] meaning is not given in the scripture
[1:06:11] but when you go to the direct
[1:06:13] translation of the word we will know
[1:06:15] what the meaning is
[1:06:17] like jehovah jiren
[1:06:19] the lord will provide himself a
[1:06:21] sacrifice jehovah shalom the lord our
[1:06:24] peace jehovah said kennel the lord our
[1:06:27] righteousness jehovah sharma the lord is
[1:06:31] present
[1:06:33] and i like that one
[1:06:35] jehovah sharma
[1:06:37] the lord is present
[1:06:39] and i believe he's here this afternoon
[1:06:42] i believe he's here in this church amen
[1:06:45] so we we get to understand some of these
[1:06:48] meanings just by the direct translation
[1:06:51] but then at times
[1:06:54] there is no direct translation that even
[1:06:56] comes
[1:06:58] and you go to dig it up and you find
[1:06:59] there is nothing to it
[1:07:01] and in that case that is when now bible
[1:07:04] scholars they've got to go and dig deep
[1:07:06] into the word to try and find out but
[1:07:09] why what was the meaning that was behind
[1:07:12] this word
[1:07:13] and such is the word like selahamaleko
[1:07:18] selahamalekhot is one such word where if
[1:07:21] you go into the bible you cannot find
[1:07:23] the direct meaning of it
[1:07:27] and like i say this is where you go now
[1:07:29] to looking at the bible scholars you go
[1:07:32] to look at the history of the places you
[1:07:34] go to investigate and to find out but
[1:07:36] what was the real meaning of it
[1:07:39] now when bible scholars started looking
[1:07:41] at this they came up with two uh
[1:07:43] possible meanings for this
[1:07:46] malek
[1:07:47] and they say the first one is it's a
[1:07:49] rock of escape
[1:07:51] and then the other one is a rock of
[1:07:53] divisions
[1:07:55] now the reason why they call or say that
[1:07:58] it is likely to be a rock of divisions
[1:08:00] is they try and say it was depicting
[1:08:03] souls divided mind
[1:08:06] at this time
[1:08:08] because at this time amen so is told the
[1:08:12] philistines have come to invent the land
[1:08:15] and then so he has to leave that place
[1:08:18] and then go to fight the philistines and
[1:08:20] they say that he was in a battle of
[1:08:22] whether to pursue after david or to
[1:08:24] pursue after the philistines
[1:08:28] but unfortunately though they say that
[1:08:30] but i don't find that to be supported by
[1:08:33] scriptural events
[1:08:37] because when you look into the bible if
[1:08:39] you read here verse number 27 it says
[1:08:42] there came a messenger unto soul saying
[1:08:44] haste thee and come for the philistines
[1:08:47] have invaded the land
[1:08:51] wherefore saul returned from pursuing
[1:08:53] after david and went against the
[1:08:54] philistines i don't read what he's
[1:08:57] battling in his mind
[1:09:01] there is
[1:09:02] an instruction that is given
[1:09:05] oh a message that has been sent and the
[1:09:07] message says the philistines have
[1:09:08] invaded the land and no sooner than he
[1:09:10] hears that he just makes a decision and
[1:09:13] he goes straight and he leaves you know
[1:09:15] fighting david and he goes to defend the
[1:09:17] land
[1:09:19] so this rock of division
[1:09:21] it does not jail with the scriptures
[1:09:25] are you with me
[1:09:26] so i don't agree with those bible
[1:09:28] scholars there
[1:09:30] but the one that i agree with is the
[1:09:33] rock of escapes
[1:09:35] because that is what is supported by
[1:09:38] scriptural events
[1:09:41] now let's look into those events
[1:09:44] this setting of the scripture
[1:09:46] we know this was at the time when david
[1:09:49] was a fugitive
[1:09:51] he was now in the wilderness
[1:09:53] pursuit of saul
[1:09:55] and he was running away from from from
[1:09:58] saul who wanted to kill him
[1:10:00] then he had this 600 man that came to
[1:10:04] you know team up with him
[1:10:07] and when he was there in the wilderness
[1:10:08] with this 600 man the bible says that
[1:10:11] these were vain fellas
[1:10:14] but somehow praise god
[1:10:17] he managed to tend those vain fellows
[1:10:20] to become mighty gentle warriors
[1:10:23] and i wonder how he did it
[1:10:25] but i believe it was because he was
[1:10:27] preaching to them
[1:10:29] that you are not what the devil says you
[1:10:31] are
[1:10:32] you are what god says you are
[1:10:34] you are not what this world is trying to
[1:10:36] make you to be you are a daughter of god
[1:10:39] you are a son of god oh let me speak to
[1:10:42] somebody here and tell you that satan
[1:10:45] always tries to pull you down but you
[1:10:47] gotta look yourself in the mirror of the
[1:10:49] word and say i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:10:53] daughter of god
[1:10:55] they were called vain fellas they had
[1:10:58] been made vain because of circumstances
[1:11:00] of life but when david started to talk
[1:11:03] to them he says inside of you i see
[1:11:06] great man i see mighty men of vela i see
[1:11:09] men that can slay giants and before you
[1:11:12] knew it they were slain giants
[1:11:15] from being vain fellas they became
[1:11:18] mighty gentle warriors
[1:11:20] transformed
[1:11:22] by the word
[1:11:24] and i like that
[1:11:25] the word transforms us
[1:11:28] makes us into the image of jesus christ
[1:11:32] amen now david at that time he's running
[1:11:36] away from from saul
[1:11:38] and as he's running away from so you
[1:11:40] would almost think that this man would
[1:11:42] not be mindful of the work of god
[1:11:45] but no not david
[1:11:47] at a time when he was a fugitive
[1:11:50] he hears that the philistines have gone
[1:11:52] to invade this place that was called
[1:11:54] kela
[1:11:57] and then david says let me go and rescue
[1:11:59] keila
[1:12:01] but before he goes he asks god and he
[1:12:03] says god should i go and rescue kayla
[1:12:08] and the philistines had got into kela
[1:12:10] and they had gone there and they were
[1:12:12] invading the threshing floors
[1:12:14] they were taking all the harvest they
[1:12:16] were taking everything that the children
[1:12:18] of israel had harvested
[1:12:21] and you know many a time sayings
[1:12:24] we read this in the bible that these
[1:12:26] philistines they would wait until
[1:12:28] harvest time
[1:12:29] they get the children of god to do all
[1:12:31] the laboring all the planting all the
[1:12:34] harvesting when everything is ready then
[1:12:37] they come and they just snatch
[1:12:39] everything
[1:12:42] what a devil
[1:12:44] he has never changed his pattern
[1:12:47] he always waits until you've got
[1:12:49] somewhere that's when he wants to come
[1:12:51] in and take what god has given you
[1:12:55] but at that time amen the prophet of god
[1:12:58] gives us an example of this man that was
[1:13:00] called shamga
[1:13:02] shamga you know the prophet dramatizes
[1:13:04] this and he says the philistines would
[1:13:07] come trump trump trump
[1:13:09] and then they go to take what they had
[1:13:11] but one day shanghai got angry and he
[1:13:14] says i've heard enough of this i'm tired
[1:13:17] of what the devil is doing he picked up
[1:13:20] an oak's god and he said i might not be
[1:13:22] a soldier i might not be a trained
[1:13:24] somebody but i have a big god
[1:13:28] and he picked up that ox god and he said
[1:13:30] i'm going after these philistines and he
[1:13:33] slew them
[1:13:34] oh god give us some shamgas here
[1:13:38] yes at times you got to get to a place
[1:13:40] where you say to satan enough is enough
[1:13:44] i've seen you around my house for far
[1:13:46] too long i've seen you around my
[1:13:48] children for far too long enough is
[1:13:50] enough we are drawing the line things
[1:13:53] have got to change oh praise the lord
[1:13:56] there's got to come a year when you say
[1:13:58] this year things have got to turn around
[1:14:02] enough is enough i cannot carry on in
[1:14:05] this direction i cannot carry on in this
[1:14:08] side i've got to care to the other side
[1:14:12] or somebody say amen
[1:14:15] you gotta get some righteous indignation
[1:14:17] at a certain point in your life and say
[1:14:20] no man i'm a daughter of god i'm a son
[1:14:23] of god i'm a man that is on a mission
[1:14:26] i'm born for a purpose i'm not just a
[1:14:29] nobody i'm a son of the living god i
[1:14:32] came from god and i go back to god my
[1:14:36] god is on my side
[1:14:38] and if god be for us then who can be
[1:14:42] against us
[1:14:44] amen amen
[1:14:46] you gotta get angry at some point
[1:14:49] so david heard that these philistines
[1:14:51] had come again
[1:14:53] and they were now
[1:14:54] inhaler now this david was not part of
[1:14:58] that city
[1:15:00] but he knew that these are my brothers
[1:15:03] and he says if they are my brothers
[1:15:05] i'm my brother's keeper
[1:15:07] i'm gonna go and fight and rescue my
[1:15:10] brothers
[1:15:11] now keala was was was a gated city
[1:15:16] it was a city that was under bars
[1:15:18] so it was a city that was walled
[1:15:21] so it was a very dangerous undertaking
[1:15:23] for david to go to that place
[1:15:26] so david spoke to his man and he says
[1:15:28] i'm feeling this inspiration can i go
[1:15:31] can we go and rescue our brothers and
[1:15:33] the brother says hey david that is a
[1:15:36] ward city we cannot go into that place
[1:15:39] they were afraid
[1:15:40] but david at that time he went and he
[1:15:43] consulted the lord and the lord told him
[1:15:47] you can go and you will rescue it
[1:15:50] oh i like it amen that when god says god
[1:15:54] it does not matter what is against you
[1:15:57] it does not matter what the odds are if
[1:15:59] god is with you
[1:16:01] then god will fight your battle
[1:16:04] so god took david into kahela and david
[1:16:08] went and he rescued the city out of the
[1:16:10] hands of the philistines god give us
[1:16:12] some davis
[1:16:14] that can say yes it is not my battle but
[1:16:17] it is my brother's battle it is not my
[1:16:20] battle but it is my sister's battle but
[1:16:22] as long as my sister is not free of that
[1:16:25] demon i'll be doing the fasting
[1:16:28] and i'll be doing the praying
[1:16:31] that was the spirit that david had
[1:16:34] he went and he rescued that place
[1:16:37] and then he said
[1:16:39] he settled in there
[1:16:41] then when he was in there then so had
[1:16:44] that david was inhaler
[1:16:47] and when saw head that david was there
[1:16:49] then saul said aha he has gone into a
[1:16:52] ward city
[1:16:54] now it's easy for me to go and capture
[1:16:56] him because he will not run away
[1:16:59] we'll just compass the place and then
[1:17:01] we'll take him
[1:17:03] so that's when now david at that time
[1:17:07] praised god something had happened prior
[1:17:11] what had happened there was in a beater
[1:17:15] we had escaped the sword when doug was
[1:17:18] slaying the sons of the priests
[1:17:21] and then he came to kennel where david
[1:17:23] was and he came with an effort
[1:17:26] so david then amen he called for that
[1:17:29] effort
[1:17:30] look at the wisdom of god that before
[1:17:33] david is entrepreneur he allows the
[1:17:35] nebula to come in there with an effort
[1:17:39] that he can inquire god going ahead of
[1:17:43] the plan of the wicked devil
[1:17:45] and our god is still doing the same
[1:17:47] thing
[1:17:48] he goes ahead of satan that before amen
[1:17:52] you get to the place where you are
[1:17:54] cornered of satan god has already made a
[1:17:56] way of escape oh let me tell you saints
[1:17:59] our god is not a reactive god
[1:18:02] our god is a proactive god
[1:18:05] before things happen he has already
[1:18:08] sorted things out so no matter where you
[1:18:11] are taken to i want you to know that god
[1:18:14] has already made a way of escape
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:18] glory to god
[1:18:20] so he he goes there amen and inquires of
[1:18:24] the lord and god says aha this is what
[1:18:27] is about to take place david is asking
[1:18:29] god is so gonna come into this place
[1:18:32] and god says he's coming
[1:18:35] and he says who the people of the city
[1:18:37] give me up to saul and he was told yes
[1:18:39] they will surrender you
[1:18:42] so david when he heard that then
[1:18:44] together with his men he escaped
[1:18:46] and he came out of the place and he went
[1:18:50] so so by the time he tries to come there
[1:18:52] david is already escaped
[1:18:55] but then at the very same time
[1:18:57] then he goes into this wilderness when
[1:19:00] he goes into this wilderness
[1:19:02] that was when he went a man into the
[1:19:04] wilderness of zeath
[1:19:06] then the zephites they sold him out
[1:19:09] and they went and they told saul and
[1:19:11] they said we have found david he's
[1:19:13] abiding by here
[1:19:16] then david hears that saw is coming
[1:19:18] again and when saw is now coming then
[1:19:21] david he moves from the wilderness of
[1:19:23] zeath if you look at the map of israel
[1:19:25] as if it's just on top here and then
[1:19:28] just below is the wilderness of my own
[1:19:31] and in that wilderness of man that's
[1:19:33] when david then runs into
[1:19:35] and when he gets into there that's now
[1:19:37] where we find ourselves in the book of
[1:19:40] faith samuel chapter 23 which is the
[1:19:42] scripture that we read
[1:19:45] he is now escaped a man from the
[1:19:48] wilderness of sith and is now in this
[1:19:50] wilderness of mount but they are all in
[1:19:52] the inheritance of judah so these places
[1:19:55] are close by one to another
[1:19:58] now when he's in this wilderness of
[1:20:00] mount
[1:20:01] then he here soul is coming along and
[1:20:04] then so he comes and he starts to
[1:20:07] encompass roundabout give me that
[1:20:09] scripture now first summer chapter 23
[1:20:12] now in verse number 25
[1:20:15] the bible says so also and this man went
[1:20:17] to seek him
[1:20:19] and they told david
[1:20:21] then now verse 26 and so went on this
[1:20:24] side of the mountain and david and his
[1:20:26] men on that side of the mountain and
[1:20:29] david made haste to get away for fear of
[1:20:32] soul for saul and his men compass david
[1:20:35] and his men round about to take them
[1:20:39] now i want you to watch god does not
[1:20:41] play with words
[1:20:43] whenever there is a word that is laid in
[1:20:45] the scripture it is because there is a
[1:20:47] reason for it
[1:20:49] the scripture says that david was
[1:20:52] compass round about
[1:20:55] now when you are compass round about it
[1:20:58] means you are surrounded
[1:21:00] it means he's everywhere
[1:21:02] and here the scripture says david he
[1:21:05] made haste for fear of soul so he made
[1:21:08] haste to get away
[1:21:11] but what he doesn't realize is though
[1:21:13] that he wants to get away but he's
[1:21:15] actually surrounded
[1:21:23] he doesn't realize that he's actually
[1:21:25] surrounded
[1:21:27] he doesn't realize that souls people are
[1:21:29] all over around him
[1:21:31] but hallelujah though david does not
[1:21:34] realize what is going on but there is a
[1:21:37] god that is in heaven that can see all
[1:21:39] things
[1:21:40] and god recognizes that this david is a
[1:21:43] man that is under a policy he's got a
[1:21:46] full comprehensive coverage and that
[1:21:49] coverage it covers him even when he's
[1:21:52] unawares
[1:21:53] so though he was unaware but the policy
[1:21:56] that david was under it had to kick in
[1:21:59] at that time
[1:22:00] so god looks from glory and god says aha
[1:22:04] i see they have surrounded him he's
[1:22:06] making haste but in whatever direction
[1:22:09] he goes he shall be found and they will
[1:22:12] capture him and the light of israel is
[1:22:14] going to be destroyed
[1:22:16] so god says ah i anointed this man i
[1:22:20] cannot cause him to perish at this place
[1:22:22] i'm gonna protect him so god from glory
[1:22:26] he orchestrates amen a strategy that is
[1:22:30] coming from heaven
[1:22:31] when david is unawares about it
[1:22:35] you see church there are times when the
[1:22:37] policy kicks in when we are not aware
[1:22:41] i find that with the children of israel
[1:22:43] when baelam and balaka wanted to kiss
[1:22:46] israel
[1:22:47] israel was sleeping amen and god was
[1:22:50] fighting their barrels have you ever
[1:22:52] read that scripture
[1:22:54] when bailout amen and balaam were doing
[1:22:57] whatever they were doing that whole
[1:22:59] conversation it was between balaam balak
[1:23:02] and god
[1:23:04] and israel was never mentioned in it
[1:23:06] they were not even aware that there were
[1:23:08] people that were trying to curse
[1:23:10] and god stopped the curse before it even
[1:23:13] got to them
[1:23:14] oh let me tell you this afternoon there
[1:23:17] are things that are happening behind you
[1:23:20] and god is cancelling see things and
[1:23:23] situations before you even know about it
[1:23:27] oh that's what our policy does
[1:23:29] amen when you are even know that where
[1:23:32] but god amen he sends the protection
[1:23:37] when we get over you in the church when
[1:23:39] we get before the presence of the lord
[1:23:41] we shall be surprised
[1:23:43] when we shall see the battles that god
[1:23:46] fought for us
[1:23:47] we shall wish we had praised him amen
[1:23:50] even more than we praise him now
[1:23:52] so david is surrounded amen and there is
[1:23:56] no way of escape for david and he
[1:23:58] doesn't realize that i'm completely
[1:24:00] cornered then heaven sees it that there
[1:24:02] is no way of escape amen and in the
[1:24:06] seventh dimension god starts to
[1:24:08] orchestrate a plan that will come onto
[1:24:11] these three dimensions
[1:24:13] so god says what do i do he says let me
[1:24:16] move things around
[1:24:18] god causes the philistines to go and
[1:24:21] invade hallelujah israel and then god
[1:24:25] causes a messenger to run with a message
[1:24:28] to where soul is and he runs to where so
[1:24:31] he's and he says unto so that the
[1:24:33] philistines have invaded the land so so
[1:24:37] at that time he's left with no
[1:24:39] alternative he's got to make a decision
[1:24:42] and the decision is i gotta go and
[1:24:44] defend the land
[1:24:46] so he leaves following david he calls
[1:24:49] all his men up that it surrounded david
[1:24:52] round about and he says to the people
[1:24:54] retreat
[1:24:56] because there is a more aging business
[1:24:58] and they retreat hallelujah and they go
[1:25:02] out amen now i'm on verse 27 hallelujah
[1:25:06] and they came in messenger unto saul
[1:25:08] saying his thee and come for the
[1:25:10] philistines have invaded the land
[1:25:12] wherefore saul returned from pursuing
[1:25:15] after david
[1:25:18] and went against the philistines
[1:25:20] therefore they called that place
[1:25:23] celekos
[1:25:26] the rock of our escape
[1:25:29] so david was now completely surrounded
[1:25:32] but then god he comes up with a way for
[1:25:36] him to escape completely contrary to the
[1:25:39] imaginations of saul completely unawares
[1:25:43] to what david was seeing but god comes
[1:25:46] as the escape route out of the place
[1:25:49] that david had found himself hallelujah
[1:25:52] so
[1:25:52] hammer liquor the rock of our escapes he
[1:25:56] became the escape route for david on
[1:25:59] that day
[1:26:00] oh i want somebody right here right now
[1:26:03] that might be trapped i want you to know
[1:26:06] that though you are trapped but there is
[1:26:08] a second there is a man a rock of escape

[1:26:15] cornered and there is no way out for you
[1:26:18] but i got some good news for you the

[1:26:26] happening behind the scenes jesus christ
[1:26:29] our god in glory he makes a way
[1:26:34] when satan thinks that it is done
[1:26:37] then god brings that policy and he says
[1:26:40] this one is insured
[1:26:43] angels

[1:29:04] and our rock has ears because moses was

[1:31:53] it for you my son now at mine you are
[1:31:57] called by my name
[1:32:01] hallelujah
[1:32:03] we read of a few examples
[1:32:06] of how god came to become a rock of
[1:32:08] escape
[1:32:10] how many love the bible
[1:32:12] let me just look at some scriptures here
[1:32:15] genesis chapter 20.
[1:32:17] the bible says and abraham janet from
[1:32:19] thence towards the south of towards the
[1:32:21] south country and dwelt between
[1:32:23] kardashian shaw
[1:32:27] and abraham said of sarah his wife she's
[1:32:29] my sister and abimelech king of gera
[1:32:32] sent and took sarah
[1:32:34] we know this story
[1:32:37] this is when abraham goes to this place
[1:32:40] and the king of gera he detects abraham
[1:32:43] because abraham it says that this sarah
[1:32:46] is my sister
[1:32:48] now abraham
[1:32:50] he's completely cornered
[1:32:52] he's got no way of getting out of this
[1:32:54] situation
[1:32:55] you know church there are times when you
[1:32:57] are beating all systems out
[1:32:59] and there's just no way for you to come
[1:33:01] out of a situation that's exactly what
[1:33:04] we find here abraham got into that
[1:33:06] position where he's completely cornered
[1:33:08] and there's no way for him to come out
[1:33:12] and i can imagine
[1:33:14] abraham is told we have come to take
[1:33:17] your wife because the king wants to
[1:33:18] marry
[1:33:21] your sister
[1:33:24] and the soldiers are just so happy
[1:33:27] to announce to abraham
[1:33:29] you are such a privileged man
[1:33:32] you're gonna be the king's
[1:33:34] brother-in-law
[1:33:37] and meanwhile abraham is burning
[1:33:42] says yes she's my half-sister but but
[1:33:45] but the wife is already gone
[1:33:48] but abraham is a man of god i believe
[1:33:51] then he went down on his knees and he
[1:33:53] started to pray
[1:33:54] he called on the name of his god
[1:33:57] and let's imagine that this was in the
[1:33:59] morning
[1:34:00] and abraham as he's praying is us
[1:34:02] christians you know when we are praying
[1:34:04] we want an answer to come running and
[1:34:06] right there
[1:34:07] abraham says you know what i know my god
[1:34:10] before 12 o'clock
[1:34:12] my wife is back here
[1:34:14] 12 o'clock comes no wife
[1:34:18] and he ups the gear and he says you know
[1:34:20] what let me pray until the evening time
[1:34:23] for in the evening time it shall be
[1:34:25] light
[1:34:26] i'm a message believer
[1:34:28] wait until seven o'clock seven is the
[1:34:31] number of god's completion he's quoting
[1:34:34] scriptures
[1:34:35] seven o'clock comes wife no wife
[1:34:39] ten o'clock
[1:34:40] no wife
[1:34:42] eleven o'clock
[1:34:44] no wife 12 midnight he gives up
[1:34:51] now when he has now given up
[1:34:53] beating all systems out oh glory to god
[1:34:56] and at that time when he's now beating
[1:34:58] all systems out salah malek
[1:35:01] steps in
[1:35:03] right there in the palace somehow amen
[1:35:07] just about the time when abraham was
[1:35:10] saying at seven o'clock something is
[1:35:12] gonna happen the king suddenly started
[1:35:14] to feel dizzy and he fell asleep and
[1:35:17] somewhere along there then the king had
[1:35:19] a dream and in that dream then god spoke
[1:35:22] to him and he says return this man's
[1:35:25] wife
[1:35:27] oh glory to god let me tell you church
[1:35:30] it does not matter that you don't see
[1:35:32] the answer right now but behind the
[1:35:34] scenes there is a god that is in action
[1:35:37] there are things that are happening
[1:35:39] there is god that is moving things into
[1:35:42] their places
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:45] abraham was not aware that god was
[1:35:48] sending a dream unto this king
[1:35:51] you are not aware that god is dealing
[1:35:54] with your situation in a realm where you
[1:35:56] don't understand
[1:35:58] oh just trust jesus
[1:36:01] hallelujah
[1:36:02] it is like what the prophet of god says
[1:36:05] about when shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:36:07] when they were thrown into the fairy
[1:36:09] fairness what they could see was the
[1:36:11] fire what they could see amen was the
[1:36:14] temptation and the trial that was in
[1:36:16] front of them but the prophet says let's
[1:36:18] turn the camera a little bit and let's
[1:36:21] look into heaven in heaven there was a
[1:36:24] jostling about hallelujah angels coming
[1:36:28] up saying let me go and i'll flag that
[1:36:30] water and god says ah just stay put
[1:36:33] another one comes says let me go and
[1:36:36] rescue them god says no this is a man's
[1:36:38] size job i'll go down myself or turn the
[1:36:42] camera and look what god is doing in a
[1:36:45] realm that you know nothing about there
[1:36:47] is something that is taking place
[1:36:49] sailor hamalek
[1:36:51] god is fixing a way of escape for you
[1:36:57] so abraham then you know he just wakes
[1:37:00] up because i believe they couldn't take
[1:37:02] sarah in the evening
[1:37:04] so they have to wait for the morning
[1:37:07] then abraham he wakes up he's now ots
[1:37:10] but then he sees a motorcade coming
[1:37:12] along
[1:37:13] and they come and they say hey so what's
[1:37:14] happening and they dropped sarah and
[1:37:16] they drove away then you know they are
[1:37:19] abraham as sarah so what took place
[1:37:21] sarah
[1:37:22] and sarah says i don't know
[1:37:24] the men just came you know when i
[1:37:26] arrived yesterday i was put in this nice
[1:37:28] little room and i was there all night
[1:37:31] so what happened until this morning
[1:37:34] these men just came and they said we
[1:37:36] have been given instruction to take you
[1:37:38] back to your husband
[1:37:40] and abraham says ah he knows i'm your
[1:37:42] husband
[1:37:44] how did he know
[1:37:46] i don't know
[1:37:47] celeko
[1:37:49] he goes to speak where you don't even
[1:37:52] know that he's speaking
[1:37:55] and he returned the man's wife
[1:37:57] a way of escape
[1:37:59] and not only it that happened but at the
[1:38:01] same time as well god according to verse
[1:38:04] number three but god came to abi like in
[1:38:06] a dream night and said to him behold
[1:38:09] thou art but a dead man for the woman
[1:38:12] which thou has taken for she is a man's
[1:38:14] wife but then watch verse number 17 so
[1:38:18] abraham prayed unto god and god healed
[1:38:21] abimelech and his wife and his
[1:38:22] maidsevens and their bear children for
[1:38:25] the lord had first closed up all the
[1:38:27] wombs of the house of abimelech
[1:38:31] so just the moment that
[1:38:33] they took sarah
[1:38:36] god moved
[1:38:38] and he shut up the wombs
[1:38:40] of all the women in that land
[1:38:43] of all the cattle in the land
[1:38:45] of all the flocks in the land
[1:38:48] that's what god does
[1:38:50] our god fights amen when we are not even
[1:38:53] aware that he is fighting
[1:38:55] let me take another example here in the
[1:38:58] book of second kings chapter 18
[1:39:00] now in the fourteenth year of king
[1:39:02] hezekiah the senate king of assyria come
[1:39:05] up against all the fence cities of judah
[1:39:07] and took them and rob shaka said unto
[1:39:10] them speaking now to hezekiah thus says
[1:39:12] the great king of assyria what
[1:39:15] confidence is this wherein thou trust us
[1:39:18] i've just read verse 13 and verse 19.
[1:39:21] you know the story
[1:39:23] this was in the days of hezekiah
[1:39:26] then in the days of hezekiah
[1:39:28] this king
[1:39:30] he comes to invert the king of syria he
[1:39:33] comes against hezekiah
[1:39:35] and he comes and he surrounds them
[1:39:38] and then when he comes now he starts to
[1:39:40] threaten them
[1:39:42] and he says
[1:39:43] which god has been able to deliver them
[1:39:46] let's look at verse 33 if any of the
[1:39:48] gods of the nations delivered it all his
[1:39:51] land out of the hand of the king of
[1:39:52] assyria where are the gods of hamath and
[1:39:55] of apart where are the gods of sephiroth
[1:39:57] hannah and eva have they delivered the
[1:40:00] have
[1:40:01] have they delivered samaria out of my
[1:40:03] hand
[1:40:04] who are they among all the gods of the
[1:40:07] countries that have delivered their
[1:40:09] country out of my hand and the lord
[1:40:11] should
[1:40:12] that the lord should deliver jerusalem
[1:40:14] out of my hand
[1:40:16] this man comes with a cv
[1:40:19] and he starts to court his cv
[1:40:22] and he says look at my cv
[1:40:25] where are the gods of ivor where are the
[1:40:28] gods of sephiroth where are the gods of
[1:40:30] henna where are the gods of ivor who has
[1:40:33] been able to save me to to save their
[1:40:36] land out of my hand
[1:40:39] and look at this church he says if they
[1:40:41] delivered samaria out of my hand
[1:40:45] at this time
[1:40:47] he had actually invaded samaria
[1:40:51] and samaria was besieged
[1:40:54] so hezekiah was the king of judah
[1:40:58] but at that time samaria had actually
[1:41:00] been taken
[1:41:02] so it's not even about the god of israel
[1:41:06] that's what he's trying to say
[1:41:08] which god has delivered
[1:41:11] but hezekiah he knew something better
[1:41:14] when the devil comes quoting his cv you
[1:41:17] gotta know where you stand with your god
[1:41:20] hallelujah this man was walking right he
[1:41:23] was not like the kings of israel the
[1:41:25] kings of israel the reason why that got
[1:41:28] away they got to is because they weren't
[1:41:30] walking right with god but when it came
[1:41:32] to hezekiah he was a man that was
[1:41:35] serving god when you know where you
[1:41:37] stand with your god don't be threatened
[1:41:40] by the cv of satan
[1:41:42] you say satan you want to give me your
[1:41:45] cv let me also read my the cv of my
[1:41:48] father
[1:41:49] then you pick your bible and he says
[1:41:52] let's start at genesis
[1:41:54] i'm gonna start right on genesis chapter
[1:41:56] one
[1:41:57] let's read together satan and by the
[1:41:59] time you get to genesis chapter 3 then
[1:42:02] you say satan look here i know who you
[1:42:05] are you are that serpent
[1:42:08] and by the time amen you come to the
[1:42:10] scripture of the seed of the woman that
[1:42:12] will bruise the head of the serpent you
[1:42:14] have defeated satan right there you can
[1:42:16] say i closed god's cv if you want some
[1:42:19] more come tomorrow
[1:42:21] he will flee from that moment onwards he
[1:42:24] will not even come because he knows you
[1:42:26] know where you stand
[1:42:28] you'll have a revelation of separate
[1:42:30] seeds
[1:42:32] and you can defeat satan any time
[1:42:35] oh glory to god
[1:42:37] i don't care how the devil comes to you
[1:42:40] no matter what he comes saying you know
[1:42:42] that you are a son of god
[1:42:45] so he came quoting all this and he says
[1:42:47] this is what i have done and this is
[1:42:50] what has happened and everything else
[1:42:53] but at that time you see hezekiah he
[1:42:55] made a mistake
[1:42:57] he was told now let's negotiate and when
[1:43:00] they started negotiating he said so what
[1:43:02] is it that you want and he says okay pay
[1:43:04] me 300 talents of gold and 300 talents
[1:43:07] of silva hezekiah went into the house of
[1:43:10] god he started ripping off the door
[1:43:12] handles he started ripping off
[1:43:13] everything that was god and he put it
[1:43:15] together and he paid this man
[1:43:18] and after he paid this man he thought
[1:43:20] there was going to be peace let me tell
[1:43:21] you saints never get into the trap of
[1:43:24] negotiating with satan
[1:43:26] he is not being to negotiate with
[1:43:29] you stand your ground
[1:43:31] and you say if i perish let me perish
[1:43:34] but i'm not negotiating with satan
[1:43:38] you see because when you negotiate with
[1:43:39] satan then satan will turn around and he
[1:43:42] will demand more
[1:43:46] and that's exactly what he did
[1:43:49] second kings chapter
[1:43:51] and isaiah said unto them thus shall he
[1:43:54] say to your master
[1:43:56] this was in hezekiah a man had now sent
[1:43:59] a message unto isaiah and he says you
[1:44:01] know we are in trouble here
[1:44:04] this day is a day of trouble
[1:44:07] the time to bring forth has come but
[1:44:09] there is no strength to bring forth then
[1:44:12] they send a message unto isaiah and
[1:44:14] isaiah sent a message back and isaiah
[1:44:17] said be not afraid of the words which
[1:44:20] thou has had by with which the servants
[1:44:23] of the king of assyria have blasphemed
[1:44:25] me
[1:44:26] behold i will send a blast upon him and
[1:44:30] he shall hear a rumor and shall return
[1:44:32] to his own land and i'll cause him to
[1:44:34] fall by the sword in his own land so rab
[1:44:37] shekhar returned and found the king of
[1:44:39] assyria warring against libna and for he
[1:44:42] had heard that he was departed from
[1:44:44] larkish
[1:44:45] exactly what happened with david
[1:44:49] god does exactly the same thing when
[1:44:52] hezekiah cries unto the lord then god
[1:44:55] comes amen and he causes a war to break
[1:44:58] out in another corner so that the king
[1:45:00] of assyria he leaves this place to go
[1:45:02] and defend his own grounds
[1:45:05] selah maleka
[1:45:08] and at that time amen then hezekiah is
[1:45:11] free
[1:45:12] but as i say church no matter what has
[1:45:14] happened never negotiate with the devil
[1:45:18] because then hezekiah he had negotiated
[1:45:20] with satan
[1:45:22] senator representing
[1:45:25] so he came back
[1:45:27] so in now in second kings chapter 19
[1:45:29] verse 14
[1:45:30] and hezekiah received the letter of the
[1:45:32] hand of the messengers and read it and
[1:45:34] hezekiah went up into the house of the
[1:45:36] lord and spread it before the lord and
[1:45:38] hezekiah prayed before the lord and said
[1:45:40] o god of israel which dwelleth between
[1:45:44] the cherubim thou art the god even thou
[1:45:46] alone of all the kingdom of the earth
[1:45:49] thou has made heaven and earth
[1:45:51] lord bow down thine ear and hear open
[1:45:55] lord thine eyes and see and hear the
[1:45:57] words of sennacherib which had sent him
[1:46:00] to reproach the living god of a truth
[1:46:03] lord the kings of assyria have destroyed
[1:46:05] the nations and their lands and they
[1:46:07] have cast their gods into the fire for
[1:46:10] they were no gods oh i like this man
[1:46:14] threatened
[1:46:15] but knew his position
[1:46:17] knew the god that he had served knew
[1:46:20] which god he was on his side he says
[1:46:23] they are talking about all this is
[1:46:25] showing me his cv but i know one thing
[1:46:27] those were not gods
[1:46:29] those were works of man's hands but thou
[1:46:32] alone are god
[1:46:34] now therefore o lord our god i beseech
[1:46:38] thee save thou ass out of his hand that
[1:46:41] all the kingdoms of the earth may know
[1:46:43] that thou art the lord god even thou
[1:46:46] only then isaiah the son of ammo sent to
[1:46:49] hezekiah saying thus says the lord god
[1:46:52] of israel that which thou has prayed to
[1:46:55] me against sin of carib king of assyria
[1:46:59] i have heard
[1:47:01] oh i like a church when it comes to a
[1:47:04] place when you are praying and you are
[1:47:06] crying before god and then god turns
[1:47:09] around and he says that which you have
[1:47:11] prayed i have heard
[1:47:15] what a consolation that is that which
[1:47:18] you have been crying about i have heard
[1:47:21] oh let me speak to somebody here you see
[1:47:24] god speaks in a very simple way the
[1:47:26] prophet of god says the closest place to
[1:47:29] heaven on earth is behind the pulpit
[1:47:33] how does god speak to us through the
[1:47:35] preaching of the word when you come to
[1:47:38] church praise the lord it is god that is
[1:47:41] going to be speaking to you when i come
[1:47:43] to church i don't come to hear a
[1:47:45] preacher
[1:47:47] i come to listen to what god is saying
[1:47:49] through the preacher
[1:47:51] even if i'm the preacher
[1:47:54] but i'm also waiting to hear what god is
[1:47:56] gonna say about my situation
[1:47:59] oh church i came to a place sometime in
[1:48:02] my life where i said you know what i got
[1:48:04] to be the first person to believe the
[1:48:06] message i preach
[1:48:09] i'm not here to preach to others i'm
[1:48:11] here to be preached to you as well so
[1:48:13] whilst the word is going forth i'm also
[1:48:16] feasting on exactly the same word
[1:48:19] so if there is gonna be a benefit oh
[1:48:21] glory to god that will come to the
[1:48:23] church let it not be the congregation
[1:48:25] only but let it also be me that starts
[1:48:28] by benefiting because i believe the
[1:48:30] preacher
[1:48:34] so when you come to church come

[1:48:43] situation and i've lined it up and read
[1:48:46] that which thou hast prayed to god amen

[1:50:19] this is the word that the lord has
[1:50:21] spoken concerning him the virgin the

[1:52:36] don't belong in your arm he don't belong
[1:52:38] in the church of the living god
[1:52:40] therefore thus says the lord concerning
[1:52:43] the king of assyria he shall not come
[1:52:45] into this city nor shoot an arrow there
[1:52:48] nor come before it with a shield nor

[1:52:55] shall he return and shall not come into
[1:52:58] the city says the lord for i will defend
[1:53:01] this city to save it for my own sake and
[1:53:04] for my servant david sack
[1:53:07] oh let me say to somebody this afternoon
[1:53:10] the lord would defend this city

[1:53:34] city and i will save it verse 35 and it
[1:53:37] came to pass that night that the angel
[1:53:40] of the lord went out and smote the camp
[1:53:43] of the assyrians in a hundred four score
[1:53:46] and five thousand and when they arose in
[1:53:48] the morning behold they were all dead
[1:53:51] corpses
[1:53:53] israel did not need to fight
[1:53:56] seller hammer lakoth
[1:53:58] he went in the middle of the night and
[1:54:01] he was the way of escape he smote them

[1:54:56] know what when i wake up i'll find dead
[1:54:59] corpses
[1:55:01] i'll find my battles already been won or
[1:55:04] glory to god
[1:55:06] so senator king of assyria departed and
[1:55:09] went and returned and dwelt in nineveh
[1:55:12] and it came to pass as he was worshiping
[1:55:14] in the house of nescor his god that
[1:55:17] adramalek and shereza his sons smote him
[1:55:21] with a sword
[1:55:22] and that was the end of the king of
[1:55:24] assyria
[1:55:26] don't play with the children of god
[1:55:28] [Applause]
[1:55:29] all church of the living god
[1:55:31] there are so many examples
[1:55:34] that we find in the world
[1:55:36] but as we are fixing to come to a clause
[1:55:39] but let me come to david again here
[1:55:43] celekov
[1:55:44] is what david called the name of that
[1:55:46] place
[1:55:48] i believe it was david that code is
[1:55:52] because he had the revelation of what
[1:55:54] had happened
[1:55:55] but i want you to watch by
[1:55:57] interpretation
[1:56:00] it is not the rock of our escape
[1:56:03] as in singular
[1:56:04] but it is the rock of our escapes
[1:56:08] as in plural
[1:56:11] why is it the rock of our escapes
[1:56:13] hallelujah
[1:56:16] when david said selah maleco
[1:56:19] verse 28 here
[1:56:20] it was in the rock of escape which was a
[1:56:23] single escape but it was the rock of
[1:56:26] escapes
[1:56:28] david at this time
[1:56:30] he had experienced many escapes
[1:56:33] twice he escaped the javelin
[1:56:37] he had also escaped the plot of soul
[1:56:40] when he said i want a 104 skins for my
[1:56:42] diary
[1:56:43] here he's kept the plot of saul when he
[1:56:46] wanted to use his daughter to slay david
[1:56:50] so david had experienced many a time how
[1:56:53] the escape of god had come so he knew i
[1:56:56] am where i am not because i am smart not
[1:57:00] because i am able but with him i can run
[1:57:03] through a troop with him i've lived over
[1:57:06] a wall it is through jesus that i've
[1:57:08] been able to do what i do so he says
[1:57:11] seller hammer record the rock of escapes
[1:57:16] and what does that tell me church what
[1:57:18] it tells me is that god is not a god of
[1:57:21] a single escape
[1:57:22] he's a god of many escapes
[1:57:25] and what he tells me is that he is the
[1:57:27] same yesterday today and forever and let
[1:57:30] me say if god ever gives you an escape
[1:57:32] the same god if you are found in another
[1:57:35] trap he will give you another escape
[1:57:37] because he's the rock of escapes he's
[1:57:40] not a rock of one escape he's a rock of
[1:57:42] escapes if you have any testimony in
[1:57:45] your life no matter what the devil puts
[1:57:47] you in you can look back into your
[1:57:49] testimony and you say the god of
[1:57:51] yesterday he's still the same god even
[1:57:55] today
[1:57:56] oh he has a testimony here something
[1:57:59] that happened some years back something
[1:58:01] that you can look back to and you can
[1:58:03] say it was in that year of 2000 god came
[1:58:07] to my rescue it was in that year of 2010
[1:58:11] god came to my rescue i'm saying the
[1:58:14] same god is here present and he's here
[1:58:17] to rescue you the rock of your escapes
[1:58:22] and let me say church whenever you have
[1:58:24] a testimony
[1:58:26] be in the habit
[1:58:28] of recording your testimony
[1:58:31] of keeping evidences of your testimonies
[1:58:36] hallelujah jacob when he was coming from
[1:58:40] his home running from esau going to lab
[1:58:43] and his father-in-law he came to a
[1:58:45] certain place that was called battle and
[1:58:48] he had an experience at that place and
[1:58:50] it better after hearing experience the
[1:58:53] bible says he erected a stone there
[1:58:58] hallelujah
[1:58:59] he placed it right there as a memorial
[1:59:02] and you find when jacob is now coming
[1:59:05] back to his land amen he stays in
[1:59:08] another place but eventually then god
[1:59:11] speaks to him and he says return to
[1:59:13] bethel where i first met you
[1:59:17] there was a sign
[1:59:18] that he left at that place
[1:59:20] let me say when god does something for
[1:59:22] you take
[1:59:24] a testimony
[1:59:26] if it means taking a picture take a
[1:59:28] picture if it means writing something
[1:59:31] write it
[1:59:32] if it means filing it file it why should
[1:59:35] you do it because you know there are
[1:59:37] times when the devil will begin to rage
[1:59:40] and he will begin to tell you that god
[1:59:42] has forsaken you but when the devil
[1:59:44] comes like that open your notebook
[1:59:48] and you start with him the year that you
[1:59:50] repented oh praise be to god and say it
[1:59:54] was in this year's satan 20 years ago i
[1:59:58] met the lord two years later he gave me
[2:00:00] the baptism of the holy ghost and i
[2:00:03] recorded the day five years later he
[2:00:06] came to my rescue ten years later this
[2:00:08] is what happened in my life another year
[2:00:11] this is what happened in my life and
[2:00:13] brother before you finish naming your
[2:00:15] testimonies satan is already on the door
[2:00:18] he's already left your house before you
[2:00:21] step into a depression
[2:00:23] read your testimonies tell the old man
[2:00:26] devil i know who i am i know where i
[2:00:29] came from i know where i'm going i'm not
[2:00:32] an accident and i'm not an incident i'm
[2:00:35] a servant of god
[2:00:38] oh who am i speaking to here
[2:00:41] that can say yes
[2:00:43] i i know who i am
[2:00:45] i have some testimonies in my life you
[2:00:48] know every believer is going to have
[2:00:49] some testimonies
[2:00:51] somewhere where you can point back to
[2:00:53] and you can say god came to my rescue on
[2:00:55] such and such a day
[2:00:58] hallelujah
[2:00:59] so david had experienced these escapes
[2:01:03] then david he now comes in psalms
[2:01:05] chapter 124 and this is where i'm going
[2:01:08] to finish off it
[2:01:10] praise the lord
[2:01:12] and david writes and he says if it had
[2:01:14] not been for the lord
[2:01:16] who was on our side
[2:01:19] now may israel say and i want you to
[2:01:22] read your names into the scripture
[2:01:25] if it had not been for the lord who was
[2:01:28] on our side let spirit and truth
[2:01:30] tabernacle say
[2:01:33] we are here
[2:01:35] by the grace of the lord
[2:01:37] if it had not been for the lord who was
[2:01:40] on our side if it had not been for the
[2:01:42] lord who was on our side when men rose
[2:01:45] up against us then they had swallowed us
[2:01:48] up quick when their wrath was kindled
[2:01:51] against us
[2:01:53] blessed be the lord who have not given
[2:01:55] us as they pray to their teeth our soul

[2:02:02] the fowler the snare is broken and we

[2:05:54] deliverance is here
[2:05:56] praise god in the eyes but i want you to
[2:05:59] watch something here he says our soul
[2:06:03] is escaped
[2:06:05] as a bed out of a snare of a foul the
[2:06:08] snare is broken we are escaped
[2:06:13] look david the way he
[2:06:14] speaks he is talking about a physical
[2:06:17] escape
[2:06:19] but yet he says what has escaped is his
[2:06:22] soul
[2:06:27] our soul
[2:06:29] is escaped
[2:06:31] but yet the escape was physical
[2:06:34] so how does it become a soul escape
[2:06:37] what day if it is telling us here is
[2:06:39] that there is a source of power
[2:06:42] there is a rock of so-so
[2:06:46] and what is so-so the prophet says he
[2:06:48] says that spiritually and he saves us
[2:06:51] physically
[2:06:53] and when he saves you spiritually
[2:06:55] it has got to translate to physically
[2:07:00] you can be saved spiritually and remain
[2:07:03] in bondage physically
[2:07:07] our soul
[2:07:09] is escaped
[2:07:10] and if the sow is escaped then they must
[2:07:13] be physical
[2:07:15] escape as well god bless you this
[2:07:17] afternoon

[2:07:33] devil's desires
