[30:08] always great [music] to see Lord God
[30:11] those who have gone on before Lord,
[30:13] still standing and pressing the battle,
[30:15] Lord, driving over the dangerous
[30:16] highways, [music]
[30:17] Lord Jesus. And you allowed them to come
[30:20] here, Lord, just to see their smiling
[30:22] faces, [music] their uplifted hands,
[30:24] Lord, and singing the praises of God,
[30:26] Lord. It moves upon our hearts, Lord.
[30:28] We're grateful, Lord. We're grateful for
[30:30] this congregation of your people,
[30:32] believers, Lord Jesus, who love your
[30:34] word, Lord. And Lord, just just believe
[30:37] everything that you say. Father, we
[30:39] [music] just ask almighty God, Lord, as
[30:42] these requests have come before us.
[30:44] Tony, his wife, [music] Lord Jesus,
[30:46] Lord, been stricken with a heart attack.
[30:49] Father, she needs a touch from you,
[30:50] Lord. Father, as we sung the songs, we
[30:53] know that you are the healer, Lord
[30:55] Jesus. Only you can heal. The darkness
[30:57] can do what they can, Father, but it
[31:00] takes a touch [music] from you. Just one
[31:02] word, Lord Jesus, and everything will be
[31:04] settled. So, Father, we [music] ask,
[31:06] almighty God, that you move mightily
[31:08] upon her body, Lord, heal her. Make her
[31:10] completely whole. And may she know and
[31:12] testify that the mighty hand of God
[31:14] [music] has raised her up. Father, we
[31:17] pray also for brother Maris's family,
[31:19] Lord, for his siblings, Lord. Father, I
[31:21] know he desires, Lord, [music] to see
[31:23] them saved, Lord, how my heart beats for
[31:25] my sins, Lord. But Father, we just ask
[31:28] Lord do that which only you can do.
[31:31] Father, we [music] hold the token over
[31:33] our loved ones, Lord. And we're
[31:34] believing for them, Lord, that some way,
[31:36] [music] somehow we'll see that see them
[31:39] on that great mountain of New Jerusalem,
[31:41] Father. Father, we pray over each of our
[31:44] brothers [music] and sisters, Lord.
[31:45] Whatever they have need of this morning,
[31:47] Father, may the testimonies from Friday
[31:49] night begin to pour through, Lord Jesus.
[31:52] Oh father, may they even feel Lord
[31:54] whatever they need coming through them
[31:55] even now Lord. Father we pray [music]
[31:58] now over our giving. We ask Father that
[32:00] you'll move mightily upon the givers
[32:03] Lord Jesus and bless them Lord. Perform
[32:05] your good word Lord concerning your
[32:07] promises [music] concerning all that
[32:09] they have need of. Bless brother Nathan
[32:11] Lord. We trust that you have
[32:13] strengthened his body and his voice
[32:14] [music]
[32:15] Lord that there are no issues Father
[32:17] God. And Father, we know Lord God that
[32:19] your servant is coming to speak your
[32:21] word. Father, we are [music] believers.
[32:23] So whatever you say, no matter what it
[32:25] is, we believe. So Father, anoint our
[32:27] brother Aresh, Lord, and use them
[32:29] mightily that we all may hear, believe,
[32:31] and rejoice over the goodness of God.
[32:33] It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[32:36] Amen. Amen. God bless you, Sister Sarah.
[32:52] God bless you. Please sing with me.

[45:06] Amen.
[45:08] Thinking earlier this morning as [music]
[45:11] we were in prayer, I said, you know, the
[45:13] um being able to to bless people is one
[45:17] of the best things that we could do.
[45:20] Uh brother Random say the greatest
[45:22] [music] three words [snorts] that you
[45:24] could ever say to anybody is God bless
[45:27] you. And I just want you to turn around,
[45:29] find somebody that you can just say,
[45:32] "God bless you." God [music] bless you.
[45:37] Hallelujah.
[45:39] Softly. [music] Softly. Keep going
[45:41] softly. Everybody. Everybody.
[45:43] Hallelujah. Come on. Tell them God bless
[45:46] you.
[45:49] [singing]
[45:52] Amen.
[45:55] Amen. [music and singing]
[45:58] God bless you my brother. God bless you
[46:00] my sister.
[46:04] Praise God.
[46:08] This morning we are
[46:11] [music] blessed to have
[46:13] my dear friend and brother uh brother
[46:16] Nathan Bryant with us. Amen. All the way
[46:19] from
[46:20] Jeffersonville, Indiana, New Albany,
[46:23] Indiana is where the church. [music] But
[46:26] um we thank God he's the pastor of
[46:28] Church of the Open Door there in uh in
[46:31] [music] Indiana and he brought his
[46:33] oldest son Philillip with him. Amen. On
[46:36] this journey. So it's so good to have
[46:38] them with us.
[46:41] And on Friday night, we had a a
[46:44] wonderful service. the Lord just [music]
[46:46] blessed and um and afterwards like
[46:48] brother Simba said earlier we had a
[46:50] prayer line and and I believe [music]
[46:52] that through that prayer line there's
[46:54] going to be many manifestations.
[46:56] Amen. Praise God.
[47:00] So this this morning, Amen. I want him
[47:03] to come in his own way and just you just
[47:07] [music] pray for him. The enemy has been
[47:08] attacking his his his voice uh but he's
[47:11] pressed his way through to come and
[47:13] bring a word to the people. So we call
[47:16] the devil [music] a liar.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we claim the victory. So let's
[47:21] receive.
[47:23] Amen. My friend and my brother, brother
[47:25] Nathan Bryan. God bless you.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's [music] good to be back in
[47:40] church.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the presence of the
[47:43] Lord.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was thinking back there as
[47:46] [music] you were singing that song uh
[47:50] may his blessings be upon you and uh I
[47:53] was reminded of a testimony I heard
[47:56] brother Billy Paul give years ago
[47:59] and [music] he came out the church had
[48:02] been just worshiping praising the Lord
[48:04] and and the very first thing he said was
[48:08] I like the way [music] you worship.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; So I echo that this morning. I like the
[48:15] way you worship. Amen. [music] It's good
[48:18] to be with believers of like precious
[48:20] faith and a lot of familiar faces, a lot
[48:22] of good friends [music] and certainly
[48:25] appreciate each and everyone. I've
[48:26] enjoyed brother Solomon's singing and
[48:28] all the fellowship and the the
[48:31] hospitality and uh I was a little
[48:34] disappointed this trip. I didn't get to
[48:36] spend [music] as much time with brother
[48:37] Jack as I wanted to because I kept
[48:40] trying to rest my voice as much as I
[48:41] could for these services. But, uh, that
[48:44] just means we'll have to get together
[48:45] again sometime. And he he has he [music]
[48:48] has a tendency to come our way a little
[48:50] more often these days. So, next time
[48:52] he's up, maybe we can spend some more
[48:54] time together. But, Amen. Thank you,
[48:56] musicians. I wish I had the voice to
[48:58] sing, but I don't. So, we're just going
[48:59] to go straight to the to the scriptures.
[49:02] Amen. You love the word.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Believers love the word because
[49:07] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word.
[49:10] And I want to look at this thought this
[49:13] morning. And as [clears throat] soon as
[49:15] brother Jack and I had talked about uh
[49:18] me coming this this way, uh I thought of
[49:22] this this sermon and I've had it on my
[49:25] heart um the entire time and and was
[49:28] going back over some things um yesterday
[49:32] and just seemed like the Lord was just
[49:33] confirming that. And so we want to look
[49:36] at this thought this morning of the
[49:37] power of committ. The power of committ.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 37 and verse three.
[49:46] Very familiar scripture.
[49:50] And again I I preached this back home as
[49:53] a three-part series, but I won't try to
[49:55] preach three sermons to you. We just hit
[49:57] the highlights of it. Psalm 37:3, "Trust
[50:01] in the Lord and do good." So shalt thou
[50:06] dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt
[50:10] be fed.
[50:12] Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he
[50:15] shall give thee the desires
[50:19] of thine heart. Does your Bible say
[50:22] that?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he
[50:26] shall give thee the desires of thine
[50:30] heart.
[50:32] Now, I'm not trying to add to the word
[50:34] this morning, but I found in my life by
[50:36] God's grace, it's not anything I've
[50:38] done, but it's what he's done that many
[50:40] times he will actually give us more than
[50:44] our hearts desire.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Because many times God has something
[50:48] better for us
[50:49] &gt;&gt; than what we could have planned.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And we see that in many aspects of life.
[50:54] Maybe it's a uh maybe it's a brother
[50:56] trying to find a wife or a sister trying
[50:58] to find a husband and they meet somebody
[51:01] they think, "Oh, this is the one." And
[51:03] they begin to beg and pray, "Oh, God,
[51:05] let this be the one." And and Lord, just
[51:07] I want your perfect will. And and and
[51:10] they just they think for sure this is
[51:12] going to be the best thing and that's
[51:14] what they want. And then years later,
[51:17] they look back and I'm preaching on
[51:19] myself this morning and they say, "Oh
[51:22] my, God had something so much better in
[51:24] store for me than what I had planned
[51:27] &gt;&gt; and what I had asked for that his plans
[51:31] were so much better than anything I
[51:33] could have ever planned." Sometimes we
[51:35] go on a career path or sometimes we we
[51:38] we're trying to apply for a college or
[51:40] whatever it be and we have in our heart,
[51:41] Lord, this is what I want. And God
[51:44] blesses us beyond what we could want.
[51:46] And we're not here I don't believe in
[51:48] preaching prosperity, but I do believe
[51:50] in preaching provision.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That God said he was a provider.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm not going to promise you,
[51:59] hey, if you believe this message, God's
[52:01] going to give you a Lamborghini. No, the
[52:03] word doesn't say that.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; But it did say he would provide for all
[52:09] your needs.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:12] Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he
[52:15] shall give thee the desires
[52:18] of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the
[52:22] Lord.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust also
[52:27] in him, and he shall bring it to pass.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Before we pray, I want to read you a
[52:34] quote here. Life story 1951.
[52:37] Brother Ram said, "If someone talks
[52:38] about you and you talk back about them,
[52:43] God can't fight your battle."
[52:49] &gt;&gt; If someone talks about you and you talk
[52:52] back about them, God can't fight your
[52:54] battle. You're fighting it yourself.
[52:56] See,
[52:58] &gt;&gt; just let loose and let him do it
[53:02] &gt;&gt; and just commit it to him.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The greatest weapon that
[53:07] I know of of a Christian today is a
[53:11] committal to God.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; When you can't do nothing about it, just
[53:17] commit it to him
[53:19] &gt;&gt; and God will take care of it.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe we could just dismiss
[53:25] and go home and say, "Praise the Lord."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; If we can just get that much and really
[53:29] apply it, we'll be doing all right.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Lord
[53:33] Jesus, we thank you for this atmosphere
[53:36] of worship. Lord, we thank you for the
[53:39] songs that we've heard. We thank you for
[53:41] the gifts that you've placed in the body
[53:43] of Christ. Lord, we thank you for this
[53:45] church. Lord, we thank you for the
[53:48] pastor and the musicians, the deacons,
[53:50] the trustees, and everyone that puts
[53:52] their shoulder to the wheel to help,
[53:54] whether it's in tithes or offerings or
[53:56] Lord, helping in in acts of service or
[53:59] whatever it would be. Father, we thank
[54:00] you for each and everyone. Lord, for
[54:03] sister Erica and sister Sarah standing
[54:05] faithfully behind brother Jack, Lord,
[54:07] and the different ones, Lord, family
[54:09] members and friends. And Lord, we we
[54:13] have such a history, Lord, with this
[54:15] group of believers here. And we're so
[54:16] thankful for their friendship. We're
[54:18] thankful for their stand for the word.
[54:20] And Lord, I just pray that you would
[54:22] help me to get myself out of the way.
[54:25] Lord, I've tried to do everything I know
[54:26] how to do to study and to prepare. Lord,
[54:29] I've tried to preserve my voice and not
[54:31] talk more than I had to in fellowship
[54:33] and tried to Lord soothe it with every
[54:36] kind of oil and drink and and cough drop
[54:39] and lozener that I could think of, Lord,
[54:42] to try to be prepared this morning and
[54:44] have as as much voice as I could. But
[54:46] Lord, if you'll just come on the scene
[54:48] and touch my voice, Lord, then we know
[54:50] it'll all be all right. And Father, we
[54:53] just give this service to you. I pray
[54:55] that the efforts of each one, myself
[54:57] included, would not be in vain, but that
[54:59] you would do something this morning to
[55:01] strengthen your children, to give us a
[55:03] closer walk with you, Lord, and a closer
[55:06] fellowship with you. We'll give you the
[55:08] glory f for it, Lord. May we walk from
[55:11] this building closer to you than when we
[55:13] came in in Jesus Christ's name.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. And you can be
[55:18] seated this morning. Um, I'm going to
[55:20] try my best to to work through this as
[55:23] quickly as we can. Uh, because I I have
[55:25] quite a bit of material that I want to
[55:27] try to get to, but I also want to be
[55:29] sensitive to the Holy Spirit. But
[55:30] there's some things in here that I
[55:32] believe especially there's two
[55:34] principles uh that I I want to express
[55:37] to you that are scriptural and
[55:40] messagebased principles that we'll read
[55:42] quotes and scriptures about. Um, and if
[55:45] we can just apply these principles in
[55:48] our life to whatever it is that you have
[55:51] need of this morning. Maybe it's a
[55:53] backsliden loved one that you're praying
[55:55] for. Maybe it's a teenager that's
[55:57] struggling. Maybe it's a a financial
[56:00] situation. Maybe it's a a a decision
[56:03] about your dwelling place. Maybe you're
[56:05] praying about moving or or I know some
[56:07] travel distance and you're praying about
[56:09] moving closer or whatever it would be.
[56:12] Maybe it's a job change or maybe it's a
[56:14] school decision, where to send your kids
[56:16] to school or what college to choose for
[56:19] yourself. And and I want to place two
[56:22] principles before you this morning that
[56:24] I believe if we can apply these, not
[56:27] only will it take away a lot of our
[56:29] stress and anxiety over these things,
[56:32] but it'll equip us to just let God take
[56:34] care of things and and not beat our head
[56:37] against the wall. So, brother Bam said
[56:39] this this this uh power of committ
[56:43] was the the greatest weapon that he knew
[56:46] of to the Christian today was a
[56:47] committal to God. So, I want to look at
[56:49] this word and then it's going to break
[56:51] down into several other words that we're
[56:53] going to look at. The word committ
[56:57] Webster's dictionary, the word committ
[57:00] means commitment or consignment. The
[57:04] word commitment means an agreement or
[57:06] pledge to do something in the future or
[57:10] an act of committing to a charge or a
[57:14] trust. So in other words, for instance,
[57:17] if you uh maybe you own a little bit of
[57:20] property or you have some savings or
[57:22] investments and and you your wife and
[57:24] children are there and and you want it
[57:26] set up to where if anything happens to
[57:28] you that that is going to get dispersed
[57:31] in the way that you want it to be. And
[57:33] so you set up a trust for your family
[57:36] that even after you're gone, there are
[57:38] going to be people in charge of making
[57:41] sure that is taken care of. Then you
[57:43] don't worry about it anymore. You don't
[57:45] keep going back and looking. Now is that
[57:46] is that still there? It is a trust that
[57:49] has been established that you know if
[57:51] anything happens to you, it's taken care
[57:53] of.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; And so that's what a commitment is. An
[57:56] act of committing to a charge or a
[57:58] trust. Now it this word committ also
[58:00] means to consign which means to give
[58:03] over to another's care to give to
[58:07] transfer or deliver into the hands or
[58:10] control of another. Now, I just want to
[58:13] say as a pastor, uh, when you have
[58:16] deacon brothers and trustee brothers and
[58:18] you're praying about, Lord, who should I
[58:19] put in here or there or whatever it be,
[58:21] as a pastor, you're looking for somebody
[58:23] that you can commit something to that,
[58:26] well, uh, you know, I need the doors
[58:28] open at a certain time and, you know,
[58:29] you're not going to lay awake all night
[58:31] wondering, is brother so and so going to
[58:33] be there? You've committed it to him and
[58:36] you've got confidence in him. either
[58:37] he's going to be there or if he gets in
[58:39] a wreck on the way to church or
[58:40] whatever, he's going to contact somebody
[58:43] else to take care of it. I've got
[58:45] confidence in him. If something needs
[58:47] done, I can tell this brother, "Go do
[58:49] this." And I've got confidence in him. I
[58:51] can commit that to him that then I don't
[58:53] have to micromanage the situation
[58:56] because they're going to have the
[58:57] ability to take care of that. Now, if we
[59:00] can do that in the natural, then how
[59:02] much more to the Lord Jesus
[59:04] &gt;&gt; if we say we're going to commit
[59:06] something to him.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to commit it to the
[59:11] Lord, Brother Nathan, and then you're
[59:13] trying to get involved in it and fix it
[59:15] the next day.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to lay it at the altar,
[59:18] Brother Nathan. And then the next day,
[59:20] you're back at it trying to get in the
[59:22] middle of it and fix it all yourself.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That's not committal.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:28] Praise the Lord.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Now, these I I normally, you know, we
[59:32] would wait till the end of the sermon to
[59:33] kind of establish what what the whole of
[59:36] what we're trying to look at here. But I
[59:37] want to just give you early on just a
[59:39] sneak peek at at the two things that
[59:42] we're trying to establish. And then
[59:43] we're going to go over some quotes and
[59:45] scriptures to establish that. But the
[59:47] first principle that I want to establish
[59:49] this morning is don't plant a seed and
[59:53] then dig it back up and check on it.
[1:00:00] Don't plant a seed and then go out the
[1:00:02] next morning and say, "Well, I don't
[1:00:03] have a stalk of corn yet. I better dig
[1:00:06] it up and check it. Make sure make sure
[1:00:08] no animal got in there and ate on it or
[1:00:10] something." So, you dig it up. Yeah, it
[1:00:12] looks okay. Looks like a seed. And then
[1:00:14] you plant it again the next day. And
[1:00:16] then, well, I better check on it
[1:00:18] tomorrow. I don't see any sprouts or
[1:00:19] anything. Go back and dig it up the next
[1:00:21] day. That's not how seed planting works.
[1:00:24] That's right.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; The second principle that I want to
[1:00:28] establish with you with you which goes
[1:00:29] right along with it is this phrase
[1:00:32] commit it and forget it.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Commit it
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; and forget it. Now, we're going to look
[1:00:40] at some family things first because I
[1:00:42] feel like uh that is our greatest desire
[1:00:46] just like Hattie writes was uh prophet
[1:00:49] of God offered her speak anything that
[1:00:53] you want
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; and you can have it.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And she didn't say, "Oh, I'm going to be
[1:00:58] driving in a Rolls-Royce tomorrow."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; She didn't say, "Oh, I'm going to have a
[1:01:03] million dollars in the bank."
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; She had a little crippled sister there.
[1:01:07] She had a elderly father there. She had
[1:01:10] things in the natural of physical
[1:01:12] healing that she could have asked. And
[1:01:14] brother Bam actually thought that it was
[1:01:16] going to be Edith that what she was
[1:01:17] going to ask. He said, "Oh, I thought in
[1:01:19] just a moment Edith is going to be
[1:01:21] standing out of that wheelchair who's
[1:01:23] been paralyzed with infantile paralysis
[1:01:25] her entire life." and Hadtie says, "The
[1:01:28] salvation of my children,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; the greatest desire that a a mother or
[1:01:36] father could have."
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And so many times in our family
[1:01:40] decisions, if we're not careful, we we
[1:01:44] try to be the one to well, we're going
[1:01:47] to fix this and we're going to help this
[1:01:49] and we're going to put our hand to this
[1:01:50] situation. But I want to look at some
[1:01:52] principles this morning that brother
[1:01:54] Benham sets forth for us. And he answers
[1:01:56] some wonderful questions and questions
[1:01:58] and answers along these lines. This one
[1:02:00] is just very much a natural thing that
[1:02:02] maybe you think if I could have asked
[1:02:03] the prophet something, this isn't what I
[1:02:06] would have asked for. But if you're in
[1:02:07] this situation this morning, maybe it is
[1:02:10] what you would have asked for. And they
[1:02:12] ask him, "Why can't we sell our house?"
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; They can ask him about the millennium.
[1:02:20] They can ask him uh h about you know
[1:02:23] what whatever they want to ask any great
[1:02:26] doctrinal question they they can ask him
[1:02:29] uh what about my future what about my
[1:02:32] children what about my health but this
[1:02:34] is what's pressing to them in this
[1:02:36] moment
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; in this stage of their life why can't we
[1:02:39] sell our house
[1:02:42] we have prayed and fasted to sell it yet
[1:02:46] no results well I'm glad they asked him
[1:02:49] this question. Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, well, well, now brother
[1:02:53] or sister, they don't sign their name,
[1:02:55] whatever who it is." Now, you're trying
[1:02:57] to sell your property and you've done
[1:02:58] what you you want to sell it and
[1:03:00] probably for to buy some more or
[1:03:03] whatever you want to do. I don't know if
[1:03:05] if you want to if your objective is
[1:03:07] right, you're trying to buy a home. If
[1:03:09] you got children or something like that,
[1:03:11] you want to get them a better home or
[1:03:13] something. I don't know what it's all
[1:03:15] about, but I'd say this. If you're
[1:03:17] trying to sell it and fasting and trying
[1:03:20] to sell it, then commit it to the Lord
[1:03:23] and forget about it.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Commit it and forget it.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Now, notice he doesn't rebuke them and
[1:03:32] say, "Now, don't you know the scripture
[1:03:34] says you should just be content in what
[1:03:37] whatsoever state you're in?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Why would you want a better house?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Why would you want a better car? Why
[1:03:44] would you you know uh sometimes we can
[1:03:47] go out on extremes
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; and then sometimes we can go out on the
[1:03:50] other extreme where we become just
[1:03:52] everything is material and monetary and
[1:03:55] that's our focus instead of things of
[1:03:56] God. But you know I never find it in the
[1:03:59] scripture where where we can't ask for
[1:04:00] something better. But it's that we're
[1:04:03] content in the state that we're in until
[1:04:05] God gives us something better.
[1:04:08] Not, Lord, I'm not satisfied with where
[1:04:10] I'm at, but Lord, you know, I appreciate
[1:04:11] what you've done for me, but I believe
[1:04:13] you've got something even better for me.
[1:04:15] That's all right to have that kind of
[1:04:16] attitude.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Commit it to the Lord and forget
[1:04:20] about it. See, because it might be that
[1:04:22] God, you might move somewhere else and
[1:04:26] it might not be right. See, if you're a
[1:04:28] Christian and trust in the Lord, because
[1:04:30] you surely are, or you wouldn't be
[1:04:33] fasting and praying. See,
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; so I just commit it to the Lord. Say,
[1:04:38] "Now, Lord, when you're time for us to
[1:04:40] sell it, you'll send a buyer. Then it's
[1:04:43] committed to the Lord. Take your hands
[1:04:46] off it and go ahead. I believe it'll
[1:04:51] work.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I believe it'll work."
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he's he's talking about that
[1:04:58] with something that's just a material
[1:05:00] thing, a home, but it's something that's
[1:05:03] important to them. We've tried to sell
[1:05:04] this house. We've prayed about it. We've
[1:05:07] fasted about it, and yet we don't see
[1:05:08] any results. And he tells them, just
[1:05:10] commit it and forget it. Now, he says in
[1:05:15] God's provided way in 1953, he's talking
[1:05:17] about about sister Rebecca, his his
[1:05:20] daughter, and he says she's already been
[1:05:23] committed to the Lord or we call it
[1:05:26] dedication.
[1:05:28] Already been committed to the Lord or we
[1:05:30] call it dedication. Now, I read this
[1:05:32] quote a while back and I was studying
[1:05:34] some things about the family. And I was
[1:05:36] reading along the lines that we're about
[1:05:38] to look at of things he says about
[1:05:39] Sister Rebecca when she's a teenager
[1:05:41] that I'm thankful that he was
[1:05:43] transparent enough to share those things
[1:05:45] with us about his family because then
[1:05:47] when your family or my family or
[1:05:50] somebody else's family goes through
[1:05:51] similar things, then we don't have to
[1:05:53] feel like, "Oh my goodness, we we just
[1:05:55] must be unbelievers. We just must be
[1:05:57] failures as parents or our children must
[1:06:00] be failures because they're not perfect.
[1:06:02] Well, you know, I haven't met a perfect
[1:06:04] child yet.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And I haven't met a perfect parent yet.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I haven't met a
[1:06:10] perfect deacon or a perfect trustee or a
[1:06:12] perfect pastor. And I told somebody a
[1:06:15] while back, I said, if God gave you a
[1:06:16] perfect pastor, you wouldn't be able to
[1:06:18] handle it because you're not perfect and
[1:06:20] you wouldn't be able to relate to them.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] So, brother Brandham says she's already
[1:06:30] been committed to the Lord or we call it
[1:06:32] dedication. Now, I I find, you know,
[1:06:36] having teenagers myself now and you
[1:06:38] [clears throat] pray for me, I've got
[1:06:39] three teenagers right now in the house.
[1:06:41] And so, I've got a few more, you can see
[1:06:43] maybe since I was here last, I've got a
[1:06:45] few more white hair than I used to have.
[1:06:48] Some of you know what that's like.
[1:06:53] And God's blessed us with good children.
[1:06:56] But I [clears throat] haven't met a
[1:06:57] perfect teenager yet.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; I haven't met a perfect parent yet. And
[1:07:02] so in thinking of some of these things
[1:07:03] with our own children and in thinking of
[1:07:05] some of the things going on with some of
[1:07:07] the youth at our church and things like
[1:07:08] that, I I began to think about this and
[1:07:10] I ran across this quote and the parallel
[1:07:13] was was was just astonishing to me
[1:07:16] because you know when a when a child is
[1:07:18] brought into the world and and we're a
[1:07:21] believing family, a Christian family, a
[1:07:24] message believing family and that child
[1:07:26] gets up to be a few weeks old or a
[1:07:28] couple months old and you know we're
[1:07:30] we're feel like it's healthy enough to
[1:07:32] where we're not afraid to bring it
[1:07:33] around people. And and what do we do? We
[1:07:35] come in on a Sunday morning and that
[1:07:38] baby is dressed up in white frills to,
[1:07:40] you know, to the nines and and we've got
[1:07:43] it all dressed up and we bring it up
[1:07:44] here and we say, "Brother Jack, we want
[1:07:46] to have a baby dedication this morning."
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And brother Jack will get up and he'll
[1:07:51] take that baby and he'll begin to pray a
[1:07:53] prayer, something along these lines.
[1:07:55] Lord, we bring this child to give it
[1:07:58] back
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; to the one who gave it.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And I pray that you'll be with this
[1:08:03] family. I pray that you'll be in their
[1:08:04] home. That you'll place a hedge of
[1:08:07] protection around this child. That
[1:08:09] you'll be the unseen guest in the home.
[1:08:12] And that you'll be with this child. That
[1:08:14] you'll give the parents wisdom on how to
[1:08:17] train him. And that you will you will go
[1:08:20] before this child. and that you will not
[1:08:22] only be a blessing to this child, but
[1:08:24] use this child to be a blessing to
[1:08:26] others.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; And then we say, "Amen." We hand the
[1:08:30] baby back to the parents and they say,
[1:08:31] "Thank God because this child has been
[1:08:34] dedicated back to the one who gave it."
[1:08:36] And we just have this peace about it
[1:08:38] that my well, you know, we we as
[1:08:40] parents, God has given us this child and
[1:08:42] and we're going to try to raise it to
[1:08:44] the best of our ability. the child has
[1:08:46] been dedicated to the Lord and it just
[1:08:48] takes a little bit of pressure off off
[1:08:50] of us as parents but you know then that
[1:08:52] child becomes to be a teenager
[1:08:56] and when it you know when that child was
[1:08:58] an infant and couldn't feed itself and
[1:09:01] couldn't dress itself and we were the
[1:09:03] one that was kind of in control we
[1:09:05] didn't worry that child's been dedicated
[1:09:07] to the Lord everything's okay and then
[1:09:09] when it be to be a toddler and we had to
[1:09:11] kind of help it along and teach it how
[1:09:13] to walk and teach it how to put its arm
[1:09:15] arm in the sleeve of its coat and put
[1:09:17] its little shoes on and tie its shoes
[1:09:19] and feed itself and walk without
[1:09:22] tripping all over itself. And we begin
[1:09:25] to do that and we still had some
[1:09:27] involvement. And then the child got to
[1:09:29] be, you know, a pre-teenager and we were
[1:09:31] still involved. They'd come and ask us
[1:09:33] questions about their math or their
[1:09:36] English. And and sometimes you'd have to
[1:09:38] ask Sister Google to help you help them
[1:09:41] with their math or their English. and
[1:09:43] and you know and so they were still a
[1:09:45] little dependent on you and then all of
[1:09:46] a sudden they get a driver's license
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and a job
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; and sudden somehow mysteriously
[1:09:53] overnight they know more than you do
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham got to this spot
[1:10:02] with sister Rebecca questions and
[1:10:04] answers 1964 and we're going to kind of
[1:10:06] just skip down through it and read a few
[1:10:08] different portions of it. He says, "I
[1:10:10] took took Ma about an hour and I said,
[1:10:13] "Ma, take your hands off."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Now, here he is, a prophet of God. His
[1:10:19] wife knows he's a prophet of God. She
[1:10:21] even prayed when she wanted to marry
[1:10:23] him, and he was just kind of unsure
[1:10:25] about about it. He said, "Lord, you
[1:10:27] know, I'm gone so much and what would
[1:10:29] her life be like?" And he wasn't sure if
[1:10:31] he was going to marry or not. And and so
[1:10:34] she went and she began to open her
[1:10:36] Bible. She said, "Lord, I've never used
[1:10:38] the Bible as a Ouija board, but could
[1:10:40] you just give me some reassurance if
[1:10:42] he's going to be my husband? Can you
[1:10:44] show me something in the scripture that
[1:10:46] would encourage me?" And she opened up
[1:10:48] her Bible, and it fell to, "Behold, I
[1:10:51] send you Elijah the prophet."
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty specific
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; for a sister wanting to marry Brother
[1:10:59] Brandon.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It don't get much more specific than
[1:11:02] that. And so they go and they're married
[1:11:06] and you know they're raising these
[1:11:07] children together and now sister Rebecca
[1:11:10] gets into her teenage years and she's
[1:11:12] taking piano lessons and they go down
[1:11:14] one day and she's playing piano with one
[1:11:16] of her friends down the street and they
[1:11:18] walk in and they are just shocked by
[1:11:20] what she's playing. Now by today's
[1:11:22] standards it would probably have been
[1:11:23] extremely mild but they were shocked by
[1:11:26] what she was playing on the piano. And
[1:11:28] so it just it breaks their heart and
[1:11:30] they they go and they they try to talk
[1:11:32] to her about it and she said, "Well, you
[1:11:34] just want me to be a wallflower and all
[1:11:36] these things and and and so sister me is
[1:11:38] upset." And and brother Brandham takes
[1:11:40] an hour. He doesn't just say, "Woman,
[1:11:44] just just shut up and stop acting
[1:11:46] emotional." He takes an hour talking to
[1:11:49] her, working through this with her.
[1:11:51] Honey, she's in this teenage life, this
[1:11:53] teenage stage. Don't you remember when
[1:11:55] you were a teenager? Don't you remember
[1:11:57] how you were with your mother? Uh oh.
[1:11:59] And and so
[1:12:02] so [clears throat] it took me to about
[1:12:03] an hour. I said, "Mita, take your hands
[1:12:06] off."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Me, that's my kid.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. When it gets quiet like this, I
[1:12:14] know I'm right where I need to be.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; When people are shouting and running the
[1:12:18] aisles, that means they're I'm getting
[1:12:20] somebody else and they're happy about
[1:12:21] it.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; But when everybody gets quiet, that
[1:12:24] means I'm getting them.
[1:12:30] me. That's my kid. I said, "Isn't it
[1:12:32] mine, too?" All right. I said, "If she
[1:12:35] was dying this morning, you'd have to
[1:12:37] commit her to God
[1:12:40] for her eternal destination.
[1:12:42] Why can't we commit her to God now for
[1:12:47] her earthly journey?"
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Now, again, as an infant child, no big
[1:12:51] deal. We come up when you don't you
[1:12:54] don't see parents coming up and I
[1:12:56] [laughter] gotta dedicate this baby.
[1:12:58] It's so hard, Brother Nathan. No, they
[1:13:01] got a smile on their face.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Look at the dress we got her.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Look at the little bow. She hardly has
[1:13:07] enough hair to keep it in. But isn't she
[1:13:09] cute?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; They're smiling. They're happy. You see
[1:13:13] somebody, their child laying there in
[1:13:15] the hospital and they don't know what
[1:13:17] direction they're going to go. my
[1:13:19] they're they're seeking God and they're
[1:13:21] saying, "God, Lord, whatever the
[1:13:22] outcome, we we want to see this child
[1:13:25] spend eternity with us. Lord, we want to
[1:13:27] make sure everything's right with them,
[1:13:29] whether they're physically healed or
[1:13:30] not. We just want to make sure that
[1:13:32] their soul is right and they commit that
[1:13:35] child to God. It's so easy to commit
[1:13:37] somebody to God when they're on their
[1:13:38] deathbed.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; But what about when they're just driving
[1:13:42] down the highway with their friends?"
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Job had to do it. He said, "Well,
[1:13:48] pre-adventure, they do something. I'm
[1:13:50] going to go down here and make a
[1:13:51] sacrifice."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; If she was dying this morning, you'd
[1:13:56] have to commit her to God for her
[1:13:57] eternal destination. Why can't we commit
[1:14:00] her to God now for her earthly journey?
[1:14:03] Now, he goes down a little further. He
[1:14:04] said, I said, "Wait a minute. We've
[1:14:06] raised her all we can. Now, put her in
[1:14:08] the hands of God. Commit her. And I
[1:14:10] said, "When she does anything, say,
[1:14:12] Becky, darling, mother don't want you to
[1:14:15] do that, but I'm your pal.
[1:14:18] I'll stick by you." See, let her know
[1:14:22] that you love her.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say, "Now, Becky, honey,
[1:14:28] you just do whatever you want.
[1:14:30] Jesus loves you and you can do, you
[1:14:33] know, you're the daughter of a prophet
[1:14:34] and everything's going to be okay. You
[1:14:36] just do whatever you want." No, that's
[1:14:37] not what he's telling her to say.
[1:14:39] He said, "You tell her, you know, we
[1:14:41] don't agree, honey, but I'm still your
[1:14:43] pal. You know, I don't want you to do
[1:14:44] that. You know, that's unpleasing to the
[1:14:46] Lord, but I'm still your buddy. I'm
[1:14:48] going to stick with you because I love
[1:14:49] you."
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; He says a little further. So, we got we
[1:14:54] there got down on our knees and
[1:14:56] committed it to God.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Committed to God. Now he says in this in
[1:15:02] this line of quotes here he tells sister
[1:15:05] me he said now honey he said you've got
[1:15:08] to think teenage thoughts.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You've got to think like a teenager
[1:15:14] thinks. My goodness.
[1:15:17] And you know a lot of us I look back at
[1:15:19] me when I was a teenager. I was telling
[1:15:21] somebody the other day I said my
[1:15:22] goodness uh my kids haven't done a lot
[1:15:25] of the things I did when I was a
[1:15:26] teenager.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; So I'm blessed.
[1:15:29] Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And so I I I look at this and he says,
[1:15:33] "Think teenage thoughts." He said, "You
[1:15:35] be," he said, "he needs somebody to show
[1:15:37] her love." And he said, "You be that one
[1:15:40] to show her love or she'll find somebody
[1:15:42] else
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; to show her love."
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I see it's, you know, I I don't know if
[1:15:48] you see it here in Florida or not, but
[1:15:49] seems like there's a pattern back home
[1:15:51] where some of the so-called message
[1:15:53] believers, my their teenager starts to
[1:15:56] do anything and they just kick them out
[1:15:58] the door. And that's just, you know,
[1:15:59] well, you're not going to do that in my
[1:16:00] home. Bless God. Well, there's things
[1:16:02] that I I couldn't allow as a pastor in
[1:16:04] my home either, but I I believe I would
[1:16:07] be as long-suffering as I could.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You know, even to husband and wife, the
[1:16:13] Bible said that the believing wife
[1:16:15] sanctifies the unbelieving husband.
[1:16:18] Didn't say just kick him out the door
[1:16:20] the first time he makes a mistake, but
[1:16:22] the believing wife sanctifies the
[1:16:25] unbelieving husband and vice versa. And
[1:16:28] and so there's something about it. I I
[1:16:30] see the attitude of some people towards
[1:16:33] their children or towards their friends
[1:16:35] or towards just random people in the
[1:16:37] message. Their attitude when anybody
[1:16:39] makes a mistake is so negative and so
[1:16:41] critical and so in the seat of the
[1:16:44] scornful and taking on the robe of the
[1:16:46] judge
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; that I think how are you ever going to
[1:16:50] win that person back?
[1:16:53] The only way we'll win them back is by
[1:16:55] the love of Jesus Christ
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; being expressed through us.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Not to condone their sins, not say, "Oh,
[1:17:04] honey, that's okay." No, it's okay to
[1:17:06] say, you know, we don't, you know, we
[1:17:08] don't believe that. You know, we don't
[1:17:09] live like that in this home, but I still
[1:17:11] love you,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and no matter what you do, I'll love
[1:17:14] you,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; and I'll be standing here like the
[1:17:16] prodical son's father with my arms open
[1:17:19] welcoming you back. There was a person
[1:17:21] my a while back that they they thought
[1:17:24] they were going to do some great things
[1:17:26] for their family and wound up leading
[1:17:28] him into the world instead of leading
[1:17:30] him closer to the Lord like they thought
[1:17:32] they were going to do.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And I told them I said they said, "Oh,
[1:17:35] our our family is is is better off now
[1:17:38] than they've ever been." I said, "Well,
[1:17:40] I don't agree with you on that."
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; But I said, "What I will say is you'll
[1:17:44] never hear me say I told you so."
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] Your children don't need to hear you
[1:17:50] say, "I told you so."
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; See how wrong you were.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; How would you have received that as a
[1:17:56] teenager?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; I want to say too, church members don't
[1:18:01] need to hear us pastors say, "I told you
[1:18:03] so.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; I told you when you went down that
[1:18:06] path." No, they need to say, "Well, you
[1:18:07] know, well, we we did counsel you, but
[1:18:09] you know what? You're welcome back.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; We love you.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; We don't agree with sin, but the door is
[1:18:15] open." Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers. 1964.
[1:18:20] Brother Brandham, I believe the message
[1:18:22] you teach with all my heart. It thrills
[1:18:24] my soul. However, my wife and son do not
[1:18:27] rejoice in the word. They do not desire
[1:18:29] to separate themselves from some of
[1:18:31] their worldly habits. You said that we
[1:18:34] should claim our families. I find that
[1:18:37] difficult to do. Don't you appreciate
[1:18:40] their honesty?
[1:18:42] I find that difficult to do. Anybody
[1:18:45] ever find that difficult to do?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're just going to claim our
[1:18:48] family. Oh, you know, our our loved ones
[1:18:51] is backsliden or turned away or whatever
[1:18:53] it be. I'm going to claim them.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; He said, I find that difficult to do.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Seeming that they do not live for the
[1:19:01] word or in the word. What is my course,
[1:19:04] sir? Do I claim them and believe or do I
[1:19:08] pray, "Father, thy will be done," and be
[1:19:11] content in the state I find myself in. I
[1:19:13] would appreciate your guidance, brother
[1:19:16] Brandham.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you, my brother or sister,
[1:19:19] whoever you may be. I would just commit
[1:19:22] them
[1:19:24] to the Lord.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; See, because what all the father has
[1:19:27] given me will come to me
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; again. Questions and answers, part two,
[1:19:32] 1964. Dear brother Brandham, my wife and
[1:19:35] I were separated. She's suing me for a
[1:19:38] divorce. She's not a Christian and I
[1:19:41] believe the message and want her to be
[1:19:43] saved. Brother Ram stops reading the
[1:19:44] question. He says, 'Isn't that nice?
[1:19:46] That's a real Christian spirit. See,
[1:19:50] she's wanting to divorce him and he
[1:19:51] wants to see her saved. He says, "And
[1:19:53] believe. What must I do?" We also have
[1:19:56] two boys. Now, Brother Bam goes down a
[1:19:58] paragraph or two and he says, "If you
[1:20:00] worry, it'll break your health down."
[1:20:04] And that's what Satan wants to do.
[1:20:10] And the church said,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; "If you worry, it'll break your health."
[1:20:15] Oh, but brother Nathan, you just don't
[1:20:16] understand. You don't know how far my
[1:20:18] spouse has gone, or you don't know how
[1:20:20] far my child has gone, or you don't know
[1:20:22] how far my parents or my siblings or my
[1:20:24] aunt or my uncle has gone. Well, if you
[1:20:26] worry, it'll break your health down. And
[1:20:29] that's what Satan wants to do. He's
[1:20:31] working. I know at you. So you just
[1:20:34] commit the whole thing to God and go
[1:20:37] right on serving God. Just as happy as
[1:20:39] you can be, God will take care of the
[1:20:42] rest of it.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; All that the father has given me will
[1:20:46] come to me.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Get down on your knees. I'll pray with
[1:20:50] you or anything. I'll pray over the
[1:20:52] matter. Just say, "Lord God, I love her.
[1:20:55] She's the mother of my children." If she
[1:20:57] is, and say, "I just commit the whole
[1:20:59] thing to you. Lord, I want them to be
[1:21:02] saved. You know I do, but I can't go no
[1:21:04] further. She's going to divorce me
[1:21:06] anyhow. I haven't done nothing. If I
[1:21:08] have, reveal it to me. I'll go make it
[1:21:10] right.
[1:21:12] I will do anything. Then commit it to
[1:21:15] the Lord and just let it alone.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Then just let it alone. Go right on
[1:21:22] living just the same as nothing ever
[1:21:24] happened and God
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; will take care of the rest of it.
[1:21:32] God will take care of the rest of it.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a formula that he keeps
[1:21:38] repeating to people with family
[1:21:40] problems.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, my child. Brother
[1:21:42] Brandham, my wife. Brother Brandham, my
[1:21:45] wife and son. And he keeps telling them,
[1:21:47] just commit it to the Lord. He talks
[1:21:49] about sister Rebecca when we went
[1:21:51] through this with our teenage daughter.
[1:21:52] We committed her to the Lord. If she was
[1:21:55] dying, you'd have to commit her to the
[1:21:56] Lord. As an infant, we committed her to
[1:21:58] the Lord. Why can't we commit them to
[1:22:01] the Lord for their earthly journey
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; at thy word 1954? That's the most
[1:22:08] powerful weapon that God put in the
[1:22:10] hands of a man is a committal and a
[1:22:14] confession. It'll do it every time if
[1:22:17] you believe it and accept it on those
[1:22:19] basis and believe it and stay with it.
[1:22:22] Keep confessing it.
[1:22:26] The most powerful weapon is committ.
[1:22:34] Committ confession. Now, I find one of
[1:22:37] the hardest things for message believers
[1:22:40] to do, it seems, is to keep a positive
[1:22:42] confession.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; To keep a positive testimony. And we get
[1:22:49] prayed for and somebody asks us the next
[1:22:51] day, "How are you feeling?" "Oh, I don't
[1:22:52] feel any better." Well, uh, you're not
[1:22:54] going to if you keep that negative
[1:22:56] testimony.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he was going down the
[1:22:58] road there and he had prayed and asked
[1:23:00] God to help him with the stomach ulcers
[1:23:01] and things. And he said he tried to eat
[1:23:04] that food and it kept trying to come up.
[1:23:05] He said we had a bouncing party there
[1:23:07] for a little while. Had his hand over
[1:23:09] his mouth and it kept trying to come up
[1:23:10] and he kept trying to swallow it back
[1:23:12] down. It's kind of graphic, but that's
[1:23:14] what the prophet said.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And he said he was walking down the road
[1:23:17] and he was sweaty and clammy and his
[1:23:20] stomach bothering him. Somebody said,
[1:23:21] "How you feeling, Brother Brandham?" He
[1:23:23] said, "I feel wonderful.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; I'm healed."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "SOMEBODY SAID, "YOU LIED,
[1:23:28] Brother Brandham." He said, "No, you're
[1:23:29] looking at the symptoms. I was looking
[1:23:31] at the promise."
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; So, it depends on what you're looking at
[1:23:39] this morning.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Now, you can have a negative testimony.
[1:23:42] I don't feel saved. I I don't know if I
[1:23:44] got the Holy Ghost. I don't know if I
[1:23:45] got healed Friday night. I don't know. I
[1:23:47] don't know. And all the negativity.
[1:23:49] Well, I just I don't feel like I'm a
[1:23:51] very strong Christian, and I I I just
[1:23:54] can't seem like I can overcome, and I
[1:23:56] just seem like I struggle all the time,
[1:23:58] and it seems like I can't ever get ahead
[1:23:59] at work, and I can't ever do this, and I
[1:24:01] can't ever do anything, right? You
[1:24:03] realize that our our subconscious on the
[1:24:07] inside of us, there's brother Bam talks
[1:24:10] about those three gates. Uh there's
[1:24:12] there there's a gate in or the five
[1:24:14] gates to the flesh and the five gates to
[1:24:16] the spirit. But there's only one gate
[1:24:18] into the soul and that's self-will. And
[1:24:20] we choose that by either faith or doubt.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And he he talks about in the greatest
[1:24:25] battle ever fought how there's a gate
[1:24:26] that opens and shuts that in your soul
[1:24:29] which is down in on the inside of your
[1:24:31] subconscious there there's a there's a
[1:24:34] gate that opens and shuts whether to
[1:24:36] believe something or whether to not
[1:24:37] believe it. And when you're just walking
[1:24:39] around self-deprecating all the time,
[1:24:42] I'm just a failure. I'm not a good
[1:24:43] mother. I'm not a good father. I'm not a
[1:24:46] good this. And and you're telling your
[1:24:47] subconscious that, your subconscious
[1:24:49] believes it.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And that actually begins to shape your
[1:24:53] nature.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; But if you walk around, you begin to
[1:24:56] testify all the good things the
[1:24:57] scripture said about you. I'm
[1:24:59] victorious.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I'm more than a conqueror through Christ
[1:25:02] Jesus.
[1:25:04] I'm an overcomer. I'm saved. I'm filled
[1:25:07] with the Holy Ghost. I'm healed by his
[1:25:10] stripes. My children are my inheritance.
[1:25:13] He promised to provide. He said, "Seek
[1:25:16] ye first the kingdom of God and all
[1:25:18] these things will be added." He said,
[1:25:20] "All things are working together for my
[1:25:22] good."
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Then you believe that, too.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And and the difference in the other
[1:25:29] things is the Bible actually says those
[1:25:32] things, but it's the devil telling you
[1:25:34] those other things. So who are you going
[1:25:36] to believe?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; The devil, the lie of the devil or the
[1:25:40] truth of God.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; And so we want to keep a positive
[1:25:43] testimony over us. Now there there was a
[1:25:46] man who who wrote a book called the
[1:25:48] power of positive thinking and he had a
[1:25:51] big mega church in New York and brother
[1:25:52] Bham actually went there, Norman Vincent
[1:25:54] Peele, and visited his church and and
[1:25:56] brother Bannam was very impressed with
[1:25:57] the way they had church order and things
[1:25:59] like that. But Norman Vincent Peele, I
[1:26:01] don't know if you've ever read the book,
[1:26:02] but I wouldn't really waste my time if
[1:26:04] if you h haven't. But, uh, the power of
[1:26:06] positive thinking, what he does is he
[1:26:08] actually takes some of the principles
[1:26:09] that Brother Brandham teaches us and he
[1:26:11] puts a little psychological twist to it.
[1:26:14] And what he's teaching is psychology
[1:26:16] that if you just say anything, then then
[1:26:19] you will eventually walk into that
[1:26:21] because you kind of name it and claim it
[1:26:23] is what we would call it. And and we you
[1:26:25] as message believers, you know, we don't
[1:26:27] believe name it and claim it. But we do
[1:26:30] believe if it's a scriptural promise,
[1:26:32] then we can name it and claim it.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; But we're not out here saying, "Oh, I'm
[1:26:37] going to name and claim a Ferrari or a
[1:26:39] 500,000 square foot house or whatever it
[1:26:42] be." No, we're not naming and claiming
[1:26:43] things that the scripture didn't
[1:26:45] promise. But if we have a need and
[1:26:47] there's a scriptural promise, then we
[1:26:49] can name that and claim that.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there's a difference. So,
[1:26:54] brother Brandham is teaching us the
[1:26:55] power of positive confession. And he's
[1:26:58] telling us if we'll just he said the
[1:27:00] word will defeat the devil any place,
[1:27:02] any time, any conditions. And so, he's
[1:27:05] telling us the power of positive confess
[1:27:08] confession by confessing the scriptures
[1:27:10] over our life. Norman Vincent Peele is
[1:27:12] saying, "Oh, whatever you say, just the
[1:27:14] power of a positive thought. If you
[1:27:16] think it, you can manifest it." Well,
[1:27:18] that's not really the what the scripture
[1:27:20] is saying. But if God thought it,
[1:27:23] then you can manifest it
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; because the devil might make you think
[1:27:28] anything and it might not be the will of
[1:27:29] God.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So it's not the power of positive
[1:27:32] thinking. It's the power of positive
[1:27:33] confession of the wordise.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Committ
[1:27:38] Proverbs 16:3 says, "Commit thy works
[1:27:41] unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be
[1:27:44] established."
[1:27:45] Second Timothy 1:7 says, "For God hath
[1:27:48] not given us the spirit of fear, but of
[1:27:51] power and of love and of a sound mind."
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; There's a brother from our church came
[1:27:57] up a while back just a he's just a lay
[1:27:59] member. He's not a deacon or a Sunday
[1:28:01] school teacher or anything, a minister.
[1:28:03] He's just a just a brother. And he got
[1:28:05] up to pray and he said, "God, I want to
[1:28:08] thank you for giving me a sound mind in
[1:28:11] an insane world." And I'll be honest, I
[1:28:15] didn't have my head bowed and my eyes
[1:28:16] closed. I was taking notes because I
[1:28:18] thought that's going to preach, Brother
[1:28:19] Jack.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And I preached it at a youth camp in
[1:28:22] Vancouver. A sound mind in an insane
[1:28:25] world.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; God didn't give us the spirit of fear. I
[1:28:29] see people come through prayer lines and
[1:28:31] and and they're dealing with fear and
[1:28:33] with anxiety and with depression and
[1:28:35] with suicidal thoughts and all those
[1:28:36] things. And that those things are real.
[1:28:38] Those people are really going through
[1:28:39] that and the devil is bombarding them.
[1:28:41] But that is not God's will for your
[1:28:43] life.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; God does not want you. I see some
[1:28:46] people, they go to the doctor or they go
[1:28:48] to the psychiatrist or the psychologist
[1:28:50] or the counselor at school and and they
[1:28:52] get labeled with something and they
[1:28:54] begin to identify with that label.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm schizophrenic or I'm diabetic
[1:29:00] or I I I've got cancer. Or they begin to
[1:29:03] say, "Well, my cancer." No, it ain't
[1:29:05] your cancer.
[1:29:07] It's the devil's cancer.
[1:29:10] Don't call it your cancer.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; No, I No, I'm not a diabetic. I'm
[1:29:18] healed.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; The doctor diagnosed me with this, but
[1:29:23] but that's not my identity.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's okay. If I've got symptoms,
[1:29:29] I'm going to use wisdom and I'm going to
[1:29:31] try to to help the symptoms until I walk
[1:29:34] into my promise. I'm going to use
[1:29:36] wisdom, but I'm not going to be
[1:29:38] identified with that. I'm not going to
[1:29:41] take on that name. Well, you know, they
[1:29:43] said I'm bipolar or they said I'm, you
[1:29:45] know, this or that or I they said I've
[1:29:47] I've got, you know, extreme depression
[1:29:49] or extreme anxiety and so I guess that's
[1:29:52] just I guess I'll just take this little
[1:29:53] pill the rest of my life. You do not
[1:29:55] have to be identified
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; whether it's mental sickness or physical
[1:30:00] sickness or spiritual sickness. Oh, I'm
[1:30:03] just an old drunk. No, you're not. The
[1:30:05] devil's tried to make you one,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; but don't be identified with that.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Some people almost wear that like a
[1:30:14] badge of honor. Oh, I'm this, you know,
[1:30:16] they they diagnosed me as as this, and
[1:30:18] that's just No, don't don't. You don't
[1:30:19] want to be identified with that.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; God hath not given us the spirit of
[1:30:25] fear,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:30:31] mind.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God wants for his
[1:30:34] children.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes even as as
[1:30:37] believers, I've noticed sometimes people
[1:30:41] and we're we're a little off track, but
[1:30:43] we're not completely. I
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I find sometimes people's
[1:30:46] identifications begin to be wound up in
[1:30:49] a title
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; or in a person.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And when you see that, they're bound for
[1:30:55] failure because God will not share his
[1:30:57] glory with anybody.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And sometimes their identification is
[1:31:01] entitled. I'm well I'm a message
[1:31:03] believer. Well, hey, there were two
[1:31:04] million message believers in the days of
[1:31:06] Moses and most of them didn't turn out
[1:31:08] very good. So, it's not just enough,
[1:31:11] brother Bam said, it's not just enough
[1:31:12] to believe it. It's not just enough to
[1:31:15] be associated around it, but you have to
[1:31:18] actually become the word. You have to
[1:31:20] let it live through you. Amen. Oh, oh, I
[1:31:23] believe. He said, that's great. The
[1:31:24] devils believe and tremble.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Some people they're identifying, oh, I'm
[1:31:27] a deacon. I'm a pastor. I'm an
[1:31:30] evangelist. I I'm a Sunday school
[1:31:32] teacher. I'm this. I'm that. Well, what
[1:31:34] if the what if time carries? And you
[1:31:36] know, if the Lord carries long enough,
[1:31:38] there's going to be a spot. I don't know
[1:31:39] if that's 73. I don't know if it's 84. I
[1:31:43] don't know if it's 62. I don't know what
[1:31:45] that age number is, but there's going to
[1:31:48] come a time where brother Jack and I are
[1:31:50] just going to realize, hey, we're just
[1:31:52] not able to really do the duties of a
[1:31:53] pastor justice like we should. And it's
[1:31:56] time to step into retirement. And maybe
[1:31:58] we'll still take some preaching
[1:32:00] engagements here and there as the Lord
[1:32:01] leads. But to take on the duties of a
[1:32:03] pastor is going to be hard. Well, if our
[1:32:05] identification is just wrapped up in I
[1:32:07] am a pastor,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; you're headed for depression.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; You're headed for walking around. I have
[1:32:14] no purpose in life cuz I'm not a pastor
[1:32:17] anymore. If your identification is
[1:32:20] wrapped up in being a deacon and then
[1:32:22] for some reason you're not eligible
[1:32:23] anymore or because of health issues you
[1:32:26] have to step away for a couple years and
[1:32:28] that was your whole identity then you're
[1:32:30] going to be walking around I just have
[1:32:31] no purpose cuz I'm not a deacon anymore.
[1:32:33] I'm not a Sunday school teacher anymore.
[1:32:35] or even as parents sometimes you see a
[1:32:37] mother who in that empty nest those
[1:32:39] children leave and her whole purpose for
[1:32:42] 18 or 24 or 30 years has been raising
[1:32:45] these children and being a mother and
[1:32:47] now she looks around what have I what
[1:32:49] have I got to do
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; you're helping somebody brother Nathan
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; because her whole identification was a
[1:33:00] mother
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; and none of these things are bad things
[1:33:03] hey being a pastor is a wonderful thing.
[1:33:05] Being a deacon is a wonderful thing.
[1:33:07] Being a mother. Brother Brandham called
[1:33:08] you the fifth gospel.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; But if your whole identification is tied
[1:33:12] up in that or sometimes it's our spouse.
[1:33:14] Oh, if my husband died, I don't know how
[1:33:16] I can go on. Well, I wouldn't say that
[1:33:18] because God might smite him dead.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Just to prove that, you know, it's not
[1:33:23] just him. He's not your savior.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; That Jesus is the one that our
[1:33:28] identification should be wrapped up in.
[1:33:31] that whether I'm a pastor or an
[1:33:33] evangelist or whether I'm sitting on the
[1:33:35] sidelines cheering somebody else on,
[1:33:37] whether I'm a deacon, whether I'm a
[1:33:39] janitor, whether I'm a lay member,
[1:33:41] whether I'm a Sunday school teacher,
[1:33:43] whether I'm a husband or whether I'm a
[1:33:45] father or whatever it be, whether the
[1:33:47] sisters, whether it's you're a mother or
[1:33:49] a wife or whatever, if your whole
[1:33:51] identification is wrapped up in that,
[1:33:53] OH, I'M A WIFE and I've tried to be the
[1:33:55] best wife that I can, and then your
[1:33:57] husband of of 40 years goes the way of
[1:33:59] the grave. If your whole identification
[1:34:01] was just I'm a wife,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; you're going to have a hard time.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; So, our identification should be wrapped
[1:34:10] up in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; He is my all.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; He is my everything.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And when I'm in this season of
[1:34:19] motherhood, I want to be the best
[1:34:21] Christian mother that I can. When I'm in
[1:34:24] this season of being a wife to my
[1:34:26] husband, I want to be the best wife that
[1:34:28] I can. When I'm in this season of
[1:34:29] pastor, I don't want to take that
[1:34:31] lightly. I want to be the best pastor
[1:34:33] that I know how to be, the best deacon,
[1:34:35] the best evangelist that I know how to
[1:34:37] be. But when all that is said and done,
[1:34:39] and I can't do that anymore because my
[1:34:41] mind begins to slip or my body begins to
[1:34:44] fail or or the church falls apart or
[1:34:46] whatever it be, then my identification
[1:34:48] cannot just be in a title or a person
[1:34:51] except the person Christ Jesus.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers, part one, 1964.
[1:35:07] Remember the Philippian jailer.
[1:35:10] Believe for both of you. If you've got
[1:35:12] enough faith for your own salvation,
[1:35:14] can't you have the same faith that'll
[1:35:15] work for your people? One of the meanest
[1:35:18] men in town, 1961, say, when a man gets
[1:35:20] saved, does that save his house? No. But
[1:35:23] if he's got enough faith to get saved
[1:35:25] himself, he's got enough faith that his
[1:35:27] house house will be saved also.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; The same faith that saved him,
[1:35:33] that's what that mother thought in the
[1:35:35] grave long ago. But her prayers just was
[1:35:39] answered.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers, part three, 1964.
[1:35:43] What must I do for my family? Use the
[1:35:46] same faith that you're using for
[1:35:48] yourself, for your family.
[1:35:51] Commit them to the Lord and believe with
[1:35:54] all your heart that you're going to be
[1:35:56] saved.
[1:35:59] Oh my.
[1:36:02] Let me read you this one. Resurrection
[1:36:03] of Jeras's daughter, 1954. I found out
[1:36:06] this in my 21 years of experience of
[1:36:09] preaching the gospel. Any job that's too
[1:36:13] big for me, excuse me, any job that's
[1:36:16] too big for my Lord to attack, what's
[1:36:19] the use of me trying it?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I just let him have it. So, see, just
[1:36:24] commit it to him. He promised to take
[1:36:27] care of me.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; When opposition comes, I just commit it
[1:36:31] to him. You see, many times if we're not
[1:36:33] careful, and this is the parents, this
[1:36:36] is the preachers, this is to lay
[1:36:38] members. Every one of us have been
[1:36:40] guilty of things like this. We we we're
[1:36:42] up against something and we're trying to
[1:36:44] find the will of God and we've prayed
[1:36:46] and we've sought and we've begged and we
[1:36:48] pleaded with him and we do like brother
[1:36:50] Brandham taught about trying to find his
[1:36:51] perfect will. We try to stay neutral and
[1:36:53] we we try to do our best and and and we
[1:36:56] finally just say, "Lord, I I've done all
[1:36:58] that I know how to do. Now, I'm just
[1:36:59] going to lay this before you. I'm going
[1:37:01] to commit it to you. I Lord, I've
[1:37:03] interviewed the best that I know how.
[1:37:05] I've put in job applications the best
[1:37:06] that I know how. Now, I' I've got these
[1:37:09] multiple job offers out here and I don't
[1:37:11] want to just run after the the biggest
[1:37:13] dollar amount, but Lord, is that going
[1:37:15] to take me away from church or is that
[1:37:17] going to take me away from my family
[1:37:18] more than I need to be? Or Lord, what is
[1:37:20] your will for the perfect thing for my
[1:37:22] life? Lord, I'm going to commit this to
[1:37:24] you and see how you lead. or I'm going
[1:37:26] to commit this backsliden child or or or
[1:37:29] this backsliden spouse or or this family
[1:37:32] financial situation or this medical
[1:37:35] need. Lord, I commit it to you and then
[1:37:37] the next day you're out there with your
[1:37:39] hands in it meddling again.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; As pastors, it's very easy for us if
[1:37:46] we're not careful. Sometimes a situation
[1:37:49] will come up in the church and somebody
[1:37:50] say, "Brother Jack, you need to take
[1:37:52] care of that. You need to deal with
[1:37:53] that." And if we're not careful, we put
[1:37:55] our hands to something. Brother Nathan,
[1:37:57] oh, you better you know about this
[1:37:59] situation. You better you better deal
[1:38:01] with that. Don't you think you should
[1:38:02] preach something about that? Yes, when
[1:38:04] the Lord leads me to.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Not when Sister Suzy or
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; whoever leads me to.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll preach on it when the Lord
[1:38:17] lays it on my heart. We'll deal with it.
[1:38:19] But I found pastoring I guess 14 years
[1:38:22] now. Not as long as brother Jack, but 14
[1:38:24] years is a long time in any job, let
[1:38:26] alone being a pastor.
[1:38:28] And I found pastoring 14 years. There's
[1:38:31] many times I I would say 90% of the
[1:38:34] time, if we'll just give God a little
[1:38:36] bit of time, then God's just going to
[1:38:38] work that out.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And sometimes if we put our hand to it
[1:38:42] too quickly, we'll make a mess of it.
[1:38:44] And then there's another 10% of the time
[1:38:46] where we wait on the Lord and he says,
[1:38:47] "Oh no, I'm waiting on you on that one.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to do that one.
[1:38:51] You're going to have to sit in that
[1:38:53] tough meeting and you're going to have
[1:38:54] to go to that tough coffee and you're
[1:38:56] going to have to tell that person what I
[1:38:57] laid on your heart." We think, "Oh Lord,
[1:38:59] couldn't it be somebody else?"
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Having the We talked about that
[1:39:09] simplicity of being able to follow the
[1:39:11] Holy Spirit, the leading of the Holy
[1:39:13] Spirit.
[1:39:16] My
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Let me skip a couple of these and we'll
[1:39:20] we'll try to wind this up. Believest
[1:39:22] thou this. 1950.
[1:39:24] Now, what does the farmer do?
[1:39:27] He sews the wheat. Well, look for the
[1:39:30] harvest. The next morning, what if he
[1:39:33] goes out there and uncovers it? Says,
[1:39:34] "Why, it ain't sprouted. There's nothing
[1:39:36] to it. So, I I ain't got going to have
[1:39:38] no wheat." Well, if he isn't going to
[1:39:40] have any wheat, if he keeps he if he
[1:39:42] isn't going to have any wheat, if he
[1:39:44] keeps digging it up, looking at it, he
[1:39:46] will never have wheat.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; You just sew it and let it alone.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Show us the father and suffice of this.
[1:39:53] 1950. Every time you dig it up, you
[1:39:56] delay it that much more.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; It'll never grow if you keep digging it
[1:40:00] up. Time of decision. 1959. Every time
[1:40:03] you dig it up, it delays it another day.
[1:40:06] And every time you look at your
[1:40:08] symptoms, it delays you too in your
[1:40:11] healing.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; But I don't feel any better. But I don't
[1:40:16] see any change. But what did the word
[1:40:18] say?
[1:40:20] By his stripes, I'm healed.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. 1957. You hinder it every
[1:40:27] time you dig it up. You place it in the
[1:40:30] ground, commit it to the ground, forget
[1:40:32] about it. It's up to God to do the rest.
[1:40:35] Now, I know I know there are
[1:40:38] circumstances that we go through where
[1:40:41] it's it's hard sometimes for us. We read
[1:40:43] scriptures and oh, it's a good scripture
[1:40:45] and we can put it on our refrigerator or
[1:40:47] our mirror, but then sometimes putting
[1:40:49] that into action, we have a hard time.
[1:40:52] And you know, one of those scriptures,
[1:40:55] it's hard when you're going through a
[1:40:56] trial sometime to really understand.
[1:40:59] Romans 8:28 was my mom's favorite
[1:41:01] scripture. All things
[1:41:04] work together for good.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Didn't say all things were going to be
[1:41:08] good all the time.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But said all things work together for
[1:41:12] our good.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we we all say, "Well, I want
[1:41:17] to be more like Jesus. I want to be a
[1:41:19] better Christian." You know how we do
[1:41:20] that? By building character. You know
[1:41:23] how character is built? By trials and by
[1:41:26] suffering.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And so, we all want to be more like
[1:41:29] Jesus. But nobody says, "Oh Lord, give
[1:41:31] me more trials. Give me more suffering."
[1:41:33] But brother Bam said in the church age
[1:41:35] book, that's how that character is
[1:41:36] developed through suffering the same way
[1:41:39] that the Lord Jesus developed it. And
[1:41:41] and so we go through those things and
[1:41:43] Peter would say, "Our trials are more
[1:41:45] precious to us than gold." And we read
[1:41:47] that and it's a good scripture, but my
[1:41:50] you know, I don't know about you, when
[1:41:51] when we were going to, you know, uh when
[1:41:54] they were just giving money away, you
[1:41:55] know, we go out to the mailbox and
[1:41:56] there'd be another stimulus check. I I'm
[1:41:58] I'm not much of a dancer really, you
[1:42:00] know. I I didn't dance in the world and
[1:42:02] I don't dance a whole lot in church, but
[1:42:04] my I might have did a few little steps
[1:42:05] on the way back to the house from the
[1:42:07] mailbox
[1:42:10] when we got those checks.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; another stimulus check. Should have had
[1:42:14] more children, brother Jack.
[1:42:18] Some of these people at our church with
[1:42:20] six kids and things, my they were just
[1:42:22] raking in the money.
[1:42:28] And I thought, do I get that happy in
[1:42:31] the middle of a trial?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Do I get that happy when I'm being
[1:42:35] persecuted
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; or when I'm suffering for the gospel's
[1:42:39] sake?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Because Peter said, "Our trials are more
[1:42:43] precious to us than gold."
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; And we look at this scripture, all
[1:42:47] things work together for good. Well,
[1:42:49] there's things we go through and if
[1:42:50] we'll be honest, we're asking, Lord, how
[1:42:52] can this be for my good? You remember
[1:42:54] brother Brandham when Sharon Rose passed
[1:42:56] away he he didn't understand how that
[1:42:58] could be for his good until years later
[1:43:00] he looked back and he understood that
[1:43:02] took him years and years to understand
[1:43:04] how can this be working for my good.
[1:43:06] There's many things we go like through
[1:43:08] like that. My best friend growing up he
[1:43:11] he used to have a statement he didn't
[1:43:12] realize at the time it was just
[1:43:13] confirming scripture but he he used to
[1:43:16] make this statement. He said if anything
[1:43:17] goes wrong it goes wrong in Nathan's
[1:43:19] favor.
[1:43:21] I said, "Well, all things work together
[1:43:22] for good
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; to them that love the Lord."
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; If we could have that kind of attitude,
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; if it goes wrong, it's going wrong in my
[1:43:30] favor.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; I told that to our church.
[1:43:38] I told that to our church and a brother
[1:43:40] at our church said, "I've seen it." He
[1:43:42] said, "Even CO worked in Brother
[1:43:44] Nathan's favor."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of the Lord just blessed us
[1:43:50] during during CO, not I'm not talking
[1:43:51] about the physical sickness and stuff,
[1:43:53] but but during CO there was just some so
[1:43:55] many things. We we had time to do
[1:43:56] different things that we didn't have
[1:43:58] time to do before and and got to looking
[1:44:00] at different things and and we hadn't
[1:44:02] ever refinanced our house in years and
[1:44:04] was able to refinance our house and pay
[1:44:05] off some things and double up on our
[1:44:07] house payment from what we'd been paying
[1:44:09] on those other things and get our house
[1:44:10] paid off early and and and the Lord
[1:44:12] blessed us financially during co the way
[1:44:14] that some things fell with the stimulus
[1:44:16] checks and things being able to use that
[1:44:18] to pay off debt. Hey, sometimes even
[1:44:20] things that look dark and look terrible,
[1:44:22] God can use it to be a blessing. You
[1:44:25] remember when Abraham went down there
[1:44:27] with with Pharaoh and and he told that
[1:44:29] lie and said that's my sister and then
[1:44:31] he turned around did the the same thing
[1:44:33] with another king there and and and you
[1:44:35] know it looked like he was going to get
[1:44:37] in trouble and here he was brother Bam
[1:44:38] called him a lying prophet and but you
[1:44:40] know if you go back and read the message
[1:44:42] brother Brham said you know why God
[1:44:43] allowed all that he allowed that famine
[1:44:45] to come that pushed him into Egypt and
[1:44:47] different things he said God knew that
[1:44:49] Abraham needed a financial blessing
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and when he leaves leaves Aimilec.
[1:44:56] Aimilec said, "Hey, take these cattle
[1:44:58] and take these sheep. Let me let me
[1:45:00] bless you. [laughter]
[1:45:02] Just leave."
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; God knew Abraham needed a financial
[1:45:08] blessing, so he let him go down through
[1:45:09] there and go through all that.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're going through
[1:45:16] something. You think, "Why on earth am I
[1:45:17] going through this?"
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; God's got a blessing
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; with your name on it.
[1:45:26] Amen.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We heard you all sing that
[1:45:30] song. I do that to brother Jack all the
[1:45:31] time. God's got a Cadillac with your
[1:45:34] name on it.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; God's got a new suit with your name on
[1:45:38] it.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; God's got a church building with your
[1:45:42] name on it. [cheering]
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Spirit and truth tabernacle.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:11] My May it be in the spirit of prophecy.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; I will restore 1954. Commit it to God
[1:46:19] and leave it there. Time of decision
[1:46:22] 1959. Just commit it to your heart and
[1:46:25] forget about it. God and his people
[1:46:28] 1950. But you can't he can't do it until
[1:46:31] as long as you're holding it. Say, "Now
[1:46:33] I will see if I'm any better and see if
[1:46:36] this will work." You commit it to him.
[1:46:38] Forget about the rest of it. Go
[1:46:40] testifying of things you don't even see.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; That's what blind John Ryan did. You
[1:46:47] remember?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought you said I was
[1:46:49] healed." Brother said, "I thought you
[1:46:50] said you believed."
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, what can I do?" He said,
[1:46:53] "Go testifying everywhere. Thank God for
[1:46:55] healing me."
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He went around everywhere, even in the
[1:46:58] meeting. Thank God for healing me. Went
[1:47:00] down on the street selling newspapers.
[1:47:02] Extra, extra, READ ALL ABOUT IT. THANK
[1:47:04] GOD FOR HEALING ME.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And his barber was going to make fun of
[1:47:07] him. He said, "I heard you got healed
[1:47:08] down there at that Holy Roller Revival."
[1:47:10] He said, "YES, THANK GOD for healing
[1:47:12] me." And his eyes came open.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And one day, you're going to testify
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; God's did it for me. God's victorious.
[1:47:20] God's brought me through. And brother
[1:47:22] Bam said, God will make your body obey
[1:47:24] your confession.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And one of these days, you're going to
[1:47:28] speak it and it's going to manifest.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Musicians, go ahead and
[1:47:38] come to the instruments. We're trying to
[1:47:40] close.
[1:47:41] Your circumstances
[1:47:43] are temporary,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; but his presence is permanent.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you." Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I I see sometimes in young people in
[1:47:59] prayer lines.
[1:48:02] Um you you you see so much anxiety and
[1:48:06] depression and suicidal thoughts and
[1:48:09] people struggling with that. We actually
[1:48:11] dealt with a situation here a few years
[1:48:14] ago at a youth camp. There was a a
[1:48:16] sister with an actual demonic
[1:48:17] manifestation speaking out of her and
[1:48:19] fighting us and things like that. And we
[1:48:21] were trying to narrow down what it was.
[1:48:22] And we finally narrowed it down. when
[1:48:24] when we started talking to her about
[1:48:26] suicide, that demon really went went
[1:48:29] berserk and we knew that's that's what
[1:48:30] she was dealing with. And then we found
[1:48:32] out her sister who the enemy had tried
[1:48:35] to hide it a little better in her was
[1:48:38] facing the same thing, suicidal thoughts
[1:48:40] because of things that they'd gone
[1:48:41] through in their past. And I tell
[1:48:43] people, you know, that's a permanent
[1:48:46] solution to a temporary problem.
[1:48:49] And it is it's a very it's a very
[1:48:52] selfish thing. We've seen people do that
[1:48:54] and it's very selfish because then their
[1:48:56] family is left. You just pass that pain
[1:48:59] on to them that then they're they're
[1:49:02] they're devastated with what could we
[1:49:04] have done different? What could we have
[1:49:05] said different? How could we have
[1:49:07] handled this different? Could we have
[1:49:08] spotted things earlier? I was in a
[1:49:11] prayer line
[1:49:13] here uh this summer and and a young girl
[1:49:16] came up and was dealing with that. was
[1:49:18] talking with her family afterwards and
[1:49:20] they they said we we could tell she had
[1:49:22] been down for a while kind of
[1:49:24] discouraged but we didn't know that that
[1:49:25] she was battling those type of things
[1:49:29] but you know what many times it's
[1:49:31] because the devil tries to isolate us
[1:49:34] and maybe not even physically isolate us
[1:49:36] but in our mind isolate us away from
[1:49:38] everybody else. Nobody cares. Nobody
[1:49:41] understands.
[1:49:42] Nobody loves me. Those are lies of the
[1:49:46] devil.
[1:49:47] Nobody's ever gone through what I've
[1:49:49] gone through. That's not what the
[1:49:50] scripture said. Said nothing has fallen
[1:49:52] you what's just as common to man. And
[1:49:55] the Lord Jesus went through those things
[1:49:56] too. He faced those same battles. You
[1:49:59] know, a pastor brother was telling me a
[1:50:01] while back about something that is
[1:50:03] astounding to me. Uh I never thought of
[1:50:06] it this way, but he was talking on the
[1:50:07] phone with a man who was battling a
[1:50:09] homosexual spirit.
[1:50:12] And he he was trying to encourage the
[1:50:14] brother. The brother was wanting to be
[1:50:15] delivered and he said, "Brother," he
[1:50:18] said, "you know, I I've never battled
[1:50:20] that that spirit, so it's hard for me to
[1:50:22] relate, but I can pray for you and
[1:50:24] sympathize with you." And and he said,
[1:50:26] "Just as I said that, the Holy Spirit
[1:50:29] spoke to my heart and tell him, say, I
[1:50:31] have.
[1:50:33] I've battled that."
[1:50:35] And he thought, "The Lord Jesus battle
[1:50:38] that type of a thought or that type of a
[1:50:40] spirit." And his mind went back to the
[1:50:42] scripture, he was tempted in all
[1:50:44] manners.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; So everything that you go through,
[1:50:50] he's faced that temptation
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; so that he could be the right type of
[1:50:54] intercessor for you. And he loves you
[1:50:57] and his children love you. And don't
[1:51:00] believe the lie of the devil.
[1:51:04] Your symptoms are temporary,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; but his presence is permanent. Let's bow
[1:51:10] our heads together. Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:51:12] you, Lord, for how you've moved in the
[1:51:14] service today. Lord, I pray that it
[1:51:17] strengthens this group of believers here
[1:51:19] in Florida. Father, I pray that it's a
[1:51:21] help to them. I pray that it's an
[1:51:24] encouragement. Lord, I pray we all go
[1:51:26] from here strengthened, Lord, and a
[1:51:28] little closer to you than when we came
[1:51:30] in.
[1:51:32] Lord, we give this service to you,
[1:51:35] Lord. We thank you for all that you do.
[1:51:37] We thank you for your mercy and your
[1:51:39] grace. Lord, I pray if there's any here
[1:51:42] today that were battling any of the
[1:51:44] things that we we looked at this
[1:51:45] morning, how that maybe they're having a
[1:51:47] hard time fully committing something to
[1:51:49] God, maybe they keep digging up things
[1:51:52] that maybe even old hurts and things
[1:51:54] like that that instead of just burying
[1:51:57] those things under the sea of
[1:51:58] forgetfulness and keeping them under the
[1:52:00] blood, they keep digging them back up
[1:52:01] and it causes bitterness and it causes
[1:52:04] hurts.
[1:52:06] Father, I pray that you'd be with them.
[1:52:08] Help them to be able to commit those
[1:52:10] things to you, Father. Grant it, Jesus.
[1:52:15] Lord, we give this service to you,
[1:52:18] Lord. I pray you would do the part that
[1:52:19] only you can do, Lord. The supernatural,
[1:52:21] Lord, if there's healing that's needed,
[1:52:23] if there's victory that's needed, I pray
[1:52:24] that you'd come and quicken that to your
[1:52:26] children by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:29] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:52:45] Amen. Let's try this together as brother
[1:52:47] Jack comes. Oh, it's amazing
[1:52:51] [singing]
[1:52:52] grace.
[1:52:53] Oh, how sweet
[1:52:56] the sound.
[1:52:59] I know it saved [singing]
[1:53:03] a rich
[1:53:06] like me.
[1:53:15] Was lost but
[1:53:18] now
[1:53:21] I'm found.
[1:53:23] was blind,
[1:53:27] but now
[1:53:29] I see.

[1:54:24] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise for
[1:54:26] the word of the Lord.
[1:54:30] Amen. Onto today.
[1:54:34] Thank God for this um word from heaven,
[1:54:39] the power of [music] committ. And and I
[1:54:41] know um that was if it wasn't for
[1:54:44] nobody, it was for [music] me because I
[1:54:47] I I I need to be reminded once you take
[1:54:50] your hands off, don't go back. Just
[1:54:54] I mean just really just give it to God
[1:54:57] and forget about it. Lord, I needed
[1:55:00] that. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:55:02] speaking to me. Amen.
[1:55:06] Amen.
[1:55:08] Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; I wanted to we just just got a few
[1:55:13] minutes before we have to leave, but um
[1:55:15] I wanted to mention some of the saints
[1:55:17] were not able to make it here on Friday
[1:55:19] night. And um I uh I didn't announce it
[1:55:24] last Sunday because it didn't come to
[1:55:25] me. [music] But as I was studying uh on
[1:55:28] Tuesday night, getting ready for
[1:55:30] Wednesday night, uh I was going through
[1:55:33] my notes and and I noticed in my notes I
[1:55:36] had [music] a testimony that had
[1:55:38] happened years ago uh with me and
[1:55:40] brother Nathan and uh we were in um in
[1:55:44] Indiana. My wife had lost her telephone
[1:55:47] and uh she misplaced it. We [music]
[1:55:49] couldn't we didn't we just didn't know
[1:55:51] what had happened or where it was. So
[1:55:53] she said, "When y'all take the rental
[1:55:55] car back, please look in the rental car
[1:55:56] to see if y'all can find it." So we both
[1:55:58] looked, eyes everywhere. And
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; uh and we couldn't find it. So brother
[1:56:03] Nathan said, "Let's pray. Let's pray
[1:56:05] before uh uh we do anything else."
[1:56:08] [music] And he prayed and in his prayer,
[1:56:11] he uh prayed that Lord, you allowed uh
[1:56:15] Saul to find his his mules that were
[1:56:18] lost. and uh [music] we believe you to
[1:56:21] be the same God today as you were back
[1:56:22] then. And we were just preparing to read
[1:56:24] that scripture, that story in the
[1:56:26] scripture on [music] Wednesday night. So
[1:56:28] when he prayed that prayer, he says,
[1:56:29] "Lord, we know that you know where the
[1:56:31] telephone is and you if you could let
[1:56:33] Saul find the muse, [music] you'll let
[1:56:34] us find the telephone." Soon as he said,
[1:56:36] "Amen, open our eyes and looked there in
[1:56:39] the car." It was a little pocket there
[1:56:41] in the car. And we looked in that pocket
[1:56:44] before and didn't see it, but after
[1:56:46] prayer, [music] it showed up in that
[1:56:48] pocket.
[1:56:51] Amen. [applause]
[1:56:54] And um so it reminded me, [music] you
[1:56:58] know, of um you know, just how the Lord
[1:57:00] has used our brother. Many times God has
[1:57:02] honored his prayers. [music] I mean,
[1:57:04] he's prayed for many sick people here.
[1:57:06] Uh Sister Tanya was dealing with [music]
[1:57:09] uh uh cancer and uh he prayed a prayer
[1:57:12] and God healed her of cancer. [music]
[1:57:14] Uh, I mean there's there's many others
[1:57:16] that have testimonies where God has
[1:57:18] touched them. [music]
[1:57:19] And uh, I wanted to just offer uh, while
[1:57:22] we got just a little time, those that
[1:57:23] were not here on Friday night, [music]
[1:57:26] if you would like to come and just
[1:57:28] receive prayer for something while the
[1:57:30] ministry is here, and I know God honors
[1:57:33] his prayers. We've had people come in uh
[1:57:36] uh in our prayer lines here at Spirit
[1:57:38] [music] of Truth, people that couldn't
[1:57:39] have babies and God blessed their unions
[1:57:43] uh and gave [music] them start giving
[1:57:44] them children. Brother Joe Underwood and
[1:57:46] his wife, Sister Rebecca, they had seven
[1:57:48] years without children and uh and they
[1:57:50] come through a prayer line and God God
[1:57:52] blessed them. [music] So, we know God
[1:57:54] hears uh our brother's prayer. And uh if
[1:57:57] you would just mix your faith with uh
[1:57:59] with what God has done in his life,
[1:58:01] [music] I believe God can do something
[1:58:03] for you. So, if there's anybody that
[1:58:05] would like to have prayer, uh I just
[1:58:07] want you to line up right here on the
[1:58:09] right side, right over here. Just line
[1:58:11] up real quickly because I won't have
[1:58:12] much [music] time. But if you want
[1:58:14] prayer, just line up right there. Just
[1:58:15] stay there. The deacon will bring you
[1:58:17] one second, sis. One second. Anybody
[1:58:19] else that want prayer, just line up
[1:58:20] behind our sister. [music] The deacons
[1:58:22] will anoint you with all. If you if you
[1:58:24] want prayer, come to this line over
[1:58:25] here. If you want prayer, come to this
[1:58:27] line. Amen. The deacon will anoint you
[1:58:29] with oil and we'll have you [music] uh
[1:58:32] come for prayer. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:58:35] All right. Glory to God. Amen. Amen.
[1:58:38] [music] Those that are in seats, uh you
[1:58:40] can just be seated if you just keep your
[1:58:42] heads bowed. Amen. While we pray for
[1:58:44] these, Amen. that are coming through. Uh

[2:09:46] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:09:49] Blessed be his holy name.
[2:09:53] Amen.
[2:09:55] Amen. We read a quote on Friday night
[2:09:58] that when we come in the right [music]
[2:10:01] spirit, Amen. Agreeing with what God's
[2:10:04] word has said concerning us, it says it
[2:10:07] might not happen immediately,
[2:10:09] [music]
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; but it's over right after the prayer of
[2:10:12] faith is prayer of faith has been
[2:10:13] prayed. Amen. We declare whatever you
[2:10:17] have need of. Amen. It's over.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; It's over. We thank God. We thank God
[2:10:22] for brother Nathan. Amen. And him coming
[2:10:25] and pressing his way. And what a
[2:10:28] blessing he has been. Amen. To us. Y'all
[2:10:31] keep them in prayer. They'll be heading
[2:10:32] [music] back uh north. Amen. A little
[2:10:35] bit later today and trying to make it
[2:10:37] home by tomorrow to Indiana. So keep
[2:10:40] them in your prayers. [music] Amen. Uh,
[2:10:42] I also want to make mention, I know
[2:10:44] Sister Zelma had put in a prayer
[2:10:46] request. She sent in a request and I
[2:10:49] wanted her to know [music] because she
[2:10:50] was watching online. We did pray for her
[2:10:53] request. Brother Nathan and I prayed
[2:10:55] [music] for it uh before we came out and
[2:10:58] I just kind of told him a little bit
[2:10:59] about her need. Uh, but in his prayer,
[2:11:03] he prayed. He said, "Uh, father, even if
[2:11:07] you have to uh uh use the [music]
[2:11:11] mechanic to to do her job for free
[2:11:18] and and and and I didn't tell him that
[2:11:21] she was actually waiting on the
[2:11:23] mechanic's boss to come back home so the
[2:11:25] mechanic could talk to the boss, amen,
[2:11:27] about her car." But he prayed in his
[2:11:30] prayer that God if [music] they have to
[2:11:31] just do it for free just to be a
[2:11:32] blessing to her then I say Lord we'll
[2:11:35] receive it. We'll receive it. Amen. So
[2:11:39] the prayer of faith has [music] gone
[2:11:40] forth and even she had a desire for a
[2:11:42] job. Amen. On this side and so brother
[2:11:46] Nathan come right out here at the
[2:11:47] beginning of the sermon start talking
[2:11:48] about you know people might need a job
[2:11:50] you know because they they they want to
[2:11:52] relocate. He said that right at the
[2:11:54] beginning I said that was for sister
[2:11:55] Zelma. wasn't even here personally, but
[2:11:57] she was online and that was just for
[2:11:59] her. So, we just thank God. We thank God
[2:12:01] for the job that our sister needs. Thank
[2:12:04] God for her car getting fixed. We thank
[2:12:06] God. Amen. In advance,
[2:12:09] he's mindful of every need. So, God is
[2:12:11] God is God is moving, church. God is
[2:12:14] moving. Amen. We'll be back on on
[2:12:16] Wednesday night. Amen. At

[2:12:28] time uh to dismiss you. Amen. We'll have
[2:12:31] a word of prayer before we're [music]
[2:12:32] dismissed. Father, we thank you, oh God,
[2:12:34] for um all that you have done. Lord, I
[2:12:39] believe that as we [music] come
[2:12:40] according to your word, that Lord, we
[2:12:43] commit it to you knowing that you will
[2:12:45] bring your [music] word to pass. Every
[2:12:46] promise that you've made, not one will
[2:12:49] fall to the ground and return void, but
[2:12:52] it will accomplish the very purpose
[2:12:54] [music] and intent that you have sent it
[2:12:56] forth into the earth to accomplish. We
[2:12:58] pray your blessings upon our precious
[2:13:00] brother Nathan. Thank you for this great
[2:13:02] sacrifice to [music] press through what
[2:13:03] he was feeling in his body to bring us
[2:13:06] the words of life. And Lord, we we have
[2:13:08] been strengthened and encouraged by both
[2:13:11] sermons, oh God. And Lord, we we leave
[2:13:13] here, Amen, better [music] Christians
[2:13:15] because of what we've heard. We ask, oh
[2:13:18] God, that as as he prepares to get on
[2:13:20] the road with his precious son that you
[2:13:22] would go before them, [music] that you
[2:13:23] would give them traveling mercies. That
[2:13:25] you would continue to touch his body and
[2:13:27] Lord, watch over his wife and his other
[2:13:29] children and the church back home, Lord,
[2:13:31] and that [music] when he gets back that
[2:13:33] everything will be running smooth, oh
[2:13:35] God, there'll be no issues. Bless us as
[2:13:37] we leave this place, [music] but not
[2:13:38] your presence. God, may you bring us
[2:13:40] back again at the appointed time on
[2:13:42] Wednesday night. And Father, we be
[2:13:43] careful to give you all the glory, all
[2:13:45] the honor, and all [music] the praise.
[2:13:48] It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:13:52] Praise the Lord. The Lord bless [music]
[2:13:53] you. You can be seated. The brothers
