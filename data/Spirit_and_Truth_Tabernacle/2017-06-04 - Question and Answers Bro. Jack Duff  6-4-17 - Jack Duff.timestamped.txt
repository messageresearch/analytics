[1:03:45] thing I want to make mention of his own
[1:03:47] brother wesco he'll be turning 75 this
[1:03:51] year his birthday is July 4th they'll be
[1:03:55] having amen a picnic in honor of him but
[1:04:00] they did they were trying to just kind
[1:04:02] of keep the cost down if you're the best
[1:04:04] because they don't want to do me a
[1:04:07] banquet mr.north keep the cost down they
[1:04:10] decided on doing a picnic but
[1:04:14] unfortunately even enjoy the picnic they
[1:04:17] still have to charge because the picnic
[1:04:20] is limited to how many people they can
[1:04:22] actually have there and so they wanted
[1:04:25] to charge and I believe is like maybe
[1:04:28] five dollars a person start my maxim is
[1:04:31] it eight dollars
[1:04:34] three eight eight four adults are there
[1:04:37] five four kids so I'll keep that in mind
[1:04:39] we will there'll be a time that will
[1:04:42] come lap to collect the money make sure
[1:04:43] we give it to all them and that way we
[1:04:46] are we're represented at the pig nation
[1:04:48] a man and I so we just we just want to
[1:04:50] go in to celebrate him and I knew it a
[1:04:53] good lessons on that 75 years old it's
[1:04:58] this point it's just I know for the west
[1:05:01] coast real blessing so at anytime we're
[1:05:04] all they were just kind of supportive
[1:05:05] and whatever way he should just
[1:05:06] appreciate it so let's do all we can to
[1:05:08] do that so just keep those things in
[1:05:10] mind we will just continue to make Mitch
[1:05:12] love it as soon as the days approach so
[1:05:15] praise the Lord I think that's all I
[1:05:18] need to see musicians thank you all so
[1:05:21] much for your service on today man the
[1:05:26] Lord bless you that you have your seats
[1:05:29] and I did want to thank the Lord for the
[1:05:34] specials that went forth and man thank
[1:05:37] you all a man for the contribution to
[1:05:41] the service praise the Lord
[1:05:44] we're just just so so grateful for what
[1:05:47] we feel the Lord doing in this place
[1:05:50] a man he is a mighty a man and I
[1:05:57] you know just sometimes you sit back and
[1:06:00] just observe and you look at you know
[1:06:02] different things like man asked man
[1:06:04] that's God that's God that's God you
[1:06:06] know and I what I find that we got to
[1:06:08] start giving more praise to God by what
[1:06:10] he doing rather than giving the devil
[1:06:13] too much credit because you know anytime
[1:06:15] the devil's moving you know God can't
[1:06:18] God is up to something because that God
[1:06:21] is up to something right and the devil
[1:06:24] sometimes the devil know what God up to
[1:06:25] before you know and he's trying to block
[1:06:28] it right so you you have to just stay in
[1:06:30] tune with what the Spirit of the Lord
[1:06:33] has promised you a man in this hour now
[1:06:36] I won't I won't take too much time
[1:06:38] talking we'll go right into the word of
[1:06:40] the Lord today if you just join me in
[1:06:42] reading a man a scripture
[1:06:46] probably two scriptures that will read
[1:06:49] from Genesis 3 and also Jeremiah 8 and
[1:06:53] then Genesis 3 starting at verse 9 and
[1:06:57] then we'll turn to Jeremiah 8 and just
[1:07:00] praying that the Holy Spirit ooh let us
[1:07:02] be able to bring these thoughts together
[1:07:04] amen today
[1:07:07] Genesis chapter 3 verse 9 man it says
[1:07:15] when the Lord God called unto Adam and
[1:07:18] said unto Him where art thou and he said
[1:07:23] I heard thy voice in the garden I was
[1:07:26] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[1:07:29] myself and he said who told thee that
[1:07:33] thou was naked passed out eaten of the
[1:07:37] tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:07:39] should not eat and the man said the
[1:07:43] woman whom thou gave is to be with me
[1:07:45] she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:07:49] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:07:53] what is this that thou has done and the
[1:07:57] woman the woman said the serpent
[1:07:59] beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord
[1:08:04] God said unto the serpent because thou
[1:08:06] has done this thou art cursed above all
[1:08:09] cattle and above every beast of the
[1:08:11] field upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[1:08:13] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:08:16] life and I will put enmity between thee
[1:08:19] and the woman between thy seed and her
[1:08:22] seed it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:08:24] shalt bruise his heel
[1:08:27] j-man the Lord is a blessing to the
[1:08:30] reading that and I'll just read quickly
[1:08:33] from Jeremiah chapter 8
[1:08:52] verse 22 says it there no balm in Gilead
[1:08:56] is there no physician there while then
[1:09:00] is not the health of the daughter of my
[1:09:02] people recover a man so let's just have
[1:09:06] a word of Prayer
[1:09:07] as we approach the word of the Lord
[1:09:11] today father we thank you for the
[1:09:13] ability again to read scripture but we
[1:09:18] know the Holy Spirit is the one who must
[1:09:21] give us interpretation of what Scripture
[1:09:23] speaks to us so we ask God that as we
[1:09:26] would go through this thought today's to
[1:09:29] God would just go in front of us that
[1:09:31] you would just open up on understanding
[1:09:35] and father in doing so you it draws
[1:09:37] closer to you through Lord through
[1:09:41] revelation because realizing that when
[1:09:43] we leave this place we have to have
[1:09:45] something with standing on and the
[1:09:47] greatest foundation we can find is the
[1:09:49] Word of God because heavens earth will
[1:09:51] pass but the word will remain forever so
[1:09:54] help us God to receive revelation in our
[1:09:56] hearts and through that let us stand
[1:09:59] against the enemy
[1:10:01] it's a jesus christ name that we pray a
[1:10:03] man saying man god bless you bless you
[1:10:08] we want to just use for a title today
[1:10:15] questions and answers and man questions
[1:10:19] and answers and I'll start by reading a
[1:10:25] quote here from the sermon God's chosen
[1:10:30] place of worship they meant something
[1:10:32] that the Prophet said here in this
[1:10:34] sermon God's chosen place of worship and
[1:10:38] he starts out by saying my subject
[1:10:41] tonight is God's chosen place of worship
[1:10:43] if you notice the month of ABA D or ABA
[1:10:48] B there is means April the month of
[1:10:51] april's when they were brought out they
[1:10:53] said and now the strange thing is that
[1:10:56] we - - worshipers of God in this day we
[1:10:59] live in we find so many different ideas
[1:11:02] as people and as long as their different
[1:11:05] idea
[1:11:05] about things there's there's got
[1:11:08] different questions there's got to be
[1:11:11] one true answer to every question that's
[1:11:15] asked there's got to be one true answer
[1:11:18] to every question that asks if I would
[1:11:21] ask the question what is this and he's
[1:11:25] pointing at the pulpit there says well
[1:11:28] they say a desk what is it for see now
[1:11:31] that somebody might say it isn't a desk
[1:11:33] it's a board well it's a bore but yet
[1:11:36] it's a desk
[1:11:37] you see there's got to be a true answer
[1:11:40] to it and if I would ask a question
[1:11:43] about anything there's got to be a true
[1:11:45] answer there could be something close to
[1:11:47] it but there's got to be a true direct
[1:11:51] answer to every question so therefore
[1:11:54] every question that comes up in our
[1:11:57] lives there has got to be a true correct
[1:12:02] answer a man I love the way that the
[1:12:05] Prophet puts that he said there's got to
[1:12:07] be a true and correct answer and one
[1:12:10] other place the Prophet said if there is
[1:12:12] a Bible question then there must be a
[1:12:16] Bible answer right a man you if somebody
[1:12:21] comes to you approach with a Bible
[1:12:22] question you got to be able to go to
[1:12:24] your Bible and get the Bible answer
[1:12:26] right and he also said if there's a
[1:12:29] reason that people would have a question
[1:12:32] is because they said there's a deep you
[1:12:35] know inside of that person that's
[1:12:37] calling out to a deep and if there's a
[1:12:39] defendant that's calling out that he
[1:12:41] says there must be a deep somewhere to
[1:12:44] respond to that cry hey man so you know
[1:12:47] I know for myself as I was just coming
[1:12:50] up as a young man you have all kind of
[1:12:53] questions about God and you know who is
[1:12:55] God you know where to God come from you
[1:13:00] know how did mankind begin and you know
[1:13:02] where the first man come from you know
[1:13:05] all these things and when we when we go
[1:13:07] back to a scripture we find the answer
[1:13:10] so many of these things you know as far
[1:13:12] as where man came from and and how God
[1:13:15] made man in the beginning and create
[1:13:17] and how he created woman took the rear
[1:13:19] bothers a man a creative woman we find
[1:13:21] all those answers but you know I
[1:13:22] remember just being a young boy and just
[1:13:24] not really understanding God you know
[1:13:26] and just just you know who he was I mean
[1:13:29] I figured this world was pretty big so
[1:13:31] he must be a big God you know I mean
[1:13:33] huge you know and and I like this little
[1:13:37] building that always talked about the
[1:13:38] hotel over there in Palm Beach and I we
[1:13:40] would sit on the we stand in West Palm
[1:13:44] Beach and look across the Palm Beach and
[1:13:46] you know we would we would be fishing
[1:13:49] there and I see that big old building us
[1:13:50] a man that thing is shaped just like a
[1:13:52] little a chair you know not about a big
[1:13:55] chair not a little chair but shake like
[1:13:56] a big chair I say that's got to be the
[1:13:59] throne where God dwells that was in my
[1:14:02] mind I'm thinking God sitting on that
[1:14:03] building no he was sitting on that
[1:14:05] building I found out a long time he like
[1:14:07] sitting on that building but he is
[1:14:09] sitting on this building
[1:14:11] he's living inside of this building
[1:14:13] right and I mean you are you are the
[1:14:15] place where God dwells it's in your
[1:14:17] heart that God dwells it you got a
[1:14:19] little compartment in your heart where
[1:14:21] you smooth well and that's the place
[1:14:23] that God gets them any controls
[1:14:24] everything that you do praise God for
[1:14:27] that right you know I had I had
[1:14:29] questions that many of us have had
[1:14:31] questions enough and only God is the one
[1:14:33] that can actually provide you know some
[1:14:35] of the answers but I want to just kind
[1:14:37] of talk on the subject of questions and
[1:14:39] answers because you know when we when we
[1:14:40] when we preach back in Genesis let's see
[1:14:42] there were some questions and asked and
[1:14:45] sometimes there was answers given other
[1:14:47] times they were important the answer
[1:14:48] hallelujah amen sometimes God asked the
[1:14:51] question people aboard the answer but it
[1:14:54] does not mean God don't want an answer
[1:14:55] to this question if you ever ask them
[1:14:58] out of question they start even then go
[1:15:00] on here and go in there you just reword
[1:15:02] the question right but you gonna get
[1:15:04] your answer because you need to have an
[1:15:06] answer to that question and the only
[1:15:08] reason you go into that person to ask
[1:15:10] the question is because you know that
[1:15:12] individual has the answer Amen that
[1:15:16] person can settle what is going on
[1:15:18] inside of you
[1:15:19] glory to God so you know when I went
[1:15:22] with the other thing that I love about
[1:15:23] God is that when God is asking the
[1:15:25] question God already knows he has
[1:15:29] hey he already knows the answer so
[1:15:32] during don't think you being smarter you
[1:15:34] outsmart God when you avoiding you know
[1:15:36] the question but God already knows the
[1:15:38] answer he's waiting to see how you gonna
[1:15:40] respond all right stay with me here
[1:15:43] today one of the questions that was
[1:15:45] asked in the beginning a man of
[1:15:47] Scripture you know and we'll pick up
[1:15:50] Adam and even a little bit but you know
[1:15:53] one of the questions that was asked it
[1:15:55] was asked to Abraham it was asked to
[1:15:58] Sarah here God had come down to visit
[1:16:00] Abraham and Sarah and he was there you
[1:16:03] know at their tent and he was eating and
[1:16:06] you know and just having fellowship with
[1:16:07] them and and then he began to tell
[1:16:09] Abraham and say you know Abraham sare
[1:16:12] your wife is going to have a son I
[1:16:14] promise you and stare your wife is going
[1:16:16] to have a son and as he started fitting
[1:16:18] there the tension talked with Abraham
[1:16:20] and Sarah inside the tent of Sarah
[1:16:23] begins to laugh at her heart and when
[1:16:25] she begin to laugh in our heart you say
[1:16:27] where's Sarah and why she laughing you
[1:16:29] know and services no no I want laughing
[1:16:31] no no no I know you were laughing you
[1:16:33] were in the tent laughing that at what I
[1:16:35] just said because Sarah just could not
[1:16:38] believe that you know she said how can
[1:16:40] me and my Lord have pleasure together at
[1:16:43] the age that we are so how can we even
[1:16:45] you know have pleasure how can we even
[1:16:46] how could I even give birth to a child
[1:16:48] so they keep the fun land that was just
[1:16:50] impossible glory to God and I bring that
[1:16:52] out this morning cuz you might be facing
[1:16:54] something I think it's just impossible
[1:16:56] don't don't think that way because God
[1:16:58] had a question of Abraham and Sarah when
[1:17:01] they begin to think that way I don't
[1:17:03] know how you thinking this morning but
[1:17:04] if you think if something is too
[1:17:06] difficult God got a question for you and
[1:17:08] I would say he already know the answer
[1:17:10] but he's still gonna ask you to see if
[1:17:12] you know the answer and then the
[1:17:14] question is is there anything too hard
[1:17:17] for the Lord that's the question of the
[1:17:20] act there that's the question in the ax
[1:17:21] Abraham is there anything that's too
[1:17:24] hard for the Lord now if you when you
[1:17:26] when you look at a date and give them an
[1:17:27] answer they they never gave him an
[1:17:31] answer they never said no that's nothing
[1:17:32] too hard for you they just kind of kept
[1:17:34] going on but God knew he was going to
[1:17:36] bring that thing that the promise that
[1:17:38] he's made he was gonna bring in the past
[1:17:40] but he got
[1:17:41] I'm not hallelujah
[1:17:45] and the reason he brought the
[1:17:47] questioning Abraham because you know
[1:17:48] Abraham and Sarah would fulfill what he
[1:17:51] had promised I know you looking at how
[1:17:55] old you are I know you're looking at you
[1:17:57] know your veins all dried up and you
[1:18:00] can't do this you can't I know you
[1:18:01] looking at all that but my question is
[1:18:03] there anything too hard for the Lord it
[1:18:05] might be too hard for the doctor but is
[1:18:10] it to offer the Lord and my answer this
[1:18:12] morning is no there is nothing too hard
[1:18:15] for the ROI it might be too hard for me
[1:18:19] but there's nothing too hard for the
[1:18:21] look I don't even answer to the question
[1:18:26] and whatever you go through you got to
[1:18:28] give your own answer to the question a
[1:18:30] man you don't get what you expect all
[1:18:34] right but you know there's nothing too
[1:18:35] hard for oh let's let's just read a
[1:18:37] little bit from from this this this
[1:18:39] sermon is there anything too hard for
[1:18:42] the Lord just want to just kind of slip
[1:18:43] this in before we go further amen
[1:18:46] the Prophet says that says in the book
[1:18:48] of Genesis the eighteenth chapter and
[1:18:49] the first eight words of the fourteenth
[1:18:52] verse I would like to read this it says
[1:18:54] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:18:58] and now just a little drama to kind of
[1:19:00] kind of catch the feeling of the
[1:19:02] audience hours before they come to get
[1:19:04] me while I stay in a room praying
[1:19:06] waiting close the doors nobody bothers
[1:19:08] me and I just keep praying praying and
[1:19:10] then when I feel his presence real near
[1:19:14] sometimes I look up and see it that
[1:19:16] light that you see in the picture and
[1:19:18] they've got around the world now then
[1:19:20] coming to the meeting I'd like to walk
[1:19:22] right in and kind of feel out the
[1:19:25] meeting to see where the Holy Spirit is
[1:19:27] moving and then I can have my prayer
[1:19:29] line going and and now we see in the
[1:19:33] first part of this chapter Abraham was
[1:19:35] setting in the door of his tent on a
[1:19:37] real hot day it must have been a very
[1:19:38] hot day perhaps a lot of complaints have
[1:19:41] been coming in lately by the herdsmen
[1:19:43] and that the grass was all gone the land
[1:19:46] was drying up and that the cattles were
[1:19:49] coming very thin and also that the water
[1:19:51] supply was just about all gone they
[1:19:53] found the water
[1:19:54] hosing the land and as the water got low
[1:19:56] they would dig out and dig out till they
[1:19:58] got down to where the water's was water
[1:20:00] was seeping through the rocks and still
[1:20:02] the cattle did not have enough water to
[1:20:05] supply them you know sometimes when
[1:20:07] things are going wrong dark we know
[1:20:10] about nature that is darkest just before
[1:20:12] day and many times when we see
[1:20:15] disastrous things happening like that
[1:20:18] especially to believers we must bear
[1:20:22] this in our mind that is Satan trying to
[1:20:25] block the blessing that's on this road
[1:20:27] now I got to stop and pause right there

[1:24:36] I'm going to reach up and grab mine
[1:24:38] there is a blessing that's on his Road
[1:24:41] he said that that was very much so in
[1:24:44] the case state was trying to tempt them
[1:24:46] to feel that they had done wrong and was
[1:24:49] trying to block the oncoming visitation
[1:24:52] that God was going to give to Abraham
[1:24:54] and Sarah now y'all know name/number the
[1:24:57] truth when they tell us that you don't
[1:24:58] did this that's why this is going wrong
[1:24:59] you don't did that that's why this
[1:25:01] because I did nothing wrong actually you
[1:25:05] had to get permission to do this and the
[1:25:08] reason you the reason I'm going through
[1:25:09] cuz God had confidence that I would keep
[1:25:12] standing in the midst of it hallelujah
[1:25:16] look at him say say I was trying to
[1:25:18] block the oncoming visitation and God
[1:25:20] was going to give Abraham and Sarah and
[1:25:21] we're talking scriptures that all things
[1:25:24] work together for good to them that love
[1:25:25] God no matter how bad it seems remember
[1:25:28] it has to be working for your good
[1:25:29] I'm so glad of that you know we even get
[1:25:32] hit it's morning at a trial I mean just
[1:25:37] just from Sunday to Sunday trial trial
[1:25:39] trial trial trial you know one of the
[1:25:42] systems uh you know just the slight
[1:25:44] mistake but a car ends up on top of us

[1:25:51] the parking thing so I mean we get downs
[1:25:55] of cars on toxic we going in the free
[1:25:57] anyway and we go pray and then we come
[1:25:59] out and we don't we gonna get it out of
[1:26:02] here somehow I'm gonna be just like okay
[1:26:03] well you know we trying to put all our
[1:26:05] heads together to get the car out and
[1:26:07] finally some guy just showed up out of
[1:26:09] nowhere his name was Brian free for
[1:26:14] Brian
[1:26:14] but he's certified he should about Brian
[1:26:17] okay he showed up out of nowhere and he
[1:26:20] says recent grabbing it that's twisted
[1:26:22] it up and we pull that thing out of
[1:26:24] there so now back to copy they'd rather
[1:26:26] go home and Ryan got his car left
[1:26:29] got it Ryan where we praying for Ryan
[1:26:38] come on church Oh God
[1:26:42] hey maybe nothing too hard for God glory
[1:26:47] to God we remember our counter stuff we
[1:26:50] tried it all Jack the car trying to pull
[1:26:52] off the Jackie and all kind of things we
[1:26:54] doing we trying to get that call desktop
[1:26:56] hallelujah
[1:26:57] hey man and I tell you if it would have
[1:26:59] took us to lift the car God will give us
[1:27:01] trip to do that if that's what it would
[1:27:03] it took a man ain't nothing too hard for
[1:27:06] God all right I'm moving on questions
[1:27:10] and answers you got questions I got
[1:27:11] answers all right Lord how is why not
[1:27:14] this amen all right come on let's keep
[1:27:18] going
[1:27:18] hey say say uh he said uh he says uh
[1:27:22] that they was very much so in this case
[1:27:27] they was trying to tempt him to feel
[1:27:28] that that I'm wrong and was trying to
[1:27:30] block the oncoming visitation that God
[1:27:32] was going to give to Abraham and Sarah
[1:27:34] and we're taught in the scriptures that
[1:27:35] all things work together for good to
[1:27:39] them that love God and no matter how bad
[1:27:41] it seems remember it has to be remember
[1:27:49] it has to be working for your good that
[1:27:55] I'm so glad of that a man Satan's been
[1:27:58] out to me all day and I can say all week
[1:28:00] so I just believe that there's a
[1:28:02] blessing in store here in this city can
[1:28:07] I pay in this church there's a blessing
[1:28:09] in store right somewhere and I know when
[1:28:12] he tempts and tries to block out what's
[1:28:15] he trying to get you to disbelieve and
[1:28:17] if the worst thing that you can do is
[1:28:20] just believe God and as soon as you get
[1:28:23] a little skirt scared well maybe I
[1:28:26] haven't done this I haven't done that
[1:28:27] right there's things got that blessing
[1:28:29] conquer for you
[1:28:30] you can't get it as you can't get to it
[1:28:33] as long as Satan let you think that
[1:28:37] since perhaps if we would listen to such
[1:28:40] things of temptations like that and we
[1:28:42] would pay attention to them then it
[1:28:45] would be that we would miss the blessing
[1:28:47] so my advice to you don't even pay
[1:28:50] attention or whatever the devil doing
[1:28:52] gah got purpose it's all working
[1:28:55] together for good you I want to say it
[1:28:58] again it's all working together to do
[1:29:01] this sometimes I just sit back and I
[1:29:03] listen to the trial that's it
[1:29:07] God is working right here got to admit
[1:29:09] you we can't see it yet but God is
[1:29:11] moving right here God give me and do
[1:29:13] something with that right there it's all
[1:29:15] working together for good would you just
[1:29:18] do me a favor before I go for just five
[1:29:20] somebody shake their hand and say it is
[1:29:22] all working together to good it all
[1:29:28] make sure you emphasize all oh oh oh
[1:29:38] it's all working together the good it's
[1:29:44] all
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:53] glory glory glory I mean no matter what
[1:30:00] it is that your faces oh and what no
[1:30:02] matter what you gotta face is all
[1:30:04] working together for your good
[1:30:07] hallelujah
[1:30:08] see the person for purposes of asking
[1:30:11] the question it's so that you can obtain
[1:30:14] the answer and the reason that you ask a
[1:30:17] specific person is because you have
[1:30:19] confidence that that person is able to
[1:30:22] provide not just the answer but the
[1:30:25] correct answer right because if there's
[1:30:28] a questions got to be a correct answer
[1:30:29] right so so you ask that person because
[1:30:32] they're able to provide to you the
[1:30:34] correct answer
[1:30:36] now now now now the other thing is when
[1:30:37] God is asking questions to people when
[1:30:40] he acts Abraham and Sarah is there
[1:30:42] anything too hard for the Lord he knew
[1:30:44] even though they didn't respond
[1:30:45] he knew today was still bring forth the
[1:30:47] right answer and the promised son came
[1:30:50] through Abraham and Sarah praise the
[1:30:52] Lord
[1:30:52] he also one time stopped ezq any acts of
[1:30:56] the question he first looking into this
[1:30:58] you know this Val Aquila tribe owns a
[1:31:00] dead
[1:31:01] situation dad circumstance then it's a
[1:31:06] look impossible I mean I see I just see
[1:31:09] bones no skins or nothing to life just
[1:31:13] bones around here this is a dad
[1:31:16] circumstance and it looks the exact
[1:31:18] things that's on ax men look at this
[1:31:19] look at all this look at this and let me
[1:31:21] ask them a question something that had

[1:39:10] the sons of God shouted for joy talk
[1:39:12] about something new we just got a new
[1:39:14] case of the old time time that's all
[1:39:17] certainly shouted for joy what a time
[1:39:21] sounds Mo's are we supposed to be able
[1:39:23] to shout a man we spoke be able to do
[1:39:26] that and any time the word get good to
[1:39:28] you can let out a good shout do you know
[1:39:32] the way they got the walls down in
[1:39:34] Jericho
[1:39:35] threw a shot maybe you'll get some
[1:39:39] overcoming power when you begin to shout
[1:39:43] dance it represent victory Oh hallelujah
[1:39:48] glory to come on church we got to be
[1:39:53] afraid if this is this is when you go
[1:39:56] through you find out in the middle of
[1:39:57] your briefs I don't know about you but I
[1:39:59] don't been there I mean sometimes people
[1:40:02] don't know that you're going through but
[1:40:03] here you come to church you just
[1:40:05] beginning aunt Janet began the worship
[1:40:07] it just began to praise God and why you
[1:40:09] getting free a man that thing that you
[1:40:11] worried about also kids free
[1:40:14] and I think what happens Amen even if
[1:40:18] the situation has changed what happened
[1:40:20] is that we change in the situation our
[1:40:23] outlook changes Oh our response changes
[1:40:26] our attitude changes and when that
[1:40:29] changed with the other thing shake but
[1:40:32] it starts with the wash shop shovel old
[1:40:36] time old time thing they did that before
[1:40:38] the foundation of the world and we still
[1:40:40] doing it today
[1:40:43] flore glory glory glory glory all right
[1:40:46] stay with me here so there was another
[1:40:48] question that was axed by the Lord he
[1:40:52] saw he was there with the disciples then
[1:40:58] he asked the question who do men say I
[1:41:01] am the cyclist gave an answer and I said
[1:41:04] well something I've easy if you to
[1:41:06] answer other people's responses well
[1:41:10] this is what some say reliance some say
[1:41:12] Jeremiah say it's one of the prophets
[1:41:14] that's what other people said so it's
[1:41:16] very easy to repeat what somebody else
[1:41:18] have said but then he changed the
[1:41:20] question who do you say that I the Son
[1:41:25] of Man am I'm not thinking about what
[1:41:26] they say now I want to know what you say
[1:41:28] I stick it quiet
[1:41:33] maybe somebody thinking like I don't
[1:41:35] want to say the wrong thing but P
[1:41:37] there's something by people Peter is a
[1:41:40] guy to Hale afraid to speak up right
[1:41:42] Peter this is it i'ma just see it all
[1:41:44] y'all are free to UM adjusts it I think
[1:41:46] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:41:48] Living God
[1:41:49] and when Peter said anything blasted I
[1:41:52] thought Simon birch others but flesh and
[1:41:55] blood have not revealed this to you but
[1:41:56] my father in heaven has revealed it
[1:41:58] anything upon this rock I'll build my
[1:42:01] church and the gates of Hell will not
[1:42:04] prevail Peter answered the question that
[1:42:08] for the right way when you answer the
[1:42:10] question right well you don't know what
[1:42:11] how to blessings might come Oh glory to
[1:42:15] God we have confidence in the omniscient
[1:42:18] God since he is all-knowing he is able
[1:42:23] to provide answers to
[1:42:25] all about questions David was going
[1:42:28] through a trial one time and and you
[1:42:30] know here he was fighting with the enemy
[1:42:32] on the field I saw he was raised up to
[1:42:35] sleep it's times but because of trials
[1:42:37] and tribulations he end up in in the
[1:42:38] camp with the field sometimes fighting
[1:42:40] fighting for the phils burns well as
[1:42:42] they were on the way to battle one day
[1:42:44] the the Philistine Lords this phenomena
[1:42:47] we don't want this guy David going with
[1:42:49] us because he is one of the israelites
[1:42:50] the weekend ready to go against the
[1:42:52] Israelites and in the battle he might
[1:42:53] turn against us so send him back home
[1:42:55] they send David back home he went back
[1:42:57] all downtrodden you know I can't believe
[1:43:00] that they won't let me fight that was
[1:43:01] just part of the trial but it will cure
[1:43:03] and be a greater trial when he got home
[1:43:05] we found out his wife his wives were
[1:43:07] taking children taken not all that the
[1:43:10] men that were with them their families
[1:43:11] were taken and David looked at that and
[1:43:14] he had some questions my and but the
[1:43:17] Bible say that when David got in that
[1:43:19] situation the man start beginning to
[1:43:21] talk about we got stone this guy David
[1:43:24] can't believe he led us into that like
[1:43:25] this we're gonna kill this guy date
[1:43:27] right now the Bible says David
[1:43:28] encouraged himself in the Lord and you
[1:43:30] don't have to learn how to do that no
[1:43:34] sometimes you might not get a telephone
[1:43:35] call but you can have to learn how to
[1:43:37] encourage yourself in the Lord you have
[1:43:41] to learn how to go to the Father
[1:43:43] yourself by the take yourself hey Matt
[1:43:47] sometimes you did you get your favorite
[1:43:48] things that you go back and listen to
[1:43:49] your favorite sermons that you go back
[1:43:51] and listen to come every time you listen
[1:43:53] till you get Rhian courage right a
[1:43:57] favorite scripture that you can go right
[1:43:59] back to because I mean Romans 8:28 every
[1:44:02] belief while to go there all things work
[1:44:05] together for good no matter what I'm
[1:44:07] going through is still working together
[1:44:08] for good right right here here David you
[1:44:11] know is going through this and and David
[1:44:13] you know finally after encouraged
[1:44:14] himself he had a time of Prayer and they
[1:44:17] begin to ask God a question the reason
[1:44:19] that we have confidence in God we have
[1:44:21] confidences and I'm missing God that
[1:44:24] he's all-knowing he's able to provide
[1:44:26] answers to our questions so David began
[1:44:29] to go in easy and first time you're 30
[1:44:32] verse 8 says David inquired at the Lord
[1:44:35] saying shall I pursue
[1:44:37] to this truth shall I overtake them and
[1:44:41] he answered him pursue but thou shalt
[1:44:45] surely overtake them and without fail
[1:44:48] recover all they've got an answer to his
[1:44:53] question and I don't I mean I mean that
[1:44:55] the question I mean the question said I
[1:44:57] pursue sell overtake them shall I do
[1:44:59] this and I say yeah you go ahead and do
[1:45:00] it because I'm gonna give you everything
[1:45:02] that the devil took from you God is wise
[1:45:05] his children got everything back and
[1:45:07] then start taking some of these spoils -
[1:45:09] oh my god is a good guy after hearing of
[1:45:16] the out of the Holy Ghost outpouring on
[1:45:17] the day of Pentecost many were told that
[1:45:20] God that God had made the crucified
[1:45:23] Jesus both Lord and Christ and the
[1:45:27] people that were standing on the day of
[1:45:28] Pentecost all the from different lands
[1:45:30] and different nations when they realized
[1:45:32] that they had crucified
[1:45:33] you know God some when they realized
[1:45:36] what happened they actually questioned
[1:45:37] say say say what must we do since we've
[1:45:40] done all this and we're wrong we're
[1:45:42] guilty what must we do they responded in
[1:45:45] Acts chapter 2 verse 37 now when they
[1:45:47] heard this they were pricked in their
[1:45:48] heart and sent an appealing to the rest
[1:45:50] of the Apostles men and brethren what
[1:45:51] shall we do that's the question then
[1:45:54] Peter said unto them this is the answer
[1:45:56] then Peter said to them repent and be
[1:45:58] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:46:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:46:03] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:46:04] Holy Ghost they had a question
[1:46:06] God had an answer I want to read this
[1:46:11] out of Matthew 19 to verse 16 this rich
[1:46:15] young ruler approached the Lord Jesus he
[1:46:18] also had some questions see we the
[1:46:20] reason that we go to the Lord Jesus
[1:46:22] because we know that he's the one that's
[1:46:24] able to give us the answer to the
[1:46:27] question that's the reason we pray we
[1:46:29] want we want to get in contact with
[1:46:31] somebody that can actually give us an
[1:46:32] answer I don't want to just waste my
[1:46:34] time just talking to people that came to
[1:46:36] nothing for me hallelujah right Amen I
[1:46:39] got to get to the person that can
[1:46:41] actually give me an action that's why

[1:46:55] out the way the 2000 workout when you go
[1:46:57] back you're not asking just to talk to
[1:46:58] the person that sold it to you escalate
[1:47:01] it
[1:47:02] and the reason you escalate it is
[1:47:05] because you want to get to the person
[1:47:07] that can actually do something about it
[1:47:08] who is the person that can refund me
[1:47:11] who's the person that can give me a
[1:47:12] credit you don't want to talk about to

[1:48:10] understand you got a million you got an
[1:48:17] answer to my question alright praise
[1:48:21] Allah this rich young ruler approached
[1:48:24] Jesus because he knew he would attain
[1:48:26] the correct answer look at this look at
[1:48:30] this in Matthew 19 verse 16 let's read
[1:48:33] it since my whole one came and said of
[1:48:37] him good master what good thing you see
[1:48:40] that what good thing shall I do it's all
[1:48:43] about trying to do good things
[1:48:45] just because you just get things don't
[1:48:46] mean you're gonna make it to heaven
[1:48:47] right good master what good thing shall
[1:48:51] I do that I may have eternal life right
[1:48:54] and he said unto him why callest thou me
[1:48:57] good there is none good but one that is
[1:48:59] God but if thou will enter into life
[1:49:01] keep the commandments
[1:49:03] he says in him which jeez which jesus
[1:49:06] said thou shalt do no murder so he's
[1:49:08] asking Jesus with questions now he's
[1:49:10] getting answers as he's asking the
[1:49:12] question Jesus has given him answer look
[1:49:14] it says he said of them which jesus said
[1:49:17] thou shalt do no murder thou shall not
[1:49:19] commit adultery thou should not steal
[1:49:21] thou shalt not bear false witness honor
[1:49:24] thy father and thy mother and thou and
[1:49:26] thou shalt love thy neighbor as myself
[1:49:28] the young man said to him all these
[1:49:30] things have I kept from my youth what
[1:49:33] lack I yet now you asked the question
[1:49:36] you're bout to get an answer now I got
[1:49:39] it you right here sometimes you ask
[1:49:41] the question and the answer you get is
[1:49:43] an answer that you don't like but it
[1:49:46] still the correct answer this man is
[1:49:49] about to get an answer that he does not
[1:49:51] like but it's still the right answer he
[1:49:54] actually asks what lack I yet so jesus
[1:49:57] said unto him if thou will be perfect go
[1:50:01] and sell that thou that thou hast and
[1:50:05] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:50:07] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[1:50:09] me but when the young man heard that
[1:50:12] saying he went away sorrowful for he had
[1:50:14] great possessions then said Jesus unto
[1:50:18] his disciples bear and I Jesus didn't
[1:50:20] even stop them from going away notice it
[1:50:22] now he said let him go see saying see
[1:50:24] see see you got you got questions God
[1:50:26] got the answer sometimes you don't like
[1:50:28] the answer because it's gonna cost you
[1:50:29] too much
[1:50:30] oh come on church you know one of the I
[1:50:38] mean Jesus thought the church was too
[1:50:40] big in his day he had a mega church
[1:50:42] three thousand five thousand one time
[1:50:46] come and have some fish and loaves and
[1:50:48] he had it that was a mega church not
[1:50:50] counting children but now in today's
[1:50:53] congregations you have to count the kids
[1:50:55] to tell them how to hit people
[1:50:56] I'm just I'm just joking but but but but
[1:51:00] but but in Jesus day is five thousand
[1:51:02] repent then later on four thousand more
[1:51:04] that he sent same thing fish and loaves
[1:51:07] fed them and he had this mega church but
[1:51:09] then he gave a message that shut the
[1:51:11] church down
[1:51:12] Oh Lord gee
[1:51:16] he stood the church down unless you eat
[1:51:18] my flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:51:20] part with me all of a sudden felt they
[1:51:23] are we told y'all name was a
[1:51:25] cannibal we should have been following
[1:51:27] him in the first place we told y'all
[1:51:29] let's going back to our old churches and
[1:51:30] Jesus was dead at the Doheny watch
[1:51:32] tomorrow walked out and shook their hand

[1:51:36] you God bless you God bless you enjoyed
[1:51:39] having you thank you for coming god

[1:51:48] well 82 in the church 70 left twelve
[1:51:53] state and he went back in the church you
[1:51:55] say now a question will you also go
[1:52:00] that's a question Peter again Peters our
[1:52:06] only one with an answer the rest are
[1:52:08] like I don't know what you want us to do
[1:52:11] Peter I ain't going nowhere I'm putting
[1:52:13] that I'm putting that in today's terms I
[1:52:15] ain't going away
[1:52:16] peanuts Peter say only you have the
[1:52:17] words of eternal life and insisting on
[1:52:20] the West I don't try them other churches
[1:52:21] I know this message shut me down but I
[1:52:25] ain't going back to the nomination i'ma
[1:52:27] say right yeah Jesus Jesus heard Peter
[1:52:32] his brethren Jesus a blessing about
[1:52:34] simon barjona he'd say at this time
[1:52:35] he said there's still a devil here in
[1:52:38] the midst of this truth well 12 y'all
[1:52:42] want to go still a devil 12 and one must
[1:52:46] not eat ramen forgot who the devil
[1:52:51] questions answers let me keep reading
[1:52:56] Matthew 19 it says verse 23 it said this
[1:53:04] that Jesus is type of barely I sent of
[1:53:06] you that a rich man shall hardly enter
[1:53:08] into the kingdom of heaven and again I
[1:53:11] said you're just easier for a camel to
[1:53:13] go through the eye of a needle than for
[1:53:14] a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[1:53:16] God I didn't say it can be rich y'all
[1:53:19] don't have a problem with being where
[1:53:21] the person have money but just I want
[1:53:22] the money to have the person
[1:53:25] right and and you know that that whole
[1:53:28] thing is entered into the eye of a
[1:53:30] needle that was a gate that was called
[1:53:33] the eye of the needle right and when
[1:53:36] they would come the merchants would come
[1:53:37] to this gate they get there late in the
[1:53:39] day and you know so they couldn't sell
[1:53:42] that but they want to be ready for the
[1:53:44] next day and if you've got there to the
[1:53:45] city wanting to go to the city and find
[1:53:47] somewhere to stay you have to get your
[1:53:49] camel unload all the merchandise take it
[1:53:52] off the camel and then you have to have
[1:53:54] the camel get down on his knees because
[1:53:56] it couldn't just walk through the gate
[1:53:57] right the gate was closed so he has
[1:54:00] special gate that he can go through but
[1:54:01] he had to get down on his knees humble
[1:54:03] himself get everything unloaded from him
[1:54:06] then he walks through the gate on his
[1:54:07] knees and most people don't want to do
[1:54:11] it on their knees all right let me get
[1:54:19] back to this let me go to this this
[1:54:22] message is true and false bond I want to
[1:54:24] just bring a couple more questions and
[1:54:26] answers to you and we'll see what the
[1:54:28] Lord takes it true and false fires the
[1:54:32] Prophet says this now there was two boys
[1:54:36] says we'll start with Adam and Eve was
[1:54:38] pure God made Adam out of the dust of
[1:54:40] the earth taken from his side a rib and
[1:54:43] made a woman and she sinned
[1:54:45] brought Adam into it they both sin then
[1:54:49] God throw them out they had two children
[1:54:51] one was Cain one was able if I was going
[1:54:54] to speak here next week there's one
[1:54:56] subject that I like to speak on three
[1:54:58] questions of God where art thou what is
[1:55:03] this thou has done and where's my
[1:55:05] brother
[1:55:06] yeah I got three questions where art
[1:55:10] thou he spoke to Adam what if this guy
[1:55:14] has done he spoke to Eve where's my
[1:55:18] brother
[1:55:18] he spoke to King three questions that
[1:55:21] God acts think of it now I just I just
[1:55:23] wrote this here so we often ask
[1:55:25] questions of God and we typically expect
[1:55:28] to receive answers however when God asks
[1:55:31] us questions we're trying to avoid
[1:55:34] giving him the answer
[1:55:37] and I told you early when God asks a
[1:55:39] question he already know the answer you
[1:55:42] can take that one down he already knows
[1:55:43] the answer right so when the X when he's
[1:55:46] in the Garden of Eden and Adam has stand
[1:55:48] and you know he's joined even the sin
[1:55:50] there in Genesis 3
[1:55:52] here he comes down and you know he's
[1:55:55] he's a God would come down in the cooler
[1:55:57] even all the time and they would have
[1:55:58] Church he would come down they would
[1:56:00] they would have services and worshiping
[1:56:03] you know he'd just be just just enjoying
[1:56:04] the presence of his creation and I'm so
[1:56:07] this one day God shows up the church but
[1:56:09] Adam and Eve don't show him the Bible
[1:56:11] say that they heard the voice of God
[1:56:13] walking through the garden and when they
[1:56:15] heard God coming they took off the hot
[1:56:18] to go try to find some thick leaves and
[1:56:20] cover themselves now here you know when
[1:56:22] God that churchy like um I'm hearing
[1:56:25] search by myself I only created someone
[1:56:27] to people create it they supposed to be
[1:56:29] in church we're out of it so he just
[1:56:31] start yelling Adam kind of where art
[1:56:33] thou question Adam response thing on
[1:56:36] where we heard you coming and we you
[1:56:40] know we realize we was naked and we you
[1:56:43] know put this on the come here to church
[1:56:45] God said now here's a question who told
[1:56:49] you you were naked and he asks him
[1:56:53] another question
[1:56:54] did you eat of that tree that I told you
[1:56:57] not to eat from now he only answered one
[1:56:59] question and he didn't answer it
[1:57:00] directly Oh God see when he asked his
[1:57:04] question he interface he didn't tell him
[1:57:06] who told him he was naked but the part
[1:57:08] that he did answer he said this woman
[1:57:10] that you gave me she gave of me the tree
[1:57:13] and I ate now that's not that's not
[1:57:15] answer the question that's not answering
[1:57:17] the question so but he still let him go
[1:57:19] right on cuz God always got a plan his
[1:57:21] plan of redemption was that work but but
[1:57:22] here you know he he still goes why don't
[1:57:24] say not not so he just even looked at
[1:57:26] each day now and I could have imagined
[1:57:28] II just trembling just shaking can't
[1:57:30] believe Adam just put this on me like
[1:57:32] this you gonna leave me all out there by
[1:57:33] myself and they look at Eve and the
[1:57:39] first thing out of his mouth what is
[1:57:42] this thou has done Eve don't know what
[1:57:46] to say to the question she don't even
[1:57:48] answer these
[1:57:49] notice what her answer is say the
[1:57:51] serpent beguiled me and trick me and I
[1:57:54] ate of the fruit the next day come up
[1:57:58] into serpent he didn't even give a
[1:58:01] chance no questions asked
[1:58:04] to the serpent he was just cursed and
[1:58:06] put on his belly but if you notice the
[1:58:10] scripture they never answered God's
[1:58:12] questions now God knew if the God knew
[1:58:14] that God knew exactly where Adam was he
[1:58:17] knew he knew that they ate of that tree
[1:58:19] he knew everything that already happened
[1:58:21] in that guard that's why they were
[1:58:22] acting the way that they were acting
[1:58:23] because they thought something wrong God
[1:58:26] had the answer to his own questions he
[1:58:29] was waiting for them to repent that's
[1:58:31] how you want it just repent and come to
[1:58:33] me it will make this thing right they'd
[1:58:36] never even expected even know what they
[1:58:37] never even used the word sorry before
[1:58:42] that was a new vocabulary word I'm sorry
[1:58:47] you only say sorry after you've done
[1:58:49] something wrong imagine that question
[1:58:56] answers well their sons are born with
[1:58:59] the same old bad nature now and here
[1:59:02] comes Kane alone and God got a question
[1:59:04] for King these boys grow up they worship
[1:59:07] and they know they know how to praise
[1:59:08] God in art do all kind of things and
[1:59:09] they're bringing their fruit I'm in
[1:59:11] Cain's bringing this fruit and Abel's
[1:59:13] bringing his lamb and they coming both
[1:59:14] to worship God well Cain got jealous of
[1:59:17] Abel's offering because God accepted
[1:59:19] Abel's offering but did not accept
[1:59:21] Cain's offering when he accepted say he
[1:59:22] said I'm upset with this boy got so mad
[1:59:25] God came to him saying ìlook if you just
[1:59:27] giving the same thing your brother gave
[1:59:28] me I will accept it but you know it was
[1:59:30] not in came to give God that type of
[1:59:32] offering so resident Cain give God's
[1:59:37] offering Cain killed the man that was
[1:59:40] making the armor and God had a question
[1:59:45] King where's your brother that's the
[1:59:49] question
[1:59:50] guess what his answer was it was not an
[1:59:53] answer he answered with a question he
[1:59:56] said am I my brother's keeper
[1:59:58] yes you are and it says a brother's
[2:00:01] blood is calling out to me from out
[2:00:03] I know exactly what you've done you have
[2:00:05] killed your brother without a cause see
[2:00:13] God expects an answer when it gives us a
[2:00:15] question all the way back in the Garden
[2:00:20] of Eden you can see that these questions
[2:00:22] and answers was given I picked it up
[2:00:24] even in the New Testament but there was
[2:00:26] a Griffin that was he was asked the
[2:00:30] question there was an accusing Paul of
[2:00:35] wrong doings because Paul believed in
[2:00:37] the Lord Jesus that he had risen from
[2:00:38] the dead and Paul begin to share his
[2:00:40] testimony with Festus and Agrippa and as
[2:00:43] these were shared his testimony King
[2:00:45] Agrippa he's like me I think Agrippa
[2:00:47] believe what I'm saying I think he acts
[2:00:49] believing what I'm saying
[2:00:50] Oh God I like this I won't try to pull
[2:00:53] this one up acts 26 verse 27 and that's
[2:00:57] Paul was Paul was just kind of going
[2:00:58] through you know his his his his
[2:01:00] conversion experience on the road to
[2:01:02] Damascus and everything that happened
[2:01:04] he's just sharing his testimony now I'm
[2:01:06] sure not to declare the whole council
[2:01:08] about I'm telling you everything that
[2:01:09] happened Paul just speaking it and as he
[2:01:12] gets there he says I don't think a grip
[2:01:14] of my belief in this and he put Agrippa
[2:01:16] on the spot the accidental question King
[2:01:20] Agrippa believed it found the prophets
[2:01:26] believe it's down the prophets I know
[2:01:29] that they'll believe it now I like the
[2:01:31] way he did because the day I can access
[2:01:34] paying question y'all still believe the
[2:01:36] Prophet because because people have a
[2:01:41] problem with the Prophet now we don't
[2:01:42] want to quote the Prophet anymore right
[2:01:44] I mean but but I want to ask you Agrippa
[2:01:46] believe it's down to prophets huh
[2:01:51] believe it's out of prophets I know that
[2:01:53] thou believers then Agrippa said in
[2:01:55] Nepal almost I persuaded me to be a
[2:01:58] Christian wait a minute he did not
[2:01:59] answer the question the question was do
[2:02:02] you believe the prophets today you're
[2:02:07] gonna have to be able to give an answer
[2:02:08] to questions
[2:02:11] the Jews did not answer
[2:02:14] pilots question Matthew 27-23 just get
[2:02:19] that ready for me here they brought
[2:02:22] Jesus before Pilate listen you know we
[2:02:24] want this man to be crucified me ask
[2:02:26] them you know they said look it's this
[2:02:28] Passover season we always have a custom
[2:02:31] that we would release one of the
[2:02:32] prisoners to - you say not which
[2:02:34] prisoners do you want we got we got but
[2:02:36] Barabbas here we got him or you got
[2:02:38] Jesus which one do you want which one of
[2:02:40] you and I did together give us Barabbas
[2:02:42] a man that was a proven murderer we want
[2:02:47] Barabbas well as they took they took
[2:02:51] Barabbas there now what should I do with
[2:02:52] this Jesus what should I do they say
[2:02:54] crucify him crucify him crucify Jesus
[2:02:56] never done anything wrong but crucify
[2:02:58] him anyway where they actually
[2:02:59] questioned Matthew 27 23 Pilate asks a
[2:03:02] question the Bible said the governor
[2:03:05] said why when they yell that crucify me
[2:03:08] said why this is this question Why What
[2:03:10] evil has he done
[2:03:12] that's the question they never gave an
[2:03:15] answer but they cried out the more say
[2:03:17] and let him be crucified when God gives
[2:03:22] a question he's expecting an answer and
[2:03:26] oftentimes when you know what we're
[2:03:28] doing is trying to avoid the the answer
[2:03:31] right here a question was given by
[2:03:33] Pilate to the people of God but they
[2:03:35] avoided the answer what evil happy done
[2:03:38] not one person could stand up with an
[2:03:41] ass then tell us what evil Jesus had
[2:03:43] done but yet he died because God had a
[2:03:47] purpose and all things are working
[2:03:48] together for good to them that love God
[2:03:51] to him them who are the called according
[2:03:52] to his purpose let me also just state
[2:03:57] this and I'm getting ready to wind this
[2:03:59] up when we ask in God a question because
[2:04:04] we want an answer we need to understand
[2:04:07] that we got to come to God with the
[2:04:08] right approach or we're not going to get
[2:04:11] an answer
[2:04:17] I like this this is Matthew 22 42
[2:04:23] through 46
[2:04:25] these men the Pharisees Sadducees of
[2:04:29] that day they approaching the Lord Jesus
[2:04:30] they got all kind of questions and he he
[2:04:34] finally you know he gives them a answer
[2:04:37] that again they don't like it and he
[2:04:40] asked something sometimes you answer a
[2:04:42] question with a question
[2:04:43] that's just to shake the devil I want a
[2:04:46] Matthew Matthew 22 we're gonna we're
[2:04:49] going to read this one and then I got
[2:04:51] something else I want to read Oh my
[2:04:54] questions and answers glory to God
[2:04:58] Matthew 22 and I'm picking up verse 42
[2:05:02] here in a second
[2:05:05] glory to God today right right before
[2:05:07] this they were asking them a question
[2:05:11] and tempting him asked him which you
[2:05:14] know which is the greatest commandment
[2:05:15] of law alright he was you know let's
[2:05:18] start at verse 34 let's pick up there
[2:05:20] these were where they were they were
[2:05:23] they were coming but you got to come
[2:05:24] with the right approach you just don't
[2:05:25] approach God any kind of weight if you
[2:05:27] want an answer to your question listen
[2:05:30] said but when the Pharisees that heard
[2:05:32] that they had put the Sadducees to
[2:05:35] silence they would gather together then
[2:05:37] one of them then one of them which was
[2:05:41] the lawyer asked him a question tempting
[2:05:42] understand master which is the Great
[2:05:44] Commandment in the law see the seven ham
[2:05:47] though shalt love the Lord thy God with
[2:05:49] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[2:05:51] with all thy mind this is the first and
[2:05:54] Great Commandment and the second is like
[2:05:55] unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[2:05:57] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[2:06:00] all the law and the prophets time here
[2:06:02] they thought they had done something
[2:06:04] because they heard the Sadducees to ask
[2:06:07] the question and Jesus put them to
[2:06:08] silence but 90 specially thought now
[2:06:11] we're going to show who we are but Jesus
[2:06:13] had a question for them look at it verse
[2:06:15] 41 says while the Pharisees were
[2:06:17] gathered together Jesus asked them
[2:06:19] saying what think ye of Christ whose son
[2:06:24] is he he wants an answer that's what
[2:06:29] they gave it to him
[2:06:29] the
[2:06:30] they say then the son of David and he 7
[2:06:35] them how then duck David in spirit call
[2:06:38] him Lord saying the Lord said unto my
[2:06:42] lord sit down my right hand till I make
[2:06:45] thine enemies thy footstool mind taking
[2:06:47] right back to scripture look said if
[2:06:49] David called him Lord how is he his son
[2:06:55] you got a question and unfortunate
[2:06:58] things they have no answer
[2:07:01] look at verse 46 and no man was able to
[2:07:05] answer him a word neither Durst any man
[2:07:08] from that day forth asked him any more
[2:07:11] questions
[2:07:16] but Jesus know how to put them right in
[2:07:18] my place and I want to tell you let me
[2:07:21] just first of all imitate it the reason
[2:07:23] that Jesus said that is because even
[2:07:25] though that he was broke the root and
[2:07:26] the offspring of David he knew that he
[2:07:30] knew exactly who he was so he can ask
[2:07:32] that question knowing that they cannot
[2:07:34] answer it now I want to tell you
[2:07:36] something because you know when I
[2:07:37] actually early you know I threw that a
[2:07:39] grip description there do you believe
[2:07:41] the process right we know we believe a
[2:07:43] prophet not people ask you questions but
[2:07:46] can I tell you something what the Bible
[2:07:48] say the Bible actually tells you to
[2:07:50] avoid foolish questions
[2:07:55] how you do that don't go to their
[2:07:57] websites bypass them huh people sending
[2:08:00] you crazy emails just don't respond to
[2:08:02] avoid foolish questions you find that in
[2:08:06] the book of Titus right so you know so I
[2:08:09] mean you know I was you know
[2:08:10] unfortunately you hear people that's
[2:08:12] just kind of you know doing all kind of
[2:08:13] things when it comes to this message and
[2:08:15] one one brother I feel so sorry for him
[2:08:18] but he made a comment that really
[2:08:19] blessed me because he's actually pulling
[2:08:20] away from the message but he made a
[2:08:22] comment before he pulled away that
[2:08:23] blessed me and the comment was you know
[2:08:26] that I dated and Cora rose up against
[2:08:29] the prophet Moses and the earth
[2:08:31] swallowed them he says and everybody
[2:08:36] today that's rising up against the gods
[2:08:38] proper today the world is swallowing
[2:08:41] death he made that point and then walked
[2:08:47] away I said Wow you know and I mean I
[2:08:51] let me even looked at the way the earth
[2:08:53] swallows the date of the course and now
[2:08:55] the world is swallowing those days
[2:08:57] walking with everybody that I've seen
[2:08:59] denounce this message in the right back
[2:09:02] in the world
[2:09:03] they can't even live holiness Katie to
[2:09:06] thank holiness this this this this
[2:09:10] adultery the truth is the only thing
[2:09:12] that can keep you but they get swallowed
[2:09:19] by the world
[2:09:20] you name it you just watch everybody
[2:09:22] that come out and make they make anytime
[2:09:24] you make it a proclamation you know it's
[2:09:26] the wrong spirit I'm gonna just say this
[2:09:30] you know homosexuals have to announce
[2:09:32] when they coming out the closet but
[2:09:36] ain't nobody got no announcement it's a
[2:09:39] boy it's a girl but when a boy trying to
[2:09:41] become a girl or a girl trying become a
[2:09:43] boy they have to make an announcement so
[2:09:47] you already know that's a rebellious
[2:09:48] spirit they soon I got to come out and
[2:09:51] say that I don't believe this no more no
[2:09:54] no that's a rebellious spirit start
[2:09:56] praying immediately do you Grippit do
[2:09:59] you believe the prophets
[2:10:03] Titus 3:9 will avoid foolish questions
[2:10:06] and genealogies and contentions and
[2:10:09] strivings about the law for they are
[2:10:11] unprofitable and vain so there's some
[2:10:14] questions that you should avoid when
[2:10:15] these Pharisees and Sadducees came to
[2:10:17] Jesus with these foolish questions he
[2:10:20] avoided them by throwing them a question
[2:10:22] that they couldn't answer and the Bible
[2:10:24] say no man asked them any more questions
[2:10:28] i'ma tell you haven't try helping people
[2:10:31] come out of some of the things with
[2:10:34] their questions that they get off the
[2:10:35] internet cuz mm and here's another one
[2:10:37] when everybody come tell you I've had
[2:10:39] these questions for so many years you
[2:10:42] already know that's that's rehearsed
[2:10:45] that's practice because everybody's
[2:10:47] saying the same thing and if you had no
[2:10:50] questions how come it's the first time
[2:10:51] I'm hearing about it
[2:10:55] you had these questions you got anointed
[2:10:57] by spirits that's all that happened and
[2:11:00] we're praying for you glory to God you
[2:11:02] didn't have these questions you got
[2:11:03] anointed by spirit now you got questions
[2:11:05] and what I found is that when you give
[2:11:07] them answers data and want the answer
[2:11:09] the reason they want answer because they
[2:11:11] want it to go to the world oh my god
[2:11:16] those look at the post I mean the the
[2:11:20] drinking and the everything else that's
[2:11:22] going on like the way they dress look at
[2:11:24] it you already know they swallowed up
[2:11:26] out of world well that's nothing new
[2:11:30] that happened to dated in chorus but not
[2:11:34] Nathan's children all right they escaped
[2:11:39] that all right you got approach got the
[2:11:42] right way because if you don't approach
[2:11:44] got the right way you will never get an
[2:11:46] answer to your question so it's the same
[2:11:47] way that people approach the website
[2:11:49] they're not approaching God the right
[2:11:50] way that's why they're not getting
[2:11:51] answer to the questions they not looking
[2:11:53] for an answer
[2:11:54] all right so it's my last cool brother
[2:12:01] branham Acts got he didn't ask God he
[2:12:07] really have a question they had a demand
[2:12:13] that didn't work and I'm gonna read it
[2:12:19] for you but brother Brando had a demand
[2:12:21] oh god me
[2:12:22] it's Oh God you owe me an explanation
[2:12:26] prophet said that that God God pretty
[2:12:30] much looked at the Prophet and say oh
[2:12:31] you what I owe you nothing and you don't
[2:12:36] approach me that way he had to put the
[2:12:39] Prophet back in his place and when he
[2:12:41] repented then God showed him something
[2:12:45] and when you repent God to show you
[2:12:48] something
[2:12:52] so we don't glorify the Prophet cuz he
[2:12:55] was just like us but I tell you what I
[2:12:57] thank God for how God used the man we
[2:13:00] glorify Christ let me just read this
[2:13:03] number I'm a close God doesn't call a
[2:13:05] man to judgment without first warning
[2:13:08] him look at this this that's this quote
[2:13:15] rather lengthy but I think he'd be a
[2:13:17] blessing to us there's one day I come on
[2:13:21] about four years ago or five something
[2:13:24] like that and this young girl which was
[2:13:26] about eight years old when she was on
[2:13:29] the crater roll she had been married and
[2:13:32] had two children and she was laying out
[2:13:34] the hospital here at the point of death
[2:13:36] she was about four months five with a
[2:13:38] baby and the baby it died and they
[2:13:40] couldn't operate because she had uremic
[2:13:42] and they couldn't operate so had to let
[2:13:46] they had to let the mother die to can't
[2:13:49] operate and see the baby would kill her
[2:13:52] like that so they she was just dying I
[2:13:54] saw it wasn't no chance for her I went
[2:13:57] out to see her she had said to me and I
[2:14:00] went into the hospital and there she was
[2:14:01] under oxygen tent I raised up that
[2:14:04] little flat talked to her a little bit
[2:14:05] and I said you remember me she said sure
[2:14:08] brother bill I remember you I said how
[2:14:10] do you understand how sick you are she
[2:14:13] said I do say that's why I said for you
[2:14:15] I said well why how is it with you and
[2:14:19] the Lord
[2:14:20] she said brother bill I'm not ready to
[2:14:22] go
[2:14:24] well they there we got down and praying
[2:14:27] the mother and a husband many of them in
[2:14:28] the room and a mother and husband
[2:14:30] started crying and I asked her if she
[2:14:33] got right with God paid her vows and
[2:14:35] come back and make God the promise that
[2:14:37] if she'd be forgiven how she loved him
[2:14:40] and sorry for her sins the way she lived
[2:14:42] and went on with her repentance of crime
[2:14:44] after a while I got up and went out of
[2:14:46] the building the next one they called me
[2:14:49] up to come back out there and come to
[2:14:51] find out they come in that morning for
[2:14:53] tests to see how the euralia condition
[2:14:55] had advanced and found out she didn't
[2:14:57] have a speck of it it was all gone every
[2:15:00] bit of do you remake poison had left her
[2:15:02] the doctors were so excited too they
[2:15:04] said my why this we are it's something
[2:15:07] very strange well we'll get it ready and
[2:15:09] if it's still that way by in the morning
[2:15:12] said we'll keep giving her penicillin or
[2:15:14] whatever they was giving her keeping the
[2:15:16] infections down so that will operate and
[2:15:18] take the dead baby before before it
[2:15:19] before it's set and something else that
[2:15:21] if she's all right then well two or
[2:15:24] three times that day they tested her

[2:17:48] normal and within five minutes she was

[2:17:57] brother Graham preached the girls
[2:17:58] funeral when I come back home and me too
[2:18:00] told me that that girl died that night
[2:18:01] my I couldn't I went to see mother yeah
[2:18:04] I don't know what caused me to do it but
[2:18:07] I said Lord God you old me and
[2:18:11] understand see after after me going out
[2:18:14] there and telling that husband and him
[2:18:16] coming to the Lord after you've done
[2:18:18] these things for him and all like that
[2:18:19] and then take that girl's life like that
[2:18:21] I said you owe me an understanding you
[2:18:24] got to watch the way you approach God
[2:18:28] when you tell God something like that
[2:18:30] he'll leave you sitting alone he don't
[2:18:33] owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well
[2:18:37] he just let me pound it out for a few
[2:18:39] days you know and after about three or
[2:18:41] four months one day I was I was out on a
[2:18:43] creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a
[2:18:45] vision said now go to her mother and say
[2:18:48] this to her mother did not her time
[2:18:51] come the year before that when she was
[2:18:53] drowning in a creek on a picnic she
[2:18:56] should have went at that time but I had
[2:18:59] to take her when she was ready to go and
[2:19:01] that's why all this happened
[2:19:03] and why you went out there then I got
[2:19:07] down and cried I said Lord Jesus forgive
[2:19:11] me you put your poor stupid servant I
[2:19:14] should have never said that Lord and I
[2:19:19] went back down to the lady she lived
[2:19:21] over here over here on Market Street and
[2:19:23] when I went over to her and I said I
[2:19:26] want to ask you a question
[2:19:28] she says sure brother bill so is it true
[2:19:32] that this girl almost drowned
[2:19:34] she said that's right brother branham
[2:19:36] said her husband and they had to get her
[2:19:38] out of the creek and said they had to
[2:19:40] use artificial respiration upon pressure
[2:19:43] and they they had to get a machine and
[2:19:47] pump the water out of her said she had
[2:19:49] her skirt on they was having a picnic
[2:19:51] she was out there stepped in some sand
[2:19:54] slipped off over here slipped off
[2:19:56] overhead and sprinkled in the water they
[2:19:58] didn't notice her and directly they seen
[2:20:00] her coming up and going down and he run
[2:20:02] in and got her and brought her out and
[2:20:03] said she almost died said I said that
[2:20:06] was her time to go see God knows what
[2:20:10] he's doing now the Lord probably would
[2:20:12] have told me that if I hadn't taken that
[2:20:15] attitude that I did Lord you told me to
[2:20:19] tell me about that he don't owe you
[2:20:21] nothing still in the meeting one night
[2:20:30] and heard evangels praying for a sick
[2:20:32] person said God I command you to heal
[2:20:37] this person who command God see it isn't
[2:20:41] even intelligent because that's God he
[2:20:46] does when he wants to can the clay sink
[2:20:50] to the potter why did you make me thus
[2:20:51] see certainly not but if the prophet
[2:20:54] will keep still and then seek the Lord
[2:20:56] for the answer there's the answer there
[2:20:59] see just just like on this person was
[2:21:04] asking the search
[2:21:05] big questions he just watched don't be
[2:21:07] in a big hurry then how God always
[2:21:10] brings it to pass to work together for
[2:21:11] for good to them that love the Lord I
[2:21:15] tell you I thank God for that
[2:21:17] I was just listening to marriage and
[2:21:20] divorce this weekend there is a
[2:21:21] statement on their brother Brandon was
[2:21:23] talking about this man that was asking a
[2:21:26] question about the surplus feed and he
[2:21:28] said you know if you stand that the
[2:21:32] original sin was adultery between Eve
[2:21:34] and the serpent then where's that animal
[2:21:37] he asks the Prophet where's that animal
[2:21:39] the brother branham just began to talk
[2:21:41] to us like oh brother maybe it is that
[2:21:43] the animal is extinct you know maybe it
[2:21:45] is possible that the animal is extinct
[2:21:47] that's probably you know why we don't
[2:21:49] know where it is but we know it stood on
[2:21:51] two feet back at the beginning but if
[2:21:52] you know he's like no brother branham if
[2:21:55] that was the original sin that that
[2:21:57] animals got the video today where is the
[2:21:59] animal it just kept going say I know he
[2:22:01] was asking the question he wanted that
[2:22:03] hold the spirit told the prophets they
[2:22:05] tell them is here relevance I don't even
[2:22:08] know how to tell them I know how to
[2:22:10] answer the question so I just told them
[2:22:11] by by inspiration see it's here and say
[2:22:15] it's here well where is it they say it
[2:22:17] was cursed and put on this belly so that
[2:22:19] that snake that you see running on his
[2:22:21] belly
[2:22:22] that's the serpent that was here at the
[2:22:24] beginning that was the answer to the
[2:22:26] man's question tell you what if we
[2:22:28] approach God the right way we'll always
[2:22:30] get an answer to that question but make
[2:22:33] sure you approaching him the right way
[2:22:35] the Prophet just approached him the
[2:22:37] wrong way but when God when he finally
[2:22:40] got calmed down and God can show him
[2:22:41] something then they saw that latest time
[2:22:43] that come a year before she passed
[2:22:46] sometimes we want to know about
[2:22:48] different things God has an answer to
[2:22:50] the question but get your heart right
[2:22:52] where you can hear God's answer
[2:22:54] sometimes you hear the answer you don't
[2:22:56] want to hear it but it's still a correct
[2:22:59] answer you have to accept it questions
[2:23:04] answers god bless you
[2:23:08] [Applause]
[2:23:15] savvy musicians come while we just bow
[2:23:18] our head in the word of Prayer does
[2:23:19] Solomon also if you could come I'll just
[2:23:21] turn the service over to You Father
[2:23:23] we're grateful for the word of the Lord
[2:23:29] thank you God for truth that just
[2:23:31] because our hearts the Bible tells us
[2:23:32] that we will know the truth and the
[2:23:34] truth will make us free sometimes we
[2:23:38] have questions that we just don't
[2:23:43] understand we don't we don't we don't
[2:23:46] know what the answer is but God you
[2:23:49] always have the answer and if we could
[2:23:51] just learn to yield to you then we will
[2:23:56] we will see God what your purpose of
[2:23:59] antennas
[2:24:00] things are working together for good god
[2:24:05] that's what your word tells us and if
[2:24:08] it's true so help us God to extend even
[2:24:13] when it's going against our favor
[2:24:15] help us to accept that you're it's
[2:24:18] working together for good so we pray
[2:24:20] Lord Jesus if there's any questions in
[2:24:25] here today that you would bring the
[2:24:27] answer sometimes I wonder why we had to
[2:24:30] go through this and why we have to go
[2:24:31] through that God you know you know the
[2:24:32] reason why for everything and you never
[2:24:35] make a mistake but also help us to
[2:24:38] realize that when Satan is fighting us

[2:24:42] planting so all we got to do is keep
