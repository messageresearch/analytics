people a man and he's touching her body we just appreciate the Lord earlier this week I was just kind of reflecting a man in my mind you know sometimes you sit back and you think about how good God been to you a man and one summer I said you can't tell it let me tell you what the Lord has done for me and you know as I would just begin to go back in my mind this song came to me there's a couple of songs that came to me this first song I don't want you all to play on this for maybe just just a base on the drum that's it that would be it but but this first song I was growing up I grew up grew up Baptist a man I grew up in the Baptist Church that that was uh that best investment roots that's where I first learned about the Lord Jesus and you know we got introduced to Pentecost some years later through my grandmother a man but uh but when we were back this song said won't it be Graham won't it be grand oh want it be Graham won't it be grand I'm going home to live with Jesus won't it be grand hmm I said won't it be Graham yeah won't it be better hey see I'm going home yeah won't it be great oh they used to say you can talk about me just as much as you please hey the more you see I'm going home yeah live yes I am gonna pee oh you can talk about me just as much as you please you see the more you talk I'm gonna stay on my knee hey I'm going home yeah won't it be great Oh hallelujah good man I just began to think about that and think about seeing some of my loved ones over on the other side and man it just I said yeah it's gonna be grand a good old good old good time if I'm looking forward to it man sometimes you just take journeys like that and you you know God just beginning to show you how far he's brought you hey man you just said you just appreciate what the Lord has done man it gave me the soul Pentecostal song a man and and I was just I was singing it all weekend and I don't this one I think that we just heard this might have heard it last week while we were there in Ocala but it's just something that you know just been been blessing me I've seen in a Baptist Church you know you get a strong like that and that just man that just move on the inside you know the inside and just just really cause you to really think about you know the words you know what you're saying but the Pentecostal church it was more man you it made you want to shout right I mean when I'm song this is a team to get some and it'll make you want to want to move a little stuff something and ain't no wrong with that you know we just love the law you know and and ain't none Roma praise them because he's worthy you know he's worthy to be praised I say what do you want the Lord to say [Applause] [Music] Walter a papal survey and it's an in the chair of the Lord come up

chain of the right Oh glory to God tell somebody I want to hear him say well done I want to hear him say well done glory to God a man a man yeah we were having having having prayer and brother Kenny solders they say you know it's not good enough just to be good right you know we you know sometimes we happy with just being good but they say no you want to mm say well done by good and faithful faithful servant is not good enough just to be good you need to be good and faithful kept most somebody it is it's gonna take that to be good and faithful what we're to go I mean you know what faithfulness look like hey man but we want we want to be faithful in serving God especially in an hour like this a man the Prophet said we don't want to get our lines tangled up in times like these a man it's too late in the game to get your lines tangled up if you ever gone fishing on the drift boat they've got a lot of you know people dropping a lines in the water and sometimes if a person don't really know what they doing a man they can him to you right they can him to you as you don't drop down you know next to them and they done did something all those sitting at everybody down the boat lines all tangled up and you just miss the fish just laughing at everybody right you don't want to be like that I mean a real fisherman they see something like that they start hitting tells another side of the boat cuz they don't want to be somewhere where the line is gonna get tangled up praise the Lord we don't want none of that not not and I'm not lying it's too late for the lines to get tangled up keep it straight keep it straight it's important it's necessary if we're gonna catch some fish hey man so praise the Lord I just I just appreciate what musicians take out so much god bless you man I was listening to y'all I don't know I think that's something that brother Solomon singing and I am y'all had look dun dun dun dun and something y'all was doing an answer man that's alright they even got them a little something they don't find and they hold it on to it I said that's good sound sound real good man we thank the Lord a man for keeping us while we were way less weekend in Ocala we had a wonderful time there with the believers brother Joe's a man a church family of God Tabernacle we had a his birthday was a real blessing and then a real night they did a great job surprising him and and then on top of that the service that we had just you know just really enjoy the presence of the Lord yesterday we went up to st. Augustine celebrating brother Browns 90th birthday and also him and sister Browns 60th wedding anniversary again tremendous time we had there when brother Ron Spencer came from Virginia and he preached and man on commitment a real nice thought on commitment and man we just we just enjoyed ourselves you know enough so it's good to be back home and some of the sings with acid brother Jackie y'all stands - no we ain't stand we got to get back home and I was looking forward to coming back for this 15 years celebration amen God has been good and then God has been good and and and and we're extremely you know just grateful for what the Lord amen is done I got a chance to listen to brother Joel a man and man I was just texting him say brother the Lord used you to speak to our church and so so much was said a man and making preparation I say Lord and and I told him that when you when you start talking about boys to me and I said no you don't want there's somebody living room you know are you talking real good right now you know but they say they stay boys you know and you know a little bit Bobby Brown and all that acid man you know you you are you you you in there now you know you know touch something but but you know just a real real good thought and I'm just so happy to see him you know just relax himself and express a man himself you know to the people the Lord and I believe if if you didn't really get it go back and listen to it again because there was a lot being said a man in that sermon and I just I felt like you know all of us were hearing directly from God amen sometimes when you're praying you're asking God to speak to you about certain things it'll send a minister up here with what's in your heart and they'll speak that right it's up to you to actually listen sometimes we tune it out if that's not what we want to hear man glory to God God don't always speak what you want to hear amen but he'll speak what you need all right he will speak what your knees so you know be open to hear the voice of God as it comes a man through ministry and as it comes through just even others that God has placed in your life be open to hear his voice amen I what I want to do is read a scripture and we will prepare for our thought today it man it's just so good to have everyone in the house of the Lord a man this morning I'm gonna read from a John 15 we're gonna just read a couple scriptures and then what the Lord's kind of placed in my heart I want to just line up a couple of things and then I want to kind of go into since we're celebrating 15 years in ministry I want to go into a man maybe a more personal testimony a man as to how spirit and truth became its spirit and truth a man some of you may know that some may not know it so a man I'd like to just kind of share personal testimony regarding that Amen on today and since we're celebrating these 15 years we want to remember sister wisdom and prayer amen brother wisdom reached out and said that she got sick just did not rest well last night and they just you know decide to stay home today you know trusting that the world would touch her body and that she'll recover and so we want to remember her in prayer and a man and you know we'll go from there also there's others that we don't see this morning we'll also remember them in prayer too amen on the day but turn with me to John 15 and I found this very appropriate because we're celebrating 15 years a man so John 15 a man for these 15 years of ministry it says this in verse 1 says I am The True Vine and my father is the husband man verse 2 says in every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it he purchased it that it may bring forth more fruit now I need you to understand that the purging process is when the tree is actually being cut right it's being cuts being trimmed and the purpose of that trimming is so that they could bring forth more fruit a man glory to God there's a season where you have to go through some trimming some cutting and your life but that's so that you can bring forth more fruit amen stay with me here now you clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast him into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask you will and it shall be done unto you a man the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a word of Prayer today father we are thankful for the opportunity to read your word we know it takes the Holy Spirit to make this thing clear to us that we've read that it won't just go in one ear and out the other but Lord may you make a difference in our hearts in our lives God we're even praying today that your Holy Spirit would have the preeminence amen and this portion of the service God if you want to come down and feel somebody because the Bible says as Peter yet spake the words the Holy Ghost fell on the people so you want to come down and feel interrupt our thought today God and do exactly what you need to do because we realized that it's only a true experience with you that makes the difference in our hearts and in our lives it's only the true experience that that Lord that gives us power to overcome the enemy without that Lord we are just sounding brass and tinkling cymbals so God give us a true experience with you we want to remember Amen sister wisdom today in prayer not feeling well in her body enemy attacking her God may you bring healing to her also the kids they're her grandkids for sister Tracey's kids we pray that you just touch them as well they're not feeling well so help them God through this little season a man and whatever it is that Satan is putting on them we cursed it now this route and we command it to loose them and let them go other saints not feeling well in their body God that oppressed their way out to the house of Lord today touch them God is our prayer others that are missing today Lord look upon them as well and just administer to their hearts into their knees we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated man for our title you know my thought just kind of will title it you made a way and just again thinking about you know these 15 years a man of ministry all that God could help us through a man these these years only only God could do it I was you know thanking on the scripture a man I believe there in the Book of Luke it might be Luke 17 where there were 10 men that were healed by Jesus they were healed of their blindness and only I think one of them turned around to go back to the Lord Jesus and to thank him for what he had done so any time we reach milestones like this I I feel it would be robbery if I didn't just stop and tell the Lord thank you amen just just just tell the Lord thank you for what he's done a man for so I'm grateful a man for the 15 years the Bible says in Psalms 127 say except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain and I'm so glad to know that it's God that built this house a banner it's god that's watched over this city a man is God that has done and I was looking at a statistic a man on the internet and this that they said how many churches were closed this year and there were two stats that went out and this was back in October of 2013 you know I think that this witness that came out but they said they want one one researcher the Southern Baptist researcher they said anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 churches would close their doors every year right and then another one was a article called 1313 issues for churches and in 2013 and in that article they put the Espen a little higher they said somewhere between 8,000 to 10,000 churches were likely closed this year a man and I and I'm so glad that a man we didn't fit that category hallelujah I'm so glad that we didn't fit that category I'm so glad that God made a way Amen God kept the doors open God did it amen and and and I'm grateful for what the Lord has done a man a man that there's many that can't say that but but God has done a man something for us and he allows us just to kind of keep coming here and you know just to join his presence we're so grateful so grateful for that you know just just recently there was something you know I want to just read a little quote here from this message the angel of the Lord a man the angel the Lord the Prophet made a statement here says now many times in the meeting the angel the Lord which appeared and many of you know about it appears like that night and all down through the time it looks like a big pillar fire about that thick and about that big and it comes in a licking whirling going right that's the way to pillar fire piers it comes in a licking whirling going and you know it says brother branham he imitates the sound of the angel Lord coming to him say thousands times thousands has seen it it's appeared visibly and say here not long ago I was standing there Fort Wayne Indiana and a meeting I was speaking in the audience was very hearty like it was in a theater building and I was trying I said now it's the angel lord I just I just been started and I could see the people looking one to another and you can feel that cold feeling glory to God a man of some of them especially to see they wasn't thinking of that the others that was act in that they wasn't sick right they say the st. man is looking for help you can talk to him a hungry man that's real hungry you can talk to him about foods but but if he's not interested about dinner anymore see well that's it it's the ones that's it needs Lord of God see when we're people not in need they act all counterweights it's hard to give a damn from them when they're not a need huh it's hard to get on the press when they're not in me but we're neat well you can't keep him out the church and what you need to do it just wait for somebody to get in me go I got a way of getting people there Oh hallelujah Amen otherwise you just be wasting a lot of time but just keep praying for him God that God somehow gonna bring that thing around where they gonna need God and they'll be coming right on through the door glory to God alright you said a hungry man that's real hungry you can talk to him about food but it means if he's not interested about dinner anymore see well that's it it's the ones that's the need and maybe some time you'll be in need to so to be different if it was your mother laying here dying or it or is your son or someone it would be different and the doctor said that there was no hope for them it would be different he goes on you know as he was just kind of talking I won't read all of that amen but as he kept going on it was time I had an angel Lord showed up in this meeting a man as he was there and and and foot went Indiana and as he was there in the meeting and he say say everybody a lot of people began to see now notice I say it comes the pillow fire comes in and I wish I would have been there to see him say how thick it was he said about that thick right and it says about that big and it comes in a licking right whirling and going so it's just moving from here to here and move that's how that's not he described the pillow fire that's what we saw in the video right he says it comes a licking a whirling Amen a going glory to God just constantly moving and that's exactly what we saw right so so so here you know the Prophet goes on say now he said when they were at this meeting there a man in in Fort Wayne Indiana you saved some of the people beginning to see the pillar fire and it came so visible that there was a young lady on the on the piano she was playing amen the song the Great Physician now it's near and brother Branham was sitting there he was praying for this little boy and you know now he's praying for the little boy say he eat it he couldn't understand what was going on amen now he say thought the US should turn on the light and he said man that lights so bright why don't the man just turn the light down you know he's steaming up your friendly people and that's what he's thinking is mine this man Stephen praying for these people he's gonna turn that light on the try to distract me he thought it was the devil he said but but as he started noticing he say the light just got brighter and brighter and brighter as I started approach him him he said a young lady on the piano saw the same light and when she starts she jumped up off the piano began to scream and praise God and she took off running the piano kept playing the piano kept playing the Holy Ghost was in control of the service and the piano kept playing never missing a note that's what we're talking about right amen but you know as I as I you know I hear essentially say that young lady sought of the pillar of fire she saw the angel the Lord and many others that night said that that little boy he said when he when he saw an angel come he don't remember whether he dropped the boy I'm not but all he knows that the boy was out his arms and the boy was healed right but when he saw the presence of a God of God it created a response and I'm telling you church ain't man what we saw on video God want to do greater Amen I think he's ready to do greater but we got to keep the Lime Street you gotta keep the lines straight if we're gonna see God do more I'm on expectation a man to see him do more praise the name of the Lord all right so you know as we just kind of look at this a man I I'm just I'm just you know expressing my heart to the Lord he's the one that's made away he's the one that's made away a man now when I look at um you know we talked about 15 years of ministry the Lord just kind of took me you know to a little website that I wanted to look at and and I was just kind of looking at what are some of the expectations of a 15 year old so if a parent was dealing with a fifteen year old what are some of the things you should be expecting amen when you're dealing with that fifteen year old right and you know and one of the things that says that most of them at that age most fifteen year olds are independent right but the majority struggle to recognize their limitations now most of them are already independent and and I'm taking this and I'm putting it in the spiritual room because you know at fifteen your mama ain't gotta feed you no more huh actually if you're independent you already know how to cook for yourself if you're really independent you ain't waiting for mama to come home and put nothing in the pot you already got in the pot you can take care of yourself by the time you're 15 come on somebody Amen yeah I mean you know how to do certain things if there's an expectation of maturity when you reach 15 and if we have that expectation of maturity for a natural child what about the Church of God's Amen there's an expectation of maturity when we reach 15 listen then a 15 year old begins to gain self-confidence they began to desire more freedom hallelujah 15 year old they began they began to gain self-confidence they began to desire more freedom and they said now when this happened this tends to lead to frequent disagreements over the rules I want to read it again when they reach 15 right they begin to get a little bit more self-confidence because they've been well talk now that can tell you what the Bible say I'm gonna say amen to the light they can tell you what the Bible say in 15 they can tell you what the Prophet said at 15 and it's okay to they can do that that's that's what you're trying to get them to but but you understand that 15 you still don't know everything huh right and there's still some things to learn in life but you know here it is they begin to get some self-confidence they begin to desire more freedom and this tends to leave the frequent disagreements over the rules the 15 year olds are starting to challenge why we got certain things in place that's what happens when they get 15 but the eventual they begin to realize amen the rule was there so it could protect you a man it's not say him to you is to protect you come on somebody right and then so you know another thing that happens a man with 15 year olds that said most girls oh by the time they turn 15 they have reached their full height now I didn't mean they didn't say that they wouldn't grow any more say they reached a full or high and there's other ways they can grow right but you got to understand that I mean growth then stop at 15 there's still other ways they made that you can grow and the other thing they said that's that forever for a boy when he reaches 15 he still may have a couple more years where he will grow now oftentimes you know in you know a parent parents are raising children and when they see that boy just kind of hit 15 I love Sonny go through a growth spurt and the clothes you just bought for him I mean you just bought him hundreds of dollars spent and all of a sudden this boy come home overnight something happened to him and the clothes they they what we call higher waters and the board can't go out like that so you back out buying some old clothes and you get you finally get that taken care of and next thing you know overnight that brought two more inches right you won the where this came from but it just shows at 15 they haven't completely stopped growing oh my god my god and I'm here today as a church we reach 50 but we haven't completely stopped your word and we can grow in multiple ways we can grow spiritually by going deeply in the Word of God we can go with members it's multiple ways that we can grow everybody we were just talking about here on Wednesday night you know how the commissioners are going to all the world right we all got a responsibility of carrying the gospel somewhere amen all of us can grow some where a man you might not get any you know as far as when they said up the woman when she has 15 hurts her her height probably stops right there right her height but there's other areas that she can grow she can grow mentally spiritually she can still grow right so so as a church we want to continue to grow don't stop at 15 and then let's keep growing and I understand when we're drawing there will be what we call growing pains i'ma say it again i'ma say it again as we grow there will be growing pains hey man so when you know your start filter man I feel a little pain this change in that changing it's okay it's all for good purpose come on church hey man I one day i'ma tell you I'll go back to that sermon that I preached at our 15th year anniversary all right but I just thank God for these things you know as I I just begin to kind of comb the Scriptures well amen and just kind of find in some scriptures that ended I mean that had the you know the number 15 whether it was the 15th chapter or the 15th verse in a particular book you know in Chapter I just kind of found about 10 of them that I want to share with you genesis 3:15 says I will put enmity a man between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel a man and brother branham tells us clearly since there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was like what was was Christ who came by the instrumentality of God apart from human intercourse it is also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in an actual actuality of prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross there at the cross Christ what bruised the head of Satan while Satan would bruise the heel of the Lord a man genesis 3:15 I also found Exodus 14 and 15 a man it says this and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ I want to me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward I lelou you why cry speech a man I found another one in Joshua 24 and 15 a man who says this and if if see me unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father's served that we're on the other side of the flood or the gods of the mmm aright and whose land he keeps well but asks for me a man in my house we will serve the Lord I love that scripture in John 4:24 and 15 can I go on the First Samuel chapter 30 a man starting at verse 15 look at what happens here and David said to him cast down bring me down to this company and he said swear to me by God that God would neither kill me Lord deliver me into the hands of my master and I will bring thee down to this company verse 16 the winner yet brought him down the hole there they were spread about spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because all the great spoil they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah and David smoked them from a trial life even up to the evening of the next day and their escape not a man of them say four hundred young men which rolled upon camels and Flynn and David I like this part recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away and David rescued his two wives said God brought a restoration to David amen that started in verse 15 I'm looking to God to bring a restoration to us and let it start in the year our fifteenth year can I go in a little further Daniel chapter 3 verse 15 now if he be ready at what time you hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image which I have me well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that car that shall deliver you my hair was a challenge issue in verse 15 but Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we have not cared for the answer via this manner if it be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and we and he will deliver us out of an Han or King but if not I like this be it known unto thee O king that we will not serve thy God's nor worship the golden image which thou has set up so the challenge was issued and the response was given and when those boys say let's let it be written in your books that we not gonna bow later on God showed up and delivered those boys from that fire firs not just showed up heat showing them in the fire hallelujah we invited them to join us in a mr. whatever we're going through I look at a man Luke 15 I won't read it all but I'll just tell you if you read it later on there you see the parable of the lost sheep you all says you also see the parable of the lost coin and you also see the parable of the lost son all found in Luke 15 Alleluia John 4 in 15 it says this amen the woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that our first not neither come hither to draw so this woman at the whale when she met Jesus and then they had a real a real nice connection there and when she met Jesus and and she said she said now you asking me for water and everything don't you know we we not suppose we kind of having this conversation my people don't kind of fellowship with your people you know and so we worship over here y'all worship over there are all this type of division was there he say if you knew who you was talking to you and asked me for some water say the water I give up in a spring up out of y'all out of your out of your out of your bed is solely to spring up to new life say the water I give us something totally different to what you're drawing she said sir I need that kind of water and I wonder how many need that type of water today the water that Jesus has to offer glory to God see John 4 is where we get our church name from it's from that story because he totally says say he say you know you know you talk about worship he'd say but there comes a time a man when God's gonna be looking for some true worshipers in saying they that worship Him must they came they came to it no other way but they must worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah glory to God hey man so you know that's why the church name come from if birth out of that story with the the interaction with the woman at the well let me go on the first John chapter 2 and 15 it says love not the world a man neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him hey man if we're gonna serve God let's serve God with everything we got and and I and I got one more that I want to read before we just break into something here glory to God Ruth 1 and 15 now I'm always blessed by this particular passage because I could go through this church with most of the saints and I could probably you know I could recall how many of you all got here how you all became a part of a man this this ministry that there there are different things that happen along the way that you know you just you don't forget a man you just don't forget right and and and and you know I remember you know brother and sister wisdom they were praying about a church to go to I knew we knew sister wisdom we knew brother Andrew we knew sister Tracy amen brother wisdom hadn't relocated here just yet and and when it came down you know they were praying and looking for a church to go to it and and and and here one day they walked in I think somehow way they got connected with sister Michelle and system shell and Biden said y'all can come in just just visit you know once one Sunday so I went out when they came to visit a man that Sunday morning whatever was that were preached was exactly what they were talking about the night before their house God picked up their whole conversation and preached it back to him sometime when God do that that's a confirmation to you that you're in the right place right so they like they just kind of held offense like wow that was that was something they went went home and and the next day you know I mean the next week they came back and here it is again and happened a second time what they talked about the day before preach from the pulpit like oh my this has gotta be gone so our brother wisdom you know he he uh he looked at sister wisdom and just kind of gave me say I got my answer he just said yeah I got my answer that on the on I need that I need to ask them or I got man side no one's for the beat and since the wisdom looked at him and she gave him the response she said she said where you go i'ma go say where you worship are my worship say your God gonna be my god that your people don't be my people that's the way it's gonna be for me so ever since that time they've been right here and you know what we find that story in the Book of Ruth chapter 1 starting at verse 15 can we read it and she said Behold our sister-in-law is going back until her people unto her God returns out after my sister-in-law verse 16 the roof said and treatment not to leave thee all to return from following after thee we need some conviction like that they know that they were they where God want them to be no matter what trial come upon going nowhere listen we we said entreat me not to leave thee all to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and my god where's our bass will I die and then will I be buried and the Lord do so to me and more also if oh but death part thee and me what a decision Ruth had to make and let me tell you something I've watched many of you all make similar decisions they become part of spirit and truth tabernacle and I want to tell you today I thank God for the decisions that you've made well no matter the criticism no matter what it was a man that you you might have had to go through and some of y'all and went through a lot but you made it and guess what we still stand-in fifteen years later we're still standing fifteen years later hey God is a good God God is a good God I need to just pause here and just kinda just ask a question a couple questions those of you that have been with spirit and truth tabernacle from 11 to 15 years 11 to 15 years stand to your feet 11 to 15 years praise the Lord y'all give him a hand thank God for these that have been standing it's so long and I know we got a couple more that's not here today but these have been some people that been they've been they've been man they don't seen a lot done been through a lot I just appreciate each one of you all those that are in the six to ten year range six to ten if you've been a part of Spirit of Truth Tabernacle from six to ten years you stand six to ten all right let's give them a hand and those of you that have been apart from five years in under you stand five years and under look at that now praise the Lord I just I just want to say God has been good a man throughout these different seasons and you know and just I mean you can see where we went from growth a man from that 11 to a 15 year range a man if I were to but now the 15 year people is only a few of us it's only a few of us 15 year people all right but I'm gonna share with you all the story of how everything got started and and the reason I do that I learned a long time ago that if you don't give you a testimony the devil would give you one if you don't say what it was like then the devil gonna make up a story on you and everybody gonna go believe in what the devil got to say come on somebody that's why you gotta be you got to give your own testimony alright but you know but but when you know there's a couple things that's fine I want to go back to John 15 that's the last scripture that I that I left and I said I had 10 10 scriptures the last one is John 15 and I want to just kind of go back and read that and I just want to give you a personal testimony here you know for how this church got started let's go back and read actually before before I read John 15 just just the personal testimony of me getting started ministry one of the things whatever the thing that happened to me in my life seven different people at different times had come to me and was kind of you know calling me up into the ministry let me just put it that way one of them happened to be brother Fred mullets I was at a meeting I was young man I was at a meeting and I drove up and we were going there was a meeting to the New York church from New York was going to South Carolina and we went to that meeting and they announced at the meetings that we want all the ministers to sit on the platform when all ministers you know company I'll sit on the platform tonight they were gonna brother Coleman was gonna give us his personal testimony so I was there with another brother a man my brother in law at the time we drove up and you know we went and and as I was walking through the worker through the church door brother Fred was standing there and he stopped and that me and my brother brother-in-law walking through and he stopped me and they say hey young man are you a minister and I looked at him saying no I'm not alright well why would he say that to me how come he say that to this guy here you know he said it to me so I said no I said we don't sit down where I'm normally sit down and I say no more well you know a few years later his assistant you know brother Isaiah Chisholm was here preaching in in Okeechobee and and and I went up in our sing a song and after the service providers there came to me saying hey brother are you a minister I said no sir I'm not a minister I'm just you know just brother you know I just love the Lord so he'd like okay all right I was like all right I don't know why people keep asking me this so one day I was at home you know and there was a we lived in a cul-de-sac a man and and and we had a townhomes and everything so we lived in a particular areas like four townhomes in this cul-de-sac and there would be four townhomes in one building it's probably so four buildings of like that so we I'm living on this side of cul-de-sac and there's other people live on the other side all the park is right there in between and one day I happen to get home early from work and and as I got home I'm jumping out the car and you know you see your neighbors you wave at them you know periodically when you see him so I got it I was jumping out the car to go into the house they got on you know really early must spend like 3 o'clock in a day and I got home and and there was a lady you know one of my one of the neighbors she was an older lady sitting in the other on the other side of the cul-de-sac and she just yell about young man young man I say yes ma'am I rent running to us so yesterday I said yes ma'am how can I help you she said young man I say yes ma'am she said are you a minister I said no ma'am and then she did me like this I said what in the worlds that means you know what is that Lord and she said she just walked away just shaking him right now how you gonna leave me like that I just I mean I walked away with that I say Lord I don't know what what that was you know so you know I just I just kept going and then you know I I end up going for my master's degree and I was in college and when I got to college a man there was a you know we had my first teacher in college was a retired preacher and a Lutheran preacher so he wanted us to get up and talk for about five minutes on business and you know this little subject that we had it was a business class and and I so I'm sitting there telling everybody no no let's not talk right now I was so nervous I don't want to talk I'm gonna do nothing said please don't so they finally said well let's all do our talking and then we'll go to lunch and then you can come back and give us some critique and I said okay so everybody had to get up then talk so I got up and I did my little talk on business and and I sat down so then they said he said well do y'all want me to give you our critique now or do you want me do you all want to do it after lunch so everybody to class said let's do it now I said oh no this man gave me raped me over the coals I don't know lord I don't want to hear this so he started telling everybody said you did this and if you would do that better this would be good if you would do this that would be good if you would do this that would be good so he's just going through and saying Jack I say all hear it come you say Jack is a natural I said what he said yeah Jack isn't natural it just seemed like it's everything just flowing I was as nervous out as I don't know when so I'm like Lord I wouldn't expect to hear that so I'm sitting there for lunch and this guy he was a captain in the military in the Marines his name was Captain car he said Jack I say yes sir he says anybody ever tell you that you sound like a reverend I said wait a minute we here for business we're just talking business this isn't got nothing to do it no Church they say anybody ever tell you sound like a reverend so I said now come on now so one of the girls packed up she said yeah we used up there I ain't know whether to say a man or what all in class right I didn't know whether say me know what I didn't know what to say I say I say all right okay all right all right thank you thank you all right I just leave it like that so he would let it go he said Jack say yes how old are you and at the time I was 33 years old I said I'm 33 he said okay so Jack say how old was Jesus when he died Jesus was 33 when he died so what he was telling me right then that I need to die to myself and surrender to what the Lord had for me so I that was that was number four and then I happened to go to my grandma's Church my grandma this is where I learned got my Pentecostal roots at that grandma's Church and I walked in church one Friday we was I don't know the Nords of Sunday we were going for family and friends there something like that and I walked in church and after church her pastor Bishop John D Alexander he came up and had glasses on me and my dad was standing there talking and he walked up to me and he had his glasses then he dropped them and he looked at me it's a young man yes sir when you're gonna do what the Lord told you to do say sir aye aye sir Lord I said no no no no when you're gonna do what the Lord told you to do sir he said let me tell you something he said if you ever need a place to practice you come and you come right here to my church you can practice right here now that was a Pentecostal preacher opening his door so when you see me kind of opening the door to other young ministries that's because somebody did that for me all right so you know he said if you need a place to practice Micah I couldn't believe it you know that that he was doing that and you know there was a I said well you know and I never actually got a chance to take him up on that offer but I said lord I thank you for that and you know but it was another confirmation and one day you know my grandma she had come to the house and was all suppose to be going out to dinner and and grandma stopped me before we could go out she said Jack the Lord told me to say something jack I say Oh Lord girl my gotten to say the Lord told me he called me and he wants you to get started I said grandma I love the Lord said no that ain't it Jack God wants you to get started with a ministry say Oh Lord grandma okay thank you you know I just left it like that but that was six I told y'all on Franklin Wednesday night my seventh one was when I went out to my cousin's house fixing his computer when I'm fixing the computer there he was reading Joshua one over the top of me I was he asked me about how his church today and I told him I didn't go to church today he like what you mean you didn't go to church sister so now I didn't go to church they have a house church last week I didn't go to church last week what in the world so he said he still can't know this is God is calling you and they began to tell me his old testimony how he got called and and how he was so faithful just preaching to him and his wife that was all in the church for about 10 years just him and his wife but he was faithful doing that he said how God does begin at he just sharing this old testimony I say Lord I think if it is then he took me to Joshua 1 he just ran over Joshua 1 to me I said lord I know this is you speaking to me and I say this this is this is it I just I had to come to a place while just you know surrendering to God so as I got to that point there is a scripture that God gave me that's where John 15 comes in can we read this again says that I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman see it's one thing to just kind of go out doing stuff because you feeling something but there's another thing when you base it on the word can I go further y'all it's this okay today a man a man I said I I'm The True Vine and my father is a husband man every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that bears fruit he purchased it and that it may bring forth more fruit now right there I got stuck I got stuck on that script because I'm like Lord why you know I'm a part of a fruitful ministry why would you take me out you know why would you do that you say say he said just look at and say he said even though it's bearing fruit right say he that he take away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges in that it may bring forth more fruit right so so he says so what he could begin assumes that sometime you got to go through a cutting process in order to bring forth more fruit even that ministry I would have to go through a cutting process in order to bring forth more fruit can I tell you something 2015 we lost a lot of people right here in the church it was a cutting process but when I act with those that have been here five years another more Stila and that group the any other group it shows that it was a proving process in order to bring forth more fruit but at that time the way I was looking at like Lord are you calling me out of this ministry because you want to bring forth more fruit here at this church not only there but you also want to bring forth more fruit in my life so I said Lord I'm okay I'm just I'm just I'm sitting with that now you know I I I'm a just just drop the sin brother branham was talking about in a particular quote here he was saying how sometimes a pastor the way that he has to hear from God say he don't see digits he don't see visions he says so what happens to him is that God he goes by inspiration of presentment that's what the prophecy so he goes by the inspiration of present men he says so God will present something to that pastor and he has to just kind of flow with and God will prove himself and what he presented to him he don't have no vision it's just by faith and here I all that no vision I had a scripture John 15 so I'm sitting there and I'm thinking on the scripture you know I kept on going said now you clean through the word which I've spoken unto you about of me and I in you as the branch cannot bear it's bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you accept you bother me now I'm the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I'm him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and as I'm just sitting there processing different things become I remember an older sister when she heard that we had started a church she's sitting word through her grand oh she say tell tell brother Jack that whatever he start preaching keep preaching don't change what he's safe from his start say cuz many churches have failed because the preacher begin to change let down the stand say keep preaching I say well I'm gonna take that as advice and I'ma keep that right but as I was sitting there processing this descriptor just you know me and the Lord personally we went to a convention up in Pennsylvania and when I was at the convention I'm like Lord you know and I hadn't even told my wife about this scripture I'm just holding onto it you know I went to the convention and and his brother brother David Muscovy walks up to the pulpit and he says you know he wanted to preach a sermon and he says let's turn to John 15 and he opens up his Bible he begins to read John 15 these same scriptures and the title of his sermon was fruit much fruit more fruit soon as he off soon as you said John 15 and said that time I said God you speaking to me I said right there and and I'm just I listen to every word that man who sent me because I knew God was was speaking directly to me and it was at that moment I said Lord now I know this is you I don't know what to do with this I say if we started church what's going to be the name at that moment I prayed and God said spirit and truth Tabernacle and I held on to it and I knew that was in the Bible I said just held on to us I ain't saying I didn't say then to my wife I can get to ecstatic just just I'm gonna just leave this alone well I waited two years two whole years and as I waited that's why I said my man's gift make room for itself you just wait on the Lord God God are doing in his time amen so you know I waited I waited that for two years and then you know the Lord started dealing with my wife and dreams and you know and as we begin to get the interpretation for the dreams you know we knew that God was moving so we start talking a little bit about churches today well what's gonna be the name of the church I say it's Spirit of Truth Tabernacle I said well this is I walk through the whole process just what God said two years ago and I just been waiting on God to deal with you see sometimes you got you got to learn how to wait you can't just I mean something you gotta wait to God let God allow other people to see the whole picture and God deal with them in their own individual ways that's you've dealt with us I said you know when you got your wife standing with you then you can stand hello somebody right and so you know when we were you know we before we left you know the church we were fellowshiping with we met without with our pastor and we talked to him and at that time a man we went in to meet with them I just told them I said you know pastor I just want to let you know I just feel that whatever the Lord wants me to do whatever he's called me to do whatever he wants me to do I say I feel free that I can do what God called me to do amen I said I feel free and say I had to know with him myself I had to have my personal revelation that I was free to do what God called me to do somebody else might not have felt that way but I say I believe I'm free right and long as I believe it and I can see it in the Bible and I can see the message and I'm gonna go do what God called me to do and I just left it like that you know so the question was actually my wife are you ready for this and I love her response I'll never forget it I'll never forget it she said she just looked and said nobody can ever be ready for this nobody I don't care how much you prepare how much you try to prepare you'll never be ready for this but all you can do is you yourself to God and just allow him to get all the glory and all the honor out of your life I walked out of that office proud of my wife now I'm gonna tell you I'm still proud of her today I'm still proud of her today I've watched her go through a lot y'all don't know what my wife go through yeah yeah absolutely first of all just putting up with me it's a lot to put up with me yeah I don't know ask my mama I asked my brother ACK ACKs people that know me I'm I'm a piece of work I'm a construction site he's still working on me all right but up but you know I mean for her to even just put up with me and then just some of the pressures and some other things that she has to deal with so much some people just don't know and I'm gonna tell you God gave me her for a reason especially knowing I'd be dealing with a lot of sisters because I'm a man don't understand women say man it's the truth in high a man don't understand women it take women to understand women huh a man is sitting listen to you talk all day and he just see a man just a confident thinking about a knight in shining armor let's get this thing fixed and you know and walk out looking like a hero but he ain't heard no he just been set up but his wife will say you need to kind of go back on that one God get sheet sheet cover his blind spots that's why I think God forgot the way amen hey man hey man I don't keep no secrets from her I wanna I want everybody to know that I don't keep ain't nobody gonna come between me and my wife I don't care who you are I'm gonna let you come between me and my wife you don't want her to know about it don't tell me don't tell me if you don't want her to know about it hey man I might not say it exactly how you say it but she's got mo praise the Lord that's why we don't kept the devil out of here for 15 years all right well yeah you know yeah no no no no no look dude this is what's going on right if I start keeping secrets other people feel like they can come to me that way next thing no people invite me over there could you come in my house and don't bring you away don't bring my wife you don't lost your mind praise the Lord somebody I learned that from my pastor he took his wife everywhere he went you always saw them together all right all right man I learned it even sometimes sitting at meetings you sometimes she have to be there his wife specially if it's another sister uh-huh his wife gonna be there Oh glory to God you know I'm going back to this testimony but you know even nowadays you need a witness when you're counseling people cause you don't know who's gonna come through here oh yeah I just need to talk to the pastor okay me and this brother right here gonna talk to you together why because cuz I need a witness just in case you say I said something that I didn't say a man is some little you're some little boy come in and say I did something to him that I didn't do I want a witness even some little girl right I just want to talk to the pail you're gonna talk to the pastor and his wife I do that to protect you and me if I'm doing that you should be doing that don't be running over nobody house you Mary tell my to what you don't go to the house like that you bury it that's how you keep the devil on a man Church right that's how we keep the devil out you got the raise of an octave you know your merit don't do stuff like that get out of there as fast as you possibly can it's best if you know you got an attraction don't hold their hand too long shake and run ain't the truth oh god bless you you keep on playing with that devil all right you'd be further than you ever thought you'd ever go and then then you come want to say a lot I'm so sorry he can't forgive you but if you could avoid it avoid amen all right so I've learned that a long time ago that's why I don't counsel sisters by myself and it's based somebody get into crying and everything I think I'm going back to my testimony is this how we keep the devil honest that this this exactly I would keep the devil out and and sometimes the young people might not realize what I'm doing so sometimes good just to stop and just break things down I mean we keep our eyes on the devil keep my eyes on the devil and and he always looking for some kind of way to get in trying to get a little foothold and like please don't do that because that's the devil right as soon as you get in oh I didn't mean that I know I know you did that's why I was telling you ahead of time I know you wouldn't mean to do it that's why I was telling you ahead of time don't allow the devil to get you there amen the stay as far away as you possibly can amen I might as well say this while I'm here the Lord is blessed for the Caleb in a nice little apartment God's blessed brother Stephen a nice little part meant I thank God for blessing brothers I'm so glad y'all clap now I'm gonna say something else and I want y'all clapping again on this one I don't want the sisters single sisters hanging out of their brother's apartments the brothers can go not the sisters and if one of the sisters get an apartment brothers don't be hanging out at that sister partment any man y'all want to keep it devil away that's how you keep the devil away so my oh I was just bringing something oh you ain't bringing nothing over here better keep it at your house I'll meet you at the fellowship in public but you ain't coming over here amen that's how you keep the devil out amen all right amen glory to God Oh locked that's a single sister shouldn't even be inviting brothers to come stay at her house there they ain't got no hotel I'm sorry I tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna help you with some money for the hotel but you ain't staying here if it's a single sister coming all right we'll you know we can with that all right she might be a merit system without a husband too we might be able to work with that and sometimes you know it might be you know it all depends on the situation amen I'm just leaving like that sometimes you got to be careful some couples you might say we're gonna help you get a hotel others you might say okay y'all you know we'll let y'all come and sting I can't I'm a clap [Applause] so finally when we first when we decided to start the church we were in my mother-in-law's driveway at her house in Greenacres and that's where me and my wife had that conversation about what's the name is Church for me and I told the Spirit of Truth Tabernacle she was right there with me and we started a church there in our home in Lantana Florida and we were meeting there a man for about a year just just us my wife my three daughters I used to take and we have I passed back then so I had a whole bunch of paper I print out all my cokes and I had all this paper and we had a little PM and there sitting in the house and and and man it was it was rough preaching to that church y'all I'm telling you it's rough a man then folk members a man and my oldest daughter and I'd be up there reading out and I'd do something like this and she'll sit in the audience and she'll do you know everything I do she just mimicked me right I say what a what a what a member here you know and you know something's going about a year you know like that and you know and and and what i would do periodically because i wanted my family still stand fellowship i go to different services not fellowship i remember one time the lord had told me to stay home and minister's sermon i said no I'm going for fellowship today so I went all the way up okay - and I and I went the minister it seemed like brother smile has changed this whole sermon once I walked through the door and he show preach something and I walked out I said Lord I ain't coming back until God tell me to come back told me to stay home and I didn't obey him so I hate show put it on me today and I thank God that brother smiler preached to that wing it helped me to be obedient and as we were there in the house it took about a year and and within that year this pulpit that you see is my wife saw me up there struggling trying to preach and my wife say I got to find him a pulpit that's how you know she behind you all right so she went on eBay and she found this pool but I was going to school for my Master's down in in Fort Lauderdale and she found a church in Fort Lauderdale was getting rid of pulpit I think for $50 and she say she said we gotta you know let's go in and get that pulpit for yourself okay pulpit she got that pulpit I went down there picked it up put it inside my car and I brought it back to the house and man this thing ain't light this thing like this heavy this is solid wood but my wife used to help me lift it in and out of garage and put it inside the church is set up in liberal for service I appreciate away from that about a year we got on the one day our preach the sermon I said yeah that's a prophesy don't be surprised if people start joining us I prophesied that but three weeks later after that we went forth got a telephone call sister Dixon she was she was she had been going out to you know Okeechobee she just needed to change because the drive was just really wearing a body down so she needed she said she can have a car at the time so she wanted to come to church she should say brother Jack i'ma have my son bring me and we gonna come to church on this Sunday okay so this is Dixon and so brother Roy came with just a Dixon on that Sunday and and write the full service about 10-20 service start at 10:30 I'll know I like to start on time right but 10th when I got a call and and sister say y'all having church today say yeah let's see can I come yeah you can come okay I'm on the way right now there's my mother-in-law and she comes she come be like and all three of them showed up on the same day for the same service and we had church and and I tell you what my mother-in-law been with me since that time and I am so grateful a man that she's been with me during that same time mama you know started coming and mom it mama it made a comment she said you know I I felt like I wanted to come and help the ministry I just wanted to come and be a help to the ministry then later on she said well I found out the minister was a help to me praise the Lord praise the Lord and and in that and so we were still fellowshiping in the in the home and then sister Cobb she happened to be going up and down the streets with her business and she was there in Green Acres and she saw the building said for rent she said y'all need to go check out this building's for rent and Green Acres I said okay I'll go check it out and I went and look and and I looked at that building and space I said it had partitions I've been all kind of stuff I said we can't do not what this can't put no Church in here but my wife is a woman of vision all right and she looked at say oh yeah we can have Church in here not this fall out and knock that wall out and do this and we'll paint this we'll paint that we all see that look the way this paint and stuff like this in here that's just Erika's touch if it would've been my touch white walls all around but she made it feel well I gave him a welcoming presence and so you know she was there just getting we'll get somebody and they can do this to you I said okay alright I'm gonna trust your judgment on this and we had a brother brother Richard he come in he started knocking this side and knocking it out of next thing I listen to people in here and I said man we can yeah we can have Church in here and you know and and I realized that at that time when we were knocking down the walls that was very significant for me in my in my ministry because the people that God was bringing to this church was people from other facets of the message and in the message we had walls built if you didn't believe what we believe you on the other side of the wall but in order to get us from the same side of wall we got to knock the wall down then it put us all in the same room glory and when we've not been washed down I begin to see some things and God just begin to you know just show you know that he was with this remember I told you that sometimes what God have to do is just show a preacher he just give him a little something he don't he don't give him a vision he just put a little something in his spirit and that's God leading a man and brother branham called it a man a let me just get that again I don't want to misquote it my lord the the inspiration of resentment right that's what he called the inspiration of resentment so you know when when when we were there for a number of years and many I think I could just go through this church I remember sister Michelle when she got there to the first church she was we working on it we were working on the church and I think she's talking system it's just a cop and on the phone and say I got a church yeah we got a building what I handle eight worth in Greenacres all right I was just I got to stop by to pick up some this is Michelle came and she walked in and she was sitting there in see yeah we watch what you see out your mouth cuz she released something out of her mouth and she was in there she see I can see myself sitting right here since Michelle sitting right there and been with us for a long time I certainly appreciate her I remember her and sister team and it was trying to decide what they was gonna do and they there was they were we've gone to meeting up in Georgia and I let him hold my car you know to drive on up there and and when they got into the car there was a song plan and they thought I set him up but I didn't it just that's just the way it was but the song start playing it wasn't easy but it was worth it and they say brother Jack did this that's not me that's God right and I you know and everybody that knows if you've come from another church we always I mean I'm top of each other immediately coming from another I'm not talk about you was you know out of church for a while and I'm talking you just left another church my advice when we sit down and talk them be make sure you've talked to your pastor because I'm gonna talk to him anybody can lift a hand be the witness that that has happened all right okay that's the way we do things you know why we do that that keep fellas just amongst the churches we don't get the devil no space we don't give him a space but you know so when they all showed up and then you know God just began to add you know to the church and and as we got a little larger a man and like I said sister Tina system shells in that car both of them at the same time made a decision that we're gonna make spirit into my church home and and I remember you know we was at sister Tina house and sister Michelle's daughter Shanice she walked up to me and she said are you preacher at the church and I looked at I say I guess I am the preacher at the church you know but uh but you know we were we went through all that and God just beginning adhere and there we got up to about you know 40 or 50 at that church and I said man wing I'm be able to add no more we can have meetings we couldn't do anything so you know we gotta have to take a step of faith we gotta find somewhere else and that's when the Lord just begin to put and I think around that same time that's when brother Brown beginning to come glory to God brother Brown was coming out there to the other church and he would bring sister Brown with him right and and then you know if brother Brown was there I remember and I'll never forget that taste things that happened that you just don't forget all right and I so so before we come here brother Caleb Duron had come and he preached a sermon out there and he stopped in the middle of sermon said brother Jack you lean in a particular way God said go that way he gonna be with you and I was trying to get all the brothers to support you know us coming here cuz our rent was getting ready to double and I'm like man it's already tough paying this how're we gonna be able to do that I said oh no he said he said you leave mr. Wingo that way gotta be with you you know what we've been here 10 years and we pay rent every month amen I'll be honest I some time they do call for it but we get it to him God has been a good God has been good but uh you know so as I was you know just you know we the Lord spoke that and kind of gave confirmation through the brother prophesy like that so we took it and we came on here and man I remember that first service we were just marching around this place doing the Jericho March and and I knew my brother knew how to build and everything and we want we want to be specific and getting him to come in here and help us you know and and you know you call them people like that you know you got ulterior motives you know that you you know that just hopefully my brother coming here and building and got out as soon as he could right in there and the reason he did that cuz he told me ladies say you don't want to be around that anointing you don't want to be around a lot so you break down in it and nobody want to be around that anointing right so but when God did what he did in my brother's life now he can't get away from the Norton he create the anointing and I thank God for him and his wife when y'all go next door y'all gonna see what my sister loved us that that's that's how ministry but when we came here and I remember then we had those chairs that jog on sit on next door chairs been with us a long time and we didn't get rid of them they tell a story when y'all come to pray you get on your knees the cushions think about sister Dixon she was our first charter member and she made those chairs I mean those does she made the covers for people to sit on cuz them had them shares was hard but then we took we made them print cushions when we got here right but you know we've been using them praying praying use them as prayer cushions and man just what a what a blessing has been but uh but I remember when we bought these chairs we bought 120 of them for the upper room right yes that's what we did we bought 120 for the upper room experience and and we had that just a few weeks ago I start out I got more he want to do but when we bought them chairs and brother Brown he was losing this ice night and brother Brown came to church the ones one Sunday and we was up here you know just worshiping and he walked in and I think he could only see out one eye brother Brown got over here right with just Amanda City and he looked sat down and put his arm on the chair he liked it y'all don't y'all know steppin okay man I never forget that he was just so excited you know just just seeing what the Lord was doing and and in church I mean that the list just goes on and on and I believe I was we were going to a camp meeting to print to preach at the tent and that year I didn't want to be at the tent I didn't want to be there I'm like man and a couple reasons I'm like no reach outside the tent I don't know I don't know about that I'm like I don't really want to be there now you know we end up going in with me and brother smiling we end up going and and I remember watching brother smiley preach that Friday night and there was a big buck big big huge bug just come out of nowhere and just hit him in the back while he was preaching I said lord if they happen to meet him on a night I think the sermon gonna be done cuz I can't handle this and by God's grace he said some rain and when the rain came that pushed the bugs away I say thank God and that night we would preach him and you know and underneath the tent brother Solomon sister Naomi brother Colima all of them is really clean but he you know when he in church yeah I mean I'll never forget them you know we were there we just had a good time just around the Word of God and and and then I think a few months later we were there at brother France and and I preached again and and then you know it was during that time brother Solomon insisting Elmen was praying about you know what church they should go to and I brother saw her say you talk to us tonight and they only said not what you think about brother Jack just I think he can be my pasta and way back there I me wanna go to the 10th but God needed me at the 10th because there was a family there that was looking to come back home they were from Florida right so God orchestrated all of that through the Johnsons coming we got sister sure right and since the Shirelles father is the one that introduced for the solid minute to the message he walked up to him one day he was witnessing to me say God sent a prophet and you missed it what would you do what would you do somebody walked up to you and said God send a prophet and you missed it what prophet what you're talking about but it sparked something in them and it look at look at what God is doing look at what God is doing I just - Sam and her brothers I remember sister Sam and sister London anybody remember them them two sisters my god you know they went you would see them from church to church to church to everywhere use that them two sisters was there and I said man I'd mind I'm sisters I admire sister Sam it's just a real honor I just I just I always appreciated them and you know they were at a church and you know so just a few things changed there and they were looking for a place to fellowship God allowed him to come here and make spirit in truth their home right I remember those days I remember those days and through sister Sam we got a brother praise the Lord for that right marking hurts a man came through that and just I could I can't go through all y'all but y'all know I know your story I know your story I know the samuel kids was going to church with a dad and the dad we don't understand nothing we don't know nothing we don't daddy we don't those daddy came to me was having a fellowship like this night yeah I gotta be careful about having these fellowships as brother Samuel came to the fellowship and after the fellowship he pulled me to the side he said my kids say they don't know nothing they don't understand nothing and you know I'm a musician I go from church to church he said they what they say they want to come to this church so I'm leaving them in your hands and they dropped off keys and all of them we thank God for all the summer kids I mean what what what talents what talents right and you know just just thinking about how God just orchestrated all of this but it took a step of faith and as I go back in my mind and just I really just really reflect on all these things all I can say is God you made a way you did this this is nothing that brother Jack did nothing that my family did this is this is all God and and I just have to take a moment just to tell them thank you just to tell them thank you pray with me father I just just wanted to take a little trip down memory lane today reflecting on your goodness your mercy that has been given to us for these 15 years just as we move from our house to the first church from the first church to where we are currently we know we've reached this 15 year point and God there you still may cause us to grow to expand along this journey you you allow the school to start there's so much that you've done God through the years and how grateful we are for the things that you've done our prayers that should help us to remain flexible that we could move Lord as you would call us to move that we would do two things that you would call us to do that we wouldn't just be satisfied with where we are we're certainly grateful for what you have done and we're grateful for what you're doing now but we got we know there's more that you want to do in the future each one god I look at every face has a story every one God has a testimony and I could just sit here and I could just go through Lord how each one came and how you orchestrated I could go through that but God I just want to stop and say thank you because Spirit of Truth would not be spirit and truth if it wasn't for your people making it that I pray your blessings upon each family a pretty encouragement I pray your strength I think about mother Tillman Lord who have you called home but before she left God how she was just touched by the love of people Lord and how they how we just encircled and around it brother Brown gosh she was touched by that she remained faithful God would grateful some you've called home and we realized that my dad was one of them brother Mike oh my god Lord a certainly one that just means so much to all of us but you called them home for the hochi the God knew that the fruits that the tree it was pruned it was cut so they could bring forth more fruit look at what's coming out a even think about brother and sister Robles so many God I'm so grateful the Lord from the bottom of my heart I just want to say thank you thank you Jesus thank you Jesus may you bless us as we go forth give us another 15 years if you've Terry Lord give us another 15 years keep us together and keep keep the enemy out Lord we know he don't like this and he'll do everything he can to try to draw a wedges and all that other kind of stuff but Lord keep the devil out help us to realize that there's nothing but the devil you've been so good to us we love you Jesus we praise you we bless you we adore you it's in Jesus Christ's name that we pray amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise
