Lord and I know we got a preacher hallelujah amen God has sent to us for such a time as this Hallelujah and um I know the Lord has placed something in his heart for all of us Amen on today but I just quickly wanted to mention amen it's so good to see uh sister Tom Wayne Amen back did to have her amen and uh we we thank God for keeping her while she was away uh this morning we had our Sunday school and and I want to say thank you to all the parents that press to bring their children here uh for Sunday school brother brandom say don't send them you're supposed to bring them and um and um I'm grateful for all the parents for the sacrifice you know if we if we get them up to go to regular school we wake them up tell them they can't over sleep they can't do none of this you got to get your work done you got to be just as Vigilant when it comes to Sunday school amen uh these are the things that shape them as young people so we want to have amen an environment where we can do that I just thank you all parents for coming amen and and bringing your your uh your youth amen for the uh Sunday school this morning um as you saw we will be starting our fast today amen it's a 21-day fast we call it a corporate fast because and and again I don't make this um I'm not trying to be legalistic in any way at all but uh however the Lord would lead you to fast and that can be food can be to a certain time of day 12:00 3:00 now I no this that when your doctor ask you to fast you don't give no uh resistance or feed you know not not it's not feedback but push back you don't give no pushback okay doc no problem Dr Jack Duff if you need me to carry that title I'm asking you to join us in this corporate fast the reason we call it corporate because when you look in the Book of Esther uh there was a time amen that they uh they needed Esther to go before the king because there was a a decision that had been made they were going to kill all the Jews and Essa had not shared who she was but Mori told her look don't think just because you in the King's house that you're going to be spared when they realize who you are you're going to die like the rest of us it says and but but maybe God has place you in this position that you can go to the King on behalf of your people and let me let me help you to understand Esther's position as Queen was not her highest role that she was to play right but when she stepped in into amen this role of Savior she went before the king and says you know look I if I die I'll die she say if I perish I perish but I'm going to go see the king but before she went to see the king she said look I need everybody to enter into corporate fasting not just you Uncle Mori I want the whole nation of Israel so we all together enter into this time of fasting it might be social media it might be food it might I don't know what it is that God will lead you to do but whatever the Lord lead you to do do something during this next 21 days the other thing that we are under we're under this and uh at the same time that our fast will end we are also under manded not to say anything negative we had a 40-day challenge don't say one thing negative everything got to be positive coming out of your mouth don't let the devil make you say nothing negative hallelujah we're just going to see what the Lord does for us Amen brother McBride came to us on Friday night and we had a wonderful service amen uh gauging success was its title and I encourage you if you if you weren't here just go back and listen to the service I'm sure you'll be blessed amen by uh what he shared and this morning the Lord has brought him back brother mcbright comes to us from Colombia uh South Carolina his Pastor there is uh Brother Anderson we were just there on last weekend and had a wonderful time in service with them and also a marriage conference that uh my wife and I were able to do and we we just uh it was just a real blessing uh for us so so happy to have him amen this weekend with us and then next weekend brother Paula fontain got a few that's going to be passing through in the next few weeks uh but I know God going to have something special for us amen so let's stand to our feet amen let's receive our brother I won't sing a song Amen cuz um I think he's ready to go amen praise the Lord let's receive him let's clap our hands receive the man of God as he [Applause] [Music] comes hey man you could have sung the song brother I just couldn't stay back there I wanted to be obedient with everybody else clap my hands and praise the Lord but God bless you Saints um we thank God for his grace and his mercy and for allowing us to be able to come together this morning by his grace um and our whole heart's desire is that his will be fulfilled am and I believe it has to be because his word Can't Fail amen so we look to him to uh help us to see whatever he would have for us to see this morning it's been a blessing to be here I've not been down this way this direction in quite some time uh is is one thing uh I I say this kind of jokingly but um you know I bought me a bottle of lotion with me it was no point of me using it it's so hot it just come right right off so uh when I left home it was uh it was right at 40 like 6 or 7 that morning and then got down and Road a little bit it Rose to 50 53 54 and man we here Florida it jumped up to 79 I was like Lord I'm glad I I brought the right kind of clothes yes sir I did bring me a little jacket but I ain't left that in the truck hey man but it's uh it's good to be here it really is to be able to some some of you I've seen before some I haven't but um it's just good to be amongst good people the saints of God um really welcoming you know and that that means a lot so and I I really I really thank God for helping me on Friday I really enjoyed ministering to the young people amen and [Applause] U and it's just a blessing uh you GL you guys see it here but we see it there as well God is just moving amongst the young people and in such a wonderful way amen um and it's just a blessing to be able to be a witness of that Hallelujah um my my friend and my brother uh brother Smiley amen amen good to see him am praise God so brother Smiley every time I think about you brother there's one sermon that just never leaves me over all these years humiliation before exaltation amen that made an impact on me brother Hallelujah I believe it was an experience that God allowed you to have in another country but in the back of a truck or something amen that was a powerful message evidently cuz it's it stuck with me praise God so I thank God for him every time he's ministered up our way it's just been a real blessing my god um real down the Earth real practical yeah just to sit and watch God just work through him and just bring it right down to the residence of every heart amen that's there all right now amen so we thank God for him amen and pray the Lord continue to bless strengthen and keep him amen all right I don't want to keep you standing long right now so let's just go here if we will to [Music] um let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 yeah brother Quinton he corrected me also um I was commending him on his his organization and cleaning skills in the in the place that they provided for us to be able to stay in and he said well it's actually a young lady brother that comes and cleans so but she does a good job amen she must have been in the [Laughter] [Music] military amen so all right 1 Corinthians chapter 12 starting at Verse 18 it says but now haveth God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member he says where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the I cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you n but much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary right and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant cess for our calmly Parts have no need meaning it's always taken care of our face our head right but certain parts aren't as highly as you know esteemed that's it as other parts right um and and it exists amongst the body of Christ sadly to say at times praise God amen amen it says our comely Parts have no need but God have tempered the body together so there's a certain perspective right and relationship that God wants each member to have one to the other that's very important to him it's important to him how we see one another how we handle one another [Music] amen it says having giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked it says that there should be no Schism in the body that's it that's it that's it no division right whatsoever none amen can we say praise the Lord and this is a father talking about his family that's right yes sir amen my it says but that the members should have the same care one for another that's it and whether one member suffer all all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it Glory now ye are the body of Christ he says and members in particular Glory I want to go here one verse of scripture Romans chapter 5 and verse 19 Romans 5 verse 19 it says for as by by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous let's pray Saints Heavenly Father we love you but Lord as you know my heart every time I say that father I can't help but ask that you help me to love you more for in your word you said that you desire that we love you with all of our hearts all of our mind and all of our strength and that's been the main motive Lord behind our entire Christian journey is for you to bring us into that kind of A Love For You Lord at the relationship father might be the way that you intended for it to be that you might receive what you give Lord father so we thank you for how you've worked with each one of us and are still working with us Lord yes God and Father I pray this morning that your will be done father I didn't come for anyone to see me or necessarily recognize me Lord but that your people might be helped uh in whatever way you choose to be able to use me Father I've tried my best Lord God to humble myself before you Lord that your me your people might be helped so I just pray that by your Holy Spirit your precious Holy Spirit you would satisfy the needs of all that are here and Lord you are a great God a mighty God there's nothing that you can't do so Lord I pray that you would Minister father and strengthen and help as you see fit bless this church Lord bless the pastor and bless all that you have in store for them Lord everything is already set they're just walking into whatever you have already ordained to be days times weeks Lord God you have it all set Jesus some might be wondering about many things Lord but help every wandering mind to be settled father and to have a confidence and a trust in you that all things are well thank you Jesus we love you Lord God and we thank you and we ask all these things in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Let the church say amen amen you may be seated Saints amen so I really enjoy you all this worship amen uh just a blessing and it it really helped me in the back to get settled in my heart and that's the intent right that's the purpose to help us to settle down and to move into that channel of God all right amen that we might be in sync all right amen with him and that he might have his way Among Us amen um so I have somewhat of a strange topic but it's something I've not been able to get away from for quite some time now um it was very necessary for me to come into these things to the understanding of these things um and just just concerning my walk with God right but it it it it just took me into a place saints that I I I I don't even want to come out of it amen okay amen um and the topic itself is coordination coordination and as a subtopic connected connected so coordination just to help you to follow me a little bit coordination means the process of organizing people or groups so that they work together properly and well my God my God it says the harmonious functioning of parts for Effective results all of us in here we have different backgrounds different families some some have maybe the same families depending on how close you are you know as relatively relative speaking um but we come from different backgrounds you know uh in a company right you know all of us for the most part work for a company of some sort unless you're an entrepreneur and that company uh it's one company but it hires team members right these people have different skill levels different backgrounds different upbringings different beliefs right right but this company's objective is to bring all these individuals that differ one from another sir Under the Umbrella of that company and that company has a vision isn't that right right and it it it it it desires that each member that it chooses to hire to bring Under the Umbrella of that company it desires that that individual catch the vision of the company itself right but not just one individual each individual needs to catch that vision because once they all catch the vision that actually contributes to them being able to come together and begin to work together cuz everybody has a part to play everybody has a position you know how it is right when you're a part of a team and you have a position but everybody else has a position everybody want everybody else to do their job in order for us to meet production in order for us to meet our quota or whatever whatever the case might be Everybody Must operate within their positions efficiently consistently right if anybody slacks up that means somebody else got to work harder to try to fill that Gap brother now let me see by a show of hands who desires to be that person that has to fill in the Gap come on to do a portion of somebody else's job and they getting paid just like you getting paid truth brother right during my military time I was in the Marine Corps and certain people just have certain makeups right yes sir and nothing to myself by far but while I was in boot camp they chose to make me the guide of the platoon right so that that see that might seem like a glor you know other people wanted that position but that wasn't a glorious position because I was held accountable for everybody's actions I remember one time in particular Saints where one one individual forgot to lock their lock on their duffel bag and guess what the drill instructors went through while we were at child they found it and when the whole plon got back the individual that did it they wern't aware that they did it but when we came into that door the drill instructors called me front and center wow and when they called me front and center they pointed out the mistake that person made and they say now we going to get recruit McBride to pay the price wow for that individual not locking their lock wow and I had to get down and do push-ups until they told me to stop how you think I fell huh me and that individual that didn't lock they lock we had to have a talk we ain't going to be doing this again my brother I ain't going to pay the price for what you fail to do right but what were they trying to build come on they were trying to build a team sir you understand what I'm saying they were trying to create a situation to where everybody was watching how they did things so that it wouldn't negatively affect the other person yes sir come on brother I'm talking about coordination amen amen so to bring everybody together to catch that vision and once you catch that Vision that should encourage you to do your part because you see that by you being if everybody see that by being in their positions it contributes to the success of the entire company when everything is running smoothly as it's supposed to be everybody wins everybody gets bonuses everybody gets pay raises the whole company wins but sad to say whether it be a company and please forgive me let let's let's do one thing together just real quick all right do me a favor everybody repeat after me everybody say we love we love brother McBride remember that [Applause] now that's good I'm just a messenger I didn't put this on my own heart this was ministered to me I'm only giving to you what was given to me for me so I'm not preaching at no one so God as we read in our opening scripture he desired that everybody in the body have an actual care one for another amen amen in my home as a father that's my desire I want we got five kids well young adults adults and I want everybody to work together I don't even want to hear wrong tones toward one another I might be in another room somewhere but I'm paying attention and as I hear conversations and whatever and something sounds kind of off I want to come and I want to investigate is everything okay are there any issues you know why why why why why are you talking like that one to another why because in my home I want there to be a Harmony I want to feel good coming in my own home I want to be able to relax I want people to be happy and joyous I want God to have an atmosphere that he can come down in I don't want to have an atmosphere filled with confusion and fussing and backbiting and all kind of stuff going on what kind of a home is that if you got a business you don't want your your your your your your team members fighting amongst one another working against one another what a work environment is that that'll lead to the defeat of the whole company it a Lord have mercy the whole company will absolutely fail that's right brother due to wrong attitudes and things of that nature when you ain't working together you working against one another defeating the purpose killing the vision hallelujah amen can we say praise the lord lord okay so now let's kind of move into this other area here we read also in Romans where it says by one man's sin one man's Disobedience how many men what kind of an effect did that one man's decision have you and I are still dealing with the results of that decision today one man brother Brandon makes a statement he says that eternal life is living your life for who for yourself no for others what does that mean it what does that mean Saints normally when people commit crimes right they're a it's like they're more easily able to commit a crime you might have a man that has a family right but he's Bound by a certain Spirit he loves his family he might have kids he loves his kids but he's Bound by a certain spirit and sometimes in a when a way a person thinks they can actually commit a crime because in their mind somehow they think that I'm only a affecting myself right that's right I'm willing to take this risk to commit this crime because if anything goes down I'll go to jail come on but they don't think it's going to affect their loved ones truth isn't that right yes sir so when any evil spirit anoints someone it brings about a mindset of selfishness amen amen amen yes sir so Adam's one decision we're still dealing with the repercussions of back today even listen now even though Calvary took place that's right you understand now brother Brandon made a statement I want to make it very clear right now right even though Adam did what he did we can't blame today for what alt together for what we're deing he said because each one of us every day every minute every second every hour we have that same choice to make whether we going to eat from the Tree of Life or the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil with every decision amen every Deion amen every day nobody in this room is exempt from what I'm talking about right now Hallelujah I'm talking about coordination but on the same note just like Adam's decision affected us our decisions affect one another whether we realize it tonight whether we want to accept it or not we're actually [Music] connected let's go to remember what you said in the beginning now you said we love brother McBride let's go to Joshua chapter 7 there it is let's go to Joshua chapter 7 I want to go to verse one cuz even know we know that God deals with Israel as a nation and he deals with the Gentiles as individuals yet by the grace of God we want to bring out that we're still connected we still have an obligation to one another we have a responsibility to one another to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel amen Joshua 7 verse1 says but the children notice how it words this now but the children of Israel committed a trespass who did it children of Israel God counting it to the whole group yes brother yes Lord you mean to tell me you will cause other people to suffer because of one man's Disobedience there it is it says the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing it says for aen one man the son of Cari the son of zabdi the son of zer of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the Lord watch this one man did it one man took it upon himself to satisfy his own lust wow right one man and the Bible says when he did that it says God's anger was kindled against the children plural right of Israel that's right amen that's right prior to this they were at Jericho right and God call them to march around the land right the walls there and just before they were getting ready to enter God paused and he gave a warning through Joshua and he says now this place is a cursed he says when we go in here he says don't none of you take anything out of this land because if you individually take anything out of this land the individual that took it is a cursed amen right that's right but he he goes on to say saints that when you bring what you took that was a curse it it it causes you to become a cursed but then when you bring it back amongst the camp of Israel all of Israel is going to be a cursed amen everybody understand that so aen everybody supposed to be focused on the objective that God has set forth for the whole tribe of Israel and in order for them to be successful listen Saints they had to be obedient right that's good that's good you couldn't Veer off you couldn't you you you had to keep every word brother brandom says Canaan was not a type of the Millennium right because there was Wars it was fightings it was killings he said but it was a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said what it stood for he said it had to be a perfect walk that's it brother that's it but brother McBride and now you know we human I do know that we're human right but God has laid out Provisions that takes away every excuse you could ever come up with he shed his own blood amen that forgave all of us of every trespass and he gave his own Spirit to come on the inside of each one of us to give us power to be able to live what we could never do on ourselves so we ain't talking about self-righteousness now but we talking about every member dying to themselves and yielding to God and allowing God to come inside of their souls and take the full preeminence take control of your mind take control of your body and listen now he said I cause you to live according to my word I'll cause you to work walk right amen it's not us it's him and as we yield ourselves to him we allow him to do exactly that brother Brandon was a man like you and I born in sin had to come to a conversion yes sir but he came to a yielding and such a love for God until God can take control of that man and freely flow through his being glory to God yes sir many people exalt the prophet many people highly esteem him but he was a brother just like us and God only show through him what every one of us have the potential to move up into there's nobody in here that's exempt from that you got the potential to live just like that but it's through a relationship it's through a willful submitting of yourselves is through a love for God so when everybody's supposed to be focused on the mission everybody is supposed to be in their positions doing what they're supposed to do what they've been called to do aen he had this Spirit of lust on him that's it an evil spirit that calls him to desire to do contrary to do the exact opposite of what God was calling for right glory to God Spirits make people disregard the word of God you understand what I'm saying Saints amen aan heard very well what Joshua said right but he thought it was just a man see yeah amen you know that devil evil spirits want to make things very common so that we lose the respect amen that we should have toward the program of God and what God has established Among Us amen amen amen he want people to let down their guards he want people not to fear repercussions how was Eve able to venture beyond the word of God Lord have mercy Saints oh my we love brother Saints praise God you understand brother brandom said where Eve made her mistake listen to me Saints and this is where everybody makes their mistake whenever they allow themselves to fall into sin he says Eve stopped for one moment and considered the suggestion that the devil brought to her mind through the serpent and when she considered it that Spirit came inside of her right there right whenever you you whenever you allow yourself the Ponder of the toy around in your mind with suggestions that Devils bring to you to try to lead you into some way or another to hurt you come on but not just you come on Devils know that we're connected those Devils knew that achin was connected you understand what I'm saying them brothers out there fighting they out there doing exact L what God Said trying their best to be obedient for the success of the whole group but everybody wasn't a team member aen was an individual he was selfish all he thought about was his and what help what was satisfi what he wanted at at that time in that in that of his life so he walking around and everybody else fighting he scouting the land he supposed to be fighting he know that God said don't you take of one thing but now he going running through trying to shift through the stuff he see laid around and he see this coat he said man those threads are tight said them people here know how to dress I ain't seen no no coat like that they got that color coordination he thought about what he had already in his wardrobe he said man that coat can go with this that and the other but I don't even know what well when nobody will know where I got it from come on you supposed to be fighting brother you supposed to be keeping your mind on the Lord and what the Lord has set forth knowing that that's the key to your success said man let me and listen now he had to take that garment Saints and what do he have to do with it he couldn't just take and just walk go show people look at what I got you like I pick it up from right over there cuz he he he might he might talk to the wrong person he might he might talk to a person whose mind is stayed on the Lord amen and he didn't want to get a reuke while he was abiding his sin so he was careful who he talked to yes sir Jesus come on Sir many times people that are called away listen now they might be real brothers and sisters but they sto for a moment and allowed an evil spirit to come and anoint them and brother brandham said this right the bride has sins black spots that come and her spirit gets stained with these black spots but then of course by the grace of God we come to church where you might be at home and the Lord might lead you to listen to a certain sermon and now amen that spirit that black spot gets agitated by the washing of the Water by the word amen what is God doing God Is Lifting that stain praise God Amen so he can wash it off amen the deliver that Saint from that listen now temporary bondage the prophet said that a possession is when Satan comes and attaches himself to a person's spirit and that gives them unclean habits that they find themselves not being able to break away from cuz it's some place somehow they're yielding themselves to a devil through some Avenue you can't blame it on the devil cuz the devil can't make us do nothing how many say Amen to that we got the power of decision Saints to be able to resist the Bible say resist the devil and he'll free in order for a devil to come and stay somebody ain't resisting amen forgive me S oh God somebody's done yielded amen the enticements of the devil amen his selling he he got he got excellent salesman skills he can sell a thought to you glory to God why you think so many people Abiding and sin amen Satan done sold them he done presented it in such a way until it seems like they can't resist and they got to taste they got to touch they got to get in for a temporary appeasement it's the truth brother it's the truth Jesus he said now that's a possession he says but you can have somebody with the Holy Ghost that might just be oppressed that means that what I just talked about it's a spot at the Lord Lord got to come and help to clean you from can you bring that a little clear brother McBride when brother brandham lied that was in oppression that was a real demon that brother brandom yielded himself to and he carried out the lust of that Spirit can we say praise the Lord amen and as a result of that see oh God he amen he was connected to that young [Music] baby that needed help right brother and he went on to try to still pray for that baby and when he went to go and try to carry out his commission right God came in the same God of love the one that died on calvary's Cross for the sins of all of us us you understand the blood done been shed now but even with the blood present see many people don't understand what that means to be under the blood you understand because the prophet was right there and he went to lay hands on that baby and that voice came to him and said you going to lay your lying hands on that child God withheld his power oh glory amen from a man that flow that was able to tap into the channel of God on numerous occasions God withheld his power says and wouldn't release it Lord and didn't permit the prophet to pray amen because he yielded in a time of pressure wow wow wow now we talking about these things out here we want to bring it right home to every one of our hearts sir you talk about living your life for us Brothers what does that mean that mean doing good deeds you need some gas I come get you some gas brother you you need some eggs I got I got five cart you can come get four of them now you need some threads some clothes I can help you out what did Paul remind us of saints come on you can give your body to be burned you can give your Goods to the poor listen now it goes beyond that you can have faith to move mountains but if you don't have the Holy Ghost if you don't have a person of God himself inside of your soul controlling you causing you to live listen now except your righteousness exceed that of the Pharisees they didn't have the Holy Ghost where they were still trying to live the word by willpower amen glory but our righteousness got to exceed that it ain't a religious show we we depending on what crowd you with see depending on the environment you with that that dictates the behavior at times amen we're all a work in progress I'm not above nobody I told you this was preached to me right but depending on the environment you in that that determines what you allow to be released but we want to be real Christians amen we want to be real Christians we want to have a real love for God a real relationship with God we want to have real fellowship with God to a point to where no matter where we are no matter what's presented to you and I our love for God will be so high until nothing else can't catch our attention did not the prophet talk about that Shepherd that was leading those sheep and all those things those sheep love they were walking in the midst of but they refrain from satisfying their own desires because they were keeping their eyes on the shepherd that's the kind of love God want us to have for him to where the devil can't dangle Shake do nothing before us amen our hearts are pulled to attention and say I love my husband and you will keep going on in a faithful manner because of a love see the Bible says the love of God is shared abroad in all Hearts by the Holy Ghost amen amen so achen took the Garment he went and took the gold he saw silver he took silver and I want to I want to emphasize this because the holy spirit is helping me to do that right now he couldn't walk out right with it share it with nobody that's right he had to hide it in such a manner to nobody will take notice while he got his on his while he got it on his person while he's in the midst of the crime he might come in contact with a brother and he had to try to keep his composure tell the brother cuz he ain't want nothing to leak out holding it getting a cramp in his arm trying to hold it Lord have mercy trying to make sure that thing don't fall down cuz they ain't have no pants now that they fall right to the ground so that brother had to be mindful and when demons come on people and they're anointed listen now it makes them real super mindful and they make sure everything is covered real tight so when they come to church or when they see one of the Saints or whatever man everything is real tight they they ain't comfortable at all they very uncomfortable right and they hoping that they hurry up and leave that church hurry up and be over I want nobody asking me no qu I want nobody to pick up cuz when you in the presence of the Lord Saints you get uncomfortable why you think Adam and Eve ran God just came walking the voice of the Lord walking he always did that but what made the difference come on brother why did they try to hide cuz the spirit of the devil came on them amen truth so aen had to conceal it hold it real tight till he made it to his tent and once he made it to his tent what did he do Saints he buried it he knew it was there now they went ahead and went through Jericho just fine but now they had to go to AI wow so now they going to Ai and man they feeling good now they said man the Lord look at the Lord word came to pass just like he said the walls came down we destroyed everything like God said but listen now ain's actions had already taken effect yes sir and the people didn't even know it listen Joshua didn't even know it now they going against Ai and Joshua say well go scout out the land see what we need to be able to fight against these people they went over there and they was like man we got this place licked all we got to do is just take three th we ain't got to take many just take 3,000 people 3,000 men and they went up to take 3,000 and men they thought for sure see God UNT told us they weren't aware of the secret sin Lord Jesus now I'm going say a few things by the grace of God Saints anything you got to hide right you ain't got to ask nobody if it's wrong that's right praise the lord lord the very the very the very reason why you feeling to hide it you don't want nobody to know about it that's tested your your own soul is convicting you cuz you weren't made to live like [Applause] that especially when you bride sir I want to take it a little step further yes sir come on man this this this this this this this time of of technology wonderful wonderful marriage Workshop wonderful Wonder F but boy the Lord just went like I told you brother the Lord just went down into nooks and crannies man it was no place there ain't nothing hiding in that bro get right between the threads that was powerful it was necessary it was God right but listen now everybody that got cell phones all right on I'm saying this by by the grace of God because I love you and I want to be obedient go ahead if you have any contact in your phone that you can't put their real name in [Music] there speak Holy Ghost you got to you got to you got to disguise it in such a way until if anybody's around and they see that number come through they won't know it's really Rick or Judy they want to it's going to say um mcdonal oh Jesus Sam's Club grocery I say why why you got what contact is say grocery why you got a who who what is grocery oh that that just come through whenever they got a sale and they sending me they texting me the uh the the coupon huh that devil know how to bring people into a bondage and try to they want he want that individual to help him to hide you understand what I'm saying if you got any contacts in your phone that you got to hide the real name up delete that contact delete it Saints cuz guess what God already know who it is you ain't hearding it from nobody that's the truth you might get a temporary satisfaction that no human being might be able to know but the Holy Ghost knows brother brand said let us all be aware that no matter where you are and what you doing there is an invisible eye that's watching you everything is being [Music] recorded God can we say praise the Lord Lord thank you Hallelujah I'm free Saints I'm free hallelujah amen I'm preaching Saints I'm free I come to help somebody it's time to go home we are connected Saints I can't go until you come into your place you can't go until I come in my place I want to give my life for this word for this cause for my brother hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah it's good it's good to do good deeds give clothes pay for somebody dinner huh that's appreciated but what's the point in doing all of that and then you have a secret sin that secret sin is affecting everybody let's go here Saints everybody okay well I thank God for brother J Glory boy it Ain It Ain't Easy having to to deal with certain subject Saints it's been times where man Saints over the years boy even brother bradam yeah look at the things he had to deal with because he was yielded to God instead of people being able to see that it was healing coming forth the devil got in people's minds and made them be against the very physici not knowing that was God Veil ministering medicine yes sir glory to God brother Brandon said people sit in church and die because when the medicine comes forth he said they spit it out people don't I ain't goingon even go there yes you can yes you can let the Lord lead you adoption number one that's the message brother brandham says there's where the church is failing today he says on that walk on that walk do you know and this is the New Testament right we in New Testament times Within not too far not too long ago this is the Hol this ain't brother brandom now this is the Holy Ghost taking the time to emphasize these things so it can be recorded cuz he had to store up the food right cuz God knew that this food was going to be even for us in this day right Amen on that walk come on brother that's where the church is failing today on that walk he says do you do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed prayer requests come up people that you know of need healing and the prophet said because of our own misbehavior we might think we're just affecting ourselves but brother this just me it's just something I'm dealing with you know Lord don't don't judge the Lord dealing with me God want us to have the same care one for another right so living your life for others is talking about living your personal life in such a manner yes sir until you will your life will cause blessings and things that people really need in their lives to be able to freely come to them without causing in this case Their Blessings to be hindered sir he says our own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed right everybody understand that he goes on to say Saints your misbehavior of unconfessed sins listen to how he says this of you who believers right amongst the bride things that we're dealing with with too soft of a hand God been warning us and warning us and pleading with us the Holy Ghost has been longsuffering and we know it things listen the Lord deals with us he talks to us he lets you know what's wrong because you are bride he can't let you be comfortable what parent can see their child and wrong and be comfortable with them doing it that parent because they love that child they say that's going to hurt you down the road it might even hurt you much sooner than that it's already hurting you but it's going to it's going to hinder your growth it's going to in the Lord is going to hinder it it it'll mess up your whole future right yes amen you don't know what you playing with love will cause you to cry out amen why you think think the prophets cried out like they did it was the love of God coming down into those vessels and being expressed but look at how they were handled the very people God sent them to to help them they allowed the devil to give them a wrong mindset toward the very vessel being used and they kill the vessel yes sir Lord Jesus truth that's the mindset Devils want to bring they want to make you rebel against what's right thank you Jesus can we say praise the Lord Lord your misbehavior of unconfessed sin of you Believers can cause what this church anybody that has secret sin in your life do you believe this amen amen sir anybody that has secret sin in your life if you know it's there you could be this individual that caused the whole church to fail Joshua didn't know what Ain did all Joshua knew it was God promis yes sir and Joshua was faithful Joshua was steadfast Joshua loved the Lord but when they went against AI all of a sudden what wasn't supposed to happen is happening right God said no man will be able to stand before you now they're being defeated by the enemy and they're running down running now away from the enemy and 36 men listen Saints was killed aen was still alive the one that committed the sin was still alive these men had families these men were being obedient these men loved the Lord they were trying to keep the vision trying to go for the objective to satisfy God's desire and they died because achen wanted to satisfy his lust in a selfish frame of mind that that devil brought on him when Devils anoint people it makes them forget about everybody that's why people on drugs or whatever all they do is try to go for that hit they don't care they don't care if they steal or whatever they don't think about the repercussions of their decisions right a can still living 36 men dead it affected the whole group now everybody when they saw those men die they was like hold on hold on they ding hold on hold on we being defeated now the spirit of fear just gripped everybody and it paralyzed them amen they couldn't even go forward to another battle hold on Joshua we die we got men that die and Joshua this is the thing that caught me Saints Joshua is confused right oh my God Saints go back and read it yeah Joshua Joshua actually thought that God wasn't keeping his word Lord why did you how are we goingon to go forward the other countries when they hear about this he knew what God had said but he didn't know what aen had done so he saw defeat amongst his congregation brother and he knew that was wrong what's going on it made him question things that he should never have questioned so he fell on his face he was crying out to God lord what's this right here that's got taking place and God looking at Joshua and God said now hold on Joshua in order for you to act like that son you act like my word ain't true right you act like my promise ain't true but don't you remember what I told you before you even came in the land and you told Israel that so in order for this to take place there must be sin in the camp I told you that if they brought that a cursed thing back it was going to cause all of Israel to be a cursed and God said I'm not going to be with you no more Lord it caused the anointing of God to lift up off of the whole group because of the secret sin of one person I don't have to go much longer you got it living your life for others is living your personal life right not allowing the Devil to get any Foo whole like in whatever the devil has established in our lives this should make us go and rededicate our lives to God Amen and fight with everything that's within us because we ain't just affecting ourselves we're affecting our brother and our sister amen amen I'm going try to bring this down to a closed sentence he he says and they slayed he says the amorites the Hittites but there wasn't one her among among any of them until sin came into the camp and when achen took that Babylonian garment and that gold wedge and hid it under his Camp then the next day they lost and brother brandom say 16 but it was 36 he says stop stop wait a minute there's something wrong something's wrong here we're going to call a seven days fast he says God made us a promise he says there would be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere brother brandham says why did they die he says innocent man because one man stepped out of line he says you see the reason this needs to be taught yes sir I got a few things I want to share with share with you Saints listen the success of the body of Christ is dependent upon this and God is the father of us all you understand that so the Holy Ghost is coming through the land because when it was time God came down he anointed Joshua and God weave through the whole group of Israel until it brought it right down to Ain and when it brought it down to achen he says give glory to God son he says what have you done what is the purpose of the gift Saints to keep the church clean yes sir you understand listen now I'm telling you by the grace of God I believe what our prophet said by the spirit of God and those gifts are are listen now I believe those gifts are coming into view yes sir believe it yes sir where the Holy Ghost is going to anoint ordain individuals with the gifts that he's put into their souls you understand me and as they yield themselves to God God is going to bring help and health to every local assembly he's going to push those evil spirits right out they ain't going to have no place to hide you talk about another book of act God had to set the tone he had to let everybody know if you join yourself with this you better come clean in the New Testament once God made an example of Anan and Safara people were scared to come to church they ain't going to come to church any kind of way it made them straighten up pray him say you understand what I'm saying Glory Hallelujah once God made an example of aan he said give glory to to God Son why have you done this he said now because you troubled Israel we're going to trouble you listen to this he was connected with his family 36 men that wouldn't in his family died but now as a repercussion of what he did God call him and his family to be stoned and burned his wife didn't take it his children didn't take naked but their dad caused the whole family to die they were connected he says when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast he says call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it a few more things and we'll be done Saints everybody's okay I love you I mean that drove nine hours nine hours of Love H that's the truth praise God what is the works of God that's the name of the message brother brandom says my finger could never take the place of my ear no matter how much it tried neither could my mouth take the place of my eye he says but each member knows what it can do and he says this and all of them coordinating together makes the body move if this church can only see that if you can only see that it takes takes coordination it takes cooperation with all the body of Christ now the message humble ourself when I read when the Lord helped me to I done heard that message I don't know how many times but he honed me in on this one piece right here and this is actually where did this was the beginnings of this particular inspiration here Saints brother says in paragraph 73 of humble thyself he says I was thinking here listen to this very carefully now I was thinking here of one of of one little illustration to back up what he said he says now we look at this watch he says to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating he says one with the other we'll never know the correct time he says is that right he says and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God he says it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God confess our wrong and pray and believe God for these things and we want to see the Third pull come and do something for God he said it takes coordination amen Heavenly places adoption number one oh what could happen tonight what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere and the holy ghost moving o over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus all sins under the blood imp perfect work worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted SE setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in Heavenly places blessing us with what Divine Healing for knowledge Revelation excuse me Visions Powers tongues interpretations wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of Glory every heart filled with the spirit amen amen doing what Saints walking together setting together in Heavenly places listen not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought come on nobody got anything against one another no Schism in the body that's the Bible right nobody got one thing against another everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord in one place then suddenly there came from Heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind there you are has been blessed with all spiritual blessings amen praise God that's it thank you Jesus all right I'mma taper it down right here there's two things that stood out to me that I believe the Lord directed me to that kind of helped to clench this in my heart remember he says your behavior can knock somebody else out of healing that's what he said your behavior also can bring disease on somebody you're connected toen I'm going give you evidence The Messengers called how the angel came to me and his commission starting at paragraph 293 there is a lady sitting right back and she this is a service that's going on and the Holy Spirit is moving now there is a lady sitting right back over there in the corner and I see that light hanging over her that's the only way I can tell what about it he says that light's hanging this light right here is hanging over the lady he says maybe be just in a minute if I can see what it is it'll break the lady at listen Saints is suffering with a heart trouble she's looking right to me he says and her husband is sitting next to her and her husband has got some sickness he's been he says he's just been upset sick upset sick he says isn't that right sir raise your hands up if that's true that's right he says it's you lady with the little scarf there the mister he says is isn't that right haven't you been just kind of upset today you have upset in your stomach the man that's right he says you all he says believe with all your heart both of you he says you accept it sir I tell you now this is how God was dealing with the tribe of Israel right or rather with all of Israel and he was Discerning bringing it down to the problem area now he's already said the sister got a heart trouble but now the holy spirit is going to the root of what it is that cause her heart trouble he says here you believe with all your heart both of you you accept it sir I tell you you too I see you with your hand up the habit of smoking he says quit doing that you smoke cigars you don't do that makes you sick isn't that right if it is wave your hand like this he says that's what sub setting you it's bad on your nerves I thought smoking was good for your nerves Lord they selling all these cigarettes watch this he said it's bad on your nerves throw nasty things away and don't do it no more and you will get over that and be all right listen to this Saints he says and your wife's heart trouble will leave her connect oh my when his wife first start having heart trouble she laid beside him every day for weeks and months and years and he would go out go out back maybe on the patio and light up his cigars put a certain flavor or something in there whatever however they do it and then he just go out there and just look at the sky and feel the breeze and he's just enjoying his Puffs pop pop pop Let the Smoke come up sniff the aroma and I as as he's puffing as he's out on that patio as he's enjoying himself something is changing in his wife's body she in there cooking dinner probably listening to a gospel song huh and all of a sudden something starts changing in her to the point it becomes noticeable she start feeling certain feelings whatever led to it or whatever she was like honey something a right I'm not feeling right my heart something's going on with my heart I I don't know what it is and that's his baby that's his wife right he's like honey oh you know oh man are you okay or whatever you know all right let's let's go to the doctor to see what the doctor say so they go the doctor's visits running up hospital bills going to a doctor trying to find help for his wife he caused it to come on his wife Jesus the doctor couldn't help with that it took the Holy Ghost through a Divine physician to come down in the midst of the people and God LED that couple you understand they were children of God God LED that couple to come to that particular service and the Holy Ghost wasn't going to let them leave without being dealt with so that light went and hung over her other people needed help but God wanted to deal with this situation can we say praise the Lord Saints he says you believe that isn't that right he says I can't see you from here and you know that but you're carrying cigars in your pocket in the front he couldn't even see the God he says that's right lay the things out and put your hand over on your wife tell God that you are through with that kind of stuff listen and you will go home well and you and you and your wife will get well Jesus that little habit he was connected to his wife's heart condition he was the cause and he was The Cure this last one Saints and I'mma to close on this there was a young girl this message here is called the greatest battle ever fought it was a young girl who was diagnosed with hodkin disease it's a very dangerous disease she was dealing with it it would appear it would cause formations in certain areas of her body and then those and I'll just read a little piece here a little girl come here he says not long ago from high school her mother called me up said brother Brandon my girls got hodkin disease that's cancer forms and lumps and the doctors took a piece from a break on her throat and that's a demon in demonology the prophet showed how demons because they don't have their own body once they get into the human body they start making all these strange formations right that was a devil inside of her daughter amen watch this he says that's cancer forming lumps and the doctors took a piece from the break over her throat on her throat sent it away and it was perfectly Harkins disease he said the next one breaks may break over her heart when it does she's gone said she hasn't got the way they're breaking she's got anywhere about 3 months to live the mother said what shall I do send her back to school he said let her go because she'll probably go suddenly she'll Pro she'll go probably suddenly and said this uh just let her go on and live a normal life and and she can as she can don't tell her nothing about it so so the lady said to me what must I do the son of man rising with healing in his wings my God I said bring her up uh bring her up and put her in the prayer line and I said you come with her I felt the little funny feeling she wanted to understand what was causing this disease he says and when the little girl came by that morning with blue looking lips and makeup he says as a school has them and the little thing come by I didn't know who she'd be he says was going to call me on the phone I took a hold of her hand I said good morning sister there was there she was that was her just in a few moments looked down to her mother and seen them both without god without Christ I said how can you expect healing on these grounds will you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior I said will you come to this pool here and be baptized in in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins they said we will do that oh you know what happened the woman may be sitting here this morning many of you know the case brother Mike Eagan one of the trustees here watch the case that's been about four or five years ago the little girl was took back to the doctor not even one trace of Harkins disease was found in her what was the Cure The Cure wasn't in the hospital the kill was in her mother that's right when they gave when when they gave their lives over to God that devil had to leave you want to see a real Revival Saints well what is a Revival it's dashing out all the trash this ain't the if I can say it in this way this ain't no special service like that but it's is here here to bring a Revival I'm going say it in this way a

our lives Liv to the Lord and um just just I think the Holy Spirit was just too too perfect what I heard the Holy Ghost say today in your cell phone if there is anybody in your cell phone that you can't put their name to it it need to be deleted not next week it's got to happen today and um I mean you um God God has spoken this place uh and uh anything that you might be hiding any secret sin this is a time where you Lord I'm sorry uh forgive me uh it's a time of repentance uh because you don't want to see anybody hindered from you know getting what they need from God uh we got sister Capers out there Desiring to be back in the house of the Lord I went out to see them the other day and you know she's she had some good days some bad days and I think on next Saturday she'll be 82 years old uh but what I've learned is that God did not put a age limit on healing we don't think in our mind well she 82 no no no no God still want he says my will for her to be in good health and to prosper even as a soul prospers but if our misbehavior is hindering our sister from being healed let this be a a warning that you take heed to don't let it be just another sermon that come and go and
