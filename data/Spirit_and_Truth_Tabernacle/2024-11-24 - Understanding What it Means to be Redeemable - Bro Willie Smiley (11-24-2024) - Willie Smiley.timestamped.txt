[58:29] of God we'll be all
[58:30] right it says the sixth verse he says
[58:33] now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[58:37] therefore being uh weary with his
[58:39] journey sat thus on the well and it was
[58:43] about the sixth hour and there cometh a
[58:47] woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus
[58:50] said unto her give me the drink uh for
[58:54] his disciples were gone away until to
[58:56] the city to buy meat then said the woman
[59:00] of Samaria unto him how is it that thou
[59:03] being a Jew asks it drink of me which is
[59:07] a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no
[59:10] dealings with the samarians Jesus
[59:13] answered and said unto her if thou
[59:15] knoweth the gift of God and who it is
[59:18] that saith to thee give me to
[59:21] drink thou would not have asked him and
[59:25] he would have given thee Living Water
[59:28] the woman said unto him sir thou H has
[59:31] nothing to draw with and the well is
[59:33] deep for w then has has thou that Living
[59:36] Water art thou greater than our father
[59:39] Jacob which gave us the well and drank
[59:42] thereof himself and his children and his
[59:46] cattle and Jesus answered and said unto
[59:48] her who soever drinketh of this water
[59:52] shall thirst again but whosoever
[59:54] drinketh of the water that I have given
[59:57] him shall never thirst but the water
[59:59] that I give him shall be in him a well
[1:00:02] of water springing up into everlasting
[1:00:05] life and the woman said unto him sir
[1:00:08] give me this water that I thirst not
[1:00:11] neither come hither to draw and Jesus
[1:00:14] said unto her go call thy husband and
[1:00:17] come hither may the Lord out a blessing
[1:00:20] to his word this morning you may be
[1:00:22] seat may be
[1:00:24] seated uh this morning IID like to uh
[1:00:28] use as a
[1:00:30] topic um un understanding what it means
[1:00:34] to be
[1:00:37] redeemable uh we we realize that we're
[1:00:40] we're coming down to the close of uh
[1:00:43] another year this probably be my last
[1:00:46] sermon for the year but uh we we've had
[1:00:50] a a just some wonderful studies on on
[1:00:54] Redemption and and restoration and uh
[1:00:58] the Brethren bringing the word through
[1:01:01] their their different perspectives and
[1:01:04] and uh uh the pastor bringing his his
[1:01:08] points just trying to seow seeds to uh
[1:01:12] make sure that we're in the word is that
[1:01:15] right and uh just watching the
[1:01:18] supernatural uh uh moving amongst us
[1:01:22] people being being healed and uh you
[1:01:25] know gifts and operation and uh I
[1:01:28] believe that you know uh when the
[1:01:32] prophet was on the scene the different
[1:01:33] ones they they talk to the prophet about
[1:01:37] his teachings and everything and and the
[1:01:39] gifts and stuff like that moving in the
[1:01:41] body and uh he said it was kind of like
[1:01:45] for for a day gone by these things just
[1:01:49] only uh happened through the ministry of
[1:01:53] the Apostles well brother brownon makes
[1:01:56] a statement I think that's astounding he
[1:01:59] said well I can show you where Jesus
[1:02:01] placed these things in there you show me
[1:02:05] a scripture where he ever took things
[1:02:08] out is that right we we know the the
[1:02:12] understanding and the mentality of
[1:02:14] humanity takes things out they take
[1:02:17] things away we we if if you have any
[1:02:20] sort of understanding you could see
[1:02:23] where uh Society and and
[1:02:28] christiandom um of today has taken so
[1:02:32] much away from the word and and the word
[1:02:35] has pretty much lost its its
[1:02:38] meaning it's pretty much lost its
[1:02:42] Effectiveness and I think that's been a
[1:02:45] part that was I ain't thinking I know
[1:02:47] that that was a what uh Malachi for's
[1:02:52] Ministry was to bring back all of the
[1:02:55] things things that that were in the
[1:02:57] alpha church and the Omega Church can we
[1:03:00] say amen amen um and thinking about this
[1:03:04] this thought this
[1:03:05] morning um you know I I'm real different
[1:03:09] I guess in my approach to the word of
[1:03:11] God and what I see and and and and uh
[1:03:15] how you know I move I guess it's just my
[1:03:18] experiences and being around um being
[1:03:22] around Church from Brother Wesco to
[1:03:24] brother James and and uh ministering on
[1:03:27] my own for 20 some years you know
[1:03:31] you a lot of things I'm not moved
[1:03:34] by you know I shout if you I get excited
[1:03:39] and things of that nature but I re I
[1:03:41] realize at the end of the day things has
[1:03:43] got to go further than that is that
[1:03:47] right that's a part of it we not going
[1:03:49] to take that out of it even the prophet
[1:03:52] was a he was a real critic of of all of
[1:03:55] the emot isms and things of that nature
[1:03:58] till one day he got happy in
[1:04:01] church right amen and so I like to be
[1:04:05] happy in church cuz I that's how I grew
[1:04:07] up I was talking to a guy in Golden
[1:04:09] Corral um on last night he works there
[1:04:13] and he always give me a free meal pass
[1:04:15] and I be like thank you
[1:04:17] Jesus and uh I told him I said man the
[1:04:20] other night uh I saw you on the vide one
[1:04:23] of the churches uh they were on Facebook
[1:04:25] book and he was in the crowd they was
[1:04:27] having some celebration for 100 Years of
[1:04:30] the church and he was sitting there they
[1:04:32] just he would by he was turning around
[1:04:34] and he was looking lost he said yeah man
[1:04:37] my wife church he said man I grew up
[1:04:41] Pentecostal y'all know you know it's
[1:04:44] it's a little bit more it's a little bit
[1:04:46] different now you do have some Baptist
[1:04:48] churches and you got some Methodist
[1:04:50] churches they know how to get it in they
[1:04:53] ain't all starchy and but they do have a
[1:04:56] lot of formalities and and different
[1:04:58] things but Pentecostals you know of the
[1:05:01] old days they they just knew how to get
[1:05:05] in the spirit you know I saw that that
[1:05:08] sister last week she was she was Boy
[1:05:11] look like she was ready to tear the
[1:05:13] building down I I don't know who she I
[1:05:16] think one of the Saints brought I said
[1:05:18] now see she she got something you know
[1:05:22] they asked the prophet uh about that
[1:05:24] well and and yeah what's what's causing
[1:05:27] you to Bubble he say it was
[1:05:30] something oh y'all ought to preach with
[1:05:33] me this morning I'm I'm moving slow this
[1:05:34] morning because I got to get the Flesh
[1:05:37] and the spirit to preach cuz I'm I'm a
[1:05:40] little woozy and tired and a little
[1:05:43] everything but you know I feel like
[1:05:45] brother Brandon with the 80y old man
[1:05:48] once the spirit of God hit him he jumped
[1:05:51] up in the air and it just and after a
[1:05:53] while I might be down this AIS I ain't

[1:06:30] don't you know but he he had it but uh
[1:06:37] you know my my Approach and my objective
[1:06:39] is is that we we we we want we want for
[1:06:43] people to be stable to be anchored to
[1:06:48] have a a a clear understanding of of
[1:06:52] what you
[1:06:53] got right who who's your
[1:06:56] Association and and why you associating
[1:07:00] you know what I'm saying be because
[1:07:02] there there's so much
[1:07:04] instability right but but you you you
[1:07:07] want and I believe that's been brother
[1:07:10] Jack's objective is to make sure that
[1:07:12] we're
[1:07:14] clear that that this word is not a
[1:07:18] mystery because all the mysteries of God
[1:07:20] we know has been uh
[1:07:23] revealed but it's and it's a it's an
[1:07:27] individual thing this morning and God
[1:07:29] deals with us as
[1:07:31] individuals it it's the it don't matter
[1:07:34] you your grandparents your your parents
[1:07:37] as an individuals these young people
[1:07:40] they have to be
[1:07:41] clear they have to be clear on their
[1:07:46] understanding of the word for themselves
[1:07:50] be because if they're not there they can
[1:07:52] be persuaded they could be they could be
[1:07:55] influenced by the outside world they
[1:07:58] could be influenced by by by home
[1:08:02] statuses and things of that nature you
[1:08:05] you got to have an individual stand if
[1:08:08] nobody going I'm
[1:08:10] going is that right because God is
[1:08:13] dealing with us as
[1:08:15] individual as individuals our
[1:08:19] understanding has got to be individual
[1:08:22] understanding and and you may not you
[1:08:24] may not be able to uh Express to other
[1:08:30] people what you believe but you you got
[1:08:34] to be anchored somewhere you got
[1:08:37] somewhere you got to drive a stake
[1:08:39] somewhere you you got to say like the
[1:08:42] disciples they couldn't fully
[1:08:45] grasp um uh all of the things that that
[1:08:49] Jesus was doing in his preaching they
[1:08:52] couldn't explain it they couldn't grasp
[1:08:56] it except you eat of My Flesh and drink
[1:08:59] of my blood they could not explain it
[1:09:02] they never did explain
[1:09:05] it it it took a a prophet to come on the
[1:09:08] scene to explain it right Paul but they
[1:09:12] couldn't explain it and and see because
[1:09:16] they were
[1:09:18] redeemable they they were able to you
[1:09:21] know uh uh uh stand flat footed with
[1:09:25] Jesus where we where are we going seeing
[1:09:29] you alone have the words of eternal life
[1:09:33] where where am I
[1:09:34] going my my world's turned upside down
[1:09:38] but where am I going all right right I'm
[1:09:42] I'm not sure about who I am as a person
[1:09:44] especially when you're young but you
[1:09:47] know there that's cuz see in our early
[1:09:50] in our early days that there's something
[1:09:54] about it that uh I couldn't comprehend I
[1:09:57] didn't
[1:09:59] understand right as it related to the
[1:10:02] message I couldn't put things together
[1:10:05] at that time all right and and I thought
[1:10:09] I thought that I I I could you know run
[1:10:11] away and I went up to Virginia and
[1:10:14] everything and and my world got turned
[1:10:16] upside down even more and I had to come
[1:10:18] back that was one of the happiest
[1:10:21] moments in my life you know finding my
[1:10:24] way back you know at that time I was
[1:10:26] still at brother
[1:10:27] Wesco and uh you know I I I left but I
[1:10:32] took the word with me I had a I had a
[1:10:35] suitcase with every book I
[1:10:38] owned I still prayed I still studied but
[1:10:43] but you know I knew deep down inside you
[1:10:45] know I still had that link with you know
[1:10:48] brother Char and brother you know
[1:10:50] especially at that time brother Jack
[1:10:52] because you know we were bll and buddies
[1:10:53] neither one of us was married at the
[1:10:55] time or anything and uh uh we would
[1:10:58] constantly you know stay in touch and
[1:11:02] and you
[1:11:03] know it it was it was because you know
[1:11:07] that I was predestinate even though I
[1:11:10] didn't understand I knew it was
[1:11:12] something about the message that it was
[1:11:15] real because of my personal
[1:11:20] experience but but one one thing exper
[1:11:24] experience alone won't do
[1:11:28] it right you cuz see I've watched people
[1:11:32] have experiences yeah Jor wine
[1:11:36] experience not taken away from the
[1:11:38] experience crying on the Altar and and
[1:11:41] and all of that and we used to do that
[1:11:43] kind of stuff in the meetings cry on
[1:11:45] each other right brother Troy we used
[1:11:48] toot on each other and
[1:11:51] crying but we didn't have no
[1:11:54] knowledge right
[1:11:55] we didn't have no understanding and I
[1:11:57] still to this day I I always remember
[1:11:59] being in a meeting with brother Coleman
[1:12:02] and he making a statement from the
[1:12:04] message and from the scripture that
[1:12:07] you're going to understand it and that
[1:12:10] was the thing that I helped on to you
[1:12:14] know trying to search for for for
[1:12:19] understanding right I'm just kind of
[1:12:21] building I'm starting to feel my way now
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:26] uh uh just trying to trying to
[1:12:30] understand I remember working with
[1:12:32] sister burs back in the day and and you
[1:12:34] know we we all had been around for a few
[1:12:37] years them a little bit longer than me
[1:12:39] and I still always remember her asking
[1:12:41] me a question about some of the doctrine
[1:12:44] and I could just only I could only go on
[1:12:48] what I've been hearing but it wasn't
[1:12:50] something that that translated it wasn't
[1:12:54] something that Dr St from here into here
[1:12:57] and was quickened right so I was like
[1:13:00] Christ and she looked at me like yeah I
[1:13:03] understand that part but you know that's
[1:13:05] been said and and it took
[1:13:09] time you know for God to get me in the
[1:13:13] right
[1:13:14] place because amen I was a
[1:13:19] redeemable right I'm I'm going make a
[1:13:22] hard statement and and people don't like
[1:13:24] you know they think well you know the
[1:13:26] marage do you know gu you guys are
[1:13:28] arrogant and all that's not the case it
[1:13:30] has nothing to do with being arrogant it
[1:13:33] has everything to do amen with our
[1:13:37] understanding of the word and realizing
[1:13:40] you know just like just like um
[1:13:44] Noah or Moses right um he realize after
[1:13:50] his
[1:13:51] experience and his Revelation that was
[1:13:54] given to him at the burning
[1:13:56] bush that that you know what his place
[1:14:00] was his position and his purpose is that
[1:14:03] right and see you know we we went on for
[1:14:06] some time but we we it just those things
[1:14:10] diff didn't you know and even a lot of
[1:14:12] things that uh sitting under my second
[1:14:15] Pastor I still didn't
[1:14:17] grasp
[1:14:20] right it it's a lot of things that I
[1:14:22] didn't grasp until I had to start
[1:14:24] pastoring and then that puts you under a
[1:14:26] whole another level of pressure to make
[1:14:30] sure that that the thing that you're
[1:14:34] ministering is clear to you
[1:14:38] first that that that you haven't
[1:14:41] understanding of these things
[1:14:43] first right before you can present these
[1:14:47] people and then the pressure realizing
[1:14:49] that you know what I'm going be held
[1:14:52] accountable see and these are the things
[1:14:55] that that I hear when when I'm listening
[1:14:57] to a tape or something you you you
[1:15:00] follow the the the passion and the Heart
[1:15:02] of the Prophet when when he's bringing
[1:15:05] something you know when he was bringing
[1:15:07] the seals and all the church ages you
[1:15:10] could hear in his heart realizing
[1:15:13] there's a lot of pressure that goes
[1:15:15] along with with what I'm doing so I I
[1:15:19] got to make sure that I'm clear as
[1:15:22] possible that it's real to me right
[1:15:25] right and trusting God to express it in
[1:15:27] a way that that the people can grasp it
[1:15:31] right you know we got a younger
[1:15:33] generation um that's coming up and one
[1:15:36] day you know these young guys going to
[1:15:38] be the deacons of the church you know
[1:15:41] they're going to be the Ministers of the
[1:15:43] church and so we're under the
[1:15:45] pressure right to make sure that what
[1:15:49] we're what we're preaching is the
[1:15:53] gospel that that we're pre reaching
[1:15:56] seed right we we don't want to cut the
[1:15:59] seed seed open and splice it and inject
[1:16:03] something because you know it'll produce
[1:16:06] it'll produce a bigger better it'll
[1:16:08] produce a a a a nice
[1:16:11] church right look just look around
[1:16:15] us right amen you can high
[1:16:20] breed is what we talking about see you
[1:16:24] could the prophet preached hybrd
[1:16:26] religion and he he preached on hybrid
[1:16:29] corn and all of these different things
[1:16:32] he preached on you know uh uh the Citrus
[1:16:36] life and and how you can take because
[1:16:39] it's Citrus a orange tree and splice and
[1:16:44] it'll you you go out there and it's got
[1:16:47] It's got tangelo it's got you know uh
[1:16:50] grapefruits and different things and you
[1:16:52] it's like this is crazy no it's it's
[1:16:55] living it's it's it's living of a citrus
[1:17:01] life but it's bearing fruit of his
[1:17:06] kind right amen amen and see this is the
[1:17:09] thing that you know people don't
[1:17:12] understand when when they when they hear
[1:17:14] you preach and things of that
[1:17:17] nature with with what we see around us
[1:17:21] they're living off of a a life but
[1:17:25] bearing another kind of
[1:17:29] fruit I'm feeling like preaching
[1:17:32] now see amen everybody's got got a title
[1:17:37] and a name and everybody say that
[1:17:39] they're Christians and things of that
[1:17:41] nature right but uh
[1:17:45] unfortunately everybody's not
[1:17:48] redeemable see uh and and we came up in
[1:17:51] a day where where you know you could buy
[1:17:55] soda and the bottle was the bottle was
[1:17:58] redeemable you could take it back and
[1:18:01] get your money
[1:18:02] back but but here's the thing every
[1:18:05] bottle wasn't
[1:18:07] redeemable see like like today like
[1:18:11] today it's it's it's still maybe not in
[1:18:14] the United States but in some countries
[1:18:17] you'll see in fine printing on the
[1:18:19] bottle
[1:18:21] redeemable see even even in after the
[1:18:25] contents of the bottle has been empti
[1:18:28] the bottle oh y'all ought to come on
[1:18:29] talk to
[1:18:30] me y'all ought to wake up now this
[1:18:33] morning I know it's a little chilly
[1:18:35] outside but it shouldn't be chilly in
[1:18:38] here right it it says
[1:18:43] redeemable so so you know um be because
[1:18:47] folks are saying that they're Christian
[1:18:49] now we G we gonna tie this back to
[1:18:51] scripture right amen see everything that
[1:18:55] we're
[1:18:56] preaching and everything that the
[1:18:58] prophet preached he was able to bring it
[1:19:01] out of scripture he could he could see
[1:19:05] in between the lines whereas people
[1:19:08] could see something on the
[1:19:10] surface right what what what belonged to
[1:19:13] him was in between the lines and see
[1:19:17] that's been the problem of people from
[1:19:20] his ministry and on down where people
[1:19:24] people people you know struggle to grasp
[1:19:28] the knowledge of what's amen been been
[1:19:32] presented to us that was in between the
[1:19:35] lines right that that only you know the
[1:19:39] wife is privy to yes sir come on church
[1:19:44] cuz he said he write his you know he'll
[1:19:47] write a letter and things of that nature
[1:19:49] and he get to somebody and and and you
[1:19:52] know uh he said where you wife said this
[1:19:55] and your wife said that and he read the
[1:19:57] letter say oh it's a lot deeper than
[1:20:00] that right it's a lot deeper it's like
[1:20:04] uh uh Joseph is cutting up and and Sarah
[1:20:08] and and I miss you and I need you to
[1:20:11] come home and chastise these
[1:20:14] children because y'all know what I'm
[1:20:16] talking about children respond different
[1:20:18] to the
[1:20:20] father right amen the children they
[1:20:23] they'll respond whole lot different to
[1:20:25] the father than they do to Mama they'll
[1:20:27] back talk to Mama a little bit
[1:20:29] especially them boys when they start
[1:20:30] getting a little age and start smelling
[1:20:33] themselves right right now today my
[1:20:36] Justin will be 30 I think this year and
[1:20:39] Justin they they don't that ain't F to

[1:22:37] dump glory to God you know and then he

[1:23:55] to be pushed on too much I'll fight a
[1:24:00] bully yeah because of the principle
[1:24:04] because because because you feel like
[1:24:07] amen you're something that you really
[1:24:09] not you just got some issues and
[1:24:12] everybody ain't scared of
[1:24:14] you let me keep going on I ain't going

[1:24:19] thought but but you know I'm I'm still
[1:24:22] working y'all we we got time I still got
[1:24:24] a little time um and and and you know
[1:24:28] and thinking about this I'm I'm always
[1:24:30] thinking about the Young Generation and
[1:24:32] want to make sure that there're stable
[1:24:34] good people good hearts and things of
[1:24:36] that nature uh uh but but you you want
[1:24:40] for their experience to be
[1:24:44] personal that's right be
[1:24:47] personal right where where they know
[1:24:50] that you know what I'm standing on this
[1:24:52] for
[1:24:53] me see I'm doing this for me see if my
[1:24:57] parents turn back that ain't got nothing
[1:24:59] to do with me they got to work out their
[1:25:02] own soul salvation with fear and
[1:25:05] trembling right if my sister go back
[1:25:08] that ain't got nothing to do with me
[1:25:11] right if none of my siblings and none of
[1:25:12] my this and Co that that what does that
[1:25:15] have to only thing that I can do is pray
[1:25:17] for

[1:25:23] it's got to be person
[1:25:25] that's right right it it cuz see the the
[1:25:28] Bible is a prophetic book it's a
[1:25:31] mysterious book and everybody ain't

[1:28:01] time okay there we go now watch this in
[1:28:05] in the message of uh the Mighty God
[1:28:07] unveil before us
[1:28:10] 1964
[1:28:11] uh trying to give us a paragraph
[1:28:15] here I ain't got it but it says it
[1:28:18] starts out God in the beginning was life
[1:28:21] he said and the Eternal one in him and
[1:28:25] and see we we gotta begin to um uh just
[1:28:30] just
[1:28:32] follow uh the the thoughts of the word
[1:28:36] right amen that that's that's always
[1:28:39] been for me something behind the
[1:28:42] statements that the prophet of God makes
[1:28:44] right and he always would take us back
[1:28:47] to before Genesis 1 and one right glory
[1:28:51] to God and and for the Young Generation
[1:28:54] for all of us we we got to be able to go
[1:28:57] all the way back before let there be
[1:29:01] back to to the thoughts that was in his
[1:29:03] mind right he says in him was attributes
[1:29:07] and those attributes became
[1:29:10] words and and the word became flesh he
[1:29:15] says Jesus was the
[1:29:18] Redeemer and the redeem means to bring
[1:29:22] back he says if he has to bring it back
[1:29:26] it had to be somewhere to be brought
[1:29:30] back
[1:29:31] to right amen now we ain't necessarily
[1:29:35] trying to go back to to his mind but in
[1:29:38] his mind his stinking brought everything
[1:29:42] to the Earth right right amen he says if
[1:29:46] he has to bring it back it it had to be
[1:29:50] somewhere to be brought back to he say
[1:29:53] so you see
[1:29:54] all people will never be able to see it
[1:30:00] we still working that's
[1:30:03] hard all people will not be able to see
[1:30:09] it right because all people wasn't in
[1:30:15] the beginning in his in God's thoughts
[1:30:20] see that's a that's a powerful statement
[1:30:24] amen right amen not
[1:30:27] eternally now now yeah God God
[1:30:32] saw right he knew who would be here and
[1:30:35] and everything that would be done but

[1:31:16] you the the right information so that
[1:31:20] you could make an in informed

[1:31:28] feelings and flesh and things of that

[1:32:03] can't make anybody do anything you know
[1:32:07] uh you you you can only pray and things
[1:32:09] of that nature and and just thank God
[1:32:13] right that that you were in his thoughts
[1:32:16] in the beginning and if they were in his
[1:32:19] thoughts in the beginning there'll be
[1:32:21] where he has ordained for them to be in
[1:32:24] that
[1:32:25] season right glory to God well they over
[1:32:28] here and they doing this and it's so it
[1:32:31] ain't okay but it's okay you got to you

[1:32:36] with adults you got to let them make
[1:32:38] adult choices and decisions you can't

[1:33:10] ordained to be a part of the bride's
[1:33:13] body come on Church come on church this
[1:33:16] deep preaching

[1:39:50] looked at her like she was trash but if
[1:39:52] she was much trash you
[1:39:56] know you you see how people think
[1:39:59] sometimes Righttime it's
[1:40:02] like our mentality you know uh they
[1:40:07] didn't want to be identified and because
[1:40:09] I guess the laws and things you know she
[1:40:11] had to come out uh uh at a certain time

[1:43:59] while come I'm going be done right it's
[1:44:02] the truth be because you you you can see
[1:44:06] now more than in the 60s in the 70s cuz
[1:44:11] I I'll be honest with you in the 70s in
[1:44:14] the 60s folk dressed

[1:44:37] uncle them walking down with they little
[1:44:40] swaggle with they hat tilted to the side
[1:44:42] they go to the bar to get drunk yeah but
[1:44:45] they had Integrity somebody know what
[1:44:47] I'm talking
[1:44:48] about when even when we went to school
[1:44:51] you know um especially when I was up
[1:44:54] north man people went to school dressed
[1:44:57] up with
[1:44:59] gators gators and and ostriches and all
[1:45:02] of that y'all don't talk to me man I had
[1:45:06] guys and we was a little bit poor cuz my
[1:45:08] dad drunk you know he drunk up all the
[1:45:10] money so I couldn't dress but I used to
[1:45:12] admire them guys be like God D what up
[1:45:16] boy boy got Gators on even if they had
[1:45:18] to borrow sometime for the big
[1:45:21] brother have one of my friends named
[1:45:23] darl Washington he about the size of his
[1:45:26] older brother so he throwing his
[1:45:28] brother's clothes but but that was the
[1:45:30] error but but you you look at you just
[1:45:33] look at the
[1:45:34] spirit and and we couldn't grasp things
[1:45:38] back then that we we we see now where
[1:45:41] the prophets talked about you could
[1:45:44] prove that you've never committed
[1:45:46] adultery but the spirit on you based
[1:45:49] upon the way that you dress is a
[1:45:51] prostitute spirit
[1:45:53] yes amen right it's it's the spirit
[1:45:57] that's on
[1:45:59] you you know you see the things
[1:46:01] provocative and all of this stuff that
[1:46:03] the folk come out with they never would
[1:46:06] have wore that stuff in the
[1:46:08] 70s it's the truth everybody was trying
[1:46:11] to everybody was trying to look look
[1:46:13] good put your finest on Sunday go to
[1:46:16] meetings uh close
[1:46:18] on huh now we want to see how sexy right
[1:46:24] right bosoms out back out everything out
[1:46:29] nothing to the
[1:46:31] imagination right now he just you know
[1:46:35] let me leave that alone Lord have mercy
[1:46:39] see that's one of the spirits that's
[1:46:42] been prophetic for the age if I get to
[1:46:46] it uh uh uh Revelation chapter 3 where
[1:46:51] it talks about uh uh
[1:46:54] um people being blind wretched and
[1:46:58] naked and and not really even you
[1:47:02] know they not even knowing it yeah
[1:47:07] listen there's there's been such you
[1:47:09] know thank God there's been a holy Veil
[1:47:12] placed upon our
[1:47:14] eyes right but there's a
[1:47:18] Unholy where they don't people don't
[1:47:21] recognize
[1:47:23] the spirit that's on them come on church
[1:47:28] and to me it this has always been
[1:47:32] crazy if some if if a young man come
[1:47:35] into your room while you trying to get
[1:47:37] dressed and you're in your
[1:47:38] underclothes right you'll cover up and
[1:47:41] scre go go right then go right to the
[1:47:48] beach what sense does that make you will
[1:47:52] go right right to the beach in a
[1:47:57] two-piece and you just screamed his head
[1:48:00] off what's the difference in the
[1:48:04] attire nothing really
[1:48:10] nothing well let me preach let
[1:48:16] me but but okay getting back on on on
[1:48:20] this woman at the wellb when when you
[1:48:22] look at her you wouldn't think that
[1:48:25] looking at her and and all of her flaws
[1:48:28] and her failures and what she's gone
[1:48:31] through and The Whispers And and
[1:48:34] everything to think that the son of man
[1:48:37] would come to her yes right would come
[1:48:41] to her not just come to her but she she
[1:48:45] would have something in her that was
[1:48:49] redeemable yes right that they did not
[1:48:53] have so so sometime we look at but they
[1:48:56] say they listen let me tell you
[1:48:59] something let me let me tell you
[1:49:00] something you know who missed Christ the
[1:49:03] religious people church
[1:49:06] folk church folk people that was going
[1:49:09] to church and so-called looking for amen
[1:49:12] the first coming they were the ones who
[1:49:15] totally totally missed
[1:49:18] it right but it it was it was these
[1:49:22] people people fishermen and people that
[1:49:26] you wouldn't think that would grasp it
[1:49:30] that wouldn't understand
[1:49:34] understood when he makes simple
[1:49:37] statements that they grasped and held on
[1:49:40] to right but then the prophet he makes a
[1:49:43] statement in the Mighty God
[1:49:45] unveil uh I think it's is it might be uh
[1:49:49] verse 72 he says but look at the
[1:49:53] priests right the priests they were the
[1:49:56] religious men they were the the the men
[1:49:59] that were supposed to be guiding the
[1:50:02] people reading the Scrolls to the people
[1:50:06] that was that was studied that were
[1:50:09] learned
[1:50:10] men right they didn't get
[1:50:14] it they didn't get it he says but when
[1:50:17] they see him expressing him ex exactly
[1:50:22] with the
[1:50:23] word right that's
[1:50:26] key that's key I'm going tell you some
[1:50:29] church now this this Beyond just being
[1:50:31] excited right
[1:50:33] see because if you miss the word you
[1:50:36] miss Christ amen if you're if you're
[1:50:40] missing the prophetic word being
[1:50:44] Vindicated you just got
[1:50:48] religion you may get eternal life at the
[1:50:52] white throne judgment but that we ain't
[1:50:54] preaching a white Throne judgment
[1:50:55] message I'm not preaching a tribulation
[1:50:58] message to y'all we we're preaching
[1:51:01] we're preaching an a an
[1:51:05] exodus
[1:51:07] right
[1:51:10] amen I got something I wrote down but
[1:51:12] I'm me stay with this for a second this
[1:51:15] for Exodus
[1:51:16] people this for people that that got
[1:51:19] amen the token appli amen that's ready
[1:51:23] to go that can see the flashing red
[1:51:26] light signs of his coming
[1:51:29] amen this is for a redeemable people Oh
[1:51:34] Glory okay so he says um now look at the
[1:51:37] priest when when they see him expressing
[1:51:39] himself exactly with the word and what
[1:51:42] he was they said it's Bey
[1:51:46] b see you got to follow the spirit and
[1:51:50] make sure you're not under that same
[1:51:54] Spirit come on church because the spirit
[1:51:58] on those that were not redeemable say
[1:52:01] but he's
[1:52:02] beyb and for for the people who can't
[1:52:06] follow the
[1:52:07] word right so so with these statements
[1:52:12] they anchor us because we we can see no
[1:52:15] I don't want to be under that Spirit see
[1:52:18] I want to be under the spirit of knowing
[1:52:20] because there's a spirit of not knowing
[1:52:23] right come on he says they showed where
[1:52:27] their nature
[1:52:29] was it was it was in the modern thought
[1:52:33] of the
[1:52:36] day but church it's powerful see why I
[1:52:39] didn't want to I ain't want to pass over
[1:52:41] this what's your
[1:52:43] thoughts is it in the modern thoughts of
[1:52:46] the
[1:52:47] day come on but okay if it is look at
[1:52:50] the Modern thoughts of the
[1:52:53] right look look at how they're being
[1:52:56] inspired look at like like I I heard
[1:52:59] brother Jack the other day he made
[1:53:01] reference to uh Kurt Franklin the stuff
[1:53:04] you see him doing he never would have
[1:53:06] did that back in when I was coming up
[1:53:08] man them Pentecostal mothers and them
[1:53:11] deacons would have sat bro you got a
[1:53:13] demon on you here's the altar you get
[1:53:16] down there and you do not
[1:53:19] move all that gting and and and and you
[1:53:24] know James Brown Michael Jackson and
[1:53:27] Prince and you know and and y'all know
[1:53:32] I'm all for looking good and dressing
[1:53:34] and all that some of that stuff is like
[1:53:35] bro you can't
[1:53:37] wear you you just you just can't
[1:53:41] wear glory to God he coming out man it's
[1:53:45] like he's making a
[1:53:47] mockery and see because we all say we
[1:53:50] Christians they want to they want to
[1:53:52] pack us up in all in the same box we
[1:53:55] ain't in this I'm not in the box with
[1:53:56] that
[1:54:01] man and and realistically he's gifted
[1:54:04] I'm not even saying that but gifts and
[1:54:06] callings without repentance but watch
[1:54:10] watch the the spirit he like the spirit
[1:54:13] of the pie Piper that's it y'all how to
[1:54:16] talk to me church I do still know some
[1:54:19] kids
[1:54:20] stories just woo and everybody and and
[1:54:25] and everybody and everybody just
[1:54:27] following him
[1:54:29] [Applause]
[1:54:31] he y'all think I can't move don't
[1:54:35] y'all I just cut it
[1:54:38] short cuz I don't want to be under his
[1:54:41] Spirit
[1:54:44] right and and and see it it's a lot of
[1:54:47] things that we brought into church that
[1:54:50] you know ain't a part of church
[1:54:53] you cuz you look you go back to David
[1:54:55] when he danced before the
[1:54:57] Lord right it wasn't all of this
[1:55:02] cute you know we we done brought so much
[1:55:05] stuff in that that kind of borderline
[1:55:08] and something a lot of it ain't even
[1:55:10] scriptural that you could tie back to
[1:55:13] this man was just it was no
[1:55:17] form no fashion to
[1:55:20] David right with that kind of excitement
[1:55:24] I ain't going to try to do that I don't
[1:55:26] feel like the bones feel that but I can
[1:55:29] just feel like him just just going
[1:55:31] wow nothing put on it was it was
[1:55:35] inspired from the heart it was a worship
[1:55:38] from the heart that's why when his wife
[1:55:41] told her boy I tell you what boy you was
[1:55:44] looking
[1:55:45] crazy L have mercy a king oh you ain't
[1:55:49] seen not yet but not in the way that KK
[1:55:52] Franken say You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet
[1:55:55] the inspiration of that coming from the
[1:55:57] pit of
[1:55:59] Hell see David knew that once he get
[1:56:03] inspired right Bo I'm going dance before
[1:56:06] the Lord the word watching watching the
[1:56:09] word come back yes un listen Church
[1:56:14] we're excited for the
[1:56:16] word the Vindication of the word that
[1:56:20] has come in our midst yes
[1:56:23] right and it don't it don't make us
[1:56:26] braggadocious or Pious or anything it it
[1:56:30] it just makes us
[1:56:32] blessed you know the the prophet makes a
[1:56:35] statement here and I I wrote this down
[1:56:37] because I ain't no uh if I will get to
[1:56:40] it but in recognizing your Dan in this
[1:56:42] message he says I feel that we're not
[1:56:46] grateful enough for the things that God
[1:56:49] is making known to us
[1:56:54] right we we're not grateful enough for
[1:56:58] the
[1:56:59] things
[1:57:01] right like that song say grateful great
[1:57:04] we ought to be so de
[1:57:07] grateful huh for the for the things and
[1:57:10] the understanding of the things that's
[1:57:14] not
[1:57:16] surface right glory to God Amen he says
[1:57:21] he said that's show where their nature
[1:57:24] was it was in the modern thought of the
[1:57:27] day but when this little prostitute that
[1:57:31] he met at the gate and told her Express
[1:57:35] his Messiah sign and the Messiah sign
[1:57:38] was discernment when he told us oh go
[1:57:41] get your husband she say boy I ain't got
[1:57:44] none I well well you told the truth see
[1:57:49] that was a messiah sign he could discern
[1:57:51] he said yeah the one you we ain't yours
[1:57:54] you didn't had a few of them before
[1:57:57] him that did something for her right
[1:58:00] because she realized somewhere maybe in
[1:58:04] her uh Sunday school class right aren't

[1:58:21] right right and here's something that's
[1:58:24] deep even though her life was a wreck
[1:58:27] turned upside down something deep in her
[1:58:31] right that was
[1:58:33] redeemable was
[1:58:35] predestinated had representation said
[1:58:38] you know what Messiah
[1:58:42] coming she messing up but Messiah coming
[1:58:46] right right man after man but they said
[1:58:50] Messiah coming

[1:58:55] in her shape she could recognize that
[1:59:01] right when when people that you know
[1:59:03] want to be identified with her amen uh
[1:59:08] uh here come a man that was willing to
[1:59:10] be identified with her to to sit to sit

[1:59:34] unbelief right I think brother Mark was
[1:59:36] saying you know Jesus couldn't do great
[1:59:39] Miracles where there was unbelief Jesus
[1:59:41] knew them guys right cuz before they
[1:59:45] went Amen to the upper room they they
[1:59:47] just had all kind of spirits on them
[1:59:50] they was wanting to call just one man
[1:59:52] was doing man call let's what you want
[1:59:55] us to do with this guy Jesus said if he
[1:59:57] ain't if he ain't uh against us any for
[2:00:00] don't bother with him leave him alone
[2:00:02] leave sometime y'all need to just leave
[2:00:04] stuff alone leave people

[2:00:27] church be busy by this well praise the
[2:00:36] Lord see she saw the express Messiah
[2:00:39] sign by telling her what she had
[2:00:43] done right and see this the thing in the
[2:00:47] 60s when when we had uh brother brandom
[2:00:50] on the scene
[2:00:52] uh uh with the Messiah sign because a
[2:00:56] part of his ministry was to reveal the
[2:00:59] son of
[2:01:00] man to make him
[2:01:02] known right glory to God that was a his
[2:01:07] ministry to declare he is
[2:01:10] here come on
[2:01:12] church that's a
[2:01:15] quote huh he was making Christ known he
[2:01:20] wasn't just a man trying to build a a
[2:01:25] dynasty that's what they doing today he
[2:01:28] wasn't doing that he was declaring
[2:01:32] Christ Christ is here greater than
[2:01:35] Solomon is here
[2:01:37] now somebody that's greater than a man
[2:01:40] is
[2:01:41] here but see the the smart the priest
[2:01:46] the people that should have known didn't
[2:01:49] know glory to God glory to God God Amen
[2:01:53] he says um she said sir watch this I
[2:01:57] perceive you're a
[2:01:59] prophet a prostitute could perceive that
[2:02:03] and people can't
[2:02:05] today we know that the Messiah when he
[2:02:10] comes he will tell us all these
[2:02:13] things she was recognizing him as the
[2:02:19] Messiah what in her her
[2:02:23] condition right in her condition when
[2:02:27] everybody was walking away when people
[2:02:29] wouldn't come out but people of her kind
[2:02:32] look what she was saying and versus what
[2:02:35] they were saying they were saying be
[2:02:38] elub she was saying man bro I know that
[2:02:42] you you got to be a prophet right say
[2:02:46] you we know the Messiah when he comes he
[2:02:49] will tell us all these things she was
[2:02:52] recognizing him as the Messiah the
[2:02:55] anointed one because he met this he met
[2:02:59] the scriptural
[2:03:01] qualifications don't you see amen the
[2:03:04] two pieces of paper we're coming
[2:03:07] together she we know that when the
[2:03:09] Messiah cometh right amen she saw his
[2:03:15] scriptural
[2:03:18] qualifications J listen we we got to go
[2:03:23] back and you know and I believe we
[2:03:26] understand this but for those who don't
[2:03:28] you know I'm just make like nobody don't
[2:03:30] know nothing this for this morning
[2:03:32] service you got to go back to what he
[2:03:35] was
[2:03:36] preaching identification and and
[2:03:39] recognizing your day in this message a
[2:03:41] mighty God
[2:03:43] unveil right all of these things he was
[2:03:46] trying to point us to Christ he was
[2:03:49] trying to point us to to to scripture
[2:03:54] Jesus came according to scripture he
[2:03:57] came as a virgin he came to set the
[2:04:00] captives free I mean all the things that
[2:04:03] he done was
[2:04:04] scriptural but the priests and the
[2:04:08] scholars and the great men that should
[2:04:10] have saw that reading the Scrolls but
[2:04:13] yet seeing the Vindication of it they
[2:04:16] was like Bey
[2:04:18] bu why because he didn't come according
[2:04:23] to their way of thinking a lot of times
[2:04:27] our thinking is
[2:04:30] trash right you don't even know how to
[2:04:33] think till you get
[2:04:36] converted come on church amen you you
[2:04:39] don't even know how to think right till
[2:04:41] you get converted and and and then it
[2:04:44] take years upon years here little there
[2:04:47] little to to help you to think
[2:04:50] right come on church amen to help you to
[2:04:54] think right cuz you don't know cuz we
[2:04:56] rubbing elbows and and we we got so much
[2:05:00] information and so
[2:05:02] much I'm talking about me too you it's
[2:05:05] it's a it's a it's a constant growth and
[2:05:09] maturity a constant unveiling y'all
[2:05:12] think cuz y'all been to church these few
[2:05:14] well I've been to church 30 years 40
[2:05:16] years in this message and you still
[2:05:18] still got to
[2:05:20] grow cuz people people still
[2:05:23] prejudice come
[2:05:25] on culturally and in every other way
[2:05:29] there's
[2:05:31] biases right come on
[2:05:34] Church
[2:05:36] woo right it it it's and and we we got
[2:05:39] to grow out of
[2:05:44] that I heard a young man say uh somebody
[2:05:47] posted this it was a young man he was he
[2:05:50] was reverting back to his script
[2:05:51] scripture talking about we we're known
[2:05:55] by our
[2:05:57] character
[2:05:59] right and when when we put our character
[2:06:03] and we base our thinking and all of that
[2:06:06] on the word you be like woo Jesus I got
[2:06:09] to grow some
[2:06:10] more come on church I ain't trying to
[2:06:12] hurt your feelings or nothing like that
[2:06:15] y'all ain't alone I'm talking about me
[2:06:16] too right you you start you start
[2:06:19] realizing after all of these years is
[2:06:21] you know I'm still not where I supposed
[2:06:23] to be but but I'm not standing still
[2:06:27] neither and and then and then I
[2:06:32] appreciate right I'm come back to this
[2:06:34] quote see I feel that we're not grateful
[2:06:38] enough for the things that God is making
[2:06:40] known to
[2:06:41] us now okay how do we feel about that
[2:06:45] statement that I just
[2:06:47] made brother Smile In the Flesh no I'm
[2:06:49] not in no flesh I am in the skin
[2:06:52] but not like you think right glory to
[2:06:56] God because this goes along with
[2:06:59] it this this goes this this
[2:07:03] individualized it causes us to check
[2:07:06] ourselves to look at ourselves not to
[2:07:09] think more highly well some of y'all got
[2:07:12] degrees I don't but but you ain't going
[2:07:15] in but cuz you got a degree and I don't
[2:07:18] I'm going somewhere let me see if I can
[2:07:19] how much time I got oh love a little
[2:07:22] time gone preach brother all right blame
[2:07:24] it on
[2:07:26] him he told me to go ahead praise the
[2:07:29] Lord I'm glad you sitting on the front
[2:07:32] row he says uh and the Mighty God unveil
[2:07:36] before us he said not what did this he
[2:07:39] said putting the old scriptures with the
[2:07:42] experience that Jesus was giving to her
[2:07:45] what did it do it made the Messiah he
[2:07:48] said and did you notice quickly her sins
[2:07:52] were forgiven because watch this because
[2:07:56] at the beginning she was
[2:08:00] redeemable right what
[2:08:04] her sometimes you see people cleaned up
[2:08:07] and you can't hardly believe
[2:08:09] it boy not
[2:08:13] you yeah see Jesus Jesus can do great
[2:08:18] things right but see because he was
[2:08:23] redeemable I'm afraid to think about
[2:08:26] where I would be today if I wasn't
[2:08:31] redeemable
[2:08:32] 1988 you know you know um we had a lot
[2:08:36] of years with brother Westco and uh a

[2:08:52] position with with the kind of faith
[2:08:55] that I
[2:08:56] needed I don't know what y'all needed
[2:08:59] but he was there he might not have had
[2:09:01] the Revelation that I got this morning
[2:09:04] but that that wasn't what I needed at
[2:09:06] that time what I needed at that time was

[2:16:32] psychologist and psychiatrists don't
[2:16:35] have see even even brother brandom he
[2:16:38] talks about the this another message but
[2:16:42] but y'all don't know the struggle that I

[2:16:46] but I got some things that I wanted to
[2:16:48] preach but listen to this you you when
[2:16:51] this young girl when this young girl you

[2:17:05] gift to pick all of these things
[2:17:09] up with the woman that committed uh an
[2:17:13] adultery on a husband when he was in the
[2:17:16] service right and she thought she was
[2:17:18] losing her mind
[2:17:21] right the PES couldn't pick that up she
[2:17:24] was hiding that she was hiding that but
[2:17:28] the gift picked it up
[2:17:32] oh see she could have gone to all the
[2:17:35] doctors she wanted took all the medicine
[2:17:38] she wanted they never would have got it
[2:17:42] right God gave it to amen a gift in his
[2:17:47] place see there's things that brother

[2:19:35] brought the results let me tell boy I
[2:19:38] tell you I got to go let the music come
[2:19:40] boy but I feel like preaching now cuz I
[2:19:43] tapped into something that that I was
[2:19:45] trying to run from for from from this
[2:19:48] service y'all make me nervous sometime
[2:19:52] where I don't know really what what to
[2:19:54] preach because I don't know if y'all can
[2:19:55] handle
[2:19:57] it it's it's the truth let the musicians
[2:19:59] come because because I got I got some
[2:20:02] things you know and and I I don't be
[2:20:05] trying to be bigger and better or
[2:20:07] nothing like that but God got a fivefold
[2:20:11] ministry right God got a fivefold
[2:20:13] Ministry for the Perfection of the
[2:20:15] church and and you know sometimes with
[2:20:19] experience and just sitting in a chair I
[2:20:22] get
[2:20:23] inspired and I probably get inspired
[2:20:26] unlike you know right now some of the
[2:20:29] younger
[2:20:30] guys coming up CU I got let's be
[2:20:33] realistic man I I'm older than
[2:20:38] them and I got more years behind this
[2:20:42] desk than they do some of them got what
[2:20:45] two three years behind the desk right
[2:20:50] how many years you've been preaching
[2:20:51] brother
[2:20:54] Mark BR
[2:20:59] qu five put them all three put them all
[2:21:03] together they still don't don't have 30
[2:21:06] some years but I'm not saying that you
[2:21:11] know but you
[2:21:13] know you can't y'all can't expect me to
[2:21:16] be
[2:21:18] them y'all can't expect me to approach
[2:21:20] things the way that they approach things
[2:21:22] did they
[2:21:24] right glory to God but I hope you know
[2:21:27] next year you know y you know we we're
[2:21:33] understanding I I didn't tap really into
[2:21:35] that the way that I wanted to but but we
[2:21:38] we're we're under we're
[2:21:41] understanding we we we're we're Desiring
[2:21:43] more we're Greatful for for this year of
[2:21:46] services I don't know about y'all but
[2:21:47] I'm grateful for that I'm grateful for
[2:21:49] this year's
[2:21:51] services and what what God but that
[2:21:54] ain't
[2:21:56] all there are times where I feel like
[2:21:59] man I'm still on the
[2:22:02] surface right because this is this is a
[2:22:06] inexhaustible
[2:22:08] Fountain you can't exhaust this where I
[2:22:11] preach this so what go back to it again
[2:22:14] and God will show you one point
[2:22:17] different and and expand it the prophet
[2:22:20] makes a statement he said man if if if I
[2:22:23] could preach to y'all what's given to me
[2:22:27] in the back room he said boy it'll be
[2:22:29] marvelous but when you get here you
[2:22:31] pressed and nervous and all of that you
[2:22:34] you just kind of Hit the highlights of
[2:22:36] stuff and sometimes even with brother
[2:22:38] Brandon God gives him stuff that's so so
[2:22:42] deep so so intense that he like boy
[2:22:46] they'll pass out if I preach this up in
[2:22:48] here
[2:22:50] marriage and divorce he said I had to
[2:22:53] take out things that I wanted to
[2:22:56] say because I didn't want to hurt the
[2:22:58] people and and you know he preached a
[2:23:01] little bit and have to you know almost
[2:23:05] apologize and and and this ain't for
[2:23:07] y'all Christian sisters right so that
[2:23:10] they don't get offended right cuz the
[2:23:13] statements are so
[2:23:15] profound but it's like I'm not really
[2:23:18] trying to hurt you but I'm trying to
[2:23:23] illuminate right help you to be able to
[2:23:26] walk and especially in this
[2:23:29] Society right man it's it's going to be
[2:23:34] in the
[2:23:36] minority right this why we got to pray
[2:23:39] for this Young Generation cuz it's going
[2:23:41] to be in the minori it's a lot of people
[2:23:43] going on church and all of that but that
[2:23:45] ain't what we talking about what we
[2:23:48] talking about is so much more deep than
[2:23:50] just going to a building and shouting
[2:23:53] and all of
[2:23:55] that y'all give me some
[2:23:58] music I don't

[2:27:39] dear amen but we appreciate the word on
[2:27:43] this morning amen was a lot a lot said
[2:27:47] there amen it just like you know one of
[2:27:50] the things that stand out to me is
[2:27:54] just the
[2:27:56] processing the processing of how see
[2:27:59] once you've been exposed to something
[2:28:01] you can't be unexposed to
[2:28:04] it that that go both ways so that's why
[2:28:08] you know with the younger ones and even
[2:28:10] the old ones be careful what you expose
[2:28:12] yourself
[2:28:13] to because you can't never be
[2:28:17] unexposed and now you got to carry that
[2:28:20] yes you done you done release something
[2:28:23] Pandora's box but on the other side when
[2:28:28] you when when you set up under listen
[2:28:32] now a prophet's
[2:28:35] message and and and You Begin that that
[2:28:38] that you begin to your eyes begin to
[2:28:42] open and you see the day that we're
[2:28:45] living in yes you see the the the the
[2:28:49] the the impact of what you're really
[2:28:52] that the gospel is still
[2:28:56] moving amen and understand uh how we got
[2:29:01] here see then you then you're you're
[2:29:03] going into the head now that's what he
[2:29:05] was getting that when brother giz I was
[2:29:08] there when he's made that statement it
[2:29:11] it was like a bomb went off in the place
[2:29:12] because it was like I read one where
[2:29:16] Revelation comes down if you could just
[2:29:19] see it at the come down and set upon you
[2:29:22] a re
[2:29:24] Revelation and when you get it you get
[2:29:27] it you your whole world
[2:29:30] changed because your eyes are now
[2:29:34] open and you just you can't you can't go
[2:29:36] back you can't you you you can't just
[2:29:39] you can't just be religious anymore you
[2:29:42] can't just and and then you got to walk
[2:29:44] that line you got to walk that line of
[2:29:46] how not to be
[2:29:47] arrogant you struggle with not being
[2:29:50] being arrogant but it's because of what
[2:29:53] God has
[2:29:54] done because of the Revelation that you
[2:29:58] have you you you you you you got to God
[2:30:02] bless you and this that you treat
[2:30:05] everybody right and and and you try but
[2:30:07] you want them to see it but you can't
[2:30:10] you can't shove it down their
[2:30:13] throat and we'll stand up here behind
[2:30:16] the behind the pull pit and we trying to
[2:30:18] preach this Revelation to you try to
[2:30:20] preach this Revelation to you and
[2:30:21] sometime it seem like some people still
[2:30:23] not getting it but let me say this and I
[2:30:27] ain't going to do what I I ain't going
[2:30:28] to do it I'm I'mma BR it un preached
[2:30:31] already don't set up under this

[2:31:10] be a
[2:31:12] prophet with no Vindication whatsoever
[2:31:16] ain't been Vindicated on
[2:31:18] nothing but we are
[2:31:21] confident that we've heard the word of
[2:31:24] God through a prophet's lips that has
[2:31:28] shown us who we
[2:31:31] are what time it is yes and our eyes
[2:31:35] have been
[2:31:37] open that's why it may seem a little
[2:31:40] strange man they do things a little bit

[2:31:47] know we know we do things just a little
[2:31:49] bit different and and you know what and
[2:31:52] even in that there's struggles and we're
[2:31:55] still in flesh and we still got to
[2:31:57] contend with flesh we still going to
[2:31:58] battle flesh until we get out of
[2:32:01] here but don't sit here don't sit here
[2:32:04] under
