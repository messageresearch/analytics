And as you get as you get older, you know, when I was young, I just felt like I was invincible. I bet I didn't feel nothing. I started getting into them 50s and boy, now I'm in them 60s and it's like, oo Lord, man, I'm talking about retirement. I never thought about retirement back then. And it's like, Lord, you got to make a way out of now way. Out of nowhere so I could go somewhere and sit down and relax. I was talking to a lady in the store every morning on Sunday. She she greet me and uh she wish me safe travel. She was like, "Man, I'm with you, Re. I'm tired of getting up in the morning." It's like five o'clock and and boy. Well, God God knows all things. Amen. He's able to do the exceedingly abundantly above all we can ask or think. Amen. I guess we want to greet our visitors. We're not quite sure uh who they are. Maybe they can introduce themselves to us. Amen. From whose church in Michigan? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; okay. Okay. Okay. Brother Ray, we know brother Ray. Amen. Uh let's let us start at the uh first verse of Genesis chapter 6. And it came to pass when men be to multiply upon the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men that they were fair. And they took them wives all which they chose. And the Lord said, "My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh, and yet his days shall be uh 120 years." Uh let's skip to the fifth verse. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that the very imagination of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually. U let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer. Gracious father, we just thank you and we praise you God this morning for allowing us another opportunity to uh be in the service of the living God. And uh we just want to uh just ask that you'd help us to get uh the human part pushed to one side so that Lord the Holy Spirit can just use this vessel uh this morning. And uh may you anoint us aresh Lord God forgive us of all our trespasses Lord. Uh we just appreciate you, oh God, for the season that we're in, Lord. And uh we we just love you for all things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Good to see brother Stanley this morning and his family and Sister Boy. Oh, folk we've been known for a long time. Long long time. Amen. Sister Boy. Uh we want to use as a little subject this morning, flashing red light, signs of his coming. And uh we've been having some wonderful services uh um in the church. I tell you what, that brother uh on Wednesday night, he was getting it in. He was definitely getting it in. and other brother Sunday and uh brother Jack and just you know you as a servant of God um uh you just want to f follow try to follow the just the inspiration and and the move of the spirit of God um as God is moving I believe God always has something amen to say to the church of the living God to just to keep us on our toes. Is that right? And uh we we realize s we've we've had a a new pope that have come out of America. And I'm I'm quite sure that you know when we we've seen seeing all of these different uh prophetic things come to pass. It just kind of moves us in moves us in a certain way. And and also it's it's just a real indication of of where we are. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, the Bible says that uh no man knows the day or the hour. Is that right? When when he's when he's going to come. But but you know, God is God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; God God, you know, don't really leave anything to just chance. I think God God uh I I was thinking about something that I I wanted to preach, but I ended up here uh just working with with prophecy and just to try to show how it's it's it's you know, we give the devil credit for a whole lot of stuff &gt;&gt; that we shouldn't be giving the devil credit for &gt;&gt; because it's it's it's the the prophecy of the scripture &gt;&gt; that that's causing uh a a lot of these different things to take place. Is that right? You know, the Bible says uh that his word can't return unto him void that it it has to accomplish. So, it's it's the prophecy of the scripture that's overseeing modern events. &gt;&gt; I think brother Jack preached modern events made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, we see things and we get in the flesh and and and and you know, we can't hardly figure out things and but we we got prophecy of the scripture &gt;&gt; that has let us know um um what this season would be &gt;&gt; and what would be taking place in this season. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Outside of that, you know, we we all are kind of be like the scripture says because we uh men's hearts is failing for fear. We we will all be fretful. Is that right? A little neurotic. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We just probably is a tad bit neurotic, but you know, we we thank God that that we got a third pull. &gt;&gt; Is that right? that that you know and and I've been been listening to the inspiration uh of of the ministry. We ought to be grateful that we do have a third pull &gt;&gt; that's that's working this morning. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He lets us know it'll work in a greater measure as the the the squeeze come down which we're actually being squeezed this morning. Is that right? But but we we have something in us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's keeping us. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; When when the flesh wants to give up, when the flesh wants to quit, when the flesh wants to go back, there's something in us that's holding the rain. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know, we used to sing that song. Something deep inside of me. &gt;&gt; Telling me go ahead. &gt;&gt; Something deep inside of me telling me go ahead. Y'all come on sing with me. Something deep inside of me telling me go ahead. Go ahead. Hey, go ahead. Now, I know it's hot, but we going to have some churching here this morning. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We thank God for for what's inside of us &gt;&gt; that's that's that's pushing us. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Telling us, you know, you can make it. &gt;&gt; I feel like brother Wesco this morning. &gt;&gt; Brother Wesco sometime was saying got this song. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but we we want to we want to start right here. We want to read us a couple of quotes and and continue to move on. Right. We we want to see the signs of his coming. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Uh God God will not allow us to be caught off guard. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; If you're caught off guard, it's your own fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. &gt;&gt; If you're caught off guard, if you don't make it, it's your own fault. &gt;&gt; It it it won't be the ministry's fault. It'll be your own fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you know of of the word that's been preached and especially in the hour that we living in uh in end time evangel evangelism 1962 it starts out with uh the red lights is flashing. He said the signs down the signs down his coming is at hand. How how many believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in Isaiah the 60th chapter, he says, "Darkness has covered the earth. Gross darkness will cover the people, but thank God for light." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, this is definitely a dark hour. &gt;&gt; Just just when when we think about the the the minds and the concepts and the precepts of man, man, men are evil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Folk folk folk do things now that folks wouldn't have done 40, 50, 60 years ago, &gt;&gt; right? You you just look at this this I don't want to pick on the younger generation, but the these YNs, man, they something serious. Y'all think I don't know nothing, don't you? You know, you and you and you know I forget I'm over 60 so I'm in a whole another category now right but these these just the the the mindset man uh of this generation they different &gt;&gt; you know even I remember brother Israel uh read this quote and I don't have a quote but it's just coming to my mind it says each generation gets 10 times worse than the next &gt;&gt; and and we could we could really we could really see when I was coming up we we respected folk. &gt;&gt; We we respected the police. &gt;&gt; It's it's you know different things that we respect nothing and nobody &gt;&gt; is that right? They shoot at the police just like they shoot at the average person. It's it's just you know we was just taught you know respect and fear the police come you you know now it's man well who are you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but it's just the sign of our releasing &gt;&gt; it's a it's an indication of the the the the lateness the attitude of the people it's a it's a sign of the lateness of the hour and just how dark it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You know, uh at times, you know, I I listen to some of the podcast uh and I'm like I'm getting to the place where it's like, man, this stuff is draining. &gt;&gt; It it's it's draining because this stuff is just so far away from scripture, &gt;&gt; right? and and the principles and the things that's being presented to this generation man is so far away from Bible that if you you feed on this you be messed up &gt;&gt; right and a gener and you you find a generation is just so messed up be because of what folks are feeding on &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for a seven course meal this morning &gt;&gt; is that right I'm grateful for a seven course meal this morning, right? Be because you know what a caucus is, there you'll find the eagles gather. &gt;&gt; You'll find eagles feeding upon eagle food. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And and that food is this is the thing that that gives us strength &gt;&gt; to overcome and understanding to overcome in the age that we're living in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it it's it's dark. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Right. But it's light at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you find people will choose darkness over light. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm grateful for light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm grateful for for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Watch. He says the end time messenger and message should meet the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Right? See these conditions brought us amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See he c he couldn't have come before the evening time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. He had to come in its season. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When when the conditions were right for our going, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm grateful because what he brought me was a perspective. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A clear understanding. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, because wi without without that, we look church, we'd never get we'd never get out of here. That's true. &gt;&gt; Right. We we we be sucked up. We take the mark of the beast. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because look, just look at people's perspective even on the mark of the beast. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. Not realizing it's a religious mark, not some tattoos and you know, we we got people looking for all sorts of things and but you know, we we have understanding. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. That that it's a it's a religious mark. is turning down the word for your day. &gt;&gt; The word in its season. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Seeing people looking for, you know, tattoos and, you know, and and and steady turning down the word &gt;&gt; all the time. Glory to God. But his ministry, he said the end time messenger and message should meet the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Don't you think so? He say this message could not have been preached 40 years ago. Now &gt;&gt; that was during his time. We know we way up the road from that. The messages has come and that's what we're feeding on, &gt;&gt; right? But in in 1962, end time evangelism, right? He was letting us know this message couldn't come to its appointed season. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. He says this message could not have been preached 40 years ago. No, the end time message and messenger has got to meet. He says back there, you know, and and I I just want to stop here and label for a second. These principles are difficult if you're not predestinated be &gt;&gt; because you you don't see how important God sending us a prophet is &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because we speak about God sending us a prophet and it's like you know well well why is he so important and you know you mean to tell me y'all y'all fighting over it's like you just don't understand the importance &gt;&gt; this is because this just goes beyond just church going. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning, this ain't just about church going. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This this is great. This is feeding our souls. Amen. A perspective that'll keep us anchored in the day and hour that we're living in. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We we needed Malachi for &gt;&gt; in in the day that we're living in. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Be because this is the day of false anointed ones. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Genu and see it's so deceiving because you see people anointed. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Genu genuine genuinely anointed. &gt;&gt; But what are they teaching? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's it. See, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say it's it's a genuine anointing upon them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but it's their teaching. What are they teaching the people? [Music] &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That that makes the difference. What are you feeding on? What are you being taught? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, it's it's so important for us in this hour with kids to make sure we teach our kids if they're going to have any hope in this in this age that we living in to teach them biblical principles. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. As parents, you got to have that understanding, right? &gt;&gt; Cuz it's different. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's different now, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. and and you can't afford for for your children to feed upon the things that you know that's out here now, &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's important that that if they going to have any hope, you know, the Bible said train them up in the way that they should go, &gt;&gt; right? it, you know, cuz they might struggle, they might venture out, they might drift away from, you know, uh, what's been taught, but what's been taught goes with them when they walk out. &gt;&gt; Right? What's been taught, follow them, &gt;&gt; see, you know, when I was when I was young and I was a little bit wild. I wasn't like the Yins now, you know, but I was a little wild, you know, and I hung with some I hung with some wild guys. They was like the Yins of that day. We were our Yu of of of yesterday and they they they would do things and I be like, man, I can't do that. boy, there was there was a consciousness there &gt;&gt; that there was something there, &gt;&gt; you know, uh that kept me from from crossing certain lines, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz a lot of them didn't grow up in church and all of that. All they knew is is hood life and uh so there was no line there. But for me, you know, man, I went to church. Glory to God. I I know what it's like to sit next to grandma in church. Y'all ought to preach with me up in here. I remember I got some I got me and my three older cousins. We was talking the other last Sunday. Matter of fact, on my way I called and we chatted chatting it up. They were older than me, but I live with my grandmama and and they live with their parents. And man, after Sunday school, boy, we used to go to the store and wander around and well, one day my grandma would say, they used to call me Woody. I don't know where they get Woody from Willie. And and and my grandmama say, "Boy, come here." Say, "Where you be at outside of school?" Uh, yeah. Ain't no lying to grandma back in them days. Boy, that gets you good in you. I'm talking about a good put you to sleep whooping. When they finished with you, you going to bed. She said, "Boy, let me tell you something. When Sunday school out, you and your brother better park y'all parts right next to me." Boy, I used to be mad watching them pick on me. Boy, we f to go to the store. Well, y'all go ahead and start going to sit next to grandma cuz I ain't going to get no whooping. So, y'all don't live with her. I live with her. But you know what it turns out? living with her and those those conversations that I would have &gt;&gt; uh uh on a daily basis with grandma is what helped me through even when I was struggling &gt;&gt; with with my identity. &gt;&gt; Is that right? All all of and I I could look back and I understand a lot of things that she said and a lot of things that she did. parents when I was, you know, 12, 13 years old and a little younger. Um, I I couldn't What you talking about, granny? But, but now I look back and I've developed a little bit and and I realize the conversations that I had and the things that my mom tried to tell me. So, you know, we we're we're blessed. Is that right, you young people, you know, and I'm going to move on. Y'all know me. Ain't no telling where I'm going to go this morning, but I got some notes. But we'll see &gt;&gt; when when when inspiration I follow inspiration. &gt;&gt; But you know, you young people, you ought to be grateful &gt;&gt; for for being up under a ministry, &gt;&gt; right? And for for for the information uh uh um uh that you're getting. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Good to have brother Jack with us this morning. Uh uh that that's that's a blessing. You you you don't want to take that that lightly. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Don't take the conversation cuz you know we like to stick out our lips and poke out and stomp and kick. &gt;&gt; I was one of them too, &gt;&gt; right? No, no, don't don't do that. Try to try to ponder, try to think about uh the importance of the information that you're getting. Is that right? Well, I'm only 10, but one day you'll be 20. &gt;&gt; By these years go by so fast. One day, you know, I was 25 when I got saved and now I'll be 63 in a couple of days. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Time has a way of passing us by. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And so in order in order to make it and be productive, you know, you got to think about the information and and feed upon it and and and and see the importance in it and and why why are they saying it? Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know, because if a real good parents parents, we make a lot of mistakes. Is that right? Come on, parents. Y'all ain't perfect. Come on, parents. &gt;&gt; Let me hear you real loud. Come on, parents. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know I ain't the only one made a whole lot of mistakes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Y'all Yeah. This generation got it a lot better than than than us, right? &gt;&gt; Because they got better information. &gt;&gt; You know, they got the whole mind of God. &gt;&gt; They they they they feed from the the the the opening open word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Everything is revealed, &gt;&gt; right? You know, it it was so much error in in the principles and whatever we was trying to feed upon to to to grow up and try to be productive and make ourselves and men and you know, I know hindsight is 2020, but man, given what I got now, boy, I wish I could go back and do it all over again, but life just don't work like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, maybe maybe you know, I guess that's why they call it grandparent, &gt;&gt; right? You get a doover with your grandchildren. &gt;&gt; You you able to you you able to pass on information to your grand that you didn't have so much of, right, &gt;&gt; when you were raising your children. You was raising your children as you was raising yourself. Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; We was we was immature. &gt;&gt; Sometime we like to think how mature we was, but when we go back and look like, oo, &gt;&gt; I did that. Like Erl said, "Did I do that?" Yes, you did. Sure you did. But But it was all a part It was all a part of growth. It's all a part of mature. So y'all got that, young people. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know the the the But give me five minutes on it, young people, and I'm going to move on. It's it's hurt. It's hurting to watch this young generation cuz I know for me, it's hurting to watch this young generation do the things that we we try to uh show them that's not right. &gt;&gt; Right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on. See, we we try to we try to share the positive, but but it's the negative that they want. &gt;&gt; And and see, like the first church age under the white horse rider, they couldn't see the the death associated with following false doctrine. Right. &gt;&gt; And and sin starts out pretty. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; all of that that you see ain't nothing behind it but death. &gt;&gt; Cuz the wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; This is life right here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Under the third pull. This is life. &gt;&gt; That's death. brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you know, it's it's hurting to watch, you know, young people, you know, that that are raised up in church. I mean, you look around us, church, this this building shouldn't have been big enough for us when we came here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The the the other build these buildings never should have been big enough for us, &gt;&gt; right? Not unless we, you know, took all of that. &gt;&gt; With with all of with all of the people, &gt;&gt; come on, church. With all of the people and all of the young people and the young couples and they children &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; If we think about it, if if all of my children, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and my grandchildren, all of brother Jack &gt;&gt; Yeah. children and grandchildren and and and brother Solomon and his his all of his children. He got a couple here, right? He ain't you know Nehemiah ain't married yet. At least I ain't hurting anybody. And and just on and on. Sister Vernon and all her children and grandchildren, &gt;&gt; right? And just on and on and on. &gt;&gt; Is that right? right? &gt;&gt; The the kids that are raised up and then just think about all of all of the people that have come in contact &gt;&gt; with the Son of Man ministry that never fully understood, [Music] &gt;&gt; right? Never understood why we needed a prophet, &gt;&gt; right? They went to church. They shouted. They shot. They ran around the building, but they never really understood &gt;&gt; what what the ministry was all about. The ministry was never about a man. &gt;&gt; The ministry was about God. &gt;&gt; God, Amen. Veiling himself and his people. &gt;&gt; God bringing a perspective in this age. But you know, people like, well, you know, it's these little books and it's this man. It's like, man, come on. &gt;&gt; If you don't know, just say you don't know. &gt;&gt; Don't act like you know. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't run all around with misinformation. If you don't know, if you don't know what you just say, you know what? I ain't I just can't comprehend. &gt;&gt; I ain't really understanding what they talking about. But you know, we people are so proud now that they won't just pull the ministry to the side and say, "I got some questions, &gt;&gt; you know, and I'mma keep asking them, right, these questions, cuz ain't no question too small." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no question too insignificant. You keep asking questions until you convince. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba had a lot of money. She had a lot of fun. She had a lot of goods, &gt;&gt; right? But she, you know what? She wasn't about to be ran off. &gt;&gt; Right. She stayed there till she was convinced. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She started looking around at at the order. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Watching the ministry, &gt;&gt; watching Solomon. She say, "Okay, I brought this for y'all. This where I need to be. All right. But some people, most people, man, I seen it, man. I with our pastor in Okchobee, folk would come in and boy, we be dropping bombs up in there, breaking bread. This the truth in it. How I ain't shamed to say it, boy. We got something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when I'mma tell you something. I know we like to follow preachers, but I'm just tell I'm brag on the God that's in me. &gt;&gt; When God give me something to preach, brother, I can preach it &gt;&gt; by the spirit. We be trying to follow this ministry and this man, &gt;&gt; brother, God give you a local shepherd. &gt;&gt; If you pull, he'll preach. &gt;&gt; I remember one lady said, one lady came in there. She sat there, "Boy, I don't remember what I preached on." She said, "This is what y'all This is what you preaching. This is what y'all feeding on." That was a joke. She never came back. Right. It was it it was something that she couldn't comprehend, &gt;&gt; but she didn't stay long enough. And some would stay a few weeks, a few days, a few Sundays, a few services, and then they disappear, &gt;&gt; right? Be be because it was something out of the ordinary. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz cuz people want the ordinary, but this is outside of the ordinary. &gt;&gt; This is extraordinary teaching. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says the the end time message and message should meet the end time conditions. He says he says this message couldn't have come and been preached 40 years. He said the end time message and message has got to meet back there in them days. They had it probably wouldn't have had probably wouldn't have worked, &gt;&gt; right? But it's it it's got to cope with the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; These conditions got to be here for one as a sign &gt;&gt; in order uh to bring the messenger and its message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The end time message and messenger has got to meet. He says back there in them days they had it probably wouldn't have worked but it's got to cope with the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; Be converted. Believe God's sign. Don't believe the sign. &gt;&gt; Believe the gospel sign. &gt;&gt; Don't believe that. &gt;&gt; Don't just hurt people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. You said believe the gospel signs. &gt;&gt; See, if we understand what I mean, brother Brad was preaching. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. Glory to God. He wasn't exalting himself. He was pointing us to something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He understood. See, this is what I like about the message. Brother Brandham just wasn't doing random things and saying random things, &gt;&gt; right? He was scriptural in his approach to the gospel, &gt;&gt; right? Glory to God. Because we needed a scriptural understanding to be able to cope with the conditions, &gt;&gt; right? Because we we we're living in an age of insanity, &gt;&gt; right? I remember 30 some years ago and reading some of that stuff and even preaching some of that stuff and now it's like, bro, we needed that. We needed somebody to tell us about the conditions in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Just look at the people, &gt;&gt; right? People with all of the education and everything that we got. People are worse off than they've ever been in the history of the Bible. &gt;&gt; We got more hospitals, more medicine, more therapists, more psychologists, more all of this stuff. And people are worse off than they've ever been in the history of the Bible. &gt;&gt; The truthmen, &gt;&gt; right? We we understand what's been loosed, right? But we we got something to help us to cope. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Because you can go to these places and listen to these people and still not get what's necessary to cope with the conditions. The only thing that helps you cope with the condition, Amen, is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's that's it. &gt;&gt; You know, uh I'm not here to tell you not to get what you need. If you need that, you go get that, right? Glory to God. Cuz who am I in to stand am I to stand in the way of, you know, whatever folk need? But but I am here to say under this word has been given to us what's needed to cope. &gt;&gt; Well, I smoke me some weed. &gt;&gt; I drank me some brown. &gt;&gt; I smoke me some cigarettes. &gt;&gt; All of that stuff make you nervous, make you a neurotic. All right. &gt;&gt; Y'all talking to somebody. Listen, church. I did all that. I smoke cigarettes and then when you ain't got nothing, you you feeding. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Can I Can I can Can I get Can I get a cigarette, bro? &gt;&gt; Boy, you will drive yourself crazy. &gt;&gt; You need a drink. You need a puff to get up, a puff to go down, a puff to cope. I know what I'm talking about. I work I work my little with my little baby cousin and man sometime he just drive me crazy. It's just a and the people around me some puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff &gt;&gt; and they ain't getting no better. &gt;&gt; They ain't getting no better &gt;&gt; cuz those things don't make you better. &gt;&gt; Christ makes you better. And and for all of the reasons why I thought that that I needed those things, being sober since 1988, I realized I never needed that. I needed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, to help me cope with my condition, &gt;&gt; to help me to cope with my struggles. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, that stuff ain't going to help me cope. You say, "Man, I've been a Christian 38, but I still got my struggles." &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. And and you know what? I need something to help me get up in the morning, help me go through the day, and it ain't that stuff, &gt;&gt; right? That just uh compound my situation, just makes it makes it worse, &gt;&gt; right? I I need something to to give me rest to settle me. And the only thing I found to do that is Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the word. That's the only thing that settles me. That's the only thing that keeps me from blowing my brains out sometime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the flesh, the flesh be feeling like giving up, &gt;&gt; right? But there's something in me, you know, that that'll, you know, quicken a word. Boy, you put your hand to the plow, you can't turn back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My flesh be want to turn back sometime and give up. I'll be real with you, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? Then the scripture come. &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. This a report I got to believe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm I'm overcoming, &gt;&gt; you say, why you say stuff like that, brother? Because I know that. You know what? I don't come out here to say it, but somebody probably struggling, &gt;&gt; right? You know, some couple, some individual, somebody feel like quitting, &gt;&gt; somebody feel like throwing in a towel, &gt;&gt; waving the white flag. Don't do it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. Glory to God. We got a message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That we've been given, right? Amen. He says, "Back there in them days, they they had it probably wouldn't have worked, but it's got to cope with the end time conditions." He be converted, believe the gospel signs. He says, "That's the matches of today. Wash your souls in the blood of the lamb and believe the gospel that the end time signs are here. &gt;&gt; They're here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, boy, I'm going to keep going. Boy, I tell you, I want to get this up right quick. He says, "Here we are, the end time." He was saying that back in the 60s. Why? He could see the conditions. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. He can see the conditions &gt;&gt; when when the world was, you know, do doing their thing and all of that. Uh he could see the condition, &gt;&gt; right, of the day, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the condition says something, right? Yes, sir. It says that, amen, the coming of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; He says, here we are, the end time, the red light down, flashing, coming of the Lord is at hand. Yes, sir. Listen, the end time message should meet the end time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Condition. He says, "Whether we've we've got off, the message ought to bring it back." &gt;&gt; Right? See, the the message brings back pure understanding. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Which is so important, right, for us. &gt;&gt; God ain't rapturing in this age. Amen. False doctrine. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; See, in the sovereignty, the omega church and the alpha church is got to be the same church. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. This the same word, the same kind of life, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; The same kind of power, &gt;&gt; is that right? Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And so, in order for that to be produced, we had to get back to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what what they're getting out there will not produce what God is looking for in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because because there's things that God is requiring that will not never be produced out there in in those the systems. &gt;&gt; Is that right? as as good as they may be, they could never produce because he produces that which is past. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; see what what is past got to be present. If that makes sense, &gt;&gt; right? Be because if if if we're looking back to the Alpha Church as an example for us, right? Then we got to get back to the kind of word that they were preaching and that they were feeding upon to bring forth those kinds of results. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. And see when when when when people think, well, you know, brother Brad was off with the word. He was a prophet as long as the anointing was on him. But when he wasn't under the anointing and it's like, brother, what are you saying? &gt;&gt; That don't even make sense. &gt;&gt; The man was a prophet. &gt;&gt; In the mind of God, &gt;&gt; like he told Jeremiah, "Before you was ever formed in the womb, &gt;&gt; boy, I already ordained you a prophet &gt;&gt; to the nation." Amen. &gt;&gt; He He was a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Before he was ever formed in the womb of, you know, his mom and dad, &gt;&gt; man, everything lined up. His birth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; His name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything lined up perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And when people be saying I be like pull y'all off empty. Glory to God. He says uh he said a call back to the original word, right? He says oh my like other messages did in that day this message will have to be the same. We we are promised that God promised it in his word. Malachi 4 said it would happen and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. Promised it.

You know, young people, I'm f to go give me some some music and and I guess Brother Jack can make his way. Think about it. Y'all young sisters, if you don't know how to cook, start now. &gt;&gt; Start now. I remember sister brother brother man say why he married sister s she could cook nothing. He said I'm taking you to my mama house. I couldn't even cook nothing. At least Gina had, you know, a couple of things on her resume. She she had a little spaghetti, a little baked chicken. She had two or three little things on the recipe, you know. But uh she she g she kind of grew into, you know, her thing after a while. But hey, y'all don't want to be that. Grow up, you got children, you got a bad feed, though. &gt;&gt; Not unless you get rich rich and you got your own private chef or two or three. But I don't know if we going to get there. Is that right? Somebody say, "Bless, you don't even do." I ain't cooking up or have me a shell. Do your thing. D get rich. Is that right? What's that? All right, brother. Jackie, you come back your way. Oh my my desire. [Music] He passionately is to be what? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it again. I will be what you call me to be. Say, I will be what you've called me to be. Oh, I'll say yes. [Music] Oh Lord, I agree. My desire passionately, [Music] oh, is to be what you call me to be. That's what I will be. Oh, that's what I will be. Come on, do it again. Oh, I will be what you've called me. I say yes, Lord. I agree. Oh Lord, in my desire [Music] passionately. Oh, what you call me to be. That's what I'll be. That's what I will be. Come on, give the Lord a hand of praise. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. We certainly thank God for brother Smiley uh on today. as I was uh driving back, I had a chance to um tune in online and you know the um I don't think it could ever be um said enough how blessed we are uh to have ears to hear and eyes to see what the spirit is doing in this hour. As brother Smiley was saying is you just think about all the people that have passed through, family members, uh friends that have passed through and how if just that little group of the ones that we knew uh was just in church on a faithful on a faithful basis, we would need a large building, a really really large building. and um you know but but it's it's it's to me it's sad that people uh just don't understand you know just the importance of why why God sent us a prophet and and if if you've and I don't know maybe maybe people have not gone through um denominational hurt if I can use that term maybe they have not gone through that process and and watched the politics and and and all these other types of things in church and um you know it was a lot of nonsense. I remember growing up in it and it was really a lot of nonsense. Uh but not only that, if you had any experience where you you read the Bible and you saw that the Bible said something different than what they was actually teaching in church, if you haven't had those experiences, then it's hard for you to understand the importance of why God had to send us a prophet to take us back to the truth of the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh I grew up in a household where you know a family where one side is Pentecost, the other side is Baptist and we trying to figure out which what's what's right. Right. We we see fallacies everywhere you know and but when we come to this oh glory to God uh we stop looking after we after after this found us. We didn't find this but this found us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but we thank God for his truth. We thank God for his word. Uh we thank God that uh we can see the signs and we we have something that helps us to meet the condition of this age. Amen. That's why anything happened, we're not alarmed. We're not we're not we're not um um we're not frantic, &gt;&gt; right? We don't do that. when when um when they when the pope came out of uh the US and most people probably didn't see that coming, but we did. Anytime a a pope stepped down or a pope died, we had our eyes on something. People that believe this message, we had our eyes on something. We had our eyes on a prophecy. And I and and I remember brother Dwayne was the first one I heard bring it out because that I think the very day or the day um the day after the that that Pope from the US was announced, they had service there uh and brother Dwayne brought out that the man was born uh pretty much 9 months after brother Brandham spoke it. That's too perfect for me. That's too perfect for me. So here we have a uh modern events being made clear by prophecy. We have a pope coming from the United States. We have a a a woman vice president, president. And then and in that same quote, brother Random said, "It could be the Catholic Church or it could be a woman vice president, president." He said, "Both of them." And guess what? Both of them were fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Right? Both were fulfilled. So uh we have these things before us. We're closer to the coming of the Lord than we've ever been. And uh and I tell you, please don't miss it in this hour. Don't don't don't misunderstand what God is doing. Catch these signs. Uh and like like he said, even in the days of of um Noah preaching. Can you imagine that? Here God sends them a prophet, gives them a message to so they can get prepared, you know, so they don't have to go through the judgment. And what do they do? They reject the prophet. &gt;&gt; They reject the prophet. Well, you've read your Bible. You've read your Bible. Those that rejected Noah's message, what happened to them? They died. Trust me, you don't want to reject the revealed word for your day. &gt;&gt; God sent you a prophet. Take what that prophet says. Follow it with everything you got. Amen. This is not to bring you to a man. This is to bring you closer to Christ. Amen. God bless you, brother Smiley. Thank you so much for the word of the Lord on today. Amen. As it was said earlier, um today is actually our last day fellowshipping here. And boy, did they send us out. They did they send us out of here. Y'all ain't coming back. We shutting off the AC on you. I think they made a mistake. We're we're not planning to be here next week uh because we'll be having our meeting there in uh at Palm Beach Gardens High School. And um the way that the school district works is um they put it on a schedule as to when the AC supposed to be on and when it's supposed to be off. And anytime it's off like this, there is no uh calling the um the the staff here at the the school and saying, "Hey, just turn on the AC." It don't work that way. It go through a whole process all the way back at the district level and uh and if they forgot to turn it on, you just have to deal with it. So, we thank God our journey has come to an end and uh we appreciate 3777 Jo. Um every time we pass by this location, we'll remember uh our days that we were here. As brother uh brother Quinton was telling me, uh really we're coming on our 4-year mark. August would be our four-year mark that we've been here in uh this building. But now the Lord has opened up another place for us to go and to worship. And uh we'll be sharing a facility there uh a church that has opened up their doors to allow us to come in. They only use it on Sunday mornings. So they they're giving us Wednesday nights, they're giving us two Fridays, and they're giving us every Sunday morning. uh we have to adjust our our our um times. You can just put that back up the slide there. We're adjusting our times on Sundays only. And um so Sunday's prayer will start 30 minutes earlier, go from 8:30 to 9:30. Sunday school will start a little earlier, start at 8:45, go to 9:15, and then rather than service starting at 10:30, service will start at 9:30 a.m. That's on Sundays uh only. Uh everything else will be um uh the same. So uh the name of the church that we'll be meeting at is Eagles Rest. That's not our church name. Our church name is Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. But we meet there and the address is there. 2922 uh Jog Grove Acres, Florida. Uh Greenacres is actually where we started the church. Uh right around the corner from this church is where we started. And um I come to find out that this church used to be in the same plaza that we were in in Green Acres when we first started. They took over another church there that was in Green Acres at the same time we were. And then uh that church moved on and they end up following that church to their new location. They took over the first location. Then they took over their second location. And uh so we have been neighbors for a long time. And uh I just believe the hand of the Lord has us moving in this direction uh for this season until we move into our own space. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just continue to trust the Lord. Uh brother JZ came and preached last week and um I went and walked around some property. That's all I can tell you. And I'm just waiting on the Lord to manifest. Amen. His word. So God is good. God is good. Amen. So, we thank God for all things. Thank God for you saints that came to be with us. Amen. On today, are y'all cruising work? Okay. Will you be here next weekend? Don't think so. Okay. All right. Well, good to have you all with us. Amen. Uh on today. Um, so next week church, uh, brothers, we're going to meet at the storage on next Thursday at 1:00 at the storage. That's where we have to get our things out and then take them to, um, the location for the meeting. So, we'll do that on next Thursday. We will have no service on uh, Wednesday night. Uh, we'll be preparing ourselves for the meetings on next weekend. Let's have a word of prayer. Amen. Before we depart, Father, we thank you for uh all that you have done and all that you continue to do. We are grateful as Lord, your man's servant came this morning and shared this thought on flashing red light signs. It was coming so much in that sermon as he's just even sharing at the end, brother Brandham calling out against the various sins of the people, Lord, and and uh it has to be dealt with. The people need to realize that the the enemy is attacking, Lord, in in in every area. So, Father, help us to to hear what the spirit is saying to us. That we would uh align ourselves with the word of God. That Lord Jesus, you'd be pleased with the lives that we will live. We thank you that you have given us eyes to see uh what the enemy is doing in this hour. And also, Father, you're giving us eyes to see what the spirit is doing in this hour. Lord, you have uh sent us a prophet and through the the revelation that has come forth uh through that prophet, the my God, we we the prophecies that have gone forth, we can God, we we we're reading uh tomorrow's newspaper today. And Lord, not that it alarms us and alerts us, but it helps us to prepare ourselves because we know that your coming is upon us. All these these signs, Lord, it's let let these are things that were supposed to happen before the second coming. Lord, they're right here before us. We're living in this day right now. Lord, don't let us get u mixed up and messed up. Father, help us to keep our eyes centered on you, Jesus. We ask, oh God, that as we leave this place, but not your presence, that you would go. Thank you for the saints that have come uh from far and from near to be a part of the service today, Lord. And uh we uh just uh thank you also for the years that you have given us here. And thank you for this door that was open for us to come in and have fellowship. And God now you have called us to another uh place. We go by faith knowing father that you have ordained every step that we take. We trust Lord that you would uh bless our our going out as you have blessed our coming in. And Lord, as we prepare for the meetings on next weekend, Father, move in a a mighty way in the midst of your people. May the spirit of God have the preeminence in that school. And Father, may people uh uh come one way, but leave a totally different way and lives be changed by the power of the Lord and by the word of God. We pray restoration will uh will happen in somebody's life. Oh God, we're already hearing testimonies of restoration happening. So God, we're expecting even more, Lord. Even healing in bodies and refillings and fillings of the Holy Spirit, Father, whatever the need of the people is, may they receive that. We pray, Father, that you would uh provide those that have a desire to be here, but baby Satan is is battling in their finances, God, uh supernaturally open up doors for them, Father, that they would be able to make these meetings. We've seen you, Lord, uh open up doors for people able to buy their plane tickets at the last minute. even got it less than what it was before. So, we know what you're able to do, God. You are God alone. And Father, we ask that you would move on behalf of your saints. And Lord, may they come with a heart of expectation, expecting you, Lord, to move in a in a in a very unique way. Bless us, Father, as we leave this place today. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Also, Brother Stanley, God bless you. Sister Vera, God bless you. Amen. Good to see you all. Amen. Praise the Lord. Yeah, I saw Sister Boyd. She She's not a visitor. No, she not a visitor. Amen. God bless you all. Brothers will come uh and dismiss you. And don't forget uh our brothers, we have to break down the room. Amen. On today. So, let us do that. And um we'll say goodbye. God bless you. I'll see you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
