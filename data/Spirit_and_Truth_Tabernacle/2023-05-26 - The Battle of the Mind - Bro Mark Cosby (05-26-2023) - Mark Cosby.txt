tonight I was told that uh today was the last day of school and uh we didn't plan to have a youth service on the last day of school but I think it's very appropriate a man that uh we have a youth service on that day and we we thank the Lord for bringing our kids through another year amen he watched over at them he kept them he protected them a man and you know just um uh you know there's nowadays we have to be so careful when we just send our kids to just public school you know you just never know what's going to happen but we uh thank the Lord that he stayed the hands of the enemy amen from from our children we certainly thank God for that amen and uh tonight um we just kind of going with the theme that we started this year like we you know we just gonna build it and they'll come right and uh and I and I um I just believe that no matter how many young people in the service if we just had one it's worth it amen for that one and uh we're gonna be faithful to the Lord with the with the ones that we have that God has given us we're going to try to give gonna sow into their lives and just just uh try to make sure that they're as successful as possible spiritually amen so we uh we we come tonight and uh just expecting God just to meet us here good to have brother Paul a member of the Paul Gene with us tonight amen he he had been telling me say his brother Jack when y'all do something let me know amen and uh because he he wanted to come and be in fellowship and you know we were we were kind of doing all the combined services and things like that and um you know it seemed like the devil just tried to get in and block a lot of that but uh we're gonna keep it going somehow amen we're going to keep it going somehow so good to have him amen here tonight and uh and and I'm I'm grateful for sister shaloman being over here she's doing a wonderful job wonderful jobs well my this is what the future looks like amen and amen and the future looks good amen so we're thanking the lord for her and and also tonight we we thank the lord we have with us for the first time uh brother quinton's Precious mom sister Geneva amen Elliott is with us tonight so good to have her amen this brother quinton's mom praise the Lord amen from Virginia amen she's here in Florida for a little bit and we just thank God Amen for for that amen been waiting for her for a long time amen but she's here in person so we we thank God for her amen amen well tonight uh we had been planning this amen for a little bit and um I I have a young brother that's gonna come and and Minister for us tonight and and uh I found out about him um kind of um almost unexpectedly and uh I was I was I was hearing about brother Mark having Bible studies and a man and just all these different people that would come and be a part of the Bible studies and Amen brother Jose and amen the family they start being a part of it because the way that we even got connected with brother Mark it was um almost uh I would just say it had to be divine because um you know we went to a Men's Conference there and I knew brother Mark before that but uh the other brothers didn't know him but we went to The Men's Conference and and I believe the person that was supposed to be in the room with brother Jose didn't show up to the Men's Conference and brother Mark comes in really late at night you know driving there and he gets there late at night and and uh and they uh so I think some kind of way brother Jose said he can just stay with me you know and they they got into the room together and I don't know how it happened but brother Josue had his clip was there gave her brother a haircut in his room and I mean they just had some real Fellowship they got connected you know at a pre pretty a powerful level there and you know they were just you know just some fellowship Brotherhood told me about the Bible says and say wow they would do it every Friday night and um you know or Friday nights I would say and then uh come to find out that as brother Mark was doing the the Bible study just different people joining from all over uh sister Abby was watching it and she said well you know what I can kind of help put your slides together to present you know the uh in the Bible study and I say uh sister I've been doing what she putting slides together presenting the Bible so I said well sister Abby can help us and you know in the church realize that she had a gift in that area right so uh that's why you see sister Abby over there behind amen the computer but here's the thing what blesses me is it's not what you come and do in public but it's what you're doing in private that God remembers amen and then he rewards you and puts you in public but you got to be doing the right things in Pride of it Hallelujah somebody amen so you know we we heard about that and I said you know what uh brother Marcus come down a couple times to visit us and you know I've been there to their Church once and I know the pastor my brother John A man also uh brother John's son-in-law his brother Aaron McGary amen so we there's you know just connections all over and uh so brother Mark was there and just faithful and and again I I I I like I I'll be honest with you I like finding brothers that's not looking to get in the pulpit amen I we like finding David's out there in the field playing their heart and don't nobody know about them but somehow Saul get wrapped up in some spirits and they need an anointed musician and then there's other people that tell us all about this guy that they know out there playing his heart so you need to get him to come in here because when he play you ought to see the animals just lay down but this fellow when he play he's anointed and they brought him out to play for Saul and you know it was God promoting David amen I love when God does that so uh we we all always want to try to create a platform where uh young ministers can go forth amen and and just Express their hearts to the Lord uh you know like I say uh I believe I believe it's strongly in the scripture a man's gift makes room for itself and brings them before great people you never have to push yourself into a Pulpit anytime I feel somebody pushing themselves I get I get a little weary of that but just wait for God to open up the door amen everywhere that I've gone and everywhere I'm scheduled to go is not me asking to go there but it's God opening up the door for me to go so I thank the Lord for it amen so it's hey man good to be here tonight and we want to a man just prepare our hearts to receive the word of the Lord uh precious brother Mark Cosby amen will be coming to speak for us a man from the state of Michigan uh but coming here to Florida uh he was here this time last year when we had to pick Nick and he's back again this year but this time he got some work to do so hey man we're looking forward to that so let's stand Taffy amen and let's uh let's just sing a song okay how sweet the sound [Music] that saved all right like me as our brother Mark Cosby comes oh I once was lost open now now I'm found oh I was blind but now I see come on sing with all your heart Amazing Grace oh wow [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Music] hey hey it's the honor and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord with the precious brothers and sisters I just thank brother Jack and the Lord for the opportunity to be here with you guys and thank you for all the prayers I appreciate it and um let's just break right open to the word of God we'll start in Mark chapter 10 verses 17 through 30. evade from the scriptures say Amen when you get there I'd love to hear Bible's turn amen verse 17 and he was gone forth into the way there came one running into the way and kneeled to him asking him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit internal life and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good is there none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and the answer is saying to him master all these have I observed from my youth up this wasn't some Infidel but this is a man who who follow the Commandments of God who who lived a clean life so isn't this anybody off the street but somebody who was trained in his youth up verse 21 then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that thou lack is this one thing he lacked not many things but one thing was stopping him from eternal life go thy way so whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved we had great possessions verse 23 and Jesus looked around about and saith on his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God and the disciples were astonished at his words but Jesus answereth again and saith unto him the children how hard is it for them that trust enriches to enter into the kingdom of God it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they were astonished at the measure and saying amongst themselves who then can be saved and Jesus said unto them with men it is impossible with God but With God all things are possible amen just bow our heads in the word of Prayer dear heavenly father we just thank you for this glorious opportunity Lord Lord we've came here in your house Lord just to meet with you Lord I pray father you prepare our hearts Lord as that Parable you spoke of the good ground Lord let each heartless be such a good ground that we could receive the Word of Life from you lord lord to speak to each one of us personally Lord may we take what you speak to us Lord let's apply it to our lives remember Paul just spoke about this uh about taking the word not just being here but being a doer of the word Lord and father we've come here Lord and we're so thankful that you've guided our footsteps and brought us here safely Lord this move your unworthy servant out the way Lord I don't have anything for him but you do Lord just use these lips Lord and speak Words of Life to your people Lord Jesus Lord take this gift that you've given me Lord and just use it to glorify yourself Lord Jesus Lord I pray you bless these scripture that's read he's quote that will be read I pray you bring it to life Lord just write your word Upon Our Hearts and Upon Our Minds Lord you know we invite your presence to take preeminence take control Lord ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen may be seated so we see this this Rich wrong ruler he was so he something in his heart he was seeking for he was missing he had a missing void in his heart and he knew there was something different about Jesus he could tell by the way Jesus conducted himself the spirit that Jesus had and he wanted what Jesus had right but when Jesus gave him what he needed to give up it wasn't something I wasn't like do this and do that but it was just one thing and follow me but the reason why Jesus told him to do this thing because one thing that was an idol in his life because we noticed brother Branham said anything you put before God is an idol your work can be an idol your family can be an idol and so Jesus was trying to make known to him that this riches was in his way right because it's not bad it's not a bad thing to have riches but it's a bad Jesus said it's a bad thing to trust then right he knows what Solomon Solomon didn't ask God for riches he asked how he can help his people and then God blessed them with those riches so notice notice the difference between those two and I don't know if you have that picture if we can put up but then 25 is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God and when I was studying this a long time ago I remember trying to picture what that really meant and then come to find out is that so a camel has to go through this really small door and he has to unload everything exactly right so let me read this quote see what a curse money enriches is no wonder Jesus says scarcely a rich man can enter the Gates of Heaven like a camel going through the eye of a needle has to unload his burdens check this out and get on his knees and crawl under and he can get there but he has to unload first so we have to unload first especially being being youth you got to know get to know God at your youthful ages because as you get older it's going to be a lot harder because the devil has worked on you he is trying to mold something inside of you so get to know God at a young age unload now don't wait to unload then because I waited until I was 24 and I had so much baggage that I had I brought in so many scars unnecessary scars and God was calling me before but I didn't want to live that life and I had to pay the price right so I'm speaking for you guys don't pay the price that I had to pay amen I'm an example that you don't have to follow now follow the example I'm now leading follow me as I follow Christ amen so the thing is right now but the thing is we got so many influences we got social media everybody's trying to get that check mark everybody's trying to be famous but you don't know what that life has in store what they do behind closed doors you may see what they look like in a video but what they're doing behind closed doors you don't know about the stress the unnecessary things you have to go through so all these influences we got in the world this is one of the hardest days for a youthful person to live in it's the hardest I thought it was hard when I was growing up but now it's so much junk that the devil has just promoted things that used to be wrong are now right and this is craziness and so we got all these we got Hollywood trying to influence our youth with Fashions Hollywood trying to get in our homes right half people have Bibles nowadays then they kicked God out of schools and they wonder why there's there's gun shootings all the time because you kick the very person that can protect you from all these things praise God so as young people don't compromise because all those things Fame Fortune they're going to pass away one day but what's done for Christ won't pass away amen God is trying to call you now he has a certain path he wants to lead you but you got to let that door in your heart as he knocks on it open onto him let him have entrance he wants to his plans to prosper you to give you an expected end he wants to he won't not just bless you in the natural right but he wants you to Soul to Prosperity that's the most important thing to prosper is your soul because just because God has blessing us with all these Financial things and cars doesn't necessarily even mean that we have a strong walk with God but what indicates you have a strong walk with God each time you enter into these doors your nature is changing God is trying to change you from the inside out that's why it's so important as a young person to be born again receive that spirit because you receive that Spirit the devil can't get in if he would get in he had this go the same process that you would have to go through amen so everyone is following somebody how many believe that somebody somebody's influencing your life and that's why I say it's so important get off a social media I'm not saying you can't use social media but don't be trying to follow everybody you see we got all these bad influences that's right in this life that's right so be careful who you're following be careful who you're associating with because they might have a spirit on them that could catch upon you and you don't want that Spirit to catch upon you because Spirits are dangerous you see that man Legion he had over ten thousand Spirits think about that and he didn't even know what he was doing half the time amen so we can't compromise with the word of God we got to stay stand on the word of God it's the only this is the book that tells you where you came from and where you're going it's the only book that can change you but this book can't be read like an encyclopedia let God bring the word to life in front of your face Paul said the letter kills but the spirit bring it to life and I believe you're not too young to have a personal walk with God you're not too young to be filled with the Holy Ghost to seek God with all your heart with all your might and said in Jeremiah amen so at a young age the enemy is trying to gain control of your mind the prophet said the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind right and the title the title of this service is Battle of the Mind because every day we're in a battle whether you like it or not each day you wake up that's when the battle begins each day you wake up you can either hit your knees or not hit your knees but if you don't hit your knees you're going to lose the battle for the day so you get your strength from on your knees connecting with God the greatest thing a man and woman can do is get in connection with their creators to get to know them in a personal way because God is always moving he's always trying to speak to us but if we're not in that connection We're not gonna be able to hear what he has for our lives hey man so the tactic of the enemy is to get us to reason because I can't say that amen and the reason and the thing is like he likes to get our youth at such a young age because your mind is developing you're learning things but as you get older if he can get in there he can mold his agenda see the enemy has an agenda God has an agenda and the enemy has an agenda and the enemy likes to paint this picture that looks so good but he doesn't tell you the consequences that it has he didn't tell you the pain that it will bring in the future in the short term he doesn't tell you all these things he is like a get rich quick screen he doesn't tell you what's going to happen after you get rich amen so he wants to change your thinking to a certain pattern he's trying to plant Little Seeds which are his thoughts he has he's he's cunning he's crafty he's Sly let's go in the Book of Genesis 3. we'll see how he first taught this wicked serpent go to Genesis chapter 3 and we'll read verses one through eight amen now the serpent was more acceptable than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea had God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden so this this this devil asked this question to this woman and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said he should not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die so far so good she's giving the word back what God Said but we want to see if she take if she stands on the word because anybody can mouth the word but it takes a lot to be able to stand in the word of God and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die notice he didn't change the whole thing he just changed point one percent of it right and that's how Sly and cunning he's not gonna come with pitchfork and fire but he's gonna come so slick and so Sly he's going to use 99 of the word but not all of it and if we're not sober and we're not Vigilant we're gonna miss it you got to know your word not just know it here but know it here brother Bram said I'd rather know the author than know the word because if you know the author you're going to know the word because God in his word are one you can't you can't separate him you can't forgot just knowing the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open he shall be as God's knowing good and evil see that Temptation that Satan gave her of fame or we could say being just like God and he painted this picture to her and she has a choice either to accept it or to reject it and we're going to see the decision she made and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat in the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sue fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so we see if we go down to we'll go to 11 verse 11. and he said who had told that thou was naked as out eating of the tree where for our community that should not eat and then one man said the woman whom thou gave is to me to be with she gave of the tree and I did eat see human nature is always trying to blame somebody else for their mistakes if they would have just took accountability for what they did she's trying to point fingers but in reality the devil can't make you do anything you you got to make the choice to say what you got to he what are you saying to you see the devil can fly over your head and put these thoughts but you gotta be willing to kick those thoughts out don't let the devil living in your land don't let the devil live in your mind you can take control of your mind casting on all imaginations and bringing every thought into the subjection of Jesus Christ amen and the man said the woman who thou gave us me to be was she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto a woman what is that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begotten United eat and the Lord God said to his servant because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon liability thou shall go in the dust thou she days of thy life so we see the the recompense of their decision right so we got to think about the decisions that we make right there's going to be consequences they can be good consequences or bad consequences in my life when I was young I made decisions and they had bad consequences it hurt me mentally physically things that I can't unsee that I've done and so I'm telling you guys don't get into those things that the devil is trying to tempt you because he'll take you further than you want to go you give the devil an end she'll take a mile all day and all night amen many are like Eve this is from a 1960 uh 12 11. many are like Eve Eve just stopped long enough to be deceived think about that she stopped long enough to begin to reason that's the Satan's main goal is to get you the reason he wants to stop you long enough you begin to think and we begin to think you kind of lay aside the word of God amen she hadn't stopped there there never been no deceiving but Eve stop so when Satan comes stand upon the word of God right Jesus showed us how to combat the devil he used the word young people use the word of God don't be scared to stand Upon Jesus name there's power in the name of Jesus amen amen do you instead of pressing on do you know you follow follow me closer now listen the reason Eve was deceived let's say it together so I'll be sure you get it the reason Eve was deceived she never kept the full word of God she kept some of the word of God but if you take some of the word if you take the sum you lose the power of it right you got to have if I have a car I can't just have all the bells and whistles not have an engine in it because you can look nice just sitting there posting up but if there's no engine in there that car doesn't have the power and so that when you need all the word of God to have the full power Haven amen hallelujah Satan quoted it to her but he never told her all the truth neither does the denomination but she stayed long enough to get part of the word and didn't take all the words and so we see decisions brother Graham says are made in the mind in the head there's where Satan meets you and decisions are because that God made a man that way so God made us to think God made us to use our mind but we got to use our mind the way he intended for us to use it because the word of God first has to travel into your head and then we either you accept it or reject it it could become Revelation if you truly accept it so when that word is coming you got to say Lord this is all for me don't say don't Pitchfork it and say this is for this person that person but you take that word in just rate that word in as young young people you can't pray too much you can't read the word of God too much you can't be in the message the hour too much because it's going to build a foundation in your life God is trying to build us into houses all right and the foundation has to be faith in him faith in his word so as young people stay in the word of God keep seeking the Lord on your knees say God I need to know you more than life itself I don't want what this world has I know what this world has is death you could have all the fame and all the money you want but the end of your life is going to lead to death and destruction and we see the consequences of what happened to Adam and Eve and Adam was made perfect but he still had three more agency and you have the same three more agency that all of us does right choose you this day whom you'll serve that's what Joshua told Joshua told us amen now I have if he was looking at my note here a little map drawn out here I had it not here long enough used on the board the human being is made up like a grain of wheat it's a seed and the human beings exceed physically you're the seed of your father and mother and the life come from the father then the pulp come from the mother so the two to two together the egg the blood comes together and the blood cell is life and there it begins amen developing the child now any seed has a shell on the outside the inside pulp amen let's go to 72. now if you sit down here you get home and draw the three little rings you'll find out that human being has five senses so these five senses weren't used to contact God because these five senses were used to contact our Earthly home and so there's a soul inside of us that each one of us has right and that's where the word of God has to go to it can't fall in the flesh it has to go deep down in here because in each one of us there's a thirsting inside of us for God you can either choose to fill it with the things of the world or the things of God it's a black dog and a white dog inside of you if you feed the white dog then God is going to be preeminent in your life you feed the black dog then Satan is going to be primitive in your life and each day you have a choice what dog that you feed yeah do you feed the black dog you're serving Satan for the day and maybe a harsh thing to say but it either serve God or Satan whoever you yield Your Vessel to e i remember I was in the world I yielded my vessel to Satan right I still said I believed in God but I wasn't living for God all right I was running away from God and I wonder why my life was in such turmoil and such destruction because I was running away from the very thing that could give me peace that I was looking for looking for peace and alcohol and all these other avenues and I could never find got a tattoo all these things I was trying to find peace in and every every time I'll go to it I just needed more or some this and that and that and that so I say young people go to God right now go to God right now it'll be the best decision you ever made in your life when I gave my heart to God when I was going to my second job in my car I just cried out to God and gave my heart to say Lord you know exactly where my life needs to go and when I made that decision my life was clear I had peace was life was life just easy you know I had my my twists and turns and hardships but I remember every time I'll be like in a situation I'll go back to that day and remember I met with God in that car and that's what anchored me ever since my life has not been the same I've had joy unspeakable and full of Glory see happiness is based on circumstances but joy doesn't look at circumstances Joy is looks at the word of God the joy of the Lord is my strength amen amen amen so inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memories reasons affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit has only one sense the spirit oh let's get in that Spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominated it's either Faith or doubt you can either believe this word is for you or you can doubt tonight this word is for you I pray that you believe that it's for you because if you believe it is for you then it can change you because that's all God wants to do is change us to mold us to shape us let the master Potter mold you young people let them mold you at a young age don't do what I did in my my youthful ages I wasted so much time I wish I would have gave my heart earlier to God I would have I wanted so much heartache I could have just left behind hey man amen you can accept the faith either when you went to work therefore Satan began at the principal part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word because Satan knows that there's power in the word of God he knows if you're not connected then you are powerless Jesus said power is given to me in heaven and in Earth so he knows if you connect to God then he can't do anything to you but he knows if he can get you to doubt one eye out of one punctuation one comma then he has you right there because I can't defeat the Devil you can't defeat the Devil by yourself because this flesh God didn't come to redeem this flesh he came to us to redeem us inside of you that's what he came that Soul that's inside of you that's what he saw he didn't care about this fleshly body because we have one waiting for us on the other side amen amen so I looked the word acceptable it's Sly Artful cunning and crafty so we get we get the enemy some credit because he's a worthy adversary we can't underestimate him because because Eve underestimated look what happened so he he's insinuating he's deceitful he's treacherous and he beguiled which means to delude to deceive to impose on by a certain crap so we got to recognize that the enemies are roaring lines seeking who he may devour but if we can be aware of that get to know your enemy get to know that his main goal is to get you to doubt that's right and if you can recognize when doubt comes in because Satan knows the word front and back he believes that there's one God all these people thinking there's three guys was even Satan believed there's one God and so we got to know this enemy and we got to be aware and vigilant amen let's go to First Peter 5. first Peter 5 first Peter first Peter 5. read a couple verses in there amen so reverse five five so likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder so it's very important to be submissive to the Elder your parents has been brother Bram said your Holy Ghost is your parents until you get it right and so how you treat others is how you treat God so if you're disrespectful to your parents then you're being disrespectful to God so such important at a young age when I was growing up I said what they're like what you say boy I mean yes yes ma'am yes Dad and so I know sometimes we say what to say yes be respectful and so so likewise your younger submit yourself unto the Elder be submissive to your parents your parents know what you need are they perfect no are you perfect no everybody's going to make a mistake so just just take your parents at your word that they're trying to train you up as the Lord is teaching them how to train you up and just just follow them as they follow Christ they have the best intentions for you they want to see you become a holy ghost-filled Christians see you're the Youth for Tomorrow as we get older you're gonna have to step into that role but you got to be connected with God see Abby back there oh see as the Youth of tomorrow right there Joe you might be a preacher one day and we're trying to train you but you brother Jack can have a personal walk for you you got to have your own personal walk for you you got to seek it after your dad can't do it for you I can't do it for you but you got to meet with God everybody has to meet in the backside of the desert like Moses did you've got to amen you remember boys the first little corn silk cigarette you smoked you know what mama said you know you was afraid your mom was going to smell it on your breath you got some bad coffee and eat something there and you know you keep it from smelling so we get more deeper than that mama said let me smell your breath mama there's nothing wrong with me what's the first thing when you lied that first lie so let's talk about how important is we don't think oh I just lied a little bit but we're gonna see what that lie turned into this individual's life see a small little lie can lead into something so greater than what you realize a red light began to flash to tell her the truth be honest little boy mama taught you not to do that but you see you fight your your way right on through that barricade and the red light see you remember the first time you you trifling your girlfriend you remember the first time you sashed your wife you sass the husband we could even say sash your parents back talk to your parents we can put that in there remember the first time you heard that hymn sang at church and something beat in your heart and you just shook it off for yourself and turned away it'll do some other time them as all red lights you see and you walk just over them warnings don't you go that way you're going that way little boy little girl turn back to me I am your creator but you walk right on through it you can't accept nothing else don't lay it unto God if you run through that that stoplight out there don't say the city's in blame no sir you're the fault the stoplight is there to protect you see God wants to protect us we got to let him be that Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha you got to know him as a deliverer know him as your rock your savior your strong tower your healer amen you can't accept nothing else don't lay it on God the spot the spot stop lies there to protect you and to help you you must obey it and that isn't a city's fault it's your fault because you should have stopped when the warning come on and when you feel that buzzer down in your heart warning you then you better stop and take inventory amen like I was been preaching all along through the nights of the people drifting away from God when you hear the word of God come right back to truly the word of God there's a little buzzer Rings you better listen to it now don't walk across that you'll never get any further until you come right back where you left them where you leave Christ at by failing to obey his word right there he will leave you he don't leave you leave him see you always leave him because he has got you in the path he's trying to lead you but see when you leave him leave him you come right back to him before you left him again let me go to this next quote the LIE the LIE the liar you might take one said uh to a man one day I thought was telling jokes and he come to find out he told so many lies till he really believed them think about that himself and I said what makes you do that and I sit down and talk with him I said I want to ask you those stories are too wild for people to believe he said the first one I ever remember telling knows that the first one he ever been telling I was a little boy that was raised in a good home I believe you're all raised in good homes he said I went out and smoked a corn silk cigarette just to be smart I ate some coffee to take it off my breath and he said I've done it back behind the old chimney behind the house and he said I'll never forget when my mother caught up and said to me Sonny let me smell your breath and I blowed my breath into her face and she said you'd eat coffee to take something off your breath what have you been doing have you been smoking cigarettes and he said something told me see something told him to tell the truth notice that that's a little conviction that God gives us and I remember in a world when I had a little convictions and I was like I don't need to follow that right now and it took me further than I wanted to go it almost ruined my life completely almost destroyed me nobody knew the the diction that I had but it was destroying me from the inside out amen he said Something Told Me To Tell the Truth he said I said no ma'am I crossed my heart I have been smoking I haven't been smoking cigarettes he said from that time it started you know from that time it started we can all find something that begin at a certain time and from then on things will change and there's other worthy things that we could think of men with good intention has tried to start a things Anew to do certain things brother Bram said this other statement always tell the truth no matter what takes place so young people if you've done something wrong don't try to hide it you see this individual you try to hide it and he went back to that first lie he told and ruined his whole life so just be honest just be truthful because one lie he become to a liar that's habitually this lying lying lying lying lying lying and then nobody can tell you tell nobody knows what the truth is anymore let's go to First John chapter 2. first John chapter 2 verses 15 through 17. so we see the love love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him so we go back to the Rich Young Ruler he loved the world he loved he loved riches more than he loved than when he wanted to serve God now I promise you I even guarantee you after Jesus left he still kept the Commandments he probably still did all these good things gave to the poor but those things didn't save him he he was face to face with eternal life maybe Jesus is calling you right now don't reject it it might be your last time I'm not saying it will but you never know tomorrow is never promised life is but a vapor I'm here I'll be 29 this year been out of high school a decade you know a decade flew by and don't let your life just pass you by without giving all of yourself to Jesus Christ I promise you it's beneficial it's beneficial he'll give you the guidance leadership God honors faithfulness I prom I could I get a little testimony I remember almost two years ago I was uh kicked out my house for serving the lord and believing the message of the hour I'd say one thing I didn't turn back I kept going I kept going see God knows what to do how to rough ruffle some feathers sometimes to get you out of places and I just I just kept my eyes on Jesus Christ because I knew the pastor didn't call me but Jesus called me personally and I didn't have to ride on the pastor of the coach my pastor's coattails but the very thing that he preached I received the word that he preached I was receiving it and so anyways in that scripture I remember that scripture came to came to my mind Lord brought it when my dad kicked me out of my house how he didn't come to bring peace but he came to bring a sword said a man that variance with the the father or the son and that came to me I was like all right scripture being fulfilled in my life praise God let's go and so I kicked dollars over my grandma um it was July 4th like two years ago it was like July 5th got kicked out and I didn't know I wasn't worried I wasn't was scared I was looking for places to go and then I remember I kind of just stopped looking because I couldn't find anything and the sister in my church was driving by and she found this uh place for rent and she talked to the person see if it's open I called him and Todd his name is Todd and I got an interview and the application out he looked at my social media and said oh you're a Christian huh I was like yeah I was like huh he's like oh perfect so anyways I think three months goes by and during those three months I didn't know how I was gonna buy furniture I didn't know how I was gonna get a guest bed I didn't know how I was gonna get dishes pots and pans and I promise you like two months before I moved in the Lord furnished everything I have neither everything guest beds pots and pans everything and even to check this out like it's a two bedroom beautiful place peaceful 750 a month I don't even expecting and then somebody in my work there these two people were chipped in together and got me a ninja air fryer brand new literally brand new ninja air fryer and so just some more of the story God honors faithfulness be faithful to God he promised your barn is going to overflow all these things he promises just take God as his word taste and see if the Lord taste them see see if he's really real amen so verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so the same That's what Satan used that's his tactic that's his blueprint he uses with Eve with all of us all throughout the ages you can go from Adam all the way till now he uses the same thing to get you off the track see sin is beautiful but it's rotten to the core it may feel good see the flesh likes to feel good the flesh loves entertainment it loves to be entertained that's why you see all these mega churches not trying to talk against the mega churches but all these mega churches there's so many people because it appeals to the flesh entertainment lights smoke fog all these things Prosperity messages but God isn't isn't trying to give us a Prosperity message he wants to give us prosperity of the Soul that's what God is looking for and like I said if you're faithful to God he's going to bless you it's simple as that young people be faithful learn faithfulness because if God gave us his best we deserve to give God our best every day we can't be taking days off can't be taking days off got imagine if God took a day off on you how you feel maybe a car crash that you protects you from you getting a car crash because he didn't protect you but God he can't take days off he died he became you so you can become him think about that think about that love that was on the cross he could say it's finished and that finished part was giving you an Avenue that you can connect with him personally when you're in the hardest time the hardest trial of your life you can enter into that strong tower enter into that secret place he's a present help in the present time and I could say I've been there many times because the enemy knows just exactly what to how to just Crush you put that pressure but we have a place where we can go when that pressure comes then like when the enemy comes in like a Floodgate God raises the standard don't ever forget that amen and so in the world passes the way so we can get millions and millions of dollars we can replace that with God but at the end of the day you're gonna have to answer the account for that and so young people God is going to supply your needs Matthew 6 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added on to you he knows you need the bills paid he knows you need lights he knows you need a car he knows you need food just seek his face first put him first he's going to take care of you he promised to take care of you all you have to do is seek the perfect will that he has for your life he has a purpose for all of us you young people he has a purpose for your life just believe in that purpose he's going to lead you through he promised to leave he's I'll be with you and in you into the end of the world he said I won't leave you comfortless but you got to receive that comforter you got to you got you amen but in the Garden of Eden the devil chose the man's head God his heart now the Devil comes into intellectual and has brought his religion to the intellectual you'll never know God intellectually you've got to know him by a new birth being born again which comes from the heart and we see in Ezekiel he said a news a new heart I'll give you a heart of Flesh he said I'll give you a new spirit but a lot of people stop at that you got to go on to receive his spirit inside of you because you can you can be justified and Sanctified you could have been an alcoholic and God delivers you from that but if you never get that field then Devil's going to come back even with more yes so this sanctification isn't enough you gotta go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be sealed unto the day of your Redemption amen so the pride of life the lust of Flesh what the eye can see but when God comes in he gets into a man's heart and makes him believe things by faith that his eyes cannot see we don't serve God by his sight we serve God by his faith how many can testify when God was leading in Direction you know where he was going but you trusted him and he led you all the way through so you got to trust that God knows what he's doing let God be God in your life don't you try to be God in your life but let God be God in your life don't let him just be God in certain areas of your life but give him lordship over everything in your life because there's so many doors in our heart as the prophet told us we've got to be willing to open those doors you can't hide anything from God David tried to hide what he did in God's sight and look what happened when we talk about that we see what David did with Bathsheba and he thought he can hide it he thought that God didn't even know but I can just hide this thing I can get I can get uh Uriah to go here with his wife to make think it's his kid but Uriah didn't do that Uriah was faithful and then he sent this man to his death and and when he did that Nathan and the prophet came and he told him this little parable about this this rich man taking this Jeep they was like oh this man should die he's like David that was you you're the man and so just to go back look at the consequences the decision that he made his kingdom was taken from him his son was trying to kill them all because he was trying to hide something that lie that he tried to do it ruined his whole life he was still a man that forgot his own heart but his relationship was not the same he was running constantly so young people don't try to hide anything from God you can't this be oh if David was open and honest it would be a different story but he wasn't and he was still he was still growing with God and everything but he made that one mistake don't think when you get filled with the Holy Ghost and serving God that you can't make mistakes and you're just Untouchable you're not you got to repent every day it says be zealous therefore and repent because he's knocking at that door and he's called us to be Overcomers right right but it's not necessarily you doing the overcoming but is you getting out the way and surrendering so the Overcomer can overcome inside of you you gotta believe if he's called you he's predestinated he's called you he's equipped you he's equipped you with all the tools that you need which is him inside of you the god inside of you can handle any problem anywhere but you gotta let God do that we gotta stop trying to be God in our lives it just gives you stress it gives you worry it gives you grief and if you got all these things then you can't have your your eyes on God we see Peter is walking on the water as soon as he took his eyes off of Christ he began to sing the same thing with us as soon as you take your eyes off of Christ your life will sink we got to keep our eyes on the Creator that's where the power is that's where Deliverance is that's where peace is that's what Revelation is that's all these things that we have need of is in God but we try to go all these outside influences self-help classes motivational speaking all these things aren't going to help you these things are going to pass away but what God has given you is all you need all you need he wants to part the Red Sea in your life let him Park the Red Sea in your life God told Moses go forward speak don't cry speak amen amen so a quick look at those scriptures involving the Lord Jesus will bring the truth of the proposition in Matthew 4 where Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only so if you want to stop Temptations at right at the root word of God every time Amen in these three major trials they corresponded exactly to temptation of the Garden of Eden the lusts of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word notice that that's the only way we can overcome is by the word they overcame by the blood and by the word of their testimony love not on their lives that love not their lives unto death amen lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word eve fell to personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell and direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this the only way to being overcomer also is the only way you can know it if you're overcoming because the word that word Can't Fail notice that so the enemy job we said before is to try to get you to stop we get you to stop and think and reason then he has you right then and there and so the goal of the enemy is to destroy you but Jesus prayed for you he's giving he he gave himself for you so you didn't have to be destroyed by the enemy because he defeated the enemy don't let it defeat it creature defeat you I'ma say it again don't let it defeated creature defeat you because look in the back of the book we win so what do we have to fear let's go back to First Peter 5. finish that up amen so we see likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay notice this all you be subject one to another so we got to be subject one to another a body of the body of Christ has to be able to function together we're not all going to like the same things you might like basketball might like football you might like Miami Heat I might like the Lakers but we're not here to agree on these things we're here to agree in the word of God that's the most important thing is to agree in the word of God most important thing amen all of you be subject one to another nurse and be clothed with humility if you want to grow with God humility is your best friend a humble and contrite spirit and no wise will I despise amen humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time verse 7 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you he cares for you he even knows when the tears that don't make a sound hit the ground he knows when he had the worst day of your life he knows all these things just release it on to him getting your knees and just seek him sometimes he ever pray you don't know what they even say he knows he knows he knows that's right amen casting all your care not just some of your care cast all your burdens be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devout so he's looking for he's he's looking for the weak he's looking for the ones who not trusting in God that's when he knows he can devour but he says brother Brown said the weakest Christian on his knees and the devil tremble think about that the weakest Christian on his knee so you got to fight your battles on your knees stop trying to fight your battles here bite them on here neology amen says whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace with called us unto his eternal no it's called us it's called each one of us in here all who's lived on a live stream he's called you by Christ Jesus after you have suffered a while to make you perfect so how many has ever been through a trial and this feels like the worst trial ever and you're like man like why am I in this trial like why but notice right here that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen and settle you that's what these trials are here for they're more precious than gold you think about each trial you go through you complete that's one step closer to the rapture that's one step closer for your more growth so Paul said I glory in my infirmities think about that his persecutions because he wasn't looking at the trial himself but he was looking what God's goal was for that trial because trials aren't just here just to annoy you but they're here for a specific purpose they help you grow I've seen what the statement the devil was so deceived he doesn't realize that he's being used to point you closer to Christ think about that he's being used so you can have a closer walk with Christ and he doesn't even realize that's how deceived he is so he he's you see God had this master plan and Satan's falling right into it and doesn't even realize it Amen to be him be glory and Dominion forever amen so it's important we'll close here in the next couple of minutes it's important who you surround yourself with young people older people it's important who we surround ourselves with the friends that you have are either going to influence you or you're going to influence them it's no in between there's no down the middle you want to make sure first things first who they're serving that's are they serving God are they serving that that's the first thing you want to know because many people can say they serve God but the fruit of their life is going to really prove they're really serving God amen so you don't want somebody who's going to make you compromise on your beliefs or you're not even make you but influence you to even have that idea or thought to compromise on your beliefs Jim Rohn said this you are the average of The Five People You spend the most time with think about that and this is a quote from Sydney Poitier you might remember him he said this either he says when you walk with someone something unspoken happens either you match their Pace or they match yours so think about the people you're hanging around with are you influencing them are they influencing you that's the question because it's easy to get one another Spirits we don't want one another Spirits we want God's spirit amen so we want the cross it's from 1962 1013. we see the influence of another brother Brandon preached that so many times not just by coincidence but for a reason because the influence of another is so important so I suggest go back and listen to some of those so we want the cross we want Christ now while we can don't be influenced by men who may be consent more pores down don't be influenced with men with a better machine to ride in or better home to live in and sell your birth rights to Christ don't you do it watch what you're doing always follow the one who's influenced and is backed up by god notice the prophet giving us that precious Golden Nugget right there always follow those who are influenced and is backed up by God and that you know where God is with them don't follow the wrong influence yes all right let's go to Hebrews 12. so how many remember the story of Esau so he sold his Birthright think about that for a bowl of porridge and we're going to see the Bible talks about them again we'll go to verse 16 12 16. unless there be any fornicated or profane person as Esau who for one more so of meat sold his birth I think about that and look look what 17 says for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for it think about no place of repentance though he sought for it carefully with tears so don't miss the day of your visitation God has appointed day your visitation might be the last time that you've ever get that visitation and Esau missed his visitation he sold it he sold it for fame and fortune and then he tried to seek for it he tried to sought after it but it was closed so don't wait and don't say well wait till I'm 20 I want to experience the world a little bit I want to wait till I'm 18 I want to experience the world a little bit it might be too late then you might have went too far too far so don't take that chance I'm thankful that God gave me I remember the year I gave my heart to the Lord I remember he was just I just fell in my heart if I didn't answer that call it'll be the last time you would have called me so I was like you know Lord I'm gonna do the way you want me to do like I'm tired of doing it my way it's it's LED this this led to everything in my life that's going wrong and I get like I said I gave my life to him everything changed the way I thought the music I listened to I was trying to take those things away myself let God take those things away from you see see a lot of times imagine if God came to you brother Jack when you first gave your heart to him he told you everything you had to give up at one time imagine how overwhelmed you'll be but God knows when to say certain things like like my son my daughter I want you to give this up and once you just keep doing that it becomes easier and easier easier so let God just do what he needs to do yes he is he wants to lead and guide you into all truth amen let's go to Second Corinthians 6 14. how are we doing on time [Laughter] amen 6 14. it says be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers what Fellowship has righteousness one in righteousness so another our other Prophet Paul talking is the importance of not being unevenly yoked and I'll never forget just how many have lost friends when you give your heart to the Lord close friends it's a reason because it's a different spirit inside of you now in the spirit that's inside the other person you can't come together it's impossible that's why Paul said and he says and what Concord has Christ with real or what part hath he that believed with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the temple of God and he said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God I just love how God just claims us he said I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate God is calling us out he called us out he's still calling us closer and we can't let the world creep in the world that Satan knows how to just creep in and your biggest enemy is yourself not necessarily Satan Conway Satan can use this flesh if you yield it to him so you got to recognize the biggest enemy the race that you're running you're not running against brother Jack or you're not running against brother Joe but you're running against yourself the only person is going to stop you from making a Rapture is yourself so that's why Jesus you got to crucify yourself daily that's why that's why I get out get out when I wake up in the morning first thing I do is trying to hit my knees because I know my flesh does not want to serve God not one night older so getting your knees and just say Lord what do you want me to do today what is your will for my life today and I believe he'll tell you that if your honest and sincere he'll tell you what exactly what he wants you to do I believe it amen wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you I will be a father unto you and he shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty look at that promise if we do these things God isn't asked God's hand in Simplicity he's not asking do all these things and jump on one foot and do a backflip he's just asking simply take me at your work take me at my word surrender to me make me Lord of your life not just savior but Lord and savior because anybody can make him save her Lord save me from my sins but I still want to live my own life but say Lord I'm here for you take my heart like brother Jerry was talking about Samson Samson gave God strength but never his heart and that's why he ended up the way he did he he didn't have to be that way but he gave the wrong he gave not everything off of God so don't let any don't let any woman or any any boy in your life destroy you don't do that amen close oh be conscious here's only one thing to be conscious of your your littleness you want to get somewhere with God make yourself real little don't make yourself big like uziah he got in there and said I'll do this anyhow whether you ain't got no business telling me see he should have humbled himself young people don't get I I know it all spirit trust me I had it my dad always always had to be right my dad used to always tell me boy you always got to be right huh always getting Arguments for no reason so don't thank you everything figured out because you don't you don't your parents have been around the block a couple times so this is trust they know what they're doing man don't say oh I know I know instead of saying I don't say I know they say yes sir yes ma'am thank you for teaching me this lesson because we always get some attitude or roll our eyes or pop our lips or something don't do that's disrespectful God has given your parents for a reason and he expects you to respect him because if you don't respect them you're not respecting God God demands reverence and respect and how are we treating our parents our elders in the church adults is going to really show our relationship with God it is it's a direct reflection relationship with God he should have made himself humble the Servants of Christ pardon me he never took leprosy no I know that's your job God called you that's your office yeah go ahead and do it sirs I'm very sorry backed off there had been a different thing written in this book but he was corrected and he got angry you correct people about something or tell them about their wrong doing they'll leave the church they'll go to somebody to to a woman they shouldn't wear short hair they'll go somewhere they can't wear it so I've been guilty that you know somebody may tell you something that you did wrong and you may not say it outwardly but Karen in release even more dangerous think about that even in release even more dangerous the Bible tells us do all things without murmuring and disputing because God is looking at the attitude your attitude is going to be a direct reflection of your walk growing God can't do anything with a bad attitude see what happened to your desire he had leprosy just that one decision he made no more King and he was leprosy to the day he died just based upon that one decision so you got to really take inventory of the thoughts you're thinking the decisions you're making see where your life is gravitating towards because wherever your life is gravitating towards you're going to prove if you're walking with Christ where your desires where your where your thoughts where your goals at are going to show you where you're going because David was a man of self-inventory he said search me oh God try me there be any wicked way in me because we got to realize our heart is deceitful only God knows the heart so don't say oh I know my heart you don't know in your heart the Bible tells us that so be open to honest with God every day take inventory Lord is there anything in my life that I shouldn't be holding on to anything in my life that is hindering me from walking with you in the fullness that you've called me to walk in if we're that honest that's how growth can happen we got to be we're coming too close the time is at hand we don't have much time we got to get right with God every day still plant your potatoes but live like he's coming today still because you never know it could be your last breath I could go out here be my last sermon I ever preached so that's all serious we got to take this life you see the prophet was taken off the scene nobody expected that nobody expected that so don't think it's any different for us we'll go to close in James five close so reverse or verse 13. so it says oh sorry James 4 verse 13. go to now you that say today or tomorrow we would go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gains sometimes we like to plan our lives right down to a T and don't even include God in it and then then we get we wonder why we're all frustrated and flustered when it didn't go right is that what God wanted is that his will or your will cause it's a big difference between your will and God's will my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways simple as that go to verse 14 whereas you know that what should be in the morrow for what is your life it's even a vapor I can testify that I got gray hair I'm just like man where's my like is this is crazy how fast life just goes by like you you blink in high school goes to your almost 30. it's just crazy so it's even a vapor that appeared for a little time and then vanished it away but you ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now you're rejoicing your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore it's to him that knoweth to do good and do it to him and his sin so that's iniquity you knowing that you know when to do something and not doing it so in closing from the stage four let's just make a decoration to walk that much more closer to the guy every single day don't be satisfied I had a good prayer time yesterday or last week strive for a deeper more sincere and more intimate prayer time with God that's all God he wants you there's he doesn't necessarily want your money you can't replace that you can't say oh God just take my money and I'll just do my own thing because obedience is better than sacrifice I can sacrifice all day and all night but if I'm not doing what God has called me to do when we're closing so God is not obligated to give you any more light if you're not falling in the light he's already giving you think about that so we want this Revelation but are you following what God's already calling you to just be obedient man obedience is key you if you want to if you want to touch the heart of God be obedient to him simple as that King saw he would have his kingdom would have been forever but he decided to be disobedient to God and that's why David took over Amen to young people driving don't let the don't let the world get in don't let the world tempt you with its death because it may it may sound good it may be good may be good but it's not good it's not gonna be worth it I promise I can I can testify that person praise God I would like to write our precious brother jack up [Applause] amen we certainly appreciate uh the Lord to speaking to us there through brother brother Mark Cosby uh just a lot of nutrients I believe that was there in the uh in in the sermon and I think something that's very very helpful uh for not just the young people but for all of us amen so much so much that was said there and um I um I'm grateful I'm very grateful sometimes you get a chance to sit back and just look and see what God is doing in the next Generation Um it uh puts a big smile on your face you know somebody's holding on somebody's uh trying to do something just to kind of help their fellow man along the way and um and it's just you know just a blessing it's a real blessing so young people I hope y'all all taking something uh tonight amen and and um me I brought my notepad so I can just go back and look at some of the notes that I wrote but it was uh it was refreshing very very respect refreshing brother Mark we appreciate you and man the battle of the Mind my mind he was talking about that rich young ruler and you know and what he had to do was give up his uh give it riches but you have to ask this Chef the question tonight what is God asking you to give up and remember uh with the Rich Young Ruler it was only one thing only one thing that kept him from receiving eternal life so you have to ask yourself a question what is it that God is asking you to give up a man in your life and then I loved I love the the other statement he made about when you come to Christ it's not him telling you all these don't do this don't do don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't I mean because everybody you know we when we we try to just pour all that on people as soon as they come to Christ just stop this stop just stop that let God take it from you because when God take it from you you won't go back to it Hallelujah when God takes it from you you won't go back to it Hallelujah so you just be obedient to the first step amen and just surrendering yourself out to him and um as he was talking his personal testimony of just being in a car and and um having a a moment where he just told God I just need you to take control of my life uh it took me back in my own mind as to uh just you know when I when I gave my heart to the Lord this one in church I was parking lot somewhere if some grocery store working that night and um I remember a elderly lady that must have been in the 80s that come to me and say son you ain't gotta wait till you get to church to give your heart to Jesus you can do it right here in this parking lot and she said you ready I say no ma'am I'm not ready but she planted a seed and that night I could not get away from what that lady said to me and uh and because that seed that she planted I went back out there act like I had to get some carts and one little carts in that parking lot but I act like I had to get a few of them I was going out to talk to my God I'll never forget the spot I'll never forget the place I'll never forget the moment but it was a moment where I came under complete surrender to the Lord now did I have trials after that I sure did and I still got them today but I'm still determined to serve God in the midst of all my trials everybody gonna go through something whether you saved or not saved you're still gonna go through something I'd just rather go through with God than going through without them Blessed Be His holy name glory to God [Music] I said I believe I believe

parts of his life Lord to just try to be a help to other young people prevent them from going down certain paths we appreciate our brother just being so open with us tonight and father I pray that it
