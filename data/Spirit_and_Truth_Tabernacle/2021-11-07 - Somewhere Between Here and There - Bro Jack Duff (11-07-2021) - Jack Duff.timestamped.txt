[1:01:26] brother troy speaking on last week
[1:01:29] amen what is truth

[1:02:07] here today and i kind of go a little
[1:02:09] different it'd be more along the lines
[1:02:11] of faith but i think we can never have
[1:02:13] enough of that uh with the things that
[1:02:16] we face on a day-to-day basis
[1:02:18] our faith got to be ignited
[1:02:20] got to be charged all the time
[1:02:23] amen it's like when your cell phone
[1:02:25] dying you got to put it on a charge
[1:02:27] sometimes you come to the house of god
[1:02:29] to get a charge
[1:02:30] right amen we need that as we're as
[1:02:32] we're facing different things and uh
[1:02:34] they they uh i heard them pray for
[1:02:36] brother travis and i'm i'm grateful for

[1:02:48] uh
[1:02:49] uh
[1:02:51] proverbs yeah uh proverbs he was going
[1:02:53] through proverbs and then i told him
[1:02:55] about first samuel ii samuel he started
[1:02:57] going through that and as we got to talk
[1:02:59] and he started making connections from
[1:03:01] samuel to david and psalms i said yes
[1:03:03] that's exactly right
[1:03:05] that's the way it's supposed to be right
[1:03:07] there you know some of the things that
[1:03:09] david was going through in the book of
[1:03:10] samuel wrote the songs right so uh so
[1:03:14] you know we were just really
[1:03:14] fellowshipping around that and i was i
[1:03:16] was just just really blessed and i told
[1:03:18] them now god is represented in numbers
[1:03:22] i said some sometimes you got to find
[1:03:24] the numbers where god is i say what what
[1:03:26] day you go to court you say the eighth
[1:03:33] and i said he told me he's been
[1:03:35] a hell seven months
[1:03:38] seven eight
[1:03:40] eleven
[1:03:41] you know there's numbers here that that
[1:03:43] god can work with so i say i just trust
[1:03:46] the lord to give you favor amen on that
[1:03:48] so uh sometimes you got to give people
[1:03:51] hope you got to give them faith
[1:03:53] something to hold on to amen

[1:04:08] is where i want to start from
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:14] um
[1:04:15] actually you know what let's let's go
[1:04:17] back to verse 20. let's start at verse
[1:04:18] 20.
[1:04:20] and it says
[1:04:22] and in the morning
[1:04:25] as they passed by
[1:04:28] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[1:04:30] roots
[1:04:32] and peter called into remembrance saith
[1:04:34] unto him master
[1:04:37] behold the fig tree which thy curse is
[1:04:39] withered away
[1:04:43] now you got to understand when jesus
[1:04:44] spoke this to the fig tree he was not
[1:04:47] speaking out loud
[1:04:49] it was a very uh just
[1:04:52] you know curse curse no many uh fruit
[1:04:54] from the from here here i mean from here
[1:04:57] after just very soft words nothing
[1:04:59] nothing major but the bible say that the
[1:05:01] disciples heard it
[1:05:04] right so so it wasn't that he was trying
[1:05:05] to say it to get their attention he just
[1:05:07] said it but the disciples heard it so
[1:05:08] now this next day one day later uh peter
[1:05:12] noticed that the fig tree that he cursed
[1:05:15] is dried up it's withered away what i'm
[1:05:17] trying to tell you is that the situation
[1:05:19] changed
[1:05:21] in less than 24 hours
[1:05:25] all right it changed just like that
[1:05:27] and peter noticed it
[1:05:29] amen amen i'm praying that some of our
[1:05:32] situations will change in less than 24
[1:05:35] hours
[1:05:36] hallelujah
[1:05:38] and verse 22 says in jesus answering
[1:05:40] death unto him have faith in god
[1:05:43] that whosoever shall sin to this
[1:05:45] mountain
[1:05:46] be thou removed and be thou cast him to
[1:05:49] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:05:52] but shall believe that those things
[1:05:55] which he saith
[1:05:57] shall come to pass
[1:05:59] he
[1:06:00] shall
[1:06:01] have
[1:06:02] whatsoever
[1:06:04] he saith
[1:06:06] now now now the key to this is that you
[1:06:09] have to be the one to speak it
[1:06:13] because you're going to have whatever
[1:06:14] you say if you speak negative you
[1:06:17] receive negative you speak positive you
[1:06:19] receive positive it's based on what you
[1:06:22] say
[1:06:25] so therefore i say unto you what what
[1:06:28] things server you desire
[1:06:29] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:06:31] them and ye shall have them
[1:06:34] and when you stand pray and forgive
[1:06:37] if you have ought against any that your
[1:06:40] father also which is in heaven may
[1:06:42] forgive you your trespasses
[1:06:44] hallelujah that's why some of us have
[1:06:47] not received our blessing yet
[1:06:49] we're still holding out against somebody
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] says but if you do if you do not forgive
[1:06:56] neither will your father which is in
[1:06:58] heaven forgive your trespasses the lord
[1:07:00] had a blessing to the reading of his
[1:07:01] word let's pray father we thank you
[1:07:03] for
[1:07:04] the ability to read scripture

[1:08:06] and there
[1:08:08] amen uh uh just follow me here this
[1:08:12] morning i was
[1:08:13] uh i guess reading uh a little little
[1:08:17] quote or something like that that
[1:08:18] somebody put on um in one of the the
[1:08:21] whatsapp groups that i was in and as i
[1:08:23] was reading and i was just
[1:08:24] so inspired so encouraged by you know
[1:08:27] some of the words that that was spoken
[1:08:29] and i pray today amen that we'll just be
[1:08:31] able to kind of bring some of the
[1:08:32] inspiration encouragement to you as well
[1:08:34] amen uh coming out of the the sermon
[1:08:37] perfect faith is where i want to start
[1:08:39] a man this first quote coming out of
[1:08:41] perfect faith and and when i when i was
[1:08:43] looking at some of these quotes out of
[1:08:45] perfect faith that was shared i said
[1:08:46] well what scripture did brother branham
[1:08:48] use when he preached perfect faith i
[1:08:50] said what what i had to go back and find
[1:08:53] and and there he was reading out of mark
[1:08:55] 11 amen uh 22 through 26 that was his
[1:08:59] that was what he was reading and uh i
[1:09:01] say well my you know for him to take a a
[1:09:04] a message like perfect faith and tie it
[1:09:06] down in that scripture say there's got
[1:09:08] to be something there for us
[1:09:10] and uh so i just want to just maybe
[1:09:12] coast a little bit and just hope this
[1:09:14] will be a blessing but coming out of
[1:09:15] this sermon perfect faith this first
[1:09:17] quote says notice now
[1:09:20] another
[1:09:21] perfect faith
[1:09:23] is a master
[1:09:25] of all circumstances i i need to ask you
[1:09:29] a question do you have a circumstance
[1:09:31] this morning do you have something that
[1:09:33] you're facing this morning where you
[1:09:35] need to know your faith and perfect
[1:09:38] faith masters that circumstance right
[1:09:41] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:09:43] circumstance
[1:09:45] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:09:48] no matter what it is
[1:09:51] amen it masters it now just watch when
[1:09:56] you believe anything do anything and you
[1:09:59] got faith in what you're doing no matter
[1:10:02] what the circumstance is that don't have
[1:10:06] one thing to do

[1:10:12] have a chance when we get a revelation
[1:10:15] amen that our faith can master whatever
[1:10:17] whatever we're facing and man it says uh
[1:10:20] don't have one thing to do with it see
[1:10:21] it masters that circumstance it is um it
[1:10:25] says if it's in a room of sickness the
[1:10:28] lord revealed that there's certain
[1:10:30] things going to happen you just speak it
[1:10:33] and go
[1:10:34] now now that that's that's that's a good
[1:10:37] lesson to learn sometimes when you speak
[1:10:39] it it don't change immediately
[1:10:43] and since it doesn't change immediately
[1:10:45] our faith begins to dwindle
[1:10:47] hallelujah but here the prophet tells us
[1:10:49] speak it and then go on you know when
[1:10:52] god said let there be light in the
[1:10:54] beginning brother branham said it could
[1:10:56] have took millions of years before a
[1:10:58] light came but when god spoke it he went
[1:11:01] on and start working on the next thing
[1:11:03] hallelujah amen and here's what i want

[1:16:35] new and old testament and sees every
[1:16:37] promise that he made and faith sees it
[1:16:40] out yonder and faith chooses that
[1:16:43] regardless of what the present tense
[1:16:45] says here he looks at the end he don't
[1:16:49] drop his sights down to look this away

[1:17:12] this uh next quote that i want to use
[1:17:14] out of be not afraid is a testimony
[1:17:17] and this is kind of where i got my my my
[1:17:19] thought from
[1:17:21] as uh this was being shared
[1:17:24] and uh you know let me just just just
[1:17:26] read it here brother branham was talking
[1:17:28] about he was
[1:17:29] when i was leaving south africa recently
[1:17:31] there was about 10 000 at the airport
[1:17:33] and they was out there standing out
[1:17:34] there weeping and crying wailing
[1:17:36] screaming come back and tell us
[1:17:38] again about jesus

[1:17:41] little doctor that had seen a miracle
[1:17:43] perform a little cross-out boy started
[1:17:45] on the platform just to cross side as he
[1:17:48] could be and before he got to me his
[1:17:49] eyes come straight
[1:17:51] now now um there was a you know the the
[1:17:54] testimony about brother branham's uh
[1:17:56] daughter's first daughter that passed
[1:17:58] away she died cross-eyed
[1:18:01] she died cross-eyed and uh and when
[1:18:03] brother branham saw his daughter in that
[1:18:04] condition it just really did something
[1:18:07] to him that you know anytime he saw a
[1:18:09] child or any any person with cross eyes
[1:18:12] uh
[1:18:13] sometimes he didn't even have to pray
[1:18:15] sometimes all he had to do is just look
[1:18:17] at him and the eyes would come straight
[1:18:19] he had a compassion for people that had
[1:18:21] these cross eyes
[1:18:23] hallelujah amen now here this boy amen
[1:18:26] there in africa uh with the cross eyes
[1:18:28] and he says uh before he even got to me
[1:18:31] his eyes come straight
[1:18:33] says go on just just took him on off the
[1:18:35] platform and a british doctor come back
[1:18:38] set him back there and he comes saying
[1:18:40] what did you do to this boy
[1:18:43] what did you do to that boy did you
[1:18:44] hypnotize him says i said hypnotize them
[1:18:48] i said and they give you a license to
[1:18:50] practice medicine you know more you know
[1:18:52] you know more about hypnotism than that
[1:18:54] and he said i put the boy on the
[1:18:56] platform he was cross-eyed and here he
[1:18:59] is his eyes are straight and said
[1:19:01] something happened
[1:19:02] between there and he there and there
[1:19:06] something happened hallelujah amen amen
[1:19:10] i want you to get this if something
[1:19:12] happened for that boy
[1:19:14] between here and there
[1:19:16] something's about to happen for you
[1:19:19] between here and there
[1:19:21] [Applause]
[1:19:23] oh glory to god he says that something
[1:19:26] happened between there and there i said
[1:19:28] he met jesus
[1:19:30] see i said he i and i said i never
[1:19:32] touched him and he said did you
[1:19:34] hypnotize him i said certainly not sir i
[1:19:37] said if hypnotism will straighten
[1:19:40] cricket eyes haven't you fellas better
[1:19:42] get to practicing hypnotism
[1:19:44] you see i in a better it'd be better uh
[1:19:47] than any operation you could do if
[1:19:49] hypnotism will do it
[1:19:51] i said no i did not hypnotize the boy
[1:19:54] god straighten his eyes
[1:19:57] he says i know there's a god he said i
[1:20:00] know that's what god said there that
[1:20:02] lily there's literally uh lily's their
[1:20:04] sisters uh if you might know some of
[1:20:06] them with them big cala lilies are 18
[1:20:08] inches across big yellow and white ones
[1:20:10] and most beautiful thing growing wild
[1:20:12] right in the jungle they had big
[1:20:14] bouquets of them setting all over the
[1:20:16] platform said i know there's god's life
[1:20:19] in them lilies because the lily couldn't
[1:20:21] live without life he said but tangible
[1:20:24] enough to perform an operation on those
[1:20:26] eyes
[1:20:27] i said who made the eyes in the first
[1:20:30] place
[1:20:31] where
[1:20:32] did they come from and he said well yeah
[1:20:35] and just then dr bosworth come and said
[1:20:37] you have to leave us sir you you call's
[1:20:39] a riot see he said his time is valuable
[1:20:42] now while the nautilus on our brother
[1:20:44] usually coming to the meets to make it
[1:20:45] better effective mr back to mr baldwin
[1:20:48] them the managers they do the speaking i
[1:20:49] just come right straight to the platform
[1:20:51] call the prayer line and then after it's
[1:20:53] over leave but now of course i'm just
[1:20:55] alone there with just the boys and so i
[1:20:57] have to try to stumble around over uh
[1:21:00] speaking myself so when the doctor he
[1:21:03] started to take him away and he said he
[1:21:05] said just a moment it said mr branham do
[1:21:08] you mean to tell me that god the great
[1:21:10] creator is somewhere between here
[1:21:15] and there
[1:21:19] oh you could be this close to death
[1:21:22] but somewhere between here
[1:21:25] and there
[1:21:26] god will step in
[1:21:30] i said almighty god will step in
[1:21:34] i don't care how close you are to being
[1:21:36] defeated god will not allow you to be
[1:21:39] defeated
[1:21:43] they could have threatened all kind of
[1:21:44] things i'm going to take this and i'm
[1:21:46] going to take that don't matter what
[1:21:47] they say
[1:21:48] god is in between here and there and he
[1:21:50] can step in and change everything around
[1:21:52] just like that
[1:21:54] look at this this man asks a question
[1:21:55] the doctor says you mean to tell me
[1:21:57] that god the great creator is somewhere
[1:22:00] between here and there
[1:22:02] brother brandon said he's everywhere
[1:22:04] and he said well there's got to be some
[1:22:07] tangible force to straighten that boy's
[1:22:10] eyes i said that it was god and they
[1:22:13] started to take him off then mr baxter
[1:22:16] walked up to him he said just a minute
[1:22:18] he got up to the micro and said i i too
[1:22:20] will receive jesus christ as my personal
[1:22:22] savior
[1:22:25] once he saw god manifest himself between
[1:22:28] here and there it changed his heart
[1:22:30] and he stopped he stopped approaching
[1:22:32] god with the intellectual conception
[1:22:35] amen some reality struck when this man
[1:22:38] experienced god
[1:22:40] in that place of hearing there
[1:22:43] i want to just kind of uh uh give you a
[1:22:45] couple of scriptures here this is not
[1:22:47] just something that was just you know uh
[1:22:49] in brother branham's ministry but i got
[1:22:52] i kind of you know as i looked at the
[1:22:54] quote i said man we're going to be able
[1:22:55] to find this all over the scripture you
[1:22:57] know and and there's things that happen
[1:23:00] god begin to step in
[1:23:02] you can be in a situation over here but
[1:23:04] you know you're on your way there
[1:23:06] and before you get there
[1:23:09] before you get to the place called there
[1:23:11] you need to see the supernatural
[1:23:14] you need to experience god in a way that
[1:23:16] you never experienced and i am here to
[1:23:18] tell you if you just take a step of
[1:23:20] faith
[1:23:21] you will find god right in between the
[1:23:24] spot of here
[1:23:26] and there
[1:23:28] here we find it in in the book of uh
[1:23:31] luke
[1:23:33] amen uh chapter 17.
[1:23:35] let's look at this amen verse 11 luke
[1:23:38] luke 17
[1:23:39] and verse 11
[1:23:41] hey we gonna find them between here and
[1:23:43] there
[1:23:44] glory glory glory glory amen
[1:23:48] my here uh we find this
[1:23:50] in the bible
[1:23:53] luke 17. i got the wrong verse okay
[1:23:56] all right luke 17 verse 11
[1:23:59] says and it came to pass as he went to
[1:24:02] jerusalem
[1:24:04] that he passed through the midst of
[1:24:05] samaria and galilee
[1:24:07] and as he entered into a certain village
[1:24:10] there met him ten men
[1:24:13] that were lepers
[1:24:15] amen which stood afar off
[1:24:17] hallelujah glory to god it says uh and
[1:24:21] they lifted up their voices
[1:24:23] and said jesus master have mercy on us
[1:24:28] and when he saw them and i noticed that
[1:24:30] they standing way back because you know
[1:24:32] as leopards they were kicked outside the
[1:24:34] city they couldn't come in contact with
[1:24:36] anybody but it just so happened jesus
[1:24:38] was passing their way and they
[1:24:40] recognized who was coming the the very
[1:24:43] man that could change their situation
[1:24:46] was coming down amen right down their
[1:24:48] street
[1:24:49] amen and there he was standing there
[1:24:51] saying oh jesus have mercy master have
[1:24:53] mercy on us
[1:24:55] and when he saw them he said unto them
[1:24:57] go show yourselves uh unto the priests
[1:25:00] and it came to pass that as they went i
[1:25:03] like that
[1:25:06] oh glory as they went
[1:25:09] they were cleansed
[1:25:11] amen so here they were standing here
[1:25:13] with leprosy but as they were on the way
[1:25:16] to there
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:19] there was to go show yourself to the
[1:25:21] priests
[1:25:23] and all they had to do was be obedient
[1:25:25] here
[1:25:27] and as they begin to walk to there
[1:25:31] to get to the priests
[1:25:33] the bible says that all of them
[1:25:35] recognize
[1:25:37] that they have been healed by the word
[1:25:39] of god because they were obedient
[1:25:42] amen and i want to encourage you
[1:25:46] in between here
[1:25:48] and there be obedient to god
[1:25:52] and watch what god does
[1:25:55] watch the supernatural happen

[1:26:04] there
[1:26:09] hallelujah

[1:27:24] saw when he saw them he said unto them
[1:27:26] go show yourselves unto the priests
[1:27:29] and it came to pass that as they went
[1:27:32] they were cleansed
[1:27:33] and one of them when he saw that he was
[1:27:35] healed
[1:27:36] turned back
[1:27:40] man this man didn't come to church
[1:27:45] this man then come to church
[1:27:48] amen with nothing to say
[1:27:52] notice what the bible say when he came
[1:27:54] to church
[1:27:56] the bible says with a loud voice
[1:28:00] hey when god has done something for you
[1:28:03] that's the least you can give him is
[1:28:04] your loud voice
[1:28:11] glory to god
[1:28:17] you know it's a loud voice that gets his
[1:28:19] attention
[1:28:21] because amen as he was on his way to the
[1:28:24] cross
[1:28:25] amen blind bartimaeus did not realize
[1:28:29] this would be the last trip
[1:28:31] and he could not see with his eyes
[1:28:34] glory to god but he heard that jesus
[1:28:38] was passing by
[1:28:40] and he began to screen out
[1:28:42] jesus
[1:28:44] have mercy on me
[1:28:46] and somebody say he can't hear you
[1:28:48] bartimaeus you might as well be quiet he
[1:28:52] can't hear you he's not gonna stop
[1:28:55] he can't see and you can't see him
[1:28:57] but jesus
[1:28:59] thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:29:04] and the more they discourage bartimaeus
[1:29:07] the louder he got
[1:29:09] to finally say jesus
[1:29:12] jesus
[1:29:14] jesus
[1:29:15] had mercy on me
[1:29:19] and that loud voice called jesus
[1:29:23] caused attention
[1:29:23] to stop in his tracks
[1:29:25] one more miracle

[1:32:21] a loud voice glorified god
[1:32:24] and fell down on his face at his feet
[1:32:28] giving him thanks
[1:32:30] and he was a samaritan
[1:32:34] and jesus answering said where were
[1:32:36] there not 10 cleanse
[1:32:39] now now here it is they all got a
[1:32:41] miracle
[1:32:42] and jesus knew that every one of them
[1:32:44] was going to get the miracle
[1:32:46] he said just go show yourself to the
[1:32:47] priest never lay hands on them
[1:32:50] never never never even spoke a word just
[1:32:52] go show yourself to the priests and as
[1:32:54] they obeyed here and was going there
[1:32:57] they
[1:32:58] every last one of them experienced a
[1:33:00] miracle
[1:33:01] but only one could return
[1:33:03] and offer thanks
[1:33:06] look at this look at this look at this
[1:33:08] jesus said were there not ten cleanse
[1:33:11] but where are the nine
[1:33:14] they are not found that return to give
[1:33:16] glory to god
[1:33:17] save this stranger
[1:33:20] and it says and he said unto him arise
[1:33:23] go thy way
[1:33:24] thy faith
[1:33:26] have made thee whole
[1:33:28] oh hallelujah hallelujah stranger heard
[1:33:31] the commandment of the lord jesus was
[1:33:34] obedient to it and received his miracle
[1:33:38] we've got to learn to be obedient what
[1:33:40] god tell us
[1:33:41] amen that's how we see miracles this was
[1:33:44] not the only time this happened like i
[1:33:46] said we're going to walk through the
[1:33:47] scripture
[1:33:48] i re reminded
[1:33:50] a man of the story of
[1:33:53] these people gathering at the pool of
[1:33:54] bethesda
[1:33:57] and the bible the bible would tell us
[1:33:59] amen that when they would come to this
[1:34:01] pool they sat there because the
[1:34:02] scriptures say at a certain
[1:34:05] season
[1:34:07] and so that's the thing you you know
[1:34:09] when i come in here this morning and uh
[1:34:11] just first to start starting with the
[1:34:13] prayer and i just kind of feel the
[1:34:14] anointing in here just just the way
[1:34:16] things was going i mean god is moving in
[1:34:18] this place
[1:34:19] you know and then uh then you know at
[1:34:21] the uh uh uh as was just going through
[1:34:23] the song service and amen and just
[1:34:25] listening at the different songs out of
[1:34:27] saints was entering i say oh we gonna
[1:34:29] have church in here today
[1:34:31] and we're gonna have church today i know
[1:34:33] god is here
[1:34:35] right you know and so sometimes when you
[1:34:38] when you feel services like that that's
[1:34:40] the angel of the lord that's troubling
[1:34:42] the water
[1:34:45] amen and so so here the story in the
[1:34:47] scripture tells us that you know at a
[1:34:49] certain season the angel would come down
[1:34:51] and begin to stir up the water and and
[1:34:54] and and the way it went is that the
[1:34:55] first person
[1:34:56] that jumped into the water while the
[1:34:59] angel was there that's the person that
[1:35:01] received their healing now no matter
[1:35:04] what their condition was no matter what
[1:35:07] their circumstance was all they needed
[1:35:09] to do was just get in the water
[1:35:13] that's all they had to do just get in
[1:35:14] and the first person got it
[1:35:17] walked away here did not have to lay in
[1:35:19] the water anymore well this one day
[1:35:21] jesus comes
[1:35:23] and it begins to have a conversation
[1:35:25] with this man amen that's laying on a
[1:35:27] cot
[1:35:28] and he walked by all the other uh sick
[1:35:31] people and you think you think that he'd
[1:35:32] be a compassionate god that he'd go to
[1:35:35] all them no he only go to those that are
[1:35:36] predestinated for him to go to
[1:35:39] amen hallelujah so so so here we are uh
[1:35:42] he walks down to this man and says uh
[1:35:44] will that be made whole
[1:35:46] and he's asking me a question
[1:35:48] now uh i was just kind of uh uh thinking
[1:35:51] about this this man never stepped into
[1:35:53] the water
[1:35:54] this man amen never
[1:35:56] all he did was just begin to give jesus
[1:35:58] some some uh some some excuses as to why
[1:36:01] he couldn't be made whole god don't want
[1:36:04] to hear your excuses
[1:36:07] i got one question sir will thou be made
[1:36:11] whole
[1:36:11] now see his favors that when this water
[1:36:13] stirred then if i can get in the water
[1:36:15] i'll be made whole no he don't realize
[1:36:17] that the angel
[1:36:19] that came to trouble the water was
[1:36:22] standing in a person
[1:36:25] in the person of the lord jesus and he
[1:36:27] actually say will you be made whole
[1:36:30] and as he's asking the question he said
[1:36:32] no no no i don't even want to hear it
[1:36:34] i'm not going to sit here and debate
[1:36:35] with you about all your excuses he said
[1:36:37] take up your your match
[1:36:40] pick up your mat and just go on
[1:36:42] and as he told the man the man man got
[1:36:45] some strength in his balls picked up his
[1:36:46] mouth and he went out never stepped in
[1:36:49] the
[1:36:50] water to the gods but somewhere between
[1:36:54] where he was standing
[1:36:56] and where the troubled water was
[1:36:59] somewhere between here
[1:37:01] and there
[1:37:03] jesus was standing
[1:37:05] the supernatural was standing
[1:37:07] and all he had to do was be obedient
[1:37:10] to the supernatural and he'll receive
[1:37:13] his healing
[1:37:17] i'm telling you god can get right in
[1:37:19] between the little itty bitty space
[1:37:22] actually he'll make space for himself
[1:37:25] he'll get right in between a little itty
[1:37:28] bitty space to make a difference in your
[1:37:31] life
[1:37:34] that man received this healing somewhere
[1:37:36] between here
[1:37:38] and there
[1:37:40] oh hallelujah hallelujah can i just read
[1:37:43] another one here
[1:37:44] let's go to luke 7.
[1:37:52] oh thank you jesus
[1:37:56] now uh
[1:37:59] start at verse 11.
[1:38:02] jesus has a way of just getting in
[1:38:03] between here and there
[1:38:08] this was a very very
[1:38:10] bad situation that we're getting ready
[1:38:12] to read

[1:38:16] husband

[1:44:50] and the centurion he knew he had
[1:44:52] confidence in jesus
[1:44:54] he was not one of the jews so he
[1:44:56] couldn't he didn't feel like he had the
[1:44:58] right to approach jesus the way the jews
[1:45:00] could so he says if y'all don't mind he
[1:45:02] has some jewish servants said y'all
[1:45:03] don't mind i got a servant that i really
[1:45:06] love oh hallelujah says i really love
[1:45:09] him and i want to see him get well
[1:45:11] amen i don't want to see him die in the
[1:45:13] condition that he's dying in he says but
[1:45:16] i want to just see him get well and he
[1:45:18] says if you don't mind would you go to
[1:45:20] jesus on my behalf and would you ask him
[1:45:23] to come here to the house and pray for
[1:45:25] this this this uh this uh that this

[1:45:50] house

[1:50:46] effect
[1:50:47] to the to the others that were around
[1:50:49] say this the kind of faith i'm looking
[1:50:50] for
[1:50:52] this is what i'm talking about
[1:50:55] he said he said he says
[1:50:57] jesus heard these things and marveled at
[1:50:58] him and turned him about and said unto
[1:51:00] the people that follow him i say unto
[1:51:03] you
[1:51:04] i have not found so great faith no
[1:51:08] not in israel
[1:51:11] and they that were sent
[1:51:13] returned into the house
[1:51:14] found the servant whole
[1:51:16] that had been sick
[1:51:19] so somewhere between here
[1:51:22] where jesus was standing and where that
[1:51:24] sick man was laying
[1:51:25] somewhere between here and there the
[1:51:27] supernatural took place
[1:51:34] glory
[1:51:35] let me uh look at something here in the
[1:51:36] message perfect faithless
[1:51:38] paragraph 218 i want to go to there
[1:51:41] oh my see this this man
[1:51:44] uh did not
[1:51:46] he just didn't feel comfortable having
[1:51:48] jesus come into his house
[1:51:50] but the man was his servant was too sick
[1:51:52] to go get prayer for himself so he had
[1:51:53] to send somebody
[1:51:56] on his behalf to just just have jesus
[1:51:58] saying a word for my servant and that's
[1:52:00] all you need sometimes sometimes you
[1:52:02] know a prayer line come stand in the gap
[1:52:03] for somebody else all you need is just a
[1:52:05] word to go
[1:52:07] just a word
[1:52:09] hey glory
[1:52:11] here the message says the great
[1:52:13] physician
[1:52:14] who is here who said these signs shall
[1:52:17] follow them that believe if they lay
[1:52:19] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:52:21] recover and if you say to this mountain
[1:52:23] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:52:24] but can believe
[1:52:26] if he can create squirrels who has no
[1:52:29] way and and and don't doubt and uh and
[1:52:32] who has no way at all or nothing there
[1:52:34] to believe it's my own faith that goes

[1:55:43] whatsoever
[1:55:47] whatever we say let's keep reading let's
[1:55:49] keep reading
[1:55:50] if he can create squirrels was who has
[1:55:53] no way at all or nothing there to
[1:55:55] believe it's my own faith that that that
[1:55:58] goes and does that
[1:56:00] my faith in what he challenged me to ask
[1:56:02] he challenged me to ask it and i i
[1:56:04] received his challenge in obedience to
[1:56:06] his word i asked it
[1:56:08] and it appeared
[1:56:10] god in heaven knows that that's true
[1:56:12] can he also heal the sick
[1:56:15] if he can lift me with the faith up this
[1:56:17] way even for the people listen listen to
[1:56:20] this statement
[1:56:21] even if they can't climb to that bracket
[1:56:25] if they can't do it
[1:56:28] if they can't get there
[1:56:30] all this preaching they just can't get
[1:56:32] there look at what they say he can use
[1:56:34] my faith
[1:56:39] he can use my faith
[1:56:41] he can lift me to that place
[1:56:44] and i'm climbing for you
[1:56:46] now you know god gives somebody the gift
[1:56:48] of faith
[1:56:49] some people have the gift of faith and
[1:56:51] god will use their faith to get you what
[1:56:54] you need because your faith won't get
[1:56:56] there
[1:56:57] but god will anoint the next person with
[1:56:59] their faith
[1:57:02] let me keep reading i'm gonna give you
[1:57:03] an example of it

[1:57:17] my faith he can lift me to that place
[1:57:19] and i'm climbing for you i'm believing
[1:57:22] for you i'm speaking for you
[1:57:26] remember he said in another quote he
[1:57:28] says brother need rain
[1:57:30] he said say with the adopted sons and
[1:57:32] daughters of god will have the power to
[1:57:34] say brother i give you
[1:57:36] rain
[1:57:38] see that that's your perfect faith see
[1:57:41] stop putting people down
[1:57:44] you just ain't got no faith you just use
[1:57:47] your faith
[1:57:48] if they ain't got no faith you show
[1:57:50] faith for them since you got all the
[1:57:53] faith
[1:57:58] see but you you want to put you you god

[1:58:24] facing as we come to church
[1:58:26] and god got a word just one word can

[1:58:43] and if you ain't got faith to believe it
[1:58:46] since god gave me the sermon

[1:58:51] meet you somewhere between here
[1:58:54] and there
[1:58:59] whatever your there
[1:59:00] is god gonna meet you

[2:00:49] wouldn't that be perfect of god
[2:00:53] that that you go home and find it the
[2:00:55] way you have believed it
[2:00:57] like brother trump said that's somewhere
[2:00:59] between here while you're hearing the
[2:01:00] word of god
[2:01:02] and then before you get home god now
[2:01:04] work something out
[2:01:09] so the man was obedient he got up and
[2:01:11] left jesus and started on his way home
[2:01:12] and as he was on the way home and
[2:01:14] one of the servants came and said oh you
[2:01:16] you got to worry about troubling jesus
[2:01:17] say yes your son be made whole say oh
[2:01:19] praise god he said no i just need to

[2:01:29] he said about the seven thousand that's
[2:01:31] exactly the time
[2:01:33] that jesus spoken
[2:01:35] somewhere between here
[2:01:37] and there
[2:01:39] it was that man standing in faith for
[2:01:41] his son
[2:01:43] and his son was made whole
[2:01:45] or you want to see your children made
[2:01:47] whole you stand in faith for them
[2:01:51] oh glory to god glory to god glory to
[2:01:53] god
[2:01:54] amen all right
[2:01:56] uh i want to just uh
[2:02:00] bring let me read out of this message
[2:02:02] jairus
[2:02:05] and i want to just maybe bring a couple
[2:02:06] more things and i'm going to try to find
[2:02:08] a closing spot here uh here out of the
[2:02:11] message gyrus
[2:02:13] brother ramsay the roman centurion that
[2:02:15] had
[2:02:16] a friend that was sick a servant he said
[2:02:19] i'm not even worthy that you come
[2:02:21] under my roof
[2:02:22] just speak the word if i'm a man under
[2:02:24] authority and i say to this man do this
[2:02:26] and he doeth it do this man do that and
[2:02:28] he doeth it see the roman recognized
[2:02:30] that jesus his word had all the power
[2:02:34] that was needed for the healing of that
[2:02:35] person
[2:02:36] he knew that in him was invested the
[2:02:39] power of jehovah god
[2:02:41] and he knew that whatever jesus said
[2:02:44] that he mastered diseases
[2:02:46] he mastered the sea
[2:02:48] he mastered the universe
[2:02:51] that's what he is tonight the same
[2:02:53] yesterday today and forever if we could
[2:02:55] only recognize that his word has
[2:02:57] supremacy
[2:02:58] over every demon
[2:03:01] every power
[2:03:02] every all everything every sin every
[2:03:05] sickness every disease every
[2:03:07] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:03:09] and forever believe what he said
[2:03:12] so they said i'm a man under thorne and
[2:03:14] i know that anybody's under me has to
[2:03:16] obey me my word is law and order
[2:03:21] he has to do it
[2:03:22] and he knew that jesus christ had
[2:03:24] sickness on his feet he had every
[2:03:26] disease on his feet and how much more
[2:03:29] after he died for that purpose and
[2:03:31] purchased it for you and i are we to
[2:03:33] believe his word amen there you are
[2:03:36] what jesus says is right
[2:03:39] you can triumph over every devil
[2:03:42] every sickness
[2:03:44] every disease
[2:03:46] if you'll just claim your god given
[2:03:48] authority
[2:03:50] that jesus christ said whatsoever
[2:03:53] you ask in my name that i'll do amen
[2:03:56] that's what we need tonight is a group
[2:03:58] of people to rise
[2:04:00] this people who call themselves
[2:04:01] pentecostal can unite their hearts
[2:04:03] together and one big effort and say
[2:04:05] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:04:07] and forever his power supreme and what
[2:04:09] he said in his word
[2:04:11] he'll back it up
[2:04:13] amen
[2:04:14] then you'll see a church rise in the
[2:04:17] power of the glory of god
[2:04:20] and move on
[2:04:22] amen
[2:04:24] i was thinking you know we we we can
[2:04:27] look at many of these examples in
[2:04:30] the scripture
[2:04:31] and go and even in the message
[2:04:34] uh i think of the gentleman john ryan
[2:04:37] that was just claiming his healing he
[2:04:40] got prayed from the prayer line and
[2:04:41] blind got prayed for and he says you
[2:04:43] know uh
[2:04:44] uh brother random told you know you're
[2:04:46] gonna be healed brother and he left that
[2:04:48] uh prayer lines i thank god for my
[2:04:50] healing came back the next night it says
[2:04:52] uh i thought you said i was healed but
[2:04:54] i'm still blind he said i thought you
[2:04:55] said you believe
[2:04:57] he said he said this is what you need to
[2:04:59] do
[2:05:00] he says just keep confessing your
[2:05:02] healing if you believe you're he'll just
[2:05:04] keep confessing he says just go and say
[2:05:06] thank god i'm healed thank god i'm

[2:05:15] about it thank god i'm here he just kept
[2:05:17] confessing it kept confessing so weeks
[2:05:18] go by found himself at the barber shop
[2:05:21] in the barber chair and barbers start
[2:05:22] talking some doubt you got to watch
[2:05:24] people that talk down and i'm going to
[2:05:26] tell you another thing that's how you
[2:05:28] know god is getting ready to move when

[2:05:42] you respond to the word when god gives
[2:05:43] you a word you respond back to god
[2:05:47] so so so he said he said he said he said
[2:05:49] the the barber said you need to stop you
[2:05:52] bringing reproach on the cause of christ
[2:05:54] by saying that you healed and telling
[2:05:56] everybody here you blind as i don't know
[2:05:58] what he said man i don't care what you

[2:06:19] him
[2:06:21] that man jumped up took off running out
[2:06:23] the barber chair and the barber running

[2:07:09] through some of the testimonies in

[2:07:14] personal testimony
[2:07:17] one time we went to a meeting
[2:07:20] in indiana
[2:07:22] since italian was here waiting on
[2:07:24] surgery and she told the doctors now

[2:08:36] time for that surgery
[2:08:37] god had removed it before the doctors
[2:08:39] could
[2:08:41] hallelujah so we saw god after prayer

[2:08:52] hallelujah and that same god is living
[2:08:55] today i don't care what you faint saying

[2:09:10] to read and i
[2:09:12] contemplated i said well

[2:09:23] brother branham receiving
[2:09:26] that silver tip grizzly
[2:09:28] somewhere between here
[2:09:33] and there
[2:09:34] let's play it
[2:09:42] right already i'm gonna follow you here
[2:09:44] he comes
[2:09:45] and these boys said we'll stay here now
[2:09:47] until we see you get the caribou and i
[2:09:49] said then we'll we'll blow him down take
[2:09:51] the horses and go on in
[2:09:53] we'll meet you down at the end of the
[2:09:54] draw about about four or five miles down
[2:09:57] he said all right so we started around
[2:09:59] bud night in about a half hour we worked
[2:10:02] right around and that caribou land right
[2:10:04] there looking right at us
[2:10:06] never seen us he must have been asleep
[2:10:08] and went up over a little cut and come
[2:10:09] back and come up within 30 yards of him
[2:10:12] there he laid this mammoth big animal
[2:10:14] rose up from there and i got him while
[2:10:17] we're sitting there taking the cape and
[2:10:19] so forth from it like that bud said did
[2:10:21] you say these horns was 42 inches i said
[2:10:23] that's exactly right he said brother
[2:10:25] brown they must be 142. great big head
[2:10:28] and i said no it's just exactly 42 said
[2:10:30] i got a tape measure down there i said
[2:10:32] you doubt it he said no sir
[2:10:34] he said but wait a minute didn't you
[2:10:36] tell me
[2:10:37] that you were going to get
[2:10:39] a big grizzly bear before you got back
[2:10:43] down it'd be a silver tip before you got
[2:10:44] back where that boy was a green shirt on
[2:10:46] i said that's the truth
[2:10:48] you look back down the hill well there
[2:10:50] is a thing that high
[2:10:51] nothing always boss all you see miles
[2:10:54] and miles just rolling hills a mosque
[2:10:57] he said where's he at brother graham i

[2:11:07] well coming down there he'll come like
[2:11:08] this he had packed the rifle a while and
[2:11:10] i'd packed the head and then vice versa
[2:11:12] he just had to walk sideways coming down
[2:11:14] that big horn just raking into the moss
[2:11:17] and we got within about
[2:11:19] a mile of it
[2:11:20] we stopped looking i said that old bear
[2:11:22] baby showing up at me
[2:11:25] i said what's this what's he bothered
[2:11:27] about

[2:11:32] coming across we sat down and got cooled
[2:11:34] off a little
[2:11:36] he said brother brown just think of it
[2:11:39] say we haven't got over about oh less
[2:11:42] than a half an hour we hit that voice
[2:11:44] and
[2:11:44] somewhere between here and there you're
[2:11:46] going to kill a silver tip
[2:11:49] i said that's right
[2:11:50] that's right he said
[2:11:53] i said you're doubting that bud
[2:11:55] you raised up took me with a hand he
[2:11:57] said brother branham
[2:11:58] my brother has never had a fit from that
[2:12:00] day to this

[2:12:43] by the ground or bring him down out of
[2:12:44] the skies or something i said don't you
[2:12:46] worry he'll be there

[2:12:50] another hundred yards he has just about
[2:12:52] wore out to this we weighed about 150
[2:12:54] pound this trophy so coming down the
[2:12:56] hill and you set it down he said i'm

[2:17:17] he said brother branham i didn't want
[2:17:18] him on my lap
[2:17:19] [Laughter]
[2:17:23] he said
[2:17:26] he said but i won't tell you after it's
[2:17:28] over boy if that hadn't been one of them
[2:17:29] visions and i'd seen it happen before
[2:17:31] i'd never come up here without close to
[2:17:33] that bear with you
[2:17:34] and neither one of us could budge me
[2:17:36] weight around a thousand pounds i guess
[2:17:38] so mammoth big fella
[2:17:40] we couldn't cleaning we got skinny we
[2:17:42] started on down and we said brother
[2:17:44] branham we picked up the horns he said
[2:17:47] if them horns are exactly 42 inches so
[2:17:49] i'm just going to have a run and fit i
[2:17:51] said you better have it right now then
[2:17:53] because that's what it is he said i have
[2:17:56] never seen i i it seems to me like i'm
[2:17:58] dreaming this
[2:17:59] and when we got down there
[2:18:01] and i said to um to eddie i said now you
[2:18:04] watch blaine will put his hands i
[2:18:06] remember there's a little hand around
[2:18:08] that horn remember brother freda i told
[2:18:09] you it would be and i said you watch it
[2:18:11] to eddie and so bud said wait you got
[2:18:13] his horse over there and we had bear i
[2:18:15] want to show them horses just tearing up
[2:18:16] everything you know how they do when
[2:18:17] they smell a grizzly or any kind of a
[2:18:19] bear so i i went over there
[2:18:21] help trying to hold a
[2:18:23] a saddle horse trying to get away and he
[2:18:25] went over and got his tape measure come
[2:18:27] walking across there looking at me like
[2:18:29] that he said come here blaine i punched
[2:18:31] eddie
[2:18:32] put it down on this
[2:18:34] and so it helped me 42 inches on the
[2:18:37] nose now them horns shrink about two
[2:18:39] inches when they dry up
[2:18:41] that grizzly bear is laying in my den
[2:18:43] room

[2:18:49] them up there's a tape measure hanging
[2:18:51] on them 42 inches exactly
