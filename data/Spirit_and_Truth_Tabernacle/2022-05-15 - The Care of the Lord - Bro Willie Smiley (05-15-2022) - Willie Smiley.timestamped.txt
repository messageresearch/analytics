[50:42] y'all just y'all just pray for me i i
[50:45] kind of i couldn't print so you know i'm
[50:48] still a little old-fashioned i'm a paper
[50:51] i should have been a paper boy coming up
[50:53] i still like the paper but i told
[50:56] brother jack i guess i'm gonna have to
[50:59] maybe learn i watched brother troy and
[51:02] he'd be pushing and scrolling and i said
[51:04] man i'm still i like to have mark all on
[51:08] my papers and bible we're gonna look in
[51:10] isaiah
[51:11] 54 this morning all right
[51:13] so y'all pray for us
[51:15] i had to try to do this when i was out
[51:17] of town
[51:18] and we prayed at the computer act right
[51:21] but nevertheless y'all know me i might
[51:24] be here and then i'll be there
[51:27] just depends on where the spirit of god
[51:29] moves isaiah 54
[51:32] we want to start at the 11th verse it
[51:34] says
[51:35] o thou afflicted
[51:37] tossed with tempest and not comforted
[51:41] behold i will lay thy stones with fair
[51:44] colors
[51:46] and lay thy foundation with self fires i
[51:50] will make thy windows
[51:52] of a gates and thy gates of
[51:56] kaaba knuckles and
[51:59] all thy borders of pleasant
[52:02] stones all and all thy children shall be
[52:06] taught of the lord
[52:08] and great
[52:10] shall be the peace of thy children
[52:12] that's a powerful statement in itself
[52:16] it says in
[52:17] shall thou be established
[52:19] thou shall be far from
[52:22] oppression for thou shalt not fear right
[52:25] now and from terror
[52:27] for it shall not come near thee
[52:30] behold they shall surely gather together
[52:35] but not by me
[52:37] whosoever shall gather together against
[52:40] thee shall
[52:41] fall for thy sake
[52:43] behold i have created the smith and the
[52:47] that bloweth the coals in the fire
[52:51] and that bringeth forth an instrument
[52:53] for his work and i
[52:55] have created the waster to destroy
[53:00] no weapon that is formed against thee
[53:02] shall prosper
[53:04] and every tongue
[53:05] that shall rise against the judgment
[53:08] thou shalt condemn
[53:10] this is the heritage of the servants of
[53:13] the lord
[53:14] and their and their righteousness is of
[53:18] me said the lord amen may the lord add a
[53:21] blessing to his word this morning he may
[53:22] be seated
[53:24] uh we want to use as a little topic this
[53:27] morning um
[53:28] the care of the lord
[53:31] and uh as a sub
[53:33] title uh the strength of his promises
[53:37] and i i've kind of i i just have several
[53:40] things that i i desire to preach but i'm
[53:44] like brother jack was saying a while
[53:46] back
[53:47] uh when he preached on um the recent
[53:50] message that he was preaching on hurt
[53:53] people hurt people sometimes god gives
[53:55] you things and
[53:57] but it takes the unction of the holy
[53:59] spirit
[54:00] to
[54:01] instruct you when he wanted preach
[54:04] because i believe that
[54:05] you know
[54:07] seed sown got to be sown in the right
[54:09] season in order to bring forth a harvest
[54:12] is that right that's just the laws of of
[54:15] nature is is uh to be able to do things
[54:19] at their appointed time
[54:21] the scripture says there's a time and an
[54:23] appointed time for everything under the
[54:26] sun
[54:27] so the main thing we want to always be
[54:30] in in the perfect will of god is that
[54:32] right
[54:34] um as we begin to look at our text this
[54:37] morning
[54:38] um
[54:39] we we we find um god addressing the
[54:44] redeemed is that right yes amen um
[54:48] and and a lot of times a lot of times
[54:51] people might feel like well god don't
[54:53] care come on but as as i was reading as
[54:57] i was reading the text um this morning
[55:00] and i was just thinking about the mere
[55:03] fact that he's addressing
[55:05] the the saints of god is a real
[55:08] indication of his care yeah
[55:10] a lot of times you know um and you know
[55:13] i was i'm i'm still maturing my mother's
[55:16] still alive by god's grace
[55:18] and uh but coming up a lot of times um
[55:22] i i totally misunderstood
[55:25] my mother
[55:27] not realizing
[55:29] the the mere fact that she would address
[55:32] me right and address situations was an
[55:36] indication that she cared
[55:40] you know i i've had the opportunity over
[55:43] the last couple of weeks to spend time
[55:44] with my my sisters and we we got the we
[55:47] just got the talking and just talking
[55:49] about my mother and just our upbringings
[55:53] versus you know how she allowed us to do
[55:56] certain things and and how you know uh i
[55:59] raised my children and how she raised
[56:02] her daughter and things of that nature
[56:04] she was sharing with me the fact that um
[56:07] my niece was a little upset because
[56:11] my daughter my sister was a little bit
[56:14] uh strict on her and i said well uh i
[56:18] was strict also
[56:20] but but i but i said something to my my
[56:22] sister said but i wouldn't change a
[56:24] thing all right if i had to do it all
[56:27] over again i'll do it the same way that
[56:29] i've done it
[56:31] right based upon scripture
[56:33] and also based upon amen my personal
[56:37] experience in life right amen
[56:40] right right
[56:41] that i would do it the exact same way
[56:44] i would hope that it would garner a
[56:48] different result a lot of times but i
[56:50] don't think that because a lot of times
[56:52] we say hindsight is 20 20.
[56:55] but but i i believe that in in order to
[56:59] get the proper results as believers yes
[57:03] right yes you got to stipulate certain
[57:06] things as believers we have got to
[57:09] realize we are believers right is that
[57:13] right and and our approach cannot be a
[57:16] carnal approach in order to get the
[57:20] desired results from the word all right
[57:24] right this this i was sharing some
[57:26] things i'm gonna get to where i'm gonna
[57:27] go i guess y'all just pray for me
[57:29] uh i was i was talking to my son
[57:33] uh justin uh
[57:35] at the
[57:36] graduation and we were talking and he
[57:39] did a podcast with some of his fellows
[57:41] and this is this young man that was
[57:44] about a few years younger than me he
[57:47] passed away and he had this podcast
[57:49] dealing with uh uh kevin sammy's if
[57:52] y'all ever heard of him and
[57:54] and yeah i used to listen to his podcast
[57:58] a little bit but
[58:00] it's just a lot of things that he he
[58:02] he he referenced wasn't from a
[58:06] biblical standpoint
[58:09] and and the thing of it is when it's
[58:11] secular you're not going to get a
[58:13] balance
[58:15] right you you and then if you're
[58:17] teaching people anything
[58:20] right
[58:21] uh and in this legit you want well he's
[58:24] not a christian i don't think but
[58:27] for me in order to get the balance you
[58:30] got to bring the balance through the
[58:32] scriptures
[58:33] because anything else won't pass through
[58:37] right brother bannon preached a thinking
[58:39] man's filter
[58:41] right
[58:42] and so uh a real thinking man wants the
[58:46] word amen
[58:48] amen let's say that again
[58:52] amen
[58:53] right you you want the word if if not if
[58:56] you're not a thinking man's you want a
[58:59] conal opinion all right
[59:01] all right but see as a christian i'm a
[59:04] thinking man
[59:06] so i want a word perspective
[59:09] because that's the thing that's going to
[59:11] bring the balance
[59:13] all right let's go a little further
[59:16] right
[59:17] when we when we when we think about
[59:20] ministry when when we think about
[59:22] brother jack
[59:23] uh it's just not excitement i like to be
[59:26] exciting we've been excited the other
[59:28] week we were excited we almost total
[59:30] building down
[59:32] i like to be apart
[59:34] as much as possible tearing the building
[59:36] down
[59:38] all right
[59:39] but i'm one that i like to calm
[59:41] everybody down all right all right you
[59:44] know
[59:44] i like for us to be excited but i also
[59:47] like for us to get a realistic view of
[59:50] what's being said not just being excited
[59:53] all right see the address
[59:56] of the word is the care
[59:59] of
[1:00:00] god channeled
[1:00:02] through a ministry all right
[1:00:05] all right
[1:00:06] right yeah right so it's it's
[1:00:09] when
[1:00:10] we're excited
[1:00:12] but also we want to we want to
[1:00:16] you know be inspired to recognize
[1:00:19] god amen right because so often the
[1:00:22] presence of god goes unrecognized
[1:00:25] is that right and a lot of times we we
[1:00:28] can't see be be beyond the
[1:00:31] human instrumentality the veil we get
[1:00:33] caught up right that's what this brother
[1:00:36] smiled all right
[1:00:37] right but but but what about
[1:00:40] the the
[1:00:41] the care of god what about the
[1:00:44] inspiration
[1:00:46] we just being a channel
[1:00:48] where god is trying to show us how much
[1:00:51] he cares
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:54] see
[1:00:55] god cares yes he does do you right
[1:00:59] hey man
[1:01:00] and then you we gotta ask the question
[1:01:02] then what do we really care about all
[1:01:05] right
[1:01:07] come on
[1:01:08] how much how much of the the perspective
[1:01:11] of the work we really care about
[1:01:14] we care as long as we're not getting our
[1:01:16] feelings hurt all right
[1:01:19] all right right we we maybe we care as
[1:01:22] long as
[1:01:23] uh uh um
[1:01:25] it doesn't interfere the word doesn't
[1:01:28] interfere with the way that we think now
[1:01:31] i'm gonna get off this in a minute cuz
[1:01:33] y'all real quiet on me
[1:01:35] i'm about to preach to the lights
[1:01:37] this morning
[1:01:40] see
[1:01:42] but but you know that's kind of how it
[1:01:43] is it's like
[1:01:45] you know we care as long as the word
[1:01:47] don't rub us the wrong way in our idea
[1:01:51] we care praise god hallelujah
[1:01:55] but but when the word begins to
[1:01:57] uh uh rub us the wrong way and rub out
[1:02:01] our carnal ideas we sit back we can't we
[1:02:04] can't hardly get no amens from the
[1:02:06] church like i can't hardly get no amens
[1:02:09] from y'all this morning
[1:02:11] see
[1:02:13] so it's just so unfortunate that god's
[1:02:16] got a god is a god of variety
[1:02:19] and i'm one of those guys that you know
[1:02:22] i just like to ruffle your fellas a
[1:02:24] little bit
[1:02:25] it's all right
[1:02:26] now i can preach it happy too
[1:02:29] but it just ain't seem like lately he
[1:02:31] gave me those happy preaching messages
[1:02:37] now if y'all want me to make it happen
[1:02:39] then y'all got to pull
[1:02:42] see when y'all sit and stare at me kind
[1:02:44] of kind of you know y'all don't realize
[1:02:47] now the gift will start going and
[1:02:48] meddling all right
[1:02:50] but long as y'all smiling and happy and
[1:02:52] pulling an amen
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:56] we'll keep we'll keep it we'll keep it
[1:02:58] happy amen
[1:03:00] but here in in the in the scriptures um
[1:03:04] just kind of land a little foundation
[1:03:06] this morning
[1:03:08] so that we'll understand that
[1:03:11] uh
[1:03:13] god cares
[1:03:15] right i think brother jack kind of
[1:03:18] preached a little on the lines but we'll
[1:03:20] just
[1:03:22] see how
[1:03:24] things go he says oh ye
[1:03:27] oh you afflicted once now watch his
[1:03:31] address if he didn't care
[1:03:33] he wouldn't make no references no

[1:03:58] we we're built
[1:04:00] uh
[1:04:01] we we need
[1:04:02] uh affirmations and different things of
[1:04:05] that nature is that right hopefully that
[1:04:07] was the right word that's right right we
[1:04:10] we we at times we need something
[1:04:13] you know to settle us
[1:04:15] it's it's like it's like the baby that
[1:04:18] falls down
[1:04:19] you know the mother's care he picks it

[1:04:36] down
[1:04:37] you know and and it's not you know uh
[1:04:41] and and i'm gonna say something to the
[1:04:42] fathers too
[1:04:44] because we were real we're
[1:04:46] uh but
[1:04:47] shut up sit down men don't cry
[1:04:51] those are lies
[1:04:52] those are some of the worst things that
[1:04:55] has ever been taught
[1:04:57] you you you you want to project
[1:05:00] uh masculinity right

[1:06:47] so you got to get me out the hot seat
[1:06:50] right there's nothing wrong with you

[1:06:55] of growth you know i thank god that i
[1:06:57] learned how to wash dishes and and clean
[1:07:01] and
[1:07:01] cook and
[1:07:03] different things you know i i don't do
[1:07:05] it as much as i used to but when my wife

[1:07:10] home and i when you know i feel like
[1:07:13] well those are the times where i i bring
[1:07:15] out the cooking skills all right all
[1:07:17] right you know i i want to try to get
[1:07:20] back to cooking a little bit more i
[1:07:22] bought i bought some oxtails and stuff
[1:07:24] home
[1:07:27] now
[1:07:28] listen listen listen
[1:07:30] i didn't finish the rest of the story
[1:07:34] i bought some oxtails and stuff home
[1:07:37] last night because i was like man i want
[1:07:39] to you know i won't even box here it's
[1:07:40] been a minute this and that
[1:07:42] but i kind of forgot how to cook him so
[1:07:44] my wife came with all this meat doing in
[1:07:46] there you go cook
[1:07:48] i like
[1:07:49] no
[1:07:52] no
[1:07:55] you know my care was that i bought them
[1:07:59] and you don't care if you let you go
[1:08:02] you'll cook them
[1:08:03] you know
[1:08:04] until i get my skills back up
[1:08:07] you know i'm a little rusty with with
[1:08:09] the kitchen with the kitchen
[1:08:12] but but while she says oh yeah afflicted
[1:08:14] once right
[1:08:16] right
[1:08:17] and and that's uh
[1:08:20] afflicted is of a problem or
[1:08:22] illness cause pain or suffer to a burden
[1:08:27] bother a distress
[1:08:30] right
[1:08:31] god is showing
[1:08:32] listen
[1:08:34] your afflictions mean something right
[1:08:37] amen right
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] other as as christians and i think
[1:08:43] brother jack was was
[1:08:45] working with some things uh wednesday
[1:08:47] night
[1:08:48] with witnessing
[1:08:50] uh you you can't be
[1:08:53] an appropriate witness outside of care
[1:08:58] right amen
[1:09:01] true christianity
[1:09:04] is about a man care all right
[1:09:08] i mean we we i i don't know somewhere i
[1:09:11] think uh the message supposed to produce
[1:09:15] uh a perfect understanding right
[1:09:18] when that which is perfect could come
[1:09:20] that which is in part supposed to be
[1:09:22] done with but i still think sometimes we
[1:09:25] operate in part understanding instead of
[1:09:28] a man complete understanding
[1:09:31] is that
[1:09:32] right this just from my observation
[1:09:37] because of our attitudes and our
[1:09:39] approach to people whether they're
[1:09:41] nominal or not right
[1:09:44] all right
[1:09:45] right
[1:09:46] and and i think you know um
[1:09:49] what what makes the difference for
[1:09:51] people like the queen of sheba
[1:09:54] what made the difference for her is when
[1:09:56] she came in in contact with with the
[1:09:59] church she saw everything in order
[1:10:03] right she saw the
[1:10:04] the proper
[1:10:06] characteristics on display
[1:10:09] right and see uh
[1:10:12] when when god said amen the son of man
[1:10:16] on the earth he had the appropriate
[1:10:19] response to every situation
[1:10:24] is that right that's right
[1:10:25] yeah that's right his his response
[1:10:29] was was was just spot on
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:35] woman at the well spot on
[1:10:38] he understanding the immaturity of the
[1:10:40] church and said man y'all go get some
[1:10:41] videos yes
[1:10:49] and that's the same thing sometimes
[1:10:51] people see you talking to somebody wait
[1:10:53] a minute what rap doing
[1:10:55] why reb got to be doing anything
[1:10:57] inappropriate all right
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:01] come on come on come on
[1:11:03] i'm quite quite sure
[1:11:06] you know being that there was
[1:11:08] different discrepancy when they came
[1:11:10] back and saw jesus oh you know how
[1:11:14] people wheels turn a lot of times
[1:11:17] right yeah
[1:11:18] oh so was that the reason why he sit
[1:11:21] this way
[1:11:22] all right come on church
[1:11:24] there's a there's a realistic response
[1:11:28] that people have even even as christians
[1:11:32] we have we have realistic a lot of times
[1:11:35] carnal responses but we do have
[1:11:38] realistic responses that's right
[1:11:41] right
[1:11:42] our wheels get determined whether it's
[1:11:45] you know sometimes the spot on the devil
[1:11:47] or whatever it might be
[1:11:49] they they are real responses
[1:11:52] right we have whether we say it or not
[1:11:55] in our thinking a lot of times you know
[1:11:58] they might not have said it but jesus
[1:12:01] jesus already knew y'all can't handle
[1:12:04] this but amen my leading ain't being led
[1:12:07] by almighty god
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:11] amen i'm here for the sake of one
[1:12:16] amen
[1:12:17] amen yeah i i'm here for the sake of one
[1:12:21] right it she had a thirst yes
[1:12:25] and i'm the water
[1:12:28] i'm gonna introduce it now brother jack
[1:12:30] just preached this
[1:12:31] i'm i'm gonna introduce her
[1:12:34] to something that's far beyond anything
[1:12:37] and then that she's faced she tried she
[1:12:39] tried men men didn't work right and men
[1:12:43] and women still won't work
[1:12:47] drugs won't work
[1:12:49] i'm a living witness to those things
[1:12:51] those things don't work
[1:12:54] it takes a man coming in contact with
[1:12:57] the river of life
[1:13:00] oh hallelujah
[1:13:02] right those are the only things that are
[1:13:05] quenched the thirsts that we have is
[1:13:07] that right
[1:13:08] glory to god
[1:13:10] you just look at society it's it's it's
[1:13:13] people trying to quench verses that'll
[1:13:15] never be
[1:13:16] quenched never be quenched young men
[1:13:20] weed and you know men and being money
[1:13:23] and this and you'll never do it you'll
[1:13:26] just you just always be grabbing and
[1:13:28] always seeking and there'll just never
[1:13:31] be a settling
[1:13:33] amen in your heart
[1:13:35] right and i don't know about you you
[1:13:38] know you you want to be settled
[1:13:41] right see
[1:13:43] jesus i mean in this scripture trying to
[1:13:48] bring a settlement
[1:13:50] because you know we've all been
[1:13:52] afflicted
[1:13:54] come on we we we've all been hurt
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:08] right don't know which way to turn
[1:14:11] i think we've all been there a time or
[1:14:13] two
[1:14:15] amen glory is that right come on
[1:14:19] that's that just goes along with life
[1:14:23] naturally and spiritually
[1:14:26] well i'm saying sanctified holy goats
[1:14:29] feel and fire baptized
[1:14:32] yeah but you got an enemy that you gonna
[1:14:34] fight
[1:14:36] there's there's you know
[1:14:38] because you we don't start out as as
[1:14:42] christians mature
[1:14:44] come on
[1:14:46] the holy ghost comes in us as a button
[1:14:50] all right come on
[1:14:52] and there's got to be some growth
[1:14:54] there's got to be some some maturity
[1:14:57] then you can sing the song the things i
[1:14:59] used to do i don't do no more
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:04] but as long as you're immature you're
[1:15:06] going to continue to do the same thing
[1:15:09] you're going to continue to act the same
[1:15:10] old way
[1:15:12] until god comes in amen and brings about
[1:15:14] the change you're going to be the same
[1:15:17] yeah yes sir
[1:15:18] right oh glory to god
[1:15:21] so so you know we we we've all been
[1:15:24] tossed and driven
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:28] but but god's desire
[1:15:31] right
[1:15:32] is for us to be settled
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:35] according to ephesians 4
[1:15:37] right watch watch the blending y'all
[1:15:39] just got to watch the blending of the
[1:15:41] thoughts
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] god gives a five-fold ministry
[1:15:46] for the perfecting the maturing the
[1:15:49] growth of the church amen is that right
[1:15:54] see
[1:15:56] i believe that my approach
[1:15:58] is definitely different than it was way
[1:16:00] back when all right
[1:16:02] because way back when boy it was no
[1:16:05] grace
[1:16:06] it was a graceless gospel
[1:16:09] it was it was just blood
[1:16:12] no blood on the mercy
[1:16:17] come on
[1:16:19] no blood since the dixon might have sung
[1:16:22] this song is dripping with blood
[1:16:25] i used to read sister dixon's famous
[1:16:27] song thank god for mr dixon right
[1:16:30] but but just our approach
[1:16:33] it was no blood
[1:16:35] sometimes it still feel like that it's
[1:16:37] no blood
[1:16:38] it's no grace until we end something
[1:16:44] until until we need grace
[1:16:47] as long as we don't need grace it's just
[1:16:49] blood it's blood
[1:16:51] crucify him
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:55] crucify him
[1:16:56] it's the slaying of the with the sword
[1:17:00] but then but then when it's us and then
[1:17:03] when it's our family
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:07] as long as it's my children
[1:17:10] huh
[1:17:11] you heard with brother smiley's brother
[1:17:13] smiley children as long as it's my wife
[1:17:16] as long as it's my cousin
[1:17:18] but when it's yours
[1:17:21] those that know the words of prayer
[1:17:25] please pray for me
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] i got a little baptism in me i feel good
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:32] somebody's sister you know about that
[1:17:34] you kind of look like you came up in the
[1:17:35] back to chat
[1:17:37] come on those that know we get
[1:17:40] and dignified with it
[1:17:43] but long as it's somebody else's crucify
[1:17:45] him
[1:17:46] is have you heard it's everybody it's
[1:17:48] it's everybody you know on the phone
[1:17:54] huh and here's the here's the ironic
[1:17:56] thing
[1:17:57] when when when a story is first told
[1:18:00] it's told one way
[1:18:01] when again on the west coast it's
[1:18:04] totally different
[1:18:07] it's like it's been embellished
[1:18:10] it's been so many lies added to it
[1:18:14] it's like grand day what
[1:18:18] i was preaching in carolina i had to
[1:18:20] tell them listen church if y'all if
[1:18:22] y'all want to know anything about
[1:18:23] brother smiley just get my number
[1:18:28] and call me on the phone
[1:18:31] and i'll be glad to tell you what's
[1:18:33] going on cause i ain't scared
[1:18:36] right come on yes come on
[1:18:38] one thing one thing about it you know
[1:18:41] it's a message that i want to preach boy
[1:18:42] i tell you
[1:18:43] see i'm i'm i'm in the discovering
[1:18:47] phases of my life
[1:18:50] and so when you're in the discovery and
[1:18:51] i'm gonna just touch it i'm gonna leave
[1:18:53] it alone come and preach it
[1:18:54] you know you you no longer fear
[1:18:58] the opinions and different things of
[1:19:00] people
[1:19:04] come on
[1:19:06] i'm gonna leave that alone
[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:12] oh yeah i got a whole lot to preach on
[1:19:14] now church but i'm here this morning i
[1:19:17] don't know how far i'm gonna get
[1:19:19] it it's it's a lot
[1:19:21] when last time brother jack was was was
[1:19:23] out and we preached we was talking about
[1:19:25] a whole a holistic
[1:19:27] view
[1:19:28] because we we've spent so much time
[1:19:32] on doctrine
[1:19:34] right and the bible said let us put
[1:19:37] aside those things
[1:19:40] right and let us let us
[1:19:42] go on
[1:19:44] let us go on
[1:19:47] huh
[1:19:48] we we've got to go on we've got to take
[1:19:51] the people further
[1:19:53] than the doctrines of baptism and
[1:19:56] whether brother brian we all know i'm
[1:19:59] not sitting around fighting with anybody
[1:20:01] whether or not brother branham was a
[1:20:02] prophet and all that i don't have time
[1:20:05] no sir
[1:20:06] is that right because one thing he said
[1:20:09] this is for the people who god has given
[1:20:12] me to preach to
[1:20:14] so so i'm i'm listen if you're a new
[1:20:18] convert that's one thing but most of us
[1:20:21] has been around
[1:20:23] for i'm gonna say it like we used to say
[1:20:24] um ten years all right
[1:20:27] i don't know what umpteen deals but you
[1:20:29] know we used to say that we've been
[1:20:32] around a little minute
[1:20:34] is that right
[1:20:35] i have to get y'all you know
[1:20:38] um
[1:20:40] all right
[1:20:41] so so we we gotta go
[1:20:44] because you you start watching where's
[1:20:46] the youth
[1:20:50] we're the young people where the young
[1:20:51] adults where where's our grandchildren
[1:20:54] all right
[1:20:55] come on all right
[1:20:58] all right somewhere we missed something
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:02] and this is the season for us to
[1:21:04] continue to grow up
[1:21:07] like like brother brother jack was
[1:21:09] saying earlier okay y'all said this well
[1:21:11] we'll implement this
[1:21:14] right that's right
[1:21:15] there's things i think is needed for
[1:21:18] this season
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:20] glory to god because what we're seeing
[1:21:25] right what we're seeing we're seeing
[1:21:27] more divorces than i've ever seen
[1:21:32] we're seeing families shaking at the
[1:21:34] core right
[1:21:37] right glory to god
[1:21:39] young young men and young women just out
[1:21:43] here
[1:21:45] you you see young people that growing up
[1:21:48] in the churches that we've pastored
[1:21:50] doing things unimaginable that you never
[1:21:53] could have grasped
[1:21:55] you never would have you never could
[1:21:57] have conceived that they would be in
[1:21:58] these situations
[1:22:01] but could it be that we
[1:22:04] missed it
[1:22:08] this this ain't no slight
[1:22:10] it's i'm not trying i ain't that smart
[1:22:13] now
[1:22:14] i'm just being inspired in the season
[1:22:17] right things is just dropping in my
[1:22:19] spirit because my own personal uh
[1:22:23] experience
[1:22:25] right that god is uh uh
[1:22:28] awakening like we say everything is in
[1:22:31] his season
[1:22:33] everything is in his time maybe it
[1:22:36] wasn't the season but we're in the
[1:22:38] winding up time
[1:22:40] we're in the winding up season
[1:22:43] and then
[1:22:44] you know we do have a promise
[1:22:47] we gonna get to it i don't know how i'm
[1:22:48] gonna get but but i'm feeling good
[1:22:50] anyway this morning we have been given a
[1:22:53] promise
[1:22:54] by god for our young people
[1:22:58] right
[1:22:59] uh but you know we we've got to we've
[1:23:03] got to re-examine
[1:23:05] right

[1:41:16] we could be better off
[1:41:20] see
[1:41:22] here we talking about the care of god
[1:41:24] but
[1:41:25] let's bring it right down
[1:41:29] right to the seats
[1:41:32] i don't care
[1:41:34] but let me keep going and keep going
[1:41:37] keep going
[1:41:40] see
[1:41:43] you know it used to be it was a time in
[1:41:45] scripture where
[1:41:47] man you knew who was christians and who
[1:41:50] weren't christians
[1:41:51] that's right
[1:41:53] when when the disciples
[1:41:55] were were filled with the baptism of the
[1:41:58] holy ghost giving power from the people
[1:42:01] around them knew who they were
[1:42:06] they knew the difference
[1:42:09] right
[1:42:10] and people people argue with you or
[1:42:13] argue with us or try to argue with us
[1:42:15] about dress standards and all of those
[1:42:18] different things right see it used to be
[1:42:21] a time when i was coming up
[1:42:24] uh if you if you saw a woman
[1:42:27] you know dressed a certain way you
[1:42:29] automatically kind of knew that she was
[1:42:32] a street walker or she was a prostitute
[1:42:36] right that's right uh if you was a
[1:42:38] little young that folks in the
[1:42:39] neighborhood used to call you fast
[1:42:43] she's so fast

[1:52:31] see
[1:52:34] he was out there so he knew what was out
[1:52:36] there
[1:52:37] so he used to try to inform us we used
[1:52:40] to try to bypass the information
[1:52:44] right but the information was good
[1:52:46] information
[1:52:47] right
[1:52:51] i i may not make you jump i can like i
[1:52:54] say

[1:53:31] me
[1:53:33] so all i can say is you know you thank
[1:53:36] god when those times come where i preach
[1:53:38] a faith message i thought this was going
[1:53:40] to be good different

[1:53:46] different
[1:53:50] you know
[1:53:51] it just ain't going to make you shout
[1:53:54] but our guarantee is gonna make uh it's
[1:53:56] gonna help us we got we got we got these
[1:53:59] kids growing up in church
[1:54:02] right
[1:54:03] and it's it's important

[1:54:27] person
[1:54:29] under understand his family dynamics
[1:54:33] right his family pedigree but also
[1:54:37] learn who he is as because he's got to
[1:54:40] have something
[1:54:42] that'll keep him

[1:54:47] watching people fall apart i'm watching
[1:54:49] folk that i've known been around church
[1:54:51] my mind is being blown
[1:54:54] and and and and all i could come up with
[1:54:57] right
[1:54:59] god god starts striking something is
[1:55:01] like what it is is that people do not
[1:55:04] know
[1:55:05] who they are
[1:55:09] if if you take them away from the main
[1:55:11] church body
[1:55:13] they don't know who they are
[1:55:17] right
[1:55:18] we we saw good looking and fine and this
[1:55:21] and that and the other
[1:55:23] she don't know who she is he don't know

[2:02:32] and i i just want to say that so because
[2:02:34] i want you to i you know i want
[2:02:35] everybody to understand who i am
[2:02:38] right and my my sole objective when you
[2:02:41] come up here you may shout you may not
[2:02:44] i'm fine with that i just joke with
[2:02:45] y'all about that but i'm going to say
[2:02:48] how what he places on my heart
[2:02:51] and sometimes you may not like it
[2:02:54] sometimes you may
[2:02:57] if you differ with me that's that's your
[2:02:59] choice
[2:03:00] you know like i preached out of town a
[2:03:02] couple of weeks ago and a brother was
[2:03:04] standing there waiting on me
[2:03:06] that's why i want to talk to you
[2:03:10] i disagree with what you said
[2:03:12] that's good that's your that's your
[2:03:13] choice
[2:03:15] but but when i when i let him know you
[2:03:17] know this is what i was trying to say
[2:03:19] and da da da da well i well that's your
[2:03:22] choice but it don't change don't
[2:03:24] really change anything
[2:03:26] yeah you don't really change anything i
[2:03:28] i said what i said and i understand why
[2:03:31] i said that based upon the word whether
[2:03:34] you agree with that or not
[2:03:37] i'm not gonna take that back because you
[2:03:39] don't agree with it
[2:03:42] as long as i can prove it by not one
[2:03:45] scripture but i can prove it through the
[2:03:48] bible
[2:03:49] i really don't care about your feelings
[2:03:51] because they hurt
[2:03:53] right
[2:03:55] god wanted that to be said man
[2:03:58] so
[2:03:58] he inspired me to say it
[2:04:01] so either you're gonna do it just say

[2:08:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:08:29] how we uh appreciate them brother smiley
[2:08:32] on the spot in the care of the lord as
[2:08:36] he was just kind of working through
[2:08:38] the sermon
[2:08:40] and
[2:08:40] certainly just the way god gives it to
[2:08:42] brother smiley to give it to us we
[2:08:44] realize god cares
[2:08:46] amen and you know just looking at the
[2:08:49] he was going down a channel there how
[2:08:51] jesus came to the woman
[2:08:54] and just how you know maybe the
[2:08:55] disciples just misunderstood
[2:08:58] uh why jesus is there talking to that
[2:09:00] woman but
[2:09:01] uh and maybe all the the the uh
[2:09:05] just maybe
[2:09:06] some of the criticism that could have
[2:09:08] come out of it
[2:09:09] uh but the reason jesus was at the woman
[2:09:11] with uh i mean at the well with that
[2:09:14] woman talking to that woman is simply
[2:09:17] because he cared
[2:09:18] amen and he cares enough just for one
[2:09:21] he'll go out the way just to get to that
[2:09:23] one
[2:09:24] i believe god sent us a message this
[2:09:26] morning to show he cares no matter what
[2:09:27] we're going through just just a
[2:09:29] scripture you go back and just reflect
[2:09:31] on that to the afflicted
[2:09:33] toast
[2:09:34] right i mean just those are words that
[2:09:36] you can really ponder on god god cares
[2:09:39] he has a special message directly for
[2:09:41] you
[2:09:42] in the midst of being afflicted and
[2:09:43] being told at the end of that you know
[2:09:45] when he got to the end of the chapter
[2:09:46] that one last verse says no one formed
[2:09:49] against you
[2:09:50] gonna prosper and every tongue that
[2:09:52] rises against you will be condemned
[2:09:54] this is the heritage
[2:09:56] of the servants of the lord i i just
[2:09:59] appreciate amen just the way god just
[2:10:01] speaks to us a man through his servant
