[1:00:19] whole world is just doing like this
[1:00:20] right now yeah but I tell you you got to
[1:00:23] have a solid Foundation all right and
[1:00:26] your solid foundation we got to build
[1:00:28] upon his faith glory and it's a sick
[1:00:31] it's a sense it's that super sense
[1:00:33] brother BR talks about is that something
[1:00:35] on the inside that you see things that
[1:00:38] other people don't
[1:00:40] see you know you wanton your body obeys
[1:00:42] your confession so if you're sick this
[1:00:44] morning let your body just keep saying
[1:00:46] I'm well if you need another job just
[1:00:49] say Lord you're going to be my provider
[1:00:51] hallelujah oh we got to claim that this
[1:00:53] morning I don't how far we're going to
[1:00:55] get brother Jack with this presence but
[1:00:57] you know we might not give him any notes
[1:00:58] in but praise God praise God he has a
[1:01:02] plan and we know that so let's turn this
[1:01:04] morning to uh Isaiah as brother Jack
[1:01:07] we're sitting eating last night and here
[1:01:10] he go start started preaching my sermon
[1:01:12] a little bit I said Brother come on
[1:01:14] brother so you got to you got to think
[1:01:17] about Isaiah 58 this morning I just kind
[1:01:19] of paraphrasing for time but uh but at
[1:01:22] the writing Isaiah he had a very hard
[1:01:25] task prach it a very very hard task
[1:01:28] because the people that once was with
[1:01:30] God was in captivity and bondage now
[1:01:34] come on you know I believe that's the
[1:01:36] condition of this world all right you
[1:01:38] know I once serve God abrah uh
[1:01:41] throughout Generations he could you
[1:01:42] could put all the presidents our
[1:01:44] forefathers on every corner and it still
[1:01:46] wouldn't be close to God I'm
[1:01:48] paraphrasing that today but but think
[1:01:50] about how far away the world has got
[1:01:52] from God everywhere you go it it it's
[1:01:55] corrupt everywhere you look but there's
[1:01:57] a bride in the house tonight there's a
[1:02:01] there's a bride that he's coming for
[1:02:02] that I'm speaking to this morning and
[1:02:05] I'm telling you young old mother age you
[1:02:07] are I tell you get the holy spirit
[1:02:10] because he said you're sealed until the
[1:02:13] day of redemption you know what you
[1:02:15] might backslide but you know what you're
[1:02:17] still a child of God don't let Satan
[1:02:20] tell you any other way there might be
[1:02:22] somebody that came to the altar one day
[1:02:24] gave the heart was filled up and they
[1:02:26] might bu in the world they might be
[1:02:28] backslid but God will not lose one of
[1:02:30] them you keep praying for you keep
[1:02:33] believing I don't know what it is about
[1:02:35] this message but I tell you what it's
[1:02:37] called us out hallelujah it's an exodus
[1:02:40] is fixed in the F place and you and me
[1:02:43] are fixing to get out of here and when
[1:02:45] your brother and sisters out in the
[1:02:46] world or Solomon said pray for this
[1:02:48] family or I tell you we need to pray for
[1:02:50] one another we need to uplift people
[1:02:53] that that are in this word I was sitting
[1:02:55] at the table last night and I told
[1:02:56] Brother Jack I said you know I'm tired
[1:02:58] of this message box all right
[1:03:02] on I'm tired of living in a message box
[1:03:05] that we have all the gold we have
[1:03:09] everything we have need of but we're not
[1:03:10] sharing it with
[1:03:13] anybody how can you not share the share
[1:03:16] what God's gave you to somebody else
[1:03:19] because once more there was a Chris
[1:03:20] Kathy in a Baptist Church that one day
[1:03:23] God came my way and they say why don't
[1:03:26] you listen to this tape or you know they
[1:03:29] didn't even say a few words all they
[1:03:31] said was listen to this tape or you

[1:03:35] big Sermon Just live a
[1:03:37] life but I'm telling you this we're
[1:03:39] still here all right we're still here
[1:03:42] today and I'm telling you you might be
[1:03:44] the very person on your job all right
[1:03:46] might be the person at the gas station
[1:03:48] wherever it's h hey it might be somebody
[1:03:50] at this church over here they just going
[1:03:53] the wrong way
[1:03:54] there's two ways you got the right way
[1:03:56] and the left way and brother Jack said
[1:03:58] just follow the sign for the church I
[1:04:00] said well we going to the bride
[1:04:03] church but what it's Grace that passed
[1:04:05] your away it's Grace that you got eyes
[1:04:08] to see today hallelujah praise God I'm
[1:04:11] sorry I see how far we get but in Isaiah
[1:04:14] 58 we we're going paraphrase a little
[1:04:16] bit but but he was in a very difficult
[1:04:19] time he was sitting here that once wor
[1:04:21] worship God but now worshiping idols and
[1:04:24] and and came to a place it was a very
[1:04:26] hard task that they were in bondage they
[1:04:29] were in bondage but I want I want to go
[1:04:31] through Isaiah 58 uh verse 9 first 58
[1:04:35] ver9 he says then shall they call on the
[1:04:38] Lord and shall
[1:04:40] answer they shall cry and they shall say
[1:04:43] hear
[1:04:44] I if thou take away from the midst of
[1:04:48] the Oak and putting forth off the finger
[1:04:50] and speaking vanity and verse 10 it says
[1:04:53] and if thou draw out thy soul to the
[1:04:56] hunger and satisfy The Afflicted Soul
[1:04:59] then shall thy light rise obscurity and
[1:05:02] thy Darkness be as a noon Day verse 11
[1:05:06] and the Lord shall guide thee
[1:05:08] continually can we say that the Lord
[1:05:11] shall cond guide us continually oh thank
[1:05:14] you Lord and satisfy thy soul and
[1:05:17] drought and make fat thy bones and thou
[1:05:19] shalt be like watered garden and like a
[1:05:22] spring of water whose Waters fell not
[1:05:25] verse 12 and they shall they that they
[1:05:28] that shall be they shall build the old
[1:05:31] PL old waste places and thou shall raise
[1:05:34] up foundations of many generations and
[1:05:37] thou shall be called the repairer of the
[1:05:40] breach and the restorer of pass to dwell
[1:05:44] in oh I believe I'm speaking to
[1:05:46] restorers today that he had to come by
[1:05:49] your way and restore something to dwell
[1:05:52] in why don't you think that He restored
[1:05:55] you one day he came by your house hey I
[1:05:58] tell you maybe he didn't give you a
[1:06:00] message book maybe he didn't tell a
[1:06:02] message quote he just stopped on your
[1:06:04] way and said hey if you'll print of your
[1:06:06] sins and be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] I'll fill you yes oh think about that
[1:06:11] one today you may be

[1:08:20] their website and maybe maybe it' be one
[1:08:23] of them that we get out of here I'm not
[1:08:26] worried about a position today I'm not
[1:08:28] worried about how far they think they've
[1:08:30] got in life you know what you've got the
[1:08:32] best thing that ever hit the planet and
[1:08:35] that God has gave you eyes to see and
[1:08:38] ears to hear the truth I you got
[1:08:40] something to praise the Lord about if

[1:08:54] I tell you that's how Isaiah was he you
[1:08:57] know he's at a time and he kind of told
[1:08:58] the people he said just get back to God
[1:09:01] and I tell you why he'll come come for
[1:09:03] you brother brother BR says he he says
[1:09:05] this quote I like what he says he said
[1:09:07] if you want to get somewhere with god
[1:09:08] let's listen to this never let an
[1:09:11] arrogant Spirit ever come
[1:09:14] around I tell you last night I said
[1:09:17] praise God help me Lord amen don't let
[1:09:20] No Malice come oh this will do us some
[1:09:23] good this morning yes he said no matter
[1:09:25] what anybody says if you're if you're
[1:09:28] all wrong he said don't let don't never
[1:09:31] build up a complex against that
[1:09:34] person he say see he said you be sweet
[1:09:38] and kind yes oh I think we brother Jack
[1:09:41] I think we've not listened to these
[1:09:42] messages today or read the Bible
[1:09:45] sometimes oh I tell you Lord help me get
[1:09:48] out of the message bubble God he said
[1:09:50] you be sweet and kind remember God loves
[1:09:54] you when you were in
[1:09:56] sin oh you he says and if the spirit of
[1:09:59] God is in you you love the other person
[1:10:02] when he's been wrong all right oh my I
[1:10:06] tell you we can stop there and preach on
[1:10:08] all that all day I tell you love him
[1:10:10] when he's been wrong oh he didn't say oh
[1:10:14] well he he's got to have everything in
[1:10:15] line come on no all the clothes all
[1:10:18] right I tell you the devil knows all the
[1:10:20] quotes he knows all the scriptures but
[1:10:22] it's the life behind the name oh it's
[1:10:26] the life behind the name that makes the
[1:10:27] devil tremble glory to God oh but he
[1:10:30] says and if the spirit of God is in you
[1:10:33] you love you love the other person when
[1:10:36] he's been wrong see he said just pray
[1:10:38] for him and love one another amen he
[1:10:41] said above everything love God and love
[1:10:43] one another amen oh and be humble with
[1:10:47] God and around one another amen oh wow
[1:10:50] brother Jack we stay on this all day
[1:10:52] prach and God will bless it right and
[1:10:55] it's it's hard telling what he will do
[1:10:58] usually when churches begin to get
[1:10:59] numbers
[1:11:01] uhoh and get to getting a little big or
[1:11:05] something like that he said then they
[1:11:07] get away from the real thing the real
[1:11:09] thing so don't focus on numbers today
[1:11:13] Lord help me not to focus on numbers I
[1:11:16] told someone the other day I said Rachel

[1:14:01] say brother Jack let me test him he says
[1:14:04] he but brother Solomon oh brother Troy
[1:14:08] think about it oh he says he believes a
[1:14:10] message he says he preaches this but let
[1:14:12] me let a sickness come on his body and
[1:14:15] let me see if he's going to trust me
[1:14:16] through this or trust me through that
[1:14:19] amen I tell you what and then here's job
[1:14:22] 23 he says behold I go forward he said
[1:14:25] but he is not there listen and backward
[1:14:28] but I cannot perceive him on the left
[1:14:30] hand where he said where he doeth work
[1:14:33] he said but I cannot Behold Him He hided
[1:14:36] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[1:14:38] see him he said but he knoweth the way
[1:14:41] yes that I take when he has tried me I
[1:14:45] shall come forth as
[1:14:47] gold oh Church you might not see him on
[1:14:49] the right hand you might not see him on
[1:14:51] the left hand but he's working something
[1:14:54] for your good oh he's working you out oh
[1:14:58] he's working you out this morning you I
[1:15:01] tell you what it's time to praise them
[1:15:02] more in our trials and our things we go

[1:15:07] praise them sometimes than you're going
[1:15:09] through the midst of the the the
[1:15:11] valley but he's still worthy of Our
[1:15:14] Praise no matter how far we go or how
[1:15:17] much we get on our back he's still
[1:15:19] worthy of our
[1:15:20] praise that's right I thought about
[1:15:22] Chronicles 15:2 he said the Lord is with
[1:15:25] the with you while you be with him and

[1:24:30] what he says in 59 he's talking to him
[1:24:32] he says behold he said but I like what
[1:24:34] he says the Lord's hand is not shortened
[1:24:37] all right he said that it cannot save
[1:24:40] neither his ear heavy that it cannot
[1:24:43] hear oh Church don't forget that his
[1:24:45] that his hand is not shortened today but
[1:24:48] his ear is still listening for a Cry

[1:25:05] and your God and your sins have hid his
[1:25:08] face from you that we that he will not

[1:28:43] know what the bride of Christ I'm
[1:28:46] speaking to a bride today that's going
[1:28:47] to be on the inner city where the lamb

[1:29:33] looking for that day yes sir that's what
[1:29:35] we we should all be striving for amen no
[1:29:37] matter what trial and what I want to
[1:29:39] just really bring out this morning is
[1:29:41] you know God is God is with you amen you
[1:29:44] might not see him today amen you might
[1:29:46] not feel them you might think you're
[1:29:48] going through the hardest trial but God
[1:29:50] is right there yes sir God is right
[1:29:53] there amen so I want to bring something
[1:29:54] out in Genesis that that really stood
[1:29:56] out to me I want to bring this home in
[1:29:59] Genesis he said God test Abram Abraham
[1:30:02] all right and you know I read that
[1:30:04] scripture in Isaiah where it says here
[1:30:06] am I here I am and I want to bring this
[1:30:09] out and it just really hit me last night
[1:30:11] about had Revival in the in the house it
[1:30:13] says and it came to pass after these
[1:30:15] things verse one that God did tempt
[1:30:18] Abraham and said unto him Abraham he
[1:30:21] said behold here's another one here I am
[1:30:25] all right so there's like six or seven
[1:30:26] different places throughout the Bible I
[1:30:28] didn't realize that he said Here I Am
[1:30:30] the importance of here I am and he says
[1:30:33] verse two he said and he said take now
[1:30:35] thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou
[1:30:38] lovest and get thee into the land of
[1:30:41] Mora and it says and offer him there a
[1:30:44] burnt offering on one of the mountains
[1:30:46] which I will tell thee of and Abraham
[1:30:48] rose up early in the morning and saddled
[1:30:51] his ass and took two of his young going
[1:30:54] somewhere with it two of his young men
[1:30:56] and and with him and Isaac his son and
[1:30:58] clave the wood for the burnt offering
[1:31:01] and Rose up and went into the place
[1:31:03] which of God had told him and then in
[1:31:05] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[1:31:09] and saw the place a far off and Abraham
[1:31:12] I love this AB Abraham said unto his
[1:31:15] young men abide ye here with the ass he
[1:31:18] tells his servants abide your ass and I
[1:31:21] will go with that lad and go Yonder and
[1:31:23] worship and come again to you so he's
[1:31:26] like hey but Solomon and but Troy is
[1:31:28] like Hey Y'all stand here we're going
[1:31:30] just I I'm not even going to tell you
[1:31:32] you know he he didn't even tell his wife
[1:31:33] brother said she was nervous she was a
[1:31:35] nervous person and he didn't want to
[1:31:37] even tell her wow I read that last night
[1:31:40] he said the lad I will go up Y and
[1:31:42] worship and come up again to you Abraham
[1:31:45] took the word off the burnt offering and
[1:31:46] laid it upon Isaac his son he took the
[1:31:49] fire in his hand and a knife and there
[1:31:51] went both of them together and I just
[1:31:54] want to bring this out uh to today and
[1:31:57] he goes verse 7 and Isaac spoke un
[1:31:59] Abraham his father and said my father
[1:32:01] and he said here am
[1:32:04] I my son I tell you it would do a some
[1:32:07] good just to just to get quiet with God
[1:32:09] and say here I am here am I it would do
[1:32:13] some good just to get in a car or
[1:32:15] wherever at and just say Lord wherever
[1:32:18] you want me to be here am
[1:32:19] I he would doing some good just to say
[1:32:22] Lord whatever you want us to do too many
[1:32:25] times we want to do what we want to
[1:32:28] do or we go ahead and pre-plan our life
[1:32:31] and say you know we got our house and we
[1:32:33] got our cars and we got everything
[1:32:36] situated but God might be saying hey
[1:32:38] here am I just listen to me I want to
[1:32:41] send you here I want you to do this but
[1:32:44] so many times we crowd it out with
[1:32:45] things of life and we don't sit here and
[1:32:48] say Lord what's your will what's your
[1:32:51] will for my life sir but I want you to
[1:32:54] catch this on verse five he says and
[1:32:56] Abraham said unto his young men abide
[1:32:58] here with me in the ask and I will go
[1:33:00] let I will go Yonder and worship and
[1:33:02] come again to you do you understand that
[1:33:04] he said in worship come on yes sir come
[1:33:07] on I literally about had Revival last
[1:33:09] night all right because what worship to
[1:33:12] you might look like might not be the
[1:33:14] worship you think it
[1:33:16] is you might have to worship through a
[1:33:18] child you might have to worship when you
[1:33:20] lost your job all right you might have
[1:33:22] to pay your bills and don't know how
[1:33:24] you're going to pay your NE check but
[1:33:26] you still
[1:33:27] worshiping you might put your money in
[1:33:29] the offering plate but you're still
[1:33:31] worshiping God you might have 10 cents
[1:33:33] to your name and a check come in the
[1:33:35] mail all right oh but he said hey we're
[1:33:38] going to worship God I tell you if he
[1:33:41] told his wife we're going to worship
[1:33:42] brother Jack she would have thought it
[1:33:44] was
[1:33:45] worship but he said I'm going to worship
[1:33:48] Hallelujah so what you call worship
[1:33:50] today might be trial that he's fixing to
[1:33:53] turn into a
[1:33:54] blessing oh think about it today oh
[1:33:58] think about it and verse seven and Isaac
[1:34:00] spoke un Abraham here am I my son and he
[1:34:03] said behold the fire in the wood he said
[1:34:06] but the but where is the Lamb for the
[1:34:08] burnt offering and Abraham said my son
[1:34:11] God will provide himself a lamb for the
[1:34:13] burnt offering oh think about it he came
[1:34:17] verse n he said he came to a place which
[1:34:19] God had told of him and Abraham built an

[1:40:24] Lord think about that this morning oh
[1:40:26] the very evidence that he produced he
[1:40:29] wanted him to get rid
[1:40:30] of wow oh I tell you can we be there in
[1:40:33] our lives and say Lord here am I send me
[1:40:37] send me here let me be a witness to
[1:40:39] somebody uh in in in a few scriptures I
[1:40:42] thought about Jacob 31 you don't have to
[1:40:44] turn there but 3111 when God appeared to
[1:40:47] Jacob in a dream Jacob said here am I
[1:40:50] here I am sorry here I am Moses Exodus
[1:40:54] 3:4 when Moses heard God to call him
[1:40:56] from the burning bush he responded what
[1:40:58] did he say Here I Am amen I tell you it
[1:41:02] just takes any of us not just the
[1:41:04] preacher but all of us just to say Here
[1:41:06] I Am hallelujah oh this action begins
[1:41:09] The Exodus he says in Samuel 1 Samuel
[1:41:12] 3:4 then God Called to Samuel as a child
[1:41:15] while he was living with Eli he said he
[1:41:18] said here I am
[1:41:21] think about I'm just going through
[1:41:23] someone the some of these in the Bible
[1:41:25] that said here I am that's right that
[1:41:27] here I am that's right amen the prophet
[1:41:30] said he said he said he'll do he said he
[1:41:32] will do but he will try to figure it all
[1:41:34] out he said we got to figure it out he
[1:41:37] said what if Peter stopped that night to
[1:41:39] figure it out talks about on the water
[1:41:42] now Lord you told me to walk on the
[1:41:44] water he said now let me see now I'm
[1:41:47] strictly a scientist he said I know the
[1:41:50] formula of the water oh don't you know
[1:41:52] some of them I know the formula brother
[1:41:55] Solomon I know how I I've read the book
[1:41:57] and I know this way I tell you what you
[1:42:00] ain't know
[1:42:01] nothing he said just stick your hand in
[1:42:03] a thing of water and pull it out and see
[1:42:05] where it's at that's right that's how we
[1:42:08] are today even me today amen we need God
[1:42:12] he said why no man can walk on hydrogen
[1:42:15] or oxygen he said there's no need of me
[1:42:18] trying that he said you asked me
[1:42:20] something in possible then Peter never
[1:42:23] never would have walked on the water the
[1:42:25] only thing he never figured out how it
[1:42:27] was he just took God at his word and
[1:42:30] went walking on that's what we got to do
[1:42:34] he said don't try to figure it out how
[1:42:36] God is going to do is doing these things
[1:42:39] just accept it and go on Hallelujah so
[1:42:43] if you're going through a trial today
[1:42:44] just accept it and go on amen he says
[1:42:47] what if Moses turned aside and see the
[1:42:49] burning bush he said say wait he said
[1:42:51] let me take some of these leaves off I'm
[1:42:54] going to take them down to the
[1:42:56] laboratory I thought was great to find
[1:42:58] out why the chemical on this Leaf it
[1:43:01] that it doesn't burn haven't you met
[1:43:03] someone like that brother Jack right he
[1:43:05] said there's for this the the fire is
[1:43:08] the fire is all right he said now he
[1:43:10] never approached God but he took off his
[1:43:12] shoes and he humbly and sat down and God
[1:43:15] spoke to him right out out the b of the
[1:43:18] burning bush he said that's the way you
[1:43:21] got to approach God he said humbly
[1:43:24] taking his word no matter what it looks
[1:43:28] like he said there's God you said so I
[1:43:31] believe it and that settles it I brother
[1:43:35] Nathan he greets you in the name of the
[1:43:37] Lord and he said something the other day
[1:43:39] brother Jack I almost literally took off
[1:43:41] running hanky came out and I said
[1:43:43] brother I I almost took off I probably
[1:43:46] would have scared half this church out
[1:43:48] of this
[1:43:49] place he said something I want to I want
[1:43:51] to just share it and rep repeat it oh my
[1:43:54] but I want you think about the message
[1:43:55] and where you've came out of maybe
[1:43:57] you've been in the Baptist Church in the
[1:43:59] world maybe you haven't been to church
[1:44:01] but I want to share something I hope it
[1:44:02] encourages you that he said that really
[1:44:04] blessed me you think about all these
[1:44:06] people falling away and falling away to
[1:44:08] the message you know maybe maybe there a
[1:44:11] raise of hands that can say hey who was
[1:44:13] in the Baptist or Catholic any the
[1:44:14] nomination raise your hand okay quite a
[1:44:17] few probably half okay came out of the
[1:44:20] nomin maybe you're raised in the message
[1:44:22] God bless you praise the Lord you should
[1:44:24] be thankful today that's right but have
[1:44:26] you ever thought about writing the book
[1:44:29] about all the wrongs that you came out
[1:44:33] of do you ever just like when I came out
[1:44:35] of the Baptist Church did I make a
[1:44:37] website about about the wrongs that the
[1:44:39] the the Baptist Church
[1:44:41] did I hope you understand where I'm
[1:44:47] going oh I'm telling you this is good
[1:44:50] amen think about it for a minute have
[1:44:52] you ever thought about writing brother
[1:44:54] Troy writing a book about the mess you
[1:44:56] came out of but then they but then they
[1:44:58] write a message they write a whole
[1:45:00] website about the message of the wrongs
[1:45:02] that is made so there's something right
[1:45:04] about this
[1:45:06] message there's something right about
[1:45:08] this
[1:45:09] message oh if they going to make a whole
[1:45:12] website they going to put literature out
[1:45:14] there I tell you you didn't come out the
[1:45:16] Baptist Church and write a book oh so I
[1:45:19] need to tell you there's power in this
[1:45:21] message it did it for right it'll do it
[1:45:24] for you it'll save your family it'll
[1:45:27] save your kids and just say Here I Am
[1:45:30] Lord
[1:45:32] hallelujah Glory oh I don't know why I
[1:45:34] went there today it was not even in my
[1:45:36] notes but I thought about it I hope
[1:45:38] that'll do you some good God when you
[1:45:41] think about reading the message think
[1:45:43] about hey they didn't make no books
[1:45:44] about it they made a bunch of books
[1:45:47] about this right because all their life
[1:45:49] they got to find the
[1:45:51] faults they got to spend their whole
[1:45:53] life finding faults I tell you he was
[1:45:56] still just a man amen but man was still
[1:45:59] a man that's right he still made
[1:46:02] mistakes but I'll tell you what I'm so
[1:46:04] thankful for him glory to God hallelu
[1:46:06] I'm still thankful for him I'm thankful
[1:46:09] for him brother Jack thankful for the
[1:46:11] truth yes but Isaiah 68 he said also I
[1:46:15] heard the voice of the Lord saying whom
[1:46:17] shall I send and who shall go with go
[1:46:19] for us and he and he said I here am I
[1:46:23] send me oh I'm telling you throughout
[1:46:26] the Bible I thought about ananas acts
[1:46:28] 910 he said and there was a certain
[1:46:31] disciple in the Damascus named ananas
[1:46:34] and he said unto the Lord in a vision
[1:46:36] ananas and he said behold I am here Lord
[1:46:41] how are we answering to the Lord today
[1:46:42] when he calls on you and I thought about
[1:46:45] you know paraphrasing for time but I
[1:46:47] thought about the uh the the widow woman
[1:46:50] where Elijah come up and asked her for a
[1:46:52] meal think about it she had everything
[1:46:56] she all had was enough for one cake to
[1:46:59] bank all she had didn't he have water
[1:47:02] for them her and her son to even get by
[1:47:04] but he said you know what your Barrel
[1:47:05] won't go
[1:47:07] dry but Elijah walked in the room he
[1:47:09] says here am I all right just believe
[1:47:12] this truth praise God just believe my
[1:47:15] message and that's what the prophet of
[1:47:17] God's done in our day he's came and
[1:47:19] brought a message for you to say here am
[1:47:22] I here's the whole book here's the whole
[1:47:24] word of God what are you doing with it
[1:47:27] oh you you sharing it with your loved
[1:47:29] ones are you are you being a light in
[1:47:32] this Dark Age amen I thought about like
[1:47:35] he was speaking on when
[1:47:37] Elijah and G Gesa was there and second
[1:47:41] Kings and First Kings and they were they
[1:47:43] were there and and he prayed and he he
[1:47:45] couldn't see he said you know how does
[1:47:47] the king of Sierra how how does Elisha
[1:47:50] know uh what I what I'm talking about in
[1:47:52] my bed
[1:47:53] chamber think about it amen because he
[1:47:56] met the he met The Great I Am he knew
[1:48:00] who his father was he met him one day
[1:48:03] praise God and he's sitting there and
[1:48:05] he's all feared up Gaz is all feared up
[1:48:08] because he doesn't see all the Chariots
[1:48:10] around him and he says Lord open young
[1:48:13] man's eyes GL oh I tell you what if he
[1:48:17] would just come by your way and open
[1:48:18] your eyes one day and real is what you
[1:48:20] got on your shelf what you got on these
[1:48:23] tapes it's Heavenly Mana but Solon said
[1:48:26] who listening to that tape and blessing
[1:48:27] his heart is because it's spiritual food
[1:48:30] in due season it's something that that's
[1:48:32] on the inside that you got to feed and I
[1:48:35] tell you what when you feed it with the
[1:48:37] right things the right things come
[1:48:39] out the right things come out I thought
[1:48:42] about Daniel and the three Hebrew
[1:48:44] children as the musicians come I thought
[1:48:47] about Daniel they met that they met they
[1:48:50] met met the same God that Moses did all
[1:48:53] through Daniel the Lions the Lions did
[1:48:56] he met the her he met he made the
[1:48:58] greatest The Great I Am amen think about
[1:49:01] it they get to the fiery furnace we all
[1:49:04] know the story and I just love what they
[1:49:06] say in Daniel
[1:49:07] 3:17 verse he says he Heats for
[1:49:10] paraphrasing he Heats it seven times
[1:49:12] harder he says you know you Worship You
[1:49:15] worship these golden images and he comes
[1:49:18] down to the burning fiery furnace in
[1:49:20] verse 16 Shadrach mesach and the bito
[1:49:22] answer said of the king old
[1:49:24] Nebuchadnezzar he said we are not
[1:49:26] careful to answer thee in this man it
[1:49:29] would be good to to answer that way
[1:49:31] sometimes in our life he said but if it
[1:49:33] be so our God whom we serve is able to
[1:49:36] Deliver Us From The Burning fiery
[1:49:38] furnace he will deliver us out of thy
[1:49:40] hand O King he said but I like verse 18
[1:49:43] but if not oh I tell you can we get that
[1:49:46] way in our life but if not if I'm the
[1:49:49] only one standing if everybody walks
[1:49:52] away but if not all right that's my
[1:49:54] heart today brother Jack if it's just me
[1:49:56] and you standing brother Sal whatever it
[1:49:58] is but if not I'm going to still stand
[1:50:02] sir because guess what I'm going to get
[1:50:04] on that day I told somebody the other
[1:50:06] day I said you believe what you want to
[1:50:08] believe I said but we'll see at the
[1:50:10] end amen
[1:50:13] amen he said the Saints will judge the
[1:50:16] earth I can't explain it the Saints will
[1:50:18] judge the Earth he said we line up with
[1:50:19] our pastor and then with the prophet of
[1:50:22] our day and the prophet will present us
[1:50:25] to Jesus Christ all right all right all
[1:50:29] right I tell you what there's a lot of
[1:50:30] people that's got keys in their hand
[1:50:32] that doesn't realize the power you have
[1:50:35] right yes the power that you've got laid

[2:10:20] um just so much that brother Chris
[2:10:24] shared there and I love that a little
[2:10:27] statement kind of at the end couple
[2:10:29] things one um quote that he read was
[2:10:33] when Abraham was willing to offer Isaac
[2:10:37] destroy the evidence that God had given
[2:10:39] him of fulfilling the promise the the
[2:10:42] statement that was made in there is that
[2:10:44] that was a real vday for
[2:10:47] God
[2:10:48] often times in our lives we're looking
[2:10:53] to have Victory after Victory after
[2:10:55] Victory but there's sometimes in our
[2:10:58] life God wants to experience a
[2:11:02] victory Hallelujah and and you have to
[2:11:05] be willing to go through some things in
[2:11:07] order for God to experience a victory in
[2:11:09] your
[2:11:10] life Hallelujah and as Abraham went
[2:11:13] through what he went through the great
[2:11:15] sacrifice that he was making that is
[2:11:18] when God had Victory that's when God
[2:11:21] could
[2:11:22] smile come on think about it that's when
[2:11:24] that's when God got happy that made God
[2:11:27] want to shout look at what my son is
[2:11:29] going through look at what my daughter's
[2:11:30] going through but yet they worshiping
[2:11:32] and praising me in the midst of
[2:11:35] [Music]
[2:11:36] itall Abraham say I'm going to worship
[2:11:39] that's the very first time that the word
[2:11:41] worship is used in the Bible is in that
[2:11:45] story right there sometimes worship
[2:11:49] requires a
[2:11:51] [Music]
[2:11:53] sacrifice y'all y'all making me feel
[2:11:55] like I want to sing say say Here's My
[2:12:01] Worship take joy
[2:12:05] in make it
[2:12:07] up I want to put a smile I want to a
[2:12:12] smile come on say I present my heart to
[2:12:18] you heart to you I
[2:12:23] present
[2:12:25] I right to you to you all right stop
[2:12:30] right there stop right
[2:12:33] there I just love the Lord I just love
[2:12:35] the
[2:12:38] Lord Brother Chris was
[2:12:41] saying you know we um have a lot of
[2:12:45] people coming up and you know if if you
[2:12:47] if you if you you search Google you find
[2:12:50] out so many things that people saying
[2:12:53] about um the message and and all of that
[2:12:56] and just a beautiful point when people
[2:12:58] left Pentecost when they left Baptist
[2:13:03] when they left Presbyterian when they
[2:13:05] left Methodist you can find no
[2:13:08] websites about any of that but why is it
[2:13:11] that people want to come against this
[2:13:14] message anytime you find people that are
[2:13:17] fighting the message then it lets you
[2:13:19] know there's probably something
[2:13:21] there Hallelujah cuz I learned a story I
[2:13:24] learned something a long time ago
[2:13:27] people don't throw
[2:13:29] rocks they don't throw bottles and they
[2:13:33] don't pick up sticks to hit
[2:13:35] trees that don't have no
[2:13:38] [Music]
[2:13:41] fruit when mango season came and we were
[2:13:44] going to look for mangoes all over the
[2:13:46] city cuz we didn't have a tree in our
[2:13:49] yard at the time we go look for them all
[2:13:50] over the city we took our rocks we took
[2:13:52] our bottles we only look for
[2:13:55] trees that had fruits cuz if they didn't
[2:13:58] have no fruit we were just wasting our
[2:14:00] time come on somebody evidently the
[2:14:04] fruit must be pretty good if it's
[2:14:07] getting hit so

[2:17:27] hallu this wonderful word that we heard
[2:17:29] on
[2:17:31] today God uh
[2:17:35] we simply have to
[2:17:39] respond with an act of
[2:17:42] surrender God here am
[2:17:46] I Lord Jes
[2:17:48] we s saw it there and just thr so many
[2:17:50] scriptures but there with Abraham when
[2:17:52] he heard you
[2:17:54] calling multiple times first to even
[2:17:57] take his son to a place where you would
[2:18:00] show him he said here here here I am
[2:18:02] here am
[2:18:03] I and God the the other thing that I
[2:18:06] caught there in the scriptures brother
[2:18:07] Chris was reading that Abraham's
[2:18:11] response triggered down to his son
[2:18:15] hallelujah hallelujah because was time
[2:18:17] for the sacrifice the some was able to
[2:18:19] say the exact same thing here am
[2:18:23] I then an angel would called out of
[2:18:26] heaven and say Abraham stay your hand I
[2:18:28] know I know you love me I know I I I I
[2:18:31] you have proven it to me and and even at
[2:18:33] that moment when he when you called him
[2:18:35] twice he said here am
[2:18:38] I God we want to be able to surrender
[2:18:42] ourselves maybe there's someone here
[2:18:44] that has not come to that place of
[2:18:45] complete and total surrender I pray
[2:18:48] father this would be a message that
[2:18:50] would that would trigger the depths of
[2:18:51] their heart God that they would say the
[2:18:54] same thing that Abraham and Isaac and so
[2:18:56] many said here am I we surrender to you
[2:19:00] Jesus we want you to have our lives we
[2:19:02] want you to have our hearts we want you
[2:19:05] to have our homes we want you to have
[2:19:07] our businesses we want you to have our
[2:19:09] careers God we we want you to have our
[2:19:12] cars everything that belongs to us we
[2:19:14] know you gave it to us we want you to
[2:19:16] have it God and we want you to enjoy it
[2:19:19] and Lord the lives that we live don't
[2:19:20] don't don't don't let us complain about
