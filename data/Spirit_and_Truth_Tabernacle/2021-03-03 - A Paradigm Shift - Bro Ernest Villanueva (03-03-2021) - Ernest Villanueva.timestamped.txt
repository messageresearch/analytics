[15:47] special things for us uh i was telling
[15:50] somebody
[15:52] one things i have noticed and even um
[15:55] a little bit before the fast but even
[15:56] through this just there is
[15:58] a genuine uh revival spirit
[16:03] that is in this sanctuary and um
[16:06] i mean when you talk about uh
[16:08] omnipotence doing something special
[16:11] uh when you have a revival spirit like
[16:13] that there's an anointing
[16:14] a faith that elevates where people just
[16:17] begin to believe
[16:18] for the impossible and uh we just we
[16:21] expect the impossible
[16:23] amen because our god is a god of the
[16:25] impossibility so
[16:26] uh i just i just thank god for the
[16:28] anointing and i thank god that you know
[16:30] when
[16:31] it's like when you come here you know
[16:32] you're gonna hear from god amen you know
[16:35] you're going to hear from god
[16:36] and i just i just appreciate that amen
[16:38] so
[16:39] we want to continue this time of fasting
[16:41] amen and stay prayerful

[20:21] possible
[20:32] god bless you saints it's a great
[20:35] privilege to be
[20:36] with you once again i was thinking as i
[20:39] was
[20:40] driving down to west palm beach that
[20:43] last year the last assembly that i was
[20:47] able to be with was your assembly and
[20:51] when i went home
[20:52] they closed the border down in canada
[20:54] and i live on the u.s side
[20:56] only one mile from the canadian border
[20:59] and i have not seen my pastor since
[21:01] january
[21:02] of last year and
[21:05] in our church the only ones that can be
[21:07] present are
[21:08] is the ministers and the song leaders
[21:10] and the technicians
[21:12] but nobody can be in the church
[21:15] and they're serious in in canada in fact
[21:18] three times they came
[21:19] in the middle of the service the police
[21:21] came to make sure
[21:22] everybody had their mask on and
[21:24] everybody was socially distant
[21:27] so as i was speaking with brother jack
[21:29] that
[21:30] that scripture i was glad when they said
[21:33] let us come into the house of the lord
[21:36] and we're all looking forward to the
[21:38] time where we can be
[21:40] rejoined thankfully we have a campground
[21:42] on the u.s side so we have a chapel
[21:44] there
[21:45] so the believers on the u.s side can
[21:47] gather and
[21:48] we stream our service back to canada and
[21:51] on sunday morning they stream the
[21:53] service
[21:54] up to where we are so
[21:57] i'd like to have your seats just for a
[21:59] moment before
[22:00] i read a scripture
[22:06] i want to just give my own testimony
[22:09] that
[22:10] i believe with all my heart that we are
[22:13] the most blessed people
[22:15] who have ever walked on planet earth
[22:18] to live in the time that we're living in
[22:21] to see what we see
[22:22] and to hear what we hear and to know
[22:25] what we know
[22:26] and to see we have tomorrow's headlines
[22:29] today and it seems like day
[22:32] by day by day by day the prophecies that
[22:36] brother branham
[22:37] laid down are coming into manifestation
[22:41] i've also done a lot of studying about
[22:43] the age that we're living in
[22:45] and there has been an invasion of
[22:48] insanity
[22:50] that has struck the world brother
[22:52] branham said in 1964
[22:54] that if time were to go on
[22:58] for 50 years the whole
[23:01] world will be in total insanity
[23:05] so that would have been 2014.
[23:10] and here we are seven years down the
[23:12] road from that
[23:15] and the the only way that i can
[23:18] rationalize the world that we're living
[23:21] in
[23:21] we know there's only one same mind that
[23:24] is the mind of christ
[23:26] and so it is impossible for a sane mind
[23:30] to understand an insane mind
[23:33] any more than an insane mind can
[23:36] understand a sane mind
[23:39] and the world has been bamboozled
[23:42] by the devil and it's it's
[23:45] sometimes it's hard to come to grips
[23:47] with but 99.9
[23:51] of the people in the world do not know
[23:53] what you and i know
[23:55] they have no idea that god has come
[23:58] again
[23:58] for a second time this time in word
[24:02] form which is a more powerful form than
[24:05] the time he came the first time
[24:07] because now in the days of the voice of
[24:09] the seventh angel
[24:11] all the mysteries of god hath been
[24:14] revealed
[24:15] you know you think back when brother
[24:16] brandon the first message that brother
[24:18] branham ever spoke
[24:20] was faith is the substance that was the
[24:23] first message that was recorded
[24:26] and was printed the first seven
[24:29] words that brother branham spoke
[24:32] said now we're getting some gadgets
[24:36] for recording now think about that
[24:40] brother branham at that time in his
[24:42] ministry
[24:42] he there's no way he could have known
[24:45] the extent
[24:46] and the magnitude and the scope that his
[24:48] message was going to have
[24:50] all over the world but god had the first
[24:53] seven words he spoke
[24:55] as a little as a little signal from me
[24:58] i hope it is for you now we're getting
[25:02] some gadgets for
[25:03] recording recording the days of the
[25:06] voice
[25:07] of the seventh angel amen
[25:10] now you and i every one of us we are in
[25:14] a great battle brother branham
[25:17] called it the greatest battle ever
[25:19] fought
[25:21] and your battle is not my battle and my
[25:23] battle is not your battle
[25:26] some may be going through a physical
[25:28] battle a financial battle a spiritual
[25:31] battle
[25:31] an emotional battle maybe it's a battle
[25:34] with family
[25:35] maybe it's a battle at work all
[25:37] different kinds of battle
[25:38] but it's the greatest battle ever fought
[25:42] and in ephesians 6 it says we wrestle
[25:44] not
[25:45] against flesh and blood but against
[25:47] principalities
[25:48] against powers against rulers and evil
[25:51] spirits in high places
[25:53] now these are real supernatural entities
[25:57] it's the army of the enemy it's like he
[26:00] has
[26:00] his generals and captains and sergeants
[26:04] and privates and they know each one of
[26:07] us
[26:08] they have a script on each one of us
[26:11] they know where we're weak they know
[26:13] where we have fallen
[26:14] in the past and sometimes it seems like
[26:18] they organize a swat team and that swat
[26:20] team
[26:21] comes after us and it battles us and
[26:24] you can feel that eerie presence of of
[26:27] the devil sometime
[26:29] when you know you're getting ready to be
[26:31] attacked
[26:32] and that's the time to get on our knees
[26:35] and brother branham as i was reading
[26:38] he was given instructions on how to
[26:41] fight the enemy he says that we should
[26:45] cut them chop them whack them
[26:49] slice them name them kick him
[26:52] out cast him out kill him
[26:57] now brother branham he was talking about
[27:00] taking
[27:01] the sword of the spirit the armor of god
[27:04] you know it's more important when we
[27:06] wake up in the morning to put on the
[27:08] armor of god
[27:09] than it is to put on our natural
[27:11] clothing
[27:12] [Music]
[27:14] when i wake up in the morning there's
[27:16] got to be two deaths
[27:17] i gotta die and the devil's gonna die
[27:21] first thing in the morning bind that
[27:24] yapping dog before he can even get
[27:27] started
[27:28] take control over him let him know who
[27:31] you're going to serve
[27:33] let him know the power of god is greater
[27:36] than all the power
[27:37] that he can muster amen
[27:40] glory think about the the billions of
[27:44] people
[27:45] that are walking around on this world
[27:48] and they have literally become
[27:49] puppets of satan he tells them what to
[27:53] look at
[27:53] he tells them what's important he tells
[27:56] them what to give their time
[27:57] and their attention to he tells them
[28:00] that the stars of the world
[28:02] whether they're business stars or
[28:04] political stars
[28:05] or sports stars or music stars or any
[28:08] kind of stars
[28:09] he tells them that those are the kind of
[28:11] stars that they should be looking at
[28:14] but i'm so thankful that god has sent
[28:16] the seventh star
[28:18] in this day and that seventh star has
[28:21] given us a blueprint
[28:23] of god's word of what is important to us
[28:26] and if we keep our eyes fixed on that
[28:29] like a pit bulldog on a meat wagon i'm
[28:32] gonna
[28:32] follow your word god i know this word
[28:35] leads to eternal glory
[28:39] what greater thing could we ask for than
[28:42] eternal life
[28:44] could you imagine if somebody could say
[28:46] i've got a bottle of elixir here
[28:48] and i can get guarantee you a thousand
[28:51] years of life
[28:53] what do you think some of these
[28:54] billionaires what do you think they
[28:56] would give an
[28:57] auction if they could be guaranteed a
[28:59] thousand years of life
[29:02] in a thousand years of life it cannot
[29:04] even be measured against eternity
[29:06] because there's no time in eternity
[29:10] and so we're down here on the earth for
[29:12] a very short time
[29:14] even solomon in all solomon's glory
[29:18] after he had backslid after he had
[29:20] finally
[29:21] come to grips with what he had and who
[29:23] he was
[29:24] and where he was richest man in the
[29:28] history of the world
[29:29] up until that time he said vanity
[29:33] vanity all is vanity
[29:38] a mere chasing after the wind
[29:41] and so here we are friends on a
[29:44] supernatural
[29:45] mystical journey
[29:49] god has captured your attention
[29:52] and god has given us the privilege of
[29:54] opening this bible
[29:56] this bible friends this is a
[29:59] supernatural book
[30:02] 66 books 40 different authors
[30:05] and yet every one of those those books
[30:08] they dovetail
[30:11] the jews had hundreds of prophecies of
[30:14] messiah
[30:15] and that messiah was coming and yet when
[30:17] he came
[30:18] they missed him they called them every
[30:21] kind of a foul name you could think
[30:23] about
[30:24] and finally they took them and they put
[30:26] them on a cross
[30:30] i have listened to probably 50 or more
[30:34] testimonies
[30:35] of jews who became christians i'm not
[30:38] talking about message christians
[30:40] but just christians and and when they
[30:43] are converted
[30:44] they look back and they say oh isaiah 53
[30:48] isaiah 9 6 how could our ancestors have
[30:52] missed it how could they have crucified
[30:55] their own messiah
[30:57] and they go back to family and they go
[30:59] back to friends
[31:00] and they try to testify and they try to
[31:02] witness to them
[31:03] and many of them are put out of their
[31:05] family
[31:07] you know the worst thing that can happen
[31:09] in a jewish family
[31:11] is for one of their children to get
[31:13] married to a
[31:14] this is how they say it a christian
[31:19] a pagan christian
[31:22] one who worships three gods
[31:25] how could my son how could my daughter
[31:28] have been
[31:28] so deluded to follow after pagan
[31:32] paganism and many of those rabbis
[31:36] have never darkened the first page of
[31:39] the new testament because they know
[31:42] it's a lie they know it's wrong
[31:45] in their own minds
[31:48] but one day 144 000 of them
[31:52] are going to be quickened by moses and
[31:55] elijah
[31:56] and as we stand i'm going to have you
[31:58] read
[32:00] in the word with me in luke chapter 24
[32:02] but i think of what happened in texas
[32:05] just last week god sometimes
[32:09] you know that brother brandon preached
[32:11] that message the flashing red light of
[32:13] his coming
[32:15] do you know in texas they experienced
[32:18] a mini tribulation in texas
[32:23] they went without electricity some of
[32:25] them for five days
[32:28] in the midst of the most brutal cold
[32:30] they can remember since back in the
[32:32] 1980s
[32:35] no electricity no heat
[32:38] the generators didn't work and those
[32:42] little children running around mommy i'm
[32:45] cold
[32:45] mommy i'm cold and they were hungry
[32:48] and they didn't have any fresh water
[32:50] they didn't have any fresh water to
[32:52] to brush their teeth or to bathe with
[32:56] and we can't even imagine what those
[32:58] people went through
[33:00] but but that that that is just a warm-up
[33:03] that's that's a many many many amateur
[33:06] tribulation
[33:07] for what the world has got you know my
[33:10] pastor
[33:10] who brings greetings to you brother
[33:12] biskell and brother tom ray
[33:14] and brother john andes and all the other
[33:17] ministers with us
[33:19] brother bischo when i would travel with
[33:21] him all around the world at special
[33:23] meetings when he was under a severe
[33:25] anointing and he was trying to get the
[33:27] word and just
[33:28] nail the word down he said this is god's
[33:31] word
[33:32] he said you have two choices you can
[33:34] either receive it
[33:36] or welcome to the tribulation
[33:44] as we turn to the bible
[33:49] in luke 24
[33:54] verse 1 and before we read let's pray
[34:02] father how thankful
[34:05] i am that brother jack has opened the
[34:08] door
[34:09] to have me come and visit with the
[34:11] saints
[34:12] how much i enjoyed our fellowship the
[34:14] last time and
[34:16] our trip down to boynton beach and he
[34:18] took me around the president's white
[34:20] house down there
[34:22] and brother clinton allowed me to drive
[34:24] in a tesla
[34:26] and i went back home with so many
[34:28] wonderful
[34:29] experiences but this is a new experience
[34:32] god
[34:33] it's a new day it's a new hour your
[34:36] children have new needs tonight
[34:38] and i pray that you would meet those
[34:40] needs
[34:41] the bible said that you would give us
[34:43] the desires of our heart
[34:45] and lord as long as those desires are
[34:48] centered
[34:48] upon the revealed word the redemptive
[34:52] blessings of the resurrection
[34:54] you are obligated to your word a prophet
[34:57] of god said you're the high priest
[34:58] sitting
[34:59] at the right hand of majesty waiting to
[35:01] make good all the redemptive blessings
[35:04] of the resurrection so we come to you
[35:06] tonight lord
[35:07] confessing that your word is true
[35:09] confessing that we are your children
[35:12] confessing that we are a needy people
[35:14] and confessing that we believe
[35:17] all that you have promised in your word
[35:19] would come to pass
[35:21] thank you lord for this day for the hour
[35:24] for this gathering
[35:25] and we ask all these blessings with a
[35:28] great
[35:28] confidence for we ask it in your
[35:31] precious name
[35:32] of our lord jesus christ amen
[35:36] now this this message that we believe
[35:40] it is spoken to us
[35:43] in a language that it takes the token
[35:46] to understand it and like i said this is
[35:50] a
[35:50] supernatural book and god has to open
[35:54] your eyes to it to see it the bible said
[35:58] he's a rewarder of those who
[36:00] diligently search after him so once god
[36:04] opens our eyes it was him that called us
[36:07] we didn't go looking for him he came
[36:09] looking for us
[36:10] but when he found us then he says now go
[36:13] and search my word and you will find me
[36:17] and so in luke chapter 24 verse 1
[36:21] now upon the first day of the week very
[36:23] early in the morning
[36:25] they came unto the sepulcher bringing
[36:28] the spices
[36:29] which they had prepared and certain
[36:32] others with them
[36:34] and they found the stone rolled away
[36:37] from the sepulchre
[36:38] and they entered in and they found
[36:41] not the body of the lord jesus
[36:45] amen god bless you and you can have your
[36:48] seats
[36:52] i'd like to speak to you tonight a
[36:54] thought
[36:56] entitled a paradigm shift
[37:01] and many people they have they have
[37:04] known the definition of a
[37:08] paradigm for a long time we've known
[37:11] that a paradigm is a model
[37:14] or an example like if you would say
[37:18] about a senior sister in the church
[37:20] that that sister she is a paradigm
[37:23] of virtue in other words she's a model
[37:26] or an example
[37:27] of virtue but probably about 20 years
[37:31] ago
[37:31] it came into our vernacular the word
[37:35] a paradigm shift
[37:38] so a paradigm shift is a radical
[37:43] change of thought brought
[37:46] about by a very unusual
[37:50] event or a keen
[37:53] insight into a matter
[37:57] if i can repeat that a paradigm shift is
[38:00] a
[38:01] radical change of thought
[38:04] brought about by a very unusual
[38:07] event or a keen insight
[38:12] into a matter now the story is told
[38:16] of a man in new york city
[38:19] at six o'clock in the morning he was
[38:22] with his two children
[38:23] four and six years old and
[38:26] the subway came to a stop and the man
[38:29] got on the subway with his two children
[38:31] and there was only one seat available
[38:34] so the man sat down and each one of the
[38:36] children
[38:37] sat on his lap and as the subway began
[38:40] to proceed
[38:41] the man just kind of nodded out
[38:45] so as children being young and they just
[38:48] got up
[38:49] and they began to play and they began to
[38:52] run
[38:52] up and down the aisle and as they ran
[38:54] their little elbows
[38:56] one hit a newspaper one of them hit a
[38:59] man's elbow
[39:00] and it tipped over coffee all over his
[39:02] suit and tie
[39:04] and and as they continued on this the
[39:07] people who were looking at them
[39:09] they were angry in fact if looks could
[39:12] kill
[39:12] those children they would have been
[39:14] corpses
[39:17] and finally one man walked up and he got
[39:20] right in the face of the sleeping man
[39:22] and he said sir and the man jumped up
[39:25] startled he said
[39:26] what's wrong he said your children
[39:29] your children are causing a ruckus here
[39:33] they are juvenile delinquents and you
[39:35] are apparent delinquent
[39:38] and now the man got up and looked and
[39:41] every eye
[39:42] on that subway was trained on him
[39:46] and and he began to apologize she said
[39:49] please
[39:50] forgive me he said i i should have been
[39:53] i should have been taking better care of
[39:55] my children i'm so sorry
[39:57] he said but i've been through a horrible
[39:59] experience he said last night
[40:01] we were at the supper table and my wife
[40:03] began to get a horrible
[40:04] headache and and finally we had to take
[40:07] her to the emergency room and they took
[40:09] her in
[40:09] and a couple hours later they came back
[40:13] and she was gone she'd had an aneurysm
[40:17] and he said and now it's just a few
[40:20] hours ago
[40:21] and my mind is is just spinning he said
[40:24] i don't know
[40:25] what i'm going to do i don't have any
[40:27] family here
[40:28] and and i don't know about my children
[40:31] how they're going to go to school and
[40:33] who's going to take care of them
[40:34] and and so please
[40:38] forgive me
[40:42] and all of a sudden those people that
[40:44] had looked
[40:45] upon that man with anger and disgust
[40:50] all of a sudden that man had only spoken
[40:53] less than two minutes
[40:54] and their minds had been turned 180
[40:58] degrees
[41:00] and and one man walked up with this
[41:02] thermos bottle and gave him a cup of
[41:04] coffee
[41:07] another man walked up and put some money
[41:08] into his hand and then it seemed like a
[41:11] parade of people coming up there
[41:13] and trying to comfort the man and and
[41:15] giving money
[41:16] [Music]
[41:17] and and the women were reaching into
[41:19] their purses and taking out gum and
[41:21] candy for the children
[41:23] and talking to them
[41:24] [Music]
[41:26] and finally one man he walked up he said
[41:28] sir
[41:29] he said i don't i don't
[41:32] mean to you know try to be a big shop
[41:35] but i do have a large company here in
[41:37] in town and i don't know what kind of
[41:39] work you do but
[41:40] whatever kind of work you do i will find
[41:43] a position for you
[41:45] in my company and whatever kind of
[41:48] salary
[41:49] that you are earning i will increase it
[41:51] to make up for the additional spences
[41:53] you're going to have
[41:55] being without your wife and so you think
[41:58] about how
[41:59] quickly a man's mind can change
[42:03] if they get the right information
[42:06] that corrects what they had initially
[42:09] looked at you know the only exercise
[42:13] some people ever get is jumping
[42:16] to conclusions
[42:24] so let's talk in the bible
[42:28] about some paradigm shifts in the bible
[42:32] the first one we can talk about
[42:36] is the angels that rebelled
[42:40] against god rebelled
[42:44] against the one who created them
[42:47] and they were listening to one of the
[42:48] created ones
[42:51] and when they got kicked out of heaven
[42:53] they got a real paradigm shift
[42:56] right they left glory they left heaven
[43:00] they left paradise they left a place
[43:03] where
[43:03] you know they were they were worshiping
[43:05] god
[43:06] and they saw they had been deceived and
[43:09] now they had lost
[43:11] their inheritance
[43:15] then the next paradigm shift we see
[43:19] is adam and eve there in the garden
[43:23] every day god would come down in the
[43:25] cool of the evening
[43:28] they were amateur gods had control
[43:31] over all of the garden control
[43:34] over all the animals the lions the
[43:37] tigers
[43:38] the elephants the bears all the way down
[43:42] to the smallest animal
[43:46] and when satan who had been cast down
[43:50] there is a term it's called epigenesco
[43:52] and it's a greek term
[43:54] which means having a knowledge of the
[43:56] principles of life
[43:58] and satan now who had been cast down he
[44:01] is observing god
[44:02] in creation and he's watching and
[44:05] watching and watching
[44:07] and because he had a knowledge of the
[44:09] principles of life
[44:11] he was able to discern that the serpent
[44:15] and eve could procreate
[44:20] i believe at one time that serpent he
[44:22] might have been just a harmless serpent
[44:24] walking around the garden until satan
[44:28] came and
[44:29] entered into him
[44:32] and he began to speak to eve
[44:36] he said yay has god said you can't eat
[44:38] out of all the trees in the garden she
[44:40] said oh no
[44:40] we could eat out of all the trees in the
[44:42] garden butter the tree in the midst of
[44:44] the garden
[44:44] god said you shall not eat it or touch
[44:46] it lest you die so the serpent
[44:51] he comes back and he quotes the word
[44:53] back to her
[44:54] almost perfectly he said
[44:58] you shall not surely die
[45:02] so he inserted the word not
[45:07] and cain was of the product
[45:10] of the not and therefore he came to
[45:16] naught
[45:21] adam and eve were put out
[45:24] of the garden put out
[45:27] of their close fellowship
[45:31] in contact with god
[45:35] the serpent he got a paradigm shift
[45:38] right
[45:39] after his success he was probably like a
[45:42] lawyer
[45:43] he was probably walking around he was
[45:45] probably pretty happy
[45:47] with what he had done
[45:50] pretty happy with his success and when
[45:53] god
[45:53] came he said adam where are you and he
[45:56] wasn't asking him what
[45:58] tree are you behind
[46:01] he was asking him where are you in your
[46:03] spiritual life
[46:05] look where you have fallen from what
[46:08] happened
[46:11] now remember adam entered into that sin
[46:16] because of his agopo love for eve
[46:19] he loved her didn't want to lose her
[46:25] so he enters into the sin then when god
[46:29] asked them what happened
[46:34] he said that woman that you
[46:38] gave to be with me she gave me
[46:42] of the fruit and i did eat what happened
[46:45] to his agapo love
[46:50] [Music]
[46:53] he had a radical paradigm shift
[46:55] [Music]
[46:58] and then god said to the woman what is
[47:00] this you have done
[47:03] she said the serpent beguiled me or he
[47:06] seduced me
[47:07] or he deceived me
[47:10] and i did eat now here's the serpent
[47:14] standing there brother brent said great
[47:15] big tall fella
[47:17] about 10 feet tall
[47:21] and god said because you have
[47:24] done this he didn't say because you have
[47:27] said this
[47:30] because you have done this on your belly
[47:34] what from a 10 foot tall
[47:38] i don't know how long that snake was
[47:39] brother jack
[47:41] might have been a ten foot snake
[47:45] paradigm shift
[47:49] how about noah and his family they went
[47:52] from a very advanced civilization
[47:54] with billions of people on the earth
[48:00] i was showing brother jack a quote where
[48:01] brother branham said
[48:03] in noah's day there were more people on
[48:06] the earth
[48:06] than there are now
[48:13] wow and only eight went
[48:16] in the boat they left one civilization
[48:20] and when they landed on dry ground it
[48:23] was a brand new
[48:25] civilization they were the only human
[48:28] beings left
[48:29] out of billions
[48:35] how about abraham and sarah
[48:39] one day old man an old woman
[48:42] next moment young man and a young woman
[48:48] abraham probably said sarah
[48:52] what's happened to you he said i don't
[48:54] know abraham but
[48:55] whatever happened to me i think it's
[48:57] happened to you too
[49:05] jacob had to wrestle with the angel of
[49:08] the lord
[49:11] and the angel touched his thigh
[49:15] and after he touched his thigh he limped
[49:18] all the rest of his life he was now
[49:21] israel and everybody that saw him said
[49:24] see that
[49:27] that used to be jacob but now it's
[49:30] israel
[49:31] because the angel of the lord touched
[49:33] him
[49:34] and now he walks different
[49:38] he talks different he thinks different
[49:42] everything about that man is different
[49:46] why he wrestled with the angel of the
[49:50] lord
[49:51] and every one of us here tonight if you
[49:53] are a true believer of this message
[49:56] you have wrestled with the angel of the
[49:59] lord
[50:00] and you have had a paradigm shift from
[50:03] the religious world that you were once
[50:05] in
[50:05] or the worldly life that you once had to
[50:08] this brand new
[50:09] supernatural life
[50:13] i think about the philippines the
[50:14] philistines
[50:16] when david went there and cut off
[50:18] goliath's head
[50:19] they went from being you know yeah yeah
[50:21] yeah we're the best we're the most
[50:23] powerful
[50:24] but when david cut off his head
[50:28] changed him and they ran for the hills
[50:31] that's right when samson
[50:34] when he had a paradigm shift when he's
[50:37] there
[50:38] and he's grinding away grinding at the
[50:41] mia the wheel
[50:43] and and and the fuzz started growing
[50:45] back on his head
[50:47] and the more fuzz grew back the faster
[50:49] he grinded
[50:50] and he grinded and he grinded
[50:54] you know if that was me if i was one of
[50:56] those philistine leaders
[50:58] he would have got a buzz cut five times
[51:00] a day
[51:02] there would not have been a chance for
[51:04] one bit of peach for us ever to grow
[51:06] back on that head
[51:08] and he said lord just once more
[51:13] and in his death he killed more
[51:17] philistines than he did when he was
[51:19] alive
[51:20] and brother branham said when those
[51:22] philistines before
[51:23] they captured him and took his eyes out
[51:26] when even the name of samson was
[51:28] mentioned they would quake
[51:30] and they would tremble
[51:34] and finally how about elijah
[51:38] and elisha
[51:42] elijah he had a paradigm shift
[51:45] taken up in a chariot right before
[51:48] elisha
[51:52] it was a paradigm shift for him because
[51:54] he he was told
[51:55] if you see that cloak you'll have the
[51:59] double portion
[52:00] and he had the double portion and he did
[52:03] exactly
[52:04] twice as many miracles miraculous sign
[52:08] as elijah had done and now we go back to
[52:12] luke 24.
[52:20] verse 2 and they found a stone
[52:25] rolled away from the sepulcher
[52:28] and they entered in and found not the
[52:30] body of the lord jesus
[52:49] and they entered in and found not the
[52:51] body of the lord jesus
[52:52] and it came to pass as they were much
[52:54] perplexed there about behold
[52:56] two men stood by them in shining
[52:58] garments
[53:03] and as they were afraid and bowed down
[53:06] their faces to the earth
[53:08] they said unto them now here's the two
[53:11] angels
[53:12] speaking to the women that are there at
[53:14] the tomb
[53:16] they had not been able to dress the body
[53:18] on friday
[53:19] because the sabbath was entering in so
[53:21] they had to wait
[53:22] until the beginning of the end of the
[53:26] sabbath
[53:27] and they entered in and the angel said
[53:31] to them
[53:32] why seek ye the living
[53:35] among the dead
[53:38] he is not here but has risen remember
[53:42] how he spake unto you when he was yet
[53:46] in galilee saying the son of man must be
[53:49] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[53:51] and be crucified and the third day rise
[53:53] again
[53:55] verse 8 says and they remembered
[53:59] his word
[54:02] i wonder how many times jesus had
[54:04] repeated
[54:05] those things to them while he was yet
[54:08] with them
[54:10] but they had spiritual amnesia
[54:15] [Music]
[54:20] and they returned from the sepulcher and
[54:22] told all these things
[54:29] throw all these things
[54:33] onto the eleven and them
[54:37] that were with them now we know who the
[54:40] eleven were right
[54:45] now was mary magdalene and joanna and
[54:47] mary the mother of james and other women
[54:49] that were with them which told these
[54:51] things unto
[54:53] the apostle
[54:56] verse 11 very astounding verse
[55:00] and their words seem to
[55:03] them as idol tales
[55:10] and they believe them not
[55:14] so how many times had the lord spoke to
[55:18] the apostles
[55:19] the women hear the two angels and they
[55:21] believe
[55:22] and they come back to the apostles
[55:26] and they don't believe
[55:31] then arose peter and ran unto the
[55:34] sepulcher
[55:36] and stooping down he beheld the linen
[55:37] clothes laid by himself and departed
[55:40] wondering himself
[55:41] at that which was come to pass now i'm
[55:44] sure
[55:44] peter is thinking well i don't know
[55:47] what's going on here
[55:52] but even if this is true
[55:57] even if he has risen from the dead
[56:00] he's not going to want to see my sorry
[56:03] face
[56:04] after what i did denied him three times
[56:08] and cursed
[56:09] that i even knew him and so
[56:13] he walks away wondering
[56:17] and behold two of them went that same
[56:21] day to a village called emmaus which was
[56:23] from jerusalem
[56:24] about three score furlong
[56:27] brother ram said it was about a six hour
[56:29] walk
[56:30] and they talked together of all these
[56:32] things which had happened
[56:36] and it came to pass that while they
[56:39] commune
[56:39] together and reason
[56:45] jesus himself drew near and went
[56:48] with them
[56:54] but their eyes were holding
[56:57] that they should not know him now this
[56:59] is my own thought
[57:01] the jesus that came and walked with them
[57:04] he was in a totally different form than
[57:07] he was
[57:08] just a few days before he was in his
[57:12] young body
[57:15] maybe
[57:24] excuse me i guess something caught in my
[57:25] throat so maybe
[57:27] all the gray hairs were gone maybe jesus
[57:30] was stooped over
[57:31] from bearing all the burdens that he had
[57:34] being a homeless man all that time
[57:36] and because of all the ministry and
[57:38] brother branham talked about
[57:40] the weakness that came upon him the same
[57:42] kind of weakness that came
[57:44] upon jesus and the bible said
[57:48] if all the things that jesus said and
[57:50] did recorded
[57:51] all the books in the world could not
[57:52] hold him
[57:54] so now jesus went with them
[57:58] but their eyes were holding they should
[57:59] not know him and he said unto them
[58:02] what manner of communication are these
[58:04] that you have one to another
[58:06] as you walk and are sad in other words
[58:08] he said what's this negative
[58:09] communication all about
[58:12] what's this bad attitude about
[58:17] and the one of them whose name was
[58:18] cleophas answering said unto him
[58:21] art thou only a stranger in jerusalem
[58:25] in other words hey pal did you just get
[58:27] here
[58:29] did you just arrive don't you know the
[58:32] things that have happened
[58:33] in jerusalem the last few days
[58:38] and jesus said unto them um
[58:43] what things
[58:47] so he's checking their revelation
[58:51] checking to find out what they know and
[58:54] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[58:55] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[58:57] indeed before
[58:58] before god and all the people and how
[59:01] the chief priests and our rulers
[59:02] delivered him to be condemned to death
[59:04] and have crucified him
[59:06] but
[59:09] now they're given their testimony
[59:13] but we trusted that it had been he which
[59:16] would have redeemed israel and beside
[59:18] all this
[59:19] today is the third day since these
[59:21] things were done
[59:23] and certain women also of our company
[59:27] made us astonish
[59:30] which were early at the sepulcher and
[59:32] when they found
[59:33] not his body they came saying
[59:36] that they had seen a vision of angels
[59:39] which said that he was alive
[59:43] and certain of them which were was went
[59:46] to the sepulcher
[59:49] and founded even so as the women
[59:52] had said but him they saw
[59:58] not
[1:00:09] now just try to imagine if you were
[1:00:12] simon and cleophus and the lord had to
[1:00:14] speak to you like this
[1:00:18] and he said unto them oh
[1:00:26] fools
[1:00:31] and slow of heart to believe all
[1:00:35] that the prophets have spoken
[1:00:39] do i get a bottle of water brother jack
[1:01:08] hmm
[1:01:19] excuse me
[1:01:24] he said ought not christ to have
[1:01:26] suffered these things
[1:01:27] and to enter into his glory now listen
[1:01:30] this is very powerful
[1:01:33] and beginning at moses and all
[1:01:36] al all the prophets remember this is a
[1:01:40] six-hour sermon
[1:01:42] he expounded unto them in all the
[1:01:45] scriptures
[1:01:46] concerning himself
[1:01:51] and as they drew nigh under the village
[1:01:53] whether they went and he made as though
[1:01:54] he would have gone further
[1:01:57] in other words he was saying
[1:02:00] see you guys bye-bye
[1:02:03] yeah nice knowing you i'm leaving
[1:02:07] but they constrained him brother ren
[1:02:10] said their character began the show and
[1:02:11] they constrained him
[1:02:13] and they said it's late come on in we've
[1:02:15] got to have fellowship with you we want
[1:02:17] to feed you
[1:02:19] so they wanted to feed jesus but what
[1:02:21] they didn't know was that jesus was not
[1:02:23] done feeding them
[1:02:25] amen amen
[1:02:29] and it came to pass and you sat at meat
[1:02:31] with them he took bread and blessed it
[1:02:33] and break it and gave
[1:02:34] to them and their eyes
[1:02:37] were open paradigm
[1:02:41] shift the man that they were walking
[1:02:45] with the man that they thought they knew
[1:02:46] was this young man
[1:02:49] all of a sudden their eyes were open and
[1:02:52] they said
[1:02:53] it's the lord amen and he vanished
[1:02:57] out of their sight that's right
[1:03:00] disappeared
[1:03:02] now try to imagine if you were simon or
[1:03:04] cleophus
[1:03:05] and the lord had to speak to you and
[1:03:07] said
[1:03:08] oh fools and slow of heart
[1:03:12] you know maybe you're temporal who do
[1:03:15] you think you
[1:03:16] are don't you know who i am
[1:03:19] i was with the lord i spent three plus
[1:03:22] years with him
[1:03:23] all right baby simon said to cleopatra
[1:03:26] you ever see this guy around
[1:03:28] in the meetings nope never did he ever
[1:03:31] said no i've never seen him either
[1:03:33] who's he think he is talking to us like
[1:03:35] that
[1:03:36] but listen and for six hours
[1:03:41] he expounded him
[1:03:46] and they said one to another
[1:03:50] did not our hearts burn within us while
[1:03:52] he talked with us by the way
[1:03:53] and while he opened to us the scripture
[1:03:56] and they rose up the same hour
[1:04:01] i don't believe they said well you know
[1:04:03] it's been a long day we've walked six
[1:04:05] hours
[1:04:06] maybe we ought to rest a while and maybe
[1:04:08] you know we'll head out tomorrow
[1:04:10] and and we'll tell the apostles what
[1:04:12] we've learned no
[1:04:13] they rose up the same hour
[1:04:18] and i don't believe it took them six
[1:04:20] hours to get back
[1:04:22] they were running now with a message
[1:04:27] they returned to jerusalem and they
[1:04:29] found the eleven
[1:04:30] gathered together and them that were
[1:04:34] with him
[1:04:35] and now here's a testimony to them
[1:04:37] saying the lord is risen
[1:04:40] indeed and hath appeared to simon and
[1:04:42] they told what things were done in the
[1:04:44] way
[1:04:45] and how he was known of them in the
[1:04:47] breaking of bread
[1:04:51] now buckle your seat belt we're coming
[1:04:53] down to a close now
[1:04:55] and as they thus spoke
[1:04:59] jesus himself stood in the midst of them
[1:05:02] and saith unto them peace
[1:05:06] be unto you
[1:05:10] here's their response but they were
[1:05:12] terrified and are frightened
[1:05:14] and supposing they had seen a spirit
[1:05:18] and he said unto them
[1:05:21] why are you troubled and why do thoughts
[1:05:23] arise in your heart
[1:05:25] behold my hands
[1:05:28] and my feet that it is i myself
[1:05:33] handle me
[1:05:37] and see for a spirit
[1:05:40] had not flesh and bones
[1:05:45] as you see me have he didn't say flesh
[1:05:48] and blood
[1:05:49] the blood had already been shed he said
[1:05:52] flesh
[1:05:53] and bone
[1:05:56] and when
[1:06:04] that's a good stick in my in my throat
[1:06:11] and as he had just spoken
[1:06:14] he showed them his hands and his feet in
[1:06:16] other words he said look
[1:06:17] right here that's where they nailed me
[1:06:20] and he lifted up his garment he said
[1:06:21] right there
[1:06:22] see down there that that's where they
[1:06:23] nailed my feet
[1:06:25] so here he is in another form
[1:06:29] appearing unto them after the women
[1:06:32] after simon and cleophus had testified
[1:06:35] unto them
[1:06:37] and this is one of the most amazing
[1:06:40] verses
[1:06:42] in the bible and
[1:06:45] while they yet believed
[1:06:49] not what
[1:06:53] you mean jesus is standing right in
[1:06:55] front of them
[1:06:56] showing them his hands showing them his
[1:06:59] feet
[1:07:00] and while they believed not
[1:07:03] for joy and wondered he said have you
[1:07:07] hear any meat
[1:07:08] and he gave them a piece of broiled fish
[1:07:10] and a honeycomb
[1:07:11] and he took it and did it before them
[1:07:13] probably whoever got the
[1:07:14] the bread and and and the honey and the
[1:07:17] meat they probably didn't want to get
[1:07:18] too
[1:07:19] maybe they just lobbed it to them still
[1:07:22] afraid what's going on here
[1:07:24] why they are in the middle of a radical
[1:07:28] paradigm shift a supernatural
[1:07:32] paradigm shift the greatest supernatural
[1:07:35] paradigm shift
[1:07:36] that had ever taken place is the lord
[1:07:39] jesus christ
[1:07:40] risen from the dead in his body with his
[1:07:44] apostles
[1:07:52] and he said unto them these are the
[1:07:53] words i spoke unto you while i was yet
[1:07:55] with
[1:07:56] you that all things must
[1:07:59] be fulfilled which were
[1:08:02] written in the law of moses and to the
[1:08:05] prophets
[1:08:06] and in the psalms concerning me
[1:08:11] now jesus could have said
[1:08:15] go get a blind man or go get a death man
[1:08:18] or go get a leper or go get a bowl of
[1:08:21] water and i'll turn it into wine
[1:08:24] he could have done all those things
[1:08:27] but he had done them for three plus
[1:08:29] years and brother branham said all he
[1:08:31] had to show for it
[1:08:35] was a group of mechanic filled cowards
[1:08:46] before the paradigm shift
[1:08:49] here they were wondering terrified
[1:08:53] a frightened even the lord jesus christ
[1:08:56] appearing right in front of them
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:00] after all they had heard
[1:09:04] in the ministry and after all these
[1:09:07] things start coming back to them
[1:09:09] they're still terrified and the bible
[1:09:12] says
[1:09:14] then open he their understanding
[1:09:18] that they might understand the
[1:09:20] scriptures
[1:09:21] you see folks unless the lord
[1:09:24] opens your eyes to this supernatural
[1:09:28] message
[1:09:29] it will just be intellectual knowledge
[1:09:33] and thinking and you think you
[1:09:35] understand it
[1:09:37] and you think you know it but there
[1:09:39] comes a time
[1:09:40] in your life as a true believer when you
[1:09:43] will know
[1:09:44] that you know that you know that you
[1:09:48] know that you know
[1:09:50] i'll never forget i had come
[1:09:54] out of the religious merry-go-round from
[1:09:56] catholic
[1:09:57] to baptist assembly of god ptl bible
[1:10:01] school upc
[1:10:04] had all this religious leaven inside of
[1:10:06] me
[1:10:08] and i'm reading and studying
[1:10:11] the message and one day
[1:10:15] i'm listening i'm struggling with the
[1:10:17] serpent scene
[1:10:19] struggling with a prophet and brother
[1:10:23] branham
[1:10:24] is speaking to a woman he said now
[1:10:27] sister
[1:10:28] i don't know you and you don't know me
[1:10:32] but there is one here that does know you
[1:10:34] and he does know me
[1:10:37] he said now when he listen
[1:10:41] brother braham is saying when he and his
[1:10:45] spirit
[1:10:46] comes in me
[1:10:49] and my spirit goes away
[1:10:54] and he gives me
[1:10:57] a temporarily resurrection
[1:11:00] by my spirit and he
[1:11:06] wants to use my body
[1:11:11] and i'm so happy to loan it to him
[1:11:15] anything he can get out of it and it was
[1:11:18] then friends i
[1:11:19] understood a son of man
[1:11:23] revealing the son of man let's stand to
[1:11:26] our feet
[1:11:40] father the greatness
[1:11:46] and the magnitude and the power of
[1:11:49] your word cannot be adequately expressed
[1:11:54] through a human vessel but we love you
[1:11:58] we believe you with all of our heart
[1:12:00] we've had our eyes open
[1:12:02] as simon and cleopas had their eyes open
[1:12:05] as the apostles had their eyes open to a
[1:12:09] wonderful
[1:12:10] supernatural mystical world as jesus was
[1:12:13] a mystic
[1:12:14] the people didn't understand him
[1:12:18] and so the people don't understand your
[1:12:20] bride
[1:12:21] where oddballs were strange
[1:12:24] if they really knew what we believe
[1:12:27] they'd probably try to throw us in jail
[1:12:31] or even worse in an insane asylum
[1:12:34] but father i thank you for your word and
[1:12:37] how you have unveiled it to us
[1:12:39] i thank you for each believer present
[1:12:41] here tonight
[1:12:42] and i pray that you would continue
[1:12:46] their journey in this word and i pray
[1:12:49] that you would give them
[1:12:50] a passion a deeper understanding
[1:12:56] and a knowledge of who they are
[1:12:59] and and understanding
[1:13:03] of what you have done in our lives
[1:13:06] and what you have prepared for us
[1:13:08] throughout all of eternity
[1:13:10] and lord let us count the price of our
[1:13:13] salvation
[1:13:15] count the price of our revelation
[1:13:19] i want to ask you friends
[1:13:22] if you would testify
[1:13:28] tonight that you have had
[1:13:33] that great paradigm shift in your life
[1:13:36] and that god has changed you from what
[1:13:38] you were
[1:13:40] to what you are and this is an ongoing
[1:13:44] evolution like the caterpillar that goes
[1:13:47] into the cocoon
[1:13:48] and comes out the beautiful butterfly so
[1:13:51] we are lord
[1:13:52] we're coming out we're coming out as
[1:13:55] beautiful creatures
[1:13:56] with a wedding garment that is snow
[1:13:58] white

[1:17:42] tonight
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:47] man just uh
[1:17:50] the the thought of paradigm shift and
[1:17:54] just a number of examples there that
[1:17:55] brother ernie gave us
[1:17:58] and i just love the definition it's a a
[1:18:02] radical
[1:18:03] change of thought brought about
[1:18:07] by an unusual event or through keen
[1:18:10] insight and um you know just a real
[1:18:14] or really um i mean you think about what
[1:18:16] the brothers on the road to emmaus went
[1:18:18] through and
[1:18:19] that was a tremendous event to see the
[1:18:21] lord jesus risen
[1:18:22] from the dead and you know how it just
[1:18:24] it shifted everybody's thinking
[1:18:27] and i uh i appreciate that but the story
[1:18:29] he started off with
[1:18:31] of uh the people being on the subway and
[1:18:34] uh how they were just criticizing a man
[1:18:37] for how his children were acting on the
[1:18:39] subway but
[1:18:41] once he shared his story
[1:18:44] to share this testimony everybody there
[1:18:47] that heard it
[1:18:48] went through a paradigm shift and i tell
[1:18:50] you anytime anybody truly hears the
[1:18:52] gospel of the lord jesus
[1:18:54] christ when they hear the word of god
[1:18:55] and uh we've heard uh
[1:18:58] how god has sent uh something a
[1:19:00] revelation through a prophet
[1:19:02] that caused a paradigm shift for us too
[1:19:05] you know that's why we
[1:19:06] could never be satisfied in
[1:19:07] denominations ever again
[1:19:09] because we have experienced a paradigm
[1:19:13] shift a radical change
[1:19:16] we thank god for it we certainly thank
[1:19:18] god for it
[1:19:19] amen let's give the lord another hand to
[1:19:21] praise for the word of god tonight
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:23] [Applause]
[1:19:26] hallelujah man let's just bow in a word
[1:19:29] of prayer
[1:19:30] uh father we just want to appreciate
[1:19:34] you taking us through this paradigm
[1:19:37] shift
[1:19:39] lord the testimonies of the brothers on
[1:19:42] the road to emmaus
[1:19:43] and god just uh all the other disciples
[1:19:47] that
[1:19:47] that were missing it they they
[1:19:49] misunderstood they didn't catch it
[1:19:52] but god uh after um
[1:19:55] but we have the opportunity to kind of
[1:19:56] read these things and
[1:19:58] what we can see a little bit more in
[1:20:00] scripture but
[1:20:01] i pray that in our day that we don't
[1:20:03] miss a man
[1:20:05] what you're doing for us and the
[1:20:07] revealing of the word of god
[1:20:09] how it should have triggered a paradigm
[1:20:11] shift in so many
[1:20:13] uh god we can even we can even look
[1:20:16] lives of some of the people lord and uh
[1:20:19] god just little events that have
[1:20:21] happened here and there that's caused
[1:20:23] them to shift their thinking
[1:20:25] lord i just believe that the holy spirit
[1:20:27] is able to restore all things and
[1:20:29] and give them another paradigm shift i
[1:20:32] pray o god that you would just do
[1:20:33] lord only what your word says that you
[1:20:37] can do and
[1:20:38] we trust god that you would just get all
[1:20:40] the glory and all the god thank you for
[1:20:41] our brother
[1:20:42] uh laboring to bring this thought here
[1:20:45] tonight and
[1:20:46] we know the enemy was fighting him but
[1:20:48] god we thank you that he has the victory
[1:20:50] and acts that you just completely touch
[1:20:52] him lord and
[1:20:54] uh father uh the devil doesn't like when
[1:20:56] this word goes forth even tonight
[1:20:58] we don't know who was listening those
[1:21:01] online and those that are inside the
[1:21:03] church still going through paradigm
[1:21:05] shifts the devil wants to fight that but
[1:21:07] he can't stop it
[1:21:09] he didn't start it so he can't stop it
[1:21:11] so lord i pray
[1:21:12] that the word would reach its
[1:21:14] destination tonight
[1:21:16] and god that people would be able to
[1:21:18] hear what the holy spirit was speaking
[1:21:21] uh to them and god that a change would
[1:21:24] take place
[1:21:24] in their hearts and in their lives god
[1:21:26] as we prepare to leave this place
[1:21:28] but not your presence may we go
[1:21:29] fellowshipping on the word of god and
[1:21:32] may you come
[1:21:33] as the stranger in luke 24 may you come
[1:21:37] amongst us
[1:21:37] again father and and speak to us once
[1:21:40] again even as we're traveling home
[1:21:42] uh prepare our hearts lord for another
[1:21:44] day on tomorrow and
[1:21:46] and all the different events that'll be
[1:21:47] coming over the next few days and as we
[1:21:49] come back on sunday morning
[1:21:51] speak once more to us god we're careful
[1:21:54] to give you all the honor
[1:21:55] the glory and the praise is in jesus
[1:21:58] christ's name that we pray
[1:22:00] amen and amen hallelujah
