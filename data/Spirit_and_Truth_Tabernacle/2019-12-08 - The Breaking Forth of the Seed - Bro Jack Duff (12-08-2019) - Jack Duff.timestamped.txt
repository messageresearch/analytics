[50:13] the first being Genesis chapter 1 a man
[50:17] Genesis chapter 1 and your brother else
[50:26] was just gonna do a little interpreting
[50:27] for a man our brothers and brother and
[50:30] sister from under her side I didn't want
[50:32] to say this I appreciate last night I
[50:35] got a telephone call they they wanted to
[50:40] come to church so what they did was they
[50:43] drove up here to the church to find out
[50:46] where it was so that they'll know where
[50:50] to go in the morning and and you know I
[50:55] heard from one of the relatives that
[50:56] they've already scoped it out they know
[51:00] exactly where it is so they'll be ready
[51:01] amen in the morning and and and and I
[51:04] appreciate that you know
[51:06] amen though those are people that come
[51:07] that want to get something from God and
[51:10] man and I pray that God will speak to
[51:13] them they may even on today I remember a
[51:17] man a brother share with me a service
[51:19] just recently the there was a brother
[51:23] that came to church he wanted to hear
[51:25] from God so bad but they didn't speak
[51:28] his language
[51:29] and so what God did was he said Lord let
[51:33] me pray the prayer say Lord let me hear
[51:35] the preacher today amen so in song
[51:38] service he heard nothing but when the
[51:40] preacher picked up the mic and started
[51:43] speaking the brother stood through the
[51:46] whole service I heard everything the
[51:48] preacher said
[51:50] everything the preacher said and soon as
[51:53] a preacher said a man okay we're back to
[51:55] Amen I wouldn't say went back to normal
[51:58] because that's not normal right but it
[52:01] went back to the way it was but but he
[52:02] heard everything the preacher said in
[52:04] his language
[52:05] see that's Pentecost that's the original
[52:09] Pentecost
[52:10] man they heard in their own language and
[52:13] and why can't we expect that right he is
[52:17] the same it's not I don't I don't even
[52:20] want to use words if he is the same no
[52:22] he is the same yesterday that damn
[52:25] forever
[52:26] so if he did it then he will do it again
[52:28] today we gotta come on expectation like
[52:32] that
[52:33] hallelujah hey man he's able he's a
[52:37] breeze able so Church I just come under
[52:40] expectation believe in God a man to do
[52:43] these things and so we just if you all
[52:46] here brother Josue a man interpreting
[52:49] that's why he's doing that but if you
[52:51] hear him stop then you already know that
[52:55] something changed hallelujah go already
[53:00] go when the brothers say no I got it I
[53:02] hear everything
[53:04] Amen god is good that's that's we are on
[53:06] the expectation turn with me to Genesis
[53:09] chapter 1 the man just verse 11 is where
[53:13] we will start from praise the Lord just
[53:18] a couple of scriptures here it says this
[53:22] and God said let the earth bring forth
[53:28] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[53:34] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[53:37] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[53:43] and it was so and the earth brought
[53:47] forth grass and herb yielding seed after
[53:53] his kind and the tree yielding fruit
[53:56] whose seed was in itself
[53:59] after his kind and God saw that it was
[54:03] good and the evening and the morning
[54:05] were the third day a man let's also turn
[54:10] to a passage in Luke chapter 8 I met
[54:15] Luke chapter 8 praise the Lord and I'll
[54:23] just start here verse 5 a man says a
[54:30] sore went out to sow his seed as he
[54:35] sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[54:40] was trodden down the fowls of the air
[54:43] devoured it
[54:45] and some fell upon a rock and as soon as
[54:52] it was sprung up it was the way now it
[54:55] did grow a man indeed grow but and and
[55:02] notice what its prompt the scriptures
[55:03] say as soon as it was sprung up it
[55:05] withered away it's me man a man a man a
[55:08] man because it lacked moisture all right
[55:13] a man and some fell among thorns and the
[55:18] thorns print with that means this also
[55:20] did grow right because thorns sprung up
[55:25] with it
[55:27] amen all right and choked it hallelujah
[55:32] and then verse 8 says an other fell on
[55:35] good ground and if I used a term that
[55:40] the Prophet use pre-prepared ground
[55:44] right others fell on good ground and
[55:47] sprang up and bear fruit a hundredfold
[55:50] and when he had said these things he
[55:53] cried he that hath ears to hear let him
[55:57] hear
[55:58] let's pray dear God we thank you for
[56:02] your word that we have read we trust of
[56:07] God that the Holy Ghost would take
[56:08] control
[56:10] for the things that we would speak even
[56:12] now Lord I know it's not by chance about
[56:15] accident that you Lord prepare certain
[56:19] sermons for certain days you know
[56:21] exactly who would be in the midst and
[56:23] you know who needs what you are a great
[56:26] God a mighty God and also God so father
[56:29] we pray that you would speak from heaven
[56:31] through your word that God it would make
[56:35] the difference in our lives in our
[56:37] hearts today we ask this in the mighty
[56:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ a man a
[56:45] man a man you can be seated in the
[56:47] presence of the Lord praise the Lord
[57:05] amen we want to take a subject today
[57:10] breaking forth of the seat a man that
[57:14] breaking forth or we could use a term
[57:17] awakening a man of the seat praise God
[57:22] a man just bare with me got a lot of
[57:27] notes and just want to see which way the
[57:29] Lord would just kind of take us today
[57:31] but uh let's uh let's start with a quote
[57:34] here out of the sermon the unchangeable
[57:37] God this is on the back sheet of that
[57:39] paper that I gave you the unchangeable
[57:41] God and he makes us the Prophet makes a
[57:44] statement here says I can go on record
[57:47] for this tonight if any people will take
[57:52] the right mental attitude towards any
[57:57] divine promise that God ever made maybe
[58:01] I forgot to give you that one
[58:03] here's a date 60 - 0 3 - 6 60 - 0 3 - 6
[58:10] and the paragraph is 8 - 7 amen he says
[58:15] if if any people will take the right
[58:18] mental attitude towards any divine
[58:22] promise that God ever made and claim it
[58:25] for yours I love this a man take the
[58:29] right attitude and then claim it for
[58:31] yours
[58:31] right he says he will God will bring it
[58:36] to pass he says if you'll take the right
[58:39] attitude towards it knowing that if God
[58:42] said so the promise is yours and look at
[58:47] this it's your personal property the
[58:52] promise becomes your personal property
[58:56] God gave it to me right if he didn't
[59:00] give it to anybody else he gave it to me
[59:02] this is my personal property brother
[59:06] when something becomes yours you don't
[59:07] just let anybody just take it come on
[59:11] somebody you'll just let people just do
[59:13] whatever they want to do that that's
[59:14] that's mine that's my car this is my
[59:19] house
[59:20] right hallelujah this is mine and and I
[59:23] don't want you handling what's mine any
[59:25] kind of way glory to God you can handle
[59:28] yours whatever way you want to handle it
[59:30] but if it belongs to me
[59:33] take care of it oh yeah and this is my
[59:37] promise God made it to me and if you
[59:41] don't believe it that's up to you but
[59:44] I'm gonna believe what God gave me
[59:46] praise God I'm not looking at the
[59:49] problem I'm looking at the promise
[59:52] hey glory to God he-man he-man many many
[1:00:03] men and we got to have the right
[1:00:05] attitude this is what the Prophet is
[1:00:07] trying to get to us right so stay with
[1:00:09] me here as we go a little further a man
[1:00:11] he says it's your personal property the
[1:00:15] very minute you receive it that way
[1:00:19] and that when when you get personal
[1:00:22] property of a promise of God the Prophet
[1:00:26] says did it has to come to pass has to
[1:00:31] come to pass this see gonna break for us
[1:00:37] at some point in time oh my God my God
[1:00:41] amen it says for jesus said the word is
[1:00:46] a seed that are sower sowed and I see if
[1:00:51] it's a charm Atty see and it goes into
[1:00:55] the ground then that see
[1:00:57] under the right conditions I like this
[1:01:00] the seed gotta be under the right
[1:01:02] conditions of Sun and moisture you gotta
[1:01:08] have both now they may not just all
[1:01:10] moisture you'll drown it but if you get
[1:01:12] some Sun right there just a mint and
[1:01:14] both of them working together then that
[1:01:16] seagull come forth
[1:01:17] somehow it's gonna come forward you
[1:01:21] might have to wait a little bit but that
[1:01:22] seed will come forth watch this then he
[1:01:27] says the c-4 under the right conditions
[1:01:29] of the Sun and moisture will bring forth
[1:01:32] the life that's in the seed and it says
[1:01:35] and so is the Word of God if a person
[1:01:38] can take that word and place it in their
[1:01:41] heart and give it the right sunshine the
[1:01:46] right temperature not su in but s o is
[1:01:52] hey man how do you get the s o in the
[1:01:56] shine of your seeds by reading its words
[1:01:59] by listening to the tapes right that's
[1:02:02] how you get the s so in the shine on
[1:02:04] that seat you must give it moisture and
[1:02:07] sunshine all right listen
[1:02:10] he says in the right temperature faith
[1:02:12] in there that seed and promise will live
[1:02:15] to you just like it did at the beginning
[1:02:18] to the one it was given to because it's
[1:02:21] God's Word and he is the same yesterday
[1:02:23] today and forever he cannot fail now I
[1:02:26] could stop right there in that quote and
[1:02:28] just kind of go forward in our thought
[1:02:30] for the day but I just felt in my spirit
[1:02:32] to go a little further in the quote the
[1:02:34] next portion of this quote actually a
[1:02:37] man I wouldn't say ties into the thought
[1:02:40] that I'm trying to bring to you today
[1:02:41] but nevertheless I think it's something
[1:02:43] that God wants you to hear all right and
[1:02:46] it goes on he says now the thing is with
[1:02:50] the people is the way God appears that's
[1:02:54] where the problem come it's the way God
[1:02:57] appears many times we want to make
[1:03:03] an idol out of God we ask God to do
[1:03:08] something and then he must do it just
[1:03:13] the way that we ask it I see that that's
[1:03:17] that's that that you know we've we
[1:03:18] talked to you know be specific in the
[1:03:21] way that we pray and things of that
[1:03:22] nature but we got it we got it we got to
[1:03:24] understand that God is still God he does
[1:03:27] whatever he wants to however he wants to
[1:03:30] so when you pray you have to bring that
[1:03:32] leg the Lord this is whatever you want
[1:03:34] to do I my assets but how do you want to
[1:03:36] do it i'ma let you do it come on we
[1:03:40] can't we can't limit him because when we
[1:03:43] limit him we make an idol out of him I
[1:03:49] want to release you to do big things a
[1:03:52] man I want to release you to do great
[1:03:55] things this is the neat car look father
[1:03:58] however you gonna meet it that's the way
[1:04:00] you meet it but this is the neat Oh God
[1:04:04] glory amen if I need a million that
[1:04:08] don't matter how God get the million
[1:04:09] here if I need two million no matter how
[1:04:12] God get the two million here Amen Lord I
[1:04:16] just need millions hallelujah all right
[1:04:21] all right chemic chemical for he says
[1:04:23] many times we want to make an eye light
[1:04:25] of God we ask God to do something and
[1:04:27] then he must do it just the way that we
[1:04:29] ask it or we'll say he never answered
[1:04:32] when we do that
[1:04:34] we weaken our faith in God amen and we
[1:04:38] weaken our testimony when we do not take
[1:04:42] him at its word it says God sometimes
[1:04:49] answers
[1:04:51] God most of the time answers no no God
[1:04:58] always answers oh I love that he may not
[1:05:05] come when you wound him but he's always
[1:05:07] on time
[1:05:09] always answers and sometimes you know if
[1:05:14] the answer may not come in the way that
[1:05:16] you you know you thought it was coming
[1:05:17] or when it get that might come in a way
[1:05:19] that you didn't expect and when I was
[1:05:21] expecting this but no no everything is
[1:05:23] working together for good to them that
[1:05:25] love God to them who are the called
[1:05:26] according to his purpose right
[1:05:28] a man so let's not question God let's
[1:05:30] learn to praise God and just thank God
[1:05:32] and glorify God and exalt God a man a
[1:05:37] man a man is more where that came from
[1:05:39] but you have to give him some praise
[1:05:42] glory glory glory glory hallelujah says
[1:05:47] God always answers no one never asked
[1:05:51] jesus said ask and you shall receive
[1:05:53] seek and ye shall find every one that
[1:05:58] asks will receive every one that feasts
[1:06:05] shall find every one that knocks it will
[1:06:09] be opened to him that's the only way
[1:06:12] that I found
[1:06:12] I've always found it that I can get
[1:06:14] anything from God has take him at his
[1:06:16] word and believe it the way he sends it
[1:06:20] believing the way he says that now if we
[1:06:22] do not take it just the way that we
[1:06:26] think it is we've built God as an idol
[1:06:28] he's got to answer just according to our
[1:06:31] ways or well it's just no good a man he
[1:06:35] didn't answers God answers in many ways
[1:06:37] he answers in peculiar ways times and
[1:06:41] everything is odd so we don't want to
[1:06:44] limit God amen when we're expecting God
[1:06:46] to do something for us now I want to go
[1:06:48] forward in this thought we're talking
[1:06:50] about the brick and fourth of the see a
[1:06:52] man we looked here in Genesis and it was
[1:06:56] the third day of creation and God is
[1:06:59] commanding a man here in the scripture
[1:07:03] he says
[1:07:06] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[1:07:09] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:07:11] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:07:13] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:07:17] so we read that in Genesis a warning 11
[1:07:21] and and and what we're what we're
[1:07:23] gaining from here
[1:07:24] Amen there's a law that God has
[1:07:26] established in scripture that when it
[1:07:29] when a seed is planted a man is put in
[1:07:32] the right conditions that see has a law
[1:07:35] in it that it must bring forth at this
[1:07:37] kind must if you put apple seed in the
[1:07:44] ground you are not to expect oranges if
[1:07:50] you see oranges you should question
[1:07:51] something what what happened here right
[1:07:54] because I know I placed an apple seed in
[1:07:58] the ground right and an apple seed must
[1:08:01] it has a law in it that it must produce
[1:08:03] apples Oh hallelujah amen the thing
[1:08:08] about the seed is that it has what we
[1:08:09] call perpetual life in it Oh glory to
[1:08:13] God amen
[1:08:15] I'm talking about a natural a man fruits
[1:08:18] eat has perpetual life in it I was
[1:08:22] listening to a quote where brother
[1:08:23] Branham was was even talked about as
[1:08:25] we're going into this this winter season
[1:08:27] amen this winter time you know we go
[1:08:30] through springtime and things are kind
[1:08:33] of coming forth there they're there
[1:08:34] they're growing in there
[1:08:36] everything is like renewed and spring
[1:08:38] but then and someone begins to kind of
[1:08:41] die a little bit and fall by the time
[1:08:44] fall hit it can get them leaves on it
[1:08:46] and you know it's getting ready to go
[1:08:48] soon as the leaves change but you know
[1:08:49] that's the most beautiful time then the
[1:08:52] flower a man is experiencing it with it
[1:08:54] when it reaches its fall season
[1:08:57] some are saying seasons like that
[1:09:01] hallelujah amen sometimes we like man
[1:09:04] this is falling off and that's falling
[1:09:06] off and I'm going through it's enough
[1:09:07] that's the most beautiful time of your
[1:09:09] life it's when you're in the fall season
[1:09:12] and I want you to understand something
[1:09:15] about this perpetual life that senousy
[1:09:17] in the fall season before it goes into
[1:09:21] winter there is a seed inside the plant
[1:09:24] that drops back into the earth
[1:09:27] hallelujah and this is why a flower when
[1:09:30] it dies can I tell you this it's not a
[1:09:32] different flower coming up it's the same
[1:09:36] flower coming back up because there was
[1:09:39] a seed inside the flower that dropped
[1:09:43] before winter and that she women to the
[1:09:48] earth and that she had a low inside of
[1:09:51] it that it had to stop this time so if
[1:09:54] it went down
[1:09:56] yellow is coming back up yellow if they
[1:09:58] went down purple is coming back up
[1:10:00] purple there's a perpetual light in the
[1:10:05] seed oh my my my my in the seed I'm
[1:10:12] telling you that so there's some people
[1:10:14] that's gone through winter time in their
[1:10:16] life right now don't you get discouraged
[1:10:20] because you see winter amen if there's a
[1:10:24] seed before they went to winter season
[1:10:28] something drop and whatever drop has got
[1:10:32] to come back up it may take some time
[1:10:36] they may have to make it through winter
[1:10:38] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[1:10:44] Wainscott shall come in the morning that
[1:10:49] sea will produce out his own kind
[1:10:52] yet you may have your winter but you
[1:10:54] gotta come for if God put a law like
[1:10:59] that in the natural see what do you
[1:11:01] think he did with himself come on since
[1:11:07] I've never lost one all that the
[1:11:10] father's giving me will come I've never
[1:11:14] lost one it may look like wintertime
[1:11:18] hallelujah but there's a seat there and
[1:11:21] that see must bring forth after sky
[1:11:28] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:36] whew to plant an apple tree I love the
[1:11:41] way the Prophet puts it he says every
[1:11:43] Apple that will ever come from that tree
[1:11:49] was actually inside the seed
[1:11:52] if the tree produces 1 million apples in
[1:11:57] its lifetime the all of that was inside
[1:12:01] the little seed oh yes I understand the
[1:12:07] potential that's just in in the seed I'm
[1:12:11] talking about something so small when
[1:12:14] you when you look at a big apple tree or
[1:12:16] whatever type of tree you're like well
[1:12:18] my this huge tree amen all of that was
[1:12:21] inside of a seed all that happiness that
[1:12:24] the see was placed in the right
[1:12:26] conditions and once this place with the
[1:12:30] right conditions once it got su in and
[1:12:32] some moisture it just did what it was
[1:12:35] supposed to do and when we give the sons
[1:12:38] of God and the daughters of God in the
[1:12:41] right condition then they are gonna do
[1:12:43] what they're supposed to can I tell you
[1:12:46] something we're not waiting for power to
[1:12:49] come the powers in the sea we're just
[1:12:55] trying to get it in the right condition
[1:12:57] praise God when they were at the upper
[1:13:00] room they were in the right condition
[1:13:07] get a little water get a little air so
[1:13:10] in on this we'll see this thing
[1:13:14] producing and do the things that God
[1:13:17] intended for it to do you know what this
[1:13:23] is to me this is this is deeper than
[1:13:25] what I can even present deeper than what
[1:13:29] I can present the gesture the the the
[1:13:32] how great God is and how you can find
[1:13:36] them it's something so small a seed and
[1:13:40] that seed is that's that's a natural
[1:13:42] type in something spiritual if God put
[1:13:45] it in a apple tree to produce after sky
[1:13:48] nor a mango tree to produce after scan
[1:13:50] or orange tree a grapefruit tree amen
[1:13:53] the banana tree it's all in is that the
[1:13:56] seed was in itself it has
[1:13:57] except this cameras got along if God did
[1:13:59] all of that for a natural see what's
[1:14:02] what you're thinking about a
[1:14:02] predestinated see it's got to produce
[1:14:07] I've just kind of what is this kind God
[1:14:09] is it's kind if a banana tree producer
[1:14:13] produces bananas and an Apple produces
[1:14:16] apple and an orange produces oldest God
[1:14:18] will produce God because that's what was
[1:14:24] in the seed every attribute that was in
[1:14:28] God it's inside to see all we have to do
[1:14:33] is put in the right conditions watch it
[1:14:34] produce because the law is in the seat
[1:14:37] oh come on church the law is inside the
[1:14:42] seat hey it's the law that's exactly
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:53] it's la lai lai lai lai praise God it's
[1:14:59] your sin to see this you can see as I
[1:15:02] wouldn't tell anybody when you get these
[1:15:04] things you know you you you realize a
[1:15:07] man that uh that nothing is lacking
[1:15:10] nothing is lacking not one thing is
[1:15:13] lacking oh we got only thing if there's
[1:15:16] anything lacking it's patience all we
[1:15:20] got to do is wait on God there's
[1:15:21] something there there's I mean this word
[1:15:24] seed that we have been given it's gonna
[1:15:26] produce exactly what God says gonna
[1:15:28] produce don't matter how long it take it
[1:15:31] will come forth let me just go on a
[1:15:33] little further here a man just give you
[1:15:37] a few a few uh statements here now
[1:15:40] remember a fruit seed or whatever
[1:15:44] there's even on a plant the plant
[1:15:46] carries a seat and and when that plant
[1:15:49] drops at at winter time that see drops
[1:15:52] in the ground and and even though it
[1:15:54] looked like the plant withered away
[1:15:55] during winter because the seed drop it
[1:15:59] causes the same flower you get that it's
[1:16:02] not a different flower it is the same
[1:16:05] flower and if I can just put it this way
[1:16:07] instance
[1:16:08] same flower at a different stage but
[1:16:14] it's the same flower in the springtime
[1:16:16] the same flower came back up it was a
[1:16:19] different flower this is not new growth
[1:16:21] this is the same thing growing all over
[1:16:23] again because the see that dropped back
[1:16:28] inside the earth that seeds what makes
[1:16:31] it the same flower a it's not a
[1:16:34] replacement a man it's a resurrection of
[1:16:39] the same exact flower and they go
[1:16:42] through season after season after season
[1:16:44] a mint doing the exact same thing
[1:16:46] because it has perpetual life in it but
[1:16:49] we're not talking about just perpetual
[1:16:51] like we talk about eternal life in the
[1:16:54] seed of God is eternal all right let's
[1:16:57] go on a little a little further here so
[1:16:59] brother Branham teaches us something it
[1:17:00] says if we plant a seed
[1:17:02] amen in order for it to grow we must
[1:17:06] commit it to the earth right because it
[1:17:09] will never grow if you dig it up and the
[1:17:12] way you dig up your seats hallelujah is
[1:17:15] with your doubts glory to God
[1:17:19] they made brother Branham say committed
[1:17:20] to God and leave it here the best soul
[1:17:25] you can never plant a seed in is God's
[1:17:28] oil do you know it's gonna grow
[1:17:30] hallelujah but he said committed to God
[1:17:33] and leave it there don't go out the next
[1:17:36] day wonder win this thing I'll come up
[1:17:39] Oh amen don't get don't get discourage
[1:17:42] because man I ain't seen I planning it
[1:17:44] not now now here so here so here's the
[1:17:46] thing that you can have confidence in
[1:17:48] did you plan it did you do the work to
[1:17:51] get it in the earth do you know that you
[1:17:54] planted the seed where to see it itself
[1:17:57] got a low inside of it it's got to come
[1:17:59] for all it needs is some sunlight amen
[1:18:03] it some moisture and it will come first
[1:18:06] so committed to God you want to know how
[1:18:10] you water your seat just with your
[1:18:12] praises
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:15] Amen when it's gonna seem like let's get
[1:18:17] a little dry when your life seems like
[1:18:21] it's getting a little dry I'll forgot
[1:18:23] some grace that's how you get the
[1:18:28] moisture around the seeds glory to God
[1:18:32] he says committed to God and leave it
[1:18:35] there he says every time you dig it up
[1:18:38] it delays it another day and not only
[1:18:42] says every time you look at your
[1:18:44] symptoms it delays you to delays you too
[1:18:49] in your healing so I'm not looking at
[1:18:53] symptoms I'm looking at my seat I know
[1:18:56] what I planted if I planted it I know
[1:19:04] what to expect
[1:19:05] glory to God he says he says Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] seeds of the Bible cannot grow in the
[1:19:14] atmosphere of wisdom can I say that
[1:19:17] again the Prophet says Holy Ghost seeds
[1:19:20] of the Bible cannot grow in the
[1:19:23] atmosphere of wisdom that's in a message
[1:19:27] wisdom versus space just little
[1:19:28] statement said I'm picking up here and
[1:19:29] there we were talking about the seeds
[1:19:31] amen the other thing he says as though
[1:19:33] the word can't grow in denomination now
[1:19:35] let me just read this as well this is
[1:19:38] coming from the message the seed shall
[1:19:41] not be heir with us with the show
[1:19:44] Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:50] the man the sea shall not be here with
[1:19:52] the show the Prophet says this he says
[1:19:54] but now we're standing at the time of
[1:19:59] the seat we're standing at the time of
[1:20:01] the seat now the seat will hold what
[1:20:07] support cooperate with the seat holding
[1:20:09] it it was set there for that purpose to
[1:20:13] hold it because as the Sun comes up in
[1:20:16] the early spring upon the wheat watch
[1:20:19] the whole nature through the season roll
[1:20:22] through the day roll everything rolled
[1:20:24] just perfectly right with God
[1:20:26] now when that warm Sun begins to shine
[1:20:29] upon the seat it brings forth this is
[1:20:32] why we're preaching the breaking
[1:20:33] breaking forth of the seat when that
[1:20:36] warm Sun begins to shine upon the seed
[1:20:41] it breaks forth but the world has to be
[1:20:45] in a certain position to make that seed
[1:20:48] break forth out of the dirt and I love
[1:20:52] this the world has to be in a certain
[1:20:54] position to make that seed break forth
[1:20:57] out of the dirt it has to come around
[1:20:59] this away and get in a certain position
[1:21:02] to make that seat come forth it had to
[1:21:06] come that way to get it out get it out
[1:21:08] of upon the Dark Age
[1:21:10] now you know and I'm looking at that
[1:21:13] from both the natural as well as
[1:21:14] spiritual we know in order for a seed
[1:21:17] that come forth from the natural it
[1:21:18] hasn't been a certain position Amen a
[1:21:22] certain position also has to have a
[1:21:24] certain condition with with it has to
[1:21:26] have certain amount of water a certain
[1:21:28] amount of moisture so the condition has
[1:21:30] to be right and the position has to be
[1:21:33] right hallelujah before that sea would
[1:21:37] actually break forth before you'll see
[1:21:39] what you planted it has to be in the
[1:21:41] right condition and in the right
[1:21:43] position and spiritually I say there are
[1:21:46] some seed of God that must break forth
[1:21:49] hallelujah you just can't keep sitting
[1:21:52] on God at some point in time if you were
[1:21:56] son of God and a daughter of God you got
[1:21:58] to respond to your God you got to
[1:22:02] respond to your Creator
[1:22:04] you got to respond to your makeup if a
[1:22:07] natural see will respond by shooting
[1:22:09] through the earth little shoots so let
[1:22:11] it know I'm responding to what God is
[1:22:14] doing in my situation Amen if you are a
[1:22:17] son of God I thought oh god you're gonna
[1:22:19] have to respond at some point in time
[1:22:21] hey at some point I'm your hand gonna
[1:22:24] get lifted up sup one time you know say
[1:22:28] Amen to the Word of God we just gotta
[1:22:30] get you in the right condition the right
[1:22:33] situation and you will respond to God we
[1:22:38] looking for the predestinated seed to
[1:22:40] have a revival glory to God hallelujah
[1:22:47] hallelujah hallelujah it has to be in a
[1:22:51] certain position to make that seed break
[1:22:55] forth out of the dirt all we doing just
[1:22:58] trying to put that's why we got prayer
[1:22:59] meetings going on we're trying to put it
[1:23:02] in the right condition in the right
[1:23:03] atmosphere we want to see this thing
[1:23:05] break forth we're trying to make the
[1:23:07] seed break for amen amen that this is
[1:23:11] something I can make great forth because
[1:23:12] I know what I plan it
[1:23:15] hallelujah we're trying to make the seat
[1:23:18] break forth that's what he said the
[1:23:19] world the world has to be in a certain
[1:23:23] position like these words the world has
[1:23:27] to be a certain position you know there
[1:23:29] are certain things in your life that
[1:23:30] happen to you that cause you'll see to
[1:23:33] come forth
[1:23:35] there are certain things that happen in
[1:23:37] your life certain trials that you're
[1:23:41] gonna have to go through in order to put
[1:23:43] yourself in position for the seed to
[1:23:46] come forth do you realize the prodigal
[1:23:49] son had to go through certain things in
[1:23:51] his life before he can realize who he
[1:23:53] really was hallelujah
[1:23:56] until the seed broke forth in his life
[1:23:58] he couldn't appreciate his position Oh
[1:24:00] y'all in with me hey man he didn't
[1:24:04] realize what he had when he was at his
[1:24:06] daddy's house he even realized the glory
[1:24:09] he didn't realize the great things that
[1:24:11] that was before him when he was at his
[1:24:13] daddy's house he may he didn't realize
[1:24:16] he was not a servant but he was a son
[1:24:18] amen and by being a son there were
[1:24:20] certain things that were gonna come to
[1:24:22] him when Daddy died there was an
[1:24:24] inheritance that went to the son the
[1:24:26] service will never experience since the
[1:24:29] service may live in the house but
[1:24:31] they're not the sons they will never
[1:24:34] experience what the sons have they may
[1:24:37] have a good life but they won't have the
[1:24:39] life of the son and that boy could
[1:24:42] appreciate that he thought he said I'm
[1:24:46] smarter than daddy i'ma get up and imma
[1:24:47] leave my daddy's house he says I'm going
[1:24:50] out on my own I'm gonna make this thing
[1:24:51] work on my own and as he went out on his
[1:24:55] own hallelujah everything that he had he
[1:24:58] lost just like that praise the Lord
[1:25:01] don't you thank you smarter than mommy
[1:25:03] and daddy praise the Lord
[1:25:06] you come out on your own if you want to
[1:25:08] you got a few dollars in the bank your
[1:25:12] money be gone before you know it and you
[1:25:15] ain't gonna have but one place to go you
[1:25:17] think you got free is now your friends
[1:25:21] gonna lose it all and they gonna have a
[1:25:23] place they could go back to but you
[1:25:25] gonna be stuck on a limb coming back
[1:25:29] like
[1:25:30] prodigal son came back hallelujah amen I
[1:25:33] rather just be a uh-uh-uh
[1:25:35] amen are serving in your house because
[1:25:38] the servants live better than the way
[1:25:40] I'm living out here and it's good that
[1:25:43] he came back with that type of spirit
[1:25:46] because the daddy could work with him
[1:25:49] sudden I see you broken I see you broken
[1:25:53] but all that's happened is the seed is
[1:25:54] now breaking for and now let me let me
[1:25:57] impart let me a part a deeper revelation
[1:26:00] to you son
[1:26:02] I got servants all over the place and
[1:26:04] yes they do live well but they were not
[1:26:06] born they were not born of my lord so
[1:26:10] therefore you can never be a servant you
[1:26:12] will always be a son you had to
[1:26:21] recognize the status and he took his
[1:26:22] place but there were things in life that
[1:26:25] calls him to amen get a better
[1:26:28] understanding of his position even with
[1:26:32] some pigs caused him to get a better
[1:26:34] understanding of his position going
[1:26:37] through broken relationships caused him
[1:26:40] to get an understanding of his position
[1:26:42] oh my god young man young woman don't
[1:26:50] don't marry nobody that I ain't no
[1:26:52] believer hey man don't you do that right
[1:26:56] cuz here you don't you don't realize
[1:26:58] that you put yourself in a situation
[1:27:00] that you can't get out of
[1:27:03] amen you you get married that don't work
[1:27:07] out did you try to find somebody not
[1:27:10] that ain't gonna be working out like
[1:27:11] that no no you better pray and wait on
[1:27:14] God because I'll tell you what your
[1:27:17] relationship will reduce the right
[1:27:19] situation for your seed to grow you
[1:27:23] weren't thinking about praying before
[1:27:24] now you're gonna pray remember I
[1:27:26] remember I'd made this announcement
[1:27:28] plenty of times say either you gonna
[1:27:30] pray now or you gonna pray later but
[1:27:34] what you don't ready you can either pray
[1:27:42] now you can play later but you don't
[1:27:45] bring glory to God you guys I'm tired in
[1:27:53] order for the seed to break forth you
[1:27:55] got to put it in the right conditions
[1:27:56] and in this way brother MC says but the
[1:27:59] world has to be in a certain position to
[1:28:03] make the sea bring forth the world the
[1:28:07] things you go through in the world will
[1:28:09] cause a seed to break for I'm telling
[1:28:16] you it some of us wouldn't be here right
[1:28:18] now
[1:28:19] have we not gone through the things we
[1:28:22] went through God was using your
[1:28:26] circumstance to bring you to this place
[1:28:33] and if he hears that for you let him do
[1:28:37] the same thing for your loved ones
[1:28:40] hallelujah just put him in the right
[1:28:42] situation the right circumstance and
[1:28:45] watch to see break for I believe this
[1:28:53] can I go a little further this is our
[1:28:56] message investments it says I was at an
[1:29:01] interview with a priest not long ago and
[1:29:05] he says he said mr. Branum
[1:29:07] you're trying to talk about a Bible this
[1:29:11] is the church that God is in his church
[1:29:15] I said show me where it says the Bible
[1:29:19] said that God is in the world he is the
[1:29:23] word and if the word if the words of you
[1:29:29] it produces caught again that's why I
[1:29:32] said earlier God is looking for God God
[1:29:35] nobody planet and what he put in the
[1:29:39] seat no matter how much dirt is all over
[1:29:42] it house muddy and look how dirty look
[1:29:45] how filthy look God know what he put
[1:29:47] inside that seat and i'ma tell you an
[1:29:49] order for a seed to grow it's gotta give
[1:29:51] him some muddy dirty messed up
[1:29:54] conditions
[1:29:57] hey ma'am even if you put on gloves your
[1:30:00] gloves gonna get dirty when you're
[1:30:01] working with seeds I hope you're with me
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] it says it'll print it produces God
[1:30:12] again and he said the word is a seed in
[1:30:15] the seed produces what its kind is it'll
[1:30:19] produce a godly life a fully consecrated
[1:30:22] life to Jesus Christ how we know that
[1:30:26] because the Bible tells that God is holy
[1:30:29] if God is holy and his seed is inside of
[1:30:32] us but that's gonna make you holy all
[1:30:37] right which are what was it what what is
[1:30:40] in God of all the potentials everything
[1:30:43] that's in da is laying inside to
[1:30:44] believer a man it's in the believer so
[1:30:47] everything we see in God it ought we
[1:30:49] ought to see it in a believer amen
[1:30:52] otherwise we're not seeing it there's
[1:30:53] something wrong all right let's go on a
[1:30:56] little further Christianity versus
[1:31:00] idolatry the Prophet makes a statement
[1:31:02] oh thank you Lord Jesus since we are
[1:31:06] made partakers of his holiness we in His
[1:31:09] image we are living images of a living
[1:31:12] God then dead to self raised with him
[1:31:15] now listen listen to this his word made
[1:31:18] flesh again in us his word made flesh
[1:31:25] again and I see we know it was made
[1:31:27] flesh in Jesus the word became flesh and
[1:31:30] dwelt among us but now the Prophet
[1:31:32] brings it a still a step further now
[1:31:34] that same word is being made flesh in us
[1:31:37] me being made flesh again in us glory to
[1:31:42] God it says all brother Neville and I
[1:31:45] believe if the Prophet here he called
[1:31:47] all your names
[1:31:48] Oh sister so-and-so oh brother sir
[1:31:52] pretty pretty money Sam do you get that
[1:31:54] do you see that his word is being made
[1:31:58] flesh again
[1:32:03] amen if the seed and the fruit to cold
[1:32:06] let's once before you know a mango see
[1:32:09] will take on flesh and if it get too
[1:32:12] close to my house we will take the Amen
[1:32:16] take the flesh off the seed but if the
[1:32:21] scene want to be made flesh again it
[1:32:24] must be planted again and there's a life
[1:32:27] inside that seed it will come forth
[1:32:31] again the word will be made flex I give
[1:32:35] enough the word that the living word
[1:32:39] will be made flesh we're rittany pistols
[1:32:43] red ball men this is the Bible Church
[1:32:46] listen it goes on it says our brother
[1:32:49] never look what is it not the mythical
[1:32:52] imaginary God setting out there but the
[1:32:55] Living God says what is the Living God
[1:32:58] the word and you making itself real
[1:33:03] simple but deep but what is what is the
[1:33:08] Living God the word in you making itself
[1:33:12] real right now this is why I said
[1:33:15] earlier we're not waiting on nothing to
[1:33:17] come it's here and God just need to make
[1:33:21] this real to us Lord sometimes when I
[1:33:24] pray say Lord just just help my help me
[1:33:27] get revelation and understanding as to
[1:33:30] who I am now who I'm gonna be but Who I
[1:33:33] am God you put this in me before I was
[1:33:36] even born
[1:33:37] now now help me water this and and get
[1:33:40] the right amount of SOA and light on it
[1:33:42] so I can see this but these quotes that
[1:33:44] we give it this is SOA light Oh
[1:33:47] hallelujah amen when you listen to the
[1:33:50] Prophet you get there so in light
[1:33:54] hallelujah and as you get into
[1:33:56] conditions like that II can't help but
[1:33:58] break forth
[1:34:00] seed will break forth no matter what the
[1:34:04] conditions are look at this he says this
[1:34:07] says the wording you make himself real
[1:34:09] whoa glory to God he says oh I know you
[1:34:13] think I'm a holy ruler maybe I am but oh
[1:34:17] brother do you see it triumphs over
[1:34:19] every denomination triumph over all
[1:34:23] paganism a living God made manifest in a
[1:34:26] living temple and the Word of God which
[1:34:28] is God is made flesh in you why you're
[1:34:31] seated in heavenly places triumphs over
[1:34:34] all things in Christ Jesus amen oh I
[1:34:37] just love it I have to skip something
[1:34:39] and go on I just I thank God for that
[1:34:42] that the Living God is the word in you
[1:34:44] making itself real the word that's
[1:34:46] already in you is making itself real I
[1:34:50] heard the preacher say yesterday say
[1:34:52] sometimes I go around now talk to myself
[1:34:54] and people think that I might have lost
[1:34:56] my mind because I'm talking to myself
[1:34:58] he said but I'm really not just talking
[1:35:00] to myself I'm talking to what's living
[1:35:03] on the inside of me I'm talking to the
[1:35:07] God that's living on the inside of me
[1:35:10] hallelujah Church and sometimes when you
[1:35:14] when you hear quotes like that you just
[1:35:16] have to stop and think because we you
[1:35:18] know this earth got us program in a
[1:35:19] certain way but this word is trying to
[1:35:22] pull out trying to put us in the right
[1:35:24] condition where it can pull out the the
[1:35:26] things that got put in us what's the
[1:35:28] potential that's inside the seat God
[1:35:30] trying to bring that out and we got it
[1:35:32] we got the feet on the word we got a you
[1:35:35] know we got we got we got the guess so
[1:35:36] in light on we got to get more so we got
[1:35:38] to get all that because I'm I'm trying
[1:35:40] to be all that God wanted me to be a man
[1:35:44] you try to be like God yes I can't help
[1:35:46] that
[1:35:47] because that was inside the seat that's
[1:35:51] just that's just part of the DNA of God
[1:35:53] to be like God hey man all right let me
[1:35:57] go on a little further this is a message
[1:35:59] the rapture it says when I went forth
[1:36:03] into the meetings with you praying for
[1:36:06] the sick it was fine
[1:36:07] says but when I come with a message
[1:36:11] if any message goes forth it's a true
[1:36:16] message and if it's the true genuine
[1:36:21] miracles of God and hangs right in that
[1:36:24] organization you know it's not of God
[1:36:27] CSC can grow in denomination glory to
[1:36:31] God
[1:36:31] Hanks right in the organization you know
[1:36:33] it's not of God cuz that thing is
[1:36:35] already declared he says Jesus went
[1:36:38] forth and heal the sick in order to
[1:36:40] catch their eyes of people them his
[1:36:44] message glory hallelujah then it's
[1:36:48] message that's right it has to have
[1:36:51] something that God is going to introduce
[1:36:55] deep dive divinely healing his miracles
[1:36:58] like that just catch the eyes of the
[1:37:01] people so when I listen to the tapes and
[1:37:05] I hear you know brother Branham coming
[1:37:07] out different people's situations and
[1:37:10] tell them who they're addressing and
[1:37:12] telling their conditions and then
[1:37:14] pronouncing that they're healed and he
[1:37:16] go from one city to the next city ain't
[1:37:18] no way he had time to meet all their
[1:37:20] people and didn't remember all their
[1:37:22] conditions how this was more than a man
[1:37:26] this was God using a man hallelujah only
[1:37:31] God could show those things go into
[1:37:33] different countries never step put alone
[1:37:36] grounds before and say these things it
[1:37:38] was God using that man but God did that
[1:37:43] to get our attention the miracles and
[1:37:46] all of those things was Jessica nigh
[1:37:48] attention we had to come out of that in
[1:37:52] order to be in position for the sea to
[1:37:56] grow I couldn't stand the denominational
[1:38:01] Church and get this I couldn't stay hey
[1:38:06] what were they gonna preach to me I
[1:38:07] heard it so many times
[1:38:09] dang in the lion's den the day the
[1:38:11] Hebrew boys I heard it so many times oh
[1:38:15] my God my God my God Church I tell you
[1:38:20] what I thought I thank God that this
[1:38:22] word and
[1:38:22] thank God the miracles grab my attention
[1:38:24] to bring me forth to the word and by
[1:38:27] sitting underneath the atmosphere of the
[1:38:29] s om now this thing can grow now it can
[1:38:34] grow I'm in the right place now for
[1:38:36] something to take place hallelujah
[1:38:39] Oh glory let me just keep reading I got
[1:38:42] so I got I got it got a few more things
[1:38:44] I just need to share with you there's
[1:38:46] gonna be a multi-part sermon I'm sure
[1:38:47] but but but you know just bless my heart
[1:38:51] when I watch what the prophets say here
[1:38:53] he says it has to have something that
[1:38:56] God is going to introduce divine healing
[1:38:59] his miracles like that just catch the
[1:39:01] eyes of the people but the main heart of
[1:39:04] it is the message so the heart of the
[1:39:09] divine healing the heart of every
[1:39:12] miracle was the message we don't want to
[1:39:16] miss a message part we thank God for all
[1:39:19] the miracles but don't miss the message
[1:39:24] don't miss the fact that God sent you a
[1:39:27] prophet man that thing hit me like a ton
[1:39:32] of bricks just recently you know you
[1:39:34] know if somebody else might say well I
[1:39:37] just don't see that in Scripture brother
[1:39:39] Jack I don't see where God sent a
[1:39:41] prophet and there's many say that God
[1:39:42] didn't even need to send a prophet what
[1:39:43] you know I'm gonna tell you something
[1:39:45] that God did God love you so much that
[1:39:50] when he put the promise in the scripture
[1:39:53] he didn't exclude you because what God
[1:39:58] was really trying to say well I'm just
[1:40:01] y'all just bear with me on this one it's
[1:40:02] just my revelation what God was really
[1:40:05] trying to say behold I send Jack Duff
[1:40:09] Elijah
[1:40:14] that's what he was a butthole I sent
[1:40:16] jacked-up now now see people to put my
[1:40:18] name there y'all were to know exactly
[1:40:20] who he was talking to but because he
[1:40:23] loved you so much he didn't put my name
[1:40:26] there
[1:40:29] he put everybody name there by saying
[1:40:32] behold I've seen you Elijah the Prophet
[1:40:36] before the coming of the trip for day of
[1:40:38] the Lord thank God for the miracles but
[1:40:41] don't miss that message yeah okay uh
[1:40:47] Moses had all kind of miracles I mean
[1:40:52] flies and and and and and lice and you
[1:40:56] know the water turned into blood and you
[1:40:58] know I mean you just name it ten planes
[1:41:01] struck each other but you know the
[1:41:04] message came out of Moses really say you
[1:41:06] better ply the blood to your door so you
[1:41:09] could be rejoicing over the lice and you
[1:41:12] can reuse your soul or the Flies and you
[1:41:14] can rejoicing over the water
[1:41:16] amen turn the blood but if you did not
[1:41:18] apply the message you would have been
[1:41:22] stuck in Egypt hummina
[1:41:25] glory to God so you want to hear the
[1:41:28] message of that prophet and you want to
[1:41:30] apply that for this thing we're not
[1:41:32] living in Moses day no more we've got to
[1:41:35] see the scripture as it's fulfilled
[1:41:37] today Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 6:17
[1:41:46] these are scriptures that I for today we
[1:41:54] got to see how it's working today
[1:41:56] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord the
[1:41:59] main the heart of it is the message
[1:42:02] there's what it is what comes from in
[1:42:06] here he's trying to get the favor of the
[1:42:08] people so they'll said and listen to him
[1:42:10] see for there's something in there
[1:42:13] that's ordained to life he goes on in
[1:42:15] this quote assess some of the grain we
[1:42:17] fell on the ground and I love this
[1:42:19] statement the birds picked it up others
[1:42:22] fell among storms and some
[1:42:24] went unprepared ground or pre-prepared
[1:42:28] ground and brought forth this is what I
[1:42:30] use that earlier it went on pre-prepared
[1:42:33] ground and brought forth now let's go
[1:42:36] back and look at that scriptwriter Luke
[1:42:37] 8 it went on pre-prepared ground and
[1:42:40] brought forth what what I went up what I
[1:42:43] want you to understand about
[1:42:44] pre-prepared ground before you work
[1:42:47] before you were even born you came to
[1:42:50] this earth with something on the inside
[1:42:51] of you ready to receive this you had
[1:42:56] never even heard of no message before
[1:42:58] you never heard no message what you're
[1:43:00] talking about
[1:43:01] I listen to the other day somebody come
[1:43:04] up to the the window out there brother
[1:43:06] Geoffrey happen to be there and like
[1:43:08] what kind of church this is brother said
[1:43:10] Christian Church anyway everybody said
[1:43:13] he Christians now we could have just
[1:43:16] blew the man away in one word have you
[1:43:18] ever heard of the message he probably
[1:43:22] would have been like you asked what kind
[1:43:24] of church it was message what that what
[1:43:32] does that say that's what that's why we
[1:43:33] said Christian right that's that's why
[1:43:35] we said Christian and let me tell you
[1:43:37] something everyone might might say
[1:43:39] they're Christians but they're not
[1:43:41] Christians follow Christ amen hallelujah
[1:43:47] it'd take a lot more than just coming to
[1:43:49] all ten and and making a confession
[1:43:51] after you make a confession you got to
[1:43:53] live like Jesus hallelujah somebody make
[1:43:58] confessions every week and don't mean
[1:44:00] them any man you got to follow you have
[1:44:06] to follow in the steps of Christ if
[1:44:07] you're gonna be a Christian live like
[1:44:09] them live according to his word a man in
[1:44:12] the commands from the chemical
[1:44:13] commandments of God are not Grievous
[1:44:15] amen Christians not looking for no easy
[1:44:17] way out but you know I mean but but it's
[1:44:20] Taylor do you know there's a message
[1:44:21] that has come forth in this hour
[1:44:23] God sent a prophet to bring us a message
[1:44:25] to give us prepare for a rapture did the
[1:44:28] church were now so confused by rap today
[1:44:30] some of them don't even believe in it no
[1:44:32] more
[1:44:32] they don't even believe in it because
[1:44:34] they couldn't explain it the Word of God
[1:44:36] is not
[1:44:37] man you can't explain it you got to
[1:44:40] believe it by faith there's some things
[1:44:42] you just discipline your mind you talk
[1:44:44] about God God has too much greater his
[1:44:47] thoughts are great enough thoughts his
[1:44:49] ways are great higher than our ways we
[1:44:50] can't we can't do nothing about that
[1:44:53] just accept it by faith all right I'm
[1:44:57] looking at this because it has to be
[1:44:59] pre-prepared ground and I believe before
[1:45:01] you were born you were God I'd already
[1:45:04] prepared your ground to receive a man
[1:45:07] this word in this day I heard a brother
[1:45:11] stayed what what are they what a day to
[1:45:13] live in brother John Kalinga made a
[1:45:16] statement yesterday he said you know we
[1:45:18] live in a time where we're time blends
[1:45:23] into eternity we're the people that's
[1:45:26] living in this in the most the greatest
[1:45:28] age because this is the age where people
[1:45:30] will catch a rapture right
[1:45:33] one day they maybe might call it looking
[1:45:35] for you how come you can come to work
[1:45:37] rapture rapture all right I mean but
[1:45:42] we're living that time we can expect
[1:45:44] this church we can expect the change of
[1:45:46] the body we can expect Christ to come
[1:45:48] back at any time we're living in the and
[1:45:51] the greatest time that anybody could
[1:45:53] ever live is at the second coming of the
[1:45:55] Lord Jesus this is a very special hour
[1:45:57] don't let the devil get your so wrapped
[1:45:59] up and and messed up in all the things
[1:46:01] of the world a man keep your mind on
[1:46:04] Jesus this is a very important hour that
[1:46:08] we live let's look at this scripture
[1:46:10] because we talked about pre-prepared
[1:46:12] ground that the breaking forth of the
[1:46:14] sea pre-prepared ground now we're at
[1:46:17] this let's go back and look at Luke 8
[1:46:19] again hallelujah verse 5 it says a soul
[1:46:24] went out to sow his seed and as he sold
[1:46:28] some fell by the way so seed is falling
[1:46:31] all over the place some fell by the work
[1:46:33] by the wayside and it was trotting bound
[1:46:36] and the fowls of the air devoured it now
[1:46:39] you know I'm a just i'ma say this not
[1:46:42] adding to the word but you know a seat
[1:46:45] even if the fowls of the air guy
[1:46:51] it can still grow because it goes
[1:46:58] through their system and they let the
[1:47:01] seed right back out into the earth again
[1:47:04] Oh y'all a wit me some y'all don't went
[1:47:08] through some stuff pray are you with me
[1:47:13] now
[1:47:14] do you know whither some stuff but the
[1:47:16] devil cannot stop that seed from coming
[1:47:19] forth let's say what happened to a see
[1:47:24] when you bury it
[1:47:26] it grows Jesus look at this now thus a
[1:47:34] soul went forth the sword seed and as he
[1:47:37] sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[1:47:39] was trotting down and the fowls of the
[1:47:41] air devoured it but the same found
[1:47:43] sister found they will have to let it go
[1:47:45] again like watch this it's saying some
[1:47:48] fell upon a rock and as soon as it was
[1:47:52] sprung up it withered away because it
[1:47:55] lacked moisture and some fell among
[1:47:59] thorns and the thorns sprang up with it
[1:48:02] and choked it my god watch you know you
[1:48:06] want to make sure you got pre-prepared
[1:48:07] ground here since another fell on good
[1:48:10] ground and sprung up and bear fruit a
[1:48:13] hundredfold and when he had said these
[1:48:16] things he cried he that happen yeah let
[1:48:20] he neither have ears to hear let him
[1:48:22] hear and his disciples asked him saying
[1:48:26] what might this parable be not a good
[1:48:30] thing about this is that they had
[1:48:31] private audience with Jesus other people
[1:48:35] left that service with no understanding
[1:48:37] as to what Jesus just saying but because
[1:48:39] they had private audience with Christ
[1:48:41] they could get clarity look at this oh
[1:48:46] my god I feel like because we got this
[1:48:49] message we got private audience
[1:48:52] hey man that's why we get clarity on
[1:48:54] these things any scripture in the Bible
[1:48:56] this is a church that we can preach in
[1:48:58] the book of Revelation their church that
[1:48:59] they will not touch revelation will not
[1:49:01] touch it because it just we don't know
[1:49:04] what it means they don't went to school
[1:49:06] and still don't know what it means God
[1:49:09] sent us a prophet that's not we know
[1:49:10] these things first Tim says and he said
[1:49:13] unto you it is given to know the
[1:49:16] mysteries unto you Lori to know the
[1:49:21] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[1:49:23] others in parables
[1:49:25] thank God we know the mysteries that
[1:49:27] seeing they might not see and hearing
[1:49:30] they might not understand now the
[1:49:32] parable is this the seed is the word of
[1:49:39] God in men and if it's the Word of God
[1:49:42] is God a man because the Word was made
[1:49:45] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:49:46] the sea is God but sea is the word of
[1:49:50] God hallelujah since those Bible ways
[1:49:54] are they they're here then cometh the
[1:49:57] devil hallelujah and taketh away the
[1:50:01] word out of their hearts lest they
[1:50:03] should believe and be saved now I'm
[1:50:05] telling you even after the day that
[1:50:07] everyone comfort you on your promise but
[1:50:08] you got to hold on to what God gave you
[1:50:10] it has to become personal property
[1:50:14] personal property listen it says so it
[1:50:18] says the devil and taketh away the word
[1:50:21] out of their hearts lest they should
[1:50:22] believe and be sane so that's the ones
[1:50:25] that a man when it's falling on the
[1:50:27] wayside now verse 13 they own the rock
[1:50:30] they which when they hear receive the
[1:50:34] word with joy and these have no root but
[1:50:39] I don't want to just be here shouting
[1:50:40] and jumping over the word but not
[1:50:42] letting us take root in my life amen
[1:50:46] you know we we learn Church behavior we
[1:50:50] know how to rejoice from everybody else
[1:50:51] ready to us if the preacher lifts its
[1:50:53] voice a little bit we know to say Amen
[1:50:55] I I'm not saying man because a preacher
[1:50:58] lifts his voice I say man because he
[1:51:00] preaching the word brother that's what
[1:51:03] my soul needs glory to God listen says
[1:51:07] they are maracas they which when they
[1:51:09] hear receive the word glory glory glory
[1:51:12] glory glory glory I just that just
[1:51:15] blessed my heart that brother said a man
[1:51:17] like that that blessed my heart he
[1:51:19] catching it secondhand but that's how
[1:51:22] that's how powerful this word is oh not
[1:51:27] even even if you have to catch a second
[1:51:29] hand it still has power Jesus glory to
[1:51:35] God hallelujah look at look at this he
[1:51:38] says it says they on the rock Ave which
[1:51:44] when they hear receive the word with joy
[1:51:46] and these have no root which for a while
[1:51:49] believe so that means for a while it's
[1:51:53] growing and for a while they believed
[1:51:56] for a while get that church don't don't
[1:52:00] don't let Jesus work over you people can
[1:52:02] go on for a while for a certain amount
[1:52:05] of time and then they stopped believing
[1:52:07] what happened they meant for a while
[1:52:10] believe it look at look what he said and
[1:52:12] in the time of temptation fall away what
[1:52:16] my prince lord help me I don't want to
[1:52:18] be like that God why let this fall into
[1:52:20] my heart and or if you know coming to my
[1:52:23] presence and then I can't hold on to it
[1:52:25] I don't want it to be like that oh my
[1:52:28] you know I mean it's like like like
[1:52:30] jewels or something precious jewels that
[1:52:33] somebody would give you and and already
[1:52:35] I thought you know he already do just
[1:52:38] kind of just show it to you why well
[1:52:39] just show it to me i won't i won't
[1:52:41] access a man for me to look at it it's
[1:52:47] not gonna do much for me
[1:52:48] any man but if you get it to me it will
[1:52:51] change my life hallelujah
[1:52:54] look at this now verse 14 and that which
[1:52:58] fell among thorns are they which when
[1:53:02] they have heard go forth and our choked
[1:53:05] with care
[1:53:07] and riches and pleasures of this life
[1:53:09] and bring no fruit to perfection
[1:53:11] that's it that's so we got to watch this
[1:53:14] now you can get seat you can hear the
[1:53:16] word of God but the cares of this life
[1:53:18] will cause you to miss what God is
[1:53:20] trying to call you to you so concerned
[1:53:23] about your career you know God didn't
[1:53:26] put you here only for a career what if
[1:53:29] God disrupt your career like he did mine
[1:53:32] what do you do then went to school got
[1:53:35] my master's degree I'm ready to work
[1:53:38] since I got my masters got promoted here
[1:53:41] I've become the manager and man
[1:53:42] everything and I'm gonna tell you
[1:53:44] something I a lord help us God when you
[1:53:46] become manager when you become manager
[1:53:50] and you lose your job it's hard to go
[1:53:53] back and not be managed again now you
[1:53:59] limit what jobs you can get praise the
[1:54:03] Lord you're limited at what concern I
[1:54:05] well I was managing I think unless you
[1:54:08] really get desperate
[1:54:10] you go back hallelujah but oftentimes
[1:54:13] when God
[1:54:14] elevate us all help us hear Holy Ghost
[1:54:16] when we get elevated it's hard to go
[1:54:19] back
[1:54:20] sometimes God wants you to go back
[1:54:22] because there's some lessons that you
[1:54:25] learn when you go back but because prior
[1:54:31] give us a knocking you know that's above
[1:54:33] me I mean I below me that's below me I I
[1:54:38] can't do that now God trying to humble
[1:54:41] that not trying to take that out of you
[1:54:43] hallelujah you just think be grateful it
[1:54:46] gave you a job now Amen hallelujah
[1:54:51] people get jobs 9 days my daughter's
[1:54:54] tell them somebody comes in you know
[1:54:56] what could this happening could that
[1:54:57] happen no that's that's that's not going
[1:54:59] to happen because we hired you for this
[1:55:02] did you read the Job Description her
[1:55:05] reporting to you is not in the job
[1:55:08] description actually you report to me no
[1:55:13] management responsibilities here
[1:55:16] none you want a job Amen that's the way
[1:55:21] it's gotta be
[1:55:22] but see God try to Humble us down but
[1:55:24] sometimes God bless us and we get that
[1:55:26] blessing man we get a little bit too too
[1:55:28] heady highminded big-headed praise the
[1:55:30] Lord it's hard to get humble again amen
[1:55:34] it's the truth anyhow wash me not me oh
[1:55:41] oh oh you forgot what you came from all
[1:55:47] right
[1:55:48] a man search you don't forgot where you
[1:55:51] came from huh yeah you can you can have
[1:55:54] that job yes you can God need you in
[1:55:56] that environment let me try to get back
[1:56:03] on the subject here all right
[1:56:06] verse 14 and that which fell among
[1:56:10] thorns are they which when they have
[1:56:12] heard go forth in our choked with cares
[1:56:14] and riches and pleasures of this life
[1:56:15] and bring no fruit to perfection
[1:56:18] look at this talk about that pre pre
[1:56:22] prepared ground verse 15 but that on the
[1:56:25] good ground are they which in an honest
[1:56:30] and good heart having heard the word
[1:56:33] that it says key after you hear it keep
[1:56:37] it you know when you plant anything in
[1:56:41] the earth it don't grow overnight yeah
[1:56:43] it takes it it takes time for that thing
[1:56:45] to grow but you got to keep it you got
[1:56:47] committed right so is it with the
[1:56:50] promises of God when God gives you a
[1:56:52] word see promise you got to keep it
[1:56:55] commit it and watch it grow listen he
[1:56:59] says but that on the good ground are
[1:57:01] they which in an honest and good heart
[1:57:03] having heard the word keep it and bring
[1:57:07] forth fruit with patience so don't dig
[1:57:11] up your promise God give you something
[1:57:13] you hold on to it keep it and it'll
[1:57:15] bring forth fruit in patience all that
[1:57:17] has to do is just get in the right
[1:57:18] condition the right situation and you'll
[1:57:21] see it come forth let me just give you a
[1:57:24] couple more things here
[1:57:26] yeah when I go to looking at things like
[1:57:28] this I like to go back to like
[1:57:31] children's websites where they talk
[1:57:34] about C's I see if they could they could
[1:57:36] teach it to a child and they can teach
[1:57:38] it to me
[1:57:39] and in this child's website that I was
[1:57:42] looking at a man a cool kid facts it was
[1:57:47] talking about C's and it says inside a
[1:57:50] seat is an embryo which is a tiny plant
[1:57:55] and now now I didn't really realize that
[1:57:58] was in a seat but on the website they
[1:58:00] sure you had a big inside the seat and
[1:58:02] there's actually a plant in the sea
[1:58:05] callin embryo it's already there in the
[1:58:08] sea it's got life in it right it says
[1:58:11] inside a seed is an embryo which is a
[1:58:14] tiny plant and it says and the endosperm
[1:58:17] which are small leaves which feed the
[1:58:20] embryo so the leaves are feeding the
[1:58:23] embryo causing it to grow the outside of
[1:58:27] the seed has a coat and this acts as a
[1:58:31] protection for the embryo to make sure
[1:58:34] it's safe
[1:58:36] hallelujah amen God has been protecting
[1:58:39] you and keeping you but on the inside
[1:58:40] you you know I remember brother saying
[1:58:42] you're not you're not the believer but
[1:58:45] it's the word seed on the inside of you
[1:58:47] that to believe them listen he said say
[1:58:51] that embryo is it's simply stored inside
[1:58:55] the coat and notice what it says waiting
[1:58:58] for the perfect time to begin
[1:59:01] germinating so the embryo is safely
[1:59:05] inside the coat waiting so even when
[1:59:09] you're looking at a seat there's
[1:59:10] something in the seed you get that Amen
[1:59:14] there there's life inside what you can't
[1:59:16] see all you see is the coating of the
[1:59:17] outsides hallelujah but what's on the
[1:59:21] inside a man has to be they use it to
[1:59:24] germinate it and what that means is that
[1:59:27] it means it starts growing so when it's
[1:59:30] germinating is starting to grow
[1:59:32] now you know where there's germinating
[1:59:33] inside the coating you can't see it you
[1:59:37] can't see it growing you don't even
[1:59:40] realize this girl I can't I tell y'all
[1:59:41] something even right here right now it
[1:59:44] may look like folk ain't responding and
[1:59:47] ain't listening but there is something
[1:59:50] called on the inside
[1:59:51] hallelujah and one of these days we
[1:59:54] gonna see it spread out it might start
[1:59:58] with Jess that's not just and before you
[2:00:04] know it it'll keep growing and it'd be
[2:00:06] hey man when I was blessed
[2:00:09] well yesterday yesterday when I was at
[2:00:11] the service I was on Friday night Friday
[2:00:14] night
[2:00:14] I was at a service and brother got to
[2:00:16] preaching and glory to God and and I saw
[2:00:19] sister come from the back of the church
[2:00:21] a sister come from the back she walked
[2:00:25] up to the front
[2:00:35] that changed where that preacher was
[2:00:37] preaching when he saw sister come do
[2:00:39] something like that oh my god my god we
[2:00:43] need some more that's that's what I'm
[2:00:46] talking about break foot and when it's
[2:00:49] when it's true revival
[2:00:51] it ain't man just when the meeting times
[2:00:54] every time we come together and we have
[2:00:57] the fon strikin it'll be a man every
[2:01:01] time glory to God Church I'm on the
[2:01:09] expectation so listen so even you're
[2:01:12] looking at the seed inside the seat is
[2:01:15] the embryo all right which is a tiny
[2:01:18] plant now and so so what was inside is
[2:01:21] actually what's get ready to be
[2:01:22] manifested on the outside glory to God
[2:01:25] listen say the embryo is safely stored
[2:01:28] inside the coat waited for the perfect
[2:01:31] time to begin germinating which means
[2:01:33] that it starts growing the sea
[2:01:36] I need the right conditions to terminate
[2:01:40] hallelujah to start doing they need the
[2:01:43] right conditions of to terminate and
[2:01:45] they may have to wait for years before
[2:01:49] the conditions are right I love that see
[2:01:53] in the right conditions will produce
[2:01:55] exactly what God put in it to produce
[2:01:57] but sometimes that seed might have to
[2:01:59] wait for years before it actually begins
[2:02:02] to grow don't give up on it I put
[2:02:08] something and see if you don't want it
[2:02:10] when it's like that sometimes we think
[2:02:11] the seed is dead no it's not dead
[2:02:13] it's just it just needs the right
[2:02:14] conditions right amount of water right
[2:02:17] amount of moisture I mean right right
[2:02:18] around mount of sunlight and then also
[2:02:21] the the world has to be in a certain
[2:02:23] position for that seed to grow all right
[2:02:27] let's go on go on a little further look
[2:02:29] at this look at this look at this some
[2:02:32] seeds need light to germinate others
[2:02:38] need darkness
[2:02:41] are y'all with me some seeds need light
[2:02:46] to germinate others need darkness
[2:02:50] I'm gonna just stop there got mo to read
[2:02:52] on that but I see some seeds will grow
[2:02:55] in light conditions that mean they come
[2:02:58] to church they hear the word of God they
[2:02:59] get into an atmosphere the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:01] moving in some spark and they've gone
[2:03:07] others need darkness
[2:03:11] you can grow in darkness you might be in
[2:03:17] a bus on a bus tube somewhere in
[2:03:20] darkness y'all and with me
[2:03:23] and you you should not think you having
[2:03:26] the time of your life and then somebody
[2:03:29] start talking about God remember them
[2:03:31] brothers there was talk about Christians
[2:03:33] at a ball and they say ain't no such
[2:03:36] thing is no Christian and it's that they
[2:03:39] didn't realize they challenged to truck
[2:03:41] me they challenged the truck easy
[2:03:44] truckers all of us said look man I gotta
[2:03:46] tell you there is a Christian there's at
[2:03:48] least one come on ain't no such thing as
[2:03:50] Chris
[2:03:51] they thought they could drink their
[2:03:52] problems away they thought that this
[2:03:55] everybody else had failed him there was
[2:03:57] no living Christians they could just
[2:04:00] forget about it
[2:04:01] but the man say oh yeah there's at least
[2:04:02] one ain't no Christian it's one well who
[2:04:08] you talk about my wife
[2:04:11] your wife a creep let's go to my house
[2:04:15] the man took them from a dark condition
[2:04:22] sometimes Oh and order for them to even
[2:04:27] go to the man's house something had to
[2:04:29] strike to see some seeds can grow in
[2:04:39] dark conditions you don't know you know
[2:04:42] I mean because but see the seed has a
[2:04:43] low inside that has got to come forward
[2:04:45] so whether it's in darkness or light is
[2:04:48] still coming for that that man took them
[2:04:51] took them fellas back to his house his
[2:04:53] wife just demonstrated the Christian
[2:04:56] characteristics and you know I'll say it
[2:04:59] since some might not know but you know
[2:05:01] he he said we're gonna act like we've
[2:05:02] drunk fellas and we're gonna do this
[2:05:04] we're gonna do that we're just gonna
[2:05:05] like we dropped we don't put it to a

[2:05:12] fridge I said we want this for breakfast

[2:05:17] kitchen made up all the food brought it
[2:05:19] to the table and they said I watched
[2:05:20] this boys watch this he took the plate
[2:05:23] pushed it

[2:05:44] world go free no there's a cross for
[2:05:47] everyone and there's a cross for me

[2:05:53] giving God glory in the midst of her
[2:05:56] trial and and and in the drunks hurt her
[2:05:59] do that and they looked at de france'

[2:06:06] husband and them other drunks to Christ
[2:06:09] light struck in the midst of darkness
[2:06:14] some seeds can grow in darkness now I
[2:06:17] want to tell you something else now
[2:06:19] there's some other seeds that can grow
[2:06:20] some some some very wicked seeds that
[2:06:23] can grow in darkness see when you go on
[2:06:26] the websites that you shouldn't be going
[2:06:27] to seeds will grow in darkness when
[2:06:31] you're looking at stuff that you
[2:06:32] shouldn't be looking at seeds were
[2:06:34] growing darkness you got to be careful
[2:06:38] what you do when ain't nobody else
[2:06:40] around hallelujah amen it's it's people
[2:06:44] that just keep keep going back to them
[2:06:46] them them websites that that's preaching
[2:06:48] again and speaking against the message
[2:06:50] and I'm just gonna do this now no you
[2:06:52] better stay away from those dark sites
[2:06:54] you better stay away from it before you
[2:06:57] know there's a spirit that'll get on you
[2:06:58] and you don't you don't even know where
[2:06:59] it came from
[2:07:01] amen seeds grow in darkness and let me
[2:07:06] tell you something when it grows wants
[2:07:07] them towards everybody know what
[2:07:09] happened let me tell you something did
[2:07:12] they say they say seized meat
[2:07:14] some seasoning light to germinate that
[2:07:17] means to grow others need artists but
[2:07:19] all seas need moisture oxygen and the
[2:07:23] right temperature to to germinate now I
[2:07:26] like this right here another statement
[2:07:30] that they made on this website the seed
[2:07:33] needs to pass through the process
[2:07:37] call scarification in order for the seed
[2:07:44] to germinate the seeds has to go through
[2:07:47] a process called scarification Wow
[2:07:55] big word but this means that the hard
[2:07:58] Seco changes to allow moisture to get in
[2:08:04] here
[2:08:04] you ever seen folk be so hard that they
[2:08:07] just say gonna let God get nowhere near
[2:08:10] them but God gonna take you through a
[2:08:13] process called Scarah fication
[2:08:20] [Applause]
[2:08:23] and when you go on through Scarah
[2:08:26] fication see this is this is this is
[2:08:29] putting you in a position for something
[2:08:31] for for the seed to break forth right
[2:08:33] when you've gone through scare but the
[2:08:35] prodigal son went through Scarah
[2:08:36] fication
[2:08:36] that's what calls him to go back home
[2:08:39] right but all in the midst of that what
[2:08:41] was happens that that shell that out of
[2:08:43] the shell because someone's so tough so
[2:08:45] tough we think we tough but God got away
[2:08:49] breaking down that toughness Gaga -
[2:08:52] we're breaking down that spirit stop
[2:08:53] fussing and fighting and argue with folk
[2:08:55] y'all let God do what God do you said
[2:09:01] you get rid of your show and get broke
[2:09:03] if God got to scare you out yourself
[2:09:06] it's gonna get brutal Scarah fication oh
[2:09:14] god I've seen out I tried to be a tough
[2:09:17] guy myself one time and you know and God
[2:09:20] had a way he just I just went to church
[2:09:22] I went I guess I went one too many times
[2:09:25] because I went to church that one day I
[2:09:28] can't even remember what the prep the
[2:09:31] pastor preached but all I remember
[2:09:32] sitting back there and being broken in
[2:09:34] the spirit God had me in tears inside
[2:09:38] the sanctuary and and the good things I
[2:09:41] mean sister wesco knew that I was
[2:09:43] delivered she come just with that big
[2:09:46] grin on her face and just started
[2:09:47] smiling and shaking my hand she knew
[2:09:49] that I had
[2:09:49] free that day I didn't even have to tell
[2:09:51] her I went free God had to take me
[2:09:55] through scary broke me down
[2:10:00] and if I said like this if God can do it
[2:10:04] for tough Duff God can do it for anybody
[2:10:12] and all I'm gonna do just sit back and
[2:10:14] watch God go take you through Scarah
[2:10:17] fication Scarah fication happens
[2:10:29] naturally and nature in a number ways
[2:10:33] for example freezing temperatures we
[2:10:36] need win a time in our life to bring us
[2:10:39] through Scarah fication also and look at
[2:10:43] this when a seat pass through the
[2:10:45] digestive tract of an animal see see why
[2:10:48] I said that bird could actually get the
[2:10:49] seat and drop it right back into the
[2:10:52] earth and it still grown because the
[2:10:54] seat has a pass through the digestive
[2:10:56] tract of the animal and you know when
[2:10:59] it's going through the digestive tract
[2:11:02] of the animal Scarah fication is
[2:11:06] happening or through microbial
[2:11:09] activities that break down the seat coat
[2:11:13] once the conditions are right the plant
[2:11:16] inside starts to grow and get bigger
[2:11:18] it pushes open the seat coat a bit like
[2:11:21] a chick a chick hatching out of an egg
[2:11:24] tiny leaves appear and they push out of
[2:11:26] the soil when I'm looking at them thyme
[2:11:28] leaves I'm just seeing a hand get up
[2:11:30] like this I'm seeing mouths open up and
[2:11:35] praise God a man glory to God I'm saying
[2:11:38] people not ashamed of praising a God
[2:11:40] because they've been too good for you
[2:11:42] too good to you right I just that's what
[2:11:45] I'm looking for I'm under expectation
