[0:22] wednesday night service
[0:25] pray for the ones that i'm not here
[0:28] amen it might be few
[0:30] very few in number
[0:32] hey man there's a whole difference
[0:34] between a sunday
[0:36] amen and a wednesday
[0:39] man you see who
[0:42] hey man i'm gonna leave that alone
[0:46] but we here
[0:47] amen are we gonna stand in our post of
[0:50] duty

[1:08] and those that don't have a burn
[1:11] in their heart to uh be in service
[1:14] amen we'll pray for them
[1:17] amen because surely in this hour there
[1:20] should be a burning in your heart
[1:22] amen to be in service
[1:24] every time the doors are open
[1:27] many scriptures say forsake not to
[1:28] assemble yourself together as you see
[1:30] that day approaching amen and we
[1:32] certainly see that day approaching
[1:35] amen i tell you what uh
[1:37] when the does shut and one day they will
[1:39] be shut
[1:41] amen we'll look back at all of the
[1:43] services we missed
[1:45] and say man i wish i had made more
[1:48] services i wish i had been a little bit
[1:50] more
[1:51] desperate a man to uh

[2:12] uh
[2:13] certainly that i was late

[2:17] amen and for me just amazing that after
[2:20] the service like we had sunday i
[2:22] couldn't wait to get to church
[2:26] and i think a lot of times that uh
[2:29] people believe that all those things can
[2:30] only happen on sunday
[2:32] amen but uh
[2:34] some of your greatest services i find a
[2:37] lot of times on your midweek services
[2:40] amen you don't have a lot of the
[2:42] fighting a lot of the battle because the
[2:43] ones that are there are true believers
[2:46] for the most part
[2:48] amen and pulling on the word
[2:51] amen so let us stand to our feet not
[2:53] going to prolong the time

[4:48] you may be seated i won't have your
[4:50] stand
[4:52] amen
[4:54] um i'm gonna want to take a
[4:57] scripture
[4:59] amen if you go with me to uh
[5:02] matthew
[5:04] the 25th
[5:06] chapter the sixth verse
[5:10] amen
[5:14] a little
[5:15] a little bible study
[5:17] matthew the 25th and it's
[5:20] kind of um
[5:22] taking up where i left off last week
[5:25] it says uh in the sixth verse 20 matthew
[5:28] 25
[5:30] the sixth verse it says and at midnight
[5:32] there was a cry made
[5:35] behold the bridegroom cometh
[5:39] and go ye out to meet him
[5:41] then all those virgins arose and trim
[5:45] their lamps
[5:46] and the foolish said unto the wise
[5:50] give us your oil
[5:54] for our lambs have gone out
[5:58] amen and we don't want our lamps to go
[6:01] out in this hour
[6:03] amen
[6:04] but the wise answer saying not so
[6:08] lest there be not enough for us and you
[6:14] but go ye out rather to them that sell
[6:17] and buy
[6:19] for yourself
[6:21] amen
[6:22] see you have to
[6:24] you have to know him for yourself
[6:27] you can your parents can't carry your
[6:30] oil for you
[6:33] you have to i'm gonna get out this coat
[6:35] cause i feel my help coming
[6:38] amen thank you my brother appreciate you
[6:42] bro that's up man
[6:44] sit over there
[6:46] amen
[6:50] so go ye out you have to know him for
[6:52] yourself
[6:54] you can't
[6:55] have depend on your parents to have your
[6:58] oil in this hour
[7:00] speaking to our young folks
[7:03] you can't depend on your wife or your
[7:05] husband to have your oil
[7:08] you have to have enough oil for yourself
[7:13] amen
[7:14] thank you my brother
[7:16] and while they went to buy
[7:19] the bridegroom came
[7:22] and they that were ready
[7:25] went in with him to the marriage and the
[7:28] door was shut
[7:31] amen so they that were ready so the
[7:34] significance in this hour is to making
[7:37] sure
[7:38] that you're ready
[7:40] amen there was a group that failed to
[7:43] get ready
[7:45] failed to make themselves ready for the
[7:49] marriage
[7:50] and there was another group that had
[7:52] made themselves ready
[7:55] and that's kind of what we're going to
[7:56] talk on this evening amen making
[7:59] yourself ready
[8:00] the title is they that were ready
[8:04] so we we
[8:06] we want to
[8:07] um
[8:08] just look at here
[8:10] in 2nd corinthians the fourth chapter
[8:14] says uh but if our gospel be heard it's
[8:18] here to them that are lost
[8:20] in whom the god of this world has
[8:23] blinded the minds of them
[8:26] which believe not
[8:28] lest the light of the glorious gospel
[8:32] of christ
[8:33] who is the image of god
[8:35] should shine unto them
[8:38] now we see that the god of this world
[8:40] satan
[8:42] instead of opening the blinded eyes he
[8:44] have
[8:45] blinded the eyes of the people wow and
[8:49] they cannot
[8:50] understand the gospel
[8:55] so we preach
[8:57] not ourselves but christ jesus the lord
[9:01] and ourselves
[9:03] your servants
[9:05] for jesus sake for the god who commanded
[9:08] the light to shine in the darkness
[9:10] amen we see
[9:12] amen that that directly relates to
[9:15] genesis one and three he has shined that
[9:17] dark i shine the light
[9:19] into our hearts
[9:21] to give us the light
[9:23] of the knowledge of the glory of god
[9:26] amen the light of the knowledge of the
[9:29] glory of god
[9:31] amen so we're not talking about a
[9:33] literal
[9:34] light we're talking about a light of the
[9:36] gospel
[9:38] in order to be able to see
[9:41] in the darkness in order to be able to
[9:43] have an understanding amen there has to
[9:46] be some light
[9:48] amen but prophet was talking about the
[9:50] little fish amen that fish in the in the
[9:53] in that goes that lives way down
[9:56] in the in the deep deep dark sea
[10:00] they carry a little light with them
[10:03] amen there is a little light in their
[10:05] eyes that allow them to see in that
[10:08] darkness
[10:09] amen and that's what we need in this
[10:11] hour that light to see
[10:14] means to understand in this hour
[10:18] amen
[10:20] glory to god
[10:24] if we can go here
[10:26] to isaiah 53.
[10:32] the first chapter
[10:35] amen it says
[10:38] who
[10:40] has believed our report
[10:43] and to whom is the arm
[10:46] of the lord revealed wow
[10:49] see so it's it's it's it's it's about
[10:52] having a revelation in this hour
[10:56] amen
[10:57] uh uh uh i i'll put it
[11:01] this way uh
[11:08] i had a little quote
[11:13] bear with me one second here
[11:19] the prophet said here in the message
[11:22] turn on the light
[11:24] he says
[11:26] here uh
[11:30] and jehovah requires a lamb
[11:37] i'm at the right place
[11:40] uh one uh turn on the light paragraph
[11:43] 145.
[11:44] and here jehovah requires a lamb for his
[11:47] sacrifice for sin
[11:50] the businessmen that they lived in the
[11:52] cities here
[11:54] and they that sell goods and so forth
[11:57] their products and produce
[12:01] and whatever they're going to sell
[12:04] they don't raise lambs
[12:07] and what did the priest do
[12:10] made a little stand up there
[12:13] for them to sell their lambs
[12:16] so this man could come
[12:19] could go in
[12:20] and clear his souls with jehovah
[12:23] seemed like an admirable thing
[12:26] but it was off the word of god
[12:29] the people didn't raise
[12:31] lamb they knew it had to be a they come
[12:33] to offer their sacrifice and they can go
[12:35] right to the church and buy a lamb
[12:39] what did this fellow jesus of nazareth
[12:41] do
[12:43] what church did he come from
[12:46] what denomination does he belong to
[12:50] what fellowship card
[12:53] well he kicked him out
[12:56] and won't have nothing to do with him
[12:57] because he condemns every one of them
[13:01] what did he do he goes up there and
[13:05] takes uh takes that where men are trying
[13:08] to get their soul saved
[13:11] the church
[13:12] as we would call it today
[13:15] you spiritual minded people
[13:17] he kicked over the tables and throw the
[13:21] chains
[13:22] took ropes and platted them together
[13:25] and run them out
[13:27] and called the godly old priest of yours
[13:30] the son of the devil
[13:33] that kind old man that loaned you money
[13:36] when you was in trouble
[13:39] what is going to stand by you
[13:42] who is going to stand by you and bury
[13:44] you
[13:45] when you're dead that kind o priest
[13:49] he has got the fruit of the spirit
[13:52] but does this jesus of nazareth have the
[13:55] fruit of the spirit
[13:57] you can't judge by speaking in tongues
[14:00] neither can you judge by the fruit of
[14:03] the spirit
[14:06] but it takes a manifestation of the word
[14:09] brought to light
[14:11] it's the light that does it
[14:13] the man that walks in that light
[14:17] jesus christ was not founded upon
[14:20] speaking in tongues
[14:21] though he did
[14:23] he was not
[14:24] he was not the fruit of the spirit so he
[14:28] did
[14:29] you couldn't judge it
[14:31] amen but what he believed and punctuated
[14:35] it
[14:36] uh and god
[14:38] lived every word of promise of that day
[14:42] through him that's the light of the hour
[14:45] that's the evidence
[14:48] amen
[14:50] amen so the light amen is is having a
[14:54] revelation
[14:57] of the gospel amen for your day
[15:01] amen
[15:04] so we see
[15:08] amen go on here
[15:11] mark the 10th
[15:14] amen chapter talking about
[15:17] that right arm amen who has believed our
[15:20] report and to whom the arm of the lord
[15:24] amen is revealed
[15:26] and if we see in that in that in that
[15:28] scripture that it goes on to talk about
[15:30] uh for he shall grow up before him as a
[15:34] tender plant
[15:35] and as a root out of the dry ground
[15:38] and has no form nor commonness and we
[15:42] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[15:46] that we should desire him
[15:49] he is despised and rejected of men
[15:52] a man of sorrow acquainted with grief
[15:55] and
[15:56] we hid as it were our faces from him
[16:00] he was despised and was esteemed and we
[16:04] esteemed him now surely he has borne our
[16:06] grease and carried our sorrows
[16:08] yet
[16:10] did we esteem him stricken smitten of
[16:12] god and afflicted
[16:15] but he was wounded
[16:17] for our transgressions
[16:19] he was bruised for our iniquities
[16:22] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[16:25] him and by his stripes are healed
[16:29] common scripture we hear all of the time
[16:31] when we're trying to give people faith
[16:34] amen for physical healing
[16:37] amen but i want you to understand that
[16:39] that sacrifice was not was more than
[16:42] just for a physical healing
[16:45] we thank god for the scripture and the
[16:47] strife for our physical healing amen but
[16:50] that was a dual atonement
[16:53] amen because it starts with who hath
[16:56] believed our report and who the arm of
[16:58] the lord is revealed
[17:01] amen that'll go further than the healing
[17:04] of your body see the prophet said that
[17:07] the healing of your body is just the
[17:10] down payment
[17:11] wow
[17:14] we're looking for something much more
[17:16] than just the healing of these bodies
[17:19] amen we're looking for a complete body
[17:21] change
[17:24] amen
[17:26] we're looking here on mark the 10th
[17:28] chapter in the fourth verse
[17:31] talking about uh
[17:33] the ladies zebedee
[17:36] amen we'll start from the 35th verse
[17:39] james john the sons of zebedee came come
[17:43] unto him saying master
[17:46] we would that thou shouldn't do for us
[17:50] whatsoever we
[17:52] desire whatever we shall desire
[17:55] and he said unto them
[17:58] what would ye that i
[18:00] do for you
[18:02] they said unto him grant us
[18:06] that we may sit one on the right hand
[18:10] and the other on the left hand in glory
[18:14] but jesus said unto them
[18:17] amen ye know not what you asked
[18:21] can you drink
[18:23] of the cup that i drink of
[18:27] and be baptized with the baptism that
[18:31] i'm baptized with
[18:33] amen
[18:34] can you
[18:35] can you suffer amen the persecution amen
[18:40] that i'm suffering are you willing to
[18:43] walk up gal gases heal
[18:45] amen and be despised and rejected of men
[18:50] amen are you willing to go all the way
[18:53] with the lord
[18:54] amen because see this this this place
[18:58] that you ask for it takes
[19:00] a sacrifice
[19:02] it takes more than a sacrifice it takes
[19:05] a special calling
[19:08] if we read on here and he says and they
[19:10] said unto him we can
[19:14] and jesus said to them you shall indeed
[19:17] drink of the cup that i drink and with
[19:20] the baptism that i am baptized with all
[19:23] shall ye be baptized
[19:26] but to sit on my right hand
[19:29] and on my left hand
[19:32] it is not mine to give
[19:34] but it is it shall be given to them
[19:38] whom it is prepared
[19:41] amen he said when he left jesus said i
[19:43] go
[19:44] to prepare a place for you
[19:46] amen that where i am you may be also
[19:50] so he was talking to a a special
[19:53] specific group of people a man
[19:57] they that have made themselves ready
[20:00] amen will be granted a man to sit with
[20:04] him in glory
[20:05] amen
[20:06] are you with me
[20:08] amen so we look here
[20:11] continuing on that kind that thought
[20:13] that in revelations 1 16.
[20:16] amen he said
[20:18] that in his right hand
[20:20] are seven stars
[20:22] and out of his mouth went a sharp
[20:25] two-edged sword
[20:27] and his countenance was as the sun
[20:30] shineth in his strength
[20:32] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[20:36] that we looking at john hill on the isle
[20:38] of patmos and uh uh he's seeing these
[20:41] visions amen but he's seen here in the
[20:44] first verse there of 16 that he's seven
[20:47] stars in his right hand amen and it goes
[20:50] on at 18 says
[20:52] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[20:55] behold i am alive forevermore
[20:58] he is identifying himself after who he
[21:01] is
[21:02] amen and have the keys to death hell and
[21:07] the grave
[21:08] write these things that thou see
[21:11] the things which are
[21:12] and the things which shall be hereafter
[21:16] the mystery of the seven stars
[21:19] which thou
[21:20] saw was in my right hand now remember
[21:23] now he's talking about i go back to
[21:26] isaiah the prophecy that say whom has
[21:29] believed the report amen
[21:31] the arm of the lord is revealed amen so
[21:35] we see here at this end time he's
[21:37] showing john that he had in his right
[21:41] hand amen seven stars
[21:44] amen in these seven stars or what these
[21:47] angel messengers a man down through
[21:50] seven church ages amen that are going to
[21:52] reveal the truth amen for their time
[21:56] to whom the arm of the lord is revealed
[22:00] amen
[22:02] zebedee tried to just go to jesus and
[22:04] ask to say let my voice sit at the right
[22:07] hand and one at the left but hold on uh
[22:11] zibby is gonna take more than just
[22:13] asking me it's gonna take a revelation
[22:17] amen that is how you get yourself ready
[22:22] because the bible says that faith
[22:25] amen faithful healing amen faithful body
[22:30] change is going to come amen by hearing
[22:34] of the word
[22:36] amen we have enough faith amen we have
[22:39] enough faith just by reading the bible
[22:42] pretty much without a prophet to have
[22:45] nice clothes
[22:46] we have enough faith in this hour amen
[22:49] that we could get a nice car
[22:52] amen we have enough faith in this hour
[22:54] that we can buy fine homes amen that we
[22:57] can go out to eat every now and then
[23:00] that's all good and fine amen but it's
[23:03] gonna take a deep of faith amen
[23:06] amen a deep of faith amen for your
[23:10] healing
[23:11] amen and that's all fine and well he
[23:14] said i would that you prosper
[23:17] and be in good health
[23:19] amen so we want you to have enough faith
[23:22] amen to heal your body but the prophet
[23:25] said we barely got enough faith to heal
[23:27] a toothache part
[23:32] it's gonna take a revelation in this
[23:34] hour and i'm going to get into something
[23:37] i'm going to show you
[23:39] amen the revelation amen
[23:43] you love the lord
[23:46] say um
[23:48] the mystery of the stars
[23:50] which i saw in my right hand are
[23:53] the seven golden candlesticks
[23:57] and the seven stars
[23:59] and the angels
[24:00] of the seven churches
[24:02] and the seven candlesticks which i saw
[24:04] us in the seven churches
[24:06] candlesticks
[24:07] now we're talking about how do
[24:10] five virgins lit they lamps
[24:13] amen they lit it with the glorious light
[24:16] of the gospel
[24:18] that's how they made themselves ready
[24:21] amen
[24:23] in the message the pacmo's vision
[24:27] 19 uh 1960
[24:30] 1204
[24:32] paragraph 207
[24:35] the prophet
[24:36] says
[24:38] now the seven stars that was in my right
[24:41] hand
[24:43] he had seven stars in his right hand
[24:46] which means the seven ministers of seven
[24:50] ages
[24:53] it's beautiful
[24:55] how we go back to get
[24:57] the minister that brought the message to
[24:59] the f
[25:00] ephesians church age
[25:03] and the minister who brought the message
[25:06] amen the minister
[25:08] who brought the message to the ephesians
[25:10] church and the minister who brought the
[25:12] message held with it until death
[25:16] right down to the submariner church
[25:19] and to the pergamos church the bacteria
[25:22] and on down through the age
[25:24] went into that this age
[25:26] the ministers that kept and brought the
[25:30] light and held it back like the original
[25:35] like
[25:36] the original at the beginning and
[25:38] brought the light through him
[25:42] he held him in his right hand
[25:45] think right hand doesn't exactly mean
[25:50] like christ setting
[25:51] on god's right hand
[25:54] it doesn't mean that god
[25:57] has a right hand because god is a spirit
[26:01] but christ
[26:03] was the right hand of power
[26:08] your right hand
[26:10] man that
[26:11] man the fellow stands
[26:14] by you
[26:15] the closest to you
[26:17] my god
[26:19] and remember the seven stars was in the
[26:22] right hand just think they were drawing
[26:26] their current
[26:28] now see he's going back and forth he's
[26:30] talking about current electrical power
[26:33] but we're talking about delight to light
[26:35] those lamps my god drawing their current
[26:39] their light from him
[26:43] he
[26:44] is the great generator of power
[26:48] amen
[26:49] and we must be connected
[26:52] amen to the generator
[26:54] amen for power
[26:57] i mean we find ourselves sometime in a
[26:59] storm
[27:00] amen and the winds are blowing and the
[27:03] rain and then and and things get all
[27:06] taught
[27:07] man can only do so much
[27:10] they put down the lines and the poles
[27:12] and they got their substations and
[27:15] different things but every now and then
[27:18] we have to have what's called an
[27:19] emergency
[27:21] generator
[27:23] amen
[27:25] we have an emergency generator in this
[27:28] hour
[27:29] amen that we don't have to worry because
[27:31] when the lights go out
[27:34] amen our emergency generator kick in
[27:38] and when it's darkness all over the land
[27:41] amen they say hi those people out there
[27:43] still shouting
[27:45] singing why because the emergency
[27:47] generated and kicked in
[27:50] [Music]
[27:52] amen and our light is still burning
[27:55] amen because it comes from him the
[27:58] creator of life
[27:59] amen it comes from him the creator of
[28:02] power
[28:03] amen but you got to do the groundwork
[28:06] amen before the storm amen you have to
[28:09] connect the dots
[28:11] you have to connect the wires
[28:14] amen it has to be a revelation
[28:16] amen and a calmness that when the lights
[28:19] go out
[28:23] you don't panic
[28:25] i know everything is going to be all
[28:27] right
[28:29] wait a minute hold on just some second
[28:32] boom
[28:34] the generator has kicked in
[28:38] and we got life
[28:42] what happened you have drawn on the
[28:45] faith
[28:46] amen see the those five foolish virgins
[28:49] hey man they didn't have oil
[28:52] they didn't have gas because oil is a
[28:55] petroleum product they didn't have gas
[28:58] in the generator
[28:59] hey man so when the generator went to
[29:01] kick in amen
[29:06] nothing now
[29:09] there was nothing there to turn the
[29:11] generator
[29:12] amen but we're in this hour amen a
[29:15] certain prof group of people with a
[29:18] prophetic anointing amen who has a
[29:21] revelation amen of not only who he is
[29:25] amen but who she is
[29:31] he said i'll not leave you comfortless
[29:34] but i'll send you a comforter
[29:38] amen i will send you a revelation
[29:41] amen that is the oil
[29:43] amen in your generator that when the
[29:46] power goes out
[29:48] when the lights get dim
[29:50] you don't have to worry amen you have
[29:53] lights
[29:54] nobody on your block may have light amen
[29:58] but your porch light is on
[30:00] amen yeah condition running amen your
[30:03] stones working
[30:05] hey
[30:06] man you still have power
[30:12] amen
[30:13] power to overcome
[30:16] power to withstand the dark ages
[30:18] power to withstand the dark times in
[30:21] your life you don't quit
[30:23] you don't run you don't panic amen
[30:26] because you're connected to the
[30:27] generator
[30:31] glory to god
[30:32] [Applause]
[30:34] amen
[30:36] you love the lord
[30:41] he says here
[30:44] amen
[30:45] still here in uh
[30:48] patmos vision
[30:50] he held them in his right hand
[30:53] hey man think hand that doesn't exactly
[30:56] mean like christ
[30:58] amen said in his hand it means that god
[31:01] has got a right hand because he's a
[31:02] spirit he doesn't have a right hand
[31:04] amen
[31:06] and we'll go down to 209 here
[31:09] and remember the seven stars was in his
[31:11] right hand just think
[31:14] they were drawing the current
[31:17] their light from him
[31:20] they were completely
[31:22] under
[31:23] his control
[31:25] in his right hand
[31:27] oh every true servant of god
[31:29] is the same way held
[31:33] who can harm them
[31:35] who can harm them
[31:37] as one of the angels cried back
[31:40] there in the beginning remember
[31:43] angel means messenger
[31:46] we get to those deeper things a little
[31:48] later in the week
[31:50] an angel means messenger and he said
[31:53] what can separate us
[31:56] from the love of god
[32:00] in christ can sickness
[32:02] can peril
[32:04] can nakedness
[32:06] can sword can death
[32:08] i am persuaded said paul
[32:11] that there is nothing that can separate
[32:14] us
[32:15] can i say it this way
[32:17] from the generator
[32:19] [Music]
[32:22] amen
[32:24] which is the love of god
[32:26] amen which is in christ
[32:28] for we are completely yielded to his
[32:31] right hand
[32:33] amen
[32:34] now we familiar that the right hand
[32:36] means power
[32:38] and authority
[32:41] john the 16th chapter
[32:43] the 13th verse
[32:46] howbeit
[32:47] when the spirit of truth is come
[32:50] he will lead you
[32:52] amen and guide you into all truth
[32:54] for he shall not speak of himself
[32:57] but ever he shall hear
[33:01] and that shall he speak
[33:03] and show you things to come
[33:07] amen we see
[33:09] amen that that that the light amen
[33:12] you're able to see
[33:14] all around
[33:16] the hue of that light amen will give you
[33:19] the ability to see those things amen
[33:22] through a prophetic anointing amen
[33:25] through a prophetic lens a man to see
[33:28] those things which are to come
[33:30] now i want to kind of switch gears just
[33:32] a little bit
[33:34] if we can and go to the message god hid
[33:38] himself
[33:39] in simplicity amen
[33:42] this message preached in 1963
[33:45] amen oh 3 17
[33:48] amen was i believe it was the last
[33:51] message
[33:52] just before
[33:54] he preached the seals
[33:56] amen it might have been one other prayer
[33:58] i think this was the last one but just
[34:00] before he preached the seals
[34:02] but nevertheless i think it was
[34:04] strategically located
[34:06] amen because we see
[34:09] a man at the first pool
[34:11] of of his ministry
[34:13] amen when he had the vibrations in his
[34:16] hand
[34:17] and and he was able a man to to to to
[34:21] that was a great healing campaign
[34:24] and being a man and then during that
[34:26] second pull when he was able to discern
[34:29] the thoughts of the people
[34:32] he's able to call him out and say well
[34:34] you were touching such and you lived out
[34:36] of such and such place and this is your
[34:38] condition
[34:39] it was a great revival
[34:42] amen the people thought what a great and
[34:44] magnificent thing oh man we really know
[34:48] now that god is here but let me tell you
[34:51] something that wasn't what he come for
[34:56] he was just getting to the meat of his
[34:59] ministry
[35:00] and i'll show you some things amen he
[35:03] said
[35:04] but he had to get the people to see that
[35:06] god
[35:07] hide himself in simplicity
[35:10] you know i'm convinced that a lot of
[35:12] times we miss
[35:15] the supernatural of god
[35:17] because we're looking at the wrong
[35:19] things
[35:21] thank god for the healing
[35:23] oh god
[35:24] thank thank god for what he did to my
[35:26] wife
[35:27] amen but if we look beyond that
[35:31] amen we thank god for the revealing of
[35:34] the word
[35:38] amen because that is what's going to put
[35:41] oil in our lives
[35:43] that is what's going to keep our
[35:45] generator all full
[35:48] amen amen
[35:50] he says now men has their own ideal
[35:54] good ought to be
[35:56] and what god is going to do
[35:59] and i have made
[36:01] a old testament many
[36:04] times
[36:05] that man
[36:06] still
[36:07] remains
[36:09] man
[36:10] man always give god praise
[36:14] for what he did do
[36:17] and always look forward to what he will
[36:20] do
[36:22] and ignoring what he's doing
[36:28] that's the way
[36:30] they miss it
[36:32] they look back and see what a great
[36:34] thing he done
[36:37] and they failed to see what a simple
[36:40] thing he used to do it with
[36:45] and then they look forward and see a
[36:47] great thing coming
[36:49] that's going to happen
[36:51] and nine times out of ten it's already
[36:55] happening
[37:00] i believe that i believe that it's
[37:02] happening right now
[37:05] we are being changed as we speak
[37:09] from glory to glory
[37:12] amen we are being raptured as we speak
[37:16] amen because our mind and everything is
[37:19] being conditioned
[37:21] four rapture
[37:24] amen
[37:25] and they look forward to see the great
[37:28] things coming
[37:30] amen and he says it's happening right
[37:32] around them
[37:34] and it's so simple
[37:36] that they don't know it see
[37:39] we look if we go to the first seal i
[37:41] want to read something for them from the
[37:43] first seal
[37:44] 6303 18.
[37:47] amen um paragraph 68
[37:52] he said oh it's a great plan
[37:56] until
[37:58] it comes to that last angel
[38:01] how we had no certain mystery
[38:05] but he gathers up
[38:08] all that's been lost
[38:11] in those other ages
[38:13] all the truth
[38:16] that was truly revealed yet
[38:20] see
[38:21] as a revelation come
[38:24] then he reveals those things in this day
[38:30] did you catch that he go back and tire
[38:33] all of those loose sins now see that's
[38:35] going to take a a a a special it's going
[38:38] to take a little more faith
[38:42] amen for a rapture so we had to go be
[38:46] the prophet had to go back and get all
[38:47] of those things and tie up all of those
[38:49] loose sins
[38:51] amen because you got to be feeding a man
[38:54] from pure word in this hour
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] not uh i think it's this way
[39:01] or uh it might be this way
[39:04] no it had to be sure
[39:08] line upon line
[39:10] precept upon priest self
[39:13] had to be a prophet
[39:15] to go back and all of those things that
[39:17] was wondered about
[39:19] amen maybe preach even the prophet he
[39:22] said i was going to come out and i was
[39:24] going to preach it the way that i had
[39:26] always started and realized i was all
[39:29] together wrong
[39:32] he said that angel came into his room
[39:36] and revealed to him that night what it
[39:40] was
[39:44] that was the supernatural
[39:47] that angel
[39:49] came to the prophet
[39:51] and revealed to him the prophet talked
[39:53] about that he says oh my god he said it
[39:56] was such a presence
[40:00] what do you think
[40:02] is happening to you
[40:04] when you get a revelation
[40:09] it's that same angel
[40:13] amen he allowed the prophet amen he
[40:16] explained it they but you the prophet
[40:18] said i read on last week that said you
[40:20] can't compare quote
[40:25] scripture for scripture it takes a
[40:28] revelation
[40:32] he said to peter who told you this peter
[40:36] flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you
[40:38] peter
[40:41] so in order for you to receive amen that
[40:45] revelation that has to be
[40:47] amen a supernatural
[40:51] take place
[40:53] in your mind and in your heart amen to

[41:37] services we had this weekend
[41:40] oh lord talking about that rock
[41:44] what a glorious revelation
[41:50] but there's more
[41:52] there's more because what the prophet
[41:54] said he said amen there will be a
[41:57] feeling of the holy ghost
[42:00] and many refillings
[42:03] make no mistake about it my brothers and
[42:05] sisters the mystery of this hour is
[42:07] receiving a refilling of the holy ghost
[42:09] without sensation

[42:13] gospel in your soul when god reveals to
[42:16] you just a little bit more
[42:18] of the mystery amen and you go closer to

[42:36] alone the mysteries of god is the
[42:38] mysteries of the seventh angel
[42:41] amen now
[42:43] we just come through the church ages
[42:45] with even history
[42:48] uh and prove that see it is the angel's
[42:51] message of the seventh church all right
[42:55] amen
[42:57] go on down to the uh chapter the seven
[43:01] paragraph 74.
[43:04] amen
[43:09] and at the end of the pentecostal age
[43:13] we are supposed to receive
[43:17] according to the word of god
[43:19] he says help me tonight to show you
[43:21] through here that we are to see
[43:25] receive
[43:26] a messenger
[43:28] amen that will take all these loose ends
[43:32] see you have to receive
[43:36] the messenger
[43:39] see
[43:40] if you don't receive the messenger
[43:44] amen

[44:04] god
[44:05] for the rapturing
[44:07] of the church
[44:09] and then there is coming forth seven
[44:12] mysterious thunders
[44:13] that not even written

[44:20] thunders will be revealed in the last
[44:23] day in order
[44:25] to get the bride together

[44:40] further
[44:43] we can't have
[44:45] we can't have enough faith for divine
[44:49] healing hardly
[44:51] we've got to have enough faith to be
[44:53] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[44:57] the earth and we find out after a while
[45:00] the lord will
[45:02] find
[45:04] where
[45:05] it is written

[49:05] revealed
[49:07] amen
[49:08] let's go my sister
[49:10] christ the mystery of god reveal
[49:13] amen 630728
[49:17] amen
[49:18] paragraph 204
[49:21] oh my
[49:23] glory to god
[49:25] do you know who you are this evening
[49:27] amen
[49:30] glory to god
[49:32] we see here christ the mystery of god
[49:34] revealed
[49:36] listen now i said i had to quote he say
[49:39] the new birth is
[49:41] the revelation
[49:43] god has revealed to you
[49:45] the great mystery
[49:48] and that's a new birth
[49:53] the revelation
[49:55] christ revealed
[49:57] the mystery and that's a new birth
[50:02] now what are you going to do
[50:04] when you get all that group together
[50:08] where the revelation is perfectly in
[50:12] harmony
[50:13] and god expresses it through his word
[50:16] by the same action
[50:18] the same things that he did
[50:21] making the word manifest oh if the
[50:25] church only knew its position
[50:28] it will one day then the rapture will go
[50:34] when it knows
[50:37] what it is
[50:39] when she knows who she is
[50:44] amen
[50:48] you love the lord
[50:51] hey man
[50:54] i wanna
[50:58] amen
[51:03] we just look
[51:05] there was one other thing i wanted to
[51:08] amen
[51:14] this message that the prophet preached
[51:19] he
[51:20] said i forgot to turn my time on
[51:25] i have no idea what time well
[51:28] hey man i'm almost in closing
[51:32] amen
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:34] and said this
[51:36] the prophet was talking about this
[51:38] little girl
[51:41] and uh
[51:42] a friend that he had uh
[51:46] mr uh
[51:47] utica
[51:49] uh you know that was in the place lived
[51:51] in utica his name was jim dorsey
[51:54] he says many of you people might know
[51:57] him i don't think nobody here know him
[51:59] but
[52:00] he's talking to them back then he
[52:03] used to give them watermelon but he was
[52:05] an infidel
[52:07] amen and
[52:09] one day the little girl was coming from
[52:12] sunday school
[52:14] amen i'ma say that again one day the
[52:16] little girl was coming from sunday
[52:19] school
[52:20] and he asked a little girl
[52:23] one day
[52:25] why do you waste your time
[52:28] on doing such a thing as that
[52:31] she said because she believed
[52:35] that there was a god
[52:37] and mr dorsey said
[52:40] that he said child
[52:41] you are so wrong to believe in such
[52:44] thing as that
[52:47] and said that the girl stooped down
[52:51] and picked up a little flower
[52:55] out of the ground
[52:57] pulled
[52:58] it from its petals and said mr dorsey
[53:03] could you tell me now how this lives
[53:09] there it was when he began to search
[53:12] back
[53:13] he could have said to the child well
[53:16] it's growing in the earth
[53:19] and then the question
[53:21] could have resolved back to where did
[53:23] the earth come from
[53:28] and did the seed get there
[53:31] how did it happen
[53:34] on and on and on and run it back
[53:37] until he seen
[53:39] now the great glamorous thing
[53:42] that we think about
[53:44] but it's so simple things that god is so
[53:48] real
[53:49] in its simplicity
[53:51] so it pleases god to reveal himself
[53:55] then hide himself
[53:58] then hide himself and reveal himself
[54:01] in the simple things
[54:04] puts over the top of the head of man
[54:08] because if you say why
[54:12] would a just god do that
[54:15] is because that man
[54:17] was made up
[54:19] in the beginning
[54:20] not to try to shift for himself
[54:23] a man was made to rely completely
[54:27] on god
[54:28] that's the reason
[54:30] we're likened unto lambs or sheep
[54:33] a sheep cannot lead himself
[54:36] he has to have a leader
[54:39] and the holy spirit is supposed to lead
[54:42] us
[54:43] so
[54:44] man has made that way
[54:48] so man is made that way
[54:50] and god made all of his work so simple
[54:54] that the simple simple can understand it
[54:58] and god makes himself simple
[55:00] that the simple in order to be
[55:04] understood
[55:06] the simple
[55:08] and otherwise he said in isaiah 35 i
[55:12] believe he said
[55:13] though a fool should not error it's so
[55:16] simple
[55:18] so we see
[55:20] that
[55:21] just a common flower
[55:25] a little girl picked up the flower
[55:28] and the flower
[55:30] was connected and the question of where
[55:33] did that flower come from
[55:37] how did it get there
[55:39] to display its beauty
[55:42] at that very hour
[55:45] that that man
[55:46] had that question
[55:48] and that little girl
[55:50] is walking by
[55:55] no doubt that seed
[55:58] was productionated before the foundation
[56:00] of the world
[56:02] that that flower would be there
[56:05] the life in that flower
[56:07] amen that came all the way from genesis
[56:11] amen and that flower had one purpose
[56:15] to be there
[56:16] as a witness
[56:22] praise
[56:23] god
[56:24] hidden in reveal
[56:26] in simplicity
[56:29] [Music]
[56:30] so your life
[56:32] the ups
[56:34] the downs
[56:36] earlier he was talking about that lily
[56:40] amen
[56:41] i go back to zebedee are you willing to
[56:43] drink of this cup
[56:46] are you willing to take this but that
[56:48] lily
[56:49] a man had to press
[56:52] her way through all of the monk
[56:55] all that was put on it she had to press
[56:57] away
[56:58] amen through the muck in the mirror to
[57:01] one day
[57:03] amen press through
[57:05] to reveal the beauty to to to to blossom
[57:09] and praise the
[57:10] lord that little flower
[57:14] had to press its way
[57:16] amen no doubt i don't know if the young
[57:19] girl was walking in a field on a
[57:20] sidewalk but that lily was right there
[57:23] in its position waiting to be used by
[57:26] god
[57:28] and i don't know where you come from in
[57:30] your background and where you've been
[57:32] and all of these kind of things and what
[57:33] you've been through
[57:37] but your time is now
[57:41] to stand up in the beauty of holiness
[57:44] to display the beauty and amen lift up
[57:47] your heads amen and give god praise that
[57:50] somebody
[57:51] can walk and see the beauty of your life
