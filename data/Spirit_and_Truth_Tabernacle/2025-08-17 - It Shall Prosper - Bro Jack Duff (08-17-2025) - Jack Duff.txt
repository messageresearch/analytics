Just some of the words of encouragement and strength that he gave us. But understand he's there in the hospital and he streams the services quite often and just asks the church just to pray for him. um he's having a he had a a surgery but they're still having a few complications. So I just want to remember him in prayer. Amen. His name is Stan. Father, we come in the name of Jesus on behalf of uh Reverend Dawson. God uh the surgery that he recently went through but now Father just having some complications from it. Uh we know that you are holding it all together and we ask that you would just move there in the hospital room. &gt;&gt; Father, whatever the issues are that they would be settled. We claim you to be our healer. We know, oh God, that you were wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our pieces upon you. And with your stripes, you said we're healed. So, Father, we speak that word over Reverend Dawson even right now that what the doctors and nurses can't do, we know you can do all things. So, we ask that you would intervene, Father, on his behalf. Show yourself strong, God. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's get our Bibles and we'll turn to a scripture this morning. Amen. So good to be back in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe David said, "I was glad &gt;&gt; when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Good things happen &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Strength can happen in the house of the Lord. Deliverance &gt;&gt; happens in the house of the Lord. And you can get your joy back &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Healing occurs &gt;&gt; in the house &gt;&gt; of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read a passage from uh Isaiah 55. Amen. And I only really want one verse out of it, but because the Bible's so good, &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the whole chapter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here in Isaiah 55, it says, "Ho everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye by and eat. Ye come by wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which it which satisfaith not. Hearken diligently unto me and eat ye e that which is good. And let your soul delight itself in fatness. I like that. Delight yourself in fatness. You know, at our meetings, I told everybody that God made them a promise. &gt;&gt; And his promise was that you was going to eat in plenty and be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Now, just because the meeting is over, &gt;&gt; don't mean that God's promises stop being manifested. &gt;&gt; That we can delight ourselves this morning in in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people. Behold, uh, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee, shall run unto thee, because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call ye upon him while he is near. uh let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. Uh for my thoughts are not your thoughts. Uh neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. And and I just need to inject we we need to get the thoughts of God &gt;&gt; in every circumstance and situation. We need the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in verse 10, "For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returnneeth not thither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may give seed to the swore, and bread to the eater. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to keep reading, but our title today is, it shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. It shall prosper. Verse 12 says, "For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Uh, instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree, and it shall be to the uh and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. The Lord a blessing to the reading of his word. Just quick word of prayer. Father, thank you for the reading of the word. May the Holy Spirit now uh bring clarity to what we've read and help us to apply this for where we are living. We take control over every spirit that's against your spirit. And Father, I ask that you would just uh anoint the ears of the hearers, the mouth of the speaker, God, that you would just get glory and honor from all that would happen in this place today. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. And you can be seated. Uh again, our title uh for today is it shall prosper. Amen. And just a little inspiration uh it won't return void. Amen. It won't return void. I've had a number of thoughts um crossing my mind and um um but I know kind of just some things that are coming up on the schedule and trying to place things properly. Uh so just ask the Lord just for a little something here today to kind of help us as we you know get into this next area. I I I believe restoration is still on us. I I believe overflow is still on us and uh you know we're just navigating the season, you know, the best we can. But um I I wanted to just drop this little thought in. Amen. Today as the Lord inspired it to me, uh I want to uh read from a quote out of Jehovah Gyra part two. Uh brother Brandham makes a statement here to us. He says, "Let me give you uh a scripture first." It says, "With with what we do, it must be scriptural." It says got to be scriptural. God won't honor nothing else. God won't honor a lie. God won't honor a lie. And I like that statement. If if Brother Brandham so far off, why was God honoring it? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about man honoring, but why was God honor? Because God won't honor a lie. &gt;&gt; All right? It says, you know, that you you couldn't attach that to him. He don't honor lies. He actually hate those that lie. Say he don't honor lies. He only honors his word. But he promised that my word will not return to me void. It it'll accomplish that which it was purposed for. And we see the word that's laotted today. No matter how much unbelief rises in the camp, God will honor his word when he find uh when he find faith to honor it by. And you know, as I was just meditating and thinking on these meetings that we just had, uh as we were approaching the meetings, we um were praying, you know, for the services. And one of the things that we knew the inspiration the Lord given us of our restored sayith the Lord, we knew somebody had to be restored, &gt;&gt; right? There was no way we could go into those meetings and not see restoration on the other side of it. &gt;&gt; And I believe we saw a lot of restoration &gt;&gt; and and not only not some of it has been complete, but some of it got started during the meeting. So we're going to see the completion of it. The seeds were sown during the meeting time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and and and when when when when God uh makes a promise in his word, we can we can uh uh uh we it's like putting money in the bank, &gt;&gt; right? We we can we can drop our weight on it knowing that what God has spoken to us, it cannot fall to the ground and return void. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God speaks something to you, it's got to accomplish. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may be delayed, &gt;&gt; right? But just because it's delayed doesn't mean that God forgot about his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be able to take God at his word and when he has said something, know that it shall come to pass. No matter what we see, no matter what we feel, no matter what we hear, if God said it, amen, it is already settled. Whether you believe it or not, it's still settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this word void, amen, simply in the Hebrew lexicon, it means uh when it says that it won't return void. It won't return empty, &gt;&gt; right? It won't it won't it won't be spoken just in vain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It there's a purpose behind what God speaks and and it's not going to just return to you empty or they say in an empty condition. My God, without effect. That's what they say. That word void is without effect. It's going to have an impact. That word uh when God's word goes forth, it will have an impact. This word prosper, I love that it shall prosper the in the thing where to send this word prosper, it simply means to to make progress, to succeed, to be profitable. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those are those are positive words to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not it it's not we're not going to lose with God. &gt;&gt; It's going to we're going to profit. We're going to succeed. We're going to advance. &gt;&gt; We're not going backward. No, not after the meetings. We're not going backward. &gt;&gt; Hey, we are going to prosper. Which means we are going to advance. We're going to go forward. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care what the opposition is, we are still going forward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, somebody. You're going forward in your finances. You're going forward in your business. You're going forward in your health. Praise God. You're going forward. Every aspect of your life, you're going forward. &gt;&gt; Hey, you don't have to receive it if you don't want it, but I'll take it. I'm going forward. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm going to advance. &gt;&gt; Amen. No retract and no subtract. No going back. Going forward. I only know one direction to go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Forward. Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to prosper. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is to advance. &gt;&gt; My God. And in order for these words to Amen. to to come alive in our life, God got to do something &gt;&gt; in order to bring his word to pass, he told us that it shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm just quoting what he said. I believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. He says um in this message, the impersonation of Christianity, he gives a a statement. He says, "Now Christ doesn't anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned back to him void." &gt;&gt; So God inspired minister with a message and he come out here and preach it. &gt;&gt; And you know you needed what that preacher said. &gt;&gt; God met you with the word that you needed at the time that you needed it. Don't just let the word fall to the ground. No, this word got to prosper. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My God. Brother Gwyn come here a few Wednesday nights ago and start telling us about a testimony of somebody giving him enough money to to uh to buy a house. No. No. We I don't know if we get what what what what people be saying to us. I'm not talking about somebody walking down the street and giving you $20 to get you a burger or something from Burger King. &gt;&gt; No. No. somebody comes along and says, "Here's 800,000." [Applause] &gt;&gt; And and and he's the second one I'm hearing from Zimbabwe with testimonies like that. &gt;&gt; I I I I met another brother, went to his house. &gt;&gt; I I I was there sitting in his house. They invited me over there and I say, "Okay, well, praise the Lord. Good to go to this brother house." Um and the Lord's called him home, Brother G, you know. Um, and we go there to the house and and they set us all in this one little room and probably when my god uh probably about big as this stage and we all sitting there in the room and and I'm like we all just kind of crammed up here, chairs everywhere, you know, and and they say, "Well, we just want to share the testimony with you how we got the house." I said, "Okay." And um I said, "Well, uh so the brother's sitting there." He says, "Yeah, I I was I'm a minister and and I went to uh uh Russia to minister and um I said, "Okay." He says, "And you know, they don't have many ministers there." So they was just looking for somebody to come in. So I got sent over to preach for these people and just have some service with them. I said, "Okay, praise the Lord." And it says, "And when um I finished ministering, the brother asked me, did my did my wife like candy and my family like candy?" And I said, "Yeah, yeah, they like candy." He says, he said, "Okay, just wait a second. I'm going to go get you some candy and and then, you know, you'll be able to go onto the gates to your uh catch your plane." So, they gave him, you know, the the the the bag of candy and uh this man uh the preacher had the bag of candy and he carried it from airport to airport because there was many flights that he had to catch to get back home to Zimbabwe. and he catches um you know one flight and and catches another flight and he has his bags that he's just took long and had gotten a bag of candy and uh he he told the stranger said I need to go to the restroom would you mind watching my bag for me and he says yeah sure I'll watch it man watch his bag of candy and his other bags and and while he used the restroom and he finally get all the way home and tired wool out and his wife says uh you know let me take all your bags and get you get you all set up why don't you go ahead and rest and and the wife said what's what's in that bag he say the preacher just sent y'all some candy. Y'all can have some candy. So, he went to lay down and the wife uh looked inside the bag and she say uh uh she said, "Honey, you said this was candy." And um he said, "Um it is." That's what the preacher told me again. Say, "No, this ain't candy. This ain't candy." And I say, "What?" He say uh she say this is more than candy. And when they counted the money, I think it's about $400,000 cash that was inside that bag that he let strangers watch. &gt;&gt; Well, there's there's there's something that we need to know right there. When God got something for you, &gt;&gt; brother, not even a stranger going to be able to take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And $400,000, I believe, cash that was in the bag. and and and the man had been praying for a house &gt;&gt; that God would provide him a house. One deal fell through. He didn't understand why it fell through, but God had given him enough cash from from a preacher, not a preacher, but a real estate agent that was in Russia that said, "The next preacher that come here, I'm going to give that preacher my tithing." &gt;&gt; And he had a commercial real estate deal that went through and was very, very uh lucrative. and he paid tithing on it and gave the man $400,000. Paid for his house in cash. &gt;&gt; And I'm sitting there in this and I thought this was all a house. &gt;&gt; And the brother said, "Now that you heard the testimony, let me walk you through the house." &gt;&gt; And as I started walking through the house, I said, "Oh my." &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, "Is he only God in Zimbabwe? [Applause] No, he not only God in Zimbabwe, brother, he's still God in West Palm Beach. And if you need blessings like that, God can give you blessings like that. Hey, if he speaks his word over you, it will not return void, but it shall prosper. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. I'm getting myself out here on a limb. &gt;&gt; It's time to elevate our thinking, &gt;&gt; brother. We ain't got to live beneath our privileges. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And I I'm not going to live beneath mine. If you want to live beneath yours, that's up to you. But I ain't living beneath mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I I done heard some powerful testimonies come out of Zimbabwe. &gt;&gt; Powerful. &gt;&gt; So, you know, I I I when I listen to these brothers say, "Well, my God, he he the same God. I just need to mix my faith in &gt;&gt; with what my need is, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to see God do exceeding the abundant above all I can ask or think." &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh God, help me. Let me try to stay on track here. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The brother brother preached a sermon I was listening to. He say uh brother Brandham was a poor man &gt;&gt; with two houses. Let me let me say &gt;&gt; brother Brandham was a poor man &gt;&gt; with two houses &gt;&gt; and multiple cars, &gt;&gt; but he was a poor man. &gt;&gt; Don't you forget that &gt;&gt; he was a poor man. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, what would a rich man look like? If a poor man got two houses, &gt;&gt; he had one in Jeffersonville and he had one out in in in Arizona, &gt;&gt; right? Did he have it? &gt;&gt; He was a poor man. &gt;&gt; All right, let me just keep on reading. Now, Christ doesn't uh uh anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned back to him void. &gt;&gt; But he expects you to receive the word. &gt;&gt; And in receiving the word, in receiving the word, be ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's that's a key thing now. &gt;&gt; Be ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ready to do something with what you got. You know it it it and let me tell you the first thing that need to change. Amen. Is is your faith. &gt;&gt; God can change situations just like that. But it's your faith. You got to mix it with the word that's coming to you. And that's how things start changing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the word of God that created everything we have right now. That seat you sitting in was created by the word of God. That car you driving in to get here created by the word of God. Right. Everything we have by the word of God. It starts with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And once you mix faith with the word, then you'll see results. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Oh my Lord, I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to just I'm trying to just stay in this channel, but I I I just when you hear of other people being blessed and you realize there's something that I'm missing, &gt;&gt; something I'm missing. How How is this brother walking like this? How how why is they business like this? Lord have mercy. I'm going back to Zimbabwe again. &gt;&gt; I'm on my way back to Zimbabwe. I'm &gt;&gt; We were We were We were invited to go to a house for dinner. Pastor said, "Yeah, we're going to take you down to this brother's house." And says, "Okay, all right. No problem. We'll we happily, you know, go and and uh and fellowship with them." So when we pulled up on the property, fenced in like um um uh concrete fence all around. And uh so there were two houses on the property and one of them was like look like about four bedroomedroom, you know, uh four bedroomedroom uh threeb home, you know, nice size house. I say, "Oh, that's this where the the saints live." And that's me. I'm always talking ahead of time. Oh, this where the saints live. Praise the Lord. That's good. The pastor said, "No, that's where the workers live. The brother lives over over here." I looked at that house, it was a mini hotel, three levels. And as you walked up the steps of this house, I said, "Oh, Lord." I said, "Now they telling us in Florida that there's hungry people over here that need our money. We the ones hungry. We need we need this. &gt;&gt; I couldn't believe my eyes. I asked the pastor. I said, "What what you do for a living?" I said, "At first," I said, "How how many how many saints in your church?" I mean, uh, how big is a church? He said, "I got a small church." I said, he said, "About a thousand people. Well, that was he was small because the pastor that took me there had about 6,000 people in his church. So, he knew that that's why he called it small. I said, "Well, what do you do?" He say, "I sell oil to nations." &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He not just selling oil to this one little gas station. &gt;&gt; No, the nations need oil. and I sell oil to the nations. &gt;&gt; Now, what you think his bank account looked like? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to sell? Wouldn't you just like one transaction like that? &gt;&gt; It can happen. &gt;&gt; It can happen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; This ain't just for people over there. We need to hear testimonies like this right in our midst. &gt;&gt; We got to take this word and do something with it. &gt;&gt; Look at this. Oh Lord have mercy. God help me. And he says he he expects you to receive the word and then receiving the word. Be ready. Take that old cow hide you've been living in over there in that old former condition and swap it off for a sheep skin that's flexible to the word of God and everything the Bible says you'll say &gt;&gt; amen. But it come it it must come from the Bible for the new wine only fermentss uh for the for the new wine only fermentss wine. It only verifies the elements that's in there. The yeast only presses forth the bulb of the alcohol which makes it a bursting profession. As the yeast burst is it it's little bubble to make it a more perfect to give it uh the better taste to give it a better substantial holding to make it more stronger to make it so it can sour. Amen. So here he says the minister is not coming to preach something and God anoint them with something and then have that return void. All that we heard in the meetings, God ain't letting that return void. &gt;&gt; No, it's going to prosper. &gt;&gt; It's going to prosper. &gt;&gt; It will not return void. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's go on a little further here. Amen. In this message, God's provided place for worship. The prophet makes a statement. It says, "God's only provided plan for any age in his word. His son came and manifested every promise that was promised for his age." Jesus manifested every promise that was promised for his age. All the prophets came just exactly on time. Uh they was God's word living on earth. They was the word. Jesus said uh that they were gods. Jesus called them prophets. Those prophets gods. A man met me in the last meeting. He said, "You are a poor theologian." Uh he says, "And I said, I don't claim to be one." I said, "The word don't come to to a theologian. Theology does. &gt;&gt; The word uh word comes see I said just theology comes to a theologian." But I said, "We're talking about something else." And he says, "Now we find that in each age when God said a certain thing would happen, here come that man along and manifested that. Here come their people along and lived that that was God himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word." See? So, so when we say it shall not return void or it shall prosper, somebody's got to be an answer to God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. When God allow allows a minister to pick it up and preach it to you, somebody got to mix their faith with it so they can become the answer to that word. &gt;&gt; I want to be an answer to the word. &gt;&gt; I want to be the fulfillment of God's promise. I want to see I want to see advancement and prosperity. I want to see that in my life. &gt;&gt; If he said it shall prosper, then let it prosper. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah, church. Amen. He goes on to say this. Says um now God's only provided way and only provided plan today is his son uh through his word for this age quickened by the spirit of life quicken. Now, uh, and I know this this quote can be tied in so many different ways, especially when God sends a man, we know God sent us a prophet. And, um, in order to have a prophet, uh, just like in the days of the Lord Jesus, when Jesus came, God had to have somebody on the earth that would believe who he was, &gt;&gt; Peter happened to be one of them people that believed who he was, &gt;&gt; right? and and and and and in this day when God would send his word through uh the ministry of William Brandham, uh there have to be somebody on earth that would have to believe that that was God sending his prophet. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah. That's God sending you, which is me. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll be honest. Amen. If uh I'm glad that God put you in the scripture because that include all of us. &gt;&gt; But he could have wrote it like this. Behold, I send Jack Dove, Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God already knew that Jack Duff was going to believe who Elijah was. &gt;&gt; I hope you can put your name in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But since he put you, that included all of us. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, now here's the thing. Amen. Uh that I want to just kind of uh uh get from this because God have to have somebody on the earth that would believe. Now this this believe uh I was just kind of looking at the scripture, these signs shall follow them that believe, right? And and and and I just went to the um the the Greek lexicon to just kind of get the meaning of that. And in the Greek lexicon, that word believe means to commit unto uh to to to put in trust with uh to commit to one's trust. Another definition to think to be true, to be persuaded, to credit, place confidence in. Amen. Uh and and and I also got uh another dictionary that I was looking in, my key to the Bible dictionary. And that that word believe means to credit or to to credit a record or report as true. So when when I say I believe, amen, I might hear something and even though I wasn't there, &gt;&gt; my God, &gt;&gt; I still believe that's true. &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Uh, I was recently just listening to a tape in my car and uh and I heard brother Brandham telling a story of him flying in a plane and somehow as they were flying in the plane uh over Tennessee uh the plane got grounded because of some mechanical issue &gt;&gt; and uh they couldn't explain what was going on but actually it was more than a mechanical issue. It was a spiritual issue. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a physical issue. &gt;&gt; And there was a woman that had a prayer. &gt;&gt; And she her prayer was strong enough to cause a plane to come down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz she had a question for God. &gt;&gt; And her question said, "Lord, I I I'm your sunomite. I can identify myself in the scripture." She said, "But where is your Elijah? I I I'm a shootite, but where is your Elijah? Had no idea that Elijah was flying right over the top of her city. And it just so happened that God would make this this plane settle down in her city, &gt;&gt; put the prophet in a hotel that would cause him to walk through a certain neighborhood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While he's singing, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them. had no idea why he was walking. But the Holy Spirit, cuz those that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. The Holy Spirit said, "Keep walking." &gt;&gt; And as he kept walking, he passed the house singing. And the lady was standing there. &gt;&gt; She said, "Good morning, Parson." &gt;&gt; He said, "How you know I'm a preacher?" He wasn't carrying a Bible. He wasn't doing that. But how do you know I'm a preacher? Say, "God showed me that you was coming." That same God lives today. I'm telling you right now &gt;&gt; begin to tell a situation. I got a son that got wrapped up with amen the wrong uh wrong in the wrong crowd and now he's in here laying here dying. And I don't need him to to be made whole. Amen. Physically, but I just want to know that his soul is saved. &gt;&gt; She said, "You ever heard of my minister? My my ministry say he see she say no I never heard of you. Never heard of you. Say but I did ask God where his Elijah was &gt;&gt; and he sent you. &gt;&gt; They went in that house and they begin to pray. And brother Brandham said you pray first. He said by the time he say that sister prayed. He said tears was all over his eyes. He said I ain't never heard nobody pray like that before. &gt;&gt; He says then he prayed and while the boy was in the house saying it's dark in here. It's dark in here in that bed. It's dark in here. It's dark in here. And he say he say all of a sudden but when he finished praying the boy said, "It's light in here. It's light in here. It's light in here." And brother Brandham got into the car and took off, got a cab and made it to the uh airport and caught his flight and he was gone. Now I'm going to tell you something. I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; You weren't there either. &gt;&gt; We weren't in We weren't in Memphis, Tennessee. &gt;&gt; None of us was nowhere around. Some of us weren't even born. But when I heard the story, &gt;&gt; something on the inside of me &gt;&gt; agreed with that story. And that's why I say I believe I ain't got to be there to believe it. If it sound like something God will do, brother, I believe it, sister. I believe it. And ain't nothing you going to do to take that from me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there when he opened the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. I just read it in the Bible &gt;&gt; and I heard another preacher talk about it before &gt;&gt; and I I wasn't there. But you know what? I believe it. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there when ar Pharaoh's army drowned in the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; but I believe it. I was nowhere to be found &gt;&gt; when they threw them three Hebrew boys in a fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; I I was not around. &gt;&gt; But they told me about it. &gt;&gt; And for some reason, &gt;&gt; come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; I believe it, &gt;&gt; brother. Whether I was there or not, I still believe it. And God had to have somebody on the earth with that type of faith &gt;&gt; that whether they were there or not, they still believe &gt;&gt; because his word can't return void. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there to see Daniel go in the lion's den and come out the next day. &gt;&gt; But they told me that Daniel went in, &gt;&gt; he came out unharmed. And then they say the people that came up with this scheme got thrown in the lion's den after Daniel. &gt;&gt; They never came out. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; But I believe it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there to see Jesus walk the earth &gt;&gt; and all the miracles that he did and all that's recorded in the Bible. I was not there &gt;&gt; physically. I wasn't there. But I believe Jesus came. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe Jesus died &gt;&gt; and I believe Jesus rose again. &gt;&gt; I went there, &gt;&gt; but I believe it. &gt;&gt; I was there in none of the brother Brandham's meetings. I didn't attend one. Not one. &gt;&gt; He was gone before I was born. &gt;&gt; But when I heard about what God did in that man's ministry, And I heard some of the testimonies that came forth. I could line those testimonies up with what was happening in scripture. &gt;&gt; And I say, I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; But I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got confidence in it. &gt;&gt; I'm committed to it. &gt;&gt; I put my trust in it. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to believe. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I think it to be true. All right. &gt;&gt; It just sound like something God will do. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Here we we we we we uh let me read a quote and then maybe I'll try to jump through the scripture here. out of three kinds of believers. And brother Random is is taken um his thought for three kinds of believer taken from the scripture out of John 6 and and I I I'll catch that first in a second. John 6 uh and get ready verse 66. Just get that prepared. But um what happened here in John 6 is that Jesus was talking to the people that day and he made a statement. He says uh unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me. He took a sermon very difficult difficult uh subject because he knew that it would be misunderstood by the people. And that's why you have to be so careful when you come to church. Uh make sure that you in the right channel because you can misunderstand something. &gt;&gt; You can miss it if the devil got you off in left field somewhere. You can really miss what God trying to tell you. So make sure you're in the right channel so that you catch what God saying. And that way it don't throw you off cuz cuz Jesus said, "Sless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no part." They said, "Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no." They told us this man was a little little. It went right to their mind what people said about him. They told us that he he not he not he ain't got it all together. He he he kind of off a little bit. He he teach false doctrine. They told us this. They told us watch out for this. Eat his flesh. Drink his blood. &gt;&gt; Is he think we what do he think about us? So, so the, so the Bible, the Bible, you know, said what happened there in John 666. After the people heard this sermon in John 666, it says, "From that time, many of his disciples went back." &gt;&gt; Now, after one sermon, they they forgot about all the miracles. Some of their mamas had been healed. Some of their daddies had been healed. They forgot about all the good things that God had did and they went back. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. When the word is prospering, it doesn't go back. &gt;&gt; The word advances. &gt;&gt; Believers will advance with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said he says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. And here in John 6:67 it says, "Then said Jesus unto the 12, we also go away." Now here's the here's the here's the thing because when in John 666 they walk I mean I mean now notice the scripture say disciples left. &gt;&gt; These were key individuals. And if I could just put it this way, these were people that cast out devils in his name. &gt;&gt; He had given them power to cast out devils. sent them out two by two. But when they heard one sermon, &gt;&gt; oh my God, it shook them. &gt;&gt; Don't let one sermon take you out. &gt;&gt; Don't let just one. Don't don't don't. Now, when you're a believer, I'm telling you, one sermon can't take you out. &gt;&gt; Not not one. No, it's going to take a lot more than that. I I I I'm We too We too quick to pull the trigger. &gt;&gt; Heard No, just give him a break. Hold on. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. You know, somebody did that to the prophet when he when he quoted uh uh I think 700 rather than 7,000. I mean, oh, he said it wrong. Now, don't be so quick to be jumping like that. &gt;&gt; That's the devil that got you anointed like that. &gt;&gt; But believers can't be shook by just anything. &gt;&gt; Give the man time to explain what he talking about. And even if he don't explain it, &gt;&gt; because Jesus never explained, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Never explained it. But here comes, you know, these 70 that done cast out devil. He say he they say, "Well, you know what? I I knew something was wrong here. I'm gone. I'm I'm out. I'm out right here." And then the next verse, he looks and he asked uh the disciples that was left, will you also go away? It was about 82 people in church. 70 the majority walked out. 12 left. And he asked them just looked at and I mean Jesus wasn't in tears. Jesus wasn't uh depressed. Jesus was not I mean he just he looked at the other 12. Will you also go &gt;&gt; because he wanted to see what was in them? &gt;&gt; And and and see believers got this extra thing on the inside of them that it's going to take a little bit more than that. Like like my auntie my auntie sung it. She say it's going to take &gt;&gt; but she was she she just she was she got we got caught in a hurricane. and and and them hurricane force winds you got to be careful with. It'll take your house away. &gt;&gt; But but when she made it through the hurricane, God gave us some. She said, "It's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a stronger wind than this &gt;&gt; to keep this eagle down." &gt;&gt; You got to understand something about eagles. They don't get affected by the storm. Not not eagles. They they made different than any other bird. A eagle has the ability to get himself above the storm and ride that thing out. Come on eagles. I know you got some storms in your life, but get up, mount them wings, and get up above the storm. Ride that thing out. Praise God. Ride out that financial storm. Ride out that storm in your health. Ride it out in the name of Jesus. Set your wings and fly. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We got to know that we big and better than that. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. I ain't I'm not going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; Brother West Brother West Wesco is singing. I will not be defeated. No, I won't. &gt;&gt; All All the All them uh what do they call them words? No. And won't and uh two two they're like two negative words. I forget what they're not negative and how a double negative something like that. You're not you're not supposed to put that in a sentence. &gt;&gt; No, I won't. But for believers, &gt;&gt; we know exactly what that mean. &gt;&gt; And brother Brother Wesco made a run out of that thing. No, I won't. &gt;&gt; No, I won't. Now, I'm telling you, when you get it in your spirit like that, it don't matter what the devil doing. No, I won't. I ain't going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; I ain't going down. I'm advancing. I'm moving forward. &gt;&gt; Woo! Jesus. My God. &gt;&gt; But here he he he puts them in a situation with believers. And and now now look, you identify yourself based on your own actions and reactions. &gt;&gt; The the makeeliever was in this group. The unbeliever was in this group. &gt;&gt; And the true believer was in this group. Now, now, now, now you see the the unbelievers, they showed themselves soon as he said, "Eat my flesh, drink my blood," they didn't wait to get no explanation. They just took off. &gt;&gt; They just walked with him no more. I mean, never came back to church. &gt;&gt; The makeeliever was Judas. He actually stayed there &gt;&gt; to see what was going to happen. But he knew. And this why Jesus could say, you know, I know I see all 12 of y'all, but one of y'all still ain't right. &gt;&gt; And God, he said, "This guy just make believe, right?" But but but but the true believer, &gt;&gt; even after he saw everybody leave, &gt;&gt; huh? Even even after they heard about the negative websites, &gt;&gt; even after they they even they see they see friends and family members getting impacted by it. &gt;&gt; Huh? But a true believer &gt;&gt; ain't got his eyes on none of that. &gt;&gt; My eyes is on the word. &gt;&gt; I didn't have to be there to believe it. &gt;&gt; If if he said some men died off a bridge, &gt;&gt; I ain't got to go searching Google. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; If he said he didn't get a black bear, I I ain't got none. I just believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. what that got to do with the message &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to tell you the message is not about the testimonies. &gt;&gt; The testimonies is only to build your faith. &gt;&gt; And and and it's to build your faith to to prove one thing. The the theme of brother Brandham's ministry was Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We needed to know that the same Jesus of the Bible still lives today. He said that God gave him three squirrels two different times. You don't have to show me the squirrels. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; But I believe it. &gt;&gt; Abraham was in a mountain. &gt;&gt; It's and God told him offer his son. And Abraham while he was preparing to offer Isaac, God spoke say,"Abraham, I know you believe me now." &gt;&gt; He says, "You know what? Stay your hand, Abraham. I have provided a ram in the bush &gt;&gt; in order to you to sacrifice that ram rather than sacrifice your son. I was &gt;&gt; I was nowhere near that mountain. &gt;&gt; I I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; You wasn't either." That's right. But &gt;&gt; you cannot tell me that Abraham didn't try to offer Isaac &gt;&gt; and that a ram showed up in his place &gt;&gt; because in the scripture it actually said Abraham when I I said now daddy I see wood I see this I see this I see all now where's the sacrifice Abraham said the Lord will provide himself &gt;&gt; that's what brother Solomon told me say not for himself the Lord will provide himself &gt;&gt; and you You know that that belief is so strong. That belief is so strong. I know it happened. I wasn't there, but I you couldn't take it from me. &gt;&gt; Abraham tried to offer Isaac and God provided a ram. &gt;&gt; I'm standing on that. &gt;&gt; Come to find out when I got to Israel, the the uh tour guide said, "Welcome to Mariah." I said, "No, we going to Jerusalem, my friend." They all said, "We're going to Jerusalem." He says, "Yeah, welcome to Mariah." I said, "You realize what you're saying?" He said, "Yeah, I know exactly what I'm saying. I'm I'm from Israel. I I know what I'm talking about here. Welcome to Mariah. My first time in Israel. I'm trying to correct him." I said, "Well, where's Calvary?" He said, "Just up the hill over there." I said, "Now, see, I I don't know nothing about just up the hill. I ain't never been here before. I don't even know what the up the hill mean. He said, "Just up the hill." I said, "Okay, all right. I got something for you." I pull out my phone. I say, "How far is Mariah from Calvary?" And Google came back and said, "It's a fourminute walk." And right there in that moment, I said, "You mean to tell me that Abraham brought Isaac to the same mountain where Jesus Christ himself would die?" &gt;&gt; Before I even knew that, I believe Abraham had offered Isaac. But when I found out it was the same mountain &gt;&gt; and not only that, then I found out the prophet said he read it and when he read that statement in a book, he took off running around. He say even if it ain't true, &gt;&gt; even if it ain't true, &gt;&gt; what a wonderful God we serve &gt;&gt; to see how perfect God could be. &gt;&gt; I was nowhere to be found. I wasn't there. I wasn't there. I wasn't there. But I believe all that. I was reading something and I don't Oh, okay. Uh I was telling you these three kind of believers when the next verse uh in John 668 God he had asked them where you also go. He was just doing this to set them up to see what their response was going to be. And look, look at Simon Peter. See, God gonna always have one &gt;&gt; and this one will be judgment to everybody else. But this one, Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, &gt;&gt; pretty much uh go where? &gt;&gt; What? What? What you mean go?" &gt;&gt; Now, didn't you see your cousin and your uncle and all these other people just left? Will you also go? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Huh? He said, "To whom shall we go? Where am I going?" "This right here, &gt;&gt; these are the words &gt;&gt; of eternal life." &gt;&gt; And and Peter said this without even having an understanding of what eat my flesh and drink my blood was. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't know what the thunders are, &gt;&gt; do you still believe? If you don't even know what the seals are. Do you still believe? &gt;&gt; God has done enough. Amen. To settle our faith. &gt;&gt; Well, we know there's nowhere else to go. &gt;&gt; This right here has eternal life. Your life couldn't even be changed by nothing else. You know that &gt;&gt; your life couldn't be there's not enough power out there to keep you. You know that. &gt;&gt; You know that. But there's just something about the power that's inside this word. Cuz this word that we have, this revealed word we have, &gt;&gt; is the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; And rapturing faith is found in these books and in these tapes. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. All right, let me move on. I'm I'm way out of my area, but God knows here. Um the message um three kind of believers actually I can probably skip on let me move on let me go to have not I sent thee there is I just got no I got a scripture I want to read 2 Chronicles 20 now uh I Want to just throw this out here. I was going to stop at 2s 2020, but I think I want to read a little bit more than that. Uh, church, it's something about being a believer. And and as I was just just thinking on this subject, that song just kept hitting me. Yes, I'm a believer. I'm a believer. And as I was telling everyone on the night of worship, people can write songs and to them it it has a meaning which you know we can identify with what they're singing because I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. Uh most people think that the battle is against like you know people that believe in Buddha, people that believe in Krishna and u you know just all the other uh false gods that they have and and they they just they're steadily trying to fight that battle, right? But um the battle's greater than that because even in Christianity there are so many different crazy beliefs. Um many believe in three gods. They believe in the father, they believe in the son, they believe in the holy ghost. Even though the Bible say the Lord our God is one, they still believe in three gods and call themselves Christians, right? And and so we have to there there's so much even in Christianity that that that must be battled. And then on top of that, when you get to the message, there's other people with crazy things in the message that you got to weed your way through. And remember, brother Brandham said that in in um in uh I believe Luther's day, he says the miracle was Luther having the ability to keep his head above fanaticism. &gt;&gt; And look, that ain't stopping Luther's day. That's still here today. We got to be able to keep our head above fanaticism. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because fanaticism is coming to the message. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my. just just so much. Um, but in 2 Coronicles chapter 20, I think what I want to do is read um let me start at verse 13, I believe. Yeah, verse 13. All right. Says, um, "And Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Then upon Jehazio, the son of Zechariah, the son of Beni Baniah, the son of Jael, the son of Ma uh Mataniah, uh, a Levite of the sons of Asaf, came the spirit of the Lord, in the midst of the congregation, and he said, "Hearken ye all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou, King Jehoshaphat, thus sayeth the Lord unto you, be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but gods. Tomorrow go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by uh the cliff of Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Jeru. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. &gt;&gt; Set yourselves. &gt;&gt; Stand ye still. Now, now, now, here's the thing. Even though you don't need to fight, you still got to show up. &gt;&gt; That's right. And and not only not only show up, show up dressed for battle. &gt;&gt; Have your your sword, &gt;&gt; your shield, &gt;&gt; your shoes girded, &gt;&gt; right? I mean I mean you you need to, you know, just just be ready for battle now. You ain't going to have to fight, but show up and look like you going to battle. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. &gt;&gt; Show up with your uniform on now. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Right. All right. And it says, "Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you. Oh Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against him for the Lord will be with you." And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping uh worshiping the Lord. And the Levites of the children of of Corites and of the children of the Korites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. Brother, not no quiet voice. They came ready. &gt;&gt; They came ready to sing. They came ready to rejoice. They They was praising their God. &gt;&gt; Not only did God hear him, but the devil could hear him, too. It says, "And they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of Torah. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, me, oh Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God. So shall ye be established." Now, that's how you get established. But believe his prophets, and so shall ye prosper. That's how you advance is when you believe his prophets. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can I just Can I just speak this over you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe this. When you believe his prophets, it say so shall you prosper. I'm going to keep reading there. Just let me let me just uh speak this. I'm going You going to prosper physically. &gt;&gt; You going to prosper spiritually. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper &gt;&gt; financially &gt;&gt; and you're going to prosper materially. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was a poor man &gt;&gt; with two houses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper physically. &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper spiritually. &gt;&gt; You're going to prosper financially. And you're going to prosper materially. That's right. &gt;&gt; Believe in the Lord your God, &gt;&gt; so shall you be established, &gt;&gt; but believe as prophets, so shall ye prosper. &gt;&gt; Let's keep on reading. &gt;&gt; Now, the spirit of the Lord had just come upon this man and he prophesied about them not having to fight in battle. Now, all they had to do is just believe that. Just now and again, believe that that that that sounds right. that prophecy what he just gave sounds right. It agrees with my spirit and my inner man says says amen to that. &gt;&gt; We've had different experiences right here in our church. Tongues go forth and then somebody would speak the interpretation of the tongue. And one of them specifically told us open wide your mouth and then it said open it wider and wider and wider and I will fill it. That sounds right to me. &gt;&gt; That s that clicks with my spirit and I'm open my mouth really wide. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for just uh the same God that provide big things. &gt;&gt; He provide little things. &gt;&gt; Why not believing for big things? &gt;&gt; Why? Why we got to limit them? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah. I'm My business gonna be so blessed. I'mma hire people. I'm going have them working for me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be a blessing to them &gt;&gt; and they families &gt;&gt; and their family families. If they need benefits, I'm going to offer benefits. &gt;&gt; If they need a 401k, &gt;&gt; I'mma be able to offer 401k. We're going to be able to do these things. &gt;&gt; I'm not just looking for something just to meet my needs. I'm looking for overflow. Huh? You think you think Microsoft is just meeting their needs? &gt;&gt; You think Apple is just meeting their needs? &gt;&gt; No. They they in overflow mode. &gt;&gt; My business going to be traded &gt;&gt; in the market. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all ain't. &gt;&gt; And when I get ready to sell my business because I really don't want to work no more, &gt;&gt; I'm going to claim millions. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe may maybe maybe maybe other people don't believe that, but Lord, I say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just Look, y'all, I we need to get around some people that that think different than we do. &gt;&gt; A lot of us want to just get a job just to meet our needs. &gt;&gt; God wants you to think beyond that. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go beyond that. I mean, don't just get the job, be the boss of the job. &gt;&gt; And and if and everybody in here, let me tell you this right now. Everybody in there can start their own business. &gt;&gt; You got something that you passionate about and you can start a business out of that. &gt;&gt; God will send people from all over the world to you. &gt;&gt; Give give God can give you an idea that that people all over the world will need it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you won't just be thinking about just the people in your little network. &gt;&gt; God God network bigger than your network &gt;&gt; cuz sometime we get jobs and all they want us to think about is now who go to your church &gt;&gt; and who do who who in your family? No, no, no, no, no. I need No, I'm talking about God's family, not my family. I need to touch all of them &gt;&gt; and God can give me an idea that'll touch all of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some sister might come up with a hair product &gt;&gt; that many sisters need all over the world. &gt;&gt; Huh. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Some decoration for the hair. And all the sisters need it. &gt;&gt; Anything God can do. &gt;&gt; Take the limits off of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Look. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. I I this this this scripture verse 21 says, "And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness." And I say, "Praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever." When they began to sing and and to praise the Lord and to praise, the Lord sent ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seier, which were come against Judah, and they were smitten. But the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seier, utterly to slay and destroy them. When they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seier, everyone helped to destroy another. So they began to fight each other while while while while the children of Israel just standing there with they they uh their uniforms on &gt;&gt; and they fighting each other. And can I just say this? Maybe you got something going on in your job. &gt;&gt; You got multiple people coming against you because the Bible say that you shall prosper. &gt;&gt; That don't mean you're going to lose the job. &gt;&gt; You're going to keep the job. Don't call out. Just show up. And when you show up, &gt;&gt; them people that's fighting against you might find themselves fighting against each other &gt;&gt; because they got a fighting spirit. &gt;&gt; You don't have a fighting spirit. You got a be still spirit. &gt;&gt; A be still and know that I am God's spirit. &gt;&gt; So let them fight it out. &gt;&gt; They might end up with no job and then you have their job. &gt;&gt; Don't call out sick. Go to work. &gt;&gt; Show up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at this now where verse 23. For the children of Amman and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir uh utterly slay and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another. And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude. And behold, there were dead bodies fallen to the earth. None escaped. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Now, because all these dead bodies cannon escape, this means that there's goods. Army can't be out there and have no food and and have no money and have I mean, they got to have something, &gt;&gt; but since there's dead bodies everywhere, &gt;&gt; they can't spend it. they can't eat it. &gt;&gt; And and they went from running and being afraid to just trusting the word of a prophet. &gt;&gt; And by trusting the word of a prophet, the Bible said, you believe God now, you're going to be established. &gt;&gt; But if you can believe his prophets, you're gonna prosper. &gt;&gt; Here it is. Watch this. Now watch, watch, watch, watch what happens now. Verse 25. When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them an abundance, &gt;&gt; both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; They not stealing. This not this is not stealing. These are dead people that can't use it. They can't use it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing these people can do with this. &gt;&gt; And if I don't get it, somebody else going to come get it. &gt;&gt; So since I'm here, &gt;&gt; I might as well get what God got for me. &gt;&gt; And I love the scripture. I mean they they they they had precious jewels &gt;&gt; which they stripped off of themselves more than they could carry away. &gt;&gt; It was so much &gt;&gt; and they were three days and gather. Can you imagine that? Going and there's more back. Here's more of that. But I can't carry no more. go and take this and I put it in whatever and then I come back and ain't nobody come to touch none of my stuff. &gt;&gt; I'm just here to tell you when God got something for you, &gt;&gt; ain't nobody can take it from you. &gt;&gt; And I believe this is a season &gt;&gt; that God has for us. And there is nobody or nothing going to take it from us. We shall prosper. &gt;&gt; We're going to advance. We're not going back. We're going forward. &gt;&gt; I'mma be a poor man &gt;&gt; with two houses. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why you just believing God for one house? &gt;&gt; Why you just stopping there? And you Airbnb everybody else house. Airbnb your own house. &gt;&gt; Everybody else doing it all around you. &gt;&gt; And how are they getting into it and you can't get into it? There are so many ways to make money. &gt;&gt; There there's so many ways to make money. Or go to the Airbnb uh site and you can look to see what people are are actually renting. Look to see the the those that's getting the top um the top stars. I mean people people not only Airbnb uh being houses but &gt;&gt; they can you can uh tour your car. &gt;&gt; You can buy a second car &gt;&gt; and turo the car. &gt;&gt; You can rent your car out for people to be able to drive and they pay you. There is so many ways to make money without you going out there and working hard. &gt;&gt; My daddy used to say, "Let your money go to work for you." &gt;&gt; You always working for money. Let your money now go to work for you. Buy a car as an investment. &gt;&gt; Now, let me tell you another thing. I'm I'm all out here now. I'm all out here. But but but but when you when you when you when you get your tour business going real good and they just you know pretty much they paying you especially if you done paid the car off &gt;&gt; and you they they paying you now you can take the money that you're making in Turo and go buy yourself another car. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can lease it. &gt;&gt; It's a business expense. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And now you can drive in your business expense and somebody else is paying for it. &gt;&gt; But now make sure you put enough money in the bank &gt;&gt; that if something go wrong with the car, you can go buy another one and keep it going. &gt;&gt; Now what if you had two or three cars out there like that? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you getting out. Work work smarter, &gt;&gt; not harder. &gt;&gt; And move up from a car to a house. And you ain't got to buy a house. You can buy an apartment in a real nice place. &gt;&gt; And people come just rent that apartment all the time. And and and all year round, especially, you know, uh what they spring break time. Oh, put the price up on it because people the kids going to want it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Holiday time. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm &gt;&gt; I'm talking about prospering. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about advancing. And and this is for believers. &gt;&gt; This for believers. &gt;&gt; We believe it's prophet &gt;&gt; and it say we going to pro we going we have already prospered spiritually. &gt;&gt; We know that. We know. I mean you can I'm sorry. We done &gt;&gt; the Lord done blessed us. We got eyes to see and ears to hear. We done pro prospered spiritually. &gt;&gt; But what about materially? &gt;&gt; What about financially? Amen. &gt;&gt; What about what about these other areas? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and some of us might be in a spot where we done prosper, you know, financially, &gt;&gt; but maybe you need to prosper spiritually, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And God has promised you that you're going to prosper spiritually. I done lost my place here on on this. But but you going and when when I when I'm quot I'm actually quoting a it's a direct quote from the prophet when I say that he said grow physically, spiritually, financially, and materially. So you might you might have already prospered financially, but what about what about the other areas? And sometimes we get one blessing and think that's all God got. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We ain't done yet. We ain't done yet. We ain't done yet. Lord, I I was I was just I asked brother Solomon for these u services and I haven't listened to them all but over in Dubai had some meetings last year and and and I was just listening and one of the pastors he say I'm I'm I'm inviting a brother to come to the pull pit to preach and um I'm not embarrassed to say this about this man. He's coming here to preach. But this man, God has blessed him. He's a millionaire. Y'all listen to him preach. Y'all going to be listening to a millionaire talk. Now, now he didn't have to say that. But I'm glad he did. I'm glad he did. I'm like, uh, what? The man not coming to preach to us? not only him but he his sons and everything else just flowed from this man every everybody blessed in his house and I thought to myself said wait a minute we we living a little bit too and now now it didn't change the way he preached &gt;&gt; what what but what he did do is try to show you that you can have the same thing if you would apply the same faith &gt;&gt; and I thought to myself is God only moving in Zimbabwe &gt;&gt; I said no God ain't just a God of Zimbabwe God is God right here And if we need these things, God gonna move and and and and do things for us. I I'm just I just believe that. But it got to start with a word. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you through the word of God and God honors his word, whatever you're doing, it shall prosper. Can I read Psalms one over you? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm running out of time. &gt;&gt; Can I read Psalms one over you? &gt;&gt; I done lost my notes, but I'm going to read I'mma just read Psalms. I I don't have this in my notes, so I need you to pull this up for me, sis. Psalms one. And I'm I'm out of time. Let me just go ahead and stop this thing right now, &gt;&gt; but I'm going just read Psalms one. Blessed is the man or the woman &gt;&gt; that walketh not &gt;&gt; in the counsel &gt;&gt; of the ungodly, &gt;&gt; nor standeth &gt;&gt; in the way of sinners, &gt;&gt; nor siteth &gt;&gt; in the seat of the scornful. What you going to do with this sermon after you heard it today? You going to go home and criticize it and and what you going to do? Are you going to take it and apply some faith? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jack is trying to excite us. No. No. I No. I want the best for you. &gt;&gt; And God wants the best for you. And God will anoint a minister with a sermon in order to pull out your best. &gt;&gt; Verse two. &gt;&gt; But his delight, now this is this is the beautiful part. A millionaire come to the pool pit, but the money ain't changed them. Some of us the reason God can't give us nothing, &gt;&gt; we'll be on vacation. &gt;&gt; Pastor, I there's a trip I've been wanting to take all my life &gt;&gt; and and I'mma have to miss this Sunday &gt;&gt; and be gone two weeks &gt;&gt; because you go all the way on the other side of the world. It's hard to just do that in one week. So you you go two weeks and then then all of a sudden you get back for one service and then two weeks later you're gone again. &gt;&gt; Don't you have an office in the church? &gt;&gt; Don't you do something here in the church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to balance all that too. &gt;&gt; Don't let the money take control over you. &gt;&gt; But his delight and I know this. I know a a billionaire from Nigeria. &gt;&gt; First thing that man do is he the loudest man in the church &gt;&gt; praising God. And when you see that man praising God, he's like, "This man is a billionaire." &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; But his delight is in the law of the Lord. And and the way we found out that man had money is that every year he would sponsor 40 people from Nigeria to bring them over here to the states and they would stay a month. They would rent a vehicle and they'd go from this place to this place to this. They go to Jeffersonville. They go to um if they want to go to Denver, Colorado, they'll go to Denver. They'll drive all over the United States for a month and visit church after church after church. They pay for their living arrangements, their food. This man would sponsor people every year. Can I ask you a question? I know you're blessed financially. What are you sponsoring? &gt;&gt; Have you found anything to give to &gt;&gt; as far as the work of the work of God is concerned? Have you found anything to give some of your your your finances to? Not just to your f your tithes and offering to the church. I'm talking about outside of that. &gt;&gt; But when you have overflow, you ought to be able to go outside of tithes and offering. &gt;&gt; That's all you got. &gt;&gt; It's just your tithes and offering. God done gave you way more than that. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, please Lord, let me let me But it's the light is in the law of the Lord. And his law doth he meditate day and night. I I I I I'm let me let me please. I'm out of time. We had a we I just had a situation at the house. Um had some paperwork that needed to be signed and there was a a man that need to come and notoriize the paperwork that I was signing and um and I was getting ready to like kind of change my mind in this whole situation. But then uh when this man walked into the house, we got to talking uh he was telling me how he had developed um cancer on his throat or something like that. He was wonder he like I didn't do anything for this to happen like this. I don't know what what this is, but it just kind of came out of know my wife went through this and she went through that and we got her through the situation, but now look at me and I don't know if I'mma be here. They don't. And he just going on and on sitting there at my house. Just sitting there at my house. And I realized at that moment it wasn't about me signing no papers. &gt;&gt; God just brought this man right into my my my pretty much my living room. And I say, "Now, I ain't gonna let this man leave here." &gt;&gt; Without me sharing something about the Lord. &gt;&gt; I know God heals. &gt;&gt; So, I just begin to, you know, just just just, you know, inject certain things. I said, I said, "Now, you know, uh, God brought you to this house and I'm a preacher &gt;&gt; now. You know that now." He said, "Yeah." I said, "Now, um, I believe in praying for the sick." And let me read you a scripture. The Bible say uh we shall anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise them up. And I say this what the scriptures say, you know. And then also the scriptures say uh uh if we just lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. Now actually I didn't anoint him with oil because I didn't know where his faith was. &gt;&gt; So I got two scriptures I can go to. And my my mother-in-law, my wife, they was ready to go get oil and just leave him. He was going to leave there lthered. And I said, "No, no, no. We don't know where he at. So I said, "But let me quote this scripture. If we just lay hands on the sick, they shall recover." &gt;&gt; I said, "Now the Bible tells us to do that." I said, "So now, if you don't mind, before you leave here, I want to just lay hands on. I just want to pray for you." He said, "Sure, sure." He started crying. I mean, man, he we got to get him tissue and everything. Water running everywhere. And uh and as he as he crying, he said he just he could feel the presence of God. And we just all held hands again. He prayed over that man with cancer in his body. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, I'm sitting there and I get a text from his wife saying, "My husband want to let you know his surgery was successful and that uh he going to be he can't talk. He can't write right now, but he's going to get back in touch with you because he really appreciate you all praying for him. He can see God moving in that prayer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God be having a much greater purpose in the people that he bring us in contact with. &gt;&gt; We got to be able to recognize that." So, so our our ministry goes beyond just these four walls. &gt;&gt; Be sensitive to the spirit of God. Let me finish reading Psalms one. I got to leave. I got to leave. Uh verse three, where was I? And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. I like that. Rivers of water. Rivers means that it's going to be multiple sources &gt;&gt; out of one water but multiple sources &gt;&gt; ri planted by a tree and she he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
