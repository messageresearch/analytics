Lord praise a man and that truly is some honor and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord one more time hey man I'm sure I did some people who wish they could be here in the house of the Lord nothing and where they're at amen so we don't count these blessings just to take them lightly man another opportunity a minute wish they were two or three I gathered his name will be in the mince a man so I believe that the Lord is here a man and we're just gonna give a praise I'm gonna give him all that we have on giving worship a man and we going to love them in a dorm at the song say Amen amen thank you sister we'll get right into the message a man just grab your Bibles have a word of Prayer a man such a timely timeless song yeah Here I am to worship a man let us pray most gracious Heavenly Father we come to a God it's even in Oh father God before you Lord and just ask Lord God that you have your way o father's Lord speak to the hearts of those that might be that are listening those that are gathered here in this place Lord those that are listening over these streaming services or father God we ask you Lord God to just use my voice Oh Lord God and his thought Lord God did touch somebody's heart Lord God that they don't hear my voice but they're here the Masters called receiving Oh father Lord God that somebody your father God may recognize the law of God that their child of the king or father God and Lord God and answer that call Oh father God may it burned deep into their hearts Oh father God Lord God that they asked as they did that I ask men and brethren what must we do to be say the Lord God we asked you to just have your way behind me behind the cross Lord God said that she only you be seen Lord and Jesus precious name we pray amen I mean if you grab your Bibles will start at Matthew the fourth chapter and the eighth verse try not to a man get carried away just what would like a look whether Branham would say sometimes the Sunday School lesson amen Ben had this for quite some time the Lord gave me this and I think it's just very timely we'll read from Matthew's fourth chapter the eighth and again the devil had taken him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me now we see here that this is the devil tempting our Savior Jesus Christ and he's asking from Jesus to worship him so we see here that the devil desires worship a man and the Lord said then said Jesus unto him get the hint Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him alone what I certa a man you may be seated a man in this little thought I would title a man worship service and when we're gonna just kind of take our time and just kind of look into this because we find you know especially I'm only mistake specially in this hour all through the Bible all through the Bible men have worshipped and have worshiped in era so many people believe well as long as I go to church and longest high I do to do this and I go on our worship but what are you worshipping you know Satan to take worship any way he can get it whether it's by deception or whether it's intentional Satan have received I worship but see Christ God is only going to receive worship in truth outside of the revelation for that dispensation of time that you're living in amen there's only one proof had a place for worship a man in 1965 a prophet preached he preached a message God's only provide a place of worship God's only chosen place of worship and he preached trying to do God a service without it being his will all in the last year of his life now I believe he was trying to drive a home a certain point amen that in order for us to have true worship it has to be grounded and rooted in revelation of the truth amen and we understand a lot of times here people confuse worship and praise amen Psalms 58 man says we praise them on the high symbol and praise them on the love symbol let everything that hath breath praise the Lord praise is wonderful and most definitely worship is a part of praise but praise and worship are two different things I worship God and how I treat my life I worship God and how I carry myself on the job I worship God and how I treat my neighbor I worship God in my daily woke it's more than just coming to church and lifting up our voices and things like that that is definitely a part of worship and it are more susceptible to the word of praise and we're giving them adoration and things like that you know but worship goes so much further beyond it is a lifestyle it is a commitment it is a dying out to oneself and taking on the wheel of our Lord and Savior will look into the Scriptures hear a man and and see some things we go back here Genesis 4 we'll take a look and we'll see where there was two brothers came enable both worshiped both built an altar and the Prophet said that if it's just going to church and and and praising the Lord and and all of these sort of things was enough then King was justified a man a man Cain had every had every he was he was right there and he was doing all of the things but the Lord did not accept his worship and and and and and i guess it would seem but well you know except able but see Abel had a revelation amen and and and at that time there was no Bible to read Amen I can assume that they were only talk from their parents you know and probably told the backstory on what happened Amen enable here in the story amen being this like his father was able to hear the Bible say in Revelations behind everything you say he that laughing ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying and we tell yourself and just be caught these two things on the side of your head everybody can't hear a man we should be grateful a man that we have something on the inside that was able to resonate a man with the Word of God that we were able to actually hear the hear the call was in the word see there's a there's a my God thank you Jesus see a desert there's a the our voice a sound that kid as a carrier Amen our voice is the carrier frequency and we and we project our voice and we these words are just words amen but see it's the revelation in the Holy Spirit that give these words life communication is is two parts it is a delivery of those words and it's a reception of the words if we're having a conversation I'm delivering a salt amen and that thought goat would go to my brain and I would use my faculties of my voice chords in my and my lips and all of these things to project that word so that thoughts so the words it's just a carrier of my thoughts now you have to be able to receive that so your ears come into play you hear it and then you feel to what I'm saying through your mind amen and in your filtering you feel to the good part should fall in your heart and that is what you hear I was recently talking to to a fellow and we was during the breakfast breakfast spot waiting on our grits and eggs and stuff and I didn't know he was a minister and somebody hadn't in the little place I can say ribs say to grace oh he blessed the food and I said what you a minister so we started a little conversation and he made a point he say we got the time of chopping it up a little bit and he said well how he was a part of the one of the big denominational groups here and how something must have happened and they kicked him out or he left for something he had some kind of shake up and I was just recently talking about why she got so many denominational churches and different things around here just because somebody got upset and split and started a on and and it just and it just keep going and keep going like somebody wants belief from not going to start they all and it just did just keep multiplying and multiplying but I see I was talking to him and he made a comment he said well you know what religion is and I say okay well he would tell him about his seminary education you went to college for so many years and got educated they did end up study on the word religion I said well religion is a covering he said well that's pretty good young fella he say but religion means back to bondage I said man I like that back to bondage he said that's what it is religion when you get religious you you you got to live just just religious you're going back to budget that's what the children of ejek wanted to do regarding to the wilderness there and they got you know some was really saving souls were just religious the minute things got tough they wanted to run back to Goshen and I said man you bring up a valid point there I like that I like that back to bondage just being religious is not gonna be enough and see that's what it is everybody you have a lot of people religious and they saying things like I hear things like uh well we'll understand that all once well you won't get there because he that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you how you gonna get it let's look at this let's look at this amen Deuteronomy leave it's the fourth Deuteronomy fourth chapter don't be afraid to turn with me in your Bibles if you just put it up Deuteronomy fourth chapter the 14 verse a man Deuteronomy the fourth chapter in the fourteenth verse said in the law commanded me at the time to teach you statutes and judgments and you might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it Tinky therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Herald out of the midst of the fire Leisha corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure likeness of male or female the likeness of any beasts that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish in the water beneath the earth let's now lift up thine eyes unto heaven thou when thou sees the Sun and the moon and the stars even though the hosts of heaven should be driven to worship them and serve which the Lord that God had divided unto the nations under the whole heaven amen so he's warning them to be careful amen to not put any other gods before him be careful of what you worship and we find that so synonymous in this hour in the message show us the father a man the Prophet was talking about how there's many people that do all kinds of worship they worship all kind of thing and some of the Indians and different things they they worship the Sun and and and they they believe that when they died I go over to this wonderful hunting ground amen and there's different ones who worship worship different animals and different things of that nature but we see that even in this hour man we would design we were made to worship in us we can't help it in us in it we were designed to worship something so whether we we know the truth whether we understand it or not whether we believe anything or not to come to check we will worship something we will either worship we will worship like he said here under a woman or will worship a man we worship athletic figures we worship athletic teams you worship things cars boats things like that make sure where we spend our time and our money in order to be a member of a certain church to properly say this how'd you become a member because you spend your time and your money and your presence we don't have no role for you to sign and wean doing the right hand fellowship you want to come come it's where you spend your time your money and your where you where you devote yourself to a man and some people devote myself to the bar afterwards every day so whatever it is that they go into that bar to get every day that's what they worship her because they spend they time and they money and that's her and it's a constant regular worship some religiously doing football season or a basketball season they got season tickets and they work and they go get their money and then they paid a season ticket be like tithe you worship that sports team and you go there you get there and they jump around and they praised and they have all kind of good time and a half church and they go whoo I feel better and they say oh I can't wait to the next game they men go wake up in the morning they look through the papers and they read the stacks a to know everything they reading a Bible they go back to work and then they talk to me buck man did you see the game let me tell you something happen and that happens but this person they can tell you some stuff like new people a witness they witnessing see so we come to church and we have a real good time we pray them everything if we go home and when we have a wonderful time we go back and we tell him about it oh do we go to work and we get around the water cooler let me tell you what happened in church oh but we worship worship is everyday worship is how you spend your time worship is the excitement that you put forth about what God has done for you we worship Him not just in these four walls we worship Him on the outside of these four walls that's what a true worship comes in and here we raise our voices in praise thank you for the goodness Lord thank you for the blessings O Lord God give me more Lord keep it more Lord it's so good thank you but when we leave him I'll give you a good example I don't want to get ahead of myself there was a woman who are parents may of toho had a good Bible stay good upbringing but she kind of you know hi y'all folks get some time they feel like they know more than everybody got off in there some things he probably should the got into and wound up in a position and she real how did I get out here how did I get in I selling a body and different things like that so she went one day to draw some water from the wheel and on the other side jesus said I have need to go to Samaria so as he came up he asked the lady that well draw me some water see she well versed in the scripture cuz she said it ain't proper for you to be talking to me me being a Samaritan you being a Jew he said if you knew who I was you would ask me for a drink of water piqued the curiosity so what was happening she before this encounter she worshiped something but she was worshipping in error uh she she worshiped she spent her time and I mother she was religious she was in bondage so as Jesus kept talking to and he said well I tell you whatever you know and I can't go get your husband and we know the story he said I have no husband said dollar said well you have father the one you wit not your own so what was he doing he was unfolding himself all of a sudden this young woman caught the revelation lord have mercy we remember talking about this in Bible study that wait a minute man that come and discern my heart and things that he you don't know me and you how did you know these things I perceive you to be the Messiah not see not too long before that he did the same thing they put a rag over his head and say hit a hit and tell tell us who hit you see she had even though it was covered up there was something on the inside and jesus knew that that something was dead and all he had to do was unfolding says now when she saw it what the first thing she did she got excited by the revelation she got stimulated about a revelation she had a bucket of water that she the Prophet said she dropped her creeds and denominational ideas and she ran through the city telling everybody come see a man come see a man she wasn't preaching he said he was testified she was testifying come see a man that told me the things that I have done and she went through the city and telling all of these people listen to people say well wait a minute I know that girl woman miss you I know they said it but they came and because of her testimony many more came to listen to what he had to say and were saying because she ran off she got stimulated spirit about a revelation truth she went off worshiping in spirit and in truth and minimo Cain so worship it's not it's more than Jess what we do here in these four walls it's what we do when we take it outside of these four walls how we handle ourselves and how we carry I said the excitement and the exuberance that we show about what we have we have something great we have the words of eternal life amen so we see Cain and Abel they did the same thing he told Cain if you worship like your brother I'll accept your side I accept yours too but see Abel had a revelation that he uh uh he say much like a you know they he got his garden all prettied up pineapples and bananas and all of the different pretty colors and he had labored in the fear probably labored a long time sweating he was doing nothing he was over there shepherding his sheep probably laid on up under the tree you know he makes sure he got them all one two three four five six yeah they all here you know watching that foot of wolves and different thing making sure they don't come get his sheep and and eats he went and he took his best his best one my best one he found one and he went back and he said he built an altar got him a stone and they didn't have knives in so he got him a nice sharp rock and he just went to whacking on this sheep and the Sheep why he wagon he wagon I say blood splattered all over the place God came down and you see a cane standing over here in this nice Cathedral building pretty pews maybe purple looking real good and nice and this nice cross broke looking real nice and sharp Abel standing over there was blood on his hands and all this is gonna close but that's what God accepted that's what God accepted and he said if you get down take off your robe go on over there get your lamb and slay that let him I'll accept but he he couldn't do it he couldn't do it instead he got wrong got mad that is temple techo pretty alright we into these war strategies mine temperance yeah so he let his temper get the best of him and he went over and slew his brother Abel moving forward may we see cincin and kami they multiplied the earth and different things and down through the lineage there or the president of King Dinah's can see there he had with him cush and Nimrod and and and and how they began to do some some things there see remember the serpent tricked or deceived Eve and I don't want to get into you know the whole nother message with this whole campaign but we know what happened there but and it went on down but the cccc when people pass on the spirit don't pass on so that same spirit was still in the land and and and and Satan still desire to be worshipped like the Most High Amen according to Isaiah 14 he said I will ascend up in the heights of the clouds to be worshipped like the Most High and Nimrod began to build this tower war battle amen and and and this is this Babylonian place said man this place he tried to a sidestep God he say uh you you flooded us out and killed a bunch of people this time we're gonna build the tower so high all we got to do was run to the top of the tower and we can avoid the flood when you do this again much like today they trying to take an astronaut and build a city of a skate place up in the fitness space they figured that that's going to be able to save them and once everything done there come back down to earth that's what they actually think that's this pastor who just to the space industry done they going up there and they freakin can man live in space they know this thing is gonna collapse I was there was a news report yesterday they say that this year was the hottest year on record hottest year on record it's coming close amen the the volcanoes of belching and it's just a time when when the the whole thing over there and Los Angeles slipping to the ocean a man and everybody gonna I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen now thanks lip and ocean all make believers they waiting to see that gonna come back running you ain't gonna pay to find a seat in the church better get here early that day because they all go come on wait a minute maybe he is the Prophet brothers and sisters I don't know it might be too late then it might be too late then I don't know I'm just saying it might be too late then I wouldn't wait I wouldn't wait that long but it's important for us to understand who we worshipping in this out you know it's only one provided place of worship that's something to share blood of Jesus Christ but everybody's saying they worship the cross everybody is saying the same thing amen we're gonna get into some things and we're gonna by the help of the Lord really break those things down now here in impediment in this Babylonian concept it and everything they had Nimrod designed three things a man he decided he wanted to create a man a strong nation a man he wanted to start his own religion and he wanted to make a name for himself he wanted to make a name for himself and let me tell you that's when a lot of men make they downfall when they get to a point that pride get lifted up in their pride and and and they start wanting to make a name for themselves see this isn't about us this is about Christ I don't care about making a name for myself because the Bible tells me the way up is down if I could the more I can humble myself the more he's lifted up hey man the smaller I can get the bigger he can get so it's not you know in this aisle in the big eyes or little use and different things like that we have to understand the revelation that if we could there is a scripture that I believe it's in Luke I believe Luke 4 he says then why go into the synagogue and take the Chiefs seat looking for the Chiefs seat well I'm somebody I should sit here you ain't know what no well how about I give this part up to somebody who who who don't know the Lord just recently we was in a service and we can't sit this person oh they got pants on I said no we go oh you made me go argue about we go argue about but this is what I'm talking about you got okay yeah we understand that what you know is abomination for a woman to wear anything pertaining to a man well your spirit say you could get so convoluted in the law which is what the Pharisees and the Sadducees did they got so convoluted in the Lord a blitz who was standing right in front of them that's why it must be spirit and in truth they were quoting all of the scroll Jesus that Jesus and the Pharisees and the Sadducees read from the same Bible it was talking about our Father or the Moses and Abraham we just follow the law I am the law well you mean obviously you ain't following me cuz I'm here you got so convoluted in these kind of things you you missed the point and find yourself worshipping and no not what you worship Caesar to happen he's it a half a man one of these things you know Nimrod but in this Babylonian concept is where they started amen the religion of three gods and they started there this this religion of three gods and different things through the worship of the the mother of the child and the father and when he came out and he scattered them and confounded a language they took this doctrine throughout the world so I over in India they have a similar of religion what a worship is it's an image of a woman a man and a baby and the Buddhists have a three-headed Buddha with three years all of this come from that was propagated from there in Babylon and the Prophet there in Pergamos go back and read it if you like in the church ages and the Pergamon means the seat of Satan it's all right there where he said the most not as one is Father Son and Holy Ghost idol worship not realizing that that that he said you must worship the place that I chose to place my name in well we are we got these three guards his father and the son and it's and the Holy Ghost those are titles we're not the same time over in in in in in in Babylon we're dead just worshipping these idol worship three gods Abraham is over on the other side who see three people walking toward them and he said Lord one Lord one Lord so we still have a man here and in this time that same spirit people go on the church and worship it but no not but they worship no not what they're worshipping we must worship God in spirit and in truth it's not good enough to - to say well I'm just going to church king went to church Judas went to church they were all very religious but the worship was an error amen they worship was an error and I'm sure that many of us sitting here can understand these concepts but maybe I'm talking to someone over the street who don't understand and say well what's so different about this church and why they well it's because we have we're excited about what we're doing well what is it about these people that make them come to church all the time and what make them all so dedicated what make them what is it that's drawing them what is it that's making them so excited about what they're doing we are worshiping in spirit and in truth see we're like that woman the whale we like that woman like the well when that word came across and we heard we recognize that this is that this is God himself the Prophet said in the message it was that message trying to do God a service out of being his will plenty of time reading that he said Jesus is our prophet now I found myself talking to some people a while back and they that's it like they try to use that God at sundry times and doesn't spoke to the properties in times past saying may using that to say that God don't use process no mo well you go to Jesus Christ the same yesterday there forever and you said well what about that well it says did so now you had to stab me but the Prophet says okay he said himself he said Jesus is our prophet but every time brother Branham was in his fetches he said it's not me I'm just waiting on that angel it's not me who told you that your secrets it's that angel standing next to me it's not me so I tell you for he came down whispered into the ear of his prophet and said say this say this say this so yes Jesus was our prophet but he had to keep the scriptures Amos 3:7 surely the Lord thy God would do nothing less he revealed his secrets to the servants the Prophet first so they can't understand they can't see that it was God himself using the voice of William Brennan to call himself out of breath so that we can worship Him in spirit and in truth amen we see that that in Babylon it was the start of that polytheism form of worship and man and and and and and it was just seven things prophet that came and gave us the revelation they know slow at Jesus Christ come down through the time down through these seven Church ages it all got mixed up all got tangled up in each age that was a there was a small group that caught the revelation of their age but the first didn't know ii and ii didn't know the third amen but it came down to the intern that he would know all of it they bible say all the mysteries of be revealed amen a place that he chose to place his name that's where true worship must take place let us not take these things lightly my brothers and sisters amen a man reminded of the story the prophet was saying in the gods provide a place of worship that he said he one time he put it to the test and he was somewhere and i'm trying to quote it on top of my head but i'm sure many of you heard a story with the spiritualists and he was saying how if God is real he know the devil is real and they went to this service and they had this table levitating and the lady asked me say well you were preaching that this person was challenging people who can come fully God and he's man grabbed up and they couldn't pull this table down and she said well you see saying you think that's God he said that's the devil and they was challenging brother profit does you know do something you know and he was not the type to show off or nothing like that but he apparently saw a vision I can't recall it was a vision or he heard awards or something but he said in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I command that table to come down he said it didn't budge and he in the name of something else I forget exactly but the last thing he said was the in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I command that table to come down he said that Fang fell so hard about busted every leg or foot amen the one that bled and died for us under the shared blood of an innocent one his world we find worship and it's anonymous you know that many times people during the time of Jesus Jesus was right there and they couldn't see that who it was and it's the same thing today the prophecy Jesus is your prophet but because they couldn't visibly see him they feel like we talking about brother Branham he's just a voice I just gave these something the scenario of the voices just to care your frequency but you must receive the message on the inside there must be a filter that comes down to receive the message into your heart if there's something in your hearts and amen amen this is that that's the ear that he's talking about the ear is not on the side of your head the ear is in your heart if there's something about this this whole concept of worship and service that you can hear and and and and and you might say well I never heard anything about this the woman at the well she had never heard she had never seen a man like this before but she knew that there was something to it if something is said that stirs your heart that's not me my voice is just a carrying frequency it's the Lord Himself speaking to your heart I challenge you to stay my brothers and sisters to search out that place there are many places of the people worship I gave the example they go to the racetrack and they worship they go to the dog track and they worship they go to the basketball games in the football game they worship some people worship they job just so dedicated to the fainted wife not to leave dog don't know who they yield they just always about work work I got one so you always a man I back that money about that money money can be your God money could be your God as many things to devil have out there for you to worship I read in Deuteronomy and he lifted out all of these different things to watch to watch he have no graven image to have no God before him jealous god no other God before me I challenge you this evening to find the place where God is accepting your worship and worship Him with your lifestyle he don't want fruit on the altar no longer we've already had the blood of the lamb on the altar he wants you on the altar of sacrifice now give up your rights all over your rice this lady of Sein age means people's rights we see all the gays have rights women have rights lord if I don't even know how to see it but there's a certain me and make they fight for the rights now I'm talking the ones who had the power all alone not a fighting for the rights catch my drill everybody feel like they got rights I got the right to serve the Lord and that's it that's all I got the right to serve the Lord and I'm gonna exercise my right amen and to you who may be listening you have a right Jesus Christ came and sacrifice upon the altar shed blood all you have to do now is accept it a laylamon sacrifice official altar and sacrifice your life give it all to him amen so that your worship can be received don't be like there's many other scriptures we're gonna pick up on this again next winter there's just so much more that's so much more that goes along with this Amen that we can share a man that'll open this up even more amen worship and service hey man look at the Lord had a blessing I meant I did sure save man amen let us stand to our feet musician come be gonna close like the Baudette a man worship and service a man eat you that may be listening Amen it may not know well what is this all about Amen I challenge you a man to just seek the Lord amen the Bible says seek and ye shall find knock and the door shall be opened amen I challenge you to find that place of work they're not talking about a geographical place what about that place in your heart amen to receive which you must worship Him in spirit and in truth the devil is a man so deceiving Amen that you can be worshiping the devil and not knowing it no.11 and not walking around and chanting oh we worship you know that's not what they're doing they shouting singing and doing things they look that's just like us said it'd be so closer to the sea the very elect if it was possible a man he is a master at deception he's been deceiving people for thousands of years he is a master at deception amen but the Lord a man he has some tricks up his sleeve - he discerned the thoughts and the secrets of your heart if there was something said that was on your heart and you know I mean that I don't know you have never seen you but something was said that stirred your heart amen that's the Lord's call that the deep that's calling to the deep sea in order for there to be a fish there had to be some water somewhere or he would never have scales and fins in order for you a man to have this thirst for more of God only means that there's more God for you to refine seek and ye shall find knock and the door be opened Amen that you may come into the gates and worship in spirit and in truth amen let us pray most gracious Heavenly Father we come before you this evening
