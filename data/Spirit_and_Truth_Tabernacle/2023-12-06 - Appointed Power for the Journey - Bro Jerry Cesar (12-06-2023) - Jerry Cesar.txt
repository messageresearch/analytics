a special way Lord God oh Father God we've toiled all day Lord we've told our week but now Lord we need a refilling of your spirit we need a refilling of your word Lord we need something that has sustain us to continue the journey Hallelujah Lord God I pray you circumcise the lips of your servant Lord circumcise the hearts of your people Lord to receive your word God that it would fall on Good Grounds this evening and Lord when it's all said and done Lord we want to give you all the praise and all the glory have your way father and be be here with us oh Lord have your preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord I greet you all tonight in the precious name of Jesus Christ I am very thankful to be here tonight with you guys um I know that our pastor uh had to attend uh his duties uh so he he asked me if I could step in so I'm just a spare tire tonight uh but spare tires do you good they get you to your journey they get you to your destination so I pray you guys will will be in prayer for me as we read the scripture uh we want to turn tonight to the book of uh Genesis uh and we'll read there in the 22nd chapter and just the first two verses and just say Amen when you're there you know I I've really been enjoying the ministering of the word uh by all the different Brethren I trust it's been a blessing to you as well I just really really enjoy what the Lord has been doing in our midst all right it reads and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham he and he said behold behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of Praise the Lord you may all have your seats may God add a blessing to his reading now tonight if I could use as a subject I want to use appointed power for the journey again that's appointed power for the journey I believe the last time I was here we went through the thought that there uh that there's no point of uh the point of no return and uh just kind of felt like the Lord added a little bit of inspiration after that uh just to continue uh so we want to recognize tonight that as there is a point of no return uh God did have an appointed power that he uh applied in your life that would be sufficient for you to get to your destination so as a theme we want to just focus on starting with Abraham strength and weaknesses now as we walk through the life of Abraham we can see that he had a lot of weak points in his life we can see that through Abraham uh of course our F Foundation we can see that is faith yet this was the same Prophet that God called and when he God called him uh he did laugh along with his wife Sarah he also lied about Sarah being his wife right uh to the king uh but Abraham had a testimony and his testimony Paul re uh Paul picks this up in Rook Romans chap 4: 19 he says that Abraham was not weak in faith he said that he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb it goes on to say in verse 20 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving God the glory now I like this testimony about Abraham because it assures us that God recognizes one thing he recognizes What You Do by faith and as you along this journey there's an appointed power to you but you can use only use that power by faith you see now as you are at point of no return one of the things that I just wanted to pick up on is that it means it's the time in which it becomes no longer possible for you to make a different decision or to return to an earlier place or state here in Genesis 22 we find that God called Abraham and try uh called him to do a test it was approving grounds for his prophet and Abraham was obedient unto that call and we find that when God when Abraham went unto the mountain to offer his son Isaac God stepped in and says Abraham I see that you truly love me you were willing to withdraw your only son and God had an appointed Ram in a bush that would stand as a sacrifice as a type of Christ today you see now the prophet says something here I just want to point out in the message questions and answers on Genesis he says I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit or the spirit a part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in the in heaven now those that what the prophet is speaking of here is when the when the enemy deceive a third of the angels in heaven the prophet is saying you will there and he saying at that time you were Spirits rotating off of God and you had your choice made there you chose your side there you see so God had an appointed power to you on this journey that would bring you to your destination in Acts 1:6 we find it says talking to about the disciples it says when they were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto to me in both Jerusalem and all Judea and all Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth and I believe we heard on Sunday that you are the uttermost parts of the earth you see uh but God has appointed this power that it would be sufficient for your journey whatever you have need of God has already written in his word everything that you need to get you to where you need to be and Y believe that everyone does possess everything the the very power in them at this moment through the Holy Ghost to have whether it's healing whether it's Deliverance God has appointed that in your life now a lot of times when we think about power people can associate that with with riches or with popularity or influence you see but real power comes down knowing what you have and a lot of times people don't realize what they have therefore they don't know what it's used what it could be used for you see but I believe that through the scriptures we can find an example here in Luke 10:1 17 where God had a pretty large group of disciples and here we find that Christ in verse 17 he calls them and they he set them on commission to do a work for the Lord and it says in the 70 returned again saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give you power to thread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurth you but verse 20 says not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven you see God's not wanting you or waiting for you to do a certain thing uh for you to realize who you are right you see there there was a distinction between Luke 10 where God had appointed these people with these disciples with power and what happened in the upper room you see God's power was purposed so that you could realize who you are in this hour who you are as a bride of Jesus Christ you see now on the upper room when they can recognize that and they were filled with the anointing of the Holy Spirit it was no longer a a a what they can do or a commission of what what they were going to do but it was a a matter of how they can express Christ to the people it was a matter of how they can give Christ to the people Christ will be sufficient for them now you don't have power until you have a genuine marriage with the Holy Ghost amen I'm going say that again you don't have power until you have a genuine marriage with the Holy Ghost a relationship with the word now we continue here it says says uh verse uh 23 in Luke chap 10 and he turned unto his disciples and said privately said blessed are are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them you see this this time in scripture we find that the manifested word which was Christ was quickening the predestinated word you see because God I believe our our brother said this a few Sundays ago how God has a private Ministry and a public Ministry God was speaking something privately specifically to those that were of his those that had their names written in heaven and they had to recognize what the scripture said about them so that it could bring forth a manifestation of the word amen amen now we continue here and I just kind of want to take a little part of this scripture I know uh we've heard it pretty uh few times in the last in the last week or a few weeks or so but I figured we'd certainly take a part of it here tonight in Matthew chapter 4 I would call this uh just as a little imagination Peter's pie right in Matthew 4 verse 18 and it says in Jesus walking by the Seas of Galilee saw two brethen Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and they said unto them follow me and I will make you fishes of men you see God had called out Peter and his Brethren he had a specific uh a a word for them that would Quicken their their that word that gerti seed at an appointed time you see but we find later in Peter's life uh Christ go uh Christ sends out a commission to them as they were on the boat and Jesus says in Matthew 14:22 he says and straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him onto the other side while he was sent while he sent the multitudes away verse 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and I just kind of want to stay there for a moment because this point Peter was the only one in the ship that was that was going to make the decision to step out on faith to see what the word had in store for him and sometimes you have to step out on faith to see what the word has in store for you you see you have to be able to take God at his word for any condition any moment and as Peter walked out we know the scripture go Jesus Christ started to say uh Peter why did you doubt cuz he started to look at the conditions around him says Thou of little faith you see but the same Peter we find that he had to meet Christ on the other side on the other side of what in the other side of his conversion cuz by that time Christ told Peter when thou are converted strengthen your brothers you see and Peter has a lot of examples on how he became a strength to the people around him him now power is not always received or given but it is the revelation of who you are and and Peter got to a place where he received the revelation of who he was now what good is it to have power to move mountains but don't know why the mountain needs to be moved you see and and Peter could get to a place where now it was no longer about him but it was about what Christ can do through him you see sometimes it's one thing to have the word but it's one thing to know the purpose of the word for That season now it goes on to say uh just want to read the scripture here uh in 1 Peter chapter 1 there's a few scriptures that Peter points out that could be an encouragement to us tonight and as we turn to that Peter had a commission but he did not identify with that with his purpose prior to his Comm verion and I I I realized going through this that as you are commissioned by God you have to identify with the purpose of God in your life you see Samson had great power but it was useless until he recognized the purpose of God he had to get to a place where he actually became the very purpose of that moment you see and Samson because he accepted that purpose he accepted death which means whatever the price was was he was willing to pay it right the same thing goes with Daniel he purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself in the king's court right while remaining faithful and he accepted to go even unto death into the lion's den whatever the cost was he was willing to pay for it 1 Peter chapter 6 says wherein you are greatly you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifolds temptation that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory of the appearing of Jesus Christ and I like this because something Prophet says here you're going to go through many tests and battles but the trial of your faith is necessary so it can bring about a Perfection a diamond before it can be displayed it has to be cut and the prophet says you are he he what you are there so the only way you can reflect what's up there is by faith you see I'm going say that again you are here what you are there which means you have to be able to reflect by faith what's on the other side and what's on the other side is your Celestial body is your theophany and the only way you can reflect that on this side of Eternity is by Faith by that six sense Peter goes on to say in 1 Peter chapter 2 ver9 it says here but ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him of him that called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now a people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained mercy and I like that because we have to recognize what we came from I'm a dreamer so a lot of times God would remind me of what my life would have been like without him I'd get dreams sometimes about my friends that I had before that I used to hang around with and where they are now you see and through that just God is showing me how great his Mercy was manifested in my life and sometimes it's a great to realize that because it shakes your attitude you go from Victory to Victory because you realize that's what you're leaving behind is Trails of Victory you see God did not choose you to lose you God did not choose you right to not sustain you so Peter shows us these things by telling us we are peculiar people a chosen Nation right now if we go on here we see uh just uh first Peter uh chapter 4:8 and it says and above all things it says have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins and I like that because the love that you have through what you're going through can bring correction to the situation as long as you express that love you can bring Grace you can bring Mercy to a situation by the love you share in the midst of it by the love you share to your neighbor I remember one time I was driving to work and I was cutting the corner to uh turn the light as it was Green and it was a a unique situation but as I turned I looked for a quick moment to the other side just to see if another vehicle was coming and as I turned the vehicle in front of me I had already anticipated that it would it would already go by the time I I pressed on the gas and I I went forward I go I went ahead and I bumped and collided into the other vehicle's uh uh rear end now as that happened I was very surprised but when that happened I I I I I started to immediately think and this was years ago years years years ago before or the early stages of my conversion and I was just for a quick moment a thought came to my mind oh you know you could flee the scene right uh all you have to do is cut around this vehicle you didn't hit her too hard or him you could flee the scene and no one will never know and I had to stop for a moment and says you know uh I don't believe that thought come is coming from the Lord so I decided to stop and I got out my car and I went and it was a elderly white woman and I spoke to her and I says ma'am I am so sorry that I have reared your car uh please forgive me uh and I started to speak to her in such a way and she got out the car and she looked at me and she walked me over to her car and my car she looked at both vehicles and then she says young man have a great day she did not call get anyone involved she didn't say anything in fact back I believe she even gave me a hug and she says thank you for your honesty and she walked away and she says have a great day and I remember that moment because I had such a love in her I wanted to see if she was okay I could have fled the scene but I wanted to see is the driver in that vehicle all right and sometimes the love that you express through a situation can bring correction can bring healing can bring deliverance and I learned that that in that moment it brought Deliverance to me as we continue here in 1 Peter 4:12 it says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is triy was is here to try you as though some strange thing happened to you I thought it was a strange thing but it goes on to say but rejoice in so much ye are partakers of Christ sufferings and you know Church Christ learned obedience through the things that he suffered right so when you find yourself suffering be obedient because in the OB of your obedience you will reign with Christ in his glory it goes on to say that um in as much ye are partakers of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may also be glad with exceeding Joy if ye be reproached in the Name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified and you see when I read the scripture I couldn't help but think that if there's any time in our day uh or history where the name of Christ was was blasphemed uh nowadays you find the the very name Jesus Christ is often used as a curse word instead of a name to be worshiped or glorified right people are quick to say Jesus Christ in the midst of any situation and I just trust that as they say that name to recognize what power lies behind it you see now I just this thought just came to me but I remember a few years after I just shared that testimony about the accident I remember I was driving from work this time around and I remember it was pretty late at night uh maybe it was 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and there was a a driver and I remember I was under the light it was red and this driver just bumped into me and I got out the car and I looked and I was I was very surprised but when I got out the car it was a it was a was driver that appeared to have been a bit of under the influence so I spoke with him and I said um you know it's not safe for you to be driving at this time of night especially you know seems like you've been drinking and he he he goes on to me he says oh man I'm really sorry and I looked at my car and there was no damages but I looked at his car and you can clearly tell the bumper was was Mex was missed was mixed up and you can see that it was in a misplace and all that kind of stuff but when I thought about it I talked to him and I said you know I'm not going to get anyone involved but have yourself a wonderful night get to a place where you can be safe and when I left the scenes I began thinking about that moment that I had some years ago and I learned that because that someone was able to extend Grace to me I was able to in turn extend that Grace to someone else sometimes you'll find yourself in a situation where you have to be the one to bring that love that someone else can use for themselves wow in First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 it says here be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a Waring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called you unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after ye have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen and settle you you see after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you you see often times I realize that people want a drive-thru gospel a microwave gospel that produces a hotel experience constantly moving from place to place never settled people don't realize that the the way that comes is the way it goes and I believe our brother talked about it the other night that we ought to be laboring into that rest laboring into the presence of the Lord something that you never labored will never sustain you and it's important to recognize that as you go through your sufferings Christ is on the other side waiting you see Christ is on the finish line now as we continue here just want to point out in first John chapter 3 it says behold first chapter first verse there it says behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it who it knew him not beloved now are you the sons of God and it does not yet appear what ye shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and I like the scripture here because I believe we are to manifest and reflect Christ every day in our lives and this scripture allows us to see that when he shall appear we shall be like him and we shall see him as he is and I was able to connect this scripture back to Isaiah 53 where it says that there was no beauty that we would desire him when we shall see him and sometimes we can get caught up with too much of ourselves instead of realizing that God is not found in the beauty of the world but God is found in the beauty of the character of his word as we reflect the character of the word then we can recognize that we are people of God now God has appointed us power for the destination power for this journey now we find one that God provided power that would sustain him there was a power that flow through him and there was a power that was given to him in his life in First Kings chapter 17 we find the story of Elijah the tishbite now you guys are familiar with the story where God uses Elijah in a powerful way to shut the heavens that no water Would Rain upon the Earth and in this instant in Elijah's life go we'll go ahead and read it here in the first verse it says Elijah the tishbite who was the inhabitant of Gilead and said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be nor due nor rain these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hint and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook Chariot that is before Jordan now Elijah had spoke these words that they would be no rain and as he fled and he went to the brook cherith God will use the Ravens to sustain him he had an appointed power in his in his way that God would provide bread and and and meat unto him you see in the junction of time the prophet goes to say this in paragraph 34 he says but then just before that God brought down to show down to show who he was there come a time that there was a prophet came in the land by the name of Elijah who was Anointed with the message of a God and he performed a miraculous and prove that omnipotence was still miraculous the prophet stood out there and closed the heavens that it rain in uh that it did not rain in the days of his ministry and he brought the Rains Down out of the heavens and give the Earth and Angels appeared on the scene Hallelujah baked him some cornbread that kept him 40 days alive while he was out there in the wilderness of God angels appeared in the end time all the prophets in the signpost point saying the day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did uh if if God did that for those little Junctions back there what will he do now when all Hells turn loose all heaven will turn loose Angels appearing signs and wonders on Earth the counterfeits arising God proving which is right and which is wrong and I would like to say that God God will meet you at your showdown at the point where you recognize that God has appointed power in front before you in the midst of what you're going through God will meet you at your Showdown you see God directed his servant Elijah later in his life that he would uh after uh um the the after the desert dried up right God would direct his servant to the shunamite woman that the shunamite woman would sustain him but what I find strange is that the shunamite woman did not have much to sustain him you see when he went to the shunamite woman she only had one morsel of bread that was all that she had just enough for her and her son you see but God that operates and manifests himself in what seems impossible manifested himself in this in this situation here that he would send his Prophet to this woman the shemite and we'll pick it up here and it says in verse 10 so he arose and went to zarap zerath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the wow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and says bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she says as the Lord liveth I I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die now later we find this shunamite woman she was willing to give up what she had for the purpose of God you see she when when when when the prophet asked her again she says I understand that but bake me a cake first you see this woman was able to surrender and Obey God's word in her day you see the prophet says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all of his righteousness and everything else will be added unto her because of her obedience because that she was not withdrawing what she had from God's servant right the prophet was on went on to say that uh her the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fell according to the word of the Lord which spake by Elijah the prophet now as we continue here we can see here in 2 Kings chapter 6 where God had appointed power to his servant now here we find that the king of the armies of Syrian was fighting against the king of Israel and here God had appointed Elisha as the the as a prophet of that day that he would be the very point of power to his people you see when it came that the king the Kingdom of Israel was fighting against the kingdom of Syria they were troubled because they realized there was someone in the camp that knew what the very things that were happening in the midst you see and i' like to just encourage you tonight that you have access to the enemy's Camp so whatever it is that you need or whatever it is that you have uh have been taken from you God has given you access to the enemy's Camp you see you can't be afraid to go to the enemy's Camp to take what God has given you what God has given you is for you not for your enemy not for someone else it's for you now I encourage you tonight to claim it we find that Elisha's servant as he continued he recognized that the king of Syria Army was a lot greater than the king than than the king of Israel but Elisha prayed and says God opened the young man's eyes that he would see and as he prayed that the young man looked around him and realized that there was more with him than there was with the Enemy and sometimes it's it's important to open up your eyes to the word and realize there's more substance in the word than any resource you might have whatever it is that you find yourself going through open your eyes to the word and see that God has given you sufficient Grace for your day now in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 it says he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength now if there's anybody at the end of their strength tonight I encourage you that when you've come to the end of your strength God's strength can begin it goes on to say even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be R they shall walk and not faint whatever you do Church wait on the Lord now in John chapter 19 verse 10 we going to come to this place here and it says then said pilate unto him speaketh thou not unto me knowest that knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee in verse 14 we'll jump there Christ goes on to say I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine and my father knoweth me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep have I which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may not I may take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay down my life of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father now as we read this I want to just point out that as Christ was being led to the cross it wasn't an easy task for him there was a lot of things that he had to overcome the most the greatest thing he had to overcome was himself he had to overcome himself in order to see that going to the Cross was something that was possible he had to yield his will to the will of God you see and as we find in Hebrews don't have this scripture I I thought I did but in Hebrews chapter 4 I believe it talks about that be as he was going to the Cross there was a joy that was set before him that he was able to endure the the the the the the sufferings of going to the cross and I want you to know that as he that Joy I believe the prophet says was you was was the bride was his bride he had you on his mind as he was going through the cross you see God Christ in this moment was the weakest point of his ministry weakest point of his life but he had something appointed in him that would give him strength to endure until he was able to finish the work you see you were his appointed power you were his appointed strength and now he was able to use that so that he could become your appointed power in your journey now I want to just read a testimony of the Prophet here where it talks about the shunamite woman in his day and we know that we've we've heard this many times but we find that the the God was was able to hearken unto her her prayer for her son that the prophet going onto his destination God would ground a plane that the prophet would come into contact with this shunamite woman in his day that she would receive power that would sustain her life in her son's life you see now as the prophet came to her the prophet recognized that he had been in King's courts palaces he's prayed in many different big areas but he says they was nothing like that little house there with the shunamite he knew that the the presence of the Lord was there because he recognized there was an atmosphere there was a prayer that was happening you see the shunamite woman there she was interceding for her son and because she had the right attitude because she had the right faithfulness and obedience recognizing that God had a man that was sent to her her her son could receive healing you see now I want to encourage you tonight saints that whatever the situation is if it is a way were child continue to pray for that way child continue to intercede for that way were child because what God has started God will finish you see there was another woman that followed the prophet from meeting to meeting that she would receive healing for her body right she got to a place and I have it here in the message expectations and she got to a place she says I cannot go any further and it was at that point that God manifested himself to her the prophet says and she says the strangest thing happened it said that uh she said this morning I dreamed a dream that I should be standing here in front of this cafeteria at 10 minutes after 9: that was uh that just happens constantly and it was at that specific time according to that dream that the prophet was standing right in front of her and she was troubled in her heart and asked Am I Dreaming she asked Are You The Prophet are you brother brandom brother brandom says yes I am and she received her healing right there you see she had an expectation but God had appointed a power that would sustain her in her journey and I encourage you tonight that God had appointed a power to you tonight for your journey Psalms chapter 1 verse one says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful where are you sitting tonight you're sitting in the presence of God says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season now I would like to tell you that every season is your season no matter what season it is could be the winter fall spring it could be a season of Plenty a season of drought every season is your season God bless [Applause] you dear Lord Jesus father God we thank you tonight Lord for your grace and your mercy oh Father Lord what power you've appointed to us by your Holy Ghost that would sustain us in this hour father God when you said it is finished on the cross oh Father the prophet says every Redemption oh God was laid right there father and Lord you've given us access that whatsoever The Souls of our feet would go Lord is our possession so Lord we hold fast those promises Lord we realize that in those words father lies our healing lies our deliverance lies our restoration for our family amilies lies our Redemption and oh Father God we we don't take it a strange thing Lord when we go through these trials CU we know Lord you're teaching us something that will perfect us that will call us to be like you that will call us to reflect you Lord so father God we thank you tonight oh father that you have called us to be your bride in this hour help us to continue the journey Lord help us to
