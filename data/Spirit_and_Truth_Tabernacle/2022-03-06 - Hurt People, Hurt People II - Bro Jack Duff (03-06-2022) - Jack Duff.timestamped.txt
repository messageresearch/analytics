[6:38] who maketh his angels spirits his
[6:40] ministers a flame of fire
[6:43] who laid the foundations of the earth

[1:03:03] be nine o'clock that saturday morning
[1:03:04] we're going to be helping set up the gym
[1:03:06] getting it ready for the saturday
[1:03:07] morning service now i think this is
[1:03:09] going to be real good
[1:03:10] uh because
[1:03:12] i was
[1:03:13] uh looking forward to kind of giving
[1:03:15] this gym a trial run because we want to
[1:03:18] do some meetings
[1:03:20] amen uh later
[1:03:22] in the year and you know this is 20
[1:03:24] years for us and i believe we should
[1:03:26] celebrate
[1:03:28] uh some kind of way this year we should
[1:03:30] celebrate so uh so we i was just where
[1:03:33] we're gonna do the meeting what are we
[1:03:35] doing and let me let me just mention
[1:03:37] this to you
[1:03:38] it's it's hard to do your meeting in
[1:03:41] another
[1:03:42] church understand it's hard to do that
[1:03:46] uh so so we need a facility where we can
[1:03:49] just be
[1:03:51] okay
[1:03:52] all right y'all get it so so i was
[1:03:55] wanting to see what this gym can do for
[1:03:56] us
[1:03:57] and um and uh and i'm just believing
[1:03:59] that we'll we'll get a real good test at
[1:04:01] it you know on two sundays now so keep
[1:04:03] that in mind other thing i need to
[1:04:05] mention is um the week of the wedding is
[1:04:08] also the week of spring break
[1:04:10] um and so the school has told us that
[1:04:14] ain't nobody gonna be there on wednesday
[1:04:15] night to let y'all in
[1:04:17] so we can't have church on wednesday
[1:04:18] night the week of the wet so we'll have
[1:04:20] church next wednesday but no no the
[1:04:22] following wednesday two weeks now there
[1:04:23] will be no service so keep that in mind
[1:04:26] uh i came here this morning i said lord
[1:04:28] you got to do something for us
[1:04:31] you got to do something jesus
[1:04:34] i mean we we got to get desperate we got
[1:04:36] to start praying and
[1:04:37] seeking the lord this is our this is a
[1:04:39] temporary
[1:04:40] place
[1:04:41] it's like moving through the wilderness
[1:04:44] this is not the promised land
[1:04:48] this ain't it
[1:04:49] amen but i believe god got purpose for
[1:04:52] us being at 3777
[1:04:56] i think god got a reason for that so
[1:04:59] uh but but we're trusting that the lord
[1:05:01] will just kind of guide us on and i just
[1:05:03] want to appreciate you all for your
[1:05:05] continued giving amen you you are
[1:05:08] sharing in the vision amen of what god
[1:05:11] has for us and we are going to enjoy
[1:05:13] amen these uh the great things amen that
[1:05:15] god has in store
[1:05:17] praise god
[1:05:19] all right
[1:05:21] we want to continue our thought hurt
[1:05:22] people
[1:05:25] hurt people
[1:05:27] amen this is our thought for
[1:05:29] uh today part two hurt people
[1:05:32] hurt people um
[1:05:34] just to again give a little definition
[1:05:38] to this
[1:05:39] uh what
[1:05:41] hurt people when when we give that when
[1:05:43] we just use that statement hurt people
[1:05:46] uh we're talking about
[1:05:48] or when we say hurt people hurt people
[1:05:50] we're talking about people who have been
[1:05:52] hurt
[1:05:53] or damaged in life
[1:05:56] um and and as i mentioned on last week
[1:05:59] there's not one person within the sound
[1:06:02] of my voice that has not experienced
[1:06:05] hurt
[1:06:06] in their life
[1:06:07] amen everybody experiences it and um you
[1:06:11] know the thing of it is the the key to
[1:06:14] this is how you respond
[1:06:16] and how you react to it what you do with
[1:06:19] your hurt right is what what matters
[1:06:21] most and uh uh god can take your you
[1:06:25] know your your hurt and make it a man a
[1:06:27] beautiful testimony i believe mom was
[1:06:29] just saying that you know he's making it
[1:06:31] a masterpiece
[1:06:41] um
[1:06:43] you know i was i was sharing just just a
[1:06:46] part of my own personal testimonial last
[1:06:49] last last week
[1:06:51] and um you know just just me going
[1:06:53] through being raised in a home with a a
[1:06:56] stepdad who
[1:06:57] i just he's just dad to me that's that i
[1:07:00] ain't that he's just dad but i know you
[1:07:02] know i had a biological father
[1:07:05] and uh you know
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:08] when divorce happens in the family
[1:07:10] oh god
[1:07:12] lord i i i this wasn't my plan i got
[1:07:15] notes over here
[1:07:17] but but when divorce happens in the
[1:07:19] family there sometimes the kids may
[1:07:21] never understand why that occurred
[1:07:25] uh and and one of the reasons that the
[1:07:27] kids may never understand is that uh the
[1:07:30] parents may not choose to really just
[1:07:32] talk about it and one and one of the
[1:07:34] reasons that the parents choose is not
[1:07:36] to talk about is that they don't want
[1:07:38] the child
[1:07:39] to grow up with a particular
[1:07:42] thought process concerning one of the
[1:07:45] other parents
[1:07:47] they try to keep it between them
[1:07:49] you understand that's what parents try
[1:07:51] to do and and kids why this and why that
[1:07:54] and you know you got to understand
[1:07:55] sometimes there are things happen in
[1:07:57] life that you didn't plan for
[1:08:00] you weren't looking you weren't
[1:08:01] expecting this to happen but but it but
[1:08:03] it does
[1:08:04] right and uh and i can say that going
[1:08:07] through this amen just myself going
[1:08:09] through this in my own family uh my mom
[1:08:13] never did anything to to bring my father
[1:08:15] down
[1:08:16] she never said anything in any way to
[1:08:18] bring my dad down in any light uh you
[1:08:22] know and in all actuality you know for
[1:08:24] me to understand it was later on in my
[1:08:26] life where i caught uh understanding
[1:08:28] what what really happened and it was an
[1:08:29] uncle that had to tell me what really
[1:08:31] happened
[1:08:32] right and uh and and i just remember one
[1:08:34] time we were on our way to to london
[1:08:36] amen for easter amen going over to be
[1:08:39] with brother brother gwen and the
[1:08:40] believers and and we had to go through
[1:08:42] the detroit airport because when i was a
[1:08:44] little boy that's where i lived i was
[1:08:46] born here in west palm but i lived in
[1:08:48] detroit for about a year and uh and as
[1:08:50] we were going through the detroit
[1:08:51] airport mom just was standing by my side
[1:08:53] and mom made a statement she says you
[1:08:55] know the last time i i had you in this
[1:08:57] airport i was running for my life
[1:09:01] but now i'm running to give life
[1:09:07] and
[1:09:08] and as as she's going to to to london
[1:09:10] and and people are blessed by the songs
[1:09:12] that she has written you know her son is
[1:09:14] coming amen with her to preach the
[1:09:16] gospel and it's just you know it's just
[1:09:18] a beautiful thing to see how god can
[1:09:20] turn things around
[1:09:23] god can make your hurt god can take your
[1:09:25] hurt and make a great testimony out of
[1:09:27] it
[1:09:28] amen it's how it's what you choose to do
[1:09:30] with it amen if you want to dwell in it
[1:09:33] you you can choose to do that but i say
[1:09:35] no i'ma choose to just give god glory in
[1:09:38] the midst of it just just the mere fact
[1:09:40] that i was born in sin and shaped and
[1:09:42] iniquity i could not change amen the way
[1:09:45] i got here i could i couldn't help i had
[1:09:47] nothing to do with any of that i
[1:09:49] couldn't choose the family i couldn't i
[1:09:51] couldn't choose the circumstance i
[1:09:53] couldn't choose nothing
[1:09:55] god allowed it for a reason and what
[1:09:57] i've learned to do is give god praise in
[1:09:59] the midst of everything i'm going
[1:10:01] through
[1:10:02] can i tell you something i am not broken
[1:10:06] i'm better
[1:10:09] hey i'm blessed
[1:10:12] glory to god that's the way i choose to
[1:10:14] look at myself i am blessed no matter
[1:10:17] what i've gone through no matter what
[1:10:19] i'm gonna go through hey i'm fully
[1:10:22] persuaded
[1:10:23] that nothing present nor nothing in the
[1:10:26] past nor nothing that will come hey
[1:10:29] hallelujah i'm fully persuaded that
[1:10:32] these things will not separate me from
[1:10:35] the love of god
[1:10:37] which is in christ jesus my lord
[1:10:42] i'm fully persuaded
[1:10:44] i'm gonna keep pressing on
[1:10:46] i'm gonna keep going home
[1:10:49] i gotta go ahead on the inside
[1:10:55] glory to god it's how you choose to
[1:10:59] respond to it
[1:11:02] glory hallelujah
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:08] i know there's many people that's not in
[1:11:10] church today they they they hurt
[1:11:14] and some of them some of them uh and
[1:11:16] some of us are hurt from some of our own
[1:11:18] decisions
[1:11:21] we've made bad decisions
[1:11:24] and we hurt ourselves we've inflicted
[1:11:26] pain like i mentioned last week what
[1:11:27] happens is when you get hurt
[1:11:30] uh if you've ever gotten sick or or ill
[1:11:33] or anything um typically what happens
[1:11:35] with a person who gets sick they
[1:11:36] actually retreat
[1:11:39] that's very normal if i if i if
[1:11:42] whether it's a cold
[1:11:43] uh uh uh if you had you know
[1:11:46] this this virus uh
[1:11:48] covet uh they want you to retreat
[1:11:52] right and you should because it can
[1:11:54] spread and but but what happens that you
[1:11:56] isolate
[1:11:57] i'm talking now amen you isolate and
[1:12:00] spiritually when people get hurt they
[1:12:02] begin to isolate
[1:12:05] they begin to avoid church
[1:12:07] they begin to avoid amen uh they're
[1:12:10] there i mean let's look at adam and eve
[1:12:12] they brought pain on themselves
[1:12:15] god said don't eat from don't eat from
[1:12:17] the tree they decided to go against
[1:12:19] god's word it brought pain on themselves
[1:12:22] and what happened they began to isolate
[1:12:24] when it was time for church they
[1:12:26] couldn't be found
[1:12:28] i mean here they are i mean god god god
[1:12:30] expected like okay yeah we gonna go and
[1:12:32] we're gonna have a good service and
[1:12:35] and maybe god got a sermon prepared
[1:12:38] and i just want to talk to my children i
[1:12:41] want to give them the word today and and
[1:12:43] when they get to church god found
[1:12:45] himself there alone
[1:12:47] so god had to leave church
[1:12:50] no no no let me let me let me let me let
[1:12:52] let me you know let let me let you in on
[1:12:54] a secret it ain't like god don't know
[1:12:56] where you're at
[1:13:00] it ain't like he don't know where you at
[1:13:02] you trying to hide
[1:13:04] you know well we're here and god like
[1:13:06] now we did this every day what happened
[1:13:08] why didn't he let church today what's
[1:13:09] going on
[1:13:10] um
[1:13:11] and he had to leave church say adam
[1:13:14] and adam that you can hear when his
[1:13:16] voice when it when when he heard his
[1:13:17] name being called like oh
[1:13:19] lord
[1:13:20] trying to hide
[1:13:22] adam
[1:13:23] adam
[1:13:25] where art thou now remember that
[1:13:26] question is not a question that god need
[1:13:29] clarification on
[1:13:31] god just god is trying to get adam to a
[1:13:34] spot
[1:13:37] and i don't even know if adam really got
[1:13:39] there
[1:13:39] but he was trying to get out into the
[1:13:41] spot that when you do wrong
[1:13:44] when you're hurt when you don't hurt
[1:13:46] yourself
[1:13:48] bring your hurt to me
[1:13:51] adam don't try to fix it yourself
[1:13:53] don't don't try to mend this thing
[1:13:55] yourself because you ain't gonna never
[1:13:56] be able to do that and many people
[1:13:58] that's watching even the stream trying
[1:14:00] to fix to hurt themselves you got to
[1:14:02] bring it to the lord
[1:14:05] and you know you got to deal with
[1:14:06] whatever consequence come with it
[1:14:09] and that's what i don't have to be able
[1:14:10] to deal with the consequences
[1:14:13] of self-inflicted
[1:14:15] hurt
[1:14:20] hurt people hurt people
[1:14:22] we're all uh suffering today because of
[1:14:25] what happened in the garden of eden but
[1:14:27] but like brother branham said you can't
[1:14:28] put it all on adam because you're making
[1:14:30] decisions today
[1:14:32] that's also against the word of god and
[1:14:34] and you got to learn how to choose
[1:14:36] choose life
[1:14:37] all right let me go on here amen in um
[1:14:40] in this
[1:14:41] there's um
[1:14:44] just a a a
[1:14:46] um
[1:14:47] dictionary definition
[1:14:49] uh hurt is cause of physical pain or
[1:14:53] injury
[1:14:55] um
[1:14:57] it's the cause of physical pain or
[1:14:59] injury to that's what they say and and
[1:15:01] they use the example of ow you're
[1:15:03] hurting me
[1:15:04] you ever told somebody that you know you
[1:15:07] hurting me i mean you stop
[1:15:09] you know that that don't feel good i
[1:15:12] would
[1:15:12] how how would you feel if i did the same
[1:15:14] thing to you
[1:15:16] i mean that's that's a that's how we
[1:15:17] respond hurt people hurt people right
[1:15:20] but but that's what hurt is but it's
[1:15:21] also
[1:15:22] uh it also is a cause of mental pain
[1:15:26] or distress
[1:15:28] to a person
[1:15:30] or to their feelings
[1:15:32] so so so so mental pain to the person or
[1:15:37] mental pain to their feelings or
[1:15:39] distress to the person or distressed to
[1:15:42] their feelings
[1:15:43] oh my
[1:15:45] sometimes people avoid saying things
[1:15:47] because they don't want to hurt
[1:15:50] your feelings
[1:15:52] hallelujah
[1:15:54] right and and in church you know we we
[1:15:56] have to be able to tell you the truth we
[1:15:58] can't you know we're not trying to hurt
[1:16:00] your feelings like like brother sean i
[1:16:02] love the way he used to say it we're not
[1:16:04] trying to pick on you in church we're
[1:16:07] actually trying to pick off you
[1:16:10] because the devil trying to everything
[1:16:12] he can to try to get you tricked and and
[1:16:14] get you falling into some uh some great
[1:16:17] sin but when you end up missing a
[1:16:18] rapture we want to make sure you make
[1:16:20] the rapture
[1:16:22] but we have to tell you the truth and
[1:16:24] you know what
[1:16:26] the truth
[1:16:32] the truth hurts
[1:16:35] and i think the reason why the truth
[1:16:37] hurts because people want to do
[1:16:38] something against the truth
[1:16:40] but when you want to yield to the truth
[1:16:43] then the truth don't hurt as much
[1:16:46] let's look at amen a few things here i
[1:16:48] was just kind of thinking in my mind
[1:16:50] this hurt people hurt people
[1:16:52] started all the way back in the garden
[1:16:54] of eden
[1:16:55] and uh when we when we look at you know
[1:16:58] just a product of what happened from uh
[1:17:01] uh from adam and eve amen and actually
[1:17:04] before adam and eve it was it was even a
[1:17:07] serpent
[1:17:08] amen as a product of what happened cain
[1:17:10] was born from this union of eve in the
[1:17:13] serpent amen and here you know god has
[1:17:17] this um
[1:17:18] you know uh uh uh you know not not that
[1:17:21] god made them come and and bring an
[1:17:24] offering this was something that they
[1:17:25] did out of the kindness of their own
[1:17:26] heart they wanted to worship god i mean
[1:17:29] can you imagine adam telling amen the
[1:17:33] family about who his father was
[1:17:36] can you imagine adam talking about his
[1:17:38] daddy
[1:17:40] right my dad it is and my daddy created
[1:17:43] this and my daddy created that
[1:17:46] and and my daddy did this and and my
[1:17:49] daddy did that and and i remember you
[1:17:51] know see that animal right there i
[1:17:53] remember the first time i saw it because
[1:17:54] my daddy brought the animal to me and he
[1:17:57] told me to name the animal or i said my
[1:18:00] daddy is awesome my daddy is mighty my
[1:18:03] daddy is great
[1:18:05] ain't nobody like my daddy
[1:18:08] i can just imagine some of the
[1:18:10] conversations that were being held
[1:18:13] and maybe through these conversations i
[1:18:15] told you my imagination just goes it
[1:18:17] plays tricks on me so some
[1:18:19] maybe through uh maybe through some of
[1:18:21] the conversations these boys begin to
[1:18:23] develop a man of
[1:18:25] and wanting to know amen their
[1:18:28] grandfather in a different way
[1:18:34] that's a powerful statement right there
[1:18:37] hallelujah but here you know they just i
[1:18:40] said we want to bring an offering
[1:18:42] and we want to worship
[1:18:44] we want to praise him and here comes
[1:18:47] cain with his offering fruit of the
[1:18:49] ground and all this that he done you
[1:18:51] know they didn't indeed and and then
[1:18:53] he'll come able with his offering with a
[1:18:55] bloody lamb
[1:18:56] and he'd take it and give it to god and
[1:18:58] and when god sees both offenders say oh
[1:19:01] my i love what abel just gave me but
[1:19:04] cain i really don't like that you don't
[1:19:06] you don't realize came the very thing
[1:19:08] that i cursed the ground is what i
[1:19:09] cursed because of what adam did in the
[1:19:11] garden so you're bringing the very thing
[1:19:13] a curse back into my presence no i don't
[1:19:15] like that but if you give me the same
[1:19:17] thing your brother just gave me i will
[1:19:19] accept it
[1:19:21] but it was not in king
[1:19:23] it was not in cain
[1:19:25] to be able to just obey the word of god
[1:19:29] oh lord help us right there
[1:19:31] it was not in cain to be able to just
[1:19:33] accept what god said because like i said
[1:19:36] the truth
[1:19:37] hurts
[1:19:38] and this truth that god gave can't hurt
[1:19:40] him to his core he's like you know what
[1:19:42] i tell you what you won't take this i
[1:19:44] got another way to get you to accept
[1:19:46] mine because it won't be nobody else
[1:19:48] coming to church
[1:19:50] when i get done it won't be nobody else
[1:19:53] coming to church to offer you nothing
[1:19:54] i'll make sure that you accept mine
[1:19:58] and came
[1:19:59] as a hurt person
[1:20:02] as a hurt person his feelings are hurt
[1:20:06] that god will not accept his sacrifice
[1:20:09] his feelings are hurt and her people
[1:20:14] hurt people
[1:20:16] so he decides to take his own brother
[1:20:18] out
[1:20:19] kill his own brother as a murderer he
[1:20:21] was a hurt man on the inside
[1:20:24] see this is what happens even in church
[1:20:26] we see the same spirit and people today
[1:20:28] you know they will they will hurt you if
[1:20:30] they've been hurt they will hurt you
[1:20:33] if god don't deal with that hurt
[1:20:37] we see this pattern all the way in
[1:20:40] scripture way back at the beginning hurt
[1:20:42] people are hurting people
[1:20:44] i want to um
[1:20:47] you know pick up here
[1:20:49] uh in in the book of uh first samuel i
[1:20:52] don't know if i wrote that one down but
[1:20:54] i'll give it to you first samuel 15 is
[1:20:56] where i want to go to uh we're just
[1:20:58] going to kind of watch this kind of go
[1:20:59] through the scripture there there's so
[1:21:00] many hurt people in scripture that we
[1:21:02] can see
[1:21:03] so many hurt people
[1:21:05] uh this one is going to be the story of
[1:21:08] saul
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:13] saul was a hurt person and remember you
[1:21:15] can get your feelings hurt
[1:21:17] and sometimes when you're dealing with
[1:21:19] that emotional level uh that's what's
[1:21:22] happening on the inside yeah we all come
[1:21:24] here to church and we you know glory
[1:21:26] hallelujah and praising god and
[1:21:28] everything else but oftentimes you don't
[1:21:30] know what a person really going through
[1:21:31] on the inside
[1:21:34] and i'm going to tell you another thing
[1:21:35] sometimes you don't know why amen a
[1:21:37] person does things on the outside
[1:21:40] oh lord can i can i can i can i'm just
[1:21:44] i'm gonna just you know just talk a
[1:21:45] little bit i'm going to the scripture
[1:21:47] but you know um
[1:21:49] i was just thinking this you know
[1:21:50] sometimes sisters fight
[1:21:53] uh with um
[1:21:55] certain things you know of the world you
[1:21:58] know maybe with um
[1:21:59] they might fight with makeup they might
[1:22:01] fight with all these things and i'm
[1:22:02] gonna tell you some of the sister fight
[1:22:04] in that way because they husbands
[1:22:07] have hurt them
[1:22:13] the husband will not give a compliment
[1:22:16] the husband will always tell you how
[1:22:17] much weight you're putting on
[1:22:20] the husband tell you all you know you
[1:22:22] this and you dad and you need to look
[1:22:23] like sister so and so she ain't built
[1:22:26] like sister so-and-so
[1:22:27] god didn't desire her to be like sister
[1:22:29] sarsa and brother you got to learn how
[1:22:31] to take your tongue and give positive
[1:22:33] words of affirmation
[1:22:38] because now she got to feel like she had
[1:22:39] to compete with somebody else your eye
[1:22:41] always wondering
[1:22:46] it's the truth in the eye your eyes get
[1:22:48] the wandering but god gave you a wife or
[1:22:50] you ain't got to wander no more
[1:22:55] and you don't realize you are inflicting
[1:22:57] hurt
[1:22:59] same thing sister with your husband you
[1:23:01] got the you married him
[1:23:04] praise god you made him for something
[1:23:08] and i i ain't seen nobody put no gun in
[1:23:10] your head and make you marry him you mad
[1:23:13] him for something
[1:23:16] right so you go you got to tell him how
[1:23:18] good he looked
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] praise praise the lord any high
[1:23:26] losing hair losing teeth losing
[1:23:28] everything but you still got to love him
[1:23:35] oh y'all ain't gonna talk to me
[1:23:42] yeah young men need to hear these things
[1:23:44] cause they look at her sister now and
[1:23:46] they oh boy look at oh boy she got this
[1:23:48] she got that
[1:23:49] as life
[1:23:51] continues to go on
[1:23:53] she's going to lose those things that
[1:23:54] she had
[1:23:56] and you're going to be attracted
[1:23:57] something more
[1:23:59] than all that
[1:24:02] when children come
[1:24:05] things change
[1:24:08] and you have to let her know how pretty
[1:24:10] she look
[1:24:11] all right now
[1:24:13] but sister sometimes they get hurt and
[1:24:15] that's why they go after some of these
[1:24:16] things because they it's a hurt on the
[1:24:18] inside
[1:24:20] they have not been a man told by their
[1:24:22] husband it's one thing if one man
[1:24:24] another man out here tell you that but
[1:24:26] it's a whole nother thing with your
[1:24:27] husband speaking
[1:24:30] so another thing when the wife speaks it
[1:24:33] praise the lord somebody
[1:24:35] amen amen amen amen
[1:24:39] oh
[1:24:42] it's the truth anyhow but this this is
[1:24:44] how we this how we keep things together
[1:24:47] and you gotta understand people be
[1:24:48] dealing with stuff on the inside if you
[1:24:50] don't if you don't if you don't really
[1:24:51] minister to the inside you know you
[1:24:54] you'll you'll never really get them to
[1:24:56] where where they need to be and you know
[1:24:58] um
[1:25:01] i think i told you all last week how
[1:25:02] brother branham suffered from suicidal
[1:25:04] thoughts
[1:25:06] anybody in here that's ever suffered
[1:25:08] from suicidal thoughts i need you to
[1:25:10] understand something you ain't by
[1:25:11] yourself
[1:25:14] satan has been using that demon for a
[1:25:15] long time
[1:25:17] but here's the problem
[1:25:19] when we when we when we fight with it
[1:25:21] some must glorify it
[1:25:24] by telling everybody what we fighting
[1:25:26] with
[1:25:27] i don't do that
[1:25:29] you ain't gonna know everything i'm
[1:25:30] fighting with
[1:25:31] you don't need to know everything i'm
[1:25:33] fighting with
[1:25:35] because actually as i'm sharing with you
[1:25:37] now you're gonna fight with it
[1:25:40] right but but you don't have to go
[1:25:41] telling everybody what you're fighting
[1:25:43] with what i find what i find oftentimes
[1:25:45] when people do that because i've seen
[1:25:46] this i've seen it i've seen it plenty of
[1:25:48] times i i've had cousins to do it and i
[1:25:50] mean it i i you know i just want to let
[1:25:53] everybody know i'm this well
[1:25:55] you got to tell us that we we know you
[1:25:57] got some problems
[1:25:59] all of us got problems
[1:26:02] the the question is do you want to be
[1:26:04] delivered
[1:26:05] do you want to be set free because just
[1:26:08] because you tell everybody don't mean
[1:26:10] you gonna go free because you told
[1:26:12] everybody you got to take that thing to
[1:26:14] the ulta and you got to pray through
[1:26:18] until god set you free from it
[1:26:21] but here's what i'm going to i want to
[1:26:22] let you know what i find
[1:26:24] is that people that release things like
[1:26:26] this they're hurting on the inside
[1:26:29] they're hurting on the inside so they
[1:26:30] have to just release it so other people
[1:26:33] kind of feel they hurt
[1:26:35] this is why they do this
[1:26:37] and like i told you a hurt person always
[1:26:40] feels like they're the victim
[1:26:43] you're not the victim
[1:26:44] you're just having a normal life just
[1:26:46] like the rest of us
[1:26:53] you having a normal life just like the
[1:26:54] rest of us
[1:26:55] now now look now y'all what you go
[1:26:58] through might be a little different than
[1:26:59] what i go through and let me tell you
[1:27:00] something god knew that you could handle
[1:27:03] what you're going through
[1:27:06] that's why he gave it to you
[1:27:09] and look you might not be able to handle
[1:27:11] the things i go through that's why god
[1:27:12] didn't give it to you like that
[1:27:14] but the things that you're going through
[1:27:16] god knew you could handle it
[1:27:19] if you don't believe that go back and
[1:27:21] read the book of job
[1:27:23] go back and read the book
[1:27:25] when job job with job job sitting there
[1:27:27] a man just mind his own business and
[1:27:29] there's a conversation that took place
[1:27:31] in another atmosphere
[1:27:33] have you considered my servant joe
[1:27:37] i did but you got this big old hedge
[1:27:38] around him then ain't no way i'll tell
[1:27:40] you what i'll take the hedge from around
[1:27:41] him i'll let you take the hedge around i
[1:27:43] guarantee he still won't curse me and
[1:27:45] he'll still worship me
[1:27:46] all right i'm i'm gonna take you up on
[1:27:48] this i'm gonna take his i'm gonna take
[1:27:49] it i'm gonna hit his business
[1:27:52] i'm gonna hit his body

[1:27:56] i'ma hit everything and watch this man
[1:27:58] gonna curse you no no i guarantee he
[1:28:01] won't do it go ahead and do it get the
[1:28:02] only thing you can't do is take his life
[1:28:05] hey
[1:28:06] ain't god good
[1:28:08] i don't know if y'all caught it but what
[1:28:09] what i'm what i'm here to tell you with
[1:28:11] all your hurt
[1:28:13] all your troubles
[1:28:14] all your trials all your tribulations
[1:28:18] all your distresses
[1:28:20] all your pain
[1:28:22] there is a boundary
[1:28:26] that has been established by god
[1:28:30] that satan you can do this but you can't
[1:28:33] do that
[1:28:35] and that's why suicide could not take
[1:28:38] you out
[1:28:39] because there was a boundary set me all
[1:28:43] around you safe cannot cross over that
[1:28:46] boundary
[1:28:47] it's just like this the the the the
[1:28:50] waves of the ocean they can only come so
[1:28:52] far into lane
[1:28:55] but because god established a boundary
[1:28:58] they have to go back out into the ocean
[1:29:01] brother i see satan just creeping up
[1:29:03] creeping up but when he get here he got
[1:29:05] to stop
[1:29:08] glory to god that's why you can worship
[1:29:11] that's why you can praise no matter what
[1:29:13] you're going through you know the devil
[1:29:15] has amen has been has a battle reset for
[1:29:18] him
[1:29:20] his demons have a boundary set
[1:29:24] no further than this
[1:29:27] no further than this
[1:29:30] you can take the child
[1:29:32] you can take the job
[1:29:34] you can affect the business
[1:29:37] but that's as far as you go don't touch
[1:29:39] and even you can give him a sickness
[1:29:41] but it cannot be a sickness unto death
[1:29:46] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:29:49] according to a man um
[1:29:53] the uh the
[1:29:55] it was the original bible i forget which
[1:29:57] language it was
[1:29:58] uh my uh oh lord have mercy before they
[1:30:01] brought into the english language right
[1:30:03] now i can't think of it right now
[1:30:05] uh aramaic aramaic when when that when
[1:30:08] they write that scripture about job and
[1:30:10] him sitting on the ash sheep it said job
[1:30:12] was actually dealing with cancer
[1:30:15] cancer was not a disease unto death for
[1:30:17] job
[1:30:21] cancer was not i don't care if they said
[1:30:23] stage four
[1:30:25] but cancer was not a disease unto death
[1:30:28] for joe
[1:30:30] when god has set boundaries god has set
[1:30:32] boundaries
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:40] you know going through and and even
[1:30:42] getting so bad till his wife comes to
[1:30:43] him and says why don't you just curse
[1:30:45] god and die i mean it's this bad joke
[1:30:46] this bad because curse curse
[1:30:49] god and die and he in and even in this
[1:30:53] difficult
[1:30:54] state
[1:30:58] job ain't got no friends to encourage
[1:30:59] him
[1:31:00] and now his own wife
[1:31:02] that's why we got to watch what we say
[1:31:03] as as spouses
[1:31:06] his own wife is is coming against him
[1:31:08] but job even in that moment he says um
[1:31:12] you talk like a foolish woman now i like
[1:31:15] the way he put it because he could have
[1:31:17] said you're a foolish woman
[1:31:20] but he didn't say that
[1:31:22] he didn't say you're a foolish woman
[1:31:24] because job no he married no fool
[1:31:29] i said that to say this you didn't marry
[1:31:31] no fool either
[1:31:34] so don't be calling each other fools
[1:31:41] you talk like a foolish woman
[1:31:45] well god gave me this god gave me that
[1:31:47] god gave me this and now i'm going
[1:31:48] through i'm just supposed to curse him
[1:31:50] no no no no no no
[1:31:52] i mean the lord give the lord take it
[1:31:53] away
[1:31:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:57] it's your attitude
[1:31:59] in the midst of what you're going
[1:32:00] through
[1:32:01] what's your attitude
[1:32:03] what's your attitude
[1:32:06] let's look at uh saul over here first
[1:32:08] ceremony 15. i i i brought this out a
[1:32:11] few weeks ago in spirit and truth 2.0
[1:32:13] and i'm bringing it back again
[1:32:15] because it's something we need to be
[1:32:16] warned of warned of
[1:32:20] saul was a hurt person
[1:32:23] because
[1:32:25] he was rejected as king first he was
[1:32:28] placed as king and then he was rejected
[1:32:29] as king and the reason he was rejected
[1:32:32] is because he couldn't follow the word
[1:32:33] of god
[1:32:35] oh hallelujah the reason this man was
[1:32:38] rejected is because he could not follow
[1:32:40] the word of god everything that the
[1:32:43] prophet told him to do he failed to do
[1:32:45] it
[1:32:47] so we pick up here in first 15 where you
[1:32:50] know this is where he rejected word of
[1:32:52] god and
[1:32:53] and and what what happened that he was
[1:32:55] supposed to um
[1:32:56] wait so many days for the prophet samuel
[1:32:59] to come and and then they were going to
[1:33:00] make some sacrifices they're going to do
[1:33:02] some things and and what what saul says
[1:33:04] you know i was waiting for you to come
[1:33:06] but you didn't come in the time that i
[1:33:07] thought you should come
[1:33:09] and i saw the people start doing this
[1:33:11] and start doing that so i figured i'd
[1:33:13] just take it upon myself to start
[1:33:15] offering these animals
[1:33:17] that's what i felt i would do i just
[1:33:18] take this upon myself so so here you
[1:33:20] know as as as they're taking it upon
[1:33:22] themselves
[1:33:23] as he's taking upon himself then you
[1:33:25] know he get rebuked now let's look at it
[1:33:27] first samuel 15. first samuel 15.
[1:33:30] it says this and samuel said
[1:33:34] uh have the lord as great delight
[1:33:38] and burnt offerings and sacrifices
[1:33:41] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:33:44] can i i'm gonna go a little further with
[1:33:45] this amen uh on this particular uh uh
[1:33:49] scripture
[1:33:50] duke is god just satisfied with your
[1:33:53] tithes and offering
[1:33:57] or does he want full obedience from you
[1:34:02] all right i'ma tell you when god got
[1:34:04] full obedience from you it will be
[1:34:06] demonstrated in your tithes and
[1:34:08] offerings
[1:34:10] and many other areas of your life
[1:34:12] right but but he says as samuel said
[1:34:15] have the lord as great delight and burn
[1:34:17] offerings and sacrifices
[1:34:19] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:34:22] behold to obey my god is better than
[1:34:26] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:34:30] rams to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:34:33] look and look at this verse 23 for
[1:34:35] rebellion
[1:34:37] when we when we rebel against the word
[1:34:38] of god for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:34:41] witchcraft and
[1:34:44] stubbornness i i preach and you know
[1:34:47] sometimes you're preaching people still
[1:34:49] be stubborn after you preaching
[1:34:51] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:34:55] because thou has rejected
[1:34:58] the word of the lord he also he hath
[1:35:00] also rejected thee from being king
[1:35:04] i want you to understand when this man
[1:35:05] gets this this man is is hurt
[1:35:08] if we were to read on in that scripture
[1:35:09] i i didn't i didn't pull it up um let me
[1:35:12] see something here uh we we were oh yeah
[1:35:15] i think yeah let me just find something
[1:35:16] here real quick uh what that was uh
[1:35:19] first sammy 15. uh uh if we'll see that
[1:35:22] you know he was trying to
[1:35:24] um
[1:35:26] uh he was trying to get the uh samuel to
[1:35:28] count and go along with his sacrifice
[1:35:30] that he just made
[1:35:31] and uh and when when samuel kind of
[1:35:33] rebuked him and and told him that you
[1:35:35] know he was rejected let me see
[1:35:37] something here that was first ceremony
[1:35:38] 15 22. uh i want to just show you one
[1:35:41] other thing this is a hurt person this
[1:35:42] is a hurt person right here in the
[1:35:44] scripture
[1:35:45] um i don't want to go too far in this so
[1:35:47] let me just see something here
[1:35:49] um
[1:35:52] i won't i'll leave it on i'll just tell
[1:35:54] you
[1:35:55] he wanted he wanted he wanted he wanted
[1:35:56] the approval of the prophet even though
[1:35:58] he had been rejected and what he decided
[1:36:01] to do and he's like well just just kind
[1:36:03] of go along with me on this go along
[1:36:05] with me he's like no i can't he reached
[1:36:07] out and somehow tore the prophet's
[1:36:09] garment
[1:36:11] hallelujah cause hurt people will hurt
[1:36:14] people right and he reached out and he
[1:36:15] just kind of tore the prophet's
[1:36:16] government and like like look you know
[1:36:18] what what are you doing he got rebuked
[1:36:20] even further for what he did like all
[1:36:22] god wants you to do is repent
[1:36:25] but he refused to repent
[1:36:27] let me tell you something this this hurt
[1:36:28] man
[1:36:29] this hurt man
[1:36:31] began to drive not only
[1:36:34] uh the nation just haywire his
[1:36:36] leadership tactics oh god help me lord
[1:36:40] his leadership tactics were just
[1:36:42] uncontrollable
[1:36:44] his um
[1:36:46] uh
[1:36:47] it got so bad that you know his own son
[1:36:51] is trying to talk to him about different
[1:36:52] things and and and
[1:36:54] and and sad assault is actually throwing
[1:36:56] javelins
[1:36:58] at his own son
[1:37:00] not just that david but he's throwing
[1:37:02] javelins at his own son sometimes you
[1:37:04] might go through a situation with your
[1:37:07] family members maybe your mom might say
[1:37:09] something or your dad might say someone
[1:37:11] uncle or auntie or somebody might say
[1:37:12] something a little sharp at you hey man
[1:37:14] sometimes you got to understand they're
[1:37:16] dealing with some internal hurt
[1:37:19] and the reason is coming out that way
[1:37:20] against you because amen oftentimes hurt
[1:37:23] people feel the most comfortable with
[1:37:25] those that they love the most
[1:37:27] so they end up hurting the ones that are
[1:37:29] closest to them
[1:37:31] hurt people
[1:37:32] hurt people
[1:37:34] can i go a little further
[1:37:37] in a church
[1:37:39] if the pastor
[1:37:41] is hurt
[1:37:44] the ones that are most comfortable
[1:37:46] the ones that are most amen that he
[1:37:48] feels the closest to them the ones
[1:37:50] that's going to get hurt the most by
[1:37:52] it's going to be his family
[1:37:54] and it's going to be the church
[1:37:57] hurt people
[1:38:01] hurt people
[1:38:03] let me uh i i want to read about a
[1:38:06] little man here this is going to be a
[1:38:08] lengthy quote
[1:38:09] and i think it's going to be very
[1:38:11] important i'll come back to first samuel
[1:38:13] here the saul was hurt
[1:38:16] then he took it to uh to david now let
[1:38:18] me just read something
[1:38:20] hurt people i mean saul's leadership
[1:38:22] just completely changed
[1:38:25] after he got hurt
[1:38:29] i want to read from the message um
[1:38:32] hebrews
[1:38:34] chapter six this is a sermon that
[1:38:35] brother branham preached
[1:38:37] and um i want you to just kind of stay
[1:38:39] with me here this this this man that i'm
[1:38:42] gonna read about was a minister
[1:38:46] that got hurt
[1:38:48] this man got hurt
[1:38:50] and um and because of the hurt you know
[1:38:52] and can i just be honest there's so many
[1:38:55] things that could cause a pastor to get
[1:38:57] hurt often times it's sometimes uh just
[1:39:01] the way the the the the church
[1:39:04] handles things the way they do things
[1:39:06] amen sometimes somebody in the church
[1:39:08] can do something that could just hurt a
[1:39:10] pastor and i'm gonna tell you this
[1:39:12] there's some people that intentionally
[1:39:14] try to hurt
[1:39:18] they and it's intentional
[1:39:20] and and and sometimes you just have to
[1:39:22] be able to kind of go right through it
[1:39:24] just don't worry about it just keep
[1:39:26] pressing on
[1:39:27] amen
[1:39:29] let's let's read this about this man
[1:39:32] it says now if you commit sin
[1:39:36] here you're gonna pay for it
[1:39:38] it's just just keep coming in my mind
[1:39:42] i just got to tell it i've tried to
[1:39:44] quench it all four or five times i have
[1:39:45] to say it
[1:39:47] how how many remembers this brother
[1:39:50] pastor that used to be over here at the
[1:39:52] church of god
[1:39:53] brother right up here
[1:39:55] what was his name
[1:39:56] work for vorgin down there
[1:39:59] the first church of god right here on
[1:40:01] the corner or used to sell uh uh
[1:40:03] raleigh's in the time of the depression
[1:40:06] a real godly saintly man
[1:40:10] brother smith took his place up there
[1:40:12] i'll call his name in a few minutes he
[1:40:14] was a god-saved
[1:40:16] man
[1:40:18] remember if you if you don't if you
[1:40:20] don't if you don't walk up to the
[1:40:22] correction
[1:40:23] see we just talk about you know uh
[1:40:25] obedience is better than the sacrifice
[1:40:27] if you don't walk up to
[1:40:30] the correction
[1:40:32] and you do something wrong as a
[1:40:34] christian
[1:40:36] god
[1:40:37] will
[1:40:38] warn you
[1:40:41] god will warn you and then if you don't
[1:40:44] take the warning
[1:40:46] he will just take you right off the

[1:42:05] christian that mean they talking about
[1:42:07] the things of god and and the spirit of
[1:42:09] god is so so so present that these men
[1:42:12] are holding hands and crying together
[1:42:14] this is a
[1:42:16] genuine experience that this man has had
[1:42:18] but something has gone wrong in his life
[1:42:20] and now he's hurt
[1:42:22] he's hurt
[1:42:24] he's hurt you know people can come to
[1:42:26] church for years and and just enjoy the
[1:42:28] presence of the lord but something
[1:42:29] happens and they get hurt
[1:42:34] lord we've got to heal to hurt people
[1:42:36] god
[1:42:37] look at this
[1:42:40] it says one day i went
[1:42:42] into it down there just come from come
[1:42:44] uh from overseas in a meeting
[1:42:47] had my car checked up brother ramsey
[1:42:49] said what can i do for you billy

[1:42:53] the oil okay he said fine dandy said you
[1:42:56] have a nice meeting you asking brother
[1:42:58] branham you have a nice meeting i said
[1:43:00] oh brother ramsey it was wonderful i
[1:43:02] said i wish you could go with me
[1:43:04] sometime
[1:43:05] why don't you go with me now i want you
[1:43:07] to just get this i want you to get this
[1:43:10] imagine the man that used to hold hands
[1:43:13] with me
[1:43:14] and we were weeping crying because this
[1:43:16] president of the lord was so real
[1:43:18] now he got so tight with me that we
[1:43:21] can't really talk about nothing when i
[1:43:22] come into his presence this man is hurt
[1:43:26] and and what what what's going on now
[1:43:27] all the man say did you have a nice
[1:43:29] meeting brother branham
[1:43:31] no more holding hands and crying and all
[1:43:33] that this man is hurt and and watch what
[1:43:35] happens here now watch what happens it

[1:43:46] he said i don't i don't serve the lord
[1:43:48] no more billy
[1:43:51] now there's a couple of things that i
[1:43:53] see here first he doesn't backslit
[1:43:55] and what caused him to backslide is that
[1:43:57] he's been hurt i want to tell you as
[1:43:59] many people out there right now
[1:44:02] the reason that they're there is because
[1:44:04] they've been hurt on the inside and if
[1:44:07] god can bring some healing to the inside
[1:44:09] you'll see it manifested on the outside
[1:44:14] he says i don't serve the lord no more
[1:44:16] billy
[1:44:17] i looked around and said what'd you say
[1:44:20] he just kind of said i don't serve him
[1:44:22] no more
[1:44:23] and walked away
[1:44:25] i thought oh he's just going on i went
[1:44:27] on went somewhere come back and got in
[1:44:29] my car i come up home i begin to think
[1:44:31] about that i don't serve the lord no
[1:44:33] more the lord put it on my heart to go
[1:44:36] back and ask him again so i said meter
[1:44:38] just hold the fort
[1:44:40] and i got in and got in my car went back
[1:44:42] down stopped again went into vorgens i
[1:44:45] said brother ramsey i want to ask you a
[1:44:47] question he's not coming to get his car
[1:44:49] fixed now he's going to try to get this
[1:44:50] heart fixed
[1:44:52] he says he says all right billy what is
[1:44:54] it i said you said a while ago you don't
[1:44:57] serve the lord no more you were just
[1:44:59] teasing me wasn't you he said no
[1:45:02] i said brother ramsey you don't mean
[1:45:04] that he said yes
[1:45:06] i said don't you love him he said it he
[1:45:08] said if i loved him i'd serve him
[1:45:10] wouldn't i
[1:45:12] billy walked away i thought say brother
[1:45:15] ramsey said i don't i don't i don't want
[1:45:17] to talk no more about it
[1:45:19] see this was his warning i don't want to
[1:45:21] talk to him about it says i went home
[1:45:23] went in the room shut the door oh you
[1:45:25] know how you feel real heavy like you
[1:45:27] taking the cookies hey man away from a
[1:45:29] baby or something you know i thought
[1:45:31] what
[1:45:32] it can't be surely something has
[1:45:34] happened to brother ramsey yes brother
[1:45:36] ramsay got hurt
[1:45:39] something happened to him look at it
[1:45:42] so there's a little colored boy named
[1:45:43] jimmy they come here to the church got
[1:45:45] one leg you know he limps kind of i
[1:45:48] forget i forget his name works down
[1:45:50] there vorgens runs a a record he met me
[1:45:52] and he said you know rembrandt
[1:45:54] said i don't know about this here dr
[1:45:55] ramsey around here he said i told him
[1:45:57] the other day i said we all were scared
[1:45:59] to even open our mouth around here said
[1:46:02] you was a godly man but said he took his
[1:46:06] preacher's license and went over to the
[1:46:07] basket and tore them apart and throw
[1:46:09] them in the basket said i don't i don't
[1:46:11] i don't want nothing to do with it no
[1:46:13] more
[1:46:14] he said he said hey mister said you
[1:46:16] ought to do that
[1:46:17] he said oh jim i'm through serving the
[1:46:20] lord this man is so hurt look at what
[1:46:22] he's doing throwing his preacher's
[1:46:24] license away hurt oh how many preachers
[1:46:27] out there on the side of the road right
[1:46:28] now could be used by god but been hurt
[1:46:32] god got to bring healing to him
[1:46:37] some threw some of those so he went on
[1:46:38] and says you don't mean that i said
[1:46:40] then he told me he's coming down the
[1:46:42] ground valves on labor day
[1:46:44] i believe what he said now i want you to
[1:46:46] come help me jim he said i'll i'll help
[1:46:48] you after i come
[1:46:52] from church well first i was going to
[1:46:55] church said said he went back down and
[1:46:57] brother ramsey was grinding the valves
[1:46:59] on his car he said jimmy slip over the
[1:47:01] river the saloon's just closed here slip
[1:47:03] over and get me a case of beer he said
[1:47:05] mr ramsey
[1:47:07] i have been guilty of many things
[1:47:10] but never will i be guilty of giving a
[1:47:12] servant of the lord a case of beer now
[1:47:14] this man is backsliding a preacher
[1:47:16] that's backslidden but yet this brother
[1:47:19] still sees him as a christian oh god
[1:47:22] just a hurt christian
[1:47:25] sometimes you got to look at people in
[1:47:26] their in their despair and and where
[1:47:29] they are you got to see it you see
[1:47:30] beyond that circumstance there is hurt
[1:47:33] there and until god can minister to that
[1:47:35] hurt
[1:47:36] they'll never go free
[1:47:39] look at what they say here
[1:47:43] never will i be guilty of getting a
[1:47:44] servant of the lord a case of beer he
[1:47:45] said no sir i'll never do that he said
[1:47:48] well go on get it jim he said mr ramsay
[1:47:51] i grind your vows but if you get any
[1:47:53] beer you got to get it yourself
[1:47:55] he said i ain't going to never get a
[1:47:58] servant of the lord anything like that
[1:48:00] if that is not a warning to this man and
[1:48:02] that's something right you think you
[1:48:04] don't you think you don't backslid on
[1:48:05] god no no no no look when god is married
[1:48:08] to you he's married to you
[1:48:10] ain't nothing you can do to get out of
[1:48:11] the relationship
[1:48:14] i love that
[1:48:17] it says uh
[1:48:19] i grind your ass but if you get any beer
[1:48:21] you go get it yourself he said i ain't
[1:48:23] going to never get a servant or anything
[1:48:25] like that so ramsay jumped in jimmy's
[1:48:27] car took over over the river come back
[1:48:29] half tea'd up with a case of beer
[1:48:31] drinking it he started going down and
[1:48:34] got sick see god couldn't speak to him i
[1:48:36] warned him i've done everything i could
[1:48:38] brother smith went to him and warned him
[1:48:40] everybody tried to do everything they
[1:48:42] could for him still he just shook his
[1:48:44] head what happened he took sick and died
[1:48:47] that showed he was a saved man
[1:48:50] now this is just something that blows my
[1:48:52] mind when when brother branham says it
[1:48:54] shows that he was a saved man he says if
[1:48:56] god could not
[1:49:15] solutions and things like that that he
[1:49:17] stopped serving the lord and god had to
[1:49:19] call home this man was a minister this
[1:49:21] man was a preacher this man was a leader
[1:49:24] but leaders can be
[1:49:27] hurt
[1:49:29] an unfortunate thing when a leader is
[1:49:30] hurt it's everybody around them that
[1:49:33] also gets
[1:49:35] hurt
[1:49:36] god hurt people
[1:49:38] hurt people
[1:49:39] i know sometimes you preach things like
[1:49:41] this but it's you know it get right to
[1:49:43] the core of some some some areas but you
[1:49:45] know we got to get there uh i believe i
[1:49:47] believe uh
[1:49:48] uh uh uh uh john the baptist said we
[1:49:50] gotta lay the ax
[1:49:52] at the root of the tree
[1:49:55] church hurt people hurt people
[1:49:57] and we need god we need god to bring
[1:49:59] healing
[1:50:00] to our heart let me uh just go on a
[1:50:02] little further i want to show you
[1:50:03] something i
[1:50:04] um
[1:50:05] actually you know let me keep reading
[1:50:07] this
[1:50:07] in this quote i want to i want to show
[1:50:09] you something about this man even though
[1:50:10] he went through all of this i thank god
[1:50:12] he was not lost in the midst of all this
[1:50:14] hurt and and some i got i got people
[1:50:16] that's listen right now you might think
[1:50:18] you lost but you're not lost you're
[1:50:20] right where god wants you to be
[1:50:21] in the middle of all that hurt
[1:50:26] he took sick and died that showed he was
[1:50:27] the same man if god could not make him
[1:50:29] bring him in obedience he will have to
[1:50:31] take him off of the earth and bring him
[1:50:32] home that's exactly what the bible said
[1:50:34] that's what the bible promises if you
[1:50:35] won't stand correction you've got to
[1:50:36] come on home so god cannot lose you
[1:50:40] after he saved you
[1:50:43] but he can shorten your days
[1:50:46] here and and make you pay for every sin
[1:50:48] you've done so if you sin you're going
[1:50:50] to have to pay for what you've done just
[1:50:52] remember that and he goes and says now
[1:50:54] the lord be with you i believe tonight
[1:50:55] that brother brother ramsey was saved
[1:51:00] half teed up
[1:51:03] sick
[1:51:04] saying that he don't want to serve god
[1:51:06] no more but brother adam said he was
[1:51:08] saved
[1:51:09] i believe i believe that brother bran he
[1:51:11] said brother andrew was saved absolutely
[1:51:13] i believe it but he just wouldn't obey
[1:51:16] god and when he wasn't when he was when
[1:51:18] he wouldn't uh obey god
[1:51:20] god had to bring him home that's the
[1:51:22] only thing to do because what was it he
[1:51:25] would bring reproach and disgrace to the
[1:51:27] blood wherewith he was sanctified with
[1:51:29] that's right and count the covenant and
[1:51:31] unholy thing if that isn't just exactly
[1:51:34] what this hebrew letter said see it
[1:51:36] would be impossible for him to be lost
[1:51:38] but he would bring shame and disgrace so
[1:51:40] so god would have to take him off the
[1:51:42] earth and bring him home that's exactly
[1:51:44] what had taken place now may the lord
[1:51:46] bless while we bow our heads just a
[1:51:48] moment for prayer i i'm i when i read
[1:51:50] this quote it just blessed me i know
[1:51:52] many things
[1:51:55] that have gone on the glory
[1:51:57] and before they left it it was so hurt
[1:52:01] one serving god but i remember just
[1:52:03] precious moments that we would have
[1:52:05] together and and i mean you could just
[1:52:07] see the joy of the lord all over them
[1:52:08] but some kind of way somewhere down the
[1:52:10] line they got so hurt
[1:52:12] that they could not come back into the
[1:52:14] house of god anymore
[1:52:16] church i tell you this
[1:52:18] i hope that we'll create an environment
[1:52:20] here where hurt people can can come and
[1:52:21] be healed
[1:52:25] because everybody's been hurt by
[1:52:26] something
[1:52:27] it's not a it's not a one of us in here
[1:52:29] that don't experience some type of hurt
[1:52:34] i i i've said this before
[1:52:37] anybody looking for the perfect church
[1:52:39] will never find it
[1:52:41] first thing is is you have to look at
[1:52:43] yourself in the mirror and say look i'm
[1:52:44] not perfect
[1:52:46] and i i realize i can look myself in the
[1:52:48] mirror and say this i know i'm not
[1:52:49] perfect as soon as i show up to the
[1:52:50] church
[1:52:52] the church ain't perfect no more
[1:52:53] because i just showed up and you got to
[1:52:56] look in the mirror and say the same
[1:52:57] thing the church is not if we're looking
[1:52:59] for the perfect church we won't find
[1:53:00] that but we can find a church where
[1:53:03] healing
[1:53:04] can happen
[1:53:07] i want to read a man just a little bit
[1:53:09] more here i want to go into um
[1:53:12] another scripture here
[1:53:14] david
[1:53:16] running from
[1:53:17] saul
[1:53:20] the saul was hurt
[1:53:21] saul was trying to trying to kill david
[1:53:24] disappointed that just like just like um
[1:53:28] um uh uh in the beginning uh
[1:53:31] cain is disappointed god won't take his
[1:53:33] sacrifice
[1:53:34] we find we find the same thing with saul
[1:53:36] being rejected he he's just disa he's
[1:53:38] just absolutely he's caused
[1:53:41] created habit for everybody
[1:53:44] and and and and i want to just pick up a
[1:53:46] scripture out of first first samuel 22.
[1:53:48] i want to just read this just the first
[1:53:49] couple verses i want her how i heard
[1:53:52] leader oh god
[1:53:55] can damage the people
[1:53:57] this is what happened with um
[1:54:00] with with underneath saul's reign saul
[1:54:02] was a hurt man he had been rejected by
[1:54:05] god because he would not obey god and
[1:54:08] look at what he did to the people look
[1:54:09] at what happens here amen in first
[1:54:11] samuel um
[1:54:13] uh
[1:54:14] said first 22
[1:54:17] verse 1
[1:54:18] amen and first 22
[1:54:21] david therefore
[1:54:23] departed thence
[1:54:25] and escaped to the cave atlanta
[1:54:28] and when his brethren
[1:54:30] and all his father's house heard it
[1:54:33] they went down did it to him now now uh
[1:54:35] this this was the time david was
[1:54:37] actually running from saul he tried to
[1:54:39] kill him he said look he's going to be
[1:54:41] laying down sleeping in the bed i want i
[1:54:42] want my servants to go and kill this guy
[1:54:44] david and his wife had to let them down
[1:54:46] out the window and put a rock in the bed
[1:54:48] and make it make them think it was david
[1:54:51] he said i don't care if he's sleeping
[1:54:52] good kill him anyway hurt people want to
[1:54:54] hurt people
[1:54:57] well this is the environment that he
[1:54:58] created in his kingdom
[1:55:00] so now david's on the run and now he's
[1:55:02] hit hiding in a cave but look at this
[1:55:04] verse 2 says this
[1:55:06] amen
[1:55:07] verse it says that they went down did
[1:55:08] the uh to him and everyone that was in
[1:55:11] distress
[1:55:14] and everyone that was
[1:55:16] in debt
[1:55:18] and everyone that was discontented
[1:55:22] gathered themselves unto him amen and he
[1:55:25] became a captain over them and there
[1:55:27] were with him about 400 men now what
[1:55:30] happens is that underneath saul's
[1:55:32] leadership amen because saul is hurt it
[1:55:35] impacts these people in so many ways
[1:55:38] they're hurt in their finances
[1:55:40] oh y'all ain't reading it with me
[1:55:43] amen they're hurting their spirits amen
[1:55:46] they're discontented they're in distress
[1:55:48] these people are hurting so many ways
[1:55:49] because hurt people hurt people now
[1:55:51] they're trying to get with david
[1:55:54] we need we need a different leadership
[1:55:57] we can't take what has just happened
[1:55:59] here
[1:56:00] oh my with what just happened here with
[1:56:02] saul we just can't take this and we
[1:56:04] realize even god himself has rejected
[1:56:06] saul
[1:56:07] hurt people hurt people i want i want to
[1:56:09] go further
[1:56:11] because even though these people coming
[1:56:12] to david in this condition i need you to
[1:56:15] understand these people that came to
[1:56:17] david
[1:56:20] will hurt people
[1:56:25] and there's a cycle
[1:56:27] that happens and it continues to happen
[1:56:30] hurt people
[1:56:32] will keep hurting
[1:56:34] people
[1:56:35] until god does something on the inside
[1:56:37] to take care of that hurt
[1:56:40] we pick him up the same group of people
[1:56:42] as with david over here in
[1:56:44] 1st samuel
[1:56:46] 30.
[1:56:49] i want to read a man
[1:56:54] i want to read uh i want to skip ahead
[1:56:57] in this and then i want to come back i
[1:56:59] want to skip ahead to something just to
[1:57:00] show you first samuel 30.
[1:57:04] let's start at verse
[1:57:08] 21.
[1:57:11] i'm sorry let's go verse 18. let's pick
[1:57:13] this up
[1:57:15] it says in david we caught recovered all
[1:57:17] that the amalekites that carried away
[1:57:19] and david rescued his two wives
[1:57:22] there was nothing lacking to them
[1:57:24] neither small nor great
[1:57:27] neither sons nor daughters neither
[1:57:28] spoiled nor anything that they had taken
[1:57:31] to them david recovered all
[1:57:34] i love it
[1:57:35] let's keep reading he says um
[1:57:37] and david took all the flocks and the
[1:57:38] herb herds which they drained before
[1:57:41] those other cattle and said this is
[1:57:43] david spoil
[1:57:45] and david came to the 200 men which were
[1:57:47] so faint that they could not follow
[1:57:49] david
[1:57:51] whom they had made to al also to abide
[1:57:53] at the brook bazaar
[1:57:55] and they went forth to meet david and to
[1:57:57] meet the people they were that that were
[1:57:59] with him and when david came near to the
[1:58:01] people he saluted them look at this
[1:58:04] then answer all the
[1:58:06] wicked men see he's the man that was you
[1:58:09] know distressed
[1:58:11] these are some of the men that were in
[1:58:13] debt these are ones that want to follow
[1:58:15] david because you know they were
[1:58:16] underneath saul's leadership and and
[1:58:18] saul just drove them crazy
[1:58:21] now now now now here they they were
[1:58:23] david they're all they're happy they
[1:58:24] just won the battle got all the spoil
[1:58:26] but before the battle started there were
[1:58:28] 200 men that were not able to go in
[1:58:30] battle because they were just too weak
[1:58:32] hallelujah amen but these other men that
[1:58:34] went into the battle and got all this
[1:58:36] spoil you know they turn around and look
[1:58:37] at what look at how they treating their
[1:58:39] brothers
[1:58:41] hurt people oh jesus
[1:58:44] will hurt people
[1:58:46] i need you to understand this good god
[1:58:48] almighty as the lord is developing and
[1:58:50] growing this church we can't be a group
[1:58:52] of hurt people
[1:58:53] we we can't be a group of victims
[1:58:56] we got to be victors
[1:58:59] we don't know who god gonna sit here we
[1:59:00] got to be able to help people through
[1:59:02] they hurt
[1:59:04] look at this in verse 20 verse verse 22
[1:59:07] so then answer all the wicked men and
[1:59:09] men and below of those that went with
[1:59:10] david and said because they went not
[1:59:12] with us
[1:59:15] we will not give them all of the spoil
[1:59:17] that that we have recovered save to
[1:59:19] every man his wife and his children and
[1:59:21] that they may lead them away and depart
[1:59:24] you can take your wife that we got back
[1:59:26] you can take your children but you ain't
[1:59:28] taking none of this for y'all just leave
[1:59:30] these people are willing to split the
[1:59:32] church
[1:59:34] oh god
[1:59:37] they they they happy with splitting the
[1:59:38] church because y'all didn't want to
[1:59:40] fight with us but i'm going to tell you
[1:59:42] something good god almighty
[1:59:45] if there was anybody that should have
[1:59:47] been hurt david should have been hurt
[1:59:48] because he was running from saul like
[1:59:50] crazy
[1:59:51] and and i need you to understand god had
[1:59:53] done something in david to make him a
[1:59:55] different leader than saul was
[2:00:00] look at david's response
[2:00:04] then said david
[2:00:07] ye shall not do so my brethren
[2:00:12] with that which the lord hath given us
[2:00:14] you didn't do this on your own
[2:00:16] god the one did this for you and you're
[2:00:19] not gonna take it and be stingy with it
[2:00:23] oh help me lord jesus says he says uh
[2:00:27] uh uh uh
[2:00:28] that that which the lord has given us
[2:00:30] who hath preserved us and delivered the
[2:00:32] company that came against us uh into our
[2:00:35] hand for who will hearken unto you in
[2:00:38] this matter but as his part is that
[2:00:41] goeth down to the battle so shall his
[2:00:43] part be that terrorist by the stuff they
[2:00:46] shall part a like david's saying we're
[2:00:49] gonna put no difference in anybody you
[2:00:52] ain't gonna be looking at this brother
[2:00:53] funny you ain't gonna be looking at this
[2:00:55] sister funding we're gonna all embrace
[2:00:58] what god has done for us
[2:01:00] and we're gonna celebrate together
[2:01:04] i know you've been hurt my brother i
[2:01:06] know you're disappointed that you know
[2:01:07] they didn't go down with you
[2:01:09] but it's okay god god did that for a
[2:01:12] reason now don't take that out on your
[2:01:14] brothers because they didn't do it
[2:01:16] let's realize god is the one that
[2:01:18] blessed us with all this so now we're
[2:01:19] gonna share because god did this not not
[2:01:22] you you didn't do this in your own
[2:01:23] strength god did this david had a heart
[2:01:26] to bring the people together
[2:01:28] and i believe that's what the holy
[2:01:29] spirit is doing through the leadership
[2:01:31] even through this message it's a heart
[2:01:32] to bring people together
[2:01:35] a heart to divide
[2:01:39] oh the reason i'm doing it because so
[2:01:40] and so did no no no no no
[2:01:43] yep yesterday we we heard
[2:01:45] you know uh brother bear was just taking
[2:01:48] us through scriptures and you know it's
[2:01:50] saying how um
[2:01:51] and i can't remember all the scriptures
[2:01:53] but one of them was that uh you know you
[2:01:55] said my enemy did this my name is but
[2:01:57] jesus said love your enemies
[2:01:59] so you don't have no justification to do
[2:02:01] nothing against your enemies love your
[2:02:03] enemies well you know my neighbor did
[2:02:05] this my neighbor did that love your
[2:02:06] neighbor as yourself
[2:02:09] there is no way out we have to follow
[2:02:11] the word of god
[2:02:13] yes i have been hurt yes you been hurt
[2:02:16] yes we all been hurt but it's how we
[2:02:18] react
[2:02:20] and how we respond to the hurt is what
[2:02:22] matters most
[2:02:23] can i just go back to david in this same
[2:02:26] scripture
[2:02:27] because david shows a different
[2:02:29] character than the rest of them
[2:02:31] we're not even listening to you and you
[2:02:33] trying to divide the church here we're
[2:02:35] not listening to that who gonna listen
[2:02:37] to you
[2:02:38] this is the direction that we going how
[2:02:40] did david
[2:02:41] how did david become like
[2:02:44] this look at in verse 1.
[2:02:50] same chapter
[2:02:54] and it came to pass when david and his
[2:02:55] men would come to ziklag on the third
[2:02:57] day
[2:02:59] the amalekites had invaded south and
[2:03:01] ziglag and schmidt and ziklag and burned
[2:03:03] it with fire i need you to understand
[2:03:04] what had happened here is david was so
[2:03:06] hurt uh running from saul because saul
[2:03:08] was so hurt that dave was going to be
[2:03:10] king
[2:03:11] uh he got he got jealous about them
[2:03:12] singing the songs about david and
[2:03:14] everything like that he was so hurt he
[2:03:16] drove david out david ended up taking
[2:03:18] his men and joining the philistine army
[2:03:20] joining the enemy's army
[2:03:22] the same enemy that he was raised up to
[2:03:25] slay now he's on their side but as he's
[2:03:27] going after battle that day the
[2:03:29] philosopher said we're going to invade
[2:03:30] israel and they saw israelites come and
[2:03:32] say no we don't want them because
[2:03:34] they're going to turn into battle and
[2:03:35] come against us he says no no no send
[2:03:37] them back home
[2:03:38] well david and his men go back home when
[2:03:40] they get there
[2:03:41] everything that they had had been raided
[2:03:44] watch it
[2:03:45] it came to pass
[2:03:47] when david and his men were come to
[2:03:50] ziklag on the third day
[2:03:52] the malachites had invaded the south and
[2:03:54] ziklat and smitten ziklag and burned it
[2:03:57] with fire and had taken the women
[2:03:59] captive
[2:04:00] that were that were therein they slew
[2:04:02] not any either great or small but
[2:04:04] carried them away and went on their way
[2:04:07] so david and his men came to the city
[2:04:09] and behold it was burned with fire
[2:04:12] and their wives and their sons and their
[2:04:15] daughters were taken
[2:04:16] captives
[2:04:18] then david said and then david and the
[2:04:20] people that were with with him
[2:04:22] lifted up their voice and wept until
[2:04:24] they had no more power to weep they just
[2:04:26] crying up something look at it now
[2:04:28] and david's two eyes were taking
[2:04:30] captives ahead of him
[2:04:32] and just just uh the jezreelitis and
[2:04:34] abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite
[2:04:37] and david was so greatly distressed
[2:04:41] for the people spake
[2:04:43] of stoning him i want you to catch that
[2:04:45] these guys
[2:04:47] are hurt
[2:04:48] david we're following you
[2:04:50] we left saul but now you don't let us
[2:04:52] into something greater david something
[2:04:54] worse than what saul did our children
[2:04:57] are going our wives are gone our
[2:04:59] families are gone everything we have is
[2:05:00] gone it's all burned up and you let us
[2:05:02] out here to this david
[2:05:04] these guys say you know what now david
[2:05:06] we tired of you we're going to stone you
[2:05:08] can you imagine sitting there with all
[2:05:09] these guys
[2:05:12] look at what happened here let's look at
[2:05:13] it in verse six and david was greatly
[2:05:15] distressed for the people spaking stolen
[2:05:17] him
[2:05:19] because the soul of all the people was
[2:05:20] grieved
[2:05:22] every man for his son and for his
[2:05:23] daughters but david oh god
[2:05:26] that's the thing that got me right there
[2:05:30] when everybody else done turned against
[2:05:32] you and i mean david just hurt david
[2:05:34] hurt by saul now they're hurt by the man
[2:05:36] that's that's fallen but look at what
[2:05:37] the bible say about david
[2:05:40] you're gonna have to have a go ahead
[2:05:44] you're gonna have to have it on the
[2:05:45] inside
[2:05:46] something that tell you keep pressing on
[2:05:49] like mama's singing a song i'm still
[2:05:51] still pressing my battle
[2:05:52] right you're gonna have to have this
[2:05:54] could the bible say but david did what
[2:05:57] encouraged himself and the lord his god
[2:06:02] i i need you to understand sometimes
[2:06:04] people won't be there to pat you on the
[2:06:06] back
[2:06:08] sometimes people might not be there to
[2:06:10] tell you it's gonna be all right
[2:06:12] but you're gonna have to have a
[2:06:13] relationship with god where you can
[2:06:16] encourage yourself
[2:06:19] god i see what you promised me here and
[2:06:22] god i see what you promised me there i
[2:06:24] know that you won't fail me you brought
[2:06:26] me this far you didn't bring me this
[2:06:27] father leave me i know you won't fail
[2:06:29] you're gonna have to be able to
[2:06:31] encourage yourself
[2:06:34] can't sit around talk about the pastor
[2:06:36] didn't call me
[2:06:38] this person didn't call me
[2:06:40] that i mean when i when i look at david
[2:06:42] when i look at david i just i begin to
[2:06:44] ask myself a question who who was it who
[2:06:47] was it that david went to council
[2:06:49] council with
[2:06:50] who who was it that he went and talked
[2:06:52] to he was there by himself amen
[2:06:55] everybody else was was thinking about
[2:06:57] stoning him but david had enough on the
[2:06:59] inside i know you got some inside hurt
[2:07:04] but do you also have something on the
[2:07:05] inside that inside go ahead that tell
[2:07:07] you know i can get over this
[2:07:10] i can get through this
[2:07:12] not not not not you know some
[2:07:15] uh uh uh what that little train they
[2:07:17] used to teach us about in school
[2:07:20] hey

[2:07:25] engine
[2:07:26] and and all the train kept saying as i
[2:07:28] think i can
[2:07:30] just taking another turn i think i can
[2:07:32] you know why and you got to notice that
[2:07:34] if you think you can
[2:07:36] then you will
[2:07:38] you can't be you can't be i think i
[2:07:40] can't can you be going in reverse i

[2:07:55] direction
[2:07:58] and that train made it up the hill and
[2:08:00] as
[2:08:01] it was going down i did i did i did i i
[2:08:04] did i did
[2:08:07] and the next hill you come to you
[2:08:09] approach it with the same approach
[2:08:12] god will bring you through
[2:08:14] you got to have something on the inside
[2:08:18] it's got to be there
[2:08:20] a real experience with god
[2:08:24] that no matter what you ain't taking
[2:08:25] this from me you might take this you
[2:08:26] might take that but you ain't taking
[2:08:28] that experience from it
[2:08:32] i gotta go ahead on the inside
[2:08:34] yeah i'm hurt yeah i'm going through
[2:08:36] yeah yep yep yep yep i still got to go
[2:08:38] ahead

[2:08:56] may take this don't let them take your
[2:08:58] praise
[2:09:00] don't let them take your praise
[2:09:02] david encouraged himself
[2:09:06] in the lord and this is why david later
[2:09:08] on that encouragement even later on
[2:09:10] carried on when they finally got they
[2:09:13] recovered all everything a good thing
[2:09:15] about you might see your stuff burned up
[2:09:18] but ain't nobody's around
[2:09:23] i mean they ain't been killed

[2:09:32] and if you just go and read the story
[2:09:34] you see how god did it
[2:09:36] there was one man a part of the invading
[2:09:38] army he got sick
[2:09:40] he thought he got sick by accident but
[2:09:42] they said we can't carry him alone we
[2:09:44] got to just leave him behind and as this
[2:09:46] man got left behind here come david and
[2:09:48] his man they see him
[2:09:50] and and and they they just began to
[2:09:52] restore him the strength and and got him
[2:09:54] now he realized he was outnumbered so he
[2:09:56] began to start talking we uh we invaded
[2:09:59] this place called ziggler oh is that
[2:10:01] right
[2:10:02] keep on talking and as the man kept
[2:10:04] talking they got all the information
[2:10:06] from the informant they say now all we
[2:10:08] need you to do is show us
[2:10:10] say show us where these men are
[2:10:13] stationed he said now if i show you do

[2:10:22] this man led them right down to the army
[2:10:24] look that man was a hurt person
[2:10:30] that man was a hurt person
[2:10:32] he was hurt physically
[2:10:38] but as he began to reveal all the
[2:10:40] secrets
[2:10:41] david and his men come down there to the
[2:10:43] camp
[2:10:44] and they raided and got everything back

[2:11:48] i'ma
[2:11:49] get back to
[2:11:50] this but since we're in samuel let's go
[2:11:53] to
[2:11:54] second samuel
[2:11:57] 16.
[2:12:00] second samuel 16.
[2:12:06] you can see hurt people all through the
[2:12:07] scripture
[2:12:11] and sometimes people go through
[2:12:12] years and years and years of that hurt
[2:12:14] being on the inside and they never
[2:12:16] really deal with it
[2:12:18] they never really deal with it
[2:12:20] i read a scripture on last week of how
[2:12:23] um
[2:12:24] let me just read it to you uh
[2:12:26] where jesus said it's impossible that
[2:12:28] offenses will come
[2:12:30] but one to him through whom they come
[2:12:33] it would better for him that a millstone
[2:12:34] were hanging about his neck and he cast
[2:12:36] him to see then that he should offend
[2:12:38] one of these little ones take heed he
[2:12:40] says if thy brother trespass against
[2:12:42] thee if your brother hurt you
[2:12:45] your sister hurt you the bible actually
[2:12:47] say rebuke him
[2:12:49] but not in the way you think
[2:12:52] not you just getting
[2:12:53] giving them a piece of your mind
[2:12:59] the bible say rebuke him and if he
[2:13:00] repent forgive him and what what that
[2:13:02] rebuke him mean is just
[2:13:04] talk straight with him
[2:13:06] in love just like you know this is what
[2:13:08] offended me
[2:13:09] don't be bouncing all around and going
[2:13:11] all around no tell him this is what
[2:13:13] offended me
[2:13:14] this is what did it
[2:13:16] talk to him
[2:13:17] and here's what the bible say here's
[2:13:19] what the bible said it says um if thy
[2:13:21] brother trespass against you rebuke him
[2:13:23] and if he repent then forgive him
[2:13:26] that means you got to let it go right
[2:13:27] then you can't now we don't talked about
[2:13:29] this i i told you i was sorry you said
[2:13:32] you forgave me and then ten years from
[2:13:34] now you're gonna bring the same thing
[2:13:36] back up again
[2:13:38] no you choose to be hurt
[2:13:42] you're choosing to be hurt
[2:13:45] and i'm going to tell you another thing
[2:13:46] some people just want attention
[2:13:50] it's a truth in their heart they want
[2:13:51] attention so they love to hold things
[2:13:52] over you yeah we already talked about
[2:13:55] that then they come up with something
[2:13:57] else no come on now this is a devil
[2:14:01] you know i ain't tried to do none of
[2:14:03] this stuff
[2:14:04] that's a devil trying to bring division
[2:14:10] let's go over here
[2:14:12] this scripture
[2:14:15] lord jesus
[2:14:18] um
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:22] what that second samuel is what i just
[2:14:24] called out right yes uh ii samuel
[2:14:27] 16.
[2:14:30] um this is a man that
[2:14:32] we're gonna see that he had some stuff
[2:14:34] on the inside of him
[2:14:36] and he was just waiting for a certain
[2:14:38] moment
[2:14:40] to release it
[2:14:42] he's a hurt man
[2:14:43] he's a hurt man
[2:14:45] and he was just waiting for a moment
[2:14:48] and he thought he had his moment
[2:14:50] and boy he let it all fly
[2:14:55] but the problem is he didn't realize
[2:14:57] that this was only a moment
[2:14:59] things was getting ready to reverse
[2:15:04] see this is why you got to watch how you
[2:15:05] act
[2:15:07] in your moments
[2:15:09] oh y'all ain't with me today
[2:15:12] you gotta watch how you respond and how
[2:15:14] you do things in your moment that you
[2:15:16] think is your moment all it is is a
[2:15:18] moment
[2:15:19] because when things change
[2:15:22] now this man had a target on his back
[2:15:25] let's read this story
[2:15:30] here in
[2:15:31] verse 5
[2:15:34] uh
[2:15:38] second samuel 16
[2:15:40] verse 5 says
[2:15:41] and when king david came to baharim
[2:15:44] behold thence came out a man of the
[2:15:46] family of the house of saul remember now
[2:15:49] saul was replaced by david as king
[2:15:53] saul was rejected by god now saul is
[2:15:55] being replaced by david as king and it's
[2:15:57] not david's doing this is god's doing
[2:16:01] this is god's doing uh the way the way
[2:16:03] that god handled this god god did this
[2:16:05] right so so we we pick up here where
[2:16:08] we're where david is now king but you
[2:16:10] know because what happened in david's
[2:16:12] household
[2:16:13] uh david's son has risen up and taken
[2:16:16] over the kingdom from and through david
[2:16:18] off the throne and now he's taking over
[2:16:20] the kingdom and now david is on the run
[2:16:23] watch it
[2:16:28] it says and when when king david
[2:16:30] came to bahrain behold thence came out a
[2:16:33] man of the family of the house of saul
[2:16:35] whose name was shimaya the son of gira
[2:16:37] he came forth and cursed
[2:16:40] still as it came
[2:16:45] and he cast stones at david
[2:16:48] that'll be one thing
[2:16:50] and then all the servants of king david
[2:16:52] so this man picking up every rock that
[2:16:54] he can find
[2:16:56] oh y'all y'all let me i'm i'ma break it
[2:16:58] down for you so you understand what's
[2:17:01] really going on
[2:17:03] sometimes just because you are
[2:17:05] associated
[2:17:07] with spirit and truth tabernacle
[2:17:10] people will throw rocks at you and the
[2:17:14] people that's throwing rocks are
[2:17:20] this is how you know they hurt by their
[2:17:23] actions
[2:17:24] these are hurt people and sometimes it's
[2:17:26] not i mean and sometimes you get them to
[2:17:28] talk to try to find out what the hurt
[2:17:30] really all about they ain't got nothing
[2:17:32] to base it on
[2:17:34] it's just a devil
[2:17:36] it's just a devil
[2:17:38] look at this look at it
[2:17:40] it says
[2:17:41] he cast stones that david and all the
[2:17:42] servants of king david and all the
[2:17:44] people and all the mighty men were on
[2:17:46] his on his right hand and on his left
[2:17:49] and thus said shem yah when he cursed
[2:17:52] come out
[2:17:53] come out thy bloody man and thou man of
[2:17:56] allow he calling david pretty much a
[2:17:58] devil
[2:18:00] god the one gave david the kingdom
[2:18:02] he's the devil now man of belial the
[2:18:05] lord look at he's not gonna use
[2:18:07] scripture on them though as soon as oh
[2:18:09] my i wonder how many folks are
[2:18:11] criticizing us now because we in the
[2:18:13] school
[2:18:16] i i wonder how many got something to say
[2:18:18] now because we're in the school it's
[2:18:20] just a moment
[2:18:26] the lord hath returned upon thee all the
[2:18:29] blood of the house of saul and whose
[2:18:31] dead thou has reigned see you shouldn't
[2:18:33] even
[2:18:34] been king saul should have still been
[2:18:36] king this man was a relative of saul
[2:18:38] taking up a saul
[2:18:40] saul was rejected because he failed to
[2:18:42] obey the word of god they had nothing to
[2:18:45] do with david
[2:18:47] it it's better to obey than the
[2:18:48] sacrifice saul
[2:18:50] look at it verse 8 again
[2:18:53] the lord have returned upon thee all the
[2:18:55] blood of the house of saul and who
[2:18:57] stayed thou has reign and the lord have
[2:18:59] delivered the kingdom into the hand of
[2:19:01] absalom my son and behold thou art taken
[2:19:03] in thy mystery because thou art a bloody
[2:19:06] man
[2:19:07] now he's right david was considered a
[2:19:09] bloody man this is why he couldn't build
[2:19:11] a temple he's right about that some
[2:19:12] things he's right about but this ain't
[2:19:14] why i'm being cast off the throne
[2:19:17] this ain't why
[2:19:20] verse 9 says then said abishai
[2:19:23] the son of zarai unto the king
[2:19:27] why
[2:19:28] should this dead dog curse my lord the
[2:19:31] king let me go over i pray thee and take
[2:19:35] off his head
[2:19:36] and just it's just you know it's
[2:19:38] something that you know
[2:19:40] the the insults were not coming
[2:19:42] to this guy
[2:19:44] um
[2:19:45] abishai that's not what the insults are
[2:19:48] hurl the insults are going towards david
[2:19:51] but abhishek is offended at the insults
[2:19:54] and he wants to go and take care of it
[2:19:55] david he won't he won't say another word
[2:19:57] if you just give me permission
[2:20:00] i love the way that they do this i love
[2:20:02] that
[2:20:03] you know sometimes they would be
[2:20:04] respectful and just watch how the
[2:20:06] leadership come handle it
[2:20:09] rather than just try to take care of it
[2:20:10] on your own
[2:20:12] amen sometime you have to watch how the
[2:20:14] leadership is going to handle it rather
[2:20:17] than take care of it on your own
[2:20:20] look at this
[2:20:22] i'm almost there
[2:20:23] oh my verse verse
[2:20:26] verse 10
[2:20:28] and the king said what have i to do with
[2:20:31] you
[2:20:32] ye sons of zariah
[2:20:35] so let him curse
[2:20:37] because the lord hath said unto him
[2:20:40] curse
[2:20:41] david
[2:20:43] god gave this man permission
[2:20:46] just like god gave the devil permission
[2:20:49] to attack job god has given this man
[2:20:52] permission to curse david can i tell you
[2:20:55] another thing god has given some people
[2:20:57] permission
[2:20:58] to hurt you
[2:21:04] how are you going to respond when god
[2:21:06] has given them permission
[2:21:13] how are you going to respond god allowed
[2:21:15] this to happen
[2:21:16] permission has been given look at this
[2:21:19] look at this it says he says and the
[2:21:20] king said what have i to do with you you
[2:21:22] sons of zariah so let him curse because
[2:21:25] the lord hath said unto him curse david
[2:21:28] who shall they who shall they who shall
[2:21:31] then say wherefore hast thou done so and
[2:21:34] david said to have a shy and all and to
[2:21:35] all the servants behold my son which
[2:21:37] came forth of my bible seeketh my life
[2:21:40] how much more
[2:21:42] now may this vengeance might do it
[2:21:44] he said look i'm i'm hurt enough my own
[2:21:47] son rose up against me
[2:21:49] but god protected me from him
[2:21:51] do you think this benjamin gonna be able
[2:21:52] to take me this mad man gonna be able to
[2:21:54] take him brother brandon say he was
[2:21:55] crippled in the spirit
[2:21:57] you think you're gonna be able to take
[2:21:58] me out no i i don't care what people
[2:22:00] have done to you they can't take you out
[2:22:02] there's a boundary there
[2:22:07] he says let him alone
[2:22:11] and let him curse
[2:22:14] for the lord hath bitten him
[2:22:19] i i just love the way david writes it
[2:22:22] may be
[2:22:24] that the lord will look on mine
[2:22:26] affliction
[2:22:28] and that the lord will requite me
[2:22:31] good for his cursing
[2:22:34] this day
[2:22:35] god watching my attitude
[2:22:38] and he might bless me if i have the
[2:22:39] right attitude
[2:22:42] and as david and his men went by the way
[2:22:45] shimmy i
[2:22:46] went along on the hillside over against
[2:22:49] him and cursed as he went and threw
[2:22:51] stones at him and cast dust
[2:22:54] and the king and all the people that
[2:22:56] were with him
[2:22:58] came weary and refreshed themselves
[2:23:00] there i just love this because david had
[2:23:02] the right attitude this man has cursed
[2:23:04] him said just let him curse god allowed
[2:23:05] it god allowed it
[2:23:07] all right don't worry about it yes this
[2:23:09] man has hurt me like he kept calling me
[2:23:11] they say sticks and stones
[2:23:14] i hurt my bones but names may never hurt
[2:23:16] me and some there's a truth and there's
[2:23:18] also not a truth there cause sometimes
[2:23:19] names can't hurt you
[2:23:22] david is being hurt by this man but he
[2:23:24] refuses to
[2:23:26] respond
[2:23:27] in a manner amen that you would expect
[2:23:30] him to respond later on we don't got we
[2:23:33] don't have time to read it but let just
[2:23:34] let me just finish it by telling you
[2:23:36] telling you
[2:23:37] god brought david
[2:23:39] back to the throne
[2:23:41] the same way david went out
[2:23:43] david came back in
[2:23:45] and you know who was there to meet him
[2:23:46] as he was coming back in
[2:23:48] this same guy that was casting rocks and
[2:23:51] throwing rocking oh
[2:23:53] oh the lord has blessed you bring you
[2:23:55] back home now oh glory to god oh please
[2:23:59] i lost my mind when i said them things
[2:24:02] and i'm sorry david please forgive me
[2:24:07] see god know how to make your enemies
[2:24:12] your footstool
[2:24:17] they would say yeah it's all good
[2:24:21] you gotta worry about me i ain't gonna
[2:24:23] take your life not me i ain't gonna do
[2:24:24] nothing
[2:24:27] but then he had a secret meeting
[2:24:29] with one of his sons this son solomon
[2:24:31] solomon you remember that guy shame
[2:24:34] when i'm gone
[2:24:36] when i'm off the scene
[2:24:39] watch him
[2:24:41] watch them solomon
[2:24:44] here david passes away and solomon's on
[2:24:46] the throne and
[2:24:48] chamele comes with solomon saw them say
[2:24:49] look now you know what uh i remember
[2:24:51] what you did my dad and i says but uh
[2:24:53] but here's here's the deal
[2:24:55] you'll have
[2:24:56] um
[2:24:58] you have protection
[2:24:59] as long as you stay here
[2:25:02] don't ever leave here
[2:25:04] you got protection if you stay here
[2:25:08] i'm good with that
[2:25:11] so man i'm good with that but one day
[2:25:13] chamele had two slaves jump up saying
[2:25:15] man we running for our life his property
[2:25:18] took our run and and she may have found
[2:25:20] out where they was i'm going down to get

[2:25:24] slaves brought them back as soon as he
[2:25:26] got him backstage i told you i was going
[2:25:27] to restore my property and after he got
[2:25:29] his property restored had a knock on the
[2:25:31] door king solomon want to see you
[2:25:34] king solomon c uh uh yes sure i'll go
[2:25:37] see king solomon so now she made the the
[2:25:40] agreement was is that as long as you

[2:26:28] because hurt people will continue to
[2:26:31] hurt people
[2:26:32] we want to see that cycle stop
[2:26:34] and let it stop with us

[2:27:21] mind and and follow scripture scriptural
[2:27:24] principles
[2:27:27] that we're not used we wouldn't use our
[2:27:29] hurt as a crutch to justify some of our
