prayers would not be stopped it won't be stopped you know sometimes it just seems like they are delayed uh as it was in the days of daniel he was praying and amen and somehow his prayer got delayed and and the angel came and told him said we heard your prayer as soon as you prayed it not only did they hear the prayer but the answer was on the way but as the answer was on the way somehow the prince of persia got involved in and began to hinder amen this prayer from getting on the answer from getting there to daniel but you know when when michael the great prince stepped in he released gabriel to bring the answer to to david i mean to to daniel he brother anson said what you need to understand is that maybe it was hindered but it couldn't be stopped it might have been delayed but it

the lord just um good to see the saints in the in the in the house of god amen um i see sister liz there and seen her in a little bit but good to have her a man uh with us and amen on the day and as you can see brother aaron was with us again this sunday it's good to have him hey man took us up a nice long vacation and uh hey man i just uh i know that they just been making all these plans so uh we thank god for all things amen praise god um so we have a a couple of birthdays that are gonna be coming up amen this week uh sister questionetta will be celebrating her birthday on thursday the 23rd amen thank the lord for that and man and uh we have two birthdays on the 24th sister erica my wife amen and sister rachel my niece both be celebrating their birthdays on friday the 24th so we thank the lord for giving them all another year amen here uh don't forget this uh week uh sister's virtual prayer it'll be tuesday at 7 30. amen uh i was just mentioning the other night i think it was wednesday night sometimes just getting on the prayer and just listening to other people pray just blesses your heart and just really do something for you and i want to encourage you all i know some people say i just don't like to pray out loud uh i understand i understand that but i'm gonna tell you if it was an emergency i guarantee you and i have no problem lord jesus we always in emergency mode right so but if you don't want to pray just get on and just listen and just just be blessed be a part of the fellowship amen so tuesday night the sisters will be praying amen we want to encourage you to do that wednesday night we'll be back here in service our streaming continues through twitter and facebook and uh as uh as you all see we're in this temporary location our restrooms are here to the left if you have to go out uh those that are closest to this door use this door to go out and knows that's closest to that door use that door but it's over here to my left and uh unfortunately the bathrooms do not lock so knock before you enter please knock before you enter uh until they get that situated they have been trying to work out a few things for us but uh until they get it worked out just always knock before you actually go into the restroom that would be much appreciated amen um so don't forget our sunday morning service prayer time has changed we used to do it at seven a.m now we're doing it at nine a.m uh since we're here and i wanna encourage everyone to come from nine a.m to ten and then the service will start at 10 30. brother diggs will be with us on the uh october 9th and october 10th we'll have a service here 7 p.m on october 9th and then 10 30 in the morning october 10th and be looking forward to having him a man here with us uh during that time and for our giving um i want to just reiterate to those that are in the house of the lord we have our box here but we accept when you come into the service give as you come in rather than when you go out the reason being is that we're on a time constraint and the brothers don't um the brothers actually will be kind of doing the offering at a different time than after service they won't be doing it anymore after service so always try to give as you come in rather than when you go out and and uh and once we you know until we get ourselves just kind of in that if you need one of the brothers just to pick up your offering today to put it in there that's fine because after we pray over to offer the brothers we'll be taking the box in order to uh start you know uh handling the finances there the church so just please if you're in the house lord and you're gonna use the box do that as you're coming into the house of the lord rather than when you're leaving the house of the lord that would be greatly appreciated those that want to give online we still have cash app and we still have um um paypal amen i'm gonna tell y'all uh sister liz is the reason we got cash out and she was like brother jack can we just get cash out for the church i'm like uh paypal been working for a long time paypal was difficult but uh so cash app has been working very well and i thank her for that idea because it's it's been it's been it's been a good tool amen to use and just been a real blessing during this season so um um covet brought some blessings there's a lot of blessings that it brought everything went negative about covet but uh it brought did bring some blessings and we thank god for what he's done in the midst of all of this so let's pray over our uh giving those i forgot to say those that are online if you want to mail uh the offering in the addresses there at the bottom of the screen father we thank you for this opportunity we have to be able to give to you and we ask that you would use it for the furthest of your kingdom god we trust that you would just get glory and honor out of all that we do we thank you for this season that you have brought us to and uh we know in every season there is a reason so help us to be faithful god even during this time help us to be uh lord help us to honor you and all that we do father and i pray that you would bless amen our uh all that we would we would offer in a tithing offering and you promise according to your word that you rebuke to devour for our sake god so let your word be fulfilled in each and every life and god may you just continue to pour out blessings where we have room not enough to receive thank you for the jobs that you've given us thank you for the businesses that you've given us thank you god for the ways that you've made out of no way the doors that you've opened thank you god for all that you have done and all you continue to do you are a great god it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen sister sarah if you would come amen at this time [Music] amen god bless you [Music] you've been so close despite my distance [Music] designs yeah and you're always good you're always present present [Music] when my faith is failing your love will still embrace me i know that i can make it i can make it when my faith is failing your love will still embrace me i know that i can make it i can make it waiting [Applause] okay i'll be okay [Music] even when i wonder your eyes are on me on me yeah yeah and you're never far i wanna feel your heartbeat [Music] heartbeat when my faith is failing your love will still embrace me i know that i can make it i can make it when my face is failing your love will still embrace me i know that i can make it i can make it you push me when i walk through fire even when i face the giants and the darkness with the light tell the devil that he's a liar and even when i'm in my waiting and all my broken places you give me faith where i am faceless and i will not be afraid i'll be okay i'll be okay and i'll be okay and i'll be okay yes you're with me when i walk through fire even when i face the giants and the darkness with the light you tell the devil that he's a liar and even when i'm in my waiting in all of my broken places you give me faith where i am faithless and i will not be afraid i'll be okay i'll be okay and i'll be okay i'll be okay i'll be okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] i appreciate that special sister sarah uh i'll be okay i think that's the testimony of every believer no matter what it is that we're facing i'm gonna be all right i'll be okay amen amen amen yes the confidence that we have is in the word of god it tells us that all things work together for good to them who love god to them who are called according to his purpose and there's nothing that overtakes the believer that god don't already know about it's not a shock it's not a surprise this it's a part of a plan and uh what we learn to do is accept what god allows amen praise the lord um we'll stand we're going to prepare to welcome amen brother quicker to the pulpit i wanted to just mention really quickly uh keep us in prayer next weekend i'll be ministering at a men's meeting there in tennessee uh so just keep us in prayer as we go brother sway and brother marquis will be going along with us and we're looking forward to [Music] just the time of fellowship there at the men's meeting and just actually to pray but i also just want to make mention on fridays fridays at 6 30 we come and we try to get the uh the just everything prepared for sunday morning and for the last couple weeks has been me and brother quinton has come and i appreciate that but next week i won't be here so i'm gonna ask them if i get some brothers that could just uh come and just work with brother quentin on next friday at 6 30 that would be greatly appreciated and um just don't have them trying to do it all by itself so we need some boxes uh to kind of help carry the load amen if you don't mind so keep that in mind and keep us in prayer as we as we go that the lord will just bless us a man abundantly uh there at the meeting it's good to have brother kwaku back he was away for a bit and he had to bury his father there in ghana and uh he was able to do some even some evangelistic work while he was there but the lord brought him back safely here and i said well we want to hear from you brother we've been missing you for a little bit so we want to hear from you in this morning the lord has put something in his heart to share with us so we're a man excited amen to hear what god wants to say to us so let's just sing this song amen thank you for the cross lord thank you for those nail scarred hands the price that was paid and just think about it and like i said i'm very selfish i believe that if he would have went to the cross only for one person and that one person would have been me i think he would have suffered all the pain just for me i love him i praise him i thank him because i know i don't know where i'd be if it had not been for the cross so let's lift our hands let's close our eyes and let's raise our voices to heaven as we sing this song [Music] thank you for the price you paid [Music] bearing all my [Music] oh thank you for this love oh and thank you for the names [Music] embrace worthy is the lamb worth hits the land [Music] seated on the seated on the throne where we ground you now with many crows because you rain victorious [Music] come on [Music] amen glory hallelujah to the lord let's give a clap off and unto our lord glory to the lord jesus christ amen we thank you for this beautiful morning that is given to us we are glad and rejoicing in it amen we are blessed beyond blessing amen you bless more than you can think and you can imagine regardless of your circumstance amen for the lord that thy god knows you by name glory hallelujah glory to the name of the lord let's share with our prayer father we thank you for this blessing that you've given to us we give all the glory and honor to your name we appreciate lord you bringing us together to hear your word to rejoice to praise you father to sing and to make melody unto your name father take prominence lord this morning and speak to our hearts take control by the atmospheres let the holy spirit take control blot out anything that is not of you consume it lord jesus christ cast it to the bottomless pit and let the spirit of the lord your self-lord take control by every heart pour your word and your goodness and your mercy and their freshness from the throne of grace you know what each and everyone is going through this morning let the divine presence of the divine christ minister to every questions and every need father after we're done with the service we will give glory and honor to your name we bless thee bless our dear pastor bless all the body of christ bless the assembling of the saints lord jesus christ and take the glory for your name jesus christ we pray amen god bless you let's give a clap offering unto our lord glory hallelujah to the lord he is merciful amen this morning we want to speak on a text i know you by your name says the lord amen i know you by your name says the lord and this is the third time i'm preaching this uh salmon i preached it back in ghana when i went to ghana and brother gabriel asked me to minister to his people in colombia and i was inspired to preach it and but each time i preached the lord brings bring it something else amen bring new things so we want to look at that topic and we want to read a scripture from jeremiah chapter one verse five maybe we're gonna start from verse four and we read from four let's say jeremiah chapter five sorry jeremiah chapter one verse four let's read up to nine but the key test is verse 5 jeremiah 1 verse 4 to 9 and we pick a test from verse 5 then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctify thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child verse 7 but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shall speak be not afraid of their faces for i am with you to deliver these says the lord then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my my voice in thy mouth amen for jeremiah he was afraid of the people's face but yours might not be people you might be facing a circumstance which could be overwhelming which could kind of sinking you down but the lord said that he know you by your name amen god bless you we may take our seats i know you by your name you want to read another scripture quickly the first verse the first scripture we read talk about predestination the lord knew you before the foundation of the world you knew your name not just your name but agueron but the new name is identity good you're gonna break down name and we want to read the present tense form of the same scripture amen jeremiah talks about he knew you before you were formed in the belly of your mother's room in what form before you even you existed in clay and dust the lord knew you so we're going to look at that formation and that creation of knowing you but then let's look at another scripture and see how the lord knows you right now amen let's read from romans chapter 8 let's read the first verse and then we jump to verse 8 and read through 11. romans chapter 8 verse 1 8-11 romans 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit amen another contest uh pretty this way there's no condemnation to them which are incredulous who walk in the flesh after the spirit amen in the flesh means you are working in cystine element it's not a flesh of sin we are working in clay in dust in potassium sodium cosmic light this is thin element but you are not working after the ordinances of the cosmos you are working after the order of mercy sadiq the spirit of the lord in your heart amen so we want to look at that unless for the sake of time let's jump to verse 8. so then so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh or you are not in the cosmos but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwells in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his verse 10 and if christ be in you which he is in you amen how many can say this but the lord is in them glory hallelujah the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwarves in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal body amen if jesus christ this is a present tense how many can see jesus christ dressing them glory hallelujah so if jesus christ dwells in you then the spirit of christ or christ that was in you will quicken the flesh which is called jesus amen remember in the days of jesus in his flesh when he has to face cavalry he was a human being don't think he was only almighty god yes he was the almighty god he's almighty god he will ever be the almighty god but when he came insisting element part of his flesh part of his being was subject on to the flesh so when he was faced with cavalry he prayed that father he prayed to the people of fire in him the christ in him that it be thy wall let his suffering come mean suffering passover me but let your world not my world amen let us take prominence not the flesh so because that was the purpose for which he came to this world to die for you and i amen so jesus christ faced mountains and he prayed to the spirit of christ in him and that the logarithms in him took care of the situation and whatever you are facing now the logos christ in you is more than capable of taking care of your situation glory be to the lord let's jump to uh so this is the present tense the spirit of christ dwells in you and let's look at when this flesh drops what else if the lord knows you and i by name who is the almighty god then he should have made plans before the foundation of the world as he told jeremiah that before you were conceived in your mother's womb or in earth when you talk about womb not only the womb of a woman the earth is a woman it's a female version of christ before you were put in clear and dust he ordained you amen before you were born in west palm beach or in florida or in los angeles or in miami or in atlanta orlando wherever you were born in africa the lord ordained you and knew you amen he knew ordained that particular sistine element the calcium the potassium he he desired to manifest himself in that potassium called by the jagdaff amen so the lord knows you by name and whatever you are going through is already been taken care of glory hallelujah to the lord and now what about what we finish our earth our earthly journey and we drop this 16 element we put it back in the cosmos what else does the lord have for you and i glory hallelujah let's jump to second corinthians chapter five verse one two corinthians five one it says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and a house not made with hence eterna in the heavens for we know that if the earthly house the existing element were to do were to be dissolved right now we have we already have not that we will have but we already have you already possess it he said where is he it's right in you amen glory hallelujah and that house is a building not made with hands not ordained by your dad and your mom your early dad and your mom but it was odin before the foundation of the world before palm beach came into existence before united states became united states before the earth was formed before the moon came into creation the lord knew you and ordain you and that body existed amen and that body is who you are amen and that is eternity that is your true identity and that is eternal in the heavens and when you talk about heavens you've got three types of heaven god bless you buddy by jeffrey heaven is the church heaven is you yourself or we can even make it fall you are heaven because you are the church heaven not this tabernacle we are sitting in not this building i'm talking about you amen brother stephen god bless you you are heaven amen sister richard you are heaven says that you are heaven amen amen heaven is you ride you amen and the heaven is the firmament that hydrogen and and the gases that i mean encompasses the firmament that is also being described in the scriptures as heaven then the most important heaven is the pill of fire is heaven what we know heaven is the sixth dimension is the celestial world which is right here many times you look into the skies and above the skies and above the skies not the third heaven paul went to his body was right here but he moved into dimension amen or dimension were manifested to paul so he said i saw a man in the third heaven he was talking about himself his celestial body was his flesh body was in somewhere in arabia in israel but in the true paul which could not die the true saint paul the true apostle paul was in the 16th dimension he was walking on a blue grass he was walking on a land he was walking on a path on a road that wasn't built by the engineers of this earth but elohim himself spoke into creation amen so we have a building that when this one is dissolved that burden is already in you glory hallelujah that is what we call the holy spirit because it's a spirit it's a celestial spirit it's right here but this is the element eyes cannot see it so we call it spirit it's not alienated from you is you amen but aaron god bless you amen that is who you are that is the eternal being in you that is a portion of jesus christ in you amen glory hallelujah when you say you have the holy ghost or you have jesus christ let's say our sisters they don't have the man jesus christ 2000 years ago with beard living in in their flesh no but the christ amen the elohim the almighty god the people of fire that was in jesus the flesh the symbol of fire is sitting in sister virginia amen a sitting sister with sin glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so he is in you in the form of brethren amen not in the flesh of jesus christ two thousand years ago that flesh finished his job and now he's got another flesh called but again and that is the flesh is dwelling in blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen so the lord knew you he knows you and he will ever know you it's a tenor a settled deal amen glory to the lord now let's break what is her name when you talk about the name he said i know you by your name says the lord what is a name a name is first it's a nature a name is your nature and your nature identifies you so a name is an identification if you mention brother um brother joseph his name is identifies him if you call by joseph says salinda is not going to get up we're talking about joseph because sister linda is not brother joseph sister is not a joseph so in a moralist family there's an identification but joseph has a nature his nature he wants to be a minister he loves to preach the word of god to his sisters he loves to minister he has to save he loves to serve in the house of the lord so that is his nature i don't see sister linda and abigail coming to grab the microphone when people are coming but brad joseph has got something about him that loves to do that amen she's not abigail and stalin have what they do at home so a name identifies your nature glory hallelujah to the lord a name is also an attribute it's a character it shows your characteristics a name is a ministry a name is a calling a name is a manifestation your name is an established establishment of who you are glory hallelujah your name is in fact your destiny amen and if you want to go into the scriptures when um the wives of jacob when they were pregnant they when they were bringing for their children joseph and uh benjamin and judah and isaka and rubin and what have you seen on their mothers prophesied the holy ghost move on to their mothers and they spoke their destiny into existence some of them were fishermen some of them were priesthood levi some of them were farmers some of them were different they were hunters ruben was a hunter and their mothers spoke their destiny through the holy spirit into creation before even they were expelled from the womb amen so before you were expelled from the womb before you came to the existing element the lord ordained you for who you are ordain you for a ministry ordain you for a calling ordain you for an establishment order you for a manifestation order you for blessing order you for the glory of the living christ in your life blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ a name is also a connection glory hallelujah to your name to the name of the lord if i meet brother stephen there might be seven stephens if i mention stephen maybe all of them will look back or they realize that they don't know me no way but a brother stephen will come oh god bless you but a quick who because there's a connection between me and brother receiving does these savings may continue their way because they don't know me they have no connection with me but brother stephen has got a connection with me so if i call his name he's going to identify who i am amen so a name connects you to who you are glory hallelujah to you to the name of the lord a name is also a procession your name gives you your possession your earthly possession is all coded in your name because the name is your nature amen if you are ordained to be a farmer you like to get tools to do the farming so you're going to possess a tractor and things that you're going to use for agriculture so your name and your identity will help you to identify your possession glory the name also connects family and love when a father or a mother mentions the kid's name they trust him they feel the love of god in you of the father in their lives sometimes kids will tell you that dad mom catch me because they have faith in you they love you they know you love them they can i mean four front long and a headlong and they know you're gonna catch them or backwards that catch me brother catch me and you're gonna catch them because they have trust in you

circumstance glory hallelujah to the lord because he knows you by name amen and no matter you might be seemed to be falling headlong he's already got his arms to catch you amen [Applause] you might be falling backwards he's got his arms to embrace you amen because he knows you by name blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ glory let's read one scripture just to cement the point before we move forward let's go to isaiah chapter 45. isaiah 45 probably read from one to seven but now that says the lord who created thee or you o jacob he that from the o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine thou art mine you are the possession of the living christ you are the possession of eternity eternity possesses you you can't get lost amen you can't go down because eternity possesses you he's got angels to hold you he's got a pill of fire in you to hear your sickness he's got the holy spirit which is the same thing to take care of you amen he said i called it by name thou art mine what an assurance when the almighty said you brother jeffrey you are mine amen when thou passes through the waters he didn't say that because you are mine you are not going to get trials you're going to pass through some some deep waters amen and let's see what he said when you are passing through the trials and temptations of life thou for when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the ravens they shall not overflow thee glory hallelujah the lord will not give you any trials that you can overcome whatever trust you permit in your way and my way is already overcoming the celestial dimension amen since richard god bless you you already overcome your trials you possess your inheritance amen because he called you by your name glory hallelujah when that work workers through the fire thou shall not be burned glory hallelujah do you have a history of that a measure whether the one that passed through the fire and the father could not consume them and the soldiers were consumed but they came out laughing not even one one one of their hair didn't get consumed because the lord knew them by name amen so when you are going through the fire i don't know the fire you are going through today but the lord is with you and the fire will not consume you the fire is burning certain things out of your life to bring manifestation to bring your true name your identity into reality amen when thou walkers through the fire that shall not be banned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee amen the flame of the fire is not going to consume you you know even smell the smoke on you you've gone through so many challenges and here you are rejoicing in praising the lord so what you are going through today is already overcome the lord has already done it for you blessed be the name of the lord the lord said he knows you by name and what is your name bro morales what is your name god bless you go to revelation your name is jesus christ amen god bless you let's go for what i would say exactly your name is jesus christ your sister element is jose morales by your name your nature your identity your manifestation is jesus christ amen glory this is the element might be called cocoa organelle faith brother jagdaf but your name is jesus christ amen because he that is it lives in you jesus christ in you or the pull of fire in you is greater than josue morales muslim moralists may not be able to overcome everything whose morality has limitation coco has limitations but jesus christ in me in you does not have any limitation glory hallelujah remember when jesus got to the cross and the cross was heavy for him and he wanted to back off the christ in him overcame for jesus and the christ in you has already overcome for you glory be to the lord let's look at for the love that he has for you the lord identifies you let's look at some identification here i wanted to read a quote from the prophet message let's read uh says we will see jesus 61-1224 61-1224 says we will see jesus paragraph 34 let's see how the lord identifies you witnesses about you amen that you are his you look look at the jet plane if you look at the jet plane every jet plane has got two wings left wing and the right wing but the body itself is the plane that people sit in and where they put the luggage you don't put the luggage on the wings you don't see the people on the wings you see the people in the plane the winds are forward for balancing and control and to keep equilibrium amen now the scriptures identifies you and they give a witness of who you are amen the scriptures are for your balance and the first testament and the second testament are for your balancing now two is that one is the number of omnipotence almighty with the attribute in him without expression two is a number of multiplication a man marries a wife to multiply himself now three is the number of what perfection when you marry what is the next thing you got children that is the perfection of the marriage amen so the lord preferred himself in certain testament so let's look at other scriptures sorry ada quotation 6 1 1 2 2 4 6 we will see jesus paragraph 34. maybe as they are looking for it okay we've got it now glory hallelujah now when i see the scripture the prophet read when i see what those men and women went through with back there and see to maintain this same gospel so the gospel has to be maintained by who you amen sometimes we put the whole thing on the lord but the lord wants you to maintain the gospel amen because he's hiding in you remember moses that was that moses was looking up to the lord and the lord was looking up to moses one moses was in front of the red sea and moses couldn't move forward moses was crying with two two million people behind him moses was crying to the lord and the lord led moses to moses i am you amen you are jesus christ moses had a lot of amnesia because when the lord called him he said i've made you what god moses began to give excuses that i cannot speak i'm a stamina i killed i've got criminal records in egypt i can't go back to egypt the law said don't worry if you can't speak your brother aaron will be your prophet prophet spokesperson by you i've made you the almighty god because i'm going to put my foot in your foot put my hands in your hands put my lips in your lips and i the almighty will speak through you amen and whatever i place myself in there's a quickening there's a resurrection you become who i am amen glory hallelujah it's just like even your clothes when you wear your clothes it becomes part of you as long as it takes your sheep it takes your form and as long as you wear your clothes you can lift your hands the clue doesn't have any excuse they have to leave their hands if you put your hands down they bring their hands down because the clothes have become part of you and when the almighty put his flesh in you he's speeding you you become the almighty and nothing can touch you or terminate you until the almighty has finished with this element glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord has put in you to maintain the gospel of jesus christ and let's see how the old testament sins and the new testament maintain the gospel is that and when to maintain the same gospel and when they preach this same gospel the same thing that happened in the old testament new testament and then just exactly the same so that it gives it one two three witnesses amen god perfect things with three witnesses every word is established the same god that dealt with the old prophets he's talking about the old testament prophet dealt with the apostles does the new testament a prophet it's just this different title the same sort of christ was in them they were prophet brother brother smiley is a prophet but a jack is a prophet we use the term pastor apostles deacons by the same jesus christ is in you the seasons are prophetess amen so he said every word is established the same god that that dealt with the old prophet dealt with the apostles and dealt with their prenuncing brethren okay now we're going to the third phase and here and here he is today dealing with the same way with his people with the same signs same wonders same gospel same power same god everything we three as a witness to us that this is the truth we don't want that we don't try to figure out what is the truth it is the truth amen if you are already not forget it out then you have to figure out today that the message that the lord send it to you through the seventh angel message is the truth of the gospel for this day amen glory hallelujah this is a true god giving it in three testaments wow we thought we had to only two testaments but the prophecy that in three testaments so we're gonna find out what those three testaments are see the history 36 the bible is the history of what god was so was the history so the history of the old testament the new testament is the history of the new testament so the new testament is a history it's already been sealed up so where are we now we're gonna find out amen because from adam up to jesus that was the old testament that was the law and they were sealed now jesus began grace and grace is another testament another witness after a certain point and something has took over so let's finish with the quotes and we come to that the new testament is the history of the new testament and the 19 council and the fathers and post 19 council is the history of the church then verse 39 and now now spanish will say ahora now now history is making on just as it was which this history will never be written no it's too close to to the coming now amen so now your life is making a history you are telling a story your name is identifying your ministry you are bringing forth a manifestation you are unveiling christ to the world but it's going to be too fast and there's no time to write that history amen it's a present tense uh word made for the day so the old testament from adam up to let's see jesus that was the old testament and that encompasses mainly the law of god even within the law the law should grace remember the lord the lord give the lord to adam that that shall not touch the tree in the midst of the garden that was hello if you touch it the very day you touch it you will die and that was a law and when other men touch it they died in the flesh but adam couldn't die because he is an eternal being amen just like jesus he died in the flesh but almighty god could not die he died only to manifest redemption but the people of fire cannot die amen so when you die in the flesh you are not dead you still walking in the dimension right here it's only the flesh that goes back to the flesh so now in the old testament even in the midst of the law the lord was dealing with grace with father abraham the lord gave an unconditional covenant to abraham with abraham he made a bunch of mistakes horrible mistakes but the grace of the lord was with father abraham he was still the father of faith and a man of faith with our mother sarah amen and the law was a policeman when you break the law the cops will get you if the law says that 60 60 miles per hour limit on this street or road and you go 90 the cops will get you and give you a ticket you go to the court and go and tell the judge why we're making 90 on on 60 amen and that is the law so when you get the law you breathe along the law the police the enforcer will make sure that the law is respected the law will arrest you and after whatever consequence the law says you have to pay that punishment amen so that was the first testament and the first attribute of great elohim bringing his law into creation and so he ran the law and the police were catching people people were that people even died for for just breaking a little piece of the law of god sabbath picking up sticks which is nothing at this time you can go to the woods and pick sticks nothing will happen to you and last night i picked a stick i'll tell you a funny story that happened to me last night i was going to pray in the night and and sometimes i do exercise so i saw this raccoon and i see them all the time around the lake they do their own thing and i do my own thing so i was doing my exercise and one of them was on the tree he would drop down and he pretend like he's coming to me and i'll shout and he goes back to the tree and then he'll get up again and it's like we're playing games so it was this funny game he pretended like he he as if he's coming to me and i say hey go back go back and he goes back go and climb the tree and come back so one of the time he was really i don't know whether he was he wanted to be friendly so he was really coming to me like and i said i'm not ready for racoon this night [Laughter] so so go back and this time he wasn't going but he was coming so i took off one of my sneakers and threw it at a raccoon and he picked up sneakers and took it to the woods [Applause] i said what is this [Laughter] so he took my snicker to the raccoon i had only one snickers on and i said well let's just go take my i had myself wearing my kill him take my cell phone and key and go go home before he takes my cell phone and my keys so i went home no i took my i tried to figure out i went to get a stick and i saw some of them i threw the stick he wasn't even minding me i couldn't find a snakehead so i went home with i took off with snickers and i said you know what when adam was created it wasn't my issue let me just exercise around with my bare foot [Laughter] so i went home without one of my sneakers and i said lord i don't know what this game is about so this morning i got up and i went looking around and i saw the shoe in the woods know that's a law and i said was he supposed to be scared of the raccoon he wanted to be friendly with me but we've got complexes in our minds i remember when i got here people told me raccoons can attack i'm not i'm not the person who's really afraid of animals but i have that complex in my mind that maybe he was going to attack me but maybe the raccoon wasn't going to attack me he just wanted to be friendly but the fear in my mind caused me to remove my shoe and i had my shoe in the woods so that was it another testament to see one side of me that lord i need to have more love i need to have more faith i need to have more tenderness for creation because the raccoon wasn't going to attack me it was just to be have fun with me but i had complex in my mind so let's look at another attribute of grace glory hallelujah to the lord and one time william brown had had similar problems he saw a uh what was the name killer boo and this bull was actually charging on him and he i mean tried to get his raffle there was no gun and then he had no choice but to now allow the other attribute the law was in the lowest kill it because he's going to attack you but then grace and love came in and when love came in he was able to speak to the right to today today to the killer boo the killer i'm not here to disturb you i know this your ground is your house i'm just going to pray for a brother or sister of mine go back to where you live and the killer went back to where he was sitting amen and the more love we have the more we create we control the elements of creation because the lord created you toward to be the god of creation not to be the fear of creation he created you to speak to creation because creation is under you you are the god of creation you are the god on this earth god is ruling through your members amen and you can take our accomplices and what we see with our eyes what we hear what we taste what we smell and allow the sixth sense which is faith and allow the eleventh commandment which is love to manifest we can walk where there's a lion because you've got a love for the lion and the lion can feel the love you have for him and the lion will not do no harm amen you can walk through situations which people will run away from it and you go and bring the victory out of that situation glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord has this three testament a law which ran its call from adam to jesus then when jesus came in he opened another testament which is what grace asked by the judge preached uh two weeks ago that grace is jesus christ himself amen grace is a person and who is that person is the person of jesus christ glory hallelujah but a smiley preacher was the last week about jesus christ makes the difference or bring the changes amen jesus christ is the one that can bring grace when the police arrest you jesus christ can pay the ticket jesus christ can wash away the crime jesus christ can take care of of the law that you broke and bring grace into your life glory hallelujah to the lord so jesus or grace is the attorney the defense attorney he's a lawyer that takes care of your situation because when you break the law the police arrest you handcuff you you're going to jail you need to get what the best lawyer you can get and who is the best lawyer than jesus christ himself he comes here and said i'm the lord i'm the lawyer i'm defending uh bradgarin and he'll take care of you stand in your place yes you committed a crime you run 90 on 60. so you deserve to get maybe paid 200 to the state of florida but i'm the lawyer i'm thinking of the situation and he's he's behind me i put him behind me the lord the grace of god covers you the blood of jesus christ wash away all your sins you did commit a crime but the grace of god the holy spirit wash and cleanses your sin and you come out come out as white as known so from jesus when the lord broke the covenant of greece he opened it unto paul let me even go back to moses moses the one was there was the epitome of of law is that right the lord didn't start from moses it start from adam but moses was given special eyes to see to write the book of genesis in the beginning was god created the heaven and the earth and there was adam and there was his wife and there was mrs adam and they were at the animals but moses himself was a criminal what crime he was a murderer he killed somebody in egypt the one who was the greatest enforcer of the law the prophet of god was a killer am i right so he broke the law himself before he started living doing the job amen and the lord was telling us something and now paul moses actually did kill an egyptian physically when he saw an egyptian and a jewish guy fighting he stood for the jewish guy and he killed the egypt and he demanded a son but his sins were what were uncovered by the grace of god so was using him amen now paul paul was also a criminal what crimes he did commit he said he killed paul didn't kill physically but he killed by aiding and albertan eating an albertan is if i say let's say brother nehemiah go kill somebody it wasn't my hands physically that killed the person but then i was the one aiding an albertan for him to kill so paul was the one killed by eden and albertan but he was still a criminal so paul said that i'm not even worthy to be called an apostle because the blood of the sins were on my hands he partook through eden albertans by killing the saints but then the grace of god was more than sufficient for paul so now we see grace coming in now there's another law so the grace throughout the seven churches ran its course from jesus christ who opened that covenant gave it to apostle paul and he ran from sminer pergamos up to the seventh church age then the lord brought in another covenant the covenant of love that is perfection amen if you look at jet plane like i said it's got two wings the left wing and the right wing they are for balancing but the most important part is the body of the plane itself that is where lives are kept that's where human beings are kept that's where luggages are kept you don't put your luggage on the wings you don't put human beings on the wings you don't tell humans to hold their wings we are flying from amsterdam to miami so hold on wings and we're going to get to uh miami safely it's not going to happen because it's not meant for humans to be on their wings it's just to balance the plane amen where human being life is what is the body of the plane so the third testament is where we dwell love sorry law and grace was to balance love amen the love of christ manifested the law of god and it manifested grace to keep the balance you commit a crime but the grace of god is sufficient for you because of what his love for you glory hallelujah to the lord so love is the what is the judge now in the court of law the police will come and recite your crime i saw jeremiah breaking the running 90 i saw koku breaking into this house i've got evidence with a camera with a video yes did you break into the house yes i broke into the house what were you trying to do i'm good i was going to steal a car so you've got a crime right there but then you've got a lawyer which is greece but then when the judge comes in he looks at the police he look at the lawyer he take his hammer he's close it's a foolish case he's forgiven he didn't even commit a crime but you have evidence that they committed a crime the judge has got the financier the judge doesn't even need the the lawyer to defend you the judge is that your sins which were red crimson uh read as as as read could be your sins are all wiped off and his grace and his love has forgiven you you are spotless you are sinless daughter and son of the living god go and manifest jesus christ amen glory hallelujah to the lord let's take another example from birth natural breath when a child is born before a child is born when anyone is pregnant for nine months what is the first thing comes from the womb of the woman water what is the water for it's a balancing it's a sign that a child is coming now when the water comes what else comes blood blood is als another weakness blood is stronger than water water is the first pool there's life coming but the mother is not expecting water he's not going to carry the water that broke from a womb and said oh god bless you bye sweetheart i've got the water for you that's not what your husband is looking for that's what the family is looking for they want to see what life they want to see a being they want to see a body your husband and your family are not going to rejoice because you brought water broke from your womb oh mom i've got this water from my womb that's not a child no that's not your baby that's just a water that was a witness that life was coming so the life the the the water comes first the blood comes face then what comes the third pool now a baby a live girl a live boy a twin whatever draws from your womb and there's a quickening power there's a voice the baby begin to cry and god glory hallelujah there's life i've got my daughter i've got my son i've got a grandson i've got a nephew i've got whatever you have then the family begin to rejoice they put their baby on on the tummy of their mother now begin to bond you begin to identify you're going to possess is we're going to establish because it's a name amen your name you knew that baby by name amen when woman is pregnant they buy stuff before the baby is born they even choose a name for the baby the mother choose a name whatever you want to call the name i don't want to i don't understand that you want to tell us something god bless you you choose a name for the baby right now the baby doesn't know that he's got a name the baby is just a it's just a muscles one is in the mother's womb he doesn't know what's going on she doesn't know what's going on but the mother and the father knew the baby or knows the baby by name amen the baby just kicking in their mother's womb he doesn't and he's just feeding on their mother but he doesn't know he doesn't even have a spirit until the baby is born then the spirit the lord says move into the baby and the baby christ then they begin to begin to with time not even the first day going to see her mother so now when babies are born their eyes look at one direction they don't see even if you are looking their face they don't see a time comes they begin to identify their mother and their father and they begin to smile amen now now they are beginning to recognize who they are glory hallelujah and you and i are on the same platform just like the queen of shiva we were in adult worshiping but we heard about salomon the greatest king of the land and there was something that was craving to hear from solomon and then when we got to salomon we threw all our idol worshipping our way and we had to learn things from the kingdom of solomon in the kingdom of someone they sink they blew trumpet they were holy they were righteousness they were walking after the ordinances of solomon but greater than solomon is here the lord jesus christ himself is here and the lord jesus christ has got ordinances and he's got a concept and it's got revelation it's got manifestation and attribute for you and i to learn and manifest amen said that you will not run away from raccoon you know give your shoes to raccoon that attribute is love amen what you can overcome yourself you will come this guy here and you move by the pill of fire in you that i'm a son of god i don't care the river surrounding me i don't get the situation around when i speak creation obey me glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ he is worthy of our praise amen i feel so much energy here in this school when i was going i knew somehow i didn't know we were going to come to school but by revelation i know that i won't come back to the same the same place i wanted to talk about jack when i say you know what let me just leave it but i knew i won't come back to the same place so i look at the place and i enjoy it for the last time and i knew so i wasn't surprised when when i came in the place has changed and i feel so much energy here do you know that the energy in the system the lord put energy by creation in places even in a job place when you go to a place on the street restaurant sometime when you're going there's crowded you feel a little bit stressful sometimes you go to certain places you have a little bit of depression because the energy there some people emit negative energies and the energy is being shared by other people but when you go to let's say a restaurant places where they feel people and you could see their spirit you can respirate you feel like you are more at ease there's more energy for you but where this crowd where there's a lot of people around no stampede your spirit doesn't rest over there and i could see for me i rest more he might feel like my spirit feels more attitude is here then we enjoy the class at the the church over there but here is more relaxing and the lord will take us where he wants to take us amen so we don't worry about the name because it's a middle school we look at what the lord is doing we don't worry about classroom no there's more energy here you're more free here you don't have other churches and noise and preaching and singing coming in here when you you can chat over after service there's more energy there's more there's no competition we don't have to disturb nobody there's more energy and the lord knows where it's taking us to amen so the lord moves from glory on to glory from experience onto experience and enjoy whatever the lord gives you we are more blessed amen i don't want to divide into into but i'll tell a testimony in africa when i started my church in ghana we sat in a classroom and then we moved into we had a piece of land but the land wasn't developed so we put in you know bamboo probably some of you don't know bamboo but we put bamboo and we put leaves palm leaves not a aluminium sheet no no roof palm leaf on it and i told my people that we are going to our land and said no how can we go why we've not developed the land i said no let's go because there's so much disturbances in the classroom when we moved there there was so much energy we're so much at peace because it was our own possession and then we move into wooden structure we put a wooden structure and put aluminium roofs on top that was what the maybe the second pool if i should call it the second pool then we move into concrete amen so the lord moves from greece unto unto greece unto greece amen or from grass onto greece i remember when we were in london that's when we started building putting on burden structures concrete so the lord knows what he's doing he wanted to appreciate each step the lord was the possession was was the author and epitome of love but when he created adam his love was there already but he gave adam law to keep amen and the lord was good in his time and the lord moved him to grace and moving to perfect love amen so the lord moved us from uh the cl the church from where we were it was great we enjoyed it the lord did manifestation here is more greater amen and a lot of moves to where he wants us to be amen so so don't don't don't remember and mourn that oh why are we in the classroom rejoice dance and praise the lord glory hallelujah rejoice and just serve the lord be happy amen it's not the room that matters it's our harder matters it's the holy ghost in you that matters amen so rejoice and and let's give our pastor all the support that we can give and the lord knows what he's doing amen it's not it's not easy to be a leader it's not easy at all to be a leader when you're a leader you've got thousand things on the mind this to fix this to face it is the grace of god and the love of christ amen and when we give support to our leaders then the blessings of the lord will flow when we mama like the people of moses then we stay behind we stay in egypt for too long amen so let's rejoice and be happy and give our leader all the support and everything will line up amen and whenever the lord wants us to live here the lord will make it happen glory so keep praying let's keep praying and keep rejoicing and keep doing what you're doing the lord has already been set up for us glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you by the job for what you're doing it's not easy to be a pastor but a smiley can give us he's a witness a man it's not easy to lead people it's not even easy to lead animals that's why people certain people don't like human beings they rather adopt a dog and a cat because the dog and a cat is he has a wall but his will is can easily be controlled but for human beings psychologists call it homo they have a theory called homo mechanicals and homo dynamicals it's not big mechanical like a microphone is a mechanical object you can do whatever i want to do it cannot object to that but then when it comes to himalayan brother joseph maybe the mother wants to feed him with plant food but he might say mom i don't want plant food maybe i want to eat meat [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] and so and so stamana has to work hard to make sure but i just even plant food and i know my mother was sweet because he's not a mechanical being but i would say can i talk about you a little bit just to emphasize something i remember one time but someone that told me but jose told me oh my wife is putting me on plant food for one week so he did it and after the sweet text me said luke tell your sister and put a weekend he said tell your twins and puerto rican i'm not going to stop eating pork [Music] i think someone doesn't he said i'm not going to stop eating pork and i was we're laughing and laughing then after a while i said i think i think i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to do what mandy told me i'm going to be on plant food you see human being is not a mechanical being you have to work hard he might not understand the vision he might object to it but you'll be patient be loving be prayerful and be kind and you'll cut he'll be cut right into the vision amen so don't criticize certain things you must understand why we are here amen the lord has us here for purpose and at the right time he will take us here to where he wants us our school and our church amen blessed be the name of the lord lord jesus christ samantha has done a human job to try to get a puerto rican to stop eating pork and be on plant-based food bravo god bless amanda [Applause] so sometimes we have to work hard to get what we need to get we have to pray and samana said oh i'm not going to i'm just going to pray for him and the prayers did a trick so prayers and love will bring the manifestation of christ glory hallelujah to the lord you pray you commit things into the lord if you don't feel comfortable here you just pray don't don't be angry don't stay at home because we school we church in the school room some people are churching under trees at church under bamboo tree i remember there was a time when it rains we go to the nearby house we pack our tools and go because when you have a plant leaf as your roof when it rains you know what happens it just comes so sometimes we having a wonderful time in the rain comes and we run away to the nearby house when the rain stops we come back and go back and forth and we're enjoying it we're just happy and rejoicing and praising the lord even for giving us a piece of land amen glory hallelujah so thank god we have our instrument we still have uh engineers around we still have uh the piano and everything we still have all the body of christ our brothers and sisters amen nobody's dead we are here so why don't you rejoice and be thankful to the lord glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen and when in doing the things of the lord it doesn't come cheap i want to read maybe one more quotes and i want to infuse something and and we keep going let's read it from six five the power of transformation transformation power of transformation six five dash one 1031m paragraph let's say 78 for the sake of time 65-1031m power of transformation 1965. paragraph 78 glory to the lord and you see what the lord put the effort jesus christ put into into it to get you and i where we are and we will appreciate him the more amen we serve him with everything that we have and the lord has made you a redeemer as well to also to redeem so let's read our quotes um power of transformation 78 he said our redemption wasn't cheap thin wasn't a cheap thing my redemption and your redemption it didn't come cheap to the lord jesus christ maybe because it's history we were not there physically to see how jesus christ suffered but it was mutilated so his demeanor his form didn't look like a human being that is how he looked like it wasn't as our redemption wasn't wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of god had to die for us see things of value come of great price things of value come of great price it comes with a price if you want to buy a certain dress let's take even a natural you go to the shop there are different dress you can go to dollar shop no they don't sell clothes over there you can go to maybe a good world and you can get maybe some five dollars clothes goodwill and salvation army but then if you want to go to sustain store brand name stores if you want to go and buy a adidas nike they come with price if you want to go and buy a certain dress sisters setting suit what brother jack is wearing brother but i really wearing it has got a price but but uh he doesn't want to it's got a price on it amen it's not it's not 20 dollars you can't go to that shop and say i want to get a suit three piece suit with twenty dollars they're gonna look here i think you are the wrong place go to salvation army you can get something for 20 dollars and so it's a redemption eternal life didn't come true to the lord jesus christ he has to put his own life down it wasn't a simple death but it was a death with suffering so that when you come out just like the water lily the water lily go through a lot in the river beneath the earth but when the water really comes above the earth is the one of the most beautiful plants around the river around the lake because that's good to fight his or her way out to come up so the lord has put his quote your name in you your name is the nature of christ in you is the cut of jesus christ in you and the lord is bringing out that attribute your manifestation and it doesn't come cheap it comes with a price amen the lord has put a ministry in you be you a sister or a brother everyone has got a ministry but i joseph has got a ministry every one of us has got a ministry so brother i'm not brother jack no you don't have to be bad jack be who the lord has made you to be you might be the sweeper you might be the cleaner you might be the one who support financially you might be the one who witnesses and bring people to the church in the bible was it stephen in the bible he used to witness and look at the supernatural the lord did in his life the lord gave the holy ghost to peter peter was the one who releases the holy spirit but stephen and a small apostle they go and they go and witness and then when it comes to their feelings hebrews we've got this uh lady this young man here they want to hear the gospel we witness to them and we want you to come in you know you bring in a masterpiece amen so the jack cannot go and witness to everybody in west palm beach and come and preach and do things he needs to do the lord has given each and everyone a ministry and the ministry doesn't come cheap amen and let me give her a testimony of my trip to ghana i just want to infuse it and i'll keep on with it with the same one i started fine i had two things on my mind two major things one was barrier of my father that was not too much important but the most important thing that was on my heart was a church to raise amen so when i went i passed through england just for transit when i got there i think on the sixth god bless you by the jerry brady gave me a ride i got there and everything went smoothly until i got to heathrow terminal five when i got there they said oh we needed to um make a booking to do covet tests when you go to ghana so people yes we have it here we have the code you pay 150 when you get there but then british airways have their own rule the rule is there's another website somewhere to pay the money and if you didn't pay the money you are not buying british airways wow about probably more than 10 people we couldn't board so i had to stand there and buy another ticket for the next day so i came back went to a hotel came by the next day the same british always they say oh this time around where's your passport where's your visa i had a u.s passport and i said the last time i went they told me not to get a passport not to get a visa because i'm a ghanaian and i'm a born ghanaian so when i get together i get a vest on a river there's a no way you're not going you need to get a visa so you have to call ghana embassy to give a visa to me the long story short i couldn't go that day and buying ticket up on ticket so i had to go to ghana embassy in london to get a visa and just i was i was there for about four or five days and i spent about four to five thousand dollars just going just like that and i got to a place i said you know what i know i'm going to ghana if i have to go back to the us and reroute to belgium or germany i'm going to do that there was a pregnancy in me i need to deliver the child amen there was a seed in my heart that the lord put in my heart years ago and that seed has to manifest glory hallelujah and i'll bring it to where we are now so by thanks me together i got a visa and i went the funeral wasn't it was important to me but that wasn't a major thing even during the funeral i was seeing a lot manifesting things about the church so after the funeral we rested for a week and then we came back to the same place to start a church it wasn't a silver platter things of value come with a price amen not only financially but the stress you go through traveling i was moving through triangle going to all the time just moving come to the old church and i was also the lord is doing new things even in the old church the youth and the brethren the lord was doing wonderful things one of my one of my co-co pastors his daughter i dedicated her about 14 years ago and she said i've got a song i said wow he said the lord has given me three songs that i wrote myself and i want to sing it to you and to the church and he's been singing to the church so beautiful so she signed a song for me and we started the youth because the youth is the future of today and tomorrow amen so my the old church i wasn't worried too much about the elderly people but the young people are coming up that was where my heart was so i was ministering in two major places and going to accra moving here and there all the time there was one time that i was i nearly broke down i stretched my body beyond beyond what the body could take but things of value comes with what with a price and if you're not ready to pay the price you can't serve the lord even if you sin there's a price to pay people can go to jail for years and if you serve god there's a price to pay by serving the lord the price is positive there's a blessing there's a reward but i'm saying that i think i didn't finish reading the quotes let me go on a little bit god bless you the same quote the last one that we read transparent transformation he said paragraph 79 i said to bring this message it wasn't easy see nah no it isn't easy i had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is you see is to do the will of god it's a blessing to the soul regardless of how what you lose money friends position job whatever properties the value is in serving the lord jesus christ when you are connected with your creator when you are established in the perfect world of the creator your heart is at peace because you know that all the dimension of the world is working for you i will continue let me just finish reading the quotes so the val is and to do that which knowing that there's something in me when they when they say they was going to put me away thought i lost my mind baptizing in the name of jesus christ contrary to the church and all these things they say he's crazy but you see no matter what they said there's something has to be done and god just takes a person sticks him in his hand and do what you need to do amen now it's common to be baptized in the name of jesus christ every chap a lot of churches are baptized in the name of jesus christ not there it's nothing strange but in the time of william abraham to be baptized in the name of jesus christ which is in the bible you can read crystal clear from acts chapter 2 verse 36 to 38 repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the promise unto you william brahman didn't put it there jewel professed about it and apostle paul and the prophet put it there but just to baptize the name of jesus christ they thought he was crazy he was bringing strange doctrines and people disown him people forsook him in serving the lord you have to pay a price be you a sister a pastor a deacon a child sometime people mock you for the way you dress our sisters brothers we don't go through that much because your haircut probably doesn't change unless maybe you had to wear your rings and hard dreadlocks but if you are maybe plain brother you you didn't change much you still wear jeans but for the sisters to switch from wearing certain dress pants and and bikinis and those things to dress like ladies they have to pay a price what is the price mercury what is the price you're gonna be isolated people look at you up and down and laugh at you people like will not even employ you some jobs will not employ you because of the way you dress but that's the price you pay if you want to serve the lord are you ready to serve the lord are you ready for the price or you want to go with the flow now you have been ordained and called and preordained for a certain destiny on earth and if you are ready to pay the price you can't count your blessing i remember i was standing in london and i was like even my bank one of the time i before i went i traveled to mexico for two weeks and i called i went to my bank to make sure that i used my debit card i don't use credit card as of now but then they did my bank began to put limitations on my debit card and they blocked it completely so i had to coach his bank that hey i'm the one in london i'm the one spending those money so release my release my account for me samantha can testify and i went through about five hours just to get my my bank but the lord knows what he was doing and when i went to ghana i remember we went to we started we went to convention on friday the fact we didn't preach saturday there was a wedding at the place so we had to wait for the wedding around four o'clock and we started singing we i took a cross session of the church the old church we took because sometime one past test ministers alone go to preach all that people see ministers they don't say what is the church like who are they like but sometimes their sisters tell a story they are alive just looking at them they could see they could descend your spirit they could see their christ in you and that is an attraction to even the sisters so we took cross-section adult young teenagers different sections about 15 and we went and the night when we started singing and preaching the pill of fire took over and souls were touched people began to come in wanted to be baptized and i think in the night we finished after they preaching around eight o'clock and everybody didn't want to go so we started praying for everybody and praying we to about midnight almost eleven something and one of my cousin he came to take a mic and he gave a testimony was in tears he said the lord has brought a new key to them that key is through his cousin and their lives were not going to be the same the past is gone and they have a new key the gospel key the religion of jesus christ for them and he was in tears as was giving that testimony so this sunday we continued there was another wedding on a sunday so we had to wait but we preach on and we had about five 20 people give their life to the lord five were ready to be baptized in africa we do more baptism in rivers and lakes and so the rivers were dried it's a place full of mountain we went and they told us to go to their source the sauce was also dry so we couldn't baptize them we just put it on hold but we've got about at least 20 people that have given their life to the lord they have given their hearts to the revelation of jesus christ for this hour you don't know what you have what you have now what is common to you yes you go about you know i have my problems i have my issues but what you how and who you are now somebody would have wished to be you even in the midst of your limitations and your challenges and problems someone would have wished to be you for the spirit of christ that dwells in your heart regardless of your circumstances and the circumstances are just to build your character amen they'll go in their time don't worry we're not going to stay here forever you're not going to be in middle school forever so be happy and rejoice the lord has said as a transition point for a purpose amen sometimes when our heart is on summer the lord has a way of temperance and turning things down he wants us to look at him all the time not to look at material things not to be over over elated or we're going to get a new church a new school oh yeah glory hallelujah it's good but the lord wants us what let us be be in uh how do you call it being equilibrium be balanced amen he wanted us to look at him him first not that building in the school face he want to look at him because if the building is we have got a flashy building and our heart is not for him then the burden is a waste of time if if the lord gives us the most powerful uh a cathedral with all the pipe organs and everything and we pay for it and we go there with arms wrists then that doesn't please the lord so the lord make sure you bring us to a classroom a little school room here but happy full of energy and when we finish here he knows when to take us from this place blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah to the lord [Applause] he knows you by name he knows your situation by name he called you you weigh him you are him before the foundation of the world you are his attribute in manifestation and is bringing out his life in your life and all he wants you to do is love him and surrender to him like i said a child can can love the parents can love the father the grandparents say grandpa catch me grandma catch me because of confidence and your problems that you have if you can love the lord your problems will be it will diminish you know how it diminishes because you have confidence even if it's sickness that the lord has healed you you've a rapha it is his word that he said his name is the overrapha rapha means what the healer of all your infirmities and he will heal you and the healing is in you and even if you make your mic make up your mind like shadrach meshach meshach and abednego that lord even if he doesn't deliver us from this fire we will not bow to idols and if the law doesn't heal me i have to go with this sickness to death glory hallelujah i'm going to rejoice and praise the lord all my life to my last breath and if you have that determination the problem is already gone because it's not going to bother your mind you know that the lord has really taken care of and that's what the lord wants to bring it just like i was using my story the lord doesn't want you to fear raccoon and when i was scared of raccoon he made sure that raku took my shoes to the woods next time i'm going to have to be brave and embrace the raccoon he's a creation of god and i'm the i'm the creator you are the creator we are the one the lord told adam that you are the god of this earth he spoke into creation but again you are a creator there is a creative power in you but you are going through what you are going to do for first scriptures let's look at the lord jesus christ when he was born one was being born there was not even a place for him to be born they tried all the inn in is a hotel none of them will have them over there they even wanted to pay probably doubled what they paid we don't want you here and peter no peter joseph probably didn't understand mary how maybe mary will look at joseph joseph why we've got the money we want to pay triple but they don't want why what's going on but mary didn't know that there was a scripture written that jesus the messiah was born inward in a pen in where lamps are brought forth not to be born in a big fanciful hospital saint mary's or cleveland hospital but to be born in a home where animal not just even in a home a home is gorgeous but where lamps ride feed and eat and sleep as thinking place to fulfill a scripture when he was born was a herod wanted to kill him so they have to run him to africa egypt to hide him over there they crossed the what they call a swiss canal hidden in egypt for so long years until herald died and when herod died they knew the lord took joseph now herod is dead bring the messiah the child to israel when he got there his son was raining he said hey his son is here and he's as bad as his father then it's okay take him to nazareth to keep him over nazareth but then they didn't know that the scriptures had to be fulfilled because it has to be called a nazarene he was consecrated to the lord so he has to be what taken to nazareth first to be hidden nazareth until the situations were smooth before he comes to is it galilee or where he was so your life is full of fulfilling scriptures you might know i was standing in london and i was wondering what's going on here i know the lord has since under control and i know the seed in my heart has to be planted i have to relieve just like a woman a woman when he's pregnant is 9 months you have to give birth you can't hold it any longer your belly is this way you are tired you're walking this way all you want to do is what have your baby and be at peace and when god puts something in your heart to do you can't rest he anoints you just like he did unto mary and joseph and they were running jesus to egypt in africa bringing back to uh to israel to nazareth the bible said that the scriptures might be fulfilled so your life are you messy jesus christ are you mr jesus christ are you fulfilling scripture this day then don't complain lord i may not understand the lord will not reveal everything to you on the spot you might not know that oh what i'm going through now is fulfilling scriptures it could even be a sickness that the lord will bring his attribute of healing in your life why am i going through so much pain why are certain promises delayed in my life the lord is fulfilling scriptures in your life and you have to be thankful and rejoice in your situation don't mama and complain don't blame the pastor don't blame the but i said lord thank you for the jack thank you for that smiley thank you for that troy thank you for that jerry thank you for my dickens thank you for my sisters thank you for still recap thank you for stabes thank you for stakab thank you for all my brothers and sisters glory to the lord thank you for seduction thank you for sister bernie and all the precious sisters glory to the lord because your life is a manifest manifestation of the scriptures every day that you leave every place that you step you have the pill of fire in you you are fulfilling scriptures the scriptures are it's like the wings of the jet plane they bear witness they bear testimony their balance of who you are but you are the body you are the third of them amen not even a third you are the fullness because paul said in a corinthian somewhere i said when i was a child i i spoke like a child and i knew things in parts fractions are not complete so we are not in the in the first testament second testament third testament we are in the fullness of christ amen all of christ has been poured into you glory hallelujah to the lord the fullness of god is in brother brother simba it's important jerry is about that brother my brother is over there amen isabella marquis and brother quentin amen his name is satina this is a cherise crisis in you manifesting his glory and you have to thank the lord and rejoice the lord will bring somebody in your life because you're a messiah you don't know why the lord brought this person in your life the person might be messed up was it by the jackal but brother smith friendly preaching that but abraham when he was young he had a friend who was drunk and all drunk up and gave me a place to sleep what would you have done oh i don't want a drunkard in my house you have to be sensitive to the spirit and he prayed for the friend he was drunk and maybe vomiting thrown up and seeing all kind of i mean trash but ram was looking at the seed in him and the lord created the right atmosphere when's the star is it nearly the dancer had a demon went to dance and had a demon and when he came he was drunk but when he saw the demon he woke up all the craft and alcohol left him he saw a bat flapping in the room a demon physically he said wow this is this must be real and begin to shook him he quickened him to know that i needed help and he was trying to hide where abraham was amen so there are people that they might be dull they might not be sensitive to their spirit love them when the right time comes the lord will raise the situation to wake them up in your life the lord might have brought somebody it could be a family person it could be somebody in your life maybe you love them they love you but their life doesn't line up but you keep pouring the love of god in here in their lives keep blessing them keep doing what you're doing because you are the messiah to them you are jesus christ to them you are the redeemer because christ is in you doing that and the more you do that the blessings will come shall we be on our feet glory to the lord shall we pray father we thank you for this day we give all the glory to your name for the worst that have been broken lord into pieces further bind them to our hearts lord the words are life you meant for a purpose you said you know us by our name and you call us by name as you call jacob for a manifestation identification a calling a nature blessing and all the attribute father i pray for each and every one here and those listening in through online through internet bless them lord jesus

every one father at a point of need father we thank you we bless you we give other glory to you in jesus christ and we pray amen god bless you he knows my name and he knows my hand with all he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when i call oh [Music] he knows my name thank you jesus yes [Music] he sees each tear [Music] sing that verse i have a father oh i have a fire and he calls me his own [Music] [Music] and he knows my name thank you lord he knows my every thought [Music] he sees easter that falls oh when he hears me when i call oh he hears me when i call he hears me when i call can we give the lord a hand of grace thank him for the word of god that was given to us on today i know you're by your name saith the lord sitting there listening to brother quake who just so much was shared and just thinking on last sunday i left church just feeling like i've been in church and this sunday i'm leaving church again feeling like i've been in church i've been encouraged i've been strengthened and just just appreciate how the lord uses the different uh ministering gifts that we have in our midst and amen and um i was just just just just really really blessed this morning thank you uh brother quaker just for just yielding yourself and just allowing god to speak to you to us amen uh before we go um y'all can be seated just for a minute uh i actually there was two people that had approached me um within the last little bit and just mentioned to me that they they had testimonies that they wanted to share and i just wasn't sure when we were going to have time to to get it all worked out uh but i wanted to give some room for that amen on today since we do have a little time and and i know one with sister nelly she asked about just wanting to be able to share testimony and also uh brother josue asked about being one uh wanting to share a testimony so i want to just give them a little space say man just to share uh from their hearts i'll ask for the whole way to come first and then i'll let sister nelly come after that amen so brother elsa if you don't mind you can come and just share the testimony that you have in your heart that you want to share god bless you all um you know i never thought about what brother quake was saying you know we were we were kind of like we didn't like the sound on the other the the church over there the back it was bothering us preachers would come and they're worshiping at the same time so we kind of i was one was like man lord can you do something about that so he did like it is a lot more peaceful we we're out here by ourselves so i think it's kind of like a a little taste of when we have our own building you know we can fellowship brother brother brother troy don't have to come out there shh none of that so so we actually like that that's just one one thing that i can say possible i didn't even think about it but it blessed my heart when he said that um so i told brother jack you know there's just a little something that's going on um both of my shoulders actually won on the shoulders and um really for for about like two months already he's been going on and he got to the point where it just bothered me so much and i told mandy i said mandy you know like make me a doctor's appointment you know i want to kind of see what's going on with my shoulder and um and i told her that you know i believe i actually asked brother kweku when when i picked him up from the airport and we had to go pick up the keys and and uh brother jerry's he had his keys and i told brother quake i said brother quaker you know i need you to pray for him he said won't we wait till we get to brother jerry's house and and we'll we'll all join together we will pray you know so we did that and we prayed over my shoulder and i told mandy pray for me linda abby pray for me but the joseph prayed for me i mean there's some people praying for this um and and i told mandy i said you know in the meantime that the lord uh uh uh heals me because i'm believing for my healing um why don't you just make a doctor's appointment and then we'll just kind of figure out and if the lord wants to use the doctor then he use the doctor i'm just whatever whether it's through the doctor now i'm believing that god is going to heal me um so i went actually to to get some x-rays done and they took some x-rays and after the extra i went to my supply house where i pick up uh supplies for my business and and the guy there he's telling me where you coming from he said coming from i told him i'm coming from x-rays and i told him what was happening he's like ah i mean that's exactly what i'm going through here i'm going to surgery on on next friday i'm going to to surgery and i was like you know he's like the doctor said i got this and it's exactly what it is when you're sleeping you can't sleep it's it's incredible pain i said a sec he described exactly what i'm going through and he said that the doctor said that it was the only surgery that can fix that you know so um i started doing some research with abby and nina in the car and joseph we started doing some research of the pain that i was having and exactly like he said he said what you have is a it's a it's a tear on your tendon and and there's like nothing they could do like you literally have to do surgery so when i got to the house i'm like baby i know what i have you know i haven't gotten the results i know exactly what it is and and she's like no you can't speak like that you can't i said i'm not speaking i'm just saying that's what it is now i can tell god exactly what he needs to fix you know she's like you can't speak i'm like i'm not speaking out of faith i'm just saying this is what it is now i'm telling god directly especially i'm gonna be specific what he needs to fix you know and then she's like no you can't speak that he said the only way to fix that is surgery i was like no now you talking some stuff now now now you're telling me i'm just saying what it is now you're telling me that the only way that they can fix that is through surgery you know so i was like nah i believe that god can heal me you know and then what i'm saying this i god has still haven't gave me my healing yet i'm believing for my healing but what i want to share this testimony was because after that the the next morning mandy called me and she said you know i just remember something and and a few like about a year ago i was having some pain in my heels when i woke up in the morning like i for until i warmed up i really couldn't walk and they did some tests and they and they took some s-rays and i had these bones splints on my heels right and the doctor like they took like this one for sure they took the x-rays i have the x-rays i'll bring them to y'all if you want to see them and i had those a bunch of them split and the doctor said you know what the only way this thing is going to get fixed is we have to do surgery we go in there we scrape them off you know and we started praying for that and about a month went by and i didn't i i was waking up in the morning i told i told her i was like look i'm like i don't have it no more so i haven't took in another x-ray to see that they're not there but if they're still there god took i remember one time brother brother uh uh troy was preaching he said that the the god didn't take the hebrew voice out the fire but he he took the heat out of the fire so maybe they're still splinting there but i don't feel them so so mandy she told me she's like you know baby i was telling you that the only way that they can fix that was through surgery but they said that the only way they can take those plans out was through surgery and they never did the surgery and you're fine with it you know so so my testimony was just it's like a pre-testimony i'm letting you guys know that i believe that god can heal this there's a tear there's three different ways there's like a full tear and there's a half tear whatever it is doctor hasn't even told me what it is but regardless what it is god already like he brings things to your remembrance you know we sometimes we don't need examples from the old testament we just our own you know so i think my my wife that she's like you know baby i just want to lift your faith up god already did that they didn't have to do surgery so i believe that god can heal i just want to ask you guys to to join in prayer for me um um the devil wants to like they said that if they do that surgery then i would have to uh uh take about two months that i can't like move my arms and and and i i'm not going through that i believe that i'm not going to go through that i believe that god already provided my healing he showed me through what he already done that he can do that and i just want to encourage you all that that that remember what god did for you he did it for you one time he could do it again he's never done it and he did it for me he can also do it for you guys so keep me in prayer god bless you all i don't have my oil but we're going to pray for brother i'll sway father we come according to your word you told us to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so lord these uh problems that he's having with his shoulders we know how that would impact his work reaction to it touch him even right now that you bring healing to his body and that whatever the condition is it would be cursed at the root father that you would just be manifested once more in his body just as you took care of the the the splints lord there and all the problems we've had with his uh with his uh lord his feet now take take control of this the shoulders father you're the one that designed his body you made it and father we uh we know that you made it to not have all this pain so god we just believe you bring healing to him in jesus name amen amen god bless you god bless you praise the lord i thank god for that testimony i mean sister nelly if you don't mind coming at this time we'll have her just share uh just what the lord had placed in her heart she says i i'm ready brother jack i got a testimony i said okay amen god bless you god bless you um it was so long ago my mind ain't long so i um there was an incident um something was did to me and i was it wasn't actually did to me i perceived it in a way and you know and we as christians sometimes we started acting like you know in my i never said anything but in my mind i had my righteous ignition had done rose up and i was telling somebody off in my mind it is truth and high good it's what it is all right uh and in my mind i'm just going on and on about you know do you know who i am and you know just just you know it was in my mind and uh it was before i went to work and usually you know if i get to work early before i get to work i'll sit in my car you know read a scripture whatever have you this particular morning that you know my little righteous indignation had done rose up and i got to work and i just opened up the bible and god had um when i turned opened up the bible it was just this scripture of everything i had done done had done brought me down so bad i say lord jesus help me so the testimony is that you have to be careful even in what even though you don't speak it when you run it through your mind if it's not christ-like you need to cast it down because we're coming to a time in a day well that we're going to start speaking things and if you can't handle the things you know you start thinking things because somebody did something wrong and you going off on them in your mind and it's bad when you start speaking things you're killing that person you're you're not prospering that person if if it's not good and it's not like christ we're not supposed to be doing it so the testimony is to be careful what you even think in your mind [Applause] lord for that uh god know how to bring it out at the right time i know exactly what he doing i just that that's that's that's that's all right that's all right um well let's uh just have a word of prayer and uh we'll prepare for uh dismissing on today and as uh brother quaker was saying and brother um josue just kind of picked it up we need to just be thankful for what the lord has done for us and that certainly was i i used to have to apologize to the preachers look you're going to be preaching and you're going to just be hearing this noise behind you but just keep preaching because we we with you we with you you know and it was just very very very disruptive you know to be in an environment like that but to come here and and it's almost like we came to a place where um we were by ourselves there was there is another church that meets and i think they meet a little earlier than us but they uh they were they've been here i think for about two years or maybe a little bit more and actually from what i heard they were five years in another school and then i came here for two and been here for two years so when i saw some of the saints coming they're like oh we got some people coming to visit got some people coming visits like no no we're not coming to visit we we having church over here too and uh you know but you you don't know why god has you coming but let's let's enjoy what we do have it's like a little sanctuary you know and and and brother joe sweet right brother troy got to step outside and and be y'all keep it down cause the preacher used to get up good up on us all the time and we all know how y'all like the fellowship you know and uh the preacher says man they just they just and he'd be winding up that's his you know for the baptist church you know all that come back when the preacher get the hole in his ear and start [Music] he winding up he ready to you know bring it home and and we come out we're gonna spoil the man so so so god knows god knows and uh and we're grateful so uh i i believe this is a season and uh just a page and all of our testimonies and when it's when it's been written it's going to be encouragement uh to somebody else so we want to endure it we want it and do it well we want to want to go through this season well let's go through faithful just as faithfully ever act yeah i want you to act man like you're going to act when god give us our place don't wait till you get there now start acting right now how you going to act there be faithful now and be faithful then right praise god so let's pray amen father we're grateful for this day that you've given us this time that we've been able to come and gather thank you for the word of god that has been spoken to us just as a mother and a father they know the baby before it's even born they've already discussed and given a name to that child they begin to call it by name child can't respond and understand at that time what what it is but lord that that same natural type goes to the spiritual before we were before we were formed in our mother's womb before we came forth in 16 elements on earth you knew us you knew god that you would call us to this place for such a time as this you know that we'd be fellowshipping together we'd be one body you knew all of that father and god how we can uh uh just rejoice in the fact god if you you knew that then you know all thanks and father we know that you have everything under control so i pray lord that you would bless amen our going out as you have blessed our coming in continue to bless for the kwaku and god his family and god just the different souls that were touched by him being there lord he went through so much just to get there but god he persevered and look at the the fruit of perseverance i pray god should bless the work that was done and lord i pray that you watch over the saints throughout this week that you would keep us until we come back together again on uh wednesday night and lord even just thinking how we've been talking there about walking worthy of the vocation uh that we have and here today our precious brother just walks right into that lord and just begin to tell us we all got something that we're called to do so let's walk worthy whatever god has called us
