[6:30] had a guest minister tonight and I did
[6:34] not um get word out to everybody as to
[6:37] who it was because this was one of those
[6:40] situations where
[6:43] um sometimes in the field of Boaz
[6:47] uh you'll get some blessings on purpose.
[6:52] Amen. They they they just dropped they

[7:04] kind of getting a head start on the
[7:06] meetings. You all know about Brother
[7:07] Bernard's meetings uh this this weekend,
[7:11] but I got contacted by uh Brother Aaron
[7:14] Ningo Maza and he said, "Brother, would
[7:17] you want a preacher for Wednesday
[7:18] night?" I said, "Let me try to get some
[7:20] things sorted out." And I said, "Yeah,
[7:21] we'll we'll we'll take it." And he says,
[7:23] "Okay, brother uh brother Jacosce will

[7:41] all for coming. Amen. Here at the Spirit
[7:44] and Truth Tabernacle. Amen. It's

[7:53] So, I won't take any more time. I want
[7:56] the pastor to come, the preacher to come
[7:59] and just uh have his own way. But let's
[8:02] stand and let's just sing. Amen. Just
[8:04] one chorus of Amazing Grace as he comes.
[8:10] Amazing
[8:12] grace, how
[8:15] sweet the
[8:17] sound that
[8:21] save a
[8:23] rich like
[8:26] me.
[8:28] Oh, I
[8:31] once
[8:33] was thinking
[8:36] [Music]
[8:38] found.
[8:40] [Music]
[8:50] God bless you everyone.
[8:53] So good to be here tonight with you and
[8:56] I would like
[8:58] to greet you all and to give you
[9:01] greetings from the church back home in
[9:05] England and also the church in Zimbabwe
[9:08] where I was a while ago. They all send
[9:11] their greetings to all of you. And I
[9:13] would like to thank also my precious
[9:16] pastor here for uh accommodating me to
[9:19] come also and just fellowship with you
[9:22] tonight. And I trust it will be a
[9:24] blessing. Amen. So without wasting much
[9:28] time, I'm going to invite you to bow
[9:30] your heads in a word of prayer. And if
[9:33] you have any special request tonight,
[9:36] God is still answering prayer. Amen.
[9:39] He's still in the business of healing
[9:41] the sick, providing our needs and
[9:45] fighting all our battles. God. So, God
[9:48] bless you. He sees your hands and he
[9:50] knows the need. Shall we pray? Gracious
[9:54] heavenly father, it's always our joy to
[9:56] come into your presence. We believe it's
[9:58] David who said one time, I was glad when
[10:01] they said unto me, let us go to the
[10:04] house of the Lord. We are so thankful,
[10:06] Father, for the songs that have been
[10:08] sung, warming and preparing our hearts
[10:10] for the coming word. Now, Lord, as we
[10:13] come to this most sacred part of the
[10:15] service, may you anoint your word,
[10:18] anoint your servant, anoint the ears
[10:22] that will be hearing, and grant them
[10:24] their heart's desires even as many as
[10:27] have raised up their hands. We thank you
[10:30] in advance in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
[10:34] Amen. Let's read in the book of
[10:36] Revelation chapter 3. A familiar
[10:39] scripture. Revelation chapter 3 from
[10:42] vers 14 to verse 18. The message to the
[10:47] loudian church age. Amen. Let's read
[10:52] there if we found it. Revelation chapter
[10:55] 3. I begin to read on verse 14. And unto
[11:01] the angel of the church of the loudians,
[11:04] write these things, said the amen, the
[11:07] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[11:10] of the creation of God. I know thy works
[11:13] that thou art neither cold nor hot. I
[11:16] would thou cold or heart. So then,
[11:19] because thou art lukewarm, and neither
[11:22] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[11:26] mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich
[11:28] and increased with goods, and have need
[11:30] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[11:33] art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
[11:36] and blind, and naked. I counel thee to
[11:41] buy off me gold, tried in the fire, that
[11:45] thou mayest be rich, and white
[11:48] raignment, that thou mayest be clothed,
[11:52] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[11:54] not appear. and anoint thine eyes with
[11:59] thyself that thou mayest see. The Lord
[12:02] blessed the reading of his word. You may
[12:04] be seated. I want to take my subject
[12:06] title from that last verse there on
[12:09] verse 18. I counsel thee to buy off me
[12:11] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[12:15] be rich and white reignment that thou
[12:17] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[12:20] thy nakedness do not appear. That last
[12:23] part there is what I want to highlight.
[12:26] And anoint thine eyes with eyesel that
[12:30] thou mayest see. Amen. I would like to
[12:34] speak on the Isel of spiritual
[12:38] revelation.
[12:40] The Isel of spiritual revelation. So
[12:46] laud this year as we've read here among
[12:48] many other things is called here blind
[12:52] and naked. Brother Brham in the message
[12:55] events made clear by prophecy says on
[12:59] paragraph
[13:01] 46 he has this to say. Now
[13:05] remember the Bible predicted that this
[13:09] ecclesiastical age of of loud uh of uh
[13:14] of this Ludician age was blind. They had
[13:18] him outside the church. There is not
[13:20] another age another church age that
[13:22] Jesus was on the outside but the Lord
[13:26] church age. He was on the outside trying
[13:28] to get back in. I stand at the door and
[13:32] knock. He's supposed to be inside. But
[13:35] he said because you say I'm rich,
[13:37] increased with goods, have need of
[13:39] nothing, and don't know that you are
[13:42] blind, leading the blind, poor spirit,
[13:46] wretched, miserable, naked, and don't
[13:48] know it. If a man was naked on the
[13:51] street, miserable, blind, and knew he
[13:54] had sense enough that they could tell
[13:57] him he was naked, he would try to do
[13:59] something about it. But when he shakes
[14:01] his head and says, "I won't have it. Who
[14:04] are you to tell me what to do? I know
[14:07] where I'm standing." Now, if that ain't
[14:10] a pitiful shape, I don't know. And
[14:13] that's exactly what the God of this
[14:16] Bible said that the church would be in
[14:18] in this evil age right now, in the last
[14:24] church age where we are living in. So
[14:29] blindness I guess is the worst of the
[14:31] conditions described here. All these
[14:34] things here are horrible, wretched,
[14:36] blind. But I think blindness there is is
[14:39] is is the worst of them.
[14:42] I would rather be hungry and see where I
[14:46] could try to get my next meal. Um
[14:49] because even if you were with something
[14:52] to eat, but yet you were blind, how are
[14:55] you going to see that food and get to
[14:58] where that food? So blindness is such a
[15:00] bad thing. But I've got good news for
[15:02] you that there is an eye
[15:05] serve spiritual revelation that takes
[15:09] care of the blindness of this age. We
[15:12] don't have to be blind. God says I
[15:15] cancel thee. I cancel thee. Don't remain
[15:20] in blindness. I've got some eyeself.
[15:23] I've got some spiritual revelation to
[15:26] make you know who you are. If you take
[15:29] this eyes off, it removes the amnesia
[15:32] and it makes you know who you are. Makes
[15:34] you know where you came from. Makes you
[15:37] know where you are going to and makes
[15:39] you stand your ground against every eel
[15:43] of the enemy.
[15:46] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the
[15:48] prophet goes on to say in the message
[15:50] God has a provided lamb on paragraph 16.
[15:54] He says, "You know, blindness is a
[15:57] horrible thing." Yeah. When I see a man
[16:01] blind, my heart goes out for him.
[16:05] But yet, I know of a blindness that's
[16:09] worse.
[16:11] Spiritual blindness.
[16:13] How God made men to visualize him. Amen.
[16:19] And they can do it. Wow. May God help us
[16:22] to visualize him. It's good we are
[16:25] seeing one another. It's good we can see
[16:27] around and walk around, but we need to
[16:29] see and visualize God. We must visualize
[16:33] your salvation. Visualize your healing.
[16:36] Visualize the promises of God that he
[16:40] has given for us in this day. There is
[16:42] no need for us to remain in misery, in
[16:45] shame, in a poor condition and wretched
[16:48] condition. God wants to anoint our eyes
[16:53] with the Isel of revelation
[16:56] to know who we are, where we came from.
[16:59] And we will not be able to know who we
[17:01] are unless we know who he is. Because
[17:05] when we know who he is, then he shows us
[17:08] who we are.
[17:10] When Peter said, "Thou art the Christ,
[17:13] son of the living God." Then it came
[17:16] back and thou art Peter. Yes, he was
[17:20] also told who he was after he identified
[17:24] who Jesus Christ was. And when you can
[17:26] acknowledge the word, that word will
[17:29] also show you your position in that
[17:32] word. And when you have a revelation of
[17:35] the message of this day, that message
[17:38] will also show you your place in that
[17:41] same message.
[17:43] Amen. So because Ludicia is lukewarm and
[17:46] blind and refuse help, God says, "I will
[17:50] spew thee out of my mouth." That means
[17:53] those who want to see, those who want to
[17:57] have the cure for loud this year must
[18:00] come out of her. In other words, just
[18:02] leave her alone because she's she's
[18:05] she's being spewed out. God is rejecting
[18:08] this church age of Latheia. God is
[18:10] ousting the Pentecostal churches. God is
[18:14] ousting the denominations. God is
[18:16] spewing out of his mouth the world's
[18:18] council of churches. So if you would
[18:20] like to see something, if you would like
[18:22] your eyes anointed with the high self,
[18:26] you have to come out of that and leave
[18:29] the blindsia alone. I believe it's in
[18:32] Jeremiah chapter 5 51 on verse 9 it says
[18:36] we would have healed Babylon but she's
[18:39] not healed forsake her and let us go
[18:43] everyone into his own country for her
[18:45] judgment reacheth unto heaven and is
[18:47] lifted up even to the skies and Jesus
[18:50] had the same to say about the
[18:53] ecclesiastical system of his day in
[18:55] Matthew 15 on verse 14 let them alone
[18:59] they be blind leaders of the blind. And
[19:01] if the blind lead the blind, they shall
[19:04] fall into the ditch. And in Revelation
[19:08] 18, we know there where Babylon was
[19:11] pronounced there that Babylon the great
[19:14] is fallen. On verse two, verse verse 4
[19:17] says, I heard another voice from heaven
[19:19] saying, come out of her, my people, that
[19:23] ye be not partakers of her sins, and
[19:25] that you receive not of her plagues. So
[19:29] there you are, saints. We have to come
[19:31] out of that system of blindness there.
[19:33] And I want to tell you tonight, I've got
[19:35] good news for you tonight. I've got
[19:37] something to encourage you tonight. God
[19:40] has a remedy to the blindness of this
[19:42] evil age.
[19:44] We don't have to remain blind. We don't
[19:47] have to have also partial sight. Some of
[19:51] us can see some things, but we don't see
[19:54] all things.
[19:56] We must see all things because Jesus has
[20:00] given us all things. He died that we
[20:03] might have all things because all things
[20:07] are possible to him that believes. Uh he
[20:10] died to save you. He died to heal you.
[20:14] He died to provide your needs. He died
[20:18] to fight all your battles. We don't want
[20:20] no partial sight. We want a clear vision
[20:25] of what God has in store for us even
[20:28] tonight.
[20:29] Amen. God wants us to see something. So
[20:33] he says the remedy is I cancelled thee
[20:36] among other things there. Of course the
[20:38] gold and everything else among other
[20:40] things I can anoint thine eyes with
[20:44] myself that you may see. So the eyes of
[20:48] here is the spiritual revelation of
[20:51] Jesus Christ personally to you. When you
[20:56] can see Jesus then you can see
[20:59] everything.
[21:00] When you know Jesus then you can know
[21:03] everything. You can navigate your way
[21:05] around everything because to know him is
[21:09] life. When you know him by revelation,
[21:13] he opens up every door in your life. So
[21:17] here we find the eyeself being the
[21:19] spiritual revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:22] personally to you. And those who accept
[21:25] this remedy of this self, they come out
[21:28] of that Babylon laia condition and they
[21:31] become members of his lovely bride. He
[21:35] anoints them with the eyes of of
[21:38] spiritual revelation which comes by the
[21:42] message of your day. The message of Noah
[21:46] was
[21:47] spiritual to the people of the days of
[21:50] Noah. Those who wanted to see the
[21:53] program of God and to escape the
[21:55] judgments of God, they were anointed by
[21:59] the message of the prophet Noah. It goes
[22:02] on and on. Every prophet that came his
[22:05] message was I self. When Moses came, his
[22:08] message was I serve. To the blindness of
[22:11] the Egyptian captivity. Those who wanted
[22:14] to come out had to come under the
[22:16] message of Moses. It was an anointing
[22:20] for them to be able to see the way over
[22:23] into the promised land. So here he
[22:27] anoints those who come out with the eyes
[22:30] of of revelation so that they may know
[22:34] him he who is coming to take them home.
[22:38] So our eyes as the bride have been
[22:41] opened by the eyeself of revelation.
[22:45] Amen. And the message of the hour is an
[22:48] eyeopener.
[22:51] It has opened our eyes. We now can see a
[22:54] lot of things. We now can understand a
[22:57] lot of things. The Bible has become a
[22:59] new book. Life has become worth living.
[23:03] Our marriages have become a blessing.
[23:06] Going to church has become a joy.
[23:08] Reading the Bible has become something
[23:11] enjoyable because the message of the
[23:13] hour is an eyeopener. You don't just
[23:16] read it as you are reading a magazine.
[23:18] You don't just read as if you're reading
[23:20] some newspaper. When you read the
[23:22] message thou or the Bible, you are
[23:24] actually reading the word of God. And
[23:28] when you read it under the light of the
[23:31] evening message, oh what an eyeopener it
[23:35] is. We begin to understand many
[23:37] principles of life. Many things of life
[23:41] we are now understanding them because
[23:43] the message of the hour is the eye
[23:45] opener. Hallelujah. You know when you
[23:48] are having the we have some bottles
[23:50] which have maybe some soda in them maybe
[23:54] cocoa wafanta lemonade in a bottle with
[23:58] a bottle top. You need a bottle opener
[24:02] to remove that that that little thing
[24:04] there. If you don't have a bottle
[24:06] opener, you will never enjoy that coke
[24:09] in there. And tonight I've got a bottle
[24:12] opener. That's the message of the Oh,
[24:14] hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, I feel
[24:17] good right now. I feel good right now.
[24:20] Somebody's eyes is being open. Amen. We
[24:23] haven't bottle open. The message of the
[24:25] hour opens our eyes to instant healing
[24:30] by the spoken
[24:31] word. Speak the word only and my
[24:35] daughter will live. Speak the word only
[24:39] and my servant will live. The message of
[24:41] the hour is an eye opener for instant
[24:45] healing, instant spoken word creation,
[24:49] instant miracle, instant paradox by the
[24:53] message of the hour. It's an eye open.
[24:55] And when you come in this message, you
[24:57] will never be the same again. You will
[24:59] never be the same again. The message of
[25:02] the hour is a game changer.
[25:11] Amen. Amen. That's for you tonight. It's
[25:15] a game changer. The message of the hour
[25:18] changes everything. It rearranges
[25:21] everything. It sorts out everything
[25:23] because no weapon, no
[25:26] weapon.
[25:28] Hallelujah. No weapon that is formed can
[25:32] ever prevail against the message. This
[25:36] message will defeat the devil anytime,
[25:40] any place, any condition, any
[25:43] circumstances. Hallelujah. Blessed be
[25:46] the name of the Lord. Amen. It's an
[25:50] eyes. It's an eye opener. Hallelujah.
[25:54] Yes. The message of the hour is the
[25:57] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[26:01] myself. That's why in Revelation chapter
[26:03] one on verse one, the Bible says there
[26:06] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:10] coming right at the end. So those who
[26:13] are going to receive that revelation
[26:15] will automatically be like him because
[26:17] he is unveiling himself so that we may
[26:21] be like him. So the hallelujah he's
[26:25] revealing himself so we may be like him
[26:28] as we take that word as we feast upon
[26:31] that word we are not feasting from a man
[26:34] we're not feisting from brother Bernham
[26:37] we are feasting from the body word of
[26:39] the son of God himself the son of man
[26:43] Jesus Christ and as we feed upon the
[26:46] revealed word our eyes are being open
[26:50] and we begin to change from glory Glory
[26:53] unto glory from victory unto victory
[26:57] from joy unto joy. Hallelujah. until we
[27:01] will be just like him to meet the
[27:04] rapture conditions. In the message and
[27:07] exposition of the church ages of the
[27:10] seven church ages um in the revelation
[27:13] of Jesus Christ the first part of it
[27:15] there in the church ages book he says
[27:17] now the Greek word for revelation is
[27:19] apocalypse which means unveiling. This
[27:23] unveiling is perfectly described in the
[27:25] example of a sculptor unveiling his work
[27:28] of statuary exposing it uh to the
[27:32] onlooker. It is an
[27:34] uncovering revealing what was previously
[27:38] hidden. Amen. Now the uncovering is not
[27:41] only the revelation of the person of
[27:44] Christ but it is the revelation of the
[27:46] his future works in the oncoming seven
[27:50] church ages. The
[27:52] importance of revelation
[27:55] by the spirit to a true believer can
[27:59] never be overemphasized.
[28:02] Revelations mean revelation means more
[28:06] to you than perhaps you realize.
[28:09] Remember your revelation is your
[28:10] victory. You will never live above what?
[28:14] Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Someone
[28:17] shout hallelujah. You will never live
[28:19] above what has been revealed to you. If
[28:22] it's revealed to you that God is a
[28:24] healer, you receive your healing right
[28:26] there and you refuse to be put under
[28:28] bondage by Satan. When you know who you
[28:31] are, when God opens your eyes, oh, one
[28:35] time Hagar was was was uh was was in big
[28:40] trouble there. You remember Hagar? and
[28:42] and and she was thirsty and and and and
[28:45] the child Ishmael was crying and and and
[28:48] Hagar just just left her. She couldn't
[28:51] just stand to see her son die like that.
[28:54] The Bible says God opened her eyes and
[28:57] that was her
[28:59] survival. That was his survival. When
[29:02] God opens your eyes, that is your
[29:06] survival. When God reveals something to
[29:09] you, revelation will keep you. Your
[29:12] revelation will see you through. Your
[29:14] revelation will fight all your battles.
[29:17] Hallelujah. Amen and amen. Amen and
[29:21] amen. This is beautiful here. Your
[29:23] revelation will protect you. Your
[29:25] revelation will see you through. Your
[29:28] revelation will fight for you. Your
[29:30] revelation will cut you. Your heart's
[29:32] desire. Your revelation will change you.
[29:37] Of course, what is what is faith? Faith
[29:39] is a revelation. So without faith you
[29:42] cannot please God. Without revelation
[29:44] you cannot please God. Isn't he
[29:46] wonderful?
[29:48] Blessed be his holy name. Yes.
[29:51] Revelation is meaning more to us than we
[29:53] ever think. So we find Paul way back in
[29:56] the first churches of uh Ephesus. He
[30:01] prays for the church to have the spirit
[30:06] of wisdom and revelation. way back in
[30:10] the beginning there and that revelation
[30:13] comes in fullness at the end.
[30:16] Hallelujah. Because the revelation of
[30:19] Jesus Christ ran as a mystery. Wow.
[30:23] Throughout the church ages, nobody knew
[30:26] exactly what was happening. They saw
[30:29] these things. They knew they were riders
[30:31] of of a white horse and riders of a of a
[30:35] black horse and a rider of a red horse
[30:37] and a rider of a of a pale horse. But
[30:40] nobody really understood what it was.
[30:44] But right in the end time when the
[30:46] revelation of Jesus Christ is complete,
[30:50] then comes the mighty angel with an open
[30:54] book with a rainbow over his head. And
[30:58] when he comes down, he cries with a loud
[31:02] voice as when a lion roarth. And when he
[31:05] cried, seven thunders after their
[31:08] voices. John was about to write there in
[31:11] the Ephesian church age. And the angel
[31:13] says, don't write this. This revelation
[31:17] comes as an isol in Laia to combat the
[31:22] blindness of Laia. As a remedy to the
[31:25] blindness of Laisha. It says the but in
[31:28] the days of the voice of the seventh
[31:30] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[31:33] mystery of God will be finished. So Paul
[31:36] in Ephesians let's go to Ephesians
[31:38] chapter 1. Let's find the apostle Paul
[31:41] here talking and praying for this spirit
[31:44] here this is self of spiritual
[31:47] revelation. Wherefore, Ephesians 1:15,
[31:51] wherefore I also
[31:54] um after I heard of your faith in the
[31:57] Lord Jesus, and love unto all the
[32:00] saints, I cease not to give thanks for
[32:04] you, making mention of you in my
[32:08] prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus
[32:12] Christ, the Father of glory, may give
[32:15] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[32:20] revelation in the knowledge of him.
[32:23] Watch it. The eyes of your
[32:25] understanding. Amen. Being enlightened.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:31] Being served. Enlightened. Anointed with
[32:35] self that you may know what is the hope
[32:38] of his calling and what the riches of
[32:41] the glory of his inheritance in the
[32:44] saints. So we find here now if we go
[32:47] back to Matthew Jesus wanted to test he
[32:51] wanted to find out the spiritual the
[32:55] spiritual condition of the people
[32:58] concerning his ministry. He wanted to
[33:01] find out whether people had had a
[33:04] knowledge whether they had wisdom
[33:06] whether they had a revelation of who he
[33:08] was. And in Matthew 16, Jesus on verse
[33:12] 13 when he came to the coast there of
[33:14] Cesaria Philippi, he said asked his
[33:17] disciples saying, "Whom do men say that
[33:20] I the son of man am?" And so some said
[33:25] that thou art John the Baptist, some
[33:27] Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the
[33:32] prophets. Then he says unto them, "But
[33:35] whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter
[33:38] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[33:40] the Son of the living God." And Jesus
[33:43] answered and said unto him, "Blessed art
[33:45] thou, Simon, but Jonaf, for flesh and
[33:46] blood has not revealed it unto thee, but
[33:49] my father which is in heaven." And I say
[33:53] unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this
[33:56] rock I will build my church. That rock
[33:59] of spiritual
[34:01] revelation, that rock of enlightenment,
[34:05] without your eyes being enlightened, God
[34:08] cannot build his church upon you. God
[34:11] cannot establish his kingdom in you
[34:14] until the eyes have been enlightened. So
[34:17] he says, "Upon this rock, I'll build my
[34:20] church and the gates of hell will not
[34:23] prevail." So there it is, church. The
[34:25] church is not built upon anything else.
[34:28] The church is built upon the Isel of
[34:31] spiritual revelation. If there is no
[34:35] Isel, there is no spiritual revelation.
[34:39] And if there is no spiritual revelation,
[34:42] there is no church. Amen. If there's no
[34:45] highel, there is no revelation. If
[34:47] there's no revelation, there's no new
[34:49] birth. It's a chain reaction. It is the
[34:52] opening of your eyes that really brings
[34:56] the new birth to you. So the father in
[34:59] heaven here revealed it to Simon as
[35:02] Jesus says my father flesh and blood has
[35:05] not done it but my father in heaven has
[35:07] revealed this to you. So that's how
[35:10] important the eyes of of spiritual
[35:12] revelation is. That's the rock
[35:14] foundation upon which the church is
[35:17] built.
[35:18] So the father opened the eyes of Simon
[35:21] Peter. He opened the eyes of his
[35:24] understanding by the spirit of wisdom
[35:27] and revelation. So Simon Peter became a
[35:31] wise man who built his house according
[35:36] to Matthew 7 upon a solid rock of
[35:40] revelation.
[35:42] That house will never fall. Hallelujah.
[35:47] A Christian confession, hallelujah,
[35:50] that's built upon spiritual revelation
[35:53] will never fail.
[35:56] A stand in this message here, a firm
[36:00] stand in this message built upon the
[36:03] isol of spiritual revelation will never
[36:06] fail. In Matthew 7, Jesus says,
[36:09] "Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[36:12] things of mine and doeth them, I will
[36:14] liken him unto a wise man, which built
[36:17] his house upon a rock, and the rain
[36:19] descended, and the floods came, and the
[36:22] winds blew, and beat upon the house, and
[36:25] it fell not, for it was founded upon a
[36:29] rock." Amen. And everyone who hears this
[36:32] saying and do with them, how can you do
[36:35] what's not revealed? Before you do, you
[36:37] need a revelation. And once it's
[36:39] revealed, then you do it because it
[36:41] becomes a you. Revelation in you becomes
[36:44] one.
[36:46] Amen. Whatever we do, it's revealed to
[36:49] us to do it. If it's not revealed, you
[36:51] cannot do it. So Jesus says, "If you do
[36:53] these sayings of mine here, I liken you
[36:55] to a man who built his house." And we
[36:58] are building our Christian houses of our
[37:01] Christian confession, our Christian
[37:03] lives. We are building upon the rock of
[37:06] spiritual revelation. It's a rock. It's
[37:09] a solid foundation. You know, many
[37:12] people nowadays are leaving the message
[37:14] and many people are finding fault with
[37:16] the message and many people are finding
[37:18] fault with the Bible and finding fault
[37:20] with Christ. And the reason of it all is
[37:22] they never really built their house upon
[37:26] that rock.
[37:28] When you have a revelation of who Jesus
[37:31] Christ is, you will never be separated
[37:35] from him. That's why the apostle Paul
[37:37] says, "What can separate us from the
[37:39] love of God?" He says, "Nothing can can
[37:41] tribulation, can peril, can the sword?"
[37:44] No. In all these things, we are more
[37:48] than conquerors. through him that loves
[37:52] us. So the foolish man built his house
[37:55] upon sinking sand. And when the troubles
[37:57] came, when the persecutions came, when
[38:00] the scoffers began to find fault with
[38:03] the message and find fault with this,
[38:05] that and the other, their house fell.
[38:08] But if your house is built upon the isol
[38:11] of spiritual revelation, it will stand
[38:14] forever. Now, who do men say I, the son
[38:17] of man, am? That was the question
[38:20] directed to the public. Who do men
[38:24] public out there? But we know Jesus is
[38:26] the seventh seal. Amen. Jesus is the
[38:30] word. Yes. He is the seventh seal and
[38:33] the seventh seal is a mystery and Jesus
[38:36] was a mystery. He came in a mysterious
[38:39] way. He was born of the Virgin Mary. It
[38:41] has never happened and it it will never
[38:43] happen. It has never happened. It will
[38:46] never happen that a virgin can conceive.
[38:49] It happened on Christ because there was
[38:51] a promise in Genesis of a woman's seed.
[38:54] So if for it to be a woman's seed, she
[38:56] had to be a virgin. And for her to to be
[39:00] a virgin, the product had to be the son
[39:02] of God because only God could then
[39:04] create the egg and and the seed in that
[39:08] womb there of a virgin. So here we find
[39:11] here we find Jesus was a mystery because
[39:14] he had a mysterious birth. He was born
[39:16] mysterious. He spoke mysterious. He did
[39:20] things in a mysterious way. Until the
[39:22] Bible says when some officers were sent
[39:24] to go and bring him and then they were
[39:27] asked, "Have you brought him?" All they
[39:30] could say is never men spake like this
[39:34] man. He said, "Are you also deceived? We
[39:37] told you to go get him, but you you are
[39:40] coming back praising him. That that that
[39:43] never a Pharisee spoke like like this
[39:45] man. Never a Sadducey spoke like this.
[39:48] And the Bible says there was a division
[39:50] among them. That's what the word will
[39:53] always do. That's what mysteries will
[39:55] always do. Mysteries will divide. Oh
[39:58] yeah. Oh yeah. Mysteries will divide.
[40:01] Division is by lack of revelation.
[40:05] By lack of the revelation. so many
[40:07] divisions among us. So they were divided
[40:11] and in the other scripture it says there
[40:13] after Jesus asked them what think of
[40:16] Christ? What's your revelation of
[40:18] Christ? Do you have the eyes of do you
[40:21] have the the spirit of wisdom and
[40:23] knowledge to know who I am? They said,
[40:25] "Oh, well, he's the son of David." You
[40:27] see, they wanted to to just shake him
[40:30] off of them. Christ is the son of David.
[40:32] So you see they didn't give a perfect
[40:34] answer because there was a greater
[40:36] father of Jesus
[40:39] than David but they say he's the son of
[40:41] David. So they could just say oh yeah
[40:43] he's the son of David. He comes in the
[40:45] line of David. So yeah he's the son of
[40:47] David. Joseph is of the is of David.
[40:49] Mary is of David. So he's just but there
[40:52] was something more of Jesus than just
[40:55] being the son. And Jesus then say to
[40:58] them, why then does David in the spirit
[41:02] call him Lord?
[41:05] If that was his son, why did David say
[41:08] the Lord, that's God, say unto my Lord,
[41:12] that's Jesus Messiah, sit on my right
[41:15] hand till I make thy your enemies thy
[41:18] foottool. And then it says from that
[41:22] person no man d ask him any other
[41:27] question. That's right. And he was a
[41:30] mystery. One time he says the son who
[41:34] came down from heaven who is now in
[41:38] heaven is the only one who knows about
[41:40] the father. No one has only me who was
[41:43] there who came here but who is still
[41:46] there. How could you come from there and
[41:49] be here and be there again? He was a
[41:52] mystery. He was a mystery. Amen. He was
[41:56] a mystery. Why would God choose a virgin
[41:59] that is engaged? Why? You see those
[42:02] first would say, "Hey, why? Which God is
[42:04] this? Who chooses a virgin that's
[42:07] already engaged to bring a holy child?
[42:10] Were there no virgins who are not
[42:12] engaged? When you use your mind there,
[42:14] you will completely be lost." He was God
[42:18] chose a virgin who was already engaged
[42:21] to make the others stumble. Wow. To make
[42:25] them think that that son was the son of
[42:27] Joseph. Wow. Because she was already
[42:30] engaged. Yet to the intellectual mind,
[42:33] no. A holy God, a holy God cannot choose
[42:37] somebody wife because if she's engaged,
[42:41] she's only somebody wife. They've
[42:43] promised. Why would God choose somebody
[42:45] why to be then the one to bring forth
[42:47] the son of God? It doesn't make sense to
[42:49] the intellectual mind. Jesus was not the
[42:52] Messiah. He was illegitimate. But he was
[42:56] a mystery. Amen. He had to be that. It
[43:01] had to be that way because in the flesh
[43:04] he had to be son of David. Yeah. Amen.
[43:08] So it must look like that's the son of
[43:10] Joseph.
[43:11] It must look like that's Joseph's baby.
[43:14] That's me. But it wasn't that. Mysteries
[43:18] look like there's something else. But
[43:20] that's not what it
[43:22] is. But that's why baptism is difficult
[43:26] to people because it looks like
[43:28] baptizing the name of the father and of
[43:31] the son and of the holy ghost. That
[43:33] looks more authentic from Jesus
[43:36] himself. Jesus himself. say, "Baptize in
[43:40] the name of the Father and of the Son
[43:42] and of the Holy Ghost." And it looks so
[43:45] plain. But you see, it's not as it
[43:48] looks. You must go deeper. You must look
[43:52] there with eyes that have been anointed
[43:55] with thyself, the thyself of spiritual
[43:58] revelation. Yes. I said Jesus was a
[44:01] mystery. and and and and and and and I
[44:04] think at one time when they spoke again
[44:06] about him, the Bible says, "And every
[44:09] man went to his own
[44:12] house." Hey, there was no fellowship
[44:15] after that service there. Every man went
[44:17] to his own house after Jesus just just
[44:21] just confused him when the service was
[44:24] over. Every man went to his own
[44:27] house. I like that scripture so much. I
[44:31] like the scripture so and I hope we will
[44:34] we will have some fellowship after
[44:36] service. We we don't want no man going
[44:39] to his own house here because why you
[44:42] guys are no longer a mystery. Uhhuh. You
[44:45] are no longer a mystery. You are
[44:47] revealed.
[44:48] Yes, you are revealed together with the
[44:51] book because the book was sealed and you
[44:54] were sealed together with the book. And
[44:57] when the book is being revealed, you are
[44:59] also revealed. You are a manifested son
[45:02] of God. Hallelujah.
[45:05] Isn't he wonderful? Blessed be the name
[45:08] of. So when he say to him here him, who
[45:10] do men say I? Because he was a mystery.
[45:13] So he he wanted to test their
[45:16] revelation of his mystery. I want now we
[45:20] we also become mysteries when we accept
[45:24] Christ. You see Christ was a mystery.
[45:26] Why? Because he was the son of a
[45:28] mysterious God. So a mysterious God will
[45:32] also give us a begotten son who was a
[45:35] mystery. And when that begotten son who
[45:38] is a mystery comes into you, you become
[45:42] a mystery as well. That's what we are.
[45:45] We are the mystery of Christ revealed.
[45:49] Amen. As Christ was the mystery of God
[45:54] revealed, now you the believers are the
[45:58] mystery of Christ revealed.
[46:02] Amen. At that day, you shall know that
[46:06] I'm in my father. My father is in me and
[46:09] I am in you. So the complete revelation
[46:13] of the mystery ends with this bride
[46:17] here. Exactly. showing the world who
[46:20] Jesus Christ is. Isn't this beautiful,
[46:22] church? What an adoption. What a
[46:25] privilege we have. Oh, now are we the
[46:30] sons of God? It doth not yet appear what
[46:33] we should be, but we know when he shall
[46:36] appear, we shall be like him. So he is
[46:40] asking these disciples here public
[46:43] opinion. Now I I said Jesus is a mystery
[46:47] and and and and and and Jesus is the
[46:50] seventh
[46:51] seal and the seventh seal was more
[46:54] mysterious than all the other seals in
[46:58] the symbols of the Bible. The first seal
[47:03] you could try to figure out what that
[47:06] white horse rider was. You could try to
[47:09] figure out what the red and people
[47:12] people really try. Some said not know
[47:15] that first horse there that is the Holy
[47:18] Spirit, you know, with the with the
[47:20] arrows of love conquering the world for
[47:24] Jesus. And it it could excite many for a
[47:27] while. But when the seven angels came,
[47:32] it was completely different. When the
[47:34] revelation came, that was the antichrist
[47:38] impersonating Christ who shall come on a
[47:41] white horse. But you see, he changed
[47:43] that white horse, jumped onto a red one.
[47:46] So you may forget all about it. But
[47:48] still that can that same bug changing
[47:53] its stages. G. So Jesus, the seventh
[47:58] seal was a mystery. Yes. Amen. Yes. And
[48:02] him being a mystery, he could not be
[48:06] understood. Right? Who do men say? Who
[48:10] does the public say I am? Uhhuh. He is
[48:13] not broken to the public. Amen. That's
[48:16] why the prophet says he revealed all the
[48:18] six the six seals. But the servant is
[48:21] not broke to the public. Amen. Until the
[48:25] time. Amen. The public could not know.
[48:28] They says, "Oh, he is Jeremiah." That's
[48:31] the public. Some say you are Isaiah.
[48:36] See, that's the general public there.
[48:39] But this is who do you?
[48:42] Amen. And so what do you think? What
[48:46] think he of Christ? Amen. What think he
[48:49] of Christ? Who son is he? Amen. He They
[48:52] should have said he is the son of the
[48:55] living God. Amen. There was a greater
[48:59] God than David. There was a greater
[49:02] father. I mean to say there was a
[49:04] greater father than David. Should have
[49:07] said he is the son of the living God.
[49:09] But they didn't want to acknowledge that
[49:11] because acknowledging that would mean
[49:13] they must repent and and so they weren't
[49:16] prepared to repent. They didn't want to
[49:17] accept that. So they just now listen the
[49:21] public will know nothing about what God
[49:24] has done in this day. Right. Amen.
[49:26] That's right. Exactly right. That's why
[49:28] you ask them, "Have you ever heard about
[49:29] William Brham?" Oh, yeah. He was he was
[49:31] a prophet. Yeah, he was a prophet. Yeah,
[49:34] he was a good man. He was a very good
[49:37] man. Oh, he was very humble. And those
[49:39] who met him, they said, "Oh, such a
[49:42] lovely presence always surrounded him."
[49:45] And they tell us, you know, he loved
[49:47] even his enemies. You could hardly tell
[49:49] who his friends were from his enemies.
[49:52] But that's where they end. Right? But to
[49:54] you and me, he was that promised Elijah.
[49:59] To you and me, he was that seventh
[50:02] angel.
[50:04] During the days of his ministry, the
[50:07] mystery of God was going to be finished.
[50:10] To you and me, it was that forunner
[50:15] of the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[50:18] Christ. And brothers and sisters, to the
[50:20] public, it remains a mystery. Amen. He
[50:24] remains a mystery. His life remains a
[50:26] mystery. But to us who have accepted
[50:30] the message, we have accepted the
[50:33] revealed word, it's no longer a mystery.
[50:38] But because we have accepted a mystery,
[50:40] we become mysteries to the world.
[50:43] That's why they will never understand
[50:44] us. You become a mystery to your people.
[50:48] You will become a mystery to your
[50:49] neighbors because you have Christ who is
[50:53] a mystery in you. So thou art s thou art
[50:57] the Christ. Okay. So we find Simon
[50:59] Peter's answer here by spiritual
[51:01] revelation expresses his
[51:05] wisdom and scriptural knowledge of who
[51:11] Jesus Christ was.
[51:15] Your
[51:16] revelation will show forth your
[51:21] wisdom and your knowledge
[51:25] of scripture. Amen.
[51:28] The way you were baptized, if you were
[51:30] baptized correctly with a revelation
[51:33] that the name of the father, son, and
[51:35] holy ghost is the lord Jesus Christ. If
[51:38] you acknowledge that, it means you have
[51:42] a precise, perfect, correct
[51:46] interpretation of scripture. You
[51:48] understand the Bible. There's the self.
[51:51] There's the opening of the eyes of your
[51:55] understanding. So, who do you say I am?
[51:59] Oh, they say you are you Jeremiah. you.
[52:01] No. If if a person thought Christ was
[52:05] Jeremiah, how could Christ save such
[52:08] one? Jeremiah was not a savior. So if
[52:12] someone thought Jesus was John the
[52:14] Baptist, he missed his salvation right
[52:17] there because John the Baptist was not a
[52:20] savior. You had to recognize him as the
[52:23] son of the living God, Jehovah Savior
[52:27] Jesus, for him to save you. Right. Amen.
[52:31] Amen. So your revelation will betray who
[52:35] you are and your comprehension of the
[52:38] scripture. Amen.
[52:40] Peter then said, "You are the Christ."
[52:44] Now watch, let's look at Peter's answer
[52:46] just for a moment. Peter says, "You are
[52:48] the Christ." Now we can say it was
[52:51] revealed to him, which is true. But do
[52:54] you know what? Revelation is not just
[52:56] some far-fetched thing.
[53:00] Let me tell you something. What did
[53:01] Peter say? You are the son of the living
[53:03] God. Was that something
[53:05] new? Was that something new? Was that
[53:08] the first time for us to be told he was
[53:10] the son of God? So where does revelation
[53:13] come
[53:14] in? Where does revelation come in?
[53:17] Gabriel told Mary when she says, "How
[53:20] can these things be seeing I know not a
[53:23] man?" What did the angel say? The Holy
[53:25] Ghost shall come over you. The power of
[53:28] the highest shall overshadow you. And
[53:30] that holy thing that shall come forth
[53:34] will be called the son of God.
[53:39] That is scripture. Yes. That's scripture
[53:42] now. Yes. And and Peter could have said
[53:46] to Jesus, "Lord, you want me to tell you
[53:49] who you are? Just give me a moment. M
[53:53] let me go and uh ask Mary your mother
[53:57] what what what the angel uh
[54:00] told told her.
[54:03] He could have just gone to him and said
[54:04] Mary by the way what did the angel say
[54:07] this son was going to be oh the son of
[54:09] the living God say yeah you are the son
[54:11] of the living God. So that revelation
[54:14] was not just something from the blue
[54:17] that you are just uttering something and
[54:19] say it's revealed. No, revelation is a
[54:23] perfect understanding of the scripture.
[54:26] Revelation is backed up by the
[54:28] scripture. His answer was already the
[54:31] scripture from Genesis woman seed from
[54:34] Isaiah virgin birth born. The angel
[54:38] himself says son of God and Peter says
[54:41] thou art the Christ son of the living
[54:44] God. So his revelation revealed or
[54:49] expressed his wisdom, his knowledge and
[54:53] the correctness of his comprehension of
[54:57] the scripture. Let me bring this to an
[55:00] ending. So I want you to notice here
[55:02] that revelation if you say you have a
[55:06] revelation of the original sin. It means
[55:08] that you have the precise correct
[55:10] understanding and knowledge of the
[55:13] scriptures concerning what happened in
[55:16] the beginning in Eden. And if you say
[55:19] you have the revelation of the oneness
[55:22] of the godhead, you have it clearly that
[55:24] Jesus was God and the last day church
[55:27] the bride will also be a part of that
[55:31] deity. All right? You are telling us
[55:34] that you understand the scriptures
[55:35] correctly. So it's not just a revelation
[55:38] of something just comes which cannot be
[55:40] backed up by scripture. And if you say
[55:42] you were baptized correctly, you got a
[55:44] revelation of being baptized in the name
[55:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ. What you are
[55:49] telling me is you understand Matthew
[55:52] 28:18 correctly. You understand that
[55:55] father is not a name. You understand you
[55:58] have knowledge. You have you have
[56:00] received eyes of you. The eyes of your
[56:04] understanding have been opened and
[56:06] lightened to know that father is not a
[56:09] name, son is not a name. So when you say
[56:12] I got a revelation, I say to you that's
[56:14] an expression of your wisdom, knowledge,
[56:17] and understanding of the scriptures.
[56:20] Amen. Glory. Amen.
[56:23] Amen. Praise God. That's why the Bible
[56:26] says in James 15, if any of you lack
[56:28] wisdom, let him ask of God who gives it.
[56:33] And you remember those men who were
[56:35] going to a mouse, their eyes in Luke 24
[56:39] were holden that they should not know
[56:42] him. Then at the time appointed, God
[56:45] opened their eyes. They spend the whole
[56:48] day walking with him without an
[56:50] understanding. But in the evening time,
[56:53] it shall be light. And here we are in
[56:55] the evening time, church. Our eyes have
[56:59] been open and we can see and know who
[57:03] God is. So revelation is the correct
[57:06] understanding and knowledge of the word
[57:10] and that brings the new birth. So these
[57:14] things are hidden from those who are
[57:16] wise. Remember how in Acts chapter 8
[57:19] that that that that man there who was
[57:22] going the Ethiopian unic there and and
[57:25] Philip was told by the Holy Ghost to
[57:26] join himself and he says understand thou
[57:30] what thou readest? You are reading
[57:32] something there but do you have eyes? Do
[57:36] you have a revelation? Do you
[57:37] understand? He says how can I? He was so
[57:41] specific. How can I except some
[57:45] man explains it to me? And many times we
[57:49] read the Bible, we don't even
[57:51] understand. We read the message, listen
[57:53] to a tape, we don't understand. And
[57:56] let's be honest and say, how can I
[57:58] understand the message of Christ's
[58:01] mystery of God unless someone explains
[58:04] it to me? God give me a minister to
[58:07] preach on this and expound on it by the
[58:09] same anointing which was upon the
[58:12] prophet. God, you remember how Gazi also
[58:16] could not see the armies of the of of
[58:20] the Lord and he saw the Syrians and oh
[58:23] Elisha prayed in 2 Kings on chapter 6
[58:27] and verse 17. I pray he open the eyes of
[58:32] the young man that he may see. And when
[58:34] his eyes were open, he saw the mountain
[58:39] full of horses and chariots of fire. And
[58:44] I want you to know right now, the angels
[58:46] of God are camped right around you.
[58:50] The blessings of God are surrounding
[58:53] this place here. If God could open our
[58:56] eyes, we would be surprised.
[59:00] Amen. in the message the anointed ones.
[59:03] Let me just bring a few quotes and then
[59:05] close here. He says on the anointed ones
[59:08] is speaking about Cain and Abel how that
[59:12] one was received and one was condemned
[59:16] and he says it was revelation. So I I I
[59:20] start on 67. He's now coming to Simon.
[59:23] He says, "Blessed art thou Simon, son of
[59:25] Jonas. Flesh and blood never revealed
[59:27] this to you. My father which is in
[59:29] heaven has revealed it and upon this
[59:32] rock I'll what? Build my church. He says
[59:37] what the true revelation of the
[59:44] word. It's not just something which is
[59:46] unscriptural.
[59:48] You cannot just say I have a revelation
[59:51] to preach when you are a
[59:57] woman and say I have got a revelation to
[1:00:00] preach. Like I remember talking to
[1:00:03] somebody that I knew and I was trying to
[1:00:05] tell them you mustn't preach. He says I
[1:00:08] don't care what you say Joseph if God
[1:00:10] tells me to preach I'm going to preach.
[1:00:12] I said preach
[1:00:14] on. I said preach on. I said, "But you
[1:00:17] also preach on that scripture which
[1:00:19] says, I suffer not a woman to
[1:00:22] preach." Oh, I'll never forget. I'll
[1:00:25] preach on. I said, "Yeah, preach
[1:00:28] on the true revelation of the word." He
[1:00:32] says, "There is the true vine." 68
[1:00:35] paragraph. What is faith? Faith is
[1:00:37] something that's revealed to you. It's
[1:00:39] not yet, but you believe it will be.
[1:00:41] Faith is the revelation of the will of
[1:00:45] God.
[1:00:47] 70 Jesus said, "Except you believe that
[1:00:50] I am he, you will die in your sins." You
[1:00:54] know that Jesus told them that unless
[1:00:58] you believe that I am he, you're going
[1:00:59] to die in your sins. Why? Because they
[1:01:02] would be void. They will be void of a
[1:01:06] revelation having no knowledge, no
[1:01:08] wisdom of who he is. Their eyes are
[1:01:11] blind. They have not been anointed with
[1:01:14] high self. They just don't know who he
[1:01:16] is, they are going to die. A person who
[1:01:18] thought Jesus was Jeremiah was going to
[1:01:21] die in their sins. A person who thought
[1:01:24] he was John the Baptist was so he says
[1:01:26] here and and except you believe I'm
[1:01:29] here, you will die in your sins. He is
[1:01:31] the revelation of God, the spirit of God
[1:01:34] revealed in human form. You can't if you
[1:01:38] can't believe that you are lost.
[1:01:40] Amen. Christ's mystery of God revealed
[1:01:44] as I read this last quotation to you.
[1:01:47] What is the new birth? Then you' say,
[1:01:51] well, Brennham, what is the new birth?
[1:01:53] It is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] personally to you. Not because you
[1:02:00] joined a church or you shook a hand or
[1:02:02] you done something different or you say
[1:02:04] a decreed, you promise to leave a god of
[1:02:07] rules. But Christ, the
[1:02:10] Bible, he is the word that was revealed
[1:02:14] to you. And no matter what anybody says,
[1:02:18] what takes place is Christ, pastor,
[1:02:20] priest, whatever it might be is Christ
[1:02:23] in you. That is the revelation that the
[1:02:27] church is built upon
[1:02:30] until 40. The new birth is Christ is a
[1:02:36] revelation that God has revealed to you
[1:02:38] this great mystery. And that's the new
[1:02:41] birth. Then he says, "What are you going
[1:02:43] to do when you get all that group
[1:02:46] together where the revelation is
[1:02:49] perfectly in harmony? God expressing it
[1:02:52] through his word by the same actions and
[1:02:55] the same things that he did making the
[1:02:58] word manifest." He says, "Oh, if the
[1:03:02] church only knew its position, it will
[1:03:06] one day, then the rapture will go when
[1:03:12] it knows what it is."
[1:03:15] and on 304. By lack of this
[1:03:19] revelation is why we have so many
[1:03:24] different divisions among us and so much
[1:03:29] mockery, so much division among us is
[1:03:32] because the people lack that revelation.
[1:03:35] They lack that revelation. The teachers,
[1:03:39] may God bless you. It has been a joy
[1:03:40] speaking to you. I hope and trust that
[1:03:42] you have been blessed.
[1:03:45] And
[1:03:47] um more than being blessed, I hope and
[1:03:50] trust that the eyes of your
[1:03:52] understanding have been enlightened
[1:03:56] for you to know God is real.
[1:04:00] You know, the Bible says, "No weapon
[1:04:02] that's formed against you shall
[1:04:03] prosper." As I stand here, I stand as a
[1:04:07] testimony to that.
[1:04:11] No weapon that is formed against you,
[1:04:14] Amen, will ever prosper. On the 18th or
[1:04:19] 19th of June last
[1:04:21] year, 2024, I would have just
[1:04:25] died. I was involved in a traffic
[1:04:29] accident which was so
[1:04:32] horrific. Uh, if I show you the picture
[1:04:35] of the vehicle, you will wonder that
[1:04:39] somebody came out
[1:04:41] alive. It was a head-on collision with a
[1:04:45] vehicle which did not have enough
[1:04:48] lights. So, I never saw it until I was
[1:04:50] there. It was too late to try to avoid.
[1:04:53] rammed into him and my car turned that
[1:04:56] way, rolled three times, landed on the
[1:05:01] roof and I
[1:05:04] was almost out for some five or so
[1:05:08] minutes. I didn't know where I was. I
[1:05:10] had three passengers in that
[1:05:12] vehicle. None of us had a bone broken.
[1:05:20] Hallelujah. No weapon that is formed
[1:05:23] against you should proceed.
[1:05:26] Uh it's so amazing because when the car
[1:05:29] landed on its roof, I was now upside
[1:05:31] down and I didn't know what was
[1:05:33] happening. The head was down, the feet
[1:05:35] were up. So I got injured a bit on my
[1:05:38] head there and so I was bleeding. I
[1:05:40] didn't know how bad it was, whether it
[1:05:43] had damaged my skull, whatever. I didn't
[1:05:45] know. But all I knew, I couldn't help
[1:05:47] myself. And I was just like almost like
[1:05:49] like I passed out for five or seven
[1:05:52] minutes and then somebody lifted up my
[1:05:56] head and then I felt like that's when I
[1:05:59] came back to myself. If I had remained
[1:06:02] in that position I would have chocked
[1:06:04] myself to death almost. So I just did
[1:06:06] that and then I was like okay what has
[1:06:10] happened? So I looked at the car said
[1:06:12] whose whose car is this? They said
[1:06:15] that's your that's your car there. I
[1:06:17] said you don't tell me that's my car.
[1:06:18] What has happened? Says accident. So I
[1:06:21] was almost just so they quickly rushed
[1:06:23] me at least you know to the hospital and
[1:06:26] I was admitted and and you know I stand
[1:06:28] here as a miracle.
[1:06:30] A living miracle.
[1:06:33] I'm telling you the truth. God still
[1:06:36] lives. God still. You know what? You
[1:06:41] know I I don't know whether there's a
[1:06:43] way for you just to see the picture
[1:06:44] there of the car. I've got it here on my
[1:06:47] phone. I don't know whether that is
[1:06:48] possible. The time is gone there. But I
[1:06:50] mean, if you see that picture and see
[1:06:53] the rack of it, that vehicle was
[1:06:55] completely a write off. They could not
[1:06:59] repair it or anything. It just
[1:07:02] completely was a write off. And yet I
[1:07:05] was not a write off. Hallelujah.
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:12] Glory to God. Hallelujah. That goes to
[1:07:16] show if God has a work for you to
[1:07:19] do, nothing will happen to you. The
[1:07:22] devil will do nothing to you. He will
[1:07:25] keep you. Well, God bless you, saints.
[1:07:28] We sing a little song back home there.
[1:07:31] Can't you
[1:07:32] see
[1:07:34] why I'm so happy?
[1:07:39] I've
[1:07:41] accepted the
[1:07:43] word of the
[1:07:45] Lord. God bless you. Says that thy
[1:07:50] revealed
[1:07:51] word that was
[1:07:56] spoken by the
[1:07:59] prophet of
[1:08:02] Malachi
[1:08:04] 4. Can't you see? Can't you see?
[1:08:09] Why, brother Simba, I'm so
[1:08:13] happy I've
[1:08:16] accepted the word of the
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:32] Lord by the
[1:08:36] prophet of man.
[1:08:42] 4. Somebody give the Lord a hand of
[1:08:45] praise.
[1:08:48] [Applause]
[1:08:51] Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:53] Thank God.
[1:08:56] I thank God. I thank
[1:08:58] God. Brother uh Jacosi was saying, "This
[1:09:03] message is like a bottle opener.
[1:09:09] You cannot enjoy the contents of what's
[1:09:12] inside the bottle unless you have
[1:09:14] something to open it.
[1:09:16] And uh and there were many that could
[1:09:18] not enjoy the contents of what was
[1:09:20] written in
[1:09:21] scripture until the message came and and
[1:09:25] open up this understanding, this
[1:09:28] revelation. So many things that we get a
[1:09:30] chance to uh fellowship around because
[1:09:34] we're looking through a prophetic lens.
[1:09:36] Amen. And uh as God has sent his prophet
[1:09:38] and and as he said, we're feasting on
[1:09:40] the full body uh word of the Lord. And
[1:09:43] there's many people they and and and
[1:09:45] I've I've had it happen many of times.
[1:09:47] Why why y'all quote brother Brandham?
[1:09:48] Why y'all quote brother Brandham? Seem
[1:09:50] like y'all make it seem like he's
[1:09:52] greater than Christ. No, you just
[1:09:54] misunderstand.
[1:09:56] Once you get the eyes south, you'll
[1:09:59] understand what is going on. But we're
[1:10:02] not lifting him up above Christ because
[1:10:04] we are quoting, you know, quoting from
[1:10:07] him. But if you just look at what we're
[1:10:08] saying that he said, then you'll see
[1:10:11] that he's actually bringing us an
[1:10:12] understanding of the scripture, right?
[1:10:14] Cuz any any theologian can go grab a
[1:10:17] scripture and and just throw something
[1:10:18] out there at you, but we really want to
[1:10:20] know what is being said. Hallelujah. And
[1:10:24] it's only through that prophetic lens
[1:10:26] we'll see it. So, thank God for the word
[1:10:28] tonight. Appreciate you, brother
[1:10:29] Chacosi.
[1:10:33] Amen. Um they're they're working on
[1:10:37] getting that picture uh for you all to
[1:10:39] see the the action. And I heard the um a
[1:10:43] portion of that testimony and um I heard
[1:10:46] that you weren't preaching for a little
[1:10:48] bit there, Brother Jacos. Is that right?
[1:10:50] I I I rested after that. One month I was
[1:10:55] under at least hospital care but after
[1:11:00] that I just took a rest. Okay. Though I
[1:11:02] could I
[1:11:05] okay? The first month I was uh I was
[1:11:08] still being treated. I had I I I I had a
[1:11:11] very bad wound on the hand but it it
[1:11:13] healed after one month.
[1:11:17] Praise God.
[1:11:22] And as he was saying that if you know
[1:11:24] God's not finished with you, uh you're
[1:11:27] not going anywhere no matter how bad the
[1:11:29] accident is. And and it took me back to
[1:11:32] that little thought that I heard uh
[1:11:34] brother Trescende say. He said, "Your
[1:11:36] purpose is your
[1:11:39] protection. Your purpose is your
[1:11:42] protection." Praise God. God had
[1:11:44] purpose. So Amen. They'll just There's
[1:11:47] um uh the picture there.
[1:11:52] So, I was just sitting right there.
[1:11:54] That's that's the driver's uh that's
[1:11:56] just the driver's uh seat door right
[1:11:59] there. Right there. So, this car was
[1:12:01] coming this way. Rammed into here. My
[1:12:03] door is right there and and and and and
[1:12:06] so I don't even know how. So, it smashed
[1:12:08] this window. Uh that's after, of course,
[1:12:10] they tilted it up now, but it was like
[1:12:13] upside down. So, this window was smashed
[1:12:15] that. So, that's where I was brought out
[1:12:18] through that window there. And and
[1:12:20] that's the other when it was still
[1:12:21] upside down. That's the other side. I
[1:12:24] was on on the other side there of that
[1:12:26] car there. Um I think there is even
[1:12:29] another one there. There it is there. So
[1:12:31] you can see there uh this wheel here was
[1:12:34] was removed completely. This the the
[1:12:37] wheel on my side cuz I was I was right
[1:12:40] there. They couldn't open that door.
[1:12:42] They had to just force it after I was
[1:12:46] really taken to the hospital. But that's
[1:12:48] that's how bad it was. Yeah, it was bad.
[1:12:51] But go but God is good. That was bad,
[1:12:53] but God is good.
[1:12:55] [Applause]
[1:13:00] Amen.
[1:13:01] And he walked from there to here tonight
[1:13:04] to preach to us. So
[1:13:08] God is a good God.
[1:13:11] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:14] I I and I know anybody that's ever been
[1:13:17] in any type of accident, you uh you kind
[1:13:20] of go back to some of the things that
[1:13:22] you went through and and how God watched
[1:13:24] over you and how God protected you and
[1:13:27] Amen. And it could have been another
[1:13:31] way. But
[1:13:36] God. Oh,
[1:13:39] hallelujah. But God. But God. But God.
[1:13:43] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We thank the
[1:13:47] Lord. Amen. Let me get uh tonight's uh
[1:13:50] announcements so we could um give you
[1:13:54] that. So, um Sunday uh will be here at
[1:13:59] church. Prayer time starts at 9:00. It's
[1:14:02] an hour of prayer from 9 to 10:00. Uh
[1:14:05] there's Sunday school uh going from 9:30
[1:14:08] to 10:00. And we have both the young
[1:14:11] young the youth and the young adults.
[1:14:13] And our young adults have started a
[1:14:15] journey through uh the church ages. And
[1:14:18] if there's uh anyone that would like to
[1:14:21] join them, uh feel free to do so. We
[1:14:24] have ages 13 to 20, but um this this
[1:14:27] journey through the church ages is
[1:14:28] something that's going to go beyond a
[1:14:30] year. Uh it's kind of reading in the
[1:14:32] church age book for you know you have
[1:14:34] like homework assignments where you read
[1:14:35] a couple pages and you have to answer a
[1:14:37] few questions but it helps you get a
[1:14:39] little deeper uh understanding of of the
[1:14:42] word of the Lord. Um as I as you know
[1:14:45] brother Chakoshi was just just preaching
[1:14:47] tonight I was just thinking you got to
[1:14:50] love this word. You got to fall in love
[1:14:53] with this word. And I mean when you
[1:14:55] really fall in love with this uh it it
[1:14:58] means more than life to you right. But
[1:15:00] uh but but it just means so much when
[1:15:03] you when you get a true understanding of
[1:15:04] what God is doing. Uh but but we want to
[1:15:07] invite you to be a part of that if you
[1:15:08] desire. Uh also our streaming continues
[1:15:11] through Facebook SAT tabernacle and then
[1:15:13] also our church website uh
[1:15:16] john423.org. Uh we have a upcoming youth
[1:15:20] service on Friday, April 11th. That's
[1:15:22] going to be at 7:30 p.m. And uh also we
[1:15:27] have a Good Friday service that's coming
[1:15:29] up. Uh that's going to be April 18th at
[1:15:32] 7:30 p.m. We're going to do Good Friday
[1:15:34] service. And um don't forget this
[1:15:37] weekend we have the meetings for brother
[1:15:40] uh Bernard. And uh you actually just
[1:15:43] heard one of the preachers uh that's
[1:15:46] going to be preaching for brother
[1:15:47] Bernard this this weekend. And uh and I
[1:15:50] know uh brother Mike uh from Rapture in
[1:15:53] Faith. Amen. The pastor at Rapture and
[1:15:55] Faith, he'll be speaking as well. So uh
[1:15:57] let's continue to pray for the meetings
[1:15:59] that God would just move in a
[1:16:00] supernatural way uh there uh for the
[1:16:03] saints that'll be gathered together. Um
[1:16:06] I know the services are Friday night, um
[1:16:09] Saturday morning and uh Saturday night.
[1:16:13] Uh and then they have their regular
[1:16:14] Sunday morning service. So, uh, my plan
[1:16:18] for Friday night, brothers on the setup,
[1:16:20] want to try to come early to get
[1:16:22] everything set up that way, uh, those of
[1:16:25] us that want to go down on Friday night
[1:16:26] to be a part of the service, we can go
[1:16:28] on Friday night to do that. So, uh,
[1:16:31] we'll come early. We have our meetings
[1:16:33] that'll be hosted at Palm Beach Gardens
[1:16:35] High School July 25th through 27th. And
[1:16:39] our theme is I will restore, sayeth the
[1:16:42] Lord. And uh if you were listening
[1:16:44] closely, uh brother Chakosi start going
[1:16:48] down that path of that palmer and
[1:16:50] cankerorm. Uh he he hit him tonight. He
[1:16:53] was tying it right into the uh the white
[1:16:56] horse riding, the red horse rider, and
[1:16:59] uh the black horse riding. Then all
[1:17:01] three colors get mixed together, become
[1:17:03] pale. Uh only a prophet could tell us
[1:17:06] these things.
[1:17:08] Only a prophet could tell us these
[1:17:10] things. and you know and it's just so
[1:17:12] much in there. Lord have mercy. I I
[1:17:15] sometimes I just I I have to try to
[1:17:18] contain myself. But you recently I was
[1:17:20] just sharing with some brothers um uh
[1:17:23] brother Brandham actually because there
[1:17:26] are things that people are looking for.
[1:17:28] They think it's a future work and don't
[1:17:31] even realize that many of these things
[1:17:33] have already happened. And the prophet
[1:17:35] was as as as the revelation continued to
[1:17:38] unfold to him, he would share more and
[1:17:41] more and more with us. And and what you
[1:17:43] have to do is you uh uh you have to
[1:17:46] follow him, you know, uh follow that
[1:17:48] trail and you just can't stop at one
[1:17:50] sermon because God might open up a
[1:17:51] little bit more and then he'll come out
[1:17:52] and preach that, right? Uh so uh but one
[1:17:55] of the things that he said, he said that
[1:17:59] uh first he said all the trumpets
[1:18:00] sounded underneath the sixth seal.
[1:18:03] That's what he said. He said all the
[1:18:04] trumpets sounded underneath six seal.
[1:18:06] And then he said the sixth trumpet
[1:18:08] happened during the time of Ikeman and
[1:18:13] Hitler. So there is some that's waiting
[1:18:15] for something to happen in the future
[1:18:18] and then just completely missed that. He
[1:18:20] said it already happened and and what we
[1:18:23] didn't get cuz he he actually made
[1:18:25] statements. He said uh these things were
[1:18:27] happening at the same time. He used
[1:18:29] language like that. So there was a a
[1:18:31] simultaneous happening, right? You have
[1:18:34] seals being unfolded. You have uh uh
[1:18:36] church ages being unfolded. And you have
[1:18:38] these these these trumpets being
[1:18:40] unfolded. Everything happening at the
[1:18:42] same time. We got a message
[1:18:45] y'all. We got a rich message. Very very
[1:18:49] rich. But we thank God for it for this.
[1:18:51] But we uh we'll be hosting the I will
[1:18:53] restore the Lord July meetings. Uh you
[1:18:57] all know brother Wesco used to host the
[1:18:59] meetings in July and uh we just felt to
[1:19:02] pick it up and keep it going. The Lord
[1:19:04] used to do mighty things here in this
[1:19:06] area and brother Chakosa used to be a
[1:19:08] speaker you know at some of those
[1:19:09] meetings sometime but we're picking this
[1:19:12] up and we're going to keep going you
[1:19:14] know with it as the Lord would allow us
[1:19:16] uh to do so. So uh we look forward to
[1:19:18] that. Our giving it happens multiple
[1:19:22] ways. Um for those online uh we have
[1:19:25] Zale, PayPal and Cash App, but the
[1:19:27] preferred measure method is Zel. Um um
[1:19:31] we know that others don't everybody
[1:19:33] doesn't have that. So we do have PayPal
[1:19:35] and Cash App. And if you use Zel or
[1:19:36] PayPal, the uh address that you use is
[1:19:39] giving
[1:19:40] atj423.org. If you use cash app, uh it's
[1:19:43] dollar sign spirit and trutht. But
[1:19:44] PayPal and cash app, they do take fees.
[1:19:46] So that's why we encourage you if you
[1:19:48] can use zel. Our mailing address is on
[1:19:50] the bottom of the screen for those that
[1:19:52] want to mail in an offering. Those that
[1:19:53] are in the sanctuary, you have those
[1:19:56] methods that you can use as well as you
[1:19:58] have a wooden box in the back that you
[1:20:00] can use. It's when we come in or go out,
[1:20:03] you can use that box for your giving.
[1:20:05] Amen. That's all we have for tonight. Is
[1:20:07] there
[1:20:11] no no Saturday morning? So, it's just
[1:20:13] Friday night. Saturday.

[1:20:32] morning. Well, why ain't no church going
[1:20:34] on? Thank you for for for for opening
[1:20:37] our eyes. We got some
[1:20:40] is Praise
[1:20:43] God. Amen. All right. Well, um we will
[1:20:48] prepare to dismiss. Amen. On tonight and
[1:20:52] um we'll be back on Sunday morning here.
[1:20:55] But again, those of you that can make it
[1:20:56] to the services this weekend in Miami,
[1:20:59] we encourage you to do so. Let's pray.
[1:21:03] Father, we're grateful
[1:21:06] uh for this special blessing that you
[1:21:08] gave us here tonight. We thank you for
[1:21:11] your word. Your manservant has come Lord
[1:21:15] just to deliver a thought uh to us and
[1:21:18] we can appreciate the
[1:21:20] Iself of spiritual
[1:21:23] revelation God. It it is a it it settles
[1:21:27] us. It uh uh assures us. It puts us in a
[1:21:31] place Lord where we know where we're
[1:21:33] standing. And and as uh the minister
[1:21:36] said tonight, when we when we have that
[1:21:38] gates of hell can't prevail against
[1:21:40] that. uh there there's many things that
[1:21:43] would come against it. Uh we'll see uh
[1:21:46] so much in our life, but when we have
[1:21:48] it, it settles us. We don't we don't
[1:21:50] walk around with the same type of
[1:21:51] questions uh because there's just
[1:21:54] something in our heart. God and and and
[1:21:57] I know that there are times where the
[1:21:59] believers may feel a little bit like
[1:22:02] Peter when Jesus said, "Unless you eat
[1:22:05] my flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:22:08] part uh with me." and and and maybe
[1:22:12] there were there were many that heard
[1:22:14] these statements and said, "This man is
[1:22:15] a cannibal. There's something wrong with
[1:22:17] him. There's a a mystery, you know,
[1:22:20] around him." And and as they maybe
[1:22:22] looked at Peter and Peter, they asked
[1:22:24] him, "Are you going to go to Peter? Cuz
[1:22:27] we can't take this. We we got to go
[1:22:28] back." And when Peter was asked the
[1:22:31] question, will you go? My my my my what
[1:22:34] a revelation Peter had. To whom shall we
[1:22:38] go? Only you have the words of eternal
[1:22:42] life. And God, sometimes we can't
[1:22:44] explain everything, but we know we're
[1:22:46] not going anywhere because this is where
[1:22:48] we have received life. This has been a
[1:22:51] game changer for our lives. And God,
[1:22:55] we're grateful for that. We have been
[1:22:58] blessed by uh the the word in this hour.
[1:23:01] So, Father, we pray that as we prepare
[1:23:03] to leave this place that we would go and
[1:23:07] uh Lord, just just meditate and think on
[1:23:09] you. have fellowship around your word,
[1:23:11] encouraging and strengthen one another.
[1:23:13] Uh we pray for your servant, brother,
[1:23:16] brother brother Jacosce, Lord, as he
[1:23:18] prepares for the services this weekend,
[1:23:22] uh the meeting, Lord, coming forth with
[1:23:24] at brother Bernard's. Pray that the
[1:23:25] spirit of God would move in a very
[1:23:27] special way. Uh bless the saints as they
[1:23:30] gather and Lord, may the Holy Spirit
[1:23:32] have preeminence uh in that place. We
[1:23:36] trust, oh God, that you will watch over
[1:23:37] the saints until we're able to come back
[1:23:38] together again. May you be glorified,
[1:23:41] magnified, and all that we do. In Jesus'
[1:23:44] name we pray. Amen. And amen. Blessed be
[1:23:49] the name of the Lord. God bless you. Uh
[1:23:51] we'll have the brothers come at this
[1:23:53] time uh to dismiss us. Amen. God bless
[1:23:56] you.
