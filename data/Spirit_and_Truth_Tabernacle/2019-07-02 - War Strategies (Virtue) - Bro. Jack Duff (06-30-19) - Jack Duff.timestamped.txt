[59:55] sir preciate blessing a man to Spirit of
[1:00:02] Truth
[1:00:05] mr. speech and everyone and in their
[1:00:08] respective places just I thank God for
[1:00:12] what he is doing and I met a man and
[1:00:17] heard the specials and thank God for
[1:00:21] that hurt my wife singing and I just had
[1:00:31] a question anybody get a recording
[1:00:33] brother Jeffrey okay you got it to make
[1:00:36] sure you send me the recording
[1:00:39] man you know that those it was a few and
[1:00:43] far between she got a beautiful voice a
[1:00:46] man and just you know I just I just
[1:00:49] appreciate when she uses it for the Lord
[1:00:52] like that just she took us back to old
[1:00:55] school and a man brought one out or
[1:00:57] whatever it takes and know that I wasn't
[1:01:01] it it was it okay cuz there was a part a
[1:01:06] part in that song y'all gonna be seated
[1:01:09] just for a second there was a part of
[1:01:11] that song that says something bow down
[1:01:14] no not not that something about being
[1:01:20] like Jesus to be more like you that's
[1:01:26] what I'm willing to do and yeah I was
[1:01:29] just kind of thinking on that because
[1:01:32] this is a really our the channel that
[1:01:35] we're in you know we started a journey
[1:01:38] and war strategies and man and and and
[1:01:42] our foundation and this dog is the
[1:01:47] statue of a perfect man which we see
[1:01:49] here to my right and you know in order
[1:01:53] our whole objective as Christians is to
[1:01:59] be like Christ
[1:02:01] a man it's not just to go to church
[1:02:03] that's great but the objective is to be
[1:02:07] like Jesus right and everything that we
[1:02:10] do were trying to be more and more like
[1:02:12] him so I was just very appreciative of
[1:02:15] that and a man and sister Tina took us
[1:02:18] old-school and a man I would certainly
[1:02:21] appreciate then can never never get
[1:02:25] enough of the blunt and you know I'm
[1:02:29] hearing that there are some churches say
[1:02:31] that we don't need the same songs like
[1:02:33] that anymore I can't agree with that we
[1:02:37] need more blood all right blood is blood
[1:02:42] is extremely important in it and if the
[1:02:45] blood it lost his power I wouldn't be
[1:02:47] where I am today
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:49] and can wash you it can't claim she
[1:02:52] heard you a man and like brother branham
[1:02:56] said it's like dropping a man ink into
[1:02:59] the bleach once the ink actually hits
[1:03:03] the bleach you never find the ink again
[1:03:05] it disintegrates right and that's what
[1:03:09] happens when you're seeing is washed in
[1:03:13] the message of the hour
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:20] no actually is when your saves watching
[1:03:22] the blood now you have to be careful
[1:03:29] because in the message the brother
[1:03:32] brother branham tells us that the majors
[1:03:37] talk about the the bride actually
[1:03:40] beating the blood right so you know
[1:03:43] there's some there's some things that we
[1:03:45] can talk about there but we just think
[1:03:48] up for them an umbrella solemnly thank
[1:03:49] you also for going back and I'm pulling
[1:03:52] out at that good one too and we just
[1:03:54] appreciate a man so much God is a good
[1:03:58] God a man a man I just love them I just
[1:04:05] needed to make you all aware so you
[1:04:09] brother
[1:04:09] Quentin's father will be we say laid to
[1:04:16] rest on next weekend there in Arlington
[1:04:21] Cemetery so this ass tonight you all
[1:04:23] just be in prayer for him I actually
[1:04:27] have to go up to perform the ceremony
[1:04:30] there at Arlington on next weekend so
[1:04:34] I'll be leaving out on Saturday morning
[1:04:36] and going up there and we'll be back
[1:04:41] just keep me in prayer just kind of a I
[1:04:44] knew that I had that coming I knew it
[1:04:47] was you know on my schedule and I needed
[1:04:49] to take care of it and and then you know
[1:04:52] this morning I got a telephone call
[1:04:54] brother what's going on me to pray about
[1:04:56] speaking at the meetings and opening the
[1:04:59] services so y'all pray for me
[1:05:02] like oh I didn't see that one coming
[1:05:05] that was on the radar and just pray that
[1:05:07] you know the Lord would just you know if
[1:05:10] it's the Lord's will give us inspiration
[1:05:12] for for that but a lot going on over the
[1:05:17] next month or so I think I'd also have
[1:05:19] to correct something I mentioned that we
[1:05:21] try to do questions and answers on the
[1:05:23] last Friday of the month I totally
[1:05:25] forgot that brother Caleb Duran was
[1:05:27] coming from Tucson Arizona to be with us
[1:05:29] that weekend he'll be here on that on
[1:05:33] that Friday night in that Sunday morning
[1:05:35] with us so what I'll probably end up
[1:05:37] doing is after we come through Hebrews
[1:05:41] chapter 11 there's a few more lessons on
[1:05:44] that and after we get through that I'm
[1:05:46] gonna inject on a couple of Wednesday
[1:05:48] nights the remaining portion of the
[1:05:50] questions and answers so I know that and
[1:05:54] I won't necessarily record that because
[1:05:57] we do our periscope live on Wednesday
[1:06:00] nights and I don't necessarily want that
[1:06:02] going out I'd like to keep that for our
[1:06:04] church amen the questions and answers is
[1:06:07] really for our church every Church is
[1:06:09] sovereign amen and we certainly honor
[1:06:12] how other people might feel about
[1:06:13] certain things but we're just doing the
[1:06:16] best we can the lead spirit and truth
[1:06:17] tabernacle so I won't put those things
[1:06:20] out on periscope or anything like that I
[1:06:22] don't even do video recordings of it I
[1:06:25] do mp3 recordings but it's something
[1:06:29] that if you were to request it my
[1:06:31] request to you would be keep it to
[1:06:33] yourself a man don't don't give that out
[1:06:36] to other churches where it might create
[1:06:38] a problem a man with so many other
[1:06:40] churches I've come to understand that we
[1:06:44] as ministers we don't see everything I
[1:06:47] tie a man quickly know what I'm saying
[1:06:54] but we don't see everything eye-to-eye
[1:06:56] we still love one of them a man and we
[1:07:00] pray for one another but we don't see
[1:07:02] everything at times and the Prophet said
[1:07:05] that the Prophet said that we probably
[1:07:07] wouldn't see things I'm even he said
[1:07:10] that if he had a board and he had a man
[1:07:12] on this board that wouldn't stand up and
[1:07:14] speak what he believed he kicked a man
[1:07:16] off the board so he didn't want people
[1:07:18] around him that were just saying yes yes
[1:07:20] yes that's right let's know so iron
[1:07:23] sharpens iron
[1:07:24] all right so sometimes you can see
[1:07:26] things from a different angle and not
[1:07:27] that you know I wouldn't dare say we've
[1:07:29] all the ones got it right I wouldn't say
[1:07:31] that we can we can learn from other
[1:07:32] people but you know we don't need to
[1:07:34] necessarily introduce some things you
[1:07:36] know to people just just let it be for
[1:07:39] our church and you know we'll just take
[1:07:41] it from there so keep those keep those
[1:07:45] things in mind and and I like I say I'll
[1:07:47] probably inject right after come out of
[1:07:50] Hebrews 11 before I go into Hebrews 12
[1:07:53] I will bring some other questions and
[1:07:55] answers amen
[1:07:57] forward to try to get that and and it
[1:07:59] gives it again depends on how much we
[1:08:02] have there because if more questions
[1:08:04] start coming then I'll have to come up
[1:08:05] with another time to get that and I will
[1:08:07] commit to doing that I want to make sure
[1:08:10] that we we try to get you know the the
[1:08:13] heart set of people settle in just about
[1:08:16] every area amen how many love the Lord
[1:08:19] Jesus a man so praise the Lord
[1:08:23] a man I think that's all I need to know
[1:08:27] so I wanted to thank God again for mr.
[1:08:30] Tom a man not being being with this home
[1:08:33] today we came came here on on Tuesday
[1:08:40] night for our brothers prayer meeting

[1:08:53] talking a little bit and I said well how
[1:08:55] do you see it heard I was having prayer
[1:08:57] and I'm coming I said well how did you
[1:08:59] hear about prayer and I said I was
[1:09:01] watching online and and
[1:09:04] my prayers say didn't y'all have a
[1:09:05] combined service too so yeah that was on
[1:09:08] Sunday and say okay so he came to prayer
[1:09:11] and my you know just we appreciate you
[1:09:15] know him just coming and just entering
[1:09:17] in you know being with us for the first
[1:09:20] time then it came back on
[1:09:21] Wednesday night a man for Bible studying
[1:09:23] and I came back Friday night for
[1:09:26] questions and answers and I mean he's
[1:09:28] here this morning so it's so good to
[1:09:30] have me he's one of our neighbors who
[1:09:32] lives here in the neighborhood and I
[1:09:34] just so good to have him I there's many
[1:09:37] people that hear us online but never
[1:09:40] actually come into the church right so
[1:09:43] we're very very grateful that he's here
[1:09:45] with us segment on today and I'll just
[1:09:47] pray that the Lord bless them in a very
[1:09:49] special way
[1:09:49] amen all right so I think that's all
[1:09:52] that I need to know one other thing we
[1:09:56] are we're gonna try to do a
[1:09:59] back-to-school drive and access to Tina
[1:10:02] just to put on the on the board here
[1:10:05] some of the things that we need it then
[1:10:07] we're going to access just stay within
[1:10:08] the things that we needed we I think
[1:10:12] need about 32 backpacks and with those
[1:10:16] 32 we would have a total of a hundred
[1:10:18] backpacks that we'd be able to give to
[1:10:21] some of the kids in this area as they go
[1:10:23] back to school and I think that would be
[1:10:25] awesome
[1:10:26] you know if we're able to do that I
[1:10:27] don't think that we'll be going back to
[1:10:31] Okeechobee this year we'll try to do
[1:10:33] this local and you know I know there is
[1:10:36] a meeting with brother
[1:10:39] Simmons that's coming up and and I you
[1:10:43] just heard through the grapevine some of
[1:10:45] the Saints that's planning on going and
[1:10:46] that's that's perfectly fine if if you
[1:10:50] are going please just kind of let me
[1:10:51] know so I can just kind of you know we
[1:10:54] try to just be prepared for those things
[1:10:57] but I think we probably end up doing the
[1:10:59] back-to-school Drive that we can not to
[1:11:00] stop people from going to the meeting
[1:11:02] but there's a lot of other things on the
[1:11:05] schedule and I and that's that's the
[1:11:06] only time that
[1:11:07] I know that I'd be able to kind of
[1:11:08] commit to it so if you're going that's
[1:11:11] fine don't change your plans for any of
[1:11:13] that but but those that would still be
[1:11:16] here and want to be a part of that
[1:11:18] back-to-school drive it'll probably
[1:11:19] happen in that first weekend and August
[1:11:21] so just kind of keep that in mind keep
[1:11:23] that on your calendar and we're looking
[1:11:24] to do something here local we'll try to
[1:11:26] find a hundred kids that we can be a
[1:11:28] blessing to and also if you would just

[1:12:50] bless you let's stand to our feet
[1:12:51] let's read a couple scriptures here
[1:12:54] today a man and we'll go from 2nd Peter
[1:13:00] chapter 1 this is our basis as we are
[1:13:04] going through this journey of war
[1:13:07] strategies a man we talked on war
[1:13:10] strategies faith amen today we'll talk
[1:13:13] on war strategies virtue a man war
[1:13:17] strategies virtue here in 2nd Peter
[1:13:20] the one starting at verse three says
[1:13:28] according as his divine power hath given
[1:13:32] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:13:34] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:13:39] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:13:42] virtue a man so he's called us to glory
[1:13:45] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:13:49] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:13:53] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:13:58] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:14:02] corruption that is in the world through
[1:14:04] lust and beside this giving all
[1:14:08] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:14:12] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:14:16] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:14:19] and to patience godliness and to
[1:14:22] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:14:24] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[1:14:27] things be in you glory to God
[1:14:31] the man is an inside job for if these
[1:14:35] things be in you and abound they make
[1:14:39] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[1:14:41] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[1:14:49] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:14:53] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[1:14:56] from his old sins verse 10 says
[1:14:59] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:15:01] diligence to make your calling and
[1:15:03] election sure but if you do these things
[1:15:07] ye shall never fall a man what a promise
[1:15:12] and let's just go back over here and
[1:15:14] we'll pick up a scripture in second
[1:15:16] chronicles a man chapter 14 second
[1:15:21] chronicles chapter 14 and I'll start
[1:15:25] reading at verse 9 a man 2nd chronicles
[1:15:30] chapter 14 and start reading here verse
[1:15:33] verse nine Amen praise the Lord says in
[1:15:41] there came out against them Zehra the
[1:15:45] Ethiopian with a host of a thousand
[1:15:48] thousand and three hundred chariots and
[1:15:51] came unto Malaysia now what that
[1:15:54] thousand thousand is that's 1 million
[1:15:57] alright so when we read that in
[1:15:59] Scripture thousand thousands talking is
[1:16:01] speaking of 1 million three hundred
[1:16:04] shares verse 10 says the NASA went out
[1:16:08] against him and they set the battle in a
[1:16:12] ray in the valley of zefa at Marea now
[1:16:17] aster knew that he was outnumbered but
[1:16:21] even though he was outnumbered he still
[1:16:23] went to battle praise the Lord Amen
[1:16:27] oftentimes when we feel like the thing
[1:16:29] is against us we don't show up
[1:16:32] hallelujah we run from the thing right
[1:16:35] but this man was outnumbered and still
[1:16:38] went to battle glory to God you got to
[1:16:42] know who's fighting for you a man in
[1:16:45] verse 11 says and asks a cried unto the
[1:16:47] Lord his God now notice he's in the

[1:16:54] there on the battle fronts
[1:16:55] hey man church Lori to God he'll always
[1:16:59] come through now a man and acid cried
[1:17:03] unto the Lord his God and said Lord it
[1:17:06] is nothing with V to help I see a man it
[1:17:13] is nothing with me to help whether with
[1:17:16] many or with them that have no power
[1:17:20] oh my god a man I need I need a lot of
[1:17:26] money gods and it's nothing for you to
[1:17:30] help cuz once you get involved in this
[1:17:32] thing things change
[1:17:34] Amen this the scale just just drops when
[1:17:38] God get involved right ain't no balance
[1:17:40] is no more a man this thing

[1:17:46] will try to get that thing balanced but
[1:17:47] man you get somebody look too heavy on
[1:17:49] the other side you can forget about it
[1:17:50] you're going straight up in the air
[1:17:51] right man when God is God is in this
[1:17:55] thing this minor problems like the I
[1:17:57] mean the problems Leafly God just got
[1:18:01] involved in this hallelujah glory to God

[1:18:30] against this multitude a man o Lord thou
[1:18:34] are our gods let not man prevail against

[1:18:43] battle right this is your battle it may
[1:18:47] you the one in the mrs. why are you
[1:18:49] praying let not man prevail against thee
[1:18:51] because Isis representing God hallelujah
[1:18:55] whatever situation you're in you're
[1:18:57] representing God listen first to us that
[1:19:00] so the Lord smoked the Ethiopians before
[1:19:04] acident means they didn't even fight he
[1:19:07] was just there the Lord smote the
[1:19:10] Ethiopians before asked him before Judah
[1:19:12] and the Ethiopians fled and asked and
[1:19:16] the people that were with him pursued
[1:19:18] them unto Guerard and the Ethiopians
[1:19:21] were overthrown that they could not
[1:19:23] recover themselves for they were
[1:19:25] destroyed before the Lord and before his
[1:19:28] hosts and they carried away very much
[1:19:32] spoil I like that and they smote all the
[1:19:35] cities around about Guerard but the fear
[1:19:37] of the Lord came upon them and they
[1:19:39] spoiled all the cities for there was
[1:19:40] exceeding my spoil in them they smote
[1:19:43] also the tents of cattle and carried
[1:19:45] away sheep and camels and abundance and
[1:19:47] returned to Jerusalem amen let's pray
[1:19:52] father we think
[1:19:52] you for the opportunity to read the word
[1:19:56] of the Lord today but God we know it
[1:19:59] takes the Holy Spirit to quicken the
[1:20:02] things that we have read and make it
[1:20:04] alive for us right now that we might be
[1:20:08] able to apply what we read father we
[1:20:10] just trust that you take control over
[1:20:12] this portion of the service as you have
[1:20:15] certainly been in control of everything
[1:20:17] else thank you for touching brother
[1:20:19] Solomon in his body driving that devil
[1:20:22] away hallelujah God we thank you for
[1:20:26] giving them victory thank you for him
[1:20:27] pressing his way into the house of the
[1:20:29] Lord to lead the saints in worship this
[1:20:31] morning and O God we just we just
[1:20:34] appreciate you being a right now gone a
[1:20:37] man and father that we can depend on you
[1:20:39] so whatever else that anybody else here
[1:20:42] may need today God may your meet us all
[1:20:44] at the point of our need we commit
[1:20:45] ourselves unto thee O God it's in Jesus
[1:20:48] name we pray amen and amen god bless you
[1:20:51] you can be seated praise the Lord Amen
[1:20:55] as we again just continue our thought
[1:20:58] here and war strategies dealing with the
[1:21:03] the topic of virtue a man these these
[1:21:09] things that are on the chart here which
[1:21:11] says faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:21:14] patience godless brotherly kindness love
[1:21:17] that's identified as the seven virtues
[1:21:20] but we're looking at the the second
[1:21:23] layer their virtue today so just just
[1:21:26] bear with me as we just kind of comb
[1:21:28] through this just kind of set us up I
[1:21:30] want to start with a quote from the
[1:21:34] sermon what is the Holy Ghost amen the
[1:21:37] Prophet gives us a man some statements
[1:21:41] here and I want to just pick up there it
[1:21:44] says now we're at the end of this time
[1:21:48] says each man has looked at the end of
[1:21:52] his Junction for the coming of Christ
[1:21:54] but they had a lot to look forward to
[1:21:57] the returning of the Jews and flying
[1:21:59] saucers in the skies all the things that
[1:22:02] we see today but we're at the end it
[1:22:05] says where
[1:22:05] here now they know the church was to
[1:22:09] receive power that would work in the
[1:22:12] church the same works of Christ so they
[1:22:14] know to everybody know that the church
[1:22:16] was to receive power that would work in
[1:22:18] the church the same works of Christ
[1:22:20] because as a shadow becomes deeper and
[1:22:23] deeper and reflects more so as you take
[1:22:26] a shade farther away from the shade the
[1:22:29] least reflection you get of the sheen
[1:22:31] and after a while the gets closer
[1:22:34] closer to the tree and the shade and si
[1:22:38] the closer and closer to the tree and
[1:22:39] the shade is the same thing so as you
[1:22:41] bring it closer the tree and the shade
[1:22:43] becomes one hallelujah amen the further
[1:22:46] and further away you get then it's the
[1:22:48] tree is not casting any more shape so he
[1:22:50] says now the Spirit of God has worked on
[1:22:53] the justification under Luther
[1:22:55] sanctification under Wesley the baptism
[1:22:59] of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and
[1:23:02] here it is in the last days performing
[1:23:04] and doing the very same thing that it
[1:23:07] did when it was in Christ now I was you
[1:23:08] know it was a quote in Sunday school in
[1:23:10] our lesson the problems talked about it
[1:23:13] was explaining the Philadelphian church
[1:23:15] age the Bible said that they had a
[1:23:17] little strength they had a lot of word
[1:23:19] but they did not have any dynamic power
[1:23:22] to go with that word and it says thank
[1:23:24] God you know even though there was in
[1:23:26] that kitchen said thank God because the
[1:23:28] power was starting to return to the
[1:23:30] church amen and what we saw in brother
[1:23:33] Brandon's ministry was not only just the
[1:23:34] word but we saw the power amen also
[1:23:37] coming back into the church and I
[1:23:38] believe even though the Prophet is
[1:23:40] already gone a man often seen that same
[1:23:42] power still here
[1:23:44] Amen Akeem manifesting through the
[1:23:46] church hallelujah so he goes only says
[1:23:49] this he says now the baptismal goes on
[1:23:54] the Pentecost and here it is in the last
[1:23:55] day performing and doing the very same
[1:23:57] things that it did when it was in Christ
[1:23:59] what is it the church in Christ has
[1:24:01] become one and as soon as they connect
[1:24:05] together that last link she'll go
[1:24:08] through the sky shout
[1:24:10] oh my I like that statement there a man
[1:24:14] she'll go through the sky shouting hey
[1:24:18] man you know now that that tells me that
[1:24:21] uh we not gone into heaven quietly Amen
[1:24:28] that tells me we're not leaving this
[1:24:30] earth that they meant but we're gonna go
[1:24:34] through the sky shouting Oh hallelujah
[1:24:38] hey man if you ain't if you ain't got a
[1:24:40] dance maybe we can give you some lessons
[1:24:42] or something but glory to God you better
[1:24:45] learn how to shout a little bit Amen
[1:24:47] even if you look me not not you know I
[1:24:49] let's be honest when folk dance in the
[1:24:52] world they look crazy
[1:24:53] hey man some of the stuff they do look
[1:24:56] absolutely crazy I mean if I'm gonna
[1:24:59] look crazy I'm gonna look crazy for God
[1:25:02] hey man while I let loose for God's
[1:25:06] hallelujah so much when we was out there
[1:25:09] in the world we didn't mind looking
[1:25:10] crazy for the devil but we come to
[1:25:12] church and we want to look yeah
[1:25:15] dignified right get rid of that why
[1:25:19] don't we enjoy Jesus enjoy this thing
[1:25:24] because when we leave here we meet him
[1:25:26] shouting oh hey man you might as well
[1:25:32] get I was watching a little video to
[1:25:35] this they put out on Instagram and in a
[1:25:37] brother brother brother brother was in
[1:25:39] the car with some of his brother Larry
[1:25:41] he in the car with with some of his uh
[1:25:43] his relatives and stop the car stop the

[1:27:40] Holy Ghost by the restoration of it's
[1:27:43] very person so when we're talking about

[1:28:12] church is not good enough amen
[1:28:15] he didn't die so he could come to church
[1:28:17] he did not send his spirit back so you
[1:28:20] could just come to church but he sent
[1:28:22] his spirit back so you might manifest
[1:28:24] his life because you can't do this with
[1:28:27] your nature amen you don't need a change
[1:28:31] of nature which is his nature that's why
[1:28:34] he said I'll give you a new heart I'll
[1:28:36] give you a new spirit and then I'll put
[1:28:38] my spirit in the midst of that that's
[1:28:41] what this thing is all about alright

[1:29:21] that he said about it been the
[1:29:23] foundation when you're building a many
[1:29:26] say just like if you're building a house

[1:29:34] roof right you got to start with the
[1:29:36] foundation and when you get the

[1:29:42] foundation glory to God right and then
[1:29:45] once you got walls up and amen and the
[1:29:48] foundation you got walls up now you can
[1:29:50] put a roof on the top of this thing but

[1:31:08] stuff that we do come on somebody
[1:31:11] Amen Christ in Christ in handle
[1:31:13] situations like that Christ in handle
[1:31:16] circumstances like that it shouldn't
[1:31:19] just be a band that we put on our hand
[1:31:22] WWJD it should be a lifestyle that we
[1:31:27] live really with Jesus do and we should
[1:31:31] follow the scriptural patterns as to
[1:31:34] what he's already done you ain't got no
[1:31:37] wonder what he would do it's right in
[1:31:38] the Bible and we gotta follow his
[1:31:41] patterns
[1:31:42] oh come on somebody Amen Jesus Jesus was
[1:31:47] faithful in church you know the bottom
[1:31:51] say it was his custom to go to church it
[1:31:55] was Jesus
[1:31:56] custom so that ought to be your custom a
[1:32:00] man church see it's so many things it's
[1:32:03] right there in the scripture we can
[1:32:04] follow the pattern he already laid it
[1:32:06] out when we when we read about its life
[1:32:08] we know what we supposed to be doing all
[1:32:11] right come on let me go on first you
[1:32:13] must be born again and then when you're
[1:32:16] born again you have faith now when
[1:32:19] you're born again you have faith
[1:32:22] let's get that when you're born again
[1:32:25] you know at faith you have things so so
[1:32:31] did this really if something has to
[1:32:33] happen on inside we were talking about
[1:32:35] that this morning
[1:32:35] you know Judas had that this justice
[1:32:38] ministry that Jesus gave him the cast
[1:32:40] out the sick right and I mean I mean I
[1:32:43] cast out Devils in heal the sick you
[1:32:45] know
[1:32:45] I mean Judas did all these great things
[1:32:47] but brother branham say he stopped short
[1:32:49] of going to Pentecost now wait a minute
[1:32:51] with all these miracles being formed
[1:32:54] amen performed by Judas why we need to
[1:32:57] go to hemming house
[1:32:59] hallelujah the purpose of going to
[1:33:01] Pentecost is so that your nature can
[1:33:04] change still had a problem with money
[1:33:09] come on somebody amen even though many
[1:33:12] people have manifestations in their life
[1:33:14] they still have other problems on the
[1:33:16] inside that gotting dealt with you and
[1:33:18] only Pentecostal experience will take
[1:33:22] those things out of you but life has a
[1:33:35] way of Cole's and us to kind of get
[1:33:37] disconnected from the water source
[1:33:41] disconnected from this water source
[1:33:43] begins to crumble
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:01] you got to change some things then I
[1:34:24] tell you the truth I come from a day
[1:34:26] when folk men the Holy Ghost we hit the
[1:34:28] church and if there was any little thing
[1:34:30] going on a man the Holy Ghost were half
[1:34:33] people go hug one another
[1:34:36] anybody remember them days and I mean
[1:34:39] they really meant it they was apologized
[1:34:41] and I'm sorry my brother I'm sorry the
[1:34:43] Holy Ghost was forced him to go do dance
[1:34:45] they would leave church without making
[1:34:47] things right but now we sweep it all
[1:34:50] under the carpet I know I did you wrong
[1:34:52] oh well what kind of spirit that ain't
[1:34:56] the Holy Spirit how do you touch we talk
[1:35:01] about the character of Christ being
[1:35:04] manifested in his people all right I'm
[1:35:07] going on glory to God glory to God he
[1:35:11] says this said you must be born again
[1:35:13] and then when you're born again you you
[1:35:15] you have faith you believe the word
[1:35:18] until you're born again you're arguing
[1:35:22] amen if you're just religiously inclined
[1:35:25] you got a little human knowledge that
[1:35:28] you should do right you'll never be able
[1:35:32] to agree upon the Word of God you'll
[1:35:33] never do it you've got to be born again
[1:35:36] and born again it produces faith oh this
[1:35:40] is powerful me born again when you're
[1:35:42] truly born again it automatically
[1:35:44] produces faith all right then after you
[1:35:47] get faith this right here he says fa fa
[1:35:51] I th was looking at that foundation FB i
[1:35:53] th faith then you're just in position of
[1:35:57] growing then you're just in position of
[1:35:59] growing now the Prophet also goes on to
[1:36:02] make a statement here and I'm gonna
[1:36:03] bring this in if we can that's the same
[1:36:06] power that was in Jesus it's supposed to
[1:36:09] be in his church and he also said the
[1:36:11] Christ is a truth try Christ in the true
[1:36:14] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:36:17] Acts now let's read that out of church
[1:36:19] age book made man and and we will just
[1:36:23] bring this amen a little a little
[1:36:26] further for you glory glory glory says
[1:36:28] let me show you another reason why Satan
[1:36:31] hates this book of the revelation of
[1:36:33] Jesus Christ
[1:36:34] a man in the end the church and I'm
[1:36:37] reading from the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ
[1:36:38] it says hates this book of the
[1:36:41] revelation of Jesus Christ in the church
[1:36:42] he knows that Jesus is the same
[1:36:45] yesterday and today and forever and he
[1:36:48] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[1:36:51] more than do 90% of the theologians he
[1:36:54] knows that since God is immutable in in
[1:36:57] his nature God God can't change his
[1:36:59] nature says then he then he's just as
[1:37:02] immutable in his ways that Satan knows
[1:37:05] are surely that the original church at
[1:37:08] Pentecost with the power of God it says
[1:37:13] mark 16 in action is the true church
[1:37:16] that Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:37:21] false it has to be so this is our
[1:37:23] standard this is what we're aiming for
[1:37:25] we want to be like that original church
[1:37:27] at Pentecost March 16
[1:37:30] in action that's the true church that
[1:37:32] Jesus will claim as his own he goes on
[1:37:34] now remember this Christ in the true
[1:37:37] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:37:41] Acts but the book of Revelation shows
[1:37:43] that how that how the Antichrist spirit
[1:37:46] we're coming to the church and defile it
[1:37:49] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:37:52] now you know you all need to just kind
[1:37:54] of meditate on that statement
[1:37:56] how has the Antichrist spirit coming to
[1:37:59] your own personal life to make you
[1:38:01] lukewarm former and powerless amen if
[1:38:05] you know how he got in you know how to
[1:38:06] get him out hallelujah somebody right he
[1:38:10] said he says it exposes Satan revealing
[1:38:14] his word a tempted destruction of God's
[1:38:17] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:38:19] Word right down to the time he is cast
[1:38:22] into the lake of fire
[1:38:23] he fights that he cannot spend it he
[1:38:26] knows that if the people get the true
[1:38:28] revelation of the true church and what
[1:38:31] she is what she stands for
[1:38:33] and that she can do the greater works
[1:38:36] hallelujah I love this statement she
[1:38:39] will be an invincible army that mean you
[1:38:42] can't be defeated no matter what the
[1:38:45] devil brings your direction you you
[1:38:47] cannot be defeated she will be an
[1:38:50] invisible army if they get a true
[1:38:52] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:38:54] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:38:57] God's Spirit design and withstand the
[1:39:01] Antichrist fear Satan will be powerless
[1:39:04] before her he will be D will be us
[1:39:06] definitely thought of today as when
[1:39:08] Christ was stood as every effort the
[1:39:10] gain power over him in a desert
[1:39:11] yesterday Satan hates revelation but we
[1:39:14] love it a man with true revelations in
[1:39:17] our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[1:39:19] prevail against us but we will prevail
[1:39:23] over them some of us may feel like we
[1:39:26] stand at the gates of hell this morning
[1:39:27] you got a promise surrounding you that
[1:39:30] you will prevail over the
[1:39:32] of hail hallelujah amen all right thank
[1:39:39] you Jesus a couple more the coach that I
[1:39:42] want to just kind of give here and amen
[1:39:44] as we talk about this war strategist
[1:39:46] virtue a man
[1:39:49] thank you Jesus this is also coming out
[1:39:51] of statue of a perfect man I'm at
[1:39:53] paragraph 141 thank you Jesus mentioned
[1:39:59] to you to be good for you to go back and

[1:44:27] Bible said we read over here in the Book
[1:44:29] of Luke we're saying virtue went out of
[1:44:32] him a man now just pull it down there i
[1:44:35] want to i want to just inject there he's
[1:44:37] referring to the story there and Luke

[1:45:05] might get excommunicated from the church
[1:45:07] but see it's not their child dying it's
[1:45:10] our child dying so so we're gonna have

[1:45:26] it on jobs go find Jesus and bring Jesus
[1:45:30] back to this house
[1:45:31] hallelujah he might not be welcome in
[1:45:35] our church but Jesus is certainly
[1:45:38] welcome in this house
[1:45:40] the reason he's welcome because only
[1:45:42] Jesus can change the situation that
[1:45:45] we're going through how do you somebody
[1:45:48] we need to make changes more welcome in
[1:45:50] our houses but Majoris goals and amen is
[1:45:54] going to get Jesus and and he finally
[1:45:56] gets torment it tells him you know what
[1:45:58] his issue is and Jesus jumps up
[1:46:01] self-care I'd go home with you oh my god
[1:46:03] and as he's Amen on the way to this
[1:46:06] man's house a big crowd begins to kind
[1:46:09] of crowd around the Lord Jesus in and
[1:46:12] they're headed down to Charles Houston
[1:46:13] and there was a woman that was a men
[1:46:16] sitting in her house and she recognized
[1:46:18] it when there's a big cry like this
[1:46:20] somebody important must be around
[1:46:22] hallelujah maybe she began acts who is
[1:46:24] this man that that's around why are they
[1:46:27] crowded up like this and and what's
[1:46:28] going on they say Jesus is in town she
[1:46:31] said Jesus the condition that I have
[1:46:34] I've had it for 12 years and the Bible
[1:46:38] says she went from Doctor to doctor she
[1:46:41] went from a man from one position to the
[1:46:43] next position and the Bible said not one
[1:46:46] person was able to help her so she said
[1:46:49] within herself now I know he didn't come
[1:46:51] to the city for me Amen I didn't give
[1:46:54] him a personal invitation John's the one
[1:46:57] has his attention now but if I could
[1:47:00] just touch the hem of His garment then I
[1:47:04] know my condition will be solved I ain't
[1:47:09] trying to touch Peter I ain't trying to
[1:47:12] touch char
[1:47:13] I need to touch Jesus and she begin to
[1:47:19] press to the crop and she come up the
[1:47:23] Bible says she come up from behind them
[1:47:25] and I don't know what she had to do but
[1:47:27] she reached him she got ahold of Jesus
[1:47:30] garment and just pulled on it and walked
[1:47:31] away now when this happened Jesus say
[1:47:34] who touched me
[1:47:36] Peter begin to rebuke the Lord Jesus how
[1:47:39] you not say who touch you in when the
[1:47:41] cross I've thrown to you everybody touch
[1:47:43] you how loose a say Peter because virtue
[1:47:46] strength just left my body and I know

[1:48:29] myself if I could just touch the hem of
[1:48:31] your garment now you gotta understand
[1:48:33] Jesus couldn't touch help with the
[1:48:34] condition that she had the Bible amen
[1:48:38] the law would not allow him to go to her
[1:48:41] with this issue of blood couldn't even

[1:48:49] touch him
[1:48:51] oh praise God so see women she went she
[1:48:55] went around the law and she touched him
[1:48:58] and she was made whole right then we

[1:52:06] situation
[1:52:14] daughter from the team he's expecting us
[1:52:19] as believers to have the same type of
[1:52:23] virtue let me just keep on reading in
[1:52:26] this quote glory to God glory to God
[1:52:30] since the Bible said we read over here
[1:52:33] in the Book of Luke where it say it
[1:52:36] virtue went out of him that's right if
[1:52:39] we're gonna be like him we must have
[1:52:43] virtue since we must have it to be like
[1:52:47] him it's the first song that I ever
[1:52:49] loved in the hymns one of the greatest
[1:52:52] was to be like Jesus well if I'm gonna
[1:52:56] be like Jesus I got to have virtue and a
[1:53:00] past that it can pass for from me to the
[1:53:02] people because virtue went out of him to
[1:53:06] the people glory to God virtue and
[1:53:09] before you can let it out you got to
[1:53:12] at first you haven't got it it won't
[1:53:15] come out if you haven't got it it won't
[1:53:18] come out there's nothing for it to come
[1:53:20] out of what if someone tried to drop
[1:53:23] virtue out of us and the check will
[1:53:26] return insufficient funds see no non
[1:53:32] dare to draw from check bounced
[1:53:35] that's your spiritual check you don't
[1:53:37] want any of y'all ever had a check
[1:53:39] bounced it's not a good feeling
[1:53:41] hey man you have to do a lot of
[1:53:43] explaining
[1:53:45] talk to me somebody when when your check
[1:53:48] bounces yeah it should've been there I
[1:53:52] know it should have been there buddy
[1:53:55] and one now now not only not only not
[1:53:59] only do you have to pay them what you
[1:54:01] were paying them there's also some fees
[1:54:03] associated praise the Lord you pay a
[1:54:06] little more when the check bounces hey
[1:54:08] man hey man do you want to make sure you
[1:54:12] got something in your spiritual account
[1:54:13] you don't want that the check you don't
[1:54:16] want people come to you and they've
[1:54:17] drawn insufficient funds from you big
[1:54:20] face of situation you get nothing
[1:54:22] insufficient funds here and God brought
[1:54:25] them to you for a reason because he knew
[1:54:27] you could do something about it but
[1:54:29] insufficient funds see you see you know
[1:54:32] that I'm getting into this let me finish
[1:54:34] this quote it says the check will return
[1:54:37] insufficient funds see
[1:54:39] no none there to draw from check bounced
[1:54:41] somebody looking at you as a Christian
[1:54:44] and tomorrow see you out here carrying
[1:54:45] on like a sinner not much virtue can be
[1:54:47] drawn from that that's why foot connects
[1:54:49] you to pray because they see different
[1:54:53] lifestyle come on somebody one day you
[1:54:57] won't fire are you sitting quotes and
[1:55:00] everything hello somebody then all of a
[1:55:04] sudden we can get no quotes
[1:55:06] hey man right people can see right
[1:55:09] through that type of stuff we talked
[1:55:11] about godly virtue
[1:55:12] being inside of you amen
[1:55:16] you know talk about insufficient funds
[1:55:18] you know the disciples went through a
[1:55:19] time where they also have some
[1:55:20] insufficient funds
[1:55:22] here the the they had a situation that
[1:55:26] support was a epileptic I believe him
[1:55:28] and they brought him to the disciples
[1:55:30] and many just could not get the devil
[1:55:32] out of this boy so you know and here
[1:55:34] they've been given power they've been
[1:55:36] given you know authority to cast out
[1:55:38] Devils but they can't get the devil out
[1:55:39] of this boy and finally that the man say
[1:55:41] he needs to say you know what I'm kind
[1:55:43] of I'm kind of tired of you know of
[1:55:45] y'all where is Jesus where's Jesus I
[1:55:48] need Jesus right say I appreciate your
[1:55:51] efforts but I need Jesus and say well
[1:55:54] here here's Jesus a and he saying Jesus
[1:55:56] you know I got this situation and now I
[1:55:58] want to tell you now I did not bypass
[1:56:01] these disciples I brought them to your
[1:56:03] disciples but not one of them could do
[1:56:05] anything is there anything you can do
[1:56:06] for my boy and say bring them to me we
[1:56:09] ought to be in situations like Jesus
[1:56:12] where we can tell people bring that
[1:56:14] situation here bring that circumstance
[1:56:17] here because there's virtue to be able
[1:56:20] to handle the situation oh my god there
[1:56:23] is knowledge and patience and temperance
[1:56:25] and God loves to be able to handle the
[1:56:27] situation Jesus bring the situation here
[1:56:32] and Jesus Jesus you know dealt with the
[1:56:34] boy and got the spirit cast out of
[1:56:36] another type of light well why could we
[1:56:37] do the same because of your unbelief
[1:56:39] your unbelief and say not only that
[1:56:42] these kind only go out by fasting and by
[1:56:45] prayer but the real problem was their
[1:56:48] unbelief that's where the real sin is
[1:56:50] they had a situation where it was
[1:56:52] insufficient funds look in your own life
[1:56:55] has there been some circumstances where
[1:56:58] there's been some insufficient funds
[1:57:00] where people could not get from you what
[1:57:03] God ordained you to give them I looked
[1:57:08] at this and you know I want to use a man
[1:57:12] a couple of things here oh my god my god
[1:57:16] we read about ass
[1:57:18] there at the beginning and I'm I'm using
[1:57:20] a man the statue of her commanders my
[1:57:23] foundation but when we talk about war
[1:57:26] strategies amen
[1:57:28] where there's gonna be a couple
[1:57:30] different angles that I'm hitting this
[1:57:31] from but we talked about acid and how he
[1:57:33] you know he was there
[1:57:36] you know just just kind of believing God
[1:57:39] for you know him to show up in this
[1:57:41] battle that he was fighting but there
[1:57:43] was a time and an ass's life that I want
[1:57:45] to just kind of go back to and I want to
[1:57:47] read this in a second you know he got
[1:57:49] this victory over all these Ethiopians
[1:57:51] but you know there was a time where
[1:57:53] there was insufficient funds and assets
[1:57:56] life answer did a lot of great things a
[1:57:58] lot of great things here you know I can
[1:58:01] show where he depended completely on God
[1:58:04] and God brought them out of this battle
[1:58:05] with the Ethiopians Eve I mean he showed
[1:58:07] up didn't have to battle he was standing
[1:58:10] there with virtue with fortitude which
[1:58:13] strength even he was standing there in
[1:58:15] that place my god but but there was a
[1:58:18] time where acid did not do that and I
[1:58:20] wonder I want to bring this forth to you
[1:58:22] we're gonna go to second chronicles 16
[1:58:24] as we get that lined up it's gonna be
[1:58:26] verse 7 2nd chronicles 16 asks her had
[1:58:31] the people renew their faith in their
[1:58:32] commitment to God under his reign there
[1:58:35] was another thing great that AXA did his
[1:58:37] mother was actually
[1:58:40] sacrificing to Idol God since she was a
[1:58:42] queen answer had his mama dethrone taken
[1:58:46] off the throne because she was
[1:58:48] sacrificing some Idol God
[1:58:50] that's that's a pretty big thing for you
[1:58:53] I fought for a man to do the call says
[1:58:55] mama to say no you're not gonna be queen
[1:58:58] no more because you sacrificed tonight
[1:59:00] Oh God that's a that's a tremendous Dana
[1:59:03] I have to commend the man like that
[1:59:05] hallelujah but there was a time whereas
[1:59:08] amen
[1:59:09] through insufficient funds because he
[1:59:11] did not depend on the Lord now look at
[1:59:14] this in second chronicles 16 oh my let's
[1:59:19] look at verse 7 and I want to
[1:59:21] I want to just kind of also say to you
[1:59:24] that there are times where you might
[1:59:26] draw some insufficient funds because you
[1:59:28] didn't depend on the Lord you might have
[1:59:30] been dependent on yourself a man you
[1:59:32] might have been dependent on you know
[1:59:34] just your ability but you got to depend
[1:59:36] on the Lord in all things
[1:59:39] hallelujah glory to God amen and here we
[1:59:42] find a situation verse 7 I like this and
[1:59:45] at that time and let me let me let me
[1:59:48] also give you what what happened acid
[1:59:51] was getting ready to go to another
[1:59:52] battle and what he did was reach out to
[1:59:54] another king of another country and
[1:59:55] asked him to kind of come and make a
[1:59:57] make a league with him and and and and
[2:00:00] and and make it a league with him he
[2:00:02] took took money out of the temple and
[2:00:03] and gave it to this King and say make a
[2:00:05] league with me and now now when you're
[2:00:07] making it make a league with me break
[2:00:08] your league with the other king over
[2:00:09] there he tried to pay him off now the
[2:00:12] problem was after acid did that now the
[2:00:15] king did exactly what he actually do but
[2:00:17] after he did it after got a visitation
[2:00:20] from a prophet oh my goodness I love
[2:00:24] this you know because sometimes after we
[2:00:27] go through situations you can also get a
[2:00:29] visitation from the Prophet how through
[2:00:33] listening to the message and through
[2:00:36] listening to the message you know what
[2:00:37] you can do as I got a rebuke from the
[2:00:40] Prophet you know you can also get a
[2:00:42] rebuke from the Prophet just by
[2:00:44] listening to the man oh my god
[2:00:50] oftentimes were you listening or maybe
[2:00:52] somebody sent out a quote like oh Lord I
[2:00:54] didn't see from that angle but the good
[2:00:58] thing is that you humble yourself to
[2:01:00] what you heard the prophecy did not
[2:01:04] humble himself and he endured I'm in
[2:01:08] this condition with a pretty bad
[2:01:10] condition because he didn't humble
[2:01:11] himself after you heard what the Prophet
[2:01:13] said now let's read verse 7 says and at
[2:01:16] that time had an eye of the the seer
[2:01:18] came to ask a king of Judah and said
[2:01:22] unto him because thou has relied on the
[2:01:24] king of Syria now remember in this first
[2:01:27] battle he was crying out to God and
[2:01:28] praying and God God delivered he said
[2:01:30] because thou has relied on
[2:01:32] king of syria we talked about that this
[2:01:34] morning and you know in Sunday school I
[2:01:37] was I was sharing how I was reading
[2:01:39] there and then the church age book and
[2:01:40] brother branham's telling story about
[2:01:41] the the the young man in Africa and he
[2:01:44] had a little Idol that he carried around
[2:01:46] he had a little tag on his neck that
[2:01:47] said he was a Christian but he had an
[2:01:49] idol that carried around and brother Ram
[2:01:51] said well why is he carrying an idol if
[2:01:52] he's a Christian so him and the mayor
[2:01:54] got out and they started talking to the
[2:01:55] young man they say well my daddy gave me
[2:01:57] this and you know and and and and say
[2:01:59] you know I carry this Idol just in case
[2:02:02] something go wrong cuz this thing
[2:02:03] deliver my daddy for some major major
[2:02:05] things and say what happens - there were
[2:02:07] some Lions was the lion was stalking my
[2:02:09] daddy coming after him
[2:02:10] and he said my daddy built a fire and
[2:02:13] when he built the fire did he start
[2:02:14] talking to this Idol and the lion left
[2:02:17] him alone so predators brother Prem said
[2:02:19] oh it wasn't it wasn't the idol that
[2:02:21] delivers your daddy
[2:02:22] it was the fire because our animals
[2:02:25] aren't afraid of fire he said he said oh
[2:02:27] I was just saying if a moria the spirit
[2:02:31] fails then I don't want hallelujah and I
[2:02:36] asked a question to the solicitor class
[2:02:38] how many a man already got a plan B
[2:02:42] after your plan a fails huh your plan is
[2:02:47] I'm a pray about this thing but if it
[2:02:49] don't come in the time that I need it
[2:02:52] I'm going to plan me and I want to just
[2:02:55] let you know right now you never had a
[2:02:57] plan a plan B was your plan a and that's
[2:03:03] why God ain't do nothing
[2:03:06] listen if you can do a garden go to it
[2:03:10] [Music]
[2:03:13] you gotta get totally dependent Asha was
[2:03:18] in that battle he was totally dependent
[2:03:20] I got an army surrounding me they did
[2:03:23] that the arm is much greater than us god
[2:03:26] help us when you get like that gotta
[2:03:29] move hallelujah
[2:03:32] alright let's go on I want to read this
[2:03:34] way this is a good script I just love
[2:03:36] this scripture so at that time had a 9
[2:03:39] the seer came to answer because now this
[2:03:42] is a second matter that he's in he did
[2:03:44] not rely on God he relied on the king of
[2:03:46] Syria look at this he says ask the king
[2:03:48] of Judah and sending him because thou
[2:03:50] hast relied on the king of Syria and not
[2:03:53] relied on the Lord that God therefore it
[2:03:55] is the host of the king of Syria escape
[2:03:58] out of thine hand now therefore is the
[2:04:01] host of the king of Syria escape got it
[2:04:03] on him were not to eat the opens he's
[2:04:06] reminding him of what God did because
[2:04:07] this is insufficient funds on Isis part
[2:04:09] right we're not we're not the Ethiopians
[2:04:12] amen and Lubin and the Lubin a large a
[2:04:15] huge host with very many chariots and
[2:04:19] horsemen yet because thou didst rely on
[2:04:22] the Lord he delivers them into that hand
[2:04:26] now this is the verse I love for the
[2:04:29] eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[2:04:34] throughout the whole earth to show
[2:04:38] himself strong in the behalf of them
[2:04:41] whose heart is perfect toward him let me
[2:04:44] just just highlight that God is actually
[2:04:47] looking for something to get involved in
[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:52] God is God God God is waiting for you to
[2:04:56] invite him into your impossible
[2:04:59] situation he actually looking for
[2:05:02] something that he can place his stamp oh
[2:05:04] oh yeah when the Hebrew boys was
[2:05:09] amen couldn't go that's why couldn't go
[2:05:19] it was a god-sized job and let me tell
[2:05:22] you something you got some situations
[2:05:25] you see God is the only plan honey if he
[2:05:47] says no Denise just know I want to get
[2:05:49] to a spot where there's no it's just as
[2:05:53] good as his yes and I'm just as
[2:05:57] satisfied with a know that I am with a
[2:06:01] yes for the eyes of the Lord run to and
[2:06:07] fro throughout the whole earth to show
[2:06:08] himself strong on behalf of them whose
[2:06:10] heart it's perfect toward him hearing
[2:06:13] thou has done foolishly therefore from
[2:06:15] henceforth thou shalt have wars so when
[2:06:18] we look at this situation as through
[2:06:21] insufficient funds when he was faced
[2:06:23] with this circumstance and often times
[2:06:26] in our life we would draw insufficient
[2:06:28] funds as brother Branham said we would
[2:06:30] draw insufficient funds in the area of
[2:06:32] virtue when we're faced with certain
[2:06:34] certain certain circumstances we don't
[2:06:36] want that to be the case now let me go
[2:06:38] on a little further here a man oh my I
[2:06:44] was reading a man to you all
[2:06:49] first Pete I mean a second second Peter
[2:06:53] one and we read it a man from the King
[2:06:58] James Version but I want to read a man
[2:07:00] verse 3 through 7 from the emphatic diag
[2:07:04] lot so you can a man just pull up 2nd
[2:07:06] Peter 1:3 on the screen and start at
[2:07:09] verse 3 hallelujah but I want to read it
[2:07:11] from the emphatic die Glocke you can
[2:07:13] read it on the screen but I'm gonna read
[2:07:14] it from the emphatic dagger-like verse 3
[2:07:17] says even at his
[2:07:19] even as his divine power has granted to
[2:07:22] us all things related to life in piety
[2:07:25] through the knowledge of him who called
[2:07:27] us by glory and virtue verse 4 on
[2:07:30] account of which very great and precious
[2:07:34] promises have been bestowed on us so
[2:07:38] that through these you might become
[2:07:40] partakers of a divine nature having fled
[2:07:44] away from the corruption that is in the
[2:07:47] world through lust verse 5 this is
[2:07:51] important and for this very thing also
[2:07:54] using all diligence the scripture I mean
[2:07:58] an emphatic dog - exactly it says
[2:08:01] superhead right there says and beside
[2:08:06] this giving all diligence add to your
[2:08:07] faith virtue but in an emphatic dr.
[2:08:10] Bagla it says super add to your faith
[2:08:15] fortitude hallelujah so when it uses the
[2:08:19] word virtue in the Amen in the King
[2:08:21] James and emphatic doctors use the word
[2:08:24] fortitude super add to your faith
[2:08:28] fortitude and to fortitude knowledge
[2:08:31] verse 6 and to knowledge self-control my
[2:08:37] god we don't get into that we ain't
[2:08:39] there yet but to your knowledge you must
[2:08:42] add self-control what good would it be
[2:08:45] to have all this head knowledge and
[2:08:47] can't control yourself so to your
[2:08:52] knowledge you must add self-control and
[2:08:55] notice that our actual set it's super
[2:08:58] add to knowledge self-control and a
[2:09:02] self-control patience of the patience
[2:09:04] piety to party brother Conor brotherly
[2:09:07] kindness and to brotherly kindness love
[2:09:09] now I love that that statement of super
[2:09:12] add I was looking at that and it means
[2:09:15] to add something to what it's already
[2:09:18] been in it super admins to add something
[2:09:22] to what has already been added that's
[2:09:24] why you know it was important that first
[2:09:26] quote that I read to you that when
[2:09:28] you're born again you already have faith
[2:09:32] you're not adding to it but you're super
[2:09:34] adding oh my you're adding something to
[2:09:38] something that's already there
[2:09:40] Oh hallelujah
[2:09:43] that is that's powerful to me because
[2:09:46] the devil would like to tell you that
[2:09:47] you ain't got it
[2:09:49] you failed here you fail there and you
[2:09:53] ain't got it super and when it run out
[2:09:58] go back to the resource that gets along
[2:10:01] when Jesus felt virtual leave somehow
[2:10:04] virtue got back in there for him to go
[2:10:06] to Jerry's house come on somebody so
[2:10:11] when you feel like the devil I mean not
[2:10:13] the devil but maybe God has used you and
[2:10:15] maybe maybe when these virtues have been
[2:10:17] tested in and maybe somebody's pulled
[2:10:19] I've drawn this out of you God will put
[2:10:21] it back in if you feed yourself a lot of
[2:10:26] time this is what happened as we go
[2:10:28] through trial the first thing we do is
[2:10:29] run from church we run from the Word of
[2:10:32] God no I mean the way you've got ad is
[2:10:35] by our super address by by by feeding
[2:10:38] yourself on the Word of God
[2:10:40] sometimes you feed yourself you might
[2:10:42] get rebuked by a prophet nothing wrong
[2:10:46] with that let me go a little further
[2:10:48] oh my fortitude it says add to your your
[2:10:53] it says super add to super add to your
[2:10:57] faith fortitude into fortitude knowledge
[2:10:59] so we're using that word fortitude we're
[2:11:02] using that word fortitude it's also in
[2:11:04] our King James says virtue but I'm
[2:11:07] pulling from the emphatic Diagon today
[2:11:09] and I'm using the word fortitude when we
[2:11:11] when we just give a definition a man of
[2:11:14] a virtue its strength its power it's its
[2:11:19] ability a man also when we when we look
[2:11:23] at brother Branham said in one place
[2:11:24] virtue is strength power that's what he
[2:11:27] said in the church's book it's its
[2:11:28] strength I mean I'm sorry in the statue
[2:11:29] of a burger man he said its strength
[2:11:31] power that's what virtue is but I'm also
[2:11:33] using this definition a man from of
[2:11:38] of my fortitude be encouraged its having
[2:11:43] courage in pain or adversity fortitude
[2:11:47] or virtue would be having courage in
[2:11:49] pain or adversity having courage and
[2:11:52] pain or adversity now let me just read
[2:11:55] here you know I think of a couple people
[2:11:58] that we could look at but I want to go
[2:11:59] back to second chronicles a man we're
[2:12:02] gonna read from their chapter 13 but I
[2:12:05] think of one one man that had virtue and
[2:12:08] a man and had courage he had fortitude
[2:12:11] was Gideon he was called a mighty man of
[2:12:13] Valor and what that meant he had
[2:12:15] boldness or determination and facing
[2:12:17] great danger
[2:12:18] he had boldness or determination when he
[2:12:21] was facing great danger especially in
[2:12:24] battle he had heroic courage bravery
[2:12:27] David could also be considered this
[2:12:29] category Samson with a jawbone that man
[2:12:33] that take courage to stand up there face
[2:12:34] of thousand Philistines with a jawbone
[2:12:37] hallelujah it take courage you know and
[2:12:41] look if Samson can do that with a
[2:12:43] jawbone and overcome I don't know what
[2:12:45] you're facing a man gotta get in your
[2:12:48] jawbone if God if God needs you to use a
[2:12:51] jawbone God will get in your jawbone
[2:12:53] brother branham say one hit against one
[2:12:56] of them one of them he'll miss it
[2:12:58] should've broke the jump on the first
[2:12:59] time he hit it if it would have broke
[2:13:02] the jawbone
[2:13:03] I believe Samson could have used his
[2:13:05] hands and still beat down a thousand
[2:13:08] Philistines that's why I said Michelle
[2:13:11] something that last week what's that you
[2:13:13] got in your hand God can use it if
[2:13:19] you're willing to lose him take take not
[2:13:22] not not not a lot but take the little
[2:13:25] you have
[2:13:27] and God will make it crane come on
[2:13:31] church man I'm encouraging myself I
[2:13:35] might have a little but my god it's able
[2:13:38] to multiply and you'll make it grand oh
[2:13:44] my he's el shaddai he's all that we need
[2:13:47] he needs us to depend on him get rid of
[2:13:49] Plan B God we only got one plan you
[2:13:54] hallelujah it took it took fortitude
[2:13:58] virtues strength power for some of these
[2:14:02] people to face some of the challenges
[2:14:04] that they face I just read to you about
[2:14:06] awesome but I had a father by the name
[2:14:14] of Abijah Abijah and he's my example
[2:14:21] when we talk about war strategies virtue
[2:14:23] he's the one I want to use as my example
[2:14:26] today of a man that had hurt you yet
[2:14:29] strength he had grit he had
[2:14:32] determination he had courage yeah power
[2:14:35] can I tell you something you might be
[2:14:37] going through something don't run from
[2:14:39] it run to it amen
[2:14:42] oftentimes when you know what I want to
[2:14:45] face it no no no dude you're not showing
[2:14:47] fur to not showing courage you're not
[2:14:49] showing run to this thing oh my god
[2:14:53] it might cause a little death to
[2:14:55] yourself but you know unless a corner
[2:14:57] week go on the ground and die it will
[2:14:59] abide alone I want to say that again
[2:15:02] unless your corner week goes into the
[2:15:05] ground and dies it will abide alone the
[2:15:09] reason that some of us are alone is
[2:15:11] because we won't put our corner wheat in
[2:15:12] the ground and no I don't think y'all
[2:15:16] hear me your situation won't change
[2:15:19] until you take your corner wheat into

[2:21:54] die and see the thing what is it wasn't
[2:21:57] that he died for what he did he actually
[2:22:01] died for what he didn't do and what he
[2:22:05] didn't do was stay home I want to talk
[2:22:14] about a bi job this man is asses father
[2:22:20] he demonstrated total
[2:22:24] total dependence on God forwarded to
[2:22:28] virtue while he was in battle the other
[2:22:31] thing is he's fighting against he's
[2:22:34] representing Judah which the children
[2:22:36] Israel they were they were one under
[2:22:39] Solomon I mean under under David and
[2:22:41] under Solomon but when Solomon died the
[2:22:43] children Israel split all right you got
[2:22:45] two kingdoms you got the children Israel
[2:22:47] didn't get with children Judah
[2:22:48] underneath ray of bones ring I'm talking
[2:22:51] by boy I hope y'all with me today
[2:22:53] all right so so so so now what we have
[2:22:55] here is an issue the children of Judah
[2:22:59] are under a by just rain but the
[2:23:02] children of Israel on the share of bones
[2:23:05] ring I'll stay with me here watch this
[2:23:06] here's a battle getting ready to take
[2:23:09] place abaya
[2:23:10] the king of Judah has four hundred
[2:23:13] thousand warriors a man but Jeroboam
[2:23:17] knew he had more warriors because there
[2:23:19] was more trottin more tribes underneath
[2:23:21] his reign he came to the battle with
[2:23:23] eight hundred thousand warriors and it's
[2:23:27] already sound like a problem but let's
[2:23:29] read this is Scripture oh I love this I
[2:23:34] love this second chronicles thirteen
[2:23:45] verse eight a by just actually speaking
[2:23:51] to Jeroboam and the children Israel
[2:23:54] before they actually intend to this
[2:23:56] battle it says now you think to
[2:23:59] withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the
[2:24:02] hand of the sons of David and he'd be a
[2:24:04] great multitude and there with you
[2:24:07] golden calves which Jeroboam ate you for
[2:24:09] God's now what initially what he was
[2:24:13] telling him God established the kingdom
[2:24:15] of David God promised David that he'd
[2:24:18] always have somebody on the throne
[2:24:20] somebody in his lineage would always be
[2:24:22] on the throne and here a visor is in
[2:24:24] there and he's saying God said these
[2:24:25] things I'm not just only stone just
[2:24:27] because I want to be here but God said
[2:24:29] these things God is doing this right so
[2:24:32] so so he's there talking and he said now
[2:24:34] now you all have already forsaken God
[2:24:36] y'all already feel sick God and then
[2:24:38] it's a neat thing you gotta go in he's
[2:24:40] gonna go and just kind of tell him a few
[2:24:41] things that they've done he says now on
[2:24:43] you coming against me and you got you
[2:24:46] got golden calves and you miss now that
[2:24:47] mean you got Idol gods in your midst and
[2:24:49] you're trying to tell me something and
[2:24:51] you want to come fight against me and
[2:24:52] you got Idol gods in your myths and now
[2:24:55] remember this is this is brother to
[2:24:57] brother fighting this is this is this is
[2:25:00] the nation of Israel that's divided but
[2:25:03] it's probably the brother and he said
[2:25:04] not now we've got the priests we still
[2:25:07] following the laws of God
[2:25:09] y'all got golden calves and idols you
[2:25:11] know what God did to the children of
[2:25:13] Israel and in the days of Moses you know
[2:25:15] what happened and y'all went right back
[2:25:17] to all of that now now stay with me here
[2:25:19] look if look at this man Abijah first
[2:25:21] thing I like about him is for the tools
[2:25:22] that he stand with the word that's one
[2:25:25] thing he stand with the word look at
[2:25:27] this look at this verse 9 he not cast
[2:25:31] out the priests of the Lord
[2:25:34] Jeroboam actually put the priests out of
[2:25:36] this of the city these are people that
[2:25:39] God established to handle the holy
[2:25:41] things of God
[2:25:42] this man has put them out he says have
[2:25:45] you not cast out the priests of the Lord
[2:25:47] the sons of Aaron and the Levites and
[2:25:49] have major priests after the man of the
[2:25:52] nations of other lands so they make
[2:25:54] their own priests they're not following
[2:25:55] you know people can still do that today
[2:25:57] they make
[2:25:58] to church and they don't that you know
[2:26:00] oh my oh my
[2:26:02] and and just let one person in the
[2:26:04] family be call hello there's some going
[2:26:09] that church there light no one person
[2:26:11] they found this call guess what just
[2:26:13] happened

[2:26:37] got back that did not call in order to
[2:26:39] be a priest in Israel you had to be born
[2:26:40] into this lineage but they're making
[2:26:43] these men preach this because they have
[2:26:45] a certain offering look at it look at it
[2:26:47] verse 10
[2:26:48] I love Abijah but as for us the Lord is
[2:26:55] like God we're not serving a golden
[2:26:57] calves I'm not like that the Lord is our
[2:26:59] God
[2:26:59] this is fortitude this is strength this
[2:27:02] is virtue this man got this man is this
[2:27:05] man this man got something but that's
[2:27:07] what the Lord is our God and we have not
[2:27:09] forsaken him and the priest which
[2:27:11] medicine to the Lord are the sons of
[2:27:14] Aaron and the Levites wait upon their
[2:27:16] business let's keep going and they
[2:27:18] burned into the Lord every morning and
[2:27:19] every even these are the things that
[2:27:21] Moses established and they said we found
[2:27:23] them in the Word of God hallelujah
[2:27:24] sometimes you got to be able to remind
[2:27:26] God I'm following standing there with
[2:27:40] fortitude don't back up
[2:27:43] hallelujah somebody look look say you
[2:27:45] say say say they brining them to the
[2:27:47] Lord every morning every evening burnt
[2:27:49] sacrifices sweet incense the showbread
[2:27:51] also set there in order upon the pure
[2:27:53] table and the candlestick of gold with
[2:27:55] the lamps therefore thereof to burn
[2:27:58] every every evening for we keep the
[2:28:00] charge of the Lord I got but ye have
[2:28:03] forsaken him it says in behold God
[2:28:08] Himself is with us for our captain I
[2:28:12] want to know who's leading you this
[2:28:13] morning who is your captain
[2:28:15] God Himself is with us for our captain
[2:28:20] this man is talking remember his arm is
[2:28:21] twice - twice as small as the other army
[2:28:24] but yea he's keeping this thing
[2:28:26] aligned with the Word of God we're doing
[2:28:29] things according to the Word of God and
[2:28:31] if I'm doing things according to the
[2:28:33] Word of God than I expect God to back up
[2:28:36] what I'm doing let's go let's go let's
[2:28:40] go verse verse 12 well God Himself is
[2:28:43] with us for our captain and it's priest
[2:28:46] with sounding trumpets the cry alarm
[2:28:48] against you O children Israel fight here
[2:28:51] not against the Lord God of your
[2:28:53] father's for he shall not prosper see
[2:28:54] now you coming against us but you're not
[2:28:57] fighting us you fighting God that's what
[2:29:01] he's trying to get him see I love Abijah
[2:29:03] he goes on and look at this verse 13 now
[2:29:07] while he's talking while a by just
[2:29:10] reminding them of all these things that
[2:29:12] they've done wrong look at this
[2:29:15] but Jeroboam calls an ambushment to come
[2:29:21] about behind them so they were before
[2:29:24] Judah and the ambushment was behind them
[2:29:28] now I don't know about you you might be
[2:29:30] facing something where you don't I mean
[2:29:32] here you were facing this and all of a
[2:29:34] sudden something else just come out of
[2:29:36] nowhere and you wonder where in the
[2:29:41] world that come from and you wonder how
[2:29:44] in the world am I gonna get through this
[2:29:45] not if I get over this mountain
[2:29:48] I got another mountain facing me and and
[2:29:51] then Lord I don't even I have no idea
[2:29:53] what to do in the midst of this God I'm
[2:29:58] I'm confused I thought you were with me
[2:30:02] but you allowing all these things they
[2:30:04] hit me at one time
[2:30:05] I got I got I just got as I read this
[2:30:10] the first thing came to my mind when I
[2:30:12] read this here here here Abijah is
[2:30:15] spinning there
[2:30:16] amen declaring these things about God
[2:30:18] and how they've been serving God and now
[2:30:20] the enemy has him surrounded can I just
[2:30:24] say it like this it may look like
[2:30:27] because if you just stopped at verse 13
[2:30:30] it may look like I'm surrounded
[2:30:34] but I'm surrounded by you no matter
[2:30:37] here's the thing as we go forward we're
[2:30:40] gonna see what they did I said this
[2:30:42] earlier I said this early this is why
[2:30:44] I'm it's up to me I didn't I didn't
[2:30:45] catch it while I was studying but it
[2:30:47] came to me while I was here you know
[2:30:49] we're gonna leave this earth shouting do
[2:30:53] you know how amen
[2:30:56] Joshua with him overcame Jericho they
[2:31:00] let out a great shout hallelujah we're
[2:31:04] gonna find out that a bank shot the way
[2:31:07] today overcame in this battle is they
[2:31:09] also let out a shout now here's the
[2:31:12] thing with me my my my my my my
[2:31:15] interpretation of shouting might be
[2:31:18] different than what the scripture is
[2:31:20] actually stating amen they might be
[2:31:23] saying just raise your voice and I'm
[2:31:25] okay with that too
[2:31:26] don't come to church with your switcher
[2:31:29] with your your shower please come to
[2:31:31] church with your loud has multiple
[2:31:39] meanings
[2:31:57] [Applause]
[2:32:04] look at this first 14 and when Judah
[2:32:11] looked back behold the battle was before
[2:32:16] and behind the Bible says and they cried
[2:32:20] unto the Lord I mean they start praying
[2:32:25] and when they when they did that then
[2:32:26] the priests sound it with the trumpets
[2:32:31] next verse the men of Judah gave up gave
[2:32:37] a shout that I wonder when's the last
[2:32:39] time you just gave a shout not not
[2:32:43] because you so something that God did
[2:32:46] but just something that you want to do
[2:32:49] for God God I'm coming today even if
[2:32:55] they don't sing my song I'm gonna give
[2:32:57] you a shout I'm gonna grab a hold of
[2:32:59] check I just had to come give God a
[2:33:05] shout I'm not anything in those shout
[2:33:09] music but sound sometimes they show the
[2:33:20] devil his place
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:23] right I think the devil get a headache
[2:33:27] because he's under your feet right I
[2:33:31] believe he get a headache when you begin
[2:33:33] to like I told you the words can have
[2:33:38] multiple meanings it could be a movement
[2:33:40] of the feet or it could be raising your
[2:33:42] voice or whatever let out a shot
[2:33:45] sometime come to church with that that
[2:33:51] that that quiet voice the dignified one
[2:33:55] come come with the shout what are the
[2:33:58] last time you dig God
[2:34:01] I just want to give a shout out to tell
[2:34:12] about yeah man I came no you made it a
[2:34:19] church
[2:34:25] this-this-this man the men of Judah gave
[2:34:29] a shout and notice this description as
[2:34:34] the men of Judah shouted so it's why you
[2:34:38] shot me God is moving not why you know
[2:34:49] why you let me tell you when you get in
[2:34:52] action God get in action
[2:34:56] it has the minute you to shout it it
[2:35:00] came to pass that God smote terrible and
[2:35:05] all Israel before a be job and Judah
[2:35:10] here's another one they not even faint
[2:35:13] they just showed up to the battle God
[2:35:17] did the fighting because they had enough
[2:35:19] fortitude enough virtue to stand there
[2:35:24] amen and faced a thing that they were
[2:35:26] facing keeping it aligned with the Word
[2:35:29] of God
[2:35:30] look we've done this we've done that
[2:35:32] we're doing this so you can have virtue
[2:35:35] when you when you when you're standing
[2:35:36] like that god I know what I've done fast
[2:35:40] and I'm praying I'm this God I'm doing
[2:35:42] everything that you asked me to do and
[2:35:44] this devil still coming against me all
[2:35:51] the thing I know I'm gonna be defeated
[2:35:54] I can't tell you how I come through this
[2:35:56] thing but I'm gonna stand here and
[2:36:00] because I'm going through don't mean I'm
[2:36:02] a quick church I told you you know you
[2:36:09] might be able to take this and you might
[2:36:11] be able to take that but you're gonna
[2:36:12] take my praise God been too good to me I
[2:36:19] don't know about what he's done for you
[2:36:21] but I'm talking about for me he'd been
[2:36:24] too good to me for me to let the devil
[2:36:28] take my face my brother Jean tell us all
[2:36:34] the time tell us that story about the
[2:36:36] husband and wife and it was fussing and
[2:36:39] fighting before they come into the
[2:36:42] church I said the wife was just a little
[2:36:50] trouble she just just couldn't really
[2:36:53] enter into service because of what had
[2:36:55] just happened at the house or in the car
[2:36:57] and the husband came to church in glory
[2:37:00] just worshiping and praising God he's
[2:37:03] done he's going out of his way to praise
[2:37:05] God yelling screaming and pollen and the
[2:37:10] wife just sitting there looking at him
[2:37:11] and then after church they get in the
[2:37:15] car and she like how could you be in
[2:37:19] church to another yelling screaming
[2:37:21] knowing what you and I just went through
[2:37:24] you know the reason I can do this
[2:37:28] because Jesus didn't do nothin to me you
[2:37:34] did
[2:37:36] and since he didn't do not to me I'm not
[2:37:39] gonna let emotional leakage seep out of
[2:37:45] our situation and block me from freezing
[2:37:50] now that don't mean you don't need to go
[2:37:53] back and try to fix them thanks but
[2:37:56] don't let the devil take your praise in
[2:37:58] the midst of it what I'm saying I'm
[2:38:01] gonna give him no victory I praise them
[2:38:06] what I'm going through
[2:38:07] I'm gonna have some fortitude I'm have
[2:38:10] some virtue my has some strength i'ma
[2:38:12] stand right here
[2:38:13] and I'ma worship God virtue is strength
[2:38:18] power do you still got strength to be
[2:38:21] able to praise them when you're going
[2:38:22] through got to have it
[2:38:30] that's the character Christ that we
[2:38:32] talking about and when you got that
[2:38:34] people be looking for that from you
[2:38:36] brother branham made the statement how
[2:38:39] Reverend mr. Linley he had to have
[2:38:44] virtue they say he say everything come
[2:38:47] to take from Reverend mr. Lilley and and
[2:38:49] sometimes they you know what every time
[2:38:51] I turn around this one taken from me
[2:38:52] that when taken from me that would take
[2:38:55] yeah that's the way it's supposed to be
[2:38:57] but what do you really looking for is
[2:38:59] the spiritual things from here you say
[2:39:02] Reverend mr. Lilley always said when
[2:39:03] they come in and take this from him take
[2:39:05] that one from he see he just he give to
[2:39:07] the first man and he just willingly give
[2:39:09] to the next one and Willie he just keep
[2:39:11] giving the everybody that come and get
[2:39:13] some but that little e you got to
[2:39:15] understand something about the lily it
[2:39:18] just it just just didn't pop up the
[2:39:21] overnight it didn't pop up they
[2:39:25] overnight it had to go through some
[2:39:27] stuff underneath the water see some
[2:39:31] things that folk going through right now
[2:39:32] you can't see because on the top they
[2:39:35] look good but underneath they've really
[2:39:38] facing some stuff
[2:39:40] hallelujah but underneath that water
[2:39:43] underneath them it's not just water but
[2:39:45] it's mucking my room and clean and I
[2:39:49] mean it's just it's just nasty stuff
[2:39:51] it's got the workers way Sun constantly
[2:39:55] hitting it wise in that condition and
[2:39:57] drawing the lily to the top and once it
[2:40:05] gets to the top everything come to get
[2:40:08] it and maybe the reason you go on
[2:40:11] through what you're going through
[2:40:12] because you might see yourself
[2:40:15] underneath but maybe you already own
[2:40:18] time
[2:40:34] [Applause]
[2:40:37] Laurie
[2:40:38] [Applause]
[2:40:42] that's it that's the shout even when
[2:40:51] you're going through letter shouts like
[2:40:54] that because why you situation and you
[2:41:02] begin to church
[2:41:19] [Music]
[2:41:24] [Applause]
[2:41:36] [Applause]
[2:41:59] this word is real this were to pull us
[2:42:04] out of whatever it is that we have
[2:42:06] remind God obligor remind it this is
[2:42:12] what we've done

[2:42:17] offerings they're doing everything

[2:42:20] serve a living God
