if you turn to your Bibles there we're going to take uh first Peter four and five amen just want to read real quick so you can have your seats Amen in the presence of the Lord first Peter fifth chapter I'm sorry first Peter fifth chapter the fifth verse first Peter the fifth chapter the fifth verse amen I heard we had some visitors and God bless you it's good to have you with us today amen so good to see everybody out today amen well read on this wise uh it says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he cares for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settles you to him be the glory and Dominion forever and ever amen amen you may be seated amen I just want to take my time here if that's all right you know when uh Pastor Cayman and he told me uh he want me to preach this uh Father's Day I told him I said man I don't know if I can do that that's going to be hard for me because today is my dad's birthday I said I said Jack I don't I don't know what man he said you could do it I say man I don't want to be up there crying all over the people mess up the mic and everything he said he said get your message out you can cry all you want after that I said all right I said okay I'll accept it not knowing that the tears that I've shared this morning wasn't so much for my dad but my mama God is good God is good I have to share the testimony uh on Wednesday night they were saying that tomorrow which would be that Thursday that they would have to go in and do surgery and uh the doctor came in and he explained everything to my sisters who were there and uh say well you know it's going to be risky and uh he just did not leave a real good report kind of left I'm gonna do the best I can uh but there's a long you know he just went into some things and had everybody kind of shook up a little bit so I uh I didn't want to go up there right then everyone was there I didn't what I had to do I didn't want a whole lot of people there so I was supposed to go into work that night and my boss is on vacation so I called him on vacation and say listen I'm not going to be there on time I said I'll make it Lord will it but I'm gonna I I got something I have to do so we came on here to Bible study and and let me let me let me stop here and say God bless you brother Jerry what a marvelous message on Wednesday night he kind of just took the whole thing I was hoping to get up and do some commenting because I had a little bit of the excerpt message I wanted to go with behind that that brother preached us so well I was like man I got something to say he wouldn't let me get up here that's a good thing he just has keep it back I got it from here I said okay brother because boy I was fitting to come behind you on that one so I left here and uh I went up to the hospital and it was just me and Mama I said well Ma they say they gonna do surgery now Mama tested them I'ma be all right I say I believe you I I stand in faith with you but and so it happened if it happened is your soul ready to meet Jesus see the healing of your body is one thing but the healing of your soul is a is another thing you know in times of trouble like that people quote Isaiah 55 but you have to understand that that's a dual atonement what good would it do to raise you up healthy amen and you lose your soul if if it's going to save your soul I'd rather him take you now so I began to just speak with her there laying in that hospital bed and I say she said honey I repented but I don't know if God accept my repentance I say mama the only thing that worketh repentance is a real Godly sorrow you can say stuff with your mouth as much as you want to but unless there's a sorrow in your heart it means nothing so much for these dry eye confessions you just saying stuff but is it from your heart to where it's not you you you got to get desperate with God you got to mean it in this hour say mama you going under in the morning we don't know what's gonna isn't right let me tell you something thank God my mama got the ring in her hands I thought she was gonna hop off that hospital bed ringing her hands tears flowing from my eyes and say God I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord I've done so much I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and just weeping and crying and Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I say that's it Mama she weeping I'm weeping the nurse weeping everybody on the floor here say Lord what's going on in there for the next two hours we pray she in the bed I'm in the corner on the floor my God we need you right now Lord I I wouldn't I say mama I'm not going to stop praying until I feel a release in my spirit then I can go to work with peace and I thank God I say Lord I feel I feel your presence Lord I feel your presence Lord so we went on to work the next morning and my sisters and everybody was there so when they willed off to surgery my sister was crying and the last thing she said is hunted on where God got me and I'm just happy to say that she went through the surgery and came out of the ICU within those one day and have a picture of her sitting up in her hospital bed smiling [Applause] I say God you are a mighty God I thank you Lord so before brother Jack left we both went up there and he said I he was telling her about the church and he said I look forward to seeing you in church so your purpose is your protection [Laughter] so I'm looking forward to AI New Church and B to see my mama walk through the doors [Applause] so I thought I'd be weeping over my daddy but my mama got these teals I thank God amen for what he's doing I talked to her and I say you need to be a witness uh for your girls and I told my sister what mama said about coming to church and she said the day Mama come to your church I'm gonna be right by our side [Applause] I said you ain't got to challenge God cause he'll meet the challenge [Applause] [Laughter] he'll meet the challenge amen you love the Lord I'm going to start out right with the quote here amen I believe today amen we have a Divine appointment somebody here has a Divine appointment you know speaking on these things everybody has a appointed time when they'll leave this earth it will either leave it by the grave or we'll be raptured away but everybody has a an appointment we don't know the day nor the hour amen but uh we live for Jesus while we can but there's also another appointed day in our lives in the lives of the Believers it's an appointed time an appointed day amen when uh uh uh you hear from your theophany there's an appointed time and appointed day where it's your day amen where God uh uh uh uh uh uh rings in your ear touches your heart to where your change takes place is this your appointed time it's once a time for a man to be born and then the man to be born again then die and from this Earth because once you're born of that second time you never die amen death is no longer come to you because see life means or death means to be eternally separated from God where amen once you're born again you'll never be separated that's the life that we want so today I pray that someone has a Divine appointment when you meet God for yourself I'm not talking about reading about him in the book I'm not talking about someone telling you something about the dirty old father on the throne I'm talking about a day when your heart is pricked and you say what must I do to be saved Change Me O Lord From Within I'm tired of living the way I've been living I'm tired of going that old way there's nothing else more important because I'ma tell you something your day is coming the old folks used to say payday is coming after a while payday is coming after a while amen yeah bear with me this technology I don't think there it is didn't recognize my glasses I guess I open it up hey man I'm going to move this to the side because I got it all right here amen I want to start out with a quote oh in times signed seed uh 6203 19 I hope it's the same one as E28 paragraph E28 and it reads I'm going to speak of a man by the name of job for a few moments he says that's the oldest book in the Bible we understand that job was one of the wisest men in the world of his day why he said when he go to the markets the young princes would bow before him for wisdom he was a great man and I'll stop right there we looking at job here let us go to the scripture Revelation I've read this several times in the recent future or a recent past I should say Revelation 21 3 and 4. Revelation the 21st chapter the third through the fourth verse it says I heard a great voice Out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain now I want you to notice here for these that shall be no more death sorrow crying and pain for the former things are passed away now there are many different types of Sorrows and disappointments in this human life we go through sufferings we go through crying there's many different uh uh levels and different types of pain amen a child could die that is a pain that that that that that that is tremendous apparent loved one a friend these things cause us great pain we see in job it says that he was a upright man I remember someone asking me a question one time that said why does bad things happen to good people and I think I responded well why does good things happen to bad people [Music] see so I can scope and it's bad things sometimes happen to good people for the glory of God simply for God's glory because as we look at the story of job here just for a little bit and we see that job went through great pain he lost his children now a lot of times when we see that lost that can go a compound meaning they could have that literally died amen but see to be separated from God is also a type of death he lost all of his livestock and his cattle so sometimes we go through pain if we of loss when we lose possession we may lose a job and and feel like Lord why me what I mean Joel also suffered the pain of rejection his friends turned his back on him even his servants and things that he had in his house uh he called and they they just had no respect for him anymore imagine Joe they are saying what have I done to deserve this now remember he went from from from from from from one end to the other Spectrum well he'll just walk in the streets and the prince is a bow to him Joe give us some wisdom now to the old all the way to the other end of the spectrum even his wife in the Bible says that that my breast is strange to my wife now I want you to read between the lines that means she cut him off didn't want nothing to do with him job so got to the point where he uh uh on the ass sheet not to mention that then the devil attacked his body he was suffering physical pain I can imagine those boils on his body was quite painful so Joe Knows something about pain everybody in here knows something about pain no something when you just all you can do is cry maybe a divorce or a betrayal what did I do Lord to deserve this weeping songwriter said he bottles up every tip amen so pain disappointment rejection is a part of this life everyone within the sound of my voice has experienced it but I thank God he said he'll wipe away every chair there'll be no more pain no more sorrow no more Hardy amen but while we're here on this side that pain in that heartache for a purpose that pain and those things that we go through is what drives us to God amen I forgot to mention this is a Father's day did I say Happy Father's Day this message is for everybody but I kind of get it for fathers for fathers for the men Folk brother smiling on Mother's Day gave their sisters a real good message but this one is for us but I hope the sisters get something out of it as well so because see sometimes as men we we we we man we we we we we we go through some things and you know what about men we internalize it and we hold it behold it see because because God has has charged us amen uh uh uh to be rulers and leaders we supposed to have all the answers sometimes we don't sometimes we could just we just crying out Lord give me the answer show me what to do here so job found himself Amen in a position where he just couldn't explain what was going on amen he was uh a man of great means and a man of great substance that everything was just going haywire in his life people begin to accuse them of things but Joe in the midst of the trial God gave him a revelation in the midst of his rejection God gave him a revelation of the resurrection and job said yet in my flesh I shall see God I want you to understand that Joe through the rejection amen found that uh uh uh uh there will be a resurrection because see that was one of the things that he pounded on he said is that there's a tree uh uh living it it goes into the ground and dies and they come back and said what about men this was something that was on job's heart but through what he was going through God gave him a revelation through the rejection of the Resurrection one of the things that Satan said to to God when he was considering job he said I'll make him curse you to your face now those were some powerful words but those words had deep meaning because see only in this time and in this hour can a man Curse God to his face because see when you come face to face with God what that means is you come to the full revelation of who he is so let me tell you something that was a direct challenge to the Believers in this hour he said I'll make you curse God to his face see that one for any other age because they didn't have the face amen they were seeking to God amen but in this day and in this time we had a Prophet come amen and those angels came in 1962 revealing the four Ministry revealing the full revelation of Christ in this hour I may concursion to your face so when we going through these things and we're going through the trial what is that that's the same old Devil with the same old tactic trying to make you curse God to his face amen so we see Joe suffered rejection but God had confidence he told the devil he said you can touch his body you can touch all those things but don't touch his soul you can't touch your soul and I believe this morning amen that the same conversation goes on with God and the devil about you here this morning amen he put boundaries on the devil and say you can't touch his soul so what you're going through the pains and The Agony and the stress amen of this life amen hang in there be steadfast be like Joe no matter what you take me through I'm gonna trust God even unto death I'm gonna trust God [Applause] I refuse to curse God to his face he is my redeemer amen I want I want to look at another Soldier this morning amen a man who who who who I'm showing you job man who did nothing wrong but sometimes we do wrong and I want to show you a man a man who might have done wrong ain't no might have he he I'm talking about Jacob just a mere name means a Deceiver liar shyster amen but Jacob had a promise even from the womb the Bible says Jacob have I loved and Esau I hate it why because Jacob had a hunger for the birthright amen and he was persistent but Jacob as a bad fella he'll lie to his mama Daddy and anybody else now this man did some wrong he wasn't like Joel he deserved what he got but you can't touch his soul even in his wrong doing Jacob have I loved her and I see most people look at that I just don't understand that but you don't understand the foreknowledge of God why because you have the inability to read between the lines of the scripture it takes a prophetic anointing to read between the lines amen when we read the message books and we read the Bible what are we doing we're reading between the lines and when I remember one time when the prophet was explaining David he said some little redhead curly head boy I say wow how did he know that we're reading between the lines most people look at the story of David and thought that he must have been some powerful man strong big muscles some little he called Samson a little curly head you would think that his Guy picked up defense in the gates and slew all kind of Philistines and went to the pillars and pushed down the post that he was some big strong man no just some little fella but he had a call but he had a call he had a vowel amen a Nazarite vow so we look here at Jacob Jacob had done all kind of things amen and he was on the run because he had done tricked his father into the birthright and that Saul was a man a man's man he was a great hunter and and and and and and a good Hunter no you know he can do certain things with that boring Arrow know how to stick that deer where he ain't running a whole lot get him right to vital organs put that Arrow right on his spine and break his spine while he dropped right where he at and he knew this about Saul Saucy I'mma kill him he took my Birthright no doubt Jacob was scared took off I gotta go he go he gonna kill me but Jacob had a promise let me tell you something my brothers and sisters God don't make a promise he don't make empty promises when he make a promise there's someone to receive the promise yeah he not just making blank promises and throwing in the air the who no he already know who he making a promise to amen amen when I stood at the altar tomorrow what Dad my wife we got mad I know who I was making a promise to Jacob didn't the first time got tricked got tricked but he stayed there until he got the one he wanted I jingle something else see what happens what you do or come back on you what you do will come back on you amen sin got to be paid for I say sin got to be paid for but the thing I want to get you to see here is Jacob he had an appointed and a Divine appointment he got to a point that one day he got tired of running so he told all of his servants and and all of them to say y'all go ahead I got to deal with this today I'm tired of running I got my wife here the one I wanted I want to just settle down and quit running but Esau still after me after all these years so he went back amen and he had he had a talk with Jesus and you see in this life the point that I want to get across to you is that you have to amen nothing is going to save you outside of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now it's all right it's good quote the sinner's prayer and and everything but you have to go all the way with God amen you have to be hungry in this hour for the baptism of the Holy Spirit amen we don't want to serve God out of tradition many people today are caught up in serving God out of tradition just because you come to church that's that that that that that that ain't it why are you going to church see once you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you'll do more than just come to church you get your heart prepared for service in the morning Amen on Wednesday night services you'll you see what the announcements are made amen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say I got to get to Bible study with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you put away a lot of those excuses because you realize there's nothing else more important and sometimes a lot of us we've been saved a while and we find ourselves getting a little relaxed the Bible says that there's also a refilling of the Holy Ghost sometimes we get a little slowful about God and then sometimes we get a little weak in our flesh amen we need something to charge us up we don't want to lose the sincerity in this hour because he's still a roaring lion now amen and there's still trouble on the horizon you want to keep yourself in a place Lord that I can deal with it let me explain that now I trust me when I say I pr when when these ministers get up here I could speak for myself and I think I speak for my brothers a lot of times when we are coming up with these messages and the Lord give us the auction to say things we can cut too but we ain't no greater than you this is just a lot that I'm placed in at this time but it's a double-edged sword amen brothers and sisters don't get complacent about God you see Jacob Jacob had got to a point amen well you know he sound pretty safe over there in laban's Camp amen and he got just a little bit religious got a little bit complacent soon as he left he saw on his tail and he said this is it I'm tired tired of running so he had a talk with the angel Jacob wrestled with the angel Jacob got to a point and he said I'm not gonna let go till you bless my soul now I'm intentionally calling him Jacob because Jacob means a shyster he still had an old nature but Jacob fought and he fought and he held on all night long how many are willing to fight if it take all night long and say I won't let go till you bless my soul until you get it like that amen you're not gonna get it right amen amen Jacob said I died the Lord that angel blessed him and he said I'll no longer call you Jacob but I'll call you Israel Israel means blessed so he was no longer a shyster no longer a liar no longer a Deceiver he had taken on a whole new nature why because he had children see there's something about when you have children amen now to change a man remember a young man was having a child wife was in there in labor and I simply asked him one question I say do you feel that he said no I'm sorry I don't know what you're talking about I don't feel anything I say do you feel I say brother you feel it he said what are you talking about that heavy load that load of responsibility because I remember when I had my first my wife and I went to the hospital she was C-section and and and and we came in amen and uh I'm sorry did I say something ain't supposed to say I'm sorry okay I'm all right because you know how sometimes man we we don't know all right but the thing of it is is that there was a there was a whole when we came home with that little one there's a whole different it was a whole different Troy I couldn't wait to get up and go to work I couldn't wait to get up and go to work why because I had a little bundle of joy there that was dependent on me put food in the refrigerator Pampers on them clothes on them roof over his head flow on their feet make him comfortable amen it was my responsibility so I came home with a different attitude I mean I got to do something it was right after that I jumped into school jumped into school I got I I got I got to get Mo this ain't enough yeah I got to get some more that's what he'll depending on me then I have two moves come behind them I really felt the pressure oh Lord Jesus what am I gonna do Lord but the Lord will make a way amen he'll make a way amen so Jacob had a burden Amen to quit running he couldn't be that kind of father running with his children and he got and he held on now one of the things the most important thing I should say is the baptism of the Holy Ghost because see without the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's even with the Holy Ghost we're going to make mistakes but without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without leadership without the guidance of the great Shepherd man you're gonna make a mess you're gonna make a mess and have regrets but you know what feel able God is still evil even in your thoughts God is still able to deliver you your children your children's children your mama your auntie all that you love see cause you're not just fighting for you you're not just fighting for you God gave man Dominion and he gave man the responsibility responsibility and I'm going to talk about another man in the scripture amram was a Praying Soldier you see the children of Israel remember Jacob's name was turned to Israel so Jacob's children amen we know the story they went down into Egypt and was saved from the famine because his son Joseph was on the stone see even the the trouble that Jacob went through gave him rest through his body put his son on the throne in Egypt Amen to save the family yeah amen amen so now they hung out there in Egypt for a while and the Egyptian the pharaoh put all kind of burdens amen on Israel and uh they found themselves amen and and and quite a predicament if you turn uh there in teaching on Moses 5605-13 we're going to read between the lines this morning amen verse uh paragraph rather 77 he says and after a while she had supper already so she slipped upstairs and she calls amram and he said uh yes yoshibed Yoshi I think I'm pronouncing it right he says I'm coming down so they come down to the steps and know that they had a nice supper so after they had eaten supper a little boy and little girl had eaten all their supper why the mother uh put the things away and she took them to bed and then she goes into the room and her husband uh amrami sits down said well now what uh what that you saw today amram that made you so upset tonight that you didn't even want to live I see Adam Ram was going through some troubles he was bothered man kind of remind me a little bit of job there amen he said oh darling I just can't understand it he said I saw well we see it every day but today was especially said I sing the most awfullest sight I seen said our poor boys some of them not over 12 years old pulling those big old wagon and with ropes around their necks like that and those poor kids had pulled till they couldn't pull no more up that great big incline those big Stones back there and they couldn't uh go no further and after a while the wagon began to Creak in the in the old uh real Creek and go real slow and after a while it stopped but the road uh coming man but down the road come a man oh he was a maniac he wrote out why are you stopping this wagon Wham with those great big old snake whips and whip it across they back and the blood come running out of their back and run down like that those poor kids just hung on to the rope and cried said oh I said oh yoshabelle what can we do mother said we're the people of God God blessed us we're the children of Abraham Isaac and Jacob why will we have to be slaves down here why so amram was troubled amen so we understand that the Old Testament amen is a shadow and types of the things of the New Testament amen here in the Old Testament it's wagons and rocks and things that they're struggling with today is demonic spirits and you look today and see what the children are going through amen I'm talking to these fathers now see what these children are going through and it should just give you a righteous indignation why yoshima didn't see you see it every day we go to these jobs and different things amen and we'll Force the labor and work all day long but that is just a part of it amen what is the devil doing to this generation we are in the same day again seeing what the devil is doing and how he's waiting the children down with ropes of tethers upon their neck got them bound up in all kind of sin and foolishness they gotta understand they think they peaches and different things tell them that homosexuality is all right they confused it in their mind these are ropes around their necks making them work for the devil's Kingdom got them out here doing all kind of things rapping and doing these things not even thinking these are ropes got them working for the devil going uphill [Music] struggling straining but they don't know how to get free but old father amram talk to us I said what can we do what can we do to stop this he said oh it's terrible amen how those poor boys cried pray and pray and pray and yoshima seems like God just don't ever hear me I pray and I pray see sometimes see we go through seem like God just don't hear us see our children under the servant of the Taskmaster serving the devil amen but Abraham had his righteous dick nation stirred up now she said look imram that don't sound like you you are

faith in God he says oh but dear when I pray so much and still God don't hear me it seems like it just gets worse all the time how many can witness that the more and more I pray the more I try to teach I try to encourage I try to talk to it seem like it just get worse all the time but I want you to see who I am Ram any Daddy had a secret room way up where he went to pray so he gets up there

like Jacob he said I'd had enough have you had enough I'm talking to the daddies have you had enough are you willing to go wrestle with the angel on behalf of your children are you willing to go if it takes all night on behalf of your children amram did let's see what happened amen he says I'm going to pray maybe all night so he gets down on his knees and he says and he prays and he prays I see him lift up his hands and say oh god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob remember your promise to your people here we are way down here in Egypt under bondage and oh how cruel the task Masters are driving us to do things and beating us around our poor people are stripped naked and they're whipping us with wilts and where your people oh God surely you hear our prayer surely you'll answer our prayer and I pray

happen he can't have them but you see we cannot fight the devil with carnal means [Music] we can't yell at them we can't beat it out of them it's a spiritual battle we got to fight with the word of God and with prayer I'm not talking about some five minute Lord you know what I mean Lord you hit my heart you know the thoughts and no get in the bed lay your head on the pillow and say a quick prayer and fall off to sleep no I'm talking about get down in a secret place and have a conference with God let me tell you something I refuse to let that devil take my mama I say mama we gonna get in

down to business with God I'm not talking about just praying Lord give them a good job that's all good give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we got to get desperate about these children one of the most things that that affect my life I'll tell you this through trouble and different things God just has a way of moving you moving you where he wants you to be and one of the most tragic things of my childhood that I ever remember when my mother and father divorced I didn't know how to take it being a young man of only about seven eight years old but one thing I I clean me and my daddy were buddies I hung on to my daddy and I'm remember living there for a while with my grandmother amen and uh and uh uh my grandmother I would hear her every morning praying and let me tell you something about my Grandmama she was praying under this under this chair five o'clock in the morning religiously I here and there Lord Jesus calling names look on my children Lord look on my chair my grandchildren I mean for a good hour she in the calling on Jesus sometime I would wake up and I would sit at the outside of the door Grandma praying I can hear her when she get to my man I hear her call my name and that's something that always stuck with me I challenge you to pray let your children hear you call their name talking to myself too now I don't throw rock and hide my hand amen I want to be sincere with you amen we need to get down to business amen because the task Masters amen they are got these children in bondage they got adults in bondage let me tell you something the double a plan because it's getting late me and my wife was just talking about it it seemed like all around us is this one is getting sick this one is getting sick death is on this one death is on that one that's on now that's why oh my God Target Walmart everything is just where do you go I can't wait to get to church because all around me is wickedness and when I get to church amen around the Saints man I feel a little bit of reprieve I feel oh I I get charged up amen I say all have not given over to the devil there's some people that still love God amen and when the Saints begin to pray for the Lord to have his way the spirit of the Lord comes down I'd rather be here with the Saints than be with my family amen yes sir I've been saying that again I'd rather be in the company or the sanction to be with my family because all my family they say they got all kind of spirits on them I got to sit there and fight the devil the whole time Lord keep my mind Lord Lord God and then that devil recognize the spirit of God in Me and the whole time I'm there it's a fight it's in a battle amen this my spirit war with day spirits but when I come to church and I'm in the presence of saints somebody calling on the name of God Amen I feel Joy yes sir amen I fellow please yes sir I don't have to fight him we can just worship amen we can just worship give me strength now when I go back out there I could I got something to fight with [Music] I know I'm not alone man I know I'm not by myself and we all got battles we all have challenges we all going through something right we got the figure we have the victory I don't care what it looks like amen let me get my face down here so I can open this thing up amen that was up man I get home I'm gonna have to get my son to help me put the time on here a little longer amen but we see here hello amen that Devil's a lie got my hands shaking and everything I guess the devil don't want me to read it amen anyway we see your uh amram amen hold on what's wrong with this thing it won't even come up amen well we'll just go with it amen we see uh amram amen he had amen a job to do amen so he would go down uh into the basement the next day and he and he told uh his wife he come home from work amen he was especially upset this time so she said what's what's bothering you she say uh uh uh I Am ram I heard the most terrible news yo chabelle I turned the most terrible news you see that was a council meeting today and uh there was this one slick fella who stood up in the Council of me and he's saying uh we're gonna have to do something about uh these Israelites they have in too many children so he said another another old slickster stood up and say uh uh I gotta I got an idea we'll we'll take all of the all of the boy babies see the devil is after the children see if if I want you to put your spiritual thinking capsule he ain't got to kill them he can even let him go to church if I can just keep them away from this wood I said wood not word if I could keep them away from it it's all right with me so he devises all kind of schemes and tactics to kill the children now there they was talking about taking the children of two years old or younger and they grab them and they tie them up and they bash their heads up against the wall then you take the other ones you man then tie them up and thumb to feed the crocodiles amram was like you got to be kidding me not even to take our children kill him let me tell you something the devil is after your children today he do worse with bash the head against the wall turn them over to some vile disgusting devil have them out here acting all kind of unseemly get them tied up and dangled Tangled Up in some fossil Doctrine where they lose their identity put them up under bondage the worst kind of bondage is a religious bondage I say the worst kind of bondage is a religious bondage amen hard to preach to somebody who think they know just as much as you do you gotta leave him alone until God get him to a point where they ready to receive a lot of times that's laid up on their back and sometimes they still won't hear you in fact they know just as much as you do I ain't battling wits with you I'm telling you what God does for me telling you what I know I'm reading between the lines so amram was aware of this council meeting so he had a a more burden a heavier burden this time so amram goes up to pray and he said Lord I've been just praying and I'm praying and I'm praying and it's just getting worse Lord praying because there was nothing else he could do I can't raise up an army and start up fighting and overtake it and change the laws that Beast is too big but I only know one is bigger than that Beast that's you Lord so he began to tell god of the promises that they promised he's he would get down there and he would pray and pray all night long till he would come down and all your Chevelle felt so bad for him she said look at you you're getting pale you're getting weak I just swept together with tears and when was he wasn't down there playing he was there was a sincerity about his prayer there was a desperation about his prayer amen oh he kept praying so one day he went to work again out there serving the Taskmaster come on tired in that hot room they Prophet said he worked where he in the furnace area where they uh uh mold the bricks together was standing in front of this furnace all day long hot tired I know amram wanted to come home get him something to eat and go to bed am around so I can't go to bed put the kids to bed you go on in yourself honey I'll be down directly I gotta go talk to God I gotta go talk to God so amram would go back and he would pray he would cry it took it it seemed like God you what are you going to answer Lord so they had another council meeting and this one time another slick fella oh suit suit guy came up he said I got another idea this time you know let's put all the women to work let's let them work out in the field too so now when the men get home daytime the women tied children left alone and then they can't make no more babies because not a woman frustrated man frustrated they come home and get them a real good argument going you higher than you could why didn't you cook I work just as hard as you what no Burger King on the corner somebody had to heat that fire up put some pots on the Fire are y'all gonna stall see what I'm saying is that devil will come and try to disrupt the home but guess who went and did something about it he said go ahead and go to bed Yoshi put the kids together I got to go talk with God Who Am ram real daddy real good father even in the midst of his own struggles I gotta get up go to work provide then I gotta come home and pray God gave us Brothers the responsibility the responsibility yo they don't end when you punch the clock your date on end when you punch the clock you still got work to do amen I remember brother Fred say something to me I had backslid lost my way but I've always had a respect for that fellow there's a lot of the way he preached preach hard and he came up behind me I think I told his testimony before he came up behind me I turned around and I looked Hey Brother Fred I want to hug him into that thing that fell looked at me like I said you ain't glad to see me he said let me tell you something young man God gonna hold you responsible for your family he looked at me and said God don't hold you responsible turn it back and walked away I went home that night and all I heard was God gonna hold you responsible for your family couldn't sleep hear me I'll tell you I couldn't sleep all I heard God gonna hold your thumbs up woke up the next day God gonna hold you responsible for you about going in through work come God gonna hold you responsible here man everything I all I God gonna hold you responsible for your family I had an appointed time a Divine appointment with Fred Mullins that day and all it took was a simple word God gonna hold you responsible for your family now I don't know who may be listening to this but I'ma tell you something God gonna hold you responsible for your family oh amram had to eat look he didn't do nothing wrong why is he going through this it was just a burden on his heart he understood the responsibility I like the way my pastor a responsibility is merely the ability to respond and ambraham responsed he responded amen to the problem how well he didn't go and get us start sharpening his sword no we ain't gonna win that way Army too big but he went down on his knee and began to talk with God there's a big enemy law a great Army we don't stand a chance against them they got us down here they got us all about doing all kind of unseemly things serving the items they got us building they false idols them the ones in the churches got them yoked up in false religion building their false idols the Lord deliver the people till one day oh amram went down into uh went up into the attic rather amen and he's praying and he's praying and all of a sudden Here Comes an angel finally met him he's swore on his on his side say amram you're gonna have a son and he'll be the deliverer and he'll be the deliverer now Moses was a great warrior of the scriptures led the children of Israel out of Egypt through the Red Sea across the desert to Jordan but who got the crown [Music] oh I'm around unseen Warrior God has great things for our children are we willing to pray are we willing to turn aside we can't it it don't come back home we can't yell we can't lose ourself see he's trying to trying to to to get our character right we got to let we got to put away the old man take on the new nature amen for the sake of our children for the sake of our families amen stand to your feet the musicians come amen I feel checked to stop right there amen maybe someday I'll get into David and Uriah oh boy I tell you what that's something right there too amen we can't do it through worldly means my brothers and sisters it's going to take a sacrifice speaking mainly to our brothers God has called us to be leaders God has called us to be men God has called us to stay on our knees and fight the battle and fight the battle amen my brothers and sisters the most important thing is to get rid of that old nature [Music] it's all right to just come to church it's all right to have had uh your appointed day when your heart was praying but you must get desperate like Jacob because see what happens is when you might have that break without the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost in your flesh you can't do it in your flesh it won't work it's going to take God in you to overcome the devil it's going to take the god in you Amen to to stand when you when when when when everything in your body is uh pulling the wrong way when you're upset it's going to take the Holy Ghost send you to settle you I read the scripture Peter there through struggle the struggle that you go through he's going to settle you and establish you but you built for it but you can't my brothers and sisters you can't do it under the old under the power of that old man [Music] amen that's right you're going to need a nature change don't get complacent because we're living in the you thought that time was bad this time is 10 times worse many of our people are deceived and tricked it's
