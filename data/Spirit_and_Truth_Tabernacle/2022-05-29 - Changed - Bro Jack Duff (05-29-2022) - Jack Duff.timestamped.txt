[40:01] it says in straightway he preached
[40:04] christ
[40:05] in the synagogues
[40:07] that he is the son of god
[40:11] but all that heard him were amazed
[40:15] and said is not this
[40:17] he that destroyed them
[40:20] which called on the name on this name in
[40:22] jerusalem and came hither for that
[40:26] intent
[40:27] that he might bring them bound

[41:02] take control over every thought that is
[41:05] presented
[41:07] take control over every thought that is

[41:15] service everyone that has
[41:17] uh come
[41:18] assembled in this place you have
[41:20] ordained us to be here
[41:22] none of us are here by accident by
[41:24] chance but god you had a purpose and a
[41:26] plan uh to bring us here today so god
[41:29] minister to each and every one of our
[41:31] hearts even those that are tuned in
[41:33] online they could be tuned in elsewhere
[41:35] but god you had them to lock in on the
[41:38] channel today
[41:39] on the stream today we pray that you
[41:41] would speak to them right where they are
[41:43] and god as uh may you through your word
[41:46] produce the change we all need it oh god
[41:49] and we just ask that you take control
[41:51] over this portion of the service it's in

[41:56] you can be seated praise the lord i did
[41:59] i also want to say thank you to those
[42:01] that sang the specials today my daughter
[42:04] sarah and
[42:06] jeffrey appreciate your specials on
[42:08] today
[42:09] we want to
[42:11] just focus on this subject amen
[42:14] changed um
[42:17] for a little bit and and i know that
[42:19] this is probably going to be a
[42:21] multi-part uh
[42:23] sermon that i will be ministering but
[42:26] it's just something that i have uh in my
[42:28] in my heart
[42:30] um
[42:32] uh and i want to you know just
[42:34] just just just deal with it just for a
[42:36] little bit um
[42:38] next week
[42:39] next week is a
[42:42] uh special day in christendom
[42:46] and
[42:48] it is called
[42:49] pentecost
[42:51] amen pentecost and it's something
[42:54] that
[42:56] i guess for me it's been somewhat
[42:58] troubling you know just a little bit uh
[43:01] to me because
[43:02] um when i when i just looked up
[43:04] pentecost you know i know from a
[43:06] biblical perspective what it is
[43:09] i know what i know what pentecost is uh
[43:13] but you know
[43:14] wikipedia
[43:16] uh certainly when you just put pentecost
[43:19] in and and when is it you know for
[43:21] uh uh for this year uh they got it for
[43:24] next sunday and it typically you know
[43:27] what wikipedia says it's
[43:29] a christian holiday
[43:32] of pentecost the the christian holiday
[43:34] of pentecost is celebrated on the 50th
[43:37] day
[43:38] from easter sunday it celebrated
[43:41] a man from
[43:42] uh the 50 on the 50th day from easter
[43:45] sunday
[43:46] and um it commemorates
[43:49] the descent of the holy spirit
[43:52] upon the apostles and other followers of
[43:55] jesus christ
[43:56] while they were in jerusalem celebrating
[43:58] the feast celebrating the feast of weeks
[44:00] as described in the acts of the apostles
[44:04] and you know so the thing that kind of
[44:06] troubles me a little bit about this is
[44:08] um
[44:09] i don't want
[44:11] pentecost
[44:13] just to become
[44:15] a celebration
[44:18] right uh just something that we look
[44:20] back in time we say oh this happened and
[44:22] we just celebrate it it just becomes a
[44:25] spiritual holiday
[44:27] oh come on somebody
[44:29] amen pentecost is something that we
[44:32] should still be experiencing
[44:35] right now
[44:37] hallelujah
[44:38] amen pentecost is not something that
[44:41] happens just one time a year where we we
[44:44] look at the 50 days after you know
[44:46] easter and we and we you know we we do
[44:49] all special events inside of church
[44:50] pentecost is is more than that
[44:54] and i don't want to i don't want uh
[44:55] wikipedia to just
[44:57] deduce it down to just a celebration
[45:00] amongst amen believers that's that's not
[45:03] what pentecost is amen if we would come
[45:06] in the right mind
[45:08] amen we would come in the right attitude
[45:10] today
[45:12] we can experience
[45:14] pentecost
[45:17] every time we get together in the house
[45:20] of god we can have pentecost
[45:24] oh hallelujah somebody
[45:26] hey man i i want it to be a fresh
[45:29] experience amen i don't i would love for
[45:32] wikipedia to update amen their their uh
[45:35] uh their definition

[46:08] glory to god
[46:10] amen i i i just i i just like i said it
[46:14] just kind of troubled me
[46:16] because you know the other thing you
[46:18] know i want to just kind of make a few
[46:19] few statements here
[46:21] um the church
[46:23] has reduced pentecost to a good feeling
[46:27] or an emotion
[46:30] come on somebody
[46:31] amen the church has reduced pentecost to
[46:34] a good feeling
[46:36] oh hallelujah amen wikipedia has reduced
[46:41] it to an annual celebration

[47:27] glory to god he says the methodist did
[47:30] it

[48:23] birth

[53:36] change
[53:37] and the way he does that is by filling
[53:38] us with his spirit
[53:40] amen and i was just looking at a couple
[53:42] things here uh peter
[53:45] hung around the church
[53:47] but he wasn't changed
[53:49] peter
[53:50] fellowship with jesus
[53:52] but he wasn't changed
[53:55] walked on water
[53:57] but he wasn't changed
[54:00] come on somebody peter experienced the
[54:02] supernatural but he wasn't changed
[54:05] that same peter when the when when the
[54:08] test came begin to curse
[54:10] glory to god we got saints still in the
[54:13] church
[54:15] coming to church week after week but you

[54:23] attitude
[54:25] oh come on somebody amen you got all
[54:28] these things in you you need a change
[54:31] we all need a change and the holy ghost
[54:33] is what produces that change

[54:39] amen he never had that foul mouth
[54:41] anymore
[54:44] amen something has got to happen
[54:46] to change us from the inside

[54:51] attitudes
[54:52] [Music]
[54:54] oh glory to god we must have a change
[54:59] and it's only the holy ghost that can
[55:01] produce the change
[55:04] only the holy ghost can do it
[55:07] amen so i'm not preaching the holy ghost
[55:09] as a feeling
[55:11] i'm not preaching the holy ghost as an
[55:13] emotion
[55:14] i'm preaching the holy ghost as a
[55:16] changer
[55:22] you see i want to just
[55:24] just just just you know
[55:26] make it clear when the presence of god
[55:28] draws near yeah
[55:30] it will produce emotion
[55:33] when the president of god is here you'll
[55:34] get emotional
[55:36] amen and there's nothing wrong that if
[55:37] you i mean uh uh i i i i think it's very
[55:41] normal for people to get emotional
[55:43] amen when god comes by sometimes it
[55:46] might cause somebody to go in tears
[55:49] amen somebody might go into
[55:51] uncontrollable praise
[55:53] amen it's just emotion when the presence
[55:55] of god come near nothing wrong with that
[55:57] but i'ma tell you this if you can have
[55:59] an uncontrollable praise
[56:01] and you can break down in tears and
[56:03] still go live the same old ungodly life
[56:05] that you were living before
[56:07] amen something wrong with that
[56:09] amen i don't want him come just to touch
[56:12] me
[56:13] amen but i want him to live on the
[56:14] inside of me i want him to express
[56:17] himself through me
[56:18] praise god
[56:20] amen just don't stop at a touch lord i
[56:23] need more than that
[56:25] amen i can't live the right kind of life
[56:27] without your spirit
[56:29] amen
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:33] hallelujah
[56:35] glory amen listen uh
[56:37] uh uh when there's there's things that
[56:40] the holy ghost does
[56:42] when he comes
[56:43] amen it just don't stop at a shout out
[56:46] it don't stop at a jump it don't stop at
[56:49] a tongue amen there's other things that
[56:51] the holy ghost does
[56:53] when it comes amen some people just want
[56:56] the blessings of the spirit
[56:58] oh come on somebody
[57:00] amen amen amen amen we don't want to
[57:04] just stop at the blessings but if god
[57:06] had a purpose he did not send the holy
[57:08] ghost just to be a blessing
[57:12] amen but the holy ghost came so that we
[57:14] can continue the works of jesus
[57:17] you can't do the works of god without
[57:19] the spirit of god
[57:22] oh i feel jesus in the place
[57:25] you know i remember uh uh the two
[57:28] brothers when brother branham first come
[57:29] in contact with the with the pentecostal
[57:32] people a man and uh you know he got
[57:35] there to the meeting and and he'd never
[57:37] seen anything like it before while he
[57:39] was there
[57:40] one particular man would rise up and
[57:42] speak in tongues
[57:44] and then after he was speaking to us
[57:46] another man would start
[57:47] interpreting now i'm gonna tell you
[57:49] that's the way it used to that's the way
[57:50] it started off
[57:52] that when a tongue went forth there was
[57:54] an interpretation
[57:56] that's the way it started now we don't
[57:57] have it anymore
[57:59] amen oftentimes we don't have it and the
[58:01] reason we don't have it because we don't
[58:02] wait on it
[58:05] oh it's the truth anyhow
[58:07] but it used to be because you know the
[58:09] scripture tells us that you know
[58:10] somebody came in your midst that they
[58:12] would think you were barbarians if
[58:14] everybody's just speaking in tongues
[58:16] don't interpret they think you
[58:17] barbarians that's what the scripture
[58:19] tell us we're trying to get back to the
[58:20] bible
[58:22] but here this man would he would rise up
[58:24] he would speak in tongues and and the
[58:26] other would interpret and brother
[58:28] branham said oh wow what a wonderful
[58:31] manifestation of spirit see i've never
[58:33] seen nothing like it he said i gotta get
[58:35] to talk to these brothers and see what
[58:36] is it that they got that i don't have
[58:39] so as he start fellowshipping with one
[58:41] he says uh he's saying he he discerned
[58:44] this man was a real genuine christian
[58:47] and then he said brother you know what
[58:49] is that that y'all y'all gotta say
[58:50] brother it's the holy ghost do you have
[58:52] it no i don't i don't have any say
[58:54] brother just keep praying god will give
[58:55] you the holy ghost gotta get it and he
[58:57] can give you these gifts with the holy
[58:59] ghost oh my i think that's another thing
[59:01] some people are operating in gifts
[59:03] without the holy ghost
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:06] that's right
[59:08] it's the truth in half
[59:10] they operate without it
[59:13] amen
[59:14] amen
[59:15] but here this man you know the other man
[59:17] some brother brandon i'm going to talk
[59:19] to each other he said he's saying he
[59:20] just start talking to me just kind of
[59:22] bless him you ain't talking tongues yet
[59:24] you haven't spoken in tongues yet you
[59:25] ain't got nothing it's like wait brother
[59:26] i'm just trying to learn this i'm just
[59:28] trying to learn just wait wait give me
[59:30] time and then after a while he started
[59:32] kept talking kept talking picked up a
[59:34] vision
[59:36] showed that this man had been married he
[59:38] was currently married
[59:40] but living with another woman and had
[59:42] children by the other woman while he's
[59:44] married to the other lady and he's
[59:46] inside the church interpreting tongues
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:51] brother branham say no this is devil's
[59:53] now he said no this ain't of god this is
[59:55] devil so he tried to pull away from but
[59:57] god showed him no the rain will fall on
[1:00:00] the just and the unjust
[1:00:02] oh can i ask you something do you want
[1:00:04] to be just
[1:00:06] or do you want to be unjust
[1:00:08] now you're going to get holy ghost
[1:00:10] blessings in either category but i want
[1:00:13] to be just
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:17] i don't want to be an unjust person
[1:00:19] operating in the spirit
[1:00:21] because the end result is hell for that
[1:00:23] person
[1:00:25] [Applause]
[1:00:26] i don't care what you do in church
[1:00:28] i don't care i allowed you hallelujah
[1:00:31] if you can't live right
[1:00:33] [Applause]
[1:00:35] if you can't live according to the words
[1:00:38] then there's something wrong with your
[1:00:39] spirit
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:50] the holy spirit
[1:00:53] a man
[1:00:54] should invoke any motion
[1:00:57] but the purpose of the spirit dwelling
[1:00:59] in us is much greater than the emotion
[1:01:02] [Applause]
[1:01:04] when he the holy ghost has come
[1:01:07] this is the bible now he will lead you
[1:01:11] into all truth
[1:01:14] so the holy ghost comes to bring you the
[1:01:16] truth
[1:01:18] when you stumble around in darkness the
[1:01:20] holy ghost come to leave you the truth
[1:01:23] another thing that the holy ghost does
[1:01:25] say you shall receive power
[1:01:28] oh my
[1:01:29] god
[1:01:30] amen power
[1:01:32] after the holy ghost comes upon you and
[1:01:35] what is this powerful is power to help
[1:01:37] you live right
[1:01:39] it's power to help you talk right
[1:01:42] it's power to help you walk right
[1:01:45] there is power from god
[1:01:48] you know you think about the children of
[1:01:49] israel they were just so messed up in
[1:01:52] their their their uh their that they
[1:01:55] were coming off for their their
[1:01:56] sacrifices and they repent of their sins
[1:01:59] and they come and
[1:02:00] offer sacrifice for the sin and and then
[1:02:02] they go right back out after they offer
[1:02:05] the sacrifice after they slayed their
[1:02:06] lamb after they did all these things
[1:02:08] they go right back out and live the same
[1:02:10] old kind of life
[1:02:12] and it's because they did not have
[1:02:14] access to the spirit of god
[1:02:16] but now we have full access it should
[1:02:19] produce different results
[1:02:21] there should be a change
[1:02:23] when the holy ghost comes in they're
[1:02:25] supposed to be a change
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:31] oh my
[1:02:33] statement the prophet says that's what
[1:02:35] the holy spirit is in the church for to

[1:09:34] changed peter
[1:09:37] oh hallelujah amen and people should be

[1:09:43] in a christian and a holy ghost feel
[1:09:47] christian
[1:09:49] i'm not talking about you seeing the
[1:09:51] difference i'm talking about people
[1:09:54] seeing the difference between a
[1:09:57] christian and a holy ghost feel
[1:10:00] christian
[1:10:02] your life is supposed to be producing
[1:10:04] something else
[1:10:06] if you claim the experience of the holy
[1:10:08] ghost
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:12] your life should i mean i offer up
[1:10:15] different sacrifices
[1:10:17] you shouldn't be responding the same way
[1:10:19] other people respond
[1:10:22] oh the holy ghost to control your mouth
[1:10:27] the holy ghost can control your tongue
[1:10:29] the holy ghost can control your
[1:10:31] responses on social media the holy ghost
[1:10:34] will tell you no don't put that out
[1:10:36] there
[1:10:37] the holy ghost is saying stop the
[1:10:39] arguing
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:43] where there is no wood the fire season
[1:10:46] and what you say out of your mouth
[1:10:48] brings wood to the situation
[1:10:50] oh i feel like preaching anyway today

[1:11:18] don't go out like that
[1:11:19] the holy ghost say don't dress like that
[1:11:23] yes it does
[1:11:28] and i'm gonna tell you something if we
[1:11:29] all got the same holy ghost that they
[1:11:31] had at pentecost
[1:11:33] [Applause]
[1:11:34] it should produce the same results
[1:11:38] [Applause]
[1:11:42] a difference
[1:11:44] not only just the difference
[1:11:46] vast yes
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] there's a vast difference
[1:11:58] between just a christian
[1:12:01] and a holy ghost field christian
[1:12:05] so now we're going to get this from the
[1:12:06] scripture and place it just exactly in
[1:12:08] the scripture
[1:12:09] the first place there there is a
[1:12:11] christian
[1:12:13] professed to be a christian
[1:12:15] see they might have repented of their
[1:12:17] sins
[1:12:18] and that's as far as they can go
[1:12:20] but if you actually if you if you've if
[1:12:23] you've approached it the right way if
[1:12:24] you've come according to acts 2
[1:12:27] you repent
[1:12:29] then you're baptized in water
[1:12:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:12:35] then it says you shall receive the gift
[1:12:38] of the holy ghost
[1:12:39] then it says the promise is unto you
[1:12:42] and to your children
[1:12:43] that means you ain't got to compromise
[1:12:45] with your children
[1:12:50] i ain't got to compromise with my
[1:12:51] children to keep them right i don't want
[1:12:54] to lose them i can't lose them
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:00] when i know that they have been placed
[1:13:02] according to the scripture i can't lose
[1:13:05] my child
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:07] well mama you did this and daddy you did
[1:13:09] that that's why i'm the way i am today i
[1:13:12] ain't got
[1:13:13] i understand i understand and i'm gonna
[1:13:14] tell you something you you may not get
[1:13:16] it yet because you ain't got no children
[1:13:19] right but one day when you get children
[1:13:20] and you have to make decisions
[1:13:22] you realize that you ain't perfect
[1:13:24] either
[1:13:26] praise god dream perfect
[1:13:29] right but i did the best that i could
[1:13:31] and and if you want me to say sorry
[1:13:33] because that's some people that's all
[1:13:34] they want you to hear that they just
[1:13:36] want to hear you say sorry it don't mean
[1:13:38] nothing more than just hearing you say
[1:13:39] sorry do you want to hear it sorry
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:13:44] i say sorry as many times you want me to
[1:13:46] say it ain't gonna change nothing cause
[1:13:48] i did the best that i could
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:53] and i did it according to the word of
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:56] and he told me if i was a man to repent
[1:13:59] i did that
[1:14:01] go to god be baptized i did that
[1:14:04] he said i was going to receive the gift
[1:14:05] of the holy ghost he's giving me that
[1:14:08] and now the next thing the next part he
[1:14:10] said he gonna also feel my children
[1:14:15] so i'ma just sit here and wait on god to
[1:14:17] do what god say he gonna do
[1:14:19] you can't stop the promises of god
[1:14:22] hey i'm gonna have a pentecost they're
[1:14:24] gonna have a penalty cause we're gonna
[1:14:26] have a pentecost
[1:14:28] hallelujah
[1:14:29] [Applause]
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:35] the first place there's a christian
[1:14:36] professed to be a christian
[1:14:39] but if this christian has not yet been
[1:14:41] filled with the holy ghost
[1:14:43] he's only in process
[1:14:46] of being a christian
[1:14:49] so when you see people that's in process
[1:14:51] you just be patient with them
[1:14:54] but i'm just not talking to the ones in
[1:14:56] process
[1:14:57] i'm talking the ones that claim a holy
[1:14:59] ghost experience
[1:15:02] all right
[1:15:03] this holy ghost experience should
[1:15:04] produce something it should be changed
[1:15:07] amen and not just something that you say
[1:15:09] you did the the people will recognize it
[1:15:13] the people will recognize it
[1:15:16] man they post are different than other
[1:15:18] people yeah they they stay that they
[1:15:20] some something different about them
[1:15:22] folks should know that you are different
[1:15:25] and i ain't talking about balancing god
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:29] you know because we we we try to balance
[1:15:31] god i'm gonna do so much of this and
[1:15:34] then i'm gonna spend so much time in
[1:15:35] prayer
[1:15:36] and then i'm gonna do so much of this
[1:15:38] and then i'm gonna spend so much time in
[1:15:39] church
[1:15:41] don't put god on those scales
[1:15:44] when when you put god on the scale so
[1:15:46] you got god over here and the things of
[1:15:48] the world over here
[1:15:50] when i put god on my scale i ain't
[1:15:52] trying to do this
[1:15:55] i want my scale to be
[1:15:59] i want to be all gods
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:04] tip my skills
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:07] come on somebody tip my scale
[1:16:12] like like remember how we was young used
[1:16:14] to get on a see-saw
[1:16:16] brother you had to get somebody equal
[1:16:18] weight
[1:16:19] amen so you can enjoy the experience if
[1:16:22] they was too heavy for you you was in
[1:16:24] trouble you was going to be up
[1:16:26] all the time never coming down
[1:16:28] and when it comes to god
[1:16:30] i want to always be up
[1:16:33] and never coming down
[1:16:35] tip my scale tip my seesaw tip my life
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:47] but if this christian has not yet been
[1:16:49] filled with the holy ghost he's only in
[1:16:50] the process of being a christian
[1:16:53] see he has professed to believe it
[1:16:56] he's working to it
[1:16:58] but god has not yet given him this
[1:17:00] spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet
[1:17:03] reached that goal with god
[1:17:06] that god's recognized it
[1:17:08] so you've been in church for years and
[1:17:10] god still recognizes that you've come to
[1:17:11] a spot where you really want the holy
[1:17:13] ghost
[1:17:14] we say we want it but oftentimes we just
[1:17:17] want just enough for a blessing
[1:17:20] we don't want the one that go and change
[1:17:22] our our living
[1:17:24] change our conditions
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:27] hallelujah
[1:17:29] it'll it uh it'll the holy ghost will
[1:17:31] make you turn your tv off
[1:17:36] ain't gonna get no amens there
[1:17:39] the holy ghost won't let you watch
[1:17:41] anything on tv
[1:17:49] holy ghost i mean you you won't you
[1:17:51] won't allow your kids to walk around
[1:17:53] cursing in your house
[1:17:55] but you allow that
[1:17:56] movie to just fly off all kind of words
[1:18:00] in the in the presence of your kids and
[1:18:01] everybody else
[1:18:05] it's the truth anyhow
[1:18:06] right there used to be some conviction
[1:18:09] as soon as you hear curse word you gotta
[1:18:12] turn it off
[1:18:13] i got i got scriptures here all the
[1:18:15] tables are full of vomit
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:20] all of them are full of honor ain't
[1:18:21] nothing clean
[1:18:23] right amen
[1:18:25] praise god
[1:18:26] amen but but holy ghost for the people
[1:18:28] we live different we act different we we
[1:18:31] we're not just christians we holy ghosts
[1:18:33] feel christians
[1:18:37] all right
[1:18:38] amen it goes on says uh i think i can i
[1:18:42] can
[1:18:43] i'll go because that god made a covenant
[1:18:45] with abraham after he called abraham
[1:18:47] which is a type of calling believer
[1:18:48] today he called abraham and abraham
[1:18:50] moved out of his country and went into a
[1:18:52] strange land to dwell amongst strange
[1:18:54] people so you know that's just that's
[1:18:56] what just coming to church that caused
[1:18:57] you to do that
[1:18:59] right it says and that was a type of
[1:19:01] when god calls a man to stop his
[1:19:02] meanness
[1:19:04] that god has called you to stop being me
[1:19:13] lord let it soak in
[1:19:16] stop being mean
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:34] christians can be some of the meanest
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:45] with the holy ghost you ought to be able
[1:19:47] to discern yeah
[1:19:50] when you walk into a situation and
[1:19:52] things just saying right say hey hey
[1:19:54] something ain't right about this like
[1:19:56] going to a restaurant
[1:19:58] you get to the restaurant and maybe the
[1:20:00] the waitress or the waiter ain't
[1:20:02] treating you right let your holy ghost
[1:20:05] discernment kick in
[1:20:08] rather than your meanness
[1:20:11] kicking
[1:20:14] right oftentimes we don't let the holy
[1:20:16] ghost kick in
[1:20:17] we let the meanness
[1:20:19] oh you can't treat me like that i
[1:20:21] thought you was a christian didn't they
[1:20:23] treat jesus like that
[1:20:25] didn't they spit on him
[1:20:28] didn't they they say things about him
[1:20:29] that weren't true then they treat him
[1:20:32] any kind of way how did he respond
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:37] father forgive them
[1:20:39] for they knew not what they do
[1:20:42] when we gonna just stop being mean
[1:20:49] it turns from the crowd that he was in
[1:20:51] to live in a new crowd among new types
[1:20:54] of people
[1:20:55] all right so you know this there should
[1:20:57] be a change
[1:20:59] that takes place
[1:21:00] when the holy ghost has come in
[1:21:03] amen this is again not just a
[1:21:05] celebration right it's not just a good
[1:21:08] feeling but when god when when his
[1:21:10] presence comes near we we open up and we
[1:21:13] receive what he has for us he wants to
[1:21:15] he wants to indwell
[1:21:18] god wants to live in you
[1:21:22] hallelujah god needs hands
[1:21:25] god needs feet
[1:21:27] god needs a mouth and god wants to use
[1:21:30] you as his hands his feet in his mouth
[1:21:33] and and listen he already know that uh
[1:21:35] you got a problem with your tongue
[1:21:39] he already know that so that's why he
[1:21:40] came to give you his spirit
[1:21:43] so he can so his spirit can control your
[1:21:45] tongue
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:49] but you gotta yield yourself to that
[1:21:52] and it's a dying daily
[1:22:03] all right here uh let me read this what
[1:22:06] what is the holy ghost go to paragraph
[1:22:08] 54
[1:22:09] in this
[1:22:10] there's there's a purpose that god gave
[1:22:12] us the holy ghost amen amen amen there's
[1:22:15] a purpose you know brother branham uh he
[1:22:18] preaches the sermon and i'll i'll i'll
[1:22:20] read a quote out of that in a second um
[1:22:22] he did the series of what is the holy
[1:22:24] ghost and then what is the holy ghost
[1:22:25] giving for
[1:22:27] amen and i just kind of went back and
[1:22:29] you know sometimes you'd be looking so
[1:22:31] deep so deep so deep so deep trying to
[1:22:32] find what what what the prophet said and
[1:22:34] sometimes just one little statement
[1:22:39] this is what the holy ghost was given
[1:22:40] for no not just a feeling not just an
[1:22:42] emotion not just a a spiritual holiday
[1:22:48] no no no no this is much greater than
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:51] look at this and what is the holy ghost
[1:22:53] it says
[1:22:54] spirit of god in his church what for
[1:22:57] what did he do it for
[1:22:59] he says this is a little on tomorrow
[1:23:01] night's subject
[1:23:02] it says but what did he do it for
[1:23:05] he says why did he why did the holy
[1:23:07] spirit what did he come for
[1:23:11] what did he come in you for
[1:23:15] what did he come in me for
[1:23:18] look at here's the answer was to
[1:23:20] continue the works of god
[1:23:23] amen yes sir to continue the words of
[1:23:26] god so the holy ghost helps you to live
[1:23:28] like jesus
[1:23:31] the holy ghost uh help you to act like
[1:23:34] jesus
[1:23:36] hey you don't realize it but you become
[1:23:39] a little jesus
[1:23:42] when you are filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:45] a little messiah
[1:23:47] when you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:49] he says i always do that which is
[1:23:51] pleasing
[1:23:52] to my father let me just let me let me
[1:23:55] let i'm going to stop right there don't
[1:23:57] call in time out again
[1:23:59] listen
[1:24:00] jesus did not operate in any kind of way
[1:24:03] that would bring
[1:24:05] a man a disgrace to daddy
[1:24:11] jesus didn't didn't handle himself any
[1:24:13] kind of way where his daddy would be
[1:24:15] impacted by that
[1:24:17] brothers and sisters in christ when we
[1:24:19] got the holy ghost we can't live any
[1:24:21] kind of way that's going to embarrass
[1:24:23] our father
[1:24:28] people look at you and say i thought you
[1:24:30] said you was a christian
[1:24:36] you don't want that kind of life yeah i
[1:24:38] thought you said she was a christian
[1:24:40] no you want a life where they say hey
[1:24:42] it's something different about you
[1:24:45] i can see it all over you i i see light
[1:24:48] when i see you
[1:24:50] that's what you want to hear from people
[1:24:52] it's not you declaring what you got
[1:24:55] it's other folk being able to declare
[1:24:57] that
[1:24:58] i know saints that have been in the
[1:25:00] grocery store and people just start
[1:25:01] following them yeah
[1:25:04] why are you following me what's going on
[1:25:06] i just i feel a presence
[1:25:08] i see something
[1:25:13] amen
[1:25:14] you know you know and for me
[1:25:17] that's biblical
[1:25:19] because when when peter was passing by
[1:25:22] man folk was so they knew god was in
[1:25:25] this man i'm talking about the same man
[1:25:27] that was cursed
[1:25:31] but something happened on the day of
[1:25:32] pentecost
[1:25:34] where this man got a change
[1:25:37] well now when he's passing by people say
[1:25:39] just let me lay on the side of the
[1:25:41] street where the shadow will pass me
[1:25:45] and if this man shadow passes me he
[1:25:47] ain't even got to touch me if i can just
[1:25:49] get in the presence of his shadow
[1:25:52] i know i'll be major that's what the
[1:25:55] holy ghost is supposed to produce
[1:25:58] oh hallelujah god that's the holy ghost
[1:26:01] we want
[1:26:04] thank you jesus
[1:26:06] glory glory glory i always do that which
[1:26:09] is pleasing to my father
[1:26:11] i come not to do my own will
[1:26:14] but the father sent me and the father
[1:26:16] sent me uh is with me
[1:26:19] and as my father has sent me so send i
[1:26:22] you yeah right glory oh my the father
[1:26:25] sent him within him the father that sent
[1:26:28] jesus came in him worked through him the
[1:26:31] jesus that sends you goes with you and
[1:26:34] is in you
[1:26:37] and if that spirit living in jesus
[1:26:39] christ made him do and act the way he
[1:26:42] did
[1:26:43] you'll have some general idea how it'll
[1:26:46] do when it's in you
[1:26:49] all you got to do is read the script and
[1:26:50] see how jesus handled himself
[1:26:53] because he said you know i go away but
[1:26:55] i'm sending the comforter back to you
[1:26:56] that was his spirit dwelling inside of
[1:26:59] us
[1:27:00] well if his spirit made him do certain
[1:27:02] things the same spirit will make us do
[1:27:06] the same thing
[1:27:11] you have some general idea
[1:27:12] how to do when it's in you because
[1:27:14] because that life that life that life
[1:27:17] his life cannot change
[1:27:20] it'll go from body
[1:27:22] to body
[1:27:23] but it cannot change its nature for it
[1:27:26] is god
[1:27:28] i like that brother branham says
[1:27:31] uh the holy ghost won't misbehave itself
[1:27:34] in you
[1:27:35] and then behave itself in me
[1:27:38] the holy ghost don't do that
[1:27:41] the holy ghost behave itself in
[1:27:42] everybody
[1:27:44] and i'ma say it like this the holy ghost
[1:27:45] behave itself in everybody in everything
[1:27:51] every area of life the holy ghost is in
[1:27:53] control
[1:27:55] all right
[1:27:57] amen
[1:27:58] here let me read this out of what was
[1:27:59] the holy ghost giving for
[1:28:01] amen amen amen amen
[1:28:05] thank god for this and i don't know
[1:28:07] where i'm at with time i don't know
[1:28:08] where i'm at
[1:28:10] uh but i i will i will just i will just
[1:28:12] do all my all i can uh here what was the
[1:28:15] holy ghost given for he says this now
[1:28:17] the purpose what was god's purpose in
[1:28:19] sending the holy spirit says now mark
[1:28:21] that down john 14 beginning that 14th
[1:28:23] verse and reading through the chapter
[1:28:25] for the basis so you can go back and
[1:28:26] read that it says god's purpose we find
[1:28:29] here in sending the holy spirit was one
[1:28:32] purpose
[1:28:33] god had one purpose it says that god
[1:28:36] himself
[1:28:37] might dwell in his church
[1:28:40] and continue his plans
[1:28:43] through the church i love that
[1:28:45] god himself
[1:28:47] might dwell in his church that means you
[1:28:50] don't belong to yourself
[1:28:53] you you know you don't own yourself he
[1:28:56] owns you
[1:28:57] you belong to god now when you're filled
[1:28:59] with his spirit you belong to him
[1:29:02] right it says god's purpose be found
[1:29:04] here and send the holy spirit was one
[1:29:05] purpose that god himself might dwell in
[1:29:07] his church and continue his plans
[1:29:11] through the church that god was in
[1:29:14] christ's continuous plans through christ
[1:29:16] out of christ into the church continues
[1:29:19] work through
[1:29:20] the church
[1:29:22] god i want to be yielded so you can
[1:29:23] continue playing
[1:29:25] through me
[1:29:27] change
[1:29:29] this word change means to
[1:29:31] to make form
[1:29:34] nature content
[1:29:36] future course of something
[1:29:38] different from what it is or what it
[1:29:40] would be
[1:29:41] if left alone
[1:29:44] so so what a change does it actually
[1:29:46] changes
[1:29:47] your direction
[1:29:49] amen because have you been left alone
[1:29:52] amen you keep doing the things that
[1:29:54] you're doing and actually it'll get
[1:29:56] worse
[1:30:00] if you're just left alone if nobody say
[1:30:02] nothing to you
[1:30:04] come on y'all ain't talking to me yet
[1:30:07] if there if god don't
[1:30:09] god don't anoint a message to come to
[1:30:11] you you'll keep doing what you're doing
[1:30:15] and you won't even feel no conviction
[1:30:20] right but what god has to do is send
[1:30:22] something to uh to to to to to to just
[1:30:25] kind of uh maybe just rough your
[1:30:27] feathers a little bit
[1:30:28] ruffle your feathers no you're going in
[1:30:30] the wrong direction now you can be a
[1:30:32] christian in church and still doing
[1:30:33] wrong
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] as christians what we have to do we have
[1:30:39] to follow god's word in every area even
[1:30:42] in areas that we don't like following
[1:30:47] yes god is concerned about every area
[1:30:49] like he concerned he concerned how you
[1:30:51] dress
[1:30:52] you can say you know even god concerned
[1:30:54] about how your hair looks
[1:31:00] he concerned
[1:31:02] that's why he wrote certain scriptures
[1:31:04] there about your hair
[1:31:05] he concerned about how the brother's
[1:31:07] hair looks
[1:31:13] i guess we read them scriptures
[1:31:15] they're concerned about the sisters hair
[1:31:17] and the brother's hair
[1:31:18] brothers cut their hair sisters let
[1:31:20] their hair grow
[1:31:21] [Applause]
[1:31:23] that's what god said
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:27] all right
[1:31:28] holy ghost folk
[1:31:30] holy ghost folk
[1:31:32] follow the word
[1:31:36] amen
[1:31:37] just go back and read it in the bible
[1:31:40] and don't add your own interpretation to
[1:31:41] it just accept it the way god said it
[1:31:44] and don't even try to say well that was
[1:31:46] for back in that time you think god is
[1:31:47] that simple right
[1:31:49] that god can only rob right laws that's
[1:31:52] gonna work for one period of time god
[1:31:54] knew every generation that was gonna
[1:31:55] come on the earth
[1:31:57] and he had to have a word establish that
[1:31:59] to keep everybody
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:03] man our children are being raised in a
[1:32:06] very wicked society
[1:32:08] [Applause]
[1:32:10] and there are certain spirits that are
[1:32:12] released in this day
[1:32:13] look here i'm gonna just be honest with
[1:32:15] you i would not be surprised if i we got
[1:32:17] to get out we got to get our school up
[1:32:19] and running
[1:32:20] but our kids would get attacked by a
[1:32:22] homosexual demon

[1:32:50] said like this if uh if god has already
[1:32:53] warned us that these fears was coming
[1:32:54] into the land

[1:32:59] to keep our children in the midst of all
[1:33:02] of this i don't care how much sin is
[1:33:04] going on we have a remedy
[1:33:06] it is the baptism of the holy ghost

[1:34:58] i see the signs all around me pointing
[1:35:00] to that this is the time
[1:35:02] and we ought to be in a hurry for god
[1:35:04] now more than ever before
[1:35:08] we too relaxed
[1:35:10] see that that's why we need change
[1:35:12] something got to change inside of us
[1:35:15] amen my thinking got to change
[1:35:18] my response has got to change
[1:35:20] amen my actions got to change
[1:35:23] and the holy ghost produces a change
[1:35:30] glory to god look at this
[1:35:34] um
[1:35:36] i was where was i reading from
[1:35:39] okay i think uh no no no here here's
[1:35:41] what i want to say uh to make the word
[1:35:44] the the word change means to make form
[1:35:46] nature content
[1:35:48] uh future courses something different
[1:35:50] from what it what it is or what it would
[1:35:53] be if left alone
[1:35:55] to transform
[1:35:57] or convert
[1:36:00] and their their their example is the
[1:36:02] witch changed the prince into a frog
[1:36:06] that's that's what their example is but
[1:36:08] i see the holy ghost changed
[1:36:11] me from amen this this this this
[1:36:13] wretched fellow amen indifferent fellow
[1:36:17] amen to a real son of
[1:36:22] god another another definition of the
[1:36:25] word change
[1:36:27] is
[1:36:28] to remove a dirty diaper from a baby
[1:36:32] oh come on i like that
[1:36:35] amen to remove a dirty diaper from a
[1:36:38] baby
[1:36:39] and to replace it with a new one
[1:36:44] you know even even a baby has a way of
[1:36:46] letting you know
[1:36:48] that they need to be changed
[1:36:51] come on somebody they can't talk
[1:36:54] they can't even talk they can't express
[1:36:56] themselves
[1:36:57] but they know when something has
[1:36:59] happened
[1:37:00] and they know that a change needs to
[1:37:02] happen some kind of way to baby make
[1:37:05] their way over to you and just begin to
[1:37:07] pull on you and pull on you and you
[1:37:09] trying to figure out what you want what
[1:37:10] you want you try to get a bottle no i
[1:37:12] don't want the bottle
[1:37:13] and they throw the bottle down they
[1:37:15] start crying and all kind of stuff
[1:37:17] because that baby realizes
[1:37:20] i need a change
[1:37:23] hey we we need some babies in christ
[1:37:26] that recognizes they need change
[1:37:31] and they will get they will do whatever

[1:37:58] look at this the catalyst
[1:38:00] of every change begins in the heart
[1:38:03] yes you don't change from the outside
[1:38:07] but you change from the inside out
[1:38:10] see a caterpillar has a change inside

[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:42] glory to god
[1:39:44] let me
[1:39:45] just turn uh to this scripture
[1:39:48] that we were reading from
[1:39:51] and i will try to find my way out but i
[1:39:54] i want to come back to this
[1:39:56] amen
[1:39:57] a little bit later now i i want you to
[1:39:59] see here in acts 9 acts 9.
[1:40:04] oh thank you lord
[1:40:08] thank you lord
[1:40:11] so so much that we want to stay here but
[1:40:14] here in acts 9
[1:40:16] verse 19
[1:40:20] and when he had received meat he was
[1:40:22] strengthened
[1:40:25] then we saw certain days with the
[1:40:27] disciples which were at damascus
[1:40:32] and straightway he preached
[1:40:34] acts 9 verse 19 and 20. and straight
[1:40:36] where he preached christ in the
[1:40:38] synagogues that he is the son of god
[1:40:42] and i just i just wanted to stop there
[1:40:44] just for a second just
[1:40:46] uh this acts 9
[1:40:49] if we were to read a little earlier in
[1:40:51] the chapter we would see that this is
[1:40:54] a man the the place where
[1:40:56] uh saul
[1:40:58] a man who later became paul
[1:41:00] but his name was saul at this time saul
[1:41:03] had an experience on the road to
[1:41:05] damascus
[1:41:07] hallelujah
[1:41:08] it's this is where he met the lord jesus
[1:41:13] and and and and while he was he had uh
[1:41:15] commissioned the letters to go down and
[1:41:18] persecute all the christians uh this was
[1:41:20] his you know he had he had signed
[1:41:22] documents that he could go down there
[1:41:23] and arrest anybody that believed in this
[1:41:25] jesus
[1:41:26] and as he was on his way down
[1:41:28] uh the lord jesus approaches in a great
[1:41:31] light and i like to say the light that
[1:41:34] paul saw was the same light that came
[1:41:36] out of god when he said let there be
[1:41:39] light
[1:41:41] there wasn't sunlight that came out of
[1:41:44] god
[1:41:44] because on the fourth day is when you
[1:41:46] saw a greater light and lesser light the
[1:41:48] sun and the moon but the first light
[1:41:51] that came out of god
[1:41:52] was this light that paul is seeing
[1:41:55] it's the light of christ
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:41:59] amen
[1:42:00] it's the same light that led the
[1:42:02] children of israel
[1:42:04] glory to god it was a pillar of cloud by
[1:42:06] day and a pill of fire by night it's
[1:42:09] that light that the children of israel
[1:42:11] follow
[1:42:12] amen that same light showed up on a
[1:42:14] picture in this day amen over the head
[1:42:16] of a prophet
[1:42:18] in houston in the houston coliseum amen
[1:42:21] so this is the light that paul was
[1:42:23] talking to and i want you to notice paul
[1:42:25] saw it as a great light hallelujah and
[1:42:29] not only paul saw but even the others
[1:42:30] saw the light but the light began to
[1:42:33] talk to paul why
[1:42:35] are you persecuting me paul
[1:42:37] you know it's hard for you to kick
[1:42:39] against the prick and paul spoke back to
[1:42:42] the light
[1:42:43] paul said who art thou
[1:42:46] lord
[1:42:48] oh i love this because when he uses lord
[1:42:50] now he's not sure who this is
[1:42:54] paul he said i know it's god so who art
[1:42:56] thou lord who art thou lord and then the
[1:42:59] light spoke back to him hey we got it
[1:43:02] now i
[1:43:03] am jesus
[1:43:08] the light identified who he was so that
[1:43:11] first light that came out of god was
[1:43:14] christ
[1:43:17] when he said let there be light
[1:43:20] hallelujah you realize you're always
[1:43:22] walk in darkness unless you have
[1:43:24] christ's light coming through you
[1:43:26] revealing itself to you'll always be in
[1:43:28] darkness
[1:43:30] you need light
[1:43:32] paul paul paul paul recognized that this
[1:43:34] was christ and and paul lost his
[1:43:37] eyesight and paul was told after this
[1:43:39] tremendous experience and then it says
[1:43:41] now go into the city and wait and it'll
[1:43:43] be told you what to do
[1:43:45] now i want i want you to get something i
[1:43:46] want you to catch this real quick
[1:43:49] paul
[1:43:50] had a tremendous
[1:43:53] supernatural experience
[1:43:56] but paul did not have the holy ghost
[1:44:03] after this big experience with god
[1:44:06] and many people come in church and they
[1:44:08] have supernatural experiences but they
[1:44:11] still don't have the holy ghost
[1:44:16] paul only got the holy ghost after
[1:44:18] ananias went down to his house prayed
[1:44:20] for him god said now go down into his
[1:44:22] house pray for him i want you to pray
[1:44:24] that he'll get his sight and also pray
[1:44:25] that he'll receive the holy ghost
[1:44:28] so as only after ananias went to paul
[1:44:30] that paul received the baptism of the
[1:44:32] holy ghost even though he had a nice
[1:44:35] supernatural experience
[1:44:38] same thing with peter peter had all
[1:44:39] these peter walked on what a
[1:44:41] supernatural experience but without the
[1:44:44] holy ghost
[1:44:48] so we don't want to just have
[1:44:49] supernatural experiences
[1:44:51] we want a real pentecost
[1:44:56] amen they have to go together
[1:45:00] can i can i just say it like this we
[1:45:02] want to worship
[1:45:06] in spirit
[1:45:08] and in truth
[1:45:10] they have to go together
[1:45:13] but now here's a good thing
[1:45:15] after this experience with paul
[1:45:19] i mean paul has this experience on the
[1:45:20] road to damascus has ananias come and
[1:45:23] pray for him and he receives healing
[1:45:25] amen in his eyes as well as he receives
[1:45:27] the baptism in the holy ghost now this
[1:45:29] is the this is where the scripture picks
[1:45:31] it up in verse 20 uh acts 9 19 because
[1:45:34] now uh 19 through 21 uh verse 20 says a
[1:45:37] straight way he preached christ in the
[1:45:39] synagogues that he is
[1:45:41] the son of god
[1:45:43] and look at this
[1:45:44] but all
[1:45:46] that heard him were amazed
[1:45:49] and said now notice it's not you telling
[1:45:52] people
[1:45:53] amen i change i change i check it's
[1:45:57] other for recognizing
[1:46:02] you can say whatever you want to say but
[1:46:04] if don't nobody see it you can call
[1:46:05] yourself a orange tree all you want to
[1:46:09] but if people see apples
[1:46:11] you're not an orange tree you are an
[1:46:13] apple tree
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:17] now go a little further you can call
[1:46:19] yourself a holy ghost field christian
[1:46:21] all you want to but if people just see
[1:46:23] christian tendencies
[1:46:27] and not holy ghost christian field
[1:46:30] tendencies
[1:46:31] you can say what you want but a tree is
[1:46:33] known by its fruit
[1:46:40] thank you lord jesus
[1:46:42] glory to god we need change lords
[1:46:46] somebody got a dirty spiritual diaper
[1:46:55] and stop walking around with that dirty
[1:46:57] diaper
[1:46:59] actually if the child don't come to you
[1:47:01] asking for a change
[1:47:04] when you begin to get a whiff
[1:47:06] of that diaper
[1:47:09] you're going to get that child
[1:47:11] and you're going to make sure they get
[1:47:13] changed
[1:47:15] hallelujah
[1:47:16] it's a true thing they have yeah and
[1:47:18] then they keep dirt and them diapers
[1:47:20] cows
[1:47:21] so they get to a certain age
[1:47:23] be like you don't want them wearing
[1:47:24] diapers no more you want to get them
[1:47:26] potty trained
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:29] we should be growing up in god
[1:47:33] we shouldn't be at the same spot we was
[1:47:35] five years ago
[1:47:37] amen we should be growing up in god you
[1:47:39] you ought to be elevating in god
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:44] amen
[1:47:46] here it says this
[1:47:49] verse 21 says but all that heard him
[1:47:52] were amazed
[1:47:54] and said
[1:47:55] is not this he
[1:47:58] that destroyed them which called on this
[1:48:01] name in jerusalem they recognized
[1:48:03] something changed by this man his
[1:48:05] message changed
[1:48:07] glory to god his his attitude changed
[1:48:11] his focus changed
[1:48:13] come on everything about this man is
[1:48:16] change
[1:48:17] because this guy this guy i say ain't
[1:48:19] this the same guy and he came hither for
[1:48:21] that intent that he might bring them
[1:48:23] down until the chief priest they might
[1:48:24] even see the letters in his pocket but
[1:48:26] this man is not operating the way he was
[1:48:28] operating before he met that great light
[1:48:32] hallelujah amen but it's even after that
[1:48:34] supernatural experience when he had his
[1:48:36] hands laid on him and he received the
[1:48:38] holy ghost something happened on the
[1:48:39] inside of paul
[1:48:42] oh we need that
[1:48:44] that's a real pentecost right there
[1:48:47] when something happens on the inside of
[1:48:49] you and other folk recognize it
[1:48:52] then you know then you know for certain
[1:48:55] that it's his spirit that's dwelling in
[1:48:56] you it's no you're no longer your own
[1:49:00] you belong to him
[1:49:04] paul had a supernatural experience on
[1:49:06] the road to damascus but he did not
[1:49:08] receive the holy ghost until ananias
[1:49:11] laid hands on him to receive his sight
[1:49:13] and the holy ghost
[1:49:15] and and and i just wanted to just
[1:49:18] put this in here i might have to stop
[1:49:19] here but i'ma come back to this
[1:49:21] go go go with me to one more scripture

[1:53:56] get to a point where we live certain
[1:53:58] type of lives that we profane god's name

[1:54:06] profaning i will sanctify my great name
[1:54:09] which was profaned among the heathen
[1:54:12] which ye have profaned in the midst of
[1:54:14] them

[1:54:18] lord

[2:02:17] and the increase of the field
[2:02:19] that ye shall receive no more reproach
[2:02:22] of famine among the heathen
[2:02:27] then
[2:02:28] shall ye remember your own evil ways
[2:02:32] and you're doings that were not
[2:02:34] good
[2:02:36] some of the stuff we've been doing is
[2:02:38] not
[2:02:40] good
[2:02:42] and shall load yourselves in your own
[2:02:44] sight
[2:02:46] for your iniquities
[2:02:49] and for your abominations
[2:02:51] not
[2:02:52] for your sakes
[2:02:55] do i this
[2:02:57] saith the lord
[2:02:58] god be it known unto you
[2:03:02] be ashamed
[2:03:04] and confounded for your own ways
[2:03:07] o house of israel
[2:03:09] thus saith the lord in the in the day
[2:03:11] that i shall have cleansed you from all
[2:03:13] your iniquities
[2:03:15] i will also cause you to dwell in the
[2:03:17] cities
[2:03:19] and the wastes
[2:03:20] shall be
[2:03:22] builded
[2:03:24] so you end up doing this for our glory
[2:03:27] we're not doing this for our own honor
[2:03:30] but god does this for his glory
[2:03:33] god wants to see people change
[2:03:36] and not just change for the day and go
[2:03:38] right back to doing the same thing
[2:03:40] tomorrow no i want to be changed from
[2:03:42] glory to glory to glory i want to i want
[2:03:44] to go cross closer and closer to god
[2:03:46] everything that i do i wanted to be for
[2:03:48] his honor
[2:03:49] i don't want to bring reproach upon his
[2:03:51] name and nothing that i do
[2:03:55] nothing
[2:03:56] nothing that i do
[2:03:59] glory to god you know it um
[2:04:01] um i think i told y'all
[2:04:04] last year we were
[2:04:06] i got tired of my wife working on
[2:04:08] sunday i i got tired of always having an
[2:04:12] ox in the ditch
[2:04:13] just got tired of it
[2:04:15] and um
[2:04:16] so you know i i know that the the feel
[2:04:19] that i'm in health care is one of those
[2:04:20] fields that it's it's 24 7. 7
[2:04:24] it's every day and um and and people
[2:04:27] when they get into a situation where
[2:04:28] they need help
[2:04:30] they need help it don't matter what day
[2:04:32] it is they need help
[2:04:34] i mean i remember one sunday we was at
[2:04:36] church and man my um i didn't realize
[2:04:39] diabetes was acting up in my body and i
[2:04:41] come trying to have communion and i just
[2:04:43] told the church once we were doing
[2:04:44] communion i said i'm gonna need y'all to
[2:04:46] hurry up come on up here and get the
[2:04:48] communion i'm gonna have to leave here
[2:04:49] and go to the hospital it was a sunday i
[2:04:51] had to be rushed to the hospital
[2:04:53] and when i got to the hospital on sunday
[2:04:56] i was glad somebody was at work
[2:05:00] i needed it
[2:05:02] right but but i also know that you know
[2:05:04] there's got to be a balance here so so
[2:05:06] so i don't want my wife have to go to
[2:05:08] work or even some of the caregivers i
[2:05:10] don't want them to have to go to work on
[2:05:11] something so i had to i had to pray a
[2:05:13] very specific prayer
[2:05:16] i say lord
[2:05:19] i need
[2:05:21] some seven dead venice
[2:05:23] in the business
[2:05:31] [Music]
[2:05:35] and you know what god sent me
[2:05:43] you know why
[2:05:44] they don't want to work on saturdays
[2:05:47] but they have no problem working on
[2:05:48] sunday their conviction is saturday is
[2:05:51] the seventh day
[2:05:53] i'm not gonna try to change you know i
[2:05:56] look i worship on saturday i worship on
[2:05:58] sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday
[2:06:02] friday i worship every day
[2:06:05] i'm not limiting my worship to one day
[2:06:08] but if that's where your convictions
[2:06:10] that's all you can see praise god
[2:06:12] we can work together
[2:06:14] right
[2:06:16] sometimes you need to be specific about
[2:06:18] what you're asking god for
[2:06:22] and hold to it
[2:06:23] if chick-fil-a can be blessed
[2:06:28] and refuse to work on sundays
[2:06:32] i i i i i want to follow the pattern
[2:06:35] amen
[2:06:36] amen
[2:06:37] look church
[2:06:39] we got to be changed
[2:06:41] i don't want us to just be um
[2:06:45] going along and just
[2:06:46] we compromising with the things of the
[2:06:48] world we're doing all that no church no
[2:06:50] we christians and it's supposed to be a
[2:06:52] big difference in the way that we live
[2:06:54] as holy ghost field christians
[2:06:56] as compared to those that don't have the
[2:06:58] holy ghost and if you don't have the
[2:06:59] holy ghost
[2:07:00] you've got to start praying and seeking
[2:07:02] god until you get it
[2:07:05] amen another thing i tell you this is
[2:07:08] god's this is god's way for you to get
[2:07:09] the holy ghost
[2:07:10] repent
[2:07:13] be baptized in the name of the lord
[2:07:14] jesus christ
[2:07:15] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[2:07:17] ghost and if you've repented and you
[2:07:19] know you've done that you've been
[2:07:20] baptized then the prophet said god is
[2:07:22] obligated
[2:07:23] and when you pray you just tell god lord
[2:07:25] you obligated to fill me with the holy
[2:07:27] ghost
[2:07:28] and i'm not gonna talk about no feeling
[2:07:30] i'm talking about change
[2:07:35] a dove cleans itself from the inside
[2:07:40] oil is produced from the inside flows to
[2:07:42] the outside and keeps it white as snow
[2:07:46] that's why we need something happening
[2:07:47] on the inside that produces itself on
[2:07:49] the outside and we
[2:07:51] we stay clean from the things world we
[2:07:52] don't want the pollution
[2:07:54] the pollution the pollution of the world
[2:07:56] we need god we need a change
[2:07:58] let's pray
[2:08:01] father
[2:08:05] lord i
[2:08:07] just released in my heart
[2:08:09] i know lord that we're living in a
[2:08:12] very difficult time and without the holy
[2:08:15] ghost we will not make it
[2:08:19] we can come to church we can jump we can
[2:08:21] shout we can scream we can do all these
[2:08:23] things but lord if that change ain't
[2:08:25] taking place
[2:08:27] on the inside
[2:08:28] god we're
[2:08:29] we're going through just emotions
[2:08:33] it's not what i want it's not what it's
[2:08:35] not what i'm asking for god
[2:08:38] lord i want that same change that paul
[2:08:40] had
[2:08:41] the same change that that peter had
[2:08:45] oh father
[2:08:47] same change that john had we can look at
[2:08:49] these different characters in scripture
[2:08:51] their nature changed
[2:08:54] after the holy ghost came in
[2:08:56] [Music]
[2:08:57] father this is this is exactly what we
[2:08:59] need our nature our desires our thoughts
[2:09:01] our
[2:09:02] actions our reactions our intentions
[2:09:05] everything it needs to change we can't
[2:09:07] keep going the same direction that we're
[2:09:09] going
[2:09:10] lord the hours late
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:14] time is at hand
[2:09:17] the rapture is upon us
[2:09:19] help us to keep a balance on these
[2:09:20] things that we're involved in gone
[2:09:23] we always want you lord to rule out we
[2:09:25] want you to amen be first and foremost
[2:09:28] in everything we do
[2:09:29] all that we have is because you gave it
[2:09:31] to us
[2:09:32] and you don't give us anything that
[2:09:34] would cause us amen to draw further away
[2:09:36] from you that's not that's not how you
[2:09:38] operate
[2:09:39] but satan will certainly be there to try
[2:09:41] to lord just just just pull us in this
[2:09:43] direction pull us in that we gotta fight
[2:09:45] against it
[2:09:48] gotta fight it lord
[2:09:50] we need
[2:09:51] change
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:56] lord my prayer is that the hearts of the
[2:09:58] people this is why i prayed earlier that
[2:10:00] not only taking control of the thoughts
[2:10:02] that would be spoken but take control of
[2:10:04] the thoughts that would be received
[2:10:07] let the people know that it's you trying
[2:10:08] to reach them oh god
[2:10:10] it's you that love them and you that
[2:10:13] care father and you want to draw closer
[2:10:15] to him
[2:10:17] we got to be willing to yield and give
[2:10:20] up
[2:10:22] go back to the word
[2:10:25] not our explanation or some other
[2:10:26] person's explanation
[2:10:28] lord but what does it say right here in
[2:10:30] black and white what does the bible say
[2:10:33] we want to live
[2:10:36] the scripture
[2:10:39] that's our desire father
[2:10:43] it's in jesus name
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:46] that we pray
