[26:50] the exp what you should see on uh the

[27:01] thank you for just your patience and
[27:02] working with us as we were just trying
[27:04] to

[27:08] god's grace i think we made it through
[27:10] and now we have things kind of
[27:11] stabilized and
[27:13] and uh trust that your experience would
[27:14] be pleasant
[27:16] amen so we'll continue to do our
[27:19] periscope and and facebook on wednesday
[27:21] night only the saints that are 60 and
[27:23] above
[27:24] are allowed to come to service amen on

[27:28] that you

[27:32] no service on friday night into further
[27:33] notice however this
[27:35] this week this upcoming week uh there

[27:43] saturday night that's this this coming
[27:45] week and that youth service
[27:47] amen is uh is is for our saints
[27:51] only those that are spearing truth
[27:53] tabernacle only
[27:54] are only ones allowed to actually come
[27:57] into the sanctuary
[27:59] we want to maintain social distances so
[28:01] uh we
[28:02] know that we invite all the other
[28:04] churches but this time it'll just be
[28:05] spirit and truth tabernacle
[28:07] and uh we ask that others just join us
[28:09] online because we will live stream the
[28:11] service so keep that in mind
[28:13] that happened again 6 30 on um
[28:16] on saturday so keep that in mind uh also
[28:19] next week uh we'll be having our 9 a.m
[28:22] and
[28:22] and 12 p.m service but we'll have some
[28:24] guest ministers coming from
[28:26] brother nathan bryant's church and uh
[28:28] they'll just be joining us
[28:30] here next weekend and but nathan's gonna
[28:32] be preaching on next
[28:33] um sunday at 12 and we're gonna be
[28:36] having uh
[28:37] i was telling him early in the year that
[28:38] we want to do a prayer line but i just
[28:41] couldn't figure out how to do it with
[28:42] this
[28:43] this pandemic uh but the lord just kind
[28:46] of put in my spirit just to do a virtual
[28:48] prayer line
[28:48] as well as amen one that would be done
[28:51] in person
[28:52] so saints that are here in the church if
[28:54] you
[28:55] had a particular need or if you knew
[28:57] someone that had a particular need
[28:58] we want to invite you to be a part of
[29:00] the prayer line but those that
[29:02] uh that um that are joining us online um
[29:05] we're putting things out on social media
[29:07] and i'm going to ask the saints here in
[29:09] the church as you see
[29:10] the different announcements on social
[29:12] media make you make sure you share that
[29:13] with others
[29:14] because we want to just get people just
[29:16] to kind of put their requests in but
[29:18] we're going to pray
[29:19] over their requests right here amen just
[29:22] like we would pray over the people that
[29:23] are coming through the line so
[29:25] it'll be something different be
[29:27] something new
[29:28] but i am basing it on the scripture uh
[29:31] where jesus was told by the centurion
[29:34] you don't need to come into my house
[29:36] it says but if you would just speak the
[29:38] word only my servant will be made whole
[29:40] so we gonna put that in practice
[29:43] is that all right that was the first
[29:45] that was the first virtual prayer line
[29:48] praise the lord and it worked
[29:52] hallelujah so we're going we're going to
[29:54] do the same thing right here we're going
[29:56] to speak the word over some conditions
[29:58] and
[29:58] you know i i put the request out and and
[30:01] i saw somebody uh already sending a
[30:03] request
[30:03] they say pray that god would deliver me
[30:05] from a stroke that attacked my body we
[30:07] praying over
[30:08] that i believe god can reverse the
[30:10] effects of a stroke
[30:11] i heard brother branham pray for
[30:13] somebody like that and god reversed it
[30:15] so
[30:16] you know i believe he's the same
[30:17] yesterday today and forever he hears our
[30:19] prayers just
[30:20] amen even today so we're going to be uh
[30:22] taking these things before the lord and
[30:23] i want to encourage you

[40:59] my help
[41:00] leave me not neither forsake me or god
[41:02] of my salvation
[41:03] when my father and my mother forsake me
[41:06] then the lord will take me
[41:07] up um teach me thy way o lord and leave
[41:12] me in a plain path
[41:13] because of mine enemies deliver me not
[41:15] over into the will of my neighbors for
[41:17] false witnesses

[41:26] see
[41:27] the goodness of the lord in the land of

[42:34] hands
[42:34] in jesus name we pray amen
[42:38] amen you can be seated
[42:45] praise the lord uh we want to uh use for
[42:49] a subject today
[42:51] uh waiting for the appointed time
[42:54] amen waiting for the appointed
[42:58] time and um i'm
[43:01] still in the channel of uh
[43:04] pick up your pen and write we are
[43:08] grabbing another uh paragraph
[43:11] uh from when the prophet was told by the
[43:15] angel lord to pick up his pen and write
[43:17] say i'm gonna write this
[43:18] message and this is gonna be a word uh
[43:21] to the bride hey man this is the word
[43:24] that comes forth to the bride
[43:26] and and actually i'll be honest i am
[43:29] thoroughly enjoying
[43:31] uh just going through this myself and
[43:33] just almost picking it paragraph by
[43:35] paragraph
[43:36] uh we have an opportunity just to kind
[43:38] of sit and dwell
[43:39] on what the lord wants to speak to us
[43:42] just in that section
[43:44] amen uh it's like we're taking a
[43:46] paragraph and
[43:47] and expanding it right uh that that's
[43:50] that's that's what i feel like we're
[43:51] doing on
[43:52] on this journey and uh so there was a
[43:54] statement that was made and i'm going to
[43:56] read
[43:57] out of the programming church age i'm
[43:59] reading two paragraphs
[44:01] before we get to the thought of where we
[44:03] are today i'm starting at paragraph 175
[44:06] 1 and we've already preached this
[44:08] paragraph but i'm kind of just
[44:09] bringing us forward and bringing us into
[44:11] where we are today so
[44:13] uh here in the pergamos the prophet says
[44:16] this
[44:16] uh i should say the angel said to the
[44:19] prophet
[44:20] amen the strange behavior of moses
[44:24] elijah and john withdrawing from the
[44:27] people into seclusion
[44:29] left many confused they did not realize
[44:33] that it was because their message had
[44:35] been rejected
[44:36] but the seed had been sown the planting
[44:40] was over judgment was next
[44:43] they had served their purpose as a sign
[44:45] to the people so
[44:46] judgment was next when god would send
[44:48] the prophet amen it was uh
[44:50] it was a it was a sign that judgment was
[44:52] coming after that prophet was leaving
[44:54] right
[44:55] so uh here uh he goes on and we hit this
[44:57] on last week
[44:58] says i believe according to revelation
[45:02] 13
[45:02] 16. amen that the bride
[45:06] will have to stop preaching glory
[45:09] for the beast is demanding the mark in
[45:12] the hand
[45:13] or forehead hallelujah and that mark in
[45:16] the hand represent them
[45:17] you're gonna be working for some system
[45:19] hallelujah
[45:21] amen your thoughts would be all about
[45:23] that system come on somebody
[45:25] you got that that's i mean then um uh a
[45:28] brother gene
[45:28] came just a week before and told us that
[45:30] we got to think on the word of god
[45:32] so your word is a as a lamp unto my feet
[45:36] and a light unto my path
[45:38] we have to constantly think on the word
[45:40] of god amen because if you stop
[45:42] thinking on the word of god you start
[45:43] thinking with everything else that's
[45:45] going on around us
[45:47] and then we we respond the wrong way we
[45:50] don't respond like believers
[45:52] we do respond like nominal christians
[45:55] come on somebody but believers are
[45:58] different than nominal christians
[46:00] we think different we act different
[46:03] we walk different we talk different
[46:06] we live different amen and we're not
[46:09] ashamed to be different
[46:12] blessed be the name of the lord but but
[46:14] this you know as i was just kind of
[46:16] going through this last week
[46:17] the lord the holy spirit just kind of
[46:19] gave it conditioning
[46:21] for the boycott amen because this is the
[46:24] great boycott that's
[46:25] that's really about to happen amen wait
[46:28] till they bring the picket signs
[46:30] to your church oh wait wait wait today
[46:34] wait wait till they come and and say
[46:36] y'all can't go until no one have service
[46:38] they already doing that with this i mean
[46:41] with this corona thing
[46:42] amen it's going to get worse hallelujah
[46:46] church that's why we better take
[46:47] advantage of the time that we have
[46:49] amen i believe according to this is the
[46:52] angel speaking this
[46:53] amen i believe according to revelation
[46:55] 13 16
[46:57] that the bride will have to stop
[46:59] preaching i know
[47:00] it's the bride not the church but the
[47:02] bride will have to stop
[47:04] preaching amen for the beast is
[47:07] demanding the mark
[47:08] in the hand of forehead if permission to
[47:11] preach be granted
[47:14] now you all y'all remember hallelujah
[47:17] there in um uh in acts 4
[47:21] they had come and told the disciples no
[47:24] more preaching about jesus
[47:26] amen amen i mean nowadays uh they don't
[47:29] mind you praying
[47:31] uh and publicly but they really have a
[47:34] problem if you put
[47:35] in jesus name they don't want that
[47:38] right i mean they have to write out
[47:40] their prayers right but uh but but if
[47:42] you put that in jesus name
[47:44] it just it just draws attention
[47:46] hallelujah
[47:47] uh we we baptized in the name of jesus
[47:50] we pray in the name of jesus everything
[47:53] we do is in the name of jesus
[47:55] so it's god it's going to be an attack
[47:57] against people
[47:58] that's standing in the name of jesus
[48:02] hallelujah watch you know so so you know
[48:04] they told those boys say now
[48:06] uh don't don't y'all use this name no
[48:08] more you know y'all can go out there and
[48:10] preach i can do this but don't use the
[48:11] name jesus
[48:12] but they say now who should we uh who
[48:14] should we actually
[48:16] obey should it be you a god hallelujah
[48:19] should it be y'all y'all y'all rules are
[48:21] god's rules which one are we going to
[48:23] obey
[48:24] and now they say say i tell you we're
[48:25] going to stand with god hallelujah
[48:28] and uh and the bible said they began to
[48:30] pray after they were threatened
[48:32] glory to god and the bible said after
[48:35] they prayed the place was
[48:36] shaken amen and and i'ma tell you if you
[48:40] want to see something shake again today
[48:42] we better get back to prayer
[48:45] hallelujah the place was shaken it said
[48:48] now behold their threatenings
[48:50] grant unto thy servants that with all
[48:53] boldness
[48:54] we may speak thy word by stretching
[48:56] forth on
[48:57] hand to heal and signs and wonders will
[48:59] be done by the name
[49:01] of thy holy child jesus brother god was
[49:05] moving in the book of acts
[49:06] and he's still moving today hallelujah

[49:16] mark
[49:17] or be forced to quit preaching then the
[49:20] lamb
[49:21] will come for his bride and judge the
[49:24] great harlot
[49:26] i thank god for that promise that even
[49:28] when we feel this pressure
[49:30] uh there's going to be a a pressure to
[49:32] lift us up out of here so
[49:33] i'm on the expectation but now we go
[49:35] forward amen in this in this statement
[49:38] that the angel's making
[49:39] says now remember that moses was born
[49:43] for a certain work
[49:45] but he could not do that work until he
[49:48] had received the gifts
[49:50] which would enable him to do the work
[49:53] now you know when he when he went to the
[49:55] the burning bush and had an experience
[49:57] with god
[49:58] this is where he was receiving the gifts
[50:01] that would
[50:01] enable him to do the work right he had
[50:04] to go out
[50:05] he he uh he threw that rod down and
[50:07] turned into a snake and you know he put
[50:09] his hand inside his chest it turned to
[50:11] you know a leprosy pulled it back out it
[50:14] was healed
[50:14] picked the rod up the rod turned back to
[50:16] the stick these are the gifts
[50:18] that he received in order to do the work
[50:21] now watch this he had to go out in the
[50:23] desert
[50:25] and wait there god had an appointed time
[50:29] now now this is important because moses
[50:32] with all the training that he had
[50:34] received with his mother
[50:36] a man telling him uh that he was born to
[50:39] be the deliverer
[50:40] moses tried to take his military
[50:43] training
[50:44] and use that to bring deliverance
[50:46] hallelujah
[50:47] glory to god but that was not the way
[50:49] god wanted to bring deliverance
[50:52] god wanted to use the supernatural god
[50:55] wanted to blow people's minds by
[50:57] sending a man with a stick in his hand
[51:00] amen
[51:01] 80 years old not even in good strength
[51:04] and good health but i'm sending you down
[51:07] there
[51:07] in this condition to get my people out
[51:10] of
[51:10] egypt bless it be the name of the lord
[51:13] it shows that it's not gonna have
[51:16] anything to do with
[51:17] moses but it's gonna have everything to
[51:19] do with god
[51:21] hallelujah if you're waiting on god this
[51:24] morning
[51:24] maybe you've been trying things a little
[51:26] bit too hard god
[51:28] wants you to know it's got nothing to do
[51:30] with you
[51:31] but everything to do with him
[51:35] amen he deserves the glory
[51:38] he deserves a honor he deserves a praise
[51:44] amen god just needs you to show up
[51:47] but he gonna take care of this
[51:52] hallelujah he had to go out in the
[51:54] desert
[51:56] amen and wait there 40 years of waiting
[52:00] hallelujah 40 whole years of waiting
[52:03] imagine it and god because god had an
[52:06] appointed time
[52:08] there was to be a certain pharaoh on the
[52:10] throne
[52:11] and the people had to be crying for the
[52:13] bread of life
[52:14] before god could send him back this is
[52:17] true
[52:18] for our day now i was you know just kind
[52:22] of
[52:22] meditating on that waiting uh for the
[52:25] appointed time
[52:27] and that word wait you know oftentimes
[52:29] if we
[52:30] really really want something
[52:33] and we want it real bad the the work
[52:36] the one word we don't want to hear is
[52:39] weight
[52:40] hey man i mean i i really want it i'm
[52:43] looking forward to getting this and
[52:45] amen i mean i i can i i got to have it
[52:48] and if somebody come and tell you wait
[52:50] we just don't want to hear that
[52:52] hallelujah we live in a society where uh
[52:55] people just don't want to wait for
[52:56] nothing
[52:57] amen i'll be the first one to say i i if
[53:00] i'm going to a fast food restaurant
[53:03] praise the lord you you named it fast
[53:06] food
[53:08] therefore there should be no wait
[53:12] no wait hallelujah right and i'll be the
[53:15] first one to pull out the line
[53:17] because i had to wait a little bit too
[53:18] long it's going to take me just as long
[53:21] to get to some other restaurant
[53:23] and get the food but i just didn't want
[53:24] to wait there we live in a world where
[53:27] even people just get tired of actually
[53:29] waiting
[53:32] jesus amen but yet in our christian
[53:36] amen our development waiting is a part
[53:39] of that
[53:42] and learning how to wait with a good
[53:44] attitude
[53:45] god let me preach to myself jesus
[53:49] learning how to wait a man is still
[53:51] keeping a smile on your face
[53:54] when things ain't going your way amen
[53:57] i'm still waiting
[53:59] and i'm still pressing praise god
[54:03] i'm not gonna lose my christian
[54:05] experience
[54:06] because i had to wait
[54:11] oh hallelujah weight means
[54:15] to stay where one is think about this
[54:19] weight means to stay where
[54:22] one is it also means to delay
[54:25] action until a particular time or should
[54:29] i put it this way
[54:30] to delay action until the appointed time
[54:34] look at this it also means a man uh
[54:37] it's to delay action until something
[54:40] else happens
[54:42] so you know i'm looking at uh of this
[54:45] definition and i'm thinking about the
[54:46] children of israel
[54:48] they were in bondage for 400 years down
[54:51] in
[54:52] egypt uh but you know and and maybe
[54:55] somebody was looking at a calendar
[54:57] and they were thinking that you know 400
[55:00] years has hit it's time for us to get
[55:01] out of here
[55:02] and maybe moses even thought that hey
[55:04] man this is the 400th year we got to do
[55:06] something so he tried in his own
[55:08] strength
[55:09] to start getting the people ready for
[55:11] this great deliverance but god said no
[55:13] that's not the way i want you to do it
[55:15] amen i got an appointed time as to when
[55:17] this is going to happen
[55:18] not only do i have an appointed time
[55:20] there has to be a certain pharaoh on the
[55:22] throne
[55:23] and then the people have to have their
[55:25] hearts in a particular condition
[55:27] before i can actually send you down
[55:29] there and we get some results
[55:32] hallelujah amen they had they had a time
[55:36] but
[55:36] maybe not the appointed time now now
[55:39] genesis 15
[55:41] verse 13 through 16 shows us that they
[55:44] had to wait
[55:46] until something else happened
[55:49] oh glory to god amen yes we have 400
[55:52] years
[55:53] but maybe we got to wait till something
[55:55] else happens
[55:57] look at this amen genesis 15 verse 13
[56:00] it said and he said unto abram no of
[56:03] assurity
[56:04] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[56:07] land that is not theirs
[56:09] and shall serve them and they shall
[56:11] afflict them
[56:12] four hundred years my and also that
[56:16] nation
[56:17] whom they shall serve will i judge and
[56:19] afterward they shall come out with great
[56:21] substance
[56:22] hallelujah when they borrowed all the
[56:24] goods from the uh from the from the
[56:26] egyptians they went out with great
[56:27] substance i
[56:28] i tell you we're not leaving this earth
[56:30] poor
[56:31] that well i'ma put it this way i'm not
[56:34] leaving poor
[56:35] i don't know what somebody else
[56:36] revelation is if i'm gonna walk on
[56:39] streets of gold
[56:40] that means there's gonna be an upgrade
[56:42] for what i got down here
[56:44] hallelujah glory to god
[56:47] amen look he says and also that nation
[56:50] whom they shall serve will i judge and
[56:52] after it shall they come out with great
[56:53] substance
[56:54] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[56:56] peace
[56:57] thou shalt be buried in a good old age
[57:00] but in the fourth generation
[57:02] they shall come hither again for the
[57:05] iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
[57:08] they were waiting for the iniquity
[57:11] of the amorites to get full for god to
[57:14] get tired of the things that was
[57:16] happening in that land
[57:17] they had to wait for some other
[57:19] conditions before they would be released
[57:21] to go in
[57:23] hallelujah see sometimes waiting
[57:26] amen requires us to wait till something
[57:28] else happens
[57:30] uh i thought i thought about ruth ruth
[57:32] had to wait
[57:33] for boaz to make his public testimony
[57:37] amen um he had to approach the nearer
[57:40] kinsmen
[57:41] and uh and he had to i had to offer
[57:44] redemption for the nearest kissman
[57:46] to naomi and uh and when he when when he
[57:48] got to the nearest kinsmen he'd say now
[57:50] you know if you're going to redeem him
[57:51] naomi say yeah i'll take it say are you
[57:53] going to redeem me say yeah i'll take
[57:55] say now if you take her
[57:56] you also got to take ruth and you got to
[57:59] raise up seed to the dead
[58:01] so the man said oh i can't do that
[58:02] because that'll marry my own testimony
[58:05] that am i my own amen inheritance i
[58:07] don't want to do that he said well if
[58:08] you're not going to do it give me the
[58:10] right to redeemer
[58:11] he said i'm going to give you the right
[58:13] and then boaz had to take off his shoe
[58:16] and make a public testimony that in
[58:19] front of the elders say
[58:20] this is the woman i'm going to redeem
[58:22] naomi
[58:23] i will redeem but ruth i will marry
[58:28] praise god he made a public testimony
[58:30] and
[58:31] jesus when he went to the cross amen he
[58:34] made a public testimony
[58:36] he was redeeming not just israel but all
[58:39] the world
[58:40] but he also got a wife this gentile
[58:43] bride has become his wife
[58:47] hallelujah amen ruth had to wait
[58:52] for that thing to happen we're waiting
[58:54] for the coming
[58:55] the second coming of the lord jesus
[58:58] christ i also thought about this young
[58:59] lady that kept approaching the prophet
[59:02] every time he would see her she said
[59:04] brother brandon what's the
[59:04] interpretation of my dream
[59:07] what's the interpretation of my dream
[59:09] and uh brother branham you know he said
[59:11] i don't know sister
[59:12] and then he would go and interpret
[59:13] somebody else's dream right in front of
[59:15] her
[59:15] and then she'd say well brother branham
[59:17] you told them what that dream meant
[59:19] but you haven't told me what mommy what
[59:21] is the interpretation of my dream
[59:23] and uh brother branham said sister let
[59:25] me tell you something to say
[59:27] your parents they support my meetings
[59:29] they're very uh good people
[59:31] and i really love them they love me he
[59:33] says but if i was to tell you something
[59:35] wrong then that would admire my
[59:37] testimony before your parents
[59:39] say so i can't go ahead of god if i
[59:41] don't have the word
[59:43] amen he said i think i know what it
[59:45] means but until
[59:46] i'm sure i'm gonna wait for god to give
[59:49] it to me
[59:50] amen and sometimes amen we gotta get to
[59:53] the spot where
[59:53] we we just gotta wait amen don't get
[59:56] ahead of god
[59:58] god has an appointed time even if he's
[1:00:00] made you a promise
[1:00:01] and you know he's going to come through
[1:00:03] on the promise you just have to wait for
[1:00:05] him to fulfill it in his
[1:00:06] appointed time
[1:00:10] glory to god stay where you are
[1:00:13] that's what weight means just stay where
[1:00:14] you at stay where you're at and wait on
[1:00:17] god's appointed time
[1:00:18] don't try to make it happen just stay
[1:00:21] where you're at wait
[1:00:22] because you'll know when god has opened
[1:00:24] up a door
[1:00:26] hey hallelujah you'll know when god
[1:00:28] opens up the door
[1:00:29] and i'm going to tell you something when
[1:00:31] god opened up the door typically
[1:00:33] he makes you feel very uncomfortable
[1:00:38] hallelujah that's when god is opening
[1:00:40] the door when you start feeling very
[1:00:42] uncomfortable in your situation because
[1:00:45] you you know
[1:00:46] here in america it's very easy to get
[1:00:48] comfortable
[1:00:49] man all we believe god for is that that
[1:00:51] one job
[1:00:52] that can pay us so much and if i can
[1:00:55] make this much money on this job
[1:00:57] and i can get all these bills paid then
[1:01:00] i'm good
[1:01:01] hallelujah but you don't realize that
[1:01:04] that company you're working for
[1:01:05] they making a lot more money on you
[1:01:07] being there hallelujah
[1:01:11] amen so sometimes god will make things
[1:01:13] get very uncomfortable
[1:01:14] and when it gets uncomfortable that is
[1:01:16] the tender hand
[1:01:18] of jehovah leading you to greener
[1:01:22] pastures
[1:01:26] oh glory to god sometimes you got to
[1:01:28] wait though
[1:01:29] amen because oftentimes we don't want to
[1:01:31] go through nothing
[1:01:32] amen but have a testimony when you when
[1:01:34] you're leaving somewhere have a
[1:01:36] testimony
[1:01:37] this happened that happened that
[1:01:38] happened we knew it was god
[1:01:40] amen amen amen all right all right
[1:01:44] all right uh i was reading this quote
[1:01:46] here and trying to do god of service
[1:01:48] without it being
[1:01:49] being his will uh paragraph 80 is what
[1:01:51] i'm reading here now
[1:01:53] the prophet himself had to wait before
[1:01:55] he took an invitation to preach
[1:01:57] amen he had to wait says now when all
[1:02:00] this happens let us now see
[1:02:02] uh what happens when god and his age and
[1:02:04] his time is not considered
[1:02:06] just the people's idea it says many
[1:02:09] people have said to me
[1:02:10] why don't you come over here and hold a
[1:02:11] meeting well we'll call for you
[1:02:13] sign this that or the other wait you
[1:02:16] might wait you might want it
[1:02:18] but what does god say about it
[1:02:21] many people said to me i've had
[1:02:23] invitation i've had interviews
[1:02:25] personal interviews and things waited
[1:02:27] for a year
[1:02:30] wait how will i know what to say until
[1:02:33] god tells me what to say
[1:02:35] see got to wait that's the reason i said
[1:02:39] write that out
[1:02:40] let me see what he said see wait they
[1:02:42] that weighed upon the lord
[1:02:44] shall renew their strength that's right
[1:02:47] we got to learn how to just wait on the
[1:02:49] lord
[1:02:49] even when god give a dream he might not
[1:02:51] be given an interpretation right away
[1:02:54] amen oftentimes we want the
[1:02:55] interpretation right away but god may
[1:02:57] not do it that way
[1:02:58] hallelujah you got to learn how to just
[1:03:00] wait on commit
[1:03:02] the thing to god and wait
[1:03:05] hallelujah glory to god so important to
[1:03:08] learn
[1:03:08] amen this we have to learn to wait look
[1:03:11] at this i was looking at uh
[1:03:13] saul because saul didn't
[1:03:16] didn't wait for the appointed time amen
[1:03:19] uh he got ahead of the prophet amen
[1:03:23] and he began to give some excuses as to
[1:03:26] why he got ahead
[1:03:27] and i'ma tell you whenever you begin to
[1:03:29] give excuses
[1:03:30] excuses only satisfy the person that's
[1:03:34] given it
[1:03:36] hallelujah your excuse will only satisfy
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:40] it's not going to amen satisfy the other
[1:03:43] person that you're giving it to
[1:03:44] yes they'll work with you but they don't
[1:03:46] appreciate the excuse
[1:03:48] god does not appreciate our excuses as
[1:03:50] to why we did this and why we did that
[1:03:53] god wants us to learn how to wait
[1:03:57] look at this look at this i was reading
[1:03:59] this on
[1:04:00] about sammy and i and i i want you to
[1:04:02] get uh first samuel 13
[1:04:04] reading about saul first seven 13 verse
[1:04:06] eight just give me a second i'll pull it
[1:04:08] up in a second let's get ready for that
[1:04:10] first samuel 13
[1:04:11] 8 saul was pre-anointed
[1:04:15] i should say anointed to be king he went
[1:04:18] there to the prophet samuel
[1:04:20] and uh sam he was looking for some
[1:04:22] animals that is that his dad in lawson
[1:04:24] when he got there to the prophet to go
[1:04:26] ask the prophet hey where the animals
[1:04:28] are where are the animals
[1:04:29] uh the prophet pulled them to the side
[1:04:31] and say hey i'm gonna anoint you god
[1:04:33] told me you was coming
[1:04:34] you're gonna be the first king of israel
[1:04:36] hallelujah
[1:04:37] and as he's telling them all of this and
[1:04:39] and
[1:04:40] i mean sam saul did not go to the
[1:04:42] prophet's house to get this type of
[1:04:44] anointing
[1:04:44] but he just went there looking for
[1:04:46] animals hallelujah but god had something
[1:04:48] greater for him
[1:04:49] now while he was in the presence of the
[1:04:51] prophet the prophet gave
[1:04:53] him some specific things one was uh
[1:04:56] he says you're gonna when you leave here
[1:04:58] you're gonna find two men by rachel's
[1:05:00] sepulcher and they they're gonna inform
[1:05:02] you that the animals were found this was
[1:05:04] a prophecy
[1:05:05] that he was about to walk into he is
[1:05:07] going to step into
[1:05:08] this vision look at this amen he says
[1:05:12] then after after that
[1:05:13] you're going to meet three men carrying
[1:05:15] three kids or three goats
[1:05:17] say three loaves of bread and also one
[1:05:20] of them gonna have one bottle of wine
[1:05:21] they're gonna try to give it to you make
[1:05:23] sure you receive it from their hands
[1:05:25] this is another vision that he's about
[1:05:27] to step into
[1:05:29] glory to god says now he said third
[1:05:31] thing
[1:05:32] you're gonna meet a company of prophets
[1:05:34] who
[1:05:35] who are gonna be under the anointing
[1:05:37] prophesied
[1:05:38] and this anointing gonna be so great
[1:05:40] it's gonna get on you saul
[1:05:42] and it's gonna cause you to become
[1:05:43] another man three things that were
[1:05:45] supposed to happen
[1:05:47] all three things happened but the
[1:05:48] prophet gave him a full thing to do
[1:05:51] hallelujah now you know god is with you
[1:05:53] when these three things happen
[1:05:54] you also know god is speaking through me
[1:05:56] as a prophet when you see these three
[1:05:59] when you see these three things happen
[1:06:00] so you need to learn how to wait on this
[1:06:02] fourth thing
[1:06:04] hallelujah the fourth thing was go down
[1:06:06] to gilgal
[1:06:08] and wait seven days before you make an
[1:06:11] offering to the lord
[1:06:13] not only wait seven days but wait for me
[1:06:15] to come
[1:06:16] before you make an offering to the lord
[1:06:18] now let's pick this up in first samuel
[1:06:20] 13.
[1:06:21] the other things happened and it was so
[1:06:24] clear
[1:06:25] uh that god was speaking through samuel
[1:06:27] but here saul
[1:06:29] had a problem waiting and i'm going to
[1:06:31] tell you something
[1:06:32] that's where most of our problem is we
[1:06:35] have a problem
[1:06:36] just waiting we we have no problem
[1:06:39] taking the promise
[1:06:41] god you said it but waiting for it to

[1:07:25] comes
[1:07:26] amen on the seventh day that's when
[1:07:29] we're gonna do the offering
[1:07:30] don't just wait seven days that's not

[1:07:33] but wait until i come hallelujah
[1:07:37] on the seventh day glory to god see he's
[1:07:40] looking at the time
[1:07:41] but not the appointed time oh jesus
[1:07:45] amen some must be looking at the time
[1:07:47] but what is the appointed time
[1:07:51] praise god church amen we got to get
[1:07:54] right in between there
[1:07:55] find god's appointed time
[1:07:59] hallelujah so he's waited seven days
[1:08:01] that's what he that's what he heard the
[1:08:03] prophet say
[1:08:04] wait seven days but he didn't wait on
[1:08:06] the prophet look at this
[1:08:08] and he teared seven days according to
[1:08:10] the set
[1:08:11] time that samuel had appointed
[1:08:14] but samuel came not to gilgal
[1:08:17] and the people were scattered from him
[1:08:21] glory and saul said now see now god
[1:08:24] allows it to get a little rough here
[1:08:26] amen for saul that's why i say you know
[1:08:29] when god's moving when things get a
[1:08:30] little
[1:08:31] hey man you you feel a little
[1:08:33] uncomfortable now you know god's
[1:08:34] starting to move
[1:08:35] but in the midst of this god is
[1:08:37] challenging this man
[1:08:38] to see where his faith is his faith is
[1:08:42] actually in the people that got him
[1:08:44] surrounded
[1:08:45] oh god help us here sometimes some of
[1:08:48] our faith is in that job that we got
[1:08:51] oh hallelujah my faith was in the job
[1:08:54] that i had
[1:08:56] my my face said i gotta keep this job
[1:08:59] god said no i want you to go full-time
[1:09:01] in ministry
[1:09:02] god i got a house payment i want you to
[1:09:05] go
[1:09:05] full time a minute god i got car
[1:09:08] payments
[1:09:09] i want you to go god i'm gonna do this
[1:09:12] hallelujah glory to god but god made it
[1:09:16] so uncomfortable that i couldn't
[1:09:17] i couldn't stay on the jobs
[1:09:21] amen i learned how to wait on the lords
[1:09:24] hey man look at this
[1:09:25] he teared seven days according to the
[1:09:27] set time that sammy appointed
[1:09:28] but samuel came not to give god the
[1:09:30] people were scattered from him so now
[1:09:32] he's thinking about doing something
[1:09:33] different because the situation is
[1:09:34] changing on him
[1:09:35] and saul said bring hither burnt
[1:09:37] offering to me
[1:09:39] and peace offerings and he offered the
[1:09:41] burnt offering and as a king he was not
[1:09:43] supposed to be doing this
[1:09:45] hallelujah this was not his position to
[1:09:47] be doing this look
[1:09:48] it says uh and it came to pass that as
[1:09:51] soon as he had made an end of offering
[1:09:54] the burnt offering
[1:09:56] behold samuel came and saul went out to
[1:10:00] meet him
[1:10:00] that he might salute him no no no now
[1:10:03] now he
[1:10:04] now he's getting up quickly going to
[1:10:06] samuel because you know some people
[1:10:09] glory to god they uh you know they the
[1:10:12] way he's coming to samuel is that i want
[1:10:14] to i want to greet you before you greet
[1:10:16] me
[1:10:17] amen because i want to try to influence
[1:10:19] you before you say something to me
[1:10:21] hallelujah somebody hey man
[1:10:24] glory to god god can read right through
[1:10:26] all that type of stuff
[1:10:28] and look at look at this nice answer and
[1:10:30] samuel said
[1:10:31] what has thou done and saul said because
[1:10:35] i saw that the people
[1:10:37] were scattered from me amen his faith
[1:10:40] was in the people not in god
[1:10:42] he's i mean all the prophecies that
[1:10:45] samuel had given him had already come to
[1:10:48] pass
[1:10:48] he should have known this had nothing to
[1:10:50] do with the people
[1:10:52] but everything to do with almighty god
[1:10:56] i saw that the people were scattered
[1:10:58] from me and then look at this
[1:11:00] and that thou came as not
[1:11:04] within the days appointed
[1:11:08] how could he fix his mouth to say
[1:11:10] something like that to the prophet
[1:11:12] because here the prophet is coming at
[1:11:14] the end of his offering
[1:11:15] on the seventh day all he had to do was
[1:11:18] wait a little bit longer
[1:11:20] now i'ma tell you something hallelujah
[1:11:23] because he refused to wait
[1:11:26] he got refused as king
[1:11:30] oh jesus i want you to think about it
[1:11:34] because he refused to wait he got
[1:11:37] refused as king look at this look at
[1:11:40] this look at this
[1:11:41] it goes on to say this in verse 11. it
[1:11:44] says samuel said what has thou done and
[1:11:46] saul said because i saw
[1:11:47] that the people were scattered for me
[1:11:49] and that thou came is not within the
[1:11:51] days appointed
[1:11:52] and that the philistines gathered
[1:11:53] themselves together uh at
[1:11:55] mickmash therefore said i
[1:11:58] the philistines would come down now upon
[1:12:01] me the good guy says what he thinking
[1:12:03] he don't he's not even giving god any
[1:12:05] credit here
[1:12:06] oftentimes we operate in what we feel
[1:12:09] going to happen
[1:12:10] actually you are creating that that
[1:12:12] situation
[1:12:14] oh y'all don't get that you actually
[1:12:16] creating what's going to happen in your
[1:12:18] mind
[1:12:19] oh jesus let me read this and i'm gonna
[1:12:21] just tell you so therefore said either
[1:12:23] philistines would come down now upon me
[1:12:25] to give god
[1:12:26] and i have not made supplication unto
[1:12:27] the lord i forced myself
[1:12:30] therefore and offered a burnt offering
[1:12:33] look at the words he choose
[1:12:34] i i forced myself to do this no you
[1:12:37] didn't force yourself you were afraid
[1:12:40] you did that out of fear amen sometimes
[1:12:43] when we're waiting we get afraid
[1:12:45] that things are not going to come to
[1:12:47] pass but if god made a promise
[1:12:49] god gonna bring it to pass
[1:12:53] hallelujah glory to god just wait on the
[1:12:56] lord
[1:12:57] and be of good courage he'll strengthen
[1:13:00] thy heart
[1:13:02] see sometimes we create it i remember uh
[1:13:04] brother
[1:13:05] uh we were just talking about him amen
[1:13:08] uh
[1:13:08] gatson he came here and he preached and
[1:13:10] and he was talking about how he would
[1:13:12] fear
[1:13:12] the deer he said i just i would just
[1:13:15] fear
[1:13:16] the deer and it says he would go down
[1:13:18] this street
[1:13:20] and he'd gone down one time and you know
[1:13:22] he and the first time he went down there
[1:13:24] was no problem living in south carolina
[1:13:25] he had no problem saying but one day he
[1:13:27] hit a deer on this street
[1:13:29] on one of south carolina streets winding
[1:13:31] through the neighborhoods
[1:13:32] and they say say hit a deer and at night
[1:13:35] so
[1:13:36] so he was just always afraid that when
[1:13:38] he come down
[1:13:39] through that park that he's gonna hit
[1:13:40] another deer
[1:13:42] and he says uh uh uh he got another car
[1:13:45] after hitting the first deer
[1:13:46] he said now you know i don't want to be
[1:13:48] there at night i have a feeling i'ma hit
[1:13:49] another deer
[1:13:50] he come down at night hit another deer
[1:13:53] and it kept happening over and over and
[1:13:55] over again he would hit deers
[1:13:57] because he was actually create the very
[1:14:00] thing
[1:14:00] that he was fearing
[1:14:03] he was creating
[1:14:08] and the very thing that you are fearing
[1:14:11] because you keep talking about it you
[1:14:13] keep worrying about it
[1:14:14] the very thing that you are fearing is
[1:14:17] the thing that you are creating
[1:14:23] if you can just have some faith and
[1:14:26] change your
[1:14:27] your fear to faith then you'll create
[1:14:30] positive experiences
[1:14:32] you'll create positive testimonies
[1:14:36] hallelujah you gotta change the way you
[1:14:39] look at things
[1:14:41] and while you're in the midst of just
[1:14:43] waiting just just just worship and
[1:14:45] praise god in the midst of it
[1:14:47] he'll bring you through he's going to
[1:14:49] strengthen your heart
[1:14:50] he's going to give you a testimony the
[1:14:53] longer the test
[1:14:54] the greater the testimony hallelujah
[1:14:58] oh my my my my i was thinking about

[1:15:10] oh jesus jesus yeah let me do i have
[1:15:13] this
[1:15:15] david david had to learn how to wait
[1:15:18] david a man uh was battling the
[1:15:21] philistines
[1:15:23] and uh before he went out to battle he
[1:15:25] asked god some specific instructions god
[1:15:27] said okay do it this way
[1:15:29] and then um the philistines regrouped
[1:15:32] and won the fight again
[1:15:33] and david was ready to go attack again
[1:15:35] but he asked god before he went out and
[1:15:36] said lord shall i go
[1:15:38] lord said no no no no don't don't go
[1:15:39] this time he says but what i want you to
[1:15:42] do is
[1:15:42] go wait underneath the mulberry trees it
[1:15:46] says and wait till you hear the sound
[1:15:48] going forth in the mulberry trees
[1:15:50] then you'll know to go out to battle
[1:15:52] hallelujah and he had to sit there and
[1:15:54] wait now
[1:15:54] brother branham brings this out on a
[1:15:56] quote that i won't just read
[1:15:57] amen and um make it away
[1:16:02] hallelujah he says how did my blind eyes
[1:16:05] be healed
[1:16:06] god made a way oh yes i love that
[1:16:10] how you got out of this situation god
[1:16:12] made a way

[1:16:17] how you got the car that you got god
[1:16:19] made a way
[1:16:20] come on somebody he always wants to make
[1:16:23] a way
[1:16:24] you don't need to make the way let god
[1:16:27] make a way
[1:16:29] that way you have something to say in a
[1:16:30] testimony service
[1:16:32] god did this and god did that and god
[1:16:35] did this and god did that
[1:16:38] god made a way
[1:16:42] it says god made a way hallelujah sir he
[1:16:44] will always make a way
[1:16:47] and for you here that's in the earth
[1:16:49] today you who are waiting for the
[1:16:51] consolation
[1:16:52] you who are pilgrims and strangers be
[1:16:55] like david
[1:16:57] it says david was going to the battle he
[1:17:00] didn't go
[1:17:01] flustrated amen he didn't go with a
[1:17:04] halfway mark
[1:17:06] he didn't go thinking maybe it'll do it
[1:17:10] but he waited in the mulberry bush until
[1:17:13] after a while it was death silent
[1:17:17] sometimes you feel your situations like
[1:17:18] that god ain't heard your prayer
[1:17:20] he heard you the first time you prayed
[1:17:24] you just waiting on the answer to be
[1:17:26] manifested
[1:17:27] glory to god it says uh uh while it was
[1:17:30] death silent
[1:17:30] nothing going after a while way back in
[1:17:33] the distance
[1:17:34] he heard the leaves start got louder
[1:17:38] and louder and louder after a while a
[1:17:41] great gush of wind went on before him
[1:17:44] he know that was god and a holy host of
[1:17:47] angels going before him
[1:17:49] and he drew his sword and took the
[1:17:51] battle and set the enemy to flight
[1:17:53] but before these things happened david
[1:17:55] had to wait
[1:17:56] in silence church sometimes before we
[1:18:00] see god move
[1:18:01] on our behalf we're gonna have to learn
[1:18:03] to wait in silence
[1:18:06] not saying a word
[1:18:09] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:12] this message trying to do god of service
[1:18:14] without it being the will of god
[1:18:16] brother branham made a a comment and i
[1:18:19] know what it means to wait in silence
[1:18:21] amen i had to experience that before i
[1:18:23] even started the church i had to wait
[1:18:25] in silence and you know when you when
[1:18:27] you when i was waiting in silence
[1:18:29] there was things that i couldn't even
[1:18:31] tell my wife
[1:18:33] amen i had to actually wait for her wait
[1:18:34] for god to do something in her life
[1:18:37] amen god had to show her some things and
[1:18:39] then we could have a conversation
[1:18:41] because had i said it it would have been
[1:18:43] me inflecting my spirit on her
[1:18:46] brother branham say i'm afraid we're not
[1:18:48] getting the people to christ
[1:18:50] he says i'm afraid we're getting one
[1:18:52] another spirit and not the holy spirit
[1:18:55] so i couldn't say anything glory to god
[1:18:58] watch this
[1:19:00] it says who is it that will dare to
[1:19:02] correct him
[1:19:03] brother branham's talking talking this
[1:19:04] and uh making this comment and
[1:19:06] and uh trying to do god of service
[1:19:08] without it being his will
[1:19:09] who is it that will dare to correct him
[1:19:11] and say now lord you made a mistake by
[1:19:13] putting this man in the ministry
[1:19:15] this man doesn't believe like we believe
[1:19:18] who is going to tell
[1:19:19] god he is wrong in it it would take
[1:19:22] somebody that's a little more
[1:19:23] of a delinquent than i am to tell him
[1:19:26] that
[1:19:26] he knows what he's doing he knows who to
[1:19:30] choose and who not to choose
[1:19:31] what to do and when to do it no matter
[1:19:35] how much we
[1:19:36] think that a certain person is qualified
[1:19:38] to do a certain job
[1:19:39] god knows who is qualified for the time
[1:19:42] and the season or the time and the right
[1:19:46] time to do it appointed time look at
[1:19:48] this
[1:19:49] he says and the real true
[1:19:52] christian the real true believer in god
[1:19:57] waits upon the lord for these things
[1:19:59] look at this
[1:20:00] wait on your ministry if you feel a call
[1:20:04] be sure that it's god be sure that it's
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:07] be sure that it's timely of what you're
[1:20:09] saying the bible says they that
[1:20:11] wait upon the lord shall renew their
[1:20:13] strength they shall mount up with wings
[1:20:15] like an eagle they shall run and not be
[1:20:16] where if they walk
[1:20:18] they'll not faint i was i was i was
[1:20:20] listening to this message earlier this
[1:20:22] week and
[1:20:23] and it just blessed my heart you know as
[1:20:25] i was thinking i said because you know i
[1:20:26] had to wait
[1:20:27] i had to wait before the spirit and two
[1:20:29] time and i could got started i had to
[1:20:30] wait uh i mean
[1:20:32] i was i was i was uh holding on to
[1:20:35] something god had showed me
[1:20:37] and i was still doing things for two
[1:20:39] years with just just waiting
[1:20:41] see sometimes folks could get something
[1:20:42] from the lord they just jump up so quick
[1:20:44] they
[1:20:45] god show me this and i'm out of here hey
[1:20:47] man you ain't got nowhere to go
[1:20:48] you ain't got you you don't even know
[1:20:50] what you're doing
[1:20:52] hallelujah and you and you out of here
[1:20:54] because god showed you
[1:20:55] that's why things don't work out because
[1:20:57] people get ahead of god
[1:20:59] right you got to learn how to wait on
[1:21:01] the lord
[1:21:03] right and i sat there and i said no i i
[1:21:06] said i know the lord just showed me this
[1:21:08] i'm reading this
[1:21:08] out of scripture i'm seeing this and
[1:21:10] i've seen that god showed me and i just
[1:21:11] i just waited just wait waited just
[1:21:13] waited
[1:21:14] and then uh you know one day the lord
[1:21:17] began to give my wife some dreams
[1:21:19] and as we start talking about the dreams
[1:21:21] and then start figuring out some things
[1:21:22] that okay this is the lord speaking
[1:21:24] hallelujah this is the lord speaking so
[1:21:26] you know and and when she finally come
[1:21:28] to me saying
[1:21:29] uh she knew that we had to make a
[1:21:30] decision she we got to do something we
[1:21:32] got to do some
[1:21:33] i said yeah i know she'd say well we
[1:21:36] started church if you start a church
[1:21:38] what you gonna name it i said spirit and
[1:21:39] truth tabernacle and i said it just like
[1:21:41] that
[1:21:42] she said uh where you get that from and
[1:21:44] i just began to tell her what the lord
[1:21:45] done for me two years
[1:21:47] prior hallelujah when i was uh reading
[1:21:50] john
[1:21:51] 15 and john 15 said uh you know a tree
[1:21:55] would be fruitful
[1:21:56] amen but there were times where that
[1:21:58] tree had to be pruned
[1:22:00] it had to be cut it wasn't that the tree
[1:22:03] was not fruitful
[1:22:04] but it had to go through a process of
[1:22:06] being pruned in order for it to bear
[1:22:09] more fruit so i knew that the ministry
[1:22:12] that i was a part of
[1:22:14] was a fruitful ministry but in order for
[1:22:16] that minister to bear more fruit i was
[1:22:18] going to be the ones cut prune cut from
[1:22:20] it
[1:22:20] hallelujah glory to god but by in the
[1:22:23] midst of being cut
[1:22:24] i knew i was also being planted
[1:22:27] blessed be the name of the lord so so i
[1:22:30] i said lord i
[1:22:31] i see what you're trying to speak to me
[1:22:32] through john 15. went to a convention
[1:22:35] very first service that the preacher
[1:22:37] come out and preach he say i'm preaching
[1:22:39] from john 15
[1:22:41] and he saved the title my sermon is
[1:22:43] fruit much fruit
[1:22:44] more fruit i said i said god this man
[1:22:47] came from from his church just to preach
[1:22:50] to me
[1:22:51] and i sat there and i heard the word of

[1:25:21] you look
[1:25:22] amen as being negligent you just didn't
[1:25:24] uh you just didn't use
[1:25:26] it or you let something else stand in

[1:25:31] meant nothing to you
[1:25:32] after all little fusses and stools and
[1:25:34] arguments and church differences
[1:25:37] take the meek you let church differences
[1:25:40] take the meekness and gentleness from
[1:25:43] your life
[1:25:44] you used to be a different person before
[1:25:47] your trial
[1:25:49] can i say it again you used to be a
[1:25:52] different person
[1:25:53] before your trial now because of that
[1:25:55] trial you
[1:25:56] let it take it out of you hallelujah
[1:25:58] watch this
[1:25:59] let church differences take the meekness
[1:26:02] and gentleness from your life

[1:26:06] stop there just for a second
[1:26:10] uh you know what has to happen
[1:26:13] is that uh if you ever uh
[1:26:16] like uh uh cooked you know and had a
[1:26:19] real nice meal
[1:26:21] uh but sometimes what you cook amen
[1:26:24] someone gets stuck
[1:26:26] to that pot praise the lord
[1:26:29] and um and you have to take that pot
[1:26:31] because sometimes you can cook and
[1:26:33] hey man you can practically just wipe
[1:26:34] the pot and it's clean
[1:26:36] but sometimes stuff gets stuck on the
[1:26:38] bottom of the pot
[1:26:40] hey man and the only way you're gonna
[1:26:42] get that out
[1:26:43] is you gotta let it soak
[1:26:46] come on son you gotta let it soak in
[1:26:49] some water
[1:26:51] the only way you can wipe that thing
[1:26:52] clean and get i mean and i'm talking
[1:26:54] about you got to wait
[1:26:55] while while it's soaking you just don't
[1:26:57] put it in water and expect it to do
[1:26:59] something
[1:27:00] you got to let it soak in there
[1:27:02] hallelujah and this is what i what i
[1:27:04] what i feel like
[1:27:05] sometimes we got to soak in the presence
[1:27:07] of god
[1:27:08] sometimes we get so hard we get so rough
[1:27:11] we get so
[1:27:12] rugged that we got to come into god's
[1:27:13] presence and just let him
[1:27:15] soak let the reign of his presence just
[1:27:18] rain on us and we soak in his presence
[1:27:20] it'll melt that hardness amen it'll
[1:27:23] change that cold heart
[1:27:25] those cold thoughts and everything it'll
[1:27:27] it'll it'll make the indifference it'll
[1:27:29] make you more lovable
[1:27:33] when we soak in his presence we need a
[1:27:35] soaking rain from god
[1:27:37] look at this he says it he says
[1:27:41] arguments and church differences take
[1:27:43] the meekness and gentleness from your
[1:27:44] life
[1:27:45] would you want to stand before the
[1:27:46] father like that i don't believe you
[1:27:48] would i don't believe
[1:27:50] that you would do it neither would i
[1:27:52] says how i want to
[1:27:53] how i want him to say it was well done
[1:27:56] not by the skin of my teeth
[1:27:58] but it was well done my good and
[1:28:02] faithful servant see be faithful while
[1:28:04] you waited
[1:28:05] amen enter to the joints of the lord for
[1:28:07] you did
[1:28:08] well with what you had to do maybe
[1:28:11] you're a housewife
[1:28:12] if you are god made you a teacher of
[1:28:15] your children
[1:28:16] do a good job out of it regardless of
[1:28:20] what you have to do
[1:28:21] do it well whatever you doing do it well
[1:28:25] god bless you with a job work well on
[1:28:26] that job
[1:28:28] amen notice then if the child did prove
[1:28:31] to
[1:28:31] be a real worthy of the things that the
[1:28:33] father had over his kingdom
[1:28:35] and had been a real faithful child then
[1:28:37] the tutor brought message to the father
[1:28:38] oh your son oh that's the message i want
[1:28:41] to bring
[1:28:42] uh for you and i owe your son his whole
[1:28:44] thoughts is upon you
[1:28:46] all he's trying to do is please you he's
[1:28:48] so interested in your
[1:28:50] and and your affair uh until it's hard
[1:28:53] to hold him down
[1:28:55] i'd rather be just a little overzealous
[1:28:58] about the father's kingdom than to have
[1:29:00] no zeal at all for it i'd rather
[1:29:02] overwork when it come to god
[1:29:06] look at this he says and as the church
[1:29:08] of christ preacher told me some time ago
[1:29:10] mr branham i'd rather wear out
[1:29:15] than rust out hallelujah somebody
[1:29:19] and i'm talking about when it come to
[1:29:20] working for the lord
[1:29:22] i would rather wear rot
[1:29:25] than rust out glory glory glory
[1:29:29] yeah i said that is a lot of truth i
[1:29:31] rather wear out and die in the harness
[1:29:34] as brother neville says than they refuse
[1:29:35] to have the harness on
[1:29:37] it says you can't do nothing any worse
[1:29:39] than the neglect to try
[1:29:41] let us let us do all we can with what we
[1:29:44] what what you have
[1:29:45] uh what you have to do with and the holy
[1:29:47] spirit our tutor will bring it to the
[1:29:48] father
[1:29:49] and now notice if the child become a
[1:29:51] gallant child then was told to the
[1:29:53] father
[1:29:53] and oh just i just love the word
[1:29:56] at an appointed time set by the father
[1:30:00] alone
[1:30:01] everything is in god's timing right amen
[1:30:04] at an appointed time set by the father
[1:30:06] alone the child was
[1:30:07] his glory and honor was manifested
[1:30:10] before the public
[1:30:11] the father taking care taking his own
[1:30:13] child under celebration
[1:30:15] took him into a public place being his
[1:30:17] own son born in his own house yet the
[1:30:18] sun was
[1:30:19] placed positionally in the family to
[1:30:21] inherit all things that the father had
[1:30:23] you see it amen now if we all behave
[1:30:26] some glorious day will fall heir to all
[1:30:28] the things
[1:30:28] god in his appointed day that he will
[1:30:31] judge all men by christ jesus the time
[1:30:33] will come
[1:30:35] when god will give out rewards for those
[1:30:37] who are faithful
[1:30:38] and the rejecting of those who fail to
[1:30:40] be faithful i want to tell you while you
[1:30:42] are waiting
[1:30:43] be faithful while you are waiting be
[1:30:46] committed while you're waiting
[1:30:49] be dedicated amen to the things of god
[1:30:52] and in the process
[1:30:53] watch your attitude watch your attitude
[1:30:58] so i was thinking on this i thought
[1:30:59] about david
[1:31:01] david also had to wait for the kingdom
[1:31:04] he had to wait for the throne he was
[1:31:05] pre-anointed
[1:31:07] uh but he had to wait and and and what i
[1:31:09] found david was still a faithful
[1:31:10] shepherd while waiting for the throne
[1:31:13] david was also a faithful musician while
[1:31:15] waiting for the throne
[1:31:17] david was a faithful warrior while
[1:31:20] waiting
[1:31:20] for the throne hallelujah he was
[1:31:23] fighting for the man that he was about
[1:31:25] to replace
[1:31:27] oh y'all don't get that he was fighting
[1:31:30] for the man that he was about to replace
[1:31:32] god already told him he was the next
[1:31:34] king but he didn't help god out by
[1:31:36] getting rid of saul
[1:31:38] he waited for god to take saul out and
[1:31:40] i'ma tell you something right now you
[1:31:42] cannot kill the souls that are in your
[1:31:44] life
[1:31:45] they have to die on their own
[1:31:48] praise the lord i was looking at this
[1:31:51] and i
[1:31:51] happened to just i got some little bible
[1:31:53] software called aluminum
[1:31:55] and i said let me let me just look up
[1:31:56] this word wait and i want to see what
[1:31:58] they say and
[1:31:59] and then illumina it brought out amen
[1:32:01] the story about david i said well that
[1:32:02] was exactly what my thought was so
[1:32:04] let me just read something that said
[1:32:05] david uh here in
[1:32:08] psalm 27 14 it says wait on the lord
[1:32:12] be of good courage and he shall
[1:32:14] strengthen our heart
[1:32:16] wait i say on the lord now they were
[1:32:18] given some notes on this and they said
[1:32:20] uh
[1:32:21] waiting creates time during which we can
[1:32:24] trust god david knew from experience so
[1:32:27] the reason he can write
[1:32:28] psalm 27 14. you can put that on the
[1:32:30] screen just leave that in the bottom of
[1:32:32] the screen just for a second
[1:32:34] uh it says uh dave david david can write
[1:32:37] this because he was writing from
[1:32:38] experience
[1:32:40] right david knew from experience what it
[1:32:41] meant to wait for the lord
[1:32:43] he had already been anointed the king at
[1:32:46] age
[1:32:46] 16. he was known a king at age 16
[1:32:50] but he didn't become the king until he
[1:32:52] was 30 years old
[1:32:54] right so during the interim he was
[1:32:57] chased through the wilderness by a
[1:32:58] jealous king the very man
[1:33:00] that he's supposed to replace is chasing
[1:33:03] him through the wilderness
[1:33:04] my god look at it amen david had to wait
[1:33:08] on god
[1:33:09] for the fulfillment of his promise to
[1:33:11] reign
[1:33:12] as king now i want to also say this
[1:33:15] waiting waiting for god is not easy
[1:33:18] often it seems that he isn't answering
[1:33:20] our prayers or doesn't understand the
[1:33:22] urgency of our situation
[1:33:24] that kind of thinking implies that god
[1:33:26] is not in control or is not fair i'm
[1:33:28] going to
[1:33:29] psalms 40 you can take that down just
[1:33:31] get me ready at psalms 40.
[1:33:32] see when we're waiting on god it's not
[1:33:34] easy often times
[1:33:36] we think he's just not answering our
[1:33:38] prayer god heard your prayer
[1:33:40] as soon as you prayed it
[1:33:44] sometimes we think that god don't
[1:33:47] understand the urgency of the situation
[1:33:49] huh
[1:33:50] that's what you think that god don't
[1:33:52] understand god know he has an appointed
[1:33:54] time for it
[1:33:56] we think god don't understand the
[1:33:58] urgency of this i mean god i need this
[1:34:00] now amen i'm gonna tell you let god work
[1:34:04] it out he has a way of just giving you
[1:34:05] more than you
[1:34:06] ever imagined amen i remember we were
[1:34:09] looking for a house that took us a year
[1:34:11] to find the house that we wanted
[1:34:13] and uh we had found this one house and
[1:34:15] and say oh yeah this has got to be it
[1:34:17] this has got to be it and we went there
[1:34:18] and
[1:34:19] and and we had then we got the
[1:34:21] compromise on this got to compromise
[1:34:22] this ain't the house this thing we're
[1:34:24] doing all these compromises so then we
[1:34:26] found another house and like oh this is
[1:34:28] it this is it we put in our we put in
[1:34:30] our offer on the house the people
[1:34:32] never even responded to the offer and we
[1:34:35] were sitting there wondering like what
[1:34:36] in the world why won't they respond to
[1:34:37] the offer
[1:34:38] what's going on here why didn't why we
[1:34:40] were just our minds were just messed up
[1:34:44] so we're like lord maybe this ancient
[1:34:45] will then another house popped open
[1:34:47] and this one popped up and when it
[1:34:49] popped up um
[1:34:50] i mean i was willing to sacrifice on the
[1:34:53] other house because i loved it so much
[1:34:54] but there was one thing that i wanted in
[1:34:56] the house that that house didn't have it
[1:34:57] i wanted my i wanted an office and it
[1:35:00] didn't have it
[1:35:01] but god knew what i wanted but here i'm
[1:35:03] going i'm just
[1:35:04] i'm i'm compromising if i can say that
[1:35:08] with my thoughts because because i just
[1:35:10] like this house
[1:35:11] hallelujah but i told god i want an
[1:35:13] office
[1:35:14] so uh so another house pop these people
[1:35:16] never responded so another house pops up
[1:35:18] and
[1:35:18] and uh when it popped up i called a guy
[1:35:21] was for sale by owner
[1:35:22] i said i say huh hey does it does your
[1:35:24] house have this and does your house have
[1:35:26] that
[1:35:27] does your house have this does your
[1:35:28] house have that he said yes
[1:35:30] he said have you ever been here i say no
[1:35:33] sir i've never been there
[1:35:35] say but i've been to some of the other
[1:35:36] homes in the area and this is what i'm
[1:35:38] looking for says only one thing
[1:35:40] different about my house
[1:35:41] than the other ones that you saw you
[1:35:42] know that third car garage
[1:35:44] yeah i said yeah he said we converted
[1:35:46] that to an office i say oh
[1:35:48] glory i'm coming to see your house sir
[1:35:52] oh jesus
[1:35:56] and and and and just to go a little
[1:35:58] further just
[1:35:59] when we bought the house because we had
[1:36:01] another house that we needed to sell
[1:36:03] and when we bought the house we couldn't
[1:36:05] get our other house so we had trials
[1:36:06] with that i could just sit here and tell
[1:36:08] you
[1:36:08] it had a neighbor that had saw a person
[1:36:11] knocking on my door to buy my house that
[1:36:13] neighbor had a key to my house
[1:36:15] all they had to do was let him in to see
[1:36:17] it but the neighbor refused to let him
[1:36:19] see the neighbor say what y'all here for
[1:36:21] she said she uh as they said we want we
[1:36:23] saw the for sale sign we wanted to come
[1:36:24] in and see the house
[1:36:25] say oh they're not here they at church
[1:36:29] but my house is for sale took the people
[1:36:32] over the house showed it and they
[1:36:33] signed a contract right then never even
[1:36:36] opened up the door had a key to my house
[1:36:38] never even gave them the option to look
[1:36:40] at it
[1:36:41] god know how to do things so i had that
[1:36:44] house i couldn't sell it and i told a
[1:36:45] guy
[1:36:46] i'm doing a contingency on this it's
[1:36:48] based on me selling my house
[1:36:50] he said okay waited three months i could
[1:36:52] not get the house sold
[1:36:53] market was down at that time couldn't
[1:36:54] get it sold so the man came back to me
[1:36:57] and changed the contract he said i'll
[1:36:58] tell you what i do i give you ten
[1:36:59] thousand dollars
[1:37:01] to make make to make you six months of
[1:37:04] your house payments if you buy my house
[1:37:06] i said you're going to give me ten
[1:37:08] thousand dollars
[1:37:09] i say where we sign
[1:37:15] see how you wait on the lord and i
[1:37:17] wouldn't have got that if i would enter
[1:37:18] the other house
[1:37:19] god wanted to give me double-double
[1:37:24] glory to god and we learn how to wait
[1:37:29] watch this
[1:37:32] waiting for god is not easy oftentimes
[1:37:35] it seems that he's not answering our
[1:37:36] prayers or doesn't understand the
[1:37:37] urgency
[1:37:38] of our situation that kind of thinking
[1:37:40] implies that god is
[1:37:41] not in control or that god is not fair
[1:37:45] but i want to tell you something they
[1:37:46] said it and i'm going to say it god is
[1:37:48] worth waiting for
[1:37:54] hallelujah while you're waiting he uses
[1:37:58] that time to
[1:37:59] to refresh renew and teach you
[1:38:02] glory to god so make good use of your
[1:38:05] time your waiting time by discovering
[1:38:07] by discovering what god may be trying to
[1:38:09] teach you in the midst of waiting
[1:38:11] now here in psalms 40 verse 1 through 4.
[1:38:16] oh jesus i waited patiently for the lord
[1:38:22] he inclined unto me and heard my cry he
[1:38:25] brought me up also out of a horrible pit
[1:38:27] a pit out of the mire clay and set my
[1:38:29] feet upon a rock and establish my goings
[1:38:32] and he has put a new song in my mouth
[1:38:33] even praise them to our god
[1:38:35] many shall see it in fear and shall
[1:38:36] trust the lord blessed is the man that
[1:38:38] maketh the lord is truth
[1:38:40] trust and respect of not the proud nor
[1:38:43] such as turn aside
[1:38:45] to lies i say this
[1:38:48] and we're going to go back to verse one
[1:38:50] in a second waiting for god
[1:38:52] to help us is not easy but david
[1:38:55] discovered
[1:38:56] some key benefits from waiting
[1:38:59] we just read over them real quickly i
[1:39:00] want to go back to verse 1 and i want to
[1:39:02] show you these blessings because
[1:39:04] oftentimes uh you won't get these
[1:39:06] blessings
[1:39:07] until i mean often often blessings
[1:39:09] cannot be received
[1:39:10] unless we go through the trial of
[1:39:11] waiting so often times you won't get the
[1:39:13] blessing
[1:39:14] unless you've gone through the stage of
[1:39:16] waiting
[1:39:18] and here's the blessing
[1:39:22] i said bless verse one uh on that i
[1:39:25] waited patiently
[1:39:27] for the lord hallelujah and he inclined
[1:39:31] unto me and heard my cry that's the
[1:39:34] first blessing
[1:39:35] he inclined unto me and
[1:39:38] heard my cry that word incline means to
[1:39:42] stretch out
[1:39:43] or to turn to amen so
[1:39:47] when you say god incline that mean he
[1:39:49] turned to my situation
[1:39:51] i mean he heard me when i first prayed
[1:39:53] it and god
[1:39:54] turned to do something about it amen he
[1:39:57] stretched out his hand
[1:39:58] towards me come on somebody he inclined
[1:40:02] unto me and heard my cry the other thing
[1:40:06] here amen and the next verse says
[1:40:08] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[1:40:11] pit because sometimes when you're
[1:40:13] waiting
[1:40:13] you can get depressed hallelujah
[1:40:16] somebody
[1:40:17] sometimes you can get you know you can
[1:40:19] get a little despondent because
[1:40:21] god ain't moved when you thought he was
[1:40:22] gonna move but it's a it's a way that
[1:40:24] when he does
[1:40:25] move he lifts you up out of a horrible
[1:40:29] pit
[1:40:30] amen out of the maori clay
[1:40:34] praise god i love this that's the second
[1:40:37] thing
[1:40:37] the third thing is that amen the bible
[1:40:39] said he
[1:40:40] set my feet upon a rock
[1:40:44] what that means is that he gave you a
[1:40:46] revelation
[1:40:48] and when he spoke to you and gave you
[1:40:50] your personal
[1:40:52] revelation you start standing
[1:40:56] not in my clay but you were on a solid
[1:41:02] rock
[1:41:04] jesus glory to god and says he
[1:41:07] established my goings
[1:41:09] so when he put me on the rock then he
[1:41:11] establishes
[1:41:12] my goals as i meditate on this i thought
[1:41:15] about my daddy
[1:41:17] helping me establish my goals when i was
[1:41:19] first learning how to ride a bicycle
[1:41:22] amen uh if you know if you don't if you
[1:41:25] don't know how to keep the bicycle in
[1:41:27] balance
[1:41:28] you get on and you start rotting they
[1:41:30] have to give you training wheels
[1:41:32] glory to god and that way if you lean
[1:41:34] too far to the right
[1:41:36] you won't fall if you lead too far to
[1:41:38] the left
[1:41:39] then you won't fall hallelujah but but
[1:41:41] oftentimes that that rider when he first
[1:41:43] on the ride he's
[1:41:44] always leaning in one direction or the
[1:41:46] other
[1:41:47] oh hallelujah amen when we
[1:41:50] when we're learning to trust god and
[1:41:52] walk by faith
[1:41:53] sometimes we lean a little bit on our
[1:41:55] family members
[1:41:57] sometimes we lean a little bit on our
[1:41:59] friends we say if god don't come through
[1:42:02] then my friend gonna come through if god
[1:42:05] don't come through
[1:42:06] then my family gonna come through you
[1:42:08] gotta take them training wheels off
[1:42:12] amen stop leaning in this direction that
[1:42:14] direction
[1:42:15] get the bike balance amen with your own
[1:42:18] strength get the bike balanced
[1:42:20] and begin to ride that bike amen when
[1:42:23] you learn how to ride it without
[1:42:25] training wheels
[1:42:26] then god has established
[1:42:30] your goings
[1:42:33] glory to god and here's the last thing
[1:42:36] that happens when you learn how to wait
[1:42:39] the blessings that come from the trial
[1:42:41] of waiting the last thing that happens
[1:42:44] he puts a new song in your mouth
[1:42:49] and i now notice what david said he put
[1:42:51] it in my mouth not just in my heart
[1:42:54] because when god give you the song
[1:42:56] you're supposed to sing it
[1:43:00] he put a new song in my mouth even
[1:43:02] praise unto our god
[1:43:04] and know that they say many shall see
[1:43:06] y'all gonna hear what god did for me
[1:43:08] y'all gonna hear this and now not only
[1:43:11] are you gonna hear but the purpose of me
[1:43:13] sharing it is so that you can learn to
[1:43:15] fear god
[1:43:16] learn how to trust god know that he'll
[1:43:19] do the same thing for you
[1:43:21] many shall hear it many shall see it in
[1:43:24] fear
[1:43:24] and shall trust in the lord
[1:43:27] say i mean you don't know how your
[1:43:28] testimony helps somebody else
[1:43:31] when you're waiting you know we're we're
[1:43:33] helped by what abraham waited for
[1:43:36] we're helped by what uh noah waited for
[1:43:39] we're helped by what david waited for
[1:43:41] you know what i'm also helped by what
[1:43:43] you wait for
[1:43:47] glory to god let me read this
[1:43:50] quote here out of philadelphia church h
[1:43:55] hey jesus
[1:44:02] brother branham is referring to
[1:44:03] revelation 3 10.
[1:44:06] which which says because thou has kept
[1:44:09] the word of my patience
[1:44:10] this is a paragraph 3 12 3 it says
[1:44:14] because thou has kept
[1:44:15] the word of my patience i also will
[1:44:18] keep thee from the hour of temptation
[1:44:22] which shall come upon all the world to
[1:44:23] try them that dwell
[1:44:25] upon the earth it says what does he mean
[1:44:28] by the word of his patience hebrews 6
[1:44:31] 13-15 for when god made promised abraham
[1:44:35] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:44:36] swear by himself saying
[1:44:38] surely blessing our blessing and
[1:44:40] multiplying i will multiply thee
[1:44:42] and so after he had patiently endured
[1:44:47] he obtained the promise you see the
[1:44:50] spirit is speaking about the word of god
[1:44:53] which is given to us
[1:44:56] to wait for the fulfillment of that word
[1:44:58] required patience
[1:44:59] even as it did in the case of abraham he
[1:45:02] endured as seeing him who was invisible
[1:45:06] he was patient and the word finally was
[1:45:10] fulfilled
[1:45:12] this is the way god teaches his people
[1:45:16] patience says why if he fulfilled his
[1:45:20] word
[1:45:21] and physical manifestations
[1:45:24] the very instant you prayed you would
[1:45:28] never
[1:45:28] learn patience that means god could have
[1:45:30] did what you asked him to do a long time
[1:45:32] ago
[1:45:33] but the reason he has not done he's
[1:45:35] waiting for his appointed time during
[1:45:37] that
[1:45:37] he's giving you a man character
[1:45:41] glory to god you're developing character
[1:45:44] glory it says uh you would never learn
[1:45:47] patience
[1:45:47] but would become even more impatient
[1:45:50] with life
[1:45:51] let me now show you this truth even more
[1:45:53] fully set forth hebrews 11
[1:45:55] 17 by faith abraham
[1:45:58] when he was tried offered up isaac
[1:46:02] and he that had received the promises
[1:46:05] the word of god
[1:46:06] offered up his only begotten son
[1:46:10] he says there it is abraham was
[1:46:13] tried after he received the word of
[1:46:16] promise
[1:46:18] most think that as soon as we pray in
[1:46:20] jesus name
[1:46:22] over the good promises of god there
[1:46:24] could not be a trial
[1:46:27] but here it says that abraham was tried
[1:46:29] after
[1:46:31] he received the promise that is exactly
[1:46:34] correct
[1:46:35] according to the psalmist referring to
[1:46:37] joseph in psalms 105 19
[1:46:40] he says until the time that his word
[1:46:43] came
[1:46:44] the word of the lord tried him
[1:46:47] blessed be his name it said god
[1:46:50] gives us exceeding great and precious
[1:46:52] promises
[1:46:53] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[1:46:57] i want to tell you all that right now
[1:46:59] god ain't hurt god and forgot about your
[1:47:01] prayer
[1:47:01] god heard your prayer he he gave you a
[1:47:04] promise and he will fulfill it
[1:47:06] he will but from the time we pray
[1:47:11] until the time we give the answer we
[1:47:14] must learn to receive
[1:47:15] patience into our souls for only
[1:47:18] impatience do we possess
[1:47:19] life you know often times when we're
[1:47:21] waiting
[1:47:22] you know often times we stop praying why
[1:47:25] are we waiting
[1:47:26] you know we we we get to a point where
[1:47:28] we're not we're not even talking to god
[1:47:30] about it no more
[1:47:31] hallelujah we don't we don't forgot you
[1:47:33] know well the lord didn't do it in my
[1:47:34] time so i'm not going to say
[1:47:35] i'm not going to do nothing your faith
[1:47:37] ought to get stronger not weaker
[1:47:40] while you're waiting your faith is
[1:47:41] supposed to get stronger your actions
[1:47:42] should get stronger not weaker
[1:47:44] now don't wait to you receive what
[1:47:46] you're going to get to start praising
[1:47:48] god then amen you need to be in that in
[1:47:51] that channel right now

[1:48:14] i was thinking that you
[1:48:15] no no no no i'ma tell you something
[1:48:19] right now
[1:48:19] when you're approaching it that way what
[1:48:21] you actually just showed god is that you
[1:48:23] didn't really want a relationship with
[1:48:25] him
[1:48:26] you just want to use him
[1:48:31] all right you just want to use god for
[1:48:33] whatever you have need of
[1:48:35] god i'm gonna call you up when i have a
[1:48:36] need god want a relationship
[1:48:39] praise the lord amen so when when things

[1:48:45] things are going bad
[1:48:46] you still should be in prayer nothing
[1:48:48] should stop you from your prayer time
[1:48:51] and and just having having time
[1:48:53] committed to the lord

[1:49:00] going through nothing i'm ready
[1:49:02] i mean i'll do this but when i start
[1:49:04] going through i'm going to do something
[1:49:05] else

[1:49:07] through that's when desperation kick in
[1:49:10] desperation i mean you're just ready you
[1:49:12] lord i fast for you
[1:49:14] lord but as soon as you get as soon as

[1:50:02] motivated to serve god based on what he
[1:50:05] gives
[1:50:05] us he gave us enough when he went to the
[1:50:09] cross
[1:50:12] hallelujah church amen but i i mean the

[1:50:15] the we got to keep praying church got to
[1:50:17] stay on our knees got to keep doing
[1:50:19] everything we can just serving god no
[1:50:21] matter what the situation while we wait
[1:50:22] and be

[1:50:26] i'm finishing this up here it says god
[1:50:30] gives
[1:50:30] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:50:34] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[1:50:38] amen but from the time we pray
[1:50:41] until the time we get the answer we must
[1:50:44] learn to receive
[1:50:45] patience into our souls for only
[1:50:48] impatience do we possess
[1:50:49] life he goes on to say this may god help
[1:50:52] us to learn
[1:50:54] this lesson even as we know the people
[1:50:56] of the six
[1:50:57] age learn patience we read the history
[1:50:59] of the lives of these great christians
[1:51:01] what a contrast we see between their
[1:51:04] lives and
[1:51:05] hours for they were so patient and quiet
[1:51:08] and today we are all but overcome in uh
[1:51:11] and over impatience and haste
[1:51:15] we got to learn to just wait on
[1:51:18] the lords we gotta learn to just wait
[1:51:21] on the lord
[1:51:24] i want to finish by just telling the
[1:51:26] story
[1:51:28] uh as
[1:51:31] believers we are waiting on the second
[1:51:33] coming of the lord
[1:51:35] and since we're waiting we're gonna be
[1:51:37] faithful a god gonna find us
[1:51:39] a man uh uh busy about his work like
[1:51:42] like i said i'd rather
[1:51:44] i rather uh wear out than rust out
[1:51:48] right i'd rather be overzealous for the
[1:51:50] things of god and sometimes i get so
[1:51:52] tired and and i don't know why i mean i
[1:51:54] i know the
[1:51:55] the the people that lived in in uh years
[1:51:58] before us
[1:51:59] man they used to do so much more for the
[1:52:01] lord they prayed more than we pray
[1:52:03] they fasted more than we fast they had
[1:52:05] more services than what we have
[1:52:07] i mean they did so much for the lord but
[1:52:10] and now just seeing like
[1:52:11] we just tired after one service can't
[1:52:13] take no more than one servant
[1:52:15] right but i you know but but but here
[1:52:17] here um
[1:52:18] you know the thing is we're just gonna
[1:52:20] you know we we know we're waiting on the
[1:52:21] second coming lord and we just gotta
[1:52:22] remain faithful no matter what it is no
[1:52:24] matter how the devil tries us
[1:52:26] we're gonna remain faithful and i
[1:52:28] thought about this story
[1:52:29] that brother branham told about this uh
[1:52:32] young lady
[1:52:34] she was the niece of a
[1:52:37] man that owned a great ranch i believe
[1:52:39] out in colorado
[1:52:41] and uh and her parents had died and and
[1:52:44] she was the niece since she went out
[1:52:45] there and this man had five daughters
[1:52:48] uh she was a niece and you know they
[1:52:50] pretty much just treated her like
[1:52:52] like denise uh there was a time where
[1:52:55] these daughters heard that this this
[1:52:57] great businessman from chicago was on
[1:53:00] the way to
[1:53:01] colorado and he was bringing his his son
[1:53:03] who was uh
[1:53:04] you know the young man had not been
[1:53:06] married he was a bachelor eligible
[1:53:08] bachelor
[1:53:09] and they heard they heard that he was
[1:53:10] coming so the girls began to have
[1:53:12] conversations amongst themselves about
[1:53:14] oh i'm going to marry him and it's going
[1:53:16] to be this
[1:53:17] we're going to have this many kids and
[1:53:19] we're going to have this kind of life
[1:53:21] we're going to do this and the other
[1:53:22] girl said no i'm going to marry him and
[1:53:24] we're going to do this we gonna do that
[1:53:25] oh no you too young i'm dumb man
[1:53:28] they just talking about all the things
[1:53:30] that they was gonna do
[1:53:31] so they began to prepare themselves for
[1:53:34] a man this this boy coming they were
[1:53:35] gonna set up a
[1:53:36] a little party amen and invite this boy
[1:53:39] amen to just be there and
[1:53:41] and they they didn't realize it but the
[1:53:42] boy was actually coming
[1:53:44] looking for a wife hallelujah they never
[1:53:46] included
[1:53:47] the the lump the young the younger uh
[1:53:50] niece or the cousin in in their plans
[1:53:53] but the five sisters got themselves
[1:53:55] together bought their best dresses
[1:53:57] they went to the party trying to get the
[1:53:59] boys attention
[1:54:00] hallelujah but the boys walked into the
[1:54:02] house and he looked at the lady and said
[1:54:04] you know
[1:54:04] i didn't want these ladies out here

[1:54:08] i want somebody to look a little
[1:54:10] different a little homely

[1:54:14] to impress me but somebody's going to be

[1:56:42] prepared for the day that he come
[1:56:43] she began to save her money gotta dress
[1:56:46] together
[1:56:46] and brother branham say every day during
[1:56:49] a certain season
[1:56:50] she would put on the dress and she would
[1:56:53] walk out to the gate
[1:56:54] waiting for him to come one day would go
[1:56:57] by and the next day go by
[1:56:58] she done went through the process and he
[1:57:00] never came but she was
[1:57:02] faithful while she waited
[1:57:05] she was committed while she waited she
[1:57:08] kept the right
[1:57:09] attitude while she waited and finally
[1:57:12] one day
[1:57:12] after after going through all the
[1:57:14] criticism of the cousins that we told
[1:57:15] you he wasn't gonna come
[1:57:17] he's just like any other man he didn't
[1:57:18] got your hopes all up
[1:57:20] and now he dropping you she said no he
[1:57:22] told me that he gonna come and i believe
[1:57:24] what he said
[1:57:25] and maybe one day as the sun is going
[1:57:27] down she sees some
[1:57:29] some some horses galloping a man and a
[1:57:31] big cart
[1:57:32] a man coming across the hill she said i
[1:57:34] told y'all he was coming for me
[1:57:36] and here he come and say he said he said
[1:57:38] uh i'm here we're gonna get married i
[1:57:40] told you that i was coming
[1:57:41] she said she said i didn't know what was
[1:57:43] happening he said he said dear i had a
[1:57:45] man
[1:57:45] stationed here watching your behavior
[1:57:50] watching your actions watching your
[1:57:53] commitment
[1:57:54] watching everything that you was doing i
[1:57:57] had him here
[1:57:58] and he was reporting that back to me i
[1:58:01] couldn't let you down i had to get here
[1:58:03] for you
[1:58:05] he said not only that i brought a
[1:58:06] preacher with me
[1:58:08] and we're gonna get married right here
[1:58:11] in front of your cousins
[1:58:18] i'm gonna prove that i love you
[1:58:22] and the reason she was able to get
[1:58:23] married is because she was prepared
[1:58:26] while she was waiting i'm gonna tell you
[1:58:28] something when that lady left at home
[1:58:30] that day i guarantee she had herself a
[1:58:32] new song
[1:58:34] i i guarantee a man that uh all those
[1:58:37] i mean that she said she could probably
[1:58:40] say the same thing david said
[1:58:41] he inclined unto me and heard my cry
[1:58:45] he brought me up out of a horrible pit
[1:58:48] out of the mirror clay he set my feet
[1:58:51] upon a rock
[1:58:53] he's established my goings and he's put
[1:58:56] a new song
[1:58:57] in my mouth and i don't care what nobody
[1:59:00] say i'm gonna praise him
[1:59:02] because of what he's done for me he
[1:59:04] might not have done it for you
[1:59:06] but he's done it for me and he's worthy
[1:59:08] of my praise
[1:59:09] god bless you church god bless you
[1:59:13] glory to god
[1:59:17] amen musicians come let's have a word of
[1:59:19] prayer
[1:59:20] oh god
[1:59:24] lord help us to wait wait for the
[1:59:27] appointed time
[1:59:28] god we we know that uh you have certain
[1:59:31] promises that you've given us and
[1:59:35] sometimes the enemy tries to get us to
[1:59:37] to get ahead of the promise
[1:59:40] but jesus we we we we're hearing your
[1:59:43] voice just
[1:59:44] tell us wait just just be patient stay
[1:59:46] right where you at
[1:59:48] don't move don't do anything just just
[1:59:50] delay your actions
[1:59:52] just wait wait till you got a direct
[1:59:55] word for me
[1:59:56] wait till you you you see me do
[1:59:58] something then you know it's time for
[1:59:59] you to do it
[2:00:01] god help us to be sensitive to the voice
[2:00:03] of god
[2:00:06] we need it lord jesus we we we don't
[2:00:09] want to miss the blessing that you got
[2:00:10] for us
[2:00:12] we think about saul lord and god he lost
[2:00:16] his ability to be king because his he
[2:00:19] was unable to wait he was unable to do
[2:00:21] the things that you asked him to
[2:00:23] specifically do god
[2:00:26] lord help us to learn from these
[2:00:27] examples
[2:00:29] i pray o god that uh it won't just be a
[2:00:32] sermon that'll go in one ear
[2:00:34] and out the other but lord let it
