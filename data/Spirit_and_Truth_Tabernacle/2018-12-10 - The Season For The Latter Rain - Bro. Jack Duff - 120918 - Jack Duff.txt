heard her sister Rebecca's voices that would happen then I call us us Rebecca cuz I'm mrs. to Amanda didn't let me system end of the day yeah went on there all right all right praise the Lord all right but we think God thank God for all the saints that went over on yesterday to the meetings amen and celebrating brother Danny's birthday it was a real blessing I know to the Saints there they just they just love the fellowship and we had a wonderful time I was able to make it there further a Friday night service but had a funeral to attend on yesterday and had to leave and come back to Fort Pierce but uh but thank God for all the things that rested away and when went to be a part of that that is a part of fulfilling Hebrews 10:25 forsaking not to assemble yourselves together as you see the day drawing closer a man so we where the Prophet tells us that we should look to be a monk nervous it's not less services but we ought to be in more services as we see amen the return of our Lord is upon us oh praise the lord god bless you amen we just appreciate that and i don't know if i heard the announcement but this saturday is third saturday which means we have you service a man on this sadder so no service on friday but there will be a service on Saturday night that will start at 7 p.m. amen on this Saturday so keep that in mind praise the Lord Amen how many love the Lord Jesus I'm talking about really loving a man a man we certainly certainly appreciate God if you all would just get your Bibles we'll turn quickly a man to a couple scriptures and we will read our read from there and then James chapter 5 is where I'd like to meet our first scripture James 5 and then my second scripture is gonna come from the book of Zechariah chapter 10 a man James chapter 5 verse 17 praise the Lord a man says Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he went and he any period honestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain the earth brought forth her fruit also turn with me to Zechariah 10 verse 1 says askee of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in the field they meant the Lord and a blessing up to the reading of his word let's just run free the word of Prayer father we thank you for this privilege and opportunity to read the word is also a privilege to be able to stand and the corpse in the house of the Lord how grateful we are for all things that have happened amen the various songs that have gone forth and well we just appreciate the time of worship the the song leading even from the first note that was played on the keyboard we know that you were involved in it and father we just trust that as we enter now into a little fault here today that you were blessed us as the scripture promised showers of blessing God let it uh come upon us even on today we invite you now to take control over this portion of the service and every spirit that's against your spirit God we find it now according to the word of the Lord that gives us power to bind a man and to loose who told us what we bound on earth shall be bound in heaven what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so that we exercise our authority and take control of every spirit that is against the Spirit of God it's in the mighty name of Jesus that we pray amen and amen god bless you amen you can be seated this monitor is just a little too hot for me hear a little sound coming out of it I want to just take a man for our topic today the season for laddering a man the season for latter rain this is a little subject that has been in my heart for man over a year and and actually I am I I remember preaching on this back in I don't know his number of years ago but ASCII of the Lord rain I preached there and but I just I've just been noticing a few things and we took the scripture Zechariah 10 and we sent it out to the brothers amen prayer meeting this week and this was the scripture that we were using to pray over a ski of the Lord rain in the time of the latter ring and one of the things that I that I had noticed is it seems like there's a number of things that we've been praying for over the year and I have watched God answer those prayers a man I've watched him you know I mean we've been praying for people to be blessed with cars and homes and jobs and you know whatever a lot of natural blessings I've just seen God just making Wayne a man God has done some supernatural things for us this year and and I'm very grateful but I'm also mindful the fact that if God is answering our natural requests a man then I'm also an expectation for God to do something with our spiritual requests and wanted a spiritual request that we keep on our list is we constantly ask God for fillings and reef fillings of the Holy Ghost amen and and I'm the reason that you know I feel like the season for this particular sermon has come as you know we were you know I was last we got law which sermon do I go with do I go with this one or do I go it's settled it and and the Lord you know said go what settle it and we did that and I was grateful because I saw different people actually settling amen on last Sunday and and so what's this once it's settled hallelujah well once you've made a commitment a man that you go you gonna give you all to the Lord's a man once you've done that the Bible actually tells us that amen Satan will leave and not and what he does is that he'll come back amen to a house and if the house has a resident hallelujah if the house has a resident then the devil realizes he's not welcome Amen that the eviction notice that he received was real and you cannot come back to this place that you once lived in but if he finds the place empty hallelujah then he comes back with seven other devils and the last estate is greater or worse than the first estate so it's so important that this time Amen we ask God three hallelujah and I'm declaring that this is the season for it because amen no matter how much you want to settle it you came do it and good will you can't do it in a with with just good intentions you got to be able to do this with the Holy Goose colony so when were asking God for latter way we're asking God for a down pouring outpouring of the Holy Ghost and I know the coach and everybody ask you of the Lord rain Lord let it rain let it rain in here and let me tell you something about winged way don't care whether you a sinner All Saints everybody go get it back to the ring if natural way will affect everybody out there why can't spiritual ring affect anybody inside ha I believe it's gonna happen because they were gathered in the upper room what the Sababa say they will feel with the Holy Ghost whether you want it or not you don't get it anyway because you're in the right place at the right time I'm asking God for rain this is the season for rain we need the ring we need the rain I don't want to see the up-and-down anymore I don't want to see the in and out anymore but the only way we can get that if people have to get rain the seed has been planted but now we need some moisture in order for the seed to grow it must have ring amen hallelujah glory to God see you know we know that the the letter the the the the Spirit gives life see I mean the letter the letter itself it will die but we need to go with the letter and what we had last week is a lot of people say Lord I'm selling it today they think they actually turned in their resignation letters they told the devil I'm resigning from sin I'm tired of you I mean this this debt that you got me amen I've added this and I've added that and I've added this and made my tab is getting pretty high here but I gotta settle this thing and then you look at the bill oh my god you ever you know our little story of a you know look couple went out to eat two couples it may went out to eat together and you know they were just ordering and ordering and you know and then they are one couple said well we'll take care of the tab when it comes and the waiter brought them brought them to check and they looked at and say oh we'll take care of half of it right because they realized they didn't have enough money to take care to check and when you realize your debt of sin is so high a man your mama can't pay this your daddy can't pay this now let you can't even pay this you got knees body to settle this thing play in Jesus Christ has settled it somebody I mean I saw people lift their hands in the presence of the Lord say I'm selling this thing this weekend and then I and I'm so happy about that but I realized that if we don't go further and receive the Baptist or all the ghosts then we'll go right back into the same state that we were in so that's why I'm saying this is the season a man to ask for a lot of rain amen this is the season for latter rain now let me you know we were we were praying that oh this week and just the brothers we you know I told them you know what what we wanted to just kind of start praying about and we was over here in this little nursing we just start praying and everybody start calling out for ladder rain and and Lord just let it rain praying for the Holy Ghost to move inside the church and the sisters was gathered on the other side and before you know we heard the sisters over there clapping their hands and worship in and I say Lord it's raining God is raining in here and we began to praise God for the rain hallelujah and and I need you to understand the rain was coming from a prayer meeting Oh glory the rain was coming from a prayer meeting we're gonna get into that a little bit later Amen but we must see that this is important hallelujah you you know you realize that Elijah's top ring with prayer and Elijah bring back with prayer hallelujah a man soso church with the prayer meeting is is important active preppy the prayer meeting is just as important as Sunday morning the partying is just as important as Wednesday nights the poor meeting is a very important service because that's where the rain starts I'm going to show you that in Scripture lord help us today amen but that's where the rain starts and another thing we found out this morning is that you know the devil uses a trick to try to get us to worship God silently that that's a trick of the enemy to try to get us the worship God silently you know the devil is the one that tells you you're gonna be embarrassed God don't tell you that you're gonna be embarrassed the devil tells you that and you can't listen to the devil where God struck your heart you gotta you gotta you gotta exercise a man some some some praise back to him thank you Jesus glory to God amen don't be ashamed to give God glory he the one that gave you your breath he the one that gave you your strip he the one that gave you your job he's the one doing all these things so don't be afraid to give him praise come on church it's a trick of the enemy to get us the worship God silently come to give them priests all right I want to just kind of share a couple of things and I remember this the seeds in falada rain lift the season Ford I got a couple of things I just need to share first I want to read from a little a website that I found some information now this this morning I was listening and from the first note that was played the first song today was Holy Spirit rain on us right first first song we come out the gate with Holy Spirit rain on us and then from that I heard Holy Spirit rain down right so as I start looking I said Lord here it is it's time right into the sermon for the day amen the season for latter rain watch this down you know and now in Israel rain is extremely important right in Israel we found out that rain is it's very important the other thing I found out a man is that in Jerusalem out of 365 days a year rain only happens about 44 days out of 365 days a year right and you know so so so for them when rain comes our width or actual impetus rate when the season for rain comes they begin to get desperate because they realize if they don't get rain then that it might mean death many times you find in Scripture that many of them will have to leave the Land of Israel a family was set in because they did not get rain rain was extremely important so they have they have sisters just about every mountain multiple sisters there to try to capture the rain as it comes and they used it as a reservoir hallelujah amen they need that reservoir in order to sustain them throughout the year until the next season comes you gonna need a reservoir amen and sustain you until the next season comes hallelujah and what we found out in Israel is that their rainy season amen is the month of January December January February that's their rainy season come on somebody we are in the month of December right now hallelujah so so when we look at this scripture it is literal this is the season for rain that the people in Israel they rejoice when rain happens you know I was reading this little article here and it said you know because Israel's water supply is so dependent on rainfall Israelis hope pray and beg the heavens for winter rains it says a particularly torrential rain is known as a ringing of blessing so when they get a torrential rain would say which they actually just had some a couple of people lost their lives because of some of the flooding that they had over there in certain parts of Israel he said but when they get a mentor torrential rain it is known as a raining of blessing listen and Hebrew so you won't hear anybody cook grumble about a rainy day there in Israel not even a little children complain about rain now you know that this this guy goes on the kind of riding them saying how you know when they first arrived there in Israel there was there was at their house and and there was a local school in the area where they live and one day they just heard all this noise you know all these kids come running out of the school in there trying to figure out what is going on why why are the kids a man acting like this and what happens that you know they stepped outside the seeing and the kids were actually rejoicing because of the rain I like that I like when the children can rejoice because of rain I don't we got it but in this season I'm looking for the children Oh hallelujah I'm looking for the young people to have an experience in this season and they begin to rejoice because of rain oh we will see mamma rejoice we are seeing that every to us but let the children break loose let the children experience God hallelujah somebody that's what we're asking God for our children experience it Oh glory to God this is the season for CH now let me just kind of go on a little further here a man this is coming out of the message resume of the ages resume of the ages glory to God thank you Lord Jesus all right it says this this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church will return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power right a man see I mean we got to have the dynamics to go along with these mechanics so it must be a return of dynamic power now let me also just get make sure we understand this this is not something that we're trying to manufacture this is not something that we're trying to make happen but what I am trying to get you to see is that we are in the season of it so when you enter the season of it you begin to get under expectation hallelujah amen just like the Israelis when they get into the season of winter they expect rain they begin to pray for rain right amen and when rain comes they rejoice in the rain this is the way we need to be expect rain and rejoice when rain comes young people let me just say let me just kind of break it down this way if you see the Spirit of God moved everybody in here can tell when the atmosphere shifts I don't care how old you are how young you are you can tell when the atmosphere shifts saw my encouragement to you when the atmosphere atmosphere shifts in turn and don't just look at it God is coming down to do something special for you that's it if they make you cry fine if you make yourself fine if it make you jump fine if it make you run fine if it make you speak in tongues fine that's exactly what we are looking for hallelujah Lord sin the rain amen listen so he say said we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believers sense this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century now we're going to go on amen in this quote and read a little bit more of how the the you know this was actually the Pentecostals right before the Pentecostal committee organization got started they began to sense that a move of God was a man what's supposed to happen they begin to sense that experience in and when they sensed it the next thing they did was begin to pray and if I can just get the church to sense that this is the season for then everybody will begin to play come on you know you need God to touch your child you know your you know your child needs the Holy Ghost right you you know that and without it they not gonna make it well I don't care how much you explain this and explain that without the spirit that child is not gonna make it and God don't have grandchildren they can't give you know your experience they got ahead own experience why not have it that when you invite one of your backflip children searched at this reining in here but you know one that gotta create that atmosphere hallelujah we want them all to be soaked when they leave here God's it rang rang we meet Moisture come on somebody the believer since this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century I'm going on what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit now now that seemed to be the answer but that does not negate the fact that we should experience that in the church Amen we still should see the speaking in tongues in the manifestation of the gifts and I'm going a little further amen I'm looking for that in the fourth generation I'm looking for the manifestation of the gifts in the fourth generation I've seen it in my generation but now I'm looking for a man in the fourth generation not just to come and leave but something to come and stick hallelujah I know the gifts are there but we got to anoint this it man says listen he says manifest gifts of the Spirit it was but it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the formal rain which is the spring or teaching ring right the latter rain then is the harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teach and rain had not come so what he said as a prophet had not been sick so Pentecost has started out before the prophet went out on the field so all they had a man was a harvest ring right amen a form of rain but but what we're looking for is the Lateran the teaching has come hallelujah so we're promised that I have both a former and latter rain that's the season that we're in listen to this he says how could this be the real thing when the teach and rain had not come the Prophet messenger who was who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal father's had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final friend of quickening unto the rapture hat and I come now I want to make sure we get it clear what Pentecost hat was real hey man what Pentecost had Amen the manifestation of gifts that was real that was a platform that God was building from right but but what happened is that they first took the word hallelujah Amen what the Lutheran's hat was right what the method is hat that it was right they had a portion of it they did not have all of it now we got all of it hallelujah and that's why I want I want to make sure I you know I put emphasis on it we ought to expect every gift that God put in the Bible to be manifested right here on this Amen if we're not seeing it something on it we ought to keep praying we got to keep praying until we see God do what he did in Scripture if our hearts have been turned back to the world why can't we have what's in the word I'm a sad again if our hearts have been turned back to the Lord why can't we have what is in the word I'm on the expectation for and this is the season that I'm declaring it in Israel their rainy season is December January this sermon goes forth in December I'm looking for something to happen I'm under expectation now let me tell you something I'm not waiting to a February meeting I am I'm looking for God to do something by the time February come everybody else to just be catching up they would be reaping from the benefits of the black not just one blessing showers that's what the Bible promised not just one service were out born many services of our pours shelves are blessing a shower in prayer meeting a shower always a night Oh hallelujah Amen even you want to take a shower every day sometimes twice today if you wrote that in the natural rock' we have showers in the spiritual not just one time not just one month but the entire year showers of blessings I've seen the shells of natural blessings I've seen it so many people been blessed this one got a car that went got this every time we turn around somebody being blessed with something but why can't we have that spiritually why can't we here I was fear with the Holy Ghost I was we filled with the Holy Ghost oh my god got ahold of my heart I've been sinks showers everybody impacted Lord we saw in this seat Amen we're so in this seat because if you saw the right seat this is what will come up hallelujah hallelujah don't be afraid now I'm already let you know God gonna move because we're in the season now remember the little kids rejoice when the rain came they got outside and they stood there for minutes just rejoicing in the rain right and this is what we want our young people to do get ready to rejoice in the rain the spiritual rain Oh glory to God Amen you know when you were younger you like used to like to play in the rain their parents had to get you out of it right a man but you had no problem if it Reyna I want to play a little bit in the rain well we got some spiritual rain coming you can play in this too and we're not going to pull you out of that glory if it just so happened a man that that service is over and you still enjoying the rain stay right there we'll wait for you glory to God Act will wait for your son come back in and intend with you Oh hallelujah somebody hey man I'm not talk about manufacture so I'm just telling you what to expect when the rain falls all right all right all right all right let me let me go on and read this now he says the hearts of children back to the Pentecostal father's had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the rapture had not come he says in it was a mixture of unrighteous particular spiritual blessing and manifested in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power as men were under the control of Devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before second generation that appear organized and wrote their unscripted doctrines and built their own fences as every other group of Hell ahead ahead of them did now you know we're not looking for for that to try to start some new group after a man the rain falls no we just stay right with the word expecting what God promised us hallelujah hallelujah we know that we've received the teaching rain amen we know brother Branham brought that teaching rain so now we're under expectation for amen in the latter rain now let's look at something here let's look at a scripture Joel to a man verse 21 go already God just put this in the Word of God Joel - 21 hallelujah it's fear not ol and be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things anybody believe that a man I'm talking about spiritually because we've seen the natural blesses but the Lord gonna do something great spiritually a man say fear not ol and be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things be not afraid the beast of the field for the pastures of the wilderness to spring for the tree bear their fruit the fig tree and the vine to yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God amen for he has given you the former rain moderately oh my and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in Oh hallelujah I told you this was a season for it supposed to happen in the first month we put ourselves in Scripture right so so here God is setting this thing up so we ought to be under expectation for something to happen in the first month Oh hallelujah Church Lord again I tell you I'm not waiting on a meeting Amen I'm looking for God to do something let me let me encourage y'all right now come to church be ready to worship before the song lead even get up here hallelujah I mean the first song might might send us down a path where the anointing will strike this church we won't even very well meet won't even be able to minister on a day like that why not have a service like that Oh hallelujah one time the glory Lord came down so strong that the minister cannot even minister Amen why not have a service like that church amen but notice the scripture here now it says that the former and the latter II in the first month glory to God and the floor should be full of wheat and the VAT shall overflow with wine and oil and I love this and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm oh my god amen and in the season of rain you can expect restoration did you get that church this is a season to expect it right notice this this is what God don't do right this is not this is not you making this happen this is a promise from God and all you got to do is is rest on it I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten and see this is a whole nother sermon I can't get into all this but the years that the locusts have eaten the cake of worm and the caterpillar and the Pomeroy my great army which I sent among you listen and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed thank God for his promise listen and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else my people shall never be ashamed verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon him oh I told you in the right place at the right time I'm going to plop my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters what shall prophesy that mean they gonna be touched by this oh I'm not looking for another move of the Spirit well only the older people are retorted this is something where everybody gonna get it your sons and your daughters shall prophesy right amen your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also from the service of from the hand mates in those days will I pour out my spirit let's go and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered oh I'm happy about that I am so happy about that whosoever shall call upon the name of Lord shall be deliver for a mount zion and in jerusalem shall be delivers as a lot of sale and in the remnant whom the lord shall call so we've taken this and we're putting this right back in the scripture this is an expectation a meant from a prophecy there and by Joe on the day of Pentecost when Peter stood up and they say you know this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel well amen Peter could identify the promise that was in the scripture but what happened on the day of Pentecost was not the I wasn't the only time that was going to happen because according to Joseph see in the last days not last day in the last days it was pluralized a manner in the last days are still here so if they gather that Pentecost and they did not you factor it hallelujah we can have the same thing they had Pentecost and we can start praying for that in the season of ring let me let me just you know our little something I want to share you know in Israel you're going man even in the desert they got they got trees blossoming in the desert like crazy you'd be surprised I mean I mean we saw we saw dates and and mangoes banana trees and I'll and in a desert you wonder hi I mean it didn't look like a land flowing look at honey it was in a desert but see what happened what they said say all we need is just some water if we can get water we can make anything grow in the desert I don't know if you got it if if we can just get water we can make anything grow in the desert so your your your your relative in their situation that seems impossible women in sisters we can make anything grow if we can just get water to it water is all you need and desert to rings if you are backslidden get water hallelujah amen if your life is in shambles get some moisture right if your attitude and your heart is hardened all you need to change your situation is water and what type of what are we talking about spiritual water Holy Spirit laying on us it's alright you know when you when you plant anybody ever ever planted a garden here doesn't they raise your hand if you ever planted anything all right now you all know that when you plant that's the hard part that's when you you know you out there with your you know your your rake and you got a hole you got all kind of stuff you're getting rocks out the way you're getting all kind of stuff before you put your seed and you got to prepare it and today we're preparing this crown hallelujah hey glory to God we if we gotta we gotta press through tiredness and I know some of y'all weird from a long drive it's okay it's okay God still had this seat for you today and all you got to do is open up a man the womb of your spirit to receive this seat and say that's Lord I might be tired but I'm taking that in I'm saying amen to that guy because I'm looking for that I want that type of rain guards I look all you all we gonna do is just proud but you just Martin my words amen i I feel I feel like like spin thus saith the Lord it's gonna rain all this go rain it is pouring you might as well get ready if you've ever planted a garden you actually expect rain your God will not grow if you don't get ring and brother we don't prepare this we don't got the same out we don't got this out real I got people repeating all that that happened now we're looking for rain and I believe Amen by God's grace we gonna see some rain and everybody gonna be impacted by this Oh glory hallelujah glory glory glory listen if your life is in shambles all you need is some moisture if your attitude your heart is hardened you just need some water and let me tell you this a seat will reach its full potential once it has come in contact with water I want to say that again a seat will reach its full potential once it has come in contact with water brother Branham talked about how you know the apple tree every Apple that will reap that will come forth from my apple tree was actually already inside of a seed and all we had to do is get the ground prepared put the seed in the ground commit it to the earth glory to God I'm not just because I don't see fruit I'm not gonna pick it up I'm gonna commit it to the earth and I'm an expect rain and the rain will produce amen what was what was already in the seat amen you realize that the student got this the Cena's got prepared for life in some of it hallelujah if I put an apple seed in the ground I'm expecting apples glory to God let me just kind of let just share something here because the Prophet makes a statement I want to I got a I got AI got a just drop these things in all glory glory glory glory this is our spoken word as the original seed you see there's uh there's multiple seeds that have been planted brother Branham talked about the denominational seat that went into the ground and said that air was also a word seed that went into and when that word seat goes then we can expect the word to come forth look at this let me just read a couple quotes out of this spoken words the original seed Part 2 says someone asked me to repeat that that Hebrew word again enjoy the second chapter Joelle 228 where he's speaking of the coming of the form and latter rain the word former and the Hebrew word is the Hebrew word mou reh more which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we've had the teacher rain and we're ready now for the harvest ring you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop growing then just before it matures there comes another crop that's what they call the harvest rain we know when it is the spring rains amen and then the rains about June it makes you it makes your crop now the rain we found out was the spirit now we left off at where I gave my thought of of what the whole thing will be that is I believe the rain has been brought the rain that's the reason we're quieting down because the ground is already sold over you can't find it anywhere Hartley but what what has been so and it's went out through radio televisions tapes word everything it's sold the country down it's planted seeds now what seeds was planted you cannot get nothing else from it but what seed that was planted can you stand now it'll be the Seas that's planet now the spirit will fall I like that I like that I'm a paragraph 15 on that say the spirit will fall but it'll bring the harvest of the seed that it falls on saying I remember that's all right now notice now he say the spirit will fall and and I am under expectation for a man a holy spirit a true Holy Ghost revival I'm just setting it all or God no that's that's exactly what we need here listen I mean you can settle it all you want to but if you don't get the baptism the Holy Ghost you won't make it you won't make it you'll go right back to the same thing that you was in before so that's why it's important that we make sure that we plant this seat this is what we're looking for now now a little further here amen in this talk amen amen amen amen let's see something here now oh yes this is out of the message the end time science seat the end time science see amen he said there's a revival going on what is it a sowing you don't hear very much a Billy Graham no more do you what about all what about the rest of them you know the great revive the revival fires not burning what is it it's the endtime seed sign the war's has been sown what is it denomination will reap denomination that makes them Confederate that that makes them Confederate themselves together now you know what the Prophet actually said is that and I got it I got a quote here he says like the the the Pentecostals that saw it and he said Hagar all bring themselves together and go right back to the Catholic Church right he said that's thus saith the Lord as they're happening he say and when that happens that's what's gonna put the pressure on us hallelujah and just now you think about it people that that that might have been with us that went back amongst the Pentecostals they can really put pressure on us because they know exactly what we believe hallelujah amen but I can tell you this much I don't care what anybody does I'm expecting a rapture amen there will be a great kitchen away so we don't have to run for me thing but understand there will be some pressure that comes a man listen to this he says denomination will reap denomination that makes them Confederate themselves together but the Word of God has been all been sold also and when the Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of God will live in the people I like that I like that amen we haven't even seen a real revival yet we experienced just some little things here net but we ever seen the real thing he said when the Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of God will live in the people don't worry about it just keep sitting here this word will live in you see you you've been trying to figure this thing out with your hands this is not something you can do the only thing you can do a surrender but God can do this himself Mary can have that baby by herself but Mayor said be it unto me according to your word that's all God asked you to do a surrender and he'll bring this thing to pass watch it Church listen the world of God has been sold also and when the Spirit of God begins to fall the Word of God will live in the people and the false bride that's committed adultery out there and brought herself into grieves and sold out her birth rights will reap what a confederation of church that's to be bound and burn like the thorns and thistles but where the Word of God has been sold into the people's heart it will reap a Bride of Christ as certain as I'm standing here in time science church I'm on the expectation now let me uh just a couple other things that I just want to share there's a scripture that I want to hit Oh glory to God glory to God hearing the planting the vine and where to plant it and then we're going to hit a scripture I want to just show you something we're going to go first kings in a second this Litton's followed me here with planting the vine and where the planet says oh go with me to Arizona let me take you to the desert which I roam so many years everything in the desert has a groaning and and if you ever if you ever been there you know they they took pictures in front of the cactus it just it's just in the wintertime it's still peasants in the summertime is still pensive right no matter what time of year is still pensive right they say they say everything in the dancer has a sticker on it and any little plant you come to don't get near it'll stick you and that's the way some folk are you don't want to get near them because they'll stick you yes they will let me tell you something if they talking about somebody to you then they'll talk about you to somebody then we'll stick you listen if they say cut though don't get up don't get near it'll stick you it always got stickers right out ready to stick anything that comes near that sticker is a leaf rolled up for the left of my hold on what's the matter what made it a sticker it's because there had no water that's what made it a sticker it had no water that's what dried it up and if we know if we're not careful our experience will dry up that's why we need a refill another Holy Ghost we need water and this is a season ask on Fort listen that's what rotted up that sticker is a leaf rolled up for the lack of water it becomes a sticker that is with thus thus it is with the church today that when the church gets away from the fountain of life when it gets away from the joys of salvation when it gets away from the Lord God then that person becomes a sticker always finding fault so if if you leave service today and you found some phone in it maybe you need some water I'm talk about spiritual water hallelujah it becomes this always finding fault sticking no sooner you come up I'm a presbyterian I'm a Methodist I'm sorry so don't talk to me about that stuff us Vica it has no fruits you take that same plant cactus and put it into lamb for a few generations look at that put into a lab for a few generations where there's plenty of water and that sticker will unfold and will come but when were and will come a soft leaf bearing fruit see it's all about the environment and what we're trying to do is get people in the right environment and let me tell you something hallelujah being quiet does not create the right environment can I can we just be honest even in a club you weren't quiet you made noise in a club all right if you go to a football game you make noise a man you go to a basketball game you make noise just about everywhere you go for entertainment you make noise why you don't come here and be quiet if there's ever time to shout it's this time now there's every time to get used it's time now hallelujah somebody amen we have to create the environment for God to move now now I told you we read this scripture here where Elijah was a man of like passions oh my god and he prayed earnestly that it rained not and it didn't rain right but then he prayed again and it did rain let's look at something here in in first Kings 19 let's look at this oh yes Lord it won't be manufactured it'll be the real thing hey man it'll be the real thing first Kings 19 I'm starting at verse 41 thank you Jesus is that right do I have the right I got the wrong thing hold on one second it might be first Kings 18 first Kings 18 and verse 41 oh yes yes yes yes yes look at this first Kings 18 verse 41 and Elisha said unto a hab now before I read that the first oven first King 17 and one first King 17 to 1 it says this and Elijah the Tishbite who was other inhabitants of Gilead said in 1/2 as a Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word so here Elijah had the power to actually stop it from rina one man in the hands of God had the power to stop the ring and it stopped raining for three and a half years and I told you it was that was critical they meant to Israel if they didn't get rain they were in trouble right they only had so many years I mean so many days out of the year that they would get rain and here a man instead of saying it's not gonna rain - I call for it think about that now here in 1st Kings 18 we see we're three and a half years go by and here's a here's here's Elijah a man preparing a call for rain now before he could call from for rain I want you to catch this - as we're picking us up in verse 41 before he could call for rain he had to get rid of the false doctrines that was among them see he had to get rid of a man the false prophets that was in the mists hallelujah it may he had to get rid of the false interpretations all of this had to be gone before rain could come Jesus glory to God church amen no rain until all that was taken care of so that's why last week we had to settle it and now this week we can start asking for rain and and not only accident but start living under expectation because we read the scripture that rain was supposed to come in the first month mmm look at this first Kings 19 now look at this first one and then I just said in a hat get the up eat and drink but there is a sound of abundance ring he says so a hat went up to eat and to drink and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees and said to a servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times listen and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said Behold there arise if a little cloud I don't see like a man's hand and he said go up Santa Ahab prepare by chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped V not and I want to go back and just look at that because we always read that pretty fast but I want you to catch something verse 44 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said there ho there arise if a little crowd out of the sea that is this this cloud came actually from the sea now usually rain come down from heaven but this cloud came from the sea oh my god now now now I started looking at that just a little deeper you know because I know over the book of Revelation brother Branham talked to see amen as multitudes of people Oh somebody help me here if the sea is typed as multitudes of people and the cloud came from where out the sea can I put it this way the cloud came out of a prayer meeting [Music] that's what released terrain from the prayer meeting a cloud came up out of the sea and what happened on earth metrobús going on already anyway my goddddd ring but it came out of the sea from the multitude of people Elijah prayed that it would not rain and then Elijah prayed that it would ring it came out of the sea I'm telling the prayer means gonna be pretty important it's gonna get gonna get it's gonna get serious Church it's about to get serious and I cannot stress this enough I told you when when Abraham got the revelation of what was getting ready to happen down in Sodom what did Abraham do he went to prayer and if you are truly the seed of Abraham you can't help but get in prayer amen if we come up to a point where prayer meeting them be one of the most important services and let me tell you something amen we cannot be a prosperous church until we get everybody in one accord here hey man church you tell me you got you tell me your schedule that busy huh how come you find time to do all this other stuff [Music] hey man glory to God you find time to get everything else done but you can't find time to get the prayer done on something wrong with that that's the devil and then i'ma tell you i'ma just be honest with it's the devil that tell you I don't want to pray out loud that's the devil that's the devil I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you when you pray loud when it's a emergency God and God don't have no no no difficult time hear you call his name minister emergency how come you can't pray out loud when it's not an emergency oh come on somebody cannot just i'ma just talk to y'all just for a little bit I'm going bad in my subject but by let me let oh my I did that the cloud came out to see listen church let me just let me just a wife will not be satisfied with a husband that does not say with his I love you a wife won't stay here her husband speak those were when they talk it all yelling or talk to me when they talking on the phone I love you I love you I love you I'll and she ain't gone she'll call you hang up you walk so she gonna call you right back I love you she will be here them words coming out of your mouth and if a wife won't be satisfied you're guarding gonna be satisfied with an I love you coming from your heart God wanna hear you say it [Music] hallelujah hopeless wanna hear you see why is willing hear you say children want to hear you say God wanna hear you say something I'm telling you we just read the church age books and see that this all this go together all this connected right we heard we're in Sunday school this morning we got the church age book which tell us that the devil like to use silence the devil like to use silence the devil like the train that your God is silent so why don't you be silent that's a trick of the enemy your God is not silent Halloween we need to come a church without a loud voice it's been too good to be quiet it's been too good to be quiet all right Amen Church we got we got to get to the point where I'm not afraid to you know just express myself to God I love him and this is my prayer the prayer that you praying is not for the people that sitting around if you praying that type of read you praying the wrong prayer if somebody got a problem with how you pray that's a problem let me also tell you something else they can't answer your prayer they can't stop it they came to none watch with your prayer that goes to God and God alone when I pray I'm not praying to the ones that's in the room that's you and not my god I'm praying I'm praying in my own good I'm praying my father hallelujah somebody I don't a man I pray to my father so I'm not I'm not interesting what other folk got got say about my prayer I'm only interested in what he got to say and since this is the season look women went when even the children and Israel rejoiced in the ring because they realized the importance of it listen if we as a congregation can understand the importance of having the Holy Ghost everybody ought to be rejoicing in this all right notice where the rain came from the cloud came from from the sea from the sea is going up see is only pretty much attached to the earth it's going up but it meant something in heaven Oh glory to God let's look at it let's look at it verse 44 and it came to pass at the seventh time that'd be behold there arises a little cloud and at that seventh time that type to the seventh church age just so the seventh is the completion right that the seventh amen behold air rises a little cloud and that's all that's all it take is a little something a little a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say them to AI prepare thy chariot and got it and get thee down that the rain stopped he not and it came to pass in the meanwhile look at this that the heaven was black with clouds and went now see typically that's what we always looking up in the sky to see when it's gonna rain but this rain started from the sea from a prayer meeting because Elijah prayed that it did not rain and Elijah also prayed that it would ring and the cloud came from the sea but it meant something from heaven my god and when heaven and earth meet something about to happen heaven is already prepared waiting for us on earth to get prepared and when heaven and earth meet something great is gonna happen look at it search and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and a half road and went to Jezreel and the hand of the Lord was only larger and it girded up his Lawrence and ran before a hat to the entrance of Jezreel the noise was so great on Elijah that he outran a chariot outran a horse that's anointed that is anointed I think they try to get Jesse Owens to that's the one of these guys to try to do that one no no no you can't be you can't be Elijah right it takes the anointing to do that and church you know I I'm expecting this an anointing to strike this is the season for the latter rain now I want to just you all been hearing me quote this over and over again and I got to put it here again to try to show you what season we in here it is Ephesian Church H y'all gonna get tired of this quote but you know what this is what we're looking for in this season see once you come once once you find out where you standing then you know what to look for look at this nevertheless I mean revelation 2 for never less I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love to understand this you must realize the Spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Effie's Ephesus alone this messages to the entire age which lasted about a hundred and twenty years its message then as to all generations in that span here it is now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and that vestige means no trace of the original flame and I talk to you how it was only in this generation that we begin to try to push the Prophet to the side no no no no to push the prophet to the side hallelujah hallelujah let me let me let me let me let me say this you know Elijah carried on where he like left off eli eli ja for rain hallelujah and and and and it rain now in this season Eli just not here but he like shut is and he like shut the spirit of Elijah dust rest only like shut and here in this season we can start praying for rain and expect the same thing that Elijah got in the scripture stay with me now but the only way that you gonna have their Norton any larger hat is you have to keep your eyes the only way Elijah got what he lies ahead Elijah had to keep his eyes only lied John so don't don't try to take the profit from me and say I'm not I'm not talking about some denominational rain I'm told by bright ring oh that's what I'm under expectation for come on we oh my god why are we gonna let denominations have the gifts and not we don't want him no more what is that it cannot the gifts were for you the rain was not further the briars and the thistles the rain was for the wheat the rain was for you don't let somebody else enjoy your blessings you ought to receive it and look forward to it that is a part of your harvest that's a part of your clock every gift that God putting about I'm telling you I'm just I'm just letting you know not and everywhere the other let me go further a little further we're not we're not talking about something come upon you and you ain't living the life we talked about that they may like brother branham win amongst the Pentecostals and one one man living with somebody that ain't his wife but he got gifts we don't want that we don't I mean look you got a wife you keep your eyes on your wife praise the looked a man but we not talk about that that's what happened to denominations amen you know wife-swapping and all kind of stuff and still got getting on oh no no no no no we don't want we don't want we don't want to definitely have nothing with this praise the Lord but this gonna be pure and clean this gonna be holy it's gonna be right you gonna be living something and if you can live it before before the brain came don't worry after the Holy Ghost come upon you you shall receive power and when you get this kind of powers gonna help you live right all right let me let me finish this quote because that this quote is what tells me that I'm in the season and since I'm in the season when the children Israel coming to the season of rain they begin to pray for it we're in the season look at history keeps repeating something in the generation of the Israel Israel we see revival one generation don't see the fires fading in the next in the third generation embers maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestige what's over the original flame and this is it right here because now now now can i but let's be honest with ourselves we have seen everything that the prophet had talked about and this quote manifested before eyes we've seen it but the part that we haven't seen is this next part then God likes the fire again and the same process is repeated so that's why I say this is the reason for latter rain right because we are not season of venkata I have seen everything else now I'm looking for the theme card part and that's why I say in the fourth generation they're gonna be the ones to experience this get ready fourth generation God is coming Oh hallelujah hallelujah and I'm glad we got some fourth generation believers actually I'm the expectation they say amen to that I have seen the devil do this and the devil do that look and brother and say when all hell break loose then we ought to be looking for all heaven to break loose and you can't tell me you ain't seen all hell break loose and if all hell is done what is that what is now let's look for all heaven let's expect that not only expect it let's start praying for that as for that type of rain because this is the season Ville a terrain let me finish this today with this this quote and let me as I'm just preparing this this is going to come out of that the sermon why I am a Holy Roller and just just so that you all understand I was just you know listening to a sermon there spoken words original seating brother branham saying every generation gets this chance at the revival every generation so fourth generation y'all get ready for y'all chance at the revival get ready for your chance because every generation gets their chance at the revival oh my god a chance at the word this is why I am a Holy Roller this is a rather lengthy quote but I think it would be a blessing to us amen as we bring closer to I thought here today a man there's a little cloud rising from the sea I believe that multitudes of people Amen why I am a Holy Roller oh my as I was why I would tell you why I why I am a holy ruler yes sir I see the signs coming up now notice to notice the title that's discernment why I am a Holy Roller I mean he's not ashamed of being identified with people that speak in tongues people that shout people that jump no I am a Holy Roller I'm identifying myself can I tell you something you know you might wonder why you in the school that you in and why you the only believer you know what God has strategically placed you there in order to bring judgment upon those that will not walk according the truth and it needs at least one light and darkness so and can you imagine that God looking around to try to find one person that'll be light in darkness and he picks you so you could handle it you can you can go against the grain right you you're the one that I'm choosing to be light in the darkness he could have chose somebody else but he chose you Oh God is good why I tell I will tell you why I'm a holy ruler yes sir I've see the sign coming up look at him looking at him there when they when they was going to church moving on joy I saw through God put a binocular in his eyes one day and he looked down through that stream out of time yonder and he's seen the church he's seen this vine torn down destroyed I said what the Palmer one left the caterpillar eaten what the caterpillar left the locust eaten what the locust eat left another worm eaten he said could this church could this church never grow again but God said I will restore saith the Lord Joel that prophet looking down through the eyes of faith he saw this vine come up out of Genesis he saw I saw it all this far then I thereafter Jerusalem the Holy Ghost that fell he's seen the dark ages coming home he's seen that vine destroyed and pushed down to a stump but God said I will restore saith the Lord oh my if it wasn't for that you might be able to kill the branches but the life is in the church which is Jesus Christ the lamb slain from the foundation of that that's spoken for God will restore the last for the earth he would get somebody who's going to believe him amen I feel like a Holy Roller look notice I will restore saith the Lord so that I was going not long ago down up here in Canada brother a soon and I were going in Canada brother Baxter we were going way up in the North Woods one night I was just I was riding along there on my horse there was a big old thicket of pines I just love the outdoors I love to see God that was my first Bible God in his nature and I looked at my past by an Old Forest where it used to be great towering Pines but a burnover had come come come years ago and burned it all down and it was just a big butt look spooky great big old white trees the moon shining down against him and them just parts right and there come a wind blowing down through the mountains and all them trees was making them the most mournful sound whoo whoo and I thought oh my spooky place then the scripture come on mind what the Palmer one left the caterpillar eaten what the caterpillar left the locust eaten but what that was his church I thought truly Lord after the Reformation back yonder what the Catholics left the fundamentals eaten what the fundamentals left the Presbyterian eaten what the Presbyterians left the Baptist's eaten what the Baptists left the Nazarenes eaten until they eat the thing down but I will restore sayeth the Lord hallelujah God's going to have a church I will restore said the Lord I stuck there wonder and hear God's sending that wind down and all them big old trees was doing going woo I thought that that's just exactly like that Russian might have wind that come from heaven on the day of Pentecost when it strikes them big old churches then big old coal churches today like around Chicago the only thing they can hear is morning crime say the days of miracles is past from the mental there trees yes sir yes sir they was once a tree the Methodists the Baptist Presbyterian the Moody and all the rest they got great big towering spires but they say the days of miracles is past because the Palmer one has eaten all the blessings out of the church - there's no more hallelujah there's no more praises to God hallelujah there's no more divine healing speak with tongues they've carried it away tongues dead now let me just inject something there you know this week I received a telephone call and the brother from Virginia come say hey I got a got an uncle that's in the hospital he's 86 years old and you know he's got cancer in his body and now he's got gout and they went to the hospital and he just can't go home they won't let him go home you know with with his condition and he's trying to get out of the hospital he wants to go back home and you know the man 86 years old just drove itself all the way to Virginia and back and also he drives over here from Okeechobee you know a couple at least once a month he drives so just man doing very well you know we were talking to him me and brother Quentin went by to see him and you know so at when they told me 86 years old I said well let me um I'm gonna try to build his faith I first began to talk to him about his church life and and you see I said how you grow up in church holiness tell them my eyes mama didn't believe in makeup in his mama didn't wear earrings as mama I said well we got people that still believe the same thing now you know so we got to talking real good and and and I had a prayer cloth in my in my wallet so I say I'm a reader script over and I'm a pray and say he's holding this so he know by praying praying for the sick so I took the prick off this and I sir we got we're gonna pray for you we don't believe God that you know we believe God that cancer can back up 86 years old I shared with him the testimony of a congressman Upshaw I say I got lifted him up at 86 God can do the same thing for you I say he said we're gonna pray that this gout will leave we're gonna pray that this cancer will leave we're gonna pray that God will heal your body he said okay when we start praying he was shaking up something in that man you know and I say praise the Lord he feel the Spirit of God on the right so he you know he prayed and and and I think that was on a Tuesday we prayed by Friday he hadn't he was up on his feet walking to the bathroom by himself without needing the doctor's help and they say because you can walk on your own you can go home and now so I mean I tell you you know what we're seeing is God is still answered in prayer God is still moving amen in the supernatural now if God were actually delivering it from Gao God can deliver him from cancer I'm under I'm on the expectation I'm under expectation hallelujah now we didn't go empty out the hospital but if we get a call we got somebody we can go to we're gonna go that's what we do I didn't go push no track of nobody pray and let's expect God to do something hallelujah Oh glory to God let me let me keep going since I stood looked there come the wind again and instead of bending to it they go woo I thought that's about like it when God sends a revival and this city they say don't you believe such stuff days of miracles it's past there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost dr. so-and-so say well my well then I was discourtesy Lord you said I will restore and about that time the wind dropped the little Lord this what we looking forgotten to do this it says and when it did I noticed there was some undergrowth coming up that's fourth-generation there was some undergrowth coming up hallelujah glory some more little trees they wasn't as starchy and burn up with denominationalism a man they were in their evangelical they were interdenominational like Israel was God said you'll never be a nation or more and she won't be they were interdenominational and when when the winds began to blow and these little trees begin that wind began to hit them little trees begin to frolic and jump and dance and carry on I thought hallelujah I'll restores that the same power the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost if them old mournful churches one or more to say well I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist more known there's an undergrowth coming up hallelujah the life left the tree but it's coming up again every time the wind blows them little trees just take down and get a better hole that's right I will restore self the Lord God is raising up that first rains don't past the blister stuff the power went out of the church but God in this last days is sending the latter rain win now Halloween that's right the power of the Holy Ghost coming back I'm speaking it by faith a man as sure as he says the winds and the rains there's a tree standing there to rejoice oh I wonder who's that tree here today as sure as it stands the waves and the race there will be a tree standing there too a choice how happy there was there little trees just depending with the winds so that wind said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today better little tree say hallelujah hallelujah I believe it hallelujah hallelujah leave it the other tree said in a sense it was from the Miller they were just as much tree as what this little fella was but brother they couldn't bend to the spirit this is where I want to end into end tonight or today that's what the trouble these great big churches can't bend to the spirit because they're so organized it would break up their organization that's right look at this a strong wind in Israel is coming up can you know I want to speak that by faith strong wind and Spirit of Truth Tabernacle is coming up call back wash and holy rollers now I'm gonna tell you something after this happened people don't look at you a little different at school amen and they should see something different but God want to use you as a testimony of light in the midst of darkness it says call back wash and holy rollers hallelujah justice flexible as it can be that's right got life in them the Nutri was alive the old tree was dead that's the reason they can't be in because it's bad dead but there's a new birth coming on the latter rain being poured out in these last days power signs and wonders and the same joy than old trees joint long time ago has come back in a new generation I like that amen I will restore sayeth the Lord there it is Church I'm happy I told you we have to plow we gotta so DC's because this is what I'm under expectation for and if I could just get everybody Amen in this church and one mind and then one accord Amen let's start asking the Lord for rain in the time of the latter rain so Lord should make bright clouds and give us showers of rain to everyone grass in the field everybody gonna benefit from this everybody if everybody

when when people settle things they have very good intentions I know as soon as they they leave service the devil is right there to try to do something to pull them right back to where they was and no doubt some might have fallen Lord even since last Sunday but oh god that's why we come asking for some moisture that's why we come asking for some rain God because we know a man in our own willpower
