received year-to-date towards that pledge as well as towards our goal is eleven thousand five hundred thirty-five dollars and thirteen cents and and I thank God for that since the Lord has blessed us to put a little money away for this money is for our building fund we believe in God for a church and the school and then that's why I faith is on the line and in all honesty and I mean I'm just being honest we've already seen the property that we have believed in God for and we are first in line on the property what the last conversation I had with them insane you know everything looked good just

five hundred thirty-five thousand thirteen cent that came in towards the pledge and then you know we're taking that money and putting it in an account where we can hurt some interest and we're not gained one hundred and forty five dollars or fifty six cent and interests a man on the money that we got so it raised our total they meant eleven thousand six hundred eighty dollars and I think is 89

bit of spiritual jealous I don't know why I wasn't with him I saw sister Brown and I I said lord have mercy hi this happen I should have been right that Widow I should have took my money I'm leaving y'all all right I see I want to see you but it didn't happen but I'm gonna try to make show I'm gonna get on some of these trips and even if I preach to do never just go and get out of get out of American soil it's been a long time since I've been to Europe anything I said god it's this is terrible but it's good to see everybody this morning all of my friends and loved ones it's good to be here y'all just continue pray for let's start at the first verse now y'all pray for me I hope I do not keep y'all alone but I can guarantee it I preached two hours to services last week so I hope y'all got y'all good and rested if not I'll scream at you a little bit let's start at the first verse it says wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at Athens alone and sent timotheus our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by their afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereon too for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it it came to pass and you know for this cause when I could no longer forbear I said to know your faithless by some means the tempter have tempted you and I labor being vain but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always designed quickly to see us as we also to see you I think that's the way it should being in the body of Christ we long to fellowship one with another it's that right if you don't have that kind of spirit something's wrong it shows it's not the nature of Jesus Christ so therefore brother we were comforted over you and all our afflictions and distress by your faith for now we live if you stand fast in the Lord for what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy will with we joy for your sakes be before our God night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face in might perfect that which is lacking in your faith now God himself and our Father and Lord Jesus Christ direct I went unto you and and the Lord make you to increase in abound and loved one towards another and towards all men even as we do towards you to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all of his saints you may be seated this morning may the Lord had a blessed to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I like to use as a little topic this morning standing under the season of affliction being able to stand I want to just maybe take my time this morning and maybe bill one of the things we find here it was it was it was a difficult time for the Apostle Paul and I want to say this as I get started and I I've been just kind of working through different books of the Bible for the last year and a half or so trying to help the saints of God understand Scripture and understand that we're not just necessarily dealing with history I don't necessarily preach history historical gospel because I believe that the Bible is still alive one of the things I realized that you know the enemy is not dead they've read the same spirits that fought the early churches the same spirits that's fighting us as the Church of the Living God today is that right how many realized that we had a battle we're not we're not on a picnic this we got to keep certain things in mind this is a contest this is a contest brother branham preach the message contest this is a contest and and the enemy has an objective always always has been to steal killed and destroyed one of the things he has desired to be worshipped and and the prophet makes the statement I can't remember what what message it is he says he has actually accomplished his feet because we don't realize this and it's hard this is real difficult statement I'm amazed but people don't realize he's more worship right now this morning than God that's that's a very deep statement and and it take you being spiritual and really understanding your Bible right because because folk is going into Church and we we hallelujah and we shout and all that do not mean that you're a worshipping God right you you because you know Jesus when Jesus came on the scene he told the church now church folk he says in vain do you worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of man see and see one of these days if we don't already we gonna we're gonna get a clearer picture and understand why we needed a mouthpiece in this hour the corners back to the Bible right so that we could actually amen be worshipers of God right see we go all the way back amen to Genesis we found Cain right Cain was a worshipper he wasn't Fidel he will be worshipped but he worship according to his own dictates and God rejected it right I'm starting to feel something see he was worshiping he was a worshipper the prophecy he wasn't an infidel he built an altar Jeff's like Abel right and brought a sacrifice and God said no that ain't it right that's it but he said you know what God God is an opportunity she said you'd do well if you do like your brother that was real powerful yeah see he was trying to worship according to his own dictates he had his own approaches own you know way of thinking about things and God reject God said no sir that's not in his blood see because of God had her had accepted that it had to be man's dictates all the way down through the Bible come on any anything that we present to God he would have had to accept it right if he would have accepted Amen I'm gonna go somewhere this morning but I'm just trying to get out of the way but God rejected that to show us if we go to worship God we got a worship God Amen according to his word right and anytime you start getting outside of his word you started yeah when we start forming things and adding things we start pushing God out right right see and and you'll feel something you'll feel an anointing and that's the thing that's deceiving right right people will be anointed they'll feel something then they'll cry that shout know all of that but the teachers will be - false teachers of the word of God I'll leave that for brother Jack no more imma imma go ahead and try to go a different direction this morning that's the truth of northern ones at the end time right Amen and see let me leave this alone cuz I won't get the well but the thing that the thing that we find this morning is is that the Apostle Paul he was he initially dealing with the the Thessalonians in and you know I did a little history on it so that we could get a real understanding of what's the writing all about right well what's happening and why why is Paul writing to the Thessalonians and what's the background of it so that we could really preach the Bible to folk right priests preach the message y'all still with me y'all look wide right one of the things that we find you know i'ma try to cram a couple of chapters and before we get to the third chapter what we find is is that the Apostle Paul now you go back and do your history on and just don't take my word for it the Apostle Paul he spent a very short period of time dealing with the Thessalonians initially he had him how according to history about maybe three weeks of preaching Christ to the people right and and was kind of run out of town y'all know Paul had a very very hard time and trying to work with the people but what was most gratifying for the Apostle Paul was was that they were predestinated see that was their right see one of the things I learned you you don't have to fight with folk when it comes down to the message right right you really don't see if people if people are predestinated they're gonna they're gonna grasp it they're gonna gravitate towards it right see there's a responder on the inside that's something inside a man to receive something there to be quickly because nyancy can't be quickened see a lot of times we as ministers a lot of times we spend a whole lot of time and and Rosalynn with foking trying to get people to believe it if there's nothing in you to believe you're not gonna believe right if it's learning you if you were not in the mind of God before the foundation of the world you will not believe now I'm gonna stop right here because you throw people right right but we gotta understand the other aspects of the scripture I everybody that don't believe the message I'm gonna make a strong statement don't mean everybody's going to hell say I don't want us to walk around we used to walk around like that they don't believe this message come on priests with me somebody they don't believe this message they ain't God they might not be in the city but that don't mean that they can't a man get eternal life they just gotta go to the white throne judgment they get it see it's it's this word that position it places you in the body yeah see wasn't one of the things that I appreciate about God sending us a prophet he educated us he gave us an understanding of what the Brethren down to history I was actually doing with their ministry right amen Paul Paul on the foundation right cuz it's about Redemption coming to believe that dealing with the New Testament church building amen I'm Bryce's body right Paul Paul the word post Paul you know the dispensation of the gospel was given to Paul is that right he said in one place he said he was given the mysteries that were were here before the foundation of the world see and what Paul brought the brother amen in his day he brought the people truth right no error right there perfect interpretation of the Word of God under Paul's ministry let's see I like this because it helps me to understand the statements that God service brought when he says you know I talked with Paul all right being a prophet being the mouthpiece in this generation realizes by elevating in the spirit that's why you got to get in the spiritual you cannot be Conaway come to church you gotta get in the spirit in the church age book to hearing no see if you don't get in the spirit you'll never comprehend anything they're getting minister ever says to you it'll be Connolly's just be like water rolling off a duck's back but if you can cut them but the Bible says you gonna understand it if you're predestinated of God this morning you've been predestinated to understand see those brethren in those Thessalonians they will predestinated my god right right three week sometime we're at some with 300 years with folks and they still don't get it three week of preaching cries and something quick yeah think of a predestination that's all I tell you I can't fully explain it but I believe it you have to you if you're here this morning you was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be here right no matter how often and we all fall short that's the body we all fall short you know sometimes we think we gonna get away in God said hey man I saw you before I'm glad God saw me when I was jacked up brother Jack alright that's the truth anyhow when I was running around the streets of Palm Beach County chasing the little white ghosts God saw me when I was acting the fool in New Jersey God saw me God my life was purposed by God goodbye before I ever even knew the term purpose in God right beginning God being a part of the will of God name written in the Lamb's Book of Life before before I knew all of that God you meet brother kid I didn't know what I'm talking about but can it kind of had some of them experiences like me right and to be able to sit here this morning and to be able to express God in the manner that a man we can express God that's just the grace of God to us this morning is that right a man say but you know as I preach this at home and I preached this last weekend what I was I was I was showing I was trying to show the church this is a contest and the things that you know Satan is strategic strategic in his attacks right a man you know it was not by chance that you know the Apostle Paul was being fault it wasn't my chance that you know brother Branham was constantly being fought every step of the way right right you know in the first of the second chapter of Thessalonians Paul was happened to defend his character before the church and that's unfortunate but it wasn't necessarily to the church it was outside influences trying to bring in and so the seed of discrepancy right in the church to bring to bring separation right they they will make a statement st. Paul was trying to you know you know his his motors wasn't right his objective wasn't right and a man please empower Paul with a character assassination and how many times have we seen that in church where the Shepherd's have got to defend their character Paul told him in so many words he said look man I was a monkey how allow me y'all know me I didn't ask for money we worked we work the monkey he totally said something man God had given us the Word of God in truth he says my life was above board alright y'all gonna have to go back and read the Bible I'm just gonna kind of move [Music] he knew you could not handle the fire-god unless you have a clean life you know if you got a Scofield Bobby you look in the head and Paul it talks about Paul being a model servant Yeah right hey that's an example right how could Paul be an example to the church and have a jacked up life see that would one of the sons of guila see they stood in the gate and cheating and robbed see that one didn't mention the Spirit of God see Paul was displaying powers of living example God right Rossi he knew that he couldn't hand in a fire god robbing and cheating and stealing and things of that nature see even though workman is worthy of his hire Paul said look we worked we worked come on see Amen I wasn't I wasn't here attacks to challenge right but yeah he had to defend his character before people because but it shows it was outside influence not see come on not see about come on I'm helping you to understand that solonian when we preach in history now so so you could see you could you could really see and identify because Christ is identified by his characteristics Satan is identified by his characteristics come on amen see no matter how much you say you're a Christian and you're this you're that your honor by your characteristics thank you all with me like I say I thank y'all with but I'm a priest to you anyway cuz we just like we was telling say so I'm here to help like brother Jack with Sam brother let's go need help you know we've tried to tell the let's go that for years I've never priced alighted nobody ever cuz you to proselytize you make a person to fold more child of Hell than anything that's the quote yeah and the scripture all right right right people call it has called me over the years better smart be later God be certain of God be led of God see if if I pulled you then I got I got a baby I gotta give you a position I gotta call you all the time right I don't have time for that see my merica I don't have time to baby and call you when you at church y'all right all the time Bobby says sometimes we gotta learn how to encourage ourselves in the law don't start preaching out the way sometimes you just got to encourage yourself you know David David David had nothing to do I ain't met him in the brother rules they come back and all the families a man was taken into captivity go right along with show family they were like what we ought to kill you David he was once been loved now that was ready to kill him because because a man the enemy had them come in a man and taken out the families out of the church and they like oh my god David you supposed to be the past you supposed to be the head how could this be David's look back and saying you know every what David wrote that for me and not again you just gotta learn how to see it because if you wait on people to encourage you sometime you'll be a man waiting along see I don't sit around and wait on people to call me cuz I learn people do not call you and when they call you they Madeline they seeking something to take out that a man is sprayed so amen no demand labor monk you the call you say praise the Lord brother smiley really praise a lot they won't information the spread they won't motor they want an ant most fuel on the brother smiley come on but it's the truth in half it's a lot of things that I don't like but I I'll come down on them criticize my family right from that what but see the enemy is strategic right Paul had the Word of Life come on Paul being the message to the Gentile Church right Peter was giving the word to the uncircumcised Paul was giving the word right come on see to the Gentiles he started out with the Jews they turned it down then God sent them to the Gentiles he had the message of the power right he was not preaching the law Yeah right amen see he came preaching grace he came preaching Jesus Christ right he came pretty preaching the kingdom message right to group of people who who had no concept no perspective cuz God we know under the on the Old Testament was dealing with the Jews right God in His sovereignty had me on his mind throughout seven changes God had me on his my own if he had y'all on his mind now y'all gonna speak me ourself this morning but God through some it took seven chart changes and knowing that open the other world will come and I will come to the opening of the world he did it for me I just wish sister Lulu see right now I felt that but I can't sing it like she felt used to sing it all right so she Lewis was the only person I know could sit at the back of the church and tear the whole front of the Church of the Lord she was wonderful name he did it for me Jesus did it for me see wait but notice notice Paul being the messenger right the apostle to the aides Paul was giving the Adept that even peeling them didn't even have right Peter Peter was like man POW deep in so many words right you have no description now I'm paraphrasing and that's not exactly but you got to be a Bible reader right Paul Paul Paul dealt with things in on a level that they was like my card huh but watch watch the enemy so that you I want to show us something this morning right because it's the devil his ambitious hasn't changed because y'all up in here shouting and having a good time I'm gonna tell you something the devil is after you true brother branham under the inspiration a word to the church right he said you know what the devil he don't heat it he don't like to see the church all in harmony and one one mind and one Accord but you could look in Genesis and see that right right he said nobody he'll he'll do something he'll sit somebody that they might sit there for a long time huh he said no matter what it is he said when things started and then don't take sides clean together stay with the Word of God you know what I made I made a statement last week and I don't even know y'all might have heard this quote if y'all having I'm a quoting brother Branham says that he's ordained to lead you through yo tell you something thats why from a strategic standpoint the enemy always fights the head yeah right yeah one of the key is a star cut why because if he could get fingers pointed at the shepherd right if he could get y'all gossiping and whispering about the pastor's child what the pastor's wife and daughter dissing any other he know he's gonna that's gonna be a distraction right it's gonna take change it should change our views but it'll change for reals right but but Satan doesn't realize it if I can take this Shepherd and get this shepherd either way I'm gonna destroy the Sheep come on come on that's why we need a shop cuz the nature of the sheep they can't lead themselves they're defenseless they need a shepherd right now let me say something here this can't be strong 90 Vangelis not a prophet even brother Bentham had a pastor people don't realize that brother no who was his best they Co passed it he said different ways right he told the people he said when I go out he said come here brother never here do you call it yeah why would he make a statement like that because he knew he'd break the Scriptures to preach a prophet only message follow just thou me none you break every scripture in the Bible you start doing that but you can't take Ephesians 4:30 out of the Bible I'll take the other phones the other four parts of the ministry see that's why we'll be talking this nonsense about push playing we don't need this then it's like oh come on praise the Lord well what we're gonna do with the rest of the Bible we might have a close the book come on see but the devil knew that if he could keep a man paul away from the Thessalonians the Thessalonians even though they had gravitated towards truth right and accepted accepted truth accept it what see in it I'm strike something right because you find people say well that's just the thoughts and the opinions and things of that nature of men see watch because we we got to have we got the house thing that we're looking at as an example to us amen as the bride of Jesus Christ these brethren that were predestinated says you know what we received this word this truth not as words of a manner go back and read it but as the words of God enos the words of a man honest the words of God don't see weak that's our model right the Thessalonians they said look man when when Paul brought them truth they they perceive that it wasn't just some random words of some man no this is God see and when we look at the message of the hour right Bible prophecy I heard brother better make a statement in the rapture a couple of weeks ago I listened to the wraps at work I got so excited I must listen to that one statement like five times right so cuz sometimes we got to understand what what we're talking about we people do a lot of talking but they don't know what they be talking about really I'll be honest with you am I in the message and all of this kind of stuff you got to know what you're talking about all I hope I don't throw y'all but if I do then make you prayer study more right say you hear and you can go back and read this in the rapture message I can't quote you the page whatever I was listening to it he says he says you hear man talk about a message of the hour he says what are they getting it he said they're getting that is scriptural Bible truth for the day that's what that's what the message of the hour is come on about you you can pull it up later right that's what it is what are you talking about explain that to me it's almost on on the lines of when we was coming up I'd never forget this I'd never forget it me sister Burrell and my wife we mrs. Jean Wendy when you're talking back then we used to work together and we used to go to those conventions and brother Jack knowing talk about sister Erica all of us back in the day man we go and we shout and have a big time and come back and and nobody knew nothing nothing when I say nothing we didn't know anything y'all going to tell my sister and sister Dixon sister Brown almost all old Thomas I remember I remember we just come back from the meeting and but we had a good time we were crying and we was weeping and all of that and and I was on a break and sister sister bird I guess she was on a break but I was standing out in the front of the building I was maintenance guy and she simply you know and I ain't been in here a lot as long as they had been and she came up to me and she said up that's why I won't ask you a question she said what is the seven thunders I paused for a minute I took her deep breath like Oh Lord Lord now if she don't know and she'd been here longer than me and all I could do at that time is going what I've heard Christ cries yeah it is Christ don't say it's the voice of God but you see we screamed and we hollered and we jumped and we shot and we ran around the building we knew nothing we don't know nothin that's the truth in it huh yeah glory to a wonderful name we had something but it's just like Benjamin Franklin I got it what you got see somebody else had to come on the scene and fully express what he had bring to manifestation a man what he had but he didn't have something right we do have something and we thank God that we got ministers that can break into it and show us what we see I'm stumbling in the slaughter right I ain't trembling right I don't know what we got see a man brother brother brother some ministry helped me to identify spirits helped me to see the world a man not in the historical cuz he said he preached the message raising them up out of history weaning history the devil is the devil today he's real see what I'm trying to show us something Paul Paul wanted to see Paul wanted to make sure that with everything that he was putting in man it wasn't in vain right I wrote a love footnote right in my tablet you know - you spent all our efforts you you till the ground you prepare the ground you you you you get the seed in your place water and don't get at harvest nothing comes forth did you imagine being a farmer you've suite countless dollars countless effort right right come on and then in the harvest time nothing comes for that I could imagine that being a depressed farmer but I see one thing I'm grateful to God there's gonna be a harvest oh yes that's gold see let me tell you something I don't know if we comprehend comprehend this very well right we we are the success of the ministry of the son of man very existence this morning listening to somebody like me uneducated it's a very a man indication of the success of the success of the ministry or read us something right quick and this is from a commentary and I'm a Regis a statement from Spurgeon's but it fits all right it fits so well in the in the scheme of the Word of God and that I be honest with y'all I'll tell people I don't just you know sometimes I read things as commentaries because I study I don't just read everything from the message I know that's against some people thinking well if you think back that that's on you if this offend you then you just gonna have to be offended but I'm gonna read this but you'll see just brother brother Brandon brought us a brother bearing him brought us a teen even when he was preaching the seals and the church ages and stuff he said I wanna see latech he could preach to unseal months and months right well I'm not gonna bring you know false doctrine or not like okay I'm here to be a blessing he says he's just talking about the scripture say you welcome with the statement that I just made about the church he says you welcomed it not as the words of men but as it is in truth right the Word of God it is this is even this is the Word of God or the word of a man now it's up to you to determine I can't do it for you right right the Thessalonians received the Word of God as it is in truth Paul presented it not as the words of men and the Thessalonians received it as the words of God now how do we receive it how do we receive a man not just brother branham right because we're the final voice to the final eight right with our messenger we're not a final voice so when brother Jack is preaching brother quick Cohen in the different Minister company I wake up I was outside yeah I would be Whitney come on how would you receive it how do you receive it oh that's brother Jack all right somebody somebody told him why shock them last week see cuz you find that people really don't know the Bible I'm not being critical but I'm just being honest yeah right you know that's times where Paul wrote well Paul it was no great discernment people wrote the poll and told him about the problems so it's like it's not a bad I ain't no snitch so you just rather the devil take over the church then no snitch they say this ain't no this ain't Connell this spiritual see a man you gonna be hell responsible for the spirit of true tabernacle if y'all sit round time and I know sleds and knowing that folk doing all kind of stuff up in the childhood go back to the Hebrews series yeah see what brother Jack is you know in the household they wrote says it's problems right the household of Chloe right power power when he wrote back he said you know I partly believe that I just believe it's craziness going on Corinthians immature and everything else right Paul II have no deep discernment no it's a lot going on up in hill [Applause] come on we sit around let people talk about your pastors and all that okay guys you got them each of these guys gonna get you after a while come on priest with me somebody ain't come to preach so now I'm gonna leave that alone it's true we let so much go on and we won amen then don't sing right no see this thing is got to be pure it's got to stay pure you get right down to the end of the Bible into this chapter with Paul and I'm gonna be going in a minute well Paul talked about wanting to come because he knew that they still needed growth they still needed growth see and this is the reason why say don't want to keep Paul out of the mist this is why you know the enemy keeps everything going on in the church to keep us free growing see but see they receded as the Word of God he says not but I want to get to this place and I then we - out of here he said not everyone receives this message as the Word of God right yet when they do not receive it it reflects upon them not a punt the lesson brother branham didn't even make that statement that's from spurge that was fit to be read with when I read that brother Jack I said Oh something y'all know I'm heavy I don't need to be standing on it and I need to be on subsonic glory to God see not everyone see it reflects upon them not the message he said means free we ought to be set free because because people don't does nothing against the message because we had a few fruit of the message right he says that ye have not perceived spiritual things is true let me back up so I make it sound good not everyone that receives this message as the Word of God yet when they do not receive it it reflects upon them not upon the message that he have not perceived spiritual things is true but is no proof that there are none to proceed it's saying okay there's people that don't perceive but there are people that proceed get on the internet and we spent countless dollars trying to disprove it you can't it's fruitless because that's for as many people is walk away and criticized there's just that many more people that double-double [Applause] many people that comes in and folk just be making room for other folk it's no proof you can't disprove this ain't right because there's too many people that understands that proceeds right he said the whole case is like this of an Irishman who tried to upset evidence by non evidence he says four witnesses saw him commit a murder he played it he played it that he was not guilty and wished to establish his innocence by producing 40 persons who did not see him do it that don't even make sense he wanna upset evidence and look how many people that be trying to obsess what's already been vindicated by God and prove it oh hey man he says still see him doing he said I what use would that have been what this kids good he says so if 40 people declare that there is no power of the Holy Ghost going with the Word of God this only proves that the 40 people do not know what the other people know that means folk don't know what you know [Applause] what you know people about what I know [Music] and it's ain't God they reveal this to me gotta reveal it to you because you don't know it don't be wrong it just me you just can't proceed can't proceed let me prove you this he made a statement here why did it is it because listen if there's nothing in you to quicken I can explain to you things all day long are you not gonna get it none of us know it all but God reveals things in season when the season comes that you need to know something that you need to understand something blood brother Coleman back in the day did know that he was prophesied to me he used to make that statement I used to look at him but I don't understand I can't say that today see I understand what the seven thunders it's not afraid of that no I don't get on top of that because you know seven thunders give faithful all of that understand now see I'm not afraid of it glory to God see they will make your statements but I understand in this hour right I understand what those things meant or me see so I'm saying something this morning don't worry about folk that cannot perceive just look around you know that's the people up in here they're perceived because I knew that there were people up in spiritual tabernacle that perceived that this is not the words of my man this is the words of God see so - spend all my time explain to me this explain to me ask me this question and this time for that my time is valuable you ain't finna waste it even the way slapped oh so full I said if I could explain to you is this gonna change your views if it's not gonna change them from let's stop this nonsense now because my time is valuable I ain't gonna let you take it up and waste it I'll rather be somewhere eating me some oxtails us up then to be sitting up in here messing with you come on round four round and you just you got question after question after question after question that's that don't mean nothing tell you I'd rather be somewhere window shopping a shopping or anything I'm just gonna be honest which then all you would focus Eve open to go watch the Apostle Paul all right you know that's a reaction to an action and Paul Paul realizes that he couldn't get get in slices you know what I'm a sin Timothy glory to God so think about if we didn't have a fire phone ministry if it was a message of only type ministry he couldn't get in who would have got in right he said you know what I don't know how to defeat this devil right now I'm I can't but that's somebody who believe what I believe I'm I'm a sin that individual in for the purpose of amen establishing and comfort because you can't be a comfort comforted until you established right and once you established in the Word of God then you find comfort see you're not easily swayed you're not moved by the things that's that surround you see part the Apostle Paul told me so listen I tried to tell you that we're gonna be afflicted but Paul Paul was was concerned about the people because I'm just closing something preach you know ain't crayons I ain't gonna take out too long this morning right Paul was so concerned as as a servant of God just like brother Jack and these brothers that concern about about a man making sure that the people are anchored in the faith see one thing I'm convinced - always been 21 years of pastor I know if you could get people to sit still long enough the word not me as a man but the word amen do everything that the word salem doing the heart and life of the individual but you've got to get people to stand still right see if it was it was much it was much affliction see they were coming under under fire because of what they believed you feel like you will your world's turned upside down you know why because of what you believe it's true I thought life was bad well how's that that getting high and all that boy let me tell you something I'm gonna spit some stuff I haven't experienced some stuff I feel like Steve Harvey that's the favor let me taste something take something I've experienced some stuff in 20 30 years of being a Christian let me tell you somebody called a fanatic I've been called a crank I've been talked about I mean out right now I'm off the side don't nobody hardly want to preach me now oh they missing cuz I still in season for your ministry still standing I'm still steady see see Paul's concern was was that that in the season see seasons change faces change see that was just the present-day condition they were being affected and Paul was concerned so much he said oh I just wonder how to church doing I've had him brothers doing I can't see him at night like that I dropped down some Douglas and they gravitated towards him but not a mandate under the other precedent that will fight them and everything else amen it was just a season of affliction right it was just a season when they were being afflicted but God but God was standing back saying watch what watch them stand watch them stand they going through like Joe watch him you know the devil yeah i'ma say you know what he got in the church and he'd do all this and that you you blessing him your blessing him big name huh big name right the devil i reckon up my name Oh groaning God but I have a modern day job I understand what Joel man but doubled uncle jack told me that this morning [Applause] see I know I needed to be here this morning because it's the season of double-double you get double for your trouble come on somebody been going through now I see you know the Bible said weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the mountain I believe this is our morning our morning is coming my god Paul was so concerned cuz you know what people there's a lot of people crumble when it start getting hard right when it when it look like the church is gonna fall apart and people are jump people people go stand with you when it look like boy the ship going down copy then use a quote a man the captive got to be a menace on this well I'm getting on this not about look like demons demons look that posture Paul send me my one codon all it is man you look like you ain't even in no revival looks are deceiving cuz ya'll cuz fo be soundly right it don't mean it be no revival you can only be in the word revival not see the revelation of the word will produce a man the the excitement and the joy you cannot take the revelation of the word out right and just say well we booked it well we had church we arrival what a preacher say right simulation producer revelation revelation produced stimulation to me right right see the revelation of the word I get excited see with no news is no let see a man we've everybody quiet if something strike me I could hold it what was it what was that it might not admit nothing to you but it meant something to me see my man I personal a man because you know sometimes I got sit back and I hate to be a creature I'll tell my chance I hate you know sometimes I saw Sam so hard sometimes we go to the meetings and the minister and see it's the psychology - this - I know how to work y'all clean up I've been doing this a long time it's psychology these guys study this TD jakes all these big guys they study psychology they know how to move forward I know how to move for I knew how to move awful come on we've been searching folk all my life see you caught you going to denomination to church or something [Music] that could be sleep maybe like this is my time ripping to get up out of here they heard nothing handkerchiefs come out and everything they got no word if you don't eat man you go stop you know I get fair and full I could grin smile walk around to tell how fool I am huh but if you ain't eating you know they say but Paul I positive pressure see people crumble under pressure right when things start getting hard we stop serving God I'm reminded of a story the prophet of God told about a young man he was a Catholic boy he had a little prayer book had no real relation to God see that's why it's so important seat so yeah I can understand what brother Jack be doing he'd be trying to teach y'all and teaching it establishes it anchors you it gives you up it gives you an understanding right come on cuz cuz listen y'all realize y'all the target this morning all the guns is on you but it's the teasing on the Word of God that grounds you right that stabilize issue right when the winds of life come those roots just get up deeper hold see God be working on you gobby I heard hurt I heard brother whispers right pretty soon affliction ice and wild ah brother brother brother did sent me the clip hmm see what we don't want to go through see but you gotta go through is it's a father God you know the Bible said Jesus learned obedience through the things that he suffered he told the church he said man if I suffered in the flesh arm yourself likewise we start we start going through and suffering see the predestinated right they just get a hold on God they see through that you learn let me tell you something through my suffering you learn how to trust God more see see I'm gonna take it's a little saying my grandmother used to say that I used to couldn't comprehend but I do now I look to the heels some old time I know what I'm telling I look to the heels I didn't even know there was a scripture from Wis coming my help see I know what they start getting I believe when I feel the devil for which cometh mine like a little baby say from the Lord when I don't feel nothing when it don't seem like nothing is going on around me huh come on that's just a bird song don't stop let me tell you something these songs is still relevant when I don't feel nothing sometimes look let me tell you something your salvation ain't based upon what you feel this more huh don't mix it what I don't feel nothing I don't this I meant just shall live by revelation not motions and sensations and feelings and all your feelings are deceive you you could be just the same as you wanna be but you don't feel I don't feel saying what I've got to do with it you gotta know that you saved this morning see you gotta know that you going in the rapture this morning joining me is wonderful name Amen see ya you be standing this morning I wrote something down your stance speaks of of you being wheat your stand speaks of you being wheat see we know listen it speaks of you being a part of the harvest cuz only that wheat is going into Ghana this is see this is why we labor we preach to bring these understanding so that you can comprehend when when when you're under time of attack you realize you know what it's just a part of it thinking that strange this ain't strange Paul told us say look I tried to tell you see y'all Father is just me gonna go through something no y'all gonna go through some as the church for the word that you believe you're gonna go through some stuff right but you know what what was gratifying for Paul when Timothy came back and say boy let me tell you something I'm changed so then people ain't crumbling they designed the sea but they looking for they looking forward to another convention they looking for another conviction wider cuz when you came them few little weeks and you drop them nuggets off they was dating they stay still in revival they excited they looking forward to you coming back right Paul said well I can't wait to get back so I could impart right I could impart life right that I could I could anchor folk more in the faith let me tell you something we need more we need more kid container II go back I read that chapter when you go home we need more right we need more anchoring cuz we start to see so many things you know around the Word of God that may we once met all my god well you want to witness all 30 years ago come on dress is getting shorter no folks say you we don't need that we we don't need that noted preacher said we don't need that we just need blessings we just need we just need to tell the people you know that man that's empty God ain't gonna bless over mess come on G God has it order God has structure go back to the Old Testament you say we're under the law you better go back to the Old Testament and bring it over God don't God just don't bless us any kind of way he told her they say man when you go cuz see we in the land of promise is the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the day right he told him y'all cross over into that land of promise he said y'all gotta he said look listen it won't be no Berenice everybody be fruitful I'll get your houses I'll give you double double for your troubles I'll give you I'll give you a house and stuff here bill or do you videos grapes arguing stuff you any work for the enemy sold it and everything you'll reap huh but you got to do a certain thing you got a little right kind of life right if we in the land of promise the promises hasn't changed right God God still promised to bless us but we gotta live right see Church I'm gonna say something I'm gonna say something we just got to choose you this day who we gonna serve we gotta make a choice we gotta make decisions so you know what for God I live for God I die blessed be the name of the Lord right amen it's an individual thing I'm determined this morning well it's my children well it's my husband well it's my wife I'm going all the way just to see him the man who suffered and died for me if my friend don't go out and go away see we didn't got this thing all jacked up if well my husband don't go ain't goin it this don't go ain't know it look you so you mean to him if he jump off that bridge she jump off that bridge you jumping off behind them come on no no see it's an individual thing I'm going the glory for me not my children not my mama not my sisters not none of y'all I'm going to glory for brother smiley stay right I'm going for me cuz he did it for me you ain't nobody to go well they quit and brother smiley I feel bad don't don't misunderstand me I'm a human being why would I walk out down send him on man I see a church that I started pastoring with 90 some people down the nine but it's in the scripture though what in a million now I know some folk I know some folk I don't want a misunderstanding I know my mother log came amen and support her husband and different things and I know since I sister brown got over here and all that dang what I'm saying but it's a whole lot of folk should still be a church whole lot of young folk should still be in church right come on come on amen outside of certain ones my mother-in-law and different ones situations and I understood it I understood by her coming brother Roosevelt was able to come right I understood at those thing but there's a lot of things that I don't understand that you can't take it back to the world where's all these young people I'll tell you what it drop it in part in thinking that's all slick what are you gonna with me God look truven huh focal me God it's true hey man destructor she'll be fooled up with the with the pro-bending back slid and all right children churches should be fold up I drop something brother James but y'all gonna have to get this back for me this moment I tell you that's what I told him last week don't give me this hand he'll give me up to the pale Mike I could be a little more dignified give me this thing here I'll get crazy I feeling like I'm an evangelist and brother say what you want to a hand hell of pin oh no I don't give me a hand here I'll be standing on stuff I'd be going crazy what's the truth I told her I made a statement I told him I said listener taste something man church should be full up with family so burnin know what I'm talking about when I went the piece was I the church was built on families scripturally it was Israel the sons of Israel and their family all up in order up under the leaders amen the matriarch s-- and the patriarchs of those families not we got things broke all up and everybody I mean if you moved out of state or you know married out of state I understand that right but but when when you got folk families stat this one over here and that one over there and so what you said you're disrespected the revelation of the matriarch and the patriarch see when I look at my people a lot help us it's like see if we was up on the Old Testament time right there revelation could never supersede my revelation see don't those hands and those tribes came together everything followed up under those different banners see when the hundred and forty-four thousand come in that's what it's gonna be they might not know what better day upon the now but they will one day that's the prophet said that a lot of those that stuff will be been lost through the wars in history but I believe that if this is Bible truth if what we believe is on the word and not the words of a man right then our sons and our daughters should be a man following the matriarch and the patriarchs of other families come on y'all children should be and your grandchildren should be up in here it should be no room in this building this morning supposed to be open down I know y'all got a lot of folk chillin and grandchildren see you see how messed up we are it's the truth a man who talked to me I'd be like listen I'm the wrong person to talk to come liable to hurt your feelings there's God no intervene you kind of you cuz you can't come to me with stupid right all of this feelings and emotions I'm not the one for that especially not in this season right hey man all of brother Jack's brothers nieces everybody right sister that's the matriarch right Jack the pastor Vaughn his children cannot believe this his truth I believe brother Jack is preaching truth in the indication is mama Hill huh my children shouldn't be running all over the country I'm trying to show us up I'm trying to show people need to understand what's the order of God right come on if we spiritual Israel right if we spiritual Israel it shouldn't be broke up if we if we got families this like I say it families you know sometimes we got family members all over the place where we know that's hard that's difficult I'm to my immediate family you know in the area right and listen and this is truth this is work we should encourage them we should we should encourage them live such a life that it influenced her right I appreciate I appreciate seeing you know sister Browns sisters and a daughter and granddaughter and that's the way it's supposed to be that's the way it's supposed to be yeah right I mean noise sister Brown long time I've been knowing her sister's probably longer than I've been knowing her since seventh grade right and so so it's a blessing see it one little mistake right God God knew right hey man I'm gonna tell you our sister something y'all doing the right thing y'all doing the right thing you might not understand everything but I believe you're the right place at the right time I believe that and if we stay faithful you'll see God's blessings pour down upon you right cuz God brings the revelation of the Word of God amen watch sister Brown take a stand i watch sister Brown at our church I passed this is a brown for some years I watch sister Brown said no no don't sit there that's that's my husband's seat huh set a pocketbook there so nope nope no sit there that's my husband's seat huh folk brother limb that passed away he sat next to his wife we traveled together we laughed together right there we cut the clean food in Arizona y'all know brother Linda but if you couldn't laugh with brother Linda you just couldn't laugh huh hey man we we I mean his physical body was going down but he still had a sense of humor me hearing and brother might go on now I just gonna stop I allowed to be crying up here huh brother Jerry we walk in we all having a good time in the Lord why she took a stand she knew she had come in contact with something that was genuine huh a man it took a season she had to go through a season being talking about and everything that's because people could proceed huh but Dean car came on the scene did did mother Tillman mother Tillman came up and hit her fine fine hats and spoted huh come on why why because sister Browne Stewart in her season of affliction and then God had him vindicated he God that he'll give you double for your trouble and it ain't over it's just beginning it's just beginning you stand in this season when you feel like a man you know you going through God's got to come on this CD double-double glory to God you know God God wants us to be stable um I know I say I got to go but y'all use this to come on let me tell you something make a decision this morning that I'm determined no matter what where I am what position they don't matter where you were right no matter what your confession is this morning you make a decision that as much as I could come to church I'm coming to church and I'm gonna sit under this ministry and I'm going to support this ministry I have confidence in brother Jack dick that Jack Jack got a good heart I chased him you can't go find a better man than that he's been proven I've been man I've been a prisoner you know I'm chased up tell you the secret the devil trying to destroy us before we ever start preaching right well Jack had a couple days the devil flipped it with both of us in it he thought that he'd give us on a Friday we only we on our way to church playing the Prophet laughing having a good time talking about the Word of God before I left we never wore seat belts in Jack drove like a wild man back there tell you man I'm so scared like thanks for that thing brah slow it down that's why gotcha gotcha we really need a car y'all brother Jack you know I couldn't take it we on our way we never won't see bus this night they came to pick me up and I live them boring at a time sunset put your seatbelts on we ride I'm tell you something play take off obedience we'd be dead but God knew he has to work for us to do before we even did we neither one of us was preaching I've just been saying maybe three months or something like that and and we going down I finally decide put these sheep that song originally put your seatbelt off put a seatbelt on we going down he turn down the street that he never turned down that street that when we all night he picked me up from boy and we come to church that never turns the saw a cut short cut okay this is taller than 95 shortcut we ride we started talking and I see this car coming I'm like Jack you see it he like yeah see I got big mile get beat next thing you know Oh ride a steel comet y'all you know what a-coming is a little bit of cobbler they were made of steel when I'm old cause and Jack trying to turn out its way and it hit us and filters we slid it down the street man looky here when I cussed up we were upside down when he was saying my surviving yeah Oh coming out to Woodland like if you stay here actually we view I want to hope you do better here I don't watch you in the movies good night Jake Jake Jake welcome down fella get up please going dad walking over Dallas top silo praise God I wasn't saying nothing that was a shock like [Music] people thought we were crazy some people sat us down we went to the hospital you know the ironic thing he had this hand cut all up and I think I think that that has made us tight we know was tight back then it just gave us a bond my right hand because I was on the passenger side was cut up his left hand because he was driving was cut up that was that we walked out of there and ever since then ever since then even before Jack started preaching we've been tight they just get mad at Foley we got married got our people Foley's the fuss at us about everything and since he's had a church we've been supportive of each other's ministries and we work together good folk want us to come but that you're much behind it well we'll come will you come that's why the devil don't fault me so hard to break up the tandem right while other brothers still trying to figure stuff out brother - say come on preach funny but smiley and I come right over I still got I still got a few friends that know that I'll let me come in and yeah come on I'm not here to hurt anybody I'm here to be a blessing it's a fivefold ministry sometimes sometimes it takes other brothers coming in and since the same thing but maybe in a different way it's a really quick good something to us and that's that's what we're here for you know I'm happy to see people standing I realized this church has gone through a lot as just as well as if you're a church and you ain't going through something you might not be a church you might never get Church does not say it like that cuz of your church because it's the devil is not a person we're not dealing with flesh and blood we feeling with spirits see keep this in mind and y'all give me some salt give me something come on get that brother Jackie he gonna say just play play play something it's warfare it's spiritual warfare it's not natural right it's not something natural that you're dealing with if you keep that in mind no matter what you're going through is something spiritual since the enemy strategically trying to bring destruction in your home break the unity break the harmony break the fellowship break the oneness if you keep these principles in mind when you see that say oh it ain't gonna work it's not gonna work it's not let me tell you somebody brothers I know it's not gonna work if y'all let anybody talk about that brother over there that brother over there brother Troy these ministers shame shame shame on you right hey man any woman ever let somebody run that husband down shame amen I love you and I live my voice to work [Music] take joy Mikey yeah in what you hear let it be a sweet sweet time in your ear come watch let's

You Lord and I lift my voice hallelujah to [Music] oh my soul rejoice take joy my king [Music] in what you hear and let it be a sweet sweet sound [Music] just keep playing softly let's just give the Lord a hand praise [Applause] certainly appreciate rather smiley standing under the season of affliction and I think he'd be really good you go back home and and look at the scripture that he read to us today 1st Thessalonians 3 verse 1 through 13 very short chapter 13 verses but go back and read that and then think about some of the things that he spoke here today you'll see how the Lord was just just really piecing it all together I'm very very grateful for how God uses his ministry a man just just just just so much in there [Music] he was talking about Spurgeon and I had the opportunity when I went to to England this time we were randomly we just kind of found this place that we wanted to stay in at all for the Quentin research that found them found this place in weed you know just stayed there one night I was telling some brothers I want to go to a particular church that I wanted to see and on the way there to say hey Spurgeon churches over here I'm like Spurgeon Church and they said yes it's right here in this area where you went I'm saying take me this virgin Church and big old building they say it's Purdy used to preach then I think they said fifteen thousand people used to pass through this church on a Sunday morning and and if you if you if you don't if you've never heard him at Charles Spurgeon you'd go in you read some of the things I said that this man had a revelation of the word in his Dana he wasn't a message or anything like that but they live so close to scripture right some of the things that they wrote during that time you just read on today is like oh my if even if the modern denomination Church would try to quote Spurgeon it might not even be received [Music] that's I mean that's how close this man was to door the modern the denominational war and let me also put it this way because they use this term we non-denominational they still have you tried the cool spur to the near church they probably still will receive it because that's how close he was right to scripture walking in the truth that he had and that day brother Branham talked about him as well but but I just love that you know I didn't get the whole quote I think I just got a little piece of it a man it reflects upon them not the message so just because he rejected you know I reflect upon you not the message don't mean the message run right a man might mean that you're not rights we thank God for the word today praise the Lord let's give God a hand the phrase amen also quickly to brother Felix that put in a prayer request with some Jacob we got that on on Wednesday night I believe it was he was having surgery on Thursday at the Miami Children's Hospital and I got work back from him that Jacob came through the surgery just fine we're certainly appreciative of everybody's prayers for him and so just continue to keep them in prayer a man that he'll just recover just a way that he needs to we'll have a word of Prayer we'll close out today we'll be back tonight 5:30 for our community service the next service will be on Wednesday night so let's just pray father we thank you for your your word me thank you for this time that we've been able to come together and to worship worship God has been a real blessing to have rather smiley here and Lord just looking at how you use them just to bring the word how encouraging and strengthening edifying Lord settling to the people we realize afflictions will come but God you give us the strength to stand under the season of affliction that's all it is is a season seasons change so god help us Lord to realize that amen Satan will get his chance to kind of bring different trials different temptations different struggles but all God we expect to stand in the midst of it and as we stand in the midst like like joke did not we expect double for our trouble so what we we received that that Lord that's just been giving him great things you got so much more in store we received that as it was spoken here Amen over this pulpit today God I printed you blessed of equals they prepare to leave let them go to know the things that they've heard me they go back and reread the scripture and Lord just really receive again all that German stir brought forth to us today god bless brother smiley bless to the church there in Okeechobee we thank you for allowing brother Troy to go out this morning father just to share what he placed in his heart to the people we're grateful for what we see you're doing in the midst of your people God this is nobody but you Jesus so father we give you praise honor and glory keep us now as we leave this place but not your presence bring us back at the appointed time tonight for our time of chameleons and feet wash them Lord me this here Lord is our prayer God we just accident you've taken complete control of all things if there's anything Lord that states and father might try to do amongst us Lord we just pray that you would give us wisdom in Direction father and lord help us just to maintain victory a man in the midst of this church thank you for every heart that has come out here I know there's some saints traveling back today God give them traveling mercies let them arrived here safely God is our prayers and Jesus name we ask him amen amen let's give the Lord another hand of praise hallelujah god bless you can be seated the brothers will come to dismiss you a man at this time [Music]
