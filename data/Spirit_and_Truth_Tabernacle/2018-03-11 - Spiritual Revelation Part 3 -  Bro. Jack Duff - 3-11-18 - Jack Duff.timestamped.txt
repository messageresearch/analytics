[52:40] same step were able to go with us on
[52:43] Friday night amen to my cousin's church
[52:48] and just helping them out the pastor of
[52:52] that church
[52:53] it was his sermon and that brought
[52:57] conviction to the mother's heart and and
[53:01] you know she got saved underneath you
[53:04] know his ministry and that turned our
[53:06] new house rule around right when lovable
[53:10] mama got saved it turned our whole house
[53:12] around
[53:14] yeah I'm saved because mama got saved
[53:17] you know but my brother has like been
[53:20] changed because what happened to mama
[53:22] all of the kids were impacted by what
[53:25] happened to mama right and we're very
[53:28] grateful you know for that and you know
[53:31] and and you know sometimes you know when
[53:34] I when I just look at it I look at what
[53:38] we have here you know with this word
[53:40] there's some people that have never
[53:42] really come to everything that we got
[53:43] right but you know they've walked and
[53:47] everything that they do and God used him
[53:50] a manifold for that day a specific
[53:53] purpose so you know that that that
[53:55] pastor was certainly grateful because
[53:57] I've not he'd done what God told him to
[53:59] do then we wouldn't be where we act come
[54:04] on folks are sometimes we you know we
[54:09] we have to remember where we come from
[54:13] you went here always you didn't have
[54:17] this truth always right so somebody had
[54:20] to say something to you at some point in
[54:22] time but then it started after you
[54:24] accepted Christ right and that that
[54:27] gentleman his ministry was very
[54:29] effective
[54:30] a man to listen you know I mean there's
[54:33] there's many there's a man that he rides
[54:36] around the city here's an old pastor the
[54:38] rides around on his bicycle I see him
[54:40] it wants to mom and and when I see him
[54:43] on his bike I just stopped and I stopped
[54:45] praying for me so because that man years
[54:49] ago had a church and inside his church
[54:52] he was playing a movie called the
[54:55] burning hell and I went to see that
[54:57] movie as a young man and and when I saw
[55:00] in the movie how they depicted how
[55:02] people would be inhale I said I don't
[55:04] want to go right I don't want to go on
[55:06] that night in that church I gave my
[55:07] heart to the Lord at least I thought I
[55:09] did
[55:10] there is something that got me you know
[55:13] turning in the right direction the
[55:15] reason I said I thought I did because I
[55:16] I repent it but I went right back into
[55:19] it some of the same things I was doing
[55:20] before but it got my heart thinking that
[55:23] I
[55:24] right and because that man played that
[55:27] video of that night it impacted my life
[55:30] so I have to stop sometime and just
[55:32] begin to you know just just thank the
[55:34] Lord for different people that have
[55:36] crossed our paths that have made a
[55:38] difference in us that that put us on the
[55:41] right track you know it make that God
[55:43] sometimes can use somebody in the
[55:45] message that sometimes God can use
[55:47] somebody outside the message but his
[55:50] message to you
[55:52] hey man and that is that he loves you no
[55:54] matter what
[55:55] a man so we thank you for for going and
[55:58] just kind of supporting and and a man

[58:20] balls but I said now I could have been
[58:22] that we're just walking and talking and
[58:24] fellowship and then it hit me it hit me

[59:33] with something but man you ain't the
[59:35] same age as them your body don't respond

[59:40] little little something happen later
[59:42] anchor they back up the next day not you
[59:44] you gonna be down for a couple of days
[59:46] but I God is good anyway you know we're
[59:49] certainly certainly grateful a man but
[59:52] we've been we've been journeying men
[59:55] through this little thought on spiritual
[59:57] revelation and and I was trying to move
[1:00:00] on or something else but the Lord just
[1:00:02] kind of brought some things right back
[1:00:04] around to me last week I had no idea
[1:00:08] there was I had mentioned something in
[1:00:11] the sermon but I didn't go too far into
[1:00:13] it I'll go a little further today in it
[1:00:15] but I've mentioned something in the
[1:00:18] sermon and and then brother Troy had
[1:00:20] said you know what on this day brother
[1:00:23] branham Creek it was the fourth you know
[1:00:25] of March brother Brandon preached a
[1:00:27] particular sermon on the 4th of March
[1:00:29] making a way and he said he was talking
[1:00:32] about what you were talking about in
[1:00:34] church today SL phrase the life so
[1:00:36] that's a confirmation and and when I
[1:00:39] looked back at my notes guess what I had
[1:00:41] the quote in here that I did not read to
[1:00:43] y'all from Macon away all right and and
[1:00:47] then you know something like man that's
[1:00:49] that that was that was something there
[1:00:51] and then I was talking a little bit
[1:00:53] before Solomon and and he pulled ice I
[1:00:56] got a question about a quote and he
[1:00:59] pulled up on this
[1:00:59] you know they pulled out a quarter say
[1:01:01] brother I had that quote in my notes but
[1:01:03] I did not read it I didn't read it it
[1:01:06] was in my notes but I didn't read it I
[1:01:08] said well I said as another confirmation
[1:01:10] I say I'll keep going right and we'll
[1:01:14] just let the Holy Ghost have his way you
[1:01:16] know in this but if you don't my
[1:01:20] understanding and we'll read the
[1:01:21] scripture you all should be very for me
[1:01:24] with it a man out of Matthew chapter 16
[1:01:28] and verse 13 and then we will we will go
[1:01:34] on from there praise the Lord
[1:01:37] Matthew 16 and verse 13 it says when
[1:01:43] Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea
[1:01:46] Philippi the exodus disciples saying who
[1:01:50] do men say that I the Son of Man em they
[1:01:54] said some say that thou art John the
[1:01:56] Baptist some elijah others Jeremiah or
[1:02:01] one of the prophets now I want y'all to
[1:02:03] just really get that how would they even
[1:02:05] say John the Baptist they knew of what
[1:02:10] who would be saying something like this
[1:02:12] right because they knew John the Baptist
[1:02:15] and Jesus was two different people right
[1:02:18] but there was word around I believe
[1:02:21] where one thought that John the Baptist
[1:02:23] might have been might have come back to
[1:02:25] life in Christ right and so they would
[1:02:28] they come up with all kind of crazy
[1:02:29] things you know some say thou art John
[1:02:33] the Baptist some say some elijah others
[1:02:36] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[1:02:39] he said that but whom say ye that I am
[1:02:44] and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[1:02:46] art the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:02:48] and jesus answered and said unto him the
[1:02:51] last art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:02:54] and blood have not revealed it unto thee
[1:02:56] but my father which is in heaven and i
[1:02:58] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:03:01] and upon this rock I will build my
[1:03:03] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:03:04] prevail against it and I were given to
[1:03:07] me the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[1:03:10] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:03:12] shall be bound in heaven
[1:03:13] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:03:15] shall be loosed in heaven then charge
[1:03:19] these disciples that they should tell no
[1:03:20] man that he was Jesus to Christ amen
[1:03:23] let's pray father we thank you for your
[1:03:26] word and God as we've just endeavor to
[1:03:30] go a little further with this felt today
[1:03:34] help us God about to receive revelation
[1:03:36] it's the only thing that's going to be
[1:03:39] able to overcome the enemy the gates of
[1:03:41] Hell will not prevail against Revelation
[1:03:44] so help us work to receive it and your
[1:03:46] prophet told us if revelations be honest
[1:03:48] and they look up and ask you for so God
[1:03:51] we ask that you administer to every
[1:03:53] heart to every need that you would just
[1:03:55] get all the glory and all the honor and
[1:03:56] all the praise a man from this portion
[1:03:59] of service thank you for everything that
[1:04:00] you have done this farm in our midst and
[1:04:03] God we would take control of every
[1:04:06] spirit that's against your spirit we
[1:04:08] know Satan's that work but God we know
[1:04:10] you're also at work so we help us to tap
[1:04:13] into what you're doing in this ours in
[1:04:15] Jesus name we pray amen amen praise well
[1:04:19] you can be seated a man so we will
[1:04:23] continue down this journey a man of
[1:04:26] spiritual revelation now I stopped there
[1:04:29] at verse 20 amen and Matthew 16 but I
[1:04:35] made this comment and I wanted to show
[1:04:37] you I'm going to go forward and verse 21
[1:04:38] just a couple more verses from that time
[1:04:43] forth began Jesus is showing to his
[1:04:45] disciples how that he must go unto
[1:04:47] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[1:04:50] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[1:04:53] be killed and be raised again the third
[1:04:56] day now notice he gives them this great
[1:05:00] experience you know I mean this here
[1:05:04] he's asking for a personal revelation as
[1:05:08] to who he is you know from them now if I
[1:05:13] understand this correctly and I could be
[1:05:16] correct
[1:05:17] I could stand correction but for for
[1:05:20] Peter to actually state that thou art
[1:05:25] the Christ the
[1:05:26] Son of the Living God amen
[1:05:30] he was stating something a lot more than
[1:05:33] what we're thinking a man that he's
[1:05:35] stating remember brother Branham told us
[1:05:39] he had an experience with you know a
[1:05:41] rabbi and now he asked the rabbi a
[1:05:44] question is they now what relation will
[1:05:47] Messiah be to God right revelation will
[1:05:53] Messiah be to God now I say the extra
[1:05:56] rabbi because a rabbi being Jewish they
[1:06:00] they see things a little different from
[1:06:03] with Gentiles so so the question to this
[1:06:06] Jewish rabbi is regulation will Messiah
[1:06:10] be to God and the rabbi responsible
[1:06:16] randoms question and the rabbi says
[1:06:20] Messiah will be gone no not the Son of
[1:06:26] God the Messiah will be got so little
[1:06:31] when geuman when Peter stands here here
[1:06:35] he identifies amen this are with mrs.
[1:06:39] Smith the answer to the question
[1:06:41] identify who Christ is he says thou art
[1:06:44] the Christ the Son of the Living God and
[1:06:48] what he's trying to say you are
[1:06:58] he made a mess but he kept telling us a
[1:07:01] blast about simon barjona because we
[1:07:05] should not reveal this to you but my
[1:07:08] father reveal this to you and I said I'd
[1:07:12] give you the keys you know to the
[1:07:14] kingdom this was a a man a very
[1:07:17] significant a statement and lord help me

[1:14:22] mean so she walked into the church she
[1:14:26] would cry now I'm a I'm up to y'all some
[1:14:29] secrets but I remember when when we
[1:14:34] first when we started church there and
[1:14:36] Green Acres and and sister Michelle that

[1:14:42] sisters Maya stopped crying
[1:14:52] certainly appreciate the journey a man a
[1:14:57] man never thought he had me but I got a
[1:15:00] week I'm trying to move on y'all bear
[1:15:08] with me I got I got I got so much all
[1:15:14] right so I am from where the holidays of
[1:15:19] God is ringing from the bottom of your
[1:15:20] heart and an old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:15:22] sent revival hits the place then you
[1:15:25] begin to see things then God will begin
[1:15:31] to reveal things you ain't gonna see
[1:15:34] nothing you ain't gonna have no
[1:15:36] revelation and to the Holy Ghost brings
[1:15:39] it all right so this is why it's
[1:15:43] important for us to get under under
[1:15:45] expectation and anticipation for the
[1:15:47] Holy Ghost hey man come on y'all hey man
[1:15:53] all right
[1:15:54] since did yo then you wonder why these
[1:15:55] real Christians are hanging on and and
[1:15:58] why they're praying for you what a
[1:16:01] revival and he got in the spirit now the
[1:16:06] reason that these people have dances if
[1:16:09] they didn't have a dance so they could
[1:16:11] get in the spirit of dancing when they
[1:16:15] announced there's gonna be a dance you
[1:16:17] already know what to do when or if it's
[1:16:21] gonna be a dance you know get your dance
[1:16:24] clothes on huh hey man and listen to
[1:16:28] your music before you get here so you
[1:16:30] know what we get ready to do
[1:16:32] watch yourself a few moves so you
[1:16:36] understand what's give it you got to get
[1:16:37] him to the spirit of the dance hello
[1:16:40] somebody I'm talking if you're going to
[1:16:43] dances I don't go to dances now I try I
[1:16:48] try but I don't go you know but I
[1:16:50] remember this one brother went a patient
[1:16:52] shouldn't depend that nobody use brother
[1:16:54] my brother went to the dance and when he
[1:16:57] got to the dance the music
[1:16:59] got real good to him and he jumped out
[1:17:01] in the middle oh say honey he's setting
[1:17:09] up in there he's full of it at church
[1:17:14] alright but if you're gonna go to the
[1:17:19] dance again and get into the spirit of
[1:17:20] the dance all right let me let me go he
[1:17:25] says well you can't have a ball King
[1:17:28] unless you get in the spirit of
[1:17:30] everything now you that when it's about
[1:17:34] a team got home court advantage is
[1:17:36] because the the fans are playing in a
[1:17:39] certain atmosphere a certain spirits
[1:17:43] they get loud when the man trying to
[1:17:47] shoot free throws they doing everything
[1:17:49] to distract them but those eyes are
[1:17:51] creating an atmosphere to make the very
[1:17:54] hostile are you with me they're making a
[1:17:59] hostile for the enemy a man making very
[1:18:03] difficult for the opposing team and you
[1:18:08] can control
[1:18:13] you trying to make things hot Wow
[1:18:17] you tryna make it baby
[1:18:20] alline do anything in here
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:49] hallelujah gotta pee on the inside
[1:18:54] don't panic don't panic I know you're
[1:18:59] going through but don't panic I'm Shane
[1:19:06] to title my sermon today y'all watch
[1:19:07] this you have a ball game unless you're
[1:19:12] given the spirit of the ball game you've
[1:19:13] got to get in the spirit of it and we
[1:19:16] can never have a revivalist report or
[1:19:18] should I say West Palm Beach or anywhere
[1:19:20] else until the church gets into this in
[1:19:23] the spirit of revival God can God can
[1:19:28] come and perform miracles and we've seen
[1:19:30] him do that he can show wonders we seen
[1:19:33] him do that he can stretch forth his
[1:19:35] hand to heal the sick and afflicted the
[1:19:38] preacher can preach the gospel as hard
[1:19:39] as he can but there'll never be a
[1:19:41] revival until the church gets in the
[1:19:47] spirit of revival can I enter interject
[1:19:50] something there we own Dania fast
[1:19:54] we own the Dania facts and we need
[1:19:58] everybody participate in the fast not
[1:20:02] just the preacher understand not just to
[1:20:05] preach it praise the Lord
[1:20:07] yeah I told some saints I was coming
[1:20:09] back out with this today went to church
[1:20:12] on one night we started fast in one day
[1:20:17] and peoples off the fast in one night
[1:20:20] y'all gonna have to see y'all got to
[1:20:22] shape up a conch fritter really really
[1:20:32] really and when your doctor tell you
[1:20:38] defense because they got to do some
[1:20:40] tests or whatever you have no problem
[1:20:42] with that you the concentrator won't
[1:20:44] bother you but when the pastor say pass
[1:20:47] palm count excuses we're not not getting
[1:20:51] up from God to everybody give them
[1:20:52] spirit everybody and let me tell you
[1:20:58] something if you're struggling with the
[1:21:00] fast don't talk to other people that
[1:21:03] struggling because if you struggling and
[1:21:06] then struggling y'all will not overcome
[1:21:08] all y'all gon being defeated talk to
[1:21:11] other people that's actually doing it
[1:21:13] don't talk to us that's not doing it
[1:21:15] find somebody that's do it that's where
[1:21:18] you get your strength from all right I
[1:21:20] just need to drop these things off I
[1:21:22] tell ya I got I gotta say this before we
[1:21:24] before we go further praise the Lord
[1:21:27] all right I'm in here I'm in here minds
[1:21:31] we're just staying here praise the Lord
[1:21:34] aid man now let's see where am I I told
[1:21:37] y'all don't panic don't panic I know
[1:21:40] you're going through but don't panic
[1:21:41] okay so the importance of revelation by
[1:21:44] the spirit to a true believer can never
[1:21:46] be over emphasized by this Everett about
[1:21:48] three weeks I've been emphasizing it's a
[1:21:50] man so it can never be overemphasized
[1:21:53] revelation means more to you than
[1:21:55] perhaps you might realize these are some
[1:21:57] things that the Prophet said he said
[1:21:59] it's the revelation of God that will
[1:22:01] give you a fall red team all over the
[1:22:04] devil a man not that not not the the
[1:22:09] good song a man is going to be
[1:22:10] revelation that give you authority over
[1:22:12] the devil I like that right
[1:22:15] I remember sister Wesco brother Westco
[1:22:18] always shared his testimony sister wesco
[1:22:20] she got a revelation from God and the
[1:22:23] doctors that told the family come
[1:22:25] together your mama gonna die you know
[1:22:26] y'all might as well get together and do
[1:22:28] this and do that and you know your
[1:22:29] mama's get ready to leave here and she
[1:22:31] prayed about it say Lord you know I just
[1:22:33] I just don't believe that this is this
[1:22:35] this is right it shouldn't be and God
[1:22:36] revealed hug your mama ain't gonna die
[1:22:38] now medical science says she was but
[1:22:41] revelation says she was
[1:22:43] right and sister sister sister let's go
[1:22:46] is the only one standing and see this is
[1:22:48] the individual revelation right when
[1:22:51] sister Resco car that she began to tell
[1:22:53] her family said mama not gonna die and
[1:22:55] they say well you don't lost your mind
[1:22:57] you know the doctor said no God told me
[1:22:59] mama is not gonna die and she was the
[1:23:01] only one standing by herself with that
[1:23:04] revelation do you realize that by the
[1:23:07] time the whole situation over God
[1:23:09] deliver her mama from that hospital bed
[1:23:11] raised her up she lived another 13 years
[1:23:15] before she died and she did that based
[1:23:18] on a revelation that was given to her
[1:23:20] daughter revelation can change a lot of
[1:23:23] things revelation can change your
[1:23:26] situation I want to say that again I'm
[1:23:29] there you going through some stuff but
[1:23:31] revelation can change your situation and
[1:23:35] the reason it can change your situation
[1:23:37] because your home and then the way that
[1:23:40] you begin to respond it's not based on
[1:23:43] what others are saying that you respond
[1:23:45] face for your revelation according to
[1:23:51] your revelation you live according to
[1:23:54] your revelation
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:26] based on your revelation collaboration
[1:24:30] can change your situation there is
[1:24:37] nothing of such prevailing power as a
[1:24:41] revelation of the word of God Amen
[1:24:45] nothing with such prevailing power now
[1:24:48] let me slip over here a man into
[1:24:52] something glory to God I said on panic
[1:24:55] for whatever you do just don't panic
[1:24:58] hallelujah hallelujah a man I was
[1:25:02] bringing this out on last week when
[1:25:08] Jesus went a man to Caesarea Philippi
[1:25:14] and he went to this place for these
[1:25:18] words to be said amen and this place it
[1:25:20] was very significant you know when we
[1:25:23] read Matthew 16 when I read verse 21
[1:25:26] showing you that after he said it he was
[1:25:29] headed towards Calvary let's read verse
[1:25:30] 21 again Matthew 16 verse 21 they'll
[1:25:35] pull it up on the screen for you if you
[1:25:37] want to get your Bibles I don't mind i
[1:25:38] actually like hearing the pages flip hey
[1:25:41] man that just that means something to me
[1:25:44] a man somebody came to church prepared
[1:25:47] glory to God not just depending on the
[1:25:49] screen if the screen was down what would
[1:25:51] y'all do and then when you went home
[1:25:53] went home you'll know where to turn
[1:25:55] glory to God amen
[1:25:57] Matthew 16 verse 21 now this is after he
[1:26:01] says upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:26:03] right and after he gives him the keys to
[1:26:05] the kingdom
[1:26:05] a man of heaven but but verse 21 he says
[1:26:10] from that time
[1:26:11] forth began Jesus shows his disciples
[1:26:15] how that he must go unto Jerusalem a man
[1:26:19] and suffer many things of the elders and
[1:26:21] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[1:26:24] and be raised again the third day so
[1:26:27] here he is you know after you know this
[1:26:31] particular passage and you know the Lord
[1:26:34] just kind of took me on a little journey
[1:26:36] myself here at hours I was seeing some
[1:26:38] things here this weekend just unlike see
[1:26:42] you know we're on our way to Calvary
[1:26:44] right we're building up a man as we as
[1:26:48] we take this journey towards Calvary
[1:26:50] right and and and when we we started it
[1:26:54] and I didn't realize that you know but
[1:26:55] when we were preaching the sermon amen
[1:26:59] to some miracles don't matter I used a
[1:27:02] particular story I said now that that's
[1:27:05] two unbelievers that it don't matter but
[1:27:07] to believe this is the children's bridge
[1:27:09] right and I didn't realize it but you
[1:27:13] know that that whole statement of is the
[1:27:16] children bread you will find that in
[1:27:18] Matthew 15 and then the Lord takes us to
[1:27:23] Matthew 16 and we get stuck here for a
[1:27:27] little bit but I'm trying to also bring
[1:27:30] you into Matthew 17 alright because
[1:27:34] because Matthew 16 he begins to show a
[1:27:37] man of disciples of you know some things
[1:27:40] here and he doesn't in a very specific
[1:27:42] place and i'ma get into that in a little
[1:27:44] bit if I can just just just don't panic
[1:27:47] whatever you whatever you do don't panic
[1:27:48] right well but i'ma get into that the
[1:27:50] back that brought back but he goes from
[1:27:52] Matthew 6:15 to Matthew 16 and and this
[1:27:56] great story happens accessory of
[1:27:57] philipot but then an in Matthew 17 glory
[1:28:01] to God I'm gonna just read these
[1:28:03] scriptures because we hit this this
[1:28:05] morning in in Sunday school and it's
[1:28:07] just absolute I didn't catch it till I
[1:28:08] was reading in the sunday school but
[1:28:10] let's let's let's get this and let's
[1:28:12] just start reading a man verse 1 and
[1:28:14] Matthew 17 lord have mercy Jesus glory
[1:28:19] to God you know what
[1:28:20] y'all just barely we're gonna read all
[1:28:23] of the rest of 16 and then all the
[1:28:24] students
[1:28:25] the first 13 verses 17 imma go there
[1:28:29] verse 21 22 and in Matthew 16 says that
[1:28:34] then Peter took him oh yeah I needed
[1:28:36] this one I forgot I'm glad I'm glad I
[1:28:37] hope Thank You Holy Ghost
[1:28:39] thank you all he goes verse 21 again
[1:28:44] from that time forth began Jesus
[1:28:46] assuring to his disciples how that he
[1:28:48] must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many
[1:28:50] things of the elders and chief priests
[1:28:52] the scribes and be killed and be raised
[1:28:53] again the third thing but Peter took him
[1:28:56] and began to rebuke him saying be it far
[1:28:59] from the lord this shall not be unto
[1:29:01] thee but he turned and said unto Peter
[1:29:03] get thee behind me Satan see the st.
[1:29:07] Peter that was said blessed art thou now
[1:29:10] is being rebuked right but he turned to
[1:29:13] 7 Peter get thee behind me Satan now art
[1:29:16] an offence unto me for thou savourest
[1:29:18] not the things that be of God but but
[1:29:20] those of those that be admit me stop and
[1:29:23] say Pete he was not calling Peter the
[1:29:25] devil he was there was the devil
[1:29:28] speaking through Peter anointing him a
[1:29:31] man at that time glory to God Alleluia
[1:29:33] the devil can show get us and some of
[1:29:35] your closest people your friends your
[1:29:39] family the devil can get in them you
[1:29:44] yesterday would care if you open
[1:29:47] yourself up to him he can come in sorry
[1:29:49] I said then Dan said Jesus unto his
[1:29:51] disciples If any man will come after me
[1:29:52] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:29:54] cross and follow me for whosoever will
[1:29:57] save his life shall lose it and
[1:29:58] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:30:00] shall find it and I like this this is
[1:30:03] what I wanted to stumble over these
[1:30:05] things these are things jesus said
[1:30:06] before he goes to the cross for what
[1:30:09] what what is a man profited if he shall
[1:30:13] gain the whole world and lose his own
[1:30:17] soul or what shall a man give in
[1:30:19] exchange for his soul now there's a
[1:30:21] sermon just index right what does it I
[1:30:26] mean I used to hear that when I was when
[1:30:28] I was coming up that's what actually
[1:30:31] gave me guidance when it came to a man
[1:30:36] going after my
[1:30:38] that's my career and keeping things
[1:30:41] balanced with cards right because I
[1:30:45] realized that I could go out for my
[1:30:46] professional career and I can achieve
[1:30:49] great success amen in the natural I can
[1:30:53] do that but if I did not have God then
[1:30:57] it did not matter because at the end
[1:31:00] Amen when when you get better leave this
[1:31:02] room at the end nobody gonna care all of
[1:31:05] the things that you did you can't take
[1:31:07] the money with you you can't take the
[1:31:10] press speech with you you can't take
[1:31:12] nothing with you but your character so I
[1:31:17] learned at a very early age we had to
[1:31:19] keep these things balanced and I want to
[1:31:21] bring that that you keep these things
[1:31:22] balanced lord help me Jesus
[1:31:24] right but what isn't a man what is a man
[1:31:26] profited if he shall gain the whole
[1:31:27] world and lose his own soul or what
[1:31:31] shall a man give in exchange was slow
[1:31:34] but a son of man shall come in the glory
[1:31:37] of his father with his angels and then
[1:31:40] he shall reward every man according to
[1:31:41] his works fairly I'm sending you there
[1:31:43] be some standing here which shall not
[1:31:45] taste of death until they see the
[1:31:46] kingdom see the Son of man coming in the
[1:31:48] Katyn his kingdom I want to go further
[1:31:52] but it's just hard it's hard it's hard
[1:31:54] I'm by God's grace I'm coming back I
[1:31:57] want to go to Matthew 17 but before I do
[1:31:59] that I got I got to just stop here at
[1:32:01] Matthew 16 accessory of Philip I I've
[1:32:05] told you all what this place was was
[1:32:09] geez this was a place full of idol
[1:32:11] worship and I want to read just a couple
[1:32:14] of things you know here regardless that
[1:32:16] I found on the Internet
[1:32:18] this this actual place Caesarea Philippi
[1:32:21] was actually known as the gates of Hell
[1:32:24] right
[1:32:25] they was known as the gates of Hell so
[1:32:27] when he says the gates of Hell shall not
[1:32:29] prevail against it that has multiple
[1:32:31] meanings right but but this place that
[1:32:34] Jesus is telling this to the disciples
[1:32:36] he's standing in the place known as the
[1:32:39] gates of Hell now there's a reason that
[1:32:42] it's known as the gates well let me just
[1:32:43] let me just help you with some of this
[1:32:46] they said that this place was called the
[1:32:48] city of pagans and they said on an old
[1:32:51] test
[1:32:51] time's the northeastern area of Israel
[1:32:54] became a center for Bell worship and the
[1:32:57] nearby city of damned Israelite King
[1:32:59] Jeroboam built the high place that
[1:33:01] angered God and eventually led the
[1:33:04] Israelites to worship false gods
[1:33:06] eventually worship of Bell was replaced
[1:33:10] with the worship of Greek fertility gods
[1:33:12] now this is what happened when they got
[1:33:14] off the revelation a man they began to
[1:33:17] just go from one thing to the next thing
[1:33:19] hey man when they left the true
[1:33:21] foundation they began to go from one
[1:33:23] thing to the next thing and if I
[1:33:24] couldn't say that's exactly what's
[1:33:26] happening to folk today when they leave
[1:33:28] the world and then they end up here in
[1:33:31] the end up there and if you'll never
[1:33:33] find no place to rest they had all right
[1:33:37] I'm going on says years later when the
[1:33:39] Romans conquered the territory Herod
[1:33:42] Philip rebuilt the city and named it
[1:33:44] after himself accessory Oh Philip I
[1:33:46] continue to focus on the worship of
[1:33:48] Greek gods and the cliff that stood
[1:33:51] above the city local people built
[1:33:53] shrines and temples to pan pan pan the
[1:33:57] god Pan this was the God that they
[1:33:59] worship this God Pam alright stay with
[1:34:02] me here alright so um says uh later on
[1:34:05] says since Rhea Philip I we stood in a
[1:34:08] lush area near the foot of Mount Hermon
[1:34:10] became the religious center for worship
[1:34:13] of the Greek god Pan the Greeks named
[1:34:16] the city tonight upon eius in his honor
[1:34:19] now pan is a God of the while a man is a
[1:34:24] God of shepherds and flocks in a man of
[1:34:27] nature of a rustic of music and all kind
[1:34:30] of stuff like this but uh he was known
[1:34:34] to be a God that was half goat and half
[1:34:37] human
[1:34:38] all right this dis god Pan was known to
[1:34:41] be half goat and half human
[1:34:45] now there's another interesting a man
[1:34:48] statement here about this dock pan
[1:34:52] because the root word amen of Pennock
[1:34:56] comes from the name pan
[1:35:03] so when I say don't panic I really mean
[1:35:07] that
[1:35:08] don't panic search right because because
[1:35:11] predict this was the route I'm innocent
[1:35:13] it originated from the worship of this
[1:35:16] God pan you understand I think God don't
[1:35:21] give you the spirit of fear does not
[1:35:24] give you the spirit of I mean a panic in
[1:35:27] about you should be in control Amen God
[1:35:30] is on your side and no matter no matter
[1:35:32] what it is that you're going to gobble
[1:35:35] me to do that thing if he left the
[1:35:38] toilet he'll lead you through it but
[1:35:44] whatever you do don't don't panic
[1:35:47] notice this God paying what was the god
[1:35:51] of this area that Jesus is standing it
[1:35:53] and this God is half human half dope now
[1:35:58] why would Jesus be standing here in this
[1:36:01] place a man glory to God oh let me let
[1:36:04] me go on a little I got a little bit
[1:36:06] more than that but uh but why would
[1:36:08] Jesus be standing because Jesus was the
[1:36:10] scapegoat Jesus was the scapegoat and
[1:36:17] being that he was the scapegoat that
[1:36:19] would be offer for our sins a man he
[1:36:22] stood in that place and he began to tell
[1:36:24] the disciples certain things and then
[1:36:26] after that he began to talk about how
[1:36:27] you had to go to Jerusalem and how he
[1:36:29] had to die the scapegoat was given to
[1:36:32] take our stands to Calvary not like a
[1:36:35] cavalry but he went to hell so we don't
[1:36:37] have to go the scapegoat did this see
[1:36:41] everything that Jesus did was extremely
[1:36:44] significant there was nothing that was
[1:36:46] happening it wasn't it wasn't just
[1:36:48] happening by chance and let me tell you
[1:36:50] whatever you're going through is not
[1:36:51] just happening by chance God has purpose
[1:36:54] but everything you're going through Oh
[1:36:56] glory to God glory to God
[1:37:00] alright let me let me let me let me let
[1:37:03] me read a quote on that one this is out
[1:37:06] of the message taken away this was from
[1:37:08] last Sunday all right this is what the
[1:37:10] prophets taking away a man is
[1:37:14] but then one go there had to be cast a
[1:37:16] lot cast and this is from if you want to
[1:37:18] read more about this Leviticus 16 is
[1:37:20] where you find it there had to be a lot
[1:37:22] cast and a lot fell on one go it dot see
[1:37:25] they have two goats that they would
[1:37:26] bring a man before the priest and the
[1:37:28] priest would take one go go and kill it
[1:37:30] and then the other go he would actually
[1:37:32] have to take it and send it out into the
[1:37:34] wild now stay with me i'ma show you that
[1:37:37] the one that went out into the wild was
[1:37:38] a scapegoat but now actually brother
[1:37:40] branham tells us that Jesus represented
[1:37:42] both ghosts the goat that was killed and
[1:37:44] the goat that went out into the wild all
[1:37:46] right look he says there had to be a lot
[1:37:49] cast and the flop fell on one go it died
[1:37:51] and then the blood of this goat was
[1:37:54] placed upon the other goat with the
[1:37:56] hands of the high priest confessing the
[1:37:58] sins of the people now notice I says
[1:38:00] that his place throwing the other girl
[1:38:02] with the hands of the high priest if you
[1:38:03] go back and read Leviticus 16 you'll see
[1:38:06] that there were certain times that the
[1:38:08] high priests had to washes hands right
[1:38:10] but when he was dealing with the blood
[1:38:11] of the one group that was killed and
[1:38:13] then and then when he went to the other
[1:38:15] goat and put his hands on his head and
[1:38:17] then he said now you bury this on out
[1:38:19] into the wild as a scapegoat
[1:38:20] he'd never washed his hands in between
[1:38:22] that process so so when he killed the
[1:38:24] one he had blood on his hands and then
[1:38:26] he took that same blood and put it on
[1:38:28] the hands of the other goat and sent out
[1:38:30] into the wild Jesus bore our sins Oh
[1:38:34] glory their God's a man listen he says
[1:38:38] how he says with the hands and a high
[1:38:40] priest confess to the sins of the people
[1:38:41] from the living goat and then a man who
[1:38:43] was worried at taking a living go on
[1:38:45] this arm and went away into the
[1:38:47] wilderness when the goat would have to
[1:38:48] perish and go into an isolated
[1:38:51] out-of-the-way place never no more in
[1:38:53] that state to come back into the family
[1:38:55] of his own again but to be isolated
[1:38:57] forever bearing the sins of the people
[1:38:59] away now I know many scholars perhaps
[1:39:02] are standing here especially their
[1:39:04] Venice they think that one that one goat
[1:39:08] was Christ and the other one was the
[1:39:10] devil my brother and I have two
[1:39:12] different a little on that we can't
[1:39:14] sacrifice to the devil
[1:39:15] both those record
[1:39:17] in Christ both of them as Christ Christ
[1:39:20] is or he brought us in and he brought
[1:39:23] with him his self away devil came there
[1:39:26] my sin Christ is our sin bear get it
[1:39:30] straight then your faith won't move
[1:39:31] Christ is our sin bear and the sins of
[1:39:34] the world
[1:39:35] Christ was the dying animal at the cross
[1:39:37] listen the lamb slain from the
[1:39:39] foundation of the world now I'll stop
[1:39:42] with that
[1:39:42] amen that quote right there the other
[1:39:44] thing that happened here at this place
[1:39:45] accessory of Phillip I was called Amen
[1:39:48] like I told you two gates of hell and
[1:39:50] I'm just getting some information on
[1:39:52] presenting see the pagan mind at this
[1:39:55] cave accessory of Phillip on they the
[1:39:57] cake that like the pagan mind created a
[1:39:59] gate to the underworld where fertility
[1:40:02] gods lived during the winter and say
[1:40:05] they committed to testable acts to
[1:40:06] worship these false gods oh my god y'all
[1:40:09] stay with me here today since I'm here
[1:40:14] they are that the pagans of Jesus day
[1:40:17] come and belief that their fertility
[1:40:20] gods lived in the underworld during the
[1:40:23] winter and return each spring they saw
[1:40:27] water as a symbol of the underworld and
[1:40:30] thought that their gods travel to and
[1:40:33] from that world through case so this is
[1:40:35] why I was called the gates of Hell the
[1:40:37] underworld right this but notice Jesus
[1:40:40] is tenant in this place and he's not
[1:40:41] giving Peter keys to the underworld he
[1:40:45] given Peter keys to the kingdom of
[1:40:48] heaven oh my god he's not given I mean
[1:40:52] here they're dead practicing these
[1:40:54] things because you know here is Satan is
[1:40:56] getting all kind of worship in this very
[1:40:58] spot now Jesus goes and gives a believer
[1:41:01] amen keys to the kingdom of heaven and
[1:41:04] what are the keys do it give you power
[1:41:06] to bind and loose that's why I say don't
[1:41:10] panic you don't you don't need to panic
[1:41:12] you know you can change the situation
[1:41:15] with your works oh lord have mercy
[1:41:18] y'all don't realize that you can change
[1:41:20] the circumstance with your words buying
[1:41:24] that devil in the name of Jesus all
[1:41:27] right
[1:41:28] let me go wrong the pagan mind the the
[1:41:34] cage in Springwood accessory Oh Philip
[1:41:36] our creative gate to the underworld they
[1:41:37] believe that their city was literally at
[1:41:39] the gates of the underworld the gates of
[1:41:41] hell in order to attend sighs to return
[1:41:44] of their God and each year the people of
[1:41:46] caesarea philippi engaged in horrible
[1:41:48] deeds
[1:41:51] it was prostitution and all kind of
[1:41:53] other stuff happening there in that
[1:41:55] place but Jesus stood in this very
[1:41:57] wicked place this very evil place and it
[1:42:01] says the gates of Hell won't prevail
[1:42:02] against you and if you can stand there
[1:42:05] and tell Peter that and that wicked
[1:42:06] place let me tell you something I don't
[1:42:08] care what you're going through they're
[1:42:09] not they're not doing it that bad where
[1:42:11] you wherever you at right now it ain't
[1:42:12] that bad but the gates of hell won't
[1:42:15] prevail against you either all right
[1:42:18] I'm picking up in Matthew 17 this is you
[1:42:22] know this is a journey towards Calvary
[1:42:24] Oh God but I got to give it to you from
[1:42:28] an angle of spiritual revelation because
[1:42:31] if you don't catch it spiritually you'll
[1:42:33] miss it you're gonna miss God and so
[1:42:35] many other forms a man I brought
[1:42:38] something else out last week that I'll
[1:42:40] touch it again and then we'll go on but
[1:42:42] Matthew 17 notice now after Jesus has
[1:42:44] this experience accessory of Philip I'll
[1:42:46] now he's carrying them all and and I
[1:42:48] didn't you know we're not when I got
[1:42:51] there to Israel last year and I saw
[1:42:53] these things just for myself then it
[1:42:55] made sense to me right it made a lot of
[1:42:57] sense to me Jerusalem Jerusalem to where
[1:43:00] accessory of Philip Isle it's a pretty
[1:43:02] good journey right it's a good journey
[1:43:04] and they did everything by foot they
[1:43:07] that they weren't riding in vehicles or
[1:43:09] and things like that they did everything
[1:43:10] by foot so this is you know even where
[1:43:13] Mount Transfiguration happened it was by
[1:43:16] foot that Jesus took them from Caesarea
[1:43:18] Philippi to get to you know this place
[1:43:20] with Mount Transfiguration and notice
[1:43:22] what the Bible says in verse 1 chapter
[1:43:23] 17 after 6 days because it took him that
[1:43:27] long to walk there after six days Jesus
[1:43:30] taketh Peter James and John his brother
[1:43:33] and bring them up into the high mountain
[1:43:35] apart now I want you to remember this
[1:43:37] glory to God remember
[1:43:41] Peter was the one that expressed the
[1:43:43] revelation of who Christ was in Matthew
[1:43:45] 16 Peter was the one that caught it and
[1:43:48] Jesus blessed him for his revelation
[1:43:51] notice this but says after six days
[1:43:53] Jesus taketh Peter James and John his
[1:43:56] brother and brings them up into a
[1:43:57] mountain uh bringing them up into a high
[1:44:00] mountain apart and was transfigured
[1:44:02] before them and his face did shine as
[1:44:06] the Sun and his raiment was white as the
[1:44:09] light and the world that appeared unto
[1:44:11] them Moses and Elijah talked with him
[1:44:15] now last week I talked about how Moses
[1:44:18] and Elijah were the witnesses of the
[1:44:21] book of Revelation these are the two
[1:44:22] witnesses a man the Bob was playing in
[1:44:25] tell us Moses and Elijah was talking
[1:44:28] with him glory to God then answered
[1:44:31] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[1:44:33] good for us to be here if thou wilt let
[1:44:37] us make here three Tabernacles one for
[1:44:39] thee one for Moses and one for Elijah
[1:44:41] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[1:44:44] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[1:44:46] of the cloud which said this is my
[1:44:49] beloved son and will my am well pleased
[1:44:52] hear you him now I like the way that
[1:44:54] this is set up because Peter was the one
[1:44:57] that expressed it in matthew 16 by his
[1:45:00] old post revelation when Jesus acts who
[1:45:03] the newspaper I have a son a man named
[1:45:05] Peter sent down for Christ he said what
[1:45:08] he's saying is that you got in flesh
[1:45:10] this is what Peter said you are God in
[1:45:13] flesh now I want you understand Peter
[1:45:15] expressed his revelation but God came
[1:45:18] back and written in matthew 17 and
[1:45:21] vindicated
[1:45:22] revelation Peter expressed it but God
[1:45:27] vindicated when he said this is my
[1:45:29] beloved son hear you him and I won't
[1:45:35] tell you something you will have to
[1:45:37] express your personal revelation and
[1:45:41] after you express your personal
[1:45:43] revelation God vindicated Oh hallelujah
[1:45:52] CC you know a lot of times what we want
[1:45:55] God to do is vindicate first before we
[1:45:57] Express but no you got to learn how to
[1:45:59] express even when everything is coming
[1:46:02] against you your family don't believe
[1:46:07] you
[1:46:07] your friends don't believe they thank
[1:46:11] you crazy I mean you know you know it's
[1:46:18] strange to follow prophet nowadays
[1:46:21] everybody thank you create now God will
[1:46:24] use prophets no more we wouldn't did he
[1:46:25] stop show me in the Bible when he
[1:46:27] stopped I know he started to show me
[1:46:29] where he stopped I got to go further in
[1:46:32] the scripture right because you know the
[1:46:35] thing of it is this this message that we
[1:46:37] believe in y'all this message that we're
[1:46:38] standing off was promised by the Bible
[1:46:42] the problem is the problem is that our
[1:46:45] teachers in our former churches could
[1:46:48] not teach these things because it had
[1:46:50] not been revealed to them if you just
[1:46:54] begin to look back you know as to where
[1:46:56] God even brought you from some of the
[1:46:58] churches that he brought you out of all
[1:47:00] the people that was in those churches
[1:47:02] but God would choose you to reveal this
[1:47:06] truth to come on church like I'll tell
[1:47:10] you sometimes just go back in go
[1:47:12] be my guest go enjoy yourself you will
[1:47:17] see the difference you'll see the
[1:47:20] difference
[1:47:20] oh my god ain't no more life out there
[1:47:25] y'all and I know that that hurt people
[1:47:28] when you say you're trying to say you
[1:47:30] the only one with it well let's go back
[1:47:33] to Cain and Abel which one had it only
[1:47:35] I've had it it's always only been one a
[1:47:40] man and I'm gonna tell you Jesus is the
[1:47:42] one a man but but you know don't get
[1:47:45] offended by these things I mean receive
[1:47:47] revenue just gonna take spiritual
[1:47:49] revelation for you to understand what
[1:47:51] I'm trying to tell you he wouldn't even
[1:47:53] want to come to a man in there he spoke
[1:47:55] only have one wife praise the Lord
[1:47:59] she's probably have one husband right
[1:48:02] it's all right always get back down to
[1:48:03] one
[1:48:04] a man hallelujah glory to God all right
[1:48:08] let me let me go in here but what I want
[1:48:11] you to see is Peter expressed it by
[1:48:14] faith he said and it's another bonus
[1:48:16] that the other disciples didn't say
[1:48:18] anything I don't know if they were
[1:48:19] thinking it or not but Jesus said
[1:48:21] because he said Peter blessed are you oh
[1:48:24] my god and later on the very next
[1:48:28] chapter God comes and vindicates Peters
[1:48:31] revelation vindicated it and God gonna
[1:48:36] Bend occasional revelation see and what
[1:48:39] the other thing that kind of my spirit
[1:48:40] is see that this why he told the woman
[1:48:42] amen in the days we Elijah
[1:48:44] oh my bake me a cake first I know you I
[1:48:50] know you hungry I know you're starving I
[1:48:53] know your family ain't got enough food I
[1:48:56] know you're going through some things
[1:48:58] but I want you to do I want you to honor
[1:49:01] my word first Oh God y'all ain't got it
[1:49:06] I need I need that I need to break it
[1:49:08] down even a little bit further I want
[1:49:11] you to honor me first I want you to pay
[1:49:14] your tithes and offering first huh I
[1:49:18] want you to give me your firstfruits I
[1:49:20] want you to do that first and see what
[1:49:23] you said Lord Lord I need you to show me
[1:49:25] a miracle first gossiped no no I need
[1:49:27] you to show me your faith first
[1:49:32] giving up a first and then I'm bill
[1:49:35] perform a miracle but I mean decision
[1:49:39] trust me first
[1:49:41] let your Revelation speak fast hmm see
[1:49:49] God comes up to Vindicator
[1:49:52] after you did do what you supposed to do
[1:49:55] look at it now verse 5 again while he s
[1:49:58] fake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:49:59] them well the voice of the cloud which
[1:50:02] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:50:06] well pleased hear ye him and Peter had
[1:50:09] the pedo at the being in his spot to see
[1:50:11] all these things happen he see logic see
[1:50:13] Moses you see he see all this verse 6s
[1:50:16] and when the disciples heard it they
[1:50:17] fell on their face or were so afraid and
[1:50:20] Jesus came and touched them and said
[1:50:23] arise and be not afraid and when they
[1:50:26] had lifted up their eyes they saw no man
[1:50:28] save Jesus only and as they came down
[1:50:31] from the mountain Jesus charged them
[1:50:33] saying tell the vision to no man until
[1:50:36] the Son of Man be risen again from the
[1:50:38] dead now this is where it gets tricky
[1:50:40] and I've been touching on these things
[1:50:43] but now let's just see if we can get in
[1:50:46] there a little bit more this is where it
[1:50:48] gets tricky because this portion of
[1:50:50] Scripture is for our day Jesus
[1:50:54] prophesied of where you're living at
[1:50:59] notice this now and his disciples asked
[1:51:04] him saying why then now see they
[1:51:07] understood the scriptures let me let me
[1:51:08] let me let me can I just go out there
[1:51:11] with me they're with me
[1:51:12] you can't understand Scripture if you
[1:51:17] don't get into the spirit before you
[1:51:19] read the Bible
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:24] you you can't you can't you you're not
[1:51:28] gonna be able to understand the Bible if
[1:51:31] you can't understand Amen if you don't
[1:51:33] get into the spirit of what's there lord
[1:51:36] help me Jesus
[1:51:38] right when you going to a ballgame you
[1:51:41] got to get into the spirit of the
[1:51:42] ballgame if you got to go to a man a
[1:51:44] dance you got to get into the spirit of
[1:51:46] this if you don't go to church you gotta
[1:51:48] get into the spirit of what's happening
[1:51:49] in church honey is somebody let let me
[1:51:53] tell you something I'm preaching the
[1:51:55] message you understand so giving them
[1:51:59] establish to that they hear what the
[1:52:00] Prophet saying yourself at home then
[1:52:03] you'll be able to identify what I'm
[1:52:05] saying your church if you're not given
[1:52:09] to the spirit of this thing look at the
[1:52:12] dance they listen to music then they go
[1:52:14] to the dance
[1:52:16] why not listen to the pop it before you
[1:52:18] come to church if you don't get in the
[1:52:25] Spiritist thing you go you're not gonna
[1:52:26] catch it I'm sorry I got out you know
[1:52:29] what I'm gonna just keep preaching I've
[1:52:34] know some of y'all done lost a tower a
[1:52:36] man just feeling it you but you knew
[1:52:40] ahead of time you just gonna lose that
[1:52:42] out and you ain't do nothing to just I
[1:52:47] went to bed early
[1:52:49] I'm where the bed earlier I'm ready to
[1:52:51] preach
[1:52:56] I'm stopping to stay right here with it
[1:52:58] alright watch this now because this is
[1:53:00] for you these words are for you and in
[1:53:05] these words that I'm giving to read have
[1:53:07] become a problem today many people are
[1:53:11] applying it the wrong way and when you
[1:53:14] miss apply it you you mess up some stuff
[1:53:16] but here it is verse 10 and it's a cyclo
[1:53:19] zags I'm saying why then say the scribes
[1:53:22] then Elijah must first come nigh me
[1:53:25] understood scripture they they they they
[1:53:27] parents that taught them they went the
[1:53:29] church they learned something in church
[1:53:31] they understood scripture they went in
[1:53:34] accent then why did say to scratch then
[1:53:38] Elijah must first come now that that let
[1:53:41] you know that they were looking for
[1:53:42] the squash were looking for Oh yo yo I
[1:53:47] mean the religious leader from that day
[1:53:50] we're looking for Roger hey Roger had
[1:53:53] come and gone and I have no idea here
[1:53:56] come and go and let me tell you
[1:53:58] something that the leaders today are
[1:54:00] always looking for logic but man
[1:54:04] come and go now you act let me let me
[1:54:10] let me just drop this off because we got
[1:54:13] to get into this not now
[1:54:14] they say logic must first come now let's
[1:54:16] read this read let's take this reason
[1:54:19] God Jesus answer the Senate and Elijah
[1:54:24] truly chef first come and restore all
[1:54:26] things let me read it real fast and I'll
[1:54:29] go back to read it slow but i standed
[1:54:32] you that Elijah has come already and
[1:54:34] they knew him not but have done unto him
[1:54:36] once ever they listed likewise shall
[1:54:39] also the seventh man suffer of them nice
[1:54:42] field talking about going to Calvary
[1:54:44] okay the scapegoat is on his way to
[1:54:46] count all right then the disciples
[1:54:48] understood that is fakin to them of John
[1:54:50] the Baptist wait hold on wait slow down
[1:54:53] wait how did they understand
[1:55:01] he never said it he didn't tell them of
[1:55:06] John the Baptist how did these disciples
[1:55:09] catch it spiritual revelation now let me
[1:55:15] ask you another question how could they
[1:55:18] say John the Baptist was because you
[1:55:20] know based on that time I'm talking up
[1:55:24] to that time I'm not you know when I say
[1:55:27] up to that time Old Testament scripture
[1:55:29] because the name John the Baptist is not
[1:55:31] an Old Testament because the first
[1:55:34] person P but the first question people
[1:55:35] ask you you say brother Branham where's
[1:55:37] his name in the Bible where's John the
[1:55:39] Baptist name in the Bible Old Testament
[1:55:42] I feel annoying that I can walk now
[1:55:55] where and how did they identify John the
[1:56:00] Baptist as a little angel
[1:56:04] how could they without spiritual
[1:56:08] revelation
[1:56:10] well the question is how can identify
[1:56:12] brother Branham when his name is not in
[1:56:15] the Bible
[1:56:16] how can identify him as the fulfillment
[1:56:19] a relaxant that restores all things cuz
[1:56:22] Jesus said it jesus said it I want to go
[1:56:25] back and read it
[1:56:26] jesus said if you lean on me I heard the
[1:56:32] master say come on I'm I'm moving on she
[1:56:39] pathetic and if Jesus thank these things
[1:56:42] we should be looking for this notice
[1:56:46] what Jesus means glory to God verse 11 7
[1:56:53] jesus answered coz they will they said
[1:56:55] widely described see that Elias must
[1:56:57] first come alive so much risk oh and
[1:56:59] Jesus
[1:57:01] he says he said Sheila said something
[1:57:03] you like to truly share first from every
[1:57:08] store all things but I say unto you that
[1:57:13] Elijah's already come which Elijah
[1:57:18] because there's two larges coming than
[1:57:20] them two versus there's a larger that
[1:57:24] came when Jesus said but I've sent me
[1:57:27] Elijah has already come that was talking
[1:57:29] about John the Baptist but we say Elijah
[1:57:31] was going to come and restore all things
[1:57:33] that was talking about brother branham's
[1:57:34] ministry what are we talking about what
[1:57:37] are we talking about his ministry was a
[1:57:39] restore truth what truth y'all what
[1:57:43] truth
[1:57:43] okay so many of them it's so many what
[1:57:46] about tis which way do we get baptized
[1:57:47] Father Son and Holy Ghost or in the name
[1:57:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ which one is
[1:57:52] right
[1:57:53] did Peter have it wrong does the
[1:57:57] scripture contradict itself yeah I mean
[1:57:59] Father Son and Holy Ghost is it three
[1:58:01] gods or one gods these are the things
[1:58:03] that were restored right
[1:58:05] I mean who should be in the pulpit who
[1:58:08] shouldn't be because the church then got
[1:58:11] away from it we don't even know what we
[1:58:14] the pulpit no more how how how how how
[1:58:24] can a woman be a bishop when the Bible
[1:58:31] I'm telling we go back to the Bible when
[1:58:34] the Bible say alright y'all don't pull
[1:58:36] me into something I wasn't going here
[1:58:38] but y'all gonna make me going here when
[1:58:41] the Bible say then the bishop must be -
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:51] so I can I wanna be
[1:58:55] with my Bibles say this do you know that
[1:59:17] when you have a woman in the pulpit
[1:59:19] preaching the Word of God that you are
[1:59:21] committing spiritual homosexuality
[1:59:34] spiritual homosexuality the Word of God
[1:59:39] is seed the Word of God is seeds and
[1:59:43] it's a man that carries seed woman
[1:59:48] carries egg man carries seed the woman
[1:59:57] represents the church the church has a
[2:00:00] womb to receive the Word of God
[2:00:03] spiritually I'm talking about the woman
[2:00:06] is the church so the women should
[2:00:09] receive seed from a man but when you
[2:00:16] have a woman trying to give seed to the
[2:00:20] church woman you have spiritual
[2:00:22] homosexuality and because you have
[2:00:27] spiritual homosexuality that's why you
[2:00:29] end up with natural homosexuals lead to
[2:00:32] the gospel well that they were Jews were
[2:00:37] prompted to take us back to the Lord
[2:00:39] back to you chew sometimes is unpopular
[2:00:43] but yet it's the truth
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:00:53] see this is what this is why God sent a
[2:00:55] prophet to keep us on the word not for
[2:00:58] us to worship Him we don't worship
[2:00:59] brother Branham we not here all right we
[2:01:02] don't sing those songs that clarify
[2:01:04] brother Branham all of our songs glorify
[2:01:06] God but we understand what Christ did
[2:01:09] through Scripture if if jesus promised
[2:01:12] it why should we look for don't get this
[2:01:17] wrong and to these questions well show
[2:01:20] me his name in the Bible you show me
[2:01:21] John the Baptist name in the Bible Old
[2:01:24] Testament all right so you gotta kick
[2:01:32] these these things of reveals spiritual
[2:01:35] revelation Church can I go a little
[2:01:38] further Oh God
[2:01:41] see this whole thing that was showed
[2:01:44] here to Peter James John you know here
[2:01:49] at Mount Transfiguration this whole
[2:01:50] thing and they caught up by revelation
[2:01:53] who he was talking about when he said
[2:01:55] Alliance must come on Elijah's come
[2:01:58] already and they knew him not but have
[2:02:02] done unto him what some of they listed
[2:02:03] likewise also shall the Son of Man
[2:02:05] suffer them then the disciples
[2:02:07] understood
[2:02:08] lord I pray one day that that same thing
[2:02:11] a drop and see it's like revelation just
[2:02:13] kind of just found its resting place in
[2:02:18] the heart city to slap then there I mean
[2:02:20] all this time is with Jesus and then
[2:02:22] like Elijah was supposed to come first
[2:02:24] Elijah suppose the first come Elijah and
[2:02:27] they hold it on to the scripture they
[2:02:28] think they got something they hold it on
[2:02:29] to and Jesus just finally just break it
[2:02:31] down Eli and I want to tell you another
[2:02:33] thing by the time the disciples
[2:02:36] understood that John the Baptist was the
[2:02:39] fulfillment of Elijah do you know your
[2:02:41] large had already died
[2:02:48] yeah come and go they was even maybe
[2:02:53] someone got baptized by him
[2:02:55] maybe I mean maybe they heard him preach
[2:02:58] the audience of the man had come and go
[2:03:00] and it finally struck them who he was
[2:03:08] history has a strange way of repeating
[2:03:12] itself but the only way that these
[2:03:17] disciples could understand it is they
[2:03:19] had to have spiritual revelation all
[2:03:24] right all right all right okay I'm gonna
[2:03:30] move on all right can I can I go back
[2:03:35] and hit something that I hit last week
[2:03:37] Kaluga I'm decent you know we just we
[2:03:39] just need this we need we need this all
[2:03:42] right this is out of that the great
[2:03:43] coming revival Oh God
[2:03:50] the Lord actually you know what the the
[2:03:53] the scripture that when we talk about a
[2:03:56] brother branham supposed to come Malachi
[2:03:57] 4:5 in 6 tells us that the whole lot was
[2:03:59] Cindy Elijah to prophet for the great
[2:04:01] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[2:04:03] turn the heart of the father's to the
[2:04:04] children to the heart of the children to
[2:04:05] their fathers lest I come and smite the
[2:04:06] earth with a curse now I've said this
[2:04:09] now violet this quote for me I was a
[2:04:11] great coming revival in the outpouring
[2:04:12] of the oldest fear I've said this before
[2:04:14] if you apply John the Baptist ministry
[2:04:17] to the restoration of all things then
[2:04:20] you have to deny the Ministry of the
[2:04:22] Lord Jesus Christ because if John the
[2:04:25] Baptist came to restore which is what
[2:04:27] people trying to teach today that John
[2:04:29] the Baptist the one that restored I'd
[2:04:31] say well what did you restore brother
[2:04:32] one brother told me baptism I say John
[2:04:35] restore baptism I said no that don't
[2:04:38] that don't really make sense to me I say
[2:04:40] because Paul told them to be baptized in
[2:04:42] acts 19 so it could be restored and then
[2:04:45] they doing something else a give us
[2:04:47] something else that John restored and
[2:04:49] I'm saying furthermore you gave me one
[2:04:51] thing that John restored now the Bible
[2:04:53] say all things give me some more stuff
[2:04:56] and I can tell you again I'm just going
[2:04:59] off the top of my head water baptism God
[2:05:02] hid the truth the marriage and divorce
[2:05:05] right come on what else did it restore
[2:05:09] right serpent see what happened in the
[2:05:12] Garden of Eden all that stuff was lost
[2:05:15] right I mean I'm just the future there's
[2:05:20] so many things that was lost in the
[2:05:22] church the baptism of Holy Ghost we're
[2:05:27] all these these teachings that was given
[2:05:29] back pass
[2:05:31] that's why restoration is glory to God
[2:05:35] oh my shut up shop right now boy
[2:05:39] this is it but I tell you what church
[2:05:42] let me let me let me let me let me let
[2:05:44] me keep going here we're expecting this
[2:05:46] but now let me let me just go and look
[2:05:48] further if I can today now I'll find my
[2:05:51] way out of here I promise I promise the
[2:05:54] great coming revival on out for the Holy
[2:05:56] Spirit I hit this on last week but I
[2:05:57] want to hit it again so now as I just
[2:06:00] said the antediluvian struction noir was
[2:06:03] a sign no one had the sign to start on
[2:06:05] when he's seen Enoch was taking up Enoch
[2:06:09] was taken up then Noah but then though
[2:06:12] it was time for Nora to start for he
[2:06:14] knew that would be the sign of his
[2:06:16] beginning and then and then the end
[2:06:18] would be near and Enoch of course was a
[2:06:21] type of the rapture group of the church
[2:06:22] and Noah's a type of the carried over of
[2:06:24] the elect of the Jews that would be
[2:06:26] carried through the tribulation period
[2:06:27] and we're now living in that day I was
[2:06:29] standing this little earlier if you
[2:06:31] apply John the Baptist being the
[2:06:33] restoration of all things John would a
[2:06:34] restored us restored us to law and that
[2:06:38] would have denied Greece right so you
[2:06:40] cannot put John the Baptist in that
[2:06:42] brother branham was the fulfillment of
[2:06:44] the restoration of all things Jesus
[2:06:46] prophesied that that Minister was coming
[2:06:49] and it's here and gone praise the Lord
[2:06:53] all right I'm just I'm just walking you
[2:06:57] through Scripture now this this quote
[2:07:01] here that I just read it was a problem
[2:07:03] it has become a problem a man to some
[2:07:06] people because they know that
[2:07:08] Enoch I went through all the
[2:07:10] calculations and everything of Enoch
[2:07:12] actually being gone six to nine years
[2:07:16] before no one would even see him right
[2:07:19] so if the quote says that knoweth star
[2:07:21] II not and that was his sign say how can
[2:07:23] he do that because Enoch was already
[2:07:25] don't he that he didn't die he walked
[2:07:27] with God right God called him away got
[2:07:30] it caught him up in a rapture he walked
[2:07:33] with God and so he was going six to nine
[2:07:35] years before Noah a man actually was
[2:07:38] even born
[2:07:39] all right so but spiritual revelation
[2:07:41] tells us that if Moses could be the one
[2:07:46] to write about what happened to Enoch
[2:07:48] because nobody else knew right Moses
[2:07:51] came even after Enoch after Noah after
[2:07:56] Abraham talked to all these people but
[2:07:59] he's the one that tells us what happened
[2:08:00] in Genesis Moses wrote the first five
[2:08:05] books of the Bible and all these things
[2:08:07] had already occurred how did Moses
[2:08:11] kitchen spiritual revelation that's how
[2:08:15] Moses caught it and I mean let me just
[2:08:17] also just kind of drop this off Moses
[2:08:22] was a prophet and God shows a prophet
[2:08:24] more than he shows everybody else
[2:08:28] because could nobody else write that I
[2:08:30] got a revelation no no no no we're not
[2:08:33] tell about that man
[2:08:35] amen my fist being a perfect cut
[2:08:38] something and dropped it off for the
[2:08:40] people gave us the first five books of
[2:08:42] the Bible
[2:08:42] so here - a man catches it and tells us
[2:08:46] that Enoch walked with God and then he
[2:08:49] says he says Noah days were Enoch with
[2:08:50] 365 years Enoch walked with God he was
[2:08:53] not for God took him now I'm gonna have
[2:08:55] to stop here y'all I gotta stop and go
[2:08:57] back to that scripture can you pull up
[2:09:01] Genesis 5 and 23 and 24 yeah I'll just
[2:09:07] bear with me
[2:09:08] y'all bear with me now Oh Lord Jesus
[2:09:13] hold on before I give him this before I
[2:09:16] give him this before I give him this
[2:09:19] one more cool God's provided place of
[2:09:23] worship now I I'm trying to bring all
[2:09:28] these things together if y'all just bear
[2:09:30] with me hey man Moses called it best
[2:09:35] spiritual revelation no one caught what
[2:09:39] happened to Enoch by spiritual
[2:09:40] revelation and guess what we caught it
[2:09:42] by spirit revelation hallelujah now
[2:09:47] there's another controversial quote that
[2:09:51] people using to pull away from the
[2:09:52] message and this was the quote that I
[2:09:55] said after I preached this it was
[2:09:58] brought back to my attention I say you
[2:09:59] know what let me I'm gonna go ahead and
[2:10:01] hit that I had in my notes last week but
[2:10:03] I didn't read it for y'all I read it
[2:10:04] this time this is look at this one and
[2:10:08] we found out that he not come into God's
[2:10:11] provided way with his word and walked
[2:10:15] 500 years and pleased him we found out
[2:10:19] that the mechanics was so perfect in him
[2:10:21] that when the denominators go to work in
[2:10:24] an engine it just took him off the earth
[2:10:26] he took the first airplane flight like
[2:10:28] to heaven working on God's mechanics and
[2:10:30] dynamics together he was not because God
[2:10:33] took him out of the earth without death
[2:10:35] that's exactly right he was walking and
[2:10:37] gods provided we notice that was 1965
[2:10:40] brother Branham passed away in December
[2:10:42] of 1965 this was April of 1965 that this
[2:10:46] quote was stated and he made a comment
[2:10:48] here the key thing that I want y'all to
[2:10:50] catch that he said is that he that we
[2:10:53] found out he not coming to gospel right
[2:10:54] away with his word and well five hundred
[2:10:56] years and pleased to welcome our hundred
[2:10:59] years that's not what the Bible state
[2:11:01] the Bible said three hundred and
[2:11:03] sixty-five years the Prophet said five
[2:11:06] hundred years and we have people that
[2:11:08] say well he's not a prophet because he
[2:11:10] said something that's against the Bible
[2:11:12] I think that's that's far fetched that's
[2:11:17] very far fetched now I want to go on I
[2:11:20] want I want I want to now I need that
[2:11:23] scripture because I need to I need to
[2:11:25] help you out see something
[2:11:27] here bear with me now y'all still with
[2:11:31] me trying to deal with some things but
[2:11:38] it's gonna be you know it's gonna take
[2:11:39] some spiritual revelation to catch this
[2:11:41] all right now notice this in this verse
[2:11:45] let me just get my notes right here so I
[2:11:48] can line it up just right Robert says in
[2:11:52] all the days of Enoch for 360 and five
[2:11:55] years so that's that's different from
[2:11:56] what that quote list said they said five
[2:11:58] hundred years but the Bible say three
[2:12:00] hundred sixty-five years notice the next
[2:12:02] thing next verse and II that walk with
[2:12:05] God he not walk with God and he was not
[2:12:10] for God took him now I'm gonna read that
[2:12:12] a little different this time I want to
[2:12:13] read the same verse I want to read it a
[2:12:15] little different this time and Enoch
[2:12:17] walked with God : and he was not
[2:12:23] semicolon for God took him
[2:12:30] can I read it again and Enoch walked
[2:12:33] with God : and he was not semicolon for
[2:12:40] God took him so we need to understand
[2:12:47] writing now okay the use for the colon
[2:12:52] and the semicolon in that script ago I
[2:12:55] can keep that scripture the use of the
[2:12:57] colon and the semicolon in that
[2:13:00] scripture the colon introduces an
[2:13:04] element or series of elements that
[2:13:10] illustrate amplify the information that
[2:13:16] preceded the colon the column
[2:13:26] is that an illustrator so so so let's
[2:13:32] being amplified notice inna walk with
[2:13:34] God we go by this
[2:13:40] and Moses goes will amplify so he
[2:13:43] responds and it puts a semicolon but a
[2:13:47] silicon sure is true independent clauses
[2:13:51] that return to signal a close connection
[2:13:54] between them so similar colors and he
[2:13:59] was not first
[2:14:00] wealthy gods that's that's the key thing
[2:14:03] that's the subject of this he is God he
[2:14:08] was not the last thing as God took him
[2:14:13] well that's what that's what Moses did
[2:14:17] yeah can we see what Paul said Paul said
[2:14:22] this vicious code in Hebrews 11
[2:14:24] go to Hebrews 11:5 it's okay don't panic
[2:14:31] don't panic don't panic don't don't need
[2:14:36] a message over it is no I'm just I'm
[2:14:42] using this now let me let me also just
[2:14:43] tell you I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[2:14:45] stand here and justify what brother
[2:14:48] Branham said about five hundred years I
[2:14:50] can't do that I can't do that I have a
[2:14:53] good feeling that if I'm using these
[2:14:55] worse if somebody pointed out to him
[2:14:58] brother Branham you said five hundred
[2:15:00] years but the Bible say three hundred
[2:15:02] sixty-five years if somebody pointed
[2:15:04] that I have a I have a good feeling that
[2:15:06] he was saying yeah take what the Bible
[2:15:09] say you know why I said it because he's
[2:15:11] already proven that most not where the
[2:15:13] Prophet was proven wrong
[2:15:16] no I'm using that in very loose terms
[2:15:18] when he's when he miss quoted something
[2:15:20] and it was say it wrong he had no
[2:15:23] problem repenting immediately go back to
[2:15:28] listen to the seals he he said seven
[2:15:30] hundred and she said seven thousand and
[2:15:32] when he heard that he
[2:15:34] home he repeated the very next service
[2:15:37] now people today when they get people
[2:15:42] they have a hard time coming back and
[2:15:44] saying I'm sorry I was wrong about that
[2:15:48] I'm sorry for criticizing that I was
[2:15:51] wrong about that let's see what Paul
[2:15:57] said about this cuz see the colon the
[2:15:59] colon is there to amplify let's see what
[2:16:04] Paul said about this same thing verse 5
[2:16:07] a man in Hebrews chapter 11 it says by
[2:16:10] faith Enoch was translated that he
[2:16:15] should not see death and was not found
[2:16:17] because God had translated him for
[2:16:21] before his translation he had his tests
[2:16:22] that have this testimony that he pleased
[2:16:24] God now the word translated is not in
[2:16:27] Genesis that's not what Moses said Moses
[2:16:31] didn't say he was translating just that
[2:16:33] he was a mote mote that Moses said that
[2:16:35] uh he walked with God and he was not for
[2:16:39] God took him no way to Paul get the
[2:16:42] freedom to it yes
[2:16:47] the Liberty takes place that he was
[2:16:50] translated because the colon that the
[2:16:56] colon gives him that Liberty the colon
[2:17:03] allows you to amplify this you know and
[2:17:10] I got a quote for we don't need new
[2:17:12] Bible translations to try to amplify
[2:17:14] Scripture all we need is worth the
[2:17:18] prophets man
[2:17:19] that illustrates in amplified Scripture
[2:17:24] that the colon was also used in the book
[2:17:32] of Jude can I read you for you verse 14
[2:17:38] and 15 Jude only one chapter in jute
[2:17:49] only a few verses but look look at jiù
[2:17:52] jiù jiù jiù jiù says and Enoch also the
[2:17:57] seventh from Adam prophesied of these
[2:18:01] saying behold the Lord cometh with ten
[2:18:05] thousands things first of all first of
[2:18:07] all first of all when did the Bible say
[2:18:09] if ojou that Enoch prophesied Moses did
[2:18:17] not say that Moses that he walked with
[2:18:22] God and God took him Moses didn't say
[2:18:27] nothing about him prophesied where did
[2:18:29] you get the liberty
[2:18:38] all right to execute judgment verse 15
[2:18:41] upon all and to convince all that all
[2:18:44] that all that are ungodly men I'm sorry
[2:18:49] and to convince all that are ungodly
[2:18:50] among them of all their ungodly deeds
[2:18:53] which they have ungodly committed and of
[2:18:56] all their hard speeches which ungodly
[2:18:58] sinners have spoken against him and this
[2:19:03] is what Jude expresses about Enoch but
[2:19:06] we never saw any of these things before
[2:19:08] they weren't in scripture before but you
[2:19:11] know what we take it as gospel now I got
[2:19:13] some I got something for you all with
[2:19:18] that quote that I just read to y'all
[2:19:20] brother branham stand 500 years now I
[2:19:22] told you there if there's he said Enoch
[2:19:24] was here 500 years but the Bible said
[2:19:26] 365 now I say I'm not gonna be here I'm
[2:19:29] not gonna be the one to say him tell you
[2:19:31] and argue with you that that that
[2:19:32] brother Branham was right when he said
[2:19:34] 500 years here's what I do know that God
[2:19:37] shows prophets more than what he shows
[2:19:39] us now I do not have enough information
[2:19:43] to to say whether it was right or wrong
[2:19:46] now what what others have done they have
[2:19:48] deduced it y'all stay with me they have
[2:19:52] deduced it and they said we're brother
[2:19:54] Branham got his information from this
[2:19:56] book called The Book of Enoch hmm that's
[2:20:02] kind of strange because I was also told
[2:20:05] that would you got his information was
[2:20:09] from that same book now I don't read The
[2:20:14] Book of Enoch because I don't believe
[2:20:16] that's biblical right and and here's
[2:20:19] what I've told people is that you can't
[2:20:21] prove to me that brother Branham got it
[2:20:24] from the Book of Enoch you don't know
[2:20:26] where he got it from cuz if God if God
[2:20:29] showed him something a little more than
[2:20:31] what he showed us that's why he said
[2:20:33] what he said prophets see things that we
[2:20:35] don't see Moses saw what happened in the
[2:20:38] beginning Noah saw what happened to his
[2:20:42] his great granddad Enoch
[2:20:44] Paul being a prophet saw
[2:20:47] what happened in that time brother
[2:20:49] branham sir that's what prophecy so I'm
[2:20:53] not here to debate on that I will say
[2:20:55] that's there I can stay with the Box the
[2:20:57] Bible the Bible say 365 years that's
[2:20:59] what I read that's what I'll stay with
[2:21:01] right but I'm not gonna say I also say
[2:21:03] that brother Branham is not a prophet
[2:21:04] because he said 500 years
[2:21:07] look it's been too many things proven in
[2:21:09] his life for me to say he's not a
[2:21:12] prophet can I say this way too many
[2:21:15] vindications too many vindications one
[2:21:21] vindication was a man this this this
[2:21:24] chart that I have here on this wall the
[2:21:27] seven churches did chart brother Branham
[2:21:29] went to teach that chart at his church
[2:21:31] and he teach dit he taught he taught
[2:21:34] went all the way through 1960 went all
[2:21:37] the way through he drew it up like this
[2:21:39] put it on a little whiteboard drew it up
[2:21:41] and put it up you know put the Stars and
[2:21:42] put the the names and all that now now
[2:21:44] now now actually I'm gonna tell you
[2:21:46] something about this chart the chart
[2:21:48] that brother Branham put right on the
[2:21:52] chart that he put let's see if I can get
[2:21:54] this yeah on the chart that he put he
[2:21:58] like he listed all these names here but
[2:22:01] when he got here to this his chart he
[2:22:03] left it as Elijah he left it as he liked
[2:22:07] it that's where he put Elijah right
[2:22:09] there right there that that's what he
[2:22:11] put Elijah
[2:22:12] now which Elijah I just went through the
[2:22:15] scripture with you right in Matthew 17
[2:22:18] which he lodged with you're talking
[2:22:20] about because the Spirit allowed to come
[2:22:21] five times according to the Bible but I
[2:22:23] don't have time to talk about all that
[2:22:24] today I'm I'm gonna get out of here in a
[2:22:26] little bit but but he pretty logic now I
[2:22:29] had this chart done by one of the
[2:22:32] brothers in the church I say brother you
[2:22:34] work at Kinkos would you just do this
[2:22:35] chart for me and I gave him the way
[2:22:37] brother Branham gave it to him
[2:22:38] gave it does he put Elijah that's what

[2:24:58] everybody knew something special about
[2:24:59] this child growing up and hearing the

[2:26:28] Christ dr. Betsy I ain't got time for
[2:26:33] your questions bring them down here so
[2:26:34] now he knew he was wrong right there cuz
[2:26:37] if you go if you can if you can apply
[2:26:38] them seven compound names in the Old
[2:26:40] Testament then it shows that he's the
[2:26:42] same yesterday today and forever you say
[2:26:47] well you know what this this dis debate
[2:26:49] is over it's over
[2:26:51] and he said well Lord
[2:26:56] they say he said he say um he said this
[2:27:00] debate is over and says he says uh he
[2:27:03] says if brother Branham want to come
[2:27:05] down here and he want to face this dis
[2:27:07] audience he can do it he's on his own
[2:27:08] it's up to him said brother Branham got
[2:27:11] out the seat he was sitting up in the
[2:27:12] balcony and he walked out now now I need
[2:27:15] to tell you when you're going listen to
[2:27:16] this this tape and you hear him say this
[2:27:19] on the tape he'll say 500 angels was
[2:27:23] walking with and and I heard they don't
[2:27:26] want even 500 people in the building
[2:27:28] that night but he say 500 angels what
[2:27:32] does he see that the others are not
[2:27:34] seeing oh you remember the Prophet had
[2:27:38] that to pray and ax the ax God to open
[2:27:41] and yellow man's eyes give him spiritual
[2:27:44] revelation because without it he will
[2:27:47] perish glory to God say when you walk
[2:27:50] down there then they start taking
[2:27:52] pictures of the platform start taking
[2:27:54] pictures and when they went to develop
[2:27:56] all the pictures and this one preacher
[2:27:57] you know doctor best he got his hand
[2:27:59] underneath brother Bosworth you know
[2:28:01] face you know like this what kind of
[2:28:04] preacher is this right but he he he
[2:28:07] sitting there making mockery making fun
[2:28:09] and all the pictures that they took that
[2:28:11] day only one picture came out and it was
[2:28:15] a picture that had a light over brother
[2:28:18] Branham vindicating that this is the
[2:28:21] same pill of fire that led the children
[2:28:23] of Israel out of Egypt that same fill of
[2:28:26] fire that Paul saw on the road to
[2:28:28] Damascus that same feel of fire took a
[2:28:30] picture with God's prophet one was over
[2:28:34] shoulder one I think over his head and
[2:28:36] with the one being over his head what
[2:28:38] does that show is that he's under the
[2:28:41] authority of Almighty God God don't take
[2:28:49] his picture with everybody
[2:28:54] they took that picture and put it in
[2:28:56] Washington DC oh that's become a problem
[2:29:00] she might have told me that that brother
[2:29:03] Branham says in the hall of critics in
[2:29:04] Washington DC and there is no building
[2:29:07] in Washington DC called a hall of
[2:29:09] critics so I'm leaving the message I
[2:29:15] said they that that's one if that ever
[2:29:19] came across my way it would be problems
[2:29:24] and the reason would be problems because
[2:29:26] I went to Washington and I saw the
[2:29:29] picture myself that it's hanging right
[2:29:33] there in Washington DC it wasn't in the
[2:29:36] Hall of critics but it was in what's the
[2:29:40] name of that place brother Library of
[2:29:42] Congress and let me tell you you do not
[2:29:47] decide that you're gonna walk through
[2:29:50] the doors at the Library of Congress
[2:29:52] without going through extreme security
[2:29:59] so it's there those that don't know that
[2:30:03] is there and that have left a message
[2:30:05] over that I'm telling you you can
[2:30:07] scratch that one off your list if you go
[2:30:09] to the library Congress is there god
[2:30:13] vindicated his prophet can I just read
[2:30:16] one last quote now I'll leave for the
[2:30:19] day I promise all right this is going to
[2:30:24] come out of the revelation of Jesus
[2:30:27] Christ and I'll read paragraph 34 1 and
[2:30:29] 34 2 so when we have true revelation the
[2:30:33] gates of Hell can't prevail against us
[2:30:34] but we prevail over them over them
[2:30:37] look at this says oh how we need
[2:30:41] revelation by the spirit church and if I
[2:30:46] could I could stand here and I could
[2:30:49] talk and I could you know these are
[2:30:50] things that that God showed me just
[2:30:52] thirty years and I wasn't born in this
[2:30:54] message I was not born I was born
[2:30:56] Baptist I was I was out if it was if it
[2:31:05] was the will of the Lord I would have
[2:31:07] stayed that
[2:31:08] and about this time I long mm-hmm
[2:31:14] feel like one dinero y'all yeah that's
[2:31:21] that's where I'd be going right now yes
[2:31:24] that half sum up yep I have them on the
[2:31:26] organ Rick come on Whitney y'all y'all
[2:31:30] don't fell asleep in here but I'm still
[2:31:32] preaching I start singing my sermon and
[2:31:37] most of them have to sing because they
[2:31:39] ain't got nothing to say but I wouldn't
[2:31:46] I wouldn't die the way God showed me
[2:31:48] this message pulled me out of the
[2:31:50] Baptist Church and showed me it is and
[2:31:52] look when God showed it to me it was
[2:31:55] individual it was individual and and and
[2:31:59] what I had to do is look at it from a
[2:32:01] scriptural standpoint you giving me
[2:32:04] scriptures I'm gonna read it
[2:32:05] Malachi 4 right I just gave you one out
[2:32:09] of Matthew 17 revelation 3 revelation 10
[2:32:13] their script is all about this message
[2:32:16] coming to us in this end time and when I
[2:32:21] saw it in Scripture that's when I can
[2:32:23] say okay that's that's God and let me
[2:32:25] tell you something jesus said my sheep
[2:32:28] hear my voice and a stranger they won't
[2:32:32] follow and I just start following this
[2:32:34] message because I heard some strange
[2:32:35] voice I start following because I heard
[2:32:38] the voice of God oh how we need
[2:32:41] revelation by the Spirit we don't need a
[2:32:44] new Bible we don't need a new
[2:32:46] translation those summer very did this
[2:32:49] is what happened but because people
[2:32:50] can't understand I remember you know a
[2:32:52] certain gentleman he was a /
[2:32:55] witness he said the the these in the
[2:32:58] house in the dust isn't and all that I
[2:33:00] can't even understand that so I just had
[2:33:02] to go get me another Bible now why does
[2:33:05] that everybody else before you could
[2:33:07] understand it and now you can't
[2:33:08] understand it it's because God didn't
[2:33:10] give you spiritual revelation you didn't
[2:33:12] get into the spirit of what you read you
[2:33:14] were looking to try to find a way to get
[2:33:16] out so now we got all of these different
[2:33:17] turpitude and I like can I tell y'all
[2:33:19] something you know I used to read the
[2:33:20] amplified
[2:33:22] I used to used to used to because I've
[2:33:28] noticed people got all these different
[2:33:29] bombs come and I and I really catch that
[2:33:30] so I need to catch it over here and I
[2:33:32] got this one I got the message Bob and I
[2:33:33] got this like you've got a wife Saudis
[2:33:35] different interpretations that you're
[2:33:36] reading Cassandra is missing the
[2:33:39] interpretation right you've given up you
[2:33:41] can end up lost because of that
[2:33:43] interpretation stay with KJV but I used
[2:33:47] to read it but what I found out is that
[2:33:49] there was a woman very smart woman thank
[2:33:53] God for her wits but there was some
[2:33:56] group of men the sauce mark this woman
[2:33:58] was and they got to hide her and say why
[2:34:00] don't why don't we we use you to write a
[2:34:02] different Bible for everybody and you
[2:34:05] know you tell us what you think it mean
[2:34:07] and you write it well she's the one that
[2:34:09] wrote the amplified version the Bible
[2:34:11] I'm not going with a man just what
[2:34:13] somebody think it mean I want to go what
[2:34:17] God said me so if it started that way
[2:34:20] with an amplified version you start if
[2:34:22] you just look at the front of your Bible
[2:34:23] where it come from who was behind it you
[2:34:27] get it or you get a quite a good
[2:34:28] understanding as whether you can trust
[2:34:30] it or not I trust the King James Version
[2:34:33] for a King James Version because that's
[2:34:35] what the Prophet used all right oh how
[2:34:38] we need revelation by the Spirit we
[2:34:40] don't need a new Bible we don't need new
[2:34:41] translation though some are very good
[2:34:43] and I'm not against them but we need the
[2:34:46] revelation of the Spirit thank God we
[2:34:48] can have what we need for God wants to
[2:34:50] reveal his word to us by his Spirit it's
[2:34:56] gotta come by a spirit that God began by
[2:34:59] his Spirit to give us a continuous life
[2:35:00] given a prevailing revelation oh if the
[2:35:03] church could only get a fresh revelation
[2:35:05] I like that if the church could only get
[2:35:09] a fresh revelation and become by it the
[2:35:12] Living Word manifested we would do the
[2:35:14] greater works and glorify God father
[2:35:20] eight years ago I want to say I preached
[2:35:26] this message spiritual revelation and I
[2:35:30] remember that day a man the day that
[2:35:33] spoke it you know God does things
[2:35:35] certainly at certain times it just stays
[2:35:37] with you but I remember i was telling
[2:35:45] Telesis that you know she had come to
[2:35:47] church that day too that preached this a
[2:35:51] man and and went so I remember remember
[2:35:56] Sister Sister kimra you know she was
[2:35:59] here the first time I preached this and
[2:36:00] when sister camera showed up about two
[2:36:02] weeks ago the church that was a
[2:36:06] confirmation for me she didn't realize
[2:36:08] it but that was her that was God's
[2:36:11] confirmation to me that I was supposed
[2:36:14] to preach this again I went back over it
[2:36:18] you know this uh this this week and said
[2:36:20] when I preach them up eight years ago I
[2:36:22] preached it I went back over and when I
[2:36:24] preached it the first time I didn't
[2:36:26] preach it nothing like this nothing like
[2:36:28] this but I know God a man had purpose
[2:36:32] for this for us to take this journey and
[2:36:34] I trust that you will catch spiritual
[2:36:37] revelation if you don't get nothing else
[2:36:39] get that because the gates of hell can't
[2:36:42] prevail against that it came prevail
[2:36:45] against it don't fight it yield to it
[2:36:51] yield to it look at the Bible can you
[2:36:55] know Jesus Jesus would tell them you
[2:36:57] know they had promised earth they'd say
[2:36:58] search the scriptures they are they that
[2:37:01] testified me and I'm telling you search
[2:37:04] the Scriptures I'm giving you certain
[2:37:06] scriptures just look at those scriptures
[2:37:08] read over those the last script in the
[2:37:11] book of the in the Old Testament
[2:37:13] prophesied it would happen
[2:37:15] the last chapter last verse said we'd be
[2:37:19] living in this day right now and we're
[2:37:21] here alright church spirit revelation
[2:37:26] that's what we need let's pray
[2:37:31] father we've taken this journey and I
[2:37:37] know God some things Lord me it made me
[2:37:42] kind of go a little bit over but uh you
[2:37:45] told us to look up and ask you for we're
[2:37:48] not trying to go over we're trying to
[2:37:51] bring it right into the heart right into
[2:37:54] the heart of people the hour is so late
[2:38:01] time is so short and Ghana and we don't
[2:38:07] want to just go through the motions we
[2:38:12] want to we want to be real and God I
[2:38:16] don't want to just be a hearer of this
[2:38:17] word I want to be a doer of it my prayer
[2:38:21] is that you would bring revelation fresh
[2:38:24] revelation into the hearts of all your
[2:38:28] people God speak speak Laurent if you
[2:38:36] could make this thing clear to me and
[2:38:38] coming from a Baptist background
[2:38:40] Pentecostal background I've walked
[2:38:42] through all of that but when I came to
[2:38:43] understand this word Laurent the Bible
[2:38:48] became a new book for me Father and I'm
[2:38:54] just so grateful that you would open up
[2:38:57] my understanding the very purpose of our
[2:39:01] existence on earth today
[2:39:04] Raptors should have come a long time ago
[2:39:06] but the reason that we're here still is
[2:39:09] because somebody has not come to
[2:39:12] recognizing who you are in your word
[2:39:16] today
[2:39:17] I don't know Lord I don't know if this
[2:39:21] would be the last message that some will
[2:39:23] hear I don't know that God but I want to
[2:39:25] do the best I can to get truth to the
[2:39:28] people the Bible says we'll know the
[2:39:31] truth
[2:39:33] the truth will make us free have you a
[2:39:38] God in every heart it's in the mighty
[2:39:45] name of the Lord Jesus that we pray amen
