all i mention it try to do this tonight is actually first friday night amen and typically first friday night of uh every month just i encourage everyone just in their homes and we used to come to the church and do this but we have a tape tape that we try to listen to from the prophet um and i believe the title the sermon was believers thou this it was the last sermon i think he preached it six times and um and it was the last one that he preached in 1960 on this day before to 1960. we won't do that tonight but i'll encourage you and man as you're going through this weekend it's about an hour-long tape and i i guarantee you'll be blessed by it if you'll uh just tune into it and just listen to it but a real blessing amen uh for your spirit and i was listening to it today and my god just the presence of the lord was just in the car uh as i was just listening to it and you know just uh just thank god for the anointing on the word of god amen so just want to remind you that don't forget we'll be streaming our services those that have not done so we ask that you please do so move to twitter amen we no longer have periscope we're now on twitter and uh if you just go to uh spiritual truth uh t at spiritualt you'll find us there on twitter facebook sat tabernacle you can find us streaming there as well as on our church website uh www spiritual truth tabernacle dot org our services will continue until tomorrow night a man will start at 7 pm on tomorrow night rather than 7 30 we're going to start a little earlier and then on sunday morning we'll have a sunrise service on sunday morning at 7 a.m we typically do a seven seven a.m prayer but we won't do that this this time it'll just be a seven a.m sunrise service and uh and after that sunrise service our regular service will be at 10 30 a.m and don't forget uh coming up at the end of this month we'll have brother solomon hoffman uh from north carolina he'll be coming down to minister and uh be with us uh and uh he'll be coming for friday night uh april 23rd and then also uh sunday april 25th he'll be ministering for us so just keep that in mind and also for our giving uh we have multiple ways that you can give those that are in the sanctuary you just put your offering in the uh the wooden box that's on the table um those that are online you have you can give either through paypal or cash app uh cash app is dollar sign speeder2t paypal make sure you choose the option of give to a friend or family member and um and just send make sure you send it to the email address of giving at john423.org if you want to mail an offering into the church we certainly appreciate that the address is there on the bottom of the screen for you to do that recently i was uh sent a little message by a i guess i could call him a friend but um he uh he helped us kind of get some things working here for our when we were doing wednesday night teaching and the way that we were able to kind of push it to uh periscope and he kind of came in and got all this software configured for us on the computer and everything and and um i i ran into him just through volunteering while he he was while i was working at the church there he came through and was volunteering he said i just want to do something for your church so he come and he got everything off configured and i said well man i certainly appreciated him and for some reason he's just taking a liking to us he listens to the services when he can and he moved from here out of wellington up to north carolina and after he kind of blessed the church with getting everything set up god blessed him with i mean a really good job but a great company called cisco and he couldn't find no work at all but when he did that little thing for the church just like god just opened up the doors for him and uh and he went and he got this really good job got promoted on the job so every once in a while he'll just reach out to me and say yeah i just feel like sending something to the church well we'll we will receive it amen he said i just got something in my heart i wanted to send it to the church and uh you know and just just recently he just just sent something to the church you know i said well since you're in north carolina if you just want to use either cash app or or uh paypal it'll be easier and he said okay i'll use paypal he just sent his little i shouldn't say little be sent a nice offering amen to the church and i just thank god for uh people that just believe in what we're trying to accomplish for the kingdom of god i i i appreciate it and and you know brother troy may mention this on last night and and i'ma repeat it you know there are people that you will never see walk through these church doors uh but they'll make it to heaven because of what they've done to the bride you'll never see them walk through the church doors but because of the small thing that i mean the bible says that he he remembers even a cup of cold water god don't forget nothing and uh so there's people that you'll see that they'll make it to heaven they'll make it they'll have eternal life because of what they've done for the brides that's that's powerful that's powerful you know you just got to think about that you know but but uh but i tell you uh we just thank god for for giving us favor and blessing to say man in that way um uh i have a um a praise report here that i want to mention amen um and then we'll have a word of prayer and um good to see sister smiley amen here tonight my sister man good to have her here amen uh this is a a a praise request uh from sister tina says thank god for a good report from my co-worker regarding her stepfather uh he's awake and the doctors asked him some questions and he was able to answer all of them so god answers prayer hallelujah we we looked for miracles amen at the junction and we just prayed over this request last night and we gotta we got the answer already that that that god has already moved on it so uh if if i were you and i was going through something i would i would grab a hold of a little faith god if you can do that for him what about me amen i know you won't forget about me god amen so we thank god for for that praise the lord um before we um now i got i got a a list of songs i mean i i mean specials that's supposed to be for this weekend and i know some things have changed a man um just a number of things have changed but uh i got i got sister bernice on my list tonight says beneath you have a song that you'll be able to share all right thank you sis let's have a word of prayer amen and then we'll have her come amen and she'll share um her song let's pray father we we thank you for this time that we're able to give we ask that you would use this for the furthest of your kingdom again we thank you for those that have uh blessed through giving father uh not even regular members of the church but lord they they just have a heart to want to do something for us i pray that you give back to him a hundred fold and i'm just sharing one testimony there's so many others lord that can be shared [Music] just move for god by by different ones that would just feel in their heart just to write a check and send it in lord even in the mail sometimes we're just surprised at what comes in the mail and it's just you it's just you god and i pray that you would bless the people as they give lord from their hearts may you just return it back a hundredfold it's kind of like that woman that was told by the prophet bake me a cake first it says when you bake me a cake first and your cruise that oil that you have just that little bit you have it it won't run out if you bake me first bake me a cake first and that meal that you have that barrel that's reached this bottom it won't run out if you just bake me a cake first lord we're seeing this happen for people so we pray god your blessings will be upon each one god i mean you continue to uh lord just use this ministry for your glory for your honor we love you we praise you and we thank you also for this testimony of this co-worker stepfather who was touched lord through prayer and able to able to respond to the questions of the doctor we just prayed for last night you proved that you are the same yesterday today forever and your god that answers prayer we thank you for it father it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the lord let's ask our sister bernice amen to come at this time um she will share with us we certainly thank god amen for for these gifts that god has given us amen we thank god god bless you all day long i battled in satan's domain he tried to tell me that my body was wrecked with pain [Music] he told me the rest you don't need to go today but when i think about my blessings ain't no devil gonna keep me away i couldn't hardly wait till the church doors open till the singing and the shouting and praying began i couldn't hardly wait as the holy spirit starts to descend sometimes i don't even feel like singing a song with all of the pressures the press in me is gone seems like the cares of this whole world try to get me down but when i think about my blessings to the minister steps forward now when i come to church i come to worship my god i'm glad to see that you came to worship with me let me tell you now i have a need i know he'll mean it tonight i couldn't hardly wait till the church i couldn't hide away steps forward by the holy ghost spirit spirit hallelujah god get hollywood to the church doors open amen appreciate that sister bernice glory hallelujah my god my god amen well i tell you what i think it's time for the word of the lord to come amen and and i'm uh privileged tonight a man to invite our precious brother kweku to the pulpit hallelujah we were praying a man some time ago and we've asked the lord to either raise up help or send some help here to the church and um you know there's a few that got raised up right here in our midst and we're certainly happy for that and then the one that here's one that was sent to us and testimony was brother kwaku came all the way from texas you know some of y'all just you might not know too much about him but he's originally from ghana but he served in our military the u.s military and he served in texas and i was there connected to church but he wanted to go to school he's actually in school to become a pharmacist i believe praise the lord and uh you know and um so he wanted to go to a school that he could get in kind of you know get through the program a little fast and and he got he said he saw school in florida and just i'm just taking school didn't know anything about whether there was a church here or not and he uh he got into the school and one day he's at school and um and he's he usually goes to a certain spot to eat every day and this day he decided not to go to that spot he went they i guess they were closed so he went somewhere else when he got there he saw this sister sister amanda was there and um it says um he said she looked like one of us and uh he said i gotta just talk to her so he went up to her and said sister how you doing i'm doing fine you go to church yeah what's the name of your church spirit and truth tabernacle you go faithfully yeah so he says you know he had to get this last question in before she left before she walked away so i got to get the clinching question in and he looked at it and said who's your prophet and she looked at him said william marion brandon say i want to go to church with you glory to god and come to find out when he got the address to the church come to find out he had an apartment right next to the church and didn't even realize it and uh so god had him there and you know he come to church and sitting in the back for i think the first two weeks and uh he made himself very comfortable after that he said i ain't sitting in the back no more see you got to watch it see what happens people start in the front they start going towards the back when you see that pattern they only way out the door hallelujah you want to stay close to the fire so uh brother brother kwaku comes up close to the fire and i remember a few few years ago when i heard that he was a minister because he just came and sat here didn't tell us he was a preacher none just sit here saying amen to the word when i found out that it was a preacher i said well brother you know we had brother smiling and preached that night and i said brother to give 15 minutes we'll give you 15 minutes just to share it and uh he says okay and and i was i was really wondering is he going to be able to stop at 15 minutes you know and brother brother quick would come up and he dropped this thought and handed the mic off to me in 15 minutes i say well this is a brother that i can trust hallelujah right and uh and i've been thanking god for him being here ever since amen that time it's been a few years now but he's been a blessing here to the church and we're so happy to have him here in fellowship so let's stand to our feet let's welcome brother kweku ohini oh faith see that brothers brother smiley you got that

motivation before the warriors go in the lord is good amen shall we bow our heads down and have a word of prayer father of life we thank you for this day we give other glory in honor to your name for you alone deserve the glory we thank you father the lord upon all the universe we are be we are the fortunate one to have you in our heart we are very blessed to be the tabernacle of the living christ we thank you this day lord for what you're doing this hour spiritually physically father and all that is going on your eyes is fixed upon your chosen father we bless you for our predestination we thank you for the portion of the gospel given unto us from adam to the last one father we believe that we've got the most most plentiful and most bountiful of the gift of christ the holy ghost and its manifestation in our midst lord father lord jesus christ we've come one more time our sons and daughters to have conference with the father of life father you are not far from us you live right in us we live in you one time when you were here on the on this earth you made a very significant statement he said one day you shall know that i am in the father the father is in me and i i am in you and you are in me that is the oneness of christ and the body of christ father this our lord we are here heal the sick set a captive free give us liberty let the gospel go forth lord jesus christ and bring the purpose for the gospel to pass lord jesus if there's anyone who doesn't know his or her position in christ let today be the hour of decision and awakening and awakening unto them lord jesus we pray our pressure brothers and sisters father streaming online lord jesus christ bless them bountifully give them their portion lord and give the desires of their heart lord jesus christ to their prominence lord father to control over the four corners of the building take control every spirit that is not your spirit destroy it lord jesus christ and speak your oracles lord father let the pillow of fire take control let your manifestation further be so random and rampant in our life lord jesus we thank you for what you did uh was it tuesday lord jesus and lord what you did yesterday lord father trooper troy oh lord we're still feasting and feeding upon that lord jesus we thank you for what we what you use father brother smiley brother jack and brother all the brothers lord jesus christ that stand here father it's not a vessel it's christ in them that makes the difference father we bless your name lord jesus christ take all the glory for your name and magnify your name in jesus christ then we pray amen god bless you and let's give a clap offering unto the lord amen the lord is so good blessed be the name of the lord amen we want to just speak on a topic called easter the conservation of life amen easter is the conservation of our life and we want to find out we want to read how there's been so many easter eggs in the bible the bible is full of easter of course cavalry is the if we say after cavalry it was the most significant of all the easters but there's there's been more easters amen we want to go to the book of genesis which our prophet said genesis the seed sits chapter or the seed word of the bible amen whatever you see here on earth you can trace it back to genesis whatever is going on or whatever go go on you can find it right in the book of genesis so you want to see how easter started in the book of genesis then if you can the lord will help us we trace it through and see what easter we are going through right now amen blessed be the name of the lord let's take the book of genesis chapter one and let's read from one to five genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to 5. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth so that is talking about celestia and earthly creation verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god move upon the face of the waters now let's look at verse two and the earth was without form anything that doesn't go to form is what dead amen it doesn't speak it doesn't manifest any form life form if you put it in a simple term it didn't have any life form so it was dead and darkness was upon the face of the deep where darkness rains death rings but the spirit of the lord moved upon the face of the waters what are the waters the seed of god where's brother troy in the mind of god but are smiling they taught us the seed of god brother choice uh was it yesterday he said we should look beyond what his eyes the five senses will tell us let's go to the sixth sense let's go to the eternal sense that sense of eternity the sense of jesus christ the eyes of the lord and we can see past circumstances amen so god had some waters which is the seed you and i waters represent multitude of people in the scriptures so the god look upon the people that he wanted to plant he look upon you that someday you'll be born right here in west palm beach somewhere in the u.s somewhere in africa wherever you were born south america and be pleased right here amen so the lord was looking up to that yesterday was nothing on the face of the earth and verse three god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness that was separation verse five and god called it the light day and the darkness called night and the evening and the morning where they first day god bless you you may take your seed so that was the first easter that god had in the bible easter simply means you can break it into pieces death barrier and resurrection constitute easter amen if you go to the greek where they have different words terminologies they call easter spanish people call it pasqua that is death barrier and resurrection and of course we know that easter if you want to move from genesis to the time of jesus his main purpose was to come and celebrate easter working of easter to die to resurrect and to sorry to die to be buried and to resurrect so that he can show that the life that was in him was conserved life cannot be destroyed amen glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah now let's go to a science has got the law we want to break certain things down science has got a law which we call the law of conservation of energy and the same law is used in thermodynamics the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be destroyed nor created but it can be transformed from one form to another energy cannot be destroyed nor created but it could be transformed from one form to another if you go to the laws of nature they call it mata cannot be destroyed in other in other words as a human being you can crash this computer you can break ice you can turn water from the liquid form to solid form you can even heat it till it vaporizes goes into the gaseous form but you haven't destroyed it all that you've done is you have transferred or transformed it from one form of life to another form of life amen glory hallelujah and that is what easter is all about changing the life form from one form to another for a perfect expression glory hallelujah and then the second law of uh thermodynamics just alludes to the first one that is all about conservation of uh energy that energy can be transformed they use it from heat energy uh kinetic energy potential energy let's say for example potential energy is energy a body process by virtue of his height so this this mouse has got a potential energy it's static it's not moving but when i drop it it begins to pick motion so it changes from potential to a kinetic energy and then when it drops on the floor it dissipates it could change into different forms of energy mechanical energy it could be harnessed into doing something it could change to different forms of energy it can splash into pieces yes you have not destroyed it it's just changed from one form to another amen so the life form in you nothing can destroy that life in you no death no sickness no coronavirus no nothing can destroy the life of jesus christ in you amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord so we want to just establish the basis of how the energy or the life form that brother troy taught us yesterday that was in the mind of christ before the foundation of the world that life is you and that life is just changing from one form to another now before you came on this earth before you were conceived in your mother's womb before you became a life-form in your father's loin you were somewhere amen you want to look at adam and us how the life form is transfer transformed from one form to another now let's look at adam when adam was created adam came in a different form we know adam didn't drink breast milk he didn't drink any formula he didn't come as a baby he didn't come as a toddler he came as a full grown man around let's say 25 to 30 years of age roughly 30 years of age because the first adam and the second adam were just the same thing but different manifestation the first adam the second adam started his ministry at the age of 30 jesus christ so that was where the first adam started amen when he was here on earth so he was a full grown man around 30 years of age now the difference between adam and you is that adam came as a spirit and then he's put the life he's put the existing element but a troy onto his flesh as we are here they are spread around jesus christ is here how many have got the holy ghost what is the holy ghost jesus is a spirit it's a life it's a literal life of almighty yes you can see with his eyes and that life is here but then that life is being templed or tabernacled by your earthly sistine element amen so now adam he came on earth yes he couldn't manifest with the earth he couldn't express himself because the celestia life form is of another form and the earthly life form is of another form now this earthly life cannot go to the celestial dimension it can temple the celestial dimension but all it can do is earthly however the celestial life form can come on the terrestrial life life form but its manifestation will not be seen effectively until it picks cystine element of calcium potassium sulfur cosmic light x-ray whatever you have in your body ion then he can manifest as an earthly being amen so adam was on earth he was the first one the lord asked who go for us who want to start the redemption redemption story adam said lord i will go say how are you going to go i will break the life form from the celestia and then transform it into a territorial life form and the lord said go my son so adam came in that you funny form and because he was the bible said that adam was what god upon the earth what does god do he's got a creative power he's got a spoken word ability he can speak this into creation so adam just spoke just by thought the flesh system element cluttered on his body he became a human being and the bible said then he became a living soul amen he had the nature of the earth he was already a celestial being he was already a theophany he didn't need it eternal life he was a tenor was it yesterday brother troy said that uh the reason why we struggle here because our life is heavenly and we are trying to lead earthly life and i think brother villanueva said the same thing that we were heavenly to begin with and we are trying to work this earthly life which is not our original life so we kind of find problems here and there amen so before we drop here before you became brother troy you wear brother troy somewhere amen before we came brother jack earthly you were able to jack somewhere amen in the eternal dimension which is right here but in a more faster dimension amen so adam called his earth onto his skin onto the celestial body and i don't begin to manifest begin to drink water and the bible said that the lord was pleased because his thoughts and his motive has begun to unveil by his first son adam speaking life into his own body creating his own flesh because adam is god on the earth other means red earth earth that has got blood who's sitting in the body amen we've got a lot of earth here they don't have blood in them by your blood your earth and my earth element has got blood circulating our body so adam is red earth when he spoke element into his body now we came on a different pattern we our party we didn't come with a spirit first we bypass to bypass how many have used bypass on the on i-95 if i bypass the speaker that means the speaker should be here for me to bypass it i can't bypass okeechobee when okay it's not here if i buy past okeechobee then i have to okay we should be somewhere here in my periphery in my terrain but instead of going to okeechobee i bypass it and go to military trail or go to i-95 so for adam for us to bypass our few funny the theophany has to be there for us to bypass the few funny amen so the three fan is a tenor amen it didn't begin when adam was here you finally didn't begin when you had the holy ghost it's always been here it's always been in you amen but you didn't know so we came as earth first and when we were born in the we were in our father's gym our fathers transferred it to our mothers and they conceived us went through that night nine months of pregnancy with vomiting and nausea and what have you the sisters know it then we drop from the from our mother's room onto the earth now when we were in the womb we didn't have life we were just operating upon the life form of your mother her pulses her nutrients what her view her blood circulation was running through you but then just before you drop the almighty send a spirit around your mother it didn't matter who your mother was she could have been the most wicked woman but that life form made your mother sweet just before you drop now when you drop that life form dropping to you and you became a living soul amen glory hallelujah glory hallelujah to the lord adam was a living soul he came first with a spirit with the original and spoke the earth into creation onto his body now we came with the flesh and then the the spoken with the theophany came to us at the right time at the breath and we didn't know that you funny until the holy ghost baptism quicken your mind to let you know that brother smiley but a quick who sister erica you work before the foundation of the world you are not just an earthly person you are not just an american you are not just a dust but you are eternal person amen you came from elohim you are an elohim elohim is in you and when you live here you go back to elohim because elohim has always been in you amen glory hallelujah amen blessed be the lord so the life form is the same life whether through adam through us in the same life eternal life now the lord jesus christ came also on another pattern glory hallelujah now we have a life adam as we know he came he brought the celestial face on earth then he's put the terrestria onto his body covered the uh the the celestia with this teresia we came with the teresha the 8th man 16th element then the celestia sorry the celestia yes move into us amen now jesus christ came in between the two jesus christ was the original life he was the great eternal he was the el ella elohim he was el shaddai he was the jova rapha he was the omnipotent he was the almighty he was the all in all he was the source of all life he was the i am who i am he was the center of everything he was the divine operating system he was all in all you can use thousand years you can't finish describing him he's more than description we try to describe him amen now he came he picked the two adam and i were following it and came in between because we wanted to breach the two amen so he came with the original just like adam came with the original but then he came as a human being amen so when he came he was born as a human being he drank breast milk he was circumcised on the eighth day he cried like just like any baby christ he might have headaches and fever and whatever cold chills and everything he had to even there was a time that his life was in danger he couldn't help himself as a baby so joseph his foster father and mary had to take him and run away go to egypt that was almighty god in the baby form he couldn't speak for himself he was helpless as perfect human being a perfect baby so that he can feel your infirmity as hebrews said that he is a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity he couldn't understand if he has never been sick before you can understand a sinner if you have never been born a sinner before but because we are born in sin shaping iniquity you can you can i mean what you call it you can understand somebody going through the same thing because you have gone through the same thing before amen so the lord has to become a human being be born a baby be tried just like you and i tried upon the earth he went through the wilderness of all the trials you can think about all the demons religious spirit do you know the the greatest demon the highest form of demonic spirit it's not the demon that scared children that tell the children that oh in the night there's a escape crew some no that's not a demon it's not a demon that gives cancer no that's just a crap a craft form it's not a demon that just kill somebody no religious demons are the highest form of demons because they are the closest religion they have a form of religion religion means a covering they come in the form of christ yesterday antichrist yes it is the devil so in jesus time the trial that he faced wasn't trust about drinking and smoking and fornication and adultery and divorce and those trials his trials were the religious spirit amen who wanted to kill him because they could see the life they knew he was almighty god they knew at the back of that of their mind they wouldn't say it in public they even say his name they told them don't say his name we don't want to if you hear the name jesus you and your family you're going to die but would regardless of the trust that he went through he overcame all of them so that he can stand in a place for us amen and make intercession for you when we couldn't make intercession for ourselves amen so he came in the two to bridge the lost and they found together to bring us our sons and daughters of god in a full manifestation amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ let's look at easter let's go let's use um let's go back to job how job went through a form of easter glory hallelujah remember easter is death barrier and resurrection and sometimes the lord will allow certain things to come to your life to bring the attribute to bring you understanding remember in the bible the lord told was it jeremiah wanted the prophet to go and lie by his side for how many days however long he should only sleep by one side and then turn on the other side he told him to go to the cabin depot's house he wasn't a potter he didn't want to trade to learn that tree to become a potter but he had to learn a life form he had to learn something so the lord told me to go to the potter's house and see how the portal weaves the earthenware vessels there was a sermon like brother troy told us yesterday the person that he hired to fix his bathroom he was watching this man laying the the tiles and whatever and looking at how it's going to the sink to make sure it was the right thing the lord was giving him a cement right there in the bathroom in his house so whatever you go through it might not be fun it might not be pleasant but the lord has a sermon for you amen glory hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord so we know the story of job job went through easter jew was a right the most the perfect man most perfect man on earth but it appears that children didn't walk working job's way bajob knew he was a man of god he was a man god spoke face to face lip to lip eye to eye and he was a perfect amanda please god but not all the children wanted to walk in the way of job so the bible said job made intercessions for them in those time they had to slay lambs and sheep and what have you so joe was always praying for them and it looks like the children live life partying if you read what the prophet told us let me read something from here blessed be the name of the lord there's nothing out of kata the lord knows everything amen and he made provision for you and all your loved ones regardless of what amen you cover them let's read something here from um [Music] the message i think fellowship right let's look at um the message fellowship okay let me go back give me one second blessed be the lord let me read okay let me read fellowship by redemption first before i go to fellowship 550403 fellowship by redemption paragraph 148 now god has confidence in job he had fellowship with him and he knew that job could trust him so he said all right satan you go on he's at your hands but do not touch do not take his life you can't do anything else so satan got satan good at his office i want us to know this satan is good at his office if the lord permits him he's going to try you to the last call so away he goes and he kills all jobs children he said now i want you to notice a lot of things you kind of had a pre-thought of that i believe do you notice when his children all of them got together one day they had a great big banquet there is where you usually get in some trouble going to those big parties all right so the prophet just broke it out brought a banquet then he made it more modern language they go for partying club clubbing go to dance all night with the men and the women you know drink and what have you so-called good times that's where death lays the devil painted as life but it's actually death undercover remember policemen that record under cover cups they can come in plenty you wouldn't know he's a policeman during the insurrection there were some of the police people who were avia agent who were there they were just like that part of the the trump is so called but they were undercover police taking pictures they didn't know they were wearing clothes they were even wearing the same clothing like the people right so undercover is something which disguises himself so the devil is an undercover he comes so sweet so lively so pleasant and beautiful so appealing but behind that action is death amen but there's a life the life of jesus christ which is more far greater than he that is in us is greater than he that is in the world so job knew that his children do not walk in his way they love to party they don't want to go to church when job is at the tabernacle praying the children are on their way running top speed you know doing whatever they wanted to eat for it to be modern times but then job always made sacrifice for them prayed for them went on his knees for them and there was a time as the professor he knew that something could happen to the children so he was careful and always making intercession and we know that we know the story one day when the lord permitted satan to try job he tried him to the fullest as the prophet said satan is good at his job whatever the devil is doing he's not doing on his own the lord permitted him to do that whatever comes through your to your life comes to me if the lord doesn't permit it nothing can touch touch you even jesus when was that uh is if one of them was the name one of the um they took him to the uh was the name not pharaoh pilot thank you sarika pilot uh hall he said i've got a part to release you tell me your story he said you don't have no power unless the holy ghost in me allows you you don't have no power over me and i said daughter of god nothing cancer sickness coronavirus nothing has power over you unless the spirit in me allows me to die through that then that's that's the point that's where i'm ordained to do it beside that nothing can take your life you can walk through coronavirus canaverals can walk through you you can be infected you know even know that you are infected and being healed amen for he that is in you is greater than he does in the world amen because you've got a life form you've got a mission here on earth and nothing can stop that mission until you fulfill those missions glory hallelujah so when job children die and you know everything went sour everything went south for job but the lord the sacrifice that he made the praise the the offerings that job made spoke for job and job didn't know easter he knew a portion of easter he knew two-thirds of easter death barrier by the third pool of easter job didn't know the third pool was what the resurrection so job said that oh look a man a man dies and the children will be crying around him or her the man doesn't notice so he didn't know about resurrection and the lord used his own children to teach him about resurrection glory hallelujah amen so when his children died the bible said that the lord restored all that he he lost twice his sheep he had i think seven thousand got fourteen thousand seven double double double double double double double but his children glory hallelujah the children were not doubled he restored exactly what he had to them to him amen now let's see the kind of restoration that lord gave to job now when the bible said the lord restored his children it didn't mean that the children were if the another children were born then they would have been different children and the bible also didn't teach pre uh reincarnation let's see who will die and we could come back and leave be born again no not even jesus christ he was born died once he can pick his earthly flesh and use it but he's not going to be born by mary again no right the prophet said we passed through this place once you wouldn't even like to come twice after that you want to be a celestial body you want to have your spoken word body but you don't want to have the blast system in you you want to use the theophany because this place is our inheritance when all is said and done this is where we're going to be amen this is our inheritance right here on earth amen we have the authority over the element of the earth the water the earth the fire and the air we can speak them into existence i don't have to take a jet plane to africa you can just speak and you can appear in africa and speak and appear back here if it becomes necessary that spirit that authority is already in you if it's not necessary the lord will give you money to buy a ticket to go and preach to go to wherever you you go to but when it becomes necessary that maybe for whatever you can have a jet plane and the lord wants by the job to go and preach in australia zimbabwe but i smiley if you want to go to london you just appear in london and the brandon said how did you come here really you didn't call us to pick you at airport how come you are here he said i'm a spoken with son of god i'm spoken with the daughter of god i can speak myself into creation amen and this has happened before in the bible new testament what's the name stephen philip thank you when it was necessary philip didn't have vehicles on the highway and the lord needed him to preach at a certain place after baptizing the ethiopian eunuch he just by by thought he just opened his eyes and he's just where he needed to preach that power is in you glory hallelujah and that is our easter glory so let's see the restoration that lord gave unto job let's go to i think fellowship yes fellowship 6006 111 b paragraph 23 the message fellowship 60 60 0 6 11 b fellowship 23 so now god begin to restore back to job he restored his stock his animals livestock and everything double but did you notice about his children god restored restored back to job's children restored back those children didn't say he doubled them but he restored them to him wonder where they were at did you ever take a thought of that and read the book of job they were in glory waiting for him because he had offered a sacrifice under the shed blood and he knowed where they were waiting for him under the shed blood now he never say he gave him back another bunch of children but he restored a guard job's children to him because they were waiting for him under the shed blood of the sacrifice amen when when the lord took your children to glory job thought that was the end because the children were vagabond kind of vagabond disobedient children but they had a serial representation regardless of their earthly life form the skin was what he saw but the spirit in them was jacob the skin the outward form is nothing good to look at but the seed is jacob amen they have representation before the foundation of the world if you don't see them here at the altar don't be troubled keep making sacrifices for them if you never see them here sitting here aiming brother jack don't be worried keep your sacrifice keep praying for them keep covering them they were before the foundation of the world amen glory hallelujah amen they were before therefore amen before they became vagabond they were a seed of god and nothing can cheat their predestination they cannot change their predecession regardless of how far they are gone they can make you sad they can make you break down they can make you sorrowful it doesn't change their predestination they have a seat they are too funny is before the father above amen the skin will be looked like jacob sorry esau but the seed is jacob it's israel amen glory hallelujah to the lord amen [Applause] so now when the lord opened job's eyes in a vision he went into a vision he thought the students were gone he wasn't going to see them no more not in this life or their life to come and one day the lord opened job's eyes and he saw all his seven children oh my goodness his beautiful daughters i think seven sons and three girls jemima kezia karen and whatever yes and you scream he said though the whims eat my flesh this flesh yet in my body in my flesh i shall see my maker this earthly man the sistine element can go down but me job the real me i'm working with my children on the other side and joe came back screaming and shouting and yelling hallelujah to the lord because he saw himself with his children and his wife and all the loved ones at the other side of glory amen nothing the law of conservation of matter says energy can be transformed from one form to another but it cannot be destroyed the devil cannot destroy your children the devil cannot destroy your heritage the outward look will not change doesn't change previous nation amen they are sons and daughters of god and you speak life to them speak life in them and like i said if you don't see them even sitting on the pew with you don't be bothered their names were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen glory hallelujah it doesn't matter it could be the 11th hour the lord will let them know who they are amen you could even be the time of pardon the i mean going on the other side the lord revealed himself to them and they will know that they are sons and daughters of god glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord and that was one of the eastest job hadastah when he had resurrection uh death barrier and resurrection his children died they were buried but he saw his children at the other side in their theophany not as parting children they were no longer going for party and clubs but he saw them as celestia under the altar under the lamp of god under the bloody altar remember that time the lord hasn't come down calvary hasn't come in yet so they were all waiting for calvary to be taken to the celestial dimension to uh today heaven itself amen now let's look at another easter glory hallelujah to the lord that was uh let's read john chapter 11 at the death of lazarus martha and mary lost their brother as we will call it dear brother the only brother who was a breadwinner in the family died unexpectedly and it was chaos confusion and everything seemed to be gone in the family and they had only one hope jesus christ they invited him to come and pray for him he didn't turn up he waited until he died that's when he showed up what kind of pastor is this a pastor who does not turn to the needs of your church members when they need you to pray for them but we have to be led of the lord amen the pastors are not led by men they are led by the lord amen you might want them to be here at this time you might want them to do this but they have a master in their heart if the jack's master doesn't let him to do what you need to do you might probably call him ten times he said sister i'll be coming since i'm praying for you but brother jack i need you to come and pray for me come to my house since i'm praying for you and you might not understand why because he has a master in him who has authorized him to go pray for you or to pray for you from his house or even not to pray for you because the master wants your faith to come up because the healing is in you and the master doesn't want by the job to pray for you he wants you to receive your healing from within out and then come to the tabernacle and talk by the jack in the church what the lord did for you so sometimes the lord can put a jack aside and then deal with you directly and speak to you that the healing whatever you need is in you and you believe it and speak amen just like martha and mary glory hallelujah to the lord let's read uh john chapter 11 verse let's just read for the sake of time glory hallelujah let's read verse 25 and the 26 and you can read the rest of the story let's read from 20 please i think we can do that 20. john 11 22 26 then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and meet meet him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou would ask god god will give it to you let's look at martha's face this is so interesting i love this this i think that jack taught us probably a year or two ago and so martha had confidence in jesus and said lord i know whatever you speak the christ in you the almighty in you will bring it to the past so now she used the word now but i know that even now whatsoever that will ask god god will give it to you so 23 perfect faith jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again then sister mata said matter said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so now martha wanted her brother to be to be resurrected right now but now she's pushing the promise in the future and many of us do that futuristic everything is in the future god is not doing nothing now god did something some years ago but now god is not doing nothing what kind of god are we serving let me use food for example let's see can i use for example okay brother goes to visit his uh sister brother but the jack is therica and he's very hungry he's a six-foot person right he wanted some food to eat then he goes derek i i'm really hungry it's oh brother but again we had a wonderful like delicious some delicious food yesterday oh my goodness that food was so good tomorrow we're going to cook that food but since eric i'm i'm almost about to fall down i need something to eat it's oh my you wait tomorrow i'm going to cook i mean the same thing it's going to be more delicious than what i cook so but still come i'm about to pass out i need something oh the food we ate yesterday was so so so good i asked your assistance i asked becky and listen it was so good and tomorrow or next week i'll cook the same food but please erica i need something to eat look at that's what we do the lord did so much the years pass and he's going to do so much in the future but right now no he's a dead elohim is dead he's a living christ he lives in you he lives in me he's the lord of today not yesterday and tomorrow amen we have to bring him from yesterday and from tomorrow and bring him today present and today amen that's why you are here for amen you have to make him a present day christ we don't have to point people to the past the past is good for reference but then when we refer them bring them back to the present that jesus christ is living in me amen don't be ashamed to tell the people that jesus christ leaving with me whether you're a sister or a brother you know who you are i can pray for you i can speak your condition into creation i can speak it out of creation i'm a daughter of christ i've got to say so my father has given me the authority i'm part of elohim and if i speak for you my father in me will listen to me and attend to your situation glory hallelujah to the lord amen blessed be the name of the lord glory so mother so the lord has to do with sister mata a little bit take take her from the future and bring it to the present tense he said so now 25 he said jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believe believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he leave so now jesus brought martha from the past and the future to the present that i am he didn't say i was or i will be but he said i am right now present tense the resurrection and the life in other words i am the easter amen amen i am the easter glory hallelujah i'm friday saturday sunday i'm the easter egg i am the death the barrier and the resurrection yes i die perfectly but i'm resurrected so sister mata said whosoever lived and believed him whosoever liveth and believe that in me shall never die believe it out this right then she caught her to wear her feet brought to where her feet needed to be 27 7 is perfection 27 she said unto him yeah lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god who should come into the world and now the lord spoke his his her brother back into existence from the celestial dimension that life that was in lazarus came back into lazarus and amanda was dead how many days four days resurrected and lived many many many years amen that life is in you the same life that was in jesus of nazareth two thousand plus years ago the same life is in you and you can speak this situation and change it into life you can transform the energy from potential potential is oh yes we can do it oh one day we're going to broken limbs are going to come together one day the lord is going to call his people why are you here the lord hasn't called you what are we doing here the lord has not already called us that was years ago we are already resurrected we are already on our feet we are the body of the living christ christ is manifesting in us every day and every night and so we don't have to put god in the past or in the future but we have to stand as now amen i am that i am i am he who i am i am elohim i am the present day god i speak and creation obey me and the same christ is in you but you have to exercise that authority you speak whatever thou need whatever thou need just speak into creation it doesn't matter how long it's going to come to pass it doesn't time is of nothing the element will put together and create what you need amen glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah let me read one oh my let me read about you one about you one more quotation and i'll be done 61080 at the house and so did you notice after the spirit of god had come upon the prophet and everything got all right you see god restored back to job what he restored back to him where he had ten thousand cattle he had he gave him twenty thousand cattle where he had for forty thousand sheep he gave him eight eighty thousand sheep and he restored everything back to him that he ever had and you notice and restore his seven children he gave job his seven children not the no not didn't give him seven other children but he gave job his seven children now what was it his house thy and thy house because he was righteous because he was standing on everything that god gave him to be righteous or give him was offered that bent offering and he knowed that that was god's word and he could not feel so did you ever think where them children was they was in heaven waiting for him he is with them today and god saved those children they were in heaven waiting for him if the lord saved job's children under the sacrifice of good and booze how much more under the sacrifice of the resurrected jesus christ if the lord gave love mary and martha their only brother loves rose back to them another blood and booze remember when jesus was here until the sacrifice was offered the testament was not in effect yet so until calvary the testament was not infected but now where's the testament it's in full effect now amen and whatever you need you are the resurrection you are the resurrected message jesus christ you are the jesus christ on earth right now don't point people back to jesus christ 2000 years ago yes that is a reference point i always say that whoever comes to christ you have to go back to calvary first because you can't do without cavalry it's just like when a baby is born into their family regardless of what meal the mother has to get some milk he has to get some formula you might be eating all kind of food solid food but because there's a newborn baby in the family there's a need for milk the same thing when a child a son of god or a child of god is born into the family of god that person needs to start drinking milk what do you drink your milk calvary that's your first easter you have to die be buried and resurrected you have to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ confess your sins and the lord will come into you wash you whiter than the snow as brother by the trailers then the lord will take your tabernacle you are no longer the person you used to be you are now jesus christ walking on earth you are not jesus christ all by yourself but you are jesus christ amen let me use brother jack for example but jagdaf says erica is deaf he's she's not deaf all by herself sister rebecca sarah the adapts is that alexander did i get it right yes he's got three daughters the old dab so sister sarah can boldly say that i'm deaf you can't say no no darth is brother jack dave no says i can't say that i'm deaf because it's part of the family so there's nothing wrong to say i am message jesus christ glory hallelujah but the jack is the pastor who stands here to preach sister may never come here to preach she might come here to sing his daughters will come here to sing but it doesn't make them less deaf they are so deaf amen we may not need to die on calvary our father did it on calvary but it doesn't make us less jesus christ amen we committed a little small spoonful uh uh ocean the ingredient that that ingredient in the mighty ocean is the same ingredient in that spoonful if you fetch a spoonful of ocean if you go to the ocean and get just got a gallon full if you go to the lab and test the ingredient the amount of calcium potassium seaweed salt is the same thing in them amen so whatever the big mighty ocean can do the gallon and the spoonful can do whatever the big jesus christ can do when jesus christ take your tabernacle when he takes your tabernacle when he takes my tabernacle you can do the same thing that jesus christ can do amen so we are the resurrected christ we are the easter now i think i preached to 2019 i preached the same on the the easter now what is the istana the present day easter you are the easter i think that was april the 20th and today is april the 2nd we are the resurrected jesus christ walking upon the earth manifesting our father and when he said that we are not telling lies go back to the book of acts chapter eight time whenever let us read it but remember when the soul was persecuted the christians chapter nine jesus christ appeared to him was he jesus christ how did he appear to him pill of fire and he said so so why are you persecuting me how can you persecute people of fire tell me how can you prescribe persecute a person that is dead and gone in heaven because the bible said he was ascended and went to heaven how can you go to heaven and persecute the almighty so where is heaven he said who are you so ask him who are thou he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting so who was so persecuting the church so is the church jesus christ i will go but i'll come i'll be with you emmanuel but i'll be in you amen not just with you he was with apostles but his good word be in you sister brown amen so when you're working you are not just an ordinary sister you are not just sister brown you are not just a virginia but you are message jesus christ you are jesus christ in flesh amen the life that you have is elohim in manifestation you can be a small tiny a bottle of ocean you can do the same thing like the mighty ocean can do you you have the power to speak into creation you have the power to change circumstances you can transform life forms what is energy what is the law of conservation of energy changing one life form from one to another if something is not working you've got the power to speak it and your word is as good even better than the angel of heaven who is who is mightier the angel who sing glory glory hallelujah who cannot see the lord they cover their face cover their feet and they said holy holy holy is the lord almighty he who was a nation is to come and that's all they do holy holy is the lord almighty where is that angel is is it mass no is it another planet the angels are in and around you if your father will open your eyes to see those angels oh my sister you'll be walking you pass through the roof amen if the lord will open your eyes if you have give him attention not that he doesn't want to open our eyes but if we can give him our full attention if you can half a time consecration unto him and say lord i want you to feed me for my heart you are my husband put your life in me i want to see your stimulation of their quickening power my brother my sister you can pass through the roof there's nothing that can stand before you and that's what the lord has made us to be amen that was the chat the alpha church i think jack was the t uh another is that something pentecost he gave a theme of last shakana pentecost is that right amen so the same shekinah that was in pentecost uh 2000 years ago the same shakiness in you and the same thing that they came shivering and like drunk people and five thousand one twenty thousand and upper room got converted three thousand people the same spirit is in you and i yeah and our word is not just your my word and your word but your word is he who lives in you is the word of jesus christ and when you speak creation obey you and it's time to start speaking amen it's time to start putting the word into action more and more just let go and let christ take over don't worry don't let this guy decide for you let this guy decide amen don't let the five senses be your limitation sister mata was looking at the five senses and she was willing and crying i'm not going to see my brother in the last days but that sense the sixth sense came in when the lord came in he said i am the resurrection and life i'm alive forevermore jesus christ is in you and always know that you are not just no matter what situation that you come across go back to the sixth sense don't let the five senses the eyes of singing hearing tasting smelling touching the feeling decide for you but go back into the inner man he that is in you like upon you complaining and crying and he has to go back then the holy spirit in him begin to open his eyes that's the small voice that your children are not dead say but lord i don't see them i want to have fellowship with them and the lord opened his eyes in a glorious land and he stands his beautiful sons in full glory not burning in some hell no but they are under the right under the throne of god not that they are presence or the people of fire they have changed into the pillar fire and when our life is over it doesn't matter how we go we have a pill of fire in us and that pillow fire will cross you that's why we have a prophet even told us how to die death is nothing he said it's like just like a flesh of seeking it's like you spitting a mighty ocean and the ocean will turn into some something you can't describe in any language and before you could say jack you are the other side and you could see the people right here they might be willing around you but you see them your children you see your family you see everything so nothing should scare a son a daughter son and daughter of god because you are jesus christ that's what jesus christ went to was able to go to calvary and die for us because his life form was not going to end at the grief but it was being transformed from the human form to the celestial form in a glorified estate so that he can come back at the chicano glory shakina pentecost and leaving his people and that's what he's doing he's here living in us shall we be on our feet glory to our lord shall we pray eternal father we thank you this hour we give all the glory in honor to your name bless be thy name for your divine presence for your word of life father we thank you for this jubilee for the easter father you've been giving us feeding us lord wed upon word and we know this word do not come in vain father lord may the life form the spirit behind those words the eternal portion the angel of light further continue to manifest as we see manifestation keep lord unveiling more and more looseness lord father from every grip of the five senses and let us follow the lord father the pill of light father take full effect in our lives manifest for your glory bless our dear pastor bless all the ministers father commit tomorrow service into your hands my lord anoint your ministers with double portion triple portions lord jesus christ father to come and give us the word of eternal life we commit our brothers and sisters elsewhere all over the land all over the earth bless them and give them their portion lord jesus christ we thank you tonight for your present for your grace and mercy we give all the glory to your name in jesus christ and we pray amen god bless you amen oh praise the lord let's give the lord we thank god for the word tonight i i have just always uh been impressed by just how the lord uses uh brother kwaku and uh thermodynamics i'm like where where you get these tanks from but um you know energy cannot be destroyed it can only be transferred to another form and uh just tying that into the life of christ it could not be destroyed even even when he left this earth and you know maybe satan thought he had won the battle uh but no no it was got transferred now that same life that was in christ is now inside of us that have the holy ghost is we just need to recognize who we are right and and i just i this is just um even you as a individual can experience an easter you can go through your own death dime to yourself right burial and then resurrection amen i just i just appreciated that and i for years um you know when you look at the the quotes on job's children and there's different uh thoughts on that the way that uh it's been presented like job didn't get his kids but he got just seven more kids but when you really looked at that the way brother brother brother uh uh quake who brought that tonight we see god restored job's children right they were just waiting for him in glory and which was i mean that's just a beautiful they experienced a easter right job had a chance to experience his own easter with his own children and he did it under under the blood of bulls and goats i tell you what i i'm encouraged church i'm in i'm talking i'm really encouraged brother quick who told us tonight even if you don't see him here that's okay just just pray anyway right pray anyway what did he call him she said um uh uh where where i got this date job's children on the outside were esos my god but on the inside they were jacobs and you know and even when you look at that you know because uh esau looked like the right kind of man right he looked like the right kind of man but the bible said uh jacob half i love but esau half i hate it right and then sometimes our kids do things that we hate it's the truth anyhow right i mean their actions their attitudes this stuff that we just hate we don't we're not proud of it but all right we're gonna just apply the blood of jesus amen we're gonna apply the blood of jesus god will take care of the rest of that amen i'm encouraged tonight church i i heard from heaven tonight glory glory glory easter is the conservation of our life god bless brother kwaku amen amen amen amen [Music] okay all right yes that's uh that's a that's a oldie but goody says if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you the song says it shall quicken your mortal body amen you believe that it'll quicken your mortal body amen let's just sing a course or two of that and then before we would leave here tonight amen if that same spirit that raised christ

god amen i want to just remind you uh uh just that the tape believeth out this brother brother kwaku walked right into it uh in his scripture reading tonight and and now you see where brother branham you know pull that from and and just you know you'll see the prophet just bring out some some other things that brother quake was just kind of dressing tonight and i think you'll be blessed by it you'll be really really blessed by it it was a service that brother branham was trying to give up the mic and he said he couldn't figure out how to how to get out he says because it was an eternal virgin you know that he got into so he just couldn't figure out how to get out but the holy spirit just moved on it very very well so i want to encourage you go back and listen to that and it's 1960 the date is zero four zero to nineteen sixty believe it's thou this amen you'll you'll be blessed by it just find some time amen on tomorrow just to take a listen to him amen let's pray father we thank you for god the word that has come to our hearts tonight uh we are leaving this church uplifted and encouraged and as we uh god just just think about the service from last night and then you come back again tonight lord isn't there's an elevation taking place even brother troy spoke about it last night we have to elevate our thinking lord and uh brother kwaku has challenged us in that father to elevate our thinking not to be so worried about uh the child doing this or the child doing that they may they may act like esau's they may do some things that that disappoint us i know he saw the women that he married uh it really brought uh it just really did some distraught to his his parents they were just very disappointed in him oh god and but but lord he said there's a jacob on the inside and sometimes we look at jacob see he even deceived his own daddy god but uh but yet you said you loved him you loved him there was something about jacob that he'd do whatever it took to get the blessing and the birthright so father i just pray lord that our hearts would just be encouraging lord as we're just on the expectation we heard a word on tuesday night that freedom amen was was here it was in the house amen deliverance was here it's in the house and the word of god is coming to set captives free hallelujah i feel lord that the word is having an impact it's going into the depths of the soul and it's making a difference amen the word has a way of changing things just the same way it did in the beginning when you said let there be light god there was there's nothing that could stop that word from changing the situation so lord let the word of god again have spoken change circumstances and situations let it change our bodies let it change the sickness that might be attacking us let the world do the surgery hallelujah father i just pray that you were moved by your spirit and we're leaving here with our expectations rising coming back farther tomorrow night with
