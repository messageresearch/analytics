the service home yesterday and and one of the things that the minister said about her father that that uh it's going to stick with me for uh a while uh but he was talking about her dad and he says um he says um uh there was something that happened in the church her dad dad was a a tambourine player and uh so he would just he would light the church up just with his tambourine playing so he sing a special place it's tambourine and and the whole church just be on fire so one day he he he went out he sung a song Church turned upside down and then they had an event afterwards and they wanted him to come back and sing again bring it again bring that anointing again and when he got there somebody switched something on her daddy and said we're going to have somebody else sing rather than you sing now you know how that happens in in church world and and and and and often times and it happen we get real bitter our spirit and countenance changes right on the spot but not uh Mr Burnham Deacon Burnham and this was before he was Deacon uh they said what he did was hand the mic over to the man that was going to sing took his tambourine and went down to the end of the line and played like he never played before you know what I said to myself I said that's a Christian yes sir that right there is a Christian and and and I tell you just just sometimes you know you you you hear things like that and for me uh I've been feeling you know we we might need to just go back to just some basic teachings on Christianity hello somebody how Christians supposed to act we don't act like the rest of the world we don't do things the rest of the world do we we Christians uh you know we follow the example of Christ he was the ultimate sacrifice so you know what we do also on a daily basis hello somebody I was reading a devotion this week and in a devotion the man said you you want to have joy I said Joy he says yeah you want to have joy and and the way that you live your life he says and what Joy is is it's an acronym for Jes Jesus first others second yourself last if you want to have joy put Jesus first others second hello somebody and yourself last brother brandom teaches these things right so I tell you I I was just blessed by you know hearing you know that that about her father and and it was just a a real uh blessing to be able to go and just hear all the great things about this great man of God and and uh we realize we got sister Nelly from so we thank the Lord amen for that so we thank God God bless you spirit and truth thank y'all so much for for representing amen and doing what you could continue to keep her and her family in prayer also you all know about uh sister Sharda went on to be with the Lord and and the family the ram Ramis family uh so let our prayers uh they have some really big decisions that they have to make so please keep them in prayer uh also you know brother Troy uh with his mom as well continue to keep him prayer sister Virginia

just give me a c can you happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday sister bir happy birthday to you praise the Lord amen some of y'all wonder what who we singing happy birthday to my mama right here on the third rad that's my mama amen I thank God for my mama amen if she wasn't here I wouldn't be here amen and I just thank God for her she's been a real real mother glory to God in every sense of the word you know and uh she just she's one that just has a way of loving us um and when I was coming up just as a young man and I I I won holy all my life amen all my little life I won the best child all My Little Life uh but she knew how to bear with us how to pray for us how to encourage us how to strengthen us and and uh you know just just I think I've learned that um the next love to God's love is the love of a mother amen and and and and i' I've learned this so this why I always try to encourage Brothers don't don't try to come between that a love that a a mother has for a child just don't do that you create more problems for yourself right but you got to understand there's no love like a mother's love you you did not carry that child the way Mama carried that child you then get the connection that Mama got y'all ain't going to say Amen but it's the truth in how you didn't get that God didn't give that to you amen why you think the Bible say fathers provoke not your children why don't say that about mam oh my right that's good we got a preacher today y'all don't want me to preach y'all don't want me to preach [Music] but there's there's a reason that the scripture says that right and uh we got to understand that we don't come between that but we try to support that and we try to you know we try to nourish that relationship amen amen amen praise the Lord so we thank God for Mama today and we wish her a happy birthday um uh take me to Amazing Grace okay that's where I'm at all right we're going to stand and we are going to invite brother Paul ojar

Savior Jesus Christ I have a few scriptures I'd like to refer to today but let's read Exodus chapter 34 together I was really enjoying brother Jack I wish he would have just preached on I thought today I would have sat and enjoyed a good blessing amen Lord amen praise the Lord indeed we're reading from Exodus 34 verse 29 we'll just read two verses and I'll refer to a couple others amen Exodus 3429 and it came to pass oh I'm sorry I'd wait for you to find it amen and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Si with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand when he came down from the mouth that Moses whis not that the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face Shone they were afraid to come nigh him amen the Lord out his blessed L to the reading of his word you may be seated and thank you very much amen I'm not much of a speaker amen I'm depending on the Lord to help me this morning God you know I was just a little bit nervous coming in amen if I give today's little sermon a title I'd like to call it in the presence of his glory amen amen I remember brother Jack Duff from in years ago visiting uh he had sang at brother westco's church that's over 20 years ago and he prayed a prayer and he you know in praying he said Lord your mercies are new every morning great is thy faithfulness I when there those words just struck me and stuck with me since then yes yeah amen your mercies are new every morning you know you read it in the scripture but there comes a time when something really takes a hold of you hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to God sir amen and amen I'd also like to refer to Matthew chapter 17 I'd read it amen Jesus had taken Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as light amen and Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 3 sorry I've got a really big Bible because you know as you get [Laughter] older Glory now the Lord is that Spirit yeah and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty oh Hallelujah Lord amen where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty yes sir Glory but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen amen yes sir amen and amen amen so I'm going to read just a few little things is it okay I put my Bible there okay amen amen as you'd realize my voice is just a little bit horse because I've had a wonderful time the last couple of weeks I visited with brother Simmons up in South Carolina amen we had a couple Services there oh what a wonderful time I've been having in the Lord hallelujah amen and then we were by Brother Gan uh last week a couple services and I'm not worthy of that um that recommendation when when when I was listening to brother I start to feel so broken up in the back there when I heard it because I Feel So Unworthy of that amen amen amen I'd just like to refer to a few little quotes please bear with me amen amen you know there was a time when in the Garden of Eden man living in the presence of the Lord they were so conscious of his presence constantly yes sir amen amen they were so conscious of his presence amen constantly and they were in such fellowship and harmony with God that they were conscious of his omnipotence right amen amen yeah I just like to read just a little bit in the beginning when God I'm reading from fellowship by Redemption 955 now in the beginning when God made the man to worship Him and live God taking care of them fed him man had a perfect fellowship with God now before the prophet says that he said that when God ever takes his position in the human heart all the reasonings Fade Out God becomes first amen you you just heard brother God becomes first Hallelujah when he takes that position in our heart God becomes first and as brother Jackie said others become second and will you become last am amen at brother Jean Jason Tuesday I was in the office and uh just as a little testimony all right and I'm not a very good singer I get my words all mixed up and and I sometimes sing on the wrong key and stuff like that and I was there and I was wondering I said I wonder if they have the words to the song the more that I Surrender and I was just wondering if they had those words and while they in the room I heard the song leader beginning to sing the more that I Surrender the light of the Lord and then I heard a knock on the door because I wanted to sing that song before I started preaching and they introduced me with that song God well you can imagine how I felt amen yes sir and on on Thursday while studying about a couple hours before I just I just felt led to change the whole sermon and I started St in something a in a different way and well the presence of the Lord came down so greatly and and he really blessed our hearts and it's just the grace of God Amen and at the end of the service brother Anie I think is his name he had preached on the Sunday me before and he said did you realize that brother Paul preach the same sermon I preached on Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon wow I was like oh my yes I I felt a change to to change the service and preach on something on a different angle amen and was exactly just confirming the same spirit amen and at brother Simmons is he he said after the two Services he said brother Paul have you been listening to my sermons for the last month I said no I haven't he said well you preach exactly what I've been preaching for the last month amen so I feel blessed in my heart because when I came back you know brother Jackie took me outside and when I came back in the song that you all started with was there is nothing like the presence of the Lord and I was like oh God because yeah I was a little bit nervous wonder what do I say you know and so I just feel a little blessed amen hallelujah amen GL now when God takes his p position right in the human heart then we can find our position amen he's got to have the right position in our heart for we can find our right position amen yes sir now in the beginning man was in the right position God was in the right position and man was in the right position so there was a fellowship there and and man had power within himself that he can speak to the wind it'll obey him amen he can speak to the trees and that tree you be plucked up and planted over there and you have to obey him because man had perfect fellowship with God Amen the word Reigns Supreme in his heart amen amen amen yes sir the the word of God reigned Supreme in the heart of man now when man fell amen they lost their position yes sir they lost that that position that they had with Christ for they had dominion over the Earth right and everything obeyed them right amen that's right but they lost that why did they lose it because they came out from behind the word of God so the word of God is our strength amen amen amen the word of God ought to reign supreme in our hearts yes sir amen the prophet said they didn't know sickness what sickness was they didn't know what old age was they didn't know what hurt was they couldn't be hurt they were in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which held them in control and guided them by his spirit amen that held them and guided them amen they were always Guided by the spirit of God Amen now the prophet says he continues I believe if this little group of Believers this morning and that doesn't only refer to the Tabernacle back there for this is God's Eternal word amen it applies to this little group here this morning also amen amen if everyone could lay aside every thought and get down to the fact to know that the great Jehovah that created you in the beginning is in his position God didn't lose his position it's man lost his position not God the word of God didn't lose its strength it didn't lose its position amen it's man that lost it right and God is still in his position so for us to get back there we've got to get back to our position yes sir and there's got to be a way to get back back to that position amen exactly right yes sir Amen to know that the great Jehovah God that created you in the beginning is in his position placed today here in this Tabernacle yeah that's right that he's bringing it right down to our day at the heart of every believer that's his position right it's not way out somewhere far out and it's right here right that's his position amen he says you believe it I know you believe it right now in the beginning when God come down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day and his great voice whispered to them they had Fellowship loved one another that's another thing Hallelujah when you're in a real position with God your perfect position with God you just can't help but love everybody yes amen amen amen by this shall all men know he are my disciples when he have love one for another when you're following him you can't help but love everybody you love your very enemies also amen amen they had Fellowship loved one another how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the lions come up the Tigers all of them and they worshiped the Lord man was conscious at all times not just sometime but at all times that his presence was with him now that's where we lose a little bit at times we lose the Consciousness that he's still there and we get a little loose at times yes we get a little loose with our thoughts and when we begin to get a little loose with our thoughts we going to get a little loose with our tongues we're going to get a little loose with our actions but we got to be aware of that presence all the time amen amen so the prophet is bringing back us back to where Adam had fallen from amen it's the Holy Spirit telling you and I our position in Jesus Christ yeah where we ought to be amen amen yes sir amen now let's let's go back a little bit after Adam had fallen amen God had provided a lamb amen man was in such Perfect Harmony that they they had a holy Veil over them isn't that the truth they W not even conscious of their nakedness yes amen yes it's only after the fall they realized that they were naked and they're looking to try to cover over themselves but we can't cover over ourselves no sir we need someone amen hallelujah yes sir let's go to Moses a little bit now under the blood of bulls and goats Moses could stay in the presence of God so long and so much amen that when he walked out of that presence now notice this Moses wasn't conscious of himself a glow it was the rest of them was conscious of it Hallelujah and when you get into the presence of God hallelujah and you come out of that presence everybody around knows something took place yes sir I've been in the presence of the Lord everyone is aware that something took place Hallelujah your life has changed your walk has changed your talk has changed everything something took place you cannot you cannot ever enter into God's presence and remain the same yes sir hallelujah hallelujah glory to God yes sir amen hallelujah Oh Glory oh hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to God yes and I see Moses he comes down and and he wasn't aware amen he was in such Fellowship I can just imagine how he enjoy that fellowship with God as a true son oh you just enjoy The Fellowship of the holy spirit amen yes sir that's why you can't wait to get a church amen hallelujah I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord yes sir amen hallelujah oh glory amen I I want to just touch a little bit on Moses amen all right oh [Laughter] okay and done veiling of God he says in type Moses coming from the presence of God with the word of God for that age amen remember Adam and they as long as they stayed behind that word they were safe amen and they were conscious of the omnipotent God yes sir you see God's obligated to his word he'll affirm it you stay with that word he he's obligated yes Heaven and Earth will pass away but not one word would ever fail that's our defense amen so here comes Moses now with the word of God for the age he says now watch we're in Exodus 19 don't miss this now so if he says don't miss it I don't want to miss it Moses is coming from the presence of God Moses is coming from the presence of God he has been he has been in into the word the word has been wrot and he in the presence of God with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age amen now I'm showing you Jehovah of the Old Testament amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever so I'm going a little bit in the past to show you God in Moses dayen amen right right he in the presence of God with the word he had the word for that age there is a word for each age and Moses coming forth his face shined so see the word was in him ready to be manifested give out to the people there's the secret the word was in him amen and ready to be manifested now that's why now he could go and speak oh my the word was in him hallelujah amen hallelujah in his rightful place and Moses was in his rightful place in his position where God had placed him in his day he didn't he wasn't Moses in sorry in Noah's day he was in his day and he had the word for his day amen and he knew his position by Revelation amen now the true word God had wrote it and it was with Moses notice it was with Moses and was ready to be manifested he was the word to them he was the Living Word hid amen veiled him himself Moses had to put a veil over his own face why he was that word all right amen until the word was made known Moses had to Veil himself do you see it wherever the word is it is veiled yes sir Moses had the word now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again Hallelujah the word is still veiled today it's veiled in you and me Hallelujah Yeah the secret is the word is in you that's the secret is in you amen yeah yes hallelujah amen glory but while the word was in him to give out he was God woo amen while the word was in him to give out he was oh my that's not skim milk now that's something real solid that's Eagles food hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen while that word was in him to give out he was God well he wasn't Moses no more wo oh my power that's a real powerful quot amen glory to God hallelujah amen I'm building up to something you know amen hallelujah amen hallelujah he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over had that word with him amen yeah now the natural Veil I'm reading from paragraph 148 the unveiling of God the word veiled in human flesh what was it God was veiled in Moses God was in Moses veiled and the presence of God was in him he was so perfect with that word in him that till he had to Veil his face and it was a Vindicated Prophet that unfolded the word and told them Thou shalt not thou shal Thou shalt not see to give his word to that generation he veiled himself in a human being or the word would have blinded even the called out can you imagine that wo that's real yeah yeah that's a real powerful quot yeah because they were called out of Egypt weren they yes and he had to bail them all they would have been blinded can you imagine you can be in the presence of God so much Hallelujah yes sir yes sir pretty soon I'll get to hour day all right amen amen amen even the people out there they could not stand to see in Exodus we find it let Moses speak not God see why the pillari don't appear too much yeah you see man had was in a fallen State yeah and why it had to be shepherd He said Moses was in the presence of the Shak on Mount Sinai it changed his face notice it just his face had to be veiled right when he come down he put a veil over his face the shepherd Prophet Moses who Jehovah was in in a portion just a portion in his face he had the word in his mouth but notice when the Great Shepherd was in the presence of the shakina I read it to you in Matthew 17 what did it do it changed his whole countenance he wasn't just part of God he was all of God Amen yes amen now let's come up a little bit to our day the prophet out hunting squirrels remember yes sir ain't no squirrels anywhere God just knows how to fulfill his word you see there was a a scripture for this day that needed Revelation yes we needed understanding and who does the word come to the prophets amen right this scripture came back to the prophet it's Mark 11 and22 if you see to this mountain amen if you say to this mountain he says something spoke to him well you know what that something was right amen he said what about a prophets well I I begin to see then it begin to unfold to me what do you think that taken place in the meeting when you're standing there do you think you're the one who knows those people so you're no longer him now come on brother on just like it was no longer Moses then now it's no longer him he said do you think it's you all right do you think you're the one who knows those people do you think it's you that can predict and say those things that's going to do a certain certain thing and a certain certain thing that has happened to you and a certain certain thing will happen to you do you think that's you saying it he said oh my it means so much that'll mean a much yes that ought to mean much to you that ought to mean much to him can you imagine the Lord telling you that's not you you think it's you it ain't you that's me you know how I would feel oh I want him to be so I want to be so full of him I want want him to flow through me that ain't me anymore that's right Hallelujah that I'll do nothing unless it's just said the Lord Paul is completely out of the way now Hallelujah yes sir that ain't ain't me anymore that that ought to mean much to every one of us when he'll say that's no longer you remember when he sees the bride he says she's bone of my bone she's Flesh of My Flesh she's Spirit of my spirit she's word of my word she's power of my power she's life of my life yes sir I want him to say that of me now I could say that about myself that that ain't B to be correct right that ain't about to be right if I'm seeing that about my but when he says it when he says it that means everything yes sir hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah I said surely not Lord It's You amen well do you think it's you talking no do you think it was the prophets talking had not you just got through preaching on the subject that the prophets were so Anointed with the holy spirit that it wasn't them that done the speaking it was the Holy spir Spirit in them crying out then whatever you say if you're anointed wouldn't be you saying it it'll be the Holy Spirit saying it oh Lord anoint us Lord bring us to that place now that place is available to us we want to know how to get there amen well the answer is right there am amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory I said well I thought that's right if the person through the atonement Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with God so close remember we speaking about in the presence of of his glory now a person can live in that sphere amen with the with God so close that he can be wrapped so completely in God by the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it'll be the Holy Spirit speaking these things my yeah and no more than I said that till the anointing of the Holy Spirit struck me like I've never had before in all my life God knows that and I raised up to my feet I got scared and something said to me now this is the beginning of your new ministry now ask what you will and it shall be given to you God was taking him higher and higher yes sir remember in the early in the early meetings the presence and the glory of God would be so great the heal would be the the sick would be healed yes sir but now he's taking him to a higher level now amen when they come in that presence he said don't come in here with sin it'll be revealed amen yes sir glor and now he's taken him to a higher sphere am and you know what took place when he spoke those srels into existence amen when he spoke to that storm sister MAA remember yes sir what could have done that the word was in Moses amen and until Moses spoke it amen that was God there right amen that's right it's no longer Moses Amen in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed the prophet showed us that first Bride In the Garden of Eden had fallen the first son a spoken word son Adam his bride had fallen amen because she did not stay with that word the second Adam spoken with son the Lord Jesus was given a bride and she too fell in the seven Church ages we saw that in the first church age where amen they did not stay with that word but he said this one this one down at the end time that's you and I he's speaking about Hallelujah th never fail that's the word of God this one won't fail hallelujah amen amen he says from that little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin virgin to his word right and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word and in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas yeah the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest Glory yes he will act himself out Hallelujah the word in its right position you in your right position God's going to act himself out amen amen by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accept his word be it unto me as thou has said though it was said by an Angel yet while it yet was the written word Isaiah 9 and6 amen we see Mary accepted that word an angel brought it to her it was the written word and she said be it unto me according to Thy word amen so there is a bride in this day Hallelujah the word has come by that Angel amen and what do we say be it unto me according to Thy word I may not understand it all I don't need to understand it all what is important I believe it all amen hallelujah no my position let that word re Supreme in my heart glory amen am amen and that word will act itself out yes sir GL am he said they will love him love his and will have his potentials glory to God remember Peter had brought to his attention that the tree had wited up right that's right and now Jesus is telling him you you can do this too if you have faith and don't doubt faith in what his word am yes sir perfect faith in a perfect word yes sir he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his notice what Harmony remember they had a Harmony in the beginning they had a fellowship in the beginning we're coming to the middle of the book now the harmony with the father and the son such Perfect Harmony glory to God what Harmony Jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:9 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it have you received it sir that's it Glory she never doubts it that's faith without a doubt she never doubts it amen what is perfect faith faith without a doubt if you believe and don't doubt in your heart she never doubts it she she's got perfect faith in a perfect word yes sir well God will perform his word perfectly through her you know the prophet said that I can't find it right now right amen I said it on brother Jean I read it today amen hallelujah he says now she never doubts it nothing can harm her remember nothing couldn't harm them in the garden right all right nothing can't harm her now oh glory amen not even death Lord oh we can say oh death where's your sting Oh Glory oh grave where's your Victory hallelujah glor hallelujah I feel blessed amen amen hallelujah amen not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen amen here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ all right to know what he wants done with the word you see Moses knew what he wanted done with the word the prophet knew what he want done with the word amen the Lord Jesus knew what God the Father the Holy Spirit wanted him to do because Jesus was just the flesh the body in which the fullness of God dwelt in amen amen not three Gods you know one God it's just God manifesting himself amen unveiling himself tabernacled in human flesh veiled behind human flesh he was veiled in Moses he was veiled in the Lord Jesus and here he is veiled in the bride amen they do sorry let me the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus said the Lord then it is germatize so the Holy Spirit Waters it un until it is grown and serves its purpose they will do they do only his will remember in the beginning Adam did only the will of God yeah they were led by the spirit and were doing only the will of God before the fall well we restored right back now to the blood of Jesus Christ and all that Adam had lost has been restored Lord oh we're living way below our privileges amen we ought to come up a little [Music] higher hallelujah amen then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet amen amen there was a little bit a lot of Through the Ages it was he fulfilling his word Through the Ages amen but there's something special for this day you're a special group of people you know amen now we know better than nobody right it's the love of God towards us amen now what that ought to do to us it ought to make us more humble yes sir I think we've been living I have been living way below my privilege as a Son of God and what I'm thinking is that what I believe is that the holy spirit's trying to get us into a rightful position Moses in that presence under the blood of bulls and goats could come out and shine with the glory of God that he has to throw a veil over his face that's under the blood of bulls and goats the Lord Jesus the fullness of the word he had perfect Faith because he was the perfect word amen amen and he can do all these things and now he's saying you can do it but it's allotted for a certain time and a season and I believe that's the season in which we living in because we've already seen it manifested in the prophet's life and the bride has to be at a certain place for the Rapture to take place and I believe what what I believe is taking place is it's waves of glory and the spirit is taking the people Higher and Higher and they Faith's getting perfected now I ain't what I I ought to be all right I ain't what I'm supposed to be all right but one thing I know I ain't what I used to be Lord and you know what did that was faith in his word that did that that's what brought me out of the a life of sin amen and then he took me a little higher and he's taking you higher and higher and higher but now he's calling us to a fully surrendered life remember this man that could do that and speak and these things happen they were fully surrendered in the hands of the Lord he said that a man fully surrendered in the hand of God it won't be that man anymore so what is it taking he said in present stage of my Ministry sorry speak to this mountain he said this is this is the hour of divine consecrations now it's divine consecrations right you know sometime you feel of yourself or the church kind of woo the people no but this is Jesus pulling you now calling you aside to himself remember is he called up Moses up on that mountain and he was pulling the prophet aside come you got to go west now amen it's a holy spirit it's divine consecrations not just I get a feeling on my self no sir Divine consecrations he said if you can believe the Lord God requires a consecration it's in speak to this mountain he said he cannot break forth upon us until we've been so surrendered to his will Adam did nothing but the will of God before the fall amen remember it's eve that fell right she did wrong she was deceived right and Adam loving his wife he willfully did that right he said he cannot break forth upon us until we've been so surrendered to his will to his power he cannot break forth until we have our hearts so cleansed from sin and things of the world so there's things in my now my greatest enemy is me I need to empty myself of myself yeah and let him fill in there so he'll no longer be me but him yes sir amen he says until the Holy Ghost can ride upon us and so surround us now as he has me right now while he's speaking this the holy H Spirit had him full Supreme control of him glory and what is he speaking the word and he's telling us this is what God is requiring of us hallelujah I hope you caught what I said there will not reach there because this wasn't William brandham speaking here was the Holy Spirit speaking through him he says the Holy Spirit has me now he says how do I know these things it's not me it's him that's speaking I've told the truth about him there is breaking forth something new watch and see it's already happening it'll break forth just as certain as I'm standing in this platform all right be ready for it to receive the Lord God in great blessings and he's telling us to be ready for it how can I be ready for it I got to consecrate myself more a consec Divine consecrations so empty up myself lay in that presence so broken up oh pour out everything out of me Lord amen he said be ready for it to receive the Lord God in great blessings he says you the Church of God Church of the Living God that's you and me each one of you he's speaking to us today let's take this night for this a consecration a consecration to God amen amen hallelujah the message present stage of my Ministry he says how many Christians are in the way tonight in the way tonight amen in here that are happy that you started a long time ago many of you would have started a long time ago and you're still in the way amen he's brought you saved us far we sang am and Grace amen sir he said done made your start and way down along the road still coming down towards the end but we know the end is here it ain't long again friends he says I pray that God will Crown your ministry wherever whatever it is it may be a housewife it don't sound like much of a Ministry does it oh friends that's a great ministry Crown your ministry it may be a housewife I pray that God will Crown your ministry it may be a preacher it may be a deacon it may be a lay member so he's covering all of us here today it may be a farmer I don't know what it is whatever it is may God Crown your life with the glory of his word you see Moses had that word but something takes place when you get into that presence of God and with that word in your heart and you're so empty of yourself and he takes full control amen amen and it's so much in his likeness and so much in His image because we're to be in His image and likeness isn't that the truth we're to be moving from Glory unto Glory he's taking us higher and higher in him we're coming to a place where it'll be the full realization he said that in the church ages amen he says may God Crown your life with the glory of his word and his second coming Rapture you and take you away into another land let me just read this for you in trying to do God a service he says there's plenty of green we type of wheat right he says that's right have to lay the presence of the son s o n to be mellowed up to loose with our tongue at times we mellow up in now yes sir to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst we need to have this in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God moving in his word and showing us the things yeah we've seen it we've heard it we've listened to it we've read it but I think we need to lay in that presence in the presence of his glory to be mellowed up to be sweetened up in spirit because perfect love and perfect Faith goes together yeah love and faith are kin folks faith is based on love yes perfect forgiveness he said faith is based on forgiveness if you follow the scripture and read it down or further if you said it this morning he said if you have ought in your heart against that's right need to mow up yeah we got too much greenness in us there's no problem with the word that's right there's no problem with God the problem is me I'm the problem today I ain't going to say you're the problem I'm the problem I'm the problem Hallelujah GL I need to to mow I need to sweeten up some more so I'm so full of his sweetness it ain't me anymore it's his love flowing through freely through me amen hallelujah I know it's the truth I ain't got words to explain it you got to experience it yourself I know the holy spirit's calling us today to lay in his presence hallu Hallelujah we ought to be such a great big bundle of love you know there was a time when the church you couldn't leave each other yes sir you'd Fellowship out there in the courtyard so long you just couldn't leave each other service go on and on and on and on that's right yeah and you so loved one another you couldn't wait for those doors to open to come back and fellowship again around the word I remember those days when I was really young and we'd end with that song we really would end with that song blessed be the ties That binds and you so loved one another yeah we ought to be so much further down there's nothing wrong with the word he's calling us to Divine consecration come on get into the presence of his glory till we shine with his glory we shine with his sweetness the gospel glows you it's not it's it's it's not glittery and no it glows in humility we become so humble sweet towards one another usually when you come into the Pinnacle yes of the ministry because the Way Up Is Down look at the Lord Jesus just a minute again the same priest that he called you wided walls you Hypocrites Snakes in the Grass here he stands before them now and every false accusation that could throw against him stood there like a lamb not a word he'd say he humbled himself to the death of the Cross he could have defended himself he had all rights to defend himself many of times we want to defend ourselves and we have rights to defend ourselves but when you become a prisoner and you love him so much Hallelujah you give up all your rights you know that my reaction to what you've done your Soul's destination may depend on it my soul destination depending on how he reacted to those false accusations that's right my soul's destination depending on how he reacted it's the same thing today but what how could he do that if you go back a little bit in the Garden of Gethsemane there is where he won the victory so God's calling us to a place it's a time for divine consecration amen time of complete emptying of ourselves power is the man who can conquer himself That's The Power of his power that he saw That's The Power of his power when he said when he sees that bride and says power of my power that's what he saw someone who could conquer themselves amen yield it to the perfect will of God many of us want to speak to the storm right I'd love to I'm honest with you right I'm being honest but there's something that goes with that there's something that goes with that power God character is satanic there's a character that goes with it and that's what he's looking for that's what he's looking for that's what he's coming back for amen hallelujah he's calling us to Mellow up a little bit amen hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah and the invisible Union of the bride of Christ it's an invisible Union taking place right he says I'm asking the bride the prophet now said say I'm asking the bride bride of Jesus Christ I'm asking the bride tonight the ones that I feel has pulled away and waiting may they separate themselves from everything in the world they must lay in the presence of the warm sun light of the Son of God bathing in his word amen in love he says granted dear Lord praise God that was a prayer he was praying this Prophet knew how to ask and believe you already receive what you've asked for amen yeah yes sir so I'm I know that prayer is going to be fulfilled and I'm putting myself in there Hallelujah I'm putting myself in that word Lord I'm that one he's saying hallelujah that separate myself from everything of The World God and laying in that presence of that warm Son of God his light amen laying in that word bathing in his word remember he said I pray that God would Crown you Crown your life with the glory of his word and lay stay in that presence there and here he is just revealing it just seemed like something just flicked on in my life recently yeah I was living way below my privileges for far too long I said no no I couldn't flick that switch on I couldn't do that somebody did it because I was willing to yield myself more cast all my cares on him with carrying along too many things trying to solve too many problems of myself not realizing that I was the big problem to begin with you see sometime we think we become a Christian you're saved you're filled with the Holy Ghost you already made it we're in a battlefield friends and you got to learn to surrender yourself you got to learn to surrender to his will you got to learn to surrender his every word and you got to realize this is the guy you're fighting with the most when I realize that this is the guy I've been fighting with the most thinking I'm so right when I'm so wrong and you know something even when you're right you got to take wrong that's one of the hardest things to do especially us man oh my I'm honest glory to stay quiet and silent but if you really get down on your knees friends and get into that presence with God amen and a to empty yourself there yes empty yourself out so much you become so weak remember that song that sister sign his strength is perfect when all strength is gone woo become so weak I can't even walk anymore it ain't me walking anymore Hallelujah I want to be so weak that I it's no longer

him to speak to our hearts um I pray church that we don't allow sermons like this just to kind of go over our heads God is coming to speak right where we right where we're living and uh just the the quotes that he was using um just I felt like the Holy Spirit just really orchestrated and directed all of that especially that this we got the mellow out it's talking about how we just get you know and he he never pointed his finger at anybody he kept pointing himself pointing it at himself like I got to do this and if a minister can come behind the pull pit and say this is what I got to do what about the rest of the congregation our righteousness is as filthy rags before God and how we need more and more and more of him and you know just even my my own thoughts this week one of the thoughts that came to me was um you know uh beloved let us love one another amen for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love and see when I talk about the basics of Christianity these are the things that we used to hear in church years ago and it kept us mellow sometimes we done got way ahead so we need these deep things to inspire you know just intellect but we missing just everyday life I I just appreciate the word of the Lord today and I'm so glad that God could come and just cleanse us and wash us and and this is a sermon you can go back and just listen to over and over again and amen we we need to come to this place of divine consecration Divine consecration Lord don't let this just go over our heads but let us really meditate on what is being spoken to us what we heard here today yeah I I I'm grateful brother Paul God bless you thank you so much for coming Amen to speak to [Music] us blessed be the name of the Lord amen and as you were sharing about the testimony going there to brother jeans and wanting to sing that song the more I Surrender uh Our Song leader was telling me said that's the song he had in heart to bring me out on today the more that I Surrender so God knew exactly amen what he was doing this this was orchestrated and ordained by God Amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen good to see sister Melissa and the kids amen God bless you amen praise the Lord continue to keep her in prayer amen um they they certainly are need in our prayers and like I said just we just seemed like we had a little wave here hit the church uh back in 2015 uh we went through a situation where a wave of saints that we lost amen actually in the church uh but um you know this time we've lost a couple in and then a couple on the outside but nonetheless everybody seem to be going through this season of grieving amen at the same time but God uh I am convinced because I've seen him do it is able to take your morning and turn it into dancing amen I I that's the god that we serve so amen I'm just believing that he's going to bring confidence strength amen uh to each and every one of us through this season amen I know it's not easy amen but I know God is faithful and I know that I know that he's able I lost uh my biological father and um you know the the man that I called daddy amen he was my stepdad but I I didn't know nothing else but Daddy because that's what he treated me like was a son uh but I remember losing them both in a in a matter of 30 days 30 days they were both gone and uh and my B my my uh my my stepdad uh uh brother bur amen that's dad to me uh losing him right in the heart of December right before the holidays it was a little difficult for us but God gave us strength and and one of the things that God gave me out of losing my dad it gave me my brother it gave me my brother and and I'm and I'm grateful for that see life always comes out of situations like this so amen just be encouraged Church be encouraged and you know one of the things that blessed me so much I remember you know when Dad was uh taken from us and just where my brother was but when I look back amen after the years and to see him stand there and eulogize his own mom I said man what a mighty God uh we serve what a mighty God we serve so it just blessed my heart I know what God can do in moments like these so I want to encourage you all just take strength take courage man he promised never to leave us nor forsake us amen and as long as he's with us we're going to be all right believe brother brother brother OJ he even read the the the quote he says not even and that was a a not just the prophet saying but the angel told the prophet to pick up your pen and write and he began to write things the angel told us that not even death not even death would defeat us amen even in death we have after Victory we look death and I say death where is your stand grave where is your Victory we serve the Risen Savior amen praise the Lord he proved to us through his resurrection there is life after death amen hallelujah praise the Lord let's give the Lord another hand of [Applause] Praise two

presence of his glory god and we realize amen that mankind at the very beginning Lord as they they were so conscious of your very presence Lord we want to draw closer to you it seems like the world is throwing so much at us through our jobs through our uh through schooling uh Lord so so many things that hit us that it just feels to take us from your presence we can never get enough of you so Lord you lay this Sermon On Your servant's Heart Lord to bring to us and just to remind us that it's going to take Divine consecration in order to be able to get back into the presence Lord we going have to push some things to the side we're going to have to lay aside some sins and some weights that so easily beset us God these are things that we can't ask you to take from us but we have to be willing to lay it aside so father I pray that you would help us Lord to to meditate on the word that has been spoken you didn't send your servant this way God just by happen stance or chance but Lord you you had a direct word from Heaven specic specifically for us and we pray God that our hearts would receive it we would walk in it we rejoice in it we would live in it on a daily basis we pay pray your blessings upon your servant God bless him as he returns back home and we just appreciate him being able to pass this way father we ask that you give back to him as you've given to us bless his family as well God is our prayer Lord the church back bless them Father is our prayer We Trust Lord Jesus that you watch over the Saints and keep us Lord until we're able to come back together again on Wednesday night Lord and may you speak once more to our hearts we give you all the glory we give you all the honor we give you all the praise it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God richly bless you uh you can be seated amen the brothers will come to dismiss you amen [Music] for [Music] o [Music]
