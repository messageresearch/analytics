[52:43] amen uh the Bible says by faith
[52:49] Abraham when he was uh called to go out
[52:53] into uh a place place which he should
[52:57] have to receive for an
[52:59] inheritance obeyed and he went out uh
[53:03] not knowing whether he went by faith he
[53:07] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[53:11] strange
[53:12] country uh dwelling in Tabernacles with
[53:15] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[53:19] the same promise uh for he looked for a
[53:23] city which hath found ations whose
[53:26] Builder and maker is God Amen uh let's
[53:33] turn over here to 1 Corinthians chapter
[53:37] 2 and uh we'll catch it at verse
[53:41] 9
[53:42] amen
[53:45] hallelujah
[53:47] um the Bible declares
[53:51] but as it is written I haveth not seen
[53:56] Nor Ear
[53:57] heard neither have entered into the
[54:00] heart of man the things which God hath
[54:04] prepared for them that love
[54:07] him uh but God hath revealed them unto
[54:10] us by his spirit for the spirit
[54:13] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[54:16] of God uh for what man knoweth the
[54:19] things of a man save the spirit of man
[54:22] which is in him even so the things of
[54:25] God knoweth no man but the spirit of God
[54:29] uh now we have received not the spirit
[54:32] of the world but the spirit which is of
[54:35] god that we might know the things that
[54:38] are freely given to us of God which
[54:42] things also we speak not in The Words
[54:45] which man's Wisdom teacheth but which
[54:49] the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[54:50] spiritual things with spiritual amen the
[54:54] Lord a blessing to the reading of his
[54:56] word shall we pray father we are
[55:00] grateful for the privilege and
[55:02] opportunity we have to gather in the
[55:04] house of the Lord we are grateful for
[55:07] the anointing that has been here through
[55:10] the song service and through the
[55:12] specials uh we uh appreciate Lord all
[55:16] that has happened and now as we prepare
[55:18] to enter into uh the word of God for
[55:21] today we trust that the spirit would
[55:23] take control over every thought not just
[55:25] the thoughts that are being presented
[55:27] but the thoughts that are also being
[55:29] received uh we pray father that um every
[55:33] spirit that is against your spirit would
[55:34] come underneath control of the Holy
[55:36] Spirit even right now and uh Lord we
[55:38] just ask that you look upon the saints
[55:40] that were not able to make it out today
[55:42] uh pray that you give them strength and
[55:44] we also uh heard the prayer requests
[55:46] early for brother Reagan uh family the
[55:50] Parker family they're preparing for a
[55:51] service today God we ask that you would
[55:53] just go before them in strengthen them
[55:55] and help them uh during this time and
[55:57] God we pray that you would carry them is
[56:00] our prayer in Jesus name we pray amen

[56:16] amen
[56:20] amen we uh certainly thank the Lord
[56:26] um just uh be here and I want to take a
[56:30] little thought uh this morning I I call
[56:32] it a little thought we'll see how far we
[56:34] can get in it but uh we want to uh
[56:37] preach on the city uh whose Builder and
[56:40] maker is God Amen the city whose Builder
[56:45] and maker is
[56:47] God and um I have been um you all are
[56:52] aware that I I typically teach
[56:55] on uh Wednesday
[56:57] mornings with a a group of brothers and
[56:59] we we teach through the Book of
[57:01] Revelation uh something that started and
[57:03] and uh so I've been just kind of I I
[57:05] think I jumped in starting at Revelation
[57:07] chapter 3 and and now I'm uh up into
[57:11] revelation 22 and just been I think I
[57:14] I've already accumulated about 184
[57:17] lessons uh through the Book of
[57:19] Revelation and um and I just finished
[57:22] the whole series there in uh Revelation
[57:24] chapter
[57:25] uh 21 and so it's just kind of been in
[57:29] my heart just to share a little bit I
[57:30] think I probably took about 12 or 13
[57:32] lessons from uh from that chapter and I
[57:36] wanted to start bringing some of it to
[57:37] the church and um you know so I'm kind
[57:41] of uh jumping in in in in in a place
[57:45] there I'm not really at the beginning
[57:47] and uh kind of almost at the end but I I
[57:50] think I'm going have to go back and
[57:51] bring yall some of the things from the
[57:52] beginning but uh nonetheless let's just
[57:54] just kind of let's kind of you know try
[57:56] to get on the scene uh I I'm going to
[57:59] start here with a quote out of future
[58:01] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and
[58:03] Earthly bride uh the first thing well
[58:06] let's let's just let's Coast let's go
[58:07] with this amen the future home of the
[58:10] Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride
[58:12] says this uh notice that Jesus said in
[58:17] John 14 now says going to prepare a
[58:21] place says oh what will it look like did
[58:26] you even think now bride what it will
[58:29] look like so Jesus going says he's going
[58:31] to prepare a place but what will it look
[58:33] like he says he says it is uh prepared
[58:37] and designed by the Divine uh architect
[58:43] what will that City look like now I'm
[58:45] going to talk about it for a few minutes
[58:47] the Divine architect has prepared it
[58:50] designed it and look he designed it with
[58:53] tender hands for his beloved bride uh
[58:57] what's it going to look like could you
[58:59] imagine a man marrying a wife that's
[59:03] able how he builds and puts everything
[59:07] every little thing justs exactly to her
[59:10] touch just what she' like amen now you
[59:14] know I I I like that because uh here
[59:17] here in um in in in in in West Palm
[59:19] Beach over in see this is called West
[59:22] Palm Beach where we live but on the
[59:24] other side a bridge amen it's called
[59:26] Palm Beach and uh and there is a there's
[59:29] a story you know there's a a u um a
[59:33] museum that's there now it's called the
[59:35] flagin museum but uh this Museum or this
[59:39] it actually was a house that was built
[59:41] for a man when he was getting married
[59:43] you know his wife uh he was going to
[59:46] give a gift to his wife and she said you
[59:48] know what I would like to have is a is a
[59:50] little Cottage By the Sea and uh his
[59:53] wife said I want a Cottage By the Sea so
[59:54] this man went and built a 25,000 sq ft
[59:58] home and called that his Cottage By the
[1:00:01] Sea as a gift for his wife Hallelujah
[1:00:04] now if that man could think to give his
[1:00:06] wife a Cottage By the Sea and make it 20
[1:00:08] thou 25,000 Square fet what you think
[1:00:11] God thought about
[1:00:14] usall if you ever get a chance to walk
[1:00:16] through amen flag Museum and that's just
[1:00:18] the mind of a man doing that for his
[1:00:21] wife and thinking about every detail
[1:00:24] that he wanted give to his wife but but
[1:00:25] for us God has God has also thought
[1:00:27] about every detail that he wants to give
[1:00:29] us every little thing you like God going
[1:00:33] to have it there oh I don't I I I I I I
[1:00:36] tell you the truth I'm looking forward
[1:00:37] to every little thing you like God going
[1:00:41] to have it there amen for the prophet he
[1:00:43] had a horse he had a dog you like a dog
[1:00:47] you like a god going to have it there
[1:00:49] every little thing you like God will
[1:00:52] have it on the other
[1:00:53] side
[1:00:55] amen the quote goes on say now the
[1:00:57] Divine architect has designed a new city
[1:01:01] where he will with he where he will live
[1:01:04] with his bride just to her
[1:01:08] touch no wonder the Apostle said Eye Has
[1:01:12] Not Seen ear has not heard or neither
[1:01:15] has it ever entered the heart of man he
[1:01:18] says let's see if we can probe into it
[1:01:21] just for a moment see what it's going to
[1:01:23] look like the divine architect has
[1:01:25] designed this for his beloved see oh
[1:01:28] what a place it must be when divine
[1:01:31] nature Divine architect has designed it
[1:01:33] for a Divine attribute that's attribute
[1:01:36] that's been divinely predestinated by a
[1:01:38] Divine God who is the Au of a Divine
[1:01:41] Life what will that City look like think
[1:01:44] of it he goes on a little further he

[1:10:39] says and
[1:10:40] Abraham saw the cities of his day ER of
[1:10:45] Chala and he knew that because there was
[1:10:48] something in him calling there was a
[1:10:51] city that was different whose building
[1:10:53] and maker was God and God seeing that in
[1:10:57] Abraham told him separate yourself now
[1:11:00] come on out now I want to just uh pause
[1:11:03] here amen and just kind of talk about
[1:11:05] some of the requirements for making it
[1:11:08] to this
[1:11:09] city amen one of the requirements for
[1:11:12] you to get to this city is that you're
[1:11:13] going to have to separate
[1:11:16] yourself hello somebody amen you you
[1:11:20] going to have to come out of some things
[1:11:21] by yourself things that you've gotten
[1:11:24] yourself involved in you got to come out
[1:11:27] of it amen different people that you're
[1:11:30] hanging around you got to separate
[1:11:32] yourself from those people Abraham left
[1:11:34] everything behind yes sir in order to
[1:11:37] find the city whose building make it was
[1:11:40] God Abraham left everything behind you
[1:11:42] going to have to do the exact same thing
[1:11:44] Abraham
[1:11:45] did come on somebody you can't bring uh
[1:11:48] you can't bring the world with you not
[1:11:49] in this city you can't bring the things
[1:11:52] of the world with you as you're going on
[1:11:54] this journey you got to leave these
[1:11:55] things behind and at some point in time
[1:11:57] you got to cut off that
[1:12:00] friendship if you want to go to this
[1:12:03] city come on somebody he say he says
[1:12:06] told him separate yourself now come on
[1:12:08] out all right he says um now Abraham one
[1:12:12] thing I want you to notice he obeyed
[1:12:15] God's word to the
[1:12:17] letter that's what we going to have to
[1:12:19] do obey God's word to the letter always
[1:12:22] remember that that's my message you must
[1:12:24] obey the word anything contrary to it
[1:12:29] leave it alone it may look good but
[1:12:32] don't reason against God's word amen
[1:12:35] that's the first thing Satan did was
[1:12:37] reason against God's word to eat and she
[1:12:40] and she never doubted it she just
[1:12:41] reasoned Satan reasoned it and that's
[1:12:44] the way they do today isn't it
[1:12:46] reasonable that we should do this isn't
[1:12:48] it reasonable if it's against God's word
[1:12:51] leave it alone it's the the voice of
[1:12:56] Satan anything going against God's word
[1:12:59] you got to leave that thing alone and
[1:13:01] you have to make the choice that I'm
[1:13:02] going to separate myself from this I'm
[1:13:06] going to follow God's word that's what
[1:13:08] Abraham did that's exactly what we have
[1:13:10] to do as the children of Abraham this
[1:13:12] next uh sermon here and thy seed shall
[1:13:14] possess the Gate of his enemy amen the
[1:13:18] prophet tells us uh but now but when you
[1:13:20] have separated yourself from the things
[1:13:22] of the world and I like that because
[1:13:24] often times our prayers is God would you
[1:13:26] please deliver me from this and God
[1:13:28] would you please take this away from me
[1:13:30] and God would you please do this and and
[1:13:32] God just sometimes looks sits back and
[1:13:34] he looks at you and says no what about
[1:13:36] amen you laying aside every sin and
[1:13:39] every weight that so easily besets you
[1:13:42] the reason that we pray that prayer we
[1:13:44] like to try to put it on God he just
[1:13:45] ain't delivered me
[1:13:47] yet no that ain't God's fault God want
[1:13:50] to see how much you love him are you
[1:13:51] willing to lay it down
[1:13:54] amen actually if he tells you in the
[1:13:57] scripture to lay aside every sin and way
[1:13:59] that means he has already put the Power
[1:14:02] inside of you Amen to give that thing
[1:14:07] up
[1:14:08] hallelujah what if I was to say you can
[1:14:11] answer your own
[1:14:13] prayer just by giving it
[1:14:17] up all right amen when you separated
[1:14:21] yourself from the things of the world
[1:14:23] crossed over that separating line and
[1:14:25] are sojourning in a Strange Land a land
[1:14:28] like you wasn't in uh in the beginning
[1:14:31] with the people that you never
[1:14:32] associated with in the beginning then
[1:14:35] you become a spiritual
[1:14:37] Jew look at that look at that it said uh
[1:14:40] the same way that Abraham by faith left
[1:14:42] his country left his people aen went
[1:14:46] into a Strange Land with strange people
[1:14:49] you have left your people left the World
[1:14:52] Behind left your Associates behind
[1:14:55] crossed over through the blood of blood
[1:14:57] of Jesus Christ and are sojourn us
[1:14:59] seeking for a city whose build and make
[1:15:02] his God like Abraham's pilgrims along
[1:15:05] with him dwelling in tents churches
[1:15:07] fellow citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:15:09] hes of all things through Jesus Christ
[1:15:11] see we have crossed
[1:15:13] over separated now that's got to be your
[1:15:16] testimony before amen you begin to make
[1:15:18] this journey uh to this city whose
[1:15:21] building makers God you going to have to
[1:15:22] separate from some things you going to
[1:15:24] have to give some things up just like
[1:15:27] Abraham did when he began to look for
[1:15:29] the city whose Builder and makeer was
[1:15:32] God now um I want to just read a
[1:15:35] scripture here revelation 22 verse
[1:15:39] 1-5 glory to God I'm going to kind of
[1:15:43] turn some Corners in in this sermon here
[1:15:45] today but by the grace of God I believe
[1:15:47] will get the gist of what is being said
[1:15:51] by the Holy Ghost uh revelation 22:
[1:15:54] 1-5 let's just look at this really
[1:15:57] quickly the Bible amen says and he
[1:16:01] showed me a pure
[1:16:03] River uh of Water of Life clear as
[1:16:06] Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of
[1:16:08] God and of the lamb in the midst of the
[1:16:11] street of it and on other on on either
[1:16:15] side of the
[1:16:17] river was there the Tree of Life which
[1:16:19] bear 12 manner fruits and yielded a
[1:16:22] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:16:24] tree were for the healing of the Nations
[1:16:25] now I want you to just kind of uh follow
[1:16:27] that the scripture says that uh the Tree
[1:16:31] of Life which bear 12 man of fruits and
[1:16:33] yielded her fruit every month uh F first
[1:16:35] it was on either side of the river now
[1:16:38] this tree is grown on both sides of the
[1:16:39] river now that's a very strange tree if
[1:16:43] it's got trunks on both sides of the
[1:16:46] river because it's bearing fruit on both
[1:16:48] sides of the river amen but it's got
[1:16:51] trunks on both sides of the river come
[1:16:53] on somebody amen so there there there
[1:16:56] there's a little bit more Happening Here
[1:16:58] than than what what what the eye can
[1:17:00] actually
[1:17:01] see glory to God I I can go ahead and
[1:17:04] tell you that amen by the time we get to
[1:17:07] this spot there is a full complete Union
[1:17:10] that has happened with the Lord Jesus
[1:17:12] Christ amen so one part of the tree amen
[1:17:16] is the male part and the other part of
[1:17:18] the tree is the female part it's the
[1:17:20] bride and Christ there dwelling together
[1:17:23] bearing fruit in this city amen wow amen
[1:17:27] amen glory to God if you go back and
[1:17:29] listen to the message the bride tree
[1:17:32] you'll see brother Brandon has brought
[1:17:33] that to us and we've been restored back
[1:17:35] to a certain place only the bride can
[1:17:37] claim this amen all right let me just
[1:17:40] keep reading I I'll get into this more
[1:17:43] as we as we uh go through the weeks says
[1:17:45] and there shall be no more
[1:17:49] curse but the Throne of God and of the
[1:17:52] Lamb shall be in it and his servants
[1:17:54] Shall Serve him and they shall see his
[1:17:57] face and his name shall be in their
[1:18:00] foreheads now I'm going tell you you're
[1:18:02] not we're not waiting till we get there
[1:18:05] before our names are in his for in in
[1:18:07] before his name is in our foreheads
[1:18:10] right now his name is in our foreheads
[1:18:13] now that's not some tattoo in the head
[1:18:17] not like the 666 that people looking for
[1:18:19] in the hand and in the head that's not
[1:18:21] what the scripture is talking about amen
[1:18:23] when it talk about 666 on the hand it's
[1:18:26] what they work for they work for the
[1:18:29] denomination amen when it talk about the
[1:18:31] 666 in the head that's all they think
[1:18:33] about is what the denomination want but
[1:18:35] when they talk about his name being in
[1:18:37] our foreheads we only think about what
[1:18:39] the word wants for us right now that's
[1:18:42] the way we
[1:18:43] think amen glory to God Amen look at
[1:18:47] this it goes on to say this amen and
[1:18:50] there shall be no night there and they
[1:18:53] shall need no candle neither light of
[1:18:56] the Sun for the Lord God giveth them
[1:18:59] light and they shall reign forever and
[1:19:03] ever now I'm going to just drop a little
[1:19:06] question off here amen that I think is
[1:19:09] important the next scripture I want to
[1:19:10] read is John
[1:19:11] 8:12 but um my my my scripture I mean my
[1:19:15] my question is uh if Jesus identifies
[1:19:20] himself as the light of the world
[1:19:23] amen we're going to prove this in uh the
[1:19:26] beginning of scripture in the middle of
[1:19:28] scripture and what we're just reading
[1:19:30] here in uh in Revelation the end of
[1:19:32] scripture Jesus himself is the light of
[1:19:34] the world he is the light of this new
[1:19:36] city he is the light the lamb is the
[1:19:39] light thereof that's what the Bible
[1:19:41] tells us the lamb is the light thereof
[1:19:44] my question is amen uh if you reject
[1:19:49] Hallelujah if one rejects the light of
[1:19:53] their day how can they expect to live in
[1:19:56] the city where the lamb is the
[1:19:59] light can I ask the question again if
[1:20:03] one rejects the light for their day how
[1:20:08] can they expect to live in the city
[1:20:11] where the lamb is the light
[1:20:14] right I can just tell you right now you
[1:20:16] won't live there no sir here's another
[1:20:19] requirement you got to receive the light
[1:20:20] of your day if you want to live in the
[1:20:23] city where the lamb is the light that's
[1:20:25] right amen put away some things and then
[1:20:28] accept the light for your day I'm giving
[1:20:31] you some good clear instructions on how
[1:20:33] to get to this city amen whose building
[1:20:36] make is God all right here John uh 18 I
[1:20:39] mean John 8:12 says this then Jesus then
[1:20:43] spake Jesus again unto them saying I am
[1:20:46] the light of the world he that followeth
[1:20:49] me shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:20:53] have the light of life so Jesus himself
[1:20:56] is the light of the world now now let's
[1:21:00] just kind of go back and and follow I
[1:21:02] said we'll find him amen as the light in
[1:21:05] the beginning we'll find him as light in
[1:21:08] the middle of the scripture we'll find
[1:21:09] him as light over here in Book of
[1:21:11] Revelation 22 amen he's the Lamb of he's
[1:21:14] the light of the city the lamb is the
[1:21:16] light thereof now Genesis 1 let's go
[1:21:19] there Genesis 1 verse 1-4 and we'll see
[1:21:21] Christ as the
[1:21:23] light amen he is the light of the world
[1:21:27] and who whoever follow him shall not
[1:21:28] walk in darkness but have the the light
[1:21:30] of Life Genesis 1 says this in the
[1:21:33] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:21:36] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:21:40] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:21:43] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:21:45] upon the face of the waters and look at
[1:21:48] this and God said let there be light
[1:21:53] and there was light and look at this
[1:21:57] verse four says and God saw the light
[1:22:00] that it was good and God divided the
[1:22:03] light from the darkness now the
[1:22:06] unfortunate part here is that most
[1:22:07] people don't realize when God said let
[1:22:10] there be light that was not s you in
[1:22:15] light right because the s u in light did
[1:22:20] not come until the fourth day
[1:22:24] amen the Bible says that God made two
[1:22:26] great lights one to rule the day and one
[1:22:29] to rule the night one was amen the sun
[1:22:32] and the other was the moon hallelujah
[1:22:36] hallelujah hallelujah amen so so this
[1:22:39] light here in Genesis 1:3 was not s n
[1:22:44] light but this light in Genesis 13 is s
[1:22:49] o in
[1:22:51] light Glory Glory hallelujah amen this
[1:22:55] is the pillar of fire that came out of
[1:22:57] God Amen the logos that came out of God
[1:23:01] the same thing that led the children of
[1:23:03] Israel through the night amen as they
[1:23:05] were going through their 40-year Journey
[1:23:07] this is what came out at that point in
[1:23:09] time this is the same light that took a
[1:23:12] picture over the prophet's head come on
[1:23:15] somebody this is the same light that
[1:23:17] Paul ran into on the road to Damascus
[1:23:21] amen and when Paul ran into the light on
[1:23:24] the road to Damascus text who art thou
[1:23:27] Lord talking to the light come on
[1:23:29] somebody and the light spoke back to
[1:23:32] Paul the light is still speaking today
[1:23:36] the light told Paul I am
[1:23:40] Jesus so this was the Lord Jesus coming
[1:23:43] out in a form that we can actually
[1:23:45] identify him yes sir amen truly he is
[1:23:49] the light of the world he was the very
[1:23:52] first thing that came out of God and
[1:23:54] when we get to Genesis 21 and 22 we see
[1:23:57] he's the last thing sitting down on top
[1:23:59] of the city the lamb amen is the light
[1:24:02] thereof of the city so the first thing
[1:24:05] come out is the last thing that comes
[1:24:06] down onto the city hallelujah oh I like
[1:24:10] this truly he is the light of the world
[1:24:12] at the beginning we see him as the light
[1:24:15] in the middle of the Bible we see him as
[1:24:18] the light he's found in Psalm 23
[1:24:24] amen he's in Psalm 23 can we read Psalm
[1:24:28] 23 glory to God
[1:24:32] Hallelujah the Lord is my
[1:24:36] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[1:24:39] to lie down in Green
[1:24:42] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[1:24:46] Waters he restoreth my soul glory to God
[1:24:49] he leadth me in the paths of
[1:24:51] righteousness for his name's sake yay
[1:24:55] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:24:57] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[1:25:01] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[1:25:05] they comfort me thou preparest a table
[1:25:08] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:25:11] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:25:13] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:25:16] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:25:20] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:25:21] Lord
[1:25:23] forever and somebody might say brother
[1:25:25] Jack where you see him as the light in
[1:25:28] Psalm 23 let me just read a quote for
[1:25:31] you amen this is coming out of the
[1:25:33] message
[1:25:34] law Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah how I
[1:25:39] thank the Lord for this amen this city
[1:25:41] where the lamb is the light says we
[1:25:43] would like to think in the terms tonight
[1:25:47] of this wonderful letter of the Apostle
[1:25:49] Paul as we believe is not determined yet
[1:25:51] by SC Jess who wrote the book of Hebrews
[1:25:55] but believing that it was St Paul how he
[1:25:58] was trying to show and he was more or
[1:26:01] less using he was being a typologist
[1:26:04] here he was trying to show that show
[1:26:06] what the law was a shadow of good things
[1:26:09] to come and not the very image or the
[1:26:12] very things itself it was just a shadow
[1:26:15] and many times I've heard people quoting
[1:26:19] the 23rd psalm and saying they yay
[1:26:21] though I Walk Through The Dark
[1:26:24] Shadows of the Valley of Death if you'll
[1:26:27] notice it isn't the dark shadow amen
[1:26:30] it's the shadow right it says dark isn't
[1:26:33] in it the shadow of the valley of death
[1:26:38] now it cannot be dark and yet have a
[1:26:44] shadow it cannot be dark and yet have a
[1:26:50] shadow glory to God for there has to be
[1:26:53] a certain percent of light yes sir
[1:26:56] before it can be a shadow if it was
[1:27:00] perfectly dark there would be no Shadow
[1:27:03] so yay though I walk through the shadow
[1:27:07] of the valley of death now there has to
[1:27:10] be enough light to make a Shadow if it
[1:27:13] was dark in here my shadow would not be
[1:27:16] on the pull pit but being that there is
[1:27:19] light then it makes a shadow
[1:27:23] rightall come on somebody so death is
[1:27:27] dark in a certain way but it's only a
[1:27:30] shadow amen the Valley of the Shadow
[1:27:33] death so there has to be a certain
[1:27:35] amount of light in death oh I like that
[1:27:38] statement there has to be a certain
[1:27:40] amount of light and death to make a
[1:27:43] Shadow aren't you happy that that's so
[1:27:45] that there's a light in the
[1:27:49] valley brother sister I I don't know no
[1:27:53] other light that can meet me in the
[1:27:57] valley and cause a
[1:27:59] shadow to
[1:28:01] death he is that light praise God I'm so
[1:28:06] glad even in life we have a light and
[1:28:09] even in death we have a
[1:28:12] light amen he's the one that creates the
[1:28:15] light he's the one that creates the
[1:28:17] shadow for death because of him being
[1:28:20] the light in the valley that's why a lot
[1:28:22] of Believers when they going across the
[1:28:24] other side it's I mean you hear
[1:28:25] testimonies they shaking hands with
[1:28:27] people before they get there and
[1:28:29] greeting people like man I mean it's

[1:29:54] scripture and this is how we know that

[1:30:00] the middle to the end Jesus Christ

[1:30:06] verse 21 in Revelation uh 21 says and I
[1:30:09] saw no Temple
[1:30:11] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[1:30:15] the lamb are the Temple of it amen and

[1:30:40] light of it and the Kings amen uh of the
[1:30:43] earth do bring their Glory and Honor

[1:34:59] Jerusalem will

[1:35:05] where they're having a war right

[1:35:44] cleansed it's going to be purged you
[1:35:47] know also in the Bible I don't have time

[1:35:52] uh uh it's it's it's in the Book of
[1:35:54] Revelation it talks about um the two
[1:35:57] witnesses I think going to be they're

[1:36:02] Sodom it uses the term of Sodom right
[1:36:06] they're going to die in the streets of

[1:36:12] crucified now we know where our Lord was
[1:36:14] crucified right he was crucified in
[1:36:17] Jerusalem come on somebody but but when
[1:36:19] the when the Bible in the Book of
[1:36:21] Revelation says they're going to die in
[1:36:22] the streets of Sodom one brother asked
[1:36:24] me and said what you think that mean I
[1:36:25] said well I'm just looking at through
[1:36:27] spiritual eyes if it say they're going
[1:36:29] to die in the streets of Sodom that
[1:36:30] means homosexuality going to be on a
[1:36:32] rampage in
[1:36:36] Jerusalem and this is why it's going to
[1:36:38] have to be cleansed it's going to have
[1:36:40] to be purged it's going to have to go
[1:36:42] through a justification sanctification
[1:36:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost process yes
[1:36:46] sir because there going to be a New
[1:36:48] Jerusalem for us what when we talk about

[1:37:22] house she say Brams ain't never had no
[1:37:25] house where you got one
[1:37:29] here oh that ought to make you want a
[1:37:33] shout every detail God know that you

[1:37:56] took communion in the literal spot where
[1:37:58] the city will be raised
[1:38:00] up he goes on to say this he says Oh

[1:38:27] fruits they'll change their diet every
[1:38:30] month and it's and it and look at this
[1:38:32] now remember my question if one rejects
[1:38:35] the light of their day how can they
[1:38:37] expect to live in a city where the lamb
[1:38:38] is light here's the answer to the
[1:38:40] question amen he says they'll change
[1:38:43] their diet every month as for only the
[1:38:46] Overcomers yes sir do you did uh he says
[1:38:50] do you know that that it isn't for
[1:38:56] denominations if you reject a light for
[1:38:59] your day you cannot expect to live in a
[1:39:02] city where the land is the
[1:39:05] light you have to separate some from
[1:39:09] some things you got to separate from
[1:39:11] your denomination you got to separate
[1:39:13] from your denominational thinking you

[1:39:17] world if you want to go to that City
[1:39:19] whose building maker is
[1:39:22] God this is only for the
[1:39:27] Overcomers do you know that it is it

[1:39:33] at he going to take you right to the
[1:39:34] scripture let's turn to Revelation two
[1:39:38] just a minute amen y'all y'all can do
[1:39:41] you can turn to it there we we'll we
[1:39:43] we'll pick up the rest of the quote but
[1:39:44] turn to Revelation 2:7 you'll see
[1:39:46] exactly where he said where he got this
[1:39:48] from this is not for everybody everybody
[1:39:51] ain't going to make it to the
[1:39:53] city glory to God not if they not
[1:39:55] willing to separate from some things of
[1:39:57] the world and they're not willing to
[1:39:59] accept the the revealed word for their
[1:40:00] day you can't make it to the city the
[1:40:03] city is only for the O Overcomers and
[1:40:06] the Bible declares that Revelation 2:7
[1:40:09] is where he's referring to he says he
[1:40:12] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:40:17] spirit sath unto the churches to him
[1:40:19] that overcometh
[1:40:21] will I give to eat so the Overcomer is
[1:40:25] giv amen this reward to eat of the tree
[1:40:29] of life which is in the midst of the
[1:40:33] paradise of God only the Overcomer will
[1:40:36] eat in this
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:40] city all right let's go back to the
[1:40:43] quote amen we like to put things right
[1:40:45] there in the word right all right let's
[1:40:47] finish reading what he says for only the
[1:40:48] Overcomers do you know that it isn't for
[1:40:50] the nomin ations he said you mean that
[1:40:52] brother random let's turn to Revelations
[1:40:54] 2 just a minute and find Revelation 2:7
[1:40:56] says let's find out whether it's really
[1:40:58] uh the truth or not Revelation 2:7 reads
[1:41:01] like this and he that hath an ear uh let
[1:41:03] him hear what the spirit now remember
[1:41:04] he's not talking to the Jews now this is
[1:41:07] the church the
[1:41:09] Gentiles my he that has an ear let him
[1:41:12] hear what the spirit said to the
[1:41:13] churches to him that overcometh I will
[1:41:15] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[1:41:17] in the midst of the paradise of God it
[1:41:19] goes on uh uh in this in this in this
[1:41:22] quote it says Overcomers
[1:41:24] only that overcome the
[1:41:27] Beast overcome his
[1:41:29] mark That's Catholicism not just that
[1:41:34] protestantism
[1:41:36] denominationalism who overcame the
[1:41:38] beasts his Mark the letter of his name
[1:41:41] he have a right to the Tree of Life to
[1:41:43] enter into the gates where nothing that
[1:41:45] defiles can ever go
[1:41:47] in amen see think of of it now just a
[1:41:52] minute now as we as we go just a little
[1:41:54] bit further tree of life will be for the
[1:41:56] Overcomers only the leaves would be for
[1:41:59] the healing of the Nations that is the
[1:42:01] kings that live in there bringing their
[1:42:02] honor when they bring their honor in and
[1:42:05] Lay It Before the Throne of God just
[1:42:07] like the outside the 11 tribes brought
[1:42:08] in every one of them attempt to Levi
[1:42:10] when they bring their honor into in in
[1:42:12] into from the Blessed land and that
[1:42:14] they'll reach from the Tree of Life

[1:42:41] coming to the signature part here these
[1:42:44] bombs start dropping on them and uh and

[1:42:55] tell you there will there will be no
[1:42:56] peace until Jesus

[1:45:09] earth oh
[1:45:12] my when a thousand years are expired on
[1:45:15] this
[1:45:18] Earth then the Devil comes up
[1:45:21] and the second Resurrection comes the
[1:45:24] resurrection of the unjust The Gather a
[1:45:28] great Army like the Sands of the sea and
[1:45:31] they come up to Compass the camp of the
[1:45:34] Saints and when it does god reigns fire
[1:45:37] and brimstone out of the heavens and
[1:45:40] destroys them and John said I saw a new
[1:45:43] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[1:45:46] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[1:45:48] away and and when when we get that past
[1:45:50] the way it it's it just means the the
[1:45:53] atmosphere changes not completely
[1:45:55] annihilated but the atmosphere changes
[1:45:59] amen no more sin because the one that's
[1:46:02] that that that's actually uh causing you
[1:46:04] to do the things you do that that

[1:46:20] Compass the camp of the Saints and when
[1:46:22] it does god reigns fire and brimstone
[1:46:23] out of heavens and destroys them joh and
[1:46:25] John said I saw new Heaven and new earth
[1:46:27] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:46:28] was passed away and there was no more
[1:46:32] sea my God now in order for to not be
[1:46:36] any more sea this has got to be a
[1:46:38] massive
[1:46:40] City no more sea no more oceans all
[1:46:45] that's gone right watch this now he says
[1:46:48] and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:46:51] Jerusalem descending from God out of
[1:46:53] Heaven prepared as a bride ad D for a
[1:46:56] husband there you are watch this it says

[1:47:24] 15,000 square miles it says it's 15,000
[1:47:29] miles long 15,000 I mean I think he
[1:47:31] means 1500 1500 but when you start
[1:47:34] calculating all that if you uh uh in in
[1:47:36] uh and and building and things like you
[1:47:39] start calculating that it it comes out
[1:47:40] to Millions even
[1:47:42] billions when you start calculating but
[1:47:44] it's 1500 square miles it says 1,500
[1:47:47] 15,000 mi W 15,000 mil and again it's
[1:47:50] 1500 it says that's exactly the
[1:47:53] description the Bible gives of the city
[1:47:55] no wonder there's no more
[1:47:57] seed there was no place for it oh
[1:48:01] there'll be such a beauty and in there
[1:48:04] there's a fountain right at the Throne
[1:48:06] of God that flows Before the Throne

[1:48:10] River of Life and this tree dwells uh in

[1:56:32] something here brother Brandon has has
[1:56:34] explained that this is 1500 miles and he
[1:56:37] says he says it would be millions and
[1:56:40] millions of square miles millions and
[1:56:42] millions of square miles um I want to go
[1:56:45] to my my slide
[1:56:47] there um and I want to just explain
[1:56:50] something
[1:56:59] here now um this slide just kind of
[1:57:02] talks about the five layers of the
[1:57:06] Earth's
[1:57:07] atmosphere now that's just and I just
[1:57:10] you know five is a number of Grace but
[1:57:12] you know the the the earth is made up of
[1:57:14] these five layers here I mean the
[1:57:17] atmosphere and like I said the
[1:57:18] atmosphere is going to explode it's
[1:57:20] going to blow up all of this right here
[1:57:23] what you see brother Bram say they going
[1:57:24] to shoot a missile through that and blow
[1:57:26] it all up right I don't have time to
[1:57:28] read all that today but what we have
[1:57:30] here is the
[1:57:31] troposphere that's the first level down
[1:57:34] here at the bottom the
[1:57:36] troposphere now uh and and what we have
[1:57:39] here and just just so you understand
[1:57:41] that troposphere usually it says 0 to 12
[1:57:45] to 18 kilm I got to convert it to miles
[1:57:48] that's about 0 to 7 miles high is a
[1:57:53] troposphere now notice here on this
[1:57:55] little picture what what flies in the
[1:57:57] troposphere is hot air balloons they get
[1:58:01] that high and even airplanes passenger
[1:58:04] airplanes can get into the
[1:58:06] troposphere you can't even see an
[1:58:08] airplane fly you can see it get off the
[1:58:11] ground but when it get above the clouds
[1:58:12] you can't even see it up there and it's
[1:58:14] only roughly 7 Miles
[1:58:18] High the
[1:58:21] stratosphere is this next area and you
[1:58:24] know let me just let me just um read a
[1:58:26] couple things before I go further the
[1:58:28] troposphere is the lowest portion of the
[1:58:30] atmosphere and it is where the vast
[1:58:33] majority of weather is found is found in
[1:58:36] the troposphere right the other thing
[1:58:39] they say um the the top of the
[1:58:41] troposphere is called the tropopause
[1:58:44] which is the boundary between the
[1:58:45] troposphere and the stratosphere jet
[1:58:47] streams are Ty typically found in the
[1:58:50] tropopause the tropopause is generally
[1:58:52] an isothermal Zone where temperatures
[1:58:54] remain constant with altitude now the
[1:58:57] next one is the
[1:58:59] stratosphere you go from the troposphere
[1:59:02] to the stratosphere now that's anywhere
[1:59:03] from seven miles to
[1:59:06] 31 m miles high right and um this is
[1:59:11] also called the ozone
[1:59:14] layer this is where ultraviolet light
[1:59:17] from the sun is absorbed by ozone
[1:59:19] particles and convert it to heat they
[1:59:22] say commercial aircraft generally fly in
[1:59:25] the lower levels of the stratosphere so
[1:59:28] commercial aircraft can get here
[1:59:30] troposphere and then lower levels of the
[1:59:32] stratosphere that's as high as a plane
[1:59:34] can
[1:59:36] go I'm going a little further after the
[1:59:40] stratosphere we get the
[1:59:43] mesosphere all right the mesosphere and
[1:59:45] now this is anywhere from 31 to 50 miles
[1:59:49] high and meso means middle the metos
[1:59:53] spere mesosphere is responsible for
[1:59:55] protecting the Earth against asteroids
[1:59:58] and space debris and is where the
[2:00:00] objects tend to burn up it's in the
[2:00:02] mesosphere they say neither military nor
[2:00:05] commercial aircraft can fly in the
[2:00:08] mesosphere due to the lack of air mass
[2:00:10] so military aircraft can't even get up
[2:00:13] into this
[2:00:14] area the mesosphere and that mesosphere
[2:00:17] again 31 to 50 miles above the Earth's
[2:00:20] surface it keep
[2:00:23] going look at this it goes into the
[2:00:27] thermosphere now it was the thermosphere
[2:00:30] is roughly anywhere from 50 miles to 440
[2:00:34] Miles High remember I told y'all brother
[2:00:37] bradam said this in the scripture he
[2:00:39] said this city is going to be
[2:00:43] 1500 miles high 1,500 miles wide you
[2:00:49] youve never seen a city like this
[2:00:51] city watch this the thermosphere is
[2:00:55] where uh uh the they say the Carmen line
[2:00:58] can be found which defines where outer
[2:01:00] space
[2:01:02] starts which is uh roughly 62 miles
[2:01:04] above sea level some satellites
[2:01:07] including the International Space
[2:01:09] Station orbit the earth in the
[2:01:13] thermosphere but it goes higher the
[2:01:17] exosphere right and here the exosphere
[2:01:20] the highest
[2:01:22] point in the exosphere is
[2:01:26] 6200 miles anywhere from 440 mil to 6200
[2:01:32] miles the exosphere is the highest uh
[2:01:34] most outer layer of the atmosphere where
[2:01:37] the air is extremely thin it is the
[2:01:40] transition between the Earth's
[2:01:42] atmosphere and the vacuum of
[2:01:46] space brother said God feels all all
[2:01:49] space so out beyond the
[2:01:52] exosphere the highest that they can get
[2:01:55] they got they got the the the the the
[2:01:56] space shuttle of spaceship going up and
[2:01:58] even the satellite up there in the
[2:01:59] exosphere that's as high as they can go
[2:02:02] but this city that we're going to is
[2:02:04] actually twice the
[2:02:08] size of what you're looking at there man
[2:02:11] has never I has not seen Ear Has Not
[2:02:16] Heard nor has it entered into the heart
[2:02:19] of man the things that God has prepared
[2:02:22] for those that love
[2:02:26] him for the
[2:02:30] Overcomers you can't even see sometimes
[2:02:33] sometimes they say the the the the space
[2:02:34] shuttle comes in View and I and you'll
[2:02:36] see it out there or the space station
[2:02:38] they say you see all you see is just a
[2:02:39] light out there just something just just
[2:02:42] you don't you have it's it's massive
[2:02:44] when you get there but it's just a
[2:02:45] little light but this what we getting
[2:02:46] ready to go to and now now I want you to
[2:02:48] understand 00 Miles High 1500 miles wide
[2:02:52] brother Brandon say that the the the
[2:02:53] width is like from here Florida all the
[2:02:56] way to Maine all the way out to Indiana
[2:02:58] somewhere even past Indiana he said this
[2:03:01] city is so huge that you going to see it
[2:03:04] from everywhere on the
[2:03:07] Earth but when we get there church no
[2:03:12] Liars no abominal you got you struggling
[2:03:15] with the way you dressed now don't worry
[2:03:17] don't worry you ain't going there to
[2:03:18] struggle
[2:03:20] you got to overcome something
[2:03:23] now and and God and when we talk about
[2:03:26] overcome we not talking about God
[2:03:27] picking you up and P and pulling you
[2:03:29] through something and pushing you
[2:03:30] through it and at the other end saying
[2:03:32] blessed is he that overcomes it's going
[2:03:34] to be some stuff you got to give up now
[2:03:36] if you want to make it to this city
[2:03:38] whose building maker is God when I when
[2:03:41] I start looking at this little chart I
[2:03:43] say wow I mean as far as I can see with
[2:03:45] my eyes pretty much here in the
[2:03:46] troposphere that's as far that's as high
[2:03:48] as I can go but God 1500 miles
[2:03:53] higher than anything I can see on this
[2:03:55] Earth church I'm going to tell you this
[2:03:56] is a massive City there's never been a
[2:03:59] City established like this one and you
[2:04:01] talk about a bucket
[2:04:03] list amen get your passport
[2:04:07] ready get get your passport if you need
[2:04:09] a visa get your visa right and and look
[2:04:12] when you when you filing for a passport
[2:04:14] you got to get your papers turned in
[2:04:15] quick cuz sometimes it in used to take
[2:04:19] about 6 weeks to get it back but since
[2:04:21] Co yeah yeah it take a little longer to
[2:04:24] get things back you better make sure
[2:04:26] your house is in
[2:04:28] order let me finish reading the quote
[2:04:31] here out of out of questions and answers
[2:04:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah the prophet
[2:04:36] tolds us it it's going to be millions
[2:04:39] and millions of square miles this city
[2:04:41] that we're getting ready to go to and it
[2:04:43] says
[2:04:44] this there's 24
[2:04:47] Elders there's the bride
[2:04:50] there's the the uh 44,000 Temple unit he
[2:04:53] means 144,000 oh brother we're going
[2:04:57] somewhere things lay ahead for
[2:05:01] us the 20 and4 Elders the 144,000 Unix
[2:05:05] the bride sitting with Christ the bride
[2:05:07] sitting with Christ my home sweet
[2:05:11] home Amen to think that I have a
[2:05:14] privilege of going there and and you
[2:05:16] have a privilege of going there look at
[2:05:18] this
[2:05:19] Why Oh My My My My why would you choose
[2:05:23] to walk in this darkness and see no
[2:05:26] light and die and go into chaos and
[2:05:29] become
[2:05:30] nothing for when light takes its supreme
[2:05:33] authority I told you he was the light at
[2:05:35] the beginning in Genesis he was the
[2:05:37] light in the middle in Psalms he's the
[2:05:39] light in the end in in in Revelations
[2:05:41] but when light take its supreme
[2:05:46] authority there's no place for Darkness
[2:05:48] am go find where the darkness went when
[2:05:51] light comes that's when it's when all
[2:05:54] things are turned back to God Darkness
[2:05:56] had a beginning Darkness has an end
[2:05:59] light never had a beginning uhh or it
[2:06:01] never has an end God never had a
[2:06:04] beginning or never has an end so someday
[2:06:07] the whole debauch world with all of its
[2:06:09] sin and its beauty so-called and all of
[2:06:12] Fanatics and Sensations and all of his
[2:06:14] Glamour and everything will fade out
[2:06:17] into nothing
[2:06:19] and it'll be no more I want to tell you
[2:06:21] uh Paul says this in the book of Hebrews
[2:06:23] here we have no continuous City and I
[2:06:26] don't care you know once you once you uh
[2:06:29] take off one of these cities on your
[2:06:30] bucket list I've been to London I've
[2:06:32] been to Rome I've been here once you
[2:06:34] knock a city off your but bucket list
[2:06:36] all you keep doing is looking to put
[2:06:37] another one on the bucket list once you
[2:06:40] accomplish something you look to try to
[2:06:41] accomplish something more right but here
[2:06:44] you know uh we we have no consy nothing
[2:06:46] here lasts forever nothing but I tell
[2:06:49] you what when we get there this is an
[2:06:51] eternal
[2:06:52] City this is an eternal City this one
[2:06:55] you want on your bucket list now now
[2:06:57] when you go to Google they won't put
[2:06:58] this one at the top of the list you got
[2:07:01] to put it there the city whose's
[2:07:03] building Mi is
[2:07:08] God all of his Glamour and everything
[2:07:10] will fade out into nothing it'll be no
[2:07:13] more it'll be no more no more thought of
[2:07:16] it said even it won't even come into the
[2:07:20] remembrance anymore there'll be nothing
[2:07:23] to ever
[2:07:25] compare to this great City I I I I I
[2:07:30] I all I could do is just try to present
[2:07:32] it to you there's something awaiting us
[2:07:36] something much greater than you can ever
[2:07:38] even imagine Church don't get so uh
[2:07:42] bogged down with the things of this
[2:07:44] Earth don't get bogged down with the
[2:07:46] things of this Earth it means nothing
[2:07:48] brother brandom talked about how he
[2:07:50] would you know he would go to a certain
[2:07:52] go maybe visit somewhere and uh go on a
[2:07:55] trip somewhere and then he'd go back and
[2:07:56] go back to home and home has changed the
[2:08:00] the the maybe a place where there was a
[2:08:01] school now they got a shopping mall or
[2:08:04] maybe they used to have this and now
[2:08:05] they got that I remember you know where
[2:08:07] where we meeting at right now where I
[2:08:09] grew up at man this you this used to be
[2:08:11] the
[2:08:12] boonies we never thought we'd be out
[2:08:15] here we thought that's that's oh that's
[2:08:17] way out there now it's just a skip and a
[2:08:20] hop and they just keep going further and
[2:08:22] further west next thing know we'll be in
[2:08:24] the cane
[2:08:27] Fields right but but but it it shows
[2:08:30] that nothing lasts forever everything
[2:08:31] will keep changing but no matter what
[2:08:33] man does on this side it does not
[2:08:36] compare to what God has in already
[2:08:39] already prepared for us you must be
[2:08:42] ready to go you got to separate from
[2:08:43] some things yes yes if you want to make
[2:08:45] it to this city you got to give up some
[2:08:48] stuff
[2:08:50] hallelujah hallelujah this is only for
[2:08:53] the Overcomers and and I tell you what I
[2:08:55] I I was listening the brother Capers
[2:08:57] there this morning and and I was just
[2:08:59] thinking to myself when we get to the
[2:09:00] other
[2:09:01] side and I hear that
[2:09:04] voice singing bu land yeah brother
[2:09:08] Capers you made
[2:09:10] it Hallelujah brother Capers made that
[2:09:12] and and and and and as he was just
[2:09:14] singing this morning I like it tied
[2:09:16] right into my sermon because that's
[2:09:17] that's where we're headed and and we
[2:09:19] long for it there's nothing on this
[2:09:22] Earth that that should keep us here oh
[2:09:25] don't get wrapped up and tied up
[2:09:26] everything here going to be just
[2:09:28] destroyed it's going to be a new Heaven
[2:09:30] A New Earth oh my my my my my Hallelujah
[2:09:35] God bless you Church the city whose
[2:09:37] Builder and maker is God
[2:09:46] Amen let's have a word of Prayer
[2:09:50] father we are uh
[2:09:54] grateful we have the privilege Lord
[2:10:00] Jesus Lord to be able to see uh into
[2:10:04] what you have in store for
[2:10:07] us what a glimpse Lord God that we can
[2:10:10] we can get like Abraham got a glimpse in
[2:10:12] he was so convinced after he saw it so
[2:10:17] this City's got to be here is greater
[2:10:19] than than where I'm living at right now
[2:10:21] I'm willing to forsake everybody I'm
[2:10:23] willing to leave my family behind I got
[2:10:25] to go I got to got to go find this
[2:10:29] city and there after a great
[2:10:32] battle him
[2:10:35] recovering uh
[2:10:37] lot on his way back that's when he met
[2:10:40] the king of the city that he was looking
[2:10:42] for MDC Lord he he met him Lord Jesus
[2:10:46] and uh and and it just Lord it uh it's a
[2:10:50] blessing because the prophet tells us
[2:10:52] the exact same
[2:10:54] spot that he met MDC is the exact same
[2:10:58] spot where this city will raise up from
[2:11:02] Lord we're looking we're looking forward
[2:11:04] to it this this world is not our home
[2:11:06] and there's nothing father here that can
[2:11:08] hold us nothing can keep us father I
[2:11:12] just pray Lord Jesus that you would help
[2:11:14] us father to to set our affections on
[2:11:17] the things above
[2:11:19] not on the things of this Earth Lord
[2:11:21] this this means nothing this all this is
[2:11:23] going to pass away but let us set our
[2:11:25] affections on the things
[2:11:29] above we can't can't wait to get out of
[2:11:32] here
[2:11:33] Lord joining father with the other
[2:11:35] saints that have already gone home and
[2:11:39] father maybe it's things that will never
[2:11:40] get here on this Earth but you know the
[2:11:42] desires of our heart and father you have
[2:11:44] already promised that we'll have it on
[2:11:46] the other side
[2:11:49] everything we love Lord that's what you
[2:11:51] told a prophet everything he he loved
[2:11:54] and everything ever loved him you had
[2:11:56] given to him on the other side and
[2:11:58] believe with him sharing that father as
[2:12:01] our Prophet Lord his job was to get a
[2:12:03] bride ready Lord You've also given us
[2:12:06] the same promise that everything we love
[2:12:08] and everything that ever loved us will
[2:12:10] see on the other
[2:12:13] side help us Lord Jesus to prepare our
[2:12:16] hearts get our p ports ready our
[2:12:19] spiritual passports our visas whatever
[2:12:21] is necessary let us get it prepared so
[2:12:24] we can
[2:12:25] enter this city the city whose Builder
[2:12:29] and maker is God it's in Jesus name we
