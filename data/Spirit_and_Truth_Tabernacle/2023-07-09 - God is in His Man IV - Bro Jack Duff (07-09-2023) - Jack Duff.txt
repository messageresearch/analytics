something to go to Egypt so they working on it I heard that so we thank the Lord for all things amen God is God is good God is good amen I just want to before I got into the word just make just two two announcements uh one of them a man is that I want you all to be in prayer for a precious sister Liz a man there is a young man that has approached me about her and uh they have entered into a friendship a courtship and uh so just pray for them that God will just uh be with them precious brother Josiah amen he lives in Zimbabwe amen and uh so it's a long distance kind of courtship so just pray for him that God would just be with him through this time but we congratulate her amen thank the Lord for that amen the other thing I wanted to make mention of yesterday we had a we had a really good ministers meeting and uh and at the end of the meeting uh brother Gene just kind of announced that at brother West Coast Church there has been a transition and now brother Mike Toussaint has been voted in as the pastor there at a man Rapture and Faith Tabernacle so I gave brother Mike my sincere congratulations praise the Lord foreign I mentioned on yesterday that uh brother Mike I have watched him for years and uh brother Mike when he uh when the Lord just really got a hold of his life he stepped into just being the musician for the church and uh you know that was a time in the church had gone through transition they needed a new position to kind of Step Up and brother Mike came right in and he was so faithful uh just keeping the music going and then from there he transitioned to being a song leader and he was a I mean a wonderful song leader that creates a really really good atmosphere and uh and then uh as uh time would have it he started ministering so uh when I just looked at you know just the transition and everything that he's done throughout the years he's just to me just a perfect fit amen and I'm happy for him I'm happy that God is using him and I'm also happy to see the church stabilized because uh you know a lot of times churches just don't do Transition well and uh but it's good to see things just stabilized amen and that they do have leadership is uh it's been established so we're happy for them and we want to keep them in our prayers I told brother Michael and yes they say anything you need from us you let us know amen so praise the lord we give God praise for that amen [Applause] praise the Lord um I'm not going to take y'all time anymore thank y'all musicians always good to have my daughter amen uh playing for us and uh she gonna be with us for a little bit uh as long as you're here until the baby's born I believe amen and uh so that could be two months three months I don't know I tell my daughter uh Alexandria say you know you shouldn't have went on that cruise you're too far along to be going on a cruise but we couldn't do without him amen so we we thank God Amen for all things I I will read a scripture here today so if you don't mind uh joining me is this not working is this not working it's working okay all right all right uh turn with me to Luke chapter four and man Luke chapter four we have been uh in our journey here and I I I forgot to mention thank you for the specials that went forth this morning really really appreciate uh that wonderful anointing on that in the song Service as well thank you brother Solomon for leading us uh Luke chapter four I am I've been working through this uh passage of scriptures and and I I thought that I might come to an end today I'm I don't know uh how that would go it I think it's going to depend on y'all amen uh if uh uh if y'all pull me off these notes we won't we won't end today but if y'all keep me on the notes then we'll just keep going as long as the Lord uh would allow but let's just take our scripture anyway and just uh read from Luke 4 verse 16. it says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was uh he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written uh the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering a sight to the blind to say that Liberty had them at a bruise now we we know that he is referring back to a prophecy that Isaiah wrote and uh in the book of Isaiah 61 and I mentioned to you all as we were going through this series when you look in the Old Testament the name Jesus is not found in the Old Testament Hallelujah so it takes a revelation to understand that uh as Jesus is reading this he is the Fulfillment of what he's reading come on verse 19 says to preach the acceptable year the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and I I want you to always remember the prophet told us this was the greatest anointing that was ever on anybody is when Jesus read the scripture my God close the book and spoke in tongues no no jumping no shouting he sat down and that was the greatest anointing ever on anybody look at this the reason it was so great is because he knew who he was in Scripture oh come on somebody and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them um this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witnessed and wandered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever We Have Heard done in Capernaum do also here in thy country and he said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country it's uh repeating itself again amen but I tell you of a truth many widows are in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when Great Famine was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elias sent save Sarepta a city of sidon into a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in a time of elysius or Elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed Naaman the Syrian and all the in the synagogue when they heard these things were feel with Wrath ain't it amazing you can go to church and leave mad brother Branham told us that you leave one or two ways a better Christian or worse let's pray father we thank you for the reading of the word we trusted the Holy Spirit would now come and reveal to us the things that we have need of for this hour we trust that you will take control over this portion of the service as you have already demonstrated that you're here in the worship through the the song leading and father the specials and just the musicians Lord just a real wonderful wonderful atmospheres easy for us to to preach in the atmosphere like this so we asked God that you would take control of every thought not just the thoughts that I present but the thoughts that are received take control of it father and get all the glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated We are continuing our journey with God is in his man God is in his man um we started this by uh bringing out a number of things and if you all had a chance to hear the tape on uh Friday night uh you would have heard brother Brandon dealing with these same subjects uh that that that I have been talking about and I was I was just so blessed like wow we right in there right uh so uh just a just a blessing but brother Branham you know said he wanted to talk about Gardner's people God and his son uh God in his Universe you know God in his word uh you know we we have gone through all of that God and God in nature and I mean if you're looking for God you'll find them anywhere and everywhere if you're truly looking for God all right but I wanted to also just bring God is in his man amen uh uh as we just kind of uh work our way through this and let me just start with just a few quotes here that we'll read and uh first one is coming out of the sermon Moses uh brother Brandon preaches this message in Houston Texas and uh he makes a statement here in this sermon Moses it says and when he became the age of 40 years God called him for his purpose and he thought surely that the people of Israel would understand what he was sent for but the people misunderstood Moses amen and let me just not uh leave it there because there's a misunderstanding today and uh the people misunderstand who brother Branham is let me just let me just just just just hit the nail on the head the people misunderstand who brother Branham is and I know sometimes he's not presented the right way to people uh but but we need to understand just as God sent Moses as a prophet God has sent brother Branham as a prophet amen so here it says but the people misunderstood Moses now get this close friends the hardest thing that God has ever had to deal with his people is to get one mortal to believe another that's the hardest thing is it's for somebody to believe God is using this individual hallelujah amen that's the hardest thing God has ever done uh ever has done to get one mortal to believe well they believe Jesus would have been the son they couldn't believe he was the son of God they believed God but he said uh him being a man makes himself equal with God how could he a poor peasant how could he be a man born in a manger a background like he had for from a poor family raised up one garment on him now not brother bran I'm giving you all this description you can imagine when he's when Jesus is standing there reading the scripture amen and they look and say now it's not this Joseph's son I mean and not only are they not they're thinking it's not this Joseph something thinking this he got one garment he's from a poor family amen uh he he lived the way he did not even a place to lay his head how could this man say that the scripture is being fulfilled by him it's hard it's God it's difficult for God to get one more to believe another look at this look at this he goes on to say that he says live the way he did even not even a place to lay his head foxes has danced the birds of the air has Nest but the son of man uh how could that man be the Son of God how could it be what he claimed to be but he was wasn't he he was he was you know I was um just just you know coming through this because God was in the man Christ Jesus reconciling the world to himself the Bible tells us that and uh and unfortunately people misunderstood who Jesus was in his day they still misunderstand Jesus today glory to God you know uh I I've heard people say that you know what I'm just going to preach Jesus I'm not gonna preach this message but I'm a preach Jesus and my question is which Jesus are you preaching which Jesus because Paul actually says it in the script it says they they they preach another Jesus so which Jesus are you preaching you got to understand something yes there was a Jesus that died and rose again some 2000 years ago and and he redeemed us back to God through his blood that that is that's the same Jesus that is walking through the seven golden candlesticks so so where's Jesus are you preaching are you stopping at 2 000 years ago uh are you able to come forward and see what he's done in this day come on somebody hallelujah hallelujah you know I was um this whole thought came to me and I thought it'd just be what just one sermon but I was I was sitting in the courtroom months ago and as I was sitting there in the courtroom um you know just just supporting someone a man uh I I just began to observe some things and I realized how serious this was uh you know this this person is being accused of this and and and and their fate is in the hands of a judge A man also in the hands of a jewelry uh about 12 people that's been selected to make a decision as to whether you're guilty or you're innocent right and uh and and I looked at that and I said well my goodness your your life could change based on the decision of one of these people here in this courtroom and uh and then on top of that I realized that you had you know a one person defending you amen and then you had multiple people accusing you right and as you as you said into a situation like that you know like man and the way that they would present their arguments to accuse you they went they would have people leaving that courtroom and their mind like oh my goodness this this case right here I didn't know all of that and like oh this comes I don't know how this gonna work out they would confuse you like that hallelujah hallelujah you know and as I said then I began to go through the process I begin to think there is a higher Court than this there's a much higher Court than this and and if you ever have to come before God in his court you gotta understand what we have in this Earthly system amen it's uh it's symbolic of what we have in the Heavenly the unfortunate thing there won't be 12 people sitting there judging you and making a decision God has the final word in his courts hallelujah hallelujah amen you want to make sure you're standing on his side and the only way you can get on his side is accepting what he did at the cross I thought about a man of scripture a man that kind of goes with that Revelation 21 and 8. I want to just bring this in before we go further Revelation 21 and 8. uh it says um amen but the fearful glory to God and unbelieving and the Abominable Revelation 21-8 and the Abominable and murders and whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters and all liars to have their pardon liquid which burned with fire and brimstone which is the second death now you know I wanted to just kind of stop there Amen on that on that word the fearful and unbelieving I'm believing in what you know see the let me just take my time here because in in a denomination of church they would read that scripture and say if you don't believe in Jesus you'll end up in in hell right Hallelujah but I want to take it a little further than that if you don't believe in the reveal word for your day I'm believing in what I'm believing in the revealed word for your day good God Almighty amen that's dangerous Crown to be on when God promises something in the scripture and then God manifestes that in the scripture and then you choose to disbelieve that you are on dangerous crowns but the fearful and the unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers and whoremongers amen people committing uh fornication can't get control over that spirit that that's that'll lead you to hell amen and Sorcerers and idolators anything you put before God is idolatry sometimes you put your family before God you put your carbs in your in your jobs and your careers before God that is idolatry all right amen he says idolators and all liars hello somebody I I that that one right there uh from the youngest to the oldest all liars ain't no such thing as no white lie and black lie Allah is a lie and then you choose to be a liar you know what your end result is you know Christians even lie lie on their taxes Liars will end up in the Lake of Fire all right amen all liars should have their part in the lake which burned with fire and brimstone which is the second death my warning Amen to people that hear this sermon um don't fail to see what God is doing in your day I I brought that scripture to you the last time in the book of Acts our worker work in your day and though it would told you you still wouldn't believe right I'll work a working good day you want to know what God is doing today all right let's keep going hearing the message faith is the substance God is in his man God is in his man all right faith is a substance he says and when Moses came to the age of maturity he went out and seen two Egyptians mistreating a Hebrew and he slew the Egyptians and buried them and the next day when he met the Hebrews driving among one another while they said will you kill us as you did the Egyptian now look be quiet people Moses the very deliverer God's gift to the people they did not understand him amen you see what I mean uh they did not understand Moses and Moses thought surely that they would understand that he was their gift to deliver them look at this but they did not understand and now friends don't get me wrong may I say this was reverence in my heart knowing that I am eternity I am an eternity-bound person that'll stand before judgment someday thousands of people are missing their gift can I say that again thousands of people are missing their gifts see they can't understand it and they'll look and say oh he's just a man oh my God he's talking about his ministry now oh he's just a man that's true was it God or Moses that delivered the people if you read the scripture you know the Lord did that thing all right was it God or Moses that delivered the people it was God in Moses see he says they cry for the deliverer and when God sent to deliver to them they failed to see because it was by a man but it wasn't a man it was God in the man like that see if we can catch God and and and and and and and Moses we can catch God in his Prophet yesterday a brother made a statement and uh and I was just blessed by you know a couple statements uh one was saying you know there are certain things that brother Brandon taught that we might not find in the scripture and if we went to a denomination person we and we shared that with them they they might not be able to accept it because it's not in the scripture so when the brothers actually give us an example of what you what you're talking about there say well uh brother Brandon said that David had 500 wives give me the scripture on that I say brother you got a good point there I don't think I read that one yet in the scripture I say but here's ears here's my response to it any person even a denomination are y'all y'all stay with me now because it's gonna be good it's gonna be good here's my response to it if you believe Genesis if you believe the story in Genesis and what happened in the Garden of Eden you had to believe a prophet you had to believe what a prophet said the prophet Moses wrote what happened in Genesis and he was not there amen you say you going back to the pot if you believe Genesis you have to believe a prophet all the first five books of the Bible was written by Moses he was nowhere to be found how did Moses know what happened in the garden and you believe it amen come on somebody if we believe what Moses wrote there if I can believe Moses why can't I believe God sent a prophet in this day and told us that David had 500 wives it's the same God using his gifts it's God in the man the brother uh my God you know we as we were just kind of sharing you know uh you know it'll come back to me it's a thought that just that that brother said that just blessed my heart and it'll come back to me amen I I I I didn't write it down so uh that's what happened when you get over 50. uh it'll come back to me let's just let's just just stay with this God is in his man God God is in his man God is God and His man we're not following Brother Branham just to say we're following brother Brandon we see God in the ministry of this man brother random said they miss their their gift they thousands are missing their gift that's what he said and I want to say in the days of Noah they missed their gift in the the days of Jesus they missed their gift amen Paul actually tells us this how they missed a gift in the days of Jesus here here Jesus coming as a I mean the greatest delivery of all and they missed it they misunderstood it people are missing it today but Paul says it here in Acts 13 let's just read a man a few verses here on acts 13 verse 35 uh Paul is telling us how they missed the gift don't don't miss it don't miss it in this day don't miss it don't miss what God is doing in your day what God has done hallelujah we gathered here we Fellowship around a man a reveal word for this day God sent us a prophet and he gave us he gave us the truth of the scripture hallelujah amen so look look acts 13 verse 35 says wherefore saith he uh wherefore he saith also in another Psalm Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption but David after he had served his own Generation by the will of God fell on asleep and was laid unto his father's and saw corruption but he whom God raised again saw no corruption but be it known uh unto you therefore men and brother that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sin so Paul is in church trying to work with them some more they've already rejected them they've already put them on the cross and they still go on to church yes sir after rejecting the word they still in church Faithfully serving the lord at least they think they are it's the same thing today right and here they're still in church and Paul is coming right back amen with the same gospel trying to get them to see something hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah says being known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man is preaching to you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are Justified from all things from which ye cannot be justified by the law of Moses it says beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets behold ye despise us and wander and perish for our work a work in your days a work which ye shall and no wise believe though a man declaring unto you look at it he says and when the Jews were gone out of synagogue the Gentiles were sought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath I said it before I'll say it again for everyone that's rejecting it God got somebody else that's going to receive it so which side you're gonna be on glory to God everyone that want to reject it God got somebody to take your place hallelujah amen amen in the verse 43 now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews in religious processed followed Paul and Barnabas who's speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God and the next Sabbath day came almost a whole city together to heal the word of God but when the Jews saw the multitudes they were still With Envy upset because people came to church fill with envy and speak against those things which are spoken by Paul contradicting and blasphemy watch this then Paul and Barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves I'm worthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles now now this is when the gospel was actually released to us to be able to receive at this moment in church history but we are living in a time where now the gospel is turning from the Gentiles and going back to the Jews and we find the same type of rejection of the word of God this day as it was in that day man I want to say you know there's somebody that's going to receive it when we look in the the the the the the Pharisees and Sadducees they had a problem accepting it and even though you know they were rejecting there was at least one that wanted to receive it we don't even know her name we just know her condition and we know where she went at certain times a day because she couldn't go with everybody else her condition would not allow her to go to the well amen with all the other virgins that were coming her lifestyle was a little different come on somebody amen all we know all we know her her title is called the woman at the well can you imagine yourself getting to heaven and this lady walking up to you say I was the woman at the well I thank God for her story because she had something on the inside of her could identify with the Messiah when everybody else can see if this lady could all right about a a man and from that time I just I just love it I love this I love this look at look at look at this and and and uh and from that time it says so he was only 30 or 32 years old and a young beautiful woman come up one day to the well where he was sitting tired and he said to her woman bring me a drink she said it's not customary for you to ask me such a thing as that I'm a Samaritan you're a Jew segregation he said but if you knew who you were talking to what was that woman doing she was meeting God where was God in Jesus she was meaning God she met a man but it wasn't a man that she was meeting it was God in the man she was meeting see God is in this man it was God in the man she was meeting god brother Branham said God let that soak in the scripture said you've entertained angels not knowing what you were doing unaware it same as Abraham entertain angels and immedially after the angel left and had performed a miracle before him he called the man God Elohim the almighty God sitting there eating steak sandwiches drinking milk from the cow eating cakes and he was almighty God the woman little did she know look what it done for Abraham then it changed him and Sarah from the old man and old woman for a hundred years back to young young man and young woman uh that brought forth Isaac they met God they that's what the that's what dumbed the difference it says this immoral woman she met Jesus and she spoke to him watch how he made himself known he said woman go get your husband and come here now watch how he made himself known this is so important so important as we as we get deep into the sermon we gotta we're gonna I hope we can connect all these dots for you but this is important this is the Messiah sign this is how we know Messiah is a Monsters come on Church I'ma say that again the way he handles this woman is the sign of the Messiah so when we see amen those same things happening glory to God Amen in brother Brandon's Ministry then we know it's the same Jesus now it just came back to me it just came back to me the thing I said got away from me where am I just uh let me just leave me right there uh one of the brothers that shared who says there was a Brother start going around say you know the the story in Genesis he was a believer in the message he said you know the story in Genesis um it can't be true he said no I can't be true and he says uh the reason being how would Moses be able to write that how would Moses know what happened in the Garden of Eden how would Moses this and how Moses it says he wasn't even there it can't be true it's just a fiction story or something that they made up so uh the brother responds to that's why you gotta you can't approach this message from your intellect you need revelation pray for Revelation Revelation is something totally different from intellectual understanding Hallelujah and and see intellectual understanding uh if somebody can show you that one plus one equal two and then they come in and throw some other equation on you'll be all all confused in your intellect right but but when it comes to Revelation nobody can take that from you right and and so what brother say he's saying he said wow that that does make it you know I mean how what Moses wasn't that so how did he know God have to show them these things and it's and either you have to believe that God showed him or God didn't show him it was God and His man was a brother brother responsible since you believe in the message saying how was it that brother Branham was able to go to City after City and tell people their names and the addresses was that brother Branham doing that or was that God well the same God that can show a prophet your address is the same God that can show Moses what happened in the Garden of Eden the God we serve hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we know we stand when it comes to this all right let me keep reading now amen look at this it says they're more women when she met Jesus and she spoke to him watch how he made himself known he said woman go get your husband and come here she said I don't I do not have any husband first of all she was being truthful she wasn't a liar because Liars got to have their part in the Lake of Fire she wasn't trying to hide nothing from him I don't have a husband amen he said you said well and from that time she was changed Oh What A Difference that Jesus when she met him there looked like a man and I can imagine seeing those big pretty eyes tears coming out of them she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet but who are you Jesus said I am he that speaks to you right and from that time from that time she had a message to tell the world come see a man who told me the things I've done the Messiah is on the earth she stirred her City a few hours before that the city would have laughed at her she couldn't even come to the well with the rest of the women what happened what made the men listen to her if you've ever been in the orient they wouldn't listen to a woman like that some Oriental brother was trying to tell me said the woman wasn't a prostitute because the men wouldn't have listened to I said but brother you fail to see she met Christ that's what made the difference that lady was able to wreck she didn't miss the Messiah in her day she didn't miss the revealed word in her day she caught it glory to God we better catch it for our day I've had people say to me that brother Branham is not in the scripture and this is why it's hard for them to believe this message because this he's not in the scripture I said and I you know I I let people talk and express their hearts and everything but when you cross the line of truth we have a problem and and I'm gonna just take five scriptures today so this is a sermon that if somebody tell you that brother Brandon was not in scripture I'm going to give you five scriptures today not that you can prove to people he was in the scripture Hallelujah I told you earlier the name Jesus is not found in the Old Testament so how do we know that Jesus was the Fulfillment of the things prophesied in the Old Testament it's because of the works that he manifested if you don't believe me believe the works I'm just I'm gonna just give you five scriptures but I'm gonna tell you this there are more than these five that actually prophesy about brother branham's Ministry it does not have his name but it does have his ministry come on somebody let's start with let's start with Malachi four five and six the very last scripture in the Old Testament we believe this message because it was found in Scripture Malachi 4 5 and 6. behold who is this I will send you who is the I who is the I the I is God I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now a lot of people actually say that this was with John the Baptist uh was on Earth that was the coming of the great and drafted the Lord said really Jesus died on the cross was a dreadful day no that was a day that brought Mancan mankind back in fellowship with God that was not a dreadful day that was not a judgment day sin was judged but mankind wasn't judged on that day that was not the great and Dreadful day of the Lord the grand Japanese coming and it's a future work but before that happens God promises to send Elijah look at this verse verse verse 6. and he shall turn the heart to the fathers to the children now if you go back and read the scripture you'll find that John the Baptist already fulfilled that part and we know John the Baptist did that amen the Bible says he did it amen but it also says and the heart that's a that's a conjunction that's a second ministry that's in the scripture in the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and spite the Earth with a curse so there's a Ministry coming to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers what is that to turn our hearts back to the word of God that was brother Brandon's Ministry to turn our hearts we're not here to exalt brother Brandon we're here to thank God that he turned our hearts he did exactly what the scripture said now we fought we fall in love with Jesus all over again through the word let me give you another Revelation 10 7. last last scripture in the Old Testament the last book of the New Testament Revelation 10 7 God promises that this ministry will come behold but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God to be finished as he have declared to Servants of prophets amen uh uh uh somebody you know I I like to just say like this uh there won't be any further Revelation than what the prophet has already said there are no other Ministries coming there is no eighth Angel there's no ninth Angel there's no tenth Angel there's only a seventh angel and the seventh angel that was spoken of in Revelation 10. is the same seventh angel that's spoken of in Revelation 3 14. let's read that Revelation 3 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God God speaking of brother branham's Ministry in these verses remember I've just told you that the uh Paul said we turn to the Gentiles you know who the first messenger was to the Gentiles Paul there were seven Messengers Jesus had him in his hand in the Book of Revelation say they had seven stars in his hand Jesus had all these messages in his hand he gave them specific Ministries in order to get to keep the people in line with the word the first one was Paul the last one William Marion Branham spoken up here in Revelation 10 spoken of in Revelation 3. let's also look at revelation 22. verse 16 and 17. I'm I'm just using five but there's so many more of them it's a lot more than this revelation 22 16-17 look at this I jesus who did this I Jesus have set my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bride and Morningstar you say you're preaching Jesus you preaching Jesus which Jesus you preaching which Jesus you preaching Hallelujah and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that here say come and let him that is The Thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely I got one more scripture I want to read that speaks of his ministry it speaks of brother branham's Ministry amen it's spoken of in scripture that's why I believe the message I don't believe it because my mama told me I don't believe it because you know somebody else told me I believe because when I read the scripture for myself I could see how all this was flowing right there in the Scripture it was promise now his name just like Jesus name was not in the Old Testament you won't find William brantley's name in the New Testament but you'll find his ministry Saint Luke 17 26-30 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and you know you got to understand this you know what what's going on in the days of no watch what the Bible says they did eat that's just excessive eating that's that's uh smorgasbords everywhere and and and Golden Corrals everywhere hello somebody a Chinese buffets that's what that is they did eat and some of y'all enjoy going there pay one price and get as much food as you and they have to kick you out the restaurant you eat too much you have to leave but this is this is what the problem is Right amen says they didn't eat they drink they married wise what this is they they get married they get divorced they get married they get divorced they get married they get divorced that's what Mary wives is hello and then let's go to the next one they were given in marriage you want to know what that is that means they live together or what we used to call second they shocking they mean they living together and not married but still practicing as if they were married we got more of that today than we ever had these are signs of the time let me go a little further say they were they were giving a marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all let's keep going because here's the problem look at likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drink they bought they sold they planted they built it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all now let's go back because in the days of lot it was homosexuality that was a problem and that's why God destroyed because of the homosexual agenda that was in the Earth at that time he destroyed a city but here's the problem in our day we're gonna have marriage and divorce problems as well as homosexuality of those issues lesbianism all of that at the same time fighting Spears everywhere and and and what about this some marriages are broke up because of a homosexual relationship you young ladies you better watch that see you you guard yourself y'all y'all y'all y'all y'all making me talk this morning guard yourself don't get your emotions so wrapped up in things because whatever happened you get to you you get your heart broken by some young man that's not ready to be a husband you shouldn't even be talking to him you know he ain't got no job you shouldn't even be talking to him he's not ready to be no husband but you get your emotions all worked up like you're gonna create a husband now you can't do that you gotta let God send you a husband you young men got to be the same way don't be don't be just just going after some young lady because of her looks is she ready to be a wife can she cook can she clean come on right I mean look at just some of the simple things can they can they take care of a house is he borrowing money from you to pay his bills brother every week he broke how he gonna take care of you and see what happened we get into these bad relationships ain't prayed about nothing we get into these bad relations then our hearts get broken and now as a young lady another young lady slipping up to talk to you as your friend yeah my heart been broken too and yeah yeah I know and that's why I do this and next thing you know you're into a homosexual relation a lesbian relationship because your heart been broken if you would have never been in that relationship amen it would have never happened to your heart guard your heart it ain't no relationship until it's announced from this pulpit the same day that lot went out of Sodom and Rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed this is a scripture that's telling us when these things are in the Earth God's going to have a prophet in the land to deal with some of these things that are in the earth now here God's already sent his Prophet now uh uh uh uh I think everybody in here would agree to say yeah we see the lesbianism we see the we see uh the homosexuality actually you young people may not may not realize this but it's only recent very recent that we were given June as gay pride month when I was a little boy that was not we didn't have no gay pride month but now they gave a whole month to it and trying to trying to equate it to Black History Month no it's not connected in any way shape form or fashion right but but here they they they they they in every business you go to got the rainbow flag uh all over the place and look let me tell you understand something the rainbow does not belong to the lgbtq [Applause] Community they got more letters that they're adding now it don't belong to the rainbow belonged to God and where he promised in the Book of Genesis that he would not destroy the Earth with water that that that's that's a believer's sign let's believe a sign but I can tell you right now this destruction will come just like it came to Sodom Gomorrah destruction will come all liars abominable you're gonna find their way into the Lake of Fire that's what the Bible promised we all see that but you know there was another sign that happened in the days of Abraham and lot and the other sign which was the sign of the Messiah the sign of Messiah is being able to reveal the secrets of the heart when Jesus met the woman at the well she said we knew we know when Messiah comes he will do this she understood the sign of the Messiah Hallelujah in in in in in in in Abraham's day and last day the sign of Messiah went forth because God was sitting there y'all gonna talk to me today he was sitting there having a conversation in flesh God was in a man God was in the flesh of a man having a conversation with Abraham and Abraham when he saw God and he saw to him he says my Lord my Lord's but my Lord hallelujah amen when he said my Lord he said he said you know let me let me get a cat together let me do this let me do that let me do all these things and while he's sitting there having fellowship with God he say where's Terry your wife she's an attempt behind you see an attempt behind you say uh Abraham I'm gonna visit you and Sarah your wife gonna have a son Sarah started laughing in the tent in within herself she laughed and said can uh oh here we go here we go we back to Wednesday night can me and my Lord have pleasure again come on right CeCe call Abraham her Lord can me and my Lord have pledge again and I have a son she laughed within herself God with his back to the tent why is Sarah laughing hello why is Sarah laughing [Music] yes you were laughing you you not only were you laughing but you said this who heard it Abraham didn't even hear it Abraham didn't even hear and Abraham probably sitting there with his mouth I'm like oh who is this and I'm that that I'm entertaining this is God In the Flesh God knew her thoughts God knew everything about her now in the scripture says it was in the days of lots so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so therefore if that happened in the days of lot where God could reveal to Abraham the secrets the sign of Messiah then that same thing would have to be manifested in this day can we read bombing Gilead you know as I I think about the service you know some of this is just refreshing for many of us but you know what there's so much ain't never ever heard this in our life and it'll be the thing that settles them our young people that that ain't that I mean they just kind of coming up we just assume you know our young people need to be grounded and established in the word because people gotta attack them why you believe what you believe because my mama said it no you guys know I saw it in the Bible I read it my pastor read it I saw it in the Bible where God promised to send brother Branham and I believe what the Bible say let's pick this up out of Barnum and Gilead all right over on this side there's a a colored woman with a hand up now don't get offended by that language don't get offended that's the the terms that they use back in those days and it was very acceptable nowadays people just get mad don't allow the devil to get you off into that this is not uh this is this ain't about a a white prophet and black people this ain't about nothing like that it's about God and a man I see God in a man and I'm not worshiping that man I'm worshiping God because even the man told John there's another scripture there's another scripture right there the man told John in in Revelation worship God you know that angel that John was talking to you want to know who the angel was that John was talking to because the angel said I am of the fellow servants the prophets you want to know who that angel was he was an angel he was a prophet from the future see we can see God in the past but a prophet from the future when John saw him on the Isle of practice he was talking to a prophet from the future and the prophet had a name the prophet from the future had a name his name was William Marion Branham found right there in the scripture talking to John revealing the Book of Revelation [Music] okay all right yeah I teach on it every Wednesday I know it's a prophet that revealed it who revealed the seals who revealed the Thunders it was brother Brandon his ministry that did it and not only just did it God used a supernatural Cloud to vindicate that he was with this all right in the Supernatural crowd formed the face of Christ and it was turned one particular way the people couldn't understand why I was turned that way it says a mysterious crowd a cloud appears over this Minister and everybody a mysterious Cloud that's all they got in Life Magazine I believe a mysterious guy brother random say no it's not for them let them keep looking at it that way but for the bride I got something to tell y'all turn it to the right and then tell me what you see you didn't see brother Branham you saw Christ and you should still be seeing Christ his job was to point us to Christ all right over on this side there's a colored woman with a hand up what do you think sister do you believe me to be God's Prophet or his servant look at this now watch this watch this watch this do you believe me to be God's Prophet or servant think I have enough favor with the crowd to say prophet you know what he got enough favor right here to say prophet favor with a crowd let's say Prophet all right do you believe me to be his prophet you're an Ethiopian woman I'm an anglo-saxo Anglo-Saxon man like Jesus met the woman at the well talk to her just a moment now Jesus will let me know your trouble will you believe it's the same Spirit was upon him that is upon that that was upon Him is the one is upon me you will then your high blood pressure will leave you do you believe have faith don't doubt just believe with all your heart have faith and don't doubt and I just want to pause there every time you listen to tape from Brother Branham and at the end where this prayer line is going no matter what city he was in in this world the angel did these things in the prayer line thoroughly Vindicated thoroughly Vindicated why would we disbelieve that look let me go a little further now I turn my back the prophet is is is there before these people in Long Beach California and as he's praying in the prayer line say now I've turned my back now most people might think this is for show but it's not for a show amen is to show you that God has manifest himself the same way he did in Abraham's day Abraham and lots day it was the same God and it was a Simon Messiah then it's a sign of Messiah and Jesus day when he met the woman at the well it was the sign of messiah in 1961. now I turn my back you pray I just I'm sorry I'm gonna read it like this now I turn my back you praying a lady appears before me she's sitting in this direction She's suffering with bursitis stand up now she might not have knew who she was because it could have been anybody in there suffering with bursitis but when he calls your name and I want to tell you something this morning as the word of God is being revealed to you he is calling your name right now stand up her name is Mrs Hart stand up have you got a prayer card no you don't you don't need it you touched something didn't you do you believe with all your heart how many knows that Jesus Christ said the The Same Spirit would be here how many knows that that was the sign of the Messiah when Jesus was on the earth Harmony knows he promised it to the elect Church in the last day well here it is now you see new converts after 2000 years it's never happened in 2000 years because the evening lights are shining the Bible said there would come a day that wouldn't wouldn't be neither day nor night but in the evening uh time it would be light there he is now what kind of light would it be the same Sun that Rose in the East sets in the west is that right the same I mean the evening lights has come you believe that so when brother Branham is standing there before these people look this one just no one meeting that this happened I only just brought you one quote if you search the message you'll find brother Branham turn this back many times many different cities to try to get the people to see that the same God that was speaking to Abraham and reveal the secrets in Abraham's day was the same God that was in Jesus and revealed the secrets of the woman at the well was the same God that was in this ministry if you don't if you don't believe me believe me for the works I'm uh I'm coming home I'm coming home I I just I just love the word of God um I want to say that the same pillar fire that led the children out Israel through the Wilderness is the same pillar fire that spoke that Paul spoke to the road to Damascus it's also the same pillow fight that was captured on the picture and hang in the Library of Congress uh when brother Branham standing there defending the gospel in uh in Texas and they took a picture in Houston Texas they took a picture in that pill of fire uh showed up on the picture only supernatural being ever recorded own picture and and and and and I don't know if I got the quote here but brother Brandon will make a statement like this when that pillar fire was taken above his uh I believe it was over his shoulder over his one was over the shoulder one was over his head right and when that pillar fire was taken over his head he'd say it wasn't me I was just standing there and I want you to notice something the pillifier the position of it I don't know oh that's the cloud that the pillar fire is uh over his head which shows that brother Brandon is under the headship of Christ I got a quote here out of the maniac of guedera let me let me read this says here some time ago you all noticed that they had the picture set was taken by someone of Jesus holding his arms out and two planes coming over you seeing that in the paper but the man admitted it he painted the picture he painted the picture it wasn't so you see and he admitted it and it was in the Reader's Digest that it wasn't so but this picture here not because dear Christian uh uh it's it's not me I just happen to be standing there that was all but that is the picture of a supernatural being and to my opinion if you notice it's the pillar fire go back in my books for even years before this was testified look back there at the time after after time after time it appeared looking a little bit little book the first one I've written called Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how the big newspapers of Louisville Kentucky and and also a Mystic like a p a Mystic like appears over a local Baptist Minister while baptizing when he stood down there and told me right before at least 10 000 people that this thing was coming to pass that your ministry will be as John the Baptist was sent forth as a forerunner of the first coming of Christ your ministry will bring forth will be will it be the bringing forth of the second coming of Christ brother brannon's Ministry was uh was identified by almighty God with a supernatural being telling him while he was baptizing people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptized in the 17th people the 17th person came in to be baptized and here comes the the angel Lord come now say as John the Baptist foreign the first coming of Jesus your ministry and he also said you your ministry will forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus I know we right where we need to be if we want to be ready for the second coming Lord we better be listening to what's in this message I'm going a little further I'm almost there yeah I think I can read these and um and we'll be we'll be done let me go to uh Revelation chapter four Oh Glory to God God is in his man God is in his man amen amen amen and and I just you know I've always asked people if you're going to tell me that brother Brandon was not the Fulfillment of Malachi 4. now you you saw it you read it God's gonna send Elijah y'all going to send me Elijah the prophet you read it and if brother Branham is not the Fulfillment of that Elijah that was sent just tell me who is that way I can stop wasting my time and I can get behind that 110 percent who is this Elijah that God promised and actually according to the scripture God promised to use the spirit of Elijah five times he used it in Elijah they use it in Elisha because he got a double portion of Elijah's spirit and then he used it and John the Baptist ministry and then he also plan to use it one more time before the Dreadful day of the Lord and that was in brother branham's Ministry and the last time God used it he is a he is one of the two witnesses of Revelation 11 that preaches to the Jews I'm telling Elijah is actually on his way back he coming to priesthood a Jews you know brother Branham tried to go to Israel he tried he had a ticket to go to Israel and he was on his way he said he said the Jews are looking for the sign of the Messiah they're looking for brother Brandon we know if you go that they'll stop believing in Christ he said he said he saved you if you go they'll believe and brother Brandon had a six and he said what a setup he said I got to go got his ticket he on his way and with a plane getting ready to to I mean on the tarmac there get ready to take off God said come here let me talk to you I don't want you to go to Israel can you imagine that there are certain places the prophet couldn't go Israel was one of them don't let don't touch your feet in Israel now there's a reason there's many reasons for that do you know if brother Branham had gone to Israel there's a couple things that we can look at here had it gone God would have manifest himself through that prophet just like God manifests himself through Moses when he struck The Rock but it would have broke all the scriptures and see sometimes the scripture binds you you can't do nothing outside of this word the brother random say God I said no no I don't want you to give us but not even born at that time we would have never had a chance so can I tell you like this God restrained the prophet from going to Israel because he loves you in the scripture that would have been broken because it was not his ministry to go to Israel it's Elijah himself Elijah has been preserved to go to Israel God preserved Moses and God preserved Elijah Elijah was caught up in a whirlwind a tears of fire came and took him out of here he's been preserved and he's coming back but his spirits was going from man to man to man because God loved it that much he enjoyed that Spirits he used it five times whoa in my Baptist Church they never told me that the spirit Elijah came five times never I didn't know that till I come to this message and I can see it right there in the scripture let me let me keep reading watch are you ready he says listen keep this keep this now just remember to let you know and in other words that he give him some advice Gene you can hold his tape and just tell him don't don't let this tape get out I'm glad the tape got out listen now I don't have to hold it here that's all right I mean just keep the tape permit this permit this to the church and we part of the church the church is the called out right notice this now that you might know that the color of the light that's what that's with the with the Lord the that and the Lord's light that follows the Lord and is of the Lord is Amber yellowish green that's the same color of the light that's with us today as the scientist has took its picture yellowish green Amber when a little boy and I seen it for my first time you remember uh the old timers uh here I always told you before the actual picture was taken it was yellowish green which is Amber now to let you know that the spirit of the Lord he said when he seen it from the Lords of the living creature that stood in his presence from his Lawrence upper was like fire a light from his Lawrence downward was covered with light all around was many colors uh like unto a rainbow and they trying to steal the rainbow sign like into a rainbow is that right and I want you to remember God still exists in the same colors from the lowest upward fire amber color shot with a movie camera or with a color camera Amber from the Lawrence up from the Lawrence down and all around many colors like in the like is in the rain in the rainbow in the sky after ring Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit still in its power still in this church in this last days look at this there you are not me I was just standing there but it was a picture that was taken I want you to look at that and see brother random is saying when I'm gonna come back when he was standing there defending the gospel actually it was uh uh Dr Bess that wanted to have a debate you know over the scripture and and brother Bosworth 80 something years ago say can I take him up on the debate brother Brandon said just whatever you do just don't argue with them don't fuss with him don't argue with him he said brother Brandon I promise you I won't argue with him say but I just got to take this man up on this debate okay I give you permission brother Brandon went and set in the in the balcony of the church brother Bosworth went to the pulpit with his Bible and the doctor the best was just going on and you know uh this is wrong and that's wrong and that's wrong and that's wrong and uh and and and and and uh Dr I mean brother Boswell said I just got one question Dr best just just one question if you just answer this one question that's all so you ain't got to have a lot of questions just one just one just one and uh and and when he says uh um the seven compound names of Jehovah Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah tiskanu Jehovah shalom Jehovah Nissi you know these seven Jehovah right uh these seven compound names does that apply to Jesus remember his name not found in the Old Testament but his characteristics are so found there does that app say I ain't got time to answer questions like this so the debate is over because had he said of the plot of Jesus did he he would have to know that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today damn family and he was standing there taking pictures say I got my fist underneath this PR this preacher's nose take the picture he hired the man to take pictures say Well since we're done if brother Brandon want to come and close out the audience he's certainly welcome to do that but this debate is over with brother random comes down out of the the balcony and he walks down and now brother Brandon's description is that there were thousands of angels that's his description and and most people brother brother I remember George brother George Smith his son-in-law telling us to say it really won thousands of people that was there so how could it be thousands of angels He said well see he's looking in a different dimension thousands of angels walking with him as he's going down there and As you stood up down and say well you know this brother is just like me he got a father and a mother just like me so y'all you know just bear with him he's just standing on what he believed why why are they taking pictures the the guy the best intelligent take pictures that Dr Benson but the man just stand up taking pictures of brother Branham took all the pictures went back to his room after the night was over and tried to process all the pictures every picture blank professional photographer not an amateur like me but a professor for time every one of them was blank only one picture was developed and this was a picture with the pillow fire over the top of the prophet's head God was in his man vindicating his prophet now I don't know the story of Dr best after all of that but if he didn't believe after all that then he fit the same scripture as these Pharisees and Sadducees no matter what work was done they still wouldn't believe but for me I'm like the woman at the well this got to be the silent Messiah let me finish reading not me I was just standing there but it was a it was a picture that was taken I want you to look at that just exactly what Ezekiel Saw same colors the same way and acted the same way and fleshed the same way of the living creatures what is it the living creatures represented represent the Living Church uh the church that's a living by the power and the resurrection of Christ them same Amber colors has coveted it with a covenant from the law and upward from the uh from the lowest downward there's no more guessing science has took the picture look at the colors just look at the colors of of fire in there see the rainbow look at the yellowish Emerald color now on this camera it was just a straight photograph photo a photographer's camera on this camera was colored pictures uh Kodak chrome color look at the amber color in there if I could get it get it over a light somewhere where you could see in the back can you see like unto a rainbow look at the streets coming back and forth like a rainbow everyone a different color we're going to get into that in a few minutes what are these what are these what are those colors and what do they reflect oh that just makes my poor heart jump for joy and to know that in this day that we're living in that Christ when all other ground is sinking Sands all other ground I think why can't I tell that why can I make that world make the world see it the world wasn't meant to see it the world won't see it they never will see it but the church is receiving the mightiest shaking it ever had how we thank God for this I got one more quote that I want to finish here with you all I see are y'all trying to get that picture for everybody um if you get it fine if not just a quick Google search or find it um pillow fire over brother branham's head just look for that um this last quote that out that I read for you and they'll show you the the um uh it's God vindicating this Prophet y'all God did it with the cloud God did it with the pillow fight of his head it was God in the man it wasn't the man himself it was God and the man God Vindicated it and look I don't think God would be wasting his time vindicating a man like that if he was going to give him wrong Doctrine why would God vindicate it if the doctrine is wrong why would God do that I mean you need to explain that to me why would God put his stamp of approval on somebody's got wrong Doctrine God don't do confusing things like that now the only person confused is you but God ain't come God God knew exactly what he's doing when he been the case of man's Ministry it's God in the man here's my last quote the anointed ones at the end time the anointed ones at the end time here it is I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing look at what the prophet saying anointed ones at the end time he says no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper it says but but but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and am determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are it's not brother Branham doing that it's God in the man I'm only I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that your feet know when I'm so don't I know people misunderstand I'm I'm quoting why are you always quoting brother Branham you misunderstand why I'm doing that I'm doing that because I'm trying to keep us in line with the word you go to other churches they're just coming up with all kind of thoughts and ideas let's go back to what a prophet said amen do you realize when I quote Paul I'm quoting what a prophet said do you also understand when I quote Moses I'm quoting what a prophet said when Jesus quoted Isaiah and they got mad in church he was quoting what a prophet said I'm doing the exact same thing I'm quoting what a prophet said I'm not exalting the prophet don't get mad at me don't misunderstand what I'm trying to do I need you to understand something when I'm when I'm when I'm reading you these quotes you're not feeding on a man you're feeding you're not feeding on a man a man's words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and who is the son of man the son of man when you use the term the son of man you're talking about Jesus Christ what brother Brandon was is hey son of man revealing revealing the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations because that's the only way you're going to get above us by having a revelation to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray God was in his man I believe that church and I receive what his man had to say let's pray thank you Jesus we see it when we say we see it it means we understand it it's revealed to us as I heard a minister say recently father no matter how much we preach no matter how much we teach no how no matter how many scriptures we read and how many quotes we read you alone reserve the right to bring revelation you told Peter that Flesh and Blood have not revealed these things to you but my Father in Heaven has revealed it father my prayer is that Lord as a group of Believers and we would understand and even an understanding that it would raise an excitement it will raise a level of joy to be able to hear the word presented in this manner Lord that it will become clear to us what you have called us to it as as you just even showed me it was your grace that allowed the prophet not to go to Israel you were thinking about us you knew that we would be gathered here today and had he gone to Israel had they believed it would have been all over for the Gentiles but you stopped him because you loved us so much help us now to fall in love with you and to fall in love with your word to become with this one with this word to receive it with all of our hearts may we not be deceived but with the enemies trying to do in this hour and Lord if there's one that maybe have walked away from this truth and they hear this word may they be like The Prodigal Son God made it come back from uh eating that uh denomination of meals and eating in pig pens and Lord whatever it is that they're out there they know they're in their father's house it's it's much better food than that so may they come Lord forth and father may we be like the the father of the prodigal son ready to receive them with open arms and not be like the brother who refused to go into the celebration because of what his brother had done it's the spirit in the land it's the devil in the land that's trying to confuse the people so we bind that Spirit right now in the name of Jesus and Lord May Revelation flow fresh from the Throne of God to our hearts of the people that they will recognize you by scripture [Music] let them see it God we ask that you would Bless the people God
