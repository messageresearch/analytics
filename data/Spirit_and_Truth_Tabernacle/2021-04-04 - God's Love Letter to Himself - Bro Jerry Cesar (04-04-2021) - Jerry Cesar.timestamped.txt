[18:52] assemble ourselves together and you know
[18:56] every moment no matter what we're going

[18:59] it's a reminder that life lives within

[19:54] god you took the sting out of death lord
[19:56] and now god we can proclaim your victory
[19:58] father
[19:59] lord we thank you this morning for your

[20:13] this morning lord
[20:15] you know every sickness father and lord
[20:17] god wherever life is
[20:19] death cannot reign wherever light is
[20:22] darkness has to flee
[20:23] so father we we just bind every spirit
[20:26] lord
[20:27] we bind every work of the enemy lord we
[20:30] bind every work of the
[20:31] devil lord god you will take control

[20:35] oh jesus may you take control of every
[20:38] spirit lord god that it would abide by
[20:40] your spirit father

[20:44] you all the praise
[20:45] honor and glory in the name of jesus
[20:48] christ we pray
[20:49] amen thank you
[20:54] [Music]
[20:58] i am very grateful to be here this
[21:00] morning thank you magicians
[21:03] uh the devil certainly uh certainly
[21:06] fought me
[21:06] as hard as he could but he is victorious
[21:10] and because he's victorious i'm
[21:12] victorious
[21:12] and that's why we can be here this
[21:14] morning i have a little thought that the
[21:17] lord put in my heart
[21:18] and i trust it'll be a blessing to you
[21:21] i'm very
[21:22] grateful as well that my wife and my
[21:24] daughter could be here with us
[21:26] it is the first time that they're here
[21:28] while i'm behind the pulpit
[21:30] so god is certainly great uh great and
[21:33] he's deserving of all glory we thank him
[21:35] for that
[21:37] now if you would just turn your bibles
[21:39] with me
[21:45] we're going to start reading in the book
[21:47] of john
[21:51] the first chapter
[21:58] and how many been enjoying the services
[22:00] thus far
[22:02] you know it's uh it's quite it's quite
[22:04] the the challenge to
[22:06] you know have to go behind those
[22:08] precious brothers but i trust the lord
[22:10] will speak something to our hearts i
[22:11] believe it was
[22:12] brother perry greene that said uh he
[22:15] just wants to add emphasis on what was
[22:17] already said
[22:19] so i just want to add a little emphasis
[22:21] on what was said already
[22:24] now the first chapter of john
[22:28] starting with the first verse it says
[22:31] in the beginning was the word
[22:35] and the word was with god and the word
[22:38] was god
[22:40] the same was in the beginning with god
[22:42] all things were made by him
[22:44] and without him was nothing was not
[22:47] anything made that was made
[22:49] and him was life in the life was the
[22:51] light of men
[22:53] and the light shineth in darkness and
[22:55] the darkness
[22:56] comprehended it not and let us also turn
[22:59] to genesis the first chapter
[23:02] we'll start at the 26th verse
[23:06] two verses there verse 26 says
[23:10] and god said let us make man
[23:14] in our image after our likeness
[23:17] and let them have dominion over the fish
[23:20] of the sea
[23:21] and over the fowl of the air and over
[23:23] the cattle and over all the earth and
[23:25] over
[23:25] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[23:28] the earth
[23:29] so god created man in his own image and
[23:32] the image of god
[23:33] created he him male and female
[23:36] created he them and god blessed him and
[23:39] god said unto them be fruitful
[23:41] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[23:44] subdue it and have dominion over the
[23:46] fish of the sea
[23:47] and over the fowl of the air and over
[23:49] every living thing that moveth
[23:51] upon the earth may the lord add a
[23:53] blessing to his reading
[23:55] you may have your seeds now
[23:58] this was this was the domain for man
[24:03] when
[24:05] god created man his own image this was
[24:08] his vision
[24:09] that he would replicate himself through
[24:12] man
[24:13] now i like how it says in john the first
[24:16] chapter there
[24:17] we notice in the beginning was the word
[24:20] and the word was with god and the word
[24:23] was god
[24:24] and what i like about that is
[24:29] here we see that the very thing that was
[24:32] with god
[24:33] was the very thing that god was all
[24:36] right and the very thing that you're
[24:37] with this morning is the very thing that
[24:39] you
[24:39] are all right now i want to use as a
[24:42] title
[24:44] god's love letter to himself
[24:48] now the prophet says here in the pro in
[24:51] the message
[24:52] the end sign 1953 june 6
[24:56] he says say there's a little between the
[24:59] line you have to read in the bible
[25:01] do you believe that see it's a love
[25:04] letter
[25:05] wrote to the church there's no need of
[25:07] seminary trying to teach it because it's
[25:09] not known by any minds of this world
[25:11] i've hid it from the eyes and wise and
[25:13] prudent and it will reveal it to babes
[25:15] such as we'll learn
[25:16] it's true so that's the reason we got
[25:18] all these different forms of
[25:19] kinds of religions and churches it's all
[25:21] right let it go
[25:23] he's the one that takes care of the
[25:24] books look notice
[25:27] though how it was let me give you a
[25:29] little a little something between the
[25:30] line you know sometimes i get away
[25:32] overseas i'm very fond of my wife and
[25:35] she writes me a letter
[25:36] and she says dear billy i'm sitting here
[25:38] tonight
[25:39] i'm thinking very much of you i'm so and
[25:41] so now
[25:42] that's what she's saying but i'm reading
[25:45] between right between the lines
[25:47] i know it goes a little deeper than that
[25:49] uh-huh
[25:50] and if you've got the holy spirit you're
[25:52] in love with christ you can read between
[25:54] god's line
[25:55] there's something in there and this
[25:58] morning i'm trusting that god will show
[26:00] us what's in there
[26:01] right now in between the lines now you
[26:04] see
[26:05] a love letter is it's an expression
[26:08] it's an expression of god's attributes
[26:10] and if you write a love letter to
[26:12] someone else then
[26:13] it's your expression of what attributes
[26:15] you your
[26:16] is in yourself whether it's your
[26:18] emotions feelings but
[26:20] you're writing a love letter now to get
[26:22] the attention of the person you're
[26:23] writing it to me
[26:24] now god had a love letter now if we go
[26:28] back to the beginning
[26:29] uh and now god had a love letter he had
[26:32] a purpose
[26:33] now when god created man he created man
[26:36] in his own image
[26:38] now the reason why he created men his
[26:40] own image because
[26:41] god wanted to manifest more of himself
[26:45] through the creation of man right now
[26:48] god created many things but it was man
[26:50] was the only time that he came
[26:52] and he said it is not good he said
[26:55] everything was good through all the days
[26:56] but he said it is not good that man
[26:58] which should be alone
[26:59] and he saw that it was fitting for a man
[27:02] to have a help me
[27:04] so when matt was created here notice he
[27:07] said
[27:07] male and female created he them
[27:10] now he created both male and family
[27:13] spirit in the man
[27:15] now the prophet says here
[27:21] g this is the this is a message
[27:23] believers
[27:24] thou this
[27:28] i i i i kind of had to to to take part
[27:31] of that same
[27:31] fish brother cho was talking about
[27:34] now the prophet said um
[27:38] now a verse uh paragraph 78
[27:41] he says now jesus said in john i believe
[27:44] the 15th chapter
[27:46] i am divine ye are the branches well now
[27:49] if the vine put forth the first branch
[27:52] and out of that branch wrote a book of
[27:54] acts the second branch will make another
[27:56] book of acts
[27:57] the third branch will make another book
[27:59] of acts and every branch that comes out
[28:01] of the vine will be the same as the
[28:03] first
[28:04] branch now you can't graft what we know
[28:07] that
[28:08] i've seen a citrus tree with about eight
[28:10] different kind of fruits on it i've i've
[28:12] seen a always tree
[28:13] put grapefruits and lemons and
[28:15] everything else on it but they were
[28:16] drafted
[28:17] that's what's the matter today we
[28:19] drafted our ideas drafted our
[28:20] denomination
[28:21] but if that tree ever puts forth another
[28:24] vine itself it'll be like the original
[28:28] ones that it went into
[28:30] and you see the purpose of god writing
[28:33] of
[28:33] a love letter is the question that who
[28:36] was he writing a letter to
[28:38] now it sounds strange that he would
[28:39] write a letter to himself
[28:41] but you have to know who where god is
[28:44] now you see god is both the root and
[28:46] offspring
[28:48] now and because he's both rooted in
[28:50] offspring he has
[28:51] he has within him those that were
[28:54] dwelling in him before the foundation of
[28:56] the earth
[28:57] and now you see the the scripture says i
[28:59] am divine and ye
[29:01] are the branches but after every branch
[29:04] that bears
[29:05] forth it has to be just like the
[29:07] original now this
[29:08] thought was ex was inspired by a little
[29:11] uh a little project i was working on
[29:14] uh by the grace of god by the grace of
[29:16] god uh the lord
[29:18] uh opened up a tremendous opportunity
[29:21] for me and my family to be first-time
[29:22] homeowners
[29:24] and we're very happy for that and i was
[29:26] working on a project i don't know too
[29:28] much about doing things
[29:30] in the home but i i know i had to get my
[29:31] hands a little dirty
[29:33] so we we had some blinds and in these
[29:35] blinds
[29:37] i had to uh uh the it was it was the
[29:40] patio the patio door and we didn't have
[29:42] any uh any blinds or anything of that
[29:44] nature so i bought the blinds and
[29:46] and it wasn't the right fitting so i i
[29:49] went ahead and i installed it i
[29:50] put all the screws in and now it came
[29:53] part
[29:54] to uh cut the blinds because the blinds
[29:56] were too long
[29:58] the length of the blind were too long
[29:59] for the patio so i said okay well i have
[30:02] to choose one
[30:03] and based on that one i have to cut it
[30:05] perfectly
[30:06] so it could be within that within the
[30:08] perfect dimension
[30:09] of the patio so i went ahead and cut it
[30:12] and i told my wife well you know honey
[30:14] just help me out and
[30:16] based on this original uh blind we're
[30:19] gonna go ahead and use that one
[30:21] to do all the other ones so i went ahead
[30:23] and i just i did just that
[30:25] and uh you know my my wife started
[30:27] helping me out
[30:28] and you know strangely she she decided
[30:31] to say uh
[30:32] when when i noticed she handed me back
[30:34] she would i would cut one
[30:35] she would give me she'll give me the one
[30:37] that i that i just did
[30:39] and after maybe a few she gave me the
[30:42] original
[30:43] and then i said you know uh honey let
[30:46] let's just continue with the original
[30:47] let's let's not use
[30:50] let's not use what what the replica of
[30:53] the original let's just stay with the
[30:55] original
[30:56] now you know that was my idea and that's
[30:59] i i said and i was i was telling her the
[31:01] spiritual application to when it like we
[31:03] got to stay with the original
[31:04] we got to stay with the root and we
[31:07] praise the lord for that
[31:09] and maybe halfway through the cutting
[31:11] probably some 20 blinds halfway through
[31:13] the blinds
[31:14] um i ended up i ended up um i ended up
[31:18] cutting
[31:19] i ended up cutting the original a little
[31:21] too short
[31:22] and it was an accident i was like oh my
[31:24] and and
[31:25] all of a sudden i was like you know what
[31:27] um you know i'm gonna go ahead and the
[31:29] one that i use
[31:31] to cut the original with that one was
[31:34] pretty much perfect
[31:35] so at that point you know i switch rows
[31:38] a little bit
[31:39] i use the original is what i had
[31:43] the originals what i had to put back and
[31:45] i switch froze now i told my wife well
[31:47] i'm like honey this is perfect
[31:49] right because this is the way it's
[31:52] supposed to be
[31:53] you know now it's the same thing with
[31:56] jesus christ
[31:57] now when he went to mount
[31:59] transfiguration now
[32:00] he he had to change rose a little bit
[32:03] now god told him
[32:04] this is my beloved son right here he him
[32:08] and you see he had to be tested he had
[32:11] to be proven
[32:12] he had to be cut and you know what ended
[32:14] up happening
[32:15] is based on that original based on all
[32:18] the other ones that was cut
[32:19] the other one was able to stand a test
[32:22] and to be
[32:22] just like the original and you see
[32:25] whatever you're going through this
[32:26] morning
[32:27] you've been cut by the different trials
[32:29] by the different tests
[32:30] by the different things but god is
[32:32] purging you so you can be just like the
[32:34] original
[32:36] praise the lord and you see i kept going
[32:39] on
[32:40] and we continue using that and you see
[32:45] praise the lord
[32:48] [Music]
[32:50] praise the lord and and you see
[32:54] that's that's god's purpose when when
[32:57] when
[32:57] when when god is is working in you
[33:00] sometimes it's not seeming or
[33:04] or or appealing to the eyes of the of
[33:06] the wise
[33:07] or the prudent but because you're the
[33:09] word you're supposed to be understood
[33:12] by humility now
[33:16] now brother branham preaches a message
[33:20] preaches a message the masterpiece
[33:23] and you know in the masterpiece he said
[33:25] so much i'm gonna try to dig in there a
[33:27] little bit
[33:28] but he he he talks about this the
[33:31] sculpture
[33:32] that michelangelo uh uh sculpted right
[33:35] and he was so inspired i mean he he
[33:38] it was it was moses uh you know uh and
[33:41] he was so inspired when he
[33:43] when he did the sculpture he saw what
[33:46] the what the sculpture came to be
[33:48] it was so identical to his vision
[33:51] and you know and you know even in that
[33:54] because it was so identical to his
[33:55] vision
[33:56] he was stepping in to something that he
[33:59] saw before
[34:00] and you see because he was able to see
[34:04] that
[34:04] he said speak and when he said speak
[34:08] he was so inspired that he chipped the
[34:11] knee of moses
[34:12] and you see i wanted to tell you this
[34:14] morning whatever you're going through
[34:16] speak to your situation speak
[34:21] [Applause]
[34:21] [Music]
[34:24] the prophet says something here this is
[34:27] in the message
[34:28] the word became flesh he said
[34:32] now that's how this is preached in 1954
[34:36] october 3rd the word became flesh
[34:39] paragraph 174 now that's how he said
[34:43] first he thought and he spoke the word
[34:46] and the word was made manifest and how
[34:48] infallible god is
[34:50] notice every thought when it's spoken
[34:52] when jesus
[34:54] no wonder when he come off the hill that
[34:56] night and looked around the tree for
[34:57] food there was no food for there was no
[34:59] fruit on the tree
[35:00] and he said no man eateth from thee and
[35:02] he went on away
[35:04] and the next day coming back the tree
[35:06] had withered
[35:07] god's mind the mind that in the
[35:08] beginning that was a
[35:10] thought before it was a word that
[35:13] expressed jesus christ the same one was
[35:15] expressing
[35:16] that word back again see and every word
[35:20] in the bible is god's thoughts
[35:22] laying in c form that if received into
[35:26] the human being and spoke by the same
[35:28] thought that materialized
[35:30] the bible brings the thing to pass see
[35:32] what i mean
[35:33] how powerful could the church be the
[35:36] bible said let this mind that was in
[35:38] christ being you
[35:39] as a man think of his heart so is he now
[35:42] your thoughts
[35:43] now paragraph 177 says this is
[35:46] this is what strike me says god said let
[35:49] there be a world
[35:51] before it could be a word it had to be a
[35:53] thought
[35:54] so god in the creation created the world
[35:58] by his thought first
[36:01] then spoken and the thought expressed
[36:05] became material
[36:06] so you see what i want to tell you is
[36:08] whatever you're going through created in
[36:10] your mind even now
[36:12] and then speak it and god will back it
[36:14] up
[36:16] because you are god's attributes
[36:19] you are god himself amen
[36:23] and amen through the through the message
[36:25] masterpiece
[36:27] brother branham continues to speak about
[36:30] this sculpture
[36:31] of michelangelo and and and and he
[36:34] he he was so inspired and and he
[36:36] eventually
[36:37] you know he had a chip on the sculpture
[36:40] but
[36:40] it's it strike brother branham he said
[36:42] to him that's what made it perfect
[36:45] that's what made it a masterpiece now
[36:49] he went again he he certainly went on to
[36:52] to type that
[36:53] with the word and he says here in
[36:55] paragraph 47
[36:56] in the message masterpiece he says but
[37:00] finally there came forth upon the earth
[37:03] a perfection and that was a man
[37:06] and then he could see in that man that
[37:09] it
[37:10] looked like him so now when he looked
[37:12] upon him he was a reflection of what the
[37:15] creator was
[37:16] god had now been able to achieve the
[37:18] thing that he wanted
[37:20] a man in his own image
[37:23] and then i might say to this that when
[37:25] he made this man there was something
[37:28] about him
[37:28] yet that look that didn't look just
[37:30] right because he was by himself
[37:33] and that's how god had been by himself
[37:36] he was the eternal
[37:38] and the man now in the image of god also
[37:40] existed on the earth by himself
[37:42] so he must have struck the little bow
[37:44] over on his left side
[37:46] and from there he took the peace
[37:49] that struck off of it and made him a
[37:52] helpmate a wife
[37:53] then he was it by himself he had
[37:56] somebody with him
[37:57] and that his that is his great work
[38:00] he as any great sculpture would take his
[38:04] masterpiece
[38:05] and now we see we see this setting here
[38:08] and as
[38:08] god formulate this masterpiece man in
[38:11] his own image
[38:12] any time a sculpture would create a
[38:15] masterpiece
[38:16] they would never cr they would never
[38:18] sculpt something just to hide it
[38:20] they would sculpt it to put it in
[38:22] display and
[38:23] the the the place in which god wanted to
[38:26] place men was in the garden of eden and
[38:29] the the domain of man in the garden of
[38:32] eden was that he had dominion
[38:34] over everything of all the fat the
[38:37] fishes of the sea over
[38:38] the fowls of the air of the cattle um
[38:41] and
[38:41] most important thing is he was god
[38:44] himself
[38:45] in the garden of eden right god told him
[38:47] to be fruitful to multiply and replenish
[38:50] the earth
[38:51] and now we see all way back then
[38:55] the devil all has always been fighting
[38:57] god's masterpiece
[38:59] and god's masterpiece is
[39:02] through the ages from the from the very
[39:06] creation of man
[39:07] um through the different prophets now
[39:10] the
[39:10] brother brennan tells us that the
[39:12] foundation
[39:14] of the masterpiece of god is the
[39:16] patriarchs
[39:18] the foundation it was love grace
[39:21] it was faith it was perfection starting
[39:24] with abraham going all the way on to
[39:26] joseph
[39:27] and now through the different church
[39:29] ages we also
[39:30] see that uh uh the word has
[39:33] always been in a trial
[39:36] and the reason why is because the word
[39:39] had to
[39:40] always be able to stand the test and the
[39:42] word
[39:43] will always stand the test and now we
[39:46] find ourselves
[39:49] in this age and we are
[39:52] not in little the seal we are in the
[39:55] bright age
[39:57] and now given where we're at
[40:02] we find that brother branham
[40:06] states a few things here but we find
[40:07] that the
[40:09] l leonishin age was the only age that
[40:12] kicked christ out of the church where
[40:14] christ now has found himself
[40:16] on the outside knocking to get back in
[40:19] now in the bride christ
[40:22] has not only entered into the bride's
[40:25] heart but christ has become the bride
[40:28] you see christ has become one with
[40:31] his with his wife and because of this
[40:35] when we can go back and read john the
[40:38] first chapter
[40:40] and it says in the beginning was the
[40:42] word and the word was with god and the
[40:44] word was god
[40:45] was almost as though i could say in the
[40:47] beginning was sister erica
[40:49] and sister eric was with brother jack
[40:51] and sister erica
[40:53] became brother jack you see mr ecker was
[40:56] brother jack
[40:57] because she is duff she bears the same
[41:00] name
[41:01] and because she bears the same name she
[41:03] has the same authority
[41:04] and because you bear the same name as
[41:06] christ this morning you have the same
[41:08] authority
[41:09] so whatever you whatever you're in need
[41:11] of speak the word
[41:13] and god will back it up whatever you're
[41:15] in need of whether it's
[41:16] whether it's healing your body whether
[41:19] it's family
[41:20] speak the word and god will back it up
[41:23] you see
[41:23] you have the ability to create and as
[41:26] you
[41:27] manifest that god will multiply himself
[41:30] in you right perfecting his eternal
[41:33] attributes
[41:36] amen amen
[41:41] we find ourselves on easter sunday
[41:44] and and and you know all through this
[41:48] time it is striking to me that
[41:51] uh you know that when when they looked
[41:54] at
[41:55] jesus they could find no fault in him
[41:58] but yet they saw him
[42:02] as the one that had to pay the penalty
[42:06] now when jesus was at the cross
[42:10] they oh mockingham they were telling him
[42:13] to do certain things
[42:14] you know um i i believe brother kweku
[42:17] might have mentioned
[42:18] uh uh how he was a baby and he was
[42:20] running
[42:21] you know the very god the very creator
[42:23] of the world now he
[42:24] he the god of of creation was on the
[42:27] cross being mocked
[42:28] by by just in almost anybody and now
[42:32] they were telling him well if you're
[42:33] really god come down
[42:35] you know prove yourself prove yourself
[42:38] if you're really god
[42:40] but you see god was not interested in
[42:42] coming down
[42:43] god was interested in coming up from a
[42:45] grave
[42:46] you see and now the god in you is not
[42:49] interested in staying down
[42:51] so whatever you're going through he
[42:52] wants you to come up he wants you to be
[42:54] elevated
[42:55] he wants you to be increased in your
[42:58] finances
[42:59] increase in your health increase in your
[43:02] material being
[43:03] increased in all capacity that's what
[43:06] god is interested in
[43:07] he wanted to come up from the grave and
[43:09] that was the point in time we could come
[43:12] this morning
[43:12] and say he is risen because you see when
[43:15] he got there
[43:16] they noticed that something was
[43:17] different it said well he was in a grave
[43:19] and now he's not
[43:21] now where what happened here you see god
[43:24] was able to
[43:25] show that he was still god yeah he was a
[43:27] man when he weep when lazarus was dead
[43:29] but he was gone when he said
[43:31] lazarus come forth you see he was a man
[43:35] when he was hungry
[43:36] but he was god when he fed five
[43:38] thousands you see now my question to you
[43:41] is
[43:41] what kind of jesus lives in you is it
[43:44] the man of jesus
[43:45] or is the god of jesus what jesus lives
[43:48] in you
[43:48] because if it's the god jesus then you
[43:51] have the same authority he does
[43:53] if the same spirit that raised up jesus
[43:55] from the dead dwelling you
[43:57] he shall quicken your mortal bodies
[44:08] amen now the prophet
[44:12] goes on to say here yeah glory
[44:16] this is in the same message the
[44:18] masterpiece
[44:19] he says this is paragraph 125 going down
[44:22] a little bit there
[44:24] he says now pentecostal brethren
[44:26] throughout the nations i want you to
[44:28] listen my brother
[44:29] if this is the last message i'll ever
[44:31] preach this is my masterpiece
[44:33] do you notice when the wheat the corn of
[44:36] the wheat that falls into the ground
[44:38] when it begins to come back to its grain
[44:40] again
[44:41] watch nature nature exactly is god god
[44:44] working in nature
[44:46] it's all he can but from the pentecostal
[44:50] revival
[44:51] as they think was the seed it wasn't now
[44:53] watch
[44:54] but something came forth just like the
[44:56] seed
[44:57] now watch what jesus said in saint
[44:59] matthew 24
[45:00] that the two spirits at the last day
[45:02] would be so close together till it would
[45:05] deceive the very elect
[45:06] if if possible now that stalk don't
[45:10] look nothing like a seed neither does
[45:12] the tassel look like a seed but notice
[45:14] now
[45:15] in luther's day but not in luther's day
[45:17] but in a last day
[45:18] the first thing there is wheat farmer
[45:22] sitting here
[45:23] the first thing there that comes forth
[45:25] on a wheat seed
[45:27] you will you will think you would almost
[45:29] think that it was a seed
[45:30] but it's the husk it forms a little
[45:33] outside thing like to hold the seed
[45:36] it forms a husk but the husk is not the
[45:38] seed no more than the tassel
[45:40] or the stalk it's only a carrier of life
[45:43] the corn of the wheat then um
[45:47] he goes on to say in paragraph 130
[45:51] he said the pentecostal come out just
[45:54] like the wheat went
[45:56] each one comes out from the other coming
[45:59] out from the other but
[46:00] they're only a carrier they go to
[46:02] denomination and that's what pentecost
[46:04] did
[46:04] went to denomination and what did
[46:07] pentecost do when it come
[46:08] out just like the grain it went right
[46:10] back just like in revelation 17
[46:12] to one of the sister denomination that's
[46:14] exactly what
[46:15] it did and now
[46:19] it says brother brown also says the the
[46:20] greatest seed the original
[46:22] uh fell at nicaea it was the first
[46:25] denomination
[46:26] and we we find that the time that we're
[46:30] living in
[46:31] that god is perfecting himself
[46:34] in his bride right and as he's
[46:36] perfecting himself in this bride
[46:38] he's also bringing the realization of of
[46:41] of the
[46:42] ending of the dispensation of of
[46:46] this little seen age because now
[46:49] it only shows us just how how close and
[46:52] near
[46:53] we are and as
[46:56] as these as we start to see these things
[46:59] god himself
[47:00] is wanting to share his his
[47:03] being who he is with us exactly exactly
[47:06] right
[47:07] now i want to continue to read here
[47:10] this is paragraph 143
[47:15] he says how notice how noticeable this
[47:17] life
[47:18] is it it's travel in the corner of wheat
[47:22] than it is in the tree god called his
[47:24] people like a tree
[47:25] see the life goes down in a tree and
[47:28] comes back again
[47:29] goes down comes back again it goes down
[47:31] and comes back
[47:32] but in the corner of wheat it goes up
[47:35] from the original stock
[47:36] through the stock tassel in husk and the
[47:39] thing that it passed through
[47:41] dies so it can so it can't get back
[47:43] through it again
[47:44] what is it it's no use anymore it goes
[47:46] on onto
[47:48] its perfection amen don't you see why he
[47:51] never uses an organ
[47:52] organization he can't get back in again
[47:55] it's dead
[47:55] but the life passes on from one to
[47:58] another
[47:59] see they put creeds and inject whosoever
[48:02] shall add one word to the
[48:03] or take one word is blocked off from it
[48:06] it must be the life
[48:07] seed traveling and he said i'm using
[48:11] this in a parable now of the bride
[48:13] the masterpiece that's coming forth as
[48:16] the masterpiece fell
[48:17] there is a masterpiece rising the
[48:19] masterpiece fell
[48:21] at nightshare council and she's coming
[48:24] through a process
[48:25] but she is coming right back again to
[48:28] that masterpiece
[48:29] perfected because she's a part of that
[48:31] word
[48:32] that was spoken by him he'll have a
[48:34] church without spot or wrinkle
[48:36] it'll not be connected anyway with
[48:39] any kind of an organization or
[48:41] denomination the cursive thing
[48:43] it's passed through those things but it
[48:45] will never be there
[48:46] and i i want to go through a scripture
[48:49] here this is going to be
[48:50] first
[48:56] this is going to be first clock collagen
[48:59] is actually uh just collages the first
[49:00] chapter
[49:02] and we're going to start at the 16th
[49:03] verse
[49:10] now i wish to just say this statement
[49:13] just before i read into the scripture
[49:15] now god was the one who
[49:18] sent the love letter and
[49:22] he didn't only sent the love letter but
[49:24] he became the love land
[49:27] and he's also the one that the love
[49:30] letter was sent to
[49:32] now i i hope you catch that because
[49:36] the love letter is is certainly
[49:39] signifying
[49:40] everything that christ was and
[49:43] everything that christ was
[49:45] is in the beginning and in the end
[49:48] and christ all the purpose of everything
[49:51] was was so that christ
[49:52] the fullness of christ would be made
[49:55] manifest in his bride and
[49:58] the first uh chapter here in colossians
[50:01] 16th verse it says for by him were
[50:03] things were all things created
[50:06] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[50:08] visible and
[50:09] invisible whether they be thrones or
[50:12] dominions or principalities or powers
[50:15] all things were created by him and for
[50:17] him
[50:18] and he is before all things and by him
[50:21] all things consist
[50:22] and he is the head of the body
[50:26] the church who is the beginning the
[50:29] firstborn
[50:30] from the dead that in all things he
[50:33] might have the preeminence
[50:35] for it please the father that in him
[50:37] should all fullness dwell
[50:40] and having made peace through the blood
[50:42] of his cross
[50:44] by him to reconcile all things unto
[50:46] himself
[50:48] by him i say whether they be things in
[50:50] earth
[50:51] or things in heaven and you that were
[50:53] sometimes
[50:54] alienated in enemies in your mind by
[50:57] wicked works
[50:58] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[51:02] of his flesh through
[51:03] death to present you holy
[51:06] and unblameable and unreprovable
[51:09] in his sight
[51:14] now you see
[51:18] the fullness of christ reconcile
[51:22] you to him and and now the reason why
[51:25] this love letter
[51:27] is to himself is because you are christ
[51:31] now the love letter being you is to
[51:34] jesus christ
[51:37] and now the the prophet says here
[51:46] he says here let's read and uh
[51:49] the same the same message the
[51:51] masterpiece paragraph 156
[51:53] he says why must the bright groom be the
[51:58] word manifested
[51:59] made plain it's because the bride and
[52:02] the bridegroom are one she is just
[52:04] meaning she is just a smitten piece of
[52:07] him
[52:07] there is the masterpiece it was smitten
[52:10] michael michelangelo could not reproduce
[52:13] that again he could not put it back
[52:15] but god is going to do it he is going to
[52:18] bring
[52:18] this little bride that's smitten right
[52:20] back to the side of the original word
[52:23] and there he is there is the masterpiece
[52:26] the family back again in the garden of
[52:28] eden
[52:28] how is this bride going to do this he
[52:32] how is the week going to do this malachi
[52:34] 4 said
[52:35] in the last days it would be restored
[52:38] restored like back like in the beginning
[52:41] take it back
[52:42] i will restore saith the lord all the
[52:45] years the palmer worms and cake worms
[52:47] and all these other things has eaten
[52:49] i will restore it again malachi 4 said i
[52:53] he will restore the hearts of the people
[52:55] and the faith of the people back to
[52:57] original fathers again
[52:59] see we see this right before us church
[53:02] where are we at and you see over the
[53:05] week
[53:06] i was having this discussion with this
[53:08] brother
[53:09] and and and you know we still find
[53:11] people uh
[53:12] that that faults the message and
[53:16] what what was what's interesting to me
[53:18] is
[53:20] you know they they say these different
[53:21] things of of
[53:23] you know uh maybe brother branham said
[53:25] uh
[53:26] something that was already said or or or
[53:29] or he he he uh plagiarized on something
[53:32] that was already said
[53:33] uh but you know it it reminds me
[53:36] of what happened in noah's day because
[53:40] the same water that saved noah
[53:42] was the same water that destroyed the
[53:45] enemy
[53:46] and and you know we find brother branham
[53:48] his purpose was to tie the loose
[53:50] ends and that's exactly right he did say
[53:53] probably things that was already said
[53:55] but but exactly that the very purpose of
[53:58] him doing it was the fulfillment of what
[54:00] he was sent for
[54:01] and you see when we when we talk about
[54:04] you know the
[54:04] revelation chapter 10 7 saying he you
[54:07] know in the days of the uh
[54:09] in the days when the voice of the
[54:10] seventh angel will begin to sound the
[54:12] mystery of god will begin
[54:14] to to be will be finished you know the
[54:17] the thing about of that is that the
[54:20] mystery did not start in little decea
[54:22] the mystery started in genesis
[54:25] and you see brother browner was here to
[54:28] finish that mystery
[54:29] right god used the message
[54:33] to show the fullness of the bride just
[54:35] like our pastor said
[54:37] of the the mystery of of christ the
[54:40] christ was the mystery of god revealed
[54:42] the bride is the mystery of
[54:44] christ revealed now is he revealed to
[54:47] you this morning
[54:49] right because the what every mystery
[54:52] god has revealed now
[54:55] the prophet goes on to say same message
[54:59] in
[54:59] on paragraph 160 he said
[55:03] she is smitten from the church
[55:06] from the church body smitten with her
[55:08] master for the same purpose she is the
[55:11] word
[55:12] just the same as joseph was smitten from
[55:14] his brethren because
[55:15] he is he was the word and jesus was
[55:19] smitten from his brethren
[55:20] because he was the word the church is
[55:22] smearing the brightest men from the
[55:24] church because
[55:25] she is the word there is your stages
[55:28] again
[55:28] one two three see just exactly
[55:32] and you see you are the word this
[55:34] morning
[55:35] church you are the word and because you
[55:38] are the word
[55:39] you are you are you are given the
[55:43] responsibility to manifest the word
[55:46] to live the word and uh
[55:50] there's another quote i want to read
[55:52] here
[55:56] all right let's see
[56:00] okay uh
[56:04] now it says i i i'll read a paragraph
[56:07] 170
[56:09] uh 171 he said
[56:13] all true life that was
[56:16] in the stock tassel and husk is now
[56:20] gathering in the seed ready for the
[56:22] resurrection
[56:23] ready for the harvest the alpha has
[56:26] become omega
[56:27] amen the first come last and the last is
[56:30] first the seed that went
[56:32] in has come through a process and become
[56:35] the seed again
[56:36] the seed that fell in the garden of eden
[56:38] and died there come back
[56:40] from that imperfect seed that died there
[56:42] come back
[56:43] to the perfect seed the second adam
[56:46] now the first eve that fell and was used
[56:50] in the second reformation
[56:51] second coming as bringing forth a child
[56:53] now has become the true bride again
[56:56] the seed right back with the original
[56:59] word
[57:01] in paragraph
[57:07] okay i can't find this paragraph but
[57:11] as god's love letter
[57:14] i i just wanted to read
[57:17] a few things that god has said to you
[57:19] personally
[57:21] now we find ourselves
[57:25] on on thursday
[57:29] um brother choice spoke about the grace
[57:32] of god
[57:33] and bola kwaku came once on friday
[57:37] and spoke about the different easters
[57:39] that occurred in the bible
[57:40] and brothers brother uh brother smiley
[57:44] yesterday night
[57:45] was a blessing to us he spoke about the
[57:49] mighty
[57:49] and great conqueror now
[57:53] god is certainly sending a message
[57:56] and out of his love letter i i just feel
[58:00] led to say that
[58:01] the grace of god paved the way
[58:05] so that repentance could be accepted
[58:09] and now when you go to
[58:12] acts 2 it says to first repent
[58:16] and now i notice that it's
[58:20] harder than ever to get someone to uh
[58:23] uh to repent you know uh when
[58:27] when we find ourselves in any situation
[58:31] god is not able to operate
[58:34] if repentance has not been done it says
[58:36] to confess your faults one to another
[58:39] and that the prayer of the rights
[58:41] availeth much
[58:43] but you see repentance is
[58:47] a gift now but when it's gone you'll
[58:50] realize that
[58:52] you know that that is too late but god
[58:55] god
[58:55] wants every heart of the believer to be
[58:59] purged and every trial every situation
[59:03] god wants to perfect himself he wants to
[59:06] perfect himself
[59:07] in the attributes he's placed in you and
[59:10] faith and virtue and patience and
[59:13] brotherly kindness
[59:14] he wants to manifest himself in you now
[59:17] i wish to turn to john 15.
[59:29] and this is another of god's love letter
[59:33] that he's given to you directly
[59:36] now we'll read at the seventh verse
[59:41] well the sixth verse it says if a man
[59:43] abided not in me
[59:44] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[59:47] withered and men gathered them and cast
[59:49] them into the fire and they
[59:51] are burned if ye abide in me
[59:54] and my words abide in you ye shall ask
[59:57] what ye will and it shall be done unto
[1:00:00] you
[1:00:01] hearing is my father glorified that ye
[1:00:03] may bear
[1:00:04] much fruit so shall ye be my disciples
[1:00:08] as the father hath loved me so have i
[1:00:11] loved you
[1:00:12] continue ye in my love
[1:00:15] now god has given you the right to ask
[1:00:18] him
[1:00:18] whatever that whatever you have need of
[1:00:22] god has also given you the right to
[1:00:24] speak the word
[1:00:25] the word is a seed when you speak the
[1:00:27] word it
[1:00:28] is going to reproduce of itself amen
[1:00:32] and and as i close and the musicians
[1:00:34] will make their way
[1:00:36] i just read i wish to read one last
[1:00:39] quote here
[1:00:42] now the prophet said
[1:00:46] the message
[1:00:50] and from that time all right
[1:00:54] we'll start reading in paragraph
[1:00:59] 64. he says all these things
[1:01:03] there is a time when something happens
[1:01:05] and maybe
[1:01:06] all their vows and all the leagues of
[1:01:08] nation and so forth maybe
[1:01:10] had good intention but they all come to
[1:01:12] an end
[1:01:13] all become crumbling beneath the feet of
[1:01:15] man with all good intentions
[1:01:17] we could have but all must come to an
[1:01:20] end
[1:01:21] but there is a time that a man come to
[1:01:23] something that's eternal
[1:01:25] that's when a man meets god that's when
[1:01:29] something happens that's eternal
[1:01:31] we do our mistakes we have our vows on
[1:01:33] new year's night
[1:01:34] to only break them the next day we turn
[1:01:36] new pages and we assign
[1:01:38] vowels and we go to the priests but
[1:01:41] like catholics do but make confessions
[1:01:43] and sign pledges
[1:01:44] and we come to the altar and turn new
[1:01:46] pages but all in vain
[1:01:48] for the next time somebody crosses our
[1:01:50] path or something that old temple will
[1:01:52] fly right back again every time that we
[1:01:54] get into trouble or something it'll
[1:01:56] happen again
[1:01:57] but there's a place where a man can come
[1:02:00] to a time
[1:02:01] that will change him forever for eternal
[1:02:04] he that will come to me i will in no
[1:02:06] wise cash doubt
[1:02:07] said jesus a man can come to god and his
[1:02:10] whole eternal destination is changed
[1:02:13] and a man can meet god and he can never
[1:02:15] be the same anymore
[1:02:17] you can't come you can't meet god and
[1:02:19] never remain the same person he was
[1:02:21] if you were turned away from him you'll
[1:02:24] be worse person than you ever were
[1:02:26] if you received him you got eternal life
[1:02:28] and he'll raise you up at the last day
[1:02:30] by his promise and today on this easter
[1:02:33] morning
[1:02:35] we can rest knowing that if we accept
[1:02:38] what he has already done then he has
[1:02:41] promised us that
[1:02:43] he will give us eternal life and and i
[1:02:45] encourage you
[1:02:46] uh wherever you are that christ
[1:02:50] wants to do greater in your life than
[1:02:52] that has been done
[1:02:54] christ wants to fulfill himself in your
[1:02:56] life
[1:02:57] and as a brother brother as our brother
[1:02:59] said last night
[1:03:00] this is the best human life we can live
[1:03:03] on this earth
[1:03:04] you see because god god
[1:03:07] we have received the earnest of what god
[1:03:11] has
[1:03:11] prepared for us in glory and
[1:03:16] brother branham says here
[1:03:19] in this message spiritual amnesia
[1:03:23] paragraph 206 he says now
[1:03:26] look i want to ask you something what if
[1:03:30] he
[1:03:30] does come say he isn't coming i don't
[1:03:33] know whether he is or not this
[1:03:35] is the last sign remember thus
[1:03:38] saith the lord did he did you ever hear
[1:03:41] me say that but what was true you are
[1:03:44] seeing your last
[1:03:45] sign that's scriptural you've seen your
[1:03:48] last sign pentecost
[1:03:50] don't get mixed up with what he promised
[1:03:52] israel after the rapture
[1:03:53] that ain't you you're done then see now
[1:03:57] is your day now is your sign now is your
[1:04:00] time
[1:04:01] don't reject it don't do it you better
[1:04:03] come you believe me to be god's servant
[1:04:05] remember and i encourage you if you have
[1:04:08] not

[1:06:56] god bless you church
[1:07:13] we thank the lord uh for this sunrise
[1:07:16] service
[1:07:18] um and just a wonderful
[1:07:22] wonderful thought from our brother jerry
[1:07:25] this morning
[1:07:26] uh god's love letter to himself
[1:07:29] and um i mean we were created for the
[1:07:33] very purpose
[1:07:34] of uh of being his bride and you know
[1:07:38] as he was just kind of going through the
[1:07:40] uh the various quotes there in the
[1:07:42] in the masterpiece there was one that i
[1:07:43] was looking down the screen and it says
[1:07:45] that
[1:07:46] uh the bride has become the word and you
[1:07:49] know i was just thinking to myself how
[1:07:50] many churches can you go to that will
[1:07:52] pick up
[1:07:53] john chapter one uh where it says in the
[1:07:55] beginning
[1:07:56] was the word and the word was god the
[1:07:57] word was with god
[1:08:00] and um and be able to place
[1:08:04] uh be able to hear someone place you in
[1:08:07] that scripture
[1:08:08] right uh there's uh there's many that we
[1:08:11] can see where christ you know christ
[1:08:13] he came he was the word he became the
[1:08:15] you know he he became manifest in the
[1:08:17] flesh and all of that
[1:08:18] but uh the prophet was very very
[1:08:21] intentional about trying to get us to
[1:08:22] see that
[1:08:24] we are also there but the random made a
[1:08:26] statement says the word that became
[1:08:28] flesh
[1:08:29] in christ has now become your flesh
[1:08:33] can you imagine that with all your
[1:08:35] mistakes
[1:08:36] all your failures all of that but you
[1:08:39] know
[1:08:39] that scripted lady read out colossians
[1:08:41] uh he's doing this so he can present us
[1:08:43] through his blood not
[1:08:44] only through the blood he can present us
[1:08:48] unreapprovable unblameable
[1:08:52] amen and and and and like like brother
[1:08:55] troy said
[1:08:55] unbelievable grace how we thank god for
[1:08:59] this
[1:09:01] how we thank god for this it's just this
[1:09:04] just wonderful
[1:09:06] god was not interested in coming down
[1:09:09] from the cross he was interested in
[1:09:12] coming up from the grave
[1:09:14] and it says god's not interested and you
[1:09:16] stand down
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:19] he wants you to come up to elevate
[1:09:22] in your finances to elevate in your
[1:09:25] health
[1:09:26] to elevate in every area of your life
[1:09:29] lord i received that this morning i tell
[1:09:32] you i thank god for the word
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:37] i'm i i probably have to say you know
[1:09:39] just from a
[1:09:40] um
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:45] it's probably carnal for me to say this
