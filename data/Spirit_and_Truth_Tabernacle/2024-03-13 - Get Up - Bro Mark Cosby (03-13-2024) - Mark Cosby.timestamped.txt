[6:08] here I'm thankful brother Jack giv me
[6:10] the
[6:11] opportunity and uh let just bow our
[6:13] heads in word of prayer and we begin
[6:15] dear heavenly father we we've made it
[6:17] this far Lord Because of You Lord thank
[6:20] you Lord for just giving us breath in
[6:22] our bodies once again Lord just thank
[6:25] you for all the things that you've do in
[6:26] our life that we don't see or recognize
[6:28] at times
[6:30] Lord we know that you started a good
[6:31] work in US Lord and you promis to finish
[6:33] it Lord Lord may we just keep our eyes
[6:36] upon you the Mighty God the mighty
[6:39] Creator because Lord you've been so good
[6:42] to us Lord we we could write a a novel
[6:45] of the testimonies you've given us and
[6:47] the things you protected us Lord and
[6:49] Lord this evening Lord we want to just
[6:51] give ourselves into your hands Lord our
[6:54] hearts and our lives are yours Lord may
[6:56] you just speak to us in such a personal
[6:58] way Lord may you move me out the way
[7:01] Lord and may you speak to your children
[7:03] tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[7:06] amen amen a we'll turn to our Bibles in
[7:09] uh Romans chapter 13 and we'll read
[7:11] verses 11 through 13 or 11- 14 say Amen
[7:15] when you get
[7:21] there amen so the Bible says and that
[7:25] knowing the time that now it is high
[7:27] time to awake out of sleep for now is
[7:30] our Salvation nearer than when we
[7:31] believed the night is far spent the day
[7:34] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[7:37] works of darkness and let us put on the
[7:39] armor of light let us walk honestly as
[7:42] in the day not in rioting and
[7:44] drunkenness not in chambering and
[7:45] wanness not in strife and envying but
[7:48] put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make
[7:50] not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill
[7:53] the lust thereof and I look that word of
[7:55] Provisions it's the act of providing and
[7:58] making previous preparations
[8:00] so let's not try to make excuses for
[8:01] we're doing things we shouldn't be doing
[8:04] you may take your
[8:05] seats so title this little message is
[8:07] get
[8:11] up so so I think a lot of times we make
[8:14] resolutions and we make all make
[8:15] promises to God at the beginning of the
[8:16] year and then life hits us the devil
[8:18] hits us and we kind of fall down and we
[8:20] don't get up from it we don't recover
[8:22] from it so I think it's high time we get
[8:24] up the year is still young we have
[8:26] plenty of time to those spiritual goals
[8:29] you made you can still hit them don't
[8:31] let the devil overwhelm you and say well
[8:33] it's too late no it's this March so
[8:36] let's get up and and and and March March
[8:38] forward in the promises of God yes sir
[8:40] let's go to uh Ephesians chapter
[8:43] 5 and another familiar scripture and
[8:47] we'll start with verse uh 14 and the
[8:49] Bible says wherefore he saith awake thou
[8:52] that sleepest and arise from the dead
[8:54] and Christ shall give thee light so you
[8:55] notice in both scriptures it's talking
[8:57] about us waking up us being aware and
[8:59] getting up and and and and recognizing
[9:01] what God is trying to do in each one of
[9:02] our Lives verse 14 says wherefore he
[9:05] saith or 15 see then that you walk
[9:09] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[9:12] Redeeming the time because the days are
[9:15] evil we live in a very evil day where
[9:17] the devil is trying to take away our
[9:19] time any free time we have he's trying
[9:21] to eat it up so we can't spend time with
[9:23] God then if we don't spend time with God
[9:25] how we expect God to fulfill the
[9:27] promises in in his word for usen
[9:30] verse 16 or verse 17 wherefore be not
[9:32] unwise but understanding what the will
[9:34] of the Lord is and how you understand
[9:36] what the will of the Lord is is through
[9:37] prayer and the word of God because the
[9:39] will of the Lord is always going to
[9:41] dovetail with the word of God and if it
[9:43] doesn't it's not the will of the Lord
[9:45] amen it says and be not drunk with wine
[9:47] wherein is excess but be filled with the
[9:50] spirit verse I love verse 19 speaking to
[9:53] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[9:55] spiritual songs singing and making
[9:57] melody in your heart to the lord always
[9:59] putting the Lord on your mind and your
[10:00] heart that's what that's trying to tell
[10:02] us in verse 20 says giving thanks always
[10:05] doesn't say giving thanks when you want
[10:06] to or giving thanks when the times are
[10:08] good but it says giving thanks always
[10:11] unto God and the father in the name of
[10:13] our Lord Jesus Christ amen so it's time
[10:17] we get back in Step our pastors been
[10:20] preaching us where we get back in Step
[10:22] so restoration can happen not only in
[10:23] our church but in our personal lives as
[10:25] well but we got to get in step in line
[10:27] of God's word cuz God is can't fulfill
[10:30] anything unless you get in line first
[10:32] you got to play your part first and then
[10:34] God is going to move and and make things
[10:37] happen it's time for us to get up and
[10:39] fight the good fight of faith we got to
[10:41] fight that good fight of faith and Faith
[10:44] isn't something that's just it falls
[10:45] into your lap but you got to fight every
[10:47] inch for it because we're going against
[10:49] a devil who wants to take your faith
[10:51] away and the only way he can take it
[10:52] away if he get you to compromise with
[10:54] the word of God so we got to take the
[10:56] word of God we got to eat it we got we
[10:58] got to sleep we got to breathe it we got
[11:00] to manifest it sir amen we got to take
[11:03] back what's rightfully ours see the
[11:05] devil is trying to take things that
[11:06] aren't his he he's a defeated creature
[11:08] so don't let him take those things from
[11:10] you your healing is yours God is giving
[11:13] it to you your deliverance God is given
[11:15] to you Financial Freedom God is giv it
[11:17] to you but you got to claim it and say
[11:19] devil this is mine yes sir amen we got
[11:24] to get up we got to get up and March
[11:25] back in the line of the word sir you may
[11:28] have faltered you may have falling but
[11:29] if a righteous man falls seven times he
[11:31] get back up we've come too far to to to
[11:34] give up we've come too far not to get up
[11:37] again cuz we're going to fall in falter
[11:39] but we got to get up and move forward
[11:40] learn from the mistakes that you made
[11:42] and keep moving forward and marching
[11:44] right let's go to Romans chapter
[11:50] 10 amen so the Bible
[11:55] says in chapter 10:
[11:57] 8 says says but what saith it the word
[12:01] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[12:03] thy heart that is the word of faith
[12:05] which we preach it's not my words but
[12:07] it's God's words that's what we preach
[12:09] that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[12:11] mouth the Lord Jesus notice doesn't just
[12:13] stop there you can't just have an empty
[12:15] confession something has to follow that
[12:17] confession and it says and thou shalt
[12:19] believe in thy heart that God hath
[12:21] raised him from the dead thou shall be
[12:24] saved so if you truly believe that then
[12:27] you are going to be saved yes sir but
[12:28] you got got to believe that not just
[12:30] from not empty confession but you got to
[12:32] believe it from the heart you got you
[12:33] got to believe it personally for
[12:34] yourself it has to be revealed to you
[12:36] personally verse uh let's go to verse n
[12:39] or verse 10 for with the heart man
[12:41] believeth unto righteousness not not
[12:43] intellectual but unto the heart unto
[12:45] righteousness and with the mouth
[12:47] confession is made unto salvation right
[12:50] amen verse 11 for the scripture saith
[12:52] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[12:54] ashamed for there's no difference
[12:56] between the Jew and the Greek for the
[12:58] same Lord Lord over all is Rich unto all
[13:01] that call upon Him of mercy so we think
[13:03] about that you don't have to be a
[13:04] certain race you don't have to be a
[13:05] certain uh Prestige or a certain
[13:08] education level but God is looking at
[13:10] the heart yes sir so you don't have to
[13:12] worry about God being respected persons
[13:15] all we have to do is line up what he's
[13:16] calling us to line up in as God is
[13:18] showing you light you want to follow in
[13:20] that light because God isn't obligated
[13:22] to give you any more light until you
[13:24] follow the light he's already given you
[13:26] so we got to walk in the light as he's
[13:27] leading Us in the light yes sir amen
[13:30] let's keep it going how then shall they
[13:32] call on him in whom they have not
[13:34] believed so how are we going to claim a
[13:37] promise if we don't believe that God can
[13:39] fulfill that promise in our life see you
[13:41] got to play the part of Faith it's
[13:42] simple faith is simple just take God of
[13:45] his word and let go yes sir that's
[13:47] literally what you got to do a lot of
[13:49] times we want to have control of the
[13:51] situation and wonder why God can't move
[13:53] God's hands are tied if you don't let
[13:55] him in the situation right all right
[13:59] how then shall they call on him if they
[14:01] have not believed and how shall they
[14:02] believe in him of whom they shall not
[14:03] heard how should they hear without a
[14:05] preacher so you got all these ministers
[14:07] coming and preaching the word upon the
[14:09] pulpit brother Jack and all the pastor
[14:11] and if you don't believe that that word
[14:12] is for you how can ever benefit you
[14:14] personally your life don't make it so
[14:17] see God every time we go into God's
[14:19] presence he has something special for us
[14:22] God doesn't do things just to do things
[14:24] but he does things with a perfect
[14:26] purpose and his purpose is to give life
[14:28] to you to give you guidance to give you
[14:30] Revelation to help you get in line with
[14:33] the word of God but we got to have ears
[14:35] to hear and our heart to receive and we
[14:37] can't have those things unless we have a
[14:40] strong prayer life and I I think a lot
[14:42] of times in these days and ages we just
[14:45] we pray to pray sometimes I said that
[14:47] before but we got to pray with a purpose
[14:50] ask yourself why am I praying right now
[14:53] am I just praying just to to get it out
[14:55] the way or am I praying to meet with the
[14:57] very creator of Heaven see we don't
[14:59] that's how pre it is to pray it's
[15:01] literally the greatest thing that is put
[15:03] in the hands of mankind is a true
[15:05] sincere prayer to offer to God God has
[15:07] given you that gift to use it that
[15:09] weapon to use it so we got to utilize
[15:12] that weapon it's like it's like having a
[15:15] a bazooka but not have not using the
[15:17] bullets to fire it it's not going to do
[15:19] you any good right or having a car
[15:21] without an engine you ain't going to go
[15:23] nowhere yes sir right let's keep going
[15:25] verse 15 how should they preach except
[15:27] they be sent as it written how beautiful
[15:29] for the feet of them that preach the
[15:30] gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings
[15:32] of good things but they have all not
[15:34] obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayith Lord
[15:37] whom hath believed by report so then
[15:39] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[15:43] the word of God that's the key right
[15:45] there that that's the key scripture
[15:47] right there for us that we got to hear
[15:48] the voice of God personing for ourselves
[15:51] don't just assume you're hearing the
[15:52] voice of God but make sure you're
[15:54] hearing the voice of God because there's
[15:56] so many spirits out there trying to
[15:57] sound like God you want to make sure
[15:59] that it dovetails with the word of God
[16:01] that's your year in a Thum right there
[16:03] right amen so if we can't believe that
[16:06] God can move in a current situation
[16:08] right now how are we going to believe
[16:09] for restoration if you can't believe
[16:11] that God can take control whatever's
[16:13] going around in your household
[16:14] whatever's going around in your personal
[16:15] life in work how can you believe that
[16:17] God can give you restoration in your
[16:18] life they go hand in hand so you got to
[16:20] believe God in all areas of your life
[16:22] not just the areas you want to believe
[16:24] but you got to believe God in all areas
[16:26] because he's a God who can move in every
[16:29] single thing Small Things big things
[16:31] they don't matter to God he can move
[16:33] upon those situations but you got to let
[16:35] let him move have faith that he can move
[16:37] we all have testimonies of God moving in
[16:39] our lives then why can't we believe that
[16:41] God can move in our life this right now
[16:43] moment so we got to stop limiting God
[16:47] don't put God in some box he's
[16:49] omnipresent he's everywhere so let God
[16:53] do things see there's a Red Sea that's
[16:55] in front of you but you got to let God
[16:57] don't just cry about it speak speak and
[17:00] move forward that's what God is waiting
[17:02] for he said why cry speak so you speak
[17:05] to
[17:06] that amen amen so we got we got to
[17:10] believe that restoration is for his
[17:12] person God can only operate on the basis
[17:14] of Faith you remember when Jesus uh had
[17:17] to pass by this town because there was
[17:19] no faith it was all unbelief and Jesus
[17:21] had to pass by because an unbelief so
[17:24] sometimes God has to pass by our way
[17:26] because of our unbelief I like that song
[17:28] pass me not no Gentle Savior so as he's
[17:31] passing by this evening don't let him
[17:33] pass you by say Lord what is you have
[17:35] for me tonight Lord I want to hear your
[17:37] voice I need to hear your voice it's
[17:40] it's it's better than life to me I need
[17:42] it you see desperation is a something we
[17:45] need to have in in this day and age
[17:47] because each year each year goes by this
[17:49] world gets wickeder and wickeder we see
[17:52] politics all these things getting
[17:53] wickeder and we got to stay that stand
[17:56] that much closer to God to keep him by
[17:59] side amen amen
[18:01] amen amen so God operates by faith in
[18:05] his word and guing his word or one we
[18:07] you can't have one or the other if you
[18:09] have God you got to have his word you
[18:10] can't pick and choose what scriptures
[18:12] you want you got to take the whole Bible
[18:13] you may not certain things might hurt
[18:15] and cut a little bit but you need that
[18:18] that's how the growth happens if I'm if
[18:20] I'm working out if I'm working out in
[18:21] the gym then when I'm working out I'm
[18:23] actually hurting my muscles so they can
[18:24] grow so the same thing in our spiritual
[18:26] walk God has to cut certain things off
[18:28] of us so we can grow see see pain equals
[18:32] growth if it if it doesn't challenge you
[18:34] it won't change you I'm say it again if
[18:36] it doesn't challenge you it won't change
[18:38] you and that's why God knows exactly the
[18:40] words we need in due season and we got
[18:43] to receive those words in due season
[18:45] don't take an offense to it just say
[18:47] Lord thank you for speaking to me even a
[18:50] know from God is a blessing cuz God is
[18:52] speaking to
[18:54] you God knows how to protect you and
[18:56] shield you for certain things see we try
[18:58] we try to get into certain things and
[19:00] say and trying to make something that's
[19:01] not the will of God and we wind up wind
[19:03] up in the permissible will of God and we
[19:05] wonder why it's like with balum he he he
[19:09] said let me uh let me go and curse
[19:11] Israel he's like no I can't let you do
[19:12] that and he said all right go on ahead
[19:14] and he couldn't curse Israel one
[19:16] time
[19:18] amen so he said before we can't have God
[19:21] without his word so we got to believe
[19:22] that God can make a way out of your
[19:24] current situation right now we all have
[19:26] unspoken we all have unsaved loved ones
[19:28] we all have issues in our family
[19:30] whatever it is we got to believe that
[19:32] God can take us out of that current
[19:33] situation and make life into it see
[19:35] we're amateur creators we God has given
[19:38] us authority to speak life in the
[19:40] situation to speak peace you got to
[19:42] create an atmosphere that God can move
[19:44] in how do you expect God to move in an
[19:45] atmosphere that's not pleasing unto
[19:48] him God God doesn't dwell in an
[19:50] atmosphere of unbelief an atmosphere of
[19:52] Discord he he dwells in an atmosphere of
[19:55] unity so we had to make sure where they
[19:57] were in line with the word of God we're
[19:59] unified with the word of God we got to
[20:01] say Lord I know the situation isn't how
[20:03] I want it to be right now but Lord I
[20:05] know you can change it right now I know
[20:07] this use me to help bring change in my
[20:09] family help bring change in my workplace
[20:12] see we got to get serious now I don't
[20:14] think we get serious enough we we want
[20:15] change but we're not willing to do what
[20:17] it takes to have change and what it
[20:19] takes is to surrender if you don't
[20:21] surrender your attitude see all you
[20:24] trying to correct everybody else but
[20:25] judge yourself with the word of God
[20:27] that's what we got to do stoping to
[20:28] judge everybody else and we got to judge
[20:30] ourselves with the word of God where are
[20:32] we missing at in the word of God not not
[20:35] what X Y and Z is missing but what am I
[20:37] missing
[20:39] Lord
[20:41] amen so we got to believe that he can
[20:43] bring life into a situation of that has
[20:46] no life we serve a god who's a Creator
[20:48] and a maker of all things there's
[20:50] nothing too big or too small for him he
[20:51] literally created any and everything we
[20:53] see and we don't think that God can
[20:55] handle a little situation in our life a
[20:57] little financial situation a little
[20:58] Health need a little family issue or
[21:01] Clash we we don't think God can handle
[21:03] that we we limit God what he can do in
[21:05] our lives and we need to get back and
[21:07] take back what belongs to us peace in
[21:10] your family belongs to you restoration
[21:12] in your family Belongs to You Financial
[21:15] Freedom belongs to you healing in your
[21:17] body belongs to you you just got to take
[21:20] God at his word and say Lord you that's
[21:22] for me personally I see my name written
[21:24] right in here and you're speaking to me
[21:27] directly hallah we got to get we got
[21:29] start getting this is the year we got to
[21:30] get so personal cuz restoration is going
[21:33] to happen in your life but you just got
[21:35] to claim it you just got to claim it it
[21:37] may not look like it but it's going to
[21:39] happen you got to believe it it's
[21:41] darkest before Dawn the prophet said
[21:44] amen so we need to get back it's time to
[21:47] take back our spiritual
[21:49] walk it's enough of these little uh dsy
[21:51] prayers 5 minutes here 2 minutes there
[21:54] it's time to get back on our knees and
[21:56] mean business cuz when God is going to
[21:59] move when we get back on our knees and
[22:01] mean business say Lord I'm not moving
[22:03] till I feel your presence I'm not moving
[22:05] till I hear you speak to me personally
[22:08] see a lot of times we just get satisfied
[22:10] and Justified when we we hit our knees
[22:11] in the morning and say oh I said a
[22:13] little prayer I made a little time but
[22:15] that's not that's not putting God first
[22:17] putting God first is is taking the flesh
[22:19] out the way it's crucifying the flesh
[22:21] cuz the flesh never wants to pray it
[22:23] does and if it does it wants to do
[22:25] garbage prayers and we got to get past
[22:27] those garbage prayers and get back to
[22:29] how we used to when we first gave our
[22:31] heart to the Lord we were so on fire we
[22:34] were so desperate we we couldn't wait to
[22:36] testify what God did to in our life we
[22:38] couldn't wait to do it and now we we've
[22:40] got we we've grown more but we got
[22:42] lazier I think as the years go by we get
[22:44] lazier and lazier I'm talking about
[22:46] myself too and we need to stop being
[22:48] lazy and just get back to how it used to
[22:50] be we got to let that Spirit of Revival
[22:53] live inside of us we can't never die
[22:55] because if the spirit of Revival is
[22:57] inside of us we got to pray say Lord I
[23:00] can't leave the house I don't care if I
[23:01] have to be late for work or if I got to
[23:03] miss something Lord I I need this this
[23:06] connection with you because if I'm not
[23:07] connected with you I'm going to handle
[23:09] situations wrong I'm going to yell at
[23:11] somebody I'm going to have ill thoughts
[23:13] towards somebody see it's all it all it
[23:16] all depends on what you're connected to
[23:18] see we we live in an age of where social
[23:20] media is such a a outlet for uh for rest
[23:24] we have a bad day we go on social media
[23:26] just scroll on Tik Tok and YouTube and
[23:28] we just kind of decompress like that but
[23:30] that decompressing isn't going to help
[23:32] you what decompression we need is prayer
[23:36] message of the hour reading the word of
[23:39] God speak speaking the word over
[23:41] yourself that's what we that's what's
[23:43] going to decompress you that's what's
[23:44] going to cause life see entertainment is
[23:46] good for the flesh but it's going to go
[23:48] away but I I believe the Bible talks
[23:50] about how uh if if our mind is stayed on
[23:52] God he'll give us perfect peace right
[23:55] and that's the peace we need we got to
[23:56] keep our mind and our heart stayed on
[23:58] God at all times see we forfeit all this
[24:01] peace because our mind isn't stayed on
[24:03] God our minds on a million other things
[24:05] like what I got to do for work what's
[24:06] for lunch today what I got to do this at
[24:07] the house I got to do this pick this up
[24:10] but keep your mind on God we got to amen
[24:14] so the Lord died so we could have a
[24:16] personal relationship with him and he
[24:18] loved us so much he wanted to give us a
[24:20] personal intimate walk with him and I
[24:22] don't think we take advantage of that
[24:24] that offer he's given us and so we got
[24:26] to it's time we get back in line like I
[24:28] said before get back and step walk in
[24:30] the light as he leads us in the
[24:32] light am let's go to Ephesians
[24:38] 5:26
[24:42] amen like I said before we we we come
[24:45] sometimes to church and we're comparing
[24:47] somebody's life with our life and say oh
[24:49] I'm a little bit better than this person
[24:50] they ain't going to do you no good it's
[24:51] unwise to do that see every person a
[24:54] different walk every person is a
[24:56] different level so if that person isn't
[24:58] where you're at that's okay help that
[24:59] person edify that brother help that
[25:02] brother don't cause Discord in
[25:03] somebody's life by by having ill
[25:05] thoughts towards somebody see everybody
[25:07] has different struggles in life we got a
[25:09] brother Bram said the greatest success
[25:11] of his ministry was was being able to
[25:12] fill for the people we got to feel for
[25:14] one another we got to pray for one
[25:16] another more cuz it's we all going
[25:19] through a spiritual battle all we
[25:21] fighting the same enemy we're not
[25:23] fighting each other we're fighting we're
[25:25] not fighting against flesh and blood but
[25:26] the the your greatest enemy is your
[25:28] yourself right and the devil's going to
[25:30] use that against you if you're not
[25:32] spiritually aware yes sir so Ephesians
[25:35] 5: 26-7 says that he might sanctify and
[25:38] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[25:40] by the word that he might present to
[25:43] himself a glorious church not having
[25:45] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but as
[25:47] should be holy and without blemish so
[25:50] that's restoration right there God is
[25:52] trying to restore us back to that state
[25:54] and we got to let the word just wash us
[25:56] and cleanse us away because we we we
[25:59] live in a world where God has become a
[26:02] forethought in a lot of people's minds
[26:04] and we got all these atmospheres we go
[26:05] into and we got to make sure that we're
[26:08] prayed up to be able to handle those
[26:09] things because God can wash you with the
[26:11] word it doesn't have to be a church
[26:13] don't just wait the church to get washed
[26:14] by the word the when you reading the
[26:16] word of God it can wash you the message
[26:18] of the hour it can wash you see see we
[26:20] like to play Wednesday and Sunday
[26:21] Christians and we can't play Wednesday
[26:23] and Sunday Christians we got to play
[26:25] 7day a week Christians because that's
[26:27] how God's to move when you're serving
[26:29] him seven days a week don't just serve
[26:31] him three days a week so well I gave God
[26:32] a good three days and I'm going to take
[26:34] the the rest of the four off God doesn't
[26:35] work like that God works in he he looks
[26:38] for faithfulness that's what pleases God
[26:40] as a faithful Christian when when
[26:42] everything is going wrong in a
[26:43] Christian's life that he can still uh go
[26:45] on his knees and raise his hands say
[26:47] thank you Jesus thank you for this day
[26:50] thank you for my life thank you for all
[26:51] that you're doing even the things I
[26:53] don't notice you're doing that's what a
[26:55] true Christian to me is somebody who
[26:57] doesn't have to wait for when
[26:58] everything's all hunky dory to worship
[27:00] God but you can worship God when the the
[27:02] the greatest battle is in in in in the
[27:05] midst when your family's going against
[27:06] you and they fired you at work that's
[27:08] the time to really show what you got
[27:10] inside of you that's true worship to me
[27:13] anybody can worship in in a church
[27:14] setting where everything is all
[27:17] good amen amen amen
[27:23] amen let's go I read a quote after
[27:26] this amen
[27:29] then he can give us the restoration that
[27:30] we desire we all desire something from
[27:32] God tonight we all have a need we have
[27:34] before God we all can testify that right
[27:36] now and we got to be able to take that
[27:38] need before God look at the promise
[27:41] that's for us in the word of God and say
[27:43] God this promise is mine Lord help me to
[27:46] get in line with the promise so I can
[27:48] meet the the the um brother Brandon said
[27:50] the statement that if X Y and Z has met
[27:53] the same qualifications of the promise
[27:56] then God is obligated to give it to you
[27:57] if you meet the same
[27:59] qualifications and it it's literally
[28:01] simple as that and I think a lot of
[28:03] times we we always we let worry and fear
[28:05] come into our life CU When we we don't
[28:07] we can't have control of something we
[28:09] start to fear and say well maybe uh This
[28:11] Promise isn't for me well maybe God
[28:12] didn't speak to me and God is waiting
[28:14] for us to stand firm stand firm in the
[28:17] word of God that's what God's looking
[28:18] for be like job he could he could
[28:20] literally stand firm and still believe
[28:23] God and not curse him even when his
[28:24] family died when his wife when his wife
[28:27] said you should go curse God and died
[28:29] all these things was going around them
[28:30] but job could still stand strong because
[28:33] he had a strong foundation and he even
[28:35] have the word of God like we do we got
[28:38] all these promises in here we got all
[28:39] these examples in here but yet sometimes
[28:41] we can't find enough Faith to muster up
[28:43] just to get our knes and pray or another
[28:45] Faith to uh say Lord help me give me
[28:48] give me uh wisdom to help W witness to
[28:50] somebody today right amen and the thing
[28:54] is I love in the Book of Genesis how it
[28:57] talks Abraham it talks about how uh that
[29:01] the seed is going to possess the enemy
[29:02] of the gates I love how in the Book of
[29:04] Joshua it talks about uh footsteps means
[29:07] possession so the same thing in our walk
[29:09] right now is footsteps mean possession
[29:11] more restoration but we got to claim
[29:13] that restoration we got to walk in it
[29:15] cuz God has given it to you think about
[29:17] that God has given you the the key to
[29:20] Restoration and it's in this Bible right
[29:22] here so many scriptures talk about
[29:24] restoration as brother Jack has just
[29:26] been beautifully just setting it out for
[29:27] us we got all this meat that we've been
[29:30] uh the the Mishawaka and all these
[29:32] ministers we have come through get all
[29:34] this meat so we have no excuse to be to
[29:37] be down we got to get back
[29:39] up
[29:40] amen amen I'm going to read a a quote
[29:43] this is from Stand still and see the
[29:45] salvation of the Lord and if his people
[29:48] today would only listen to him think
[29:49] about that and stand still to see his
[29:52] promise think about that if his people
[29:53] would only listen to him today and stand
[29:56] still to see the Promise he like to
[29:58] display the same thing to them today to
[30:01] deliver the people from bondage of sin
[30:03] and doubt frustration sickness check
[30:07] this right here and every Redemptive
[30:09] blessing that Jesus died for belongs to
[30:12] the people belongs to everybody in here
[30:14] not one person doesn't belong to you in
[30:16] here it's yours you got to claim it it's
[30:22] yours God's got the sea to stand still
[30:25] to watch him doing something a lot of
[30:27] times we'll get in front on a red sea
[30:29] and we don't know what to do and what
[30:32] you need to do is just say God you you
[30:35] brought me this far I'm going to March
[30:37] forward right cuz footsteps footsteps
[30:39] mean possession yes sir I'm not scared
[30:41] of what's behind me cuz you didn't tell
[30:43] me to look behind you'll protect me from
[30:44] my high you said look forward that's why
[30:46] the armor of God doesn't have something
[30:47] on her back it has all forward so you
[30:49] just March forward and God's going to
[30:51] part that Red Sea for you you're going
[30:52] to March forward and God's going to give
[30:54] you the strength to kill that Goliath
[30:55] right you see this is the year where
[30:57] Giants should fall down sir cuz they get
[31:00] they get in the way of restoration we
[31:01] got to take that sword and cut the
[31:03] Giant's head off cuz that devil has no
[31:06] business keeping you from restoration he
[31:08] has no business so you just cut his head
[31:10] you get your slingshot off knock him
[31:12] down and cut his head off he has no
[31:14] right amen we always get uh let's go to
[31:18] expectation 1950 we always get what we
[31:21] expect when people expect anything well
[31:24] then they usually get what you look for
[31:26] so if you're expecting for for God to
[31:29] move and you really really mean it from
[31:31] your heart then God's going to move but
[31:32] if you're halfway in halfway out then
[31:35] you ain't going to get what God has for
[31:36] you you just can't it's impossible see
[31:39] well then usually you get what you look
[31:40] for it's the mental attitude that you
[31:43] have so every situation you're go into
[31:45] your me God is looking at the mental
[31:47] attitude that you have cuz that's what
[31:49] pleases God is your attitude of how
[31:51] you're acting to the situation I believe
[31:53] the Bible says do all things without
[31:55] murmurings and disputings and that's a
[31:57] hard thing to do because we live in a
[31:59] world of complainers everybody's
[32:01] complaining about the littlest thing
[32:03] everybody gets offended about the
[32:04] littlest thing and we got to fight
[32:06] through fight through those atmosphere
[32:08] of of unbelief and uh and doubt we got
[32:11] to fight through it yes sir and it says
[32:14] remember this and never forget this the
[32:16] right mental attitude towards any I'm
[32:20] going say it again towards any say it
[32:22] with me any promise of God will bring it
[32:25] to pass the right mental attitude
[32:28] towards any promise look it doesn't take
[32:31] Gifts of healing to heal sick people any
[32:33] person in here has a right to meet Satan
[32:36] anywhere you don't have to be a minister
[32:39] you don't have to be a deacon you don't
[32:40] have to be a song leader all you have to
[32:42] be is a surrendered Christian cuz the
[32:44] the brother brandom said even the
[32:46] weakest Christian on his knees the
[32:48] Devils tremble see they're not trembling
[32:51] because of you but they're trembling
[32:53] because of God inside of you and if God
[32:56] inside of you is not getting first place
[32:58] how do you expect the Devils to tremble
[33:00] how do you expect the Devils to fear cuz
[33:02] they're they're scared of God they're
[33:04] not scared of you not one bit right
[33:08] amen remember this we're leading the
[33:10] greatest news flash in history
[33:13] 1961 remember God told Joshua every
[33:17] place the soul of your footsteps that's
[33:20] possession every step not just some but
[33:23] every step so every time we take God at
[33:26] his promise that's possession possession
[33:29] possession brother then footsteps means
[33:31] possession let's just keep walking into
[33:33] the promised land he's promised us
[33:36] restoration he's promised us he's
[33:38] promised us let's let's keep walking
[33:41] into it not looking back to see what
[33:43] will happen back there and what somebody
[33:45] else is doing keep your eyes on Jesus
[33:48] the Joshua leader just keep moving on
[33:51] deeper depths and higher Heights until
[33:53] you're possessing everything that God
[33:56] has promised you in his word think about
[33:58] that everything he's promised in his
[33:59] word for you sir amen amen
[34:05] amen read the
[34:07] quote and Caleb Ste the people before
[34:09] Moses and said we are able to go over
[34:12] and take it because it depends on what
[34:15] you're looking at so what are you
[34:16] looking at in situation right now are
[34:18] you looking like it's a a situation that
[34:20] never could be changed that never could
[34:22] be anything better than what it was see
[34:24] a lot of times we get so caught up in a
[34:27] situation that's been bad for so long
[34:28] that we we lose sight of hope we like
[34:31] man this is never going to change I'm
[34:32] just going to have to live with it and
[34:33] deal with it somehow and then we just
[34:35] lose sight and hope it a God doesn't
[34:37] look like that God doesn't look a
[34:39] situation and say well I can't change
[34:41] this no God is looking for you to say
[34:43] hey I don't care how bad it's been or
[34:45] how bad it's going to be but it's going
[34:46] to be better because God promised it to
[34:48] be better he said if I put says but seek
[34:50] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[34:52] righteousness and all these things
[34:53] should be added unto you it's all these
[34:56] things it does it didn't say particular
[34:58] says all these things so you got to put
[35:01] him first so he can change the the the
[35:03] family Dynamic you want to be changed
[35:05] whatever promise you you're going after
[35:08] amen because it depends on what you're
[35:10] looking at some of them were looking at
[35:12] the obstacle the great armies and the
[35:13] Great Walls and the great Giants and the
[35:15] size of the people but Caleb was looking
[35:17] at the promise of God and it was the
[35:20] hour he had come when Caleb had to get
[35:22] the people still before he could tell
[35:24] them the promises of God now I want you
[35:26] to notice that some times it's only
[35:28] going to be two people maybe that
[35:30] believe the promise of God you might
[35:33] believe it and your family might not
[35:34] believe it but you got to stand strong
[35:35] cuz think about it out of the uh 10 out
[35:38] of the 12 Spies only two people believe
[35:39] God's report they went there saw the
[35:41] land and only two of them believed it
[35:44] right so imagine that all the Israel is
[35:46] against you and only two of you believe
[35:48] it look at the odds of that but they
[35:50] could still stand strong because you
[35:52] know why there was a different Spirit
[35:54] within them they saw the same acts that
[35:57] the children of Israel did they saw the
[35:59] same God move but yet the others didn't
[36:02] have the
[36:03] testimony but Joshua and Caleb knew that
[36:06] there was no obstacle that God couldn't
[36:08] take him through because he seen them
[36:09] move he SE they seen Mana fall from they
[36:11] seen uh flies they seen water come out
[36:15] of rock they see all the ab Brazen
[36:16] serpent all these things they saw and
[36:18] they said well if God can do that then I
[36:20] know for sure God can do this cuz he
[36:22] told us exactly how he's going to do it
[36:24] so all we got to do is just March
[36:25] forward and say God I'm just following
[36:27] your word yeah that's you you told me to
[36:29] do this God so I'm going by obedience
[36:32] I'm going by faith that you've called me
[36:34] to do this amen let's go to Joshua
[36:38] 1
[36:40] amen I I love this uh this scripture
[36:42] here in Joshua 1 should be encouraging
[36:45] to all of
[36:50] us amen if I can get
[36:55] there so obviously we know um this is
[36:58] the commission of Joshua Moses had just
[37:00] died and this is the first thing that
[37:02] Joshua in the book of Joshua says now
[37:05] after the death of Moses the servant of
[37:06] the Lord it came to pass the Lord spake
[37:09] unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[37:11] ministering saying Moses my servant is
[37:14] dead now therefore arise go over this
[37:17] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[37:19] land which I do give to them even to the
[37:22] children of Israel we can put in our our
[37:23] personal situation even the restoration
[37:25] which I do give you
[37:28] for every place that the soul of your
[37:29] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[37:31] unto you as I said unto Moses from the
[37:35] Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[37:37] the Great River the river of Euphrates
[37:39] the land of the high ties unto the great
[37:41] sea toward the going down of the sun
[37:43] shall be your Coast there shall be not
[37:46] any man be able to stand before thee all
[37:49] the days of thy life so there's no devil
[37:53] there's no gainsayer that can stand in
[37:55] front of what is rightfully yours if God
[37:58] has given it to you nobody can take it
[38:00] away nobody can add to it it's going to
[38:03] be pure and unadulterated Point Blank
[38:06] yes sir there shall not be any man to
[38:09] stand before thee all the days of thy
[38:10] life as I was with Moses so I'll be with
[38:12] thee so that same guy that was with
[38:15] Joshua and Moses is with each one of you
[38:18] personally so there's nothing too big or
[38:20] too small for you that for the god
[38:22] inside of you to handle you shouldn't I
[38:24] me uh brother Billy Paul had this
[38:25] testimony about his father he said he
[38:27] never saw a time where his dad could not
[38:29] solve a problem and what he meant by
[38:31] that was that brother Brandon relied on
[38:33] the god inside of him to help him
[38:35] through the problem and the many stories
[38:37] we have of him going through that that
[38:38] that trap that was set and all these
[38:40] things cuz he was dep he was dependent
[38:42] upon his intellects but he's depending
[38:43] upon the god inside of him to get it
[38:45] through it to get him through it yes sir
[38:47] be strong let's finish this I was with
[38:49] Moses so I be with thee I will not fail
[38:52] thee nor forsake thee there's not a
[38:54] promise in the word of God that can fail
[38:56] it's not the word is forever settled in
[38:59] heaven line upon line precept upon
[39:02] precept it will not return void it can't
[39:05] return void be strong and of good
[39:07] courage For unto this people Thou shalt
[39:11] divide for inheritance the land which I
[39:12] swear unto their fathers to give them
[39:15] only be thou strong and very courageous
[39:18] that thou mayest observe to do according
[39:20] to all the law which Moses my servant
[39:23] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[39:25] right hand or to the left hand that thou
[39:27] mayest Prosper wherever thou goest so
[39:30] take all the word of God yes sir as
[39:32] simple as that don't don't try to take
[39:34] what you want and and leave the rest but
[39:36] take all the word of God because it says
[39:37] if you do that it says Thou mayest
[39:40] Prosper wherever thou goest whatever job
[39:42] the Lord takes you're going to prosper
[39:44] wherever house he leads you to you're
[39:46] going to prosper what he's you're going
[39:48] to prosper if you put God first you're
[39:50] going to prosper Matthew 6:33 like we
[39:52] said before we all want a prosperous
[39:55] life but we're not willing to do what it
[39:56] takes to have a Pros prous life it takes
[39:59] you to lay aside some things it takes
[40:01] you to make some time for God because
[40:03] the devil is not going to have you make
[40:04] time for God he doesn't he's going to
[40:06] make you so busy so engulfed in your own
[40:08] life that you're going to forget about
[40:09] God all day and then and wait till the
[40:11] end of the day to remember him and God
[40:13] ain't going to honor that he ain't he's
[40:15] not going to honor that this book of the
[40:18] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[40:20] but Thou shalt meditate there in day and
[40:22] night I don't think we meditate enough
[40:23] in the scriptures anymore we kind of
[40:25] just read a do a devotion is throw it
[40:26] off to the side we don't when we read it
[40:28] we kind of just oh I'm going to read
[40:29] this and I'm going to do my own thing
[40:31] but we don't take time like as I'm
[40:32] reading it I'm done with it I'm going to
[40:34] keep thinking about it I'm going to say
[40:35] Lord what were you trying to say to me
[40:36] in this Lord how can I manifest what I'm
[40:39] reading in this in your word that's the
[40:41] type of things we need to do that's
[40:42] meditating upon it we we just read it
[40:45] real quick and just throw it off we got
[40:46] to stop doing that and really reading
[40:48] the word of God this book of the law
[40:50] should not depart out of thy mouth but
[40:51] thou shall meditate therein day and
[40:54] night not two days a week but day and
[40:55] night that thou May observed to do
[40:58] according to all that is written therein
[41:00] further Thou shalt make thy way
[41:02] prosperous and then thou shall have good
[41:03] success so it's given us a definition
[41:05] it's giv us a a blueprint of how to be
[41:07] prosperous it says day and night thou
[41:10] mayest observe them so you got to study
[41:11] it and meditate it if you want to make
[41:13] sure you're doing all what God is
[41:14] calling you to do that's how you're
[41:16] prosperous verse n have not I commanded
[41:18] thee be strong and of good courage Be
[41:21] not Afraid neither be dismayed for the
[41:23] Lord thy God is with thee whatsoever
[41:26] thou go is so it doesn't matter what
[41:29] trap the devil sets for you doesn't
[41:31] matter what's going on in your life God
[41:33] is with you he's with you and in you to
[41:35] the end of the world you have all you
[41:37] need that's a majority you have God
[41:38] that's all you need and the children of
[41:40] Israel missed that that the very thing
[41:43] they needed wasn't fear but was God and
[41:46] we got to bring God into every we got to
[41:48] bring Faith Love and Hope in every
[41:50] situation if you know that's what Jesus
[41:52] brought in the situations with Jerry's
[41:54] daughter he brought Faith Love and Hope
[41:55] Peter John and James so we got every
[41:57] situation we go to we got to bring the
[41:59] that situation we got to yes sir Amen
[42:03] Let read one more quote and I think
[42:05] that's the very needy thing today is for
[42:08] the people to stand still and see what
[42:11] God has promised take some time and look
[42:13] in the word of God and see what is
[42:14] Promised for you take some time look it
[42:16] over look at these highlight the
[42:18] promises of God I think brother Jack
[42:20] mentioned it highlight those things and
[42:21] say whoa there's so many promises in
[42:23] here for me I'm I'm going to take them
[42:25] I'm going to claim them it's it's the
[42:27] day that God's fulfilling his I love
[42:29] that it's the day that God's fulfilling
[42:31] his promise these things must be they've
[42:34] got to come therefore we must see God's
[42:36] promise and stand still and Watch God's
[42:39] salvation and move into it God always
[42:41] works according to the word stealing the
[42:44] people so that's the word for here is
[42:47] it's it's the day that God is fulfilling
[42:49] his promise this is the year that God is
[42:51] going to fulfill the promises you've
[42:53] been you've been asking for the the
[42:55] Deliverance you've been needing for the
[42:56] financial Freedom you you've been
[42:57] wanting the church that we we we need
[43:00] God is going to give it to us so you got
[43:02] to believe that God is in the in the
[43:04] word honoring business he has to C line
[43:08] certain things up for you to get that
[43:10] promise sometimes it's it's us staying
[43:13] in the way of our blessings we hold a
[43:15] lot of our blessings away just because
[43:16] of uh of the life that we live sometimes
[43:19] we live such a life of oh I need this
[43:21] now like fast food God doesn't work that
[43:24] way Daniel Prayed for 21 days straight
[43:28] and didn't hear one thing from the Lord
[43:29] but still kept praying as if he's going
[43:31] to hear something each prayer that's how
[43:34] we got to pray we got to if we don't
[43:35] hear God from three weeks for two months
[43:38] keep on praying with all your heart
[43:40] because God is looking to see if you're
[43:42] going to stand strong in your prayer
[43:44] life you it's
[43:46] it's you got we got to stand strong we
[43:49] got to we we got to we got so many uh
[43:52] opportunities God has given us so many
[43:54] doors he wants to open for us
[43:56] spiritually and naturally
[43:57] and we want to hold those things back
[43:59] because God wants to open the windows of
[44:01] heaven and just bless you but you got to
[44:03] give him show him that you really mean
[44:05] business for
[44:06] blessings amen amen say one more one
[44:10] more uh thought we we just close in a
[44:13] word of prayer see restoration is so key
[44:16] for each one of us we got to just take a
[44:19] different look at it now it's been
[44:21] preached so many times behind the pulpit
[44:23] and we got to just claim it we got to
[44:25] write it down if you have to that
[44:26] restoration is for me that that God died
[44:29] personally for me God died personally to
[44:32] help me in my situation God died
[44:34] personally that I can have faith that I
[44:36] can have strength from him to conquer
[44:38] the situation and so we got to just keep
[44:40] our eyes on the author and finisher of
[44:42] our faith keep our eyes on him there's
[44:44] see when Peter took his eyes off of him
[44:46] walking in the water he began to sink
[44:48] and the same thing will happen to us we
[44:49] take our eyes off of him will begin to
[44:52] sink so this is the year of restoration
[44:56] and we all got to make make a commitment
[44:57] that God this is my year this is the
[45:00] year where I'm giving you everything I
[45:02] have because it might not be a next year
[45:05] and God you deserve my best you gave me
[45:07] your best I'm going to give you my best
[45:09] every day even we don't feel like it
[45:11] give God your best because God is
[45:14] looking at the sacrifice you're giving
[45:16] him look looking at the the The
[45:18] Obedience you're giv him and when he
[45:19] sees that you're truly faithful and
[45:21] obedient he's going to bless you
[45:23] exceedingly and
[45:25] abundantly amen this is bwing the word
[45:26] of
