tonight hallelujah hallelujah my Lord Jesus like my uncle says what a word what a word what a word aren't you happy you came to church tonight so much was just was brought there you know the sermon a strong and weakness and justice brother Diggs was just kind of sharing about prayer and you know how prayers it's a worship right even brother Branham taught us that it's a worship right we're not just going with a bunch of complaints and a bunch of you know requests but it's a worship right even even when the disciples asked the Lord Jesus to teach us how to create the widget Lord this just teaches we haven't heard the Pharisees praying we don't hurt the Sadducees pray we heard mommy and daddy pray we heard all these people pray but we want you to teach us how to pray and the Bible's a response to just just start by saying our Father who are in heaven and as he was I was just thinking about that tonight you know heaven represent atmospheres right if they our Father who are in heaven he's able to change whatever atmosphere you're in right our Father who are in heaven hallow in see when you get to the word hallo it just at the beginning of that prayer it's a time of worship Halla would be your name is just what I glorify Lord I bless you Lord I I praise I exhausted because I know you the only one that can be exalted and you know it ne ne ne ne ne ne ne child understands how to butter up their parents they young lady knows how to make sure she stroked at his head and do something right and you actually got she got she gonna butter them up tell them how nicely looking and all kind of stuff she got a purpose for saying that but after she gave him a little worship then she gonna come with a request and typically daddy cannot deny specially she don't work them up real good she just daddy just came to mine and you know what we're made just like I'm father I tell you what we just go to them with that worse if we go with adoration we'll get into tension church if your motive in your heart is right you'll get his attention I like that just just bring them into the environment bring them in with your praise I've always told the churches say if you ever looking for God when you're really going through and you like man I just can't see God I can't feel God I can't hear God I don't know if God hear me I don't know that you're ever looking for the Bible says that he inhabits which means he dwells in the midst of your praise that's why when job was going through you know that if you just just read your Bible you see when after all of this bad news that job's got I mean for different people came with four different reports the last one was his children being killed in a house together but you know joke day rather than complain joke did something that most us just need a revelation that we need to do job out his face to the ground and he began to worship that changes the whole situation and you ever want to give a devil of mom that or worship when you're going through a man just worship while you're going through Oh glory to God amen that that's when your praise really means something yeah you got to be able to shout when you don't feel like it hallelujah hallelujah a man a man god bless you brother Diggs we appreciate you tonight he got to talking about so many things there and I was I was I was like Lord I'm trying to save my sermons but he was he was into some new sermons you know that the Lord had just kind of put in my heart and and you know I'll just one thing I'll share with you there was a man by the name of George Muller and George Muller wrote a book on releasing the power of prayer and just many things that he you know he shared just in his own life he born 1700s 1800 something like that and the rand orphanages about ten thousand kids came through his orphanages and in his lifetime God used them in a very mighty way but there was a time with George Muller had run into this gentleman and and the man was you know it was encouraged by George's testimony sort of answer you know I've been praying for my my son's I got six points I've been praying for these boys for the years the years just seemed like nothing happened but George encouraged me say look you know what you need to do is keep praying for so keep praying for as they not only expect that God's gonna answer your prayer so keep praying and then expect that God gonna answer prayer you're saying and the last thing you need to do so you need to start praising God for the demand apply George's uh advice we say within two weeks of applying that advice five of five or six six boys out giving their heart to the Lord within an eight-day period has been serving God for years the next time we saw Julie they've been serving down for six years but after I begin to bless God right not just complaining but I begin the freight I begin to worship Him in the midst of my prayer then I thought God changed that thing around within two weeks so church may be praying for something I don't know it could have been a long time but now it's time to start worshiping because he's already heard your prayer oh he's a good good father he's a good good father and I believe some things were released in this place tonight I believe that I believe that y'all such a degree know some things and my and and you know sometimes you you have to be able to catch the moment right and it was like when when the angel would go down in trouble the water they had to be ready for the moment and tonight as the you know he just started talking about them laws and everything and I mean God knew exactly what was in my heart I had some things that I was you know he ain't saying he over there touching my hand but in my heart I had a request and as he was touching and agreeing I'm God know what was in my heart that was going forward I didn't get a chance to tell brother Diggs but got new ones in my heart right and I'm touching I say I'm agreeing on that I'm receiving it tonight hey I'm receiving it tonight so i'ma just start praising God for it Amen it's already done it's already done I believe that I believe that my god Amen God God bless you let's have a word of Prayer and I will prepare to dismiss you tonight father we're so grateful your your word is it's real your presence is true and God has a Lord your Minister just got himself out the way just administer at our hearts tonight God we leave here strengthened and encouraged no matter what the devil is thrown in our direction and the Gottis seem like we've been distressed cast down not destroyed persecuted not forsaken God we've gone through many of these trials and tribulations but because of the seal we couldn't be broken god we couldn't leak so god we thank you for that we thank you that vasila the Holy Ghost is upon my life we might not have realized it but God that's just a demonstration tonight of lords of how we've gone through some things but yet we're still holding on what what a mighty God we serve father as we Lord just prepare to leave this place there are many things that people touched an agreed on it was in their hearts God I believe they're going to have exactly what they asked for and I believe the process started here tonight made a stake be placed in the ground that Lord it was on that night that I was at the church that my state was driven down and I'm and I'm holding to it no matter what I feel no matter what I hear no matter what I see I'm holding to what what what happened there that night God we thank you for this we realized Lord that the reason that we have trials is because we found favor with you and Lord the devil come with all kind of temptation what that is it's the lures from our destiny Lewis from you know your purpose and plan for life that's what the temptation does it pulls us off of off of the tracks but God we realize tonight you don't send that God to knock us down but you give it to us so we can get stronger and you so help us Lord to accept count it all joy no matter what it is that we're going through we pray that you continue to bless your servant bless his wife its children back home they continue to keep him and provide for him Lord his heart Lord just out ministering the gospel to to whomever he can wherever he can we pray that you bless Lord every every step in every a pulpit that's open to make you
