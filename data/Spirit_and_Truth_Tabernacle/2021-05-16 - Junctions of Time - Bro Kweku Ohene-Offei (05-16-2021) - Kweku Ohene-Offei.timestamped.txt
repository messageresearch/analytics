[1:11:29] the devil you cannot die
[1:11:31] i'm an eternal being you can take my
[1:11:34] garment
[1:11:35] but i cannot die
[1:11:38] you can take this skin out of me but the
[1:11:41] true me cannot die
[1:11:44] because before the foundation of the
[1:11:45] world you were the i am
[1:11:49] and you are manifesting as a part of him
[1:11:51] here
[1:11:52] amen we were there before the foundation
[1:11:55] of the world
[1:11:56] you know sometimes in my little church
[1:11:58] back when we had to modify some of our
[1:11:59] songs
[1:12:00] because our pentecostal elders sang it
[1:12:02] with their inspiration
[1:12:04] with the revelation they had at that
[1:12:05] time and the lord capped their
[1:12:07] revelation
[1:12:08] because they didn't receive all the
[1:12:10] revelation in the bible
[1:12:12] but for you and i everything in heaven
[1:12:15] everything in elohim has been poured
[1:12:18] down into your heart
[1:12:20] amen there's a song he said a builder
[1:12:22] land in a city that we were never before
[1:12:25] known we were there before the
[1:12:26] foundation of the world
[1:12:27] amen because they didn't know they sang
[1:12:30] it by the inspiration some of our
[1:12:31] precious pentecostal nomination brothers
[1:12:34] the lord gave them blessing
[1:12:35] but then we have the revelation and we
[1:12:37] add the revelation of jesus christ to
[1:12:39] the songs
[1:12:39] and to the gospel of jesus christ amen
[1:12:43] today we want to speak on the junctions
[1:12:45] of time
[1:12:46] i want to pick piggyback on brother
[1:12:48] jack's a
[1:12:49] title that is his series he's been
[1:12:51] preaching amen god bless you
[1:12:53] our seraphims who bring inspiration unto
[1:12:55] us the lord bless you mightily
[1:12:57] for what you do for us let's give them a
[1:12:59] clap of club
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:06] we want to speak on the junctions of
[1:13:08] time
[1:13:13] you know life has got so many junctions
[1:13:16] junctions where we were born and if you
[1:13:19] even want to go back
[1:13:21] junction when the lord created this
[1:13:22] earth junction when he put human beings
[1:13:25] on earth
[1:13:26] junction when he came to redeem junction
[1:13:29] when he introduced easter
[1:13:31] on planet earth junction when he allowed
[1:13:34] death the first death to happen on earth
[1:13:37] junction when he allowed resurrection to
[1:13:39] come on earth
[1:13:40] so everything has got a junction that
[1:13:43] the lord deals with amen
[1:13:45] and in the life of his people in the
[1:13:47] ministry of jesus christ
[1:13:48] the lord gives us junctions that we go
[1:13:51] through amen
[1:13:52] the gospel goes through junctions human
[1:13:55] beings go through junctions
[1:13:56] men and women go through junctions and
[1:13:59] the body of christ
[1:14:00] goes through junctions of time amen so
[1:14:03] you can never do without junctions
[1:14:05] the life was full of junctions when
[1:14:08] when is friday you are happy thank god
[1:14:10] it's friday
[1:14:11] you come back to uh friday relax
[1:14:14] saturday
[1:14:14] sunday church before you could say jack
[1:14:17] monday is here again
[1:14:19] you have to turn another junction and go
[1:14:20] back to work
[1:14:22] so even in the weekdays we have
[1:14:24] junctions that we have to partition
[1:14:26] through those junctions and the lord has
[1:14:28] equipped you and i
[1:14:29] to partition through every junction that
[1:14:32] is before you
[1:14:33] glory hallelujah to the lord amen and
[1:14:35] amen and amen
[1:14:37] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[1:14:39] christ we want to read a couple of
[1:14:41] scriptures
[1:14:43] we want to read from matthew i'm sorry
[1:14:45] if you have my
[1:14:46] powerpoint you can project it for me
[1:14:48] please god bless you brothers
[1:14:51] we want to read from matthew chapter 25
[1:14:55] verse 6 it's just one scripture
[1:14:58] and we read a couple of other scriptures
[1:15:01] matthew 25
[1:15:02] 6. we want to talk about
[1:15:06] junctions of time
[1:15:10] and at that midnight there was a crimea
[1:15:13] behold
[1:15:13] the bride the bridegroom cometh goi out
[1:15:16] to meet him and at that meet time
[1:15:20] and at midtime sorry there was a crimea
[1:15:22] behold
[1:15:23] the bridegroom cometh going out to meet
[1:15:26] him
[1:15:27] now the scripture is talking about a
[1:15:28] bridegroom coming
[1:15:30] and he said go ye out to meet him he
[1:15:32] didn't qualify who should go out and
[1:15:34] meet him
[1:15:36] so it's open right anybody can go and
[1:15:38] meet the bridegroom
[1:15:40] the bridegroom was qualified but then
[1:15:42] who should go meet him
[1:15:44] wasn't qualified so anybody can put
[1:15:46] himself there hey i'm the bridegroom i'm
[1:15:47] going to meet up
[1:15:48] going to meet the bride it's open
[1:15:50] statement but then let's
[1:15:52] read um let's go to another scripture
[1:15:57] let's go to revelation 1 17 sorry one
[1:16:00] seven
[1:16:01] you begin to put meat on the flesh
[1:16:03] remember the scripture about ezekiel
[1:16:04] then the dry bones
[1:16:06] there were dry bones in other words just
[1:16:08] a it's just a form of life
[1:16:10] but the lord hasn't put flesh on the
[1:16:13] life
[1:16:14] so let's see how the lord put flesh on
[1:16:15] the body of his wife amen
[1:16:18] so revelation 1 7 it goes behold he
[1:16:21] cometh with clouds
[1:16:23] and every eye shall see him and they
[1:16:25] also which pierce him and all the
[1:16:27] kindreds of the earth
[1:16:28] shall will because of him even so amen
[1:16:32] they will cry because of him so now the
[1:16:34] bible is talking about
[1:16:35] how he's coming he so doesn't qualify
[1:16:38] who should go meet him
[1:16:39] but he said he cometh with clouds and
[1:16:43] every eye shall see him the eyes of the
[1:16:45] predecessor shall see him
[1:16:46] and even those who pierce him they will
[1:16:48] see him and all the kindreds of the
[1:16:50] earth
[1:16:51] amen let's go to the next scripture
[1:16:56] which is revelation 19 7
[1:16:59] now is going to qualify who
[1:17:02] actually met the bridegroom amen
[1:17:06] revelation 19 7 says let us be glad and
[1:17:09] rejoice
[1:17:10] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:17:13] of the lamb
[1:17:14] is come and his wife has made herself
[1:17:17] ready amen let us rejoice
[1:17:21] and be glad and give anna to him for the
[1:17:24] marriage of the lamp has come
[1:17:26] and his wife has made herself ready you
[1:17:28] may take your seat
[1:17:30] god bless you so now matthew was talking
[1:17:33] about a groom
[1:17:34] coming we don't know who's going to meet
[1:17:36] him whether it's his friends his family
[1:17:38] his mom and dad
[1:17:39] because a groom is a human being he's
[1:17:41] got relationships
[1:17:43] but then he said we should go and meet
[1:17:44] him so that we can make certain
[1:17:45] assumptions that
[1:17:47] the bride should go meet the groom and
[1:17:50] then as we read further
[1:17:51] now their brother has already met a
[1:17:53] groom and the bride is rejoicing with
[1:17:55] his groom
[1:17:56] and the marriage is already come in the
[1:17:59] kingdom's version coming
[1:18:00] is already taking place it's already in
[1:18:04] activity it's going on amen it's no
[1:18:06] longer
[1:18:07] something in the future it's something
[1:18:09] which is happening and
[1:18:10] it happened and it's happening amen now
[1:18:13] in the seven churches
[1:18:15] the lord wanted to pick a wife or a
[1:18:18] bride for himself
[1:18:19] so he sent messengers to go look for
[1:18:23] a wife or a bride for him he sent
[1:18:26] the first messenger as we know paul to
[1:18:28] go and look for a body of
[1:18:30] uh to go and look for a wife for him and
[1:18:32] there was certain measurement they
[1:18:33] needed to measure up to
[1:18:35] to qualify to be the wife of king jesus
[1:18:38] christ
[1:18:39] now if we read uh let me go back a
[1:18:41] little bit the lord wrote three bibles
[1:18:43] the first bible the lord wrote was the
[1:18:45] uh the zodiac
[1:18:47] which is the sky we know until until
[1:18:50] noah there was no clouds you could see
[1:18:53] the sun
[1:18:54] you could see the moon as it is you
[1:18:55] don't have to shoot telescope to be able
[1:18:57] to
[1:18:58] just catch a glimpse and pieces of the
[1:19:00] planet all the planet
[1:19:01] planetary bodies are just in plain view
[1:19:04] so prophet like adam
[1:19:06] job they didn't have to read these paper
[1:19:08] bibles that we read
[1:19:10] they didn't have to use uh put bible
[1:19:11] internet they look at the sky and they
[1:19:14] could see the sun
[1:19:15] it's christ jesus the moon is his wife
[1:19:18] and all the stars are the body of christ
[1:19:21] sons and daughters of christ from
[1:19:22] adam to the last one the second bible is
[1:19:25] the pyramid
[1:19:26] and the paramedic was actually built by
[1:19:27] enoch we know scientists they call them
[1:19:30] egyptologists they try to study the
[1:19:31] pyramid
[1:19:32] how could they i mean human beings take
[1:19:34] stones
[1:19:35] which way tons of kilograms
[1:19:38] into the sky they don't know because
[1:19:41] prophets
[1:19:42] are christ sons and daughters of god are
[1:19:45] christ
[1:19:45] and they speak into creation so enoch
[1:19:49] didn't have to construct use
[1:19:50] brick missions to construct a pyramid
[1:19:52] he's put them into creation
[1:19:54] and enoch was a testimony of the
[1:19:57] blessing of the love of christ
[1:19:59] the lord was going to destroy the world
[1:20:01] at that time
[1:20:02] he was ending a generation he was ending
[1:20:04] a dispensation
[1:20:05] to create a new dispensation so the lord
[1:20:08] used enoch to build a testimony that is
[1:20:11] not going to destroy the earth entirely
[1:20:13] but he was going to wipe their sin and
[1:20:15] the unbelief
[1:20:16] and the unbelievers out of the earth but
[1:20:19] then for the testimony of his life
[1:20:21] the lord allowed enoch to speak
[1:20:24] pyramid into creation which wasn't
[1:20:26] destroyed during the anti-anti-diluvian
[1:20:29] distraction
[1:20:30] as a testimony of justification
[1:20:33] that the lord has justified the earth
[1:20:35] the earth is his love
[1:20:37] and regardless of her sins of iniquity
[1:20:40] the bloodshed
[1:20:41] the lord will pay whatever price to
[1:20:43] redeem the earth
[1:20:44] so enoch spoke the pyramid of egypt into
[1:20:47] creation
[1:20:48] and is still standing tall and loom as
[1:20:51] of now
[1:20:52] amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:20:55] blessed be the lord then in the pyramid
[1:20:57] the bible sorry let me go back a little
[1:20:58] bit to the zodiac
[1:21:00] the zodiac is made up of 12 houses as we
[1:21:02] have the paper bible we have how many
[1:21:04] 66 books if i'm right the zodiac has got
[1:21:07] 12
[1:21:08] houses and every one of you were born in
[1:21:11] a certain house
[1:21:12] in a certain month under a certain sign
[1:21:15] under the zodiac sign
[1:21:16] your emotions your mannerism your the
[1:21:20] way your demeanor
[1:21:21] is all from the house that you are born
[1:21:24] under
[1:21:25] some people are just emotional they can
[1:21:27] cry easily
[1:21:28] and in the same situation other people
[1:21:30] will eat and they'll be happy and be
[1:21:32] giggling
[1:21:33] there's a saying that a problem that can
[1:21:36] cause the dog to bark
[1:21:38] the dog will go through this sorry the
[1:21:40] cat will go through the same problem and
[1:21:41] just sitting down and watching
[1:21:43] it doesn't bother the cat but the dog if
[1:21:45] he sees a neighbor around
[1:21:47] he'll be screaming and crying and
[1:21:48] yelling for everybody to know that they
[1:21:50] say
[1:21:50] somebody passing around but the cat will
[1:21:52] just sit down and watch the person
[1:21:53] the passerby because they've got
[1:21:56] different nature they were born under
[1:21:57] different signs
[1:21:59] in your children in your family you're
[1:22:00] conceiving your children one is god this
[1:22:02] nature
[1:22:03] one is stronger one seems to be like a
[1:22:05] weakling one is more reserved
[1:22:07] one is open one is troublemaker one is
[1:22:10] different ones in the family
[1:22:11] and the lord put them there for a
[1:22:12] purpose amen and you have to love all of
[1:22:15] them
[1:22:16] they all serve a purpose and you're
[1:22:17] gonna find out the purpose they will
[1:22:18] save as they grow
[1:22:20] amen glory hallelujah to the lord so
[1:22:24] then back to the zod
[1:22:25] back to the uh pyramid pyramid has got
[1:22:28] seven steps
[1:22:30] just as uh the zodiac has got 12 houses
[1:22:33] which is from the month that we were
[1:22:34] born in the 12 cents of
[1:22:36] jacob and the 12 12 you can the 12 types
[1:22:38] in the in the bible
[1:22:40] now the seventh the pyramid types the
[1:22:42] seven
[1:22:43] you go through the first step and every
[1:22:46] parameter has to have a foundation
[1:22:48] so the foundation every building is in
[1:22:49] the form of a pyramid this wouldn't have
[1:22:51] a foundation you can't build a building
[1:22:53] in the sky
[1:22:54] you have to have a foundation so what is
[1:22:56] the foundation jesus christ
[1:22:57] the foundation of the church and then
[1:22:59] the seven church ages
[1:23:01] were there then they have the chamber
[1:23:03] the chamber is where the king is that is
[1:23:06] the eighth
[1:23:07] the eighth chamber which is the eighth
[1:23:09] day which is eternity
[1:23:11] now to cross over from the seventh
[1:23:13] chamber to the a chamber
[1:23:14] you're gonna see a messenger or a guard
[1:23:17] security guard
[1:23:19] and the god is going to tell you where
[1:23:21] do you want to go he said i want to go
[1:23:22] married to jesus christ okay
[1:23:24] now you have to take off all your
[1:23:26] clothes
[1:23:28] and get this clothes if you really want
[1:23:30] to go to the a chamber
[1:23:32] and if you don't want it you can say
[1:23:33] goodbye adios and go back
[1:23:35] if you want to go to the ace chamber to
[1:23:37] be messy jesus christ
[1:23:39] then you have to strip yourself your
[1:23:41] character your nature
[1:23:43] how you were born and then pick his
[1:23:45] nature pick is the major
[1:23:46] nature of pure white the holy ghost
[1:23:49] baptism
[1:23:50] wash you water in the snow then you
[1:23:52] don't you are no longer yourself
[1:23:54] you are now jesus christ his genes is in
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:57] his blood has been transfused in you and
[1:23:59] you become a new creation
[1:24:01] in christ jesus then you can boldly
[1:24:03] cross the seventh
[1:24:04] chamber to the eighth chamber but many
[1:24:07] people get to the seventh chamber
[1:24:08] they are not able to go to the a chamber
[1:24:10] glory hallelujah
[1:24:12] because of the pleasures of the world
[1:24:14] but those that were predicted before the
[1:24:16] foundation of the world
[1:24:17] regardless of what they would lose they
[1:24:19] will lose it and get married to the king
[1:24:20] of kings
[1:24:21] amen glory hallelujah so the lord used
[1:24:24] enough to build this
[1:24:25] a foundation to be a sign then the lord
[1:24:28] brought
[1:24:29] uh his i think his grandson or
[1:24:31] great-grandson noah was
[1:24:32] either grandson or great-grandson of uh
[1:24:36] of enoch so the bible said that lord
[1:24:38] never sent two prophets at the same time
[1:24:41] there could be two prophets on earth but
[1:24:43] the lord doesn't use them at the same
[1:24:44] time
[1:24:45] a church cannot have two pastors no it
[1:24:47] doesn't happen there's only one pastor
[1:24:50] there could be associated ministers or
[1:24:51] associate pastors but there's only one
[1:24:53] pastor
[1:24:54] in a church a woman cannot have two
[1:24:56] husbands or three
[1:24:58] there can be only one husband and one
[1:25:00] wife amen
[1:25:02] so the lord is the king and the husband
[1:25:05] of
[1:25:06] us all amen glory hallelujah so the lord
[1:25:09] sent in the seven churches the lord
[1:25:11] wanted to build a pyramid
[1:25:13] the natural pyramid that enoch spoke
[1:25:15] into creation was a type
[1:25:17] of the pyramid the lord was going to
[1:25:18] build and even before then
[1:25:20] that we know when we split scientists
[1:25:22] can split the world into seven
[1:25:24] continents
[1:25:24] different ones asia africa north america
[1:25:27] south america and so on and so forth
[1:25:28] europe
[1:25:29] but now before then before noah there
[1:25:32] was only one
[1:25:34] earth and all the waters were around
[1:25:36] just like an island
[1:25:38] there was no reverse meandering between
[1:25:41] the earth
[1:25:42] but then in the times of noah when rain
[1:25:45] noah spoke
[1:25:46] when his grandfather was raptured he
[1:25:48] quickly knew it was his time
[1:25:50] to be on the scene noah means a
[1:25:52] comforter the lord wanted to comfort the
[1:25:54] earth
[1:25:55] so when his grandfather enoch was
[1:25:57] raptured
[1:25:58] the lord anointed noah to take his place
[1:26:01] to begin to say there's going to be a
[1:26:02] rain
[1:26:02] and the said people said you must be
[1:26:04] crazy rain what is it
[1:26:06] we know water from the coming from the
[1:26:08] earth are springs
[1:26:10] from the water breath what is rain we
[1:26:12] have not even seen it before so what
[1:26:14] well that says the lord there's going to
[1:26:16] be a rain
[1:26:18] and noah seems to be like a crazy person
[1:26:20] what is rain
[1:26:22] and that's where godly people are amen
[1:26:24] those old prophets and old women they
[1:26:26] were ragged
[1:26:27] they didn't have bible people to read
[1:26:29] they didn't have reference
[1:26:31] they didn't have a job to preach to them
[1:26:33] but they were men and women who were
[1:26:35] ragged
[1:26:36] they went by inspiration from within out
[1:26:39] the holy ghost anointed them and they
[1:26:40] could stand in the face of death
[1:26:42] and mock death amen and that is the way
[1:26:45] as a christian you have to take your
[1:26:47] stance for the lord
[1:26:48] your stance is not because you are
[1:26:50] coming to church for somebody to pamper
[1:26:52] you
[1:26:53] to somebody to make you happy for
[1:26:55] somebody to give you
[1:26:56] money or for somebody to make you uh to
[1:26:59] i missing your praises
[1:27:00] but you are here for eternal life amen
[1:27:04] you are here nothing can offend you
[1:27:07] nothing because christ put you here amen
[1:27:11] if you can if you are easily offended
[1:27:13] then you are not ready to walk with the
[1:27:16] lord
[1:27:23] glory hallelujah to the lord so in the
[1:27:26] seven and
[1:27:27] churches the lord sent messengers
[1:27:30] and every age spark kim in his time
[1:27:34] and the body of christ we're married to
[1:27:36] the anointed word for the of the word
[1:27:38] christ and the word is the same amen
[1:27:41] because
[1:27:41] he's the one who lives in his word and
[1:27:43] so they went over through seven churches
[1:27:46] and in 1906 there was one of the
[1:27:48] greatest revival pentecostal revival
[1:27:50] on earth which took place right here in
[1:27:52] in the united states
[1:27:54] it started in california as user asus
[1:27:56] reviva
[1:27:57] 1906 maybe i could be off on the date
[1:28:00] in 1933 around the same time 1909
[1:28:04] a man called william brown was born
[1:28:05] april 26th in a
[1:28:07] bakersfield kentucky and this one was
[1:28:10] just a strange person he was born in a
[1:28:12] strange way
[1:28:13] his ways were very strange but the lord
[1:28:15] had a purpose for his life
[1:28:17] he grew up and he saw the pentecostal
[1:28:20] time
[1:28:20] in 1933 there was a
[1:28:23] a a phenomena on ohio river
[1:28:27] this one was baptizing people the lord
[1:28:29] has opened to him revelation of jesus
[1:28:30] christ
[1:28:31] because the church has gone through the
[1:28:32] dark ages and even things that were
[1:28:35] simple doctrine of baptism in the name
[1:28:37] of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:39] has been taken from from the word of the
[1:28:40] lord so now they've put in place of that
[1:28:43] uh trinity which means god
[1:28:46] the made three god father son god the
[1:28:48] father goddess
[1:28:49] got the holy ghost but the lord that god
[1:28:52] is one
[1:28:53] so this man called the revelation and
[1:28:55] was baptizing people in the name of the
[1:28:56] lord jesus christ
[1:28:58] and there was a light a supernatural
[1:29:00] light not just a light
[1:29:02] but the lord jesus christ himself as he
[1:29:04] vindicated john the baptist on ohio
[1:29:06] river
[1:29:06] sorry on river jordan this time he
[1:29:09] vindicated vindicated
[1:29:10] his prophet on ohio river in 1933.
[1:29:15] so the lord like i said love the earth
[1:29:18] the lord will never forsake the earth
[1:29:19] so he loves your earth he'll never
[1:29:21] forsake you so you redeem you
[1:29:23] regardless of the condition and so the
[1:29:25] lord began to manifest 1933 commissioned
[1:29:28] a prophet
[1:29:29] told him about the coming of christ told
[1:29:31] him about things he's apt to do
[1:29:33] in the near future 1946 there was one of
[1:29:36] the greatest revival
[1:29:38] a healing revival on earth even beyond
[1:29:41] the times of jesus christ
[1:29:42] said brother how do you say that well
[1:29:44] read the message talking
[1:29:46] you find out that the lord it wasn't
[1:29:49] willie abraham
[1:29:50] it was jesus christ just borrowed the
[1:29:52] flesh of willy abraham
[1:29:54] and jesus christ want to borrow your
[1:29:55] flesh to do the same works amen
[1:29:58] all that i'm speaking is history but we
[1:30:00] want to bring it to our time in real
[1:30:01] time
[1:30:02] we just want to lay a background amen
[1:30:04] the lord is not dead no
[1:30:06] he's a living being if he borrowed the
[1:30:08] flesh of william abraham
[1:30:10] martha marry rebecca and manifested the
[1:30:12] lord is burning the flesh of brother
[1:30:13] jagdaf
[1:30:14] but a solomon brotherhood's way sister
[1:30:17] all my sisters and brothers
[1:30:18] to use amen and what we need to do is to
[1:30:21] know who we are
[1:30:23] as our sisters were singing this morning
[1:30:25] the authority has been given to us
[1:30:28] that you speak and whatever you desire
[1:30:30] when you speak it
[1:30:31] you believe it you don't look at the
[1:30:33] circumstance but you look at the word
[1:30:35] that you spoke and what you spoke will
[1:30:37] be given to you
[1:30:38] amen glory hallelujah so 1946
[1:30:42] saw the greatest healing revival on
[1:30:44] earth
[1:30:45] up to that time the lord anointed his
[1:30:47] servant willie abraham
[1:30:48] to go to the word preaching seven times
[1:30:51] going around
[1:30:52] i mean went around the earth seven times
[1:30:54] preaching healing only believe
[1:30:56] all things are possible only believe all
[1:30:58] things are possible
[1:30:59] only believe cancer is healed healable
[1:31:02] only believe
[1:31:03] it doesn't matter death can be raised
[1:31:05] only believe
[1:31:07] whatever sin you have could be forgiven
[1:31:09] only believe
[1:31:10] all things are possible only believe
[1:31:14] amen just two ways only believe
[1:31:17] amen there's no god is not complicated
[1:31:21] he's so simple amen and he does simple
[1:31:23] things because his people are simple
[1:31:25] so only believe and 19 the same time
[1:31:28] the prophet the prophet prophesied that
[1:31:30] israel is restored back to their
[1:31:32] homeland
[1:31:33] the prophet you have to speak the word
[1:31:34] the prophet didn't have to carry jet
[1:31:36] plane
[1:31:37] or helicopter and carry israel from the
[1:31:38] nation from russia
[1:31:40] from u.s to israel but the way that he
[1:31:41] spoke the word is here and amen and the
[1:31:44] word that you speak
[1:31:45] your word can go and create your word
[1:31:49] can anoint someone
[1:31:50] to bring you the desire you might not
[1:31:52] have what you have
[1:31:53] what you need in your hands but when you
[1:31:55] stand as a daughter of god
[1:31:57] in the authority of the word and when
[1:32:00] you speak by inspiration of the holy
[1:32:01] ghost
[1:32:02] you just can't sit back and relax
[1:32:04] because your word
[1:32:05] is life your word is a creative voice
[1:32:08] and what you see there's a power
[1:32:11] it doesn't matter your flesh it doesn't
[1:32:13] matter your sickness
[1:32:14] but the power authority of christ in you
[1:32:17] will cause your flesh
[1:32:18] to obey the word that you speak that's
[1:32:21] why you have to
[1:32:22] speak positive don't speak negative
[1:32:26] if you speak negative you're going to
[1:32:28] receive negative
[1:32:29] but you speak healing to your body
[1:32:31] you're going to receive healing
[1:32:33] it doesn't matter how long it doesn't
[1:32:34] matter the process
[1:32:36] it's going to happen just as you spoke
[1:32:38] it amen
[1:32:40] and that's what the lord is trying to do
[1:32:41] this hour to let you know who you are
[1:32:44] that is hiding in your flesh is it
[1:32:46] brother
[1:32:48] but i smiley was there a couple of weeks
[1:32:50] ago he gave it he was preaching he got
[1:32:52] to a place said i don't need mine
[1:32:53] i don't even need my my sermon no more
[1:32:55] i'm the same one amen
[1:32:57] i don't need to give you quotes on the
[1:32:58] quotes amen and that's what the lord has
[1:33:01] brought us to sometimes you don't even
[1:33:02] need people in this computer so listen
[1:33:04] you are the bible amen you are the pill
[1:33:07] of fire amen
[1:33:09] there was a time samson went to he was
[1:33:11] he was in the lost way
[1:33:13] and he met enemies that he didn't
[1:33:16] encounter he didn't envisage
[1:33:18] more than thousand people he didn't have
[1:33:19] a gun he didn't have a coat he didn't
[1:33:22] have a scripture
[1:33:23] he didn't have a pastor to preach to him
[1:33:24] at that time they were going to kill him
[1:33:26] that was what he was facing
[1:33:28] and what did he do he just saw a jawbone
[1:33:30] of an
[1:33:31] ass he grabbed it and you know he was a
[1:33:34] seed
[1:33:34] of jehovah he grabbed it and the
[1:33:36] anointing came upon samson
[1:33:38] how could you use a jawbone of an ass to
[1:33:40] kill thousand people
[1:33:42] where the thousands were just sitting
[1:33:43] there looking at you killing them they
[1:33:44] were fighting back
[1:33:46] but there was an annoying it wasn't
[1:33:47] samson it wasn't the jawbone but a
[1:33:50] supernatural person
[1:33:51] took over the jawbone took over samson
[1:33:54] and slayed the enemies
[1:33:55] thousand of them amen what problem do
[1:33:58] you have now
[1:33:59] that the lord cannot do for you what is
[1:34:02] your worry
[1:34:03] what is your trouble why are you crying
[1:34:06] it's okay to cry but after crying wipe
[1:34:08] your tears
[1:34:09] and speak as a daughter of god and speak
[1:34:11] as a son of the living god
[1:34:13] for your word is not a word of a man
[1:34:15] your word is the word of the living god
[1:34:17] amen glory hallelujah blessed be the
[1:34:21] name of the lord
[1:34:25] glory
[1:34:30] 1946 israel became a nation this is our
[1:34:34] history that i'm lining up
[1:34:35] israel became a nation they had their
[1:34:37] own flag their own president or prime
[1:34:39] minister
[1:34:40] their currency they become an
[1:34:42] established nation meanwhile israel was
[1:34:44] scattered for
[1:34:44] more than two thousand years but on the
[1:34:46] third day the third
[1:34:48] thousand years the law began to do
[1:34:49] manifestation begin to manifest
[1:34:52] his people in the natural 1956
[1:34:55] the lord closed the seven church ages
[1:34:58] the churches were over
[1:34:59] william brown was preaching somewhere i
[1:35:01] think if it could be africa billy graham
[1:35:03] was preaching
[1:35:03] somewhere outside the united states or
[1:35:05] robert we were preaching somewhere
[1:35:07] and the lord anointed them to come back
[1:35:09] all the three ministers because the lord
[1:35:11] was using them
[1:35:12] mercy came on earth with two men william
[1:35:14] brown was a type of mechisadek
[1:35:16] and billy graham and aura robert were
[1:35:18] type of the two messengers
[1:35:20] who preached to sodom and gomorrah amen
[1:35:22] the lord also sent messengers to sodom
[1:35:24] because they need to hear the gospel
[1:35:25] anyways whether they will take it or not
[1:35:28] they need to hear it so that the lord
[1:35:29] will be justified when he bring judgment
[1:35:32] amen so all of them they said for some
[1:35:34] reason
[1:35:36] for some reason i don't know how but i
[1:35:38] felt it go back to the united states
[1:35:40] the council they are meeting and he said
[1:35:41] this day is the time that united states
[1:35:43] has to take christ
[1:35:44] or reject christ one or the other
[1:35:47] and it's they rejected christ as we know
[1:35:50] and ever since it's not been the same in
[1:35:51] fact there were some code
[1:35:52] said that america is not a democratic
[1:35:54] nation anymore
[1:35:56] democracy is over the the a lot of
[1:35:58] scriptures were full around that time
[1:36:00] kennedy sent a military and when he sent
[1:36:03] them he ended up sending 663 666
[1:36:06] people which signifies 666. the first
[1:36:09] catholic president
[1:36:10] i mean at the white house a lot of
[1:36:12] scriptures was fulfilled but that was
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:14] world that wasn't our scriptures yeah
[1:36:17] 1963-62
[1:36:18] the lord began to do something people
[1:36:20] begin to have some weird dreams
[1:36:22] but jack preached on it about two years
[1:36:24] ago and if you have if you want you can
[1:36:25] go back and read it
[1:36:27] i mean it couldn't be better about the
[1:36:29] dreams of brahms tabernacle some sisters
[1:36:31] and brothers ministers
[1:36:32] were having dreams it's about abram i
[1:36:34] had this strange dream and i saw this
[1:36:35] and this
[1:36:36] and their dreams were six and i think
[1:36:38] the prophet himself had a seventh dream
[1:36:40] amen and seven is the number of what
[1:36:43] completion
[1:36:44] william brahm's name is william abraham
[1:36:46] 777.
[1:36:49] there's no coincidence with the lord
[1:36:50] everything is just
[1:36:52] right the way the lord ordained it
[1:36:54] because the lord was about
[1:36:55] to come down and break the mysteries
[1:36:58] that were hidden in the bible
[1:37:00] all the messages from adam up to
[1:37:02] whenever
[1:37:04] the lord was about to breed the
[1:37:05] mysteries and give it to you
[1:37:08] the mysteries that was hidden from uh
[1:37:10] from daniel
[1:37:11] is now in plain view so that you not to
[1:37:14] fill your mind
[1:37:15] but to be in your heart that you'll be
[1:37:18] the fountain of living waters
[1:37:20] amen glory hallelujah to the lord so in
[1:37:23] 1963 as we know
[1:37:24] after the dream the lord began to
[1:37:26] vindicate and
[1:37:28] the lord himself came down to fulfill a
[1:37:30] scripture
[1:37:31] that was the scripture that we read he
[1:37:33] said i'll come in clouds
[1:37:35] and behold all eyes will see him the
[1:37:38] scientists
[1:37:38] took a picture they were not believers
[1:37:41] the lord didn't make with abraham to
[1:37:42] take the picture no they wouldn't have
[1:37:44] believed it
[1:37:44] but he made the unbelievers scientific
[1:37:48] world to vindicate the truth and they
[1:37:51] themselves took you to uh
[1:37:52] one of their best uh investigators of
[1:37:55] questions
[1:37:55] document uh what's the name let's see
[1:37:59] uh whatever george leslie thank you bro
[1:38:02] jack
[1:38:02] and so when he investigated and said
[1:38:04] look this is the only supernatural
[1:38:06] and so william ramoda as any other
[1:38:09] mortar man
[1:38:10] but his memory of that supernatural
[1:38:13] will outlive him amen
[1:38:17] your life that you are living the
[1:38:18] christian life that you live in yes a
[1:38:20] time will come
[1:38:20] if the lord terrorists will drop this
[1:38:22] flesh like any other mortar man
[1:38:24] by your memory of your life will outlive
[1:38:27] you
[1:38:28] amen the memory of your testimony well
[1:38:30] i'll leave you
[1:38:31] your faith and your passion will achieve
[1:38:33] with you your ministry will outlive you
[1:38:36] amen that's why the lord has put he let
[1:38:39] you go through sudden suffering
[1:38:41] to bring certain attribute out of your
[1:38:42] life glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:38:45] so 1963 revelation chapter 1 verse 7 was
[1:38:48] fulfilled
[1:38:49] the lord came down in the form of cloud
[1:38:52] cloud of what not just natural cloud
[1:38:54] but mysterious cloud what is cloud if
[1:38:56] you go back to the scriptures
[1:38:58] cloud of witness paul talk about cloud
[1:39:00] of witness
[1:39:01] how can cloud be a witness cloud is
[1:39:04] inanimate object
[1:39:05] it's just the wind and gases it's
[1:39:07] talking about few funnies
[1:39:09] celestial bodies but a solomon in his
[1:39:11] celestial body
[1:39:13] all of you were there amen it wasn't
[1:39:15] just for abraham
[1:39:16] it wasn't just the men that were there
[1:39:18] but a jack was there
[1:39:20] even so but i wasn't born it doesn't
[1:39:22] matter were you in christ before the
[1:39:24] foundation of the world
[1:39:26] you didn't have no flesh this flesh with
[1:39:28] you but you had a supernatural flesh
[1:39:30] how many were in the ribs of jesus
[1:39:32] christ when the pierce is ripped and
[1:39:33] blood and water
[1:39:35] we were not born two thousand years ago
[1:39:37] when we're not on this flesh
[1:39:39] your atoms were lying somewhere in the
[1:39:41] united states man was lying somewhere in
[1:39:43] ghana
[1:39:44] but the true you you were in christ
[1:39:47] and let me tell you something who you
[1:39:48] are amen the lord came in flesh he was
[1:39:51] 100
[1:39:52] human being he was 100 percent
[1:39:54] omnipotent
[1:39:55] and he manifest both of them depending
[1:39:58] on when it was necessary
[1:40:00] there was a time he was faced with a
[1:40:02] cavalry and cavalry wasn't a fan it
[1:40:04] wasn't a picnic
[1:40:05] it was death and demonic spirit all the
[1:40:08] satan and all the demons of the world
[1:40:11] coming to face this a lanky 33 and a
[1:40:14] half year old man
[1:40:16] and he saw in him in in in in visions
[1:40:19] just about 12 hours before it took place
[1:40:21] you could see visions
[1:40:23] of people with anointed with demons
[1:40:25] coming to torment him
[1:40:26] and he was a hundred percent human being
[1:40:29] so he praised the lord
[1:40:30] father the people of fire in him he be
[1:40:32] your wall let his suffering cup mean
[1:40:34] suffering
[1:40:35] cup of bitterness let the suffering pass
[1:40:39] by me but he said not my word but i will
[1:40:42] because for this course i came to the
[1:40:44] world amen
[1:40:45] and the bible said that angels came to
[1:40:48] minister to him who are those angels
[1:40:50] theophanies you and i brother jack all
[1:40:52] of us
[1:40:53] say lord you need to go to calvary if

[1:41:07] a book and
[1:41:11] the lord standing in the throne and
[1:41:13] there was no worthy no one worthy to
[1:41:15] read the book and he cried he knew that
[1:41:17] all human humankind
[1:41:19] were lost but then a lamp came out of
[1:41:22] the scene
[1:41:23] and picked the book and opened the seals
[1:41:26] now that lamp
[1:41:27] in the vision the lord jesus christ was
[1:41:29] on calvary
[1:41:30] and he needed to bring salvation to
[1:41:33] mankind redemption
[1:41:34] and he's the only one enoch wasn't
[1:41:36] worthy
[1:41:37] elijah was raptured wasn't worthy adam
[1:41:39] wasn't worthy
[1:41:40] you and i were not worthy but there was
[1:41:42] only one the lord jesus christ
[1:41:45] he has to come in a human flesh and he
[1:41:47] was worthy
[1:41:48] and in being in human self he was found
[1:41:50] in the time that he was weak
[1:41:51] he was he was crying and we came down
[1:41:54] from the celestial dimension
[1:41:55] to minister unto him to pick him up lord
[1:41:58] go and die for us and the lord went to
[1:42:00] die for you and i
[1:42:02] amen before you drop on earth you wear
[1:42:05] celestial being that's right
[1:42:06] you wear a physical like i see you now
[1:42:09] you were a human being not this flesh
[1:42:11] not just blood you had a more more
[1:42:14] powerful flesh your blood was it was the
[1:42:16] holy ghost
[1:42:17] and that is what we being redemption
[1:42:18] means to be restored to bring back
[1:42:21] who we who we are amen the celestial
[1:42:24] body that we operated in
[1:42:26] the new bed restores that celestial body
[1:42:28] to you
[1:42:29] and if it becomes necessary to go
[1:42:31] through the walls there's a power
[1:42:33] authority and everything in you to speak
[1:42:37] and go through the walls
[1:42:38] if it's necessary for us to pass through
[1:42:41] the uh the roof
[1:42:42] without even the roof nothing to disturb
[1:42:44] it we can do it
[1:42:45] right it happened before amen peter was
[1:42:48] in jail
[1:42:49] they were going to kill him and he felt
[1:42:51] like he was having a dream
[1:42:52] something like you know a dream and
[1:42:54] somebody told him rise up
[1:42:56] put on your clothes and let's go and it
[1:42:59] was like a dream when you sleep at
[1:43:00] daydreaming something like that
[1:43:02] and before he realized somebody was i
[1:43:04] mean leading him
[1:43:05] and they went through a door which is
[1:43:06] locked there was security
[1:43:08] strong men guarding him
[1:43:12] they passed by those men they didn't
[1:43:14] have a clue
[1:43:15] they didn't know the door didn't open
[1:43:18] but supernaturally
[1:43:19] he changed pictures from the celestial
[1:43:21] body from the flesh
[1:43:23] to the theophany and when he went over
[1:43:25] the flesh body
[1:43:26] came in peter's body and peter realized
[1:43:28] that this is not a dream
[1:43:30] i'm out of the jail wow what's going on
[1:43:33] here
[1:43:34] and he knew that they said they said
[1:43:36] angel of the lord he has a theophany
[1:43:38] the lord himself is with him and he went
[1:43:41] to do what he needed to do to be with
[1:43:42] the disciples the same authority
[1:43:45] the same business you don't have to die
[1:43:46] physically to pick you with you funny
[1:43:49] let me and just give an
[1:43:50] illustration lot
[1:43:52] lot wasn't a serpent seed lord was a
[1:43:55] seed of god
[1:43:56] but lord decide not to pick his still
[1:43:58] funny in other words he doesn't know to
[1:44:00] pick the holy ghost baptism
[1:44:02] abraham said that i and sarah we are
[1:44:05] going to stay with jehovah
[1:44:07] before he even make his deck he came as
[1:44:08] mercy lord said well
[1:44:11] i'm going to have some fun in sodom and
[1:44:12] gomorrah he is boring i want to go have
[1:44:15] some fun
[1:44:16] and so lord and his wife and his family
[1:44:17] moved to sodom
[1:44:19] and they went into sodomy and if you
[1:44:21] read the bible the bible said that lord
[1:44:22] was a righteous man
[1:44:24] and the sense of sodom affects his soul
[1:44:27] there's something in him that denounce
[1:44:29] those spirit
[1:44:30] denounce a man marrying to a man a woman
[1:44:34] having an affair with a woman it wasn't
[1:44:36] his makeup but at the same time
[1:44:38] that's where he found himself so his
[1:44:40] spirit was in constant rich
[1:44:41] but abraham the lord gave him a promise
[1:44:44] that abraham
[1:44:45] you and sarah will be a father and
[1:44:46] mother of nations
[1:44:48] and the promise the day was going by
[1:44:50] there was no sign
[1:44:51] physically and for 25 years
[1:44:54] once a while sarah will ask abram said
[1:44:56] honey are you sure i mean i know you
[1:44:58] the law speaks to you but are you really
[1:45:00] sure i mean look at who we are now we
[1:45:02] are just
[1:45:03] you know just about to die and we
[1:45:05] haven't seen this promise
[1:45:06] and abraham said have i ever had has the
[1:45:09] lord ever to this lie
[1:45:10] it's going to happen he said praise god
[1:45:12] i'm with you abraham and at the right
[1:45:14] time one day
[1:45:15] mercy sadek told two angels
[1:45:19] you know the lord changes his name based
[1:45:20] on what he want to manifest
[1:45:22] when he was in the angelic form fighting
[1:45:24] the antichrist he picked an attribute
[1:45:26] called michael
[1:45:27] michael is crazy says in the celestial
[1:45:29] body
[1:45:30] and he told the angels that hey we need
[1:45:32] to go down to earth
[1:45:33] and go and manifest the word of the lord
[1:45:35] my word so he picked two angels with him
[1:45:38] he picked billy graham and ura robert
[1:45:40] with him as a type
[1:45:41] and they went and the two of them went
[1:45:43] to sodom and gomorrah to preach to them
[1:45:44] but then
[1:45:45] mercy sadek stayed with who with abraham
[1:45:48] said we need to pass by abraham is my
[1:45:51] friend
[1:45:52] and see how many want to be a friend of
[1:45:53] jesus christ
[1:45:56] then you have to sacrifice to be his
[1:45:58] friend
[1:45:59] amen and he said abraham can i do
[1:46:02] anything without telling you
[1:46:04] how can god god doesn't have to tell a
[1:46:06] man what he wanted to do
[1:46:07] but he fell in love with abraham because
[1:46:10] abraham fell in love with him
[1:46:12] and you fall in love completely with
[1:46:13] jesus christ let
[1:46:15] everything else go its way and let the
[1:46:17] lord be the all in all in your life

[1:46:21] telling you amen it doesn't matter you

[1:46:24] brother

[1:46:28] put gifts in you
[1:46:30] amen gifts of tongues prophecy
[1:46:34] wisdom and what have you in your lives
[1:46:37] to manifest him so through those gifts

[1:50:15] congregation
[1:50:16] do you make it more complicated maybe if
[1:50:19] i know but solomon i can tell something
[1:50:20] about him
[1:50:21] but then if i turn my back i don't know
[1:50:22] what's going on
[1:50:24] all right and there's no people that he
[1:50:25] knows it's not like regular congregation
[1:50:27] this is people from meeting they
[1:50:29] organize the meeting from him
[1:50:30] sometimes they have to hide him and
[1:50:32] squeeze him to the meeting because
[1:50:33] somebody wants to just touch his flesh
[1:50:36] people want to and he's so loved and so
[1:50:38] kind
[1:50:39] he will preach i've saw a pastor in
[1:50:41] texas gave me a photo i should have made
[1:50:43] a copy
[1:50:43] of abraham after the meeting he was just
[1:50:45] a dead man sometimes if you if you read
[1:50:47] a message he said
[1:50:48] after they meet you don't know what it
[1:50:49] takes but this kind of ministry
[1:50:52] it's kind of he said the lord himself
[1:50:54] when the woman touched
[1:50:55] him it made him weak and he felt like
[1:50:58] virtue has
[1:50:59] come out of me how much more a sinner
[1:51:01] saved by greece
[1:51:02] he says sometimes my manager and my son
[1:51:04] billy paul packed me up and i saw a
[1:51:06] picture of brahmos like a dead man they
[1:51:07] were
[1:51:08] packing him and his head was behind him
[1:51:11] just like that person he was out of it
[1:51:13] he's gone
[1:51:15] the flesh strength is completely gone
[1:51:18] and sometimes he's between dimension he
[1:51:20] doesn't know who
[1:51:21] where he is whether he's on earth
[1:51:23] whether it's in the other dimension
[1:51:24] there was a time believers said they
[1:51:26] went to visible abraham they wanted to
[1:51:28] see him and when he went he was sitting
[1:51:29] in his chair
[1:51:30] and they said okay he's resting we're
[1:51:32] gonna wait till he wakes up
[1:51:34] and he was sitting there he just woke up
[1:51:36] so god bless you brother josue
[1:51:38] he wasn't sleeping he was in another
[1:51:39] dimension he realized that no he wasn't
[1:51:41] sleeping
[1:51:41] he was somewhere else so he just came

[1:53:17] know mrs oda she came from north
[1:53:19] carolina
[1:53:20] right and this same one i think was in
[1:53:22] i'm not sure whether it's the first
[1:53:23] envelope or somewhere
[1:53:25] and he mentioned his name who was that
[1:53:27] it was jesus christ
[1:53:28] hiding behind a badger skin and the same

[1:54:38] them and said
[1:54:39] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:54:42] i've read now he came to himself i've

[1:54:50] generation
[1:54:51] that will see jesus christ return to the
[1:54:53] earth

[1:55:01] sight
[1:55:02] you in tucson you in california you in

[1:55:14] marriage of the lamp has come
[1:55:16] and her bride is right has made herself
[1:55:18] ready
[1:55:19] amen so now but abram is talking about
[1:55:21] the generation
[1:55:22] that will see jesus christ return to
[1:55:24] earth
[1:55:26] and he said this this day this scripture
[1:55:29] is fulfilled how come remember when you
[1:55:32] go to the message
[1:55:32] 55 second coming he said i hope to see
[1:55:36] him come
[1:55:37] to see them coming in arizona in the
[1:55:39] world and shaking hands with them
[1:55:41] i hope i'll live to see that day the
[1:55:43] holy ghost in him was prophesying
[1:55:45] about sister excuse me 65.
[1:55:52] sometimes men and women of god do things
[1:55:55] without even thinking
[1:55:56] because your mind as we preach sometimes
[1:55:59] your mind is pro your normal mind can
[1:56:00] process let's say a certain rate but
[1:56:02] when you're under anointing
[1:56:03] it is processing maybe 200 times beyond
[1:56:05] your regular thinking
[1:56:07] and you see things in anointing that
[1:56:09] normally you wouldn't see
[1:56:10] amen because somebody took over your
[1:56:13] mind the same thing the holy ghost took
[1:56:15] over his mind
[1:56:16] his heart his body and speaking things
[1:56:18] that normally he wouldn't see
[1:56:20] he said the only thing is i'm the one
[1:56:21] that is close i'm not the one that
[1:56:23] performs those miracles
[1:56:24] but i'm the one that is close when he
[1:56:26] performed the miracles and the one that
[1:56:28] is near when he showed the supernatural
[1:56:30] to give it to you amen so now the lord
[1:56:33] said that that coming that coming is not
[1:56:36] for the world
[1:56:36] you know in our our denomination church
[1:56:38] were thought about taught about second
[1:56:40] coming of christ
[1:56:41] that is going to come i for me i
[1:56:44] remember when i was in in my
[1:56:45] in my church they said then because that
[1:56:47] they said jesus will come
[1:56:48] and when he comes there's going to be
[1:56:50] people blowing trumpets
[1:56:52] and if you see jesus you're going to be
[1:56:54] flying
[1:56:57] like michael jackson mcjustin's movie i
[1:56:59] forgot trailer
[1:57:00] flying and then with the lord so when i
[1:57:03] was a kid i was looking to the sky that
[1:57:05] one day the lord is going to come in the
[1:57:06] sky
[1:57:07] and i'm going to just meet him in there
[1:57:08] and go with him
[1:57:10] but abram said what similarity he said
[1:57:12] when i was young my mom taught me that
[1:57:14] when everybody dies they go to their
[1:57:16] class and they play drums and music
[1:57:19] they said if that so do you have it on
[1:57:20] us that was the methodist age
[1:57:22] it was good but we are in the opening of
[1:57:25] the seven seals
[1:57:26] we don't believe them doctrines that
[1:57:28] jesus christ is coming in the skies
[1:57:31] and then you see jesus and you begin to
[1:57:33] fly up somewhere no
[1:57:34] to begin with you're not going with this
[1:57:35] guy this guy
[1:57:38] is here that's where he belongs to amen
[1:57:41] he came from here but there's another
[1:57:42] guy the one that is speaking for
[1:57:44] from within he's the one he's celestia
[1:57:46] amen
[1:57:47] he can be here and can be in africa he
[1:57:50] can be here
[1:57:51] and be in another place because he is
[1:57:53] not limited to time
[1:57:54] but this flesh man is just limited to
[1:57:57] this time amen
[1:57:58] so the word is for you amen the word
[1:58:02] that wasn't for the world
[1:58:03] no that wasn't everybody know go to that
[1:58:05] drunkard on the street oh the lord is
[1:58:06] coming you tell you good people that go
[1:58:08] to
[1:58:08] pub and drink oh yes have you seen a
[1:58:11] drunkard preaching
[1:58:12] you will repent they can tell you jesus
[1:58:15] is coming oh yes i believe it and he's
[1:58:17] just drunk
[1:58:18] sick and wet with alcohol but they would
[1:58:20] preach to you the coming of jesus christ
[1:58:22] the second coming of christ
[1:58:23] but that was in the in the
[1:58:25] denominational era
[1:58:26] but we have got the opening of the seven
[1:58:28] seals we have got like
[1:58:30] brother jack and i smiley pray to
[1:58:34] us he said you can believe that jesus
[1:58:36] christ two thousand years ago
[1:58:38] but anyways i said jesus christ but a
[1:58:41] jack says oh no but jack i know him
[1:58:43] he's only 50 something years old how can
[1:58:45] he be jesus christ
[1:58:46] i know sister naomi she cannot be jesus
[1:58:48] christ i know sister cup she cannot be
[1:58:50] jesus christ
[1:58:51] because you limit jesus christ to 2000
[1:58:54] years ago
[1:58:55] sistine element that's one of our
[1:58:59] biggest problems
[1:59:02] that's why they stone jesus christ let
[1:59:04] me go back to history a little bit
[1:59:05] when jesus was on earth he said i am
[1:59:07] that i am
[1:59:09] you i i said before abraham i am they
[1:59:12] said no no no we can't take this we have
[1:59:14] to kill this guy
[1:59:15] what doctrine is he preaching you are
[1:59:17] not even 50 years old
[1:59:19] anywhere before abraham you have a demon
[1:59:22] you have the devil not just the demon
[1:59:24] but you are the chief of the devil
[1:59:26] you are how can you be i mean see
[1:59:27] abraham he said before abraham was
[1:59:30] i am and abraham wanted to see my day
[1:59:33] how because they're looking at jehovah
[1:59:36] that came in a pillar of fire and when
[1:59:39] it comes there's thunders and quickening
[1:59:41] and
[1:59:41] so forth by the same jehovah who did the
[1:59:44] thundering
[1:59:45] and the awakening he said i'm no longer
[1:59:47] my children cannot
[1:59:48] they told muslim moses you were built
[1:59:50] and born to to take this
[1:59:51] go speak to him whatever he tells you
[1:59:54] come tell us right we cannot this is too
[1:59:56] much for for us and our children
[1:59:57] will be good to see their building
[1:59:58] shaking fenders no no no moses please
[2:00:01] just go and take a break take your feet
[2:00:03] and just come and pray to us
[2:00:05] so moses but the lord wanted to not only
[2:00:07] to be with moses
[2:00:08] he doesn't want to stay dressing by the
[2:00:09] jack nothing brother smiley alone
[2:00:11] nothing but a salomon nothing but a troy
[2:00:14] nothing sister uh luis you want to stay
[2:00:16] in each and every one of you
[2:00:18] the young people the old every one of us
[2:00:20] you were in the mind of christ
[2:00:22] and you were christ amen so they said
[2:00:25] jesus no
[2:00:26] they wanted to kill him because they
[2:00:28] were living in history
[2:00:31] they believed java of history but when
[2:00:33] java put on flesh
[2:00:35] i said i don't know how much he weighed
[2:00:37] he was always fasting
[2:00:38] and he didn't have much with maybe 150
[2:00:40] pounds and he was working in jerusalem
[2:00:42] we didn't feel that i am that i am they
[2:00:44] said how can you be
[2:00:45] we know your mother what does mary your
[2:00:48] dad is i mean uh
[2:00:49] joseph you were even born in in a
[2:00:52] covered up kind of a whatever
[2:00:54] you know you were born in some
[2:00:56] mysterious i mean we know the story
[2:00:58] you are ill illegiti you are illegit
[2:01:00] illegitimate
[2:01:02] and you claim to be before abraham was
[2:01:05] and they were sincerely
[2:01:06] but it was sincerely wrong
[2:01:11] but now when jesus christ died and
[2:01:13] resurrected the same spirit
[2:01:15] that were in the pharisees jump upon
[2:01:17] people at that time at this time now
[2:01:19] now if you tell them that jesus christ
[2:01:21] is in this sister
[2:01:23] jesus christ is in you maybe you can
[2:01:25] have his anointing but you are not jesus
[2:01:26] christ
[2:01:27] but the same jesus christ 2000 years ago
[2:01:30] he died and resurrected
[2:01:32] and we say he's risen the end the tomb
[2:01:35] is empty
[2:01:36] so where is he now you can't tell me
[2:01:39] that he's risen
[2:01:40] that's why sometimes muslims don't
[2:01:42] believe christians because they tell the
[2:01:44] muslims that yes
[2:01:45] there's an empty tomb in jerusalem but
[2:01:47] wait see
[2:01:48] they wanted to see allah you call him
[2:01:51] jehovah or jesus
[2:01:52] that god almighty they want to see him
[2:01:54] in action so if he's raising
[2:01:57] where is he so if you can't display him
[2:02:00] in your flesh
[2:02:00] and in my flesh then we have to stop we
[2:02:03] don't have a story to tell
[2:02:07] but if he's in your flesh and in my
[2:02:08] flesh then we have to have all the
[2:02:10] boldness
[2:02:12] like peter and his brothers and sisters
[2:02:14] in the day of upper room
[2:02:15] when they were filled and drunk with the
[2:02:16] holy ghost they didn't have no
[2:02:18] limitation
[2:02:19] they prayed the gospel with boldness and
[2:02:22] the dust opened to them
[2:02:23] amen there were no hindrances because
[2:02:26] the word that was coming from them it
[2:02:28] wasn't peter the coward
[2:02:30] it was coming from jesus christ himself
[2:02:32] because he just changed his garment
[2:02:34] he wanted to be have no longer one man
[2:02:35] ministry you want to be in many members
[2:02:37] ministry
[2:02:38] a man he want to be in all the body of
[2:02:41] christ
[2:02:42] so he moved away from willie abraham and
[2:02:44] he moved into a mini-member
[2:02:46] ministry william brown preaches salmon
[2:02:48] it is the rising of the sun
[2:02:52] how can yes okay let's read the quotes
[2:02:54] quickly
[2:02:55] blessed be the lord the rise of the son
[2:02:59] paragraph
[2:03:00] 40 the first time the sun rose in
[2:03:03] genesis it was bringing
[2:03:04] a message that there will be life upon
[2:03:06] the earth mortal life
[2:03:07] that's the natural sun all the light
[2:03:10] that we see here
[2:03:11] came from the sun the first physical
[2:03:14] thing the lord created was the sun
[2:03:15] the moon the stars and all the earth
[2:03:18] planetary bodies
[2:03:19] came from the natural sun which is the
[2:03:20] type of the sun of god
[2:03:23] but this time when the sun rose there
[2:03:24] was a dual sun rising the natura
[2:03:27] which is typing the supernatural
[2:03:30] s-o-n rising it was not only sun rising
[2:03:34] s-u-n rising it was s-o-n
[2:03:37] sun had risen to bring eternal life to
[2:03:39] all
[2:03:40] gas promises that that by followage had
[2:03:44] been
[2:03:44] had been had been seen laying upon the
[2:03:46] earth
[2:03:48] before you were born your your assistant
[2:03:50] element were upon the earth
[2:03:51] the law saw the assistant element and it
[2:03:53] brought the quickening power
[2:03:55] through the natural breath and he
[2:03:56] brought a new breath so now there's
[2:03:58] another sunrise which is
[2:04:00] the son of the living god where did he
[2:04:02] rise from within you
[2:04:04] i think it's luke chapter 17 21 or 21
[2:04:06] 17.
[2:04:07] people wanted to see the kingdom of god
[2:04:09] and they went to jesus where is the
[2:04:10] kingdom of god
[2:04:12] some say go to the north the south the
[2:04:14] east go to this tabernacle
[2:04:16] said but the kingdom of god is within
[2:04:18] you
[2:04:19] it cometh not with observation you might
[2:04:22] not cut by the brother salomon
[2:04:24] you're not going to see any pillow fire
[2:04:25] in him get the best doctors to cover the
[2:04:27] jar cut me you're never going to see any
[2:04:29] physical pill of fire
[2:04:31] you're going to see lungs and a
[2:04:32] biological element
[2:04:34] you're going to see botany biology
[2:04:37] but there's the supernatural element
[2:04:39] that the doctor the best doctor in the
[2:04:41] united states cannot detect
[2:04:43] you'll be standing there amen
[2:04:46] when your loved one is dead and you are
[2:04:48] crying he's standing right there by by
[2:04:50] his
[2:04:50] flesh body it's a supernatural being
[2:04:53] if he's born again if he's got christ in
[2:04:55] him you cannot die
[2:04:57] you can lay down the garment flesh but
[2:04:59] you on the inside
[2:05:01] is not possible for you to die because
[2:05:03] eternity
[2:05:04] cannot die that's why jesus died in his
[2:05:07] flesh
[2:05:08] by the jesus the supernatural person
[2:05:10] he's been here all the time
[2:05:12] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[2:05:15] the name of the lord

[2:06:50] type the lord put a wedding ring
[2:06:52] not on your fingers but in your whole
[2:06:54] body your whole body is what is the
[2:06:56] wedding certificate
[2:06:58] and when you come on on the up here
[2:07:00] there's a scene
[2:07:01] a theophany a dimension the pillow fire
[2:07:05] the holy ghost come through the building
[2:07:08] when you say
[2:07:08] amen the word and their wife say amen
[2:07:12] they are one
[2:07:13] is the lord jesus christ saying amen to
[2:07:16] his own word
[2:07:17] amen he's preaching and he's listening
[2:07:20] and he's the only one that can do that
[2:07:22] amen there's nobody who can do but the
[2:07:24] lord himself
[2:07:25] is the one that listened the one that
[2:07:27] preaches his own word amen
[2:07:28] glory hallelujah to the lord the lord is
[2:07:31] that
[2:07:32] we have a scripture that said in the
[2:07:33] training of an uh twinkling of an eye
[2:07:35] i think first corinthians i'm not going
[2:07:37] to read is that in a
[2:07:38] training of an eye we shall be changed
[2:07:43] now we look at the twinkling of an eye
[2:07:44] as i add twinkle yes the lord can do
[2:07:46] that but you know who the eye of the
[2:07:48] lord is
[2:07:50] a prophet so when a prophet appears
[2:07:54] the eyes of the lord are twinkling he
[2:07:57] has a message for you
[2:07:59] he has a ministry to change you and you
[2:08:02] are being changed
[2:08:04] how do you change by the holy ghost
[2:08:07] baptism
[2:08:08] it's a supernatural dimension phenomenon
[2:08:11] the next person will not see what's
[2:08:13] going on but as the preacher's eye is
[2:08:15] twinkling
[2:08:16] which is the eye of the lord the word is
[2:08:18] being preached to you
[2:08:19] from a jag but a troy but a smiley by
[2:08:21] the jerry and all the ministry
[2:08:23] the eyes of the lord is trinkling on you
[2:08:26] to give you eternal life
[2:08:28] to give you change your nature you'll be
[2:08:30] sitting on pure and you'll be born again
[2:08:32] that's why jesus told uh connie is i
[2:08:34] forgot his name
[2:08:35] is that you should be born again and say
[2:08:37] how can i be born again i'm
[2:08:38] nicodemus thank you brother jack how can
[2:08:40] i be born again when i'm 50 years old
[2:08:42] plus
[2:08:43] i'm not talking about you going in your
[2:08:45] mother no i'm talking about
[2:08:47] you must die the old person
[2:08:50] dies the consuming fire consume the old
[2:08:53] person
[2:08:54] and christ is born on the inside of you
[2:08:57] and the word become activated and the
[2:09:00] work takes you over
[2:09:01] and when you are working is omnipotent
[2:09:03] god walking on two feet
[2:09:04] when you speak it's crazy speaking when
[2:09:07] you talk
[2:09:08] is the lord talking when you listen is
[2:09:10] the lord listening
[2:09:11] when you say amen is jesus christ aiming
[2:09:14] in his own word
[2:09:15] glory hallelujah to the lord and all
[2:09:17] their powers
[2:09:18] in glory all the powers in the dimension
[2:09:21] is in you you know the signs say that
[2:09:24] human beings reduce our potential
[2:09:26] we use only up to about 10 percent those
[2:09:29] who really maximize their potentials
[2:09:32] christians probably use only about two
[2:09:34] percent
[2:09:36] because we limit ourselves i don't have
[2:09:39] money
[2:09:40] i can't do this this one but the jack
[2:09:43] is the one who has to do it
[2:09:46] i can't i can't do this no so you are
[2:09:49] limited
[2:09:50] and you use only two percent if you can
[2:09:53] even
[2:09:53] go up to 15 30
[2:09:56] 50 100 your rapture is in you
[2:10:01] you don't worry about rapture coming
[2:10:02] from somewhere you are the rapture
[2:10:06] nothing can happen without you amen
[2:10:09] just like the lord couldn't do nothing
[2:10:10] without consulting abraham
[2:10:12] abraham was it was christ on earth and
[2:10:16] so when the almighty came
[2:10:17] nobody can come here and preach
[2:10:18] regardless of your message whatever the
[2:10:20] jack
[2:10:21] you can have the best message you can't
[2:10:23] just come and say the lord has sent me
[2:10:24] to preach push brother jack aside no no
[2:10:27] the dickens will come for you regardless
[2:10:30] of how strong you are
[2:10:31] they'll bundle you up and trash you
[2:10:33] somewhere amen
[2:10:35] because there's a representative of god
[2:10:36] on earth here and you can't bypass him
[2:10:39] to do anything here
[2:10:40] you can be the mega church you can be
[2:10:41] whoever you can even be the police this
[2:10:44] is the post of duty
[2:10:45] the police cannot come here no they
[2:10:47] don't have the authority
[2:10:49] the lord put the same thing put you in
[2:10:51] authority
[2:10:52] in your home in your family no demon
[2:10:55] can bypass you you've got the eyes of
[2:10:57] the lord
[2:10:58] and you can see things that the ordinary
[2:11:00] cannot see
[2:11:02] and the lord is dependent on you and i
[2:11:04] to go into action
[2:11:06] and to bring his word into manifestation
[2:11:09] but we are pushing it back
[2:11:10] tomorrow in the future one day when i
[2:11:14] die
[2:11:16] i'm gonna have a glorified body your
[2:11:19] eternity doesn't
[2:11:20] be glorified you are a tenor is a tenor
[2:11:23] that glorifies the flesh
[2:11:25] the eternal person you when it comes
[2:11:27] into your flesh
[2:11:29] let me take you to an attractive mount
[2:11:30] sinai now santa wasn't anything
[2:11:33] any any i mean holy mountain or just a
[2:11:36] regular mountain
[2:11:37] animals and tigers and this run around
[2:11:41] but when the lord chose mount sinai to
[2:11:44] be his mountain
[2:11:45] where his prophet met him everything
[2:11:47] changed
[2:11:48] mount sinai became a holy mountain where
[2:11:51] even an animal you step your foot on
[2:11:53] mount sinai you're gonna die
[2:11:55] it's only moses and those that the lord
[2:11:57] has consecrated who can go to mount
[2:11:59] sinai
[2:12:00] and if the lord has chosen you
[2:12:02] regardless of who you were
[2:12:04] you are becoming a holy mountain and
[2:12:07] nothing can touch you
[2:12:09] the lord used mounsana for some however
[2:12:11] many years
[2:12:14] is on the holy mountain rats and animals
[2:12:17] and lizards are all over mount sinai
[2:12:19] because the lord doesn't use man sana no
[2:12:21] more
[2:12:22] people tourists can go and visit but in
[2:12:24] the time of moses
[2:12:25] call yourself a tourist and go to mount
[2:12:27] sinai
[2:12:29] that i want to visit mount sinai i'm a
[2:12:31] tourist from the united states
[2:12:33] i want to see how mansana is like okay
[2:12:35] you're going to be a dead body
[2:12:39] you can't do that because that mountain
[2:12:42] is the lost mountain
[2:12:43] not everybody can touch the mount sinai
[2:12:46] and you are the man you are greater than
[2:12:47] man sana is here
[2:12:49] nobody can touch you no no demon no
[2:12:51] death amen
[2:12:53] no coronavirus can't touch you because
[2:12:55] he that is in you
[2:12:56] is greater than he does in the world
[2:12:59] until the lord himself when the lord
[2:13:00] decided that okay moses i'm down with
[2:13:02] mount sinai
[2:13:03] now taurus can go to mount sinai if the
[2:13:05] lord decides to this flesh
[2:13:07] to decay it now the devil can take over
[2:13:10] and do whatever you want to do with it
[2:13:11] but as long as the lord is living in it
[2:13:13] he'll heal it he wash it
[2:13:15] you when when the flesh gets discouraged
[2:13:17] the one is crying
[2:13:19] you wipe your tears he said i'll be with
[2:13:21] you even in you
[2:13:23] on to the end of this world but as long
[2:13:26] as he's living in you
[2:13:27] if you are going to live thousand years
[2:13:28] you don't have to worry
[2:13:31] a brother had cancer and he was
[2:13:33] hospitalized
[2:13:34] state for cancer and the doctor said of
[2:13:37] course you know said four it means
[2:13:39] you are going you are gone almost gone
[2:13:42] and in the hospital the angel of the
[2:13:44] lord visited him said you are not you
[2:13:45] are not
[2:13:45] it's not your time and so i didn't care
[2:13:48] about what the doctor said
[2:13:50] when the lord visited you visit you you
[2:13:52] listen to the
[2:13:53] the lord he's greater than the doctors
[2:13:55] it doesn't matter what stage of cancer
[2:13:57] it doesn't matter the variant of
[2:13:58] chronovirus yes you could be infected a
[2:14:01] lot can allow it
[2:14:02] you can get sick even jesus had
[2:14:04] headaches
[2:14:06] but the lord living in you i'll be with
[2:14:09] you
[2:14:10] even in you on to the end of the world
[2:14:12] glory hallelujah
[2:14:19] give me a couple minutes i'm closing and
[2:14:21] i have a piece of advice for
[2:14:23] i want to speak something real-time
[2:14:26] situation
[2:14:26] amen for a young people a man because we
[2:14:30] are living in a real time
[2:14:32] where coronavirus has changed the whole
[2:14:34] world how
[2:14:35] even business corporate world do their
[2:14:38] business
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:42] corporate will find out that people can
[2:14:44] be more productive when they work at
[2:14:45] home
[2:14:46] so some companies they are not returning
[2:14:48] to the offices they rent offices
[2:14:50] pay for utilities pay for electricity
[2:14:54] uh rent uh water and what a view
[2:14:57] but then if you work from your home they
[2:14:59] don't pay for electricity they don't
[2:15:00] make coffee for you
[2:15:02] you make your own coffee and you have it
[2:15:04] more productive
[2:15:05] and you put more pocket in there in the
[2:15:07] pocket of the corporate world
[2:15:09] they make more millions and billions and
[2:15:10] trillions from you so hey work from your
[2:15:13] home

[2:15:28] jack used to have a lot of meetings for
[2:15:30] young people
[2:15:31] you know we used to go to other places
[2:15:32] but now with chronovirus it's been more
[2:15:34] than a year there's no meeting here
[2:15:36] how am i going to meet my husband and my
[2:15:37] wife
[2:15:39] i mean i want to have my husband and
[2:15:41] children before the rapture
[2:15:42] i don't know what's going on i don't
[2:15:46] know but jack is not announcing any
[2:15:47] young people's meeting
[2:15:49] where are we going to where's the
[2:15:50] chronovirus taking us to
[2:15:52] you know but the lord is not limited to
[2:15:54] chronic virus
[2:15:56] i'm going to give you a testimony and uh
[2:15:59] and uh to you for you to be encouraged
[2:16:01] that the lord is in charge of every
[2:16:03] situation
[2:16:04] and it's not limited to the dictations
[2:16:05] of chronovirus amen it's not limited to
[2:16:08] even to meetings young people's meeting
[2:16:10] the lord has obtained your husband and
[2:16:11] your wife for you before the foundation
[2:16:12] of the world
[2:16:13] and wherever he or she is you get him
[2:16:16] amen there was
[2:16:18] a brother somewhere the story is in two
[2:16:21] parts let me speak one part and this
[2:16:22] brother was
[2:16:23] he's finished college and he had a
[2:16:24] scholarship to go and study in a certain
[2:16:26] country in europe
[2:16:27] so the brother at the same time he went
[2:16:29] to he had some friends who were
[2:16:30] believers
[2:16:30] and so he went to visit their friends
[2:16:31] and they were talking and they said well
[2:16:33] how about they
[2:16:34] in the conversation their younger
[2:16:35] sisters or their friends came in
[2:16:37] and it's all my our sister is no longer
[2:16:39] a younger sister she's a big sister so
[2:16:41] this is a number if you want to say hi
[2:16:43] to her you can do that
[2:16:44] so the brother pick his number and he
[2:16:46] called and stones begin to his tones
[2:16:48] iraq began to hit racks and he changed
[2:16:51] her love story
[2:16:52] so to make the long story short that
[2:16:53] brother said you know what i have
[2:16:55] scholarship going to this country
[2:16:56] and this is in this country in europe so
[2:16:59] what do you do
[2:17:00] and your friend said that look take the
[2:17:02] scholarship trash it
[2:17:04] go marry your wife that's what you need
[2:17:05] you don't need a scholarship
[2:17:07] so the brother went and got married to
[2:17:09] his wife
[2:17:10] after some time their brother another
[2:17:11] brother they better visit and in the
[2:17:13] visit that says that's give a testimony
[2:17:15] to their brother i said look brother
[2:17:16] i was 20 28 years old and i was
[2:17:19] struggling
[2:17:21] this is a real time human human human
[2:17:22] being experienced so i was struggling i
[2:17:24] couldn't take it normal i told the law
[2:17:26] that
[2:17:26] lord if you don't give me my husband i'm
[2:17:29] going to get my husband from the
[2:17:30] pentecostal so i can't take it no more
[2:17:33] and the same time she was thinking about
[2:17:34] this the lord ordained someone he has
[2:17:36] already ordained
[2:17:38] but the lord made a way for the right
[2:17:39] person she was in europe
[2:17:42] the person was in africa and the lord
[2:17:44] somehow threw the sisters brothers
[2:17:46] connected to them because their brother
[2:17:48] the sister has gone through all the camp
[2:17:49] meetings this is the people in the
[2:17:51] church where all the people that were
[2:17:52] already married
[2:17:53] and those that she's all far older than
[2:17:55] them so there was there seemed to be
[2:17:57] there was no hope for her
[2:17:58] and she's a human being she's got a
[2:18:00] hemoglobin and blood in her
[2:18:02] and so she was going through issues say
[2:18:04] lord i can't take it no more the
[2:18:05] loneliness is too much
[2:18:07] i need help else i go find me a husband
[2:18:09] from the pentecostal from the other
[2:18:10] church
[2:18:11] but that's not what the lord has done
[2:18:13] has ordained for you the lord has
[2:18:15] ordained for you
[2:18:16] the one that will be an angel of the
[2:18:17] lord to you as you are an angel of the
[2:18:20] lord to him
[2:18:21] the one that will understand you the one
[2:18:23] that will cover your mistakes
[2:18:25] another one that would throw you away at
[2:18:27] a slighted mystic there was a man that
[2:18:30] invited his friends to come and dine and
[2:18:33] when
[2:18:33] the the wife prepared food and it was as
[2:18:36] if they were
[2:18:36] for a jaguar a jug a jar of salt in the
[2:18:39] food
[2:18:40] it was so salty beyond saltiness
[2:18:44] so when the man tasted the food he has
[2:18:46] to come up with something to you know
[2:18:48] cover the wife he said look i'm so sorry
[2:18:49] friends
[2:18:50] i'm so sorry i didn't tell you my
[2:18:52] tastebuds are gone
[2:18:54] so i let my wife pour in so much salt
[2:18:56] and i forgot that you guys were coming i
[2:18:58] i should have told you actually i told
[2:19:00] her to
[2:19:01] to minimize the salt but i forgot so
[2:19:03] it's all my fault
[2:19:06] and the man covered his wife their
[2:19:08] friends didn't know that
[2:19:09] the woman didn't know how to cook he
[2:19:11] covered his wife
[2:19:12] and after they took it over you know and
[2:19:14] a true man of god
[2:19:16] and one that truly loves you will cover
[2:19:18] you up the one that loves your flesh
[2:19:21] and not you your holy ghost
[2:19:24] will just take your flesh and drop you
[2:19:26] when he doesn't need you
[2:19:28] and his vice versa a woman that wants
[2:19:30] your money you are loaded
[2:19:31] you are enterprising you are industrious
[2:19:33] you want your money you know
[2:19:35] gold digger when you give the gold and
[2:19:36] there's no more gold
[2:19:38] you leave the land and go and look for
[2:19:39] another land to dig more gold
[2:19:44] but but if the lord give it to you if
[2:19:46] the lord gives it to you
[2:19:48] you are covered there's not the lord
[2:19:51] doesn't take back when they give it to
[2:19:52] you
[2:19:52] it's christ and christ together is
[2:19:55] christ himself and the lord will give
[2:19:57] you somebody who holds you up let me use
[2:19:59] william brown for example some of you
[2:20:01] the lord has made you
[2:20:02] your spiritual entity not every man can
[2:20:05] handle you
[2:20:06] some of you brothers your spiritual
[2:20:08] entities not everyone can handle you
[2:20:10] even among the sons of god if they line
[2:20:12] up about let's say a thousand
[2:20:14] sons of god who are followed the holy
[2:20:16] ghost maybe none of them will appeal to
[2:20:18] you
[2:20:19] or maybe the only one will put to you
[2:20:21] and he's the one the lord you were with
[2:20:22] before the foundation of the world
[2:20:24] glory hallelujah to the lord if you take
[2:20:26] anything else beside that
[2:20:28] it's not gonna work you're in trouble if
[2:20:31] you look upon
[2:20:32] you look over your husband's shoulder to
[2:20:33] see another man then he wasn't the right
[2:20:35] man for you
[2:20:37] if you look on top of your wife's
[2:20:38] shoulder to see another woman
[2:20:40] she wasn't your wife to begin with
[2:20:43] the one that is for you ordained for you
[2:20:45] before the financial world
[2:20:47] if the alliance 10 billion rich men
[2:20:50] you meander through them and go and pick
[2:20:52] this poor brother
[2:20:54] because your heart and his heart is
[2:20:56] connected there's no even reason to wait
[2:20:59] how do you love this guy i don't even
[2:21:00] know how do you love this man i don't
[2:21:02] know
[2:21:03] how do you love this lady there's
[2:21:04] something in you deep calling for the
[2:21:06] deep
[2:21:07] and that's how the lord bless people so
[2:21:08] circumstances doesn't limit the lord
[2:21:10] let me use brother brown for example
[2:21:12] brother jack was talking about our
[2:21:13] mother's
[2:21:14] happy mother's day last week but abram's
[2:21:16] wife
[2:21:17] of course we know he had a first wife he
[2:21:19] loved him but the mother the wife's
[2:21:21] mother was a problem
[2:21:22] so the lord has to take sister hope away
[2:21:24] and
[2:21:29] it also means prophetess in indian
[2:21:32] native indian language
[2:21:33] so the lord ordains the hope um sister
[2:21:36] mida for but abraham
[2:21:38] somebody that wasn't c visions like
[2:21:40] abram was seen visions
[2:21:42] she wasn't supernatural lady who sees
[2:21:44] visions
[2:21:45] their hazmat abraham used to see vision
[2:21:47] but the lord used sister media to
[2:21:49] balance but abraham
[2:21:50] in his way abram had never breakdown he
[2:21:53] was
[2:21:54] he was a very spiritual person and
[2:21:56] sometimes people are very sensitive
[2:21:58] and they are navals so when he on
[2:22:00] arizona when the lord told him to
[2:22:02] consecrate himself and he was ready to
[2:22:04] reveal the mystery
[2:22:05] of the servant seal he went to arizona
[2:22:08] there was a blast you know the blast
[2:22:10] where he thought it was the end of his
[2:22:12] life it was beyond what a human being
[2:22:14] can comprehend and i'll show you an
[2:22:15] example of how
[2:22:16] the supernatural blends with that
[2:22:18] natural so when he came back home
[2:22:19] he thought that was the end of him so he
[2:22:21] told his wife go get with
[2:22:23] i think it's my end so go and stay with
[2:22:24] billy paul and make sure that you don't
[2:22:25] go through high school and so forth
[2:22:27] and mira said billy the deloted told you
[2:22:29] is going to take your life
[2:22:31] he said how can i stand how can a person
[2:22:33] stand this this thing
[2:22:35] he i think is the end of sun or the lord
[2:22:36] he didn't tell he's going to take your
[2:22:37] life
[2:22:39] and the lord used his wife to bring him
[2:22:41] the balance
[2:22:43] it's not a mystery he didn't preach
[2:22:44] mystery to him but he needed to let you
[2:22:46] know that the lord didn't take he's
[2:22:47] going to take your life
[2:22:48] calm down boy and be at peace get from
[2:22:51] the supernatural
[2:22:52] and be a human being and the lord
[2:22:54] brought him down to earth
[2:22:57] you know that's if the lord chose for
[2:22:59] you he'll bless you
[2:23:00] but if you go and get something that you
[2:23:02] can't carry it's going to be a headache
[2:23:05] the lord used uh uh sister media in
[2:23:07] summit bram used to say that
[2:23:08] mida is only 35 and she's gone
[2:23:11] completely white gray hair
[2:23:13] when i think was in rebecca one of their
[2:23:14] daughters were born but brown went
[2:23:16] around the world
[2:23:17] six months when it came back i think it
[2:23:20] wasn't even there when the daughter was
[2:23:21] born or he was born when she was there
[2:23:22] he went to preaching how many women can
[2:23:25] do that
[2:23:26] you go preaching around the world and as
[2:23:28] you stay six months
[2:23:30] when you come you go to the court and go
[2:23:31] and get your divorce papers or you get
[2:23:33] the divorce in the mail
[2:23:35] she's not even there she's gone but the
[2:23:37] lord gave him someone who is ordained
[2:23:38] and consecrated for his ministry
[2:23:41] there was a time stamina even he didn't
[2:23:42] see the pillar of fire she had the holy
[2:23:44] ghost
[2:23:44] but she didn't explain the pillow fire
[2:23:46] until brother jack most church
[2:23:48] but jack mo put but stamina was very
[2:23:50] timid so she
[2:23:51] kind of laid back and jack mo put them
[2:23:54] on on on the spot said i want
[2:23:56] brown family to come in i think sing or
[2:23:57] something like that so they came
[2:23:59] to the platform and he saw the pillow of
[2:24:01] fire well around but abraham
[2:24:04] and that was her first time i mean
[2:24:06] ordinary people have been seeing a pill
[2:24:08] of fire
[2:24:08] all the time in the meetings on abraham
[2:24:11] on the sick people
[2:24:12] in the congregation but his own wife
[2:24:14] never saw the pillar of fire with
[2:24:16] her own eyes but this time on the
[2:24:18] property saw abraham was talking
[2:24:19] going around he was seeing the pill of
[2:24:21] fire following him leading him
[2:24:23] and so he came i said billy i saw it for
[2:24:26] myself this is the first time i saw the
[2:24:27] pill of fire
[2:24:28] around you but at the home she was the
[2:24:31] one who takes charge
[2:24:33] of abraham we were ordinary people sick
[2:24:35] people who come from some of them were
[2:24:37] not even
[2:24:37] will i say they are not a great
[2:24:40] christians
[2:24:40] but they were seeing the pillar of fire
[2:24:42] but the lord ordained
[2:24:44] system either for her to be the right
[2:24:46] person for it i don't have time i would
[2:24:47] have take gone through some

[2:25:18] to
[2:25:18] i want to give a word of advice and
[2:25:20] encouragement that the lord is in
[2:25:21] control

[2:25:46] go and do my own thing you're going to
[2:25:48] get something load you can't carry
[2:25:50] and your neck is going to break but you
[2:25:52] stay in the shape if you have a problem
[2:25:54] if you like the sister get to a place
[2:25:55] you can't control you can't take it no

[2:26:11] the lord will let you go get
[2:26:13] but can you carry that load it's going
[2:26:15] to be a
[2:26:16] misery pain and crying but if you wait
[2:26:19] humbly upon the lord
[2:26:21] patiently the lord will give you what he
[2:26:23] has with them for you
[2:26:25] let's read a let me see let's read
[2:26:28] genesis
[2:26:30] 41 41-46
[2:26:35] praise be to the lord
[2:26:40] genesis 41 41-46 and pharaoh said unto
[2:26:44] joseph
[2:26:45] see i have set thee all over the land of
[2:26:47] egypt
[2:26:48] and pharaoh took off his ring from his
[2:26:50] hand and put it upon joseph's hand
[2:26:53] and i read him in a virtue of finally
[2:26:55] leaning and put a gold chain about his
[2:26:57] neck
[2:26:58] and he made him to ride in the second
[2:26:59] chariot which he had
[2:27:01] and they cried before him bowed the knee
[2:27:03] and he made him ruler
[2:27:04] over all the land of egypt and pharaoh
[2:27:07] said unto joseph i am pharaoh and
[2:27:09] without thee
[2:27:10] no man left up his hand or foot in all
[2:27:12] the land of egypt
[2:27:13] 45 and pharaoh called his name zafnap
[2:27:16] penang
[2:27:17] and he gave him a wife asanath the
[2:27:19] daughter of potiphar priest of
[2:27:20] on and joseph went out over all the land
[2:27:23] of
[2:27:24] the land of egypt and joseph was 30
[2:27:26] years old when he stood before pharaoh
[2:27:28] king of egypt and joseph went out from
[2:27:30] the presence of pharaoh and went
[2:27:31] throughout all the land of egypt
[2:27:33] now look at joseph you know the story of
[2:27:35] joseph
[2:27:36] he was the son of what uh jacob
[2:27:40] and he was a beloved son because the
[2:27:42] lord gave him a a little gift
[2:27:44] and his brothers thought to you know
[2:27:45] they were jealous and they wanted to
[2:27:47] destroy him
[2:27:48] but look at the plan of god when you
[2:27:49] stay in the perfect will of the lord
[2:27:51] the lord he went through battles upon
[2:27:52] battles the christian general is not
[2:27:54] uh roses all the time yes sometimes we
[2:27:57] have roses
[2:27:58] and butter and bread and uh picnics
[2:28:02] but sometimes a lot allows hard trials
[2:28:06] to train you to mold you and that's
[2:28:08] where a lot of
[2:28:09] us make our mistakes because of the
[2:28:12] trials
[2:28:12] i'm living i'm gone i'm no longer coming
[2:28:15] to church
[2:28:16] i'm out of this church i've been here
[2:28:17] for years what i've been praying for the
[2:28:19] lord
[2:28:20] hasn't given to me the lord don't be
[2:28:22] like soul
[2:28:23] so almost go to the promise but
[2:28:25] impatient
[2:28:27] led him to dispossess himself of the
[2:28:29] promise
[2:28:30] wait patiently on the lord so let me
[2:28:32] just finish so pharaoh
[2:28:34] was giving a wife his wife means he's a
[2:28:36] daughter of the pyramid
[2:28:38] doesn't mean of asana she was a
[2:28:41] spiritual man she was a you know old old
[2:28:42] testament they
[2:28:43] called them men prophet the women had
[2:28:46] the same the women also had the same
[2:28:48] spirit of the lord in them jehovah in
[2:28:49] them
[2:28:50] and the lord who didn't before
[2:28:51] foundation of the word ordained asked
[2:28:53] not
[2:28:54] to help balance the ministry of joseph
[2:28:58] abraham had her his wife right from his
[2:29:00] half-sister from
[2:29:02] babylon where the lord called him from
[2:29:04] now his sons
[2:29:05] isaac had a rebecca look at the story of
[2:29:09] rebecca
[2:29:10] rebecca didn't know isaac there was no
[2:29:12] instagram to chat to see the picture of
[2:29:14] isaac
[2:29:16] there's no facebook to be friend with
[2:29:17] isaac to see how isaac is
[2:29:19] friends and people that has economy what
[2:29:21] he says he put on facebook no
[2:29:23] but she went by revelation of jesus
[2:29:25] christ or jehovah it does not they call
[2:29:27] him jehovah
[2:29:28] he didn't know nothing about isaac but
[2:29:31] there was something in her she was a
[2:29:32] prayerful woman
[2:29:34] she had a spirit of christ in her and so
[2:29:37] when eliezer came
[2:29:39] and proposed to him that i want to give
[2:29:40] my sons and my master's son is looking
[2:29:42] for a wife
[2:29:44] they told his parents her parents and
[2:29:46] they agree the parent didn't try to even
[2:29:48] hold her she said no i'm going
[2:29:50] because she had a revelation and watched
[2:29:52] as they were going to stand they had
[2:29:53] they didn't have a cameras and loosens
[2:29:55] they were just riding on horses and and
[2:29:58] chariots
[2:29:59] and they saw probably saw a lot of men
[2:30:00] young men along the way
[2:30:03] but nothing no none of them attracted
[2:30:04] when he saw he met isaac
[2:30:06] he said who is he who is this man
[2:30:09] they say deep in her the lord in her
[2:30:12] telling her this man is the one i'm
[2:30:14] giving to you he said who is this one
[2:30:16] he said he's my master son he's the one
[2:30:18] who's gonna get married
[2:30:19] and the lord has got appointed
[2:30:21] designated son or daughter for you
[2:30:24] and he's the only one that your life
[2:30:27] will be a balance
[2:30:28] amen if you go for something else it's
[2:30:31] going to be a catastrophe
[2:30:33] amen and so look at even eyes joseph
[2:30:35] regardless of his condition
[2:30:37] you know where he was trying to move
[2:30:38] from country to country trash upon
[2:30:40] trials
[2:30:41] joseph could have counted himself out
[2:30:43] but he knew that jehovah
[2:30:45] has him in control and if you stay in
[2:30:47] the boat
[2:30:48] if you stay with the ministry if you
[2:30:50] stay with your pastor
[2:30:52] everything's going to be all right for
[2:30:53] you you don't have to struggle
[2:30:55] you don't have to go looking for
[2:30:56] somebody the lord has ordained it for
[2:30:58] you amen
[2:31:00] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[2:31:01] read the last scripture uh
[2:31:03] exodus
[2:31:07] chapter two now moses his story is
[2:31:10] similar to uh
[2:31:11] to joseph let's read ezra chapter 2
[2:31:15] verse 16 to 20 22.
[2:31:17] someone read for me oh it's right here
[2:31:20] thank you
[2:31:21] but someone can read for me
[2:31:26] now the priest of midian had seven
[2:31:28] daughters and they came and drew water
[2:31:30] and filled
[2:31:31] the troughs to water their father's
[2:31:33] flock
[2:31:34] and the shepherds came and drove them
[2:31:36] away but moses stood up and helped them
[2:31:38] and watered their flock when they came
[2:31:40] to ruel
[2:31:41] their father he said how is it that year
[2:31:43] comes so soon today
[2:31:45] and they said an egyptian delivered us
[2:31:47] out of the hand of the shepherds and
[2:31:49] also drew water enough for us and
[2:31:51] watered the flock
[2:31:52] and he said unto his daughters and where
[2:31:55] is he
[2:31:56] why is it that you have left the man
[2:31:58] call him that he may eat bread
[2:32:00] and moses was content to dwell with the
[2:32:02] man and he gave
[2:32:04] moses zipporah his daughter and she bare
[2:32:07] him a son and he called his name
[2:32:08] gershom for he said i have been a
[2:32:10] stranger in a strange land
[2:32:16] amen now look at moses your story
[2:32:19] is there where is the moses is corona
[2:32:22] where is that the cancer travel and fly
[2:32:25] moses was stranded he was actually a
[2:32:28] what is his condition he killed somebody
[2:32:30] in egypt so he couldn't go back to egypt
[2:32:32] to his people
[2:32:33] so he was stranded in median but the
[2:32:35] lord has ordained
[2:32:37] even in your mistake in your wrongs
[2:32:40] the lord eternity how do i even explain
[2:32:43] it let's take like an end
[2:32:44] right put an ant in the palm of your
[2:32:47] hands
[2:32:48] count 20 seconds and then another auntie
[2:32:51] said oh glory i'm now
[2:32:53] i'm now free i've left the hands of the
[2:32:55] man
[2:32:56] i'm free i'm gone he doesn't do that
[2:32:58] he's just in the palm of your hands
[2:33:01] you are in the palms of god's hands
[2:33:04] regardless of your trials
[2:33:06] your brokenness whatever you're going
[2:33:08] through you are in the palm of his love
[2:33:11] and this love converts you amen the lord
[2:33:14] already before moses made mistake kill
[2:33:16] somebody and went to a
[2:33:18] medium the lord has already obtained a
[2:33:19] wife for him he didn't even know
[2:33:22] so moses was just a young man just like
[2:33:24] any other young man
[2:33:26] and this sisters they didn't have a the
[2:33:28] lord put you know marriage sometimes the
[2:33:30] lord use it
[2:33:31] use marriage to bring redemption not
[2:33:34] only to their wife or to the husband
[2:33:36] but to their family to community to
[2:33:38] people
[2:33:39] it looks like uh what's the name of the
[2:33:41] past um the man
[2:33:43] rahu or whatever moses father-in-law
[2:33:44] didn't have a sons
[2:33:46] he has seven daughters and those times
[2:33:48] the occupation is agriculture and
[2:33:50] farming and
[2:33:50] uh livestock take care of your father's
[2:33:52] goats and sheep and what have you
[2:33:54] and so these people take these girls
[2:33:56] take their that is a
[2:33:58] sheep and goats and cow and whatever to
[2:34:00] go and clean them and wash them and i
[2:34:02] mean get grass for them
[2:34:03] and they were they were sons of uh
[2:34:05] ishmael
[2:34:06] you know the sons of ishmael and sons of
[2:34:09] isaac
[2:34:09] they are each of these fruits if you
[2:34:11] read the news in israel and
[2:34:13] hamas they are hanging on each other's
[2:34:16] throats
[2:34:17] they didn't start today it was way back
[2:34:19] over there so
[2:34:20] sons of ishmael would come and grab the
[2:34:22] good from the girls they were girls you
[2:34:23] know they were ladies they couldn't
[2:34:24] fight this man so moses saw it
[2:34:26] and no he just stood up for them washed
[2:34:28] their ship and so forth he didn't even
[2:34:30] say nothing
[2:34:31] the lord will work on your behalf when
[2:34:34] you find favor with the lord
[2:34:35] don't rush just wait on him and watch
[2:34:38] the holy ghost working for you
[2:34:41] some people rush and destroy things i
[2:34:42] had ahead of them blessing
[2:34:44] mostly didn't say nothing she was just
[2:34:46] kind to them
[2:34:47] help them was in his way and they went
[2:34:50] to tell their father how come you guys
[2:34:52] you i mean you you've come back so early
[2:34:54] say well we saw an egyptian who
[2:34:55] watered our sheep and did whatever why
[2:34:58] didn't you bring him to eat bread
[2:35:00] bring him next time they brought moses
[2:35:02] home and moses the lord has put upon a
[2:35:04] man's heart
[2:35:05] to give him a one of his daughters for a
[2:35:08] wife
[2:35:08] zipporah means a comma the lord was
[2:35:11] beginning to minister the law is a comma
[2:35:12] it's not the end grace was coming in
[2:35:15] jesus and paul was coming in
[2:35:17] so even the wife and the husband the
[2:35:18] lord gives you types who your ministry
[2:35:21] taps your predestination taps who you
[2:35:23] are no matter the battles of life
[2:35:25] amen and the lord blessed moses
[2:35:28] through his wife the wife was sometimes
[2:35:31] a redeemer in moses way
[2:35:33] moses was always on the supernatural
[2:35:34] side and he forgot to even circumcise
[2:35:36] his own children
[2:35:38] sometimes you don't know what ministers
[2:35:39] go through you don't know what pastors
[2:35:41] go through
[2:35:42] they'll pray the word to you but their
[2:35:43] children suffer
[2:35:45] they're battles that they go through
[2:35:46] because they're always thinking about
[2:35:47] the church
[2:35:48] and sometimes they even know that they
[2:35:49] forget about us on that they don't take
[2:35:50] care of their own family
[2:35:52] like they take of the church so
[2:35:54] sometimes you see a pastor's
[2:35:55] children going with what don't blame
[2:35:57] them oh he said pastor look at his
[2:35:58] children
[2:36:01] his blessing is coming upon you and the
[2:36:03] battles is coming to him
[2:36:07] you know the battle you should oppose to
[2:36:08] your children he feels the battles
[2:36:10] and the devil gets annoyed with him and
[2:36:12] the bad day raids come upon him because
[2:36:14] he's standing here to preach
[2:36:15] you know what happens when the pastor is
[2:36:17] preaching when medicines are preaching
[2:36:19] life is being changed are receiving the
[2:36:22] holy ghost
[2:36:23] demons are being cast away healing is
[2:36:25] taking place
[2:36:26] the devil is being dispossessed of his
[2:36:28] inheritance maybe
[2:36:30] the devil possessed me bless the devil
[2:36:32] is using me to rob people in miami
[2:36:34] west palm beach and that's what what is
[2:36:36] he want to do
[2:36:37] and now but preaches to me and i stopped
[2:36:40] i stopped
[2:36:40] becoming an armed robber the devil is
[2:36:42] not happy so what is he going to do
[2:36:45] is going to attack him so that's what
[2:36:47] preachers go through
[2:36:48] so you pray for your pastor support your
[2:36:50] pastor love your pastor
[2:36:52] don't condemn him amen don't don't look
[2:36:55] down because oh look at look at the
[2:36:57] ministers

[2:37:00] they might be even way off
[2:37:02] because of where they are standing and
[2:37:05] you can go to the bible
[2:37:06] you can look at abraham so you pray for
[2:37:09] your ministers
[2:37:10] because sometimes what they go to they
[2:37:11] don't tell you amen is their calling
[2:37:13] and allah equip them to face those
[2:37:15] battles so they stand on your behalf
[2:37:17] and intercede on your behalf they'll

[2:40:46] you
[2:40:58] praise the lord how many appreciate
[2:40:59] brother quaku uh
[2:41:01] on today
[2:41:04] i um there's a number of things that
[2:41:08] that that were spoken today that i just
[2:41:10] felt was um
[2:41:11] very very important one of the things
[2:41:13] was this
[2:41:14] the first quote that he read uh
[2:41:18] i actually forgot to announce this
[2:41:19] little earlier but um
[2:41:21] can we just go back to that quote it was
[2:41:23] out of um
[2:41:26] uh the second coming
[2:41:30] the message the second coming just just
[2:41:32] go back to that for me really quick
[2:41:34] um but i just appreciate just
[2:41:38] how the lord just kind of deals with
[2:41:39] brother kwaku just
[2:41:41] very very special gift you know uh
[2:41:44] that that god has given us here he said
[2:41:47] um
[2:41:49] then another thing i believe that when
[2:41:51] satan which was prophesied would go
[2:41:53] about like a wrong line in the last days
[2:41:54] of strong mortal life and spiritual life
[2:41:56] and everything that he could
[2:41:58] i believe then if he if all the dumpings
[2:42:00] of all this evil is being dumped out in
[2:42:02] the human race in this day i believe
[2:42:04] that all the blessings will be dumped
[2:42:05] out
[2:42:07] all the evil dumbed out
[2:42:12] all the blessings gonna be dumped out
[2:42:14] and and i don't know if
[2:42:15] i don't know about you but i'm on the
[2:42:17] expectation for blessing upon blessing
[2:42:19] if i'm blessing up on blessing
[2:42:21] because that's that's what god has
[2:42:22] promised me he says by the heavenly
[2:42:24] father upon the church
[2:42:25] in this last day says and what a day
[2:42:28] we're living
[2:42:29] says i hope i can see them coming i
[2:42:30] believe we're in it now
[2:42:32] i just hope i live to see today when i
[2:42:34] can see them coming from arizona across
[2:42:36] the wilderness and joining hands
[2:42:38] together for a meeting in the air what a
[2:42:39] day that will
[2:42:40] be and um you know as he was just going
[2:42:42] he's making a point about
[2:42:44] um uh brother branham had an another
[2:42:47] quote where
[2:42:48] uh he was pretty much saying we're in
[2:42:49] the coming of the lord right now you
[2:42:51] know we're not looking for it
[2:42:52] we're living in it right now not
[2:42:54] somebody coming out the
[2:42:55] sky with some horn blowing if you're not
[2:42:58] hearing the trumpet sound right now
[2:43:00] the jubilee trumpet come on somebody
[2:43:04] it's a jubilee trumpet that sound that
[2:43:06] you won't have to be
[2:43:07] bound anymore in denomination hallelujah

[2:46:20] knows all things right
[2:46:22] the lord knows all things um i
[2:46:25] i was um
[2:46:28] um thinking here and and and uh uh while
[2:46:32] sister dixon was just kind of there i
[2:46:34] was she was mentioning something to me
[2:46:36] yesterday you know
[2:46:37] things happen in our lives that um
[2:46:40] others would have no idea uh
[2:46:44] it may not mean anything to them but it
[2:46:46] means it means so much to us
[2:46:49] and she you know when she's feeling up
[2:46:51] to it we'll have her just kind of give
[2:46:52] the testimony but just a little portion
[2:46:54] she told me she said she was listening
[2:46:56] to
[2:46:56] the doctor she was coming out of her
[2:47:00] uh procedure and doctor said um
[2:47:03] that uh on the seventh time we were able
[2:47:06] to get something that they were trying
[2:47:07] to do
[2:47:08] and they could not get it done until
[2:47:10] like the seventh time
[2:47:11] it was successful in the seventh time
[2:47:13] and she said she said seven times so
[2:47:15] for her it brought encouragement it
[2:47:17] brought um
[2:47:19] it brought comfort because uh even
[2:47:22] though the doctor's thinking like oh
[2:47:23] lord we we couldn't get this thing right
[2:47:25] we couldn't get it but on the seven
[2:47:26] times
[2:47:27] so he's like no that's exactly what i
[2:47:28] need to hear god was in it
[2:47:30] if you got seven mean completion to us
[2:47:33] right
[2:47:33] so so even even coming from underneath
[2:47:35] anesthesia and everything she heard
[2:47:37] seven times like that's that's it
[2:47:38] god was with me through this whole
[2:47:40] process so you know sometimes different
[2:47:42] things will happen and
[2:47:43] and we just thank god for it all uh he's
[2:47:46] still worthy to be praised in the midst
[2:47:47] of it all so
[2:47:48] we give him glory let's have a word of
[2:47:50] prayer amen and
[2:47:52] uh we'll we'll prepare to dismiss you on
[2:47:56] the day god we thank you
[2:47:59] um thank you for your
[2:48:02] your word that has been brought to our
[2:48:04] hearts lord and
[2:48:05] and this brother quake who just kind of
[2:48:07] taken us through a journey there and
[2:48:10] lord we could see the different
[2:48:11] junctions in life
[2:48:13] uh lord from marriage and uh
[2:48:16] young people lord waiting for you to
[2:48:19] provide a a spouse and
[2:48:21] not to get ahead of you lord to see how
[2:48:23] you operate in the lives of other how
[2:48:25] god you send certain people in our lives
[2:48:27] to help balance us and to keep us lord
[2:48:29] uh
[2:48:30] in in in check uh you do that you have
[2:48:32] purpose for for all of that
[2:48:35] lord to to help us to see how close we
[2:48:37] are to the coming of the lord that
[2:48:39] your promises in your word that it would
[2:48:42] be in the moment in the twinkling of an
[2:48:43] eye
[2:48:44] god that we would be changed and uh lord
[2:48:47] if we just look at that a little
[2:48:49] from a different angle here this morning
[2:48:51] that twinkling eyes
[2:48:52] and a prophet is is the eyes of god
[2:48:55] that you use you use a prophetic
[2:48:58] ministry
[2:48:59] as as your eyes so lord when we see a
[2:49:01] prophet come on the scene one that's
[2:49:03] promised according to scripture malachi
[2:49:05] 4 speaks of him revelation 10 speaks of
[2:49:08] him
[2:49:09] saint luke 17 matthew 17 there's various
[2:49:12] scriptures that speak of the coming of
[2:49:14] of that prophetic ministry in the last
[2:49:16] days so god
[2:49:17] as we keep our eyes on that and watch it
[2:49:20] fulfill and unfold then we know father
[2:49:22] we are in the coming
[2:49:23] of the lord i pray father that uh that
[2:49:26] you would just strengthen the people
[2:49:27] touch
[2:49:28] each and every one uh just just think of
[2:49:32] lord just
[2:49:33] the the the children of israel as they
[2:49:35] were leaving
[2:49:36] egypt they were preparing to leave egypt
[2:49:38] it seemed like the taskmasters put them
[2:49:40] under the load and they were just
[2:49:42] probably so wore out
[2:49:43] from the things that they were going
[2:49:46] through but yet god it was during that
[2:49:47] time
[2:49:48] that they were preparing for a great
[2:49:50] exodus and lord i i noticed that
[2:49:53] not not just the people but even myself
[2:49:55] just thinking about it on yesterday
[2:49:57] lord just seemed like just so busy doing
[2:49:59] this and busy doing that and
[2:50:01] and so wore out that when you come to
[2:50:03] the house of god
[2:50:04] you're tired so so hard to enter in
[2:50:07] because
[2:50:08] your body's so tired but god even in the
[2:50:10] midst of that
[2:50:11] as it was shown to us lord uh even in
[2:50:13] the midst of
[2:50:14] a mistake it may look like a mistake you
[2:50:17] got something great happening and father
[2:50:18] even right now we know that
[2:50:20] a change of the body is taking place we
[2:50:22] know that what we've heard here
[2:50:24] today what we have received in our
[2:50:27] spirits god is doing something on the
[2:50:29] inside
[2:50:30] that satan cannot stop father we're
[2:50:33] grateful for that and we just pray that
[2:50:34] you just continue to strengthen the
[2:50:36] believers
[2:50:37] god give us travel and mercies as we
[2:50:39] prepare to leave this place but not your
[2:50:41] presence
[2:50:41] strengthen your your servant god uh
[2:50:44] brother kwaku lord and just thank you
[2:50:45] for him
[2:50:46] getting himself out of the way pressing
[2:50:48] through and bringing the word
[2:50:50] of god uh to us we appreciate it father
[2:50:52] today bless them abundantly

[2:51:44] and so there have been some discussions
[2:51:46] that because i think they can seat about
[2:51:47] 700 people at this hotel
[2:51:49] and um so there's been some discussions
[2:51:52] that maybe we will try to do something
[2:51:54] here in the future with a meeting
[2:51:56] and uh may uh just a couple churches
[2:52:00] here in the area may go together to try
[2:52:02] to
[2:52:02] split the expenses so it's not all in
[2:52:04] one church
[2:52:05] and we have a big meeting together uh
[2:52:08] and and
[2:52:09] i was you know one of the brothers was
[2:52:10] asked me yesterday brother with the with
[2:52:12] the
[2:52:12] conditions the way they is would it be
[2:52:15] wise
[2:52:16] for everybody to have a meeting would it
[2:52:18] be wise
[2:52:20] i said i'm gonna have to answer that
[2:52:21] from two ways i say spiritually i think
[2:52:23] it would be the best thing that ever
[2:52:24] happened to the people
[2:52:26] because the expectations are much higher
[2:52:29] when we haven't been able to come
[2:52:30] together like that
[2:52:32] so yeah spiritually i i've watched other
[2:52:34] people that have meetings this time and
[2:52:36] that powerful things are happening
[2:52:40] powerful things and so you know i feel
[2:52:42] like it's in
[2:52:43] atmospheres like that where the holy
[2:52:44] ghost people are filled with the holy
[2:52:46] ghost and
[2:52:47] delivered and set free not saying that
[2:52:49] they can get delivered and set free
[2:52:50] outside
[2:52:51] but the meeting brings a certain
[2:52:53] atmosphere
[2:52:55] right it's a different atmosphere and i
[2:52:57] say you know but i understand you know
[2:52:59] with with with what we've been dealing
[2:53:00] with
[2:53:01] all honesty i don't think covet gonna go
[2:53:04] away
[2:53:05] it's here it's here to stay and not only
[2:53:07] that i say you know brother branham told
[2:53:09] us that they're going to be using germ
[2:53:10] warfare
[2:53:11] it's going to be more coming right and
[2:53:14] uh
[2:53:14] and and i might the question that the
[2:53:16] lord just put in my heart
[2:53:17] amen early this morning if jesus christ
[2:53:21] himself was passion through your city
[2:53:24] and say he was having a meeting would
[2:53:27] you let kovat stop you from going
[2:53:29] to to see jesus right because you got
[2:53:32] you got a confidence
[2:53:34] that if you're in the presence of jesus
[2:53:36] he can change it
[2:53:39] right uh if brother branham was coming
[2:53:41] to your city
[2:53:42] and say i was preaching i'm going to
[2:53:44] preach at such and such place
[2:53:45] would you allow kobe to stop you from
[2:53:47] going to that meeting you would have a
[2:53:49] confidence that god hear this man prayer
[2:53:51] and he'll be able to whatever he pray i
[2:53:53] just believe that situation
[2:53:54] like he don't even know me he called my
[2:53:56] name i know this thing is over with
[2:53:59] right well you coming to the meeting if
[2:54:01] jesus was here
[2:54:03] if brother branham was here you're
[2:54:04] coming to the meeting with one thing
[2:54:07] faith and the same faith that you would
[2:54:09] use if
[2:54:10] jesus was here and the same faith you
[2:54:13] use if brother brown
[2:54:14] use that same faith now and you'll see
[2:54:17] god make a difference in your situation
[2:54:20] it's the same faith it's not a different
[2:54:22] faith
[2:54:23] so all we got to do is just approach it
[2:54:25] with faith
[2:54:26] not fear church amen i mean
[2:54:30] and don't don't get me wrong don't get
[2:54:31] me wrong i i i take it i take it
[2:54:33] seriously but
[2:54:35] death is something that will has come to
[2:54:37] us because of what happened in the
[2:54:39] garden of eden
[2:54:40] covet came because of what happened in
[2:54:42] the garden of eden
[2:54:43] car accidents happened because of what
[2:54:45] happened in the garden of eden cancer
[2:54:47] is here because of what happened in the
[2:54:49] garden of eden
[2:54:50] high blood pressure people die from it
[2:54:52] every day is here
[2:54:53] heart problems they die from it because
[2:54:55] of what happened in the garden
[2:54:57] but you know what i'ma still keep
[2:54:58] praising god no matter what takes me out
[2:55:00] of here i plan on praising him anyway
[2:55:03] he's still worthy so church i i'm i i
[2:55:05] just want us to get to the spot where
[2:55:07] yeah let's
[2:55:08] let's let's get our expectations up
[2:55:10] let's look for god to do something
[2:55:12] and uh and i i just believe we're gonna
[2:55:15] start with these these
[2:55:16] little fellowship meetings amongst the
[2:55:18] churches but yes it is a possibility
[2:55:20] that it may
[2:55:21] evolve to a meeting back in south
