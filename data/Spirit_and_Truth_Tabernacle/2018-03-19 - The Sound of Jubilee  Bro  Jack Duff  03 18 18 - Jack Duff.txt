extrinsic brother Quentin strength in the family to God as they just process through this time and we asked for complete and total healing of his body not just his body but also his soul we ask that you remove Lord by his spirit you keep giving him time chance after chance so God we pray did you would do something in his life that he would recognize who you are and how much you love him God the Father as we would just enter a man of remained of the service blessed Lord the rest of it father's our prayer would take every spirit that's against the Spirit of God beneath the control of the Holy Ghost it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you amen thank you musicians appreciate you amen on today if you all would get your Bibles while you're standing also I needed to mention to you this is one of the things I had put in my schedule just a few years ago was a man trying to spend some quality time with my wife and do a lot of ministry things but also want to include time for her and also time for my family and this is a week that I have set aside to spend some time with her so after service today amen we'll be heading out of town I'll be back a man on Thursday just to be ready for the funeral on Friday but brother Troy world a man be handling service on on Wednesday night and I'm grateful amen brother Troy I really really thank God for him and with him he'll in the service but we just need all the brothers a man that be in a place because he can't do it all right but as a deacon here in our church apt to teach he steps right in and and just steps up and does what he can and I'm grateful for Nana I'm grateful we've been praying that God sent help and God has raised enough to help right here and I miss a man so we thank God brother Troy thank God for other Jerry just this is some help you know and I certainly have been needing it so will you know will be a way Amen if you need to reach us certainly would be available by telephone but I will be away for a few days a man and just getting some rest and relaxation and there's uh I just thank God look like my ears starting to fill up some things have kind of hit my calendar but nonetheless we just want to serve God with everything we've got a man we have very little time so whatever we can do for the kingdom of God that is exactly amen what we want to do Amen so keep us in prayer as we as we go let's stop turn I'm gonna read just one portion scripture I have a lot a man in my spirit and just not 100% certain how the Lord want me to bring it all out but i'ma just be obedient a man and just start I'm gonna just open my mouth and just start sharing and I love will let the Holy Ghost take it from there a man but I want to I want to go to Matthew 24 a man I mentioned earlier to the Sunday School class that this is the week a man and I said today would have been the data brother branham would have preached certain messages but I am a day behind yesterday would have been the first day where the seals would have been preached back in 63 and he would open up with God hiding himself in simplicity revealed himself in the same and then it comes that night and preaches the breach and then today would have been the first seal a man that he would have preached and so I want to encourage you all this week would be a good week for you to listen to the seals say man just go back and listen to what the prophets said amen those were very special sermons that God saved for your time hey man you know those sermons couldn't even be there is many that tried to preach him with the light that they had but but the true like came in 1963 and we've been fellowship and underneath that a man you know all these years so so God sent that to you and sent it with seven angels signifying a man through a cloud that appeared in 1963 that God was trying to get a message to you a man glory to God a man and a no time to reject is this came supernaturally alright glory to God it lands it's so so important he put a cloud in the sky and y'all gonna give it to a plane not me not me well how did the plane make it look like the face of Christ hey man I mean that that's something I'm sorry just you know but I just I just believe his message and and I thank God for it but I encourage you this would be a good week for you too amen go back and listen to those sermons amen the seven seals praise Lord Matthew 24:24 is the one verse that I want to read and then we will we will go from there actually let's see let me let me skip the verse or go up to verse 22 if I can on that except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not this is low there's Christ lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's rule capitalized and plural false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very length a man less less will stop there you can have your seats pray the Lord will add a blessed blessing to the reading of his word we want to just take for a man a topic today the sound of Jubilee a man of Jubilee you know last actual King before it before I do that let me read a opening quote here out of the lands book of life a man y'all just bear with me here so just line that up for me Atlanta life the way we can see something here in the scripture hold on one second we can see something here in the scripture and I was trying to point this out last week you can pull that down for one second hold on one second the when I was I was bringing us to Rev Matthew 17 and in Matthew 17 Jesus made a promise here that they were accident so you know after they saw Moses and Elijah standing there at Mount Transfiguration they began disciples had a question now the thing of it is is they they they couldn't ask these questions had they not been studying Scripture oh my right they couldn't even have these questions Oh Lord cannot I mean if I could just be bold to say some of the stuff that people use in a man to try to pull away from the message you couldn't even discuss those things with the average churchgoer right the only reason you can't even have that have that position is because God sent a message right had there not been a message that will not even be a discussion or you can even use any of that right you know I mean you know so so so so when we when we when we look at some of these things you know like I was telling us you know the church on last night you know somebody that would say you know I looked it up on Google and I couldn't find where so many men fell off a bridge that was being built you know so if Google says that it wasn't a what that the men didn't fall off the bridge then then the men didn't fall into briefs now now for me I can't take it like that actually I don't have that much faith not in Google I don't have that much faith in Google right you know I mean I know Google is is designed amen to give you what somebody else has put in it right amen that's how that that's how the internet work that's how Wikipedia works somebody gotta put something on there and and you don't know who putting it on there you just taking it because they said I'm gonna take what the Bible said right but but but you know I just begin to you know just kind of process this myself when you talk about a bridge and so many men falling off and brother branham prophesied it and and since you can't find it on Google dinner didn't happens at midnight I'm sorry I I can't put that kind of faith in Google I said now if I'm building a bridge and I'm the owner of this of this company that's building this bridge you know and and on my watch so many men actually fallen and died do I want those people to put that in the newspaper that I own this company so many men died and in my company on this bridge I am NOT going to release that information if I do they're gonna shut my project down there's a lot of money that's going to be lost right yes and you know I mean that even even today people get bribes you know different things happen man you have somebody coming up to your house knocking on the dough to try to give you a little something to keep you quiet that's still have for the day right so I can I can imagine of course Google women habits somebody's trying to keep that quiet but a prophet a prophet has the ability so tell you things that happen when nobody else will attend it that happened in the scripture right when Elijah was telling the King avoid here weren't there because the king of Assyria is coming this way coming that way and the king of Syria saying I do I have a spy in my camp how come every time I go down there the Spanish knock that one is gone the spy revealed to me the spy so I can kill the spot they say King don't get too excited don't kill nobody nah don't do that they say because uh I'm just let you know together they got a prophet in the land and that prophet know the very things that you're talking about in your bedchamber that's that's what a prophet can do for you right so you know that you know and and and and I just you know I have to I gotta just kind of pause here you know because it just kind of hit me this week you know people first time hearing something about a prophet you know I mean you you you you you we say these things and and and I don't want to I'm certainly not here to try to fend anybody or anything like that but you know when I'm talking about a prophet I'm talking about something from scripture that God promised for this day I'm talking about Malachi chapter 4 before behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord I'm talking about revelation 10 and 7 I'm talking about the fulfillment of Revelation 3 and 14 I'm talking about statement 17 right I'm talking about scriptures like that that were promised to be fulfilled in our day that's why you got a search scripture I'm not I'm not making this up read it in your Bible God promised it and we got promises that now we just now we live under the manifestation of the promise but I know sometimes that might that might I have to think that if it was my first time walking into a church and I heard people saying the Prophet the Prophet I'm probably like what in the world are these people here talking about what is it that what you talked about come on now hold on I'm not I've been the church they nobody but I mean and now they just talk about Jesus I am I am I'm talking about Jesus but I'm talking about how he did things today glory to God I'm talking about Jesus but you got to have spiritual revelation the cat's when I'm saying right and I'ma tell you if you got spiritual revelation amen what one thing that I that I that I'm confident of is that you will catch it Laurie got when I first heard it I called it it might have took me a little time but I caught it but and once I caught it couldn't nobody take it from me praise the Lord it's gonna take a lot mode in the bridge to get me out of this I'm sorry if you gotta need some most stuff cuz that ain't gonna work and and like I told you what my brothers say well no John the Baptist feel restored all things no no no no I could I got two questions on that real quick I don't even have to think about it I need to have the prayer but I got two questions real quick what did he restore tell me what and if you ain't got no insurance to me in Scripture what he restored if you can't summon that you got it I'm sorry you can take it but I'm not gonna take it hallelujah glory to God and if jesus promised that he said John the Baptist he saying I see lies with has our lives will come and restore all things but I said to you Elias has already come and they did it to him what they what you know what was written so when Jesus said that I knew that one he was already saying John the Baptist what it was he lives that come to introduce the first coming of Christ but there was another spirit of Elijah coming and then before the second coming of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen and that's the duster that that that spear Elijah would be a prophet according to Malachi 4 it would be a prophet that we're coming this time to restore all things alright so you hear this word prophet and this is where I read Matthew 24:24 because soon as you you know it should you've been taught in church you've been taught we all have been taught be careful I'm gonna say that profit profit profit because the Bible tells us this the Bible tells us this let's look at it again in Matthew 24 a man you should be careful I want you to be careful don't just fall for anything a man stay with the word alright alright a man here in verse 23 Matthew 24 Jesus speaks this verse then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not right because this is this is one thing that people would go to them that this is what Jesus told me right st. st. say believe it not and then he says and 24s for there shall arise false Christ's now rouse that pluralized first of all we need to understand that Christ means Anointed once right I mean Christ means to be anointed right so false Christ will be first anointed ones multiple Amen not just one but multiple oh my god Atlanta there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets amen and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so when you hear somebody talking about the proper to talk about this you know the one thing that I've been able to base my my my my so long his scripture tells me that if it were possible it would receive the very late Amen so so what I'm saying is that if I'm elected I cannot be deceit jesus said that some kind of way he will bring my attention to truth where I will not be deceived hallelujah I can rest on that so when I heard this for the first time amen I knew like it rest my soul then I will not be the seat hey man I can dig in there a little people I can listen to the tapes I can read the books because I know that Jesus said I will not be to see hallelujah and I know but from the years that I first got a hold on it - right now I can say I have not been to see a man that what else am I gonna fellowship around like Peter say to whom shall we go only you have the words of eternal life you gonna take me from this way you taking me to just sit home and do what then I'll take this any day I'll take this alright stay with me I'm trying to get over here to the sound of Jubilee glory to God but you know and anyone would look at this a man that jesus said that they arise false Christ's and false prophets but you understand amen and in order to have something false you actually have to have at least one thing that's true to compare it against yeah you can't compare it against you can't compare to false days but you have to have at least one true thing before you can have a fake dollar bogus dollar you have to have at least one real dollar come on somebody commitment so so oftentimes people get a little too quick amen to jump up and say Jesus saying watch out for the false Christ and fresh muffins yes he did say that but that same jesus also spoken matthew 17 that he lied to what we're coming would come and restore all things so you gotta find daddy logic watch out for the false but find the truth you ain't got nothing to leave nobody to virtue zip it up just zip it up hold on - we're listening to it I'm sorry Church hey man I hate to be so bold right but if you have you study life with Jesus eventually he got real bow with people hey Manny had to get that way with the Sadducees and Pharisees and Sadducees that he had to get them and we got to be the same way we got to know what we stand alone glory to God amen amen amen all right so let me let me now try to read this out of Lamb's Book of Life watch watch watch watch the true find the truth don't don't get jobs on the front but find the one truth look at this the Bible said in the revelation that the Antichrist would come in the last day and that he would be so rude over in st. Matthew also the 24th chapter Jesus speaking saying when the Antichrist would come then he'd be so close like the real got until he would deceive the very elect if possible watch deceive the very elect the lick where does it come from from the word elected he would deceive the very elect it if it was possible see but it isn't Amen praise God for that it is impossible I like that and I'm playing I'm placing myself in that scripture I'm one of the elected so it is impossible for me to be deceived even though I've never heard nothing about a prophet and all I mean I grew up in church grew up in the Baptist Church I never heard nothing about these things but when I heard it it struck something on the inside wait a minute Amen is my light had never shined on that part of the Bible before and when I started looking at I said now and this is the thing search the scripture right don't search google search the scriptures not your encyclopedias don't try to get this person opinion in that person's opinion search the Scriptures the disciples understood scripture that's why they can see now did the business cross a difference in the the leaders say that it would be this way in that way they understood scripture see if you if you not reading your Bible but it's always go right on top of your head man church if we all stay with the scripture we don't be we're gonna miss this but it's so important search scriptures read your Bible reads I mean people say well I'm going back and read my Bible I've been reading my Bible that that's why I'm not deceived by this I've always been reading my Bible that's why I believe it because I see it in the Bible come on I'm going I'm going further you can't be deceived you cannot know I don't care what happened you will not be deceive you are elected look at this like over in Hebrews the sixth chapter step four it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have been partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the heavenly gifts and the power of the world to come if they would turn and renew themselves unto repentance it's impossible can't be done that's right a man and and you know we just whipped a little bit of that on Wednesday night but and brother Branham saying you know it's impossible for you know a person s that's truly Amen the Bride of Christ I mean a part of God it's impossible for them to be lost right if you truly part of God I don't care what goes on your life now now you gonna have to pay for your sin you're gonna pay for your sin I've you know because whatever man so he got to reap that's why you got to watch what Steve's you sow right because whatever you saw you're gonna reap it now and understand in the end and the laws of Sorna reaping you don't reap it overnight you saw it now but years down the later years down the line here that thing come back and you wonder where it came from it was that seed that's you so it just came to harvest praise the Lord so so good seats and I am so good seats praise the Lord amen sometimes you know I will tell you you young young people something you soak this season on because later on you might reap it in your children and you'd be wondering where this come from no remember that seed you sow it came up in your child oh my all right you start going through some stuff alright praise the Lord amen it's just these that we saw they got to come forth and it just keep us on our knees in prayer that's all they remember God is a good guy he brings us through it all a man so so let me let me let me just try to make my way into a couple of things here we want to talk about this sound of Jubilee now it's hard for people to be able to receive I remember I was talking to a brother you know here a few years ago and I was talking about a proud he's like God don't use prophets no moment say wait a minute wait a minute man that's not in the Bible say he said we yeah God only use prophets when we start trying to give him something now now I say the Bible promised it and so God still use prophecy he still he used prophets evangelists pastors teachers you know he does that that's what God does you know so you know we kind of work through some things and went back to the scripture but you know I could just kind of imagine even over with Moses right when it's time for God to call Moses bring him out on the scene there in the book of Exodus Moses begin the kind of question that I was like god it's going to be hard for them people to receive me it's going to be hard for them to you know for me to just kind of go down there and say you know the Lord sent me I'm gonna be your deliverer you know and I'm again I'm gonna bring you out from underneath the bondage of the Egyptians and you know it's gonna be hard for them just to receive me like that so what God had to do is give Moses two sides right and the signs not only vindicated that Moses was God's chosen man right but it also helped Moses to get rid of someone in fear that he had inside of myself right some of the doubt that he might have had about himself being able to do the soul so one of the things that God told Moses to do us is take a rock a man and throw it down say take your Rob that you use them to watch over the she quit take that and throw it down and say when Moses threw it down that rod became a stake and and now the Bible said Moses begin the run he had fear inside of them he's not running from that state but God said I'm gonna take that fear out of here Moses I want you to reach your hand down take it by the tail and watch what happened now can you imagine if a man running from the stake and that God telling him to pick the snake up by the tail Oh what that must that must have been some challenges it could have been hours went by before Moses did anything with that snake I'm just I know if it was me and God would have told me to do something like that I would have been questioned is this really the voice of God this is a devil talking to me do you I mean I can I can see Moses going for the state and maybe a snake turn on them real quick Oh God it took something for that man to die to himself to follow God and we're gonna have to die to our selves to follow this message you reached finally finally get a hold of it picks it up and it turns back into a stick most like why I never seen nothing like this never done nothing like this so here you know and I got oh Lord oh god I'm just oh Jesus help me God I got some things but God had to do Moses like that God got had to have Moses go through this experience because he knew what was coming right there that you know he and it's the second thing that he gave Moses saying I'll take your hand and put it down inside your bosom and it takes it and puts it down and his bullying me close it up in his hand and immediately turn white like leprosy right and and then say that now can you imagine the man look at his hair like what what is down there that would cause my hand to look like that right what does he do right so God God begin the show slit and I take your hand and put it back down and out maybe again fear grips enough last time I put my him in there it came it came I'm looking white right now I don't know what's gonna happen this stuff but it took place put his hand back down inside of there pull it back up and this time it was it was it was just as normal as it ever could be that Shonda I'm healing to Moses showing the power to bind and loose to Moses all these things were very important to me he had no clue but but he was struggling with himself that the people won't believe me that when he gets down there to to Egypt a man and he goes with his stick and he said not you know God God has proven that he's with me I know he's with me and I got confidence that I'm gonna be able to lead these people out so you know maybe he goes down there and he goes in front of pharaoh's court and you say thus saith the Lord the Lord has told me to tell you Pharaoh let my people go in Paris a well who is the Lord you find out who he is you say say say say let my people go in and Moses immediately took his watch and just threw it down on that Pharaohs feet and here the thing turned into a snake and Tara looks at it they say old cheap magician's trick now you wonder what kind of stuff where they practice it in closed doors behind closed doors that he would say it's a cheap magician's trick because most most everybody else that that saw something like that's a my god what is this but God knew what was happening down in Egypt and he prepared Moses accordingly throw it down Moses and don't you fear when you see something that's you ain't expecting can I say that again don't you fear when you see something that you're not expecting don't panic don't panic what when you see something that you're not expecting will you see your family doing things that they wasn't expected to do when you see them turn from the word don't you panic keep claiming your promise hey hallelujah what is your promise I will restore save the Lord's a man that belongs to me and both of my face it's greater than any fact the factsheet of their backslidden but my faith says they'll be restored the facts say that they don't believe but my face says that they will believe again my face says they will hear the sound of Jubilee and when they finally hear the sound that you believe whether we go dance we will shout we go say we don't race car cane Oh Devon stop it just ain't gotta be greater than your backs my brother Troy picked up on brother brother Jerry stop me save me say fat Dee's my knife is sitting there on the dresser that's what the facts say my knife is on the dresser but faith will pull it out the drop stop put it in my pocket my faith is greater than my facts Moses just Rob down until snaking Pharaoh says chief magician trick man there's nothing to this it's a jamison Jambres show this fellow what you get and they just walked up Danny I need I need other kits this because Janice in gem breeze was given a platform to demonstrate what they have keyword given a platform I got a quote for you a little bit they were given a platform to demonstrate what they have showed us meant what you got Jamison Jambres throw a rise down snakes becomes things and Farrell product that moves like well what you got now I told you the cheat magician trick my magicians been doing that for a while what you got mo just said de you didn't say nothing didn't do nothing but all of a sudden his snake rose up swallowed the first thing second stick sitting there not maybe that's Nick didn't know what was going on got the other snake swallowed him - snake swallowed by one snake and when they finish and they finished following the snakes then see Moses had to go through that experience he knew not to be afraid of the snake because he had he had the power of the snake right but he waited to to Pharaoh snakes got eaten up Janus and Jabbar sticks that eaten up and then he reached down and picked up his thing and turned it back into steam I don't know if Janice and Jen breeze could turn their back to sticks they can make up stinks but could they make it back of steam see Moses had the power to bind em loose oh and I want to tell you the pride has that same power to bind and loose so Moses Moses Moses takes it in heat and he puts it out now where you fix that and you put some mow down there where eat them up - a little bit but what we got were what we call kernel impersonations and brother branham hat you know multiple signs that God gave him as well you know in his ministry and you know and and and one of them praying for the sick God would allow him to touch their hands a man whose first pull and then he'd be able to count of tail just by touching person hands with different vibrations that would happen on his hand he'd be able to tell what condition the other person had then that second pull God gave him the ability to notice secrets of the people's hearts right that was a second pool so without touching you I could tell you exactly you know what's going on with you because God shows it to me in a vision and then that third pool was the revealing of the word now many people were very very excited with the first pool - praying for the sick in the second pool a man knowing the secrets of the heart but many of them dropped off when it came to the third pool the opening of the word hallelujah I'm still here by the grace of God and I am Fellowship and underneath this open worked I want to read something play this is out of Revelation chapter 5 part 2 remember Janice and Jambres was given the platform to impersonate they were given a platform look at this in Revelation chapter 5 and and brother Branham certainly was one that was warmed by the angel they said it's gonna be many if you try to explain these things there's gonna be minute it's gonna impersonate what you're doing and that happened right when he tried to explain it he says then we got kernel impersonations of it oh my it's just pitiful he says look I want to how many Pentecostals in here raise up your hand all right look you Pentecostals a few years ago God really fell upon you and you began to speak with tongues that's right but what did devil do he come around and give a car no impersonation of that he made out of he made out something that wasn't right got the people down and speaking in tongues and making them say certain words and things to make them speak in tongues that's what you know this is 1961 now we know that number the truth they beat you on the back said Jesus Jesus say it say it say it real fast that real fast I ain't speaking in tongues that's not what happened then on the day of Pentecost right but I mean it come on come on six exits exit you know if God give you the gift of tongues to give it a gift of tongues with that nobody beaten you amen but but he said let me say say making them certain making them say certain words and things to make them speak in tongues and so forth a man living with another man's wife and all kind of things in all kinds and some of them drinking smoking and everything still speaking with tongues what did he do that for to make the real trumpet give an uncertain sound to the people then who can prepare himself for battle see then when this come up now we got people out in the audience there's one right went right before me up there in Canada even now while the agents picked him up as a homosexual see saying oh my God give me the gift of discernment say hallelujah set now the Lord told me that somebody in here is named John of course if you got a thousand people there you got somebody in there named John yes of course these are impersonations now watch this one we had a little woman here one morning come back there you remember come back there and she said the Lord give me the same gift and I said well she said I wish I had a chance to prove it look at this I said there's the platform Janice and Janice was given a platform this lady came to the tabernacle where brother Branham preaches completely gets women preachers now she didn't preach but she was given the platform amen in order to exercise this gift that she said God gave her Janice and Jefferies now I'm gonna tell you something it take a prophet to do something like that it take a proper because if I knew somebody's coming here like that I would have ah no no no no no no we can't do it like that hallelujah right but I'm gonna tell you something let me just but you can leave this there leave it there for a second I'm a taster sometimes things happen and you wasn't expecting it one time we was in church and we had somebody come and you know praise the Lord it was good to have them there but man as soon as I finished preaching that lady grabbed her Bible ran up to the front so fast and start the Lord gave me a word the Lord said I said what and there's nothing you can do but then I did I forget what I said to the people but you know but I just kind of huh yeah I say remember brother branham talked about the lady putting up with rockets and and when she pulled up her stockings you know she was getting ready to give a word to so you know to the church and brother branham told her ladies sit down now now the first time he did it she didn't get so sit down the second time she did it she did not get told sit down but the third time it was sit down yes I'm talking to you sit down so when that happened it was the first time we give her grace so sometimes people be given the platform to the counter say certain things but you see God is not in that and when you have been rooted and grounded in the word then nothing shakes you let me go on and read this this lady was given the platform and all that was was a Jenison jamberry spirit they had brother Branham allowed to go forth because you had to be able to see the difference you say you got something okay there's a platform let's see what you got and say you've seen what happened pure man psychology see but when you see sister Snider come one come on up and tour it now I'm just looking at this quote y'all I'm just I'm just can y'all see this this lady is in the tabernacle saying she got the same gift at the Prophet Han and brother Branham gives her the platform the counter go ahead let's see what you got and not only does he give it a platform but the Saints the Saints are coming through the prayer line now that now we the counter people that if we see something like that come on y'all y'all and go preach with me y'all ain't preaching with me y'all y'all y'all looking at me real funny y'all they reach in with me if y'all saw something like that what one of premises that we've got to be much sure that we saw we've been approached you gotta be like that Church right sometimes you find yourself in situations don't panic don't panic yeah it's okay it's gonna work out just fine maybe God want to use that to get that person attention right but if we all go to act before Lord we had that happen one time and I appreciate the church I didn't you know these things are not in my notes I'm trying to get to other things but we had that happen but we got blasted bus did we were told the Holy Ghost is not here in West Palm Beach the Holy Ghost ain't here that's what we was told and then after after date we got busted and and then they they call for a circle Saints I mean they Saints to come up to pray at the altar and they got them all on the floor Dupree and I saw st. get out their chairs and come join the circle I say praise the Lord for a mature group of beef thank the Lord for that rather than just sit around just look at the people no because they because I'm gonna be like but the mature Saints came right in and just join right in with him and praise the Lord you know amen sometimes things happen Church and if you're not matured then you you know you you respond the wrong way hallelujah hallelujah all right let me let me let me go on with this since this is neither coming up and told her and told her she had arthritis that finished it the first person on the platform she saw the lady walking with a cane and said you got arthritis what's this plan then I said that isn't what's wrong with the woman that's that she fell and broke her hip that's why she got the king she got on the ride and she fell and broke her hip that's not why she here right and it says and I said she's not even standing there of course there's a sign that didn't hear too well and she said and what she said what she had I believe was a growth in a stomach of something other own like that I said that's what it is sitting here talking to the Brethren about it the whole time see but just to show that the church see that is carnal comparison you see and what does that it makes the real trumpet hallelujah so you're gonna have you got to beware of false Christ's false ignoring it was you certainly have to beware of be aware of that but you also want to look for the real and the true and understand that God has promised you that you would not be deceived because you are very elected Oh glory to God let me read another something out of the gifts and callings are without repentance Moses was given those two signs a man the Prophet was given three pools but this was in order to prove to the people that God was sending a man Moses or God was sending his prophet God gave these these very specific things for them to do and God used that for his glory let me read here out of Gibson Collins on without repentance now watch this here's what happened when the time I met him when he appeared as a man I was sitting in my study now he's talked about meeting Christ says he came I seen the light spread out on the floor now I'm getting ready to say something here oh yes Sunday School class y'all stay with me on this one this is for y'all all right Amen I've seen the light spread out on the floor he came walking to me he looked like a man that weighed 200 pounds and this light was just above me and he had his arms full actually I'm not this is not Christ this is the angel this is the angel right and this light was just above me and he had his arms folded he had a look as you don't see on the face of mortals he looked very calm and quiet very loving his voice when he spoke I knew it was the same voice that had spoke all down through life's journey but I've never seen its face he was dark complexion more like the Spanish the Jewish people he had his arms folded and he looked away 200 pounds in stature and height and had hair to his shoulders and a smooth face yet when he had walked it seemed like that there was a power and he'd do anything and I was sitting there and I was so scared that I was biting my fingers just imagine standing face to face with something like that I was biting my fingers then I went he said don't fear when that voice spoke I knew it was the same one he looked at me his eyes looked upon me kindly not to look sympathizing with this angel but-but-but-but born a peculiar birth and and your peculiar life has been to indicate that you're to take the gift of divine healing to the people of the world I said sir I'm uneducated I couldn't go he said I'll let I'll get them to believe you I said if you'll get them to believe you and if you're sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer if you'll get them to believe you and I said I bet they wouldn't believe me sir he said you'll be given to science as the prophet Moses was given to science to get the people to believe you is the real is really the issue he said one of them was detective diseases just by holding the person's right hand on your left and said then if you'll be sincere it shall come to pass that you'll tell the very secrets of their hearts and the things that they are doing wrong to build a faith in the people to be to be to be in faith and to vindicate you that that I God will send it to you now here for the branham's told by an angel a man that he would get the same thing that Moses had Moses had two signs now he's giving two signs and as he goes for four he's just all they gotta do is just get the people to believe and if he just get the people leave say not even cancer was tending the way of his prayer not even cancer so so you know here here the thing you know here he's giving us a description of the angel now you know I know there's many people that say they've seen angels and things of that nature you know all that all that's fine but but what I'm what I'm trying to say is that this don't happen every day to people right this don't happen every day and when I heard these things for the first time like Lord this is something unique this is a very special ministry that you're sending to the earth and and in the world like I said I rest my soul on God's promise that they bury let can't be the seed so let's start digging deeper like wait a minute now wait a minute that that day I mean look at the supernatural God the same God that I'm read about in the Bible I'm seeing this manifested in this ministry and I'm just I'm just all I can say is that as I'm still is manifested I am hearing the sound of Jubilee Oh glory as I'm seeing these things ain't nan uh-uh-uh-uh and I'm reading about it I'm hearing about I'm hearing different testimonies I'm here in the sound of Jubilee Oh glory to God you know there was a testimony that happen and one of the meetings brother Branham went to and I just heard this recently he went to Mexico and that dead baby had come back to life the mother had the baby for 12 hours in her arms dead and she took the baby to the meet and fighting through to Russia's just to get to the platform and God showed the Prophet a vision that the bed who was smiling and he prayed for the baby the baby came back to life 12 hours dead 12 hours right and when that baby come back to life man it just erupted just uh you know a revival struck that place it was so powerful they that the man there was a general that was found recent as general was responsible help for helping these meetings actually happen they're there in Mexico and when they found the genophage they say just give us some of the testament say man this person got here that person got here this happened a half said there was some of the most powerful meetings there once said now the real special thing that happened is that brother Branham had already left the area I already went to another Stevie savor the people had no idea that the meetings were over so they was still coming to the meetings the meetings were over and they're still coming he said now you know but but but the remarkable remarkable part is that when they got there they were still being healed meanings were over pop it not even there but the angel of the Lord was still there and the people were still being healed now that that just ain't happening everywhere I was just thinking on this III hit this and this is why Oh Lord just bear with me sixth seal sixth seal don't panic I know if you know something you hear these things and like I said you don't hear this everywhere you go praise God I understand that but God tried something that is trying to get something to his people that's what he's trying to do but look I heard this in sixth seal recently and he said this notice but you see the sheet call my sheep hear my voice why what is a voice I want to tell you what a voice is a voice is a spiritual sign a voice is a spiritual sign so when we saw these things happen in the prophets ministry that was the voice of God a spiritual sign that was given to the people and Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they won't follow oh my listen to this it might be a strange doctrine people ain't never heard of it but a stranger we won't follow we're not following that we follow them the voice a man and the voice is the voice of God that's in his prophet right he says what is a voice I want to tell you what a voice is a voice as a spiritual sign he said to Moses if they won't hear the voice of the first time they will hear the voice of the second sign my sheep hear my voice when these things are supposed to be taking place in the last days sheep of God recognize that see they recognize it my sheep know me see strangers they won't follow they won't follow them strangers it's got to be a vindicated sign for the day and they see it see we got we got have been Decatur son and and I just I've just got a question you know we know Moses was vindicated he threw that rock down God vindicated him but when they called for flies and lice and locusts and everything and you know water turn the blood God vindicated a man Moses God did it multiple times the people knew that God was with Moses right and there were many things that happen in the prophets message and my question is how many times do we need in order to hear the voice how many times as I got him he said to a little fishy I'll give you a life that was a sign it has seven aims just come from eternity and commissioned him to go back east and preach the seven seals and and that's what I'm talking about this week is a week that those seals were preached in 1963 seven angels supernaturally come from heaven making the face of Jesus Christ and sends him back that was a sign in the sky how many signs we need before we hear the voice a man when he told a man had it right her boys gave him spoken word salvation whatever had it right one and she could have and he gave us word salvation how many songs we needed to have before we hear the voice well he uh and when the pillar of fire that took a picture with him in Houston glory to God how many signs we needed before we hear the voice a man the light shining in the room at his birth the church age is being drawn on the back wall of the church right the first floor the second floor the third floor he was vindicated I meant I mean multiple times how many signs we need before we hear the voice I want you to remember the very let cannot be the seat I don't care who you are if you are elected of God you won't be the seat can I've read this this quote out of questions and answers on the stairs you're gonna hear the sound of Jubilee because that's what I heard the sound of Jubilee let listen this this is a questions and answers out of seals listen there's a question this is brother Branham is it true that every every Jew born since Christ King will be safe and who are the 144,000 are they to protest that it wants to be sealed with the Holy Ghost and what is their mission you said there's about three questions in the one there but in see here the first one is is it true that every Jew born since Christ that coming to the world is to be saved no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names Oh glory to God not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you understand that now see he goes on say the book though say now lavell is to be saved in the time of this church age that's not what the book Stan or almond devil or whoever knowing don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it and that's what I said the other night you know this is when we talk about John seeing his name right over in Revelation 5 John John John begin to begin the week jumping in the wash jumping in the clock when he saw his name he saw his name in the book hallelujah take that down for just for a second let me just kind of hit this but in Revelation 5 John's father's book that no man could look upon a man nobody could reveal or what was in this book right amen in somebody when they look at saying he said not nobody can get that book than old man comments finish he began to look at I don't know what he said he say look over here and abraham couldn't get the book here and looked over there and David and Joseph none of them could take the book he said who can take this book who could get this and loose the seals and he said all of a sudden the elder said John weak not because the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to take the get loose the seals thereof when John's attorney looked and he saw this bleeding bloody lamb they said lion but he saw a limb it was Christ that he was looking at he as he had been slain before the foundation of the world and when John John finally looked and saw that Christ had redeemed mankind this book of redemption that was in and nobody else could take it it was in the hands of God only one could take it was Christ and when Christ got it John's final looked at him saw his name is in the Bible say all heaven heard John worship oh hell everything on the earth everything above the earth everything underneath the earth heard John worshiping oh my god what was that - John that was a release that was a jubilee o glory church when you've been in bondage event denominational bondage for years once you hear Jubilee trumpet a man things are not the same for you anymore how are you somebody see a man only to madness and bondage can't appreciate that you believe trumpet only the man has been locked in Catholicism only the woman has been locked in the Baptist traditions only the one has been down the pinnacle teachings they can understand when the Jubilee trumpet sounds if your Papa mama things of all you understand when the Jubilee trumpet sounds and both over in this message win for us when the revealing of the real good for sound oh and I'm not going back here back to what I know upon the chance I can appreciate my dream that was a release for summer it was a relief to John a jubilee trumpet sound for him they hold the Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed brother Branham said when John saw his name that's why I said no it wasn't that he saw John the Revelator that was that's not seeing your name but when the revelation begins to unfold that was seeing your name and I'm preaching to a group of people that see their name that's why they can't be persuaded that's why they can't be pulled out they can't be convinced that this is wrong these are people that have heard that sound of Jubilee [Applause] hey please gods that's why we rejoice me I heard the same sound and out from the Baptist octane I stopped holding my ear amen and trying to get a further sing my sermon just pitch today the people respond to that I'll pin the pin across as I can I'll pin the Catholics like hey open the Lutheran she came up in the Methodist she came because she heard the sound Oh to believe as soon as they began to break this word to you soon as they begin I mean you've never heard anything like it before in your life but soon they begin to break these things in there wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that was the sound of Jubilee and let me tell you my sheep know my voice stranger they won't follow because the Sheep know the voice of Jesus and if you want to find the voice of Jesus you have to go back to his word Oh glory oh my say that the book don't say the book don't say now leave a let's be saved and the time of this church a Thormann devil or whoever no wait don't say that it just shows the mystery the book that shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by hey you know what when you believe with some things by faith you can't even explain it you can't don't even try haha Abraham don't explain how you gonna have a baby man you first of all you - oh yeah I mean you tried up your life dried up how you gonna have a baby man you you can't explain that but faith goes beyond facts all I know is that the mystery unfolded to me and she notice it one it's when John saw his name not they named it when the whole group of people seeing their name it was when John saw his name it provoked the response I returned in the same thing when Peter taught the revelation of who Christ was it provoked a response it's an individual walk hallelujah she got lived by my revelation I walk I respond by my revelation I act by my revelation hey man I can't see whatever everybody else see I see what's in scripture and I and I'm going back to swear if you can't prove to me out the word just don't even come don't come fillers and emotions not gonna do it for me I need to see scripture let's talk the Bible that's what you say let's let's talk the Bible praise God all right all right let me let me go on to someone to say it well there's no need of me trying now this is for one of my brothers here this quote is for you

with your faith you're not sure what you're doing you want to be sure but I don't care how long you been here in the church if it's gonna be one it's gonna be me oh my god all right Church I tell you what when I when I heard a man this Jubilee you got at the Jubilee a man and I don't have time to read all this but over in Leviticus 25 you'll find that let me just drop a couple of things off and I'll slip out of here but when they had a Jubilee a man in in Scripture it was a national festival for Israel that was held on the fiftieth year it was a year of release all debts were canceled and every prisoner and slave was liberated a man and we're declaring a man a year Jubilee a sound a jubilee for every one that hears this says all the lands in the whether they had been sold or mortgage they were restored to the original possessors or the original owner you find that Leviticus 25 amen this was a joyful event that was proclaimed by the sound of a trumpet amen that's how they knew when the jubilee had begun because they heard the priests sound the trumpet right and and he was found that trumpet and anytime that trumpet sound it was bringing good news hallelujah the person that was in bondage knew they'd have to be in bondage anymore they didn't owe their slave master anything if they were working on a project out there maybe working in the field as soon as they heard the sound of the of the doobly trumpet they dropped the rate they dropped the hole they drop everything I'm out of here going back to my original possession didn't even have to buy what was theirs originally it came back to them just because of the jubilee hallelujah God God instituted that a man in Israel and you know sir it was it was a very special moment a very happy day amen when people heard the jubilee and I'ma tell you when I heard this message that was my Jubilee that was good news that was that was the gospel that was the good news of the gospel being presented to me and that was the sound that you believe I didn't know my denomination nothing and if some of y'all came out of the world you didn't know the devil nothing just walk out of it leave it this is your Mester deal wit la lluvia a man if there if the land need to be plowed you better start plowing because I'm out of here praise God but you know what what happened there in in Israel is and you know when you can talk like that to your boss and not worry about him hitting you or nothing I'm going see you you can't do that man I'm not talk about praise the Lord you know anytime I people do the happy dance and all that no no no you stay right there you need that money man what we got but uh but but but that's spiritually a man this Jubilee was something that people looked look forward to and we've a member held captive and denomination systems for years we were waiting for the sound of it you believe that's what we heard and I'm gonna tell you again if you've never been in bondage you don't you don't know what it's like to be free so I'm going to tell you something I'm gonna just be i'ma just be honest with you I think God is allowing to kind of go through some things cuz someone would get what Egypt was like and some of them they was born in the wilderness they didn't even know what Egypt was like so when you go back to Egypt you're gonna find out what it's like and let me tell you something Egypt is worse now than it has ever been you will find out quickly so where it might have took us years to understand how wicked Egypt was it took us years to get I mean that stuff to get in our spirit and like I can't take no more this how you gonna be president of the doorknob club and you know I mean they got committees for everything and they and they gonna committee you right on out of it huh right but a lot of nonsense that happened in church politics all over the place and it when the Spirit of God moving there and I mean it was just it was just really really bad right well it might have took us years to get fed up before we were looking for something else and then we were ready for this message we were so fed up we were ready for the message some of y'all go back a man think about where you was at that time you were ready for something fresh and as soon as you heard it all glory that's what I've been looking for so some of them may never tasted it like that but I want to encourage you get as much as you can you'll get so fed up and so fast you'll keep running you come running back man watching you know this this service the man this man they were just out preaching preaching great preaching pretty good like what I'm doing right now I'm freaking pretty good but in this church when the pastor get to preaching real good you know the people do they come from the back all over and they just take money and lay it down at the altar and it just people come from everywhere just throw a - a WoW they took the offering but now they're bringing money and you know don't do the spirits show a lot of stuff come from club atmospheres let me just put it that way i'ma just I'm gonna just be honest with you it's a club atmosphere not and I hope you can read between the lines but that's that's in the church that's in the church all in Jesus name and they come land this money town just you know he just and you know who want to get a life to Christ come on up here and shake my hand that ain't giving a life to Christ just because you shake my hand you still go to hell shake it my hand but you know you look at all this non-system and this happened anything right here my city these people do that they I don't heard people say nothing get in the pulpit and say nothing souls that stake have nothing same big old Bible ain't nothing that they can get get there at their I'm gonna just sit there is no inspiration outside of this message there is no inspiration none they can't even find the sermon this man just preaching and you know he going on they just laying the money I said Lord look at this look at this and it's just a it's a club atmosphere that's coming to the church you got women on poles and all this other kind of stuff laying money down that's that's where that's what they brought into the church and we just be sitting there different laughing and giggling and they did the same thing that I saw one on YouTube ladies shouting and in the church and some man walk up and just laid money down a hefty because it she had a shout it's sin and its sin in the church Laurie got it show you where the people be going after they leave church or whether it was coming from before they came to church it's just a routine for them it don't mean nothing glory to God but God looking for some people that's gonna worship in spirit and in truth that other stuff date that you know that's nonsense praise God and say I'm gonna tell you I'm glad night all you gotta you won't even if you want to you think they got something you going there and they got me looking at you to bring some money and we ain't bringing the money you didn't get nothing yeah I'm getting something but uh-huh not but what they ain't the way I was taught with what was you talk if you don't believe it no more right what was you talked your actions show that you still believe what you were taught see if you're part of God you can't get away and if you elect you can't be deceived so forget about these web sites and stuff that's just nonsense this waste of time all right let me try to go on here the joyful event was proclaimed a win that when the priest would go through and sound the trumpet and the trumpet brought good news right and when we heard the gospel preached and the fullness of the revelation that God wanted us to hear it in that was the good news that we heard that's what released us gave us amen of freedom to leave wherever we were a man we come to this truth the other thing about it do believe is that they had a seven year Sabbath there in Leviticus 25 they had every seven years the land would go through Sabbath and then every they were just seven times seven years the 49th year going into the fifty year that would be a year of Jubilee but they had the seven years of Sabbath and I went when they hit a seventy year Sabbath they could not sow or reap I want you to catch that you could have so or reap in the seventh year you couldn't sow or reap so if you can't so how you're gonna get your food and if the land was already produced in you know something that you stole the year before but but if it grew in that seventh year you couldn't reap it you had to leave it there well how are you gonna get your food anybody got that question if you can't so I had that question you can't sow or reap in the seventh year where how are you gonna eat for that seventh year let's go to Leviticus 25 Leviticus 25 and I'm gonna start at verse 17 you can go back and read all of this thing that where you get an opportunity but it says here the ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear that God for I am the Lord your God wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell my land and safety now hear the thing of this when God established this law don't sow or reap a man in that seventh year establish law if you would do what God say it do then he would bless you and let me tell you that's not just for the Jubilee and not not often establish but even in your everyday life if you will follow the Word of God if you will obey God's Word God will bless you God will do more than you can even imagine but just follow his words glory to God amen he says he says verse 18 wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell my land and safety and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your field and dwell therein and safety and if you shall sing what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase so what we gonna do in the seventh year verse 21 says then I will come man my blessing upon you and the sixth year now if you follow the Word of God if you're going to be obedient to the Word of God if you go to brick top first then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years that's not that's not that's not just a double portion that's a true proportion if you'll follow God's Word and put him first we'll give you a trip portion I love that I will command my blessing upon you in the six year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat of the old fruit until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store that's some serious provision but these are things that happened during Jubilee serious provision I mean it was just a year just I mean no working can you understand that I don't have to plow I don't have to do nothing I mean just I'm just gonna enjoy the fruits of my labor everybody got a year off what would you do in your year if you have to worry about foods what would you do but just think about it Church I mean this this is how God provides for his people right you just worry about getting two weeks or three weeks of vacation no got a whole year your lights pain yeah all your bills caught up the whole year is off and not only that when you go back to work in the eighth year you still eaten from what you got in the sixtieth you top our savings and this is a savings plan right here but these are things that happen in the Jubilee glory to God Church I tell you what I am I'm grateful y'all y'all bear with me I read one more code imma imma get out I just I just wanted to bring this this is out of the breech a man between the seven churches and seven seals but Lord Lord knows this is that this is a precious time a man and I know for myself I entered this Jubilee I heard the sound of and I've been enjoying the fruits of it amen ever since I come to this work praise God amen I try I ain't tried all but I tried enough to know that this isn't and like I said before I said again if this ain't that let me keep this until that comes a man because most people that's telling you you know that this thing that they ain't got nowhere to go and most of them are saying they where I'm just what you've doing what I'm just I'm just what okay I got I don't want that I'll take what I got here amen look at this this is the breach and and what happened here in this particular message brother Branham was bringing in revelation 5 I was you know as I was battling with where to go with this sermon a man on today I just kind of quickened to me that this was the week that he would haven't reached the turkey I mean seals which last night 63 years ago he would have preached the breach right so here we are coming in this morning you know with this and I want you to notice he's talking about John you know seeing that book of redemption and when he when he saw his name you know on that book Redemption when nobody was able to take that book in Revelation 5 but he saw the lion or the lamb you know pepper but the lion had prevailed but when he turned and saw a lot I mean saw lamb he knew that it was Christ that took that book a man and he's loose the seals thereof glory God we have been redeemed by the blood man look at this the breeches says listen what a Jubilee going on when they seem that lamb come and take that book of redemption the soul screamed out we'll get it all everything that elders fell down they poured out the prayers of the Saints what there was a representative kinsman for us they fell upon their faces and they sang a song said thou art worried that for you were slaying watch that and look at these angels and I've been held and heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand thousand whoo notice staying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and glow on err and glory and blessing what did you believe going on in heaven amen when the lamb leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claim you know that got next to John he must have saw his name broke there when them seals broke he must have got real happy listen what he said in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and underneath the earth such as are in the sea and all that in them is in them hurt me sick I think blessings honor glory power be to him that sits upon the throne into the land for ever amen and amen and amen Oh a four beasts that a man when the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that lives for ever and ever talk about a Jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked for see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries are say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of world I remember it's not your name and not like jacked up that's not what you're going to see but as the mystery unfolds that's how you know whether your name is there and you can say I see my name because I see the mystery I have spiritual revelation I see the mystery so I see my man and that's why you can't stop me from shouting you can't just I lost my mind I lost my mind but I did get them out of Christ all right see the books even sealed in heaven the mysteries are say it's my name now I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on on the book before the foundation world but the first thing that that represented that Redemption come the Lamb that had been slain from the foundation world and he took the book glory open the Pope and tore off the seals and send it down to I'm to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people Oh glory now see when you go back and you listen to that you'll find just if you read in the Bible it says that the lamb took the book or went and actually I think revelation 6 talked about the lamb opening the seals well in 1963 brother Branham open a suit so the question is how did the lamb open the seals and brother Branham open this is brother Branham just told us - yes he says the lamb he says and he took the book glory open the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the earth to his to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people so the lamb did take the book but the lamb took the book open the book and sit down to his angel on earth to reveal it just people and let me tell you the secret things belong them to learn our God but would be always then they belong on to us and don't try to take what Gotham gave me some stimulation from revelation there you know my what happened screams the shouts the hallelujah is the anointed the power the glory the manifestation an old John who had been standing there stemming our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth and everything in the sea hurt me holla amen blessings honor and might and power be to him that list forever never talk about a happy time when the seals broken John must have looked in and seen past the curtain of time instead there's John oh he was so happy he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in having everything in earth everything beneath the earth every creature and everything else heard me saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and power and might and riches belong to him amen can I just leave y'all something out of Revelation one George this is is rich and I just enjoy fellowship and around it we hit this this morning in son to school and just bless my heart I probably be good for you all to hear too since y'all can't come to Sunday school revelation 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John thanks sent and signified this by his angel revelation 1:1 by his angel unto his servant John so John became what we call his scribe done somebody gave John what to write and John began to write it he was a scribe verse 2 says who bore who bare record of the word of God you know the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so first of all we blessed from reading it second we blessed by hearing it and third we bless for keeping it now what we did is I went over because if this was sent in verse one it says it was decent he sent an angel to his servant John he was if there was someone sent to John now remember John is caught up in a vision okay John is in a vision as he's writing the book of Revelation he is in a vision and not only is he a vision I love the way brother Solomon he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day the Lord's Day is a day of judgment the Lord's Day amen is their judgment going back to the beginning of my sermon God say before the great and terrible day he was gonna send Elijah the Prophet John is in the spirit and he sees an angel said to him to tell him about revelations - angels we can find a little bit more about this angel in revelation 22 let's read this revelation 22 verse 8 let's look at this now in Liu Yun I'm coming home now bear with me this is not John saw these things and heard them and when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things John saw so much he was ready that worship the angel that showed him but notice what the angel says in verse 9 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets so this angel was a perfect I'm other brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of the book worship God so John was ready to worship His Prophet but the Prophet said no don't worship Me worship God John caught up in the spirit of the Lord's Day was talking to an angel revealing to him revelation this angel happened to be a prophet and if he's caught up in the spirit on the Lord's Day the Lord's Day is the day of judgment and God tells us a corner Malachi for that before the great and terrible day of the Lord the Lord's Day he's going to send us a prophet who you think jumps well I believe the one he'd be seeing is the profit that was promised for the last day before Jesus came church wing with Helen this wise people's we searched the scripture and we know we stand yeah beware of false Christ's but try to find the one real one because before you can have a false dollar you got to have at least one real dollar I can't spend five dollars they'll lock me up but I do need the
