up and we've been dealing in the sub to kilvo a worship see this is much like this this Bible here we read here into Terada me when the children of Israel they was they was in bondage down in Egypt right and and they was praying they pray for hundred years for God to Sydney on the right all right to signal me they they they they they they exit out of Egypt somebody that showed them the way to the promised land we like to go to Disneyland they want to go to the promised land so they was looking forward to this journey and they will pray send somebody had a shower that a free us from this bondage that we're in from these jobs and the things that are bonded us down here so that we can go and worship you in the land which you gave us we want to go to Disneyland amen so God heard they cry and he said I will call it the deliverer and and and they left Egypt and they went across it was a long journey and a longer journey there was some bumps in the road there was some different things that came up along the journey and during the journey he said now a lot of times when me and my wife we took our kids we got a week we got to set some ground rules you say okay now wait a minute where y'all did did we get here and I'll go in here at the crazy right we got to stay together we we we have a plan we don't want nobody getting lost we don't know nobody running off getting in trouble acting unseemly so we kind of had a little talk in the car don't know what I'm talking about so along the journey you know they got to the mouth and motor said y'all stay here I'm gonna go up and I'm gonna talk to the Lord and he came back he came back with this with these tablets thing that we called him to be the 10 commandments these 10 commandments was the instructions on what you get in this land this is how you supposed one of the first things now I brought you out with a strong and mighty hand God is a jealous dog now I don't brought you out I don't pay for the trip I don't prepare the land for you get over there and get beside yourself and start watching another god yeah but see these haters this Seder calls Satan he's a slickster yeah you gotta watch him he will burn you don't even know if you're not keeping your eyes on the Prophet on the message if you're not staying focused on the world of the idol worship and you won't even know it you're many people today think that they're worshiping God you're saying the name Jesus but you're not what God is not accepting that let me give you some example we're gonna do a little backtrack then we're gonna move forward y'all some of you have been here always at night encounter I'm kind of just working in the same line here we see back in the beginning amen Cain and Abel they will both come from a good family they was raised the same way went to the same schools both they went to the same church amen and they and they both had to worship tutto to sacrifice under God and then when we see that Abel you know winning he got a lamb you didn't just get any lamb he got his best land and he took that lamb and he went and he and he found him oh nice Rock altar yes and he got him another smaller Rock and he took that and he just I he beaten the throat that's right he's sacrificing his best lamb to God right this spotless right this blameless Lamb he speak miss lamb he the blood all over the white fire at a lamb Abel standing there with blood on his clothes blood in his hands now another hand came he brought another form of worship right he he he till the soil and and he grew in a garden and he had fruits and flowers and different things and they were beautiful and he took the time and and him any built this elaborate altar right with the pineapples in there and the different color fruit and flower it was gorgeous beautiful able stand to know where that would blood dirty and God told him I can't accept that if you worship like your problem I'll accept your work Cain was sincere in what he was doing he was truly worshiping God with all he laid he walked in the field of sweat day after day to grow DS him and he the Wiis and he any any any water them anything and he did all of this work said I can't accept conscious not within the revelation see Abel had a revelation and understood that did sacrifice represented the sacrifice of the Lamb that would come in the future and Abel I'm contained didn't have that right he did what he thought in his mind was good sort of law couldn't accept that and we see that uh the Bible say that he was wrong he got angry yeah yeah he got angry and slew his brother yeah I put that one on the Shelf and we'll come back to that later cuz we go see the same thing happen back in at another time yeah was the same kind of spirit took place God didn't accept they worship and they got angry and they killed a brother man amen moving forward we looking and seeing okay Noah had sons and and and and we see that going down he's one of his grandson sons of ham Nimrod and they nama and they built the tower you see when when when God was so disgusting with the sins of that current time because the sons of God looked upon the daughters of man and and took upon them wives and and and and and and and he he said I'm going to destroy this it grieved God that he made man and so he that we know about the Great Flood and things like that so so so this fella said well well well well I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do come about that and he built the tower a very tall tower enamored just huge huge thing and at that time he pulled all of the small countries in and he and he and he built this tower that then he said well if God have a flood again we'll just go up in the top of the tower yeah and and be safe but God had other plans but we see this fella here Nimrod he was a great warrior and and and uh he was he was an evil man yeah he was an evil man and he tried to do things outside of the will of God he wanted to he wanted to go his own way so he was being led by another spirit the same spirit that when God told Cain if you worship like your brother I'll accept oh why couldn't he just do that right no because there was another spirit that was controlling them and this fellow kind of had the same thing see the spirits don't die the man died but the spirits live on we're gonna by the help of the Lord walk you all the way down to did day and show you the same spirit right we're still here today Naim wrong they built this and then there was the the place of idol worship there was three things that this fella wanted to do we noticed that he said he wanted to build a strong nation he wanted to start his own religion and and he wanted to make a name for himself now we find here in this location here that it was the basis of every system this was the beginning right the seat of every system of idolatry yeah the one thing that gods don't have any other gods before me amen and Satan we realized that has always wanted to be a worship right oh man and and and just like God well he watched and then and he was cast out and he saw God in the Garden of Eden and he kind of saw how he did things and and how he it took him six thousand years a man in the seventh he rested in and in all of these things and he he and he said what I want to do the same thing I want to be worshipped just like that I want I want I want people to be in awe of me you know so so he began to figure out a way so how can i how can I pull the worship of from from from him to me so he began to come up with these these different ways and and and and and he began to introduce this idol worship right this worship of other things but see you got the rememba see here the devil impersonates Christ almost to the letter almost to the letter the Bible says that it'll be so close to the deceive the very leg if it was possible to see the fella if it was possible so he's gonna he's Easy's whitey he's watched he is he he's watch Connie and he tries to stay right close and kind of mimic everything that he do now we see that Babylon it was established in Hamsterdam Nimrod firm the first call it was called the gates of paradise later called Babylon which means confusion there was idolatry there and set up that was set up there amen and we see that that in this time that one of the things that they thought they did was the worship a man of those the system of polytheism form of worship which which which means a man that these three gods they they they instituted this this three cars type of worship of multiple gods one being mainly the worship of saints or of a family with the mother the father and the child and and pushing the mother of a front above the child and you see this in all different forms of religion and and different things like that across the world today amen I'm gonna get into some things but I don't want to put the cart before the horse so y'all pray for me that uh we see here that bear let's let's go to Jeremiah Jeremiah seventh chapter will Jeremiah the seventh chapter want to look at some things here and just kind of walk you through and see how this seat for this fella a manager might a seventh chapter say man when you have it we're gonna start from the tenth verse and and come and stand before me in the house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to all these abominations in the house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in the eyes in your eyes behold even I have seen it saith the Lord but go ye now I went through my place which is in Shiloh where I which when I set my name at the first and see what I did what I did and for this wickedness for the wickedness of my people Israel and now because ye have done all these works saith the Lord and I spake unto you rising up early speaking but you heard not and I called you but you answered young therefore will I do unto this house which is called by my name where when you trust and unto this place which I gave to you and to your father's as I have done in Shiloh and I will catch you out of my sight and I have cashed all I have cast out all of your brother in' even the whole seed of ephraim therefore preg not thou for these people need to lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for I will not hear thee see it's down not that they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the children gather wood and father Kindle and the and fire and women need their dough and make cakes to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offering unto their gods that they may provoke me to anger they do provoke me to anger say as the Lord of God now we see what what they was doing here is they had done got into idol worship and Bell was one of the most noted Idol gods of all the ages and and he was the Sun God and and then he had a wife who was the moon goddess I can't hardly pronounce her name I think it's a steer or something along those lines and it was its own a Roman coin and see she was called the goddess of the moon goddess the Queen of Heaven a man she was the mother of God and the Sun s you in God was Balaam well all of these was pagan worship they worship the Sun now we find that this displeased God this angered God this was a dark time because they had went to idol worship and and what they was that the needing of the door and the poor not doing they was what they was doing was taking communion they was taking communion with these idol gods and they was they was they was worshiping they was worshipping a god but there was worshipping an idol God a man and see sometimes if you're not careful if you're not careful and if you're not if you're not searching and if you're not hungry and not thirsting for the knowledge of the truth you can get something to idol worship not knowing it in anger God because he said I have no other God before me amen he says we see that the American Indians and the different ones this kind of worship just kind of promulgated a spread throughout the world where there was a queen of woman amen worship amen go to Daniel the third chapter Daniel the third chapter look at some things there then you the third chapter to seventh verse I'm sorry the third shot that we'll start reading from the third verse then the prince and the governors and the captains and the judges the treasurers and the counselors in the shares and all the rules of the Providence well gather together unto this dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then and held cried aloud to you it is commanded o people o nation and languages that are what time you hear the sound of the cornet flute the harp the sight view the salt the psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music that ye fall down and worship the golden the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up and whoso falleth not down and worship shall be saying I will be cast into the midst of the burning fire therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute the horror the sack ball the sultry and all kinds of music all the people in the nations and the languages fell down to worship the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up brothers and sisters were living in a day where Satan has done the same thing we have now they used to be a time where in order to listen to music I think you had to go and you had to turn what they call that thing a start off some kind of a phone or whatever and and and and and the music would come out and it was didn't have high definition and all of that it was just some music so we went from there and I think they were maybe the 8-track was next I mean I know some remember the eight-track so maybe don't remember the eight-track remember the a track and the the record player and it moved on and Satan got even with the music he says well I gotta get him to worship now he's remember he's trying to promulgate this worship he won't he won't dis worship so he said I gotta get more people I got more people into this music I can control them I can pull them with this music so then I come up with uh well we got the cassette player in the little portable box on the shoulder yeah and they walk with the big box I were back in the 80s some of y'all remember that some of y'all don't another device she said well I'm agimo but the little bit black hole a Walkman you can put your tape in there and clip it to your belt no your headphones on and you're listening to your music your country your route right and all whatever you wanted to listen to and all of it messages and different things just going to you speed no The Devil's song service [Music] you just haven't fellowship with the devil all day long right and he got even slicker he said well I'm gonna put these things on CD and get them even smaller what ain't got it's easier to carry we're gonna go all the way or they might be streaming it's on your phone oh the whole music industry yeah it's 24/7 constantly worshiping just like they was here yeah in Daniel the image this worship of Satan now we look at another interesting thing here that it became to a point well it became law that if you didn't worship right you'll be dealt with now it's gone from a deception to a forcing right yeah no man and we hit it right there my brothers and sisters right first it's a deception Amen now going back to Jeremiah we see we see here how they they they begin to talk to talk to worship falsely this Queen the moon-goddess in this bill and and and and and and and said taking had another trick he had another trick up their sleeve he say well I introduced this music in and and and I and I and I'll write I mystic Minds up with this music get them in and it is framework and get him into this flow of this idol worship so Dan he began to the music y'all hear me mind begin to degrade the morals of the women it began to DT now now not now not now through the music through the music through the music you began to see the the women began to be affected right not a man are being affected to Waseca said is it a devil he tricked them here Jeremiah to work of the Queen of Heaven see in the beginning he deceived Eve to create the original fall and and and even therein in Babylon here place the the muzzle over the child so it has always been about the worship of a woman always been about the worship of them hey that's the same secret weapon just I can use cccccc the man not God God made man in his own image and the woman was a byproduct she came from the rib of a man so he said if I can I can I hear something I can use because this was not part of the original creation I can get in here and I can use this Avenue to pour worship towards me I can use this tallest Avenue to make millions phone right yeah y'all stay with me we're gonna work with this a little bit so we see a man mainly here in the United States amen the god of this society and the god of this nation how the woman has been through the music and through Hollywood and television and different things like that just the basic morals have have just deteriorated to a point to where it's just it's just a collapse of society used to be that narrow that the mother is the child's first teacher right but we find in this day that the mother is not teaching the child be putting headphones on material give them something to occupy a time right well we'll sit him in front of the television and that's a good mother cause the bad ones out at the club or wherever more

have filthy acts in their worship right a man they they claimed that she was a creator and she carried a seed in her womb which was the biggest lider devil ever told the only creator is God she will sway man any way she wants to let me say that again a woman in the hands of the devil will sway a man with the baptism of Holy Ghost anyway she won't - yes he got something like that for you yeah and
