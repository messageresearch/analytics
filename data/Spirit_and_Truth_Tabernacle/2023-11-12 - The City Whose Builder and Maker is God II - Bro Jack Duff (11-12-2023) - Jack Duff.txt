my dad and uh and I said well you know 8 years ago when we lost dad uh you were at a different space but what God can [Music] do and in eight years you all know eight represents the number of new beginning and uh you know to see what the Lord is is done and uh and and I mean he didn't he didn't just eulogize but he the fell he preached he pre I like to I like to use a term that brother brother Smiley used he said he was breaking bread I said my God but we were just blessed you know just to just to see what the Lord had given him amen and in this time and and what he delivered to the people and I believe the seeds were swn and God himself will bring forth the increase amen but we we just appreciate that we want to ask that you continue to keep the family in prayer amen that God would just give them strength uh through this this time amen and um I'm sorry I see a precious brother here in the back next to Sister Zion God bless you good to have you with us amen um certainly certainly our blessing I needed to also just quickly mention that uh we um we many of you some know some may not know but as a church we volunteer for a um a food pantry and this happens every Thursday that we go out and uh and provide food to the community uh and uh sister Tina spearheads this for we certainly appreciate her and um you know this you know it's a lot of things that happen before the food get down Thursday y'all should see sister Cobb just running from back and forth to Walmart getting boxes and she happened to be away for a few weeks and y'all know where that responsibility fell to go get boxes and put boxes together and y'all don't know what be happening behind the scenes brother Jack and sister Erica is putting boxes together we don't mind that we don't mind it but uh but I want to just say this to the church that um you know every Thanksgiving we do a turkey drive and what we do is we provide turkeys for every family that comes through that line and uh what the uh sister Tina and sister Erica them did this year they they kind of had people pre-registered for the turkeys that we were going to need to purchase and uh we come to find out this year we need to purchase 84 turkeys pre-registered 84 people 84 families need turkeys now here's the good news I'm not going to ask y'all for money for the turkeys cuz somebody's already blessed us with the money to buy all those turkeys we thank the Lord for that uh but what we also do is when you know we also during the holiday season we like to give them gift cards uh just to bless a family so I'm going to going to ask you if we already know we had 84 turkeys I don't know how many gift cards we're going to need but we're actually going to try to prepare to buy 100 turkeys for those that didn't pre-registered we want to have a couple extra that we can give away and if uh if we if we can't give those away at Thanksgiving then we'll give them away at Christmas but for Christmas season if you would if you'd be um so kind to just maybe buy a gift card or two that we can give out to those that are in need amen uh here in our city amen so let's see how we can touch them but like I said we needed 84 turkeys I'm sure we're going to need just as many gift cards so whatever the Lord put in your heart amen we would certainly appreciate amen God bless you uh on today amen I know yesterday was uh Veterans Day so um uh since since uh uh the veterans we we didn't have you in church yesterday we have you today all the veterans please stand all veterans please stand all veterans please stand our veterans please amen we we want to give a round of applause to all of our veterans praise the Lord I I don't see sister Amanda she she there okay she she she not standing but sister Amanda's a veteran as well so we thank the Lord for all of our veterans God bless you all thank you so much for your service to our country God richly bless you God bless you amen amen praise God all right all right all right all right so musicians thank y'all appreciate y'all so much amen thank y'all and I just appreciate the specials appreciate the worship appreciate everything that's been done Amen in the name of Jesus uh I'd like to just read a scripture we're going to go back to a thought that we had started working with a few weeks ago uh on the city whose Builder and maker is God Amen and uh we want to uh refresh a few things things and then kind of go forward uh with a little bit more so if you don't mind standing with me as we read God's word I would certainly appreciate it uh Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 uh starting at verse 8 amen then also I'll read from the book of Revelation verse 20 I mean uh chapter 21 verse 1-8 but here in Hebrews 11:8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should received which which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heir is with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which ha foundations whose Builder and maker is God amen amen amen yes yes there's so much in the word there uh let us let us turn over here um to uh Revelation 21 amen just verse 1-8 here the Bible says and I saw and new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away so the one that we are living in right now uh is supposed to pass away now uh we'll get there I'm not there yet but just a a a precursor it's not that it's going to be annihilated it's simply going to be cleansed amen uh and it's very similar to the process of you receiving the Holy Ghost you you as an individual not annihilated but you have been cleansed so that God can dwell inside of you this earth goes through the same process that you go through all right it says I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband now that's a very important scripture to me again I I won't hit it today but uh but this is going I'm going I'm coming there I'm coming there uh is coming down out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband uh and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death praise God for that neither sorrow praise God for that nor crying praise God for that neither shall there be any more pain praise God for that for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and just uh real simple I can just you know just just make this real real easy this is almost the last chapter in the Bible uh and we just saw something here we passed over real quick but it's there in the scripture said he that sat upon the throne not them come on all right it ain't the father Son and the Holy Ghost because the father Son and the Holy Ghost is the same person which is the Lord Jesus Christ so the Bible says he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst for of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things I thank God for that promise and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers uh and whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death amen thank God thank God ain't no Liars going to be there ain't no whoremongers going to be there ain't no Sorcerers going to be there ain't no murderers going to be there ain't no idolators going to be there see that that whole Atmos got to be changed now if you want to make it to the other side amen man those that's working abomination in their body they ain't going to be there sir hello I mean and people say God love everybody he do but he don't love the sin so the sin got to be taken care of before we talk about going to heaven let's pray father we thank you for the reading of the word but we take uh we ask that the Holy Spirit would now bring Clarity on the things that we've read and uh we take every Spirit that's against the spirit of God underneath the control of the Holy Ghost even right now and father may you reveal yourself to your people uh as your Prophet told us Lord you have to send down representation may it come down today and may the people recognize who they are in you in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen uh I'm I'm going to take a little journey here at the beginning of this sermon um I want to read a a number of things for you um first of all when we when we read the book of Revelation this is um um this this book has been a book that many have been afraid of however uh most most people can go to Revelation 21 and read the scripture that I just read and everybody gets excited about no more crying and no more death and no more sorrow and him wiping tears from eyes that's so uh I mean Mo most people can just read that and understand it no problem at all but it's all the other things that's in the Book of Revelation that kind of scare people sir praise the Lord amen before you get to Revelation 21 and 22 which is the end of the book uh you got to go through all the other chapters and you got to try to have an understanding as what's going on in those chapters but but what I wanted to do just amen today uh just kind of uh help us understand it's a blessing first of all to read the book of Revelation amen it's it's a blessing and and I want to just kind of bring out a couple blessings that we find in the Book of Revelation and then I'll bring out got a couple other uh blessings that we find in the New Testament but I can't read all the blessings today but let me just read some of them over you let's go back to Revelation 1 and3 amen Revelation 1 and3 and uh it just tells us something here glory to God uh it says blessed is he that readeth amen and they that hear the words of this prophecy and not only that once they hear it amen and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and I like that because uh there was a time in in in history where the time was not at hand and when you go back to the Book of Daniel there was a time where God told Daniel seal up the things that you have amen you just saw don't don't don't don't don't share anymore about it seal those things up until the end time and we're living in a day Hallelujah where we can declare the time is at hand for us to understand what is written here in this book right amen Revelation that's that's Revelation 1 that's the first chapter in Revelation Revelation 22:7 which is the last chapter of the Book of Revelation says behold I come quickly and it says blessed is he that keepeth good God Almighty you can't let this go keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book yes sir you got to have to keep everything that you that you that that God has tell you about this particular book you going to have to keep that in order to enjoy the blessings amen of this new Heaven and new earth all right Jesus makes a few comments amen about blessings in Matthew Chapter 5 and let's just pick this up glory to God and I'll come back and H hit a few more in Revelation but just go just bear with me this morning uh Matthew 5:1 says and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set uh his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven amen Jesus goes on to say blessed are they that mourn for they shall be confident what a promise that we can expect from the Lord Jesus it says blessed are the meek glory to God for they sh H inherit the earth amen verse 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen thank God for this promise amen verse S bless are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy amen verse eight blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and I like verse n blessed are the the peacemakers and I like the way the Bible put that amen the peacemakers are the ones that's blessed not the trouble makers on now amen the peacemakers are the ones that's blessed here blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven verse 11 blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely come on somebody when somebody lying on you they supposed to do that and when that happens you supposed to rejoice in that especially if it's something amen that that that that that's pertaining to God Amen here the Bible actually tell Jesus say you blessed when that happened to you we actually think that the devil did this and the no you are blessed when that happens to you amen blessed blessed blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute persecute you and shall say all man of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward where's your reward at you're not some of y'all looking for rewards on the Earth but your reward is in heaven Hallelujah there's some streets of gold waiting on you amen I mean streets of transparent gold there there's a house on Mountain waiting on you come on somebody God got great things in store for those that will endure rejoice and be exceeding glad I like that for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you Jesus gives us all these blessings I want to pick up another blessing in Matthew 11:6 amen hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Matthew 11:6 it says and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me though those you blessed for not being offended by somebody criticize you for your stand on the word blessed is he who won't be offended in me amen come on Church glory to God all right all right I'm I'm picking up another one Matthew 13 uh verse uh 14-1 17 look at this one and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah uh uh which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them look at this verse but blessed are your eyes oh good God Almighty blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verely I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see I told you Daniel was told to close it up seal it up he could not see the things that we even talking about today publicly talking about Daniel had to seal it up but the time is at hand for us to understand these things amen amen for verily I sayto you that that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them until to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them you blessed to be able to see you're blessed to be able to hear and I'm going to tell you that's a double blessing cuz naturally if you can see and naturally if you can hear that's a blessing but to hear spiritually and to see spiritually is a greater blessing going back to the Book of Revelation just catching up catching a couple more verses here amen Revelation 14:13 and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth y s the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their Works do follow them amen you bless when you die in Christ Hallelujah all right Revelation 16:15 says behold I come as a thief blessed is he that WTH and keepeth his garments lest he walk walk naked and they see his shame Revelation 19 and9 it says and he said un me right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb and he said un me these are the true sayings of God let me just go on just just a couple more and I and I'm going repeat Revelation 227 and a second I want to repeat it for a reason Revelation 26 says this blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years this is the Millennium Reign and we're blessed to be a part of that Millennial Reign I'm going back to to reread Revelation 22:7 the last blessing that's pronounced Amen in the Bible behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book this is important cuz there's a devil that's out there in the land that's trying to get people to break away from the Prophecies of this book but but you blessed for keeping them can and I'm going tell you this even if you don't understand [Music] it you can't explain it keep it anyway look you ain't the first person that couldn't explain it and understand it Peter had the same experience as you had when Jesus say let you eat of My Flesh and drink my blood and and the whole church got up and walked out left left TW 70 that was casting out devil walked out of church that day and they looked at Peter said Peter you going to come with us I mean you heard what he said I mean he he he's a cannibal he wants us to eat his flesh what you GNA do Peter he said I ain't going nowhere I I I I don't understand what he just said I can't explain it don't don't ask me to break it down I have no idea what Jesus just said but when Jesus asked the question to Peter will you also go with him Peter Peter gave an answer say uh to whom Oh I Feel Jesus you mean go back to my denomination you mean go back into the things of the world to whom shall we go only you have the words of eternal life Jesus I can't explain it I can't understand it but I ain't going nowhere you got to learn how to keep what God is giving you amen amen this verse says this verse says behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the Sint of the prophecy of this book one more blessing that I want to read from the book of Luke 11: 24- 28 very familiar story when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walkth through Dry places seeking rest find the none and finding none he saith now who is this he this is the unclean spirit that used to live in your house hello somebody I'm I I hope we talking to you this morning but the unclean spirit that used to live in your house actually this unclean Spirit using your your body as his residence my Lord when he tell other Spirits what his address is he he using your body as his address and see what happens with the unclean Spirit the word could come and cast that Spirit out of you amen I'm the word itself will do the cleansing if you allow it to the word will come and cl cast that Spirit off of you praise the Lord amen but it's up to you after you leave church with what you do to keep that Spirit Away From You Jesus tells us amen exactly what the process is the unclean spirit is gone out of a man the word is cast him out right he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith I will return somebody out of get mad at a devil this is not your house you don't belong here you ain't living here no more somebody ought to serve the devil some eviction [Applause] papers no this ain't your house this is God's [Applause] [Music] [Applause] house don't let the devil talk to you like this look at look look at how bold this devil is being cast out kicked out by the word you going looking in dry places and seeking where he can where he can live and got nowhere else to go your friend won't let him in your pastor won't let him in your mama won't let him in but what he decided to do is I'm going to come back to my house where I've been dwelling all this time now here's a problem here's a problem here's a problem come on now I mean let's just look at the process Jesus tells us what's happening right look at this now I will return into my house whence I came out not now you didn't go out on your own we kicked you out and when he cometh he findeth that sweat Hallelujah and garnished see that things are changing on the inside it's swept and garnished and and now you think this a real comfortable spot but you got to understand something that happens with this devil he realized that he is not strong enough to come back by himself and to over take you y'all ain't talking to me yet so in order of this that to to get back into the swept out house into the garnish house he has to invite some friends to his address Lord and what happens is you're not fighting just one devil now you fighting eight Devils while your house is swept out while is godess now you start fighting more Devils right but great is he that's in you you don't worry about the process cuz greater is he that is in you he that's in the world remember a little story amen a man told and I'm coming back to the scripture in a second but you know this man invited Jesus to come to his house and uh you know he's like Jesus I I I want you to come in but here's your room right here you just stay right there and you let me know what you need and and I'll come get it but you just stay right here in this room Jesus said okay all right no problem so he uh later on that night the devil showed up at the man house knocking on the door and came in and my it was all kind of tussling tumbling and uh lamps breaking all kind of stuff going on down there and I mean that man was getting wore out by the devil and Jesus was upstairs so the next morning the man come out with bandages and everything say Jesus didn't you hear all that rck ISS going on down here how come you didn't come out and help me he said cuz you told me to stay in this room if you would have given me access to your whole house I could have took care of that problem for you and what I'm here to tell you this morning God needs access to your whole house not just part of it God want access to the whole thing oh y'all going to make me preach amen even them secret things that you trying to keep God out of God W access in them [Applause] areas Lord verse 26 says then goeth he and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked so this is a worst problem so here's the thing when you get this the place all swept out and garnished and clean you better make make sure you get it filled with Christ that way he can't come back in there make sure it get filled up with Christ look at this more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first this process is is is Real Jesus told us about it and and some of us in here are witnesses is that we've seen this happen so so it's very important that you know when when you don't don't play with Devils my god when you when you finally get rid of one you better keep them out of there don't let them back in and and the time that he comes back is when you got it all cleaned up that's when you want to come back all right look at this verse 27 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice said unto him blessed is the womb this lady was listening to the word as Jesus was preaching say blessed is the womb that bear thee and the PS which thou has sucked but look at what Jesus say but he said yeay rather blessed are they that hear the word of godall but here's another thing no y'all Y got to read Pastor Comm not not just hear it not sit here and say Amen with your mouth but your life got to say amen that's blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it I want to read a quote here from a sermon the unpardonable sin I totally forgot to welcome the sisters back from their trip God bless y'all so good to have y'all back had a beautiful beautiful Cruise amen all right all right the imparable sin is where I want to just grab something here really quick this this here in the word of God and keeping it is so important uh the the very last chapter in the book of Revelation keeping the sayings of the prophecy these are very important words that we need to take heed to watch this in the message I'm par say the prophet makes this statement says now what is the unpardonable sin now you know uh before I go further in that quote him and his mother was having a conversation one time and his mom was tell him you know the unpardonable sin is to have an abortion that's unpardonable and um you know he says well you know that that that is sin it is sin but it's not unpardonable some of us would say divorce is the unpardonable sin it it is sin but it's not unpardonable hello fornication is no it it is sin but it's not unpardonable and even when God pardons you for something he don't want you getting back involved in the same thing he pardon you from hello somebody adultery is sin but it's not unpardonable right I mean well well brother brandom tells us here is the imperdonable sin is to sin willfully and when when does this will for sin happen y'all got to watch the words that are being Spoken Here the will for sin occurred after uhoh after you have received the knowledge of the truth so when you come to church and the truth is presented to you and you willfully walk out of here and keep on sinning you are committing the unpardonable sin yes sir well I tell you what if's some Churches you can go to and they ain't going to say nothing like that they'll never you'll never hear nothing like that that's TR but we trying to get people right for heaven let me keep reading let me keep reading after you received knowledge of Truth is that right for he that sins and what is sin unbelief right when you look at it and say that's the truth but you refuse oh good God Almighty a little hot right now it's getting hot up in here Lord but but but but but when you refuse you you look at it say that's the truth I'm a message believer but I ain't living the message look at it it say he said when you look at it and say that's the truth but you refuse to receive it he that sins or disbelieves willfully after he received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin there is the truth there it lays there and just exactly like you come up he goes on he says here is the same thing in a great way let's look I'll close then it says there is there is Jesus Christ he's the son of God to accept him is life to reject him is death do what you want to you say well now I don't believe it well I'll tell you I don't believe it I just don't well if you don't that's up to you you don't have to have life you don't have life that's all because that's the truth that's right all right the same thing on any other truth that's right to refuse to reject to disbelieve the word of God it's unpardonable sin you have no more right if you come up and say well I don't believe he was the Christ then you'll never be saved until you repent of that and be reconciled to him this is the truth of God and is put out to you you say oh I don't believe it then you are cut off from God until you repent and come to the truth is that right now here the prophet just made it very very clear when we reject Christ it's I'm part of a sin and what we mean by this rejecting Christ it's um uh I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to save some things but but you know it it's the reveal word for your day right if I can just put it that way I mean when when he when when Jesus came on the scene and I'm and I'm I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming let me let me let me hold it just hold let I'm going to hold it just for a little bit let me go to my next quote but you know uh when Jesus was on the scene they rejected him in his day everybody in receive Jesus everybody in everybody want so welcoming to want them to come to their house some people want them out the house out the city everything I mean get Jesus a lot of people rejected Jesus and let me twe it this way the majority yes sir rejected Christ and if they rejected him when he was walking on the face of this Earth they going to reject him again today the majority will reject him I know y'all see church is full full of people but the people ain't receiving Christ they not they go I mean they go to the altar they do all these things but they're not really receiving Christ because if you receiving Christ you'll come in line with his word you're not going to receive Christ and then reject his word you're not going to do that he is the word that's right all right all right don't don't get tricked this hour don't get tricked now let me read another another uh quick quick quick uh quote here out of message Shalom and and and I'm I'm I'm going forward I'm going to try to turn a corner in a second but let me leave my Foundation here in the message Shalom says good people call in uh in this thing good people sincere people like Mary and Joseph now watch this says good people sincere people like Mary and Joseph wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute good people sincere people like Mary and Joseph wait a minute hold on hold on wait Mary was the one that was given the responsibility for carrying Christ now Joseph was not his father Joseph wasn't his daddy Mary wasn't his mother she was just the amen the the the tool that God used to bring forth life come on somebody right but but here brother brandom call them good people very sincere de people but when there came a time where here uh Mary and Joseph they misplaced Jesus they lose him somewhere along the the journey they they get lost and amen they gone three days can you imagine that you ain't seen your child 12 years old for three days something wrong here I I I know I if I had a child 12 years old after about 3 hours I'll Be Wondering Where They At hour where where you at what's going on you ain't called you ain't said nothing I need to know what's happening that's right but three days they have gone without Jesus finally decide well you know what they got looking around and looking around looking around we can't find Jesus went back to the city where they last was and where did they find them oh for you young people for you young people where they find Jesus not at the arcade sir sir not at the football field or the soccer field they found Jesus in church not only there he was there teaching the ones that were older than he and when Jesus was teaching them men they were so shocked How could a boy this this young be teaching us things they should have known there was something special about Jesus but yet we find later in the scripture these same people was the ones rejecting him amen good people s sincere people went to find Jesus look at this Mary like Mary and Joseph they were very sincere see thinking he was with them when he wasn't people in church today think that God is with him but he's not Mary and Joseph you know when when they was up at the feast Jesus the age of 12 they thought presuming he was with them but he wasn't good people today think the same thing they these people that's organized in the council churches these people in these organizations they think they're doing a good thing they're presuming he's with them when they're not see many people think that he was with them when they shook his hands when they shook hands with the preacher and put their name on the book but he wasn't many people thought when they were sprinkled confirmed baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost thinking he was with them they're good people Mary and Joseph was good people but the fact was he wasn't there don't presume anything when Mary and Joseph Found Jesus there in the temple teaching Mary Mary made a statement that just blew her testimony out the water she says uh Jesus me and your father been looking for you and Jesus had the stop her right there in front of everybody say uh my my my father you and my father but don't you know that I got to be about my father's business business and he corrected her the word always correct the error he corrected her right in front of everybody H don't you know I got to be about my father's business said right then she just kind of hushed the mouth say no don't say nothing no don't say nothing else but you might get really blasted Jesus was not received in his day but yet what we find amen and and here's the oh I I I missed this right there that ver that that paragraph 96 what is light I got to I'm I'm putting this in here because in the new city Jesus is the light of the city the Bible says he the lamb is the light thereof so Jesus is the light of the city what is light watch it now the Vindicated spoken word of God outside of that there is no light amen see you can't lighten the Earth with flashlights it takes God's word that's made manifest that's the sun now now now we we're making some progress light is when the word has been made manifest right before you hallu light is when the word has been manifest before you when Jesus came on the scene he was the light of of the day that's right when Moses came on the scene Moses was carrying the light for the day when Noah came on the scene Noah was carrying the light for the day if you didn't want to walk in darkness you better receive what Noah had to say Amen come on somebody when there was Darkness all over Egypt but in Goan there was no Darkness there was a group of people willing to receive what the prophet Moses had to say God don't change his program if he had a prophet back then he has a prophet today Hallelujah and we got to receive what that Prophet is saying in order to walk in the light I I asked this question the last time I brought this sermon and I'm I'm I'mma ask it again and I'mma move on if one Rejects the light of their day how can they expect to live in the city where the lamb is the light amen right amen amen this just it's a question that came to me if one rejects the light for their day how can they expect to live in a city where the lamb isite and notice I want you to my pay attention to the question if one rejects for the light for their day you're not living in Paul's day you're not living in irani's day you're not living in Martin's day and Luther's day and Columbus Day you're not living in that day you living in a different day and you reject you need to figure out Lord what is the like for my day you not living in Noah day you not living in Moses day this is your day and if you reject the light for your day how can expect to live in a city where the lamb is the light right all right let me we talking about a city who's building Mi is God now watch this watch this I said it before Jesus was the light in Genesis 1 when he when when when when when the Lord said when God said let there be light the first light that came out was the son of God light s o n it was the son of God light it wasn't the sunlight s n s in and Moonlight did not come until the fourth day read your Bible Hallelujah but it was the s o n light that came out of God when he said let there be light Hallelujah that's the same light that Paul saw on the road to Damascus there was a great light that Paul saw when he got knocked off his high horse and and the light spoke back to Paul Paul began to ask questions to the light who art thou the light the light said to Paul the light said it not nobody else said it but the light spoke back to Paul the light said I am Jesus so the same light that came out of God in Genesis 1 is the same light that'll be light in the city when we get to the other side and in between getting from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 we got to walk in the light for our day yes siren I got to I got to show you something I got I'm I'm I'm coming to it but but see you got to got to got to got to understand that that light is passing through the land yeah it's been passing since the days of Adam that's right all the way I mean that it led the children of Israel out of the out of the Wilderness they had a pillar of Fire by day a pillar Cloud by a pillar Cloud by day a pillar Fire by night that was that same light leading them the same light when God said let there be light come on y'all you ain't going to make it without light God knew what he was talking about when the first thing he he spoken to a creation was light amen that shows how important it is for you to have light you can't see nothing without light come on somebody you ain't going to understand nothing without light and once light has been brought to you you got to walk in the light amen amen my my my I told y'all Jesus was the light in Genesis 1 I told you Jesus was the same light in uh in the middle of the Bible in Psalm 23 where he's the one that's causing the shadow amen the shadow of death the reason is a shadow because there's a certain amount of light that presents the shadow creates the shadow he is that light in the shadow of death Hallelujah he's also the light in John 8:12 where it says then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world but he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness Darkness but shall have the light of Life yes Jesus is the light of the new city Revelation 21 and 23 says and the city had no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it when the lamb and the lamb is the light thereof now I I want to just kind of go back to a little diagram that I gave you all last last time I'm going to pick this up and I got I got a little bit more to bring you today so um I read your quote out of questions and answers on Hebrews part three and I presented this to you last time I'm going to do it again today when the thousand years are expired on this earth and the Devil comes up and the second Resurrection comes the resurrection of the unjust they gather a great Army like the Sands of the sea and they come up to Compass the camp of the Saints now this is revelation uh this uh um uh that's been explained Revelation 20 I believe uh and when it does god reigns fire and brimstone out of heaven and destroys them John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem descending from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband there you are questions and answers on Hebrews and this next uh paragraph here paragraph says um there he said the wife the lamb and the bride will be there forever it says there will be a new Earth and this is the thing that gets me is the the dimensions that the prophet gives he says millions and millions of square miles millions and millions of square miles oh my uh the city the Bible measures out the city of 15,000 square miles is 15,000 mil long 15,000 miles wide now uh I again I believe that should be500 miles 1500 miles and uh but nonetheless we're going to do a quick calculation here and you're going to see that what Pro what the prophet said when he said square miles you're going to see how big and how how how large this city is I told you you might have a bucket list of cities that you want to go to and visit one day if this city ain't on the top of your bucket list you need to get rid of your list 15,000 miles wide 15,000 miles high that's exactly the description in the Bible gives us of the city no wonder there's no more sea there's no more place for it oh there'll be such beauty and and in there there's a fountain right at the Throne of God that flows Before the Throne there's a tree on either side of uh of the River of Life and in this tree dwells 12 manner fruits and yields its fruit every month I want to go back to uh the PowerPoint presentation that I gave you amen just uh uh last time we were teaching just want to again just try to I was just trying to wrap my mind around how large uh this city was and you know and as I was just I mean even even at even to this point as I'm preaching this I still can get my head wrapped around how big this city is I mean it is it's it's uh when when the scripture says eyes have not seen right ears have not heard nor has it entered into the heart of man the things God has prepared for those that love him it's I don't care how much I try to present this we'll never really touch the real we'll never get there but here you know I I brought out this um uh this chart the layers of the earth atmosphere uh in the in the PowerPoint that I have the city and maker who's God uh the second slide there I brought out this chart and what I was trying to show you let me see if I have uh my notes yeah so um there the very bottom this is the Earth's atmosphere this is what we live in right now the osphere amen really goes as high as about seven miles and that's as high as planes can fly pretty much in 7even mile that seven mile radius you get up there in the plane you get above the clouds and you just be looking like so peaceful like oh my this so nice this is just one as high as they're only about seven miles high that's it Stratosphere some hot air balloons and even some planes get up in there that's roughly between 7 to 31 miles high from where we are right now the mesosphere uh is roughly 31 to 50 miles high you can see meteors and everything like that and even uh uh uh uh like rockets can get up into that Hallelujah the mesosphere the thermosphere um you know that's roughly anywhere from 50 to 440 miles high but it's the exosphere that's the highest level and that's anywhere from roughly um uh 440 to 6,200 Miles High now brother bradam said this city that we're going to well the Bible says it the Bible say it's going to be500 Miles High so that city is going to reach from here up into here and y'all will be living somewhere along in here and somewhere along in here and somewhere along in here I mean now we we can't get there a plane can't even take us that high we disintegrate but but in order for us to live at this level in the exosphere it's going to all change let me tell you I I don't even have time to go but all this going to be blown away when we talk about a new Heaven and a new Earth all of this is gone sir and what gives you the ability to be able to live in that atmosphere now because you have been [Music] changed amen it's a change that actually puts you in a position where you can live up here with no problems at all amen yeah gravity won't be holding you down anymore Everything Changes amen now brother Brandon made the statement there in that quote about it being millions of square miles and I want to go to the next uh the next slide cuz you know 1500 miles high 1500 miles wide, 1500 miles the way we get to these millions because I don't I don't I'm not a really good math person some math people might be but 1500 miles high and wide give you 3,000 base height and when you start multiplying all this now you get to 2.25 which is 2,250,000 Miles squared right okay and then they say the volume the cubic cubic miles 1 billion 125 million I can't read the rest of it I've never seen a number that large I mean it go beyond uh what our mind can even imagine right I mean what God has in store for those that love him it goes beyond what our minds can even imag but let me tell you something you can't live any kind of way right now and expect to be over there you can't reject a light right now and expect to live in the city where the lamb is a light that's not going to happen sir I want to read one more quote to you and then I'm going to go to that next picture on that slide but let me read this quote ver this is coming out of future home of heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride oh I love the Lord notice now how he makes his way known by His prophets in the beginning he's never changed it salvation he justified him and Sanctified him sent the Holy Ghost and Fire and burnt the sin out him I like this see we're going to need the the sin burn out we can't you you if you look some of us already know we can't even even come to church with sin now y'all know I'm telling the truth lot of times we don't want to come to church because of the sin that's in our life that's right how you think you're going to heaven with sin I mean if you can't get by what it here on Earth how you going to go to heaven with it it ain't going to happen you need to take care of the sin question now how you take care of the sin question repent amen be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promises unto you your children those that are fall as many as the Lord Our God shall call I'm here I'm here in in in future home of the Heavenly bridegroom he says notice now he makes his way known by His prophets in the beginning he's never changed it look at this salvation he justified him and Sanctified him sent the Holy Ghost and Fire and burned the sin out him and dwelt in him himself watch this he does the Earth that uh he's going to use in a Plan of Redemption the same way so the same way he he he justifies the individual he also he also takes the Earth through the same process right he says uh he's going the the Earth that he's going to use in the Plan of Redemption the same way is represented and was baptized in water my God by Noah Jesus come and Sanctified it by dripping his blood Sanctified it by dripping his blood upon it and claimed it and in the new Earth that's to come is to have a holy fire baptism let me tell y'all something this Earth is I mean this new heaven is already in preparation yes sir in Noah's day it was baptized with water when Jesus came to Earth and dropped his blood on it it was being Sanctified but the last stage of of this new heaven new Earth is when it's baptized with fire that's when that whole atmosphere changes when it's baptized with fire the whole thing Chang and when you are baptized with fire everything about you should change come on church I'm going on I'm going on Amen it says Oh My My My it says Jesus come and sanctify it by dip uh dripping his blood upon it and claim it and in the new Earth that's to come is to have a holy fire baptism to clean it of every devil every germ every sickness everything that there is and make it a new I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth you become a new person amen not just an old and patched up by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit amen God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the holy ghost in Fire and comes himself look at this one look at this look at this sends down your representation let me just finish reading that but keep that in mind uh let me just put it this way you ain't going to make it to the other side unless God has sent your representation am am Lord oh Hallelujah sir let me just let me finish this send down your representation no man can come to me except my father has drawn him and all the father has given me will come to me you see it same plan same way let me try to help us understand how God sends our representation just get me ready for this next slide but I'll give you just a little example of a lady that heard from her representation what God does is he sends the word to you I'm I'm I'mma say it like this today right now God is sending down representation there was a woman in scripture just pull up the little slide for me I'mma I'mma give y'all a little note from the Prophet this is Brother brandom's diagram of someone receiving representation and what he starts out with in the diagram is the word because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word or the low ghost or the light or the pillar of fire is what came out of God when it said let there be light that's right that's what came out it was it was the word and and and notice here he says now when he got a circle there and there no darkness and that means it's just full of light yeah the word is full of light the word is the light the word is is life the word is everything we need think brother brother brother Solomon saiding something about about the word a little earlier amen but but but but the word is everything the word is pure the word the word is amen is it's my God it's it's all God perfect God the word is you got to be impressed with the word the word is Jesus but here you know brother Brandon puts the word here then he puts the Bible there and hold on one second don't don't don't do it too much and then he he puts w a w and then he puts pH so this is actually amen a story that where our church name has even come from because this ww is a woman that was at the well now here's the problem with this woman at the well on the outside when you look at her and when I look at her this lady just dark she can't go to the well when everybody else is going to the well she has to go at a different time because she can't be found with the virgins in the land hello anden some of us have been ostracized by the sins that we have committed we've ostracized ourself by the sins that we have committed you might as well say Amen but we've done things to our own self that put us out on the outside and this is why we dark all over the place well Jesus in the scripture in John 4 said he had need to go by Samaria right and and see when we read that in the Bible he man we think he just wanted to go to Samar no no there's more to it than that the reason that Jesus had to go by Samaria is because there was amen God was sending down representation and when God sends down representation it may find you in sin yes sir you might have been in a ballroom come on somebody you might have been like Samson in some lady's house that you shouldn't have been in hello somebody you might be in a relationship that you shouldn't have been in But Here Come the word coming down sending down your representation in the midst of your [Music] sin amen Jesus get to this woman at the well now she dark everybody knows she dark ain't nobody she can't she can't go out there with the same lady with the ladies when they go out to get water she can't do nothing she go out and get her water and Jesus said I got need to go by some when he get there he tell the disciples say now y'all go into the village and get some viddles and see this see brother brother Troy hit it yesterday I mean he he was breaking bread he say See Jesus got both a public and a private Ministry so he had to get rid of the disciples so he can kind of give a little and can I go a little further when he is actually getting involved when he's bringing you to private Ministry this is so he can bring down your representation sir how you know whether you got representation or not how you actually know whether you got representation or not it's based on how you respond when it actually comes [Applause] down amen hallelujah I told you earlier everybody was receiving Jesus even the ones that looked like they had everything together these guys looked on the outside like they had everything together they was carrying Bibles they was abiding by the law but when the manifested word came into their midst when the light showed up when the light came down to them it went dark showed that they didn't have representation no matter how religious they was on this side that's we not talk about religion we talk about relationship yes sir so this lady in her darkest of s i mean she she messed up y'all I'm talking about messed up but privately Jesus had to have a conversation with they start talking about church we worship here and y'all worship there and you do this and you that and and y'all Jews and and we Samaritans you said I'm not talking about that so you're going to come a time where you know you ain't going to be worshiping here or or there but you know you going you going to worship you know uh you going the God God is looking for those to worship Him in spirit and Truth father seeking them seeking them seeking them seeking them seeking them to Worship in spirit and truth and see as in the conversation he said now I ask you for something to drink and and uh said but the water that I got right so you a got nothing to draw no water with but the water the water I got it'll spring up in you like yeah Wells of everlasting life this lady say that lady say what kind of water say look sir look look I I don't see you you ain't got nothing to draw with but if you got that kind of water to give sir I need I need water like that you want some of this yeah I want some you really want some of this all right come on now yeah that water springing up in me yeah I want some of that go get your husband and come here go get my husband I Ain ain't got no husband we starting out in a good spot you're right that man you living with is not your husband and you shouldn't be living with him see but I got some El to tell you you had five others five others before you got him and you live with all of them like they was your husband oh Lord you know what she said she said now they taught me in Sunday school that when Messiah come Messiah going to do this yes sir all right now when these guys ask him was he the Messiah he never told him nothing but when she say you say Messi when Messiah come he going to do this say I am he I am he that speaks with you you know what that lady didn't need no more quotes she a need to see no more miracles she knew this man revealed everything about her she said you got to be the Messiah and let me tell you she had five men and then the sixth one that she was living with was not H but when she went running to the city and say come see a man she just found a seventh man and this seventh man changed her life from the inside out no more going back to that lifestyle anymore and because this light this representation came down took her Darkness away she could run through the city with light run through the city come see a man that told me the things I've done is not this W come on somebody is not this the be Messiah is not this message right what did it do in my life what did it do in your life it is not this [Applause] [Music] right thank you to whom shall we go this is what the eternal life is all about I I I I have recognized my representation God I mean y'all just think about where you was when you came in contact with this word wherever you was that was the moment God God was sending down representation hallelujah hallelujah that's where you I mean right at that moment he was sending down your representation and it's how you respond to what he sent down shows whether you got representation or not see the the word let me I I done I done left all my my little slides and everything y pull me off my slide but but the word had to come down and this is Jesus having a uh the word which which was Jesus at the beginning come down Jesus on the earth manifested in flesh give me hit next and I think it got two scriptures here that that a little pull up here that I'll refer to yeah the word was made flesh amongst us we beheld his glory this is Jesus the glories of of of uh uh of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now if you also I didn't bring it out but if you go back and read John 1 you'll see that John the Baptist was sent to Bear witness of the light yeah even John knew that was a light and if John was the first Forerunner at the first coming of Christ send to Bear witness of the light then at the second Forerunner that would come at the second coming of Christ it would be another prophet he would also have to bear witness of the light this is why that Forerunner tells John hello tells John in the Book of Revelation don't worship me worship God I know you'll find a lot of people out there that take this message and do some crazy things with it don't let that be the reason why you sto believing the message people did crazy things in Jesus day that's the TR you're going to always have Fanatics doing something that's off the word but you know this church ain't doing that amen the word was made flesh dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glor is of uh uh of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 8:12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall walk shall not walk in darkness but shall walk shall have the light of Life Jesus is the light this word amen that came out of God at the very beginning when he said let there be light that's in the word form the logos form but that took body down here and what happens is that all of is is passing through the Bible even when Jesus came there was promises in scripture a virgin had to conceive it was promises even from the book of Genesis that and the woman's seed the woman don't have no seed all that was coming through the Bible yes sir your representation was coming through the scripture yes sir and you got to be able to recognize him in the scripture the scriptures that are written for your day amen give me this quote that's over here on the right side and I hopefully I can read that pergan church age now then this word he is Left Behind on the printed pages is a part of him when you accepted by faith into a spirit filled life he said that his word was life John 663b but that is exactly what he is John 14:6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 89b If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart not just leave it in his heart it's in my heart that Ain where he said to leave it in your heart now take it out your heart put it somewhere on your lips place it is on the lips while that is the same what you mean this will take me when I'm looking like this and make me back to this that's the power and the transformation of the word come on somebody might they might have saw you as this and they still think you that way but you have come in contact with your representation Hallelujah when that woman came in contact she was no longer this woman anymore right amen she was a new woman yes sir with a new relationship with Christ never to go back to find another man again satisfied with Jesus hallah young people you got to get satisfied with Jesus old people you got to get satisfied with Jesus he is the word so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart places it upon us us while that's the same as did is speaking Every Mountain has to go and I Love This Promise Satan cannot stand before that man or woman Satan can't stand Oh Glory to God let me just read one more quote and I'm I'm coming home this is out of the identified Christ of all ages I I'm so glad that he sent down my representation see my I'm I'm blessed because I can hear hear and see that's what Jesus said you blessed because you can hear and that was his private Ministry the the P the he had just gave some Parables and and the uh disciples like what were you just saying I mean what what was that you just say say look let me explain something to y'all I say things in Parables to them so that the word might be fulfilled that they have eyes and can't see and ears and can't hear I do it that way intentionally I say things intentionally so it to go over their head but you when I get to you privately I begin to break these things down can I can I I'm going just you know did y'all no this yesterday when brother brother Troy preached he a read no quotes that was a public Ministry but [Applause] privately let me finish reading this identified Christ of all ages what if I'm speaking here to a person that would actually cannot receive it you actually cannot receive it there's nothing in him to receive it see the Pharisees were like that there was nothing in them guys to receive this actually from my understanding there's only one that had something in him like man this I don't know what this all about but I think there's something here his name Nicodemus actually cannot receive there's nothing in him to receive it the Bible said she that lives in pleasure is dead while she live while she's alive why was it those Pharisees look at Jesus all that we know he was a manifested word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch when he done the Messiah sign the Pharisees that had a little bit of light they was good people lived a good Christian Life or a good religious life had a a little light about them they had organized in a priesthood they had a little light but down in the bottom of their heart they had no Eternal representation in glory so when they seen that Supernatural done they said this man's be elab a devil and what happened look at this what happened that put what like they had out when they rejected the word for their day it actually put the little bit of light they had out but here was a little ill Fame woman a prostitute down in her heart well she had a representation of one of God's thoughts there she was waited in waited in sin but when she seen amen when she seen uh uh um uh that happened she said sir I believe you're a prophet I know when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things things what did he do he cleaned he cleansed her life he was a redeemer to her because he I like this he was a redeemer to her because he could lift her up where she come from remember the word was coming down yeah the word came from God and went back to God that's what Jesus said I come from God and I'm going back to God well the same thing with us we came from God and we're going back to God and in order for amen him to send down representation we had to have something on the inside of us that can identify right with him I don't care how dirty you was I don't care how filthy you was once the representation came it turned everything around he cleansed her life he was redeeming her because he he could lift her up up where she come from but this Pharisee think of religious as he could be and Jesus said you are of your father the devil and his works you'll do religious men belong to fine orders and Jesus called them Snakes in the Grass and Devils they rejected the light of the hour that's exactly what it was when they rejected the light of the hour their light went out so how how can you reject the light for your day and expect to live in the city where the lamb Israel light and we looking for that City whose building maker is God and we are on our way because we received the light if we can walk in the light now we can certainly live in the light then give me one more verse Psalms 119 130 watch this watch this watch this watch this the Bible says the entrance sir Psalms 119 and 130 130 130 the entrance of thy words how you going to get like yes sir sir how you going to walk in light how you going to live in light the entrance David said it the entrance I got to open up my heart to receive this word the entrance of thy words giveth light and what else what what what what does that light do I mean you know if if if I'm walking y'all ain't talking to me I'm I'm I'm leaving I'm leaving I'm getting out of here when it's dark you can't see nothing you don't know what's in that room the first thing you looking for is just a little bit of light because when you get light it just kind of get just settles you a little bit I can see this I ain't bumping into no tables and I ain't doing this and I and see when you get a little older see now y'all young people y'all can bump into the table right now and don't feel nothing older people just go to sleep and wake up with a pain and like I didn't do nothing I I did nothing but I got pain and I don't want to bump into nothing at night I got to have a night light [Music] night what y'all talk about no I I can't sleep with I need a nightlight you going to learn how to sleep with a nightlight that's it that's it I ain't stuffing my toe I ain't doing it's hard for me to recover yes I do but but the reason you want all of that is because it just kind of settles you sett come on now you feel a little bit more at ease a little bit more peaceful I can I can see where I'm going see the entrance of his words brings light not only that it giveth understanding I told you without light you can't do nothing how you going to understand the uhoh I'm in there now I'm I know you got you got people they they read the Bible but they don't understand what they reading they don't understand what they reading yeah they reading it but they have no understanding of it cuz the only way you're going to get understanding is that you first have to get amen yes sir you got to get light and light com through the manifestation of God's promised word for your day am exactly light came through John the Baptist light came through Moses light came through Noah the light is Jesus light came through Paul light came through brother brandom amen the entrance of God's words and that's the other thing you got to understand it's God's words coming through these gifts exactly Jes Jesus said a man I say says you know that my sheep hear my voice voice where the voice coming from The Voice is coming out of this servant actually Jesus voice was coming through me this morning I'm Not Jesus but his voice is still coming through me because I'm presenting his word and the entrance of thy words give us light it giveth understanding amen unto the simple who the simple people that can't explain the message like Peter couldn't explain the message what did he just say I I have no idea what he just said he said somebody eat flesh and drink blood I I I don't know nothing about what he's saying it's time to leave Peter well I I I don't know about that you done stepped off a little bit too far n i mean I mean he done he done reveal some other things to me now I done seen him uh cast Devils out I done seen I done seen the the the the the the the the lame walk the blind sea and dead rais and I got my own testimony too now [Music] yes you where you where where am I going to go yeah y'all must a heard my story you know who I am I'm the only one with the same testimony Jesus had Hallelujah do you know what happened we was in a boat the seeds got a little storing and and and brother Troy told us when when when when when when you get into a little h h h emergency you got to reach into your pocket and pull out your quarter and I reached into my pocket and I pull out my quarter I said Lord Lord stormy out here but I see you walking and if that be you out there walking if that's really you then B me to come come on somebody and Jesus looked at Peter he didn't give him a quote he didn't give him a scripture all he gave him was one word and that one word Peter had to move out on it by faith Peter I know it's a stor and SE but come praise God Come Peter Peter say I'm coming I don't know how I'm going get there but I'm coming because Jesus said come my see Peter putting one foot out on the water and one foot on the boat trying to hold on but Peter if you going to walk you got to let go that boat Peter go out there Peter Peter put another foot out look back at the disciples say I'm going because he told me to come and Peter begin to hey Hallelujah and you telling me to leave this man man I walked on water to whom shall I go only he has the words of eternal [Applause] life what denomination am I going to go back to this message
