[57:37] he went into the synagogue on the
[57:38] sabbath day and stood up for to read
[57:42] and there was delivered unto him
[57:45] the book of the prophet isaiah
[57:48] and when he had opened
[57:50] the book he found the place where it was
[57:53] written
[57:55] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[57:58] because he hath anointed me to preach
[58:00] the gospel to the poor
[58:03] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted

[58:12] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[58:16] to preach the acceptable year of
[58:19] the lord
[58:20] and he closed the book and he gave it
[58:24] again to the minister
[58:26] and sat down
[58:28] and the eyes of all them that were in
[58:30] the synagogue were fastened
[58:32] on him

[59:29] um
[59:31] we
[59:32] want to continue
[59:34] amen our journey
[59:36] uh with this thought
[59:38] aired
[59:40] in
[59:40] spirit
[59:42] amen aired in spirit
[59:44] um
[59:47] i um
[59:49] i just kind of gave you a a a little
[59:52] definition a man on last week on this
[59:56] word air
[59:58] is simply means to be
[1:00:01] mistaken
[1:00:03] or to be incorrect
[1:00:06] um to make a mistake
[1:00:09] amen that's that's all it means and uh
[1:00:11] everybody in here um
[1:00:15] has erred
[1:00:17] at some point in time in your life
[1:00:20] amen there's uh
[1:00:22] we all make mistakes
[1:00:24] we all can be incorrect
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] and and uh you know it's good just to
[1:00:30] admit when you made a mistake that's
[1:00:32] that's all god asked you to do you know
[1:00:35] just realize i made a mistake god and i
[1:00:37] need you and forgive me lord i'm sorry
[1:00:40] god amen and when you're apologizing to
[1:00:44] god you're you're not apologizing amen
[1:00:47] with the intention
[1:00:48] to leave and go do the same thing all
[1:00:50] over again
[1:00:51] amen when you realize you're wrong then
[1:00:54] you correct that wrong and and continue
[1:00:56] to do right amen from that that that
[1:00:59] point forward but to air is just to make
[1:01:02] a mistake to be incorrect uh uh on
[1:01:05] something so uh i wanted to just start
[1:01:08] us off with a little thought here
[1:01:11] from the sermon abraham's covenant
[1:01:14] confirmed amen just going to use
[1:01:17] this particular quote abraham's covenant
[1:01:19] confirmed
[1:01:21] brother branham makes this statement he
[1:01:23] says one more thing
[1:01:25] i want to get to the church
[1:01:28] amen and i said some of you sitting here
[1:01:32] lord jesus
[1:01:33] last night when the anointing struck me
[1:01:37] says i could feel them little flares in
[1:01:39] there
[1:01:40] i've been trying to think of it i jotted
[1:01:42] it down here so i wouldn't forget it
[1:01:45] i caught that last night that you think
[1:01:48] well i did do and uh i did so and so
[1:01:51] many times
[1:01:52] i find people won't even come in the
[1:01:56] prayer line
[1:01:57] and won't even take their number when
[1:01:59] they're called
[1:02:00] they're afraid
[1:02:02] that will be called up
[1:02:04] certain things so what he's saying here
[1:02:06] is that people have a prayer card
[1:02:08] uh in their hand you know it's difficult
[1:02:10] to get a prayer card you know it's a lot
[1:02:12] of people want to be prayed for and here
[1:02:14] you can be sitting there with a prayer
[1:02:16] card in your hand
[1:02:18] you have the opportunity to go before
[1:02:20] and and and and be prayed for by god's
[1:02:23] prophet just imagine that a a prayer
[1:02:26] that we know god hears god god gives
[1:02:28] visions to uh this man and i mean just
[1:02:31] so much anointing that people can feel
[1:02:33] the angel of the lord as they're walking
[1:02:35] through the prayer line and here you

[1:04:16] hallelujah so he says uh they're afraid
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:20] uh they will be called up certain things
[1:04:22] so they're thinking about things they
[1:04:24] mine i did this i did that i did then
[1:04:25] they're afraid that might be called out
[1:04:27] so they withdraw they don't go up into
[1:04:29] the prayer line
[1:04:30] hallelujah they won't go to the altar so
[1:04:33] now i used to blast that right out now
[1:04:35] look at this what the brandon said
[1:04:36] brother brandon said i used to blast
[1:04:37] that right out now somebody coming
[1:04:39] through the prayer line and they got a
[1:04:41] condition amen he said he used to blast
[1:04:44] it out now watch he says you all know
[1:04:46] that and not lest i'm actually led to do
[1:04:49] it i don't do that no more
[1:04:54] unless i'm led to do it i don't do that
[1:04:56] no more he just don't blast the
[1:04:58] situation out because see when a
[1:04:59] person's heir and they spirit you got to
[1:05:01] be able to try to help him
[1:05:05] look at this look at what he say now you
[1:05:06] will make your mistakes you say brother
[1:05:09] random no matter what i've what i'd ever
[1:05:11] do i'd never be worthy that's right
[1:05:14] you'll never be worthy he says but look
[1:05:17] you say brother branham at one time i
[1:05:19] didn't believe this message that's right
[1:05:21] i guess many of you didn't i wouldn't
[1:05:23] have done it i guess myself i couldn't
[1:05:25] have done it unless god revealed it to
[1:05:29] me
[1:05:30] oh glory to god unless god reveals to me
[1:05:32] says it's a revelation the whole church
[1:05:36] is built on revelation without the
[1:05:39] revelation you'll never see it you're
[1:05:41] blind
[1:05:42] amen jesus the church is built on
[1:05:44] revelation uh he says that the bible
[1:05:47] said i believe matthew 12 i believe it
[1:05:49] was it was uh where he said though jesus
[1:05:51] had done so many miracles before them
[1:05:54] yet they could not believe because
[1:05:57] isaiah said they got eyes and can't see
[1:06:00] ears and can't hear and and really holy
[1:06:03] people the very cream of holiness so
[1:06:05] holiness is not all he says holy
[1:06:08] living's not all faith is the main thing
[1:06:11] now he goes on and he keeps making a
[1:06:13] statement and this is just really
[1:06:14] something that blesses my heart says now
[1:06:17] listen church
[1:06:18] i want to drop this in there in here
[1:06:21] because i believe the holy spirit told
[1:06:23] me to do it you may be sitting there
[1:06:27] which some of you are i know you are he
[1:06:29] can detect he can discern right it says
[1:06:31] i know you are disagreeing with me right
[1:06:35] now
[1:06:36] now i can call your name if you want me
[1:06:39] to
[1:06:41] we talk about a real prophet
[1:06:43] i can call your name if you want me to
[1:06:46] so i know that but i also can see
[1:06:49] farther than that
[1:06:51] hallelujah that you're going to believe
[1:06:54] it one of these days
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:58] some point in time you gonna come to
[1:07:00] believe this so i have to watch my
[1:07:02] actions i have to watch what i say i
[1:07:06] have to watch how i respond to you cause
[1:07:08] some point in time that you're airing
[1:07:11] your spirit
[1:07:13] you're gonna come to an understanding
[1:07:16] oh glory to god
[1:07:19] hallelujah hallelujah it takes a lot not
[1:07:23] to say something sometimes
[1:07:25] it takes a lot to keep your mouth closed
[1:07:27] sometimes
[1:07:28] right brother diggs you know he he got
[1:07:31] it from this church and he go around the
[1:07:32] world talk about he got this new
[1:07:34] ministry

[1:07:39] amen we all need to practice in this new
[1:07:41] ministry
[1:07:43] what is this new mastery shut your mouth
[1:07:51] glory
[1:07:53] hallelujah hey
[1:07:57] you don't know what it feels sometimes
[1:07:59] as a pastor you see things you just be
[1:08:01] wanting to just say everything
[1:08:03] but then you just you just can't
[1:08:05] sometimes god just won't let you do it
[1:08:07] just won't let you do it hallelujah
[1:08:09] glory to god look at what brother
[1:08:10] branham said says i can he says uh uh i
[1:08:13] can call your name if you want me to so
[1:08:15] i know that but also can see further
[1:08:17] than that
[1:08:18] that you're going to believe it one of
[1:08:20] these days so i'm just going to put this
[1:08:22] in so you understand so i can give you a
[1:08:25] little spot of grace
[1:08:27] i want to put this in
[1:08:29] so you'll understand and i can give you
[1:08:32] a little spot of grace
[1:08:34] oh that's powerful
[1:08:35] amen i'm giving you grace by not saying
[1:08:38] something
[1:08:41] amen hallelujah i i can give you a
[1:08:43] little spot of grace here
[1:08:45] when it ain't going to be too long till
[1:08:47] you're going to change your mind
[1:08:50] i i i hope but we'll hold on to this you
[1:08:53] know i uh the more and more people out
[1:08:55] here walking away from this word and it
[1:08:57] just it just really bothers my spirit
[1:09:00] people you knew that believe
[1:09:02] and there's some of them out there they
[1:09:03] still believe
[1:09:06] oh lord they just they don't know how to
[1:09:09] come back pride is what stops people
[1:09:10] from coming back now don't add to it
[1:09:13] with your actions
[1:09:15] don't add to it
[1:09:16] just love the people
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] keep reaching out to them somehow just
[1:09:22] love them
[1:09:23] amen and look you're not there to try to
[1:09:25] you know change their mind and no no
[1:09:27] just love them just love them
[1:09:29] i'ma tell you one thing that i have
[1:09:31] noticed is that those that are staying
[1:09:33] with it they're able to still
[1:09:35] uh demonstrate love
[1:09:37] but typically when they walk away they
[1:09:39] actually don't want nothing to do with
[1:09:40] you
[1:09:41] you know why because light always shows
[1:09:44] up darkness
[1:09:46] praise the lord hey but i i i mean like
[1:09:49] brother branham said i can see somewhere
[1:09:51] down the line you're gonna come to this
[1:09:54] you're gonna understand this
[1:09:56] hallelujah you're gonna see it somewhere
[1:09:59] down the line
[1:10:00] i got the same kind of faith
[1:10:03] a true son of god and a true daughter of
[1:10:06] god they will come to it
[1:10:08] because they can't be lost
[1:10:10] that's a promise from almighty god
[1:10:13] no matter what you hear no matter what
[1:10:16] you see no matter what you experience
[1:10:18] god's word overrides all of that
[1:10:23] hallelujah
[1:10:25] you have erred in your spirit
[1:10:27] but you're coming to an understanding
[1:10:33] glory to god
[1:10:35] amen how you get there that ain't my
[1:10:37] that ain't that ain't me i don't make
[1:10:38] the way god do that
[1:10:40] amen look at what he said here he says
[1:10:43] uh
[1:10:43] amen um
[1:10:45] my says it says uh a little grace here a
[1:10:49] little spot of grace here when it ain't
[1:10:50] gonna be too long till you're gonna
[1:10:52] change your mind some of you some of you
[1:10:54] won't
[1:10:57] now which one are you leaning to i'm
[1:10:59] gonna take the one some of you will
[1:11:01] i'm putting my family in that some of
[1:11:03] you will
[1:11:07] hey man some of you won't but remember
[1:11:09] when sarah first heard that man
[1:11:12] where she is the type of the church when
[1:11:14] she heard that seeing that sign take
[1:11:17] place to abraham she actually laughed
[1:11:19] about it
[1:11:20] in her heart
[1:11:21] now i love the way he just brought that
[1:11:22] that type in sarah laughed and y'all
[1:11:25] might have some stairs in your life
[1:11:27] that's laughing
[1:11:28] but when you go to hebrews 11 11
[1:11:32] sarah
[1:11:33] had faith
[1:11:34] and her name was written in the in in in
[1:11:37] the in the hall of fame of faith
[1:11:40] right hallelujah somewhere down the line
[1:11:42] something clicked and sarah
[1:11:44] something changed himself now the bible
[1:11:47] never recorded when it happened
[1:11:49] but we know for her to get faith to
[1:11:51] believe god not just depending on
[1:11:53] abraham's faith
[1:11:54] oh i like that
[1:11:56] brother and sister i'm not just standing
[1:11:58] on mama's faith and i'm not just
[1:12:00] standing on body's faith i'm not
[1:12:02] standing on pastors fake but i got my
[1:12:05] own faith
[1:12:06] my own experience with god
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:12] something clicked somewhere down the
[1:12:14] line with sarah
[1:12:16] and she came to her own faith and that's
[1:12:18] why you know she believed that she can
[1:12:19] conceive even at an old age at first she
[1:12:22] laughed at the promise
[1:12:24] but at some point in time she came to
[1:12:25] believe it
[1:12:27] some might be laughing at this message
[1:12:30] but somewhere down the line they're
[1:12:31] going to come to believe it
[1:12:33] all right all right all right she
[1:12:35] actually laughed about in her heart and
[1:12:36] she disbelieved and doubted it ever
[1:12:39] being so is that right at that time god
[1:12:41] would have rubbed her name off is that
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:43] he couldn't
[1:12:46] he couldn't
[1:12:47] because she's part of abraham and the
[1:12:50] prophets say they're one woo what a
[1:12:52] promise
[1:12:54] what a promise
[1:12:55] bro i i i have had you know different
[1:12:58] ones and i'm a
[1:13:00] oh i'm gonna keep reading in this
[1:13:03] let me go to this next paragraph i i had
[1:13:05] different ones
[1:13:06] um have approached me about
[1:13:08] just some of my loved ones and they just
[1:13:10] man they just they just put my almost
[1:13:13] put my family in hell
[1:13:17] like there was no hope at all
[1:13:19] i said look you don't understand you're
[1:13:20] just dealing with a spirit
[1:13:23] that's all you and and when you're
[1:13:25] dealing with a spirit you can't use
[1:13:27] natural means
[1:13:29] to try to overcome a spirit
[1:13:31] but natural meanings have a argument all
[1:13:33] the time
[1:13:36] no that ain't gonna that ain't gonna
[1:13:37] hurt that ain't gonna help nobody that's
[1:13:38] only gonna hurt people that actually
[1:13:40] cause them to do more damage in on the
[1:13:43] inside right but but you're not going to
[1:13:45] take a promise from me
[1:13:47] if god gave me this i'm going to say
[1:13:49] what his words say
[1:13:50] no matter what your feelings are
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:53] right
[1:13:54] right so so but but but i've seen it
[1:13:56] like no no no no lord lord knows it's
[1:13:58] the truth people don't realize when
[1:14:00] you're dealing with a spirit you got to
[1:14:01] use love
[1:14:03] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:14:04] brother branham
[1:14:05] you know had this this little brother
[1:14:07] come to him say
[1:14:09] my wife got spirits
[1:14:11] and he actually he called them by name
[1:14:13] one named jeff
[1:14:15] one named seth and one named this he
[1:14:17] knew this he knew the names of the
[1:14:19] spirits
[1:14:20] he said they got this and they got that
[1:14:22] and you know she be picking at me when i
[1:14:23] go to church and you know she oh i
[1:14:25] thought you know you did issues with
[1:14:26] them holy rollers again and she'd just
[1:14:28] be going on and said i just get tired
[1:14:30] experience so i jumped up one time
[1:14:32] brother branham and i laid hands on him
[1:14:34] come out of her in the name of jesus i
[1:14:36] call them spirits out say they never
[1:14:38] came out he said that's cause you're
[1:14:39] using the wrong method
[1:14:44] if you want the spirits to come out
[1:14:45] you're gonna have to show some love to
[1:14:46] her
[1:14:51] you know you know brother branham you
[1:14:52] know used it both sides because for
[1:14:55] a wife that's trying to win a husband he
[1:14:57] have to she have to show love brother
[1:14:59] branham to give him advice try to cook
[1:15:00] his favorite pie
[1:15:02] kind of try to do this and try to do
[1:15:03] that and and watch how that spirit just
[1:15:05] come on out of your husband he's saying
[1:15:07] say what your what your wife like to do
[1:15:09] try to find out what she like to do and
[1:15:10] do that for her
[1:15:11] and before you know it the lady was
[1:15:13] delivered
[1:15:16] right but you got to use love you're
[1:15:18] using the wrong tactics
[1:15:21] that's why they're still in bondage
[1:15:22] you're using the wrong tactic
[1:15:24] use some love
[1:15:26] love love
[1:15:29] and i'ma tell you it's hard sometime to
[1:15:31] use that kind of love but the love that
[1:15:33] is seen you is the love that was in god
[1:15:36] for god so love
[1:15:39] the world that he gave
[1:15:42] praise god he gave his life on the cross
[1:15:46] that's the type of love that is inside
[1:15:48] of us
[1:15:51] [Applause]
[1:16:01] he says if you've if you've really not
[1:16:04] been excited
[1:16:06] not worked up in emotion
[1:16:08] not got some church creed but really
[1:16:11] received the holy ghost
[1:16:12] you're a part you're really a part of
[1:16:15] christ
[1:16:16] oh my
[1:16:17] and a little and still a little skeptic
[1:16:19] in your mind
[1:16:21] you will not sh
[1:16:22] oh i love this god
[1:16:24] will not
[1:16:26] shove you off from that because he can't
[1:16:29] you're part of christ
[1:16:32] you know i've even heard people say some
[1:16:34] people don't went cross the line
[1:16:37] you know what they say some of them went
[1:16:38] crosstalk and they can't get back now i
[1:16:40] don't know which i don't know where your
[1:16:41] line is
[1:16:45] but i don't i don't only god knows
[1:16:49] who can go across the line who came
[1:16:52] rather from what i read in scripture
[1:16:55] there was a there was a king
[1:16:58] amen in the scripture that that was
[1:17:00] responsible for throwing the prophet
[1:17:02] isaiah in half
[1:17:06] you talk about somebody across the line
[1:17:08] that man should have crossed you saw the
[1:17:11] prophet in half
[1:17:13] but later on the man repented and god
[1:17:15] forgave him of his sins
[1:17:17] so i don't know where the line is that
[1:17:19] people draw to say you cross the line
[1:17:22] maybe when they hurt your feelings they
[1:17:23] cross the line
[1:17:29] well that ain't the way it worked you
[1:17:30] know it's god that establishes the line
[1:17:33] what we do is keep preaching the gospel
[1:17:35] throwing out a net trying to grab
[1:17:37] somebody
[1:17:39] i don't want to see nobody lost
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:46] look at this it says you're really part
[1:17:48] of christ a little a little still a
[1:17:49] little skeptic in your mind god will not
[1:17:51] show you god will not shove you off from
[1:17:54] that
[1:17:55] because he can't you're part of christ
[1:17:58] he will bring you to the truth
[1:18:02] amen if you uh you might you you might
[1:18:05] have spoken tongues danced in the spirit
[1:18:07] and then all these things there that
[1:18:09] don't mean you got the holy ghost oh my
[1:18:12] that's a million miles from it jesus
[1:18:14] never did say now remember i believe
[1:18:17] that when you receive the fullness of
[1:18:18] the holy ghost you speak in tongues
[1:18:20] right but jesus never did there's no
[1:18:22] scripture in the bible says that the
[1:18:24] evidence of the holy ghost i want you to
[1:18:25] produce it if it is there's no such
[1:18:27] scriptures that scriptures that jesus
[1:18:29] said by their fruit
[1:18:32] you shall know them and the fruit of the
[1:18:34] spirit is not speaking in tongues amen
[1:18:37] that's a gift of the holy ghost
[1:18:41] hallelujah after the holy ghost has come
[1:18:44] that's one of the gifts that goes with
[1:18:46] him
[1:18:47] preaching speaking in tongues
[1:18:49] interpretation talks all those things
[1:18:51] are gifts of the holy ghost but what we
[1:18:54] want to see is the manifestations of the
[1:18:55] fruits of the spirit
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:02] how would they know that we're
[1:19:03] christians
[1:19:04] by our love
[1:19:06] now i was saying this on last week and i
[1:19:08] just wanted to kind of go into a little
[1:19:10] deeper here i'm
[1:19:11] uh we're triumph beings
[1:19:14] we're made up of body
[1:19:16] uh spirit and soul
[1:19:19] and our body is controlled by
[1:19:22] five senses what we see
[1:19:25] what we taste
[1:19:26] what we feel what we smell what we hear
[1:19:29] that's what controls or dominates the
[1:19:31] body
[1:19:32] amen you get different reactions from
[1:19:34] your body based on what you see
[1:19:37] hallelujah what you taste can also
[1:19:39] generate a certain reaction from the
[1:19:41] body
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] what you feel hey man you hit your your
[1:19:46] your your your finger with a hammer
[1:19:49] your body will the rest of your body
[1:19:51] feel it too and it will it will show
[1:19:54] a man what you what you smell generates
[1:19:56] certain responses and what you hear also
[1:19:58] generate certain things
[1:20:00] all right but uh uh i'ma go to your
[1:20:02] spirit amen uh that's controlled by
[1:20:06] things inside amen these are inner
[1:20:09] things and it's five senses there to
[1:20:11] your spirit it's your conscience
[1:20:13] it's your imagination
[1:20:15] it's your memory it's your affections
[1:20:18] and it's your reasoning amen and then
[1:20:20] this last part of your being the soul is
[1:20:23] controlled by either doubt or faith
[1:20:26] right only two two two two things there
[1:20:28] to control you the doubt of faith uh
[1:20:30] since we're talking about airing in the
[1:20:32] spirit
[1:20:33] let's look at the spirit part
[1:20:36] amen remember it's your conscience your
[1:20:38] imaginations your memory affections and
[1:20:41] reasoning now your conscience is what we
[1:20:43] call a inner feeling right amen or
[1:20:48] a inner voice
[1:20:50] right uh
[1:20:52] viewed as acting as a guide to the
[1:20:54] rightness or wrongness of one's behavior
[1:20:58] amen you have a conscience that's either
[1:21:00] tells you that's right or conscious said
[1:21:02] now you know you're wrong
[1:21:04] now some of us we know we're wrong and
[1:21:06] we're going to do it anyway and here's
[1:21:08] the other part that that that that just
[1:21:10] gets me you know you're wrong go do it
[1:21:13] anyway and then pray and ask god to
[1:21:15] forgive you
[1:21:17] you just want to say really come on now
[1:21:19] you you know you're wrong don't get
[1:21:21] don't keep going wrong if you know
[1:21:22] you're wrong stop somewhere make the
[1:21:25] thing right but everybody got a
[1:21:27] conscience let's say you're wrong now
[1:21:28] you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong
[1:21:31] now what happens like like this one man
[1:21:33] said he told brother branham and said
[1:21:34] that council's got like four points on
[1:21:36] it
[1:21:37] he said every time you do something
[1:21:38] wrong the importance just turn
[1:21:40] they just turn and so you can feel it on
[1:21:42] the inside and there's a certain feeling
[1:21:44] that just come over you it's it's hard
[1:21:46] to explain it but everybody doesn't had
[1:21:49] it
[1:21:49] it just
[1:21:50] you learn
[1:21:53] and you feel it and if something you say
[1:21:55] make that thing right but some say no
[1:21:57] don't you make that right you're going
[1:21:58] to get in more trouble
[1:21:59] right i mean but you just feel that
[1:22:01] thing turning and then eventually it
[1:22:03] just stopped turning
[1:22:05] and you don't you don't work yourself to
[1:22:06] a little situation where you don't feel
[1:22:08] the conscious anymore now you can lie
[1:22:11] and even believe your own lies
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:17] right amen but that's what happened when
[1:22:19] you ignore that conscience hallelujah so
[1:22:22] so brother branham say uh you know
[1:22:24] conscience is one of those things that
[1:22:25] control the spirit the other thing is
[1:22:27] imaginations
[1:22:28] amen and what the imagination is it's
[1:22:30] the process
[1:22:32] of producing mental images
[1:22:36] your imagination actually produces a
[1:22:38] mental image you know
[1:22:40] now just i remember uh brother brother
[1:22:42] gatson came to preach for us some years
[1:22:44] ago and he was talking about how he
[1:22:46] would drive down a certain street
[1:22:48] and because of one experience one time
[1:22:50] he was driving down the street and he he
[1:22:52] hit a deer you know late at night coming
[1:22:54] across the street he hit a deer and uh
[1:22:56] and because he had that experience
[1:22:59] every time he drove that street he
[1:23:02] always thought i'm gonna hit another
[1:23:04] deer he preached fear the deer or
[1:23:07] something like that
[1:23:08] and he he just i said i'ma just i'ma
[1:23:10] just i'ma hit another deer and before
[1:23:12] you know it he get to the same spot
[1:23:15] every time with a new car he hit another
[1:23:18] deer
[1:23:21] and he didn't realize it but his
[1:23:22] imagination
[1:23:24] was producing
[1:23:27] producing the deer do you know your
[1:23:30] fears can produce certain things
[1:23:32] i believe the bible say the things that
[1:23:34] we most feared have come upon us
[1:23:37] right our imagination produced it
[1:23:41] that's why you need to think on things
[1:23:43] that are lovely
[1:23:44] think of things that are pure
[1:23:46] think of things that have good report
[1:23:48] if there be any virtue and if there be
[1:23:52] any praise
[1:23:54] think on these things
[1:23:58] your imagination can affect the way that
[1:24:00] you act
[1:24:03] this other one is it's memory
[1:24:06] memory amen is the faculty by which the
[1:24:09] mind stores
[1:24:11] and remembers information
[1:24:14] the memory is the factory by which the
[1:24:16] mind stores and remembers information
[1:24:18] now you know sometimes you got to be
[1:24:20] careful with your memory
[1:24:22] now you you know you you're going to
[1:24:23] remember some things but there's some
[1:24:25] things you want to ask god to just kind
[1:24:26] of take from your memory
[1:24:30] hallelujah you you got us lord lord
[1:24:32] deliver me from that thought right there
[1:24:35] holly you don't want the devil keep
[1:24:36] taking you back
[1:24:38] in your memories
[1:24:40] that's why i'm very uh
[1:24:42] uh uh cautious about you know i if it's
[1:24:46] if it's me i'm just talking about me
[1:24:47] y'all can do whatever y'all want to do
[1:24:48] but it's me if god delivered me from a
[1:24:51] certain position in life
[1:24:53] and maybe i had pictures of what i used
[1:24:56] to be back there
[1:24:57] and then rather than show people what
[1:24:59] god has done
[1:25:01] you show god you show people what what
[1:25:03] what you used to be
[1:25:05] no don't give them a picture what you
[1:25:07] used to be tear those pictures up
[1:25:10] destroy those pictures because that was
[1:25:13] not the real you
[1:25:15] the real you is this holy sanctified
[1:25:17] person
[1:25:19] hallelujah amen and sometimes we think
[1:25:21] well i'ma just kind of show people where
[1:25:22] god brought me from are you really
[1:25:24] showing them who have you witnessed to
[1:25:26] with that picture
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:32] amen so so so memory amen is this
[1:25:35] faculty which demands stores and
[1:25:37] remembers information
[1:25:39] the affections
[1:25:41] is fondness
[1:25:43] love
[1:25:44] liking
[1:25:45] tenderness warmth
[1:25:47] devotion
[1:25:48] endearment care caring attachment
[1:25:51] friendship warm feelings now i had to
[1:25:54] bring that warm feelings at the end
[1:25:56] because all of us want these fuzzy
[1:25:58] feelings
[1:26:00] everybody's looking for warm feelings
[1:26:02] when they're involved in certain
[1:26:03] situations they're looking for a warm
[1:26:04] feeling your warm feelings could
[1:26:05] actually be the wrong feelings
[1:26:08] hallelujah
[1:26:10] somebody
[1:26:12] amen yo yo yo warm feeling that you
[1:26:15] feeling amen might not be the right
[1:26:17] thing it might not be according to the
[1:26:18] word of god
[1:26:20] amen i saw him and i had warm feelings
[1:26:23] but he ain't saved
[1:26:25] he ain't a christian
[1:26:27] he he ain't ain't thinking about knowing
[1:26:28] the lord and you talk about you got one
[1:26:30] feeling something the devil is trying to
[1:26:32] trick your feelings
[1:26:35] same thing with the young man well i
[1:26:37] think i can win her to the lord
[1:26:41] that that never have you out there so
[1:26:43] far you know you're trying to figure out
[1:26:44] how you got there because you was trying
[1:26:46] to win somebody so let them already be
[1:26:48] one to the lord before you mess with
[1:26:50] them
[1:26:52] but i just felt some warm feelings
[1:26:56] it's the devil tricking you
[1:26:58] amen amen that's affections right so so
[1:27:01] here in this this last one is reasoning
[1:27:04] the action of thinking about something
[1:27:06] in a logical
[1:27:07] sensible way
[1:27:09] right and uh and what we find from
[1:27:11] brother brandon tell us reasoning is
[1:27:13] god's biggest enemy
[1:27:15] right don't think about things from a
[1:27:17] logical sensible way when when you know
[1:27:19] when the children of israel were asked
[1:27:21] to go and march around the walls of
[1:27:22] jericho that was logical
[1:27:24] that was not logical it wasn't sensible
[1:27:26] at all but but when they did things in
[1:27:29] obedience they sought a supernatural
[1:27:31] miracle-working power of god
[1:27:34] so don't depend on your reasoning
[1:27:37] hallelujah glory to god these things can
[1:27:40] actually affect your spirit your
[1:27:42] conscience your imaginations your memory
[1:27:46] your affections your reasoning these are
[1:27:48] things that can affect your spirit
[1:27:51] now
[1:27:52] uh let me see here there's another
[1:27:55] little
[1:27:56] statement that i want to make here
[1:27:58] oh my let's go back to isaiah 29
[1:28:05] oh yes lord isaiah 29
[1:28:07] i read this this is where our thought
[1:28:09] kind of comes from
[1:28:11] amen out of this particular passage of
[1:28:13] scripture
[1:28:15] isaiah 29 and i'm reading at verse 22
[1:28:19] it says
[1:28:21] therefore
[1:28:24] thus saith the lord
[1:28:26] who redeemed abraham
[1:28:29] concerning the house of jacob
[1:28:31] jacob shall
[1:28:33] not not now be ashamed neither shall his
[1:28:36] face now wax pale
[1:28:38] but when he seeth his children i love
[1:28:41] this when he sees his children
[1:28:45] the work of mine hands
[1:28:48] in the midst of him
[1:28:50] glory i just put myself in this right
[1:28:52] amen but when he sees his children the
[1:28:54] work of mine has in the midst of him
[1:28:56] they shall sanctify my name
[1:29:00] and shall sanctify the holy one of jacob
[1:29:03] and shall fear the god of israel look at
[1:29:06] this they also that aired
[1:29:10] in spirit that meant somebody was going
[1:29:12] to make a mistake
[1:29:14] but they also that heir in spirit shall
[1:29:18] come
[1:29:19] to understanding amen and they that
[1:29:22] murmured
[1:29:23] shall
[1:29:24] learn doctrine
[1:29:27] what a promise from god
[1:29:29] right and here you know i just want to
[1:29:31] uh uh just
[1:29:33] just another definition here i'm using
[1:29:35] um the strong concordance on this one uh
[1:29:38] to air is to wander
[1:29:41] uh to go astray
[1:29:43] also means to stagger
[1:29:45] right it can mean to wand about
[1:29:47] physically
[1:29:48] amen it's the wandering of the mind
[1:29:51] hallelujah as soon as you start going to
[1:29:53] a website to start reading certain
[1:29:56] information your mind has already begun
[1:29:58] to wonder
[1:30:00] glory to god and let me tell you
[1:30:01] something when you start feeding on it
[1:30:03] and you keep going back and you keep
[1:30:05] going back there's something else taking
[1:30:07] place on the inside that you don't even
[1:30:09] realize
[1:30:11] when you start entertaining people
[1:30:13] letting people come to your house
[1:30:15] to talk to you about what they believe
[1:30:18] hallelujah uh if they got if they got so
[1:30:20] much to say
[1:30:21] have them meet you with your pastor
[1:30:27] oh
[1:30:28] i i can just tell you right now i know
[1:30:30] many people that are erred in the spirit
[1:30:33] hallelujah because you know oftentimes
[1:30:35] when we when we say to say i've been
[1:30:37] studying it
[1:30:38] for two years that's the key word right
[1:30:41] there when you say that studying for two
[1:30:43] years that let me know you started you
[1:30:45] started out wrong you never got your
[1:30:47] pastor involved until you already made
[1:30:49] your decision
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] oh i can go further with that
[1:30:56] you know one time in jeremiah's day they
[1:30:59] told him saying jeremiah go pray for us
[1:31:01] they brought it to the pastor
[1:31:03] they brought it to jeremiah he you know
[1:31:04] he's a passage go pray for us we want to
[1:31:06] know the will of god as to what we
[1:31:08] should do about this is what we should
[1:31:09] do about that jeremiah said okay now i'm
[1:31:11] gonna give you the will of god but y'all
[1:31:13] wait don't make no decision till i get
[1:31:14] back took him 10 days to hear from god
[1:31:16] god don't speak the way people say he
[1:31:18] speak
[1:31:20] people say they pray and then in two
[1:31:22] minutes they got an answer
[1:31:23] god don't speak that fast sometimes you
[1:31:25] gotta wait it out
[1:31:28] here jerry jeremiah went 10 days 10 days
[1:31:30] later jared come back jeremiah come back
[1:31:32] say now this is what the lord told me
[1:31:34] y'all don't do this don't do that don't
[1:31:35] do this and god gonna bless you they say
[1:31:37] uh jeremiah we thank you speaking from
[1:31:39] the devil so you know you know that
[1:31:41] didn't come from the lord that came from
[1:31:43] that's your flesh that's your feelings
[1:31:44] jeremiah that's the way we feel about
[1:31:46] and we're going to go do what we want to
[1:31:47] do jeremiah see you know what before i
[1:31:49] even pray y'all have already dissembled
[1:31:53] in your hearts so really the praying
[1:31:55] about it was just a
[1:31:59] a formality
[1:32:02] and this is what's happened in church
[1:32:03] you know oh lord have mercy
[1:32:06] my my wife told me something i'm getting
[1:32:08] ready to bring it out i wasn't thinking
[1:32:09] about bringing it out here dude but i i
[1:32:11] think it's gonna fit right here
[1:32:13] it's gonna fit right here it's gonna fit
[1:32:15] i one thing about this
[1:32:17] somebody was talking to my wife and
[1:32:20] and they had a friend that said um
[1:32:23] they met a man they want to live with
[1:32:24] this man christian going to church every
[1:32:27] sunday
[1:32:28] so no i you know i met this guy out of
[1:32:31] nowhere say i want to go i'm going to
[1:32:32] live with him so you know they didn't
[1:32:34] tell nobody what they was doing they
[1:32:36] waited waited and then finally went to
[1:32:38] the friend said you know what i want to
[1:32:39] let you know i met this guy and you know
[1:32:41] and i'm living with him so you living
[1:32:43] with him
[1:32:45] she said but i prayed about it
[1:32:48] she said you prayed about it say what
[1:32:50] you trying to tell me is that you prayed
[1:32:52] and god said this word for you not to do
[1:32:54] that but since you prayed god changed
[1:32:57] your mind just for you
[1:33:01] no see you had already decembered in
[1:33:03] your heart as to what you was gonna do
[1:33:06] hallelujah glory to god so just don't
[1:33:09] use the formal words i prayed about it
[1:33:12] that's just the formality we talked
[1:33:14] about did you sincerely pray and not
[1:33:16] only did you pray did you hear from god
[1:33:22] because you ain't heard from god maybe
[1:33:25] maybe this might be a mistake
[1:33:28] can i go a little further aries to
[1:33:30] wander go astray stagger
[1:33:33] uh misleads
[1:33:36] mentally and morally air is to mislead
[1:33:38] mentally and morally it's the wandering
[1:33:41] of the mind
[1:33:43] and when the scripture talks about they
[1:33:44] they murmur means that they they
[1:33:47] whispered
[1:33:49] now whispering's what take place you
[1:33:51] know nobody else don't hear it you just
[1:33:53] kind of telling me between one of you
[1:33:55] you and another person but but god hear
[1:33:57] your whispers
[1:33:59] god hear your murmuring god hear your
[1:34:02] complaining god hear all of that and you
[1:34:05] don't realize you know hallelujah to the
[1:34:07] lamb of god you know you don't realize
[1:34:09] sometimes something might be sad to try
[1:34:11] to help prevent you from making some
[1:34:13] mistakes
[1:34:15] all right
[1:34:16] i mean murmuring is backbiting
[1:34:19] glory to god that's what murmuring and
[1:34:21] everything is now i want to i want to
[1:34:23] just bring in a little
[1:34:24] little thought here because you know we
[1:34:26] can wander we can stray away we can do
[1:34:28] things like that here this message
[1:34:30] testimony testimony look at this now
[1:34:35] oh help us lord
[1:34:38] all right here the prophet says this
[1:34:41] i understand this is a somebody in the
[1:34:43] prayer line says i understand
[1:34:46] yes tomb is that right
[1:34:48] now now you believe let's bow our heads
[1:34:50] it says our heavenly father
[1:34:52] be merciful to this poor woman grant
[1:34:54] lord that she may be healed of this
[1:34:56] tumor
[1:34:57] and i ask you to be merciful granted
[1:34:59] that that that uh that here she's to
[1:35:02] have it removed maybe to die in the
[1:35:04] operation but thou art here father to
[1:35:07] remove it for her
[1:35:09] take all this from her help her now to
[1:35:11] be healed in the name of thy son
[1:35:14] jesus amen
[1:35:16] now here the prophet pray says it just
[1:35:18] don't leave now he prayed now he know
[1:35:20] not not even cancer supposed to stand
[1:35:23] before his prayer so he said it just
[1:35:25] don't leave just a moment it didn't
[1:35:27] leave her see you see it running on my
[1:35:29] hand like that
[1:35:30] satan in the name of the lord jesus come
[1:35:32] out from that from the woman
[1:35:34] it seems to hold
[1:35:36] everybody just keep your hands bound i
[1:35:38] want to talk to you
[1:35:39] now look at me
[1:35:41] do you live far
[1:35:43] not very far there's something the tomb
[1:35:45] is making an act some way
[1:35:48] but there's something causing it to keep
[1:35:50] it from leaving
[1:35:51] you believe me to be a person that's
[1:35:53] to work hard in life says that's that's
[1:35:56] what it is you you know that you know
[1:35:58] what you know that's right sister
[1:36:00] and now now what happened in between
[1:36:02] these these two sentences here brother
[1:36:04] branham revealed to this lady now he
[1:36:05] didn't call it out loud
[1:36:07] see remember i read the quote they say
[1:36:09] he don't do that no more
[1:36:11] only when the spirit lead them now when
[1:36:13] the spirit let him one time he had told
[1:36:14] some people saying now don't come up
[1:36:15] here with your sin don't come up here if
[1:36:17] you got city life don't come up here
[1:36:18] don't do that don't do don't come to the
[1:36:20] spread line with cindy like so this one
[1:36:22] lady you know she went up there and she
[1:36:24] had sent her life she she was prayed for
[1:36:26] and and brother brown i'm saying now um
[1:36:29] sister um
[1:36:30] um the reason you can't get heal is
[1:36:32] because you cheated on your husband you
[1:36:34] need to go make that right he called it
[1:36:35] out loud in front of everybody and the
[1:36:37] husband got upset
[1:36:39] he said
[1:36:41] no she didn't
[1:36:43] he got up out of his seat walked up to
[1:36:46] the prayer line like he was somebody
[1:36:50] you did what brother brown said i told
[1:36:53] you
[1:36:54] don't come up here if you ain't repented
[1:36:56] from your sin
[1:36:58] sir
[1:37:00] you just did the same thing to your wife
[1:37:05] both of them exposed just like that mac
[1:37:07] just gonna make things right and go back
[1:37:09] home
[1:37:11] so sometimes you had to get you know he
[1:37:13] had to do it that way but for the most
[1:37:14] part he'd just speak to you privately
[1:37:16] now that's what he's just done with this
[1:37:17] woman spoke to her probably now watching
[1:37:19] this you know that's right sister but
[1:37:21] you've had a desire to do that recently
[1:37:23] more than ever in the last two or three
[1:37:25] weeks you have you've been praying about
[1:37:27] that asking god if he take you back
[1:37:30] isn't that right one time you tried to
[1:37:33] commit suicide
[1:37:34] isn't that right that's right but now
[1:37:36] you've gotten away this thing's come to
[1:37:39] bring you back to the lord isn't that
[1:37:41] true i'm not reading your mind but i'm
[1:37:44] seeing a vision i want y'all to catch
[1:37:46] that sometimes things will be allowed to
[1:37:49] come into a person's life
[1:37:52] to bring them back to the lord
[1:37:55] i know quickly we want to just pray we
[1:37:57] don't want to see nobody suffer but
[1:37:59] before you pray just ask god lord are
[1:38:01] you using this
[1:38:03] are you using this in order to bring
[1:38:04] this person back to where they need to
[1:38:06] be
[1:38:10] glory to god amen it sounds cruel but
[1:38:13] sometimes that's the only way god can
[1:38:14] get your attention
[1:38:17] amen it's the truth anyhow that's
[1:38:19] sometimes that's the only way god can
[1:38:20] get you to stop and listen is when
[1:38:22] disasters strike you
[1:38:25] that's when desperation kicks in that's
[1:38:27] when you start realizing there's a god
[1:38:31] hallelujah
[1:38:32] you know some some one guy was telling
[1:38:34] me not not to say that as a joke but you
[1:38:36] know he said he didn't believe in god
[1:38:38] he didn't believe in god he believed in
[1:38:40] god at all
[1:38:41] and
[1:38:42] um and so
[1:38:45] he got into a situation where they say
[1:38:47] now he was out there hurting some cows
[1:38:49] they had to put put a rope around his
[1:38:51] finger saying that don't put that rope
[1:38:52] around your finger
[1:38:54] and try to pull that clap that cow that
[1:38:56] cow will take your fingers off

[1:39:00] listen none of that he put that rope
[1:39:02] around the finger
[1:39:04] and that cow took off
[1:39:05] and he yelled oh god they looked at him
[1:39:08] say hey i thought you believe in god
[1:39:11] see i'm gonna tell you there's times
[1:39:14] there's times and situations
[1:39:16] that occur in life
[1:39:18] i don't care what people are doing i
[1:39:20] don't care what they say god got a way
[1:39:21] of allowing certain things to come into
[1:39:23] their life
[1:39:27] where they come back to the knowledge of
[1:39:29] truth and understanding

[1:41:55] what she done when she was a little girl

[1:42:01] knew god and wanted away from god and
[1:42:03] how it's about two weeks ago how she
[1:42:06] wanted to ask god try to get tried to
[1:42:08] pray and get back she never even come
[1:42:11] back to the full realization of christ
[1:42:14] till just now
[1:42:17] it would not leave her
[1:42:19] until first that was revealed to her and
[1:42:21] told to her then it left her
[1:42:24] and the tumor died and went away i just
[1:42:27] loved the way that worked
[1:42:29] here satan thought he had one under
[1:42:31] captivity
[1:42:32] but see once the revelation came forth
[1:42:34] then she was really free
[1:42:38] hallelujah
[1:42:39] then it left him and and
[1:42:41] the two men died and went away friends
[1:42:43] the almighty
[1:42:44] is here
[1:42:45] in his person
[1:42:47] jesus picked up
[1:42:50] isaiah and let's turn isaiah 61 this is
[1:42:53] what he picked up to read
[1:42:56] it was handed to him
[1:42:58] he turned in
[1:43:00] and isaiah and he found this and he
[1:43:02] picked it up
[1:43:03] isaiah 61.
[1:43:06] now
[1:43:09] we'll see a few different things here
[1:43:11] than with them than we see in luke 4
[1:43:14] but nonetheless
[1:43:16] when jesus picked it up that day he was
[1:43:18] the scripture was being fulfilled
[1:43:20] here in isaiah 61 it says the spirit
[1:43:24] of the lord god is upon me isaiah
[1:43:26] prophesying
[1:43:28] because the lord hath anointed me
[1:43:32] to preach good tidings unto the meek
[1:43:36] now
[1:43:36] um and then jesus didn't use those same
[1:43:40] words in in luke 4. but i i want to just
[1:43:43] kind of break this down it's preaching
[1:43:45] good tidings to the meek and what meek
[1:43:48] is defined is mild
[1:43:51] in temper
[1:43:52] and mild
[1:43:54] in manners it also means to be
[1:43:57] submissive
[1:44:00] so so so so so uh in order to bring
[1:44:04] a man to preach good tidings unto the
[1:44:06] meek
[1:44:08] somebody's gonna have to submit
[1:44:10] themselves
[1:44:12] to the authority of almighty god
[1:44:18] hallelujah amen this did this word meek
[1:44:21] means to be submissive
[1:44:24] hallelujah now now be careful
[1:44:27] you know uh uh we all got to learn how
[1:44:29] to submit to god
[1:44:31] amen and even even in our marriages amen
[1:44:33] there's still a level of submission that
[1:44:35] has to happen there too
[1:44:37] wives have to submit themselves unto
[1:44:39] their husbands
[1:44:40] hallelujah amen it's the truth anyhow
[1:44:43] church right but but when we get out of
[1:44:46] place that's how we start airing in
[1:44:49] spirit
[1:44:51] here look at what he said now the spirit
[1:44:53] of lord god is upon me because the lord
[1:44:56] has anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:44:58] unto the meek
[1:45:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[1:45:04] you are heady and hearty and amen can't
[1:45:06] nobody tell you nothing god ain't got no
[1:45:08] word for you
[1:45:09] but if you can be meek and submissive
[1:45:12] have lamb like nature
[1:45:15] hallelujah you can get lamb like nature
[1:45:18] then god can speak to you
[1:45:20] we we we live in a in a day in time
[1:45:22] where everybody knows something
[1:45:25] everybody know i mean the young people
[1:45:27] know more
[1:45:28] than old people now you know ain't never
[1:45:30] been a day like this
[1:45:32] hallelujah ain't never been a day like i
[1:45:34] mean god called it young for one reason
[1:45:37] they strong and have overcome the wicked
[1:45:38] way but it called it all because they
[1:45:41] know the way their wisdom speaks
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:47] you ain't gonna tell me hallelujah to
[1:45:49] the lamb of god
[1:45:51] doctor just coming out of school
[1:45:53] dr doctor just coming out of school
[1:45:57] and you have to go through a surgery but
[1:45:58] you got a doctor that's been practicing

[1:46:01] many times but you got one just coming
[1:46:03] out never did the surgery before just

[1:46:16] may you can
[1:46:17] observe i appreciate you doing all the
[1:46:19] study but i'm sorry this is my life

[1:46:30] just got started
[1:46:37] and can i take you to the book of judges
[1:46:39] can i take you there because in the book
[1:46:41] of judges you know the bible say every
[1:46:42] man did was write his own eyes and
[1:46:44] that's what we had again today but also
[1:46:46] in the book of judges there was a a a
[1:46:48] woman
[1:46:49] that had a son
[1:46:51] that had an anointing in his life and
[1:46:54] she raised up that son to be her pastor
[1:46:59] following false gods led off into false
[1:47:01] religion and everything else and they
[1:47:02] almost got the family whacked out
[1:47:04] following them false gods
[1:47:06] airing in spirit
[1:47:10] all right
[1:47:11] all right i'm in the bible now
[1:47:14] let me keep on reading
[1:47:17] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:47:18] preach good tidings
[1:47:20] unto the meat look you can't raise your
[1:47:22] own pasta
[1:47:26] you can't do that
[1:47:28] i'm gonna just tell you that right now
[1:47:29] jezebel tried to do that
[1:47:33] she had 450 of them but elijah was the
[1:47:37] pastor
[1:47:38] and god proved it when he answered by
[1:47:41] fire who the pastor that day was
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:46] oh glory to god
[1:47:47] i told y'all this is the supreme power
[1:47:50] and control you talk about you talk
[1:47:52] about an anointing
[1:47:53] this is one of the most annoying sermons
[1:47:55] you've ever gone here
[1:47:57] all right let me keep going amen preach
[1:48:00] good tidings unto the meek the
[1:48:02] submissive ones
[1:48:05] he has sent me to bind up the
[1:48:07] brokenhearted
[1:48:09] to proclaim proclaim liberty
[1:48:12] glory to god to the captives
[1:48:15] oh i love this
[1:48:16] i love this proclaim liberty to the
[1:48:19] captives you know as i was just kind of
[1:48:21] uh pondering that how do we do this
[1:48:25] you know uh you hate to see people in
[1:48:27] bondage
[1:48:29] as a pastor as a minister i hate to see
[1:48:31] people in bondage
[1:48:32] but you know uh i was just thinking on
[1:48:34] you know on this statement brother
[1:48:35] branham told us that he was in a dream
[1:48:39] and in a dream he saw some people in
[1:48:41] bondage
[1:48:42] and
[1:48:42] and and some of the people said now
[1:48:44] brother branham we're good people and uh
[1:48:47] and we don't want to be in a condition
[1:48:48] like this he says i knew some of them
[1:48:50] they was real good people and and i knew
[1:48:52] they didn't want to be in a position
[1:48:53] like that and say he said while he was
[1:48:55] in the dream say the lord jesus came to
[1:48:57] him in the form of a light he says i'm
[1:48:59] expecting you
[1:49:01] to deliver the people
[1:49:03] hallelujah he said lord how can i
[1:49:05] deliver and say the bars that they're
[1:49:07] locked in are just too big for me i'm
[1:49:09] not strong enough to be able to pull
[1:49:11] these things to loose i'm not i'm not
[1:49:14] i'm not big enough to be able to get
[1:49:15] this job done god how can you put the
[1:49:17] responsibility on me
[1:49:20] god didn't come back and give him no
[1:49:21] more ideas
[1:49:22] not in his vision but brother adam says
[1:49:25] so i said
[1:49:26] amen i might not have the ability to
[1:49:28] pull amen this way but i can release
[1:49:32] some things out of my mouth
[1:49:34] that would bring amen deliverance to the
[1:49:37] captives he said so i said
[1:49:40] house of hell give way to the name of
[1:49:43] the lord jesus christ
[1:49:45] hallelujah says all the birds begin to
[1:49:47] break because he spoke the right word at
[1:49:50] the right time
[1:49:53] that's why we that's why the lord give
[1:49:55] us sermons like this we're looking to
[1:49:57] speak the right word at the right time
[1:49:59] to see god's people go free
[1:50:04] just looking at a little something there
[1:50:06] you know we look at
[1:50:08] i had a quote here and i'm not going to
[1:50:09] read it because it just it might be a
[1:50:10] little bit too much time but but uh
[1:50:13] uh
[1:50:14] brother branham said when god was ready
[1:50:15] to bring electricity to the earth
[1:50:18] he sent a man by the name of benjamin
[1:50:20] franklin
[1:50:21] and he gave him a man a desire to want
[1:50:24] to capture electricity
[1:50:27] and he said he said now there's
[1:50:28] something in the lightning most of us
[1:50:30] run from lightning but benjamin franklin
[1:50:32] had something to him say i'm running to
[1:50:34] the lightning
[1:50:36] and it took himself a like kite out
[1:50:38] there and he took a jaw something in it
[1:50:40] and he put it up in the air and he was
[1:50:42] just every time lightning strike he
[1:50:44] trying to follow it and then he finally
[1:50:46] got a little strike come down the string
[1:50:48] into the jaw and when he saw what
[1:50:50] happened to john he started yelling and
[1:50:51] screaming i got it
[1:50:53] i got it
[1:50:55] all he had was something strike his job
[1:50:56] but he knew was something more to it
[1:50:58] but that story when thomas edison read
[1:51:01] it he said now there's got to be more
[1:51:03] than what benjamin franklin got he's he
[1:51:05] got something in the job but we can't do
[1:51:07] nothing with it what he got in a job he
[1:51:09] says got to be more to this so thomas
[1:51:11] edison grabbed himself a cup of coffee
[1:51:14] he got himself some some sandwiches and
[1:51:16] he started just eating and drinking and
[1:51:18] eating and putting this wire with that
[1:51:20] wire and putting this wire with that
[1:51:22] wire and putting this wire with that
[1:51:23] wire hallelujah i hope you're with me
[1:51:25] i'm trying to put this quote with that
[1:51:27] scripture put this here and put that
[1:51:29] there i'm trying to do everything i can
[1:51:31] because there's got to be something to
[1:51:34] bring deliverance to the people
[1:51:39] thomas says and stay with it
[1:51:42] until he finally got the right wires
[1:51:44] all across going going in the right
[1:51:46] direction he got a good flow of
[1:51:47] electricity
[1:51:49] and now we can enjoy the lights and the
[1:51:51] ac and all this because thomas edison
[1:51:53] would not quit
[1:51:55] and i'm gonna tell you the truth i'm
[1:51:56] looking forward to enjoying all my loved
[1:51:57] ones i

[1:52:16] midst of him

[1:52:53] you got to respect it
[1:52:55] don't think you just get out there and
[1:52:56] just do whatever you want to do you'll
[1:52:58] be you'll be messed up before you and
[1:52:59] the devil got one job steal kill
[1:53:02] destroy
[1:53:06] you got to run for your life don't just
[1:53:08] and don't keep playing with the devil i
[1:53:10] think i can just do this much
[1:53:12] no that that too much is too i mean that
[1:53:15] much is too much
[1:53:17] all right stay with me here
[1:53:19] the scripture says this the spirit of
[1:53:20] the lord god is upon me
[1:53:22] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:53:24] preach good tidings into the meek
[1:53:26] it sent me to bind up the broken heart
[1:53:28] to proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:53:31] and the opening of the prison
[1:53:33] to them that are bound
[1:53:35] look at this
[1:53:36] uh to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:53:39] the lord and the day of vengeance of our
[1:53:42] god to comfort all that more now now now
[1:53:44] uh when jesus
[1:53:46] a man took the book from uh the minister
[1:53:49] and closed it all he did he stopped at
[1:53:51] the part where it says to proclaim
[1:53:52] except for you of the lord he stop right
[1:53:54] there and say this day the scripture's
[1:53:56] fulfilled and the reason he stopped
[1:53:57] there because the day of vengeance of
[1:53:59] our god was a future day
[1:54:03] that was a future day
[1:54:04] hallelujah glory to god amen but i love
[1:54:08] this look at what else he says it says
[1:54:10] to comfort all that mourn
[1:54:13] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[1:54:17] amen to give unto them
[1:54:20] beautiful ashes
[1:54:22] oh god we need this the oil of joy
[1:54:26] amen for mourning
[1:54:29] the garment of praise
[1:54:31] for the spirit of heaviness
[1:54:34] amen that they might be called the trees
[1:54:36] of righteousness the planting of the
[1:54:39] lord that he might be glorified
[1:54:42] see i love i love this he wanted to
[1:54:44] comfort those that mourn
[1:54:46] this again this is internal things that
[1:54:49] are happening you know people mourn
[1:54:51] internally
[1:54:52] it shows itself externally but they and
[1:54:54] what they're going through that grief is
[1:54:56] something that's happening on inside god
[1:54:58] has to heal the inside
[1:55:01] amen
[1:55:03] oh hallelujah do you realize these are
[1:55:06] things that cause cancer in people
[1:55:09] but god has to heal the inside and let
[1:55:11] me tell them god can do some healing if
[1:55:13] you can stop your talking
[1:55:17] watch what you say
[1:55:19] i'm going to go a little further he's
[1:55:20] going to give conquer those that mourn
[1:55:22] give beautiful ashes to all of joyful
[1:55:23] mourning a garment of praise
[1:55:26] for the spirit of heaviness
[1:55:28] now um
[1:55:29] i want to give you just a couple more
[1:55:31] quotes here
[1:55:32] that woman had unconfessed sin
[1:55:35] in her life and
[1:55:37] it caused her to wonder cause her to air
[1:55:39] some people have that some people have
[1:55:41] that and it caused them to air amen in
[1:55:43] their spirit unconfessed sin can do that
[1:55:46] but i want to tell you that sin in the
[1:55:48] beginning
[1:55:49] caused adam and eve to wander away from
[1:55:51] the presence of god
[1:55:53] look at this out of the message
[1:55:54] fellowship listen to this quote
[1:55:58] when adam and eve separated themselves
[1:56:00] from god by sin
[1:56:03] separated them they become a wanderer
[1:56:05] see air air air means to wander they
[1:56:08] become a wanderer then no fellowship
[1:56:10] wandering about
[1:56:12] and weakening down now that's that's the
[1:56:14] key as you're wandering you're getting
[1:56:16] weaker and weaker and not even realize
[1:56:19] it spiritually weak
[1:56:21] right hallelujah you know there used to
[1:56:23] be a time you had a you had a
[1:56:25] a a no a holy conviction no i ain't
[1:56:29] doing that but then as you keep
[1:56:30] wandering you get weekend week and next
[1:56:32] thing you start getting involved in
[1:56:33] stuff that you never thought you'd get
[1:56:34] involved with right
[1:56:39] what's the matter with man today sin has
[1:56:41] separated
[1:56:42] man from that type of fellowship
[1:56:44] today we wonder how we're going to do
[1:56:47] this
[1:56:48] and we wonder how we're going to do that
[1:56:50] jesus said that he then seek after such
[1:56:52] things how we what we shall eat and how
[1:56:55] we should be clothed and and what we
[1:56:57] would do with this uh that or the other
[1:57:00] after all those things he says the
[1:57:02] gentiles and the unbelievers seek but
[1:57:04] your heavenly father knows what you have
[1:57:07] need of even before you ask him
[1:57:11] what a carefree
[1:57:13] condition now
[1:57:15] says why i got a little old brown-eyed
[1:57:17] girl down there while she jump off the
[1:57:19] fence down or anything she don't care as
[1:57:21] long as i'm standing there
[1:57:23] she says daddy pick me up she's just
[1:57:26] carefree
[1:57:27] i thought oh god if i could just be
[1:57:30] like that just carefree
[1:57:33] a few days ago brother joseph encouraged
[1:57:35] me a lot
[1:57:36] watch this statement i've seen a lot of
[1:57:38] stuff rising up in the churches
[1:57:41] that should not be
[1:57:43] oh well i i i just seen where i had to
[1:57:46] go out and stop it all myself
[1:57:49] it's what the prophet said you know i
[1:57:51] see all this stuff rising church i'm
[1:57:52] going to be the one to get i'm going to
[1:57:53] put a stop to this
[1:57:55] see even when i'm coming when we're
[1:57:57] coming to the pulpit we can't come with
[1:57:58] an agenda
[1:57:59] i told y'all this sermon i had
[1:58:02] since 2019 i have to wait on god to give
[1:58:05] me the release when they preach certain
[1:58:06] things
[1:58:07] amen look he said he says um
[1:58:10] uh um i was gonna cut out it says uh
[1:58:14] i just seen where i had to go out and
[1:58:15] stop it all myself i was gonna go out
[1:58:18] and say this can't be like this
[1:58:20] and this can't be like that can't do it
[1:58:23] because you're going to spoil god's
[1:58:24] program you're getting stuff in here
[1:58:27] that shouldn't be in all this and i knew
[1:58:29] it was wrong scripturally wrong and i'm
[1:58:31] supposed to stand here oh i began to
[1:58:33] find myself getting a little kind of off
[1:58:35] the line
[1:58:36] getting
[1:58:38] bitter
[1:58:40] i stopped out yonder on that and began
[1:58:44] to pray even a preacher got to pray
[1:58:47] got the guard in spirit
[1:58:49] you don't understand how ministers got
[1:58:51] the guard and spirit you know brother
[1:58:52] brother branham even had to guard
[1:58:53] himself against his own son
[1:58:56] one time billy paul was just joking too
[1:58:58] much
[1:58:59] and he joked and said something
[1:59:01] about his daddy hair piece or something
[1:59:03] like that he was just joking and and
[1:59:04] brother brother had to get up and walk
[1:59:06] away
[1:59:07] and uh and and like daddy i'm sorry i
[1:59:09] said son it's okay i mean me you joke
[1:59:11] like that say but you offended the angel
[1:59:12] that time
[1:59:15] you offended the angel you ain't offend
[1:59:16] me you're offended the angel of god
[1:59:18] that's why you got to be so careful
[1:59:20] church
[1:59:21] look look at this
[1:59:22] it says you're getting stuff in here
[1:59:23] that shouldn't be and all this and i
[1:59:25] knew it was wrong scripture wrong and
[1:59:26] i'm supposed to stand here oh i began to
[1:59:28] find myself getting a little account off
[1:59:29] the line getting bitter i stopped out
[1:59:31] yonder on that and began to pray and
[1:59:34] joseph come down said he said look i
[1:59:35] just read the history of martin luther
[1:59:38] and the question was that they didn't
[1:59:40] wonder about martin luther able to
[1:59:41] protest the catholic church and get by
[1:59:43] with it but what the wander was with
[1:59:45] martin luther is all of the fanaticism
[1:59:47] that followed it he raised up
[1:59:51] out of all of it that's the main thing
[1:59:54] then i heard
[1:59:56] that christ said
[1:59:58] what is that to thee
[2:00:01] follow thou me
[2:00:03] this bless me
[2:00:05] this bless me rather than you know when
[2:00:07] you see somebody aaron spirit it's very
[2:00:10] easy to just start picking on
[2:00:12] but here the question that comes to come
[2:00:15] when you see somebody in spirit you
[2:00:17] ought to just show love and pray for
[2:00:19] what is that to thee
[2:00:22] what is that to thee follow thou
[2:00:24] me right don't don't don't don't don't

[2:00:30] what is that to thee they they they
[2:00:32] god's clay
[2:00:36] and he makes a vessel of honor and this
[2:00:38] that's god's claim what is that to thee
[2:00:42] what you need to do is just follow thou
[2:00:45] me
[2:00:48] amen
[2:00:50] amen
[2:00:51] what is that to thee follow thou me
[2:00:54] i'll take care
[2:00:56] of the rest of it
[2:00:59] that's not my job to do it
[2:01:01] it's god's job to do it but my what my
[2:01:04] job is just stay with this word
[2:01:07] that he's given me
[2:01:08] oh blessed be his holy name
[2:01:11] he told me those that are aired in
[2:01:12] spirit they're going to come to an
[2:01:13] understanding
[2:01:15] and those that murmur they shall learn
[2:01:17] doctrine so what is that to me
[2:01:19] follow thou

[2:01:34] then get then get back to carefree again
[2:01:37] oh hallelujah
[2:01:39] church when we're just doing what god
[2:01:41] called us to do we can get back to
[2:01:43] carefree again
[2:01:45] i can i can be like like he was talking
[2:01:46] about his daughter just want to just
[2:01:48] jump and she see her daddy standing
[2:01:50] there i ain't got no problem jumping
[2:01:51] into the arms of my daddy
[2:01:53] i know daddy gonna catch me
[2:01:55] i know daddy gonna
[2:01:56] keep me from getting hurt i know daddy
[2:01:58] gonna do it she had a carefree attitude
[2:02:01] when she was playing god wants to have a
[2:02:03] carefree attitude when we're worshiping
[2:02:06] stop worrying about whether they're
[2:02:08] going to come or not
[2:02:09] they already here
[2:02:12] but you just worship god and you just
[2:02:15] love them you serve them the way that
[2:02:16] he's called you to serve him what is
[2:02:18] that to thee
[2:02:21] stop complaining
[2:02:23] stop crying
[2:02:24] what is that to thee follow thou me
[2:02:28] we don't pick it we don't pick our tests
[2:02:29] and we don't pick our trials
[2:02:31] we just say lord i thank you
[2:02:35] let me give you one more quote and i'm
[2:02:36] probably going to bring it bring it home
[2:02:38] here
[2:02:39] oh i i did want to say this before i get
[2:02:42] there
[2:02:43] my
[2:02:44] oh yes i got to see this
[2:02:49] when we talk about being heir in the
[2:02:50] spirit i think the prodigal son is a
[2:02:53] a person that we can look at in
[2:02:54] scripture that aired in the spirit
[2:02:57] but pride is one of the things that
[2:02:59] caused this prodigal son to wander away
[2:03:01] from his position and the bible says
[2:03:03] this in proverbs 16 verse 17 through 19
[2:03:06] the bible says this
[2:03:07] the highway of the upright
[2:03:10] is to depart from evil
[2:03:13] he that keepeth his way preserveth his
[2:03:15] soul
[2:03:16] look at verse 18 pride goeth before
[2:03:20] destruction
[2:03:22] and in holy spirit
[2:03:24] before fall so you got to stay meek
[2:03:26] you got to stay submissive see a holy
[2:03:29] spirit goes before a holy spirit you
[2:03:31] can't tell him what to do
[2:03:33] is the truth anyhow
[2:03:35] amen don't have a holy spirit when it
[2:03:38] comes to the things of god
[2:03:40] amen pride goeth before destruction and
[2:03:42] our heart is spirit before fall
[2:03:44] better it is to be of a humble spirit
[2:03:48] and with the lowly than to divide the
[2:03:51] spoil
[2:03:52] with the proud
[2:03:54] hallelujah now uh when i i looked at
[2:03:57] this this just a little definition when
[2:03:58] you say pride goes before a fall this
[2:04:00] proverb uh that we just read it says if
[2:04:03] you're too conceited
[2:04:05] or self-important something will happen
[2:04:07] to make you look foolish
[2:04:11] if you are too conceited
[2:04:13] or self-important
[2:04:16] something will happen
[2:04:18] to make you
[2:04:19] look foolish
[2:04:24] we got to have a the right spirit
[2:04:27] let me read without money without price
[2:04:30] and then the last quote that i want to
[2:04:31] read is coming out of mother's day
[2:04:32] without money without price
[2:04:34] uh this this prodigal son i believe had
[2:04:37] a hearty spirit he had
[2:04:39] air and spirit
[2:04:41] and something did happen to him that
[2:04:43] caused him
[2:04:44] a man to look foolish
[2:04:46] when
[2:04:48] when he was out eating the slop with the
[2:04:50] pigs and uh realized when he was in that
[2:04:53] condition that run out of money he
[2:04:55] realized when he's in that condition
[2:04:56] that my daddy my daddy's servants live
[2:04:58] better in a way i'm living out here let
[2:04:59] me just go home and be a servant
[2:05:01] and when it came back with that attitude
[2:05:03] glory to god when it came to an attitude
[2:05:06] then he could be raised to his position
[2:05:09] but his heart had to be right he had to
[2:05:10] come back
[2:05:12] submissive
[2:05:15] look at this the prodigal son
[2:05:17] enclosed and i might say this
[2:05:19] when we waste when he wasted all his
[2:05:21] living the father's living with riotous
[2:05:23] living and when he was returning home he
[2:05:26] was laying in a pigpen
[2:05:28] and he comes to himself and he said how
[2:05:29] many higher servants my father's got
[2:05:31] that is enough to spare and here i am
[2:05:33] dying for won't what if he tried to say
[2:05:35] wonder if i've got some money i could
[2:05:37] pay dad back
[2:05:39] what i spent right spent spent and
[2:05:41] running with but he know the nature of
[2:05:44] his father
[2:05:45] and said i will arise and go to my
[2:05:48] father
[2:05:49] oh look at this look at this watch this
[2:05:51] statement the father never said wait a
[2:05:53] minute son
[2:05:54] are you bringing my money back
[2:05:58] no
[2:05:59] no
[2:06:01] no
[2:06:03] he never charged them for his sins
[2:06:10] oh they come in i'ma have something to
[2:06:12] say to him i'm a hat this is the scene
[2:06:13] i'm a hat no no no no no no
[2:06:16] somebody else in their spirit don't you
[2:06:18] charge them
[2:06:20] for their sins
[2:06:25] don't charge them
[2:06:28] stand there like the daddy
[2:06:30] you don't owe me nothing but to love me
[2:06:34] no he never charged him for his sins
[2:06:36] he was glad
[2:06:38] that he was coming back he was glad that
[2:06:40] he come to himself because he was his
[2:06:42] son he was he was his own child he was
[2:06:44] glad he was on his road home now he
[2:06:46] didn't endorse his sin
[2:06:49] but he was glad when he come to himself
[2:06:51] and said i have sinned before my god and
[2:06:53] before my father i will rise and go to
[2:06:55] him
[2:06:56] and when he saw him far off
[2:06:59] he ran to him and kissed him and he said
[2:07:01] kill the fatted calf without money bring
[2:07:03] the best rope without money bring the
[2:07:05] ring without money put it upon his
[2:07:06] finger let us eat and drink and be merry
[2:07:09] but this my son was lost and is now
[2:07:11] found he was dead
[2:07:12] he's alive again
[2:07:14] let us be happy about it
[2:07:18] church i don't know how this gonna
[2:07:20] happen
[2:07:21] but all i know is god told me
[2:07:24] they also that aired in spirit
[2:07:27] shall come to understanding
[2:07:29] and they that murmured
[2:07:31] shall own doctrine
[2:07:32] how that's gonna happen that's not up to
[2:07:34] me to figure out
[2:07:36] but i know what god said in his word
[2:07:40] you can make a mistake
[2:07:42] but you can come back
[2:07:44] let me finish with this quote out of
[2:07:46] mother's day
[2:07:48] oh i love this
[2:07:51] then as we see
[2:07:52] him and we will not be as we are now
[2:07:57] we'll know how to love him more
[2:08:00] we'll stay we'll not stand back with a
[2:08:02] little fear
[2:08:03] because we'll be like him
[2:08:06] well he will be more of a relative to us
[2:08:09] than he is now
[2:08:11] we'll understand him better because
[2:08:13] we're so far away in the mortal bodies
[2:08:15] then we'll have a body like his glorious
[2:08:17] body we'll know how to worship him and
[2:08:20] when we see what the presence of his
[2:08:22] being has done to us changed us the old
[2:08:25] back young all the deformed straightened
[2:08:27] out oh we'll understand
[2:08:30] then why his power
[2:08:32] healed us
[2:08:33] the questions
[2:08:35] that's been in our mind how can he do it
[2:08:38] what would this somehow mysteriously
[2:08:40] they'll all fade away the knots that's
[2:08:43] been tied in the back of our minds will
[2:08:45] it be this how could it be somehow
[2:08:48] another majestic fingers
[2:08:50] will just untangle
[2:08:52] unravel those knots and it'll fade into
[2:08:55] one big crown of love
[2:08:58] then we shall see him then we shall be
[2:09:01] like him then we shall worship him then
[2:09:03] we shall see mother as god
[2:09:06] wants her
[2:09:08] mother would not be complete
[2:09:10] there without her family
[2:09:12] because the greatest time of all her
[2:09:14] life is to see her children around the
[2:09:16] table and all of them healthy and happy
[2:09:19] and to see her pour the coffee and
[2:09:21] whatever she does and fix his supper and
[2:09:23] her and dad sat down
[2:09:27] well that's the happiest time
[2:09:30] in mama's life now there's something
[2:09:32] about this because mamas used to get to
[2:09:34] the point when kids were growing up and
[2:09:36] especially we would we would eat my eat

[2:11:57] little link
[2:11:59] little weak link
[2:12:00] that that has separated this great
[2:12:02] family reunion at that day
[2:12:05] may the god of heaven this morning
[2:12:08] oh
[2:12:10] we got we got families separated
[2:12:13] because of this word
[2:12:15] we got it that way we realized that
[2:12:18] but i told you like ben franklin and
[2:12:20] and thomas edison they they kept trying
[2:12:23] to they got something you know what as
[2:12:24] ministers we're going to keep trying
[2:12:26] till we get something that penetrates
[2:12:28] the heart
[2:12:31] to get people in their place with god
[2:12:35] if you're the little weak link
[2:12:38] that has separated this great family
[2:12:39] unit that day may the god of heaven
[2:12:43] this morning
[2:12:45] not next week not next year this morning
[2:12:49] somehow

[2:12:55] unravel
[2:12:57] those little knots
[2:12:59] that's tied in your mind that's your
[2:13:02] spirit
[2:13:04] and reveal to you the love that he has
[2:13:07] for you
[2:13:10] and may you come sweetly
[2:13:13] submissively
[2:13:15] humbly
[2:13:16] meek
[2:13:20] man you come sweetly to serve him
[2:13:23] this thing about
[2:13:24] doing it for mama
[2:13:26] this ain't about doing it for daddy
[2:13:29] this ain't about doing it for pastor
[2:13:31] it's about doing it for you
[2:13:37] i believe i believe that
[2:13:39] god is here that's what he came to do is
[2:13:41] to
[2:13:42] recover sight of the blind and
[2:13:45] there we read it earlier
[2:13:48] uh in luke four and let me just give you
[2:13:50] these these things that he said that he
[2:13:51] would do and i believe he's doing this
[2:13:53] he's
[2:13:54] anointed to preach the gospel to the
[2:13:55] poor that's those that are poor in
[2:13:56] spirit is sent to heal the brokenhearted
[2:14:00] preach deliverance to the captives
[2:14:02] recovering of sight to the blind
[2:14:05] set at liberty those that are bruised
[2:14:09] and they preach the acceptable year of
[2:14:11] the lord which is
[2:14:13] the year of jubilee
[2:14:16] i thank god
[2:14:19] and i declare by faith
[2:14:21] this is
[2:14:23] a year jubilee
[2:14:26] amen
[2:14:29] they also that aired in spirit
[2:14:34] succumb to understanding
[2:14:37] and they that murmured
[2:14:41] shall learn doctrine
[2:14:45] the lord had a blessing to his word as
[2:14:47] we've heard it today
[2:14:58] let's just pray man
[2:15:05] father your word is
[2:15:06] real
[2:15:11] and we're grateful for the promises that
[2:15:13] you give us we can hold
[2:15:17] to your unchanging hand
[2:15:20] remain faithful god even when things are
[2:15:23] going against us don't
[2:15:25] seem right don't look right don't feel
[2:15:28] right
[2:15:29] all five senses
[2:15:31] are speaking one thing and then even
[2:15:33] those inner senses and the spirit starts
[2:15:35] speaking something else but god down on
[2:15:37] the inside inside there's a soul
[2:15:41] controlled by doubt
[2:15:43] or faith
[2:15:44] we choose
[2:15:45] to believe
[2:15:47] the word of the lord and every promise
[2:15:48] that you've gave us
[2:15:53] satan we say that you're a liar and
[2:15:56] there's nothing you can do to stop god's
[2:15:57] word from being fulfilled
[2:16:00] so we read the testimony of the lady
[2:16:02] that was standing to be prayed for and
[2:16:03] just seemed like the devil would not
[2:16:04] leave
[2:16:07] by satan staying
[2:16:10] it allowed us to get more
[2:16:13] of
[2:16:14] what was there
[2:16:16] we realized lord that when it was
[2:16:17] revealed to her about
[2:16:19] lord what she did as a as a
[2:16:22] young kid and
[2:16:24] how she walked away and wondered
[2:16:26] from the presence of god
[2:16:29] but on that day she made a declaration
[2:16:32] that she was coming home
[2:16:34] god let this be a day of declaration for
[2:16:36] somebody that i'm coming home
[2:16:39] maybe a a a conversation that they have
[2:16:41] with you
[2:16:44] maybe they admit lord yes i've erred in
[2:16:46] spirit
[2:16:48] i've heir but you gave me a promise god
[2:16:52] that i would come to understanding
[2:16:55] let majestic fingers
[2:16:58] even move now
[2:17:01] in our minds of god and unravel the
[2:17:04] knots that have been tied
[2:17:06] [Music]

[2:17:10] know that you will do it
