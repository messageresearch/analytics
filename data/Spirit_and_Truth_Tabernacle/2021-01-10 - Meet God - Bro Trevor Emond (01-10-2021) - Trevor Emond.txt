seated in the presence of the lord brother jerry if i can just get a little bit more in my mic in the monitors i appreciate that so good to be in the house of god on today and man grateful for the service that we had on last night precious brother zion uh ministered for us and did a wonderful job on the subject of rest and uh brother zion say that was my third time preaching i say what and uh the just the way the servant the sermon was laid out and just point by point by point and i'm like like a veteran you know and uh but it was just a wonderful wonderful thought and and just just appreciate the lord jesus for using him uh in a very special way on last night and uh if you weren't here uh we have it uh on facebook facebook sat tabernac if you just look for that on facebook you'll be able to see all the services there and i'm sure you'll be blessed by uh just the thought that he he brought he you know god is in every detail of our life [Music] every detail and uh brother zion was kind of sharing a portion of my testimony i didn't really want to go to school either i hated reading the only thing i want to read was the bible and and what the prophet said that's all i need to see right but i remember going to school and there was a a book that i read and uh and when i read this book um it it it changed me uh it actually uh moved me to uh to think about some things in in my christian journey and uh the title of the book was called who moved my cheese [Music] and um when i read i saw the title book i said now this this is this is this who wrote a book about moving cheese what is this nonsense why i got to read something like this right but as i start reading the book and they start bringing out the various characters inside the book and i can't remember i know it was two mice and two humans and uh and what happened there with the two mice and two humans is they were both going to a particular cheese station they were going and the mice begin to notice that you know we keep eating this cheese and she's represented something different for everybody to my to the mice it was their it was their their their substance for life is what they needed to eat in order to live but for the humans it was like their jobs it was their careers it was all these other things you know and and uh so they would show up at the same cheese station every day every day and uh and then the mice notice that as we keep eating on this cheese the cheese is starting to dwindle down praise the lord and the mice start having conversations like we're going to have to make a change here real quick to get some more cheese but the humans say no the cheese is going to come back when this go it's going it's going to be some oh come they said it might say uh-uh you gonna have to move to a new cheese station and uh and as the mice begin to just take a journey through the path of life and you know they they uh they they finally found some new cheese and they were just enjoying it and like i one of the humans still stuck back there that old cheese station and uh the mice were just sitting there enjoying and say oh i wish them humans would just wake up one day and realize there's more cheese out here [Music] there's more cheese out here hallelujah and then finally you know the the mice were sitting went to eat some cheese that day and they heard the dope busts open here come the humans and they wonder how the humans made it here so fast because one of the mice decided to leave some signs in the maze so they would find a way out a little faster than the mice did because the mice ran into a lot of dead ends but they found that let me leave you some signs so you'll go down some dead roads but you can get here faster to the cheese because there's more food out here and i'll tell you what when i read that i realize there's more food out there i had to go get some more cheese and god been feeding me ever since lord i thank you i thank you god amen but you know god uses every detail of our life to speak to us and his brother zion was saying last night he was you know just uh in that class of ethics he thought it was the wrong class and maybe some aspects of it could be wrong but when he got this part out of it about them three stages of the human uh development they say you go through the joyous ethical stage i'm sorry the joyous stage and then you and you go through this a joyous is more like you know every everything just make you happy whatever make you happy that's what you do i i my my grandson when he come to the house whatever he want to do he do if he want to go open up the piano just hit a few notes and and then walk to rebecca's room and hit a few notes on her piano that's what he do if he want to throw his cup on the floor and just spin it around that's what he do right because he's in that stage that we don't even try to correct him let him do what he do but he gonna get a little older and then he got the transition to the next stage and this is what they call the ethical stage where there's some rules on you can't throw that golf ball in the house [Music] you're gonna hurt something right you can't throw that golf ball in the house you got no no no there's a time and place for all of that but you can't do that here he gonna learn he gonna learn some you can't jump on the bed rules you understand how that work right i mean so he gonna learn that and if he don't learn it you know there's other consequences praise the lord but that's when we get to the ethical states but he say finally we get to this religious stage where it requires a leap of faith spirit lead me where my trust is without borders let me walk upon the water wherever you would call me take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder my faith would be made stronger in the presence of my savior i thank god for the word of god on last night amen amen amen and you know we're just grateful for all that the lord's doing and um i just wanted to just quickly mention before brother trevor would come we're happy to have his family here with us and and um you know all of our uh uh church of okeechobee we certainly thank god for you being here and uh uh what i want to do quickly after service amen just have a brief meeting with everyone uh we'll just let the visitors be dismissed but just a quick meeting and uh but i just thank god for what he doing this this is this is our season this is our time and god is moving in miraculous ways amen miraculous ways so uh we thank god for pastor smiley there in the back we certainly appreciate him and man man wonderful servant of god uh and um i um um need to also mention that next week uh i am i'll be away i'll be in um in brother jason watkins and beaufort south carolina and what's happened is they're having a minister's meeting and they've been planning this meeting for a little bit and they said they wanted to take the topic of unity and just kind of talk about unity in in the body you know and how ministers can respect one another and unite with one another and all it is and they say brother jack we'd like you to be one of the speakers on this type of topic of unity i see uh let me pray about it and as i begin to pray and just you know think on us and i i i coming from south florida i think we got something that we can share and and and yesterday brother brother gene was at the the the memorial service for sister mina that we held and and he was like we we this this this virus just got us divided we got to be able to come back together we got to be able to get back together now and it's something about the saints longing to be together it's something about that right and uh you know so as he was just talking my heart was just moving and i'm praying at some point in time we'll be able to come if you got to wear a mask we're a mask it don't matter just let's get together amen but it's just something about fellowship amongst the saints ain't nothing like it in this world all right so so you know we were uh uh i said with you know with what we have experienced here in south florida with the unity meetings that we've had for a number of years i said lord i'm sure i could say something to be a help to the brothers amen and in that area and uh you know those that will be coming to the minister's meeting so i'll be doing that and then brother jason asked me to just stay around stay around sunday morning and and speak at his church and you know it's my first time speaking there at their church so keep us in prayer amen as we go just to be a part of that uh but uh we're certainly looking forward to all that god has in store uh i i i i believe that um i believe god gonna keep us this year i honestly believe god gonna keep us this year hey man last year they had us afraid to go anywhere god gonna keep his church we're gonna be all right he brought us through 2020 he gonna take us through 2021. amen by faith amen we keep walking amen so uh we want to stand our feet and uh let's prepare to welcome uh brother trevor eamon a very very dear friend of mine uh coming a man from um sellersburg which is near jeffersonville uh but uh we appreciate him and you know he attends there at church of the open door with uh brother nathan bryan as the pastor both again dear friends of mine my brother trevor has been with me on almost just about a 20-year journey and uh we met each other and and just just been connected you know joint at the hip pretty much and uh you know just a real real real precious precious friends so many turns that we've taken in life and he's just been right there you know by my side we've encouraged one another in the faith and even challenged one another in the faith but uh nonetheless i have been blessed to have a friend like brother turvan i thank god for his family his wife sister anna may his son brother zion his other son uh azariah a man on the he took the sticks last night and did a wonderful job and uh his precious daughter gloriano hey man we appreciate each and every one of you and thank god to have you all with us amen uh on the trip it's something about coming to florida in january amen brother trevor would you just come and just take your liberty this morning let's say praise the lord as he comes [Music] check there we go all right praise the lord amen zion if you'd come just have a song we'd like to sing i haven't really practiced it too much but you may be seated up some words here you know just reminded throughout this year and you know we have we've had covid and we've had ups and downs and disappointments um uh when zion was talking about trials and tests and how we do you know through the tests and it just spoke to me i've been um last three months been dealing with a bulging disc in the bottom of my neck and i if you've ever dealt with that that's well that's trial that's trial so three months of you know pain level two or greater you know and it just pretty much uh just pretty much never ends you know we gotta deal with that sometimes we go through trials and we go through pains and loved ones are taken away from us and and we recognize that it's hard and you know i think sometimes especially here in the u.s maybe god allows these things to just remind us this isn't home this isn't home don't get too happy here we're pilgrims and strangers seeking a city that is to come we're looking for jesus to come and take us to a home away from here you know he's coming in that buck board wagon and we should have the wedding garments on to get on and say yes take me to that mansion you prepared and so we're just reminded of that i think in particularly in 2020 that was to me just a reminder that this isn't our home and so this song is you may have heard it but it just seems like such a blessing to me it's called almost home so are you disappointed are you desperate for hell you know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself when you start to believe you don't have what it takes [Music] cause it's all you can do just to move much less finish the race but don't forget what lies ahead almost home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing [Applause] [Music] in the end [Music] simply because of jesus in us it's not if but when so take joy in the journey even when it feels long oh find strength in each step knowing heaven is cheering you we are almost home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing on we are almost home i know that my cross has brought heaven to us but make no mistake there's still more to come when our flesh and our bones are no longer between we are right now and where we're meant to be when all that's been lost is made whole again when these tears in this pain no longer exist no more walking we're running as fast as we can consider this our second window most home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing on [Music] almost [Music] almost [Music] [Applause] we are almost home amen amen amen bless the name of the lord amen thank you musicians thankful to be almost home amen amen if i can get my notes here all right praise the lord while you have your bibles uh just turn to exodus chapter three if you stand with me just want to say while you're turning there exodus chapter three we'll read verses one through ten uh certainly a privilege to be back uh to be with friends and family what a journey it's been and brother jack has been there for us so much and just appreciate this friendship and um yeah words just just can't say how i feel about this place how i feel about brother jack so uh i won't even try or well or then i just won't preach because then that would probably just mess me all up so anyway it's just good it's good to be here i appreciate you all and amen love you so exodus chapter 3 verses 1-10 moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large a land flowing with milk and honey into the place of the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i have also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt can we bow our head for worst prayer heavenly father lord i just pray that we would have a similar moment this morning in this service that moses had you said in your word that where two or three were gathered in your name you would be in their midst father father is that any different than how moses was there with you on this mountain lord i pray that you would open our eyes to see you in our midst lord that it would cause us to humble our hearts before you and that we would that you would speak to us in the same way lord and then it would change us in the same way that it changed moses lord that's what this is all about not about religion not about ethics but father it's about an experience with you it's about knowing the one that created us and you created us for a specific purpose father so that we could fulfill that purpose we must know you and what you have for us so father would you come in our midst now and anoint me to speak o god father that it wouldn't just be emotions though lord we want to have a good time and we want to feel good in service we want to shout we want to praise you we want to worship you father but lord may the living reality of almighty god the spirit working in conjunction with the word come and just be that pillar of fire and light and set ablaze in each of our hearts oh god that's what we're looking for lord we're looking for you the one we love the one we're looking forward to come and take us home so father would you come into our midst now and move on us we ask it in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so this morning i want to take a a a title of uh of meet god meet god just a simple thought really um i i had i had you know when you as an evangelist when you travel around a lot of times what you do is you take your you know your your your number one sermon you know the one that had the most punch and the one that had the most you know uh whatever it it might be you know that you think had the most response of the people and and that's probably the one that you preached 20 times during that year you know in 20 different churches and you preach the same sermon some brothers don't don't really agree with that they want something fresh but you know i'm i'm the message teacher you know or a message teacher not the you know um you know so so and we we have we have great debates at their the church in new albany you know we we had a when some of the young ministers after they had been ordained we had a minister's meeting kind of to encourage the young brothers you know and and uh brother attila one of our our brothers from romania as a minister there and he began telling the brothers you know what he does to prepare for a sermon how he studies and things like that but that he doesn't really take too much for notes when he goes to the pulpit because he wants you know to just the anointing to come and just take his bible and preach out of the word of god and it's just like hey man and i sat there going man that don't look a thing like what i do i'm like what what you just said scares me i would never do that brother you know maybe i'm less spiritual or than you or something but brother i ain't doing that you know you know and and so we just began to tell the the young brothers it's like hey it however god works in your life whatever that gift is and we're all different and and and so many of us you know so me i have a fairly scripted sermon because it's something that i'm teaching and you just you know you've got to be pretty precise on things you know you can't just fly off the cuff and and you know or people going to get confused so you know you should have it fairly ordered and logical and and things like that and that's just kind of the way i am so so i thought well i'll just bring you know kind of my you know premier teaching of the year and that's probably just what we'll we'll do and we'll we'll talk about you know uh what is it rejection deception redemption see that's a great title right i mean who doesn't want to hear that sermon you all are like great now you've told us that but you're not going to preach that see and and well sorry but i think it was wednesday night maybe thursday night i think wednesday night i i had a dream and um i don't really even remember the dream too much but i remember it was a very disturbing dream i remember waking up i'd actually remember like i you know it's one of those ones where i kind of woke up and was like oh i hate this you know but you fall back to sleep and when you fall back to sleep you're still in the same dream and it's like all right i hate to wake myself up more uh but i'm waking myself up more because i ain't going back into this joker this is just dumb and so kind of got myself out of that and you know just started kind of praying it's like lord just you know calm my spirit you know be here with me and and then you know is this the thoughts you know in your in your head at 2 a.m or whatever time it is and then you're you're saying lord just just calm me and then of course you're you're you're you're thinking well who am i asking you know is is there really someone out there that's going to come and just you know somehow supernaturally calm me or am i just going to have to breathe and you know get my mind on something else you know is it true is this is this is there really a god out there that's going to come and actually spend time calming me down from a dumb dream that i had then of course you begin to think well yeah but the alternative is to think that we're all here randomly by chance and uh i can't do that come on and you begin to just remember god and you you know we we and i'm just being honest you know maybe you don't think things like that at 2am but i'm i'm guessing that every one of us probably at times you know it's like really you know when you're lying on your floor at 2 a.m and the pain levels somewhere around a six or a seven and you've got the heating pad on your back and you're saying jesus by your stripes i'm healed but that pain level ain't going anywhere you start saying lord why lord is the reason i still have pain because you're not real or or or is is it truly that you just want me to go through this trial or or what's it all about lord and your mind goes through all kinds of things you know amen amen i mean you know you know wait wait brother jack the preacher you had for us this morning is telling us that he doubts god at 2 a.m when he's in pain could we get another one but it's real right like these things happen you can't you know are these my thoughts are these the devil's thoughts like i i don't know but i know they come in my head yeah yeah and i know i throw them out right but that don't mean they're not there that doesn't mean that it's not hard sometimes and so so in these times that we're disturbed in these times that we're in pain and in these times when we're uncertain and the future looks unclear because moses is in a spot here where his future is very unclear his past has a lot of pain in it you know he he grows up and and being told that he's going to be something and then it doesn't work out and now he's there wandering in a desert and yeah he's married now and he's got kids but you know his wife has a temper and just sometimes you know it's just like man you know i miss the the baths of egypt or the whatever it might be you know like what have i done lord if i'm truly supposed to deliver where's my army wow how am i going to do this god i've already failed once you probably don't even want me you know what's it all about like are you real lord like is it is this even a reality like come on how's this gonna happen god and we get there sometimes and we get there sometimes and moses now he he comes and you know so so like i said you know here i have this disturbing dream and i begin to think these kinds of things and i'm reminding myself it's no you you've met god you know he's real you know he's true you've you've seen him work a little temporary pain doesn't doesn't somehow go through the cosmos and obliterate the existence of god it just means that absolutely god is true because because man fell in the garden of eden and now we're subject to the curse and you can have a you can have a disc bulging and rupture in your neck why because man fell in the garden of eden and so actually pain only just proves the existence of god even more [Applause] and so i began to think about this and i you know no i can't i can't talk i've got to just there's and i just felt that this there's it's here i've got to preach this sermon about meeting god here and i think some of the examples that i've i'll use today you've maybe some of you have seen i think i've probably used some of them over the years but but i just really feel that it's for for you all today amen that god just directed this and wants this so someone here this is for you it might just be one of you maybe it's all of you i don't know but i believe that god really wants this for us so so so here's moses now he's he's in the he's in the wilderness you know he's on the back side of the desert he's watching uh jethro's sheep and he's married now he's got a couple of children and and you know nothing has worked out right in his life and he's questioning you know where where god is and all of this and how is he supposed to be a deliverer and if there's if these prophecies are real where's the fruit man and then he sees a bush that isn't burning well that's strange and goodness that's odd like i guess i'm gonna go check that out you know and so he goes and he he looks at this burning bush and and and god begins to speak to him out of this burning bush now how do we know that this actually happened because moses told us amen amen yeah that's the only reason moses told us so you believe that just because on the report of one man just i don't know if that says anything to you all but you know when you think these things you just got to stop there for just a moment and you know you can extrapolate that there's things that we believe because brother branham told amen right so so we believe this happened because moses told us now now but but but but it's more than that isn't it because because actually history bears record that there was a people that came out of egypt and and there's historical and archaeological evidence that that talk about this there's histories that talk about these these things that have happened so so actually this you see what what happens is this moses comes in contact with god moses has an experience with god and moses meets god you see it's more now it's it's more than just the training of his mother but you know he's now taking that leap of faith that we talked about last night that now moses is coming into a place where he's recognizing there's more to the eye than just what you see here on the world but but that god is real and now he's coming he's met god and that one man meeting god changed the course of the history of the entire world because one man met god you see that's that's a big thing and and that's truly what god wants for all of us is for each one of us to meet him in the same way that moses met him now maybe you don't see a pillar of fire burning in a bush but you should have the same experience that moses had up there on mount sinai you see you know if someone were to come and ask you young man what's your name i'm sorry josiah josiah if someone were to ask you go take over russia think you could do it give you a stick big one nice tall hefty hit people with it it's not feeling it he's not feeling it come come on you ever think about how moses fell how god how am i gonna how am i gonna deliver all these people god like i said you know where's the army god like it's gonna take something no i'm gonna send you this stick and your brother you know somebody's feeling confident this morning it isn't me god i mean these are thoughts that i'm thinking i would have had you know like like lord great plan not feeling it but he does it right but now because he's met almighty god he's able to take a staff and he goes he doesn't doubt why because he's met god because the experience of that puts something behind him and something in him that gives him the confidence that even if he doesn't understand he puts the staff down and takes a step towards egypt [Music] and he continues to press on and absolutely goes and delivers the people why because he met god because it was there was a reality of it you see josiah doesn't want to go take over russia even if i give him a stick because you know like it's trevor asking him like who cares man like you want me to take over russia yeah and who are you and why should i listen to you but you know sometimes you know who's asking us makes a difference so brother brother josue if i asked you for a pizza would you buy me a pizza if if what's that can't handle that sun-dried tomatoes and roasted red peppers oh we got something all right fresh mozzarella all right i'll see i'll eat your vegetarian pizza i'm even good with a cauliflower crust [Music] my status can buy me a vegetarian pizza who i am and with regards to brother josue can get me a vegetarian pizza if i if i if i really came to you and say brother would you help me out i i need a tank of gas would you buy me a tank of gas i have a large car 26 gallon tank so my status with josue gets me a tank of gas and a vegetarian pizza would you go climb everest brother my status does not get a climb up mount everest who i am is not enough it's not enough but if god comes you see if someone with sufficient authority someone with a sufficient power were to come and ask come on suddenly that's different now like okay you know suddenly okay lord i'll go why because it's you because you're the one asking and and you see then so then if you really truly recognize who god is when you meet that's him you see sometimes you know you see well god's asking me to do this but i mean i don't know like dressing holiness and you know all of these things that that that that the message is asking me to do well is it the message asking you to do it or is it almighty god and so when you can recognize that it's almighty god and not just the message then suddenly it's like oh okay i'll take over egypt and i'll do it in a skirt fine [Music] no problem god that's what you want that's what you can like yes okay brother trevor asks you to do that and you're like yeah brother jack get us another one get another evangelist in here i don't like this one he's not enough but if the spirit of almighty god can come in this room today and witness the word of god to your heart that's different and if you can recognize that's him and what he's asking of you man that'll just change everything man so you know at some point you got to know the person that's asking you what they're asking okay that's great you can ask all you want for me to go take over russia but no but god comes oh that's different that's different so so it's not the request that changes it's not you that changes everything's the same the only difference is is when you've come and met him amen because the one you know the one asking moses to deliver the children of israel he hadn't changed the only thing that changed is moses met him at some point he became a reality to moses and when that happened moses changed the world amen amen amen now a personal experience with god brother madam says now watch faith take a hold right quick the old things are passed away but moses now has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience he had met god he had talked to god before that he had not met god he'd only read and knowed what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother had said hearing what the pastor had said but now moses has a personal experience so moses comes out of that ethic stage and he comes into that leap of faith stage moses comes into a place where where what he had heard has now become real to him amen that's where we gotta be and you say well brother trevor what does that mean for me i don't know what that means for you but but whatever god is asking you to do even the things that you might be struggling with don't try to fix you meet god meet god you see meeting god makes just it makes you do crazy things it makes you do things you'd never you'd never you'd never think you know so let's let's talk about brother brother branham mentions a man by the name of john sherrod and many of you probably recognize this name and you probably recognize it in context with the tree that was at brother john sherrod's ranch that was an orange tree but it had grafted in angelos and it grafted in all these other citrus lemons and you know all of these other fruits grapefruits whatever it is you know citrus fruits grafted in but if the tree ever puts out another branch it's going to be oranges because that's the original right so we're all very familiar with that but but less familiar sometimes we are with the story of brother john sharon's upbringing brother john chair was a very poor man he brother brown says he busted concrete as a job for 25 cents an all hour there's not much i'm doing for 25 cents an hour busting concrete sure isn't it that sounds terrible brother john sherrod busting concrete for 25 cents an hour he doesn't talk well he's you know he doesn't think too much of himself he's not very educated and so he's busting concrete begins to save up money saves up fifteen hundred dollars him and his wife buy a house right i don't know how long it takes i could do the math at some point but 25 cents an hour 1500 like man that's a long time of busting concrete long time you know what that house is gonna mean to you after you've busted concrete at 25 cents an hour for fifteen hundred dollars man this house is a mansion this house is amazing paid for this in blood sweat and tears and then this preacher this was out in phoenix area and this preacher comes to town and god comes and tells brother john sherrod i want you to give your house take your silverware and your wife move out of the house give this house to this minister that's come into this area and is starting to work and i i want you to give him your house brother solomon you you recently moved down to west palm beach right did you not yet haven't haven't completed in the name of jesus amen okay all right all right well who here has the most recent house purchase so i'm gonna pick on you brother i feel the lord leading me [Music] to start a work down here in florida could i have your house possible possible not likely though not likely you're like i haven't been paid for the thing it's yet big ask isn't it that's crazy no one would do that no one would give their house because a minister comes into that area and they had a thought you know i should be nice to this minister and give him my house would anyone do that it's ridiculous and maybe that minister should try working for a little bit you know i mean there's all kinds of thoughts you can have in your hand i want my house are you kidding me no why then does john sharon give this minister his house and you know it might be one thing if it was just him in the house you know i mean i can go live under a bridge but i don't feel that god has ever called me to go live under a bridge with my wife and children i just i'm like there's scriptures that tell me i should provide for them and that's there's confliction here i don't know how to do this but if it's just me like that's another thing but to take my silverware and my wife and and go figure out where to live god what no john sherrod does this why why does john share it do this because he met god you don't do crazy things like i mean unless you're crazy but john chair was not crazy like no he did it because he had met god because he was sure of the one who was telling him to do this so john sherrod takes his wife and and and silverware as i said and he finds he finds this uh this woman that needs some yard work done on her property and she says well you can live in my garage so he gets some cardboard and different things and sets up house in this woman's garage and lives there for a while and finally this woman begins to appreciate him and oh and god comes to her and says i want you to give john chair at ten thousand dollars to start a business [Laughter] uh brother i've been i've been wanting to start a business you got to spare 10 g's that i could have who does that who gives someone else ten thousand dollars and this was back in 1950 something like what is that today that's like a hundred thousand dollars or something like that that's nobody just does that but this woman was convinced that it was god it was god telling her and so she does it at some point we begin to realize that we can look at some of these things in history we can look at some of these things that that have impacted the the the world like moses bleeding the children of israel out of egypt and have to recognize that god is real because if he wasn't these people would have never done such a thing amen they would have never done that john sharon wouldn't have given up his home right he wouldn't have he wouldn't have he wouldn't have gotten ten thousand dollars from this lady she gives him ten thousand dollars and he's like what i'm i'm uneducated what am i gonna do with ten thousand dollars and so what does he do he he he he he finally he's like okay and he buys a house no not for him and his wife to live in that would have i would have thought they would have done that but they didn't he buys a house he fixes it up and he and he flips it and then he starts flipping homes and and and you know i think eventually he bought him and his wife a house you know as a matter of fact then suddenly he's somehow he's he's got himself to a place where he has millions of dollars and he's got all these ranches that brother branham can come to why because god blessed him why did god bless him well he met god amen did god bless him because he gave up his home to this minister okay yeah because he met god god doesn't bargain god god's bigger than that god doesn't have like well okay if you uh if you uh give up your home uh john sherrod you know uh maybe ten years later i'll i'll have a million dollar ranch for you john sherrod should have never given up his home for that reason so that he could he pay his his christian dues so that he could get blessed later no he did it because he met god something way more important than a million dollar ranch later john cher had met god and that's the reason he did it not looking for the blessings later but doing it because the one who he loved the one who had created him the one who he was he was he was he knew his life was there and created to bring him glory asked it of him the reward later didn't matter only thing that mattered was because of him he asked go and if you're there you know i think i've told you the story about you know me pulling out of the driveway once you know and oh there's the mailbox and you know wonder if there's a check in the mailbox and on that check is my name and one million dollars and driving down the road going to work thinking about oh lord what i would do with that million dollars you know i pay off my house a full-time ministry then you know lord a million dollars would just go a long way to me serving you and this is what's going on in my head and then suddenly i realized what an idiot you are trevor why are you thinking you know like you're spending five ten minutes thinking about the most ridiculous thing ever if you're off in fantasyland for what what's better a million dollars of the provision of almighty god pretty simple question pretty simple to answer that we don't always think like that though right but when we come into his presence when we come and the the bush is burning suddenly things are different suddenly it's very easy to recognize i want what you want i don't care about a million dollars as long as you're there as long as you're asking everything's fine as long as i'm in your hands everything's fine because you because you are i am then all is well and he is i am and there's no qualifications there's no quantifications there's no he's i am for me but he might not be i am for you no he is i am and when we come and we get to a place where we recognize who we are in light of i am and we meet the i am not the i was not the i will be but the i am who is he now i am suddenly everything's different millions of dollars don't matter the house don't matter that's hard to say that's hard to really feel why because we don't know him enough so we're not as used to his presence as we ought to be that's what changes things that's what changed moses is what changed john share it that's what changed this woman as they got into the presence of god and recognized the i am was there yes sir and in in his presence egypt can be leveled in his presence you can give a house away in his presence you can give ten thousand dollars and it's okay why i am but how often do we think of him as i am as all-encompassing as as everything that that ever was and ever is and all that matters is him no so many times we get so me centric and we think about me and what i need and god i need you to heal me i need you to take my problems away god and if you don't i'll begin to doubt who you are and whether or not you're even real and where things are at lord this pain hurts am i thinking about him as the i am and that's in that scenario no i'm thinking about him as in the who you can do what you can do for me and yeah who you are for me should we think about him like that no no does he care about us yes will he take the pain away yes sometimes he'll just hold our hand through the trial sometimes he'll just take it away hey man but he's the i am he's wonderful he's everything so so we need to get ourselves then to a place where we meet god like moses where we meet god like john shared where it becomes a living reality to us that we're living in a place where it's not just religion anymore but we're dwelling in the i am we're dwelling in him so so how how can we know him then like okay we we talked about we need to meet him and you know but isn't that what we've done like in that with church and altar and you know baptism holy spirit like you know what all that is like but but i want to give just a little illustration here and like i said i think i've given this illustration before but but you bear with me maybe not everybody's heard it so can i use you yeah what's your name joseph you're gonna have to come up here can you put your notebook down i'm sorry you're gonna stop taking notes for a minute all right all right you can stand right here right here i'm going to need you let's see here we're going to need this you ever thrown anything in church okay today's your day so all right okay uh you all don't see joseph you don't know joseph okay play along okay joseph uh how old are you 10 years old 10 years old and let's see here purple tie what's your favorite food broccoli on pizza you are a unique individual joseph you said joseph okay okay i want to tell you about a young man named joseph you've never met him before you don't see him but but um joseph is a young man 10 years old got his hair slicked back wearing a purple striped tie loves broccoli who would have thought unique young man unique young man today i want to preach to you about joseph and i want to tell you how great this young man is he sits in the front row every service and he takes notes and what a great guy and and man he he says amen like like like anybody in this church you know i mean just great guy do you know joseph don't play along because i've merely from me telling you about this young man who loves broccoli do you know him so what you're saying is i'm a terrible preacher i can tell you all about joseph and none of you know him great okay i get it i get it you know maybe it's not me maybe you all are slow i don't know oh own it with me all right maybe it's all of us so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna write the definitive book on joseph uh many chapters whatever it has to be you know we're gonna we're gonna you know everything there is to know about joseph it's going to be in this book and i'm going to ask you to study it and then a year later i'm going to come back i'm going to preach to you about joseph again all right and you have studied every day the book of joseph and so i'm going to preach to you about joseph you've now heard me preach about joseph you've now read the book of joseph because of all of that do you know joseph oh difficult difficult okay so um okay so now's the part where you start throwing things so i need you to throw it above my head and then just don't throw it on my head but above my head you can stay behind me because nobody can see you okay and i just want you to kind of throw that up and down don't stop till i tell you yeah just nice and high get it up there okay do you all see i have i have you didn't see anything there except for maybe a box of kleenexes so i have preached you about joseph you have read the book of joseph do you all see the the kleenex box rising and falling behind me do you know what causes that that is the power of joseph the power of joseph is in this room today to move a kleenex box up in the air and again and again and again and again the power of joseph is in this room you've pr i preached to you about him you've read about him you've seen his works do you know joseph okay you can stop throwing that around now thank you appreciate that okay no don't go anywhere do not go anywhere do not go anywhere all righty all righty can i use you now is that all right are you like really super shy and quiet yes he is okay maybe i shouldn't use you because you want to come up no not really okay all right we'll just use your sister that's your sister right yeah come on yeah yeah what's your name abby all right lovely that's nice

sister it ain't happening what if he gives you some broccoli isn't that yeah it wouldn't help me either anyway all right so um you guys see each other you've shaken hands yeah yeah do you do you know joseph have you met him you've met this this young man i've preached to you about you saw his works and and you've read his read the book and like you met him now right i mean this guy you're like yeah but i won't hug you so i mean that's something right so okay joseph you can sit down now yeah so at this point you've actually met him so i just yeah so abby um have you met joseph you have yeah um i don't think you really have see joseph he doesn't really exist he's just he's just something people think about and they they want to feel good and they need strength in the hard times so they just they've just created this idea of this guy named joseph he doesn't really exist right i mean you don't really believe in joseph right just just be honest right because you just shook his hand right right you just shook his hand right so just somebody coming to you and saying like yeah this this joseph guy you don't know him and you're like but you're like yeah i just shook his hand though so you're stupid so something like that yeah so you don't really we don't really believe in joseph right yeah nice and loud nice and loud you do why because you met him what are you talking about it was just no you you you ate pizza late at night and went to bed and had this weird dream about this guy named joseph but you didn't really meet him right i mean you really okay tell you what i understand right now it's a little emotional things like that you're very excited about this whole joseph thing so i'm just going to come back in like 10 years and and then i'm going to ask you about this whole joseph thing okay maybe some time we'll just just cure things so okay ten years elapses okay abby so good to see you again how are you good good good hey last time we you know we were talking about this this joseph thing you don't still believe that in joseph right why because i've met him you've met him [Music] crazy how about you you've seen his works you've read his word i've heard heard it preached over and over and over and over again rebecca how old are you 26 26 times 52 weeks a year uh that's a lot uh times well we got it right here this was just uh let's see here rebecca is uh 26 times 52 weeks a year times three services a week uh 4056 if the calculator is correct and i did it right 4056 services that you've been in and now you could say give or take yeah but you know there's special meetings and things like that so you know maybe you weren't always in service three times a week but you were in service more than three times a week other times for 26 years some of you all have been in church that many times some of you have all heard over 4 000 sermons in your life maybe you've even heard over 400 500 tapes maybe you've heard over a thousand tapes god bless you i hope you have but at some point you got to move from i've heard it i've seen it to the same experience that moses has to the same experience that moses has and you say brother trevor i don't know how well well how did they meet they got into the same place one day and ran across each other you say brother trevor but but but i can't just see god walking down the street like that but but does that mean he's not real he's real he's a person and you can meet him and your experience with him ought to be as real as as abby and joseph have met each other because moses had that kind of an experience we need only look at that experience and know that moses actually met god in a different way and at the at the burning bush there on mount sinai and and i can meet god in the same way and that happened because history and archaeology bears it out so if it happened for moses it can happen for me and many many other men and women throughout the bible have done amazing things why because they met god changed the situation amen you see this is the reality of it and what we must have first john 2 3 and 4 you see knowing god changes us it changes our reactions and how we live first john 2 3 and 4 says hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him so when we begin to keep his commandments not just from duty but because we know him yes sir why because keeping his commandments isn't grievous when we know who he is because to know him you understand his character and why he would even ask you to do those things anyway amen hey man so so you know think of it think of it as is as a husband and wife when they meet is that so difficult you know to remember to close the cabinet doors you know when your wife she looks at you and says hey could you please close the cabinet door sure absolutely is that a rule could be do you mind so much not if she'll keep smiling you know it's all good you just keep smiling i'll close the cabinet door everything that's great once you begin to know the person you begin to change yourself why because of love and when you begin to know god god who is love he begins to change you why because of love because you know him because you've experienced him and because because now there's something there that's like oh this one this one who is so great i long to serve him because i like to be near him and i like to please him i like him to just keep smiling so yes i'll close the cabinet door metaphorically speaking in my life you understand amen from that time brother branham says this didn't only change moses it changed israel it changed egypt it changed the world at that time because one man met god and took him at his word one man met god and took him at his word changes the entire world amen there's a man in history by the name of felix and he was uh he was in uh 303 a.d and he was martyred and you could find the story in in fox's book of martyrs and felix was was um a roman priest the brother of another priest and he was ordered to sacrifice to the gods and so he was brought before the prefect to the temples of serapis mercury and diana but at the prayer of the saint the idols fell shattered to the ground he was then led to execution so here's this man he's he's being persecuted and told that if he doesn't sacrifice before these gods they're going to kill him and so what he does is he's brought in this temple and he begins to pray and before this saint of god these idols fall on the way to his execution an unknown person joined him professed himself a christian and also received the crown of martyrdom the christians gave him the name atticus the latin word for added and they were both beheaded you say well brother trevor what are you talking about well this man met god because he came into a place that was very stressful there was a lot of things going on there was a lot of pressure you can live or you can die it just depends on whether or not you're gonna be true to this whole jesus christ thing so you make your decision and this man knows god he's met god that there wasn't even a decision for him there was there didn't even have to be stress there for him because he knew god he knew the i am you want to kill me okay i mean you know i'd prefer to live but you know death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory my desire is to depart but maybe being here is more needful why because he met god and it changes how you think it changes everything about you and this man then just prays to god and the idols fall before him and it changes the course of another man's life and maybe god is asking you to get to know him in such a way that it changes the course of the people around you maybe even through times of great pressure how you react and how you respond saying brother trevor yeah i got to work on my reactions no you've got to meet god amen that'll work on your reactions just fine amen brother branham says and why christ speak moses born and then he was afterwards he was brought to a place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver the people yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about but something he'd seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to hit my how that did bring things to life and that's what it's we've got to do we've we've got to have that coming to life experience in our life how does that how does that happen you've got to get into the presence of god you've got to see you've got to see him and brother trevor how do you see him like i said we can't go walk down the road and meet him i mean you know joseph and abby can easily come up to the front of the church and shake hands and get to meet but how do you how do you meet god and we can't physically do that but you can spiritually and it can be just as real as a physical meeting amen so first corinthians chapter 2 verses 10 through 16 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so so we look at it like this like a man knows the things of a man so because you you're man mankind you know mankind things but it takes the spirit of god to know the things of god you know so we think about like a chimp like a chimp doesn't know like a chimp kind of seems like a man but it doesn't really know man things because it doesn't have the spirit of man now we're going to illustrate i've got a video for you today to illustrate this so sister tina if we could play this video of a chimp who doesn't really know the things of man [Music] that was the most edifying video you'll see all week that scripture right there this chimp doesn't know the things of man he doesn't understand music he can't play notes but he can sit there like a man and bang on a piano he's doing a man thing but yet he doesn't understand the things of man he doesn't understand music you could train him maybe even to play amazing grace i don't know like an exceptional chimp maybe you could train him to play that but only reason he could play that is because you could train him not because he understood the words not because he understood the music not because he knew the meaning behind it why he's a chimp doesn't understand the things of man so how are we gonna meet god when the spirit of man knows the things of man well you're gonna need the spirit of god in your life amen and we've been taught all our lives how do you give the spirit repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ come to know him receive the holy spirit in your life but don't just stop there because this this isn't uh you know we we talk about this being a race but you know guess what the the prize is jesus christ the prize is not that i've checked off the three necessary boxes of christian life and now i just do christian things you're it's cheapening it for yourself the prize is him the prize is the i am amen that you could know him that's amazing that's the greatest thing ever if you truly know him to receive him man he is your reward i am your exceeding and great reward amen so we continue on the scripture for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god we have received the spirit that we might know john chapter 8 verses 42 to 43 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father will you do why couldn't they hear him because they had the wrong birth i had the wrong birth a new birth brings us into the knowledge of who jesus is and and brings us to a place where we can know him where we can know him amen brother branham in the church age book speaking on the scriptures that we we just read there in first corinthians putting these verses together we see there's only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age and what it is one special group that receives the revelation for each age that group is of god because the group that cannot hear is not of god as we just read in john the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof is that group described in first corinthians 2 6 through 16. how do we know him the new birth receiving the holy spirit but those things and and and this isn't again this isn't a carrot on the stick it's like receive the holy spirit oh you all receive the holy spirit well let me give you a new challenge now meet god no what we're saying is is the idea is that you would meet god that you would come to know god there's a few steps that get you in line for you to be able to truly know him so the idea isn't go through the steps and you're good the idea is go through the steps that because you want him because you want to know him and now we can what i'm saying is that we can look at experiences throughout history we can look at moses and john sheridan different things and understand that that meeting god caused a just huge changes in people's lives that's what i want in my life i want to sit there through my trial of pain for three months and know that god truly does heal and have the confidence that man he could just heal me like that but even if i'm sitting there saying by his stripes i'm healed and saying it gritted through my teeth because it hurts so bad but it doesn't matter to me but it doesn't shake my faith because i'm sitting there and i know god and i know who he is and i can come before him in faith bringing my request to him but maybe he's asking me to go through that trial to see do you know me you think you know me but maybe you this trial will show you whether or not you really you really know me or not maybe this trial will show you where your faith might lack or this or that does the trials of life do they hinder you do they shake you do they you know there's there's there's i just hope to say this at a young people's conventions someday because i've seen it so often you know there's there's young sisters that you know they they believe the message as long as as long as god will send them a message young man to marry but after a few you know years and coming into mid-20s if that that hasn't happened hey hey the message got to go because i need to get married and the proof didn't happen until it was until it was too late why would why would you why would you sit there and serve god for so long and then oh okay it's come to the end of my robe i need to get married can't find the right message guys so i'm gone like you've just been wasting your life you haven't really even been in the message whatever that means that should mean that you know god that you serve god you you know him and you met him and and this is the word that he's brought to us today this is exactly how he wants us to live not that it's changed anything it's just that we got actually got the revelation of how it always has been that's what it should be and it should bring us to a place where we know him and we serve him and obey him because we know him not because i'm just doing what's right because this is how i was raised and as long as everything works out for me and the you know and i get to you know have the right marriage and the right children and the right this is if as long as all the things i want fall into place with this whole religion thing then yay that's you know like i'm just there's there's people that actually do this there's people that actually think this this people that actually live this experience and it blows my mind because you've totally missed the point because you never met god that's not what it's about it's not what it's about it's about jesus christ we don't need to has this been simple has this been just just a foundational thought yes yes it has you know i i don't have to go and and preach on the book of redemption which is what i kind of wanted to do but i don't have to preach on that because you know what because god's in all of it amen and and and and we can go we can go and and i love preaching message doctrines as much more than anybody but not to the expense to to to miss justification to miss sanctification to miss the baptism of holy ghost and a new birth like it's not like we've we've gotten past those things because we're in the message no we're in the i am he's all of that and all of that is true now brother branham didn't have to go repreaching all of that he had a platform of pentecost to kind of step onto and and bring some of the deeper things of god in the revelation that that we needed for this day the restoration we need we needed but it doesn't mean that all those things aren't right and look we need all of the word all of it's important because it brings us to him amen to jesus christ the one who died on the cross for your sins and mine but he rose again and he lives and if we can get in the spirit of god we can meet him just as moses met him on mount sinai and just as abby met joseph you can meet jesus christ and it can be that real and that powerful for you that's what god wanted to say to somebody here today musicians can come can we pray let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord you are the great i am you are wonderful and you are everything lord we long to be in the presence of god to know you lord jesus there's there's not a one of us father that wants any of this to be all in vain in our lives but lord if we're going to be believers or we want the reality of it we don't want you just in letter form but we want to come to life oh god we want an experience with you we want to know you lord jesus we'll focus on you get our eyes on on you oh god and no other too often we just have our eyes on me and what can this message do for me and how can god how can you make my life better and lord our attitude should be how can we bring you glory how can my life bring you glory how can my life serve you father i know we'll never do that unless we meet you truly moses wouldn't have ever taken over egypt without truly having an experience of knowing you lord he brought much glory to your name father we want to know you we want to meet you we want to dwell in your presence lord we lord i i don't preach one time at the church back home lord about having coffee with you lord and lord how different that is not just sitting there in the morning reading the bible with a cup of coffee but lord having as if lord i was sitting across the coffee table from you lord and you and i were sipping coffee together having a conversation father that's how real i want my experience with you to be father i believe that's what you're calling us unto the lord why would we lord that's what we want in the millennium we want to know you and speak with you there why wouldn't we want to know you and speak with you here we can have that lord your prophet said we're living so far below our privileges and the skies are full of the heavenlies lord and we we we we're just looking for the scraps oh god but yet there's so much goodness that you want for us father if we could just get our eyes on you increase our walk with you lord increase our prayer life lord jesus to know you more i love you lord i just pray that this little sermon has impacted someone and helped draw on someone closer to you maybe open someone's eyes to see that they've maybe just become disillusioned a little bit or got their eyes on the wrong things maybe they're good things but just kind of forgetting that it's all about you lord i just pray that we're all refocused on you lord grant it father let your word accomplish the thing that you sent it to do we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] um [Music] lord [Music] [Applause] near o blessed lord to the cross where thou hast down [Music] blessed lord [Music] i [Music] thy love [Music] rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee [Music] without bless the lord [Music] oh god drove me dearer [Music] yay bleeding side to thy precious oh god i want to be drawn closer [Music] let's give the lord a hand to praise place my how we appreciate the word of the lord amen on today i think one of the things that really just really struck me as brother trevor was just using the different examples of asking different people to do different things and you know it gives brother sway there and it says would you clown climb mount everest with me it's like i'll do all these other things but when i get to mount average mount everest that might be a little bit too much but had it been god himself asking a question like that it would have meant something different and often times you know we come as ministers we preached the word of god and you know as i was sitting there listening to man so many people need to hear this because sometimes we think it's just the pastor asking it's just the preacher saying that but when god himself comes to you and and requests something out of his work for you then it has a different feel it has a you know a different result so you know you can only do things as god speaks to you and as god gives it to you so brother we appreciate that amen on today meet god meet god hallelujah and and you know i i sometimes just being pastor you're privy to you know different things and and even just the different people he used for the different examples everything was done because god needed to be done a certain way today just to encourage a few people in their walk with christ uh you know i love the way he did sister abby she could not be shaken no matter how much brother trevor said she couldn't be shaken because she knew she had met joseph and amen and you ought to you ought to have the same type of testimony not be shaken by what the devil bring to you because you know you've met jesus hallelujah and ain't nobody gonna take that from you so amen we appreciate the word of the lord let's have a word of prayer amen and we'll prepare a man um just to dismiss the service i do need to have a meeting amen with you all um and uh so we'll just just just quickly have this meeting amen but i want to dismiss the service so we can dismiss those that are joining us online so let's have a word of prayer father we thank you uh for the word that has come to our ears today we've felt your presence your anointing it's been good to be in church and god just did to hear this sermon about meeting you how important it is to meet you we've we've heard about you we've been in church for years but god really coming to a spot where we can say that we've met you that's got to be the most important thing lord at the top of our list so i pray that as we're entering into this new year that this would be something that we would go home and really meditate on god we we want to know that we've met you and when we meet you lord we fall more in love with you everything that you request and everything that you require god we don't have problems your words are not in your commandments not grievous amen there are things that we do because we absolutely love you we want to serve you we want to please you thank you for both uh brother zion and brother trevor just coming father this weekend and delivering their hearts to us and god these are messages that would just cause us to grow closer to you and we just appreciate it oh god i pray your blessings upon both of them that you would continue to use them for your glory what a privilege it is lord for father amen and son to just go out and the whole family god just how you use them all in their various ways and lord i just pray that you just continue to use them for your glory keep them as they travel the dangerous highways the other churches that they'll visit while they're uh on this journey acts that you would bless them abundantly father and may you continue to be glorified and magnified watch over the saints keep us all until we're able to come together again on wednesday night
