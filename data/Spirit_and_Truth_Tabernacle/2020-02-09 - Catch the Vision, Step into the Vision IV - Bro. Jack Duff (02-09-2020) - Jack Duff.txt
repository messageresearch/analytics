brother I mess up everybody name so I'm sorry I repent amen but it's good to have you in the household Lord this morning and sister Rachel Bennett god bless you it's good to have you in the house of the Lord this morning praise the Lord and our precious sister back in the bag it's good to have you here this phrase along phrase law much brother Quinton a man says he has a testimony for healing this morning so we want to give him a little space for that phrase what god bless you brother Quinton [Music] amen god bless you I just want to thank the Lord for His grace and his power and this trusts allowing us to trust in him I guess the last Monday had started having problems with tooth haven't paying very scruciating pain and I went to the dentist on Wednesday and on Wednesday Dennis told me that I needed over have a root canal and so in the midst of that he gave me a referral so I was kind of trying to find someone to do that but it like from Wednesday up until even this morning every morning it seems like I mean I've been on some taking antibiotics and some painkillers different ones oxycodone and ibuprofen 800 and it works for a while and then it stops and but every morning it seems like around three or four o'clock in the morning the pain it would get very bearable and I would have to get up and I got a couple times I got up and went my prayer closet and I would fight that devil put that pain to go away and by God's grace it by the time I got through praying the pain would go away and and then it would come back and I mentioned it to brother Jack and yesterday and he was like well maybe you should take you that I should probably take my medicine a little bit later at night and maybe that way I helped me get through sleep and I have that pain so I did that last night what a almost three o'clock again here come that devil with that pain and brought it back on and so this morning I was going to was trying to get out because I come to prayer so prayer service in the morning it's 7:00 and I actually got up I got up and I was gonna come at 7:00 but I was just so so weary so tired from having to get up all those different mornings but I just couldn't I didn't have the strength to come in this morning and and so I laid back down or 7 o'clock and and then I kind of woke up about 8 o'clock and finally I got up at 4:00 I mean 8:30 and when I got up I I noticed I didn't feel any pain it was before it was before that time I even days I would just touch my my side here and every pain I try to bike down just in the back you know just just pain pain all the time and I thought I said Lord it happened between 7 & 8 I believe and I know the Saints were just praying for me this morning and I know Lord you heard their prayers and and brother branham's speaks of that we have to have faith for divine healing and and I lo I was a repenting to the Lord to help me to have that faith Lord because we have to have that faith to take a rapture and I was repenting I said Lord helped me to have it helped me to have that faith Lord God for divine healing that I will not even be able to I will not even have to have a root care now no medicine no nothing and so I was feeling pretty good I talked to my mom and I told her the testimony and she was praising the Lord I was praising the Lord and I was trying I Khloe I'm gonna tell it I'm we're gonna have give the testimony this morning but then when I came into the church that devil came back he came back and I remember brother Branham said that when you get your healing it could be worse and so I was been trying to remember the words of a prophet and hang on to what God said and what God promised and so from between now and then pain has started to go away again and I think and I just want to ask you to help me to have that strength that faith Lord for divine healing that God will take it away and Olivia complete testimony that the goodness of the God he's the same God yesterday today and forever he can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and I thank the Lord so much for what he's done for me and I'm claiming my healing right now and even today I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God and I claim it by the grace of God it Almighty God thank you a man he's able is there anything too hard for God no praise the Lord Amen will you give me the announcement sister

we got to sister Rachel's here at David this is sister Rachel sister Brown's daughter and a man we think God's so good to see you sister Rachel a man on today in a magnetar this being and family coming out to support brother Timothy and a man I would just appreciate his testimony it's been good brother man and you know and it's good that I was just kind of chatting with him he just told me I don't live the same life I used to live and do the things I used to doing as desired want to serve the Lord and you know and just follow in the path of God and you know we want to do everything we can to strengthen him come alongside of him and just keep them leaning up the right way a man that God would just kind of carry over forward from there but brother Timothy we certainly appreciate you coming to be in fellowship here at spirit and truth Tabernacle now god bless you god bless you amen just real quick before we just get into the sermon I shall be seated just be seated just for a second be seated for a second I want to rush through this I want to just kind of make a quick announcement we were here at prayer the brothers I want to say a month ago that we came on a Tuesday night and we were here and that particular night and I wanted to mention because of because I think what happened at Tuesday night this is why brother Quentin has been kind of going through the devil didn't like what happened that Tuesday night and you know so that that Tuesday night I remember brother Quentin he just kind of shared with me how he was just praying and you know fasting you know that day before he even came to prayer and you know he told the Lord I don't want to eat after prayer that's that's when I want to eat and I think God for things like that right and instead I don't want to eat until after prayer and he says you know so he came in kind of with an expectation and he began to seek the Lord in prayer and and he just got really really caught up and there's some brothers who that's that's witnesses amen to this but he got caught up and the Lord just began to anoint him and he began to speak in tongues and you know he got so full he had to just pull away from the brothers you know we had to just pull away just y'all keep praying but I'm praying over here and and you know and he just began to just just the Lord was just dealing with a mess that's a gift that God has given him and you know so he just was praying and and and the Lord just kept dealing with him and he just was just worshiping and praying and and and he was praying that he was having he was in his all world and the other president of the world and we were just having a wonderful time in the Lord so you know at the end of the prayer you know we were preparing to leave and then brother quake who made the statement he says brother Jack the Lord spoke to me tonight and and and I just felt led to tell you that we need to get prepared because the church is about to grow and he says we know we need to get ourselves some some cards that we can hand out to people to invite them to church you know that we're not necessarily trying to go get folk that go to another church and pull them in tie Church is people that don't go to church nowhere that needs to go to church right and what we want to do is try to reach them amen we need to you know we need to live a life a bleep brother troll was saying that last week that we can live a life in such a way to make people so thirsty come on somebody make them so thirsty that they don't they realize that this life that we live in the abundant life is the best life that you could ever live hey man look let me tell you something being a Christian don't make you immune from problems right you gonna have some problems and let me let me tell you something else you're gonna have problems as a Christian and you're gonna have problems when you're not a Christian it's just that when you're a Christian you got somebody to help you with your problem it's good to know that you can dependable Jesus right and you know so you know that they were brother Quakers said I just feel impressed to say we need to get ready we need to get some cards ready and invite people to church you know because God is getting ready to go to church and and as I got away you know that night I begin to reflect a little bit more on him and I said what I felt happened is that brother quake who was interpreting what brother Quentin actually you saying right that's what that's what I felt happen right and also I say the Lord knows how to do things I say brother quick coup it I'm glad you said that I say you know there was a sister the Lord blessed us with and I still call her partner's family sister reliant and since the reliant years ago had put together look hard a church invite card so I said real quick cuz this what she was kind of thinking about and he looked at her he's like yeah brother I say well the cyst had already done it years ago but we hadn't done anything with it so I took it to FedEx and I made us some little cards right and in these little cards these little cards are an invitation that you can give to people to invite them to church and only it says witness by that's just a real on put that base that's where you put your name where you witness to somebody come on somebody and then your contact information so they can get in contact with you when they want to come to church praise the Lord you give me a telephone number now you know use wisdom if we got a young sister we're listening witnessed into some single man you might not want to give me a telephone number use wisdom tell them to call the number that's on the car Amen praise a lot if we got a young brother witness into a single sister oh you ain't married she ain't married you don't want to give him your number Kantar say hey baby you want to tell the car the number on the car we want to keep the devil out of it now right praise God you get you got a wife a man giving this to another married man maybe you want to put your husband's number we got a husband giving this to the married woman maybe you want to put your wife's number all right praise the Lord I thought we keep the devil light amen but but we have these and I put them out on the table and we're just moving by inspiration a man moving because the Spirit of Lord told us that night that the church is scary to grow and we want to be ready so we got these cars made and they're sitting on the table so you can just take a few and and I would expect everybody to grab at least a couple God gonna lead you to somebody to witness to a man you run into people all the time you know and you know I was just out yesterday and and and I walked into a little restaurant and they grab something to eat and I saw this little boy young man I shouldn't say little boy at a young man come up and he was trying to get a job I had the restaurant and and I watched how he sat there and just waited waited for somebody to see him and nobody came and then finally saw this lady walked by me said is there a manager that I can talk to and and she happened to be the manager and so he began to talking and and come to find out it's over hearing a little conversation he was he had come the day before and said four hours nobody talked to him now he come back the next day and instilled nobody talking to him you know and and so she she asked him said what's your experience they say I ain't got not ain't got none I don't have no experience and I said I'm just looking for a chance and and she said Oh care to wait I'm gonna be back in the office on such-and-such a day and you can come can see me so you know she left and I said did you get the job he said I don't know she told me to come back and see him and I said well I said I appreciate you coming and being faithful to come here to try to get this job I say somebody gonna give you an opportunity and then they say you think I can get one with a felony I said well I don't know if they can but I do know this much that with a felony you don't have to limit you and say there's other ways to get work so you can actually start yourself in LLC by going to some business or work and you start your own business you become an entrepreneur and say they're not hiring whatever your name is the felony they hire your business as a so you just got to think a little bit outside the box and I say you go to church anywhere he said no sir I said man you need to go to church get connected with people that could help you kind of you know stay positive in everything I said because what's gonna happen is that if you don't find a job they're gonna be pulling you to the streets all right you don't want to go that route I say get connected so I said you know I said reach like I said you go to churches you can go to you say what's your name I say my name Jack if you just looking at the car you see Jackie but God God presents opportunities everywhere for you to just be able to share with somebody and just invite them right so so Church let's be let's be open to that and and you know the reason I feel like we're even still here we're apt to Bend unpack we should we should have been unwrapped a long time ago that's my feeling anyway but the reason we still here is because there's still some predestinated seat somewhere that has not heard this gospel and it's our job to reach them say man it's our job to reach them praise the Lord is that Alright hey man so just don't forget that I want to also just thank God for all the brothers a man last week appreciate brother Solomon stepping in and handling the the son school class for me you know we were way last week and a man and then brother Troy handling the the preaching of the word we appreciate Amen hem and just the thought that the Lord laid upon his heart just to bring a men to our hearts very very very grateful a man for for the help that God has given us here at the church praise the Lord Amen and certainly we are preparing ourselves for next weekend and just under expectation for what the Lord has in store for us and and I pray that y'all come on the expectation I mentioned this before I mentioned it again expect the devil to batter you a man as we are making preparation to get ready for next week Amen just expect all kind of battles from the enemy and you know but we expect victories as well amen in the midst of everything that we're going through God is a good God and man I heard brother Tinashe was in the house god bless you brother

a son in his old age at the set time which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto Him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading

just give back to them one hundred for all the saints that have come to the house of the Lord today God let us all hear something from heaven we don't want to hear from from just a man but we want to hear from God today so speak to every heart draw us closer to your father through your word we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise this in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated praise the Lord amen we are continuing our journey a man with this catch division and then step into it we just want to remind you a man of a couple things this thought is coming from a testimony of a brother Evans a man and brother Evans had his had a car stolen from him hey man this man somehow got in test drove the car and took off with the car and a man and didn't bring it back and pretty much thought he had got away with it I want to tell you something wherever the devil has stole from you maybe the devil thought he got away for it got away with it but when you catch division and step into it you're gonna get your stuff back hey man you you'll get your joy back you'll get your peace back you get your money back man you get whatever the devil is taken from you that's you know that's not the will of God for him just to take from you like that a man useful to recover all praise the Lord somebody you get your relationship back you whatever it is that the devil took from you get it back praise the Lord so you know brother Evans a man was was was there was concerned about this and just didn't know how things were gonna happen but then you know somehow God out for somebody to find where this man was and and they come back in eight oh brother they ever said a man lives in Bowling Green you know and they said well you know Bowling Green say alright so brother Evans never thought anything about it and and then God showed the Prophet a vision of going through Bowling Green and brother Evans actually getting his money back but brother Branham did not come out specifically and tell brother Evans that you're gonna get your money back he didn't tell him that he just told him we're going to Bowling Green he says actually going through Bowling Green we're on our way to Florida and we're gonna go through Bowling Green and brother Evans say okay I said that's 30 miles out of the way I don't see why because I'm thirty miles out of the way we go on the Florida you know that's just wasting time rather than have that type of attitude he just kind of kept ponder and say wait a minutes happened take at it brother branham didn't you say we was going through Bowling Green he said yes he said brother branham that man that got the car for me he lives in Bowling Green he said yes and he say say say if it was you you know brother branham if it was you what would you do if you was going through Bowling Green would you go get your money you say brother Evans I'd go get my money hallelujah glory to God it's time for you to go and get some things that the devil took from you and i'ma tell you you came wait for the devil to bring it to you you gonna have to go take it from him the same way he took it from you come on somebody catch the vision and did step into it he say brother if it was me I'd go get my money brother ever said going up here I got his address we going to get the money knocked on a man's dough and he got the money from the man glory to God but that he had to catch the vision first before he stepped into it we brought to you a man a couple of other things and hallelujah I brought to you just the the story of Lazarus and how he died a man and when it once he once he died Jesus already knew that Lazarus was gonna rise again Jesus by vision knew exactly when to go when they call for Jesus to come and a man and he'd never showed up because you know they had confidence and that had Jesus got there before Lazarus died that Lazarus would have never experienced death hallelujah and sometimes Amen that's the way we feel we we won't we won't God to come on the scene at a certain time because amen it would block the person from going through a particular thing Lazarus would have never received death but God has something greater in mind praise God I want to encourage you this morning amen no matter what you're going through you might feel like God has not made it on time he has something greater in mind hallelujah and what he had greater in mind for Lazarus imma let him experience death but I'm I also do something that they never seen before they might believe in it but they never seen this before I'm gonna raise them from the dead hallelujah so when he goes there to Lazarus grave and and and Martha separating herself from a certain atmosphere she says she say Lord I know you didn't come when we wanted you to come but even now I believe that whatever you ask God you can have it he made it I believe the Holy Spirit say even now whatever you ask God you can have it oh yeah Martha declared her faith a man and even even though American get herself out of the atmosphere he still told Martha Mary on your part of this vision now and say y'all gonna have to do something before I do something say roll the stone away when they got the stone rolled away and all them strong men around somebody else could've rolled a certain way but no they had to be a part of this hallelujah they they couldn't depend on nobody a damn part in the vision what's the role that stone away and that might be your part role that doubt away role that fear away from giving what you're supposed to get from God roll away please let God have his way they roll the stone away and then Jesus did something there then the vision finally manifests itself he says Lazarus come forth and when Lazarus come out that grave a man walking the minute he had been gone for four days came out of the grave walking what a powerful powerful a man demonstration of Almighty God at that moment only God can raise the dead he meant only God could be in Christ doing that and you know and and and and you know so here we saw them that was once they was take off the vision then they stepped into it and they enjoyed the blessings of it glory to God let's go on a little further Amen hallelujah now our last time we come I brought to you a man the story of Mary a man but I want to just read a couple quotes ears we set this up and then we'll go a little further and I'm pulling from Genesis but we want to go back and get to Mary just for a little bit and then we'll get back to Sarah but I want to start here in the message pergamene church H because this vision that I'm talking about you catching a man is stepping into it is a much greater vision a man then just common 20/20 vision what people are talking about today 20/20 vision is very normal a man is very natural for just about everybody got it a man and those that don't have it then we just use glasses to help us get a look closer to it right but but everybody as normal vision we we all want just normal vision a man we what we want supernatural vision praise God we want to step into something a little higher than what everybody else got we're not trying to be like everybody else we actually want to be different hey man I want all that God has for me I don't want to miss that in this hour amen I don't want to miss it naturally nor do I want to miss it spiritually praise the Lord Amen I thank God for all the natural blessings but I'm certainly looking for all the spiritual blessings to be poured out as well so so here we're talking about you know because it's very easy for a person to kind of get up a collar I got a vision I got a vision God gave me an idea guy yeah I mean that's good that I bless you here but will that get you out of here huh I mean that that vision that you got for your own personal self will that get you out of here praise the Lord let me tell you something I don't care how great your job is I don't care how big your title is on the job if something would have happened to you right now they replace you in no time and that title will go to somebody else so there's a greater vision than your natural vision we gotta step into what we call spiritual vision we gotta see what God's vision is for us and I want to tell you his ways are higher than our ways as thoughts amen are greater than our thoughts so glory to God we want to step into the saw the vision that I'm presenting to you it's a vision that the angel had concerning you before you were even born I hope that doesn't go over your hand the angel had this vision for you before you were even born can I tell you another thing that angel of God has a vision and I don't know angel God and God himself has a vision of Mary before she was even born amen when God said a virgin would conceive God already knew who the Virgin was and no matter how many virgins amen try to you know make like they were pregnant and that make as if they were the fulfillment of that many virgins will step out and give testimonies about I'm pregnant a man I am the Virgin s conceiving and they would step up and tell everybody how they were gonna fulfill Isaiah's words but nothing would happen to them amen and there's been many churches the Prophet said it this way churches churches but there has to come one that will be the fulfillment of the manifestation I don't care how many churches don't think they could claim these things but there has a man we have come to a time where the church is stepping to the vision that God had for Mary Mary was the one that God had in his mind it took 700 years before she was produced on the earth a man but yet she was the one that God said she gonna fulfill this and there was something spoken about you before you even were born an angel told the Prophet pick up your pen and write pick up your pen and write and say this message that I'm gonna write it's for the church and here I can say 60 years later this message is now coming alive and this is the vision that I'm trying to get us to step into let's read a little bit Amen about this vision here in pergamene church age one night I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as I grasped the pen to write his Spirit gave me a message for the church I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride oh it has to do with the word and the bride there's a lot I could say there a man but this this this this message that I'm reading this for the word and the bride Oh hallelujah says here's what I'm trying to say to you there will who's trying to say to see the Holy Spirit God Himself the Lord Himself is trying to say something to you pretty much you say will you stop and give this will you will you shake yourself from your condition in your situations your circumstances will you hear what I'm trying to say to you hallelujah God didn't bring you to church just to be a church can we even just go to the natural just for a little bit when a man is out seeking a bride amen he's not just trying to find somebody just for just for comfort sake and I know this man was very well somebody's gonna be data to communicate with them to share his ideas amen - amen this is the stretch through this union that he will be able to express himself and have children huh I mean already has in his mind one day I want a child hello everyone down I want a little boy I want a little girl and here we got all these all these aspirations in the only way he's supposed to get that done is through a prize the only way he's supposed to reproduce himself is true applies come on somebody this is a perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ the only way Christ will produce himself is to a bride [Applause] - right right amen not not nothing he got Christ and got girlfriends he ain't got no side chicks come on somebody many gay you got apply somebody daddy put a ring on it boy to god somebody younger Batman he better put no ring on you better get away from that young man praise the Lord glory to God but by the only way he could produce himself was through a prides and he chose you when a man chooses a woman that he's going to marry he's saying pretty much say everybody else I'm sorry I'm sorry I found everything I need I found it in her and I'm gonna stand before the church and I'm gonna tell everybody this is the one I'm pledge of my love - hallelujah glory to God you see how it breaks the mold right when we do things outside of the word it breaks the mold of what God had in this word right when we're children are born outside of the mold it breaks the mold of what God had in store hallelujah young people keep yourself keeping yourself wait for God to give you your mate praise the Lord somebody right this is important you you got to understand the types and the shadows that come with the Word of God hallelujah glory to God there's a greater vision here it's a greater vision right so so so when we look at this Christ was not just looking for people to come to church when when he started dealing with debt with your heart it wasn't for you just to be sitting on him on a seat in the church he was looking for something greater than that I'm looking for a woman a so a spiritual woman that I can put my put the ring on it what ring - ring the wedding band of grace oh I want to give a wedding banner grace and I might as well tell you this while I have you there do you realize that before you were even born you came to the earth with the wedding band already on that's why you can stay in tune our nation's that's why you couldn't stay in the world you something begin to deal with their heart you had to come because you already had that wedding band on a commitment was already made for you before you even got here and can I tell you something else it one just made for you you had already made a commitment before you got here you've already made a commitment that's why I got don't waste this time on nobody God already knew where soon as this word crosses your path you're gonna say yes will you marry me I will will you forsake all others I will will you forsake the things of the world that's what happened when you stand a man to give you a heart to the Lord Jesus you said I'm leaving everything else back and I'm standing with him now when he gives when he receives a wife he has a desire he wants to produce children I'm talking spiritually now he may he wants to produce he actually was I could put it this way he wants to reproduce himself and that's where you come in the only way this work doesn't get done is through you so this is more than just being a church member this is actually being bright bright bright now let's read this because this message was for the word Amen it has to do with the word and the bride this message that the angel was speaking has something to with the word and the bride listen this is important to me because I realized that even as the bright sometimes we don't understand the word sometimes we don't understand the words we're in we can we can be identified ourselves as the bride but we're not catching Amen what the word is doing hallelujah I mean can I know i'ma get to some of these quotes but as it comes to me I just want to give it to you is that Alright but you know the men I mean Sarah was going through changes all the time and you know Sarah laughed at the promise which he first received it God Himself spoke to Sarah and she was laughing at the promise I got good news I don't care how much you doubt I don't care how much you disbelieve what's being spoke to you hey man I told you this before and i'ma tell you this kid God ain't playing games when he's releasing sermons like this to you you can go to any church and hear any sermon but to come to this church and hear this sermon I'm telling you God he playing no games God got a purpose for speaking these things to you I don't care you might say man I don't I'm getting it I ain't getting like it I don't know well Lord that's just going way over my head just keep sitting there that's maybe maybe it's got to be that way for you amen in order for you to come back because we're not just trying to appease your flesh I come from the church buddy we split what he used to hold her ear and sing the sermon and the reason they had to sing the sermon because they wasn't saying nothing let me tell you something and when I read the Bible I can't see Jesus yeah I can't see Jesus doing none of that he just preached the word and when that word struck the food on the inside that's what produces a change in the people [Applause] we're not here to entertain we're here to get people ready for a rapture please God glory to God I had my sham entertainment in church I don't want more of it man can sing like I don't know what I can't live like nothing we don't need that no more we want people that can preach it and live it if you don't reach it praise God but here you know you know Sarah was laughing at it but here God went over the top of all her laugh and all her unbelief and they still manifest himself in Sarah and I want to tell you that God's going over the top of your unbelief your doubt and he's still gonna manifest himself through you because this message is father amen it still has to do with the word and the bride other thing about Sarah that I found out is that Sarah had already been experienced in changes before she came to the manifestation of Isaac before she actually produced the promised son she had already gone through changes Abraham himself had already gone through changes amen I'm trying to say I'm sharing it with you because you don't realize it but the Word of God is changing you right now the Word of God is not going to change you in the future the Word of God is changing you right now that's why you dress different that's why you speak different that's why you think different that's why you are different because the Word of God you are being washed by the water of the word and that one is changing you right now that's why you can't get away from the fellowship in the word after you in the bring you back man you got a hitch to get a tow package before you start filling wait you're going in this direction and you start feeling a little bit of weight what is that wearing me down making me want to turn and go back you get a tow package a spiritual tow package and we send the word to hitch to your tow packet [Applause] no matter where you go you'll come back this world has got a boomerang effect [Applause] when I got an expectation it's got to come back [Applause] [Music] glory to God it's gotta come back I think I gonna worry about it it's got to come back hallelujah thank you Jesus the world is changing you they may not a man not a woman but the Word of God is changing you in order to get you ready for a rap to the word it's gotta change him it was the word that changed Mary the word may Mary pregnant the word did it to Mary I'm gonna always Shetty with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came on top of the word that the angel gave up hallelujah so when the Holy Ghost is moving in the church you understand it's here to make the word come to pass it's not just for good shout stop for a good show it's not just to get under your emotion but this is a producer changing your life I'm not gonna look like the world I'm not gonna talk like the work I'm not gonna act like to where I'm a citizen of another Kingdom praise God praise God thank you very much oh thank you my brother it got me that cuz I was losing my voice but cold water would take more money let's just read a little bit I want to get this to you hey man this distance this this has to do with the word in the bright it goes on the stateís here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species yes sir thank you each species a man brings forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 111 and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seat came forth into a plant a man this is a this is you if you can just look at it it's a process the seed get quicken the seed become a plan but as a plant it's not producing the fruit Sam I suggest plants we're not producing fruit but I got good news for you plant if you stay underneath the presence of the s/o in you keep getting moisture your plant will eventually produce fruit in a produce so much fruit that you'll get to pour it like mama got - I'm ready to cut the tree down it's so much fruit I can't take no more this fruit hallelujah the tree stop overtaking the house hallelujah put it spiritually hey man God he gonna cut you down and then he wants you to bear he wants you to bear in another thing by God he wanna plant you near a good source you want to know that source and he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of living water brought his fruit gonna bring forth in his season now that's not your season that's his season and in order to say I also say the leaf will not wither you know what that means to me I'm not gonna go through fall and winter in summer I still always be springtime because my leap will never wither Oh hallelujah my leaf ain't going with my barrel ain't gonna go empty my cruise ain't goin dry I told y'all we gotta get these things this is this is where we supposed to be and I'm you gotta you gotta say man I'm saying it's my revelation my leaf with night wizard my Barrow will not go empty my cruise won't run dry my Baker County gonna be empty my body gonna be set free from disease I don't plan on getting sick I'm not accepting no packages that the devil sent into my address I'm gonna live in freedom and that's it all in my life brother when people get revelations like this the devil don't know what to do with them glory to God all right Amen look he says the little seed is in itself did I get that let the earth bring forth grass the herb you let's see the fruit tree yielding fruit after sky whose seed is in itself upon everything it was so whatever life was in the sea came forth into a plant and Vince into fruit so we come in there this is where we hit this is where we are the very same law applies to the church today what ever see started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed what you saw in Jesus we should see in us if you go into a church and they not trying to produce that something wrong they got the wrong seed man what was in Jesus is supposed to be in the church today this is where reproducing himself is all about glory to God we got work to do don't get caught up in the things of the world we got work to do listen says whatever seat started a church will come forth and be like the originally caused it's the same seat in these last days a true bright Church Christ seat will come to the headstone and this is this is powerful to me I say a mantis she will be the super Church you you see our people so infatuated with Superman and all these comic super marvels and I mean ever everybody just just just just infatuated with this you want to be I mean who they got Superman back in my daddy hat Wonder Woman I guess you're gonna come back at some point some points a spot she back okay yeah that lets you know I don't go to the movies I don't even watch TV praise the line got time for it Amen I'm watching this word praise the Lord I don't keep up with none of that but I'm telling my my childhood Superman Wonder Woman Spider Man Incredible Hulk Batman now they got all this other stuff that I don't even know who they are where they come from they say it was a Marvel that they had years ago but if they just bring that Iron Man right y'all y'all everybody got something everybody want this supernatural power oh my god they're trying to tap into it the wrong way through their imagination you know the greatest power we heard it yesterday in the quote that brother quick who sent us the greatest powers you can have is the power of the Holy Ghost do you know when you baptize with the Holy Ghost do you know this fire says coming out of amen our China cannot even touch you when you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost [Applause] what's maybe a virus coronavirus coronavirus will not even touch you when you got the back to the Holy Ghost the Baptist the Holy Ghost is your token amen and when the Death Angel passes through the way it's not supposed to touch tones that are underneath the token so with your prayer you are not here not now not today see you ain't you ain't touching me you ain't touching my family you ain't touching no party not today sickening hey I'm talking to my family [Applause] sees us I know they livin right but I'm still applying the token tool you know all we have had to do is just get him in the house [Applause] just bring him in the house and we got some y'all in the house today so I'm a planner talkin to you and Logan a stay in the house don't come out the house pay the house no matter what happened to this city nothing that happened to you and she stood on a promise from some man and those men were representing God that God Himself when the waves begin to fall in Jericho Rahab's house was sitting on top of the wall and God had to I don't know what those men said all the wall coming down but when he got to Rahab's house goes right around her house and that's what the devil don't have to do to your house around my house Hey please calm not here Satan we got the token apply [Applause] hallelujah to the lamb of God that's why we want to be washed in the blood that's what we want to apply the blood it has benefits they may hey man let me keep reading the very same law applies now I got that I got that a man in these last days too true bright Church Christ seat will come to the headstone and she will be the super Church a super race as she nears him she will be this is what an angel sent about you she will be a super Church super race as she nears him I don't get me wrong it's not you know some race trying to be better than another nother race that's not what we talked about as you can see we're mixed of all camel races here so this is a spiritual race any man glory to God a man God did supernatural things with Israel he chose them as his chosen people to reveal himself through to manifest himself - he used Israel that the whole Old Testament most of it dealing with Israel God chose a specific people and it sure it was a type that he's also choosing a specific people today for bride for bride not church members bride you know we you know I got I got one bride in here there's a lot of women in this church but there's only one here that's a bride she get benefits she get benefits hey man I've been married over 25 years and she's got benefits three different rings three different no other sister can claim that but because she's bright see she got yeah I think she hit me at the 10-year anniversary she got me Oh jack okay okay because she's bride I went along with it then it 25 years she got me again because she's bright she get benefits she's the only one that goes home with me you understand she's bright ain't nobody else nobody else should be coming to my house like that hey man don't even trying to do that right but because she's brought she get benefits amen and because you're brought to Christ you suppose I have benefits let me go forward I have not even got to where I want it to be but God knows all things super-race as she nears him they in the bra would be so much like him that they would be even be his very image this is in order to be united with him can people say you look like Jesus or even say this man you act like Jesus that's what they supposed to be saying right his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of Living God denominations cannot produce this it's the wrong seed they reduced their crease in their dogmas mixed with the word thus mongrel I this mongrel eyes and brings forth a hybrid product now let's keep going now remember the the says the law reproduction was to that each speech see bring forth after its own kind and when you're when it's when it's when something is reproducing that means it's having offspring I mean it also means of the word reproduction means had to have offspring it means to produce again amen also means to copy to imitate to multiply so if the law of reproduction amen it's placed upon each and every one of us because the seed that started was God he started this church right so I mean he started his church so that the seed that was supposed to be produces is the life of Christ amen it's supposed to produce again it's supposed to be supposed to be a copy nah I don't know about you but I've made copies I was at the store the other day and so that's where I made these from I make copies I got copies but um while I was in the store there was a lady that come in and made us some copies and and when she made the copies some of the ink was all smeared all over the copy it just didn't look right it didn't look presentable to give to somebody so she so she come to the desk say look I don't even need another machine I'm gonna need my money back because this is not considered a copy are you with me yet look at your life you just came off the copy machine examine yourself this does not look like a copy we don't have to give this thing six because I'm not leaving here paying for that and I'm gonna tell you Jesus didn't die on the cross paid that great price to produce nonsense he won't say exact copies Oh Laurie and I'm not I'm not sure you know why are we waiting on something we need to come into this now we need to conform to this now let's go on let's go on let's go on the first son Adam was spoken word spoken see word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself Adam was given a bride to reproduce himself that's the whole purpose that God gave Eve to Adam to reproduce himself you've been given to Christ to reproduce Christ that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God but she fails she fits she failed by hybridization she calls him to die Oh Lord Eve calls Adam to die I hope y'all get that that's why I tell y'all be careful don't be trying to get your husband's in some position Amen where it might cause him to die spiritually compromising with things Eve compromise with the Word of God and it calls her husband he loved her so much that he went intentionally and did what she did because he knew that she'd be separated from him she was a part of him she knew that he knew that man I won't have him them oh so he intensely went out there and fell in sin with Eve gave up his position hallelujah but it was a perfect type of the Lord Jesus he was sitting in heaven gave up his position to come down to earth and to die for sinful man he was not a sinner but he became sin that we might become his righteousness thank God for that but don't put yourself don't put your husband's position Amen that you might cause him to die spiritually look at this the second son Jesus also a spoken C Word of God was given a bright like as was Adam but before he could marry her she was all she also had fallen she liked Adams wife was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she let the word she died it goes on but from a little group of the true seed of the words God will present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creed's or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfill all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin let me go on a little further the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary hallelujah and I love the way the Angels given a prophet distant pick up your pen and write because the word of promise is coming to you you're not you're not here a man following something creat you're not here following some dogma you're not here following some denominational doctrine but you're here because you agree with God's Word do you realize a change to placing you the data to accepted the message you realize a change happen I remember brother Mike Mike say he come to the church and how brother Hugo was used that day preached the gospel and brother Mike first time in the church for the IRA brought him and him here come Mike IRA and Bobby well I wonder what a combination God God used some situations in brother Mike's old church the cause I'm gonna have to start searching to go somewhere else God used some situations and brother IRAs church thing that caused him to say that and when brother Mike said I'm looking for a church that don't play no games I know how to sing so don't take me to the church that can show me how to sing it I want to go to church that's real and he used some situations and brother IRAs like the provider say I can't take you to my church but I know where to take you and they got in the car and put brother Bobby in the car with him and they drove out to the church and here brother you go preaching that day and brother Mike got so wrapped up he come down to the to the Alton just just just crying out to God the very next Sunday he was on his way to his church got to a certain Street and when he made that turn the Holy Ghost was direct of him and from that day he made that turn he never went back to that other church again only to visit someone's got to get to a point where we make a turn and when we make the turn we also making a decision that I'm not going back to where I used to be I'm committed to Christ the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest himself acted at the time of fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the Word of God Isaiah 9:6 He fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her now that was that was that was the big thing there when the angel came to Mary say you are blessed too highly favored so you know there was a promise sitting out there Isaiah 7 and 14 in Genesis 3 and 15 these were things that were spoken about a man a virgin would actually conceive the woman's seed right a virgin conceiving these were promises that were made and God knew in his mind who the Virgin was going to be but when God finally I mean seven hundred years after Isaiah spoke here the word comes searching searching searching searching searching just like a text message through you right now the Word of God has passing through this atmosphere searching for hearts that he could just land on and when he finally got to Mary Mary your highly favored Mary you know say Mary you know you can't have a child and that child gonna be named so how does how does come P I don't even know a man he said the Holy Ghost gonna overshadow you Mary ain't gonna bring this thing to pass say not only is the Holy Ghost overshadow you but I want to tell you know your cousin Elizabeth in a Oh H she's pregnant six months pregnant right now Merritt's say what mayor say being unto me according to thy word and God has been looking for a few people they were just just just yield surrender empty out and say be it unto me God according to your word I brought I was brought here as brought to reproduce you a man that's my whole purpose to reproduce Christ let me tell you something Jesus is greater than anybody that ever lived on this earth I want you to try to read between the lines Jesus is greater than anybody that ever lived on this earth Jesus our attention has got to be on Jesus hallelujah Amen it's all about Jesus my life is about him right amen in him I live I'm moving I have my being it's all in Christ I don't want Jesus just be something on the side I want him to be my everything I want him to be my all and all and no matter what happens in this world is not going to take my attention off Jesus praise the Lord all right Mary said being unto me according to thy word and this is where God has been trying to get us when when when Satan tried to come and present some doubt to Mary brother Branham say Mary shifted out away she should get away hey man you got to shake some things away amen hallelujah she said be it unto me according to thy word and brother Branham saying when she made those words when she made that statement that's what brought the life that's what produced the pregnancy that's what produced the change no feeling no emotion just an agreement with the word can I get somebody to just agree with God's Word every time you say man you agreeing with the word and do you realize your Amen is producing a change in you man I got it I got a statement that and I won't have time to read it all today but Abraham experienced adoption before he experienced receiving the promised son brother Branham say Abraham was adopted when his name was changed he because God Himself was Elohim and he gave Abraham a part of his name when he became Abraham he took on the father's name and that allow Abraham's name on the check [Music] to be as good as a father's name because he had a part of the father's thing and everybody on earth is named after the Lord Jesus Christ oh my my my we got to realize these things already happen in church oh man let me go on I come back and hit that later on let me let me uh this this is a statement this is out of the message Abraham and his seed after him and then I want to just pick up Sarah if I can just for a few minutes and we'll try to bring it on home Abraham and his seed after him let me just read this it says when Abraham's body was changed Sarah's body was changed like it never had been changed before now we all know that when Jesus comes we'll be caught up in a rapture we know our bodies will have to be changed first and it won't have to be just go back to young men and women say that was the first change where I went back to young men when I'm a girl okay II 79 or agree just go back to young men and women so that was the first change that that Sarah and Abraham went through it was a constant change happened this is why I was telling you the word is doing that to us right now so when we're changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it's because the process of change had already started amen Oh y'all don't get that the process of change should already be started it's not like you're just gonna lose everything and just just like that no you should be losing now it's you dropping off for you right now hey man what it says it won't have to be just go back to young men and women but it'll have to be changed because Abraham and Sarah's body had to be changed in a way that they could receive the promised son that's Abraham his body had to be changed to receive the promised son after being justified now again notice he had already had a external change they were already this external change was something that even even a king recognize Sarah at ninety years old at being a young woman a man even a king recognizing the man was praying for a wife he saw 90 year old grandma two up in his town and he said I got to have her for my wife and now what was his purpose for having his wife my eye candy he wanted children reproduction so they say I got a heaven and Abraham lies now there's something in there oh I can't I'm lead out when I'm coming back I'm gonna come back to Abraham lies and say that's my sister he said now he said thank you Lord this man brought his sister down here and he was just praying and thinking God and God say don't you touch that man's wife what wife the man said sister so you better not touch his wife you touch that man's wife I kill you and everybody around here so what'd he say he said not only did I want you not to touch him I want you to take his wife back to him and then I want you to have him pray for you what went back had Abraham pray said this man is Elias no no you're not a liar Oh God say he my prophet he's my prophet I'm trying to get you to see something cuz you are Abraham's seed and your heirs according to the promise I don't care what label that devil has assigned to you you are not that you are who God says you are even in your fallen state y'all ain't got that even in your fallen state you are still a son of God you are still a daughter part your failure does not disconnect you from your father can I say that again your failure does not disconnect you from your father this is a blood relationship place-cards ain't just join the family I was born into this a man a man glory hallelujah look at this look at this he says because Abraham Sarah body had to be changed in a way that they could receive the promised son that's Abraham his body had to be changed to receive the promised son B after being justified sanctify filled with the Holy Spirit called bi-election manifested God of glory in the midst of him and then his body was changed in order to receive the promised son he goes on well the church has come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost gifts manifest it to it and now what the Spirit of God moving in the church doing the same work set Jesus did before he left as a promise and what's the next thing the change the next thing happened Abraham was a changed body now this is something that happened on the inside right there was already an external change we should see the external changes happening now but then there happened to be a change on the inside where now they can reproduce but see it already go he he and her had already gone back to looking like young people again Oh hallelujah there's an external change that took place first in church that's what we're going through the word it's what's doing that right now amen but that same word that produced the external change is the same word it's going to produce the internal change it's not gonna be something that you did it's the spirit that comes on the word that makes it thing happened all right let me let me let me let me try to finish up here says he had to have it the next thing happened Abraham was a change about he had to have it or he never got the Sun and the next thing happens to the church is the rapture will have to be changed and caught up in the air to meet him we can't meet him on earth we've got to go in to the air to meet him it's the coming Sun the promised Sunday man we've looked for him now for hundreds of years he will come someday but the next thing for the church is to be changed we've had every sign justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit placing of a son he said we had that placing of a son manifestation of the Spirit now what the changing of the body for the rapture Church that's where we are and and I'm I don't know about you but I'm under expectation as we stefaned every year we step into new year I'm looking for God they meant to fulfill the promise of a rapture my prayers even so come Lord Jesus I don't know how much more we can take it man you know they they've this virus that broke out in China they got all kind of stories as the hilar virus broke out one unreal strange to me say the people is eating bats that's a nice soup and that's how the virus broke out really all of them all of them had bats I don't know about you if I was in chairman they put a bat in my soup and I think people in China got got the same you know mindset that I have no I'm not eating that but they're they'll bring it on something like that but others say the government released something germ warfare [Music] it was germ warfare and a prophet tells us that only those that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be immune from germ warfare only those that's why you better make sure you got the token man brother Branham preached that we heard it on Friday night and at the end of the service say some of y'all think y'all got it they said but you need to get real with God you know you don't have it stop stop playing games look you don't want a Holy Ghost - please brother Jack do you need one that's gonna please God hey man don't don't do that don't know I'm just Turkish brother Jack ah ah ah look I do I say things because I'm a pastor that half the same stuff amen but I'm not sure God I got no heaven no no hell to put you in and I'm a preach heaven high and I map retail hot hey man you got to live right to make it to heaven coming to church will not just get you in the heaven brother Jack being you're passing I'll allow you to get no ticket into heaven you're gonna have to know Jesus for yourself you can't get in on mama testimony you can't get in on daddy testimony you got to know Jesus for yourself all right I read this about Sarah Sarah Sarah Sarah in Genesis 21 Bible say in verse 1 and the Lord visited Sara as he had sent and I'm just one that believes that we've come to a spot where God gonna visit his people as he say it you got to understand we got to move from it just being a promise to move to the place where becomes a manifestation they had been walking in a place where it's just a promise for years but God's Word just can't remain promises God's work must be manifested God don't speak things just what to be a promise that we can get excited we can we can we can rejoice over promise but I'm not just rejoicing over the promise I'll read just because this word will become material praise God brother branham say you know a man that I got faith in you know he don't have a loaf of bread but he got a quarter he said the reason a man can rejoice with that quarter is because he got the purchasing power no he don't have brag that he got the purchasing power that when he comes to the place where he can buy the bread he has what it takes to Amen exchange in a transaction a manner and then this word that God has given us it's everything we need for Bobby change but I'm not just waiting amen and just excited just because I got the promise I'm looking for Genesis 21 experience where the promise action becomes a manifestation I believe we've moved into that year we're moving into that year where the promise is becoming a manifestation but I got a preach division and step into it watch this the Lord visited Lord visited God God is the one bringing his promise to pass the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did that thing the Lord did unto Sarah Abraham didn't have nothing to do with this the Lord did unto Sarah as he has spoken let's go home church I'm telling you Sarah doubt it she wasn't like mayor say be it unto me according to your word Sarah was was wrestling with unbelief sad me and my lord have present I mean she comes she couldn't she she couldn't get this thing but I love this amen there was some point in time where Sarah wept from laughing to believing I'm not we know God did not destroy Sarah because she was connected to Abraham but I'm telling you that Sarah had her own epiphany Sarah had her own revelation Sarah had her own understanding how can you say that brother Jack because the Bible said Hebrews 11:11 can we read that now ain't that good Hebrews 11:11 that's double double this how we know Sarah had her own revelation some types at some point in time you're gonna come to your own revelation I'm speaking to Sarah's today amen through faith also Sara herself sera herself now Abraham didn't do this God not spoke to me himself so Sara herself received strength oh my god not just in her body but in her mind and what happened to her mom began to transform what was happening in her body you gonna have to receive strength in your spirit man please God something that's gonna cause you to rise up from where you are no you're not defeated no you're not some disobedient child you're a child of God you can tell the devil yeah I might have made some mistakes but I'm still here Sara laughed laughed at God's telling their laugh you ain't been that bad I hope you ain't been that bad but laugh why God was ten but still Scott still God manifested himself in our body I want to tell you something I don't care how bad off his bed for you in life the change still gonna take place you shall be changed changed in a moment in twinkle of an eye look at this look at this look at this through the Bible say through faith also Sara herself Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age ain't that just like God I got some things I want to just share with you all that's delight God she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised so at some point in time Sara came to her own revelation and what I'm saying is that some point in time the church has got to come to his own revelation we got to recognize who we are I've told you brother Branham who he was he looked in the script and saw Malachi 4 and began to preach it now I want to taste how much I was talking with a brother yesterday you know we were just conversing around the word and say now now when you catch this when you catch this tribulation down set in it was only after the word was being formed in Mary that she began to go through persecution as long as you've just a virgin with no problem with not with no manifestation she there was a promise hanging over Mary but not a manifestation but when the manifestation took place persecution set in can I tell you persecution is coming as the manifestations start coming as crisis being formed in you watch the persecution said early in its just gonna produce the baby that's all don't run from it run to it a man you'd be stronger you be better praise God a Manny Manny man glory to God let me just finish reading this in Genesis 21 verse 2 says in Sarah for Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God has spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born of him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac now I was just looking at this a man and you can just see just in reading these scriptures here God visiting Sarah the way he promised now God God used multiple ways to visit his people before Sarah had the change in her body God came down to talk with Abraham and stood there at the tent God and flesh in flesh talking to Sarah I mean talk at Abraham but Sarah overheard thinks God in flesh with two angels that was one visitation but when it was time for the manifestation of what God told Abraham he would do he says I'm gonna visit your wife Sarah at the time of life when it comes time for the manifestation he didn't come back in person there's a lot there cuz somebody feel looking for brother Brandon to come back no no no no he's done his part when the manifestation time came it was the spirit coming on the word and God made it come to pass and I'm here to tell you I'm just trusting God this is the time this is the season where the Spirit will connect with the word dynamics to the mechanics and cause this thing to come to pass all we got to do is just stay with it amen listen he's supernaturally touched Sarah so she could she could conceive her body had changed before she produced the son amen and we talked about there with Abimelech in other words she experienced the supernatural before she fulfilled her ultimate purpose of producing Isaac you know even after that Sarah produced Isaac she lived for a number of years but then she was she was taken off the scene our ultimate purpose is to produce Christ and I'm gonna tell you when we get there we're gonna be taken off the scene in a rapture hey man we might as well enjoy the other supernatural blessings of God before we are raptured Kucera enjoyed it too amen amen glory to God hallelujah so God visited in different ways initially came as a man and visited in but then he came back as spirits and visited them now look at this in order for them to produce this this justice son the promise had to be caught by faith and then believed and they did that it took 25 years but but the promise became a manifestation hallelujah hallelujah same thing with Mary it took hundreds of years before the promise became a manifestation but it became a manifestation it became a manifestation in Sarah it became a manifestation in Mary and I might as well tell you right now it will become a manifestation in you I declare by faith that this is another time of visitation I'm just the devil has just run roughshod and when the devil start moving he tried to get your mind off of what God is doing keep your mind on what God is doing amen I want to tell you something the devil is still alive the devil is still alive praise God all right let me just read a couple things and it will close right here a man this is going to come from the message the faith of Abraham the faith of Abraham since this why you're too old your wife's twenty years past menopause man so this is devil talking to Abraham I don't care if she's a hundred years past menopause that's where you got to talk back to the devil we're gonna have the baby how do you know God sent so that settles it God said so no matter how ridiculous it sounds if God said so alright God makes it ridiculous all faith is ridiculous to the unbeliever listen faith is only real to God and the one who has it unbelief don't stop God it don't bother God's plans it don't buy amen God's Word it don't hurt it it don't ruin them and only ruins the one and unbelief it only ruins the unbeliever amen not God see faith I mean doubt not not not ruling God God's promises will be fulfilled just exactly the same whether you believe it or not right you just beat your brains out trying to get away from it it don't stop God certainly not his promises has made his words that they're all the unbelief you can muster together won't stop it try to take your unbelief and stop the Sun from rising try to keep the rain from falling with your unbelief God will do it anyhow and if you can't stop the rain from falling if you can't stop the Sun from rising you can't stop this change from happening glory to God amen God will do it anyhow because it's in God's plan is God's program and he will heal every sick person that'll take his word for it's his program he said I'm the Lord heals all our diseases praise God I believe that a man this this last Pope that I want to read is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything too hard for the Lord said Abraham where's your where's your wife Sarah a stranger never seen him before where's your wife Sarah how did he know that he had a wife and how did he know that her name was Sarah says she's in the tent behind you and when she laughed when Sarah laugh said why does she laugh he caught the sign he knew what it was Sarah didn't get it she even come forth and tried to deny it God would have destroyed her upon that if she hadn't been a part of Abraham and a lot of times our unbelief with destroy us if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us you want to know why you need the blood it's the blood that keep God off you he would have destroyed you a long time ago but blood has been covering you can I tell you something else even when you was in a world of sin the blood was covering you some of us was this close to death but we here this morning it's because the blood was covering us God can't destroy us now because the blood of Jesus Christ keeps God off of us we are part of Christ just as Sarah was a part of Abraham for we are the Bride of Christ and we people who's born of the Spirit of God ought to wake up get out of our stools and watch for the supernatural sign of the coming of the Lord Jesus his signs that he promised a man you know we go through things in life and my we thank God for the blood that covers us and keeps us and you know but I tell you we make some we sow some seeds and when you sow your seat you got to reap it there's not nobody else's job to reap that that's what you sow so you got to reap it you got to deal with your own stuff that you soaked but God I give you grace God will give you grace catch the vision Oh step into it let's pray father we thank you for your word Lord as we just try to process and really grasp what the angel is trying to say to us lord I pray you God would help us to see this enterprise above where we are God you've called us to more than that get so bogged down with the things of this life and Lord the things of this world God but I just pray that you would help us Lord Jesus to rise above that Jesus you warned us Lord you called us so that you could reproduce yourself in and through us that's what you did Lord we're yielding ourselves to you God that you might be able to make us copies make us Lord just like you God that that's our desire we really want to be that we don't want to just be church members and God just God just people that go to church pay tithes and offering and God that it's more to this Christian walk than that it's so much more help us to yield to you God Father we pray that you just a man don't let these words go over our heads as your prophet told us if revelations be on dust and to look up and ask you for it we pray that you would help us to catch this know God that we might be the fulfillment of your word the word was fulfilled in Sarah the word was fulfilled in Mary that same word must be an will be fulfilled in us unbelief won't stop God the devil himself can't stop God doubt can't stop God nothing can stop God if you've spoken it it must come to pass and we will be a super church a super race as we near you God and every year we're getting closer and closer and closer to your coming so god I pray let change begin to happen in people right now God that the thing this world would just begin to fall off we're so wrapped up in trying to please people in the world that we're not pleasing God's father help us to recognize that you're the only thing that matters no nobody else has a heaven our hell to put us in so god it doesn't matter what they think it only matters what you think so lord I pray that you would help us card god we get ourselves wrapped up and tied up in so much sin unbelief the enemy get us all mixed up in these things but Lord the Lord take two ice Alvan Lord I know in our eyes that we will see who we really are Oh God help us Lord as our prayer help god is our prayer bless us Lord Jesus and thank you for your word that comes Lord to change us it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen
