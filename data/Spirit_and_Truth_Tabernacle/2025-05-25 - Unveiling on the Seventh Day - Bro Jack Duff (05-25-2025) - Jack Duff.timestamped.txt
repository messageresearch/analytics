[5:59] God, Father, it's good to be back in
[6:02] your presence with the saints, Lord, as
[6:05] we have gathered before our father this
[6:07] morning, Lord God. We've come, Lord,
[6:10] first of all, to hear your word, Lord.
[6:12] But we want to worship you. We want to
[6:14] express our love and our adoration
[6:16] towards you, Lord. So receive our praise
[6:18] and our thanksgiving. Father, we bring
[6:21] before you Sister Gibson, not Sister,
[6:23] I'm sorry, Sister Dixon. Lord Jesus,
[6:26] asking Almighty God, Father, that you
[6:29] would just touch her body, Lord Jesus.
[6:33] Father, from strength to strength, from
[6:35] glory to glory. May you move upon her,
[6:37] Lord, with your great healing power.
[6:40] Restore her strength, Lord. Restore her
[6:42] health, Lord Jesus. And Father, if I if
[6:44] we know Sister Dixon, the devil can't
[6:46] take her praise, Lord Jesus. So, I pray,
[6:49] oh God, that you would inhabit her
[6:50] praises. grant her heart's desire and
[6:52] meet every need that she has, Lord.
[6:55] Father, I pray that you would be with
[6:57] mama, Lord Jesus, as she goes in for
[6:59] surgery on her other eye. Oh, Father,
[7:01] you are the great physician. Anoint the
[7:02] surgeons, Lord Jesus. Father, they may
[7:05] that they may do a perfect job and that
[7:07] you will give her a speedy recovery,
[7:09] Lord Jesus. Father, our brothers and
[7:11] sisters, you know the needs upon each
[7:12] and every heart. Father, you know their
[7:14] heart's desire. And Father, you say,
[7:16] "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[7:18] his righteousness, and all these things
[7:20] will be added unto you." So, Father,
[7:22] grant and supply every need that each
[7:24] one has, Father. And Father, we bring
[7:26] unto you our tithing and our offering,
[7:28] our portion of our worship. Father, we
[7:30] bring it according to your word, Lord,
[7:32] that it may be used for the kingdom of
[7:34] God's sake, Lord Jesus. Bless the people
[7:36] for giving, Lord Jesus. Bless them,
[7:38] Lord, for their cheerfulness and their
[7:40] heart's desire to see, Lord, the kingdom
[7:43] move forward, Lord. Father, again, Lord,
[7:46] anoint our pastor Aresh, Lord, help him
[7:49] to get himself out of the way, Lord
[7:51] Jesus. Give him strength in his body,
[7:53] Lord. Oh, Father, may he have perfect
[7:56] soundness in his mind that he may
[7:57] deliver his heart. And may everyone,
[8:00] Lord, with a ready heart, receive the
[8:01] truth that you would deliver to us this
[8:03] morning. We love you, Father. We bless
[8:05] your name and praise you. It's in Jesus
[8:07] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen.

[25:25] to come in church. I was um getting a
[25:27] text. Y'all can get your Bibles. I I'll
[25:30] read here shortly. But I was uh got a
[25:33] text this morning. Brother was sent me a
[25:35] quote where brother Ram say, "Sometime
[25:36] we just be so tired and it's a push to
[25:39] get out to the service of the Lord." It
[25:40] says, "But when it get there just among
[25:43] the saints and they just begin to praise
[25:45] God, all of a sudden your strength just
[25:47] get renewed." And and I was feeling that
[25:50] way this morning. I said, "Oh my, look
[25:52] at this and look at this and look at
[25:53] this." I said, "Lord, this is all
[25:55] right." So I I I I'm I'm happy to be in
[25:58] the house of the Lord. Amen. We welcome
[26:00] you to his presence.
[26:03] Thank you, musicians. Thank you uh the
[26:06] specials that went forth this morning.
[26:07] God bless you, Sister Michelle, Sister
[26:09] Sarah. Thank you all so much. I do want
[26:12] to read a couple scriptures. Amen. uh on
[26:15] today and um just bear with me if you
[26:20] will. I know it's a a little reading,
[26:22] but Amen. There's nothing like the word
[26:24] of God. Amen. Revelation 3 and
[26:28] Revelation 10 um uh are two of the three
[26:32] scriptures I want to read um on today.
[26:35] And then uh I want to go back to Judges
[26:38] uh chapter 14 and uh read something from
[26:42] there. So, Revelation 3 and uh verse uh
[26:47] 14 very very familiar passage. Amen. To
[26:52] uh most of us and um the I want to also
[26:57] just mention this as I read this. Some
[26:58] of us we we this is like oh yeah we know
[27:01] that we know that. But I want you to
[27:03] always remember one of the reasons that
[27:05] we still here is because somebody else
[27:07] don't know this. and and then we have to
[27:10] we have to share the gospel. Amen. Um uh
[27:13] so Revelation 3:14, "And unto the angel
[27:16] of the church of the Leodysans, write
[27:19] these things, saith the a man, the
[27:22] faithful and true witness, uh the
[27:25] beginning of the creation of God."
[27:26] That's none other than our Lord Jesus
[27:28] Christ says, "I know thy works that thou
[27:31] art neither cold nor hot. I would thou
[27:33] work cold or hot." So then, because thou
[27:37] art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
[27:40] I will spew thee out of my mouth,
[27:42] because thou sayest, I am rich, and
[27:45] increase with goods, and have need of
[27:48] nothing, and knowest not that thou art
[27:50] wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
[27:53] blind, and naked. The condition of the
[27:56] church today, uh, even though they don't
[27:59] realize they're in this condition, uh,
[28:02] Jesus said they would be like this. And
[28:04] um anything Jesus said will come to
[28:07] pass. Amen. Verse 18 says, "I counsel
[28:10] thee uh to buy of me gold tried in the
[28:13] fire that thou mayest be rich and white
[28:16] raignment that thou mayest be clothed
[28:19] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[28:21] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[28:23] eyes that thou mayest see. As many as I
[28:27] love, I rebuke and chase and be zealous
[28:30] therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at
[28:32] the door and knock if any man hear my
[28:34] voice and open the door. I will come
[28:36] into him and will suck with him and he
[28:38] with me to him that overcomemeth. I love
[28:42] that. You got to have something that you
[28:45] overcome. Amen. And um uh it's, you
[28:49] know, it's important that you do that.
[28:51] Amen. And to him that
[28:53] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[28:56] in my throne, even as I also uh
[29:00] overcame, and I'm sat down with my
[29:02] father in his throne. He that hath an
[29:05] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[29:07] unto the churches. Amen. Very important
[29:10] to understand. The reason that the word
[29:12] churches is there is because uh there
[29:15] are two groups that are being spoken to
[29:17] in that uh uh passage of scriptures.
[29:20] There is the the false church and there
[29:23] is the true church. Amen. The true
[29:26] church will be the ones that have
[29:28] overcome. Amen. Revelation 10 uh verse
[29:32] 1-7. Let's just uh catch that again.
[29:34] Very very familiar passage to most of us
[29:38] uh here. Uh but I u like to just see
[29:42] what the Lord will say to us today
[29:44] through this. And I saw another mighty
[29:47] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[29:51] a cloud and a rainbow was a upon his
[29:54] head. Amen. And his face was as it were
[29:58] the sun and his feet as pillars of fire.
[30:01] And he had in his hand a little book
[30:04] open. And he set his right foot upon the
[30:06] sea and the left foot upon the earth
[30:09] left foot on the earth. and cried with a
[30:11] loud voice. As when a l when a lion
[30:15] roarth. Amen. And when he had cried,
[30:18] seven thunders uttered their voices.
[30:22] Amen. And when the seven thunders that
[30:24] uttered their voices, I was about to
[30:25] write. And I heard a voice from heaven
[30:28] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[30:31] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[30:33] write them not." And the angel which I
[30:35] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[30:38] earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and
[30:40] swear by him that liveth forever and
[30:42] ever, who created heaven, and the things
[30:44] that uh therein are, and the earth, and
[30:46] the things that therein are, and the
[30:48] sea, and the things which are therein,
[30:50] that there should be time no longer. But
[30:54] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[30:57] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[31:00] mystery of God should be finished as he
[31:03] hath declared to his servants, the
[31:05] prophets. Now, that verse where it says
[31:07] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[31:09] angel, that seventh angel is the same
[31:12] angel that we just read in Revelation 3,
[31:15] uh, talking about the angel to the
[31:17] Leodysian church age is the same
[31:20] ministry. Amen. The last verse that
[31:22] we'll read here today, we'll go back to
[31:25] the book of
[31:26] Judges. Amen. Uh verse uh chapter 14,
[31:30] and I'll read one verse uh from here,
[31:33] verse 17.
[31:35] Um praise the Lord. It says, "And she
[31:39] wept before him the seven
[31:42] days while their feast lasted. And it
[31:45] came to pass on the seventh day that he
[31:49] told her because she lay sore upon him
[31:52] and she told and and and she told the
[31:56] riddle to the children of a people.
[31:58] Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer.
[32:01] Uh Father, we just thank you for all
[32:04] that has happened thus far in the
[32:06] service. And um Lord, just from the
[32:09] opening prayer, opening song, opening
[32:13] note, Lord, to this point, we have felt
[32:15] the presence of God uh in this place.
[32:17] Our strength has been renewed. Our
[32:19] spirit is refreshed. And uh Lord, we
[32:22] just feel good about being here in the
[32:25] house of the Lord today. Now, the word
[32:27] comes forth, the most important part of
[32:29] the service. And God, we pray that
[32:31] revelation would come from heaven to our
[32:34] hearts. That we would have something we
[32:36] can hold to God that we can lean on uh
[32:39] when we're going through trials and
[32:40] tribulations and distresses. You know
[32:43] the conditions of the people that are
[32:45] present. You know the conditions of
[32:46] those that are online. Speak to your
[32:49] people in only a way that you can. In
[32:52] Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[32:55] bless you. You can be seated in the
[32:57] house of the Lord. Amen. We um thank God
[33:01] for all amen that are that are with us
[33:05] uh this morning. Uh I want to uh take
[33:09] for a thought this morning unveiling on
[33:14] the seventh day. Amen. Unveiling on the
[33:19] seventh day. Amen. Um, I want to just
[33:23] start this out with a um quotation from
[33:27] uh the message, the revelation of Jesus
[33:30] Christ. Praise the Lord. I believe uh
[33:33] brother Mark was closing out prayer this
[33:35] morning and uh he he made a comment
[33:38] there in his prayer about uh Lord how we
[33:41] need revelation. And uh so that was the
[33:44] opening quote for me on this morning. So
[33:47] uh helped me know that I was right in
[33:48] the channel. So thank you, brother Mark.
[33:50] Amen. for that. Uh here in um the
[33:52] revelation of Jesus Christ uh God's
[33:55] prophet makes a statement here. It says
[33:58] now the Greek word for revelation is
[34:01] apocalypse. He says which means
[34:04] unveiling. He says this unveiling is
[34:09] perfectly described in the example of a
[34:12] sculptor unveiling his work of statuary.
[34:16] Amen. Uh exposing it to the onlooker. uh
[34:19] it is an uncovering revealing what was
[34:23] previously hidden. Now the uncovering is
[34:26] not only the revelation of the person of
[34:28] Christ but it is the revelation of his
[34:31] future works in the oncoming seven
[34:34] church ages. Now that statement is
[34:36] extremely important and the reason that
[34:39] is important is because we have many
[34:41] people amen that know the Jesus of
[34:45] Calvary. Hallelujah. We have many people
[34:48] that uh that's all they want to do is
[34:51] stop at the Jesus of
[34:54] Calvary. Come on, somebody. But but
[34:57] there is a Jesus that rose.
[35:00] And then there is and so there was a
[35:02] work that was done up to Calvary and
[35:05] then there was another work that he had
[35:06] to do throughout the church ages.
[35:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we
[35:10] we need to know both both Jesuses is the
[35:13] same Jesus, right? But we need to know
[35:15] the Jesus that came to die for our sins.
[35:17] But the Jesus that rose and did a work
[35:19] through the ages. We need to know that
[35:22] Jesus.
[35:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, we're
[35:26] talking about, Amen. this revelation
[35:28] that is needed of his future works in
[35:31] the oncoming seven church ages. Amen.
[35:35] And we read one of those church ages
[35:36] there in Revelation 3. That was the
[35:38] seventh church age uh that we read about
[35:41] there. So there were six others before
[35:42] that. But the seventh one is the one
[35:44] that we're living in right now. So it's
[35:47] very important for us to understand that
[35:48] Jesus has been doing a work throughout
[35:51] these ages even up to this day is the
[35:53] Lord Jesus doing the work. Let us go
[35:56] forward in this quote. He says uh the
[35:58] importance of revelation by the spirit
[36:01] and that is that is so important. I
[36:03] can't give you revelation. Your neighbor
[36:05] sitting next to you can't give you
[36:07] revelation. Amen. We can talk to you
[36:09] about all all kind of things, but it
[36:10] takes God himself,
[36:13] amen, to drop down and give you
[36:15] revelation. And I'm here to tell you
[36:17] today that when God gives you a
[36:20] revelation, there is nobody or nothing
[36:24] that can take that revelation from you.
[36:27] If you if you have a condition in your
[36:29] body that the doctors tell you there is
[36:32] nothing we can do. But if God gives you
[36:34] a revelation and says, "I am the Lord
[36:37] thy God that health all thy diseases."
[36:41] No matter what the doctor's report
[36:42] shows, no matter what the doctor says, I
[36:45] don't care how much bad news you got.
[36:47] When God give you revelation, you'll
[36:50] stand against what the doctor say.
[36:52] Hallelujah.
[36:54] Hallelujah. Glory to God. You don't look
[36:56] at conditions and circumstances when you
[36:58] have a revelation. So you got to pray
[37:00] for revelation above everything. Pray
[37:03] for revelation.
[37:05] All right. He says the importance of
[37:08] revelation by the spirit to a true
[37:10] believer can never be
[37:12] overemphasized. Revelation means more to
[37:15] you than perhaps you realize. He says
[37:18] now I am I am not talking about the book
[37:21] of revelation which we read two
[37:23] scriptures out of there. Not not just
[37:24] the book of revelation. He says, he
[37:26] says, um, uh, uh, I'm not talking about
[37:29] this book of Revelation and, uh, and
[37:31] and, uh, and and you, I am talking about
[37:33] all revelation. It is tremendously
[37:35] important to the church. It says, do you
[37:38] remember Matthew 16 where Jesus asked
[37:41] the disciples this question? Who do men
[37:44] say that I, the son of man, am? He's
[37:47] quoting scripture. Matthew 16. and and
[37:50] and and they said, "Some say hallelujah,
[37:53] that thou art John the Baptist, some
[37:56] Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the
[38:00] prophets." He said unto them, "Oh my my
[38:02] my I love this. I love this. I love
[38:04] this." You know, cuz you know, it's one
[38:06] thing to hear what everybody else is
[38:08] saying. But but but when when when God
[38:10] is working with you oneon-one, he not
[38:13] really interested in what everybody else
[38:14] got to say.
[38:16] The question turns.
[38:18] It moves from a group question. It
[38:21] becomes an individual question and you
[38:24] have to give a individual answer.
[38:28] And the only way you can give an
[38:30] individual answer is something has to be
[38:34] personally revealed to you.
[38:39] Look, look at what happens here in the
[38:41] scripture as we just quoting it. Amen.
[38:43] He says uh uh he says uh uh do do you
[38:46] remember Matthew 16 where Jesus asked
[38:48] disciples this question who the men say
[38:50] that I am I the son of man am and they
[38:52] said some say thou art John the Baptist
[38:54] some Elias others Jeremiah's or one of
[38:57] the prophets all kind of mixed up uh uh
[38:59] the theology he saith unto them but whom
[39:02] say ye
[39:05] individual that I am and I could just
[39:08] imagine them them 12 disciples just
[39:10] sitting there in a half hour of silence
[39:13] And Jesus didn't give them nothing else.
[39:15] Just gave them one question and they had
[39:16] the answer. And it happened to be Simon,
[39:19] my God, that came with the answer. And
[39:21] Simon Peter answered, and said, "Thou
[39:25] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[39:28] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[39:31] him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah,
[39:36] for flesh and blood have not revealed it
[39:38] unto thee, but my father which is in
[39:42] heaven. Amen. And and and I'm happy
[39:45] about that cuz this just probably put a
[39:47] big smile on Jesus' face. He blessed are
[39:49] you, Simon Barjona. I was waiting for
[39:51] somebody to give me the answer and you
[39:53] gave the right answer, Simon. He said,
[39:55] and notice you didn't get this from
[39:57] Amen. from from going to Bible school.
[39:59] Amen. You got this from God. He sent it
[40:01] down to you. God brought the revelation
[40:05] down to to Simon or brought it down to
[40:08] Peter. And God is still bringing down
[40:11] revelation to his people today.
[40:15] [Applause]
[40:16] Oh my. While you sitting here,
[40:18] revelation's coming down.
[40:20] Oh, can't you feel the rain of
[40:22] revelation?
[40:24] Woo. Hallelujah. I I want you to be
[40:27] soaked when you leave here. Soaked with
[40:30] revelation.
[40:32] And when you get revelation, you know
[40:34] what it does? It gives you stimulation.
[40:38] Glory to God. Boy, revelation will make
[40:41] you run. Revelation to make you shout.
[40:45] Revelation to make you jump. Revelation
[40:48] will make you move.
[40:50] Come on, somebody.
[40:53] [Music]
[40:54] Glory. Glory. Glory, glory, glory. You
[40:57] got to know why you jumping and
[40:59] shouting.
[41:00] You got to know why you come to church.
[41:03] You got to know why you do these things.
[41:06] Brother, I ain't going through the
[41:08] motions.
[41:10] Amen. I come to hear from God. I come to
[41:13] Amen. to have heaven speak directly to
[41:15] me. Let revelation rain down.
[41:21] Some people go to church just to hear
[41:23] choir.
[41:24] Some go to church to hear a preacher
[41:26] grab his ear and start humming. No. No.
[41:29] We come for revelation.
[41:31] Because it's going to take revelation to
[41:33] defeat to defeat these devils.
[41:38] Glory to God. Hallelujah. When you
[41:41] everybody telling you you crazy. Why you
[41:44] going to that church? They off they
[41:45] rocker. No, no, no, no. You off your
[41:47] rocker. I know what I'm standing on. I
[41:51] had a personal question by Jesus. Who do
[41:54] you say that I am? And I answer, thou
[41:57] art the Christ through the ages.
[42:01] The same Christ that went to the cross
[42:03] is the same Christ that's gone through
[42:05] the ages. And he's here right now. Let
[42:07] me keep reading. Amen. He says, "Blessed
[42:10] are thou, Simon Barjon, for flesh and
[42:11] blood have not revealed this unto thee,
[42:13] but my father which is in heaven, I say
[42:15] unto thee that thou art
[42:17] Peter." Uh, glory to God. And upon this
[42:20] rock I'll build my church in the gates
[42:21] of hell. I love it. The gates of hell
[42:24] shall not prevail against it. Amen. It
[42:26] says the Roman Catholics say that the
[42:28] church is built upon Peter. Now that's
[42:30] really carnal. It says, "How could God
[42:32] build a church upon a man that is so
[42:35] unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus
[42:37] and cursed while doing it?"
[42:46] Um, now you think Peter felt
[42:50] good about denying the Lord Jesus, not
[42:55] only denying him,
[42:58] but cursing while doing it.
[43:02] You I'mma tell you how Peter felt. Peter
[43:04] felt so bad that he went back to
[43:06] fishing. Yeah. He went back to his old
[43:08] job and and and then you know Jesus
[43:12] Jesus knew how Peter was feeling. So he
[43:14] had to do things very specific when he
[43:16] said go tell my disciples.
[43:19] He specifically said and Peter
[43:23] I know he cursed but he's still my
[43:25] disciple now. Amen. Hallelujah. Now I I
[43:29] I want to say that because you got
[43:31] preachers in the pull pit today cursing
[43:34] and feel comfortable cursing.
[43:38] Something wrong with your spirit.
[43:42] A and folk inside churches like this. We
[43:45] need to run for our lives.
[43:49] I I I I asked somebody one time. I say,
[43:51] "Well, you know, I'm I'm working and
[43:53] this guy's a pastor and man, he's just
[43:55] cursing up a storm." And I asked a
[43:58] friend, I say, "Well, what did he get
[43:59] saved from?" If he say he's saved, what
[44:03] did he get saved from? Because when I
[44:05] got saved, my lifestyle changed.
[44:09] When I started following Jesus, my
[44:11] lifestyle changed. But these people
[44:13] think they can just do anything and
[44:15] still call on the name of the Lord. No,
[44:17] you can't do that. If you're going to be
[44:19] a Christian, be Christian. What we just
[44:22] read in the scripture that God hate
[44:23] lukewarm believers.
[44:25] Some of them are so cold you can't get
[44:27] nothing out out of them. Amen. He say
[44:30] don't don't don't say don't be lukewarm.
[44:32] He said and some of them said I mean
[44:33] they they don't know what they so cold.
[44:36] Say I rather you be hot on fire for God.
[44:41] But don't be lukewarm.
[44:44] Lukewarm believers they get spit out.
[44:49] Look at this now. the the uh the the the
[44:52] quote goes on and says uh the Roman
[44:54] Catholics say that the church is built
[44:56] upon Peter. Now, that's really carnal.
[44:57] How could God build the church upon a
[44:59] man so unstable that he denied the Lord
[45:01] Jesus and cursed while doing it? God
[45:04] can't build his church upon any man born
[45:06] in sin.
[45:08] Amen. He says, "And it wasn't some rock
[45:11] lying there as though God had hallowed
[45:14] the ground at that spot. And it isn't as
[45:18] the Protestants say that the church is
[45:20] built upon Jesus.
[45:22] As the Protestants say, the church is
[45:25] built upon Jesus. No, it was the
[45:27] revelation. The church was not built
[45:30] upon Amen. a spe a specific rock. Amen.
[45:34] The church was not built upon Peter.
[45:37] Hallelujah. Amen. And even brother
[45:39] Mannus tells that the purpose the church
[45:40] was not built upon Jesus, but the church
[45:44] was built upon the revelation. Amen.
[45:46] Read it the way it's written. Flesh and
[45:48] blood hath not revealed it, but my
[45:51] father hath revealed it. And upon this
[45:54] rock, what rock? The rock of revelation,
[45:58] I will build my church. So the church is
[46:02] built on the revelation on the thus
[46:05] saith the Lord. We're the church is
[46:08] built on the revelation of who Christ
[46:11] is. That's right.
[46:13] Let me also say it's not who Christ was
[46:16] but who Christ
[46:18] is. And we need to know that he is the
[46:21] same
[46:23] yesterday,
[46:24] today, and forever. The church is built
[46:28] upon the revelation of who Christ is.
[46:33] All right. All right. All right. Let me
[46:36] go a little further here. Amen. We're
[46:38] talking about the
[46:39] unveiling. Amen. on the seventh day here
[46:44] in a message I've heard but now I see
[46:48] um it says now we're
[46:50] promised a church age through
[46:54] reformers and uh and this church age
[46:57] that we're talking about is what we just
[46:58] read here in Revelation chapter 3:14 uh
[47:01] there is a church age a leodyian church
[47:03] age that that will be uh in existence
[47:06] and notice some of the conditions of
[47:08] that age you know they were uh blind,
[47:13] wretched, miserable, naked, and the sad
[47:16] part, they didn't know it. The other
[47:18] thing about this church age is that this
[47:20] would be the only age that Jesus Christ
[47:23] himself will be found outside of the
[47:26] church, knocking on the door of the
[47:29] church, trying to get back in. The very
[47:32] church that he died for, he's been
[47:34] kicked out.
[47:36] Y'all know it's the truth. I mean, yeah.
[47:39] I mean, you know, uh I I've been in I've
[47:41] been in services and you know, at some
[47:44] of these churches and they they go and
[47:45] they have this and they just worshiping
[47:47] and praising God and glory to God and
[47:49] and and you know and and and they have
[47:51] an altar call and people come running up
[47:53] to the altar and they got people that
[47:54] just standing there praying with them,
[47:55] praying for them and everything. And I
[47:57] mean the service usually lasts about an
[47:59] hour, right? Something like that. Y'all
[48:01] know what I'm talking about, right? It
[48:03] last about an hour. And and some of us
[48:05] got comfortable with that. We we want
[48:06] that one hour church.
[48:09] Man, it's better. I mean, back in my
[48:11] day, it three hours don't take that
[48:13] much. It took that and more to get them
[48:16] devils out of you.
[48:21] Right. But but but but they they they
[48:22] want that one-hour service. And then,
[48:24] you know, right after the service was
[48:26] over, I mean, after salvation, this
[48:29] really unique, I mean, very special
[48:31] moment. After the salvation of a person,
[48:33] they go right from there to the next
[48:34] room. They leave the sanctuary, go to
[48:37] the next room, and they got cool in the
[48:38] game playing.
[48:42] Now, how do we get from this atmosphere
[48:44] to this atmosphere? What is this? Do we
[48:47] think heaven going to be You think
[48:48] heaven going to have cool in the gang
[48:50] plan?
[48:54] Huh? It ain't going to be there. And and
[48:55] and so so we got to we got to get back
[48:58] to, you know, to to to the gospel. Let's
[49:00] put it that way. Because this nonsense
[49:02] that's happening in church, Jesus ain't
[49:04] got nothing to do with it. He on the
[49:06] outside knocking, trying to get back in.
[49:10] Watch this now. He tells us, I've heard,
[49:12] but now I see he says, "And we're
[49:15] promised the church age through
[49:16] reformers. We've had them, but he
[49:19] promised in Malachi 4, he keep his
[49:21] pattern in the last days." What and what
[49:25] would take place? To turn the hearts of
[49:27] the children back to the faith of the
[49:29] apostolic father. So that's Malachi 4.
[49:31] You'll find it there in the scripture.
[49:32] To turn the hearts of the children uh
[49:34] back to the faith of the apostolic
[49:36] father for that very purpose and the
[49:40] church is so broke up in denominations
[49:44] and isms so it's so tore to pieces till
[49:48] it's dead. It's been a carrier. And then
[49:51] he promised in the hour the seventh
[49:54] angel's message. Amen. The seven seals
[49:57] would be revealed and the mystery of God
[49:59] would be will be will be declared.
[50:01] Revelation 10. When the seventh angel
[50:04] begins to sound his message. I love
[50:07] this. Not the healing
[50:12] services. The message that follows the
[50:15] healing service. So when God sent
[50:18] brother Brandon to the earth, he gave
[50:20] him a very unique ministry. He'd go from
[50:22] city to city praying for people. God
[50:24] would reveal things that only God could
[50:26] reveal to him to say say to people, you
[50:28] got this condition, you got that
[50:30] condition. You just went to the doctor
[50:31] the other day. I see him reading the
[50:33] report. The report say this and and if
[50:35] you just believe God, that condition is
[50:37] done.
[50:39] All all that you listen to the tape over
[50:41] and over again and and you your your
[50:43] name is so and so. I Lord, don't let
[50:45] them miss it. Lord don't and when he
[50:47] praying Lord don't let them miss it he's
[50:48] saying give them something personal
[50:51] that they would catch what I'm tell what
[50:53] I'm talking about he's talking about a
[50:56] condition but everybody in there have a
[50:58] condition but when he calls your name
[51:02] you know God is is connecting with your
[51:04] faith when he calls your name
[51:07] your name is sister so and so your name
[51:09] is brother so and so and you got this
[51:11] condition you come from this city you're
[51:14] not even from this place you come from
[51:16] where there's water is. Oh, you live in
[51:18] Michigan.
[51:20] He just calling out all kind of only God
[51:22] would know those types of things. Amen.
[51:26] One time I think uh went to a city and
[51:28] told a lady and they were sitting there
[51:31] trying to see if he was going to be
[51:32] right or wrong and said, "So this lady
[51:34] uh lady come through the prayer line."
[51:36] He say, "Oh sister, say you got this,
[51:38] you got that and your address is such
[51:39] and such." And when he told the address,
[51:42] the people in the back with that with
[51:43] that doubt, they said, "Oh, he just got
[51:45] one wrong. He just got one wrong. We
[51:48] know that lady. We know where she lives.
[51:50] She's our neighbor. That lady does not
[51:51] live there. He just got one wrong." So
[51:54] they found a lady after church and said,
[51:55] "Now you you sat there right there and
[51:57] told him, "Yes, that that's your
[51:59] address. We know you don't live there.
[52:01] You live at this address." They said,
[52:02] "Oh, I forgot to tell you. I moved
[52:04] yesterday."
[52:05] [Applause]
[52:09] See, only God will know she moved
[52:11] yesterday. And that's not my address. I
[52:14] live exactly where the man said I lived.
[52:18] Hallelujah.
[52:19] But you know that the message,
[52:22] the message followed the healing
[52:24] services.
[52:26] That that was just to get your attention
[52:27] to let you know a supernatural God was
[52:29] on the scene. And once he got your
[52:31] attention, now he wanted to express his
[52:33] word. He wanted to unveil some things to
[52:36] you.
[52:38] All right, let's let's let's let's let's
[52:39] just look at this. Amen. Uh I'm in the
[52:43] breach between the church ages and the
[52:44] seven seals. This sermon that's
[52:47] preached. He says uh and and he's
[52:49] talking about the book of Revelation.
[52:51] He's talking about the book of
[52:52] Revelation when he's quoting this. He
[52:54] says now and and and when he says, "But
[52:57] it's a book, a mysterious book." Now,
[52:59] look, uh there's not many churches you
[53:02] can go to that they're going to pick up
[53:04] a scripture out of the book of
[53:05] Revelation, read it, teach it, and uh
[53:09] and just just just bring it make it
[53:11] current tense. All right? A lot of
[53:13] churches, you you're not going to get
[53:14] that. It's going to just go it. It's I I
[53:17] remember being in churches say the the
[53:18] the pastor, he said he said, "I we we we
[53:21] did a daily devotional, but when we got
[53:23] to the book of Revelation, I just told
[53:24] my daddy, you gonna have to take that
[53:26] one cuz I can't do nothing with it." But
[53:28] you're the pastor. You're the pastor. We
[53:30] need to know. I mean, you know, you
[53:32] don't went to school and you I mean, can
[53:34] you believe that I got a degree, went to
[53:36] school, and I can't I can't touch
[53:38] revelation. It shows you that it takes
[53:40] more than a degree to get this
[53:43] understanding. Oh my. It takes God
[53:46] giving you individual revelation. Oh my
[53:49] my my my
[53:51] my. Watch this. Now, let's let's look.
[53:53] He says, "Now, but it's a book, a
[53:55] mysterious book. It's a book of
[53:56] redemption." Uh we'll get into that in a
[53:59] little while. And now we know that this
[54:01] book of redemption will not be
[54:03] thoroughly
[54:06] understood. It's probed at through six
[54:09] church ages. It's probed at it says but
[54:12] at the end what I'm saying is on the
[54:14] seventh day there's an unveiling. So at
[54:18] the end oh my even Daniel was told to
[54:21] seal it up till the time of the end.
[54:24] John was told right here, "Seal it up
[54:26] until the time of the end." It wasn't
[54:28] time for them to see what God had in
[54:31] store. But on the seventh day, in the
[54:34] seventh church age, God revealed
[54:37] something to his people. And let me let
[54:39] me just let me make it very clear. The
[54:41] revelation is only for the bride.
[54:45] Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:48] Lord have mercy. The revelation is only
[54:51] for the bride. Not for the church, but
[54:53] for the bride. Amen. And and now you got
[54:56] to understand, I mean, to be bride, to
[54:57] be chosen, to be elected, to be
[54:59] selected, to be Amen. the one. Amen.
[55:02] It's it's a special a special position
[55:05] that God has placed you in. When a man
[55:08] choose a wife, that that lady has a
[55:10] special position. Out of all the other
[55:14] ladies that he could have chose, he
[55:15] decided on this one.
[55:18] Glory, glory, glory, glory. out of all
[55:21] the other churches he could have chose,
[55:23] he decided on this one.
[55:26] And that one, he revealed secrets to her
[55:28] that nobody else would know about. Amen.
[55:32] It happened on the seventh day or in the
[55:34] seventh church age, if I could put it
[55:36] that way. All
[55:37] right. Look now, it says
[55:40] um this book of redemption will not be
[55:43] thoroughly understood. is probed at
[55:45] through six church ages. But at the end
[55:47] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[55:50] his mystery, he winds up all the loose
[55:52] ends and and that these fellas probed
[55:55] at. Amen. And I like this. Watch this.
[55:58] And the
[56:00] mysteries come down from God as the word
[56:04] of God. Now, let me let me just just
[56:08] kind of connect the dots on that really
[56:10] really quick uh for you. We read
[56:15] Revelation
[56:16] 10 verse
[56:21] 1 and it said this. And I saw another
[56:24] mighty angel come down from heaven
[56:28] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[56:31] upon his head and his face was as it
[56:33] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[56:35] fire. Now this angel, brother Brandham
[56:38] tells us this angel is none other than
[56:40] the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Now, now,
[56:43] now when we got to verse seven in that
[56:45] same thing, he says, "But in the days of
[56:46] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[56:49] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[56:52] should be finished as he have declared
[56:54] to his servants the prophets." Now,
[56:55] there's a couple things we just we need
[56:56] to see. I just read the
[56:59] mysteries come down from God. Now, how
[57:04] do they come?
[57:07] How do the mysteries come? The mysteries
[57:10] come as the word of God and reveals the
[57:16] entire revelation of God. So, so, so
[57:19] these mysteries that are supposed to
[57:20] come down, amen, from God, they come as
[57:24] the word of God. The mysteries that come
[57:28] down from God come as the word of God.
[57:34] Oh, I'm going to say it again because it
[57:35] it it it really really feels good to me.
[57:39] The mysteries
[57:42] in the seventh day
[57:45] come down from God. The mysteries are
[57:49] the word of God. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay.
[57:56] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[57:59] Um God God not trying to keep this
[58:02] mysterious to you. He actually wants you
[58:04] to know about it. Amen. Let let's let's
[58:07] just look at something here. Um let me
[58:09] finish this. The mysteries come down
[58:11] from God as the word of God and reveals
[58:16] the entire revelation of God. Then the
[58:19] Godhead and everything else is settled.
[58:24] Let me just stop there for a second.
[58:27] When the mysteries come down from God as
[58:31] the word of God, it begins to help us to
[58:33] understand who God is. Now he say the
[58:36] godhead is settled.
[58:38] Why does the godhead need to be settled?
[58:46] Why?
[58:48] Because I grew up in church where when
[58:52] they baptized me,
[58:54] they they said they going to baptize me
[58:57] the way
[58:59] Jesus said to be baptized. Right. Right.
[59:02] And according to Jesus,
[59:05] Jesus said, "Baptize in the name of the
[59:08] Father, and of the Son and of the Holy
[59:12] Spirit." But on the day of Pentecost,
[59:16] Peter being there listening to the words
[59:18] of Jesus, 10 days after Jesus said that,
[59:22] on the day of Pentecost, Peter says,
[59:24] "Repent, be baptized in the name of the
[59:28] Lord Jesus Christ."
[59:30] Hallelujah. Now we got these two
[59:33] different baptisms that's happening in
[59:35] the church and everybody reading out of
[59:37] the same Bible.
[59:41] So why we need to get this settled?
[59:43] Because somebody going to leave be going
[59:45] off in the wrong direction. And
[59:47] everybody that you saw got baptized
[59:49] after day of Pentecost in the book of
[59:52] Acts. Every got everybody got baptized
[59:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:56] How did Peter get this wrong?
[59:59] or did he have it right?
[1:00:05] Well, I'm going to venture out to say
[1:00:08] that Peter had it right. And remember,
[1:00:11] Peter was the one that Jesus said,
[1:00:13] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[1:00:17] flesh and blood have not revealed these
[1:00:19] things to you, but my father
[1:00:23] in heaven hath revealed." Peter caught
[1:00:26] the understanding that the name of the
[1:00:29] son was
[1:00:31] Jesus. And if the name of the son is
[1:00:34] Jesus, then the name of the father is
[1:00:36] also Jesus and the name of the spirit is
[1:00:40] also Jesus. He says, "So, so baptize in
[1:00:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:47] because the name of the Father and of
[1:00:50] the Son and of the Holy Spirit is the
[1:00:52] same person, not three different
[1:00:54] people."
[1:00:57] The Lord our God is one.
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:01] Not three, but one.
[1:01:04] Oh my. So, we had to get that settled.
[1:01:09] Yes, sir. And the revelation had to come
[1:01:11] down from God as the word of God to
[1:01:16] settle the people. Yes. Here's another
[1:01:19] one. Look at the rest of this quote. It
[1:01:22] says, "The Godhead and everything else
[1:01:23] is
[1:01:25] settled. All of the
[1:01:27] mysteries." Look at this one. He says,
[1:01:30] "Serpent seed and whatever
[1:01:34] more to be
[1:01:36] revealed." Just throws it in there. And
[1:01:39] and most of us just Yeah, we know what
[1:01:41] exactly we're talking about. Some people
[1:01:42] don't have no idea what he just
[1:01:43] mentioned. Why did he throw in serpent
[1:01:46] seed? We we need the mystery
[1:01:50] to come down from God
[1:01:54] as the word of God. And when when you
[1:01:57] catch it in the word of God, then you
[1:01:59] know you are. Why would he say serpent
[1:02:02] seed? Because this was a real great
[1:02:05] mystery that we needed settled in this
[1:02:07] day. Yes, sir. I went to church. They
[1:02:09] opened up Genesis and they told me that
[1:02:14] uh Eve ate a apple.
[1:02:18] Now I I I might not be the only one here
[1:02:21] that that that felt this way. When they
[1:02:23] told me that, that just didn't seem to
[1:02:25] register. It didn't click. And like she
[1:02:28] did what? Ate an apple. All right. Okay.
[1:02:31] That's what y'all say. But inside I'm
[1:02:34] like, man, this just don't really this
[1:02:37] not coming together. Then I heard a
[1:02:39] prophet come along and say, if Eve ate
[1:02:43] an apple
[1:02:47] and got pregnant,
[1:02:50] why is that not happening today?
[1:02:54] And the other thing he said, if Eve ate
[1:02:57] an apple and she recognized she was
[1:03:01] naked, He say they ought to eat apples
[1:03:03] today.
[1:03:07] What apple did Eve eat that did all
[1:03:10] that? She ate an apple and got pregnant,
[1:03:13] had children after eating an apple. What
[1:03:16] apple is this?
[1:03:19] Where is that apple? Is it extinct?
[1:03:21] Somebody show me the apple.
[1:03:25] It's not there. So, a prophet tells us
[1:03:28] what really happened in the Garden of
[1:03:29] Eden is Eve had a conversation with the
[1:03:34] serpent
[1:03:35] and then he also told us what the
[1:03:37] serpent was like because you know we can
[1:03:39] read in the scripture. I'm just I'm just
[1:03:40] quoting these things. You can go back
[1:03:41] and read them but Genesis 3 is where I
[1:03:43] am. But in the scripture we see the
[1:03:45] serpent is actually after the fall the
[1:03:48] serpent got cast down on his belly.
[1:03:51] Well, what happened before? What did the
[1:03:54] serpent look like before it was cast
[1:03:55] down on his belly? A prophet. Let let me
[1:03:59] let me just stop. Hold on. Just give me
[1:04:01] let me let me just take my
[1:04:02] time.
[1:04:04] To understand
[1:04:07] the book of Genesis,
[1:04:11] you have to understand it through the
[1:04:14] eyes of a prophet.
[1:04:18] What prophet? The prophet Moses wrote
[1:04:21] the book of Genesis. And I don't I need
[1:04:24] you to understand Moses was not there.
[1:04:28] That's right. How did Moses write
[1:04:30] Genesis and he was known? He he was not
[1:04:32] there. Wrote the first five books of the
[1:04:34] Bible. How would he tell us what
[1:04:35] happened with Adam and Eve and he was
[1:04:37] not born yet?
[1:04:40] It's because God would reveal to a
[1:04:42] prophet. See, see, see, see, here's the
[1:04:43] thing. And the scriptures say Amos 3:7,
[1:04:45] "Shoot the Lord God will do nothing
[1:04:47] until he reveal his secrets to his
[1:04:49] servants, the prophets." So here Moses
[1:04:52] being a prophet catches uh uh through
[1:04:55] vision everything that happened and then
[1:04:57] put it in in in in paper on paper for us
[1:04:59] to be able to read. Now, now Moses wrote
[1:05:02] what happened, but he didn't give us the
[1:05:04] other details.
[1:05:07] How did this serpent get on his belly?
[1:05:09] What did it look like before that? Well,
[1:05:11] a prophet told us he stood on two feet
[1:05:13] like a man.
[1:05:16] He went on went on to say he could talk
[1:05:18] like a man. He could do everything like
[1:05:21] a man. He just didn't have a soul on the
[1:05:23] inside of him. He can reason like a man.
[1:05:26] And Satan knew that being was in the
[1:05:29] garden. That animal was in the garden.
[1:05:31] Satan knew it. And Satan knew everything
[1:05:33] that he could do because this serpent
[1:05:35] began to have conversation with Eve
[1:05:38] talking about this tree.
[1:05:41] that you're not supposed to eat from.
[1:05:43] Cuz you know this tree in the midst of
[1:05:47] the garden,
[1:05:49] the one that's in the midst of the
[1:05:51] garden, if we start touching that one,
[1:05:54] some fruit might come forth.
[1:06:00] Hallelujah, somebody. We're going to
[1:06:02] talk about Samson a little bit. See, he
[1:06:04] got messing around with this this this
[1:06:06] tree in the midst of a garden. All
[1:06:09] right. His mom and dad said, "Now, why
[1:06:11] you want that woman there? There's we
[1:06:14] got sisters right here in the church
[1:06:15] that you can have. Why you want her,
[1:06:16] Samson?"
[1:06:18] He start messing around with this fruit
[1:06:20] in the midst of the garden. I hope you
[1:06:22] can read between the lines
[1:06:25] cuz cuz there's a there's some there's a
[1:06:27] there's a tree with that can bear some
[1:06:29] fruit in the midst of a woman's garden
[1:06:32] and she'll start having children.
[1:06:36] Hello, somebody. Glory to God. So, so,
[1:06:39] so, so, so, so, so, so here, you know,
[1:06:42] uh, um, uh, brother Brandham tells us,
[1:06:44] they say say, "Look now, uh, so, so this
[1:06:46] this this animal stood on two feet just
[1:06:48] like a other animal, but this one had
[1:06:50] two feet, could act like a man, talk
[1:06:52] like a man, uh, walk like a man,
[1:06:54] everything like a man, but just didn't
[1:06:56] have a soul on the inside." That's
[1:06:58] right. That's right. Right?
[1:07:00] And when this animal start having
[1:07:04] conversation with Eve about, oh, you can
[1:07:07] eat of that fruit and you can do this
[1:07:09] and you can do that. And you know, the
[1:07:10] day you eat thereof, you're going you're
[1:07:12] going to learn you're going to be like
[1:07:13] God. Didn't even realize she was already
[1:07:14] like God.
[1:07:17] But took a false revelation, a false
[1:07:20] understanding.
[1:07:21] Amen. And as as a serpent started
[1:07:23] working this thing with her, you know,
[1:07:25] next thing he got her while she was away
[1:07:27] from Adam, he got her to fall in the
[1:07:29] garden. What happened? She committed
[1:07:31] adultery.
[1:07:33] That's how she had kids. How children
[1:07:36] born today? People eat fruit. They go to
[1:07:38] Publix and buy apples. No. You don't go
[1:07:41] to Wendix and get no apples or Aldi's
[1:07:43] and get apples. No. No. No. Somebody
[1:07:45] start messing around with the fruit in
[1:07:46] the midst of the garden.
[1:07:56] And let me just be honest with you. If
[1:07:58] we can't get out of Genesis, right?
[1:08:01] I'm talking about the church as a whole.
[1:08:03] If we can't get out of Genesis 3, right,
[1:08:06] how we going to get the rest of the
[1:08:08] Bible right?
[1:08:12] Amen. So, these are things that needed
[1:08:15] to be settled. Yes, sir. There's so many
[1:08:17] others. I mean, I let me uh let me let
[1:08:21] me let me just I want to just I I got
[1:08:23] something I want to mention here. Um I'm
[1:08:25] going to go to Oh, Lord, I'm jumping all
[1:08:28] around
[1:08:29] now.
[1:08:32] Um is this a sign of the end, sir? I
[1:08:34] think I Yeah, I'll go there. The um when
[1:08:38] we talk about these
[1:08:41] mysteries, there's so many other
[1:08:43] mysteries that need to be settled. God.
[1:08:44] When the mysteries come down as the word
[1:08:47] of God, mysteries come down as the word
[1:08:50] of God. And when they come down,
[1:08:52] remember the Lord God does nothing
[1:08:53] unless he reveal his secrets to servants
[1:08:55] and prophets. And and and and I want to
[1:08:57] just just as I get is this a sign of the
[1:09:00] end uh ser want to set it up. When when
[1:09:02] I'm looking at this sermon today, I'm
[1:09:04] looking I read you out of the book of
[1:09:05] Judges. And if you would go back and
[1:09:07] read the book of Judges sometime, you'll
[1:09:09] realize Israel as a nation was just,
[1:09:13] man, they was messed up. They they was
[1:09:16] just they was just messed up. Um they um
[1:09:21] uh they would go into
[1:09:24] bondage, they pray, God would send them
[1:09:27] a deliverer, they get out of bondage,
[1:09:30] and before you know it, right back into
[1:09:33] bondage again.
[1:09:36] That cycle got to be broken. If you find
[1:09:39] yourself in a condition like that, man,
[1:09:41] I'm free for a certain period of time,
[1:09:43] then all of a sudden, I'm right back
[1:09:45] down again, and then I'm up again. God
[1:09:48] don't want you to have yo-yo religion.
[1:09:52] No, God wants you to be stabilized in
[1:09:54] your walk. I mean, you you you carrying
[1:09:57] something precious. You carrying re you
[1:09:59] carrying revelation, amen, in your
[1:10:01] heart. This is this something God don't
[1:10:03] give to everybody, but he gave it to
[1:10:04] you. Don't play games with this. I mean,
[1:10:07] live right,
[1:10:09] right? But but but when you look at you
[1:10:11] look at the condition of Israel during
[1:10:13] that time, they just they up, they down,
[1:10:15] they up, they down, they up, they down,
[1:10:17] and it was so bad that the Bible said
[1:10:20] that the that the the uh they did what
[1:10:22] was what was right in their own eyes.
[1:10:26] Now, now when when a person get to doing
[1:10:28] what's right in their own eyes, that
[1:10:29] mean they not following the word of God
[1:10:31] anymore.
[1:10:33] Amen. They ain't they ain't following
[1:10:34] the word of a king. They ain't following
[1:10:36] the word of God. They ain't following
[1:10:37] the word of a prophet. They ain't
[1:10:38] following the word of nobody. They doing
[1:10:39] what is right in their own eyes. And if
[1:10:41] that ain't the repeat of what we got
[1:10:42] today.
[1:10:44] Amen. I'mma just be me and I'mma just do
[1:10:46] me and I and I'mma just this the way I
[1:10:48] see it. I I know that's the way you see,
[1:10:50] but I'mma just be me. You don't realize
[1:10:52] you right back in the book of Judges all
[1:10:54] all over again. God gave us something to
[1:10:57] instruct and guide our lives. This Bible
[1:10:59] is what does that. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:11:04] here in the church ages, we got the same
[1:11:06] problem. Right. Right. Through the
[1:11:07] church ages, you get they get free, they
[1:11:09] go back into bondage. Get free, go back
[1:11:10] into bond. Every time they go back into
[1:11:12] bondage is when they go into
[1:11:13] denominational thinking again. That's
[1:11:16] bondage. God don't want you in that that
[1:11:18] that system. All right. Some of the
[1:11:21] other mysteries that that we had and I
[1:11:24] uh let me just read here out of
[1:11:27] um sign of the end ser says, "Now listen
[1:11:31] close. The seventh
[1:11:33] angel of Revelation 10:7, that's what we
[1:11:36] just read, is the seventh church age
[1:11:38] messenger, Revelation 3:14, right? To
[1:11:41] the angel of the church of Leadyia. He
[1:11:43] says, "Now watch, in the days, now watch
[1:11:45] here, but in the days of the voice of
[1:11:47] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:11:49] sound." Now, there's an unveiling in the
[1:11:51] seventh day is what I'm trying to get
[1:11:53] you to see. It's an unveiling. Uh uh uh
[1:11:56] revelations come forth in the seventh
[1:11:58] day. That's when it opens up. It's in
[1:12:00] the seventh church age that these things
[1:12:02] happen. He says, "Now watch, but in the
[1:12:04] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:12:05] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:12:07] mystery of God should shall be
[1:12:08] finished." And the mysteries is the word
[1:12:10] of God coming down, coming down to us.
[1:12:13] Says, "Now sounding forth this
[1:12:14] messenger, the seventh angel here is
[1:12:16] sounding forth his message to the
[1:12:18] leadyan church." Notice his type of
[1:12:21] message. Now, it wasn't to the first
[1:12:22] angel. It it wasn't it wasn't given that
[1:12:26] second angel, third, fourth, fifth,
[1:12:28] sixth. So that the all other six ages
[1:12:31] this particular ministry was not given
[1:12:33] to them. But this ministry in order to
[1:12:36] uh sound off all the mysteries uh help
[1:12:38] us understand these mysteries was given
[1:12:40] to the seventh church age messenger. So
[1:12:42] the unveiling happens in the
[1:12:45] seventh not first not the second and now
[1:12:48] now the seventh will be saying things
[1:12:50] that the first said because the church
[1:12:53] started out right in the days of Paul he
[1:12:55] wrote twothirds of the New Testament.
[1:12:57] And so we know the church was right. But
[1:12:59] what happened over the years? The church
[1:13:01] got off the word
[1:13:03] till they got so far off to this day
[1:13:06] Jesus is not even inside the church.
[1:13:11] That's how bad the church is. And and
[1:13:13] here's the sad part about it. They don't
[1:13:15] know it. They don't know it. They
[1:13:17] actually think they praising God. I I
[1:13:20] feel the presence of God. Yeah. Uhhuh.
[1:13:23] But a after all that on the floor crying
[1:13:27] uh sobbing and I mean h I mean everybody
[1:13:29] hands lift up all and then leave church
[1:13:31] and start cursing and don't feel no
[1:13:33] conviction
[1:13:35] drinking smoking.
[1:13:37] Come on now. I mean uh uh uh uh
[1:13:39] fornicating
[1:13:41] adultery all this going on right in the
[1:13:43] church. Don't tell me I know it is. I
[1:13:47] mean supposedly having a revival
[1:13:49] service. Revival for what? Revival for
[1:13:51] fornicators.
[1:13:53] and adulterers because they get together
[1:13:55] and have a have a a service and then
[1:13:57] after the service they go into hotel
[1:13:59] rooms and doing all kind of stuff. Don't
[1:14:01] tell me it ain't happening. I know it
[1:14:03] is. And and people not don't have no
[1:14:06] conviction at all about it.
[1:14:10] And brother Smiley brought out the the
[1:14:13] that that fell. I didn't know what
[1:14:14] brother Smiley was talking about till I
[1:14:15] saw the video.
[1:14:20] a a a preacher with a blouse on
[1:14:23] preaching to the
[1:14:28] people. I I mean, I don't know if I
[1:14:31] think people should have just got up and
[1:14:32] walked out. You come out here like
[1:14:35] dressed like that and got something to
[1:14:37] say to us. What you saying?
[1:14:40] Another thing that's going on in the
[1:14:42] church world is, oh, Lord have mercy.
[1:14:43] The homosexuals done took over
[1:14:48] and ain't repented of nothing. True. And
[1:14:50] feel like they can still live a
[1:14:52] homosexual lifestyle and still preach.
[1:14:56] You ain't saved.
[1:14:58] You ain't get saved. No, you ain't saved
[1:15:00] doing doing all that. No, you're not.
[1:15:03] You religious.
[1:15:07] You're religious. Right. But but but the
[1:15:09] churches in this condition don't even
[1:15:11] and they got millions of people
[1:15:13] following them because these millions of
[1:15:15] people don't want the word.
[1:15:17] They want to live these ungodly lives
[1:15:20] and feel satisfied in it. Amen. Amen. We
[1:15:23] going to keep crying out against it. We
[1:15:25] got to go back to the word. But here,
[1:15:27] here, here, here. And and and if you
[1:15:28] find yourself in a situation like that
[1:15:30] run for your life, get up out of there.
[1:15:31] Don't let don't don't let nobody like
[1:15:33] that come laying hands on you and
[1:15:34] praying for you.
[1:15:37] The Lord is telling me, I need I need to
[1:15:39] pray for you. No, you don't.
[1:15:42] Yeah. Y'all was here that Wednesday
[1:15:43] night. that brother that brother um was
[1:15:47] was uh telling us the testimony how that
[1:15:49] sister uh she was at a church and man
[1:15:51] say I just feel I feel you got something
[1:15:53] to say she said no no I ain't got
[1:15:55] nothing to say no I ain't got nothing to
[1:15:57] say I just feel it in my spirit kept
[1:16:00] going through services I came back to I
[1:16:02] feel you got something to
[1:16:03] say no I ain't got nothing to
[1:16:06] say she sat there like Lord if he come
[1:16:09] back over here again I'mma tell him
[1:16:10] something
[1:16:11] now he go on doing the service Listen, I
[1:16:14] just feel I feel I feel I feel you got
[1:16:16] something to say. Gave that lady the
[1:16:18] mic. I rebuke that homosexual spirit off
[1:16:21] of you in the name of Jesus.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:30] Amen. Church, we need we need folk
[1:16:33] that'll do it just like that. Let me try
[1:16:35] to finish. Let me
[1:16:38] Amen. Amen. You run for your life. Don't
[1:16:40] be running all inside these places. You
[1:16:42] get spirits on you and don't even know
[1:16:44] how you got them on you. That's right.
[1:16:47] Amen. Amen. All right. Let me let me let
[1:16:50] me keep reading. Says, um, the seventh
[1:16:53] angel, Revelation 10:7, the se seventh
[1:16:55] church age messenger. See, now watch in
[1:16:56] the days now watch here. But in the days
[1:16:58] of the voice of the seventh angel, when
[1:17:00] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[1:17:02] God should be finished. That's what's
[1:17:03] promised in in Revelation 10. It says,
[1:17:06] now sounding forth this messenger, the
[1:17:09] seventh angel here is sounding forth the
[1:17:11] message. this message to the Leodysian
[1:17:13] church sounded forth to us. Notice this
[1:17:16] type of message. Now, it wasn't to the
[1:17:18] first angel wasn't given that second
[1:17:20] angel, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, but
[1:17:23] it's the seventh angel that had this
[1:17:26] type of message. What was it? Notice
[1:17:28] this type of message. Finishing all the
[1:17:30] mysteries that's laying loose. End it
[1:17:32] all out through these organizations and
[1:17:35] denominations. That's laying loose. End
[1:17:37] it all out through these organizations,
[1:17:39] denominations. the seventh angel gathers
[1:17:41] them up and finish the entire mystery.
[1:17:43] That's what the Bible says. Finishes the
[1:17:45] mystery of the written book. Now, I'm
[1:17:47] skipping down uh because it gives us uh
[1:17:49] Scoffield's notes and I'm skipping down
[1:17:52] to a paragraph. I think I listed the one
[1:17:54] that I'm skipping to. So, just go there.
[1:17:56] Uh I want to just share with you some of
[1:17:57] the other mis the other mysteries. Uh I
[1:18:00] think it was paragraph 256. I think I
[1:18:02] put there. Um but the some of the other
[1:18:04] mysteries we we talked about serpent
[1:18:06] seed being a mystery. We talked about
[1:18:07] water baptism being a mystery. These are
[1:18:09] some of the other mysteries that God had
[1:18:10] to send down. The mysteries had to come
[1:18:13] down from God. And when it comes down
[1:18:15] from God, it has to go to a prophet
[1:18:17] because the Bible says, "Surely I will
[1:18:19] do nothing unless I reveal my secrets to
[1:18:21] my servants, the prophets." So it has to
[1:18:23] go from God down to a prophet and then
[1:18:26] is given to us. And then then
[1:18:28] Deuteronomy say the secret things belong
[1:18:31] unto the Lord our God. But once they are
[1:18:34] revealed,
[1:18:36] they belong to us.
[1:18:39] So we fellowshipping in here around the
[1:18:42] secret things.
[1:18:45] All right. Here he says uh that's some
[1:18:49] of the mysteries that this angel is
[1:18:50] supposed to wind up all the mysteries of
[1:18:52] God. And the other other one may I say
[1:18:54] this with reverence not to not referring
[1:18:57] to myself but referring to the angel of
[1:18:59] God the serpent seed. That's a mystery
[1:19:01] that's been that's been hidden. Amen. Uh
[1:19:04] uh that's been a hidden mystery all
[1:19:05] throughout through the years. the grace
[1:19:07] straighten out. Not disgrace, but real
[1:19:10] true grace.
[1:19:12] Another mystery. There is no such thing
[1:19:14] as an eternal burning hell. You cannot
[1:19:18] reject Jesus and then go live in hell
[1:19:21] eternally.
[1:19:23] There's only one form of eternal life
[1:19:24] and that's through accepting Christ. So
[1:19:27] at some point in time, hell will
[1:19:29] disintegrate.
[1:19:31] All right? There's no no such thing as
[1:19:33] an eternal hell. People don't got
[1:19:35] confused in the church. Yes, sir. Right.
[1:19:37] So, so here here's another one. He says
[1:19:39] uh he says you'll burn for millions of
[1:19:41] years, but anything that was eternal had
[1:19:44] never beginning or end. Hell was
[1:19:46] created. All these mysteries say the
[1:19:48] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] without sensation. Oh, that's another
[1:19:52] one. Because in church, they told us we
[1:19:54] had to do a lot of stuff in order to get
[1:19:55] the Holy Ghost. And one of them that you
[1:19:57] had to speak in tongues, beat you on the
[1:20:00] back to you just and just say it. Just
[1:20:01] say it just real fast. Say Jesus. Say
[1:20:03] Jesus. Say Jesus. Say Jesus. Say Jesus.
[1:20:06] Now say it faster. Jesus. Jesus. Say it
[1:20:08] faster. Faster. Faster.
[1:20:13] Jesus. God ain't never put that in the
[1:20:16] Bible to tell people just to say Jesus.
[1:20:18] Say Jesus. Say Jesus. That's not that's
[1:20:20] not nowhere in the scripture.
[1:20:23] We had to get those things straight. Now
[1:20:25] people can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:27] without sensation.
[1:20:31] How do we know that? Because John the
[1:20:33] Baptist mama received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:37] without sensation. Exactly. Even John.
[1:20:40] That's right.
[1:20:42] Yes, sir. John got the Holy Ghost while
[1:20:44] he was in his mama's womb.
[1:20:48] Now, who told him to say Jesus?
[1:20:52] Now, here's another thing. Jesus wasn't
[1:20:54] even born while John was in the womb.
[1:20:58] So, who told John to say Jesus? the but
[1:21:00] the Bible say he had the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:04] See, we had these things, but they were
[1:21:06] unscriptural. We got to go back to the
[1:21:08] word. Now, don't don't don't don't don't
[1:21:10] don't get me wrong. I think anything
[1:21:12] that that don't have emotion ought to be
[1:21:14] buried, right? But we not we're not
[1:21:17] basing it on that. It's not an emotion.
[1:21:19] It's not any feel. It's not a feeling.
[1:21:20] It's not any of that. It's I mean, it's
[1:21:22] it's how your life ties up with the word
[1:21:25] after you claim that experience.
[1:21:27] All right, let me keep reading. These
[1:21:29] are some mysteries that have and these
[1:21:30] mysteries are settled on the seventh day
[1:21:34] or in the seventh church age. The
[1:21:37] unveiling happens in the seventh
[1:21:40] day. All right, let me move on. Oh,
[1:21:44] glory. All right. The mystery of baptism
[1:21:46] of the holy ghost without sensation, but
[1:21:47] the person of Christ performing in you
[1:21:49] the same works that he did. The mystery
[1:21:51] of water baptism where the extreme
[1:21:54] trinitarianism has brought it into
[1:21:55] titles of father, son, and the holy
[1:21:57] ghost. and the mystery of the godhead
[1:21:58] being fulfilled in the name in the
[1:22:01] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:22:02] according to the book of revelation that
[1:22:04] the church in this time was to receive
[1:22:07] that's some of the mysteries the pillar
[1:22:08] of fire returning back amen that's the
[1:22:12] thing that's supposed to take place and
[1:22:14] we see it these are things that God
[1:22:16] promised to happen to to happen and they
[1:22:19] have already occurred we're
[1:22:20] fellowshipping around these things I
[1:22:22] just want to show you I suppose it
[1:22:23] happened in the seventh day we go back
[1:22:25] to the book of uh Judges
[1:22:27] And we look at uh just something here
[1:22:30] and I'll wind this up. Um Judges 14 is
[1:22:33] what we read from. And I read verse 17
[1:22:38] uh which said to us, "And she wept
[1:22:41] before him the seven days while their
[1:22:44] feet while while their feast lasted. And
[1:22:47] it came to pass on the seventh day that
[1:22:50] he told her because she because she lay
[1:22:53] sore upon him and she told the riddle to
[1:22:56] the children of her people. Now just to
[1:22:59] kind of give us a little u background of
[1:23:02] what happened here in this
[1:23:03] story. Uh
[1:23:06] Samson here being a
[1:23:09] Israelite was
[1:23:11] um he probably had no idea what his
[1:23:14] purpose was and what God wanted to use
[1:23:16] him for. And
[1:23:18] um uh God had purpose for everything he
[1:23:22] was doing through Samson. Everything he
[1:23:24] was doing through Samson. And Samson
[1:23:25] found himself in a situation where he he
[1:23:28] fell in love with a with a Philist a
[1:23:30] Philistine woman. Now understand these
[1:23:33] women or this nation is their enemies.
[1:23:38] These people are their enemies. Why
[1:23:39] would he fall in love with one of the
[1:23:41] enemies? Who do you think she's going to
[1:23:44] be loyal to?
[1:23:47] Hello, somebody. I mean, young men,
[1:23:50] young women, be careful who you get
[1:23:52] yourself involved with. You want
[1:23:54] somebody that's already loyal to God.
[1:23:57] I'm going to go a little further. Loyal
[1:23:59] to the message.
[1:24:01] Not just calling themselves a Christian,
[1:24:04] right? Amen. You want to know, well,
[1:24:05] what kind of Christian? Because you know
[1:24:07] there's two kind of Christians, right?
[1:24:08] You ain't know that, right? It's a
[1:24:09] Christian of the spirit and a Christian
[1:24:11] of the flesh. So, which kind of
[1:24:14] Christian are you? Hello, somebody. You
[1:24:16] want to know what really is going on uh
[1:24:18] uh uh with this person life. So, so
[1:24:20] Samson said, you know, mom and daddy,
[1:24:22] come on and have a conversation with I'm
[1:24:24] there's this lady down there in Timna. I
[1:24:26] I would I would love I'd love for her to
[1:24:28] be my wife. I saw her one day and I just
[1:24:31] can't get her off my mind and I just I
[1:24:33] just want to go down to Timna and and
[1:24:35] his parents and I and I like this. We'll
[1:24:37] pick it up here in verse um um
[1:24:42] uh
[1:24:44] three. He says
[1:24:48] um and his father then his father and
[1:24:52] mother said unto him, "Is there never a
[1:24:55] woman among the daughters of thy
[1:24:57] brethren, or among all my people, that
[1:25:02] thou goest to take a wife of the
[1:25:04] uncircumcised Philistines?" Now, the
[1:25:07] first thing I want to say, I love this.
[1:25:08] This then his father and his mother.
[1:25:12] The reason I like that is because it
[1:25:13] showed that there was agreement
[1:25:17] in the house. And and you need both the
[1:25:21] father and the mother standing together
[1:25:24] in order to be able to give direction to
[1:25:25] this child. If but if if mama just kind
[1:25:28] of on the side letting the child slide
[1:25:31] by, that's going to be some problems. If
[1:25:33] daddy on the other side kind of letting
[1:25:35] the child do it's going to be some
[1:25:36] problem. You need daddy and mama on the
[1:25:38] same page.
[1:25:41] And and I'm glad that both of them could
[1:25:43] stand there right there and say, Samson,
[1:25:45] you know, we got we got we got we got we
[1:25:47] got young people right in our church.
[1:25:49] And if they ain't in our church, they at
[1:25:51] some of the churches we fellowship with.
[1:25:54] But why you want to go out here? Why do
[1:25:55] you want to pull this boy in from your
[1:25:57] job?
[1:26:02] or this girl you met in college.
[1:26:05] Why you want to pull them in?
[1:26:08] Let them just come on their own. Give
[1:26:10] them the address to the church and let
[1:26:11] them come on their own.
[1:26:14] Amen.
[1:26:17] Not I'll pick you up. Yeah.
[1:26:21] No. You got to watch the devil and
[1:26:23] everything you do. Y'all y'all don't
[1:26:25] know how the devil operate. some of and
[1:26:27] and and I and I'm afraid I'm afraid
[1:26:29] something drastic gonna happen to people
[1:26:31] before they realize how what the devil
[1:26:33] set them up to do. Don't don't do things
[1:26:37] don't do uh the the Bible say don't let
[1:26:40] your good
[1:26:42] be evil spoken of.
[1:26:45] Amen. Sometimes I see things happen say
[1:26:47] wait a minute the Holy Ghost didn't tell
[1:26:49] you not to do that.
[1:26:52] The Holy Ghost should have said no no no
[1:26:53] no no that don't look right. That don't
[1:26:56] look right. That don't look right. That

[1:27:07] your last time. And you ought and and
[1:27:08] from that time, you ought to be
[1:27:10] introducing her to another sister to get

[1:27:49] him to church, we will pay for his Uber.

[1:27:54] you, young lady, if I got to pay for his
[1:27:56] Uber,
[1:28:02] that ought to be a red flag right there.
[1:28:05] If I'm paying for his Uber, red flag.

[1:30:49] keep out a lot of foolishness. Not a lot
[1:30:51] of this. You know, y'all know what
[1:30:53] happened in churches. We've been able to

[1:34:25] out by twos.
[1:34:31] I just want to roll, man. Just let's
[1:34:32] just roll. I know y'all using the word a
[1:34:34] different way than I'm using it, but

[1:34:57] just recently. I mean you know I'm going
[1:34:59] to the grocery store. I'm just going
[1:35:00] grocery store and this lady come walking
[1:35:02] up and man just the way she was dressed.

[1:35:11] different way. I actually I actually
[1:35:13] actually kept my eye up. I ain't looked
[1:35:14] down and I just and then I went straight
[1:35:16] to the bathroom.
[1:35:19] And I said, I said, "Well, I got to go
[1:35:21] get the stuff that I need." I said,
[1:35:23] "Maybe she's somewhere else in the
[1:35:24] store." Guess what aisle the devil put
[1:35:26] on.
[1:35:35] If And if I told you how she was
[1:35:37] dressed, if I told you how this lady was
[1:35:39] dressed and and and and she on the
[1:35:41] aisle, the only aisle that I'm on, she
[1:35:43] on right in the section where I need to
[1:35:45] be.
[1:35:47] dress a certain way.
[1:35:50] I I know they say nothing but the devil.
[1:35:51] Look, I'm the pastor of the church. And
[1:35:54] I know the devil will try me in and so I
[1:35:58] got to put guard rails for myself.
[1:36:02] Amen.
[1:36:04] I'm trying to keep a a righteous
[1:36:06] testimony. I I don't want the devil to
[1:36:08] just get in here and do No, no, no.
[1:36:09] Don't don't play games in these areas.
[1:36:13] Don't do it.
[1:36:18] This is
[1:36:19] um this man Samson. I'm Let me get I'm
[1:36:22] I'm I'm Please Lord.
[1:36:26] This man
[1:36:27] Samson. He shouldn't even went down
[1:36:30] there to get this woman to be his wife.
[1:36:33] His parents are trying to tell him say,
[1:36:35] "Please don't go down there. There's
[1:36:37] other women here. You know, you ain't
[1:36:38] got to go down there and get no wife.
[1:36:40] Get get one of the women right here."
[1:36:41] But they didn't realize God actually was
[1:36:43] using the situation in order to bring
[1:36:46] judgment on the
[1:36:48] Philistines. Oh my. So Samson
[1:36:53] um let's let's pick it up here in verse
[1:36:59] uh five.
[1:37:02] Then went Samson
[1:37:03] down and his father and his mother to
[1:37:07] Timnath and come to the vineyards of
[1:37:10] Timnath. And behold, a young lion roared
[1:37:13] against
[1:37:13] him. And he going to get his wife
[1:37:18] um and his lion ro stands up and roars
[1:37:21] against Samson. Now when that lion
[1:37:22] roaring, that lion mean
[1:37:24] business. Okay? and and they actually
[1:37:26] said that uh when a lion roars, just the
[1:37:30] roar alone
[1:37:32] will bring death.
[1:37:34] The roar alone, but this is a young lion
[1:37:36] that stood up against Samson. Now, uh I
[1:37:40] I don't have time to read it, but you
[1:37:43] know what a prophet said, cuz you know,
[1:37:44] in our minds, we got Samson as
[1:37:46] uh you know, Mr. Atlas. Uh you
[1:37:50] know, yeah, like this boy, he he got to
[1:37:54] walk.
[1:38:01] Well, that that that that's what Samson
[1:38:03] look
[1:38:04] like. But a
[1:38:06] prophet tells us he makes a statement.
[1:38:11] Okay, I I'll read it for you. She say,
[1:38:13] let's read it. So, uh I'll read
[1:38:16] it. Uh where
[1:38:26] No, not not that one. I want to go to
[1:38:31] Paradox. Paradox. They say just read it.
[1:38:33] So, I'll I'll read that. I want you to
[1:38:36] see what Samson was uh through the eyes
[1:38:40] of a
[1:38:41] prophet.
[1:38:43] Amen. Amen. All right. Quickly, uh
[1:38:48] paradox. It says um it was a
[1:38:53] paradox. It might be on the back of the
[1:38:55] page there. It was a paradox when little
[1:39:00] curlyheaded
[1:39:02] boy, little stoopshouldered fellow, he
[1:39:06] probably
[1:39:08] wasn't five foot tall.
[1:39:13] You you over five feet, right? Both of
[1:39:15] y'all fellas over five feet. I don't
[1:39:16] think Xander over 5T but
[1:39:20] Samson
[1:39:22] Samson Samson wasn't even five feet
[1:39:29] tall shrimp is what they call him right
[1:39:34] but Samson the reason that he could do
[1:39:38] some of the things he did it wasn't
[1:39:41] Samson doing it
[1:39:43] but it was the spirit of God coming on
[1:39:47] Samson that allowed him to do this. Can
[1:39:50] you imagine this fella under five feet,
[1:39:55] picking up gates and throwing them on
[1:39:58] his shoulders? Every time they try to
[1:39:59] put him in bondage, he throw the thing
[1:40:01] on his shoulders, he out of there. They
[1:40:03] send a thousand men, a thousand men
[1:40:06] coming after a man that's under five
[1:40:08] feet tall.
[1:40:11] This is This is This is really amazing.
[1:40:13] This man is under five feet. It's going
[1:40:15] to take a thousand of y'all to get him.
[1:40:18] That's what happened when God is inside
[1:40:21] of you.
[1:40:23] And here, here, here, you know, a
[1:40:24] thousand men come and and and and Samson
[1:40:26] say, "Now, as long as y'all promise me
[1:40:28] y'all going to deliver me to these
[1:40:29] Philistines." Yeah. They coming to get
[1:40:30] you, Samson. They're going to kill us if
[1:40:31] if we don't deliver you. All right. Just
[1:40:33] long as y'all don't y'all don't lay
[1:40:35] hands on me, I'll go with them
[1:40:36] Philistines. He get there going with
[1:40:37] them Philistines. And all of a sudden,
[1:40:38] the spirit of the Lord come upon Samson
[1:40:40] and he reached down and found the
[1:40:42] jawbone of a mule.
[1:40:44] picks it up under five
[1:40:48] feet. Y'all, I don't know if we get it.
[1:40:50] How is a man under five feet going to
[1:40:53] hit a man that's six feet or seven foot?
[1:40:56] How he gonna knock get him down with a
[1:40:58] jawbone? How is this going to you? You
[1:41:01] know, this ain't nothing but the
[1:41:02] supernatural God doing this.
[1:41:05] Ain't this man the jaw bone jawbone
[1:41:08] would break? One one hit the jawbone
[1:41:10] would break. I mean, it just it's too
[1:41:12] many things happening here that don't
[1:41:13] make no sense. And when it don't make no
[1:41:16] sense, it must be God.
[1:41:19] [Applause]
[1:41:23] But when we see Samson here in the
[1:41:26] scripture, he marries this lady and um
[1:41:29] the lion is coming has come upon him and
[1:41:32] and and let's read this in in in in in
[1:41:34] the scripture.
[1:41:36] It says
[1:41:37] um verse 5, then then went Samson down
[1:41:40] and his and his father and his mother to
[1:41:42] Timnath and came to the vineyards of
[1:41:44] Timnath. And behold, a young lion wrote
[1:41:47] against him, and the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:48] came mightily upon him. And he rent him
[1:41:53] as he would have rent a kid, and he had
[1:41:56] nothing in his hand, but he told not his
[1:42:00] father or mother uh what he had done. So
[1:42:02] he towed the lion to
[1:42:04] pieces, rolled up against some Samson
[1:42:06] and ripped the lion
[1:42:08] apart. The only way he could do that is
[1:42:11] because the spirit of the Lord was on
[1:42:12] him to do it. Now watch this. And he
[1:42:15] went down and talked with the woman, and
[1:42:18] she pleased Samson
[1:42:21] well. And after time, he returned to
[1:42:24] take her, and he turned aside to see the
[1:42:25] carcass of the lion. And behold, there
[1:42:28] was a swarm of bees and honey in the
[1:42:31] carcass of the
[1:42:33] lion. And he took thereof in his hands,
[1:42:36] and went on eating, and came to his
[1:42:38] father and mother, and it gave them, and
[1:42:40] they did eat. But he told not them that
[1:42:44] he had taken the honey out of the
[1:42:46] carcass of the lion. And brother
[1:42:49] Brandham makes a statement, and again,
[1:42:51] I'm short of time, so I'll just quote
[1:42:52] this. He says it's when we overcome
[1:42:55] something that we get the sweetest,
[1:43:00] the sweetest victory. It's after we have
[1:43:03] overcome something. So you got to go
[1:43:06] through something in order to enjoy
[1:43:08] sweet victory.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. He said that right here in
[1:43:14] West Palm Beach, but I ain't got time to
[1:43:16] read it for you. But uh but but but but
[1:43:19] here's Samson. Samson, you know, is
[1:43:20] giving people this honey after he's
[1:43:22] overcome, you know, this lion. Uh, and
[1:43:24] and I just I just like this.
[1:43:28] Um, I I just I like this. Oh my I was
[1:43:32] just looking at a few things here and
[1:43:34] and Samson is fighting a lion and he
[1:43:38] overcomes. He overcomes. He overcomes.
[1:43:41] We were reading there in Revelation 10
[1:43:45] um and it said that uh he cried with a
[1:43:49] loud voice as when a lion roarth and
[1:43:52] when he cried seven thunders uttered
[1:43:54] their voices. So here Samson is having
[1:43:58] this experience with this lion. Amen.
[1:44:01] And we're also having experience where
[1:44:03] the seven thunders are uttering as the
[1:44:06] voice of a lion. We're getting this too.
[1:44:10] Amen. And it happens on the seventh
[1:44:13] day. Look at this now. Um this verse
[1:44:16] says
[1:44:19] um verse nine I believe it is. It says,
[1:44:23] "And he took thereof in his hands and
[1:44:25] went out went on eating and came to his
[1:44:27] father and mother and he gave them and
[1:44:29] they did
[1:44:30] eat but he told them not that he had
[1:44:33] taken the honey out of the carcass of
[1:44:35] the lion." So his father went down unto
[1:44:38] the woman and Samson made their feast
[1:44:41] for so used uh the young man. So so used
[1:44:44] the young men to do says and it came to
[1:44:47] pass when they saw him that they brought
[1:44:49] 30 companions to be with him. And Samson
[1:44:52] said unto them it I will now put forth a
[1:44:54] riddle unto you. If you can certainly
[1:44:57] declare it to me within the seven days
[1:45:00] of the feast and find it out, then I
[1:45:03] will give you 30 30 sheets and 30 change
[1:45:06] of garments. But if you cannot declare
[1:45:09] it me, then shall you give me 30 sheets
[1:45:12] and 30 change of garments. And they said
[1:45:14] unto him, Put forth thy riddle that we
[1:45:17] may hear it. And he said unto them, "Out
[1:45:20] of the eater came forth meat, and out of
[1:45:24] the stone came forth sweetness." And
[1:45:28] they could not in three days expound the
[1:45:31] riddle. Now, why couldn't they do it in
[1:45:33] three days? Because it wasn't for them
[1:45:35] to do it in three days. It wasn't for
[1:45:38] them to get it on the first day, the
[1:45:41] second day, the third day, the fourth
[1:45:43] day, the fifth day, the sixth day. But
[1:45:46] the riddle or the mystery is
[1:45:49] unveiled on the seventh day.
[1:45:52] Now let's see how they got this.
[1:45:58] And it came to
[1:46:00] pass on the seventh day that they said
[1:46:04] unto Samson's wife, "Entic thy husband,
[1:46:09] that he may declare unto us the riddle,
[1:46:12] lest we burn thee and thy father's house
[1:46:14] with
[1:46:15] fire. Have ye called us to ha have ye
[1:46:18] called us to take that we have uh is it
[1:46:21] is it not so?" So here they're they're
[1:46:23] um threatening her pretty much. And um
[1:46:27] so again, if she she don't have no real
[1:46:29] experience with God, she going to fall
[1:46:31] back into some of these areas. But when
[1:46:33] you got somebody that can stand to uh
[1:46:35] shoulder-to-shoulder with you, then you
[1:46:37] got somebody you got an eternal mate
[1:46:38] from glory. But but she's falling back
[1:46:40] into, you know, some of this. And she's
[1:46:42] married, but she her loyalty is not to
[1:46:44] Samson. Her loyalty is to her people. Oh
[1:46:47] my my my. There's a lot being said there
[1:46:50] because sometimes folks loyalty to their
[1:46:52] family members, to their friends, to
[1:46:55] their job, not to their mate.
[1:46:59] Amen. I'm my loyalty to the business,
[1:47:02] not to you.
[1:47:05] Right? You got to watch these things.
[1:47:07] Amen. But here, Samson, um, he has his
[1:47:10] wife, and again, he shouldn't have been
[1:47:11] down here with her in the first place,
[1:47:12] but God was using it. And and and if you
[1:47:15] get yourself tied up in something, God
[1:47:17] has no know God has a way of
[1:47:19] making a message out of your mess.
[1:47:26] God can make a message out of your mess.
[1:47:29] All right, let's go on. And it says, um,
[1:47:33] Samson's wife wept before him and said,
[1:47:36] "Thou dost but hate me, but she put on
[1:47:39] these tears heavy." She she had nothing
[1:47:41] to cry for. But my family getting ready
[1:47:44] to die if I don't under if you don't
[1:47:46] reveal to me this mystery. So Samson's
[1:47:49] wife wept before him and said, "Thou
[1:47:51] dost but hate me and lovest me not. Thou
[1:47:54] hast put forth a riddle unto the
[1:47:56] children of my people, and has not told
[1:47:59] told it
[1:48:00] me." It says, "And he said unto her,
[1:48:03] Behold, I have not told it my father,
[1:48:05] nor my mother. And shall I tell it uh
[1:48:08] thee?" and she wept before him the seven
[1:48:13] days while uh their uh feast lasted. And
[1:48:17] it came to pass on the seventh day that
[1:48:21] he told her because she lay so upon him
[1:48:26] and she and uh and uh lay lay so upon
[1:48:29] him and she and she told the riddle to
[1:48:32] the children of her people. Now I need
[1:48:33] you to understand there was a comma put
[1:48:35] there, right? or I'm sorry, a colon. Um,
[1:48:40] when Samson
[1:48:41] unveiled this mystery on the seventh
[1:48:44] day, he simply wanted to unveil it to
[1:48:48] his wife.
[1:48:50] And and and here this unveiling of the
[1:48:53] word in this day is actually been given
[1:48:56] to the bride. I said on Wednesday night
[1:48:58] that you can't take this and give it to
[1:49:00] the denominations cuz they don't know
[1:49:02] how to handle this, right? But but this
[1:49:05] message was given to the bride. It was
[1:49:07] given to her on the seventh day she got
[1:49:10] the interpretation of what she needed.
[1:49:13] Problem is she did something wrong with
[1:49:15] it.
[1:49:19] Now, she don't realize by her giving
[1:49:24] this information to Samson,
[1:49:27] um I'm I'm sorry, giving this
[1:49:28] information to, you know, her people, uh
[1:49:31] by her being married to Samson, there
[1:49:33] could have been a time that maybe she
[1:49:34] would have been spared later on, but she
[1:49:36] just thought about death, death, death.
[1:49:37] But, you know, when Samson died, I
[1:49:38] believe she died, too, because there's a
[1:49:41] whole bunch of people died in in the
[1:49:43] under the Philistine kingdom died that
[1:49:45] day when Samson died. But she might have
[1:49:47] been preserved from that if she just
[1:49:49] held this mystery. Oh my. Now Samson uh
[1:49:55] as we see there in scripture, he he
[1:49:56] finally gave her the information on the
[1:49:59] seventh day. It only it did not come on
[1:50:02] day one, day two, day three, day four,
[1:50:06] day five, day six. It only came on the
[1:50:09] seventh day. And it was strictly for
[1:50:12] her. But I'm here to tell you that God
[1:50:14] also released revelation, brought it
[1:50:17] down from heaven through the voice of a
[1:50:20] prophet. And it's the mysteries is the
[1:50:23] word of God coming down to be given to
[1:50:25] us. And we have that and we're
[1:50:28] fellowshipping around these secrets.
[1:50:30] Thank God there has been an
[1:50:32] unveiling on the seventh day.
[1:50:36] God richly bless you,
[1:50:40] church.
[1:50:42] Amen. Amen. Let us have a word of
[1:50:45] prayer. Praise God.
[1:50:47] Father, we are grateful for
[1:50:52] um your word. We thank you, Lord, for
[1:50:55] truth. We thank you, oh God, that you
[1:50:58] could just show us, Lord, just from some
[1:51:00] of these Old Testament types, God,
[1:51:04] things that you're doing here, present
[1:51:05] tense. and uh throughout the ages as we
[1:51:08] read there earlier
[1:51:10] um uh it there's this there's a future
[1:51:15] work that you're doing through the seven
[1:51:16] church ages and if we can catch the
[1:51:19] Jesus that's doing the future work is
[1:51:22] the same Jesus that died on the cross
[1:51:25] Lord it would just be uh just an
[1:51:28] eyeopening experience for us so father I
[1:51:31] just pray that you would help us to um
[1:51:34] uh to receive Lord and and walk in what
[1:51:36] you have done uh in this hour. And Lord,
[1:51:38] let us be mindful of some of these
[1:51:41] things. We even see Lord with with
[1:51:43] Samson, thank God, the parents were on
[1:51:45] the same page. And even though you had a
[1:51:47] purpose, it showed that those parents
[1:51:49] were trying to guide him in the right
[1:51:51] direction. And Lord, we need parents
[1:51:53] that will do that today. Help us, Lord,
[1:51:55] to be mindful of of just every step that
[1:51:57] we're taking. The enemy is lurking. The
[1:52:00] enemy is busy. The enemy wants to use
[1:52:04] something, Lord, to to just destroy and
[1:52:06] break up this church. But we have to be
[1:52:08] watchful of everything that he does. I
[1:52:11] pray, Lord, that that parents would have
[1:52:12] the strength, Lord, to stand
[1:52:14] shoulder-to-shoulder even to guide their
[1:52:15] children through this next phase of
[1:52:17] life. Lord, help them, Father, to see,
[1:52:20] oh God, how important it is for their
[1:52:22] their little ones, their young ones to,
[1:52:24] Lord, to to stay and marry within and
[1:52:26] Lord, not not look for people outside.
[1:52:28] The Bible says we should not be
[1:52:30] unequally yolked. So Lord, help us,
[1:52:33] Father, to just be patient and to wait
[1:52:34] on you and to make a commitment, Lord,
[1:52:36] that we will follow your word. Bless
[1:52:39] your people. Thank you, Father, for your
[1:52:40] word. Thank you for this service that
[1:52:42] you've given us today. You are you're
[1:52:44] great and greatly to be praised. And we
[1:52:45] just appreciate all that you do. It's in
[1:52:47] Jesus name that we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:51] Praise the Lord. I'm going to have
[1:52:52] brother Solomon come. I I wanted to also
[1:52:54] I think the announcement was made for
[1:52:56] the musicians uh rehearsal and uh that
[1:53:00] is only for the musicians not not for
[1:53:03] the not for the singers. We we want to
[1:53:05] get the musicians together. Amen. For
[1:53:07] that one. So please singers don't come.
[1:53:10] Just keep continue to send uh that we
[1:53:12] are trying to make some arrangements
[1:53:14] that we can uh get some rehearsal times
[1:53:16] set here. Uh but uh but for this first
[1:53:19] one it'll just be the musicians only.

[1:59:34] heaven, Lord. Let it
[1:59:39] rain. Lord, let it
[1:59:43] rain." Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads.
[1:59:46] Father, Father, we thank you, Lord
[1:59:49] Jesus, for revelation, Lord. It's what
[1:59:53] we need most, Father God, more than our
[1:59:56] daily food, Lord God. We need
[1:59:58] revelation, especially in this hour of
[2:00:01] deception, Lord
[2:00:03] Jesus. We're living now in Satan's Eden,
[2:00:05] Lord, when he has perfected his craft,
[2:00:07] Lord. Father, we heard a word of
[2:00:10] warning, Lord, to keep the boundaries,
[2:00:13] Lord. Lord, as the prophet would say,
[2:00:16] there was a song sung. They let down the
[2:00:18] bars. The sheep got out and and the
[2:00:21] goats got in.
[2:00:23] Father, we don't want to let down the B
[2:00:25] boundaries, Father. We want to keep the
[2:00:27] sheep, Lord. Lord, in a in a in a safe
[2:00:31] pasture, Lord Jesus. So, Father, we as
[2:00:34] parents, the young people, Lord, they
[2:00:37] must hold to the boundaries that their
[2:00:39] parents set, Lord, and we must watch
[2:00:41] over our children, our pastors watching
[2:00:44] over the flock, Lord Jesus. And Father,
[2:00:47] we want to protect one another, Lord.
[2:00:51] Father, not to allow Satan to set traps
[2:00:53] for us. Lord, when we see a brother or
[2:00:56] sister going down a path that he
[2:00:58] shouldn't go, Lord, we want to speak to
[2:01:00] them. Lord, call them to the side and
[2:01:02] give them a word of advice, a word of
[2:01:05] war of warning. Father Cain said, "Am I
[2:01:09] my brother's keeper?" Lord, we are our
[2:01:11] brothers and sisters keeper. Lord, we
[2:01:13] want to make sure that they're safe.
[2:01:14] Lord, we are going to the same place. We
[2:01:17] don't want our young people scarred. We
[2:01:19] don't want our middle age scarred. We
[2:01:21] don't want the elderly scarred, Lord
[2:01:23] Jesus. Father, we're here, Lord God.
[2:01:26] This is a a spiritual hospital where
[2:01:28] your people, Lord, can receive help. And
[2:01:31] Lord, I believe we receive the word this
[2:01:33] morning, Lord, that can help us each
[2:01:35] one. And Father, may we all take heed to
[2:01:38] your word, Lord. May we meditate on
[2:01:40] these things, Lord. When we leave this
[2:01:42] place, Lord, may we not talk about the
[2:01:44] other things, Lord, but meditate on the
[2:01:47] word of God. Father, we ask that you
[2:01:49] would bless our pastor. Lord, we thank
[2:01:51] you for the heart that you have given
[2:01:53] him. We thank you for leading him and
[2:01:55] guiding him. We thank you for opening
[2:01:57] the word to him that he would speak your
[2:01:59] word to us and you would give us the
[2:02:01] revelation of it. Father, thank you and
[2:02:03] we pray that you would bless him,
[2:02:05] restore his strength, bless him
[2:02:07] everything he puts his hand to not only
[2:02:09] he but this congregation, Lord Jesus,
[2:02:12] the people, Lord God, that are feeding
[2:02:14] on your word. As we read in the
[2:02:16] scripture early, Lord, you will withhold
[2:02:19] no good thing from those who are walking
[2:02:21] uprightly before you. So bless these
[2:02:24] people as we prepare to leave this
[2:02:26] place. May we walk uprightly in this
[2:02:28] evil age that we're living in. Father,
[2:02:30] keep your people. Protect them on every
[2:02:33] set side. Place a hedge about them.
[2:02:35] Lord, we know that Satan's trying to set
[2:02:37] traps, Lord, and he would do anything to
[2:02:40] take one sheep out of the fold. So bless
[2:02:42] your people. Go before us. make our way
[2:02:44] prosperous in you. We ask these things
[2:02:46] now in Jesus Christ's name, our Lord and
[2:02:49] Savior. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[2:02:52] brothers and sisters. You may have your
[2:02:53] seats and our brother will come and
[2:02:56] dismiss you at this time. God richly
[2:02:57] bless you each one.
