was saying we uh we had quite the day yesterday I had uh never been a part of anything like that myself and uh we were enjoying the the Florida Sun I think uh I think my nose took the brunt of it uh so I thought figured hey that'll give everybody something to focus on but uh I uh appreciate brother brother brother Jack uh allowing me sharing his pull pit with me and uh allowing me to uh to speak even if it's to a small part of the Bride it's uh always uh an honor and a privilege to stand before before his his his children so uh let me go my glasses hang on here so if we could turn to uh we're going to turn to John 1 John 1 oneise the Lord good to see my brother Mark got it yeah God bless you brother good to see you okay so John 1 we're going to go 1:5 in the in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not prise God let's pray amen dear heavenly father Lord as I stand here before your people here father Lord there is absolutely nothing that I could say that would be worth anything Lord Lord this is where we lean upon you father to use your humble servant father Lord I just pray that you would just speak through me father Lord I just pray that anything that comes out of my mouth would be your words Lord if I'm about to say anything that would be mine or anything that would be unpleasing to you father I pray you would just shut my mouth Lord Lord I pray that you would open the hearts that are here to receive what you would have for us Lord Lord just we just pray that you would just be in this service and you would just take complete control Lord we just love you and we just thank you with all of our hearts in Jesus name I pray amen amen you may be seated thank you so my uh my title tonight is and the Darkness comprehended it not and I want to kind of hone in on that word comprehended I looked the the definition of this word up in the Webster dictionary the meaning is to grasp the nature of significance or meaning of on dictionary.com definition to understand the nature or meaning of grasp with the Mind perceive so this sermon you all just bear with me because we could feel like we're going all over the place but uh with the help of the Lord we'll pray everything ties together at the end so before I even get started I want to tell you guys a story and uh I think most everybody here has heard my testimony heard our our our my my my family's background and you know how we were we were born we were raised in the message me and my wife got married had a couple couple young ladies um we went 19 years in our marriage before we were about to to to give it up and the Lord intervened and and brought us back in into the fellowship and and got us back into church and um that's been about seven years ago now and uh so I had known I'm sure I'm pretty sure everybody here knows brother Trevor Ean and I met brother Trevor Eman in 199 97 and uh me and him remained good friends um from then on we just really hit it off and uh so when we came back to church and brother Trevor played a big part in us coming back to church um I leaned on brother Trevor a lot uh through our our first year first couple years and uh just asking him I I would take we would go out to lunch after a Sunday morning every single week we would go out to lunch and I would just wear him out with questions I mean we're talking about two hour lunches here you know I mean I would just wear him out and uh I remember sitting one time and uh this we' probably been coming back to church now for uh maybe about six months and uh we went out to lunch and we get on the subject of the Holy Ghost and uh brother Trevor took the opportunity and he looked at me and he said uh so do you have the Holy Ghost now we'd been back in church about six months my lifestyle I was probably sitting at that luncheon with my shorts on my lifestyle looked like we came to church on Sunday morning that was it Sunday evening I had a tea time right that's what I did that's what that's what our church life looked like okay Sunday morning we came to church Sunday evening I was playing golf he looks at me he says do you have the Holy Ghost I say yes sir I do because I had had an experience in 1997 and I thought I had received the Holy Ghost now that experience in 199 97 it was in Pennsylvania brother Billy Paul brownon was having some meetings there and I went up for prayer and when I went up for prayer I told Brother Billy when he before he prayed I need the Holy Ghost so bad is exactly how I I put it and I remember his prayer and I'll I'll remember his prayer the rest of my life and it got very emotional and there was crawling to the altar basically after he got done praying and I was there just crying there was a lot of emotion there and I thought that I had received the Holy Ghost but as my life started going you could see something wasn't right all right now I couldn't see this but you could see something wasn't right so I told brother Trevor yes I have the Holy Ghost cuz and then then what what's brother Trevor going to say back to me okay you know what do you what do you say to somebody that's living a lifestyle and they're and but they're claiming to have the Holy Ghost what do you say to him we live in the Leo Dean age Amen brother the prophet in 63 The Sermon Just One More Time Lord he said the Bible said the rich Leo deia Church age would have need of nothing and not know that she was naked blind miserable and don't even know it that was the condition I was sitting in right there when brother Brandon made these statements back in between 47 and 65 sir I don't believe that he was making these statements for Pentecostal or Baptist people believe he was making that statement for message Believers right now that's right have need of nothing I've got the Holy Ghost I'm going to a message church I don't need anything I'm good to go come on brother but there I sat having lunch with brother Trevor yes sir I've got the Holy Ghost fast fast forward 2019 I did receive the Holy Ghost this was a couple years after we had been back in church I can still remember that time because I can I I remember brother Brown talking about from that time and I can still say from that time then I saw a change in my life brother Aaron Oglesby was preaching we were having some special meetings there was a prayer line going there's people going through the prayer line I didn't go through the prayer line I was just sitting there in my Pew praying I can't say there was a whole lot of emotion going on I knew he was there amen amen had a tear maybe run down my cheek I'm not even going to necess necessarily say I knew what had happened in that moment but I do think back to that and think brother Jack I wonder if brother brandham would have been standing there having that prayer line wow would he have looked out would he have said the brother sitting on the end of that row Hallelujah you just got what you were looking for Glory yes amen so I received the Holy Ghost then when I received the Holy Ghost undoubtedly the first thing that changed for me was my desire to go to church I didn't care if it was Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday night special meetings somebody else's Church my home Church my desire to go to church astronomically changed I didn't just want to go to church I wanted to get there early Amen to church amen was about a year after me receiving the Holy Ghost brother Nathan Bryant which is the pastor of our church he he allowed me a Sunday night to give my testimony right before I gave my testimony I I had my youngest daughter I had her sing a song you guys might know this song it's it's called church and I find that even this was back in 2020 but I looked back at this song and it was just so relevant to even now and just this this is where I was at so I'm just going to read I'm I'm going to read a verse of it and and then and then the course so the the first verse is oh more than an obligation an obligation he's talking about going to church yes sir it's more than an obligation amen now brother Jack will tell you you need to come to church the Bible tells you you need to come to church brother brandom was very adamant about going to church see that's the obligation that we have but it's more than an obligation see something happened inside of here that made me want to come to church which made it more than an obligation to me it wasn't an obligation I wanted to come to church amen so more than an obligation it's our foundation this is where we build a foundation under the voice I don't care if it's a tape I don't care if it's a holy ghost filled Minister amen but your foundation is built right here amen when the tough times come the foundation you build here is what holds you through that getting that Holy Ghost in you will get you through those times right amen the family of God I know it's hard but we need each other we're sisters and brothers this is my family right here praise God right here we need each other amen and we all know there's always Things Between Brothers and Sisters right think brother Rand said we fight in the backyard we unite in the front you know we're going to have troubles it's hard this is hard this is a big family it's hard but we need each other we get strength from each other Hallelujah it is important to be in church take me back to the place that feels like home my family here at home amen the people I can depend on the faith that's in my bones I love that it's in my bones if I'm a Christian now or if I'm a if I'm a Child of God now I was always a child of God it was in my bones that's right take me back to a preacher in a verse maybe a prophet in a quote right where they've seen me at my worst to the love I had at first oh I want to go to church all right all right that song was so me when I first got the Holy Ghost it still is me but that was the first thing that hit me I want to go to church amen while we're thinking on that let's turn to John 4 we're going to read 16-9 very very familiar brother random talk talks about this story I think more than any other story in the Bible Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that sayest thou truly the woman saith unto him sir I perceive interesting perceive comprehend if I remember we just read the definition of comprehend I perceive that thou art a prophet so my question is what happened here this woman which was a sinner which was living a lifestyle that she had no business living yes sir she wasn't living right this this woman was not in fact brother Bri talks about she had to come to this well at a particular time of the day because the other sisters did not want to associate with her brother she was not a good person morally I she was not good right but what happened right here in this moment sir I perceive that thou art a prophet she comprehended something right there now this was a conversation that took over just a few minutes of time this didn't take days or weeks this wasn't her coming to church year after year this took place in just a few minutes what was it that would change This Woman's life forever in just a few minutes of time what was that 180 Dee turn this woman made she was heading this way in just a few minutes she's heading the other way while you're thinking about that I'm going to tell you another story so when I came back to church I've always been a big fan of sports so Super Bowl I love the Super Bowl Super Bowl lands on Sunday right come on brother I'm a big fan of golf all right brother Jack I know you know what the riter cup is for those who don't know what the Ryder Cup is this is a golf tournament but it only happens once every other year and it's when the USA plays the Europeans love this tournament it's like no other everybody always you know talking about golf how they just barely clap their hands everybody's real quiet not in this tournament uh-uh it's on I mean you got people screaming USA USA and if you're in Europe and you know takes place here one year and then two years later it's in Europe and I mean these people get crazy into this tournament it is a really cool tournament but see the problem is is the final day is on Sunday all right so as I'm coming back to church I got to make a choice here because I know the Super Bowl's coming up I know the Ridder Cup's coming up but see there's a difference in me something happened to me I received the Holy Ghost amen so when the Super Bowl came up said no I can record that because I want to go to church right when the writer cup came up no I want to go to church I can watch this later I found something better than the Super Bowl amen and actually let me rephrase that something found me that was better than the Super Bowl he came looking for me I didn't go looking for him he found me yes amen hallelujah anybody getting any confused at all as to where we're going with this I hope so may have you right where I want you let's turn to acts nine we're going to read 1 to six and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round him round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do we're all very familiar with this story this is Paul at this point the name is Saul name gets changed to Paul this man was raised in a church yes sir maybe it was considered a message church I don't know but he was raised to know the Bible he knew the scripture he knew him frontwards and backwards this man was persecuting the church the the church the real Church he was coming after any anyone because he thought he was doing God a service this man wasn't doing this to be evil he thought he was doing God a service I mean this man was you know taught under Gia which was supposed to be one of I mean the the the best teachers there were I mean Paul knew his stuff and he was persecuting the church he had lived his life like his entire life yeah is how he lived and then in a moment something happens to him my question is what happened to him what would take do you know how hard it is to reach somebody in this condition right here when they know it all right when they know everything now we're going back to I don't need anything because I've got it all I know everything this is like the hardest person that brother Jack will ever have to reach this is the hardest person that any of you trying to testify to somebody these are the hardest people to reach because they know it they're already in the message Church they know everything they don't need anything that's right brother but what happened to him because this was in a moment same thing woman at the well in a moment yes 180 degree turn yes so the quick easy answer to this is they met Christ right is that the answer brother Mark is that the answer seems like it would be the answer sorry I'm picking on brother Mark I don't have anybody else to pick on it seems like that would be right all right that they just came in contact with Christ while we're thinking about that let me tell you another story so after I had re received the Holy the Holy Ghost I believe it was a couple years after this me and my wife decided we're going to take a uh trip for our anniversary so we tra we take a trip to San Antonio and we get a a hotel on the the the Riverwalk it's beautiful we have a really good time there um really pretty city if you've never been and uh last night we're there we decide that we're going to go to a restaurant right on the river so as we're walking down the river trying to decide which one we come to this um I think it was like an Irish some sort of restaurant restaurant we're reading the menu hey this looks pretty good so we'll you know we get tell them hey we're going to eat two table for two outside man the the guy sets us I mean I'm sitting if we're if the table's here I mean the river is right there I mean it it's just it's a beautiful spot we sit down and I look down and there's a drink menu now my wife can attest to I have never been a big drinker even when we were out in the world doing our thing that was just not my thing drinking there was a couple drinks that I kind of liked though I look down at the menu and on the menu is one of my favorite drinks favorite I'm thinking San Antonio Texas there's nobody around here that's going to know who I am this isn't going to get me drunk or anything just a tiny bit of alcohol in this drink what's the big deal so order the drink waiter comes he sets it down I'm just being transparent with you all he sets a drink down I look at the drink I look at my wife I look back at the drink I look over at her and I say I cannot believe the conviction that I'm feeling right now over one little drink now I'm going to be really transparent and I'm going to tell you the rest of this story I drank the drink even though there was something inside of here that was asking it was begging don't do this don't do it my flesh overrode that now there will be people that will tell you there was no way in the world that I had the holy ghost that it's not even possible How could a holy ghost filled Christian be sitting at a table order an a drink of alcohol and drink it and then claim I had the Holy Ghost I was just sitting with Trevor a few years ago in my shorts playing golf Sunday morning I was telling him the same thing yeah I've got the Holy Ghost but see there was a difference when I was playing golf on Sunday when I was sitting there talking to brother Trevor in my shorts there was nothing there nothing there when I ordered that drink I could tell with everything in me I looked at her and said the conviction something was inside of there that was making this different it was begging me don't do this doesn't matter if somebody's standing around watching you you know this is not right all right Jesus Jes there's a difference in a child of God walking into a trap that Satan sets and slipping and falling you've got the Holy Ghost you're going to get back up but there's a difference between slipping and falling and living a lifestyle I took that drink and I have never taken a drink s because I remember how it felt in here I remember the feeling I had towards him I love him I don't want to disappoint him I know what he's done for me Hallelujah I didn't go back to the bar the next week and order another drink and again and again that is a lifestyle I slipped I fell and then by his grace I got back up and started moving forward [Applause] again now there will be ministers that will tell you there's no way I had the Holy Ghost there's no way somebody with the Holy Ghost would do something like that 1961 you must be born again yes sir brother God is getting manifested Sons right now manifesting tell them all about this tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're man manifested sons of God nonsense the prophet says with an explanation point nonsense where you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to men I was a baby I was growing you've got to give the person the opportunity to grow this is a progression now you should see progression we shouldn't be going backwards we should be constantly moving forward you slip you fall you get up and move forward not backwards but you got to have an opportunity to grow Hallelujah but that wasn't the person sitting there that was saying don't take that drink that wasn't me I obviously wanted the drink or I wouldn't have ordered the drink right this flesh wanted that drink but there was something more there there was something down inside that was saying don't do that Hallelujah let's go to numbers 13 we're going to go 30 through 33 and Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome come it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there was and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we are we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we in their sight brother briam talks about this moment right here he talks about Caleb telling the telling the people we can do this Joshua bouncing up and down banging his chest saying come on we can do this people we can do this we can take this he promised that land to us but these other men came back said no we can't we can't do this two million people that came out of Egypt come to this point right here and only two of them out of two million said we can take this land what happened to the other 1,998 people what was the difference they'd walked the same Journey that Caleb and Jos had walked right they'd seen the same Miracles the same signs and wonders they were sitting under the same Prophet what happened to cause this I wonder if those two million I wonder what they thought about their prophit I wonder how well they knew their Prophet I wonder if they knew his favorite gun I wonder if they knew the the name of his favorite dog right maybe his favorite horse how well did they know that prophet and maybe some of them were like no no that's not us we don't we don't have that deity spirit on us I wonder how well they knew their Pastor wonder if they could have told you like what size pants he wore what size shoe he wore I'm not saying that there's absolutely anything wrong with buying brother Jack a pair of pants but if you can do it and you don't have to ask sister Erica what size pants he wears there could be a problem you might want to check on that but what was it that separated these two men from the others while you think about that I'm GNA tell you another story so before I came back to church as I forem mentioned I love golf love to play golf and me and a group of guys we would go out and to make it a little bit interesting brother Mark we throw a little bit of money on it we get a game going wasn't nothing big if you did really good I would have paid for my round yesterday nothing big nothing major but see after I received the Holy Ghost my buddy calls me up he says hey we're going to go play Friday morning you going to play sure I'll be there and then I started thinking on the way to the golf course these guys are going to ask me what are we playing and something in here starts telling me you can't do do this now we're not talking about a lot of money and I remember I'd been thinking about this and I had remembered that brother Nathan had just played a tape in our church not too long before this moment and I remember brother brandom saying not even for a nickel it's not right so something in here starts telling me you can't do this so I get to the golf course we get to the first tea box and I still remember this moment I remember standing there with my club in my hand the guys were behind me talking about what game they're going to play and I'm just swinging the club back and forth because Jonathan halin wanted to gamble because the only when you're standing over a birdie Putt and that heart starts pounding a little bit put some money on it then that heart really starts pounding it just makes it a little bit more interesting but it's not right it wasn't right so I'm standing there and I know they're getting ready to ask me and here comes a moment for me right here same moment brother Mark is ordering that drink it's coming and I know it's coming I know Satan has set this moment up right here for me what am I going to do hey Jonathan what game you want to play not today guys not today because there was something inside of here that was saying don't do it Jonathan howchin the Flesh of Jonathan hch everything in me wanted to do it but there was something else in here that was saying don't do it son amen amen praise God John 6 56-61 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which come down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernium many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured it at it he said unto them doth this offend you we're going to drop down to 64 but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him now this moment right here was shortly after Jesus had just fed 5,000 people he' crossed over the sea and he's talking primarily to his original 12 disciples and the 70 disciples that he ordained to go out and preach the gospel brother brandham said it was in this moment right here that all 70 of those men walked away right here yes Jesus Christ has just said you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood and he gave absolutely no explanation for this whatsoever right what would you have done 70 men that were ordained by Jesus Christ himself they were taught by Jesus Christ they walked with Jesus Christ just turned and walked away but I thought Mark just a few minutes ago we said it's all about coming in contact with Christ that's what we said right all right it's coming in contact with Christ these men had walked with him they' ate with him they knew him yes yes why you think about that I'm going tell you another story so me and my family every year for about I'm going say somewhere somewhere around 15 years when we weren't living right we took a trip just south of here to uh Fort Lauderdale this was one of our favorite vacation spots there a resort there we love the resort we love the layout got a bunch of swimming pools beaches right there perfect we love we found all of our favorite restaurants every single year sometimes twice a year we'd come down here for vacation so I received the Holy Ghost okay we can still go on vacation right it's not wrong to go on vacation tell my wife what we'll do got this good plan we're going to go down there we're going to go to the beach and we're either going to look way down to the left or we're going to look way down to the right and we're going to see where there's no people and that's where we'll go if somebody's walking by we'll just cover up no big deal we can do this so we get there Lord have mercy I have never seen so much seaweed e in all my life it was everywhere like there was no way we were getting in this water you couldn't even hardly get to the water because of the seaweed never seen anything like this so where do we end up at well obviously the pool Satan has a way of setting these up so as we're sitting here at the pool and I'm looking around of course there's no other message people there so we can all imagine how they're dressed I'm looking at myself guess what I'm back in a pair of shorts again my girls and my wife looked a whole lot better but they sure didn't look Holiness and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking about this and something starts talking to me this isn't right this isn't right it doesn't matter if there's no members from Brother Jack's church here doesn't matter if there's no other message people here it doesn't matter if none of these people here even know that you're a Christian because they sure couldn't tell we were right then and something starts talking to me this is wrong you shouldn't be doing this son amen now all we were doing was wanting to go to the beach Lord knows I love the beach hopefully that doesn't kick me out brother I'm not a mountain man I don't hunt I like the beach all we were doing was going to the beach that was it we didn't even bring our vacation clothes about it that's a big one guys all right talk about cuz I tell you years past even going to church we' have went there those clothes that we' had in our luggage would have looked a whole lot different than those clothes we' have been wearing at home right those are our vacation clothes all right but something was telling me this is wrong you shouldn't be doing this son and as I looked around the thing that probably got me the most was not only the fact there was a voice inside of me saying don't do this but I'm looking at three ladies that are looking at me to be the example Brothers they're looking at you that's right to be the example that's right that's right and that moment it was killing me and I was literally thinking Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord Satan not again this will be the last time right here and that was the last time we sat at a swimming pool because something inside here was telling me this isn't wrong I didn't need brother Jack to tell me this wasn't wrong I didn't need Nathan Bryant to tell me I didn't need brother brandom to tell me there was something inside there saying son this isn't right my God praise God we just talked about about four stories out of the Bible and I thought that brother Mark had just said that this was all about coming in contact with Jesus Christ and again I'm just picking on brother Mark here right now I know some of you guys might be sitting there thinking well you know the children of Israel they didn't actually come in contact with Christ but the prophet of God said he came as a pillar of fire to the children of Israel yes that same Pillar of Fire was manifested in the body of Jesus Christ and then it went back to the pillar of fire and that's who Paul met on the road to Damascus in fact the light even said I am Jesus they met the same person right that the woman at the well met the 70 that walked away met right yes they met the same one that's right the woman at the well same person right right amen amen what happened I'm getting ready to make a statement here it's got to be more than just coming in contact with Jesus Christ there's got to be more to it than just that every one of us know right now he promised he's here right now he is in this room with us right two or three gathered I will be there that's his promise he's here right now it's got to be more than just coming in contact with him 63 a prisoner Prophet says what a thing it must have been for Paul see all that he had been trained to do was vice versa so now with all the education he had it would become not to him now he knew that that he had an experience he knew I'm going to read that again now he knew he had an experience so here's another good lesson for us the experience alone isn't enough explanation point experience alone it's got to be an experience according to the word of the Lord according to the word of the Lord amen what's an experience according to the word of the Lord well let's think about this for a minute when the spirit falls falls on the just and it falls on the unjust when the when the when the when the rain falls the weeds rise up praise the Lord I needed water the wheat raises up praise the Lord I needed water he's here every service and yet the darkness comprehended it not amen it's got to be more than just coming in contact with him what's the difference between the wheat and the weeds the wheat has something in here that's leading and guiding that something in there will lead you into all truth amen that we will stand up and say give me a slingshot CU I've got this giant out here that's making threats and I'll be back I'm going to go take his head off that's right the wheat has something that the weed can never get that's exactly right brother sorry you Jesus the wheat when it comes to that moment when Caleb says we can take the land the wheat will rise up and say we can take the land when that wheat comes into a a trap that Satan has set there's something inside the wheat saying don't do this there's something there that is that something that will hold you right there when the storms come that's the something that will hold you amen we've all heard the prophet say many times there's a man here that can turn on the lights well I can testify to that man is here right now that can turn on the lights there is a moment though he actually does have to turn on the lights yes we've heard the prophet many times say there's a greater than Solomon here I can tell you right now there is a greater than Solomon he's here in this building right now yes sir there's got to be a moment though that you realize there is a greater than Solomon here you got to realize there is a greater than Jonathan howchin here there's a greater than brother Jack Duff here there's a greater than brother brandham here amen and he's here right now amen why am I telling you all these stories about myself why am I pouring my heart out to you guys these are nothing this this this stuff is nothing that I'm proud about I'm sitting here telling you I wanted to gamble I wanted wanted to go to the beach I wanted to take a drink why am I telling you this is I'm trying my best to point out to you what the Holy Ghost looks like he's given me a testimony that's what he's equipped me with to be able to stand here and say I have been on both sides of this brothers and sisters I know what this looks like I've got experience in this yes I know what it was like before doing all these things and not feeling a thing if if I felt anything it was because brother Jack Duff said don't do this right well brother Jack said don't do it maybe I shouldn't do it that's all that was it that was all it was get the Holy Ghost and then all of a sudden it's don't do it and it's coming from more than just brother Jack Duff yes amen that's it we've been coming to church now for six years and in the six years that I've been coming I'm just being blunt I'm seeing people go backwards they're going backwards and they're claiming that they got the H that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will not back up Glory that's not the Holy Ghost that's right amen people get so mad people get so mad when you preach Holiness come on brother they don't want to hear Holiness they don't want to hear how they shouldn't take that little drink that they take from time to time they don't want to hear how they shouldn't wear vacation clothes they don't want to hear this stuff they just want to be content with blind miserable naked and don't know it they've got the Holy Ghost they don't need to hear any law and I will tell you that that has been passed on even to our message preachers that's right they stand in the pool pit and they take this message and they take this Bible and they water it down because people don't want to hear law wow wow if he called you to preach get in the pull pit and preach preach it all and if you can't sit down and play a tape because I heard a prophet all right he got up here he didn't pull any punches he laid down the law he laid down the law to to to to to Pentecostals can you imagine brother douve can you imagine sitting in a church of Baptist women all their hairs cut half of them have pants on makeup glor earrings and you're standing there blasting away at them I'm standing in front of message Believers and I'm not allowed to do it my we're supposed to know this stuff God the problem is is we don't have the Holy Ghost Glory Oh Glory you Jesus where's our Zeal when where's the desperation gone amen used to be back in the day you come to the altar you need the Holy Ghost you come to the altar Lord I'm not leaving here I'll die right here on the altar I'm not leaving now people come for 2 3 minutes reminds me of the story with brother brandom the woman that was seeking the Holy Ghost he said sister I'll pray with you they got down there I think he said for 2 minutes she stood up said I'm good he's like no you're not nothing's happened get back down here that's exactly right she got back down there again I think she stayed a few more minutes I got it no you don't get down here and he's he stayed right there with her until he knew she had it our desperation where's our desperation at the ones that the ones of of us that have the Holy Ghost where's our desperation at praise God where's it gone amen Amen brother we're just saying s you know my my loved ones my brother my sister I don't care I'll stay here with you all night long there's nothing more important than this right here Hall amen glory amen it's got to be a moment there's got to be a moment it can't just be him coming in contact you coming in contact with him like I said he's here right now he's moving up and down the aisles right now Hallelujah we can all Reach Out And Touch there's got to be that moment where you stop him in his tracks that moment when he stops and says who touched me and the disciples say everybody's touching you but I felt virtue go from me somebody reached out and touched him somebody got serious amen somebody said tonight is my night Hallelujah somebody reached out in faith he never said do you feel it he said Do you believe it amen praise God that moment when you stop him thank you Jesus and he turns he says virtue just left me because somebody said tonight Oh Glory I'm not going to be bound by cancer somebody said no more migraines somebody said no more allergies somebody said I need the Holy Ghost and tonight is my night we got to start getting desperate thank you Jesus not just we need the Holy Ghost but my brother or my sister needs the Holy Ghost and I need to pray with them I need to be on my knees even if they don't know I'm on my knees I need to be on my knees for them guys we don't have much time amen it's desperation time now Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus Lord if you're someone sitting here tonight I don't care what the need is but especially if you're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm begging you don't leave here without it if there's a sickness whatever it may be I don't care if it's cancer I don't care what it is you can leave here tonight without it because he is here right now it's a matter of reaching out and stopping him not just touching him but stopping him Lord than you Jesus let's pray dear heavenly father Lord I just want to thank you once again for this opportunity Lord Lord to stand here in front of your your children father what a privilege it is Lord Lord Jesus I just pray that the words that were spoken Lord that they they landed infertile ground father God lord maybe maybe the ones here Lord maybe it's somebody online father I feel like that this moment right here Lord Lord I don't believe I just came by by chance father I believe you sent me here I believe that with all my heart Lord I believe that this was for someone yes Lord Lord I just pray father that they would accept it they would hear it that they would feel something in their heart Lord Lord I pray that that whatever it may be if it's if if if somebody's seeking the baptism of the Holy the Holy Ghost father I pray that you make them so miserable father until they cannot get up off of their knees Lord until not not just where they've had an experience with you father but you've come in and you filled their heart with your Holy Spirit father Yes Lord Lord I just pray that each one of us sitting here Lord myself included father fill me with that fire again Lord renew that that that spirit in me Father Lord fill me with your Holy Spirit again Lord Lord set me on fire set this church on fire lord lord that the fire would just spread Lord thank you Father that we would just be as desperate that that we can for the ones that are still out there Lord God lord I just heard your Prophet saying by the foolishness of preaching we save the ones that are savable lord I can't save anybody I can't heal anybody but I know you're standing right here with me and I know all things are possible there's nothing impossible for you Lord I've seen it time and time again in my own life Lord You're our healer our comforter our provider you are my everything thing Lord dear Lord I just pray father that you would just help us Lord Lord just help us to keep moving forward father Lord I pray that you just bless these people here Lord Lord the ones that are streaming father be with them Lord Lord bring in that last one father so we can all go home Lord Lord we just love you and we just thank you with all of our hearts father in Jesus name I pray amen amen hallelujah amen amen we thank the Lord for the word uh tonight and um certainly um I want to just mention if there's anybody that that needed uh prayer um you can certainly come up and we'll have the minister pray with you uh I know God has spoke here tonight amen and and if there's anyone dealing with a sickness or anything like that and you just wanted prayer while the anointing was here uh we certainly invite you to to come amen um I just appreciate brother Jonathan he [Applause] um anytime a a minister stands and it's just very transparent with the congregation uh he he certainly puts himself a man at risk but the risk is um um is a lot less than the reward that comes from it because the reward is that people go free uh in their Spirit uh others are delivered amen because of uh what he shares and and just all how he just kind of took us through his life there and just you know I I I I just recall brother Brandon making a statement that the Holy Ghost won't misbehave itself in one person and then behave itself in another person and uh the reason that he felt the conviction is because amen here the the flesh is trying to misbehave but the Holy Ghost said no no no no no that that you can't do that no more you're you're not that guy anymore there's another person taking residence Amen in in this home and um and and and if we have not come to that experience and that's that's what we that's what we're looking for I have seen many people have an intellectual um um they've received the Holy Ghost intellectually let's put it that way they they received it intellectually we know how to act when we around the Saints we know how to we we got this we got this thing just just just perfectly down but God is not looking at what you do here it's what you do when you get out of there when you get to San Antonio sir when you get to Las Vegas hello somebody am man when you are on the other side of the world and ain't nobody there how how you living then praise God God God God you you I mean they say you got to you got to carry the Holy Ghost to kalamazo amen it'll live right in kalamazo it'll live right in the jungles of South uh South America the Holy Ghost can keep you wherever you are right and uh and this is this is the genuine holy ghost that we're looking for and I I just love the way he you know he brought that out cuz we would think that all he had to do is come in contact with Christ well the 70 came in contact with Christ but what did they have nothing is going to take a real experience with God Amen not just knowing about him you got to know him brother brandom told us so brother Jonathan God bless you amen thank you um you know how we say it like down here you're going to help somebody and tonight you did help somebody you helped many of somebody's and and we're very very grateful amen for um uh your sermon uh let me just get the announcements amen uh tonight and um also uh just just give a little
