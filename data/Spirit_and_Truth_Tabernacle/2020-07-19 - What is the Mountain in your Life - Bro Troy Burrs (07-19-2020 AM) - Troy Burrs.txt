mix and rub shoulders with uh with the world we we we have to deal with uh people uh that are possessed with all kind of spirits and we walk through this world and and and and and and and and every day is a fight every day is a battle uh we we we we rebuke spirits all day long to stay right in the channel amen so we give out so much we come to be refilled amen the most i believe in this hour in these trying times and uh uh uh is uh uh to have our minds and our hearts renewed amen every time we come to the house of the lord amen we're looking for a region of rejuvenation amen uh uh uh uh something to give us a little something to to to to fight the battle even harder amen to leave here uh charged up amen to leave here uh encouraged amen that when we leave this place we have something amen that god has given us to continue to fight the battle amen we don't come amen just out of tradition not coming here just out of having something to do or to look good to one another for the people around us but lord we have a need this morning amen so let us bow our hands most gracious heavenly father lord as good as it is to see one another to fellowship with brothers and sisters of

saints of god over there lord god to me you meet them there as well o lord god we ask these blessings in jesus name i pray amen amen we're going to go to the word i won't keep it i mean to keep you standing too long see look they got me all hooked up now i'm not gonna run through the building though i'm gonna try to stay up here this area around up in here amen if we could turn our bibles to philippians amen the second chapter we'll read a few scriptures here this morning amen immediately after that we're gonna go to ephesians the fourth chapter we'll start with philippians the second chapter reading from the third and fifth verse amen amen it reads on this wise let nothing be done strife and vain glory or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man in his on his own things but every man also on the things of others the fifth verse let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus ephesians the fourth chapter begin our reading from the 22nd verse read from the 22nd through the 24th verse amen it reads that ye put off concerning the former conversations the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness that ye put off concerning the former conversations the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful us i might have got that twice amen i'm sorry i double printed here amen and that you put off that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and holiness amen if you go to zechariah zechariah the fourth chapter 6 7 verse and he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel that thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto you this morning i would like to ask a question in this title of this message what is the mountain in your life what is the mountain in your life we see here the ruber bell he said not what uh but who art thou oh great mountain that is before zerubbabel and you may be seated i'm sorry but we see a mountain it it represents a man a resisting power something that is an obstacle that is in your way amen a while back i preached a message uh from journey of the journey from law to grace and our christian walk is a journey we see that the uh israel when they left egypt they they had to embark on a journey to get to the promised land and along the way that came many obstacles in the way amen and we're going to talk on some of those obstacles us we we we have obstacles and mountains in our way of this day and we see here according to uh uh zerubbabel and many say that he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace amen the headstone represents the completion of the building amen while again the mountain symbolizing a resisting power an obstacle that is trying to keep you from uh from doing the will of god amen to keep you from completing what you started amen we see in hebrews the 10th chapter the bible says that a body thou has prepared for me amen and uh uh we see that that that there are many oppositions there's many things a man that uh that uh that that that we're going up against amen most of the time amen we find the opposition is not so much physical during the time of uh uh of the israelites there were physical battles but they are spiritual types those are spiritual battle the bible says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities spiritual wickedness in high places so our our enemy a lot of times amen uh uh is in our own mind amen some prophet brought out that that's the battlefield that is where uh our conflict is a lot of times within our own mind this is why the scripture says that we have to have our minds renewed amen but we we receive that uh uh the headstone coming down is a man to to uh uh not give us to to give do away with our mind amen but the headstone is the mind of christ coming down amen we're we're taking on his mind amen we're taking on his thoughts we're taking on the attributes of men of our god amen so we see here in ephesians 4 that it says we put off the uh cut off concerning the former conversations he said uh the man of the former conversations our manner of life and conduct and behavior see because our conduct and behavior amen is a learned behavior amen uh we may have somebody that we at some time looked up to or or or we have had to look to it and we kind of pattern ourselves after they call them role models and man and we take on their characteristics sometimes uh uh you put a child in front of the television he's gonna take on the characteristics and the habits of what he's watching so through time what happened was we as people and as christians oh amen as we have taken on sometimes bad habits and man we've taken on uh uh all the characteristics and things of of of things that were not what god intended amen so uh it says on here that the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust amen so the way to to put off amen something to how the way a man to get rid of something is to put on something else amen you it light light chases away darkness amen so if there's there's there's there's things about you that that may be a mountain that may be a hindrance amen we have to put on righteousness amen we have to as we receive more of god amen who is light more darkness is chased away in our lives amen this is why amen that we are a christian can't wait for those of the church to be open amen this is why a christian is constantly feeding amen on the things of god because it's a constant battle and you want to amen as i said the last time i preached we're constantly feeding the white dog amen because amen we don't want the devil to get a foothold amen it's not only that we have to conquer amen and and our the souls of our foot straight upon amen but we also have to fight to maintain the ground that we gain amen amen i'd like to read something here talking about those obstacles those things that hinder those things that are in the way it says uh god gave after joshua became leader the new generation of israel entered into the new land of canaan as our lord promised god gave them an important commandment when the lord your god bring you into the land you are to enter in to possess and then drive out before you many nations in that land were the hittites the jed jenga djangocites the amorites the canaanites the persian sites the hivites and the jebusites these were nations that was had already set up camp in the land that the lord had promised them these were opposing forces amen they had to go in and fight and possess amen their promise they had to promise that this was their land it was a good land it was their land amen but they had to fight amen to possess it not only did they have to fight to possess it but they had to drive the enemy out amen how many is driving out the enemy in their land your 16 elements is your land it is what god gave you amen and you have to drive out the enemy you have to possess the land amen for the glory of god amen we see we're going to look at these different the character riches are some of these different ones the hittites the name means terror there were giants who brought fear and confusion and discouragement to others are you discouraged this morning do you battle amen discouragement fear amen drive that devil off your land amen the jagger sites the meaning of the word genocide is one who returns back from a pr a pilgrimage therefore they are people that go back and are earthly they build their houses using clay which shows they are not stable in their mindset so we see that this group of people here amen uh uh uh they're the ones that uh uh encourage you to to go back they don't build their houses amen on a rock they are uh double-minded amen they are unsure of themselves uh i believe there are people who are hauled between opinions and then they are tossed about with every sound and wind and doctrine they're unstable people drive them off your land amen we look at the amorites amen they uh were people who are arrogant boastful in their speech who were always challenging amen always arguing looking for something to argue about amen they have high self-esteem and this pride led to finding fault in others amen is this a giant in your land amen the giants of those amorites do you find yourself always arguing about something do you find yourself always uh with an arrogant nature we read the scripture there in the uh uh uh philippi prefer your brother i'm reminded of christ when he went before pilate and the court amen they they accused him of all kind of things amen and they they they say well what do you have to say for yourself he said not a mumbling word i didn't come here to argue with you i didn't come here i know who i am and i know where i stand right right amen is that giant on your land drive that boastful arrogant argumentative giant off your land full of pride drive that giant off your land we look at the canaanites amen word canaanite means merchant who humiliate they were financial giants amen the canaanites were motivated by greed and lust of accumulation of earthly and material wealth amen do you uh look will take not any kind of way you can get it amen do you stay home go to work choose to go the prophet said if the ox is in the ditch and you have to get them out of the ditch then get them out of the ditch but you don't plan for the october in the ditch on sunday to miss church amen hey amen is that greed amen that lust for money that lust for earthly treasures amen you drive that giant off your land amen possess it amen we look at the present sites amen they were people who had separated themselves and lived in unprotected unwalled villages they had no discipline and restrictions they do anything they live within the comforts of their own mind they refuse to come to church for fellowship they feel like they can be on the island by themselves amen there's a spirit amen of the judging sites on them that separates them from what from their brothers and sisters feel like well i don't need those people i can stay home read the books and the quotes what kind of spirit is that you drive that giant off your lane this is a opposing force that is keeping you from gaining and possessing all of the promises that god gave you this demon this devil is on your land amen keeping you from the full promises of god you drive that devil off your land amen we look at the heavyweights they claim to offer a good lifestyle my god living by phrases such as if it feels good do it oh my don't worry what about about what other people think look out for number one amen if you have that spirit on you that you're only concerned about yourself the bible says mark those that sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city amen if you have no concern amen for your neighbor no concern amen for the people in your no concern for your brothers and sisters you are all about number one amen drive that devil off of your land that is a giant that is keeping you from your promises amen he said they claim to have a good lifestyle amen do what makes you feel good man if you have these things you drive those philistines you drive those heathens off your land and possess your land the message here preached in 1961 amen oh one seventeen amen i apologize uh i think it's going to be around paragraph 30 paragraph 30. you can find it there amen the prophet was saying now you don't have to die to this not naturally he's saying you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die the inside is where god gets in to control you he presses himself forward into you don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strife that'll run him right back again you drive those things off your it is hindering god it says he will he will leave because he can't dwell amen amongst those kind of spirits you drive those things off of your land amen he said just get all of the meanness and superstitions and all unbelief out of you now i would like to pause right there before i finish that quote and i would like to look at thessalonians amen the fifth chapter thessalonians the fifth chapter in the 23rd verse says and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the lord now we go back to this quote i want you to pay attention to what the prophet said here we are a triune being we are a body that is contacted by our five sentences of see taste hear smell touch amen but we have a spirit that is also contacted by imagination affection and and and i haven't written down i can't remember all the top of my head but you know what i'm talking about but you have a third room amen that is only has faith or doubt belief or doubt that is the three realms of a man so the prophet here uh is saying that you want to run him right back just get all the meanness which is on the physical realm superstitions which is on the spirit spirit realm and unbelief which is in the soul see because that devil can possess any one of those areas he can possess you physically he can possess you spiritually or he can possess your soul i'ma try i read it to you a bit but the prophet said that you can be totally insane and still have the baptism by the holy ghost i'm gonna read it to you totally insane bear with me i'll get to it let me continue reading this quote amen from the message messiah amen he says here get that unbelief out of you the meanness the superstition and the unbelief and every time you move out a little unbelief god steps right back in amen every time you move out a little he comes right on back so what happens each time you move out one of those giants off your land you get more god you get more of him amen oh my god thank you lord jesus he says everywhere the souls of your foot is set that i give to you and he said here tonight but i say this morning as we enter into the kingdom god's kingdom taking out all the philistines unbelievers and all the amorites and all the amalekites and whatever more throw it out of us like that we take possession amen like that say days of miracles has passed you am i right get out of me i've put footprints here amen i've taken over amen there's they say there's no such thing and seeing visions you say get out of there you amalekite i've come over there you are you possess and you're possessing out from that little button it's taking over the fibers of you spreading out god working through you and in you and around you you by your confession amen you chasing those devils out amen now remember i said it's a battle of the mind amen it's a mad battle the devil is going to tell you all you are right amen you you pretty good fella but if those deaths that those devils trying amen to weasel they way back on your land if you recognize amen that giant amen that opposing force that mountain on your land you say to this mountain be thou remove and cast it into the sea it's a confession amen kick that devil off your land amen amen let me go on says here amen that you be renewed in your mind put off the former conversations amen to corrupt according to the deceitful lust amen that the way to put off something is to put on to take home more christ amen and run them doubles out the bible says amen in matthew 7 13 enter into ye gates for straight amen enter in enter ye in at the straight gate for why is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction amen and many there be will go and find they're at amen but the fourth verse in the seventh chapter says because straight is the way and narrow straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life so you can't go around that mountain many times we see people trying to find an alternative route they try amen well i don't like i this is this battle is too hard this is a huge obstacle this is a difficult mountain is too high to climb and it's too wide to go around so instead of you possessing the gate instead of you speaking to that mountain that obstacle in your life you say well i'm just going to take the long way around you foolish virgin you won't make it the mountain's too wide and it's too high amen you speak to that mountain amen and possess what's yours that mountain is not a literal mountain it is an opposing force it is an amalekite or a jesuicise that is keeping you amen from the promises that god gave you it is something that is in your way you speak to that devil you claim victory in the name of jesus and possess your language you can't go around it hey man straight is the way narrow is the gate amen that lead it to life there's only one way you can't go round it you can't go over you got to go straight says that in zachariah he promised a man just to rub the bell as our shout become a plane amen and he shall bring forth the headstone what is the headstone the headstone is the bind of christ amen the mind of christ amen through seven church ages amen we're building a body amen through seven church ages god is preparing amen a body amen if we look on the dollar bill and we see that pyramid had no cap on it but if we are living in the time amen with a mind of christ the capstone has come down which is what the mind of christ amen to complete that building amen to give us a man i wouldn't say just the intelligence but to give us those things amen that we were lacking amen to give us the knowledge amen that would give us the ability to know right from wrong people don't know right from wrong why because they have born and sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking life and they have taken on the characteristics of the things around them amen the prophet was bringing out if your grandmother had dressed the way some of the people dressed today they would have locked her up in an insane asylum but because of the culture that are it seems okay we're going to get into something get ahead of myself you love the lord amen the 23rd chapter of ephesians says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind your mind is renewed and healed of false understanding of the word when true revelation and understanding of the word is made clear to you in other words you automatically put off your old thinking amen and replace your thoughts with truth of the word and then that affects your manner of life and conduct see that's what we're talking about amen healing is really just a restoration of what you lost amen god created you whole and a physical healing is just a restoration of where where you were amen now remember we are triune being so the healing can only can take place on the physical realm it can take place on that spiritual realm mentally and on the soul rim says in other words healing brings you back to the original condition of what god intended you to be in body spirit and soul we find out today that there are just as many mental hospitals as there are physical hospitals people are losing their mind i got a good quote for you a little bit later we get to it prophets say they are totally insane why because we got away from god but the headstone has come back amen we know since the fall of man in the garden man has endured sickness in both body mind and soul you can find this in the messages he preached on demonology he breaks it out amen we talk so much about healing of the body we focus our focus so much focus is on placed in that area of the healing of the body amen that was one of the main attractions in his first and second pull and draw big crowds amen for the healing of the body but many came through the line it was a mental healing that they needed it was nervousness it was some kind of mental devil that needed to be healed on that realm it wasn't nothing in the body they thought it was the mental uh uh or thing affected the body amen one place it was fear another it was uh uh or something menopause amen that would cause reaction somebody said you'll be all right you just need that it's fear on you see so they needed uh more than just physical healing however some came through the prayer line and was physically healed but still believed in the trinitarian doctrine they left with a sick soul a sick soul but see the pro the bible says that after that you be well holy in body mind and body spirit and soul amen amen now we see it attracted big crowds but when we get to the third pool we find that our focus is not on the healing of the body so much as it's on the healing of the way we think in regards to the revelation of the word we know that the pyramid was god's second bible the stars was his first bible amen his second bible was the pyramids and that the rejected capstone of that pyramid represented the mind of christ coming down connecting with the rest of the pyramid amen so which is speaking of this age when the body of christ amen down through seven church ages is to unite with the mind of christ the headstone of the word to complete the entire body amen of the second eve and this is our part in this age we are the part of the body that connects to the great capstone and headship of the word amen we we we've already come through amen the time of the the defeat amen and the the going up to chris but now we are right here we are the we right here this age lady yoseah this age this time we are with the headstone is to come back and fitly join so we have to be honed to perfection amen the mind of christ will fitly join nobody they without us cannot be made perfect what a time to be living in what are people to be amen so we see in genesis before i go on i'd like to the prophet said the angel 48 0304 the angel of god amen the prophet preached he said trying to decide how far to go back here here a few weeks ago a woman came into the line who was somewhat uh he said the newspaper gave us an awful write-up about the ambulances blocking the streetcar and tracks and things and the lady the lady uh i went to touch her hand before i could touch her hand she said i have cancer she had around oh about 10 or 12 cancers and they were hitting from all different parts and my hands swole quickly the vibrations running over it and she said can anything be done for me i said if you can believe but if i should rebuke it and send it away and if you doubt it it'll return back and if you do not serve christ then it'll return back i said i perceive that you're not a christian she said no i'm not then when she looked at me in the eye might as well tell you this because many of the people already know it when sometimes when i can catch their eyes that's how i get them into that channel you see and then it's not a mind reading it's not psychology if it is then paul used it when he looked upon a man and said i perceive you have faith to be healed i will grant you this it is psychology in this way if the word psych of course means mind and it's the mind of christ that the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of christ hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in the channel of christ we unworthy mortals having brought into the sons and daughters of god to be fellow citizens oh how man i get shouting uh i get to shouting when i get as mortal beings think about it you have the privilege the privilege to enter in to the mind of christ what a honor that he is amen we're going to go on now we see in genesis the second chapter the 21st and the 23rd verse says the lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh uh and the real which the lord had taken from man he made woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man i want you to notice that when god does something the first time it's perfect amen the way he did it the first time is the way amen was the perfect way amen he didn't have to go and prove improve on on his way amen it's always perfect the woman was meant to come out of the man but since sin has entered in to the earth we see that man has always come out of a woman contrary to god's original plan the bride is not supposed to come out of a woman which is the church but out of the man which is christ jesus amen the word of for each age that's where the bride come out of each age produces a bride a woman for that age and that woman bride came out of the word the man for that age so we see the first adam was put to sleep and his side was open and god formed eve from a part of adam and he presented to and he presented to her her to adam god was showing a prefigure how would put the second adam christ to sleep at calvary and open his side and for 2 000 years of seven church ages produce a second eve amen out of the of the word of god not out of the church but out of christ the man amen that is why we are part of him in bride for we are an extension of him amen we are born of his bone and flesh of his flesh so the story in the bible goes on in genesis that a woman in the eden and the story christ and his bride let me go back in and mention something we see in the beginning that it was adam and his bride eve in the beginning and it's going to wind up to christ and his bride in the millennium amen restoration amen the entire plan of redemption is to restore back what was lost the perfect condition again amen so if we look at this after eve was formed then she was taken to adam she came into his presence for the first time adam oh my i'm not so lonely anymore so by this time adam was awake and when she was first presented to adam she didn't know who he was she didn't know who she was she didn't know where they come from she didn't know where they was going but adam was in the image of god and before eve ever came he sat and spoke with god they had conversation in the evening so adam knew the will of god amen he had that knowledge he named all of the plants and the animals he had the mind of god but eve she didn't know nothing but she came into the presence of adam her husband by adam he knew all of those things in his great wisdom god had given him he began to reveal to eve who he was he began to reveal to eve who she was he began to reveal to eve where she had come from oh man you came from the real just under my heart you are part of me in me you dwelt in me you was taken out of me and formed to be my helpmate oh man she didn't know any of this but she came into the presence of adam and adam having the mind of god begin to reveal to her the secrets of his heart so that she can have an understanding of who she was who he was where they were going and where they come from she had to receive his mind in her by the word that she was receiving from him you see where i'm going in this day amen the mind of christ come down so this is what is going on right now because we have come into this same place again the second adam and the second eve because the bride of seven church ages is nearing completion she is coming to the headstone which is the word the mind of christ and so here we are and now at the stage where the mind of christ is being revealed to us by the word of the hour that is coming into us and revealing who we are where we come from where we are now and where we're going amen the mind of christ has come down to reveal to us who we are the power that lies within us amen to remove the philistines and those matters that that because of who we are no doubt adam said eve if you get a little cold just let me know i'll command the wind to blow a different direction if there's something i could tell that tree to get up and move out of your way we are all power there was no sin amen the second eve because we've taken on the mind of christ amen we know who we are we know where we come from amen amen you have the power you have the authority to speak to the mountain in your life because you know who you are amen the paradox of this age amen i'm sorry we look at this so insanity is a sickness of the mind but insanity in a person is not what you would always think a person can be an alcoholic but they call what we know of today as a functional alcoholic uh a person can be totally insane mentally totally insane amen but functional ted bundy was a smart individual he was able to blend on college campuses seems to be a well raised uh clean-cut and uh uh uh intelligent nice young man but he was totally insane totally insane we see hitler was a very prestigious man intelligent a man uh seemed to be a pillar of the community but was totally insane mind gone amen so we see that a person that we think about sometimes that's insane there's not always a person foaming at the mouth and talking to the trees and just you know nothing crazy what we think is normal god look at him say are you what's wrong with you you don't you're not going to church you you choose you insane now let's go on but the paradox at this age is this totally insane person can appear extremely normal and intelligent according to culture and lifestyle of today but yet be totally insane now here's that quote that i was referring to earlier now he said here in uh demonology physical realm uh paragraph 17. now there is demons that come into the soul of men and that is the phraseology that would be that would be in the uh i'd say this through the demon that comes into the soul is something that torments the soul how many know the word devil means tormentor many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be yet a converted person filled with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane 1953-0608 paragraph 17. that's what the prophet said and yet be totally insane that's right that has nothing to do with the soul it's a tormentor something that torments them amen there's so many things that bring hurt to the mind amen so many things the spirits of this age how many know that you go to the grocery store and everything is concentrated you buy your dish detergent well you know my wife get on me i'm using it like it ain't concentrated she said no that's concentrated all you need is a couple drops it's concentrated everything is concentrated you know why because all of the demons down through time is concentrated in this day it's all concentrated so it ain't just one devil it's it's we got concentrated devils this is why we need our minds and hearts renewed regularly because we're living in a concentrated evil there's no way to get from from around it we're being tormented we're constantly bombarded with demonic thoughts and demonic amen uh uh uh pressure constantly what is causing the mental problems of this age is that we are almost as many faculties requiring the healing of the mind as the healing of the body you see mental in hospitals are not anew and everyone has all these different ones amen that's popping up all over the place the bible says revelation the third chapter 17 verse because thou says i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing no it's not that they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked because they are functional because they go to work every day and collect a good paycheck because they drive a nice car because they are uh astute members of the bridge club because they are stupid members of the church they have need of nothing but totally insane blind naked wretched miserable but don't know it going on in life thinking that they're all right but they are totally insane why because they are in their own the mind of that old man when the mind of christ in this age and this hour has come back let me tell you something unless you've got the mind of christ you ain't got no mind that old mind is going to lead you astray you must in this hour take on the mind of christ amen that is the only way that you're going to be restored back to the original let's take on his mind eve had to take on and she had to receive from the mind of adam and we have to receive our our everything who we are where are we going from the mind of christ in this hour because the thoughts of god is so different than the thoughts of this world amen that's how we end up getting caught up amen into these these different things god ain't concerned with this the stuff that's going on around here today the mind of christ the capstone has come back amen to unite with the body amen let's go on bear with me we look here then a certain in acts the 19th chapter 13 first then a certain of the vagabond jews the exorcists took upon them to call over which them which had evil spirits in the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus who paul preached and there the seven sons of skeva a jew a chief of the priest which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know paul i know but who are ye and the man in whom the evil spirit leaked on him and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded nakedness is a result of an evil attack of the devil i'ma say it again nakedness is a result of an evil attack of the devil when you see i i almost said young girls but you see now young or it don't matter you think you're you are naked out there in the streets with your underneath garments on see we have to look through the mind of god you're looking through the eyes of some fashion devil you're looking through the eyes of some lustful designer and then the preacher tell you oh it's all right why cause he want to look at you oh it's all right if you wear that oh it's all right if you you put on you your shots and and come out with your tight soul and you it is and you nakedness is an attack from a devil and that devil has attacked your mind and you have gone insane that you would walk out the house with them kind of clothes on amen but you don't know it you think you are right why because broad is the way that leadeth to destruction you think you're all right everybody else doing it but straight is the gate and narrow is the way to eternal life and phil shall find it you have lost your everlasting mind and you need healing healing of the mind chase that devil off your mountain it is a mountain it is an obstacle that is keeping you from your destination which is life eternal life god's life it's an obstacle in the way it's one of those those spiritual forces that are keeping you from the land of promise that devil is tormenting your mind and you've gone insane but don't know it we see luke 8 chapter 6 27th verse and they arrived at a country in gardenias which is over in gala against galilee and when he had went forth to land a foot forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils a long time and where no clothes now you see the the the the the the similarities this man was possessed with devils and he had no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs lived in the graveyard this man had been attacked by the devil in his mind as a result of the attack he was naked then they went out to the sea the 35th verse when they went out to the sea what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his in his right mind what is your right mind the capstone cause this old man mind is gone it is no good get rid of this mind and take on the capstone which is the mind of christ amen if we are trying to manage by the that this mind our own thinking amen take on how do you take on the mind of christ amen you have to if eve took on the mind of adam by setting and receiving the words from adam and didn't doubt in her heart that what he was telling her was nothing but the truth as you hear the word of god faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god what are you doing you're taking on the mind of christ amen and as you take on the mind of christ you chase those devils off your land you remove that force that that's that mountain that's in your way of getting to the promised land from that's keeping you from possessing everything that god gave you take on the mind of christ we see amnesia is a result of the effects of memory loss we find there are many different levels of amnesia amen we see amnesia affects the mind amen in many different ways in the message spiritual amnesia brother branham is referring to this problem at a level where like men are shell-shocked amen and they've forgotten who they were he's been so shocked by the horrors of war i want you to listen to me closely by the horrors of war in the heat of the battle bombs landing around them that it affects his mind he can no longer identify himself he forgets who he is and he doesn't know where he's going and that's a condition of many people spiritually in this age and so they need a healing in their mind many times in this christian journey we go through battles many times in this christian journey we go through uh um we go through really difficult battles within us maybe within our homes maybe within our church oh my i can remind that that that that in my christian journey oh my god i wish that i don't wish this battle on nobody and we come out of the situation wounded wounded warriors amen they have a fun to the wounded warriors well what about the wounded christian warriors amen you know there's wounded christian warriors amen that have been hurt in the battle amen have had their spirits wounded in this fight and in this situation amen they have turned away they've gotten spiritual amnesia they once knew who they were they once fought side by side with you but now that there's a condition of the mind called amnesia they don't know who they are anymore they're lost i think one of those devils they talked about how they going back to the things that they used to do they began to be tormented by the devil first thing a person that is tormented they lose their identity they forget who they are by spiritual amnesia the first thing they do is go and cut their hair began to put on worldly clothes began to take off clothes they tormented by a devil tormented by a devil in their mind they need a healing not so much in the body but a healing in their minds they need something to happen to jar them can remember my own testimony the prophet talks about sometimes all it takes is getting them back into the a familiar atmosphere i was lost spiritual amnesia couldn't find my way back didn't know how to get back ran a long time but the minute i got back in familiar atmosphere my mind came back oh hallelujah and i'm just thankful for it i began to remember the things of that i always knew amen but it took more than just that i had to chase those philistines off my land i had to fall down on my knees and repent amen i began to chase those devils of my land to remove the mountain the obstacle that was in my way and it's still a battle every day amen we go through one mountain in there just to find out there's another one we chase out one mountain just to find out there's another we get around that mountain and that is another one the prophet said you're going to fight till you get out of here you're going to fight till you get out of here chase that devil off your mountain we see here amen those aruba bell zechariah the fourth chapter the first verse the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what sees thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and the seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof i met zachariah the fourth chapter amen first through the seventh verse amen he said and the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and spake unto the angel that uh the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no it's not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto the ruberbear saying not by my nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain of zerubbabel that shout that thou shalt become plain and he shall bring forth the headstone the mind of christ with shouting crying grace grace unto thee amen the bible says musicians as you come amen that in isaiah the fourth the 40th chapter the third verse amen speaking of john the baptist the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord and make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough plain places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed in us and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken amen every mountain he's promised amen to be made plain every crooked will be made straight the valleys will be exalted amen if you just hold to the promises of god amen speak to that mountain that is within your life speak to that thing that seems to amen uh that blockade that seems to keep you from your promises you may a man have uh different situations i don't know what the situation may be it may be a situation in your home it may be a situation on your job amen but i say to you this morning seek ye first the kingdom of god amen you have to first possess the your land amen your whole body your soul mind and spirit but it's not you it's not by might it's not my power but it's by my spirit saith the lord how do you chase out how do you get rid of by taking on more of him as you speak his word as you as as you as you possess confess his word hold to his word as you take amen those things within your own mind amen confess it drive that devil out you take on more of him and keep fighting keep pressing on and keep pressing the battle god bless you saints lord had a blessing to his word amen amen take back your
