[24:53] see so satan just do everything he can
[24:55] to try to stop it but you know even with
[24:57] a sneak peek he can't stop it
[25:00] because what god got for you is for you
[25:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[25:06] amen he can fight but he won't win amen
[25:10] we thank god for victory

[38:38] was um we kind of had a little
[38:42] glitch there with the internet and all
[38:44] kind of things
[38:46] when we had a little power outage so uh
[38:48] i didn't get the
[38:49] update that i'm supposed to get here on
[38:51] my uh
[38:52] on my ipad uh so the lord knows all
[38:55] things
[38:57] but we're gonna preach by faith anyway
[38:59] amen
[39:00] and i mean i got some notes but not all
[39:02] the notes that i was supposed to have so
[39:04] god knows god knows all things
[39:07] amen so um i
[39:11] want to use a scripture today amen from
[39:14] matthew 17 now
[39:15] uh also just so that you all are aware
[39:18] i am um going
[39:22] off the path today and man you all know
[39:26] we've been
[39:26] in a journey uh and catch the vision
[39:29] and um you know stepping into that
[39:31] vision but
[39:32] i just felt led in my spirit to kind of
[39:35] go off the path
[39:36] today brother branham say sometime as
[39:38] you're driving down the road
[39:39] you have to go off the path to pick up
[39:41] some folk
[39:42] and then you get back on the path and
[39:44] keep going so
[39:45] amen i believe for today we'll just step
[39:47] off the path
[39:48] just a little bit and uh and maybe next
[39:51] week we may step off the path again for
[39:53] a little bit
[39:54] and but we're going to come back and
[39:55] finish amen our journey
[39:57] and uh catch the vision and step into it
[39:59] i think that was
[40:00] that's our inspiration for 2020
[40:03] amen we're stepping into a vision glory
[40:07] to god and i'm going to it don't
[40:08] when it's a vision uh brother branham
[40:11] say that's that's
[40:12] that's pretty like perfect and complete
[40:14] when god give give the vision you're
[40:16] going
[40:16] you come into it no matter what is in
[40:18] your way you are coming into that vision
[40:21] i'm gonna just put it this way nothing
[40:23] can stop a vision
[40:26] nothing nothing can stop a vision right
[40:29] so once god gives you that we're coming
[40:31] to it so he gave the prophet
[40:33] a man a visitation by the angel lord and
[40:36] said pick up your pen and write this
[40:38] is for the bride for the church so i
[40:41] believe we
[40:42] as a people are coming into that place
[40:45] amen we're moving into it
[40:47] uh even as we're sitting here we're
[40:49] moving into this place that god had for
[40:51] us
[40:51] amen so uh this this morning i want to
[40:54] read from
[40:55] matthew 17 uh we'll start at verse 14
[40:58] if you would just stand with me amen as
[41:00] we uh read the word of the lord
[41:10] praise the lord um the bible declares
[41:15] and when they were come to the multitude
[41:18] that came to him a certain man kneeling
[41:21] down to him and saying
[41:23] um lord have mercy
[41:26] on my son for he is
[41:30] lunatic and so vexed for all times he
[41:34] followeth into the fire and off
[41:36] into the water and i brought him to thy
[41:39] disciples and they could not
[41:41] cure him that's that's that's not a good
[41:44] testimony
[41:45] that they it was brought to some people
[41:47] they had confidence in but these folk
[41:49] couldn't do nothing for
[41:50] right they could not cure him then jesus
[41:54] answered and said o faithless
[41:57] and perverse generation how long shall i
[42:01] be
[42:01] with you what statements how long shall
[42:05] i be with you
[42:06] how long shall i suffer you
[42:10] bring him hither to me amen
[42:13] and jesus rebuked the devil and he
[42:16] departed out of him and the child was
[42:18] cured from that very hour then came the
[42:21] disciples to jesus department said
[42:23] why could not we cast them out and jesus
[42:27] said unto them
[42:28] because of your unbelief for verily i
[42:31] say unto you if you have
[42:32] faith as a grain of a mustard seed
[42:36] ye shall ye uh shall say unto this
[42:39] mountain
[42:40] remove hints to yonder place and it
[42:42] shall remove and
[42:44] nothing shall be impossible
[42:47] unto you how be it this kind
[42:51] goeth not out but by prayer and
[42:54] fasting amen the lord had a blessing to
[42:57] the reading of his word shall we pray
[42:59] over the word of god father we are
[43:01] thankful
[43:02] uh for the ability to read scripture
[43:06] but we know the holy spirit that had the
[43:09] scripture
[43:09] to be uh written the same holy spirit
[43:12] that must come and quicken it

[47:27] church up in the faith for this hour
[47:30] all right i'm going to this message
[47:32] ashamed

[47:47] update god
[47:48] just help me jesus

[47:54] all right he says this in the message of
[47:56] shame he says so his word
[47:58] has to live out for every generation
[48:02] now i i i want to uh uh uh
[48:05] just look at that amen it says it lived
[48:08] itself in the days of moses
[48:10] because in that day the bible said in
[48:12] hebrews the first chapter god and
[48:13] sundered times and died was manner spake
[48:15] to the fathers
[48:16] by the prophets now now brother branham
[48:19] is taking it back
[48:20] and he's saying the word has to live out
[48:22] in every generation
[48:24] the word has to live out you know uh
[48:26] there was a statement a quote that he
[48:28] says
[48:28] he says um uh uh here come that mandela
[48:32] so god gotta he'll put a a
[48:34] scripture there like he put the
[48:35] scripture for moses that you know a
[48:37] deliverer would come
[48:38] amen after 400 years and bring the
[48:40] people out of bondage
[48:42] so it said here come that man alone to
[48:44] fulfill that moses
[48:46] was that man to fulfill that we can look
[48:48] in scripture and see that god promised
[48:51] amen before the great and terrible day
[48:52] of the lord that he would send elijah
[48:55] the prophet
[48:55] here come brother branham along and
[48:57] fulfills that
[48:59] glory to god we can see amen in
[49:01] scripture where john the baptist was
[49:03] promised to come
[49:04] and here come john the baptist alone to
[49:06] fulfill that
[49:07] but he didn't stop with that statement
[49:09] he says also here come them people
[49:11] alone to live that
[49:14] glory to god amen in order for amen in
[49:18] order for god to sin of moses he had to
[49:20] have somebody
[49:21] on the earth that would believe moses in
[49:24] order for god to sin
[49:25] amen john the baptist he had to have
[49:28] some group of people on the earth that
[49:30] would believe john the baptist
[49:32] in order for god to fulfill malachi
[49:35] 4 revelation 10 god had to have a group
[49:40] of people on the earth
[49:41] that would believe that scripture here
[49:44] come them
[49:44] people alone to live it yes
[49:47] [Music]
[49:48] brother i'm here to live it amen god
[49:52] always amen his word has to live out
[49:54] live itself out for every generation
[49:57] it lived itself in the days of moses
[49:59] because in that day the bible said in
[50:01] hebrews first chapter god and sundered
[50:03] times and doubles manners
[50:05] spake to the fathers by the prophets
[50:07] adam did everything
[50:09] uh i so i just have to watch the time i
[50:12] left my time in the office everything
[50:16] all right y'all just bear with me i'm
[50:18] gonna stay on that time all right
[50:20] uh uh he says um it says uh and those
[50:23] prophets the church got all
[50:27] so twisted up that those prophets those
[50:30] daring messengers of god
[50:31] come without church without denomination
[50:35] without organization without anything
[50:39] defined kings amen kingdoms
[50:43] churches and everything when the priest
[50:45] was brought before
[50:46] they was brought before the priests they
[50:48] wasn't ashamed because they had directly
[50:51] thus saith the lord amen amen he says if
[50:54] you notice
[50:55] the the prophet in one sense of the word
[50:58] in the old testament
[50:59] when he said thus says the lord now
[51:01] watch him
[51:02] he goes right into the phrase oh this is
[51:06] the thing that really struck me he goes
[51:07] right into the phrase
[51:09] of taking the place of god
[51:14] now that's a prophet when a prophet is
[51:17] saying thus says the lord
[51:19] he's going right into the place of
[51:22] taking the place of god
[51:25] hallelujah you notice when he placed out
[51:28] before him
[51:29] thus saith the lord he fell right into
[51:34] god
[51:36] when a prophet not steps out and says
[51:38] that saith the lord that prophet has
[51:40] fallen right into god
[51:42] i want you to stay with me here church
[51:44] glory to god he says
[51:45] and he acted as god then he gave his
[51:49] message
[51:50] which god which was god speaking through
[51:52] him
[51:53] thus saith the lord now see now you know
[51:56] and and
[51:57] and i'm i'm not gonna leave it at a
[51:59] prophet now y'all know me
[52:00] amen i'm gonna give you some other
[52:02] things to help us see amen
[52:04] the faith but inside was not just the
[52:05] prophet but it's also in the bride
[52:08] right amen but but understanding that
[52:10] the same
[52:11] god that was in a prophet that when a
[52:14] prophet is standing out there saying
[52:15] thus saith the lord
[52:16] he has stepped into the place of god
[52:19] amen
[52:20] he's acting on god's behalf hallelujah
[52:24] amen god is pretty much saying whatever
[52:26] that man say is gonna be
[52:28] just like he said oh hallelujah
[52:32] church amen i i i like this i like this
[52:35] so
[52:35] amen let's let's try to build a church
[52:37] up in the faith for this hour
[52:39] now um i want to go with it with another
[52:41] quote
[52:42] out of spiritual food and due season
[52:45] amen and maybe
[52:46] maybe uh we'll catch something over here
[52:49] in scripture
[52:51] amen let me just uh line something up
[52:54] glory to god glory to god
[52:56] amen over here in first kings hallelujah
[53:01] glory glory amen
[53:05] um
[53:09] all right uh let's line up something
[53:12] here in first king 17. let's just
[53:14] let's just read this now uh so this this
[53:16] statement that brother branham was
[53:18] making that a prophet when he stand out
[53:19] there with us saith the lord
[53:21] he's taken the place of god now i want
[53:23] to just show you here in scripture
[53:25] first kings 17 where this actually took
[53:27] place
[53:29] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[53:33] amen uh this uh
[53:36] is a prediction or a prophecy of a
[53:38] drought oh my my my my my glory
[53:42] it says in elijah the tishbite
[53:46] who was of the inhabitants of gilead
[53:49] said unto ahab as the lord
[53:53] god of israel liveth before whom i
[53:57] stand there shall not be
[54:00] do nor rain the these years
[54:04] but according to
[54:10] according to my word now can you see
[54:13] this
[54:13] man that's why brother branham said they
[54:15] were bold when they stood before
[54:17] kings and and whoever whatever
[54:19] government that they had to step
[54:20] they were born when they stood there say
[54:22] look it's not gonna
[54:24] even rain until i call for it
[54:28] right not not pretty much what he's
[54:29] saying y'all ain't no sense of y'all
[54:31] praying for rain
[54:33] ain't no sense of y'all fasting for rain
[54:36] it will
[54:36] not ring jesus
[54:40] until i speak it now
[54:43] god himself is the one that controls the
[54:46] ring
[54:47] so where was god dwelling inside this
[54:50] prophet the prophet had become one with
[54:53] the word
[54:55] and i'm telling you the bride has become
[54:57] one
[54:58] with the word amen
[55:01] oh jesus we built up for the faith for
[55:04] this hour amen
[55:06] amen now you know we we know uh as we we
[55:09] read the story they went through this
[55:11] great famine and
[55:12] three three years three and a half years
[55:13] they went through this famine and and
[55:15] then he had this mighty showdown on
[55:17] mount carmel
[55:18] and uh and after the mighty showdown uh
[55:21] then
[55:21] then god sent the rain after three and a
[55:23] half years it didn't come
[55:24] until elijah prayed for it till elijah
[55:27] asked for it right
[55:28] i mean it's just uh and brother branham
[55:30] said he was typing in spiritual food and
[55:32] do season he's typing elijah
[55:34] amen to us today he said i want to use
[55:36] this as a type for the church today
[55:38] so we got to find ourselves in scripture
[55:41] now let's
[55:41] pick up another quote here spiritual
[55:43] food and due season amen
[55:45] here in uh paragraph 60 we'll hear this
[55:48] time
[55:48] oh yes lord glory glory glory glory
[55:54] amen so it says uh now we see that
[55:57] modern trend of the people
[56:00] uh then all the days have passed there's
[56:03] no such thing
[56:04] as miracles the people are all
[56:06] emotionally worked up
[56:08] listen to that elijah the prophet cry
[56:10] out against them
[56:11] and their theologians notice he spoke as
[56:14] if he was god himself
[56:17] amen he says elijah spoke as if
[56:20] he was god himself now i just like even
[56:24] the angle
[56:24] that brother branham puts on that
[56:26] scripture i mean there's
[56:28] people reading this scripture today
[56:30] preaching from it
[56:31] amen but maybe not catching that angle
[56:33] brother branham say elijah spoke
[56:36] as if he was god himself
[56:40] oh glory hallelujah he says uh uh
[56:44] the dew will not fall from heaven until
[56:46] i
[56:47] called for it amen yes sir the prophet
[56:49] had been so
[56:50] long in the presence of god
[56:53] amen the prophets of the old testament
[56:56] or any time
[56:57] when they live in the presence of god
[57:00] until
[57:00] they become the word
[57:04] hallelujah i'm telling it's not just for
[57:06] prophets we have become
[57:08] the word hallelujah amen their message
[57:12] is the word itself
[57:13] and remember he said thus saith the lord
[57:16] and when those men had those messages
[57:18] from god
[57:19] they become so wrapped up amen that
[57:22] their own
[57:23] thinking it might have been against
[57:24] their thinking they might not have been
[57:27] able to see it right but they will speak
[57:29] in the word of god
[57:30] thus saith the lord hallelujah there
[57:33] will not be any rain till i called for
[57:35] oh what a statement
[57:36] he had been in the presence of god and
[57:38] been vindicated so perfect
[57:40] and remember that also follows amos 3 7
[57:43] the lord god will do nothing until first
[57:45] he reveals it
[57:46] to his servants the prophets said
[57:48] there's not going to be any rain
[57:51] for amen and and elijah spoke this now
[57:54] i want to just just just just hit that
[57:56] little statement where it says it might
[57:58] even be against their own thinking
[58:00] can you imagine a man when isaiah goes
[58:03] out and prophesies
[58:05] it says a virgin shall conceive amen
[58:08] it's against his own thinking
[58:10] something like this has never happened
[58:12] but but because he's so
[58:14] wrapped up in the word hallelujah
[58:17] because he's so
[58:18] connected to the word and this is this
[58:20] is amen one of our
[58:22] problems amen today can i just say it
[58:24] this way
[58:25] we're we're more connected to social
[58:27] media
[58:28] than we are to the world we're more
[58:31] connected to the news
[58:33] than we are to the words amen oftentimes
[58:35] when i hear people talk
[58:37] i hear him telling me what the news
[58:38] person said i hear him telling me what
[58:40] this person said
[58:41] but i never hear them quote one
[58:44] scripture
[58:46] hallelujah church amen we went to
[58:48] connected to many too many things in
[58:50] this world we got to get ourselves
[58:52] reconnected to the word of god
[58:54] hallelujah
[58:55] quote the word of god speak the word of
[58:58] god
[58:59] become the word of god i'ma tell you i
[59:02] can't trust too many sources
[59:04] amen but i can trust god's word amen
[59:07] this is this ain't fake news right here
[59:09] this
[59:09] this is the real deal i can trust the
[59:12] word of god
[59:13] all right hey man it goes on here in
[59:16] another little statement
[59:18] actually i'll leave that amen out i'll
[59:20] leave that i
[59:22] he made the you know he's saying how
[59:25] this man is taking the place of god
[59:28] you know when when when he's when he's
[59:31] speaking
[59:32] uh he has he's standing there with a
[59:34] with an opportunity amen he's so wrapped
[59:37] up in god and
[59:38] and and just so so so connected that
[59:41] when he step out on the inspiration it's
[59:43] as if god himself was coming out and a
[59:45] man
[59:46] speaking hallelujah glory to god was
[59:49] like god himself was coming through that
[59:51] man
[59:51] now now i i want to be able to show you
[59:55] even in brother branham's ministry
[59:57] that he also had the opportunity to take
[1:00:00] the place of god
[1:00:01] now remember um the scriptures say
[1:00:04] uh that he was gonna send elijah the
[1:00:06] prophets
[1:00:07] amen before the great and terrible day
[1:00:09] of the lord so now now if that that
[1:00:11] spirit is coming again it will manifest
[1:00:14] similar things if elijah in the
[1:00:17] scripture
[1:00:18] can stand up and say it will not reign
[1:00:21] until i call for it amen then that same
[1:00:25] anointing would be able to come upon a
[1:00:27] man and we see some of these same things
[1:00:29] manifested in his ministry
[1:00:31] hallelujah glory to god i was reminded
[1:00:35] of a
[1:00:36] a situation that happened in brother
[1:00:38] manuel's ministry i won't take time to
[1:00:40] read it
[1:00:41] but if you ever wanted to go back and
[1:00:42] and hear him tell the testimony about it
[1:00:44] it's in the message speak
[1:00:46] uh to this mountain and he was just
[1:00:48] telling the story of how
[1:00:49] the angel lord had warned him it says
[1:00:52] there's a big trap
[1:00:53] set for you hey man there's a there's a
[1:00:55] big trap set for you now
[1:00:57] now it's one thing for the angel lord to
[1:00:59] tell you that it's a big trap
[1:01:01] but amen i guess the other part is why
[1:01:03] won't you tell me what the trap is
[1:01:06] hallelujah you tell them it's a big trap
[1:01:08] and if you know it's a trap tell me what
[1:01:10] the trap is so i'll be prepared for it
[1:01:12] but see god wants you to walk
[1:01:14] by faith and not by sight so he won't
[1:01:17] explain
[1:01:18] everything to you amen because he's
[1:01:20] trying to pull something out of you he
[1:01:24] would not explain this to the prophet
[1:01:26] because he was trying to pull something
[1:01:27] out of the prophet i am only going to
[1:01:29] let you know
[1:01:30] there's a big trap set for you
[1:01:33] saying okay all right lord i don't know
[1:01:35] what's going on so it's headed to some
[1:01:37] meetings
[1:01:38] and as he was going to the meetings amen
[1:01:40] he thought to himself like
[1:01:41] he said something's going to happen here
[1:01:43] and i don't know what it's going to be
[1:01:44] but something's going to happen
[1:01:45] it's a big trap for me he didn't know
[1:01:47] what what to expect and as he was
[1:01:48] sitting in the meeting
[1:01:50] preaching the word of god there's two
[1:01:52] young people a young man and a young one
[1:01:54] a young woman
[1:01:54] they just start uh making making love
[1:01:57] right there in front of everybody
[1:01:58] brother branham said please stop that
[1:01:59] you
[1:02:00] he say what you're doing is pulling all
[1:02:01] the attention off of me preaching the
[1:02:03] word
[1:02:03] and putting it on you say please don't
[1:02:05] do that and and the young man he said a
[1:02:07] young man looked at him and just laughed
[1:02:09] at him
[1:02:09] it says he kept preaching the young man
[1:02:11] got worse and worse
[1:02:13] he said please don't do that young man
[1:02:15] please he said
[1:02:16] you know y'all if it's that you know
[1:02:18] that bad y'all need to go get a room
[1:02:20] somewhere
[1:02:21] amen but don't do that in the house of
[1:02:22] god this is the house of god don't do
[1:02:24] that
[1:02:24] hey hey hey hey hey man that's why you
[1:02:28] know
[1:02:28] glory to god sometimes you go to
[1:02:29] churches and people be all hugged up on
[1:02:31] each other
[1:02:32] and no that's not the time to do that
[1:02:37] i'm going to tell you something else
[1:02:39] when you see that
[1:02:40] in a family that show that there's no
[1:02:42] affection at home
[1:02:46] that i'm going to tell you that i'm
[1:02:47] gonna just be honest with you it shows
[1:02:49] that defection does not take place at
[1:02:51] home
[1:02:51] the affection only takes place here at
[1:02:53] the house house of the lord
[1:02:54] something wrong with that picture
[1:02:58] it's a truth in it how amen glory to god
[1:03:01] i come here to worship
[1:03:03] i come here to praise god amen
[1:03:07] there's a time and place for everything
[1:03:09] and this ain't the time
[1:03:11] this ain't the place all right church
[1:03:14] glory to god but here that here the
[1:03:16] young man is all hooked up on this young
[1:03:18] lady
[1:03:19] and now they're making out you know in
[1:03:21] the church and brother man said
[1:03:22] stop don't do that i say i actually
[1:03:24] young man don't do that
[1:03:25] and so he's the young man kept laughing
[1:03:27] at him so
[1:03:28] say all of a sudden just got real quiet
[1:03:30] and brother branham
[1:03:32] pierced his eyes and some people say
[1:03:33] when brother branham sometimes would
[1:03:34] look at you a certain way
[1:03:36] it's like he can look right through your
[1:03:38] soul
[1:03:39] and he looked at the young man and it
[1:03:41] just just it just got quiet the young
[1:03:43] man was just
[1:03:44] sitting there looking at brother in like
[1:03:45] what's going to happen now and he said
[1:03:46] brother
[1:03:47] i'm saying heard a voice say just just
[1:03:49] uh just just just
[1:03:50] smite him dead right here he said
[1:03:52] because say the angels say
[1:03:53] they're in your hands whatever you say
[1:03:56] they are in your hands so whatever you
[1:03:58] say it's going to be
[1:04:00] just like you said taking the place of
[1:04:03] god
[1:04:04] right so so he say uh he said he sat
[1:04:06] there oh
[1:04:07] glory to god he said then had to pause
[1:04:10] for a listen say
[1:04:10] say just smite him blind smite him dead
[1:04:13] he had all kind of thoughts flowing
[1:04:15] through his head
[1:04:16] he said but before he could say anything
[1:04:19] before he could
[1:04:20] let anything at his mouth he said i
[1:04:21] forgive you jesus
[1:04:24] let me tell you something this kind of
[1:04:26] power is controlled by
[1:04:28] motive and objective hallelujah amen
[1:04:31] brother branham even told us in
[1:04:33] in one little spot here let me see if i
[1:04:34] can i'll just bring this in really quick
[1:04:37] it says uh character is a victory a man
[1:04:40] not a gift
[1:04:42] a man without character can't ring
[1:04:45] because power apart from character is
[1:04:48] satanic glory to god but
[1:04:52] power with character is fit to rule
[1:04:55] this big trap for the prophet was trying
[1:04:58] god wanted to see how he was going to
[1:05:00] respond
[1:05:01] with that kind of power i want to tell
[1:05:04] you something god is also watching how
[1:05:06] you're going to respond with the power
[1:05:07] that he's giving you
[1:05:09] here he's stood in the place of god to
[1:05:11] be able to pronounce
[1:05:12] death or life over this couple he
[1:05:15] pronounced
[1:05:16] life some of us we we're so so so so so
[1:05:20] uh
[1:05:20] adamant about having power but we ain't
[1:05:22] got no character that's why god can't
[1:05:24] give it to us
[1:05:25] you would kill everybody as soon as soon
[1:05:28] as people do something against what you
[1:05:30] want to do
[1:05:30] they dead praise the lord in your heart
[1:05:34] it's the truth anyhow amen
[1:05:36] amen your actions prove that your
[1:05:38] actions prove that your character's not
[1:05:40] lined up with the power that god won't
[1:05:42] entrust you with
[1:05:44] all right let me go a little further
[1:05:46] brother branham also had another spot
[1:05:49] where he stood in the place of god and i
[1:05:52] want to read this i want to take time to
[1:05:54] read this one amen
[1:05:55] uh uh today uh i think it's important
[1:05:58] but when he preached a marriage marriage
[1:06:01] and when he preached a message marriage
[1:06:02] and divorce
[1:06:03] he was standing in the place of god
[1:06:07] just like elijah was standing in the
[1:06:10] place of god the prophet himself found
[1:06:12] himself standing
[1:06:13] in the place of god now look at this
[1:06:15] look at this
[1:06:17] who is this melchizedek amen is where
[1:06:20] uh where we're going and uh and then
[1:06:23] i'll come back to marriage and divorce
[1:06:24] but who is this melchizedek he says this
[1:06:27] says now i just want to comment
[1:06:30] just a moment on the morning's message
[1:06:33] the morning's message was
[1:06:35] married to divorce it says i want to
[1:06:37] comment
[1:06:38] amen on this morning's message now now i
[1:06:40] need you to understand
[1:06:42] according to marriage and divorce one of
[1:06:44] the great truths that the prophet
[1:06:45] brought out
[1:06:46] amen is that a minister must marry a
[1:06:49] virgin
[1:06:49] amen this is one of the great truths
[1:06:52] that he brought out
[1:06:53] hallelujah but also amen he took the
[1:06:55] people back to levitical law
[1:06:57] and he presented this truth that had
[1:06:58] been covered in scripture for years
[1:07:01] but the prophet gave us light on this
[1:07:04] but he also
[1:07:05] knew that when he brought this truth to
[1:07:07] the church he said
[1:07:08] so many folk gonna be so messed up
[1:07:11] they're not gonna know what to do
[1:07:12] so he had to wait on god to get an
[1:07:15] answer from god as to how he was going
[1:07:18] to present this
[1:07:19] to the people so first he gave them
[1:07:22] levitical law
[1:07:23] hallelujah but at the end of the sermon
[1:07:27] he brought some grace and some people
[1:07:30] fail to hear the grace that's broken
[1:07:33] hallelujah standing in the place of god
[1:07:39] watch this now watch this amen says now
[1:07:41] i just want to comment just a moment
[1:07:44] on the morning's message there's no
[1:07:45] doubt i didn't get completely through
[1:07:48] with it
[1:07:48] and i see so he left some things even
[1:07:50] unsaved
[1:07:51] i didn't get completely through with it
[1:07:54] but i
[1:07:55] think you understand
[1:07:59] you got to catch it spiritually it says
[1:08:01] and i'm sure you i'm sure you didn't
[1:08:04] look at that statement
[1:08:08] i didn't get completely through with it
[1:08:11] but i think you
[1:08:12] understand and then and i'm sure you
[1:08:15] didn't
[1:08:17] hallelujah so where you find yourself
[1:08:20] glory it says you'll never know
[1:08:22] what that was for me to do he says now
[1:08:25] it seems very simple to you but you see
[1:08:29] what you're doing
[1:08:30] you are taking the place of god
[1:08:34] to pronounce something that is what the
[1:08:37] prophet's saying say
[1:08:38] i'm taking the place of god to pronounce
[1:08:40] something i watch this
[1:08:41] he says and before i would do that it
[1:08:44] had to come an answer from god
[1:08:46] and he had to come down he visibly
[1:08:49] showed himself
[1:08:50] and gave the revelation that so
[1:08:52] therefore see
[1:08:53] this is to the church this ain't for
[1:08:54] everybody glory to god this same for
[1:08:57] everybody hey man if you can't handle it
[1:09:00] it's not for you
[1:09:02] but this is for the church
[1:09:05] glory to god and remember i said these
[1:09:08] this is what i said was to the church
[1:09:10] only
[1:09:13] and so that you might have confidence
[1:09:16] and no that was the same god that said
[1:09:18] to me up there there was no squirrel
[1:09:21] speak and say where they'll be and three
[1:09:23] straight times it happened
[1:09:25] now if he can if he can by that same
[1:09:27] word create something
[1:09:28] that isn't there how much more will this
[1:09:31] whole fast at the day of judgment see
[1:09:33] people were there to see these things
[1:09:35] and know as paul
[1:09:37] said in days gone by there was man with
[1:09:39] him who felt the earth shake
[1:09:41] and did hear the voice but they seen the
[1:09:43] pill of fire
[1:09:44] now let's go let's keep on reading in
[1:09:46] this statement he says it done me good
[1:09:49] though after it was over after he
[1:09:52] preached the marriage of marriage and
[1:09:54] divorce
[1:09:54] after it was over it was a tough message
[1:09:57] and he says but
[1:09:58] after it was over how can the people get
[1:10:01] to this place
[1:10:02] after a tough message like that unless
[1:10:04] they actually received the grace
[1:10:07] that was brought in the message you know
[1:10:10] before this message marriage and divorce
[1:10:12] was preached brother random say
[1:10:13] it'll be men he said he had a man on his
[1:10:15] on his front porch
[1:10:16] asking the question should i leave or
[1:10:18] should i stay with her he said brother
[1:10:20] please don't do nothing until i get back
[1:10:22] and preach the sermon
[1:10:23] the man had no idea what to do with this
[1:10:25] truth
[1:10:26] hallelujah it's like a little baby with
[1:10:28] a gun you wouldn't give it to them they
[1:10:30] don't know how they don't understand
[1:10:31] they don't understand the power behind
[1:10:33] all that glory to god
[1:10:34] so so when this truth came people i mean
[1:10:37] it just it revolutionized everybody's
[1:10:39] thinking let me just
[1:10:40] let me just read the quote let me read
[1:10:42] the quote look at this
[1:10:44] he says it dummy good though afterwards
[1:10:46] over to see husbands and wives
[1:10:48] that i know is genuine christians
[1:10:51] hugging one another and weeping he says
[1:10:55] and listen friends
[1:10:56] god confirms his word with signs and
[1:10:58] vindications
[1:11:00] to prove that it's right the spoken word
[1:11:02] now remember
[1:11:03] that light was it the light that was in
[1:11:06] that cloud
[1:11:06] that gave the revelation says my little
[1:11:09] girl
[1:11:09] was telling me sarah here when i say the
[1:11:12] school there in arizona was looking up
[1:11:14] there on a cloudless sky and seeing this
[1:11:17] cloud mysteriously in that mountain
[1:11:19] going up and down god had witnesses
[1:11:22] watching the cloud going up and down the
[1:11:24] mountain
[1:11:24] and while the cloud was there was the
[1:11:26] voice of god coming to the prophet
[1:11:28] giving him what to say to the people
[1:11:31] letting him as a prophet represent god
[1:11:35] amen take the place of god oh
[1:11:38] i don't even know if i'm gonna finish
[1:11:39] this today but let me
[1:11:41] i got i got i got i just want to say i
[1:11:43] just i gotta say this thing
[1:11:44] a prophet can stand there and take the
[1:11:46] place of god
[1:11:48] amen because he and the word becomes one
[1:11:51] now you gotta be able to receive that
[1:11:53] from a prophet watch this now
[1:11:55] he says uh say this that school there in
[1:11:57] arizona was looking up there on the
[1:11:59] cloudless sky
[1:12:00] seeing this cloud mysteriously in that
[1:12:02] mountain going up and down
[1:12:04] with an amber fire burning in it the
[1:12:06] teacher dismissed the classes
[1:12:08] and the school and brought them out
[1:12:10] front said did you ever see anything
[1:12:12] like that
[1:12:13] look the way of the way that's there
[1:12:16] remember
[1:12:16] that's that same amber light that's on
[1:12:19] the rock
[1:12:20] so it's the same god same revelation
[1:12:22] said
[1:12:23] tell them to do this
[1:12:26] it was uh is what i told you this
[1:12:28] morning so there it is
[1:12:30] now let me go let me go on it says if it
[1:12:33] happens to me that my good friend
[1:12:34] brother roy robertson is listing that
[1:12:36] listening in at tucson so
[1:12:39] brother roy roberson was not at church
[1:12:43] can we put it this way brother roy
[1:12:44] roberson was streaming
[1:12:55] he had to catch the revelation of what
[1:12:57] god was saying through the prophet
[1:13:00] i'm telling you even on the stream right
[1:13:03] now
[1:13:04] somebody has caught the revelation of
[1:13:06] what god has spoke to as prophet
[1:13:09] because that prophet was taking the
[1:13:11] place of god
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:16] all right let me go a little further let
[1:13:18] me just read the quote
[1:13:20] amen it says if if it happens to be that
[1:13:24] my good friend brother roy roberson
[1:13:26] is listening in at tucson roy you
[1:13:29] remember
[1:13:30] the other day the vision you sing when
[1:13:32] we were out standing upon the mountain
[1:13:34] you come up to me and that cloud was
[1:13:36] over the top
[1:13:38] come walking down you know what he told
[1:13:40] you and i told you at the house the
[1:13:42] other day
[1:13:43] that's it roy don't worry no more son
[1:13:47] it's over he wasn't there in the church
[1:13:51] to hear that but he heard it on the
[1:13:52] stream
[1:13:53] i can imagine brother roy just shouting
[1:13:55] all over his house
[1:13:56] he wasn't even able to see the problem
[1:13:58] he just had to listen audio
[1:14:00] i can imagine him shouting because he's
[1:14:02] probably free from something that had
[1:14:03] him bothered for years
[1:14:05] he said it's over when a prophet says
[1:14:07] it's over
[1:14:09] man it's over yes it is i ain't gonna
[1:14:12] have no more mind battles over it
[1:14:14] i ain't gonna worry about it because the
[1:14:16] prophet said it was over
[1:14:19] and that prophet is taking the place of
[1:14:21] god
[1:14:22] then what i'm trying to tell you when
[1:14:24] that prophet is giving you thus saith
[1:14:25] the lord is just
[1:14:26] like god himself spoke that to you
[1:14:29] god says it's over
[1:14:33] all right i'm going further it says you
[1:14:36] just don't know what that means
[1:14:39] it's grace he loves you
[1:14:42] and you love him humbly serve him and
[1:14:44] worship him the rest of your days be
[1:14:45] happy go ahead
[1:14:47] go ahead and live as you
[1:14:50] are hallelujah if you're happy
[1:14:54] now now somebody might take it and say
[1:14:55] well i ain't happy
[1:14:59] glory to god i ain't happy so i'm gonna
[1:15:01] go ahead no no no no no no
[1:15:02] you better recognize this grace that god
[1:15:04] has given you and don't make grace a
[1:15:06] disgrace
[1:15:08] it says if you're happy continue that
[1:15:10] way don't never
[1:15:12] do anything wrong again like that just
[1:15:14] go ahead it's god's
[1:15:16] grace now i just couldn't leave you
[1:15:18] there i had to take time and read this
[1:15:20] part today if y'all don't mind
[1:15:22] i want to go back now to marriage and
[1:15:24] divorce so you understand what he was
[1:15:25] referring to
[1:15:27] amen this was coming at the end of the
[1:15:30] sermon so
[1:15:30] you know we we listen to the front of
[1:15:32] the sermon we listen to the beginning
[1:15:33] sermon we're like oh
[1:15:34] my i mean it's a this is a tough one
[1:15:37] especially if you've been married and
[1:15:38] divorced
[1:15:39] it's a tough sermon it's a tough sermon
[1:15:41] and uh but but nonetheless
[1:15:42] it's truth god had to use the prophet to
[1:15:45] bring truth back to the people
[1:15:46] you know if we don't hear truth then our
[1:15:48] family is going to be all messed up
[1:15:51] just being honest our families remember
[1:15:53] god needs some generation to start
[1:15:55] living according to his word
[1:15:57] right because the scripture actually
[1:15:59] said god
[1:16:00] hate divorce god actually hate it
[1:16:03] amen it's one thing if there's one thing
[1:16:05] god hate divorce is one of them
[1:16:08] hallelujah but you know oh lord i don't
[1:16:10] know i'm just i'm gonna be all over the
[1:16:12] place lord i'm gonna just
[1:16:13] have to do it
[1:16:17] last last week we had a brother here at
[1:16:19] the church and i just encourage y'all go
[1:16:21] listen to his testimony he came here
[1:16:23] last week i didn't even know
[1:16:24] what what the brother's testimony was
[1:16:27] and he was talking about how him and his
[1:16:28] wife was just going through so much
[1:16:30] you know in their marriage and how they
[1:16:32] were on the brink of divorce in the
[1:16:33] message
[1:16:34] you know him living outside the house
[1:16:36] and eventually you know the wife let him
[1:16:38] come back and live in the basement in
[1:16:39] the house and
[1:16:40] you know he just living down there he
[1:16:41] said just just so much that was going
[1:16:43] wrong
[1:16:44] in their marriage he couldn't see it he
[1:16:45] couldn't understand he didn't realize
[1:16:47] 99 of the problem of the marriage was
[1:16:49] him
[1:16:52] he thought it was his wife but one day
[1:16:54] god shined the light on him and he could
[1:16:56] see his
[1:16:56] error right and once he saw his error
[1:16:59] then he's able to repent
[1:17:00] and go make things white write with his
[1:17:02] wife and make things right with his
[1:17:03] daughter
[1:17:04] and he said you know the problem is he
[1:17:06] says uh we're in the message we talk you
[1:17:08] know
[1:17:08] divorce is wrong he said but there are
[1:17:10] real problems that hit marriage they say
[1:17:12] and
[1:17:12] unfortunately there is no church message
[1:17:15] church
[1:17:16] that actually helps people with their
[1:17:18] problems in in marriage
[1:17:20] he said i had to go to denominational
[1:17:22] church
[1:17:23] and get assistance for my marriage i say
[1:17:25] that's wrong
[1:17:27] we we ought to be able to minister to
[1:17:29] the whole person
[1:17:31] praise the lord right and and my my
[1:17:33] heart just began to kind of bleed i said
[1:17:35] lord we got to do better
[1:17:37] right we got to do things better right
[1:17:39] here even in our own church we got to be
[1:17:40] able to minister to hurting couples
[1:17:43] sometimes people come here and they put
[1:17:44] on a good show glory to god i just gave
[1:17:47] you some insight and i hope y'all don't
[1:17:49] don't don't pick at people y'all see
[1:17:50] them all hooked up on each other oh you
[1:17:52] remember what brother jack say they
[1:17:53] ain't hugging each other
[1:17:54] don't do that to people what you ought
[1:17:57] to be doing like you know hey god bless
[1:17:58] you everything good
[1:18:00] maybe we should get together for some
[1:18:01] fellowship

[1:18:12] individual how we can help one another
[1:18:16] we ought to we ought to felt conviction
[1:18:18] on that
[1:18:19] god i can do better than what i'm doing
[1:18:20] right now marriages need
[1:18:22] help people are holding on by thread god
[1:18:26] don't like divorce but how can we help
[1:18:28] people

[1:19:14] i've had many conversations with
[1:19:15] brothers before they got married
[1:19:17] amen and they would tell you some of the
[1:19:20] things i had to say to him amen
[1:19:22] i have to do that because we got to
[1:19:24] teach our children
[1:19:25] all right i'm going to read the rest of
[1:19:26] this quote that's why
[1:19:29] i i i this might be a part two
[1:19:33] the lord knows all things look at this
[1:19:35] this is the marriage and divorce
[1:19:38] this is where when they say you you
[1:19:39] didn't understand i was taking a place
[1:19:41] with god
[1:19:42] and saying something now brother branham
[1:19:44] didn't just step up there to take the
[1:19:45] place of god he had to have
[1:19:47] a supernatural experience with god
[1:19:49] before he would even release words like
[1:19:51] this
[1:19:51] and he says what happened while they
[1:19:53] were in the mountain while he was in the
[1:19:55] mountain praying over the sermon
[1:19:57] marriage and divorce
[1:19:57] say the angel lord came into the
[1:19:59] mountain just going up and down like a
[1:20:01] pill of fire
[1:20:02] his daughter in school saw not just her
[1:20:06] but the kids in her class was out for
[1:20:08] recess at the time
[1:20:09] and they could see the angel lord going
[1:20:11] up and down the mountain the light just
[1:20:13] going up and down
[1:20:13] they knew something was going on brother
[1:20:15] brad would come out the mountain went to
[1:20:16] a gas station uh brother ronnie was at
[1:20:18] the gas station brother branham
[1:20:20] you was just over there praying weren't

[1:20:25] could show you the spot where you was at
[1:20:27] you was over there prancing aw brother
[1:20:29] and brother brown said he told him that
[1:20:30] just to kind of throw him off
[1:20:32] he said he said no brother that now he
[1:20:34] said brother branham
[1:20:35] we watched it from right here that there
[1:20:38] was a supernatural being just going up
[1:20:40] and down the mountain in that spot in
[1:20:42] the mouth
[1:20:42] of two or three witnesses let every word
[1:20:46] be established
[1:20:47] the children in school saw it brother
[1:20:49] ronnie saw brother branham say so
[1:20:51] after that and after what the angel told
[1:20:52] him he knew he had the freedom
[1:20:54] to come out and say this yes he brought
[1:20:56] us to levitical law
[1:20:58] but then they took us to grace
[1:21:02] and some people want to keep you in the
[1:21:03] law
[1:21:05] they want to keep you in the law amen
[1:21:08] but there is some grace
[1:21:11] hallelujah and i'ma tell you i want
[1:21:13] grace
[1:21:16] and let me tell you something you ain't
[1:21:17] gonna get grace and then not give it
[1:21:23] hallelujah somebody right i mean you
[1:21:25] want it all for yourself

[1:24:20] uh if a person was divorced would they
[1:24:22] be able to make the rapture
[1:24:25] and brother adam would say now you know
[1:24:26] i don't know i don't know i mean divorce
[1:24:28] i can't see it i don't know i'm just i'm
[1:24:31] just not sure
[1:24:32] i just can't see that and you know he
[1:24:34] was just kind of going going along those
[1:24:35] lines and
[1:24:36] just trying to stay with the word but as
[1:24:38] he was looking at it
[1:24:39] i think god eventually began to show him
[1:24:42] that it's a predestinated that will go
[1:24:45] and last week brother nathan brought out
[1:24:47] a statement he say there's only
[1:24:48] one um unpardonable sin
[1:24:54] that's blaspheming the holy ghost he
[1:24:56] says but divorce
[1:24:58] was not an unpardonable sin hallelujah
[1:25:01] the grace of god can still cover people
[1:25:03] in that so so brother branham might
[1:25:05] he might have answered that question
[1:25:06] early but now coming on 1965
[1:25:09] before he leaves the sin you got to keep
[1:25:10] following that prophet now because the
[1:25:12] revelation is progressive
[1:25:15] come on church amen it progresses glory
[1:25:18] to god
[1:25:18] even jesus grew in knowledge
[1:25:21] the bible said that that means he was
[1:25:23] progressing
[1:25:25] and if jesus progressed you're gonna
[1:25:27] have to progress
[1:25:29] all right and if it's not for you he
[1:25:31] already told us this message is only for
[1:25:33] the church
[1:25:35] all right now now now now now i believe
[1:25:38] the grace of god
[1:25:39] certainly will allow a person that's
[1:25:40] been divorced to make the rapture
[1:25:42] i believe that grace is that powerful
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:46] see we just you know
[1:25:49] i was on the law too i was under law
[1:25:52] i was under law uh even when it come to
[1:25:55] dedicating babies
[1:25:58] that's been born out of wedlock because
[1:26:00] in the old testament
[1:26:03] generations couldn't come to church 10
[1:26:05] generations
[1:26:06] didn't even do nothing wrong i would
[1:26:08] just i just happened to be born in in
[1:26:10] this family
[1:26:11] i didn't even make a choice to be born
[1:26:12] in this family but i'm punished because
[1:26:15] i'm born in this family
[1:26:16] but grace has covered that
[1:26:19] they said what we got to do sometimes as
[1:26:21] churches amen
[1:26:22] is be able to kind of get over to the
[1:26:24] great side we we got the law we can
[1:26:27] we can pinpoint that thing the laws say
[1:26:29] this but where
[1:26:30] is grace
[1:26:33] and not that i'm trying to exclude the
[1:26:35] law i got to teach the law
[1:26:38] but how do we get people into grace
[1:26:40] watch this now i'm going further
[1:26:43] look at what the prophet says it says uh
[1:26:47] because misinterpreted theology i want
[1:26:49] to show you something that he told me
[1:26:51] and if god our creator was questioned
[1:26:54] the question
[1:26:55] when he was here on earth jesus christ
[1:26:57] because he had some questions about
[1:26:59] marriage and divorce that he answered
[1:27:00] and when his when his delivering prophet
[1:27:02] came forth moses
[1:27:04] all right uh moses down in egypt to
[1:27:07] bring the children out of egypt
[1:27:09] to put them in the promised land jesus
[1:27:11] said here that moses seen the people in
[1:27:13] this condition
[1:27:15] and he granted them a writing of
[1:27:17] divorcement
[1:27:18] because the situation was what it was
[1:27:22] moses found such as let him suffer god
[1:27:25] permitted moses
[1:27:26] the prophet sent to the people to grant
[1:27:30] this writing of divorce meant to them
[1:27:32] glory he says and in first corinthians
[1:27:35] the seventh chapter the 12th and 15th
[1:27:38] verse
[1:27:38] in the new testament of the new
[1:27:40] testament prophet
[1:27:42] paul who met the same thing in the
[1:27:44] church and spoke this
[1:27:46] this is i not the lord he's taken the
[1:27:50] place of god
[1:27:51] this is i not the lord that's right
[1:27:54] because
[1:27:54] of the divorce condition it wasn't so
[1:27:57] from the beginning
[1:27:58] but moses was permitted it
[1:28:02] and god recognized it
[1:28:07] what moses said god recognized it
[1:28:10] righteousness
[1:28:13] and what i'm trying to tell you if god
[1:28:15] recognized what moses said as
[1:28:17] righteousness
[1:28:19] god also gonna recognize what his
[1:28:20] prophet william marian branham says
[1:28:23] as righteousness amen
[1:28:26] oh lord have mercy jesus sometimes you
[1:28:29] preach things like this and
[1:28:30] you know everybody want to go free
[1:28:34] but you still got to have a gift and all
[1:28:35] kind of other things
[1:28:38] hey man you just don't get up and just
[1:28:39] do things if you ain't got no gift what
[1:28:41] you're doing
[1:28:42] you're wasting people time find your
[1:28:44] place in the body
[1:28:46] and operate in that do it faithfully
[1:28:49] and the other thing i want to like i
[1:28:50] said last week my brother stephen don't
[1:28:52] don't don't don't you know
[1:28:54] now you get a quote and now you just
[1:28:55] take off running but what you've been
[1:28:57] doing before the quote
[1:29:00] what you doing before the quote how
[1:29:02] faithful are you before the quote
[1:29:04] i said that brother was faithful as a
[1:29:05] sunday school teacher faithful as a song
[1:29:08] leader
[1:29:09] he found things that he could do where
[1:29:10] he was not hindered and he did him
[1:29:12] faithfully
[1:29:14] until god called him more now i'm not
[1:29:17] saying his situation is just i i don't
[1:29:18] know his situation but i do know this
[1:29:20] anybody feel like they got a call and
[1:29:22] you should already see something
[1:29:25] some faithfulness i can say that
[1:29:28] you just don't did we not looking for
[1:29:29] the one-hit wonders
[1:29:31] overnight overnight
[1:29:35] yeah it don't work like that you know
[1:29:37] you know you
[1:29:38] a quick investment get people jumping
[1:29:41] and shouting we
[1:29:42] adam been in church and i haven't seen
[1:29:44] them kind of testimonies
[1:29:46] i mean about it god delivered them last
[1:29:48] week from this and
[1:29:50] and man i was on drugs and i was this
[1:29:52] and god set me free and
[1:29:53] the whole church is oh glory hallelujah
[1:29:57] three months later
[1:30:02] he's out developing another testimony
[1:30:06] and ready to bring it back to the church
[1:30:08] no we don't want to hear it
[1:30:10] this time sit there praise god
[1:30:14] and live something now let your life be
[1:30:16] your testimony
[1:30:25] okay uh it wasn't so from beginning but
[1:30:28] moses
[1:30:28] permitted it god recognizes
[1:30:30] righteousness and paul
[1:30:32] also had a right a right
[1:30:35] these are these are some some tough
[1:30:37] words paul
[1:30:39] had a right now you just mean a lot
[1:30:42] doesn't mean a lot it should mean a lot
[1:30:44] to the bride because when brother
[1:30:45] brandon went to the other side
[1:30:47] and he um and and he saw you know all
[1:30:50] these people say and say
[1:30:51] god bless you my brother god bless you
[1:30:53] the angels say oh these are your
[1:30:54] converse they say all these brandon said
[1:30:56] no no these are your converts
[1:30:57] it's a converts he says yes they say say
[1:31:00] well um
[1:31:01] say they're going to be you know he said
[1:31:02] you can't see jesus now but one day
[1:31:04] you'll be taken to the level where you
[1:31:05] can see him
[1:31:07] he says paul here he said yeah is his
[1:31:08] group here yeah
[1:31:10] he said will paul be judged by the
[1:31:12] things that he preached and said yeah
[1:31:13] you're going to be judged by the things
[1:31:14] you preach
[1:31:14] he said well i preached the same thing
[1:31:17] paul preached
[1:31:19] and you know who said amen the saints
[1:31:24] millions said we are resting on that
[1:31:28] now i'm gonna go a little further i'ma
[1:31:30] just go a little further
[1:31:31] because i come from god and i'm going
[1:31:33] back to god
[1:31:34] i believe i was part of the millions
[1:31:40] i believe i was right there as part of
[1:31:42] the millions that said
[1:31:43] we're resting on that
[1:31:48] all right let's go can we go further i
[1:31:52] ain't finished reading the quote i ain't
[1:31:53] finished reading the quote so let's
[1:31:54] finish let me find
[1:31:55] my spot it says paul also had a right
[1:31:58] when he found his church in that
[1:32:00] condition now you believe this to be
[1:32:02] true
[1:32:03] and believe it to come from god and by
[1:32:05] the vindication
[1:32:06] of his cloud and his message that's
[1:32:08] brought me this far
[1:32:10] glory should not god upon the mountain
[1:32:14] permit me to do the same thing
[1:32:19] moses was permitted on the mountain paul
[1:32:22] permitted on the backside of the desert
[1:32:24] brother branham happened to be on a
[1:32:25] mountain in the desert
[1:32:30] taking the place of god now that really
[1:32:31] was my that was my title this morning
[1:32:33] taking the place of god
[1:32:35] but i said i want to kind of do
[1:32:36] something else a little different
[1:32:38] uh i thought i would get to this part a
[1:32:40] little faster but it just ain't
[1:32:41] happening
[1:32:42] amen god know why so uh let's go on he
[1:32:45] says uh
[1:32:47] it says uh uh now you believe this to be
[1:32:49] true and believe it come from god and
[1:32:51] the vindication of this cloud and this
[1:32:52] message that's brought me this far
[1:32:54] should not god upon the mountain permit
[1:32:56] me to do the same thing
[1:32:58] to suffer you to go on
[1:33:02] the way you are and do
[1:33:05] it no more he says go with your wives
[1:33:08] and live in peace for the hour is late
[1:33:11] the coming of the lord is at hand
[1:33:13] we haven't got time to break these
[1:33:15] things up
[1:33:16] don't you dare try to do it again i'm
[1:33:19] speaking only to my congregation
[1:33:22] but if you're married and god bore me
[1:33:24] witness of that on the mountain
[1:33:26] that i could say this is a supernatural
[1:33:30] revelation because of the opening of the
[1:33:33] seven seals
[1:33:34] and this is a question in god's word
[1:33:37] let them go on in as they are
[1:33:41] and sin no more that ain't levitical law
[1:33:46] that's grace let them go on in as they
[1:33:50] are
[1:33:50] and sin no more it wasn't so from the
[1:33:53] beginning
[1:33:53] that is right it wasn't so and it will
[1:33:56] not be at the end
[1:33:58] but under modern conditions
[1:34:02] as god's servant i won't call myself his
[1:34:06] prophet
[1:34:07] but i believe maybe i would have been
[1:34:09] sent for that
[1:34:10] i'm laying a ground for him when he does
[1:34:12] come so under the modern conditions
[1:34:16] look at this
[1:34:19] i command
[1:34:23] a commandment a commandment
[1:34:28] i mean i'm talking on the level thou
[1:34:29] shall not kill
[1:34:32] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:34:34] false witness
[1:34:35] thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:34:38] commandments ten of them
[1:34:40] here's a prophet says i command
[1:34:46] come on i command you to go to your home
[1:34:49] with your wife now don't talk about
[1:34:52] putting away
[1:34:53] go back to your house with your wife now
[1:34:55] under modern condition stay the way you
[1:34:57] are look at it he says if you are happy
[1:35:00] with her live with her raise your
[1:35:02] children and admonition of god
[1:35:03] but god be merciful to you if you do if
[1:35:06] you ever do that again
[1:35:07] you teach your children never to do a
[1:35:11] thing like that
[1:35:12] bring them up in the admonition of gods
[1:35:15] i tell you what i have
[1:35:16] taken this seriously we and i know
[1:35:18] earlier in my ministry we did a lot of
[1:35:20] talking with the youth talking with the
[1:35:21] youth talking with the youth
[1:35:23] and i made sure that they they knew
[1:35:24] certain things amen and and i'm i'm so
[1:35:27] grateful
[1:35:28] to see many of the young ladies that was
[1:35:29] coming up underneath this church they
[1:35:31] kept themselves
[1:35:32] and still keeping themselves amen i
[1:35:35] appreciate that and i know god will
[1:35:37] bless them for it
[1:35:38] i taught the young men in this church
[1:35:40] too i know i did amen and i'll continue
[1:35:43] to teach them
[1:35:44] glory to god amen uh i'm interested in
[1:35:47] sister we're gonna have a conversation
[1:35:49] oh yeah we're gonna talk some things i
[1:35:52] may not come out here and tell everybody
[1:35:53] but me and that brother and most
[1:35:55] brothers that
[1:35:56] had to go through and get married we've
[1:35:57] had conversations sometimes there's some
[1:35:59] very unique situations
[1:36:01] glory to god but most of the time i had
[1:36:03] that conversation sometimes
[1:36:05] the conversation been so uh i have to be
[1:36:07] so real
[1:36:09] amen that it had i seen it impact some
[1:36:11] of them they lose their faith
[1:36:13] that's not that's not that's not for you
[1:36:15] to lose your faith that's to protect you
[1:36:17] and i and i was commanded to tell the
[1:36:20] children
[1:36:21] not to do it do it a certain way so i've
[1:36:23] done that
[1:36:24] amen i won't come every sunday and read
[1:36:26] this quote
[1:36:28] i won't read it i will live it praise
[1:36:31] the lord
[1:36:32] but i felt it was important because we
[1:36:33] talked about taking the place of god
[1:36:35] there was
[1:36:35] i mean elijah stood there it ain't gonna
[1:36:38] rain until
[1:36:39] i called for it now that same annoying
[1:36:42] to his own brother branham
[1:36:44] and now he's he's taking the place of
[1:36:45] god when he's pronouncing marriage and
[1:36:47] divorce
[1:36:48] that same anointing glory to god look at
[1:36:50] this
[1:36:52] it says you teach your children never to
[1:36:53] do a thing like that bring them up in
[1:36:55] the admonition of god
[1:36:56] and now that you are as you are let us
[1:36:59] go now
[1:37:00] at the late evening hour that we're
[1:37:02] living in and press
[1:37:03] towards the mark of the high calling in
[1:37:05] christ where all things will be
[1:37:07] possible until i see you tonight the
[1:37:10] lord bless you while we pray
[1:37:12] those were his closing statements
[1:37:15] to one of the most difficult sermons
[1:37:18] that was ever preached
[1:37:19] marriage and divorce but i told you we
[1:37:21] had the levitical part
[1:37:23] everybody got that but we also need to
[1:37:24] see where he brought the grace in at the
[1:37:26] very end
[1:37:27] hallelujah and there's people that can
[1:37:29] walk in that grace
[1:37:31] all right all right
[1:37:34] i i i had a question is it only for
[1:37:37] profits
[1:37:38] but i can't i don't think i'm gonna be
[1:37:40] able to get to that
[1:37:42] amen i think i'm gonna have to bring
[1:37:44] this back as a part two
[1:37:46] and um and just kind of carry us a
[1:37:48] little further
[1:37:49] in this i i i i
[1:37:53] i i just believe that we want to build
[1:37:55] the church up
[1:37:57] amen in the faith for this hour it's
[1:38:00] going to take a little bit more
[1:38:02] than what we have had hey man we got a
[1:38:05] god got something else for us to walk in
[1:38:06] now i i i'm going to bring i'm going to
[1:38:09] answer this question i'm not going to
[1:38:10] answer it
[1:38:11] was that only for the prophets
[1:38:14] for them to stand and take the place of
[1:38:16] god was that only for the prophets moses
[1:38:19] had it
[1:38:20] glory to god amen we saw it in brother
[1:38:22] branham's ministry
[1:38:23] uh paul even had it you know but but but
[1:38:25] what's that only for the prophets
[1:38:28] i'm just already tell you no no no no no
[1:38:30] no no
[1:38:32] i'm just giving you a little sneak peek
[1:38:35] with a little statement
[1:38:40] when a spirit born
[1:38:44] is that enough
[1:38:51] when a spirit born spirit-filled man
[1:38:56] in faith takes that word into his heart
[1:39:00] see he becoming one with the word right
[1:39:02] and places it upon
[1:39:04] his lips why
[1:39:08] that is the same as deity speaking
[1:39:13] and it didn't stop they say every
[1:39:15] mountain has to go
[1:39:16] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:39:21] so i'm gonna leave it at the prophet
[1:39:22] there's more quotes in here i gotta go
[1:39:24] further but
[1:39:25] god knows what he's saying god knows
[1:39:27] what he's doing
[1:39:29] god bless you god bless you
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:37] part two will be coming amen let's pray
[1:39:40] let's pray
[1:39:42] father we thank your god for your word
[1:39:47] thank you for your truth scripture tells
[1:39:49] us that we will know the truth and the
[1:39:50] truth will make
[1:39:52] us free so lord as we just look at
[1:39:55] just some things here in scripture and
[1:39:56] look at you lord how you manifested
[1:39:59] yourself through your prophet we can
[1:40:01] connect the dots you said i
[1:40:04] i think you understand but i'm sure you
[1:40:06] don't
[1:40:08] lord you know people just wouldn't catch
[1:40:09] it you knew it
[1:40:12] but yet lord there would be a small
[1:40:14] percentage that would walk lord
[1:40:15] according to the grace that was given
[1:40:17] and
[1:40:18] not trying to make grace a disgrace but
[1:40:21] oh god they would begin
[1:40:22] to realize amen what what it really
[1:40:26] means to have mercy what it really means
[1:40:30] to have grace
[1:40:32] god they offer that to others lord it's
[1:40:35] our desire
[1:40:36] here not to be off the word we want to
[1:40:38] be on the word we want to
[1:40:40] we want to walk according to the word of
[1:40:42] god we want to keep it
[1:40:44] balanced properly and god we got to have
[1:40:48] the right balance when it comes to
[1:40:49] to this message i think sometimes
[1:40:52] because we've been out of balance we
[1:40:53] have destroyed many people
[1:40:56] we've hurt many people along the way and
[1:40:58] some that just
[1:41:00] they can't they can't break free from
[1:41:02] lord these prisons that they're in in
[1:41:04] their mind
[1:41:05] because of the way things was presented
[1:41:07] to them
[1:41:08] god our prayer is that you would just
[1:41:10] allow them to see
[1:41:12] the complete picture yes we see law we
[1:41:15] got it it's right there in leviticus we
[1:41:17] see it
[1:41:18] but under modern conditions the prophet
[1:41:22] was told to
[1:41:23] declare something something lord that
[1:41:26] um we couldn't necessarily say that we
[1:41:29] find it just like that in scripture but
[1:41:32] yet he was taking the place of god
[1:41:35] a supernatural revelation was given to
[1:41:38] him
[1:41:39] and god he gave it to us now it's up to
[1:41:41] us to do with that and take that and use
[1:41:43] that the proper way
[1:41:45] help us to have the right motive and the
[1:41:47] right objective help us check our hearts
[1:41:49] god
