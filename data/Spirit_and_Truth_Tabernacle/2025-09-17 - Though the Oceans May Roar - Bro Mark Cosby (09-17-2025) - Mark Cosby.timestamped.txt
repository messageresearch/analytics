[2:08] Amen. Amen.
[2:10] I was uh I was reminded this week of
[2:14] uh the back part of my testimony that I
[2:17] wasn't privy to. Um I had to be told,
[2:19] but I thank God that he had a plan
[2:22] before I arrived. He he he knew where I
[2:26] would be even if I didn't. So, thank God
[2:28] for predestination.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; So, I just I'll just ask you to bow your
[2:34] heads. We're going to say a prayer over
[2:35] the service.
[2:36] Um,
[2:39] dear heavenly father, Lord God, thank
[2:41] you Lord God for just just being a God
[2:44] of grace and mercy. No matter where
[2:47] we've been, Lord God, we're here today.

[2:51] moment, Lord God, but we not who we used
[2:53] to be, Lord God. Lord God, thank you for
[2:56] just keeping your hands over us, Lord,
[2:58] protecting us, Lord, from things we
[3:00] don't even know, Lord God. We're not
[3:02] even aware of, Jesus. We take so many
[3:04] things for granted, Lord God. We just
[3:07] want to take this moment and tell you,
[3:08] Lord God, we can never thank you enough,
[3:10] heavenly father. Lord, we just ask,
[3:13] Lord, that that your word come forth,
[3:15] Lord, in and in in today, Lord God. Use

[3:20] itself out of the way, Lord God, to be
[3:21] used by you, Lord, so we can hear from
[3:23] our favorite preacher, the Holy Ghost.

[8:02] that's um going through. Amen. At this
[8:06] time and just trusting and we know that
[8:09] God is a miracle worker and and he's
[8:12] going to need a miracle. Um but we just
[8:15] want to just take my my uncle Henry,
[8:18] amen, before the Lord in prayer. Uh,

[8:43] the situation is, it's not impossible.
[8:46] Uh for all things are possible to those
[8:48] that believe and and Lord, we are
[8:51] believers. So the the only thing we know
[8:54] to do is to pray and to seek our God. Uh
[8:57] we ask that you just intervene. You see
[8:59] my uncle in his condition and situation
[9:01] that he's in. And he needs a touch from
[9:03] you, Lord. Doctors uh can't do it. The
[9:06] nurses can't do it, but you can. So

[9:10] you move by your spirit uh upon his
[9:14] need. look upon this family uh Lord as
[9:16] they're just kind of enduring this time.
[9:19] Uh strengthen their faith Lord just to

[10:08] is not my own.
[10:11] Oh, to you
[10:12] [Music]
[10:14] &gt;&gt; and I give myself
[10:18] [Music]
[10:30] &gt;&gt; I
[10:37] Amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you
[10:40] tonight. Who's happen to be in the house
[10:41] of the Lord tonight.
[10:43] Amen.
[10:45] Musicians, you can take your seats if
[10:47] you'd like. Um, let us bow our heads in
[10:50] a word of prayer.
[10:52] Dear gracious heavenly father, we
[10:55] just thank you, Lord, for the desire
[10:57] just to be here in your house, in your
[10:59] presence, Lord. Lord, you've carried us
[11:02] through, Lord, this midweek, Lord. And
[11:04] we know we're here because of your grace
[11:06] and your mercy, Lord. Father, we're here
[11:09] just to hear even as one word from you.
[11:11] Lord, may you transform us and change us
[11:14] by your word. Lord, your word is the
[11:16] only word uh word in this entire world
[11:19] that can change and transform and change
[11:22] situations, Lord, and do so many things
[11:25] that we can't even imagine that it can
[11:27] do. Father, Lord, may you just be with
[11:30] us as you're always with us, Lord. May
[11:31] you bless any of those who are coming on
[11:34] their way here, Lord. May you help us to
[11:36] receive what you have for us tonight,
[11:38] Lord. And may you move me, plum out the
[11:39] way. May the people just hear from you
[11:42] and you alone. We ask all these things
[11:44] in the most precious holy name of Jesus
[11:46] Christ. Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; All right. If we um want to turn our
[11:50] Bibles to Psalms 46.
[11:54] Let me set my timer as well.
[12:00] Say amen when you get there.
[12:12] All right. So it says, "God is our
[12:15] refuge in strength, a very present help
[12:19] in trouble. Therefore will we not fear,
[12:22] though the earth be removed, and though
[12:24] the mountains be carried into the midst
[12:26] of the sea, though the waters therefore
[12:29] roar and be troubled, though the
[12:31] mountains shake with the swelling
[12:33] thereof. Salah, there is a river, the
[12:36] streams whereof shall make glad the city
[12:38] of God, the holy place of the
[12:40] tabernacles of the most high. God is in
[12:43] the midst of her. She shall not be
[12:45] moved. God shall help her that right and
[12:48] early. The heathen raged and the
[12:50] kingdoms were moved. He uttered his
[12:52] voice, the earth melted. The Lord of
[12:55] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[12:57] our refuge. Shalah. Come behold the
[13:00] works of the Lord. What desolations he
[13:02] hath made in the earth. He maketh wars
[13:04] to cease unto the end of the earth. He
[13:06] breakth the bow and cutth the spear and
[13:08] a sunder. He burneth a chariot in the
[13:10] fire. Be still and know that I am God. I
[13:13] will be exalted among the heathen. I'll
[13:16] be exalted in the earth. The Lord of
[13:18] hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is
[13:20] our refuge. Shalah. You may be seated.
[13:25] So, the the title of this sermon is
[13:27] though the oceans may roar. So, I was
[13:31] going to Michigan a couple weeks ago.
[13:32] So, I was listening to uh sister
[13:34] Rebecca's song and uh that that that
[13:38] word when she said though the oceans may
[13:40] roar this struck me and the Lord began
[13:42] to give me inspiration and this is how
[13:44] this sermon uh came to birth because of
[13:47] that. So that that um I'll definitely
[13:50] say that uh the two albums that have
[13:52] been released sister uh Rebecca's and
[13:54] brother Jack have been a real blessing
[13:56] to me uh strength giving. I I just love,
[13:59] you know, because sometimes we listen
[14:01] to, you know, songs, uh, Maverick City
[14:03] and all them, you don't know exactly
[14:05] what their life is,
[14:06] &gt;&gt; but when you know the individuals
[14:09] personally, you know, their life, so you
[14:10] can have confidence that that that that
[14:12] they're they're uh living a life compar
[14:14] compared to, you know, the other uh we
[14:17] could say the other music out there. So,
[14:19] um, I looked up the word uh roar. So, it
[14:23] means to cause a loud continued sound.
[14:26] We may uh we say the sea or the winds
[14:28] roar, a company roar and acclamation. So
[14:31] I just think that uh in the season of
[14:33] restoration and overflow, the enemy is
[14:36] going to try to make the oceans roar.
[14:38] He's going to try to get get you to get
[14:40] your eyes off of um the season of
[14:43] restoration and overflow. He's going to
[14:45] put things in your life that it's going
[14:47] to cause uh surprise, heartaches,
[14:50] whatever it may be, because he doesn't
[14:52] want to see you get in the channel of
[14:54] restoration, overflow, because he knows
[14:56] when you get in that channel, he's going
[14:58] to be defeated. So, that's why we have
[15:00] to keep our when the oceans are roared,
[15:01] we know that we're in the will of God
[15:03] because he even said in uh Peter, I'm
[15:06] getting ahead of myself. Don't think it
[15:08] strange about these fiery trials that
[15:10] they're come for a reason. They're come
[15:12] to perfect you because God is calling us
[15:14] to perfection in this day and age. And
[15:16] restoration is going to help us get to
[15:18] that perfection in our life because when
[15:20] when when Jesus died on the cross, he
[15:22] saw us in a perfect image. So God is
[15:25] trying to get us to that perfect image
[15:27] trial after trial, step by step. And so
[15:30] we don't have to worry because we know
[15:32] that the God of the the God of hosts is
[15:34] with us.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; All right. So I I want to as I was
[15:37] reading this scripture, some things uh
[15:39] really point out to me. So the first
[15:42] thing we see is therefore will not we
[15:44] fear. So I love that the confidence
[15:46] right there. Though the earth be
[15:48] removed, the mountains be carried into
[15:51] the midst of the sea. Number two. Number
[15:52] three, though the waters therefore roar
[15:54] and be troubled, though the mountains
[15:57] shake with the welling thereof. Then he
[15:59] says salah. So all these things are
[16:01] going on at once. But I love how uh
[16:04] David started off. The first thing he
[16:06] said was God is our refuge and strength.
[16:10] a very present help in trouble. So it
[16:12] doesn't matter if all these things are
[16:14] going on because we have God who's our
[16:17] refuge and strength and a very present
[16:19] help in trouble. So what do we have to
[16:21] fear? These things are going to come.
[16:23] You can't stop them from coming. They're
[16:25] going to come. But God promised to be
[16:28] with you and in you until the end of the
[16:30] world, to the end of the age.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; So we we can have confidence uh in God.
[16:35] We can have a best friend. We can have a
[16:37] wife, a husband, but they can't. They're
[16:40] going to fail you eventually because
[16:41] they're human beings. But God cannot
[16:44] fail. He will not fail. He's never lost
[16:46] a battle.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to a quote. Uh, as I
[16:51] thought of my ways, David later cried,
[16:53] I'll bind thy commandments on my
[16:55] bedpost. I'll honor thy statutes and all
[16:59] when he sees the goodness of God. But
[17:01] you know the psalmist said again that
[17:03] God is our refuge, a very present help
[17:06] in a time of trouble. So it's good to
[17:08] know God to find God. Get on speaking
[17:11] terms with him while there's nothing
[17:14] wrong. So I think human beings I think
[17:16] brother Jack brought this out a couple
[17:17] weeks ago that a lot of times people
[17:20] wait until everything's falling apart to
[17:23] talk to God. But the thing is, if you
[17:26] would talk to God, uh, it's a quote, "In
[17:28] times of peace, prepare for war."
[17:31] Because we know in times of peace that
[17:33] the enemy is plotting against you. He
[17:35] He's trying to see what he can do next.
[17:38] He's he's studying what you do every day
[17:40] so he can plot to get you. But the thing
[17:42] is, while he's doing that, make sure you
[17:45] have a close walk with God because you
[17:47] don't want to wait until everything's
[17:48] going wrong to start praying with
[17:50] desperation. When you're on the mountain
[17:52] top, pray with desperation. So you won't
[17:54] be surprised when the trial comes.
[17:56] Because a lot of times we get surprised
[17:58] because we get a little laxidasical in
[18:00] our prayer life, in our reading life, or
[18:02] whatever it may be. And then that trial
[18:03] comes and like slaps us in the face and
[18:05] we're like, why is this here? But if we
[18:07] remember what the scripture says, think
[18:08] it not strange.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; So he says, get on speaking terms with
[18:12] him while there's nothing wrong. I love
[18:14] that right there. Then in a time of
[18:15] trouble, he's a very present help in the
[18:18] time of trouble. And so, uh, I love that
[18:22] song. So, though the oceans may roar and
[18:24] the mountains be shaken, I know I'm not
[18:27] forsaken. So, I love that right there
[18:29] that I know I'm not forsaken. No matter
[18:31] how bad the devil's attacking, I know
[18:33] that I'm still not forsaken. He says,
[18:36] she says, every step that I take, not
[18:39] not some steps, but every step that I
[18:41] take.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; No, I don't have to worry. He says, "I
[18:45] know your hand will guide me because you
[18:48] are with me."
[18:50] &gt;&gt; So, I love that right there. That gives
[18:51] the believer confidence. Maybe not the
[18:54] nominal believer, but the the believer,
[18:56] you get confidence right there that you
[18:58] know that you're not forsaken because
[19:00] you are his own. Your name is written in
[19:01] the palm of his hands. So, you know that
[19:04] you're not forsaken.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; So, the thing is, it's not our job to
[19:07] try to figure out why we're in a trial
[19:09] or why this has happened. Our job is
[19:11] just to trust.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; It says be still. Just trust and be
[19:14] still. That's all you have to do. It's
[19:16] not our job to try to rec it's all our
[19:18] job is just to recognize that God is our
[19:20] refuge and strength and a very present
[19:23] help. And it's our job to trust him and
[19:25] knows that as brother Marqueis said, he
[19:27] has a plan for your life.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to try to formulate a
[19:30] plan and do this and do that. God knows
[19:33] you have you have uh goals and desires
[19:35] and a future plan and he loves that. But
[19:38] the thing is, you want to make sure that
[19:39] your mind isn't just set on what you
[19:42] want, but what God wants. Because
[19:44] sometimes we can get caught up in things
[19:46] that we we want to do this, but we
[19:47] haven't checked to see if God wants it
[19:49] for our life. Because something can be
[19:51] good right now, but be a hindrance later
[19:53] down the road, 6 months, a year down the
[19:55] road. So that's why it's very important
[19:57] to be on speaking terms with God so he
[19:59] can lead and guide you into what he
[20:02] needs you to be in because he wants to
[20:03] use you in different uh we can say
[20:06] different social circles at your job
[20:08] whatever it may be because there's
[20:10] places that you can't reach and I can't
[20:11] reach that somebody else can reach
[20:13] though. So that's why God wants to use
[20:15] you to to uh give himself glory.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; So let's go to Romans chapter 8.
[20:22] This is probably a very familiar
[20:23] scripture. We probably read it many,
[20:25] many times over the years, but I think
[20:28] it's a very fitting scripture.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; So, we'll go to Romans 8 and we'll start
[20:33] with verse 35.
[20:37] So, it says, "Who shall separate us from
[20:40] the love of Christ?" He's asking a
[20:41] question. So, who shall separate us from
[20:44] the love of Christ? And he gives this,
[20:46] he poses this. shall tribulation or
[20:49] distress, persecution, famine,
[20:52] nakedness, parel or sword. And I'm I'm
[20:56] going to give some definitions. So
[20:57] tribulation is severe affliction,
[20:59] distress of life, vexations in
[21:01] scripture. It often denotes the troubles
[21:04] and distresses which proceed from
[21:06] persecution. Now distress means extreme
[21:09] pain and anguish of body or mind as to
[21:12] suffer great distress from the gout or
[21:14] from the loss of near friends. Also it
[21:17] means affliction, calamity, misery, a
[21:20] state of danger as a ship in distress
[21:22] from leaking loss of spars of want to to
[21:26] afflict with pain, anguish or applied to
[21:28] the body or mind. Persecution, the act
[21:31] of of practice of persecuting, the
[21:33] infliction of pain, punishment, death
[21:35] upon others unjustly, particularly for
[21:37] adhering to a religious creed or mode of
[21:40] worship either by way of penalty for
[21:42] compelling them to renounce their
[21:44] principles. Now, famine is a scarcity of
[21:47] food. That's one thing I'll say in
[21:48] America, we don't have to worry about
[21:51] compared to other countries because we
[21:54] there's so much food that we waste food.
[21:56] Uh many I see many people waste food and
[21:59] this and that, but other countries that
[22:01] are aren't as well fortunate us, they
[22:03] experience these things. So, we can be
[22:05] thankful that we aren't experiences
[22:07] naturally, I should say. Sometimes
[22:09] spiritually we can exper experience
[22:11] famine because we're not uh putting our
[22:13] foot to the gas with our walk with God
[22:16] because sometimes when we get blessings
[22:17] we we we we decide to lax off that
[22:20] sometimes that's human nature but we
[22:22] have to override human nature because we
[22:25] know we operate by the eyes of faith and
[22:27] what's inside of us because God is
[22:29] always going to call you to a higher
[22:31] plane a higher level because he wants to
[22:34] use you in a in a deeper way in a more
[22:36] personal way. So the more intimate we
[22:38] get with him, the more he can use us to
[22:41] um expound his glory so others can see
[22:44] him and him alone.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So nakedness is one of means of defense
[22:49] and parel was danger, risk of hazard,
[22:51] jeopardy, uh peculiar exposure of person
[22:54] or property, injury, loss or
[22:56] destruction. So now these are some some
[22:58] hefty things he's mentioning. He says
[23:00] tribulation, distress, persecution,
[23:02] famine, nakedness, parel or sword. These
[23:04] are some some real life things. As it is
[23:07] written, for thy sake we are killed all
[23:09] the day long. We are counted as sheep
[23:11] for the slaughter. But I love what he
[23:13] says right here. Nay, in all these
[23:16] things we are more than conquerors
[23:18] through him that loved us. So he
[23:20] mentioned all these things, but there's
[23:21] these are no excuses why we still cannot
[23:24] be conquerors. Because if Jesus died and
[23:27] rose again, then we are conquerors. We
[23:30] are overcomers. So there's nothing that
[23:32] the enemy can put in our pl in our way
[23:35] that we can't overcome because it's the
[23:37] overcoming living inside of you doing
[23:39] the overcoming. But he can't overcome if
[23:41] you don't let him overcome inside of
[23:42] you. So it's surrender. You have to
[23:45] surrender to win every battle
[23:47] &gt;&gt; because God expects us to be victorious
[23:49] in every trial. If we're not victorious,
[23:51] then we miss something. We took our eyes
[23:53] off of him.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; So it says, "For I am persuaded that
[23:56] neither he's given more things. For I'm
[23:58] beside neither death, nor life, nor
[24:01] angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[24:04] nor things present, nor things to come.
[24:06] So, I love that part right there. Nor
[24:08] trials to come, nor obstacles to come.
[24:12] There's nothing that can stop you from
[24:13] reaching the perfection that God has
[24:15] called you to. He He's leading you with
[24:18] his mighty hand as he led the children
[24:19] of Israel. All we have to do is have
[24:22] faith. The only thing they lacked was
[24:24] faith. And that's why they missed it.
[24:25] God I'm getting ahead of myself. All
[24:27] right.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; God literally showed them and told them
[24:30] what he would do to get them to the
[24:32] promised land. But still they they mixed
[24:34] unbelief instead of faith. And they were
[24:36] constantly murmuring and complaining the
[24:39] whole God was faithful the whole entire
[24:41] time. Mana raining down from the heaven.
[24:44] Um a brazen serpent. Uh we got water
[24:47] from a rock. Like what more do you need?
[24:49] Like what more can you need? God
[24:51] literally plagues in Egypt. Uh I'm
[24:54] getting ahead of myself again. opened
[24:55] the Red Sea and parted it. So what more
[24:58] do you need? Like like God literally
[25:00] like he babyed them. We could say every
[25:02] time they would murmur, complain, he'll
[25:03] give another chance. Give him another
[25:04] chance. But yet they still missed it.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Let's keep it going. So nor height nor
[25:10] depth or any other creature shall be
[25:11] able to separate us from the love of God
[25:13] which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. So
[25:15] I'll say this. We have no excuse. We
[25:17] cannot make no excuse because the Bible
[25:19] tells us that there's nothing that can
[25:21] separate us from the love of Christ. So
[25:23] we should let none of these things
[25:25] separate us from the love of Christ. So
[25:27] God doesn't want to hear my excuse. He
[25:29] doesn't want to hear your excuse. So So
[25:31] he didn't want to hear the children is
[25:32] your excuse. So the thing is sometimes
[25:34] we can make excuses sound so good to
[25:36] oursel. We can trick our own selves by
[25:38] making such a good excuse.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; But the thing is you can't trick God.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; So don't make an excuse. Just like Nike
[25:45] says, just do it. Literally just do it.
[25:49] So these things that we go through, they
[25:52] make us more like him. They in fact they
[25:54] increase your faith. They in fact they
[25:56] they they build the the perfect statue
[25:57] of a man in you. So you got that faith.
[25:59] You got you got longsuffering, love, all
[26:01] these things that God is trying to build
[26:03] a a building inside of you, a pyramid,
[26:05] we could say. And let's go to um Romans
[26:08] 8:28. So we know that all things work
[26:11] together for the good to them that love
[26:13] God and who are called according to his
[26:16] purpose. I'm believe I'm believing
[26:17] tonight that I'm talking to everybody
[26:19] who's called according to his purpose.
[26:21] So, if you're called according to his
[26:23] purpose, it says all things work
[26:25] together for the good of them that love
[26:27] God. So, it may seem like everything is
[26:30] going wrong, but guess what? He's going
[26:32] to make all things work together for
[26:34] your good and my good. So, we can have
[26:37] faith as we're walking down this path
[26:39] that you're going the right way. Because
[26:41] if everything's going wrong and like
[26:43] like the enemy is attacking that that
[26:45] means you know that you're in the right
[26:46] place. If he's not attacking then you
[26:49] better worry.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go to First Peter 4:12 or 1 Peter.
[26:54] Yeah. Chapter 4:12 and we'll read um
[26:57] we'll read actually we'll read seven
[26:59] verses there actually. I know I said um
[27:02] let me get there.
[27:09] Okay. Chapter 4 and we'll read verses.
[27:13] All right. Beloved, think it not strange
[27:16] concerning the fire trial which is to
[27:18] try you as though some strange thing has
[27:21] happened. I want you to know it says
[27:22] fiery trial.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; So one thing I want to point out in
[27:26] order to be an overcomer there has to be
[27:29] something that you have to overcome.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; The Christian walk isn't a a walk of
[27:33] just ease and and laziness. But you be
[27:36] an overcomer. Something has to be in
[27:39] your way to you to overcome it. An
[27:41] obstacle has to be there. So don't think
[27:44] it's strange. Any battle, any war that
[27:46] was won, there was an obstacle. There
[27:48] was an enemy they had to fight. In fact,
[27:50] there was battles, there was wars. And
[27:52] so the thing is, don't think it, don't
[27:53] be surprised when the things come. Just
[27:56] just be thankful that you can be in a
[27:58] fiery trial because that means God sees
[28:01] something that he wants to perfect in
[28:03] you. So a lot of people, a lot of
[28:05] Christians, they don't even even pay
[28:07] attention. They just go to church and
[28:09] then do their thing on the weekday, come
[28:10] back to church, and they just leave God
[28:12] here. They don't take God, they don't
[28:14] take them with him. So the thing is, God
[28:15] wants you to take him with him wherever
[28:17] you go.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; But rejoice in so much as you are
[28:20] partakers of Christ's sufferings that
[28:23] when his glory shall be revealed, you
[28:25] may be glad also with exceeding joy. If
[28:29] you be reproached for the name of
[28:30] Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of
[28:32] glory of God restth upon you. Um, on
[28:36] their part, evil is spoken of, but your
[28:38] part, he is glorified. But it says, "But
[28:42] let none of you suffer as a murderer or
[28:43] as a thief or as an evildoer or as a
[28:45] busy body in other men's matters. Yet if
[28:47] any man suffer as a Christian, let him
[28:50] not be ashamed, but let him glorify God
[28:53] on this behalf. For the time has come
[28:55] that judgment must begin at the house of
[28:57] God. And if it first begin at us, what
[28:59] shall the end of them that obey not the
[29:01] gospel of God? If the righteously
[29:04] scarcely be, think about that. If the
[29:06] righteous scarcely be saved, where shall
[29:09] the ungodly and the sinner appear? So,
[29:12] it really shows me that it's none of my
[29:14] merits, not how good I can be, not how
[29:16] good I am, but it's what Christ has
[29:18] done. Because I think the Bible even
[29:20] says, even at your best, it's like a
[29:21] dirty rag. So, it shows us that we we we
[29:23] we can't think that we've done
[29:25] something. is what the finished product
[29:27] of what God has done. So that's why
[29:30] we're here today standing because of his
[29:31] grace and mercy. Wherefore let them
[29:34] suffer according to the will of God
[29:36] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[29:38] in the welloing as unto faith their
[29:40] creator. Let's go to um quote now the
[29:43] resurrection of Lazarus. He got sick and
[29:46] sometimes God tries your faith. Do you
[29:50] believe that? He says every son that
[29:52] cometh to God must be tried. Think it
[29:55] not strange that the fiery trials come
[29:58] because it's only done to perfect your
[30:02] faith. And guess what else? And draw you
[30:05] closer. They're worth more than gold to
[30:08] you. All right. The prophet just just
[30:10] reminding us why we go through these
[30:12] trials. So we wonder why brother Brandon
[30:13] went through some some of these things
[30:15] he went through. It was for a perfect
[30:17] plan, a perfect purpose so more of God
[30:19] could be inside of him.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Exodus um chapter 14. We're
[30:24] not going to read all these verses. I
[30:25] know just for the sake of time, but
[30:28] we'll go to um to the Red Sea Showdown,
[30:31] we can call it. And we go to Exodus 14
[30:34] and we'll read um I kind of skip around
[30:36] a little bit, but
[30:39] sometimes when your Bible's falling
[30:40] apart, is it's falling last.
[30:45] A little hard to turn sometimes.
[30:48] I think I glued it like two times
[30:50] already in my life.
[30:53] So, Exodus 14, we'll go to verse 9. So,
[30:56] in the Bible reads,
[30:59] "But the Egyptians pursued after them
[31:01] all the horses and the chariots of
[31:02] Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army
[31:04] and overtook them, encamping them by the
[31:07] sea beside Pitup and before Balisan."
[31:10] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children
[31:12] of Israel lifted up their eyes, and
[31:14] behold, the Egyptians marched after
[31:16] them. They were so afraid, and the
[31:17] children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
[31:19] So, I wanted to stop right there real
[31:21] quick. Actually, we go back to verse
[31:22] one. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[31:24] saying, speak unto the children of
[31:26] Israel that they turn and encamp before
[31:28] Philip between Maggra and the sea over
[31:31] against Balazafon before it shall encamp
[31:34] by the sea. For Pharaoh will say the
[31:36] children of Israel, they are tangled in
[31:37] the land, the wilderness, and has shut
[31:39] them up. So God is telling Moses to
[31:41] speak to the children of Israel to move.
[31:44] And so I think of like this as we're
[31:46] getting down to here, you're going to
[31:47] hear the children of Israel complain,
[31:49] "Oh, we should have stayed in Egypt and
[31:50] this and that." But you guys literally
[31:52] were crying for deliverance. Literally
[31:56] the taskmaster. So the very thing that
[31:58] you prayed for has got answered and now
[32:00] you're complaining because God had
[32:02] answered the prayer. To me, that that
[32:03] that literally logically makes no sense
[32:05] if you look at a logical standpoint. So
[32:07] the very thing you literally if you were
[32:09] crying out to God, it was something that
[32:11] was that was really tasking to you
[32:13] mentally, physically and fe and
[32:15] spiritually. Let's keep going. Verse 11.
[32:17] And he said unto Moses, because there
[32:19] were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken
[32:22] us away to die in the wilderness?
[32:24] Wherefore hast thou dealt us with us to
[32:26] carry us forth out of Egypt? So the
[32:28] thing is if if they if they knew God can
[32:31] do these things in Egypt then this
[32:34] little situation was it hard was it hard
[32:37] for God to handle. So the thing is if
[32:39] God kill the firstborn of the Egyptians
[32:41] um flies locust and all these things and
[32:44] there was only light in goan no light in
[32:46] Egypt. So if God can do all those things
[32:48] then what this little trial
[32:51] &gt;&gt; can can God not do it? Can God not if
[32:53] God could be with us who if God if God
[32:55] is for us who could be against us? So
[32:57] the thing is, but we see that they had
[32:59] the same type of attitude. So I can see
[33:01] why God looks at the attitude. It's the
[33:03] right mental attitude as the prophet
[33:05] said that brings any divine promise to
[33:07] God to pass. So let's go to verse 12. Is
[33:09] not this the word that we did tell thee
[33:11] in Egypt saying, "Let us alone." So I
[33:13] want you to notice they never apologized
[33:15] to God for saying that. He delivered
[33:17] them and they never repented and said,
[33:19] "Oh Lord, I'm sorry." But yet they kept
[33:20] doing it over and over and over and over
[33:24] again.
[33:25] Let let us alone that we may serve the
[33:27] Egyptians, for it been better for us to
[33:28] serve the Egyptians than that we should
[33:30] die in the wilderness. And Moses said
[33:33] unto the people, "Fear ye not. Stand
[33:36] still and see the salvation of the Lord,
[33:39] which he will show you today. For the
[33:40] Egyptians whom you have seen today, you
[33:42] shall see them again no more forever."
[33:46] &gt;&gt; I love verse 14 right here. The Lord
[33:49] shall fight for you and you shall hold
[33:51] your peace. So thing is sometimes we we
[33:54] get so overwhelmed and so stressed out
[33:57] because we're trying to do God's job.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; God never called you to do his job. God
[34:02] told you to be still. Um even Paul said
[34:06] that that we got to be in perfect rest.
[34:07] We got to be in that rest that the Holy
[34:09] Ghost is rest. So the thing is we try to
[34:12] figure everything out, formulate
[34:13] everything, plan this out, do this and
[34:15] do that. But God God wants to fight for
[34:17] you.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; God God knows how you're going to win
[34:20] this battle. God knows how you're going
[34:22] to get this victory. So just trust in
[34:24] him. Let him do the fighting. You play
[34:26] your part. Hitting your knees. Read your
[34:28] word.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; Speak in faith. Move in faith. And then
[34:32] let and watch God uh show up. If we
[34:34] could say that. Watch God do his thing.
[34:36] Watch God hit a home run,
[34:38] &gt;&gt; hit a buzzer beat or whatever, whatever
[34:40] you want, however analogy you want to
[34:41] hit.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; So let's keep going. We'll go to verse
[34:44] um 15. And the Lord shall say unto
[34:46] Moses, wherefore Christ thou unto me?
[34:49] So, I think sometimes in situations we
[34:52] it's a time to cry because we know in
[34:54] Ecclesiastes 3, it's a time to cry. But
[34:56] I think a lot of times we we kind of
[34:59] doubt the God inside of us.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Speak the word and move in faith. That's
[35:04] what that's what that's what God was
[35:06] trying to tell Moses because he he said,
[35:08] "I'm in I'm with you." And so he's I'm a
[35:12] prophet and obviously we're not
[35:13] prophets, but we have God living inside
[35:15] of us. So we have the word living right
[35:17] inside of us. We I think sometimes we're
[35:20] scared just to speak.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Speak the word. If you're reading in the
[35:23] word, then you have authority because
[35:26] Christ has given you authority to change
[35:28] atmospheres, to change situations. So
[35:31] speak it into existence. Don't be
[35:32] scared. Like that song says, "Speak."
[35:34] Just speak. And so we we see that um
[35:37] verse 15, it says, "And the Lord said
[35:39] unto Moses, wherefore Christ unto me,
[35:42] speak unto the children of Israel that
[35:44] they go forward." So, we're in a season
[35:46] of restoration and overflow. Speak and
[35:49] move forward. Maybe your business isn't
[35:51] doing as well as you wanted to. Speak.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; May maybe your spiritual walk isn't
[35:56] doing as you could want to. Speak.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe your family members aren't here
[36:00] yet. Speak.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; God wants to hear you speak. God loves
[36:05] to be reminded of his word. Just speak
[36:07] it. Speak it out to him. He loves to
[36:09] hear his children repeat his word back
[36:12] to him. Verse 16. But lift thou up thy
[36:16] rod, and stretch out thy hand over the
[36:18] sea, and divide it, and the children of
[36:20] Asia shall go on dry land in the midst
[36:22] of the sea. And I, behold, I will harden
[36:24] the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
[36:25] shall follow them, and I will give me
[36:27] honor upon the host and upon his
[36:29] chariots. Let's skip down to verse 20.
[36:31] And it came to pass between the
[36:32] Egyptians and the camp of Israel. It was
[36:34] a cloud in darkness to them, but it gave
[36:36] light by night to these. So the one came
[36:39] not near the other night. And Moses
[36:41] stretched out his hand over the sea. And
[36:43] the Lord caused the sea to go back and
[36:45] forth in a strong wind. By night, let's
[36:46] go to verse 23. And the Egyptians
[36:49] pursued and went after them to the midst
[36:51] of the sea. Even Pharaoh's horses and
[36:52] chariots and his horsemen. And it came
[36:54] to pass in the morning watch. The Lord
[36:56] looked unto the host of the Egyptians
[36:58] through the pillar of fire of the clouds
[37:00] troubled the host of the Egyptians, and
[37:02] took off their chariot wheels that they
[37:04] drove them heavily. So that the
[37:05] Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the
[37:07] face of Israel, for the Lord fightth for
[37:10] them against the Egyptians." So even the
[37:13] Egyptians re realized that God fought
[37:16] for them.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; So even your enemies are going to
[37:18] realize that God is going to fight for
[37:20] you.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And to me, that brings me so much
[37:24] assurance and so much peace in my life
[37:27] that I know that God cares so much for
[37:29] me. He's willing to fight for me.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; He's willing to help me get the victory.
[37:34] Let's um and the Lord said unto Moses,
[37:37] "Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and
[37:38] the waters may come again of the
[37:40] Egyptians, upon the chariots, upon their
[37:41] horses." And Moses stretched out his
[37:43] hand over the sea, and the sea turned to
[37:45] his strength, and the morning appeared,
[37:46] and the Egyptians fled against it, and
[37:48] overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
[37:50] the sea. I want you also notice that
[37:51] there was not one person left from the
[37:55] Egyptian camp that came after them. Not
[37:57] one. God said there not be one. So look
[37:59] at that. He killed every enemy. So
[38:02] sometimes there might be Sauls in your
[38:04] workplace and many things I remember
[38:05] brother Jack said that he said let God
[38:08] kill Saul.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Don't you try to do it. Don't you try to
[38:11] let God do it.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; He'll have to leave get a new job
[38:15] whatever it is or be your friend
[38:16] whatever it may be.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; So let's let's read a quote from proving
[38:20] his word. It was said one time that
[38:22] Israel was walking in the line of duty.
[38:24] The walking in the line of duty to a
[38:27] promised land. So I believe we're
[38:28] walking in the line of duty to the
[38:30] rapture
[38:31] &gt;&gt; and right in the line of duty, the the
[38:33] enemy come and them up in the corner and
[38:36] the Red Sea cut them off from the line
[38:37] of duty in their march and God looked
[38:40] down from their heaven. So when they hit
[38:41] the Red Sea, that didn't surprise God.
[38:43] He was like, I knew it was going to be
[38:44] there.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Um in their line of march and God looked
[38:48] down from heaven through the pillar of
[38:50] fire and the sea got scared. I love that
[38:53] it rolled back his waves because God's
[38:55] waves was in the bottom of the sea and
[38:57] it made a way for his children walking
[38:59] in the line of obedience. So if you're
[39:02] walking in the line of obedience, God is
[39:04] obligated to fight your battle
[39:06] &gt;&gt; because you're you're getting in step
[39:07] with the word. If you're in step with
[39:09] the word, then God is obligated by his
[39:11] word to fight your battles.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; So you have nothing to worry if you're
[39:15] ob. Now if you're not in obedience, then
[39:17] you might have to worry a little bit.
[39:18] But if you're in obedience and in line
[39:20] and in step, then you can have
[39:21] confidence and faith that God is going
[39:23] to fight
[39:24] &gt;&gt; for you.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Now God, if the Red Sea would get scared
[39:28] and roll back his waves, roll back its
[39:30] waters and give a place to journeying
[39:32] children march in obedience. Dear God,
[39:34] tonight look down through the blood of
[39:35] your son Jesus who made the promise when
[39:38] these handkerchiefs placed upon the sick
[39:39] bodies of people. May the eyes of God
[39:42] look and may the sickness that the devil
[39:44] be scared and move away. May the people
[39:47] keep their journey to the promised land
[39:49] with good health and strength. As Israel
[39:51] marched through the wilderness, there
[39:52] wasn't one feeble person among them as
[39:55] the other end. May it be granted for
[39:57] these people, Father, for we send these
[39:59] handkerchiefs in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:00] Amen. Read one more quote. Now, you
[40:03] remember he had already prophesied for
[40:05] he said, "These Egyptians that you see
[40:07] today, you'll see no more." And then
[40:09] immediately he began to cry out, "God,
[40:11] what can we do?" See, after he done a
[40:13] pretty good job in prophesying there,
[40:15] you see, he done told them what would
[40:17] happen. If the word of God was in him,
[40:19] it was in him.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And when he was telling that it actually
[40:21] come to pass, when he said was already
[40:23] going to come to pass here, he was
[40:25] crying out, "What am I going to do?" Oh,
[40:27] if that isn't human beings, if that
[40:29] isn't me, if that isn't me, see, he
[40:31] already proved what he said was going to
[40:33] happen. I think sometimes, getting ahead
[40:35] of myself again, that we I look at
[40:38] David. David didn't have the Holy Ghost,
[40:40] but yet he could look back and see God
[40:43] gave me the strength to kill this lion
[40:44] and his bear. And this Goliath, he he's
[40:49] he a he knew nothing either because he's
[40:51] he's in the line because David's in the
[40:53] line of obedience. So if he's in a line
[40:55] of obedience, he can have confidence
[40:56] that this uncircumcised Philistine won't
[40:58] stand. So I think sometimes we forget
[41:00] what God has done in the past.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; But thing, David didn't have the Holy
[41:04] Ghost. We have the Holy Ghost. So we got
[41:06] authority and power living inside of us.
[41:08] So we can look back and see what God has
[41:10] done as well and have a victory just
[41:12] like he had a victory. He had three
[41:14] victories. Victory, victory, victory. We
[41:16] can do the same thing.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said we live a million
[41:19] miles below our privilege.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; He didn't say a thousand. He said a
[41:23] million miles. So God expects these
[41:26] things to happen. God expects
[41:28] testimonies of victory. He expects
[41:30] spiritual blessing. All these things he
[41:31] expects us to have. But we have to be
[41:33] the one feeding upon him to get these
[41:35] victories.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; I lost my train. Where am I at now?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; And um let's see. Uh in Okay. And here a
[41:44] circumcis a circumstance rose in a
[41:46] moment. What I must do? What I must do,
[41:47] Lord? I think we getting that, too. Hey,
[41:49] Lord, where you at? Hey, do you hear me?
[41:51] What must I do? He had already ordained
[41:53] him and vindicated him and pro. I think
[41:55] sometimes we're scared to to speak the
[41:58] word.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; And God want God wants to see, are you
[42:02] really believing and trusting me? Speak
[42:04] the word. I placed inside of you. to use
[42:07] it and he had already ordained him and
[42:09] vindicated him and proved worked
[42:11] everything through him and here God oh
[42:13] my fully expressing men wants to rest
[42:15] and let God do the pushing. Wow. All
[42:18] right. So and yet he knew that God had
[42:20] anointed him for the job to do this and
[42:23] God had clearly vindicated his claims.
[42:25] It was time for the people to be
[42:26] delivered. God through his miracles,
[42:28] wonders had drawn them all together in
[42:30] one group. You follow me? Brought them
[42:31] all together in one group. Vindicated
[42:33] his claims. Scripture said so. Here,
[42:35] here was the sign. Here was the
[42:37] evidence. Here everything had said. So I
[42:39] look in the season of restoration. We
[42:41] have evidence. How many people have
[42:43] testified of God restoring, God
[42:46] overflowing their business. So the these
[42:49] are for all of us. We can all experience
[42:51] these things. Like I said before, in our
[42:53] business, in our walk, in our families,
[42:54] these things, God is still God is still
[42:57] in the throne.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; God is still God over everything. So
[43:00] these things are are at our fingertips
[43:02] to grasp. there as much as you uh God
[43:05] God is much you you can't exhaust God.
[43:07] You can't exhaust him. He's like an
[43:09] ocean. You can't exhaust him. Don't be
[43:10] scared. Oh God, I need this. No. Speak.
[43:13] Open your mouth up. Ask big things. Ask
[43:16] small things. Ask medium things. Just be
[43:18] ask. I think sometimes we're scared to
[43:20] ask and God want it's like like a little
[43:23] kid. You know they want something.
[43:24] You're just waiting for them to ask.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; And same thing with guys is waiting for
[43:28] you to ask.
[43:30] Um
[43:31] but uh paragraph 2:10, but he wanted to
[43:34] wait on thus sayith the Lord. He should
[43:35] have known that the very vindication of
[43:38] his call was thus sayeth the Lord. Wow.
[43:41] His job that he was ordained to was thus
[43:44] sayeth the Lord. Can you get it? Why?
[43:46] Why he didn't wait on thus sayith the
[43:48] Lord? So the the Bible tells us that
[43:50] that he chose us. That's thus sayeth the
[43:52] Lord, right? He he chose you. He called
[43:55] you by name. So we can have confidence
[43:57] that if he called you and chose you that
[44:00] the word is living inside of you.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; We read one more quote. Um and we'll go
[44:04] to Joshua 10. Um Joshua Joshua 1. I'm
[44:08] sorry. We go to Joshua 1 actually. I
[44:09] know it says 10 on there. We go to
[44:10] Joshua 1. And God wanted Moses to have
[44:12] faith that he put put in him and the
[44:14] gift that he had clearly a vindicated.
[44:16] God had clearly proved to Moses that the
[44:19] that it was him by the word and by the
[44:21] things that he was said to come to pass.
[44:23] It was clearly identified. There was no
[44:25] need of him worrying anymore about it.
[44:27] See, there was no more of him thinking
[44:28] about anything about it because it was
[44:30] already cleared up. He had already done
[44:32] these things. He had already proved by
[44:34] by by flies and fleas that spoken to
[44:36] creation that the word of God was in
[44:38] him. Let's go to Joshua um chapter one.
[44:50] See, let me get there myself.
[44:53] All right. All right. So, Joshua chapter
[44:54] 1, very familiar scripture. We've all
[44:56] read this many times, but I believe it's
[45:00] still very important and very timely and
[45:02] very powerful. So, now after the death
[45:04] of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it
[45:06] came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[45:08] Joshua, saying, "The son of Moses, the
[45:10] minister, saying, so we know the prophet
[45:12] has left the scene, but yet the word is
[45:15] still here. It's still vindicated. So,
[45:17] we have to carry the torch. We have to
[45:19] bring the message to others. We have to
[45:21] because brother Brandham, he called us.
[45:24] He he told us that is Jesus Christ the
[45:27] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[45:29] if it was Jesus with the children of
[45:31] Israel, he's still Jesus with you today.
[45:33] So he's still doing these things. He's
[45:35] still partnering the Red Sea. He's doing
[45:36] all these things still. He's still
[45:38] giving you strength to kill Goliath in
[45:39] your life because there's Goliath.
[45:40] There's going to be Goliath in your
[45:41] life. And you and God is giving you the
[45:44] strength and authority to to to conquer
[45:46] these giants in your life. So Moses, my
[45:49] servant, is dead. Now therefore arise,
[45:51] go over this Jordan and all the people
[45:53] into the land which I do give thee, even
[45:55] to the children of Israel. Because in
[45:58] the children of Israel, they experience
[45:59] overflow in that land. It says
[46:00] overflowing with milk and honey. And so
[46:03] I believe God is calling us to a a
[46:04] spiritual promised land, which is the
[46:06] Holy Ghost as we know. And and there's
[46:08] going to be overflow
[46:10] &gt;&gt; overflow of the your cup overflowing
[46:13] spiritually. You're going to see your
[46:14] business overflowing where you don't
[46:16] even know what to do. You got so much
[46:17] work. You're going to see your family
[46:19] members overflowing in the seats. You
[46:21] you going to see it cuz God God knows
[46:24] what you've been praying for on your
[46:25] knees. And he's going to answer in the
[46:27] perfect time and in due season.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Every place that the soul of your foot
[46:32] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[46:35] you as I said unto Moses. He's speaking
[46:37] that to you personally as well. He may
[46:38] be speaking that to them in that time,
[46:40] but I can see myself in here. I can see
[46:42] you guys in here as well. Amen.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; From the wilderness and thus the Lebanon
[46:46] even to the great river, the river
[46:48] Euphrates, and all the land, the high
[46:50] tites, unto the great sea, toward the
[46:51] going down of the sun, shall be your
[46:54] coast. There shall not any man be able
[46:57] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[47:00] life. So we could literally dovetail
[47:01] that with Romans chapter 8:35 through
[47:04] 39. Um, all the days as I was with
[47:07] Moses, so I will be with thee. Look,
[47:10] check. I will not fail thee nor forsake
[47:14] thee. I love that right there. Let's
[47:16] keep going. It says, "Be strong and of
[47:18] good courage, for unto the people shalt
[47:20] thou divide for inheritance of the land
[47:22] which I swear unto their their fathers
[47:24] to give them. Only be thou strong and
[47:28] very courageous, that thou mayest
[47:30] observe to do according to all the law
[47:33] which Moses my servant commanded thee."
[47:35] So I see God is really trying to stress
[47:38] obedience.
[47:40] Obedience is greater than sacrifice. So
[47:42] turn not from it to the right hand to
[47:44] the left, but stay right in the middle.
[47:46] That thou mayest prosper whatsoever thou
[47:50] goest. Right? That's the key to prosper
[47:52] whatsoever thou goest. We can go to
[47:54] Psalms one as well. I don't go to but
[47:56] Psalms 1 says the same thing. Whatever
[47:57] your hands touch, it'll prosper. But
[47:59] that's the key right there. That's the
[48:01] key. You got to stay faithful to the
[48:03] word.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; And if you're faithful to the word,
[48:05] you're faithful to God because God and
[48:06] his word are one and the same. You can't
[48:09] separate them.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; So the simple I guess the put in
[48:12] simplicity always keep God first.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; ABC always being in Christ is keep it
[48:17] simple as possible. This is the book of
[48:19] the law shall not depart out of thy
[48:21] mouth but thou shalt meditate there in
[48:23] day and night. Thou mayest observe to do
[48:25] according to all that is written. Not
[48:27] just some not just your favorite
[48:29] scripture but all that is written.
[48:31] Therein for then shall make the way
[48:33] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[48:35] success. So, it's giving us a formula
[48:37] how to be prosperous spiritually and
[48:38] physically. Because if you're if you're
[48:40] doing Matthew 6:33, but seek ye first
[48:43] the kingdom of God and righteousness,
[48:44] and all these things should be added
[48:45] unto you, then guess what's going to
[48:46] happen? God is going to supply all your
[48:48] needs, right down from the spiritual all
[48:50] the way down to the natural.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Overflow anything you can think of. If
[48:54] you are putting him first, he's going to
[48:56] supply everything that you need.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Because God loves to honor faithfulness.
[49:01] Just like when a when your kid when your
[49:03] son or daughter uh listens to what you
[49:05] say, does his chores, you want to bless
[49:07] him. You want to give him gifts. So the
[49:09] same thing in in God's economy, if you
[49:11] are doing everything you can to please
[49:13] God, obviously we're going to make
[49:14] mistakes. God knows that. Repent, keep
[49:17] going forward. God is going to bless you
[49:19] for that that obedience. He says, "Have
[49:22] not I commanded thee?" He knows he me he
[49:25] mentioned this many times about being
[49:27] strong and of good courage. Be strong
[49:29] and good courage. Be not afraid, neither
[49:31] be dismayed, for the Lord thy God is
[49:33] with thee, whatsoever thou goest. So
[49:35] once again, he's trying to give us he's
[49:37] trying to build our faith and boost our
[49:38] confidence that he's going to be with
[49:40] you. He's always going to be with you.
[49:42] The thing is, don't just leave him right
[49:44] there because sometimes we leave God
[49:45] back there and we wonder why we going
[49:47] through things. Same thing with Peter.
[49:49] Peter is walking on the water as long as
[49:51] he's keeping his eyes on Christ. But
[49:53] when he took his eyes off of Christ,
[49:54] that's when he began to sink. And the
[49:56] same thing in our life. Our life
[49:58] happens. We sometimes we take our eyes
[49:59] off of Christ and we wonder why we're
[50:01] sinking. Because you got to keep your
[50:03] eyes on the author and finisher, Jesus
[50:05] Christ. Because you keep your eyes on
[50:07] him, there's no enemy, no devil that can
[50:10] stop you because you got your eyes on
[50:12] your strength. Because you take your
[50:14] eyes off, you lose your Son, he cut his
[50:16] hair, lost his strength.
[50:19] Let's let's look at I want to just look
[50:20] at two verses real quick. Joshua, how we
[50:22] on time? Okay. So, let's look at Joshua
[50:24] 10:8 and Deuteronomy 24. In Deuteronomy
[50:27] 20:4, it says in Joshua 10:8, "And the
[50:30] Lord said unto Joshua, fear them not,
[50:33] for I deliver them to thy hands, and
[50:34] there shall not a man
[50:37] of them stand before thee." In
[50:38] Deuteronomy 24:4, for the Lord your God
[50:41] is he that goeth with you to fight for
[50:44] you against your enemies to save you.
[50:46] So, once again, God is trying to remind
[50:48] us that that he will go before you and
[50:51] fight for you. You don't have to try to
[50:54] do all these things and try to do this
[50:56] and do that and and talk about this
[50:58] person bad, but let God handle it. Let
[51:00] God be God. Simple as that. So, I I tell
[51:03] you, there's going to be times that the
[51:05] oceans will roar. There's going to be
[51:07] difficult times time to come. And I tell
[51:10] you, there's going to be it's going to
[51:11] feel like you're drowning sometimes.
[51:12] You're going to feel like I can't take
[51:13] another another bad news, Lord. Like
[51:16] Job. Job is just like, man, another
[51:18] piece of bad news. But I look how I love
[51:20] how Job did not curse God not one time.
[51:22] And he didn't have the Holy Ghost. Once
[51:24] again, we he didn't have the Holy Ghost
[51:25] like we did. He didn't have a group of
[51:27] believers like we did. He didn't have
[51:29] this Bible to read after to have
[51:31] encouragement and faith in a faith
[51:33] building. He didn't have none of that.
[51:34] In fact, his spouse even say you should
[51:37] curse God and die. So, he literally was
[51:39] alone. We could say he had nobody to to
[51:42] counsel him. His friends were saying,
[51:43] "You're a secret sinner." But look at
[51:45] us. We got a we got a whole community of
[51:47] of of of holy holy ghost filled
[51:49] believers to give us strength if we need
[51:51] it. And we got we got a we have a
[51:53] message of the hour. I can keep on going
[51:55] the resources we got.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't have he didn't have no iPod,
[51:59] no no iPod Nano, no nothing. No MP3, no
[52:02] CD player, nothing.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; He had he literally had to rely on God.
[52:06] And I was listening to the prophet maybe
[52:09] couple weeks ago this sermon he was
[52:10] mentioned. He was saying that it was a
[52:12] very common occurrence for people to
[52:14] meet with God. He said he was even in
[52:16] the camp of the Philistines at one point
[52:18] when I believe um when Abraham lied to
[52:21] that king and said that Sarah was his
[52:23] wife and and then God came to the king
[52:25] in the dream and said if you marry
[52:27] you're a dead man. He's like whoa whoa
[52:29] Lord what are you talking about? He said
[52:30] you know I I didn't know he told me he
[52:33] was his wife or his his sister. And so,
[52:35] but brother Brandham was just saying how
[52:36] like it was a very common occurrence for
[52:38] for men and women to meet with God back
[52:40] in the day. And he says now it's a
[52:42] rarity because we have so much
[52:44] distractions out here. We have social
[52:46] media, technology. I mean, if you go 50
[52:49] years ago to now, look how much more we
[52:50] have to work. Even though we're
[52:52] technically uh we're further advanced,
[52:54] but I believe the more advanced that we
[52:56] get, the further away we can get from
[52:58] God. And so that's why you see that that
[53:00] even uh we got psychiatrists are very
[53:03] high in demand now. People want to have
[53:05] them solve their problems, but they
[53:06] can't solve your problems. Like we said
[53:08] before, they they can't they can try to
[53:09] patch it up, but they can't solve the
[53:11] problem. And so, everybody wants to do
[53:15] um they want to try to find an easy way
[53:16] out.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; They don't want to try God because they
[53:19] know if they come to God, they got to
[53:20] give up things.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; They don't want to give up sin
[53:23] &gt;&gt; because sin feels good and it's
[53:24] pleasurable. But we know what sin what
[53:26] it produces, it produces death every
[53:28] time. So they know what God can do, but
[53:31] they they they they they don't want to
[53:33] uh give up drinking, um popularity,
[53:37] prosperity, all these things. Cuz you
[53:39] look at some of these mega churches, if
[53:41] they would start preaching the word of
[53:42] God, they they the congregation will
[53:45] probably be empty.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Literally probably be empty. But they
[53:48] know that they they they want to keep
[53:49] the the popularity. They want to keep
[53:51] the the big crowds because that's where
[53:53] the money is. It's all about the money.
[53:55] And so a lot of people, good people are
[53:58] going to miss it because they don't want
[54:00] to uh sell out locktock barrel. And we
[54:03] see Moses was he was presented with the
[54:05] same thing. The next in line to be
[54:07] Pharaoh. But yet he chose to rather to
[54:10] suffer with the people of God. He chose
[54:13] the reproach of Christ rather uh than
[54:16] that. And so we just see that we have to
[54:18] make a hard choice in this day and age
[54:20] because everything's presented to us.
[54:21] Popularity is presented to us. Friends
[54:23] are presented to us. Sometimes we got to
[54:24] walk away from friends because um being
[54:27] even unevenly yolked can actually draw
[54:30] you away from God
[54:32] &gt;&gt; because there's spirits. There's spirits
[54:34] can be on that person that can get onto
[54:35] you if you keep hanging around that. So
[54:37] we got to make we got to make choices
[54:38] who we're hanging out with. I'm not
[54:40] saying I'm not telling you who to hang
[54:41] out with, but I'm just telling you to
[54:42] have a little discernment and have a
[54:43] little wisdom.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; So um but I tell you God is right there
[54:47] lending you a helping hand. So, just
[54:49] talking about just how there's going to
[54:50] be times where you just feel like you
[54:52] can't take another another um trial or
[54:56] another issue or problem we could say.
[54:58] But just know that God is right there
[55:00] guiding you and giving you strength to
[55:02] handle and conquer this. So, all we have
[55:04] to do is trust and walk forward just
[55:05] like Moses told uh uh just like God told
[55:08] Moses. And let's let's read one more um
[55:11] okay
[55:13] so we'll read this from um why cry and
[55:16] speak. Faith is a long range vision.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; It it it don't lower the sights. It
[55:22] holds to the target. Amen. Any good
[55:24] shooter knows that. See, that's it. It's
[55:27] long range. It's a telescope. It's like
[55:29] a binocular. It's like like a
[55:30] three-point shooter. A pier just knock
[55:32] it down every time. It's a binocular.
[55:34] You don't have to look around. You don't
[55:36] use binoculars to look. You see what it
[55:38] is. It is. It is. He says what time it
[55:40] is. You don't use that, but you see use
[55:43] binoculars to look a way off. And faith
[55:45] does that. faith picks up God's
[55:47] binoculars, both of them, both sides,
[55:50] the New Testament, the Old Testament,
[55:51] and sees every promise that he made and
[55:54] and tense says here, he looks at the
[55:56] end. He don't drop the sights down to
[55:58] look this way. He looks out yonder. He
[56:00] keeps the crosshairs dead center on the
[56:02] word. That's what faith does. That's
[56:04] faith in a man that does those things.
[56:06] So, this the prophet is telling us that
[56:08] that faith doesn't waver. Faith is
[56:11] strong and has like he said, I think he
[56:12] has hairs on his chest. He said, and so
[56:14] it has big muscles. So that's what we
[56:16] need in this day and age is faith. I
[56:18] think a lot of times people just have
[56:20] hope. They don't have real genuine
[56:22] faith. And hope is good, but you need
[56:24] faith as well mixed with it. You got to
[56:26] have both. They're like sis like like
[56:27] sisters we can say. And so we see all
[56:30] these things that people will have like
[56:32] tattoos of crosses and scriptures and
[56:35] and chains, but yet this is for show
[56:38] because you ask them, "Oh, why'd you get
[56:40] this?" "Oh, I just like it." You know, I
[56:42] like the cross. I'm, you know, or I'm a
[56:44] Christian. and you ask, you start asking
[56:45] them things, oh, and this and that and
[56:47] that, you you kind of find out that, oh,
[56:49] yeah, okay. And you hear them talk with
[56:50] foul language. I'm like, oh, I don't be
[56:52] saying anything. I be I be just look
[56:53] looking and listening. I'm like, you
[56:55] know, if you call yourself a Christian,
[56:57] you shouldn't be talking like the world.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; So, but the thing is, I let I let God do
[57:02] his thing
[57:03] &gt;&gt; cuz if they're seed, they're seed. If
[57:05] they're not, they're not.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's my timer. All right, let's um
[57:09] let's do the Heb let's go to Hebrews
[57:11] 4:12 and we'll um we'll close there.
[57:16] For the word of God is quick and
[57:18] powerful, sharper than any two-edged
[57:20] sword, piercing even to the dividing of
[57:22] sunder of soul and spirit and the joints
[57:25] and marrow, and is a discerner of the
[57:27] thoughts intents of the heart. So I
[57:29] think a lot of times we tend to look at
[57:31] our situations too carnal. We don't look
[57:34] at with our spiritual looking glasses.
[57:36] So the thing is if you look at the
[57:37] situations and trials and carnality then
[57:40] of course you're going to worry, you're
[57:41] going to doubt. You're going to fear. So
[57:43] the thing is we have to put our
[57:45] spiritual looking glasses on and and see
[57:48] that we're in these situations for a
[57:50] reason. They're going to perfect you.
[57:52] They're going to better you. they're
[57:54] going to make you a better um a
[57:55] Christian, a better husband, a better
[57:57] wife, a better brother, a better
[57:58] minister, a better So, whatever it is.
[58:00] Um that that God wants to uh cuz I I
[58:03] believe that God wants you to be better
[58:05] in all areas
[58:06] &gt;&gt; cuz he he doesn't want to focus on this,
[58:08] but God wants to see you improve in
[58:10] every areas. And I believe we're in a
[58:12] season of restoration where we can
[58:13] improve in all the areas.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; May maybe somebody want to see their
[58:17] marriage um be more close. Maybe you
[58:19] want to see your kids um be filled with
[58:21] the Holy Ghost like we said, brother
[58:23] Messiah. Whatever it is, ask. Because I
[58:26] I believe that there's nothing
[58:28] impossible for God to do. God can do it.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; So your trials and tribulations, there
[58:34] aren't there to discourage you. They're
[58:36] not they're not to break you in a bad
[58:38] way. They're to build you spiritually.
[58:40] They're to break your flesh, yes, but
[58:42] they're to build you spiritually.
[58:44] Because your flesh is not going to like
[58:45] the trial. Your flesh is going to
[58:47] complain and murmur. But don't let don't
[58:50] don't let murmuring and complaining be a
[58:52] norm for you
[58:54] &gt;&gt; because it was a norm for the children
[58:55] of Israel and that's why they didn't
[58:57] make it. So thing is we want to catch
[58:59] yourself when you begin to murmur and
[59:01] complain because I know we're human
[59:03] beings we're going to complain but catch
[59:04] yourself so you don't make it a habit
[59:06] because a lot of times we make bad
[59:08] habits because we let it slip
[59:11] &gt;&gt; and if we let it slip then that's when
[59:13] it becomes a bad habit. So catch
[59:15] yourself like like brother Brandham
[59:16] said, you can't stop the devil from
[59:18] trying to put thoughts, but you can stop
[59:21] the thoughts from staying in your head.
[59:22] You can kick them out because if you let
[59:24] the thoughts come in, they're going to
[59:25] manifest. So don't let them manifest.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; So um your trials aren't there to
[59:30] discourage you, to break you in a bad
[59:32] way, but they're there to build you
[59:34] spiritually. God is building a building
[59:36] inside of you, and these trials and
[59:37] tribulations are to build that building.
[59:40] We have to realize that God knows what
[59:42] he's doing. So, so if the o so the
[59:45] oceans are going to roar, the mountains
[59:48] are going to be shaken, everything is
[59:50] going to these things are going to keep
[59:52] happening. So, what we need to do is
[59:54] just be thankful that we can be through
[59:56] these things because God sees something
[59:58] in you that he wants to perfect. And to
[1:00:01] me, that's a blessing that the very God
[1:00:03] of heaven cares about me that he wants
[1:00:05] to see you and I in perfection. And so
[1:00:09] we can walk in confidence that the
[1:00:10] oceans are going to roar, but he will
[1:00:12] not forsake you. So let's just bow our
[1:00:15] heads in word of prayer.
[1:00:17] Dear heavenly father, we we're so
[1:00:19] thankful, Lord, for this season that
[1:00:21] we're in, Lord Jesus. Father, we just
[1:00:24] seen you moved, Lord, in so many, many
[1:00:26] ways and so many miracles, Father, and
[1:00:29] healings and and refillings and
[1:00:31] fillings, Father. And we know, Lord,
[1:00:33] that this this isn't it, Lord. You have
[1:00:35] so much more, Father. Lord, exceeding
[1:00:38] abundant what we expect, Lord. And
[1:00:41] Father, as we walk, Lord, through with
[1:00:43] the eyes of faith, Lord, down this walk
[1:00:44] that you called us, Lord, help us, Lord,
[1:00:47] just to see the big picture, Lord. Help
[1:00:49] to remind us why we're here, Lord. We're
[1:00:52] here, Lord, just for you and you alone.
[1:00:54] Lord, may this day forward, may we we
[1:00:57] just walk with eyes of faith, Lord. May
[1:00:59] we not murmur and complain. If we do,
[1:01:01] Lord, help us to catch it, Lord Jesus.
[1:01:04] We don't want to make it a habit, but
[1:01:05] Lord, we want to make it a habit to
[1:01:06] praise and worship you, Lord. A habit to
[1:01:09] trust in you, Lord. A habit to take you
[1:01:11] at your word, almighty God. Let us make
[1:01:14] those kind of habits, Lord, because
[1:01:15] those kind of habits, Lord, are going to
[1:01:16] lead us to the promised land. And
[1:01:19] Father, may you bless all those here
[1:01:20] tonight, Lord. Those on the live stream,
[1:01:22] Lord. And Lord, may we, Lord Jesus, just
[1:01:25] just walk, Lord, as you call us to walk.
[1:01:27] You told Abraham to walk. You didn't
[1:01:29] tell him where to walk, but you told him
[1:01:30] to walk, Father. And sometimes in our
[1:01:33] walk, Lord, you tell us to walk without
[1:01:35] giving us exact direction, Lord. And
[1:01:38] Father, may you increase our faith,
[1:01:39] Lord. May you give us more of your Holy
[1:01:41] Ghost, more of you, Father. And may you
[1:01:43] bless this night, Lord. Ask all these
[1:01:45] things in the most precious holy name of
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:01:50] [Applause]
[1:02:04] Thank the Lord for the word
[1:02:07] uh tonight though the oceans may roar.
[1:02:12] Um I um just appreciate uh that and feel
[1:02:18] like we're going through a season where
[1:02:19] the oceans are certainly roaring. Uh but
[1:02:23] God promised never to leave us nor
[1:02:24] forsake us uh in times like this. So we
[1:02:28] are very very appreciative of that. Um
[1:02:32] brother Mark made a a statement about
[1:02:36] you know uh when you're going through
[1:02:38] things like that sometimes God will just
[1:02:40] kind of come through uh for you. And um
[1:02:45] he said he'll he'll hit a buzzer beater.
[1:02:48] Uh, I said, "Man, that's that's that's
[1:02:52] uh that's a really really good thought."
[1:02:54] You know, my my mind just start going
[1:02:56] through um different buzzer beatas that
[1:03:01] I done seen. Uh, I'm thinking about, you
[1:03:04] know, Ray Allen,
[1:03:06] uh, here in Miami and they were playing
[1:03:09] the San Antonio Spurs and and Chris
[1:03:13] Bosch got the rebound and threw it out
[1:03:16] to Ray Allen and he just
[1:03:18] let one fly. I think about Michael
[1:03:21] Jordan and um you know you'd always if
[1:03:25] you had him on your team, no matter how
[1:03:27] old he was, if Michael Jordan was on
[1:03:30] your team, you want to give him the ball
[1:03:32] to see if he could uh get the last shot.
[1:03:36] And I remember, you know, a couple times
[1:03:38] they they beat the Cleveland Cavaliers
[1:03:41] because Michael Jordan shot that last
[1:03:43] shot and a lot of buzzer beaters. But I
[1:03:46] just imagine if I had God on my team,
[1:03:52] Brother, I don't if God is on my side
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; and he's on my team, ain't nobody else
[1:03:58] going to get the ball. Give the ball to
[1:04:01] God.
[1:04:06] We are guaranteed to win if we can just
[1:04:09] get the ball in God's hands. and and and
[1:04:11] and if you could have that type of
[1:04:13] thought about whatever issue that you're
[1:04:15] facing, whatever trial you're going
[1:04:17] through, just get things in God's hands
[1:04:20] and it's going to be all right.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. I believe that with all my
[1:04:25] heart. So, I just I just appreciate
[1:04:27] that. My God. Uh God hit a buzzer beater
[1:04:31] on your behalf.
[1:04:33] Amen. God bless you, brother Mark. We
[1:04:35] really really appreciate Amen. and the
[1:04:38] word of the Lord on uh tonight. Amen.
[1:04:41] Let us uh have uh tonight's uh
[1:04:44] announcements and we will
[1:04:48] mention that to everyone. Uh so on uh
[1:04:54] let let me start with Friday. Uh we have
[1:04:58] service here and it's uh uh we deemed it
[1:05:03] a youth service. the youth will be
[1:05:05] responsible for the specials and and
[1:05:07] things of that nature. But we uh we will
[1:05:10] have a minister speaking, brother Caleb
[1:05:12] Duran, and uh he's coming from Tucson,
[1:05:16] Arizona. A few of his saints have
[1:05:18] already arrived. They've uh reached out
[1:05:20] to me, a couple families that have uh

[1:07:12] well on the bottom of the screen. And
[1:07:14] those inside the sanctuary, we do have a
[1:07:16] wooden box in the back as you exit or as
[1:07:19] you enter that you can use for your
[1:07:21] giving. Praise the Lord. All right. Um,
[1:07:25] do we have anyone here that would want
[1:07:27] to share a testimony uh tonight or if
[1:07:32] there's any special prayer requests uh
[1:07:34] that we have any testimonies? Okay. Come
[1:07:37] on. Come on. Come on, brother. Certainly
[1:07:40] appreciate the Lord. Amen. and all that
[1:07:43] he is doing in our midst. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:54] God bless the church. I don't have a
[1:07:56] testimony, but I actually do have a
[1:07:58] prayer request and I just want to ask
[1:08:01] the whole church to um keep a little
[1:08:03] situation in prayer. And I I was
[1:08:05] reminded of sister uh um Nelly. She gave
[1:08:10] a testimony. she had a situation with
[1:08:12] her computer where the computer was shut
[1:08:14] down and she has some stuff that she
[1:08:16] needed and today uh Mandy we're working
[1:08:19] on on an on the office and right now she
[1:08:22] doesn't have an office and she's working
[1:08:23] out of the uh table in the kitchen I
[1:08:26] mean in the uh dining room and a couple
[1:08:30] water spilled all over her computer and
[1:08:33] right now she doesn't seem to be able to
[1:08:35] get a lot of uh stuff that she has there
[1:08:38] is very important for the business and
[1:08:40] notes and and and and files. And so I I
[1:08:45] believe that through the preaching
[1:08:47] today, there's a lot that we can uh
[1:08:49] apply to that. I send her a couple texts
[1:08:52] throughout the preaching. I say, you
[1:08:53] know, this is very timely and we can we
[1:08:56] can stand on that
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and um and I and I believe that um uh us
[1:09:01] worrying in a situation does not uh
[1:09:03] bring us closer to the promises that God
[1:09:06] um has gave us. So we got to stand
[1:09:08] strong. And I just but I do ask that all
[1:09:11] of you would uh take that in into prayer
[1:09:14] that we may be able to either um get all
[1:09:17] that stuff back or get the computer
[1:09:20] fixed and get it back. And and if not,
[1:09:22] then I believe that all things are
[1:09:24] working together for our good. God has a
[1:09:26] plan. And um whether we get that stuff
[1:09:28] or not, we're still standing strong in
[1:09:29] God's word.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Anybody else? um
[1:09:37] a praise reporter prayer requests
[1:09:40] right you know um as brother Jose was
[1:09:44] just mentioned that was a a tape I was
[1:09:46] just listening to and and I don't think
[1:09:48] I ever caught this before
[1:09:52] and um thinking about
[1:09:55] Peter walking on water uh brother Random
[1:09:59] said when he walked on water he never
[1:10:02] even got wet
[1:10:06] Can you imagine that?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? And and with
[1:10:11] water, you're supposed to get wet. But
[1:10:16] the miracle is so powerful that Peter
[1:10:18] never even got wet.
[1:10:20] Um so I'm thinking about this computer

[1:12:59] cross, he brought both uh our salvation
[1:13:03] and our healing. Amen. And that in that
[1:13:05] one atonement is a dual atonement that
[1:13:07] we got the benefit for. So we'll be
[1:13:09] praying for brother Lim. Anybody else
[1:13:12] before we leave tonight? All right. All
[1:13:15] right. Well, let us um take these
[1:13:17] requests to the Lord. Um and um we'll
[1:13:22] prepare to dismiss. Father, we thank you
[1:13:23] for the uh word that was given to us.
[1:13:27] Though the oceans roar, mountains shake.
[1:13:31] Um
[1:13:32] God, we are are confident that uh you
[1:13:36] are still with us in the midst of it all
[1:13:38] and we don't have to uh fret. We don't
[1:13:41] have to worry. God, we can trust and
[1:13:43] lean on you and um because you are a
[1:13:48] miracle worker. And Lord, we uh have a
[1:13:51] couple needs here. this uh computer that
[1:13:55] uh a water spill happened to it and and
[1:13:58] now our sister is trying to navigate.
[1:14:01] Lord, we pray that you just as as Peter
[1:14:04] did not experience any uh wetness, God,
[1:14:08] we're asking that this computer would go
[1:14:10] through the same type of thing that it
[1:14:12] won't experience that and there would be
[1:14:14] no damage at all in this situation. you
[1:14:17] know how important a computer is to them
[1:14:20] uh to the business to to school
[1:14:22] everything Lord. So we uh we just we
[1:14:25] know that um the same God that was
[1:14:27] watching over Peter can watch over this
[1:14:28] computer. So we committed now into your
[1:14:30] hands and even hearing the testimony uh
[1:14:33] from sister Nelly a couple weeks ago.
[1:14:34] Sometimes we don't realize when we share
[1:14:37] our testimonies how much somebody else
[1:14:40] needs to hear that. You never know what
[1:14:42] another person will be going through and
[1:14:45] they'll need to draw strength from what
[1:14:46] is being shared. So Lord, we pray that
[1:14:48] you'd help us to Lord, just share what
[1:14:50] you have done for us and and uh just
[1:14:53] God, we ask that because we don't know
[1:14:54] who we're who we're helping along the
[1:14:56] way. We ask that you'd just be uh with
[1:14:58] our sister Zion. Lord, she has this test
[1:15:01] coming up. Pray that you would just uh
[1:15:02] minister to her in her need. Continue to
[1:15:05] touch Sister Shondaanda in her body. We
[1:15:07] thank you for what you've done thus far,
[1:15:08] and we know you'll complete the work
[1:15:09] that you started. uh limb is in need of
[1:15:13] a touch. Thank God that brother Roy was
[1:15:16] able to go there and just share Christ
[1:15:18] with him and give him Lord his heart was
[1:15:20] tender enough to be able to accept
[1:15:22] Christ as his savior and Lord we know
[1:15:25] that through u your death and the cross
[1:15:27] not only did you bring salvation but you
[1:15:29] also brought healing. So, Father, we
[1:15:31] pray that you would bring healing to his
[1:15:33] body and in between him and his
[1:15:34] condition, we place the blood of the
[1:15:36] Lord Jesus Christ, believing that you
[1:15:38] were wounded for his transgressions,
[1:15:39] bruised for his iniquities, the
[1:15:41] chastisement of his pieces upon you. And
[1:15:44] with your stripes, we declare healing.
[1:15:48] Father, as we prepare to leave this
[1:15:49] place but not your presence, may you,
[1:15:51] Father, uh uh just go with us and may
[1:15:54] you keep us till we come back together
[1:15:56] on uh Friday night as we Lord just uh
[1:15:59] looking forward to hearing what you
[1:16:02] would speak to us through your servant,
[1:16:03] Brother Caleb. We ask that you give him
[1:16:05] traveling mercies as he would come and
[1:16:07] Lord just uh bless Amen uh his his
[1:16:10] coming and bless his going. May you get
[1:16:13] all the glory and all the honor and all
[1:16:14] the praise. It's in Jesus name we pray.
[1:16:17] Amen. Amen. And amen. God richly bless
[1:16:22] you church. Uh the brothers will come at
[1:16:25] this time uh to dismiss you. Amen. God
[1:16:28] bless you.
