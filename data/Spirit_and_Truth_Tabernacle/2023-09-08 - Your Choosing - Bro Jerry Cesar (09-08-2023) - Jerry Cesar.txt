TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord one more time man um I'd like to just open our service by reading a scripture um brother Burley ministered at a youth service one time and he read this scripture and I think it's something very fitting for all of our youth it's out of Psalm 73. man Psalm 73 praise the Lord [Music] amen um praise the Lord it says truly God is good to Israel even to such as art of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well not slipped for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked but there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men at least that's what it looked like to David says therefore Pride can passeth them about as a chain violence covered them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than a heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the Earth therefore as people return hither in the waters of a full cup or wrong out to them and they say how does God know and is there knowledge in the most high the whole these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in the riches verily I have cleansed my heart in vain again this is David's thoughts watching The Wicked prosper and he's just wondering you know what about me says barely have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency for all the day long have I been plagued and chasing every morning if I say I will speak thus behold I should have finned against the generation of thy children when I thought to know this it was too painful for me and I like this next verse until I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I therein amen looked like everybody else just having so much pleasure and they're prospering they're doing this they're doing that but I sacrifice and and I can't do this I can't go here I can't go there but there's an end to those things and there's also into these things Amen in the end to these things is eternal life amen so we're happy to be here again amen for youth service and I was just sharing with a brother just recently you know a church and they have quite a few young people but um in that church they have no events for the young people none whatsoever even though they have a bunch of young people and uh you know we might not have a man a whole bunch of young people but we will have events for the ones that we do have amen and as they say build it they'll come so we want to be faithful to our youth we want to give them every opportunity to draw closer to the Lord amen as we can let's pray amen man before we open the Service tonight Our Father we give you all the glory we give you all the honor we give you all the praise for who you are to us Lord as we uh just look here at the scripture that David was writing just looking at the wick and it seems like how they Prosper we all have thoughts like that where we look at others and we thank lord they're just doing so much better and we have to sacrifice and we have to do this we have to do that but David he considered all that but it says he was a little discouraged until he went into the house of the Lord he understood therein so Lord help us to understand that the sacrifices that we're making in moments like this Lord will have eternal rewards so we pray that you would bless Lord our youth as they come here tonight we trust that the spirit of God would have preeminence in this service and our worship Lord and the hearing and the preaching of the word May the spirit of God lord just take complete control we give you the glory we give you

time we'll open our Bibles will turn our Bibles this morning to a few chapters uh we want to start in the Book of Revelation chapter 12. and the Book of Galatians chapter 6. Revelation 12 the third chapter and we'll just read a till verse 9 in Galatians chapter 6 verse 7 through 8. the same man when you're there praise go out all right third verse that reads and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tale who drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the Earth now I remember with this verse I believe it was our Deacon that pointed out in his tell Drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the Earth his tale was the lies of Satan right that dual meaning the the lies that Satan calls even in heaven to cast the Angels Out of Heaven in verse 4 from verse 4 says his his tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and the woman fled Into the Wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there 1203 score days verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael in his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and there that great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him we'll go to Galatians chapter 6. verse 7. it says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also weep for he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life you may have your seats may the Lord add a blessing to his reading and I'm grateful for tonight um you know I want to just take this opportunity uh you know to just really have a talk to the young people as if I was sitting right before you face to face not so much in a preaching way but just having a talk um and I trust that God will bless your heart but we read in Revelation there and you realize that before the Earth was even created and Heaven uh there was such a there was a big war there the scripture says Michael and his angels fought against that dragon and uh one of the things that I want to point the young people to today is that you are in a great battle in this hour and you have been as our pastor kind of went into this uh on Wednesday I thought it was very I thought it was a confirmation but you have been selected you have been hand-picked in this day to fight this battle that you are in uh and now in this battle now it comes down to one thing it comes down to your choosing and that's the title of my sermon tonight is your choosing you see there's been many choices in this life and you will go in this world and have many choices right but the choices that you make must reflect the person that you want to be of course but it has to reflect the person God has called you to be that's the choice you want to make you you want to be able to realize that the choice that I made today my future self will be satisfied we'll be happy with that choice right now there's a lot of wrong choices that are around us and in fact today wrong choices are Justified right when people make wrong choices they try to call them oh they have mental health issues right oh they'll be in the mental institute right and brother Brandon's deal with actually a lot of mental health institutes but uh nowadays there's not that much anymore uh and I think there should be uh you know but but that's the that's the justifying cause of of having a wrong making the wrong decision people not wanting to take accountability for making the wrong choice but make get into a place where they're like oh it's mental health issues you know I've learned saints that you cannot medicate sin with sin you cannot do that you cannot medicate sin with sin you see the only way you can medicate sin is by by bring sin unto the Judgment of God right you bring sin to the Judgment of God it will disintegrate right the prophet says that before you can do wrong you have to cast out the word of God before you can do something evil you have to exit yourself out of the presence of God you see now the the prophet says here in this message the choosing of a bride he says in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose our own way that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether or not we're going to be educated that's the choice right and wrong is a choice every man and every boy uh and girl has the choice to choose whether or not they're going to try to live right and not live right it's a choice and I like this here it says choice is a great thing so the choice you have is a great opportunity and one of the best things about choices is that you have the choice right now to better the choices you've made the very opportunity right now you have the choice whatever the choice you've made in the past you can make that better choice at this very moment you see now it says Uh there's an unwritten law among us and that is choosing and in the scripture Galatians 6 10 it says as we therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith you see it's not just a matter of coming to church you we have all these ministering brethrens that are faithful in the Lord they come and they feed us the word of God and I just want you to consider for a moment that uh these uh things are not to be taken for granted uh our pastor labors he puts in a lot of commitment and time a sacrifice for this uh so when you come into the presence of God you want to understand that God has a message prepared for you God has something that he knows that you're dealing with and he wants to bring you to the image of perfection you see now in this great battle we understand that there was a beginning to it and that's that that battle that we are fighting now started with Satan saying in his in his In His Image wanting to uh be like the most high uh right uh deceived the third of the angels in heaven uh and because of that we are on earth finding a Heavenly battle okay now Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 14. this is just a little past about Satan it says Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have said thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till the iniquity was found in thee I just want you to know who is constantly attacking you in verse 16 it says by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee all covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up before thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of the brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may be holy you see Satan could not get to a place to accept that the way that he was created was for God's glory the way that he was created was for God's purpose and because he felt to see that the mechanics that was in him that made him who he was he allowed he came to a place where he surrendered to those mechanics and his his fall began when he lifted himself in his heart and that's why it's so important that whatever you do uh whether it's how you look how you decide to dress yourself how you decide to speak to other people all these things are so important because they're either going to reflect Satan or they're going to reflect God and you want to make sure that the scripture even says you know what man of conversation have ye so your conversations ought to always be holy right and and your the way you conduct yourself ought to always be holy these are the ways that God finds p pleasing to you okay but we realize that when it comes to the beautiful things of this Earth those are the things that Satan are associated associated with right now in Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12 it says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how about cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in our heart I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high and I want you to know that Satan has fulfilled that the prophet preaches a message Satan's Eden uh he's fulfilled a perversion a perverted version of that because this we're the world you see today is Satan's Eden you see and that's why it's so important that you do not get confused or disappointed when you don't look like the world right because the world is Satan's Eden so when you see a friend looking a certain way talking a certain way dressed a certain way right that should alert you that that person is not walking the lifestyle I'm walking so always keep that in mind young people and the message uh greatest battle ever fall it says Prophet says in paragraph 60 so Army first and getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set and getting ready to start and uh we'll just jump to paragraph uh 63 and he says and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings he's talking about the original sin that create that was started in heaven then he said and then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it and I like this because the prophet says God had Satan to come and destroy it that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on Eighth on Earth and beginning us and has been raging ever since and uh paragraph 68 will jump there it reads when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage so we'll just stop right there for now there was a place where the battle began right when we look through the the church history we notice that a fee of the Paul started in the Church of Ephesus and he laid down the word that was our foundation we we still read that today from from from Ephesians we go to Iranians day from Iranians we go to Martin and up until Martin Luther John Wesley and there was a a a a a work that God was doing and that was God preparing his soldiers for battle all of those times God Was preparing his soldiers for battle but the prophet said that the battle began and there was a time for the battle to rage and and the prophet says the battle grounds begin in the human mind so when you when you let's say you're creating a super soldier you're creating that soldier from the ground up the body is built but now comes a place where the mind has to be conditioned to overcome the truck the battle the mind has to be conditioned to to defeat the enemy on the other side and now the Battleground is in the human mind today which means that the mind that that that that that we the day that we're living in right now where we have all these resources we have all these great things right it's become the biggest trial any young person can go through because they have to make a choice whether they're going to accept that or deny it you see and when you consider the mind the Mind deals with uh imaginations constants memory reasons and affections and those things if you're not careful it will lead you instead of you leading it okay you cannot be led of your emotions over your memory we could talk about memory for a little bit right you might have done something that you weren't supposed to do right but you have to be willing to allow God to start something new in you every day right so you have to forget about that memory you have to forget about what happened and reasoning right the Bible says you have to cast down your reasoning you see that part of you has to come unto submission of your decision to follow Christ same goes with your imaginations your imagination is going to lead you wild you're going to have all sorts of thoughts you see uh the scripture well brother random says you know you you can you can battle against a bird or animal but you have to make the choice whether it's going to Nest or not so you have the decision whether you're going to accept those things or deny it and uh and then it talks about uh of course you have who you are as a Believer and when you talk about who you really are it's you in the soul that's the nature of the the spirit is the nature of your soul so you have to recognize that what you do with your flesh or what you sow to your flesh is going to lead to corruption but what you sow to the spirit will lead to everlasting life so that's the part that you have to think about every day and in doing that realizing that that's the part that God created in His image before Adam and God before Adam and Eve uh was created uh In the Flesh they were created in the spirit now I want to encourage you this evening that as you have the opportunity to choose choose right make the right choice now we want to just go through a few places here and we'll a few places where we see those in the scripture that did not make the right choice right now we can think about the Rich Young Ruler he didn't make the right choices all right he had the opportunity to accept Christ but he didn't do that we could talk about uh Judas Judas didn't make the right choice uh but as the battle is in the mind I want to focus on those that God called for a purpose those that God called for himself that also failed to make the right choice now we can start with Samson right Samson was created to destroy the very enemy that he was brought up to to destroy but he started to Fellowship not just Fellowship but he had a desire in his heart he had a love in his heart forward was on the other side and when you understand your purpose you have to be able to lay aside your own desires you have to lay aside the things that you like the most the things that are most dearest to you so that you can accomplish God's purpose right now we can just read it here in Judges chapter 16 verse 4. it says and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was Delilah and the Lords of the Philistine Came Upon her and said unto her entice him and see where in his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us Eleven Hundred of pieces of silver you see the enemy in this case has been studying Samson he he the enemy knew what Samson's weaknesses were and because of that it was an opportunity for them to Prevail because they're a game plan at this moment was Delilah go and tie Samson because he has his heart is for you now scripture goes on in chapter six and verse 6 it says Delilah said unto Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength light and wherein thou might be bound to afflict thee and as I read this I thought it was quite strange because Delilah didn't cut any corners she made it very clear to Samson that I'm coming to put you in bondage so tell me how I can do that and oftentimes young people you are working with the Enemy to destroy your own self and and that's the part where you have to realize that the enemy is not as strong as you think he is because you are the the very instrument he's using for defeat which means you are the same instrument that you can use for yourself for victory so you have to remember that in verse 15 we'll jump to that and she said unto him eventually Samson didn't take heed to that but Samson did play along because it took a few times before she could actually deceive Samson but here she says how can thou say I love thee when thine heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has not told me wherein thy great strength life and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her his whole heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon my head for I have been a Nazareth unto God for my from my mother's room if I be shaving then my strength will go away from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man this is when Samson made the wrong choice well he he made the wrong choice to be there to begin with but but but he sealed his choice when he eventually told the other enemy where what his real weakness was and you know the story that as they came to Prevail against Samson it took Samson and before I get there Samson actually uh the scripture says he tried to raise up like other times and then he said to himself I will go and raise up like I've done before see Samson for God that his strength didn't come from himself it came from God so whatever situation you find yourself in always remember God has you there for a purpose God has you there for a reason and it's God that's obligated to take you out of that now he he found himself in this place of defeat right but it took Samson remembering who he was remembering the purpose he was created for and Samson was so determined to fulfill that purpose his own life didn't even matter he was willing to fulfill that purpose at the cost of his own death and the scripture says he defeated killed over 3 000 or more Philistines than he that he when he was alive in his death you see that was a testimony that he left behind right and I and I used him as an example because we know that Samson uh right he had a confident with God he was what we would call today a believer now another person that uh that didn't make the right choice I actually want to read this quote the prophet says in the Forgotten Beatitudes he says God can only use what part you yield to him God can only use what part you yield to him and that's important young people the prophet goes on to say God can use what you yield like Samson Samson would not yield his Hearts to God he gave that to Delilah but he gave his threat to God and God could only use his strength that's all but if a fellow could only yield his complete being to God now that's if you can yield your body God will use your body if you can yield your mind God will use your mind your heart Whatever It Is God will use what you give to him uh to use with he's seeking somebody that he can find yielded like that so you see God is finding vessels that he can dwell himself in and use you for his glory in verse two I'm sorry and uh II Timothy verse chapter 2 verse 3 and 4. I want to pull that up here and just want to bring this to your attention second Timothy chapter 2 verse 3. you know people it's important to bring your Bible to church I've given you time to pull the scriptures up see you guys depending on the technology but in like the scriptures when you hear the Turning of the pages so second Timothy Chapter 2 Verse 3 it says Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier see here we find that you were chosen for this battle but Paul is saying to us in Timothy as you are in the world are you as you are in this war at no time should you have time to entangle yourself with the Affairs of this life and I know we're all guilty of it I'm guilty of it but it's important to recognize that they profit nothing and it says that you may be may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier God has chosen you to fight this battle in this day and there's a way that God expects you to to conduct yourself so that you can overcome those battles now in second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1 and 2. we find a soldier that did eventually entangle himself with the affairs a soldier that entangled himself with the Affairs of this world in verse 1 in Samuel second Samuel chapter 11 we'll go ahead and read that second Samuel chapter 11. and it says and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent joab and his servants with him in All Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besage rabba but David Terry still at Jerusalem see David was supposed to be in battle with his army but he decided to stay back this day he says you know what I'm just gonna stay back they got it and they overcame verse 2 says and it came to pass an even time that David arose from his bed and walked upon the roof of his King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon see because David decided to stay behind when his army went forth to battle he was in a place that he had no business being right and and and this is what the scripture would call a tangler himself but David decided that what what he would and I'm sure at this point David had uh some sort of idea that that this woman would be there but he went there he saw this woman and it automatically created a battle right and in this battle David began to plot on how he could make this woman his wife and verse 14 and it came to pass in that morning that David wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah now Uriah was the husband of this woman Bathsheba and you know I I like the the the life of Uriah because you know when Uriah came back from that battle David tried to send him home and Uriah said to David you know uh we're intense uh the the children the Israel Judah they're they're there we need to be ready for this battle so I go home and eat and you know David says you know you can remain here for a little while for two days and then this is when David decided that he was going to put Uriah in a position to take him out right the way to to to take Beth Sheba to himself was a way to take take your Uriah out so in verse uh eventually Uriah went to battle and David's commission or letter was that put Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest battle put him in a position where he would be by himself you see it it was a decision that was that was selfish it was a decision that didn't have no consideration for who would lose and and what would what would be lost you see but David when he did this in verse 26 right it says that verse 26 we'll skip there and the wife and when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband and when the morning was passed David sat fetched her into her house and she became his wife and bear him a son now David didn't even wait whole 24 hour the very next morning didn't think about her morning then think about that he died the very next morning my plan worked you could come out to me but the scripture says this thing that David had done displeased the Lord so you got to be careful that you might have a plan you might have an idea but is it pleasing to God is it pleasing to the Lord because this thing that David had done was not pleasing to God and we find in the second chapter in this next chapter there in verse 12 I'm sorry chapter 12 verse 1. God sent Nathan to David and we'll read it together here verse one it says and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the one poor the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little Eve ulam which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drink of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come upon him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for that man that was come to him in verse 5 and Davis anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the land fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity in verse 7 Nathan said unto him Thou Art the man you see when David was pointing fingers at this man not realizing who that man was he forgot there was three fingers pointing back at him and he when when Nathan told him that you are that man you know I can imagine how David felt but I know he felt that he made the wrong choice because in Psalms 51 it says I have acknowledged my transgression before me you see but David made the wrong choice here right and this Choice meant to a lot of other wrong choices right the Lord said to him because you have done this thing I will raise up evil in thy house right that that was God's word to David but I like what God Said after that because there was a little disclaimer right and usually disclaimers are really you know not really positive things disclaimers are full of contingencies but in this case God had to reassure David in verse 12 it says at verse 13 rather it says and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin thou shall not die you see God had to be specific with this because David had responded to Nathan that this man shall surely die and God knew that what um what a king speaks must come to pass if a king says thus it will be thus no matter the situation right but that was aching and a king had to come to surrender to the king and the King said thou shall not die whatever they whatever a king said it was overwritten by what the king said you see and uh in verse 24 it says and David comforted Bathsheba his wife now the reason he was comforting his wife is because one of the first things that happened as a as a fruit of what Dave David's Choice was is his firstborn was died who died now when his firstborn died David tried to pray against it tried to fast against it try to mourn against it but God had already spoke that evil would be raised up in your home now it says David comforted his wife and went unto her and lay with her and she barely a son and he called his name Solomon and the Lord loved him he said I thought this was very interesting because the Lord was displeased with an act that David had done but here he loved the fruit that was produced by the very same Act now this is to say that you young people you will sow seeds into who you are in the flesh but you were also sow seed into who you are in the spirit and once you sow into In the Flesh will reap corruption but what you sow in the spirit will reap eternal life see God turned a crime scene into a Plan of Redemption God turned David from a murderer with a death penalty to a masterpiece in restoring his Temple now my question to you y'all people what can God do for you what can God turn you from you see God can turn it around and I've seen them do it now making the right choice requires faithfulness in Daniel will go and read a few things here but we find another man that we we see that made the right choice and no doubt we can go to various places but I thought his testimony was astonishing now in Daniel chapter 6 verse 1 it says it please Darius to set over the kingdom and 120 princes we should be all over the whole Kingdom and over these three presidents of whom Daniel was first that these princes might give accounts unto them and the King should have no damage then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm So Daniel had already found favor with this King you see now Daniel was in a position where if he went right he was blessed if he went left he was still blessed and his enemy said adversaries recognize that and in verse 4 it says then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find that occasion nor fault and I want you to realize this young people the reason they could not find any occasion the reason they could not find any fault it says here because for as much he was faithful and I thought that was very important you see in your faithfulness to God our people might say all kinds of things but when you are faithful to him he will be faithful to you see you're not just being faithful to a god you're being faithful to the god that created heavens and earth you're being faithful to the god that can create out of nothing you're being faithful to the god that can come on this scene right now and change the situation [Music] now this was Daniel's testimony for as much as he was found faithful they could not find they could not find any occasion against him and maybe the enemy's trying to find an occasion against you tonight right but he can't find none because you're here every Wednesday you're here every Sunday you're in church Faithfully but the enemy's plan don't stop there it don't stop because he knows what you're faithful to because here in this case and we'll read it together here verse 5. then said these men we shall not find occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God you see the enemy if he can't defeat you he'll join what you're a part of and when he joins you what you're part of he tries to misrepresent this word he'll try to make you disbelief the word make you realize or see that there's something wrong with this message there's something wrong with this word oh you know this message is too strict oh I see other believers well they're doing this they're doing that but but I'm doing this and I don't see what it's doing right but it's what our pastor read earlier right the wicked could Prosper but when you come into the congregation of the Lord then you can understand there I am but also your end you see because the believer doesn't have an end so you go from Victory to Victory from eternity to Eternity you see so when you realize that young people praise the Lord praise the Lord that's all right brother so this is what they decided to do eventually right say I we will find a fault against them concerning the law of his God now we'll read verse 6 here now but I wanted to mention this as well when I came to this scripture I actually was not sure if I should call the title of this sermon you're choosing or your faithfulness and I've come to realize that your choosing must be your faithfulness your faithfulness to his word your faithfulness to God your faithfulness to what he's revealed to you through his word that has to be your choosing you see it says that uh the man that endureth until the end he shall be saved verse 6 says then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live forever all the presidents of the king the governors and the princes the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man or 30 days save of thee O King he shall be cast into the Den of Lions now I just want to stop here for a moment and realize how it took all these men all these Great Men and that's what the enemy does to you he assembles himself with the armies of his kingdom to find occasion against you and how he can defeat you which means he's studying you he's studying when you wake up he's studying you in your prayer life he's studying you and how you receive the word he's studying you not when you're in church when you're outside the church that's when he's studying you to find occasion to find fault that's what these were doing to Daniel now in verse 8 says narrow King establish the decree and signed a writing that it be not changed according to the law of the meetings and the Persians which alter it not so they knew once the king signed it it was sealed verse 9 wherefore King Darius signed the writing and a decree now when Daniel knew I like that when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four times you see faith is bold faithfulness knows no defeat I said faithfulness knows no defeat see Daniel how to make a mind and he had a choice even after he knew the king's decree he decided that he was going to continue his faithfulness and young people I encourage you no matter what love is past he she them faithful to God faithful to God so your choices must always reflect God's Eternal purpose for your life because he remained faithful God could reckon God could show his faithfulness to Daniel you see in our verse 11 the king's decree a king's decree it says these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spanked before the king concerning the king's decree see they they were not done studying after they studied now they they started to eavesdrop on his prayer perhaps they heard Daniel asking for great things asking for healing for the nation perhaps they heard Daniel Prayed for the sick right but it goes on the same hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within 30 days save of thee O King shall be cast into the dens of line the king answered and says the thing is true according to the law of the meetings and the Persians which altereth not see despite of them knowing that Daniel was praying right it didn't affect their choice to continue to find an occasion against Daniel and verse 13 it says then answer they and said before the king that Daniel which is of the children of the Captivity of Judah regardless not Theo King nor all heard these words was so displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him now Daniel had favored with this King and they knew that in verse 15 it says uh I'm sorry not uh yeah verse verse 16. it says then verse 15 or see 15 okay it says then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king no O King that the Lord the law of the medes and the Persians is that no decree no statute uh which the thus the king established may not be changed then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and cast him into the Den of Lions and now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom thou service continually he will deliver thee and I like this because see the king had spoke how to decree that he already signed and sealed but now this this King decided that he was going to speak something over Daniel's life that that whom their service continually he will deliver thee you see and he spoke the word and God honored what he spoke you see now I believe that when you are going through something where you know you've been faithful faithful to what God has called you to be speak the word and when you speak the word it will allow other people to speak the word you see because of God's because of Daniel's faithfulness it created strength it created encouragement it created faith in someone that was not even a believer so who you can who can you convert by your faithfulness to God now the power of the king is greater than any ceiling of a king any ceiling of a king now I want to read this at the time is at hand the prophet says in paragraph 20 says there come a time where the Hebrew children had to make a stand whether they were going to bow down to a heathen image or whether they were going to keep their faith in the true and living God but Tom came when the decision must be made and they made the right decision and God was with them the time came with a Prophet Daniel had to make a decision of whether he would fail to pray he would keep the tradition of religion of that country or whether he would go to his regular custom where he had fellowship with God raise up the windows and pray towards the Temple Daily and Daniel had to make his decision and the time finally forced him to to a place where he had to make it God when he speaks anything he forces it to the place and Daniel had to make a decision and when he went straight to the place of his worship and raised up the windows and worshiped God God protected his Prophet God will always do it do you believe that this evening see God will always protect his Believers his children when they are faithful to him faithful to his word because God is faithful to his own word now I want to read this I want to read this quote here uh let's see now we'll continue I don't think I'm gonna find it here but I'm gonna Echo what the prophet said uh we'll move forward you know he says there is a time where there's a separating line and you have to it's a dangerous time he said if you wait to the last minute to make a decision because the reason is so dangerous because you can think you've come out of something but you're still holding on to the things that you just refuse to to leave behind so he says it's a dangerous thing to wait to the last minute so I encourage you young people it's later than you think because it's letting you think you have to get to a place where you mean business where you serious enough to realize that the choices that I make Hereafter are going to reflect God and we'll go ahead and uh see another King the king that had to come to an hour of decision now in the message conferences the prophet says Jesus was brought himself to a decision and before going to Calvary the father brought his own son into conference in Gethsemane while his angels taking their positions to see what the decision would be oh it might not have been this way but let's think maybe it was I can hear him say son do you desire to go on to Calvary there's a band waiting for you there's persecution there's death murder laying in the way there's exposure of your own body they'll they'll strip the clove off of you you'll be beat into Pope they'll put a crown of thorns over your head and you'll die screaming for Mercy should you go on look at the decision and sometimes when we sitting in our seats and the Holy Spirit says You must do this or you must do that you got someone you won't speak to you won't speak to them you won't make it right and you're just ashamed to go up and say if you are in the wrong or what if you're not in the wrong to go up and say brother let's forget it and talk it over Jesus when he looked up in the face of the father he said it's not my will yours to be done what a decision that decision anchored and swept the world and still comes tonight to every penitent Soul not my will but thine be done since there was a decision also made a Pentecostal decision 120 went up to the upper room and they were waiting because their leader the Lord had ascended up into heaven to the father and he had told them he said now you wait up until the city of Jerusalem now I don't want you to go out preaching it I don't want you to have any schooling you don't need any more theology but I want you to go up there and just wait till you get in one Accord then I can send you the decision of Heaven back to you you see so wherever you are today young people I encourage you that if you're seeking after the baptism of the Holy Ghost wait until you get it and don't stop seeking after it and if you've gotten baptism of the Holy Ghost seek for refilling a refilling of the Holy Ghost and I I believe that the the the Holy Ghost is as powerful today as it was in the days of Pentecost so in the middle of your weakness the power of the Holy Ghost will prevail in your life now in closing this a scripture I came across and I will call this the king's decree we saw David's decree over his life we saw King uh Darius decree now we will see the king's decree we'll go into Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 14. now when the king speaks every word must come to pass but the word of God the Bible says it must fall under the ground so that it can bring forth a hundred hundred fold at verse 14 it says but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart thou mayest do it means that the word is close to you the word is at your at your at your availability you have this word verse 15 it says see I have set before this day life and good and death and Evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land with thou goal is to possess it but if that heart turned away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away in worship of the Gods and serve them I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whether thou passeth over Jordan to go to possession verse 19 I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both you and thy seed may live there's the decree in your seed I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that thou mayest and thy seed may live so you see you have this choice to make and here God is being being very plain he's saying to choose life right because if you choose life you'll live and I like to say the way to have an absolute is by a choosing and when you make the choice to choose life always choose life always choose Christ right now I'm gonna just share a testimony I had a few scriptures lined up here but I have a testimony I'd like to share as we read the many decisions that were made the good decisions and the bad decisions the wrong choices and the choices that led to corruption now as I came across this thought I remembered that some years ago there was a sermon preached that I didn't really take much heed to I not he but I didn't think too much of it at the time but when I thought about this thought and I went back I realized how prophetic and how life-changing that sermon was so I wish to read a quote here from the message make the right choice by Pastor Jack Duff in 2018 May 6. our Pastor said make the right choice you have the chance to make a choice but we're talking about making the right choice there are certain things that happen in life it says when parents bring us to church that is good that's good things for the parents to bring you to church but the purpose of bringing you to church into the church is to put you in an atmosphere that God can actually speak to you and you can begin to have your own personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and when I remembered our pastor priest that in 2018 in uh May 6 I I remember that it was a few months later I had to I was in a Crossroads I had to make a decision I had lost my job around that time it was actually around April I lost my job and it was a promising job that I had I had many I had a lot of potential there and it came a time where I reconsidered what I really wanted to do with my life and the decision that I had to make was whether or not I was going to go to the military and go into the army or if I was going to stay home and become a barber now remember it was too much later I went to Israel and that was a trip of a lifetime for me but as I was seeking the Lord for Direction trying to make the right choices there are certain things God laid in my path one of the things that I saw while I was in Israel is I saw a barber shop with my last name on it and I immediately told that to my pastor and some of the other brothers I was like you know I think God is speaking to me when I came back to the meetings we had the July meetings at brother West Coast and another brother came up to me and says hey are you a barber and I never told that brother anything that was the second confirmation and then it was towards the end of the meetings a brother preached on Moses how Moses knowing what was on the other side refuse the riches and the pleasures and he chose the heart away and you see when going to the military I knew what was before me I knew the opportunities that I would have had I didn't know what was going to happen if I became a barber so there was no doubt the hard way so I said you know that was that's the third confirmation I'm choosing the hard way and church that same year because I made that choice as God led me I I so many things happened you see so I encourage you that as you hear God speak to you choose life because God was speaking through my pastor then and it unfolded a few months and then I'm going I'm going and five years later I am where I am today [Applause] I wish to read this scripture in closing verse 16. it says verse 2 chapter 16 Proverbs 16 verse 2. it says all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes but the Lord weighed the spirit so you might think you're just accepting a job offer you might think you're just making a new friend but remember the Lord weighed the spirit and in verse 3 says commit The Works unto the Lord thy works and thy thoughts shall be established and the prophet says in this message here spiritual amnesia in paragraph 89. he says notice and he is in me and I am in him every Christian that has a real genuine Christian experience when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the Mortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning Stars sang together in the sons of God shouted for Joy now you might be asking yourself you know I've tried to make the right choice but I just can't seem to make it I'm still here but I'm I'm struggling with making the right choices well I'm going to declare tonight that you will make the right choice because you were identified with him you see Rahab had something that she that was identified in her where she could receive the spies into her home and because she made the right choice to receive the spies her opportunity was created for her so that she can receive life so that she can receive an escape so I encourage you young people tonight love God and as you love him love him with all your heart love him with all your soul and love him with all your mind praise God [Applause] let us bow Heavenly Father God I thank you tonight for speaking to our hearts Lord as our precious brother Smiley often says when you're speaking you're speaking to
