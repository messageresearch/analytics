of them I understand over him and England that they wouldn't allow more than two people to gather together well all you did was put us back in Scripture because Jesus sake wherever two three [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let's eat just for a few minutes here just want to take a little time to bring greetings to all those that are joining us online we have been blessed here in the state of Florida and the Lord has given us a governor that says you know when I'm not gonna limit people for going to church on Easter I want them to be able to go to the house of God you know so we've been able to come together just a few Saints and a man someone joining us online and we thank God for that because we're still trying to do all of them use all the precautions we can a man just use the little wisdom during this time but we thank God just to be able to gather together and also I wanted to thank the Lord we have spoken word ministries there out of a man Londyn a man whispered women passed in air and you know that he called me up a little earlier this week and he says brother we were supposed to have meetings and you know this devil just comes with this business this little attack here say but we still want to have service and I say ok say how many services y'all having and I was telling them what we were doing for this weekend they say well brother we still have our meeting - what they've done is have the meetings virtually and you know so they've been using this tool called zoom and then I'm just one that believed God had the people developed a platform like zoom just so the Saints could still go to church today they have issues the government actually can't use the platform they're coming against zoom because of some of the you know security things like that but and and in our field of work we actually want this to get out if somebody wants to break in and see somebody's we're okay with that maybe your life would be changed by the power of God so you know if they took zoom and they've been creating some services and ever since Friday they had a service Friday at 2:00 on Saturday and - today hey man so in England it's roughly you know a little after 5:00 I mean almost 6 o'clock up there and they are tuned in to this service a man enjoying the worship and we want to say God bless you try brothers and sisters from the UK God richly bless you we're so happy to have you in fellowship and so happy that the Lord inspired the pastor to put something like this together we still gonna have Easter regardless a man so this is a different way of doing it but God is good anyway earlier this I got a chance to see the service over on Friday and and I texted out to a few Saints and then gave them information for yesterday but I didn't get a chance necessary but this morning I got up and I was looking at the service and and I saw my precious brother and friend brother Lincoln Amen up in North Carolina ministering to the Saints there and in the UK and I say wow what a what a blessing he was preaching on the sermon the crooked line journey of the believer amen the crooked line journey of the believer and he was saying God never moves us or a man does things in a straight line you don't do things like that God always moving like this it's a crooked line journey and I love one of the things he said that I was listening I couldn't catch the whole sermon but I was blessed by what I heard he says God always appears in the beginning and what it does is give you a promise in the beginning and then what he does is disappear in the middle he appears in the beginning gives you promise and then he disappears in the middle to see if you're gonna hold on to what he said and when you get to the end olives let me show up it's like when he shows up he said I told you so and the other thing about our goddess he only have to say it one time for it to come to pass our God does not have to repeat himself Amen if he said it that settles it lets it be the name of the Lord so I was ours bless a man by brother Lincoln a man just just hearing hearing the word of the Lord amen through him and and I just I just believed that the Lord will just complete this today and we were we were we were certainly looking forward to being there in fellowship and in the UK for Easter and after brother Guinta had passed through this way last year and and he declared you know that Easter the UK you know and the Saints when we're ready to go I believe we had about 40 sinks and we're ready to come tickets paid for and everything and hotels paid for it in corona candy but but the Lord knows all things and and and some of the saints what we've done is we've left our ticket opening praise God with the airline so that means when things open up again there is a freedom for us to travel and we know that we talked about maybe doing something next year but if the Lord wants us to come before that then we're gonna be open a man to whatever the Lord has in store he's a good God he's an awesome God a man a man amen so what I want to do a man I know when I when I go to UK a man I have to do two things I have to preach I have to sing and what I'd like to do if I can this is preach first and then maybe we'll do a little singing at the end we have a daughter of the assembly amen they're here in our midst the stood roof a man thank god sister Gwyneth daughter but assisted by his daughter and I also do another ministry there and we're so glad to have her with her precious husband for the simba a man we think for them being a part of this this a man but we thank God for all things so what I want to do is I want to go to the Word of God first and then afterwards we would sing and and and there's a song that I was requested to sing they asked me to do the blood medley so we'll do that and I have to first confess before I do the blood medley I have to confess my need to ask God to forgive me publicly for something that I did privately my daughter's when we came to UK four years ago they were actually singing and I was I said girl you know you know y'all get ready y'all go out there y'all sing and you know and you know saying that's saying you know and they say well that we think we don't sing the blood will never lose his power see see you know no Danny we gonna sing the blood never lose his power and as a father I'm confessing on my own you know so they stone that song and then after the song I kind of song a few things because I was telling them not to sing that song God knows how to do things he's in control it's not about us it's all about him so I thank God for them being obedient and listening to the Spirit of the Lord and singing that song I mean we will at the end amen of the service come back and just try to have a little worship a man praising God bless you musicians thank you all so much appreciate you appreciate for the Solomon and the song leading amen the specials that went forth we appreciate that actually sister Charisse and sister Tina we're on the list to come so that means when we do come and they own the list y'all don't let them get by y'all heard I'm saying here so don't let them get by have them staying there and then you came praise the Lord thing god bless you amen can we stand for the reading of the word of God returning our Bible to Genesis 21 so with us planning to go this was a sermon that I had in my heart to take there to to the UK and and I said well since I couldn't do it there I'll do it here and you know our church has been with me on this particular journey and you all will hear some of the same things but what I find is that it always preach is different every time you you preach it and so we're just going to be obedient and just try to be a blessing a man to everyone and and I I am I'm like brother Lincoln you you love being in church and seeing other people just you know respond to the Word of God and it's a little difficult when you're going through a platform like this but nonetheless let God we're gonna let go and let God have his way so we thank God for all things amen Genesis 21 and a few verses there that we will read praise the Lord it was I want to read from verse 1 the Bible says and the Lord visited Sara as he had said a man as he is saying and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken the Sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto Him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray over what we've read dear God we thank you for the ability to read the scripture but God we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help us understand God the things that we're reading and to make it present-tense these words that were spoken years stories that occur in Scripture years ago but yet still apply to us today we pray God that you would help us to see ourselves in Scripture and that father you would get the glory and the honor out of our gathering thank you for the Saints that are there in the UK Lord in their homes streaming the service the pastor for the widow who felt that in his heart to do it this way god I pray that you would bless him and bless his church Lord in a very special way and as a whorl we are praying for healing in the land God you told us in my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways God just said you were here from heaven and you also promised that you would heal the land and God over the entire earth we need healing in the land and father we just praying that you would do that and just thank you for what you have already done and god we know that you have more in store bless our time together today as we worship a man through the hearing of the word it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated as we started our year off this year we've we're using the subject of step into the vision a man that is our title for today step into the vision and I know that this is Easter and I was blessed again by brother Lincoln because he was just preaching I noticed a man just how the Lord was leading him and I said wow that that just helps me that frees me up because usually on Easter we are always trying to kind of bring something you know that's right down the channel of Easter but but what I find as a believer Easter is everything a man Easter is not just one weekend out of the year and it changes from the calendar every year right but but for us as believers Easter is is every day hallelujah hallelujah this morning as we were just kind of sharing in our and our thought of what a resurrection this is brother branham made that statement there and the message it is the rising of the Sun and he was trying to show the church that you know yes what happened some 2,000 years ago was powerful a man it says what a resurrection that was but if we would recognize a man that we have also been quickened just the same way the Lord Jesus was quickened and rose from the grave we have also been quickened and we rose from denomination we rose from the things of the world we rose a man from from from defeated situations we have experienced a personal resurrection ourselves and brother Branham say what a resurrection that was but when you think about what he has done in you then you can say what a resurrection this is because he's still resurrected hallelujah somebody today will experience a resurrection how if you're sick in your body you can experience a resurrection you know Joe was sick in his body and Joe was the first one to ever see Easter hallelujah why he was discouraged and some of us may be in a state of discouragement we don't know how things are gonna work out but when Joe was at his worst that's when God gave him a glimpse of Easter so if you're at your worst if your sin condition is at its worst you can expect to get eclipsed of Easter what a job see said he says in the scripture says the skin worms destroy this flesh yet in my flesh I shall see God when job made that comment it's because God elevated to God about job to see a little further than where he was and what we need in this hour what we need in this season is for God elevate us and help us see beyond the virus help us see me you're on the tip the tribulation help us see me on the trouble let God elevate us so we can step into the vision glory to God hallelujah I shall see him for myself and not another glory to God jovem had a view of Easter and it came at a troubled time we need to be able to view east during these troubles times I want to just read a little statement here from the Prophet this is a coming out of the message hear his voice a man hear his voice he says now you that's turned in the scriptures the first Samuel the third chapter this is how it reads for the first 10 verses says verse 1 and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and says oh how I would like to dwell there for a minute maybe some other time it just strikes me let me just read it once again that verse and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days for there was no open vision now brother Branham goes on to say says see what a vision is then he says it's the direct word of the Lord and the Lord's word was precious I like that I like that statement a vision is a direct word from the Lord and the Lord's word was precious amen so I'm using this this title step into the vision and as we were starting this year out amen there was a number of state statements that were being made some sermons being preached we've into the year 2020 amen and look at where we are in 2020 look at how we have to have church hey man it was a it was a year of a supposed to be clear vision you know people people won't clear vision or or some people would say 2020 it's perfect fishing Loreena God but I really you know it's not and I was as I was coming into the year I had an opportunity to listen to brother to send a make a few statements there over and out and in Zimbabwe and as he was talking about the year 2020 says a person with 20/20 vision really has normal vision glory to God if you got 20/20 vision it's just normal vision it's it's nothing special about that so so anybody claiming that I want 20/20 vision you're not asking for anything special that's what everybody else got amen amen and I'm just beginning to think about that I'm not trying to be ordinary I don't want to be just like everybody else I'm not trying to be ordinary I want to be Extra Ordinary right I don't I don't need the usual amen but what I need is God to do the unusual Laurie say I'm not trying to be the same as everybody else I actually want to be different I mean I don't want to see them natural but I'm expecting God to do the supernatural we have seen oh but the Prophet told us that when we see oh he'll turn loose then we should also expect to see Oh heaven turn loose praise God I'm looking for all heaven to turn loose God will not be outdone by the devil let's it be the name of the Lord hallelujah I'm not looking Amen I don't want to see the natural I want to see the supernatural I don't want to be average I wanna be above average I don't want to just get by I want to excel we don't want to just me expectations we want to exceed them this is a year for me a double-double 20/20 double-double glory to God I'm looking for God to a double portion of his spirit a double portion of his anointing we're looking for double-double glory glory glory glory brother branham makes a statement in this message show us the father and it'll satisfy it says he can heal diabetes I love this I love this you know we were talking about this a little earlier because we have been told that most of the people that have diabetes or some other underlying conditions that I think they specifically said diabetes and high blood pressure say these are the ones that have been attacked with this virus these are the ones that's being attacked and now these are ones that are dying primarily glory to God this is what they told us and I found that quite amazing because I would think that cancer if you're dealing with cancer right now it's pretty dangerous with this virus hallelujah right but up but but we have nothing to fear amen just because that's what they say you have nothing to fear you still quote the scripture hallelujah it shall not come nigh my dwelling Oh glory to God coz I'm dwelling in the secret place all right it shall not come down my toilet neither shed this plague overtake me you keep quoting the Word of God no matter what the data says says you speak against the data say what the word says hallelujah glory but he says this he says he can heal diabetes you believe it he says standing there praying about it aren't you that's right brother you believe me to be his prophet he can heal high blood pressure to see these quotes was read before a man and it has even happen these were the things we were standing on yes this is what God brought to us hallelujah glory says it says that's brother you believe me to be his prophet he can heal a high blood pressure - you believe that sister here with your hand up was heart trouble - God or arthritis I know one oh my I wish you could if you can catch the vision a man he says this is the first that you really believe this is it not now you're believing now you got all the doubts move back the Christian spirit Oh glory the Christian spirit is over all the other unbelievers and if there was ever a part that we need the Christian spirit to override we need it right now if there was ever time we mean up the Lord before we sure do need him now let your Christian spirit oh you know well you know over happens most of the sisters use this when they go shopping praise the Lord you know and what happens is that you know they they buy something and and then they want to take it back and you know and maybe maybe they found something else so you know maybe it's a better deal or whatever they want to just take this thing back they got the receipt glory to God and they walk into the place with that receipt and now they don't show them never seek first they just show them the merchandise praise the Lord amen and when the clerk begins to argue back and forth Amen about well no this is not ours and you know and you can't you can't take this if we can't take it back it's not out oh no no this is yours I bought it here oh yeah this is Oh what now see your butt okay I take your to it here look at this this receipt shows I bought it this is the day I bought it this is the car that it went on and I'm expecting to get my money back or exchanging come on somebody so so so if that clerk has a problem doing things what the sister was says like do you have a manager is there a manager of available and as they're asking for the manager look I know look I'm not gonna waste my time talking to somebody that can't make decisions I need the manager and the reason you're asking for a manager is because you're looking for somebody with the authority a man with the ability to override what just happened if they rung up your product room you're not gonna leave their pay in the wrong price you're gonna call for a manager bring your key unlock the register and override the pricing that you gave me hallelujah is time for our faith to override every negative report it's kind of our faith to override anything the media has to sing glory to God it's time for our faith to over if you can catch the vision then your override Oh glory to God hallelujah he says that's the Christian spirit is overrode the the other unbelievers you're all inside now that's the way the Holy Spirit is supposed to work that's it if thou camps believe now as we talk about this stepping into the vision it just at the beginning of the year the Lord just begin to just deal with my heart and I just began to think about Lord well what vision because the vision is a direct word from the Lord what vision with the bride be able to step into what is it that you're calling the bride to in this hour you know we we have so much that we're we're hearing so many voices so many voices so many voices so many voices I mean every time you turn around somebody sending you this somebody sending you that it's one report say this another report completes with that when they say that's not gonna happen and and you just don't even know what to believe it's so many forces but what I found is that I can settle myself on two sources one is the Bible right I can look at what God said in his word and I can be satisfied I can find comfort I can find strength I can find hope I can find protection I can find whatever I need in the pages of the Bible and then my second source is God sent us a vindicated prophet and when he spoke thus saith the LORD I can rest my I can rest my weight on what the prophet said so if I'm going to share something with somebody I'm gonna share what the Bible say and I'm gonna share what the prophets say glory to God we could put our confidence in these sources now what is it that the bride could step into in the South what is it that that we can you know what is God's great vision as we look at this year this year vision a man that people declared it to be but what is it that we can can ultimately climb up into and surprise and the Lord just kind of led me to this message the perk of me in church age glory but the things that I want to read to you amen in the pergamene church age because I believe this is the ultimate vision for the people of God to come into a man and I believe this is the season for the people of God to come into this vision amen amen now before I read this I want you to understand the words that I'm about to read are not brother branham's words but brother Branham was told by an angel to pick up your pen and write so brother Branham became the scribe of what an angelic being was telling him to write and what the angel was telling him the right he says this has everything to do with the word and the bride match time for the bride to step into this vision now let's look at this we call ourselves bride what's the purpose of being bright let's look at this amen he says one night as I was seeking the Lord the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my painting right and I grasp the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church hey man I want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bright Lord it says here's what I'm trying to say to you now to Angel the Lord the Holy Spirit telling the Prophet here's what I'm trying to say now now notice he's not speaking this to the Prophet he's speaking this through the Prophet but to though to the pride this hat this message has everything to do with the word and the bride says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species forth after some kind even according to Genesis 111 and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and this into fruit the very same law applies to the church to take whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original see because it is the same see in the last days the true bride church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be what ain't promised now I want you to understand this is not the prophets words the angel or the Holy Spirit said this about you she will be the super church a super race and she nears him give him up because they came one time to take him away and when they came they fell back the anointed was so strong that they felt it was a shield placed around Jesus I want you to know that same seal has been placed around the Bride of Christ they can't touch you unless God allows him to control the virus King taught you let's not allows you it may look like you're surrounded but you're surrounded by him glory to God you're surrounded by promises brother when I turn it over here it says I'm gonna be healed when I turn over that says by His stripes please come wherever I turn I'm surrounded by promises so I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil with me my rock they comes with me let's it be the name of the Lord nothing to fear we're surrounded by Jesus Christ a host of angels we can keep drinking coffee drinking our tea just like the Prophet Elisha did she was worried what in the were you doing prophet this army is out here got you surrounded what are you doing man I ain't worried about nothing you don't see what I see i'ma tell you the world does not see what we said we are we're already reading we are let's finish way we have already read tomorrow's newspaper read - next week we need two years from now we already read ahead of time a prophet has laid it out so when it comes to pass nothing shocks us we go he said when the Prophet said is where the prophets say glory glory a man and for those of you that are waiting to come back to the Lord after California goes under I need you to understand that some things at the Prophet spoke have already come to pass the testimony recently given where his brother said that he was listening to the radio and brother Branham had told his son Billy Paul said before you become an old man you say he said Billy where you standing at this athlete preached the sermon choosing up a bride and it says it says you know brother Branham had prophesied that a particular system was going to die and if somebody stood up and in the meeting they come up and say thus saith the Lord because their norton's they're not fast the Lord you will not die but you'll live brother Ram said God had told me nothing different even that thus saith the Lord then move the prophet oh can I say this no matter if you're thus says the Lord in coming in line what the prophecy I'm not moving it's got to line over what the Prophet says I told you I got two sources two sources the Bible and what God said through a vindicated prophet blessed be the name of the Lord amen I appreciate anything else that may come along but I always go back to what the Bible said and what the Prophet said so if it don't line up you don't get no Amen that brother did not get an amen from the Prophet said God told me none different so brother brother Billy Paul went walking with his dad after that Nortec service was brother Branham prophesied that service about Los Angeles going under and choosing of a bride a prophesy so so he left a service in here it was walking Billy Paul just kind of walk himself out there north and and when it when he got got got outside he said bill the way you're standing say I'm standing loss and he said no be more specific son where are you standing he said I'm standing in front of me in Los Angeles he said before you become an old man sharks will be swimming where you stand well everybody interpreted that one way the interpretation was Los Angeles gonna go under and sharks gonna be swimming where the main building if it went under and the main building was under how would you know where the may building was standing how would you know or would you trust Google will Google tell you what Mays building was right right see you don't know so what happened and his brothers listened to the radio and he gave the testimony was - and this is what happened one brother listened to the radio and I believe either Virginia or West Virginia and there was another sister she was working in the maze building at the time and this was in the 1970s that this testimony came out this man was listening to his radio he's a minister there and in Virginia West Virginia and as he was listening to the radio he heard he heard on the radio I can't think of the guy what the radio announcer that's the rest of the store what's his name Paul Harvey he heard Paul Harvey say there's been a report that sharks are swimming in the basement of the maze building in the 70s now now at the same time there was a lady that was working in the building and she told one of her relatives we just got a letter from our CEO he says be careful don't go into the basement of the maze building because sharks are swimming and sharks have been reported to be swimming in our basement they got something exact they got a letter from the CEO at the time hallelujah now all it takes is two or three witnesses and every word is to be established whether Google got it or not we got two witnesses that say it happened Gloria God and that happened before brother Billy Paul became an old man that's why so if you're waiting on something stop waiting now is the time glory a man looking I want to keep going in this quote hallelujah hallelujah they in the bright would be so much like him until so much like him that they will be there will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they were produced their Creed's and their dog was mixed with the word this mongrel izing brings forth the hybrid product now the reason that Christ was given a bride it was to reproduce himself it was all about reproduction that was that's the purpose of you being a bride to Christ he wants to reproduce himself inside of you let's keep reading he says the first son Adam was to spoken see Word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God but she fell she failed by hybridization she calls him to now the first first personal Eve failed but you've been the second me do you realize you are ordained not to fall predestinated not to fall before a man this virus hit we had a spiritual virus hit glory to God you better watch God they were the spirits of violence virus hitting the land a man people stopped believing the sign and it starts sweeping the land another big church went down a man right before this virus hit already got but I'm so glad that I'm part of a people that have been ordained by God I came to this earth with a purpose and my purpose is not too far oh [Music] he came with a purpose even when God designed Eve he knew that she would fall God knew but but when she felt every attribute of God has the opportunity to be released out of cars colored but now since we have received all the attributes of God we have been ordained not too far oh I think Gough it is look at this let me go a little further the second son Jesus also had a spoken C word and remember I'm giving you what the angels saying about you I won't give all of it to you you have to read this yourself but as we're talking about a clear vision and perfect vision this is what we need to step into for this season what did the angel say what does God's vision for me here's where here's your answer right here the angel told the Prophet pick up your pen oh right he's giving you vision now look at this says the second son of Jesus also spoken C word a Word of God was given a bright like as was Adam but before he could marry her she's also she also had fallen she's like she liked Adams wife was put to the test whether she wouldn't believe the Word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died listen from a little group of the true seed of the word God would present Christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man make Reaser dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin let me keep going says the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary and this is important to me the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin now Oh Gloria let's let's keep reading it was an angel that had brought her the message but the Angel's message was the Word of God Isaiah 9:6 people feel at that time all that was rid of him because she accepted his word to her now let me just just just just just break into that just a little bit Mary accepted the word that was sent by an angel today we have accepted the word that has been sent by an angel glory to God amen now I love to just look at a couple scriptures because when Mary was born she came to earth with a very specific purpose and and I don't want to suggest leaving at Mary because when you were born you came to this earth with a very specific purpose your career is not your purpose amen many are losing their jobs in a time like this but if we lose our child it does not define who we are I can tell you this but even if I lose my job God will still make awake why because he said this word I will rebuke the Devourer for your sake amen I will open up the windows of heaven pour you out lessons when you have room not enough to receive not getting a check well your fake account would be sealed the reason your bank account is being filled it's because God made you a promise [Music] glory taka work look up from everywhere 315 and I was there 7:14 in a second but uh but brother Lincoln was saying how there was a brother in his church waiting believing God for job got so discouraged that he said I'm gonna just give up on my prayer I'm not even gonna ask God for anything more I'm just giving up on it and and here where everybody else is getting laid off this man was just sent a letter by Wells Fargo that they have accepted his application and they want to offer him this very good job in well Sparkle he gave up on it and God actually blessed him with the job during the virus okay cuz cuz god he just moving up there but he's moving right here we got a brother sitting here this morning on his job you had to have a certain level your title had to be a certain thing in order for you to keep the job everybody else was gonna be laid off but if you had this title this title or this title you could keep the job well when it came to his store he did not have the title but he got another time they forgot about this title son of God [Applause] he did not have the other titles but he had the title son of God and they let everybody else go he's the only one with that title that's keeping his job [Applause] [Music] everybody trying to figure out what happened why you did this and why you get that all I can say is God's FEMA is not there [Applause] if he is a mighty hey Tony I'm looking for heaven to turn and when all heaven empties out he has blessings in two areas he has blessings in the upper spring a lot of spiritual blessings that come down from God but he also has lessons in the nether Springs but also have a blessing to need to sustain you why you living here on earth glory to God and I'm watching God sustain his people oh yes let me keep let me keep let's look at this Mary Mary Mary came with purpose look at the scripture jim says 3:15 look at this I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed initiative bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now this scripture was was was was was produced after Adam and Eve failed after Adam did what he did that God came down said Adam where art thou and he went looking through the garden for for Adam and Eve and you know they come with this new revelation of dressing themselves and fig leaves and things like that so where you get that from who told you that you was naked who told you that so you say I'll never use language like that they had a new newt oh my god I fell in sin but it was an opportunity for God's attributes to go to work God knew exactly what he was doing but here he wrote a promise in Scripture he says I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and if Sir Bruce I had him thou shalt bruise his heel over in Isaiah 7:14 this a promise is added on to a man God gives a little bit more information it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his and shall call his name Immanuel so if there was a young lady that rose up and said I'm a virgin I have conceived and God's gonna give me a baby now if she come out with a daughter you know she wasn't fulfilling this you know she would first of all she was lying in the first place right but what we were looking for is a virgin that would conceive and bear a son so when the word was spoken even in Genesis and the word was Amen spoken again in Isaiah the word went out like this hallelujah the word just was circling the earth waiting for the right time that the woman would come along and catch this fish and when she caught it she would step into it hallelujah I want you to know that what I just read to you Amen that came from an angel came from the Holy Spirit that word had been circling waiting for people to come to the earth amen that will respond the same way Mary respond these people would say I've never heard anything like this but be it unto me according to that words do you realize when you say a man to the word because that is what mary did married mayor said mayor say now what my what matter salutation says how is this going to happen I don't know man she had very good question haha they say the Holy Spirit new language never heard that in her church before Holy Spirit the priest is not talking anything like that the Holy Spirit will overshadow you and you will conceive she said being unto me according to that word she said look this name I promise this st. Joseph promise this is what you promised me so be it unto me according to what you Jesse when Mary agree with the words brother Adam even said that that's what that's what actually brought the life when she said a man it brought life when you can say a man to God's Word stop fighting it and just say a man is gonna bring life I wrote this down this week miracles will occur when we say a man hallelujah miracles will happen because we said a man to the word Oh blessed be the name of the Lord right I mean if you don't believe it go back to the story of Hattie right Hattie right what had no money it was a depression Lori to God and here she gave a little money to Amanda that the building fund and in glory [Applause] she gave a last to the building fund brother Brandon was on the way back to give the money Oh sister had he shouldn't do that and in the god god I had to say now did I tell that I stopped the widow from giving her last well don't you stop Harry right hallelujah but now he did not tell the Prophet that he had a blessing for Hattie right he say just don't stop right now just going down to the house and visit they got down there start eating and and while they're eating the Holy Spirit came into the place Laurie brother Brandon was sharing about how to squirrel say he created squirrels hey man there was no squirrel but he spoke in the squirrel came into existence had it right as she heard that now think about this think about this you sitting in your house a man walks in and says you know what I just created a squirrel how would you think I would you be really thinking thank God that provided a rare for Abraham is the same guy he put it back in Scripture is the same God that provided a squirrel for me I weren't thinking about no squirrel I was looking for the squirrel this is the problem we sit around thinking about what we gonna do how this thing works I mean God has to inspire you God has the anoint you brother brandon was not thinking about a squirrel God just brought it to him what are you here hunting hunting squirrels he say have you ever considered this scripture if you say to the mountain be louder looping our peanut Cassady don't tell me how you can have what you say yeah I considered but I'm afraid to preach it I don't even know nothing about say have you considered that scripture what are you hunting and then brought the scripture and his experience together so now when he preached it he can talk he can really appreciate it works in each that you do but it was not sitting around meditating on this when you're swimming when you and you when you are in the right channel I can actually send something your way but who trying to make it happen it'll never happen you gotta wait on the even the Prophet told us that he could not do things before the vision paint a mentor in and to order everything had to be in place they went everything was in place then he can step in watch God manifests himself which is when he said that the the same God that provided for Abraham a ram is the same God that provided me the squares and say that's nothing but the truth because she sent a man to that he said tell to Haddie right now whatever she asked for she can have and you know what had he did Haley looked around said what should I ask for you can't the Prophet can tell you what to ask for you have to do this on your own mama can't tell you what to ask for you have to do this on your own daddy can't tell you what the ass with you got to do this on your own had it looked around sick she was poor she could actually no I said you acts with money right now I guarantee you of their many your sisters over here sick you can pray I mean you can act mother she we don't pray for a minute time she's never been heal but I guarantee if you acts for her she'll be him had he thought about it mama mom and daddy they little water bodies of war out and but mama love Jesus daddy loved Jesus my sister loved Jesus and what that what she said they have found a way to be content in the state in which they're in but my boys I'm concerned about these books God want to know are you concerned about your love that if God was to place this question in your lap what would be your response don't don't try to be a man the richest man in the world you won't be able to spin it all before the action and somebody else gonna get it you just meet God to meet your needs look at the card it's okay to have him meet your needs and live a little bit all right you know what I'm saying I believe that alone but I had to say I want the salvation and then she had them she had to word it perfectly because if she would've said I won the salvation of one boy she would only got one boy I won the salvation up to my two boys immediately because she said a man she received a blessing the Lord dropped something in my spirit and I'm speaking this before it happened I cannot speak at all but I'm gonna speak some of the God dropped something to my spirit I was reading my Bible this week and as Scripture I ran into and and when I when I when I when I ran into the scripture the Lord said send this to so and so I say okay Lord that's exactly what I'm gonna do and I sent the script over say just what the Lord told me and and went and went and we're not when I sent it they responded back amen hallelujah when they said a man then the Holy Spirit hit me again and it said miracles will occur because we say a man to the word imma say that again miracles will occur because we say a man to the word Larry responded with an a man had a right responded with an a man the person I sent it to responded with in a man Mary had a manifestation handy right hand a manifestation we're looking for three Oh glory all right let me go on a little further that's a man hey man I'll come back and explain it more later glory glory glory now let me just go a little further here because we're talking about stepping into this vision thank you Jesus let's go back to Genesis 21 we read here we read here Genesis 21 says him the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken now destruct me as I read this the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken now a few chapters before this God came to Abraham and Sarah down into the tent glory three angels visit but it's God and two angels that came to visit and gave Abraham a promise that Sarah's wife was going to have a son and and Sarah was sitting in the tent laughing he said why is Sarah laughing and he revealed a secrets of what was going on in the tent but when God came in Genesis 18 to visit Abraham and Sarah I want you to notice he came in the body of a man and visited Abraham and Sarah and gave them the promise but when it came time for the manifestation the Bible says that the Lord visits there this time he did not come in the body of a man but he came as spirit you see it's the spirit that gives us life it's a spirit that quickens us and changes our condition you know it was the spirit that got Jesus out the Great Jesus spoke certain things amen you say destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up when Jesus went to the grave it took the Spirit of God to go and connect with the promise of God and bring it to pass Mary was overshadowed with the Spirit Sarah was overshadowed with the spirit the bride to make these promises come to pass will be overshadowed with the spirit and she will be the super Church the super race she will be oh that God said she'll be you seeing Genesis 21 it was no longer a promise in Genesis 21 they had moved from the state of promise to manifestation and what I believe this is a season for the church to move from just a promise to now the manifestation of what was written on the expectation I'm claiming it for this season double double double double glory glory glory glory glory glory amen God will visit us in different ways he came in as a man the first time but he sent His Spirit to bring it to pass and I believe the Spirit of God is gonna come and bring this back bring it every promise that he meets us to pass Mary when she said Amen it was the spirit that caused that to come to pass Mary didn't have anything to do with it Oh God wanted her to do is yield all God wants you to do is you all right let me just look at a couple other things this a man oh all right yes I do I want to read this this is out of crisis the mystery of God revealing glory glory glory glory amen the word is in the bride as it wasn't married they man she's ordained not to fall look at this now that Christ is a mr. Garvin who says the church is the blood of Christ by the Spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost step baptize it's asking to his body that recognizes only his body as flesh his word denomination won't never touch that and I just love you know brother Branham what kind of talk of denomination would never produce this the denomination it doesn't matter how many members they have if you're still feasting after the army Chelsea you could never manifest what gripe like what God is looking for and brother Branham said you know he says what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is do you realize that if you were in denominational churches and you came out to this message that you have already experienced the resurrection and that's why I say what a resurrection this is you have already if you were in a man in the world in a world of sin we all came into this world speaking last but if you was in a world of sin and you come out and you hearing this message you have already been resurrected brother Adam say your resurrection lays in you now oh and he sent the same way Jesus had power to raise himself up guess what you have power to raise yourself up that's what he said I ran it this morning hallelujah and if you got powned raise yourself up that means stop crying speaking move oh yes the power is already in you and I'm waiting oh nothing they make it's already in you so use what you got glory use what you got the spoken word is in you use it Church all right glory glory glory look he says the best baptism Holy Ghost that baptizes us into it into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word it says denomination will never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so didn't even know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall she even knew it and she fell we know it and won't fall look at he says she is ordained hallelujah whoo she is ordained to not fall she won't fail as I tell you I come with a purpose that word went around waiting for Mary to come here to drop down into marriage because God had already had in his mind who was gonna be the fulfillment of genesis 3:15 isaiah 7 i was there not he already had this my network was waiting on Mary and it when Mary got here word came before she could get married to Joseph engaged before she could get married word had to drop down God had to bring it to pass before she got married hey man and then and then on top of that you know cuz Joseph when he heard this that was strange think about it not think if you was Joseph and Mary comes to you to say now Joseph I'm pregnant Joseph and meeting up there now who did this well it wasn't Mary what's going on here well let me tell you as the angel came to me I said amen to the word and he said the Holy Spirit Elish out of me and I'm pregnant Mary I love you but I don't think I would be able to go with this story so the Bible say Joseph was primarily thinking about putting her away but what God had to do is come to Joseph and give him a dream and when God gave him a dream the dream actually took him back to the word you go study the dream the dream took him back to work and when he saw it in the word it's 70 spirits so what I want you to understand is that when God gives you a supernatural experience it will settle you you are Dane not to fall she won't fail she is predestinate - it blesses a man who got will not impute sin your ministers know what I'm speaking of when there's a couple dozen of you sitting here see blessed is the man who God will not impute sin David now I want to just kind of bring out a little testimony here a man I was looking at this a man I was listening to take wisdom versus faith and in there brother Branham was giving us a testimony about Welch Evans Welch Evans had a situation where he went to church and while he was there in church he brought the car and and while he was there you know in church somebody stole Welch Evans car and and took it and left him here here he is having no way to get back home he but he had to drive a long way to get back home he wasn't right around the corner he says everything was in the car and luggage and all that and this man has gone with the car so he just didn't know what to do Welch Evans was a little concerned so they went and they they the brothers when it found brother Brown said brother branham you know Rhoda brother Welch's carbon stole while he was at church and I just think that's something that the devil would tried them Wow they at church that's a bold devil that you at church and I mean if there if there's any safe place it should be Church but the devil would come and try it even in church right so here we'll talk like I don't know what to do he said random say let's pray let's pray let's pray and as you know right before they were praying the word quickened to the Prophet and and the scripture says if you ask anything in my name if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done that quicken to the prophet so he prayed according to the scripture and said while he was a man praying a vision came and he saw the man that had toast on the he saw the man turn the car back around come and park it get out and leave it there he said conviction came on the man he brought the car back he say brother whilst you're gonna get your car the vision actually told him that he was going to get the car all brother Welch had to do is go where the vision ship said go and he went get the car that's exactly what he did he received his car but brother Branham said a couple other things say the reason that this man brought the car back he says because we sent the word after him the word was if you abide in me and my word about and you asked what you will so what I'm asking for is bringing the car back in the name of Jesus so that's what I'm asking in the neighborhood he said because the man had something on the end he said a man used to be a Christian and it's that sense he used to be a Christian the word has something to attach to and condemnation was Ceti and and caused the man to turn around and come back according to the vision but he had to step into the vision in order to give the car brother well chat another situation come up this time brother branham made a statement here and wisdom versus faith in in and and and I think I want to read this starting at paragraph 344 I want to read this one Oh says come back and said some man bought a car from him this is same brother Welch Evans he slipped off and didn't pay it now this man stole another car from brother he was selling the car the man supposed to pay him but the man slipped out without paying Oh even during this time if somebody done stole something from you God will make him bring it back even during the time this time you can expect it even now they not working but they stole it from you God will make him bring it back watch this now glory glory since he slipped off and didn't pant say brother branham I thought the poor man told him $400 I said I pray I sent the word the word went got on his track found him oh he says when we went down to find the man he never Christian see he laughed they asked him go to church one time he said Wow while the preachers preaching I'll look for pretty blonds so you see you can't find yet that's the devil that's so the word couldn't hold on to him write the word could not latch on to this man because he had a different spirit but what brother branham say the word didn't latch on to him the word just follow him you can take that down the word just followed him and the word watch wherever he went and what happened is one day a couple her brothers happened to be driving through a town they saw the car and they saw the man they followed the man to his house they got the address to call brother website hey brother Welch say we found your car the man lives at such-and-such place in the city of Bowling Green brother brother wife Sarah oh yeah he does but brother whelps never did anything to go get the car he'd say all right all right all right thank you for the information so so one day they had finished some meetings of brother branham us brother Matt Brandon and brother Welch and his wife was on the way to Florida the compass of meetings and brother Branham as he was getting ready to go God showed him a vision of brother Welch getting his money the $400 said he was Oh God showed him a vision so so in the vision he said now God showed it to me but he did not tell me to tell brother wealth what to do I had to just kind of lay some things out there and then brother Welch at to catch the mission and then step into it oh so brother man let's say for the Welch we're going through Bowling Green brother Welch we're going through bowling-green brother well we're going through bowling-green brother well speaking from brain I'm getting to talk to sister sister Evans in the car me just driving and while it wife's talking these prints a lord please let him capture lord please let brother well capture I can't tell him no more Lord please let him catch and before you northern just dropped in brothers well she said wait brother bad so yeah you said we were going through Bowling Green say yeah that's exactly right for the will say brother you know that man that stole my car took the money he lives in Bowling Green he said yes yes that's exactly right brother whoops that's exactly right he says well I want to actually question brother Brandon see the vision had already shown but he had to wait for brother Webster catch the vision and then start operating tapping into it if it was you and you was going through Bowling Green would you go get your money if it was me I would go get my money that's all it took and brother Webb went and knocked on the door and got his 400 top brother branham cannot tell him it was a vision brother Welsh had to catch it and step into it brother Raymond said now this is the type that he used this is the type that you said he said when Jesus went down to the grave of Lazarus oh yes Lord Jesus he says when he went down there to the grades of grave of Lazarus he says how he was even just kind of having a conversation with the disciples telling us that now let's go because our Lazarus sleepeth and we got it going on we got it going Carrodus and the disciples say night-night now he's sleeping let's just leave him alone don't don't wake him up let the man get some good sleep he said say no we got it going we gotta take care of something Jesus just leave look let me tell you something Lazarus is he any say say I go to wake so so so jesus said now you know a head a man down there to the city where we're landed now he's already four days late this thing seemed impossible this thing seemed like it would never happen Oh glory tuk cop I don't care what you're facing now it may seem impossible but it's not as impossible as Mary having a baby amen and being a virgin it's not as impossible as Peter the Great for four days and rising again if those things can happen anything Jesus was on his way to see Lazarus because of a vision now there were certain things in this vision that had to be set in a certain way before it would manifest see brother Branham helped us to see scripture in this light things had to be sent a certain way before things would manifest when God gave him dishes already got here Jesus goes down tell the disciples I go to wake him now when he got down there oh I love the story when he got down there they were still mourning Martha and Mary was still in a state of mourning but when Martha heard that Jesus was in town Martha decided it was a personal decision that I'm gonna get up from my situation and I'm gonna go to where Jesus is hallelujah if there's anybody can change things Jesus came so she said I'm leaving where I'm at I'm gonna stop mourning with you Mary I gotta go see Jesus and Martha come up and she got to Jesus and she just beginning say something oh can we just read it in Scripture oh let's go to Charlie Levin Oh hallelujah oh yes yes yes yes I like this amen amen he says I burst Twitter their mother as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming we didn't met him but Mary sat still in the house I want to tell you got two options you can either get up and go meet Jesus or you can sit still in the condition that you in I want to encourage you get up from where you act and go meet Jesus how do you get up from your defeat get up from your mom now get up from your sickness get up and go meet Jesus glory to God holy then said moth unto Jesus Lord has been here my brother had not died because even though she's going through this this this time of grief she still declares her faith amen and sometimes what we gotta do is believe us it's continue to declare our faith no matter what it is that we're up against she says but I know that even not statements when Coronas all over the planet not just not just in and in the United States but the UK is all locked a man in China spit on a lockdown they bent down enough in Australia they lock down South Africa Oh lock down the whole planet it's a lockdown but even whatsoever that will ask of God God will give it thee what's your faith in the mystery of pandemic Mazel begin to declare fishes I know that even now whatsoever that will ask of God God will give it thee now look at this Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again now now here's the problem Martha is looking at these words as future tips but Jesus is trying to get her to see no no no no no this is present tense I'm gonna talk about tomorrow I'm talk about God sent me here by a vision to actually bring him forth now look at this he says Martha said to him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her I am the resurrection so the resurrection is a person the person of the Lord Jesus I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall live now notice Jesus had not died but yet he claimed to be the resurrection you get that Jesus had not died but yet he claimed to be the resurrection guess what you have not died but you have experienced a resurrection when you came out of the world you experience the resurrection when you came a man out of denominationalism you experience the resurrection amen when you've been defeated in your spirit just like Joel was in his spirit Joe received a resurrection Peter received a resurrection you have received and are receiving a resurrection not rather not just what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and he left it with a question believe us how this and I love this next verse she said unto Him yay Lord that's all got me to here I believe that thou art the Christ the Son of God which had come into the world now the scriptures say we're gonna stop right there in reading but the scriptures say that he went away and she called her sister secrets that you know the math to come Mary Mary married a master come and he called it for you so this meant you know now that mountain married man Mary made a decision i'ma stay here and I'm gonna just keep crying you see when we do this penny wants a party Peter wants a party but Jesus didn't actually go to Mary Mary had to come to him and and and pretty much on the way to him she has to shake herself from the condition that she says because if you want to see a miracle you have to shake yourself out of the condition or the mindset that you're in in order to see the miracle now in this vision that Jesus had he was going to wake our Lazarus the vision was already shelter he was going to wait laughter now the problem is there was a couple people that had to do something they had to be in placed in division they had to find their place and step into this vision if you want to see your brother raised again here's what I need you to do now he never told them this oh he says it's Mary Martha roll the stone away not right now brother branham say Jesus could have rolled the stone away Jesus could have smoked the stone away they could have had some other brothers help them out to get the stone rolled away but that was not Jesus part of the vision that was not the other brothers part of the vision this was Mary and Martha part of the vision I don't care how you struggled with the stone roll it away you see the scripture action tells us that there are some things that we have to lay aside it didn't say God was gonna deliver us from it he say lay aside every sin and weight that so easily perception so we have to do some things ourselves maybe there's a storm of depression that's getting your life you roll it away rather than maybe there's a stone of a man of oppression roll it away maybe there's a stone of disappointment you roll in a way roll it away when they rolled a stone the way we saw a resurrection Jesus said Lazarus come forth and when Jesus spoke that brother branham told say if he had not called Lazarus by his name he said everything that was in the grief because the resurrection was standing pressing present tense was 10 right he said if he didn't call as if I mean everything in the Greek would have got up a man that was dead for four days came out in the green and experienced a resurrection I don't know how long you've been dealing with your situation I don't know how long you've been dealing with your circumstance but you can come forth on this Easter Sunday and have your own personal resurrection what you need to do is step into the vision God richly bless you [Applause] let's have a word of Prayer father we thank you for this Easter time thank you God that you've given us so much to look forward to their promises that have been given through the angel of the Lord directly to us your prophet wrote it down and gone here we have it in our in our in our hands a gear of vision but the ultimate vision that we could step in to Lord is what you declared through your prophet for us this message is follow is about the word and the bride help us to recognize who we are Lord to walk in the fullness of it - they meant to accept it we were ordaining not to fall so many have come with this and with that but God our eyes are on this on what you've said through your prophet we're not we're not turning in and even he said to us Lord that the bride will only do pretty much what the Spirit is revealed to her to do no nobody else can make her do otherwise that only what God has told her to do that's what she gonna do and God we're holding fast to this word we're standing on it scripture tells us that heavens and earth will pass away but the word will remain forever we're standing on the word god I pray your blessing is upon the Saints Lord that have tuned in to hear the word of the Lord today and God we just we just appreciate you for ministering to our hearts and the technology that has been given to us Lord for the word to go from from just through through the airwaves these are these dimensions Lord that we were using the Prophet told us about it this dimension of science technology Laurie say these things were here even during the days of Adam and I was just thinking to myself the way that we're doing service and streaming it is a very similar to what the Prophet was doing when he was here on earth when he preached it was the rising the Sun he had people connected via the telephone and they would hear the word of God through the airwaves of the telephone and Oh God now that we can go beyond the telephone and we can use the Internet I am quite sure the Prophet would have been doing the exact same thing at a time like this so we thank you for technology the Lord our prayer in our desire is that some they really soon that we can all be able to come together for fellowship we how we just love to be in one another's presence how we enjoy it oh God just shaking each other's hands and and being able to give a hug Lord it just means so much as things that we take for granted but God it means so much to us we pray your blessings a man upon the Saints there in the UK upon brother whispered Amen sister Gwyn Oh Lord just look upon them the family the church got all the other states that would have joined this floor

people claim it but they're not there in that secret place and I want to encourage you but again there you might say brother Jack how do I get to the secret place the scripture says repent be baptized
