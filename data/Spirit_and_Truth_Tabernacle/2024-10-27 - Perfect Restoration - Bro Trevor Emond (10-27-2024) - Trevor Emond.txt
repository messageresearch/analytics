oh God how beautiful you are to us oh God how we love you Lord Jesus we worship the name of the Lord Jesus Christ good morning if you have your Bibles turn to um Second Timothy chapter 3 we'll read verses 16 and 17 together just a wonderful atmosphere this morning wonderful time of worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ so second Timothy chapter 3 ver 16 and 17 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so there's a there's an aim or a desire that the Lord has had for us and that is that we might be perfect and how will that happen well the word of God would come to our hearts all right let's go to the Lord in prayer father as we look at your word father we realize that you've given to it to us for our instruction for our Repro Lord for all of these things but father that you wanted us to be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto good works and so father that's why we come today Lord to as as we talked Friday night about you wanting to express yourself father that as we look into the word we get to know you more and see that expression so that we can uh reflect that expression in our own lives as well father change our hearts uh just Lord may we yield to you and may you supernaturally uh give us that portion that we have need of by your Holy Spirit Lord as you promised and we thank you for these things now anoint the service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen you may be seated also would like you to turn to Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 yes sir seems like everyone probably knows what that scripture is oh my what have I just my reset my timer here there we go everyone knows what a timer is for tells you how bad you're doing that's that's what it's for so anyway um so Joel chapter 2 verse 25 I will restore to you the years the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you want to back up one verse really fast I want to focus on something for just a moment um the Lord is telling us he's going to restore and then at the end of that next verse he's going to say my people shall never be ashamed but in the middle there all these the Locust hanker worm caterpillar Palmer worm all of these things that that that have come and destroyed and taken parts of the faith away and how terrible that is and where did those come from who sent that all right read it my great Army all right which I sent among [Music] you struggle bust today my wait a second Lord like what's he talking about like he's he's telling I'm going to restore their in captivity all right right they're going to be sent to captivity but God says I'm but don't worry I'm going to restore and when I restore what I so I'm bringing this Army among you but when I restore you after the fact you will never be ashamed Hallelujah because after the restoration after the completion of restoration you can no longer be ashamed glory amen as we talked about last night we looked at Acts chapter 1 verse 6 when therefore they were therefore come together they asked him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and and also we looked at Luke 17 and verse 21 neither shall they say Lo here Lo there for behold the Kingdom of Heaven is within you and so we talked about the Kingdom of Heaven coming into your heart amen and being restored and when that restoration happens that restoration is happening in your heart and so we want to kind of look at these at this idea a little bit more this morning and uh I I didn't give a title Friday night but that was um the Kingdom of Heaven is within you amen um but this morning I want to talk about perfect restoration perfect restoration Hallelujah so we want to talk about perfection right and what does it mean that something is perfected and you know I most of you know me well enough by now to recognize that I ask questions and and I challenge the assumptions that we hold right like Perfection hello right brother Trevor's asking what's Perfection like like we're fourth graders or something like that we're just learning how to SP p e r f e c t perfect um come on brother the state of being perfect no what well what does that mean what is what is it what we're saying when we say something is perfect and is there variation in in what we mean by perfect and so often we talk about perfect as in you know uh nothing wrong you know no errors and we would say yes absolutely perfect means no errors but does that but is there more than just the the state of not having an error in it is there is there more there and so we want to we want to look at it so so let's look at Psalm umap 19:7 don't put it up there yet sister just find it hold it there because I have to ask a question before that gets displayed to everybody is the law perfect wow I instant replay cam right there show it right here yes that question what are you doing to us now this morning brother Trevor in this service like is the law perfect and you know it's like well you know who's going to say nope the law is not perfect it's like well you could you you could you could reason it's like well but you know uh Romans 8:3 you know the the what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh though the law was perfect but through my flesh you know God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh so the law couldn't do that but was the law perfect it's like yes the law was perfect so we look at it in Psalm chapter 19 and verse 7 that the law of the Lord is perfect right converting the soul right the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple so the law is perfect Glory yes hallelujah it's not it's not me it's not me saying it right the inherent God breathed inspired word of God saying the law of the Lord is perfect we're all together now that's right okay so let me ask a question now though that as we stare at this saying that the law of the Lord is perfect does so let me ask could could the law then a perfect law could it be magnified but but it's perfect pastor says yes anybody want to disagree with the pastor could the law the perfect law could it be made more honorable but it's perfect come on brother it's perfect how can it be magnified it's perfect how could it be made more honorable but I could direct your attention to Isaiah chapter 42 Isaiah 42: 21 the Lord is well pleased for his righteousness sakes sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable so what you're telling me then Isaiah what you're telling me is that that while David said the law of the Lord was perfect all right it was yet without honor wow he's going to make it honorable wow God is going to make his law honorable and so I I want to I want to bring you then to to the Jews right there at at Jesus's time they had the law and as we said last your Friday night like they had Moses culture that they developed around the law but that law was that law when it was when it was practiced and exercised by those Pharisees was it honorable amen instant replay cam right there yes help me preach now right no no it was not honorable were they but did they have the law of Moses was it like look it was perfect like right Exodus 20 when God gives the law to mooses written by the Finger of God you know then Moses what are we trying to say that Moses broke the tablets then and then when he went back to get them you know that then there were some transcription errors on the second set like no the law was perfect amen they had the perfect law but yet even if they've been given the perfect law they're struggling with it being honorable it has not yet been made honorable so Jesus comes and there he is on the mount uh uh you know preaching in Matthew Chapter 5 67 you know and he's saying blessed are the peacemakers and blessed are the merciful and they're like what what the law says eye for an eye all right the law says tooth for a tooth come on you know the law says hey you know and then and then Jesus you know you forgave that woman that was caught in adultery on and the law says she should have been stoned right the perfect law said that woman should have been stoned and then you come walking in here tell us you're the Messiah and you won't honor the perfect law but what I tell you this morning is that when Jesus came with Mercy in his heart and asked all of them if you don't have like whoever doesn't have sin you cast the first stone when Jesus said that he made the law honorable he magnified the idea behind the law he came and man he was the The Living manifestation of the entire expression of God from before the foundation of the world walking in shoe leather and now came and took the law and made it honorable no longer was it overly harsh or applied incorrectly but now the very Heart Of God was walking in full knowledge and revelation of that law displaying what it meant to the people God so the perfect law became honorable hallelujah amen amen he begins to go through the law in that Sermon on the Mount you it it has been said you know you shall not kill but I say unto you that's right but I make the law more honorable to you that he that hates his brother Without a Cause right it has been said Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you but I bring you the honorable portion that somehow you missed that if you look upon a woman with lust in your heart right that's the point amen yes sir amen so he makes the law more honorable he takes a p a perfect law and he magnifies and makes it honorable so let me ask you this was was Jesus perfect and nobody going to say no was Jesus Perfect When Jesus came and was born and laid wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in that manger was he perfect yes he was when Jesus was 12 12 and he was disputing with the Pharisees and this and and the priests in the temple was he perfect yes yes he was perfect when he was when he was filled with the spirit there and the baptism and the Dove came down God said this is my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased was he perfect yes sir yes he was yes he was but I I would like to turn your attention to Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8 and nine and you can go ahead and just throw that up there sister because I'm done asked the question already Hebrews chapter 5 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him brother brandham says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he left his church a measure of suffering too that their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so even Jesus himself as as a man is going through though he's perfect though he's sinless yet he's becoming even more perfect by the things that he's suffering that on the day like like like you could say that on the day he died and was nailed to that cross on Calvary he perfected love he was he became the Perfection of Love itself he became the full extension the full absolute expression of what it is to love because Greater Love have no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends he doesn't just ask you to do it he's already walked through it for you and so he became perfect by the things that he suffered the expression that was there in the mind of God back before the foundation of the world before he created light before he created galaxies the heart that was there in God now comes to its full expression of love and that love is now made perfect because it's fully known amen hallelujah amen because isn't isn't that just amazing yes sir yes sir because the thoughts of God are now fully expressed in human flesh my that that's that's just amazing you know amen I just I okay I have to segue here into the thoughts of God H the the thoughts of God you know when when when God said let there be light he spoke and he believed his own word and it was created right so so and we know that that the that the life that comes inside of us is the same as this Angel speaking to Mary and she believed the the word the Angel's word the messenger's word come on somebody okay and and and and believed it and it created life inside of her so so the spoken word of God creates light creates life okay so where does the spoken word of God come from well the spoken word of God then be before you can speak anything it's it's got to be in your thoughts it's and we know the thoughts of God are Eternal you know there goes my thoughts you know like how do you have an eternal thought when did that thought start you know like I just started thinking about what we might have for lunch but that just now happened but but but God's thoughts don't have a just now happen they were Eternal and I just you know I can't I can't handle that so but but so the Eternal thoughts of God but where did those thoughts come from where does where does your thoughts come from you say well you know your brain thoughts thinking happens in the brain M and so then I would ask you like okay but but where do good thoughts come from your brain because we said thoughts came from the brain okay where do bad thoughts come from your brain so is your brain bad or good ah but there's there there's an element of not brain in there right because because if you're going to say that it's good or bad it's coming from some other place in your body that is not your brain because the scripture said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he is he good or is is he bad depends on his heart so if you're if you're thinking good thoughts it's because your mind is connected to your heart so so I want to go back a second now so then where are the thoughts of God coming from they're coming from the heart of God so what we see expressed is the very Heart Of God expressed and so and so when Jesus comes and dies for you the the heart of God that existed that that that created the mind of God if I if I can say it that way just in a way that we can grasp it right is the the those thoughts that were Eternal thoughts of God came from the Eternal Heart Of God which became expressed and acted out and lived before us in the form of Jesus Christ and now wants to express through you amen the very Heart Of God coming to the believer to be expressed and this is restoration that ultimately we're talking abouten so Jesus became perfect not that he wasn't created sinless but that he became the perfect expression of the heart of God that was before the foundation of the world amise god brother Brenham goes on in the Philadelphia and church age in the church age book he says these things saith he that is true now this word true is a wonderful word it does not mean true in the sense that it is opposite to false right right it expresses the perfect realization of an idea contrasted with its partial realization right right right so we can talk about things and we could go through examples and I could leave details out and it'd be a partial realization of what happened but it wouldn't be the perfect realization well there were other people there were other things there were you know there were other things that had happened right and so Jesus is the true and so uh he says for example we recall Jesus said in John 6:32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven so so Jesus was the true bread amen right am and so so then if you're hungry which would you rather have I mean really hungry now like haven't eaten in days kind of hungry and then I were you know I were to give you the most perfect bread you know I don't know if anybody here is into the like the sourdough there's the the there's the sister Erica is not okay but I like sourdough you know but nowadays you know it's it's very trendy on all the socials you know you've got you've got groups of sisters getting together and making sourdough bread you know and they've got the little scoring knife and they're making the little designs on the bread on the dough you know and they've wrapped it and rolled it and all this stuff now and they've put it in the little basket and they've done the little designs and they stick it in the oven you know and then and then it comes out of the oven you know and it's got man it's just so perfect you know the and then and then of course you let it cool for just a little bit you know and then it's like hey get the camera you know and now we squeeze the bread you know and it's just this little bit of CR crunchiness that you can tell is on the outside but yet it sponges back when you let go and you know there's substance here man this is this is not Bunny Bread from the store you know cuz you squeeze that Bunny Bread from the store and it's not coming back so so now we're see so what we're what we're establishing here is that sourdough you it's beautiful looking it's crunchy it's it's got sponginess to it it's it's like perfect bread I mean if there was bread that was perfect it's getting pretty close to you know you could add some cheddar and jalapeno in the dough and then maybe we'd really have something you know and then man this is now we're getting as close a perfect bread as you can possibly have and if you're hungry like two days haven't really eaten and I've worked hard today kind of hungry and I were to tell you I've got some of this I could slice this bread here it's still warm out of the oven and we could throw some butter on that you know and maybe I don't know know some Peach jalapeno jam we just got some of that the other day that was really good but or maybe Nutella I don't know I don't know what what it might be and your two days kind of hungry I said here I've got this I mean as close to perfect bread as I can give you would you would you like this or would you rather have Jesus cuz I want to tell you this might be perfect bread as perfect as man can make bread this is perfect bread in your hungry but Jesus is the true bread uhhuh and it's church so you're like yeah yeah yeah give me Jesus Give Me Jesus but I want to tell you in two days time you like you want to tell me that Jesus whom I can't see and can't physically eat is somehow going to solve this hunger problem that I'm feeling very physically right now and you want to tell me that Jesus is the true bread and not that buttery squeeze spongy crusty goodness which is the true bread but I just ask you like after you eat that slice of bread and you've been two days hungry do you think one one slice is going to do it for you no one slice of that perfect bread is not going to cut it you're going to need two three four five half a loaf whole loaf and what about the next day is it going to keep you no the whole loaf in going to keep you for 24 Hours come on bro come on brother but it's as perfect bread as man can make now let me ask you something I could I could if I gave you a lifetime supply of that bread and that Nutella or whatever it is what is it for you like what would you want on it just butter or just butter okay and and some really good Farm Fresh butter uh salted or unsalted salted butter okay and I'm going to give you a lifetime supply of that but with that you have no satisfaction in I I'm going to take away Joy I'm going to take away peace I'm going to take away hope going to take away patience I'm going to give you a lifetime supply of perfect bread with butter salted Farm Fresh butter but you don't get you don't have joy you don't have peace you don't have which which one satisfies you I just want to ask you which one satisfies you not the bread not the bread so which so if if if I've got if there's hunger in my in my stomach it can be satisfied one way but true hunger that we would give up the bread for is the hunger of the heart and it's that which the true bread can truly satisfy and the reason that it can satisfy is because it is the heart of God he it is the heart of God being given to you so if you want joy you should find it in the one who can say I am Joy if you want love you might want to find it in the source where it actually came from from the one who could say I am love if you want peace and you want to cure your anxieties and all of these things well find it in the one who is the Prince of Peace Glory you see he is the true bread he is the true satisfaction he is the the true and perfect realization of the entire desires of your heart when you wake up in the morning and begin to dream about maybe the greatest vacation and how wonderful it might be and all that you might want like like it's not like you don't want to just go to the so you guys are all in Florida I you guys don't like to go to the beach I know it's so crazy you know I go and preach on the islands and no one swims and it's like but like people from Indiana like Middle America you know we come to your place to swim and you guys don't I don't understand so I don't know what the perfect vacation looks like like for you but you know like all like you you know okay you go on a cruise so you're in water but not in water and and you know and and you got all the food you know and you got the buffets and the steak that's you know I don't want a steak on the buffet I know I want you to go and cook my steak perfect right now and give me that perfect piece of meat you know and slice it down and juice is H but what is it that you're looking for in that vacation you're looking for for a break from from the monotony you're you're you're looking for that excitement what is it it's something your heart is crying for you're looking for rest what is that there something your heart is crying for you're looking for a moment of Peace it's something your heart is crying for you're definitely looking for Joy but it's something your heart is crying for so even your vacation is an is an expression of the need for Christ in your heart to satisfy your every longing now I'm not saying stoping eating bread I'm not saying stop taking vacations but to recognize where the true satisfaction really comes from for your heart is to recognize Jesus Christ is the source of all of those things because the because he is the physical expression of the true source that was there in the heart of God before all before all creation amen okay we are going to get through notes we we we got to start talking about that Army at some point in time so so so so we talk about restoration and and we see God is the true source of of that restoration but but but but we talk what's like restoration means to be to be bought back or to be restored back to an original condition that's right now now so so so I'm going to contend that our original condition is the heart of God before creation you were in the mind of God which meant you were in the heart of God but we look for in the physical re realm we start at Eden and we go oh man was perfect right was Adam created perfect oh and so we want to go back to being perfect because we realize that because Adam was perfect and he had Eve who was created perfect somehow those perfect people still fell Now Eve was deceived and Adam chose willfully went with his wife as a type of Christ that's wonderful it's beautiful right but we think okay I I want to be restored back to Adam and Eve conditioned before the fall all right is that what you're looking for all right okay so so and let me read a quote here before I asked the next question so in in the beginning when man was used used to walk in the early age with God in the Garden of Eden when the first Man was created the great Cathedrals Under The Palms you guys know what that's like he and his wife when the cool of the evening come along they come out and worship God and had a perfect Fellowship God Longs for Fellowship he yearns and he wants people to speak with him to talk to talk with him and you might sing too much or preach too much but there's never one one thing you'll never be able to overdo and that's pray and the Bible said I will let men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God and God Longs for his creature who's created in His image to fellowship with him wouldn't you love to have lived in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with them wouldn't that be a wonderful restoration Lord put me back in the Garden of Eden and in the in the cool of the evening come and walk with me Lord how wonderful that would be what a restoration that would be and I how many want to be restored back to that I mean what a perfect condition but I just but so okay but I have so is that is that what you want then that's like and is that enough is that enough remember remember it's brother Trevor who challenges your assumptions and all the right answers are no longer the right answers because if I go back to what Adam and Eve have could I fall again if I'm merely restored to what they had right then a fall can happen again amen yes sir and I I want I'm sorry I want more amen I want their condition though they were created perfect I want it magnified I want it I want it more honorable I want I want the restoration to put me to a place where I could never be ashamed and by promise that's what he said he would do but what he did so that you could get to a place that you had what Adam and Eve have but in a place where you have what they had plus the ability to never be ashamed ever again I will send my great Army among you and they will afflict you and cause these problems but the growth [Applause] the expression now becomes magnified because before in the Garden of Eden we didn't know that God loved those that were not perfect Adam didn't know that because it hadn't yet been expressed though it was there and God had it it was true that God loved those even those that weren't perfect yet nobody knew it because there was no ability yet for God to Express the full depth and width of all that his love was so he sends his great Army among them to to create a situation where it's dark and it's it's evil and it's there's troubles so that now the heart of God that was always there before the foundation of the world can come and be fully expressed and then when you get to a place now where you've come into full view of that entire expression you see all that he is now that expression can be fully realized in you and you can be in a place where you will never be [Applause] ashamed but it took the great Army which God sent Among Us wow wow to show that truth ex to show that reality and then when we come through that now we can see him in a place where we'll never be ashamed ever again brother brandham says continues that quote on he says wouldn't that be marvelous we would all like to have that time and now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship so we can have that Fellowship again amen so if we can have that Fellowship now then because because of Calvary this Fellowship has been restored back to us and we can have this Fellowship now then then why why aren't we at a place of that restoration what is it that we're waiting for why is that restoration dragging out what's what's what's the point what's going on here so okay I just ask that question and we hold that thought in our minds because we have to see something here now so so one of the things that that we as a gentile church now we want to be restored back to what the day of Pentecost I mean isn't this scripturally why God sent uh Malachi 4:5 and six what to to the fathers to the children and now the Pentecostal children back to the faith of their father because in the between in between fathers to the children now those father those children raise up and they become fathers and they have children but now something's different and so we as children of that original church have have come through all of this in the great Army the palmerworm the cankerworm the Locust the caterpillar has come through the Gentile church and caused all kinds of problems and now we need to be restored back to the day of Pentecost condition amen and so we want the gifts and we want we you know but but but but but even Pentecost as a denomination they went back to the gifts but did they have the perfect no now that's part of it we want that right but did they have the perfect no right well so then so then what did they have in Pentecost well they had Christ himself coming back to them in the spirit of God the the for of the Holy Spirit to come into the to the heart of the believer as we said on Friday night and and by that by that sacrifice you know once perfected and the the believer has no more conscience of sins right and and so the Holy Spirit now that that it's the it's a it's the spirit of God and the spirit of man that can come and change you amen amen amen and so those that that that that now can can can give you that overcoming power the the lamb spirit couldn't come on you to give you overcoming power so you kept failing yes sir sir but but but the spirit of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit I will come unto you can now come and as a kinsman redeemer take your place and you take his place and so and so so we want to be restored back to this is what they had on the day of Pentecost and I mean how many would love to be to have been in the upper room yes sir hallelujah how many wish we could have this morning a meeting that was that was the that was the same as the upper room experience am amen wouldn't that be perfect I'm gonna say that one again would because that leads you to wouldn't that be perfect yeah thank you I just needed you all to feel like you were being set up there it's way more fun Acts chapter 2 when the the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and appeared un them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance what a meeting what a time to to and the spirit of fire now upon everyone and I tell you what if I see that that's H you know I just I don't know how I'm going to react on that one you know this is going to be a great time this is the kind of this is the kind of meeting we would like to have but yet but yet Jude can come along 30 years later and say earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so though they had the Perfection of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost Why didn't it keep them even 30 years that a minister has to come along and say whoa earnest L contend for what we originally had something is wrong and Paul can say I know that after my departure Grievious wolves will come in well but if if what I had was perfect what like why are Grievous wolves even going to even going to be a problem for me right like go ahead Yap at my heels you Grievous wolf I'm perfect my God amen that's but that's what I am today right because of restoration now those Grievous wolves can Yap at our heels but they have already been exposed that the the great Army has come that the the denomination the nickan Spirit came the the The Jezebel spirit came the spirit of balum came and did all of these things in the church and Rose all of these things up and and and and and so but what was it doing because when they when they got the whole Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost then it was just like okay we've got the Holy Spirit now how do we keep this going and brother Brenham details this in the church age book how can we keep this great Revival you see a little fear he said entered into their heart they said how can we keep this great revival going so they tried to figure it's like okay we have the Holy Spirit now you know we can see in the past you know all that the Pharisees did and what they had with Moses but they kept the religion going so we've got the Holy Spirit how do we keep the religion going and so and and enter in the great army with that one thought how do we keep this going what that tells you is they didn't recognize that when they got Jesus they didn't realize that all they ever needed was Jesus that all that they didn't need religion they they they you know forgive me I'll say it but they didn't need church now I'm not saying we don't come to church but I'm saying Church isn't the expression of the perfection of our heart you come because there's gifts in your body you come to edify the rest of the church you come to be edified by the rest of the church you come to corporate worship you come because he told you to come but none of those things none of those things are what Pentecost truly meant and so what they begin to do is they begin to create systems this church isn't the system amen it better never be amen but this church CH better always be a a local body a collection of people coming together to praise God together as one body because if you're isolating yourself well that's not you know we can that's another sermon amen we'll just leave that there so but isolating yourself wouldn't be scriptural either am so what they had at Pentecost they had truly Jesus Christ but they didn't what they didn't realize and then they tried to take that and they tried to say okay how can we make this our religion wow wow and so the and but that was never what he wanted Jesus was like no you like I what you don't like you don't need religion anymore you have me don't have the religion of me just have me amen but they didn't quite understand that so God sends his army among them from the time of the Pentecostal outpouring in Acts chapter 2 to to to our very days now the spirit of nianis and denominationalism has has taken the bark off the tree have taken the life off the tree I know you've just gone through restoration of the Bride tree and you you understand where I'm at with these four bugs right and so so all of these things have happened through the Gentile Church ages now but now we're in a place where the restoration is here and God in Revelations chapter 101 the mighty Angel Christ himself has come down and when he came down he gave those seals to the seventh angel that were living in the days of the voice of the seventh angel to wind up all the Mysteries which is the restoration of who he was from way back here before the foundation of the world to recognize now that your experience with the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with your church system it has nothing to do with you know I don't care which doctrinal group you want to be a part of it has nothing to do with that but do you know Jesus do you have the Holy Spirit in your heart he wants you to follow him as an individual now he may use gifts in the body to speak a word of truth but the Holy Spirit himself is the one who will come individually to you and Quicken the word that your pastor might say unto you and make it a reality because the prophet tells us you have one relationship to God and God has one relationship to you and it's Jesus and Jesus alone so though the the Revelation may be to the to the to the body in this day but yet to you as an individual it's quickened between you and him praise God and this is the restoration this is now I want to be restored back to Pentecost but I don't want Grievious wolves to come in and be able to touch me but because of the message of the hour which is the restoration that God promised he would send now I have Jesus now I have the Holy Spirit and my people shall never be ashamed Hallelujah now okay we covered that we covered that praise the Lord all right brother Bram says have faith in God he says Along come Pentecost and measured down the gift of the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues and signs but we're just letting the big gap through let us tonight lay the measure of God down and measure the whole word of God the same holy ghost that fired the Piston back there that brought them out by faith justification same one gave sanctification same one gave the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same power the same Holy Ghost can move the church to Perfection and it will do it everything that God has promised in his word God will do it amen so we're seeing then that what this is what God is doing is moving us to Perfection now now now hang on here because because because our Pentecostal friends you know and our Baptist friends and our our denominational friends now they have they're starting to have real issues with the kind of things that we're saying here because we're saying here that it's going to move the Church of God into Perfection but don't we have Jesus all right and isn't Jesus enough come on I mean that's like asking was Jesus perfect it's like yes of course Jesus is enough like what a baited question like yes he's enough but let me ask you then if Jesus was was enough weren't the four gospels enough if Jesus was enough if Jesus dying on Calvary was enough end of story you know that you've got John 3:16 believe on Jesus Christ and you shall be saved and you've got the four gospels then you don't need the book of Acts you don't need the holy spirit cuz you have Jesus is that what you're trying to say is that all I need is Jesus is that all I need is John 3:16 and the four gospels and I don't need acts and I don't need Romans and I don't need first and 2 Corinthians cuz all that came after and I don't need the Book of Revelations like why is the Book of Revelations even in the Bible if we have Jesus I don't as a matter of fact uh you know my my chiropractor you know good Christian man goes to one of the bigger Christian churches in in the area and he's like yeah we've been doing this study on and this isn't the first time I'd even heard this you know it's it's totally a thing out there in in Christian in the Christian world and and so yeah we've been doing this this study on Revelation and he I just don't know Trevor like my it's just it's just so confusing it's almost like John had some bad pizza and went to bed and had a dream oh I'm sorry but at least he has Jesus I mean even though he'll tell me that the whole that the entirety of scripture is God breathed God inspired and uh 100% infallible and inherent but the Book of Revelation John just had pizza I'm sorry sorry I'm a little confused on which Jesus you're talking about was it the Jesus from John 1:1 that in the beginning was the word because then I want the Jesus of the Book of Revelation I want the Jesus that says he's coming down as a bride out of heaven with me come on I want that Jesus that that the Jesus I want that one God so if if Jesus if just okay Jesus died on the cross we have John 3:16 and is that enough like okay well hang on a second now we you know now we have more thoughts here on this subject well okay the Holy Spirit has now come was it enough well it absolutely it was enough for every age that they had but yet there was a plan of God Amen that God wanted to express amen and yes he expressed it through Christ but now as brother bandam tells us the Book of Revelation is the ongoing work of Christ through the Gentile ages God still expressing himself ex getting to a point now to show for even the Gentile church that though I give you the Holy Spirit the denominational system isn't how it's done all right but what I wanted you to see I it's almost as if God said what I like just as he did in the Garden of Eden okay go ahead fall and sin and all that will do is more fully express my love GL and so they're in Pentecost fine you're going to go into these denominations but all that's going to show is that the true revelation of who I am and what I want with you is not church church it's not just service it's not just doing good works but I long for relationship with you and when I came on the day of Pentecost it was about relationship but you didn't quite understand it when I'm when I created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden it was about love it was about Fellowship it was about relationship but you didn't fully understand it but when sin got in you understood my love now when I come in the Holy Spirit you didn't understand that it that it was just relationship and you didn't under you thought maybe relationship had something to do with church something to do with joining a system something to do with this is how you do relationship wow wow so he exposes all of that and now we see the full picture and now the prophet comes in fulfillments of Revelations 10:7 and fulfillment of Revelations 18 one you know and he cries out come out of her my people out of that hold and that cage of of every unclean and hateful Bird come out of her what's he saying come out of these denominations be restored back into the relationship that you had at Pentecost but didn't realize that you had but now go ahead and let a Grievious wolf try to come in to the Church of the Living God that has the message of the hour been preached to them to expose the denominations to be called out of denominations and now oh isn't Jesus enough that's what I'm talking about is Jesus is enough it wasn't the church it wasn't the understanding but it was the ma the the magnified the the The Honorable Jesus Christ that came on the day of Pentecost now to where I can never be ashamed Glory brother Jack and I were just talking about this people say you know they they there's a quote where brother Brenham says I'm a I'm afraid that we're not getting people to Christ but getting them to a theory or to a church now some people they they they want to take that quote and then they want to say I'm afraid we're getting people to a message and not to Christ well I'm sorry that's not what he said now now what because it just depends on what you mean by the message but what I'm saying this message truly came to do is to deliver me out of those denominations to expose the problems of those denominations to bring me back to the understanding of who Jesus truly was and is and will be in my life amen amen amen and that it's not church I'm not going to fall into denominations I'm not going to fall into systems Grievious wolves could enter in all they want but if you've come to the revelation of what this message has been saying to you about Jesus Christ those Grievous wolves can howl they can B they can Yap they can run but they're never going to touch a Believer with this kind of Revelation because the restoration has happened in your heart and when it was restored what they had at Pentecost that was perfect is still perfect in you and they had the start of it but now the restoration is the completion and the full realization the perfect realization of all that they had on the day of of Pentecost by God's grace we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication we've got all of it brothers and sisters oh I'm afraid that we're getting people to a message and not Christ it's impossible I might be taking them to a message culture I might try to take people to a message church I might try to take people to a message Theory but if they actually caught the message of the hour that was spoken in fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 what that's doing is getting them to the one who came down in Revelation 101 am amen that's so good glory I just love it yes sir amen he says then be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect how can you be when it's not my perfection it's not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word that he chose you you never chose him and he brought you into Christ it's the Perfection of what his word and what do we have today his word it's perfecting us oh we had Jesus yes but now we have the full expression the full Revelation before us brother Bram says in the message perseverance out of 1962 I believe that there's a church coming into that Perfection all right that Ministry of perfection where the offices and apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church then pastors and teachers so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that and I believe that we're nearing that time now believe that it's so now he's there those pastors and teachers are going to be so with the word right right right cuz you're going to be with this word which was enough but in this word I don't know there was a a revelation 18 that said come out of her my people well why should we come out of her well that's a great question why why aren't we a denomination why why should we come out of denominations oh well because here here's what I'm going to do I'm going to fulfill Revelations 18 and tell you my God and so so so so yeah I'm going to need this message I'm going to need this message for that Ministry of perfection brother am glory to God so so it it just becomes obvious at some point in time like what we're is is is is how can brother brandham say this that the church is coming into that Perfection well it it's it becomes obvious now as we look at this like if the Perfection is what they had on the day of Pentecost why was there so many denominations why was there so many problems if Pentecost was enough if Pentecost was truly you know the the full the full picture then why were why did the Catholic church in the Name of Christ kill 68 million people I I think they should be ashamed but my people shall never never be ashamed amen so we needed something then if that's what the expression of Christ was after the day of Pentecost in through the Dark Ages was to kill 68 million people actually probably many of them the true Christians then I think we needed something to come and restore but God sent that Army amongst us that he might expose the problem problem s to show us the truth so that we have the the full picture now so my people will never be ashamed and so as we kind of bring this down to a close here because the timer is telling me that I should do that that kind of thing I I just want to say like as we as we we marry this up from what we talked about Friday night that this restoration is happening within you and and we focus so much on the restoration out of us right we focus so much on making sure that the flesh is restored and we for instant replay cam okay and we don't right we focus so much on that but we don't focus on the restoration of the Kingdom of Heaven within you in the heart but if what we're trying to restore is the is the the the the the the spoken word of God which was the thoughts of God which was the heart of God being expressed then why is it it's like well I want the restoration of the heart of God on my flesh like amen yes but I don't want to put it on my flesh and not have the restoration of his heart be the restoration of my heart so do you want the bread or do you want Jesus do you want the the the this the the perfect sourdough with the butter or do you want the heart of God to come into you to understand that he desires that relationship with you to flood you to fill you with love to fill you with joy to fill you with peace to fill you with the assurance and the confidence oh but but brother Trevor a tribulation is going to come I don't care I won't be here but brother Trevor all of these problems and you know the economy and you know we could go into the political Litany of all of the things I don't care Oh but brother Trevor look look no don't brother Trevor me is Jesus Christ filling your heart with joy is he filling your heart with peace but brother Trevor like the finances lately is he filling your heart with peace is the source of peace the finances or is it Jesus is the source of curing the hunger bread or Jesus that's what that we're talking about the heart a God has a heart from the foundation of the world and he wants to put it inside of you and the way you're going to get it inside of you is the re ation of the Holy Spirit to take this word into your heart and let it come to life let it start start just showing you you know hey people in the Bible had Hard Times how did they get through it cuz God was there they went through hard times yeah yeah it happens I got I got a okay so praise God that's what we want we want the we want the restoration but I don't want the restoration to just happen and be theology come on what are we restoring the heart of God what are we expressing the heart of God but now we have it in a way though though there was an expression on the day of Pentecost we have it now in a way that will it's the perfect picture now this is restoration now I see through a glass Darkly but then I shall know even as I am known the picture has become clear because we've been given the message but we had to go through those that he had to send that great Army amongst us so that he could make the picture clear so here we are living in this restoration and brother brandham finishes the thought in the Philadelphian Church age in the church age book since this word indeed expresses perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization ism Illustrated in these verses we can Now understand as never before the anti-type contrasted with the type and substance substance in your heart with Shadow take the example now Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from heaven for Israel but that bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate it were hungry again the next day it was left around and became contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from heaven where of Mana was just a type and if any man eats of that bread that came from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no need any longer for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here was the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God is he is God amen amen in the laty and Church age out of the St book he says what great love the age that age manifested for him it reminds me of those beautiful words of 1 Peter 18 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us right but one day oh can we break out of the limiting senses but one day it will be face to face that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be light be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him wondrously like him Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the atoms we will put on immortality we will all we will be all swallowed up in life then will we will realize realization how beautiful man with a seventh grade education wrote this he had Dr Le veil's help but but how beautiful is that thought right realizing realization musicians you can come so this this this realization though this this restoration this Perfection it starts in your heart it it comes into your heart we we we spent so much time trying to externalize it on to people but it comes in your heart and when it in it's truly in your heart it begins to it begins to break out just as one day we're going to be breaking out of these limiting limiting senses like like your heart is is is breaking out of its limitations and it's changing your very body it's changing who you are because it's changed your heart and so the the that that if you're going to pursue something if you want this Restoration in your life then then dive into the word of God and then dive into this message and and in a sense not Lord how am I doing on my on my flesh but father is my heart seeing Lord as I read this as I as I hear Brother brandom preaching as I hear Brother Jack and the different ministers preaching am I hearing the heart is it changing my heart even if he's telling me you're not look at how you're do look these things you're doing in your flesh like come on it's not just stop doing it in your flesh but you should begin to think Jesus why is he saying this to me is there something about what he's saying that's that's different in my flesh which is actually something that's going on in my heart God what's in my heart that's what I want to see that's what I want to change because if it'll change in my heart then then the restoration is already done and then the flesh doesn't matter near as much amen amen shall we pray Heavenly Father Lord we look at this complete restoration father we look and we see that you have done things throughout all ages ages father and I was just thinking father about Lord what it must have been like to be a believer in all of these different ages as the great Army has been sent among and um Lord I I can say I'd rather live in this age than have been in one of those ages father but even then father they there were people that had the truth of the Living God in their hearts but father they had to walk through these times but they did it with you and so all was well and so father there's times that we're walking through there are uncertain times there's a nervous complex age that we're unsuited to live in father but through all of that you restore our heart and because you restore our heart you restore our mind Lord and our thinking be can be can can be clear because we have this perfect word this perfect truth [Music] Lord and we know the truth and it sets us free so it sets our our thinking free so father though anxiety would try to creep up but father yet we're we're we're just wrapped up in love Lord we're wrapped up in our heart of love for you and so father we we we're just not ashamed anymore Lord because we've been restored we've been restored by the heart of God and Lord how beautiful this picture is and I'm thankful father that you opened our eyes and our hearts and our understanding to see this oh God bless us Lord as we continue on in our lives waiting for your your soon coming Lord which we believe is nigh at hand Lord we we do ask father that that you would develop our uh that our Revelation would grow father your your Prophet said we should pray for Revelation more than we pray for anything Lord and so Lord we pray for Revelation this morning that you would open our eyes even further Lord to these truths that our hearts Lord God would be restored the Kingdom of Heaven taking place in our lives Lord we love you and we Praise You In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen amen bless the Lord oh God and renew the right Spirit within me stand and

brother Trevor is he was telling me early in the year that the Lord had given him a sermon I said brother I think it' be uh perfect uh for you to come this year and to minister that because this is the theme uh for this year and where we've been in our journey is uh talking about the four life Messengers that have come to bring life back into the church and I love how he just he caught the same thing I caught my great Army which I sent among you you know God allowed these things to happen because it was going to be a full expression of himself to us amen as uh as we learn you know from from history we won't repeat the same mistakes but uh we've been in this journey and when talking about the four life Messengers uh Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals but it does not stop with the Pentecostals when they came with the gifts it goes into the complete word that's been brought back to us you understand that that God brought this to us and we we're we're privileged people to be able to see amen what the prophet taught us we can see these things and we know we won't repeat the same mistakes praise God we won't repeat the same mistakes we've been taught this is why we're not concerned about some Grievous Wolf coming in hallelujah hallelujah there's a there's a quote where brother random said she has ordained the second Eve she is ordained not to fall amen praise God the first Eve f this second Eve is ordained not to fall because she understands her place in the word oh blessed be the name of the Lord I I'm so glad that this you know the thought that I that I believe God was just bringing to us this entire weekend was that he the the the the fullness of this is God wanted to express himself through us that was God's ultimate plan he wants to express himself through us and we got to bring oursel to a place where we just yield to what God wants to do in in Us in and through us look it's not about like he said it's not about the the the church that you go to no it are you having a relationship with Christ the ministry that you under are you having a relationship with Christ that's what it's all about it's Christ in you and that's more than enough amen God bless you brother Trevor amen God bless you oh hallelujah amen had a um um I guess it's just a statement here but from uh Pastor uh Seth Arma again we appreciate him and his wife sister Rosemary they've been here he he he he he he uh surprised us on last week and just kind of came and and sat in the sanctuary and you know I'm like I didn't even know he was here till I looked up and that's brother Seth but uh he preached for us on on on Wednesday night and and one of the things that brother Seth did on Wednesday night he it's just something that um I just like how him and brother Trevor um one of the things brother brother uh Seth told us he says rally around the gift don't fight it rally around it right and um and and some of the saints that were not here on last week uh all I can tell you is that the Lord visited us Amen in a very special way and everything that we've been preaching of Joel 2 we saw manifested on last week amen and and like one brother said God is not a one hit wonder amen this is for me this is part this is the restoration this it is what it is and uh so I expect God to do exactly what he what he promised and uh and he certainly did that last week you know brother Seth was here and and and then you like I said brother brother tror coming and picking up saying it's about the word had gifts but they rejected the word amen they rejected the word not us we justification the gifts word all that's part so Seth you know he was encouraging us Wednesday night he he said praise my precious brother sisters myself and my wife Rosemary want oure and thanks Lord sh us and the Hand of fellow enjoy from you he says keep the around the gift all the time and the Lord will reward you greatly says we want to say bye by until we meet again brother Seth God bless you brother Seth sister Rosemary amen we we certainly than God for you and um may God just give you go back home to God uh to Fellowship the other night and they realized brother Trevor had gone to GH multiple times and and uh when he when he went he got all around so uh brother brother quu said no brother this is a real missionary this brother's said when I go to Ghana I go to timma that's City big city that's like like where brother Seth lives in you know a you have to fly into a that's big city but brother Trevor he get out in what we call the bush right and uh so brother brother brother uh brother brother uh quu said I'm going have to call you King brother because of some of the travel and what he's done there in in in Ghana so we we thank the Lord just for just the way that he kind of makes these connections uh just a wonderful God that we serve but we want to wish amen our precious brother's precious wife traveling mercies as they go back home may the Lord continue to keep them until we meet again amen We Trust like it used to be said um if if if if we don't see each other Amen on this side we meet you in the morning praise God Amen praise the Lord amen let's have a word of Prayer amen as we prepare to close the service father we are so grateful uh for what we see that you have done we we're looking back through the lenses of a prophet and we can see the history um I I just can't help but think that when you created Adam and Eve in the beginning the prophet told us that you designed Eve a certain way that you knew that there would be a weakness there God that she would uh she would fall but in in that and in bringing these things to Adam this would be the perfect opportunity for you to begin to express yourself to mankind Lord and from the days of the Garden of Eden even until now God we have been receiving an expression of of Jesus Lord if we could just see it individually and what you've been trying to do every trial that youve taken us through this whole journey of restoration the the the church had to go through that that process where the cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the caterpillar and Locust would have to come in the church had to go through that process in order to get the full expression of God manifested in us this is why we will never be made ashamed Lord that the testimony of of of overcoming and always greater than what we actually went through so father we we thank you for this and and if we can see this Amen in the history of the church then also let us look at it in our own personal lives God we've gone through some Seasons where it it feels like the the enemy has just run uh just eat up all the life but God there was a little life laying down in the stump in the roots of the tree praise God and Father I believe the scripture say just when there's life in the in in in the roots in the in in in the in the Lord the stump just a little scent of water God the life begins to come back up Lord and that's what we're feeling right now father and Lord we we're thankful that we're part of this great process that we can see ourselves in the midst of it Lord may we just remain humble and as as uh brother Trevor just referred to the quote we never want to get to the point where we're trying to control how you do things and and we got to we got to watch watch this we got to protect that and we no no Lord we just want to remain humble Amen in your presence and allow you to do all that you have promised that you will do in our midst father we thank you for your word we thank you for both your servants coming this way brother Seth Lord uh who passed our way on Wednesday and the pal of restoration and and Father Here Lord Brother uh Trevor coming back to today with perfect uh restoration Lord we we appreciate these men that are rallying around this inspiration father that you've given this church for this season Lord we we ask that you would bless their Ministries that God you would just continue to use them Father For Your Glory and for your honor give traveling mercies to brother Seth and and sister Rosemary they get ready to go back to Ghana Lord give them Lord let them find their home in the same state in which they left it father Lord Brother Trevor he has one more service God that he'll preach and I pray that you would use them amen tonight and there in Borton reach anoint him aresh even now God is our prayer and Lord as he and his wife were prepare to go back home on tomorrow father go before them and bless Lord uh their Journey father I pray amen your blessings upon the church and Lord may we just continue to walk in this inspiration that you've given us and father may may we continue to come it with hearts of expectation that you continue to meet us Lord in the way that you promis keep us until we're able to come back together again on Wednesday night father in in Jesus name we pray amen and amen let's give the Lord a hand of praise glory
