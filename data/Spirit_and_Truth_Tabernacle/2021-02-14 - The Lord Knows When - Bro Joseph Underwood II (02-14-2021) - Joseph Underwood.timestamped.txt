[47:51] brother simba and sister ruth um
[47:54] last night had a baby boy
[47:58] uh early this morning i guess i should

[48:35] and man and uh his wife assist melissa
[48:39] uh their baby in prayer they're trying
[48:41] to get back home and

[49:10] such as would be saved amen we thank god
[49:14] for all things
[49:15] uh also on um i mentioned this on
[49:18] wednesday night that we
[49:19] we were notified amen i think it's our
[49:23] duty
[49:23] once we are notified that uh that
[49:26] someone had come in contact
[49:28] uh very close contact someone in our
[49:30] church came in close contact with
[49:32] a family member that was diagnosed uh
[49:35] with
[49:35] a positive test of uh covet
[49:39] so uh what we decided to do we were
[49:42] trying our best not to have to shut
[49:44] church down we don't want to see no
[49:46] outbreak here in the church so
[49:48] some saints are uh quarantining and
[49:50] that's perfectly fine but those of us
[49:51] that are in the
[49:52] inside the house what i encourage
[49:54] everyone to do just so that we can
[49:56] prevent any outbreaks
[49:58] amen so we can keep coming to church we
[50:00] ask everyone please wear your mask while
[50:02] you're inside the sanctuary
[50:04] uh this would just really help us so
[50:06] that it does not spread
[50:08] here you realize that that's what the
[50:10] devil want to do is just let something
[50:11] spread and just shut the church down
[50:13] right we're trying to stop that we're
[50:15] really trying to stop that so we're just
[50:17] asking everyone just for the
[50:18] next you know week or so please wear
[50:20] your mask while you're here until this
[50:22] thing just kind of passes
[50:24] we were told of a positive test so we
[50:26] want to
[50:27] uh respond appropriately amen to that so
[50:31] bear with us amen just get through this
[50:33] little season then we can
[50:34] be free again amen praise the lord
[50:37] but we're happy to be here today a man
[50:39] and uh

[51:08] testimony
[51:09] uh we've heard different parts of it uh
[51:12] but now we see a manifestation of it

[57:20] him had praise the lord so he's getting
[57:23] better
[57:24] hey man as he gets older um
[57:27] many of you all were here uh i believe
[57:30] was two years ago
[57:31] just two years 2019. when brother nathan
[57:35] bryant was here and uh
[57:37] brother jack you were hosting us the
[57:39] services um
[57:41] in june and i remember
[57:44] when we came i came up here to sing a
[57:47] special and
[57:48] i think i made my wife a little nervous
[57:50] i told everybody keep us in prayer
[57:52] we believe in the lord for a child and
[57:53] uh i remember she uh
[57:56] when we got in the car later on that
[57:57] evening she was i wish she didn't do
[57:59] that you know
[58:01] and she was like you know telling all
[58:03] our business out there you know
[58:04] everybody looking at us and
[58:06] i told her i said you knew who you
[58:07] married you know so
[58:10] you got i didn't surprise you i hope you
[58:12] know and uh
[58:14] so but uh later on in that service that
[58:16] evening uh brother
[58:17] uh jack and brother nathan uh there was
[58:20] a prayer line here and i
[58:22] believe the instructions were that uh
[58:23] when you come across that
[58:25] uh you come across from one side you uh
[58:28] after you get prayed for it you just
[58:29] thank the lord all the way to the other
[58:30] side
[58:31] amen and then you go to your seat on the
[58:34] other side and so
[58:35] we came in the line and uh brother
[58:37] nathan i prayed for
[58:39] me and sister rebecca and uh you know
[58:42] it's very important that we pay
[58:43] attention to the details
[58:44] amen you know if the lord i have a
[58:47] specific instruction you got to follow
[58:48] the way the lord
[58:50] you know lay it out and some people want
[58:51] the blessings of god don't want to uh
[58:53] be obedient to the instructions amen so
[58:57] you know i i we were coming through the
[58:59] line and when we got done getting prayed
[59:01] for
[59:02] my wife she was walking in front of me
[59:03] and she was about to go down the middle
[59:05] island
[59:05] but jack pulled me said whoa brother joe
[59:07] come here come come come come back
[59:09] and uh he said uh you know we want you
[59:12] to walk all the way across
[59:13] and praise the lord and then go to your
[59:15] seat now i see i think was right there
[59:17] with brother solomon sitting
[59:19] so we had no no need to go that way you
[59:22] know
[59:22] we could have just walked right there
[59:24] and so uh i grabbed my wife and said
[59:26] honey let's go down to the end we
[59:28] just thank the lord walk down to the end
[59:30] and man we can't walk all the way down
[59:32] some people want the short way now
[59:34] oxtails don't taste the same in the
[59:36] microwave
[59:43] so we took a longer route and um
[59:47] you know by going to the longer route
[59:50] there
[59:50] as i began to make my way back around to
[59:52] the seat i just said lord i already
[59:54] believe
[59:55] it's already done so
[59:59] we uh at the end of that service or tour
[1:00:02] i almost forgot brother nathan actually
[1:00:04] said uh here in the prayer line i almost
[1:00:05] forgot i got to go back
[1:00:07] he sent a prayer line he said by this
[1:00:08] time next year you have
[1:00:11] your child you know i don't mean nothing
[1:00:14] to a whole lot of people you know you
[1:00:15] just want to be prayed for
[1:00:16] you just want to see the promise of god
[1:00:18] but uh you got to pay attention to the
[1:00:20] details and
[1:00:22] um so i i got in my seat and i just
[1:00:25] began to think
[1:00:26] by this time next year i kept thinking
[1:00:28] how much time we had
[1:00:30] and the time was pretty short there so
[1:00:34] we get out to the parking lot brother
[1:00:36] nathan or not brother nathan brother
[1:00:38] martin dasslin at the boynton beach
[1:00:40] church i came over to
[1:00:42] me and my wife and he said do you want a
[1:00:43] boy or girl
[1:00:46] and uh i said well brother we'd just be
[1:00:49] happy with it whatever lord he said no
[1:00:50] no no he said the lord told me to come
[1:00:52] over here and ask you guys you want to
[1:00:53] borrow a girl
[1:00:55] uh we were standing there and uh
[1:00:59] i said i don't want no girls i won't
[1:01:00] have to kill anybody
[1:01:04] so uh he looked at rebecca he was like
[1:01:07] you on the same page you want
[1:01:08] a boy and so rebecca said yes so
[1:01:12] i went back home and i became like john
[1:01:15] ryan i started telling the church that
[1:01:16] the lord is going to give us a boy
[1:01:18] amen and the first month went by
[1:01:22] and you know i didn't i didn't see i
[1:01:25] didn't see anything so
[1:01:26] i started saying well we we ran out of
[1:01:28] time here you know he said by this time
[1:01:30] next year so the second month
[1:01:32] went by and nothing happened
[1:01:35] i said lord i believe you know uh we the
[1:01:37] clock is ticking down
[1:01:39] so we got to the third month and i
[1:01:42] thought for sure the third month you
[1:01:43] know because
[1:01:44] it takes nine months to have a baby so
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:47] we went the third month and nothing
[1:01:49] happened
[1:01:50] so they'll try to discourage me and um
[1:01:54] made me think like uh you know maybe
[1:01:56] it's not
[1:01:57] the that exact time frame maybe sometime
[1:02:00] in the next year
[1:02:02] so i didn't say anything my wife was
[1:02:05] kind of depressed but then the devil
[1:02:07] attacked and she got in a car accident
[1:02:10] in the middle
[1:02:10] in the beginning of october her car was
[1:02:13] totaled she was hit on the driver's side
[1:02:14] some of you all heard the testimony and
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:17] went to the hospital and of course first
[1:02:19] thing they asked before they take the
[1:02:21] x-rays on the mri they said uh are you
[1:02:23] pregnant and we i think
[1:02:25] rebecca maybe uh tested that morning and
[1:02:28] she said no i'm not pregnant so
[1:02:30] of course they gave her the special dye
[1:02:32] and had her take the mris and the x-rays
[1:02:34] and
[1:02:36] there was nothing uh we just thanked the
[1:02:38] lord that he protected there was no
[1:02:39] broken bones or
[1:02:41] you know anything really really severe
[1:02:43] at least that they could find in the
[1:02:44] x-ray that
[1:02:46] might impair her for the remainder of
[1:02:48] her life and so
[1:02:49] um we just thanked the lord for it and
[1:02:52] we're preparing a trip to go to canada
[1:02:54] um to see her sister
[1:02:56] her sister there and we had to come here
[1:02:58] to miami to get her passport
[1:03:00] and on the way back home brother westco
[1:03:03] and calling us he said hey i just felt
[1:03:05] led to call you and i tell you that
[1:03:07] you and sis rebecca need to get a hotel
[1:03:11] and turn off the cell phones
[1:03:15] don't turn the tv on and just stay in
[1:03:18] there
[1:03:18] until you have a baby and don't come out
[1:03:22] and uh i said granny you told us you've
[1:03:25] been telling us this for the past eight
[1:03:26] years almost saying like
[1:03:29] he would call you know periodically and
[1:03:30] try to give us that as advice he said
[1:03:32] okay he said well
[1:03:33] have you done it yet and uh
[1:03:36] i said yeah yeah we've done that a
[1:03:38] couple of times
[1:03:41] he said uh we'll do it again
[1:03:44] you know until until it happens so i
[1:03:46] said all right i'll take your advice
[1:03:48] and um that was on wednesday we were
[1:03:50] riding back home
[1:03:52] and then on friday morning uh about six
[1:03:54] o'clock in the morning i believe rebecca
[1:03:55] woke me up in a panic i thought
[1:03:57] something happened
[1:03:58] and she had uh went i don't know what
[1:04:00] maybe led her to go check
[1:04:01] or test but she tested positive for
[1:04:04] being pregnant
[1:04:06] and uh
[1:04:09] [Applause]
[1:04:11] we were we were i was excited but you
[1:04:13] know i i said
[1:04:14] let me go run by the store um today and
[1:04:16] i'll pick up some more tests and say you
[1:04:18] know yeah
[1:04:19] i'll take some more tests you know i
[1:04:20] want no false positives you know
[1:04:22] got to be certain of god you know i want
[1:04:24] to make sure so uh
[1:04:26] we went and i bought a ton of tests i
[1:04:28] don't know i probably was new to
[1:04:30] the whole thing i think the cashier lady
[1:04:32] was looking at me a little funny i had a
[1:04:34] lot of
[1:04:34] a lot of tests there i was like you know
[1:04:36] go take this one
[1:04:37] a few minutes later go take this one
[1:04:39] it'll take a little we was like lining
[1:04:41] them up bro jack
[1:04:42] positive positive positive positive
[1:04:44] positive and so um
[1:04:46] we found out we were having a baby we
[1:04:48] were so excited
[1:04:50] and um we went to the
[1:04:54] i don't know what they call that they're
[1:04:56] not the doctor but the ones who checked
[1:04:58] tried to find out the gender for you and
[1:05:00] uh we went
[1:05:01] and uh she said well it's too early to
[1:05:04] tell
[1:05:05] what we haven't but she said oh there's
[1:05:07] a baby here and
[1:05:09] she helped kind of identify maybe a
[1:05:11] condition that would have prevented us
[1:05:13] from having children at all and she
[1:05:15] thought it was very
[1:05:17] very interesting that we were able to
[1:05:19] get pregnant you know
[1:05:21] i said well it's not interesting to us
[1:05:22] we serve a mighty god amen
[1:05:25] amen so we we we weren't uh interested
[1:05:28] in in the doctor's opinions we got god's
[1:05:30] word we were okay
[1:05:31] um and uh so she said you know we can't
[1:05:34] determine i said it's a boy
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:37] and i went back to the church brother
[1:05:38] jack i put my own ministry in the line i
[1:05:40] told i told the church that i
[1:05:42] i know dust said the lord it was a boy
[1:05:44] you know i could i probably wouldn't be
[1:05:45] preaching here this morning
[1:05:49] but some people take these things
[1:05:50] seriously you know you never get to
[1:05:52] preach again you say don't say the lord
[1:05:53] and they don't kind of pass it
[1:05:55] that's the end of the song they don't
[1:05:56] you know you don't get to go past that
[1:05:58] but i
[1:05:59] i was so sure uh of what had happened
[1:06:02] here that night
[1:06:03] you know my faith was anchored and
[1:06:07] when we went back later on we went to
[1:06:09] the doctor
[1:06:10] and uh we were going to find out the
[1:06:12] gender and rebecca was all excited she
[1:06:14] was like what if it's a girl i said it's
[1:06:16] not a girl
[1:06:18] i was certain i was picking out boy
[1:06:20] names i let her pick out the girl names
[1:06:22] i picked out all the boy names and
[1:06:24] um we got there she looked at that
[1:06:27] picture she was like
[1:06:29] wow i was alright cut the theatrics you
[1:06:32] know we
[1:06:33] we don't we're not doing no gender
[1:06:35] reveals she went you know how to ask you
[1:06:36] wanna
[1:06:37] you want us to hold this and i was like
[1:06:39] no we're not we
[1:06:40] we're old-fashioned just go ahead and
[1:06:41] tell us what it is she said that's a boy
[1:06:44] i said well praise the lord we already
[1:06:46] knew that thanks for confirmation
[1:06:48] and uh when i came back to the church
[1:06:51] and i told him to testimony he was a boy
[1:06:52] nobody clapped or said anything
[1:06:55] everybody was looking and they just
[1:06:57] couldn't believe it because it was so
[1:06:59] surreal in that
[1:07:00] moment and you know we went through
[1:07:04] we weren't sure if i would be able to go
[1:07:05] to the hospital for the delivery
[1:07:07] it's an experience so i probably won't
[1:07:09] be in the room twice for the jack
[1:07:11] i've seen enough
[1:07:15] i'm okay now it's one of those things
[1:07:18] where you're like man i want to be there
[1:07:19] now i'm like
[1:07:20] nah that's all right that's all right
[1:07:23] let the doctors do what they do you know
[1:07:26] i'm not a doctor you know
[1:07:28] i'm i'm just a husband so but uh
[1:07:31] you know um we i was there and
[1:07:35] we thought that there might be some
[1:07:36] complications because of the condition
[1:07:38] that was in the
[1:07:39] original x-rays rebecca delivered that
[1:07:42] baby in two hours i said
[1:07:44] good job i was so happy
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:50] she she got mad at me uh first hour
[1:07:53] i went to sleep
[1:07:56] i didn't know how long it was going to
[1:07:57] be there so i put my feet up took my
[1:08:00] shoes off and
[1:08:02] put ice with the two blankets and extra
[1:08:05] pillows
[1:08:06] and rebecca she's like how could you lay
[1:08:08] down
[1:08:09] i was like i don't know
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:13] when he was born he was born i was eight
[1:08:15] pounds
[1:08:17] eight ounces three ounces
[1:08:20] i just remember he was born
[1:08:24] that's it that's all i remember and uh
[1:08:26] you know he's here with us this morning
[1:08:29] you know some of us don't know don't
[1:08:31] realize this but
[1:08:32] remember the attention is in the details
[1:08:34] you know he was born on june 24th but
[1:08:36] jack you had the meetings in june
[1:08:38] and brother nathan said by this time
[1:08:39] next year in the same month
[1:08:42] amen that's not coincidence
[1:08:46] yeah man no that i mean a lot of things
[1:08:48] we want to put it off the chance but you
[1:08:50] know this this is
[1:08:52] uh the manifestation of prophecy amen
[1:08:54] you know a lot of people they
[1:08:56] they talk about prophecy they say oh i
[1:08:57] believe the message i believe this and
[1:08:59] that
[1:08:59] but then what do you do when prophecy
[1:09:01] come to you amen how do you respond to
[1:09:04] a prophetic word that comes to you you
[1:09:06] know because
[1:09:07] i can preach all day and i can tell you
[1:09:09] my testimony
[1:09:11] but the word of the lord is for you and
[1:09:13] so you know god wants to know what are
[1:09:15] you going to do
[1:09:16] when this word come to you i'm just a
[1:09:18] preacher i'm just a vessel
[1:09:20] he's using pastor is just just a vessel
[1:09:22] he's using
[1:09:23] but it's up to you the outcome uh
[1:09:25] brother brandon i was reading a quote
[1:09:26] brother branham
[1:09:27] uh he was talking about uh he was uh he
[1:09:30] called out a sister i think it was
[1:09:31] sister virginia i
[1:09:33] i don't know if i read that quote here
[1:09:34] in this church i feel like i read it
[1:09:35] here
[1:09:36] it was a sister virginia and he had
[1:09:38] called out a condition that she
[1:09:40] she had and asked if she believed and
[1:09:42] she didn't respond
[1:09:44] and because she didn't respond there was
[1:09:46] another brother in the audience who had
[1:09:47] a similar condition
[1:09:48] and he responded brother thomas and so
[1:09:51] brother brown said
[1:09:52] y'all don't be like sister virginia she
[1:09:53] just missed it
[1:09:56] he said we don't want to be like sister
[1:09:57] virginia right in the same circle now
[1:09:59] for some people that would offend it
[1:10:00] since the virginia probably got up you
[1:10:01] know
[1:10:02] she was a black woman i don't know she
[1:10:04] might have had an attitude wanted to
[1:10:05] leave that service
[1:10:06] he said but don't be like sister
[1:10:08] virginia she just missed it
[1:10:10] this one this one over here this brother
[1:10:12] he got it
[1:10:14] it was intended for assistant virginia
[1:10:17] but because she didn't respond to the
[1:10:19] prophetic word
[1:10:21] it was given to somebody else
[1:10:25] same service same service
[1:10:28] same service somebody somebody this
[1:10:31] morning you might be believing god for
[1:10:33] something
[1:10:34] all right and god he wants to know where
[1:10:37] you respond
[1:10:38] it may not even be a directed word to
[1:10:40] you but if you can plug in
[1:10:42] and respond to it ask myself i said i
[1:10:45] wonder how many people that night
[1:10:46] here had the same exact wanted the same
[1:10:49] thing i wanted
[1:10:51] ask myself that i said i wonder how many
[1:10:53] people but i wonder how many people
[1:10:56] responded
[1:10:58] amen because what what happens is a lot
[1:11:01] of times we say you know lord
[1:11:03] you know i'm too embarrassed to say that
[1:11:04] i want i don't want everybody to know
[1:11:06] like my wife said when i got in the car
[1:11:08] you know i wish we should have to put
[1:11:09] all of our business on the line some
[1:11:11] people want things private
[1:11:12] but what if that's your day what if that
[1:11:14] was your moment what if that was your
[1:11:15] season
[1:11:16] and because you were just a little
[1:11:18] embarrassed
[1:11:20] you you were just a little ashamed or
[1:11:23] you didn't want nobody to know your
[1:11:24] business
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] and just because of that that one minute
[1:11:30] where you didn't want nobody
[1:11:32] then this person over here got what was
[1:11:33] supposed to be for you
[1:11:38] so i said lord you know um i'm thankful
[1:11:40] i'm grateful
[1:11:42] um you know i i see it as my testimony
[1:11:46] but this isn't just my testimony it's
[1:11:48] for this whole church
[1:11:51] because now that you get to hear the
[1:11:52] testimony your face should arrive and
[1:11:53] say lord i'll respond
[1:11:56] it won't happen to me lord i will
[1:11:58] respond
[1:11:59] if you call on me god if it's my season
[1:12:01] i'm here
[1:12:02] send it my way i'm not too proud
[1:12:06] i'll send it send that anointing the
[1:12:08] same anointing
[1:12:10] it's here this morning same anointing
[1:12:13] then the same anointing that was in the
[1:12:14] prophet's ministry
[1:12:16] is here this morning i don't care what
[1:12:18] condition is in your body
[1:12:20] me and my house we knew i i was talking
[1:12:22] about a job me in my house we're not
[1:12:23] afraid of covet i'm gonna tell you why
[1:12:25] i'm gonna tell you why because the same
[1:12:27] god in the day of william branham
[1:12:29] the same god in the day of elijah the
[1:12:32] same god who was there that healed those
[1:12:33] lepers in the bible
[1:12:34] he is here this morning i'm not afraid
[1:12:38] of that stuff
[1:12:40] now your faith your faith might not rise
[1:12:43] to that place yet but i hope that by the
[1:12:45] end we get to the end of this service
[1:12:47] that your faith will increase amen
[1:12:51] let's just say you know what lord i have
[1:12:53] more faith in your word than man's
[1:12:55] opinion
[1:12:56] i have more faith in your word than the
[1:12:57] symptoms in my body
[1:12:59] i have more faith in your word than
[1:13:01] what's going on and what looks like this
[1:13:03] reality
[1:13:04] because the bible says that those who
[1:13:06] walk in the spirit they are the sons of
[1:13:08] god
[1:13:09] all right and we are not bound by the
[1:13:10] laws of nature
[1:13:12] when you walk in the spirit you are a
[1:13:14] supernatural being
[1:13:15] supernatural beings have the authority
[1:13:18] to override nature
[1:13:21] you can override the laws of nature
[1:13:24] that's why jesus can walk on water do
[1:13:27] you know you can walk on water
[1:13:30] if you're a supernatural being hey
[1:13:33] man amen you know
[1:13:38] i'm not even preaching yet but if you're
[1:13:40] a supernatural being
[1:13:42] you can defy nature that's what
[1:13:45] supernatural is
[1:13:47] it's outside of natural
[1:13:50] oh praise god that's why i don't worry
[1:13:53] about what's going on
[1:13:55] the doctor tell me bad news i said thank
[1:13:57] you but i'm supernatural
[1:13:59] i can override the doctor's orders
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:04] i have a prescription that overrides the
[1:14:07] doctor's prescription
[1:14:09] i have thus said the lord they said the
[1:14:12] lord prophet said the bride of christ
[1:14:15] she will have the mind of christ and
[1:14:17] thus said to the lord to know what to do
[1:14:19] with this word

[1:14:23] applied over my house
[1:14:24] i applied over my wife i applied over my
[1:14:26] children hey

[1:22:58] our mouth filled with laughter and
[1:23:01] our tongue was with singing then said
[1:23:03] they among the heathen the lord have
[1:23:05] done great
[1:23:06] things for them the lord had done great
[1:23:08] things for
[1:23:09] us we're of we are glad

[1:23:20] he that goes forth and weepeth bearing
[1:23:22] precious seed

[1:24:54] come but there will be some true
[1:24:56] believers lord god who will be able to
[1:24:57] rise up in faith lord god and
[1:25:00] lord i believe we're here amongst those
[1:25:01] people this morning
[1:25:03] who believe that anything can happen all
[1:25:05] things are possible
[1:25:06] to them that believe and lord we just i

[1:25:25] lord god and
[1:25:26] lord god we know that we're just here
[1:25:28] together for this little time
[1:25:29] lord we pray that your blessings
[1:25:31] fellowship lord god man they'll be
[1:25:32] rejoicing in testimonies come lord

[1:25:40] strengthen the pastor of his church and
[1:25:42] his family lord god continue to use him
[1:25:44] lord god and and the growth of this

[1:25:48] we pray lord for the church you know the
[1:25:50] needs of the church lord we pray so meet
[1:25:52] those needs open up the doors that need
[1:25:53] to be opened
[1:25:54] lord god the opportunities that need to
[1:25:56] be presented may they be presented lord
[1:25:58] god and
[1:25:59] may the church just recognize it and
[1:26:01] walk right in and lord god and trusting
[1:26:03] in you
[1:26:04] we ask these things we pray in jesus
[1:26:06] name amen amen man you can be seated
[1:26:09] this morning
[1:26:10] hey man uh i i
[1:26:13] wanted to preach a short message this
[1:26:15] morning but every time i i do that
[1:26:17] say i'm preached short then i end up
[1:26:18] preaching the first
[1:26:20] part of the sermon in the first half
[1:26:21] hour and then the last part the
[1:26:23] last hour uh so uh i'm gonna try to be a
[1:26:26] preacher at a half hour
[1:26:28] uh but as brother wesker said we're
[1:26:30] preachers of the hour
[1:26:31] and so i gotta try to find some balance
[1:26:33] here
[1:26:34] hey man but uh i want to speak to you
[1:26:36] this morning on uh
[1:26:37] on a topic uh the lord knows when amen
[1:26:41] the lord knows when
[1:26:42] amen now the word when if you look over
[1:26:45] in psalm
[1:26:46] uh 126 and verse 1 it says when the lord
[1:26:50] turned again the captivity of zion we
[1:26:53] were like them that dream
[1:26:55] amen now when i when i look at this
[1:26:57] particular verse
[1:26:59] my attention is turned to when because
[1:27:01] it doesn't exactly express the timeline
[1:27:05] of the word when and when you think of
[1:27:06] the word when
[1:27:08] when is time encapsulating but it's
[1:27:11] uncertain
[1:27:12] all right so it doesn't have a date it
[1:27:14] just says when the lord turn
[1:27:17] amen and so uh some of you all have
[1:27:19] probably heard the expression
[1:27:21] the lord knows when amen so
[1:27:25] we we've heard that before uh you
[1:27:27] probably heard it used like uh the lord
[1:27:29] knows when it's the right time to do it
[1:27:31] or you've heard uh the lord knows knows
[1:27:34] when
[1:27:35] i should you know make that decision he
[1:27:37] knows all things right we
[1:27:38] we put that off like it's way out there
[1:27:40] on the side of the
[1:27:42] highway somewhere we we just got to wait
[1:27:44] until he brings it to pass but
[1:27:46] this morning i kind of want to uh take
[1:27:49] this
[1:27:49] thought of the lord knows when and
[1:27:52] actually bring
[1:27:53] a absolute conviction on it so i want
[1:27:56] you to think of it for
[1:27:57] uh with me for a moment this morning
[1:27:59] church the lord
[1:28:01] knows when the lord
[1:28:04] knows when so the lord we know that the
[1:28:07] lord knows
[1:28:08] uh the beginning to the end amen
[1:28:12] you believe that the lord knows it and
[1:28:14] so
[1:28:15] it's comforting then for us to say
[1:28:18] the lord knows when especially since we
[1:28:22] don't know when
[1:28:24] right so so because we know that he
[1:28:27] knows
[1:28:28] the beginning to the end we we we kind
[1:28:31] of sit at ease
[1:28:33] we don't have to get anxious and worry
[1:28:35] about anything we just pray about
[1:28:36] everything right
[1:28:38] and so we realize that if the lord knows
[1:28:41] the beginning to the end this means that
[1:28:44] god has his own clock the lord has his
[1:28:47] own watch
[1:28:49] now um some of you all may have a
[1:28:52] apple watch or you may be wearing your
[1:28:54] wrist watch
[1:28:55] and i remember reading um in the message
[1:28:58] where brother branham was talking about
[1:29:00] he got this special watch from sweden i
[1:29:02] believe it was
[1:29:03] and he said it was a great celestial
[1:29:06] watch
[1:29:06] and he said that you know it was
[1:29:08] beautiful to look at and it
[1:29:10] uh he set the time on it he said not two
[1:29:12] three months later
[1:29:13] he said though the time on the watch was
[1:29:15] not consistent
[1:29:16] with what time it actually was right but
[1:29:19] do you realize that god's clock it
[1:29:22] always ticks in perfect time
[1:29:24] hey man it doesn't it doesn't matter you
[1:29:27] know
[1:29:28] the apple watches they kind of sink to
[1:29:29] the internet you know so
[1:29:31] so they kind of can keep it up now but
[1:29:33] but if you just have a regular watch you
[1:29:34] know after a set period of time when the
[1:29:36] battery begins to go low
[1:29:38] it starts to get off track but see god's
[1:29:42] timing is so specific
[1:29:45] amen he has what we call appointments
[1:29:49] amen you know he's always on time you
[1:29:53] know he's not like your doctor
[1:29:54] you know your doctor tells you that you
[1:29:56] have an appointment but it's really not
[1:29:57] an appointment
[1:29:58] because an appointment is when you start
[1:30:00] on time
[1:30:03] amen so like when we say that church is
[1:30:05] at 10 30 then everybody's
[1:30:06] nobody should walk in at 10 31
[1:30:09] right because the appointment is at 10
[1:30:11] 30.
[1:30:13] all right gonna get too deep leave it
[1:30:15] right there you see
[1:30:16] if you if you recognize what what we do
[1:30:20] sometimes psychologically is we put off
[1:30:23] excuses for
[1:30:24] lapses in time and imagine if god had an
[1:30:27] excuse for lapses in time on his clock
[1:30:30] so what if he didn't show up right when
[1:30:32] you needed him
[1:30:34] right and so now he has a schedule god
[1:30:37] has a schedule
[1:30:38] he knows the days that's on the calendar
[1:30:40] it's not like our days on the counter
[1:30:42] you know that's why when when month
[1:30:44] three came from me
[1:30:45] uh you know after we left the service
[1:30:47] and we you know we
[1:30:49] uh we weren't pregnant you know that
[1:30:51] kind of threw me off
[1:30:52] because see that's man's time right man
[1:30:54] says you have to have a baby
[1:30:56] you know in exactly nine months and it
[1:30:59] has to be like this
[1:31:00] god said what if i i don't get allow you
[1:31:03] to conceive until
[1:31:04] you know the fifth month and then you
[1:31:05] deliver
[1:31:07] in the ninth month see man we we
[1:31:10] our thinking is finite
[1:31:13] right but god he's outside of the box
[1:31:18] this is why this is why the lord knows
[1:31:20] when because if we knew when we probably
[1:31:22] mess it up
[1:31:24] we try to get ahead of the clock you
[1:31:26] know so
[1:31:27] some of you are when you get you heard
[1:31:29] me make the expression know that our
[1:31:30] cells don't taste the same in the
[1:31:31] microwave
[1:31:32] there's some people in here that's
[1:31:33] willing to put oxtails in the microwave
[1:31:36] when they get hungry enough they do it
[1:31:38] they'll put chicken in the microwave
[1:31:40] if they get hungry enough they'll do it
[1:31:42] there's some people that no matter how
[1:31:43] hungry they get they still gonna put in
[1:31:45] a slow cooker
[1:31:48] so so to play it safe we'll just let god
[1:31:50] know when and we just
[1:31:51] ride in the vehicle y'all ever had
[1:31:54] children they're riding in the car
[1:31:55] with you the children riding in the car
[1:31:58] and they say
[1:31:59] mom and daddy are we there yet you
[1:32:01] notice the thing about the children when
[1:32:03] they ask
[1:32:04] are we there yet that they are
[1:32:06] comfortable
[1:32:07] all right with the situation they're in
[1:32:10] but they don't know when
[1:32:14] they sit at ease they're resting and and
[1:32:17] their their confidence
[1:32:19] is in mommy and daddy y'all understand
[1:32:21] what i'm saying
[1:32:22] so they they don't they don't uh the
[1:32:24] only thing they probably say is
[1:32:26] i really gotta use the restroom right
[1:32:28] but when it comes down to getting from
[1:32:29] point a to point b when that child knows
[1:32:31] we're going from here to there they'll
[1:32:33] say are we there yet
[1:32:35] but they don't go are we gonna get there
[1:32:38] they know they're going to get there
[1:32:39] they just want to know are we there yet
[1:32:43] yeah right so the the saints of god
[1:32:46] we're in this automobile right and we're
[1:32:49] riding with god and we we don't need to
[1:32:52] try to figure out are we going to make
[1:32:55] it there
[1:32:56] we just want to know lord when will we
[1:32:58] get there
[1:33:02] that's that's the place our faith has
[1:33:03] got to rise you got to be so
[1:33:05] confident in god knowing that he
[1:33:08] controls
[1:33:08] all things that you're just waiting for
[1:33:11] the appointed time
[1:33:13] amen now there's some things you got to
[1:33:15] do when you're waiting because some
[1:33:16] people think
[1:33:17] that when you're waiting you're supposed
[1:33:18] to watch the clock you do that you know
[1:33:20] you kind of get bored you fall asleep
[1:33:22] and you you know you might wake up late
[1:33:24] and you might miss it completely so
[1:33:25] there's some things that you got to do
[1:33:27] uh there when you're waiting but we'll
[1:33:29] get to that here in just a moment now
[1:33:32] now you know
[1:33:35] god he is calculated he don't he don't
[1:33:38] um
[1:33:39] god don't just make up stuff god don't
[1:33:41] just uh react because you you made a
[1:33:43] decision now he's got to try to figure
[1:33:44] out his next move
[1:33:45] he doesn't do things on a whim and um
[1:33:48] the prophet of god uh said that
[1:33:50] everything that god does is purp
[1:33:52] his purpose everything he does is
[1:33:55] purpose
[1:33:56] uh brother brennan says this uh let me
[1:33:58] see here
[1:33:59] he says this uh in 1958 i know my
[1:34:02] redeemer livid
[1:34:03] he says just as my finger is here for a
[1:34:07] purpose
[1:34:08] my nail on my finger is for a purpose
[1:34:11] my eye and every part of our bodies is
[1:34:14] to serve a purpose
[1:34:16] and it was not put here just to see what
[1:34:19] it would
[1:34:19] look like when it was put here
[1:34:22] but it was put here to serve its purpose
[1:34:24] so i want to say this
[1:34:26] you are not here watch it just to see
[1:34:29] what you would look like
[1:34:32] all right some of y'all you know you
[1:34:33] want to show you know where your new
[1:34:35] suit
[1:34:36] and all that and that's great thank you
[1:34:38] you look good this morning
[1:34:39] praise god it's good to see you but
[1:34:41] you're not here this morning
[1:34:43] just to see what you would look like if
[1:34:46] you made it into this service this
[1:34:48] morning
[1:34:49] it's because you are put here to serve a
[1:34:51] purpose
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:53] but the brown says it was god's divine
[1:34:56] plan to do so
[1:34:57] and if we were put here for a purpose
[1:35:00] watch
[1:35:01] then there is nothing can destroy us
[1:35:03] until god's purpose is fulfilled
[1:35:06] nothing can harm us until that purpose
[1:35:09] that god has put us here for
[1:35:11] has been made manifest i want you to
[1:35:14] think about that for a minute
[1:35:15] you mean to tell me that there is
[1:35:17] nothing watch now that the devil can do
[1:35:20] to prevent me from receiving the promise
[1:35:24] of god
[1:35:25] so no matter how hard the devil wants to
[1:35:28] fight or try to delay the promise of god
[1:35:30] for
[1:35:30] zika being in the service this morning
[1:35:32] he could not do it
[1:35:35] because when it is promised to you for a
[1:35:37] purpose
[1:35:39] there is nothing can harm the purpose
[1:35:41] that's why
[1:35:42] when the doctors they say you know we we
[1:35:44] see that there might be some
[1:35:45] complications here
[1:35:46] there's nothing can harm the purpose of
[1:35:48] god in your life
[1:35:50] nothing nothing can stop it your purpose
[1:35:54] must be fulfilled right
[1:35:57] no matter how much trouble we have how
[1:35:59] much heartaches
[1:36:00] or sorrows that we go through all of
[1:36:03] these
[1:36:03] are reasons and there's a reason for it
[1:36:07] so you mean to tell me you mean to tell
[1:36:09] me that the re
[1:36:10] the tribulation that's upon me the the
[1:36:13] the the time that's being delayed uh for
[1:36:16] my promise to come to pass is for a
[1:36:17] reason
[1:36:18] absolutely now the prophet goes on to
[1:36:20] say he says
[1:36:21] we will take for instance noah in the
[1:36:24] bible
[1:36:24] he said there was a flood that came on
[1:36:26] and all of the earth was destroyed
[1:36:29] the vegetation and everything was
[1:36:31] destroyed but
[1:36:32] noah and the seed that had taken into
[1:36:34] the ark watch this
[1:36:35] god's purpose can never be defeated
[1:36:40] amen i want to say something right here
[1:36:42] it doesn't matter how
[1:36:44] long you've been believing god
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] it cannot be stopped
[1:36:52] i don't care you've been believing god
[1:36:53] for your children for 20 years
[1:36:55] 30 years for the it's a promise this
[1:36:58] promise is to you
[1:37:00] and your children and god's purpose can
[1:37:03] never
[1:37:05] the prophet said it can never you know
[1:37:07] it never means
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:11] never that means it don't matter how bad
[1:37:13] it gets
[1:37:15] it don't matter how extreme the
[1:37:17] circumstances are
[1:37:19] it can never be defeated
[1:37:23] there is nothing can defeat it
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:28] i believe that this morning i receive
[1:37:31] that
[1:37:32] he said so how happy are we to be today
[1:37:36] hey amen
[1:37:39] how happy are we to be today
[1:37:43] resting upon that beautiful revelation
[1:37:46] of the word of the living god that there
[1:37:48] is neither
[1:37:49] things present nor things that can come
[1:37:54] watch this now i'm gonna read it the way
[1:37:57] i see it there's no
[1:38:00] covenant
[1:38:02] it's home there's no covet no
[1:38:06] sorrow no death no perils
[1:38:09] nor nothing can separate us from the
[1:38:12] purpose of the living god
[1:38:18] doctor said we gotta we gotta uh we can
[1:38:21] we might not be able to take you back uh
[1:38:23] to see the birth of your son
[1:38:25] mr underwood because we gotta protect
[1:38:26] the baby from kobe i said kobe can't
[1:38:28] stop that that let's see
[1:38:34] coleman couldn't stop it devil couldn't
[1:38:37] stop it
[1:38:38] there's no devil in hell can stop you
[1:38:40] from receiving your promise
[1:38:44] you got to believe it though i'm just
[1:38:47] saying it you got to believe it
[1:38:49] amen he said what god has imagined in
[1:38:51] his mind
[1:38:52] with god his purpose in his heart to
[1:38:54] bring the past there is no
[1:38:56] demon oh hold on everything
[1:38:59] you know some people they're operating
[1:39:01] in witchcraft now there's some people
[1:39:03] that are rooting against you so it's not
[1:39:05] just the demons
[1:39:06] there are no powers there is
[1:39:09] nothing can ever separate god's great
[1:39:12] immortal eternal plan
[1:39:14] it must be as god has said amen
[1:39:19] amen must be the way he said
[1:39:22] right so it doesn't matter how long it
[1:39:24] is
[1:39:25] the lord knows when
[1:39:28] i just stand believing amen
[1:39:32] doesn't matter how many demons get
[1:39:34] released doesn't matter how many

[1:40:05] don't think he could be here this
[1:40:06] morning
[1:40:07] i know he wouldn't because god is so
[1:40:09] specific
[1:40:11] there were several times where god told
[1:40:12] the children of israel to do things a
[1:40:14] certain way
[1:40:17] and every time they went outside of the
[1:40:18] way
[1:40:20] god y'all believe god has a provided way
[1:40:21] don't you
[1:40:24] you can't get eternal life going around
[1:40:25] the message
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:30] he's got one way one spirit
[1:40:34] one baptism one faith you can't get
[1:40:38] eternal life going around the message
[1:40:40] you got to follow the instructions
[1:40:50] there's some devils mad this morning
[1:40:52] some demons trembling this morning
[1:40:54] amen listen i don't care listen i don't
[1:40:58] care what your conditions say
[1:41:00] i know what my god says i value men's
[1:41:03] opinion but i value god's word
[1:41:05] more i value men's opinion
[1:41:08] but i value god's word more
[1:41:11] amen let me read this quote
[1:41:15] brother brandon says this this 1963
[1:41:18] victory day
[1:41:20] he said and each one of us is born for
[1:41:22] something
[1:41:23] we just wasn't put here for nothing that
[1:41:26] mountain never happened out there just
[1:41:28] to be
[1:41:29] that tree was put there for a purpose
[1:41:32] everything is for a purpose you know
[1:41:34] some people don't want trees
[1:41:36] some people don't want mountains oh no
[1:41:39] they see a mountain in their life and
[1:41:40] they ready to quit
[1:41:41] give up and say it ain't for me i guess
[1:41:43] i've been praying for the wrong thing
[1:41:45] lord oh lord i guess i've been believing
[1:41:47] it seemed like it's gotten worse the
[1:41:48] situation lord
[1:41:50] that tree was put there for a purpose
[1:41:53] you know that the tree that jesus cursed
[1:41:55] was put there
[1:41:59] oh man
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:03] he says it's got to serve and we are
[1:42:06] here for a purpose
[1:42:08] maybe it's to testify to one person
[1:42:12] wait a minute brother jack you mean that
[1:42:14] testimony i just told this morning
[1:42:16] might only be for one person
[1:42:21] oh man i rebecca i hope it's us
[1:42:25] get double blessed to get lost
[1:42:29] but that's the way you should respond if
[1:42:31] it wasn't for one person says me
[1:42:33] it's for me
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:39] maybe it's to testify to one person and
[1:42:41] get them saved
[1:42:42] and out of that might come a preacher
[1:42:45] will send a million souls to christ
[1:42:48] he said look at dwight moody's
[1:42:49] conference conversion and many of those
[1:42:52] you see
[1:42:52] he said just one little old woman with a
[1:42:55] little old watch woman with a message on
[1:42:57] her heart
[1:42:58] to do something for god and she rented
[1:43:00] an
[1:43:01] old lottery stable and got a minister to
[1:43:03] come down and preach
[1:43:05] and nobody why should you see how nobody
[1:43:08] showed up
[1:43:09] you know why it was probably wednesday
[1:43:10] night
[1:43:14] it was probably friday night prayer oh
[1:43:17] it wasn't it wasn't at the church it was
[1:43:19] at somebody's house
[1:43:22] and so we ain't going over that brother
[1:43:23] house because we ain't friends with that
[1:43:25] brother we don't get along with that
[1:43:26] brother we ain't friends with that
[1:43:27] sister
[1:43:28] we don't get along watch the attitude of
[1:43:31] the people
[1:43:33] you want to know you want to know how
[1:43:34] blessed the church is you can see it on
[1:43:36] the attitudes of the people
[1:43:38] people round ourselves people with
[1:43:40] positive positive faith get positive
[1:43:42] results
[1:43:43] that negative attitude is like a flat
[1:43:44] tire you can't go too far into your
[1:43:46] chains
[1:43:51] he said nobody but a little old boy with
[1:43:54] their hair hanging down his neck and his
[1:43:56] daddy's suspenders on
[1:43:57] went down there and knelt down at that
[1:44:00] uh at the altar that night
[1:44:02] dwight moody that sent a half million
[1:44:04] souls
[1:44:05] to jesus christ i wonder if that lady
[1:44:08] hadn't had that little service in the
[1:44:09] stable
[1:44:10] how those souls would have made it in
[1:44:16] she said see that woman watching out
[1:44:18] that woman
[1:44:19] that she didn't save the soul
[1:44:24] right pay attention to the story she
[1:44:26] followed the instructions
[1:44:29] that led to the souls being saved
[1:44:33] you see that woman has something to do
[1:44:37] and you might think that your part is so
[1:44:39] insignificant
[1:44:41] but that little part you got to do it
[1:44:45] it was for a purpose she was made a wash
[1:44:48] woman
[1:44:49] for a purpose little old watch woman
[1:44:53] cleaning the church making sure that the
[1:44:56] floor is vacuumed
[1:44:57] making sure that the bathroom's clean
[1:44:59] and we all people don't want to clean
[1:45:00] the bathroom
[1:45:01] but that might be saving somebody's soul
[1:45:05] hallelujah watch he goes on to say
[1:45:09] he says uh same sermon next paragraph he
[1:45:12] says
[1:45:13] don't despise where god
[1:45:16] has got you
[1:45:21] but serve your purpose why because

[1:49:48] at a dental practice
[1:49:49] i told my church i said i'll be the

[1:50:19] i feel
[1:50:20] led to go into sales she said what kind

[1:52:25] trying to put me over i said
[1:52:27] i'll give it a try yeah i went in there
[1:52:29] i gave it
[1:52:30] all my heart all my mic went as hard as
[1:52:33] i can
[1:52:34] when they came back and told me how much
[1:52:35] i was gonna make i said well then
[1:52:37] we on track
[1:52:39] [Laughter]
[1:52:42] because when i get my millions i'm gonna
[1:52:44] make sure caleb get his
[1:52:47] hey man now
[1:52:51] i in that process we had zeke in that
[1:52:53] whole process now i have my master's
[1:52:54] degree and i'm working towards my
[1:52:56] million in the next 12 months
[1:52:58] now
[1:53:00] [Applause]
[1:53:02] some people say oh brother joe you have
[1:53:04] to why you had to brag
[1:53:09] i'm not bragging i'm trying to tell you
[1:53:10] the realities
[1:53:12] of the supernatural for me it just
[1:53:14] happened to be
[1:53:15] in in prosperity but for you it could be
[1:53:19] in your healing
[1:53:21] for you for somebody else it could be in
[1:53:23] your delivery
[1:53:24] for somebody else it can be in the
[1:53:26] baptism of the holy ghost in your life
[1:53:28] but the bottom line is it's still the
[1:53:30] same
[1:53:31] you got to give all your heart all your
[1:53:34] might you've got to trust god you've got
[1:53:36] to have confidence in him
[1:53:38] and you've got to know that you know
[1:53:40] that you know that
[1:53:42] he is going to bring it to pass have to
[1:53:44] know it
[1:53:46] you don't have to know when the lord
[1:53:48] knows when
[1:53:50] that's all right i just say it plainly
[1:53:53] so that everybody can catch it that's
[1:53:54] right
[1:53:55] amen so now
[1:53:58] you're not at the mercy of those
[1:54:00] detractors gold when you think about
[1:54:02] gold
[1:54:02] gold goes through uh the fire they put
[1:54:05] the gold through the fire
[1:54:07] now do you all know why they put gold in
[1:54:08] the fire i'm not talking about beating
[1:54:10] the gold i'm actually just putting it
[1:54:11] through the fire do you know why they
[1:54:13] put it through the fire
[1:54:15] so they put the the gold uh in the fire
[1:54:18] in order to burn
[1:54:19] everything off of it that will weaken
[1:54:21] its value
[1:54:24] all right so the reason that we're
[1:54:26] constantly
[1:54:28] what we would call being tried in the
[1:54:30] fire all right
[1:54:31] is to burn off anything that would watch
[1:54:35] this
[1:54:35] weaken the value of our testimony
[1:54:39] amen amen
[1:54:42] so the more you go through the fire the
[1:54:44] more valuable your testimony
[1:54:50] you should rejoice when you're going
[1:54:52] through great trials
[1:54:54] because the greater the trial the
[1:54:56] greater the testimony
[1:54:58] the the greater the trial the more
[1:55:00] valuable the testimony is
[1:55:04] amen so so when we're being when we're
[1:55:07] being tried
[1:55:08] in that fire you know you're not going
[1:55:11] through that just to say oh i went
[1:55:13] through something
[1:55:14] no it's so that we can prove without a
[1:55:17] doubt
[1:55:17] that there was no way other than the
[1:55:20] lord jesus christ
[1:55:22] bringing you through that test
[1:55:25] because you know there are some people
[1:55:26] who say well brother joe it's your
[1:55:28] education that made you that
[1:55:30] oh well brother joe it's you know you as
[1:55:32] a person that made you that
[1:55:34] but if i get tried through the fire hard
[1:55:36] enough you won't be able to say that
[1:55:40] right if i'm going if my situation is so
[1:55:44] so bad i've seen i've been in service
[1:55:46] and prayed over people who had stage
[1:55:48] four cancer
[1:55:49] stage four and they would have stage
[1:55:51] four cancer and that situation
[1:55:53] seemed so bad to them right but to god
[1:55:57] it was nothing
[1:55:59] but it's all about what you do with that
[1:56:01] faith
[1:56:02] will you exercise it amen
[1:56:06] so let me look at something i want to uh
[1:56:08] read this uh this scripture
[1:56:10] here it's uh revelation chapter two uh
[1:56:14] verse nine and ten
[1:56:16] revelation chapter two verse nine and
[1:56:18] ten
[1:56:20] it says i know thy works
[1:56:24] and tribulation and poverty
[1:56:27] watch now but thou art rich
[1:56:30] and i know the blasphemy of them which
[1:56:32] say they are jews and are not
[1:56:34] but are the synagogue of satan for none
[1:56:37] of those things
[1:56:38] which thou shalt suffer behold watch
[1:56:42] this
[1:56:43] or fear none of those things which thou
[1:56:44] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:56:46] some of you into prison
[1:56:48] that you may be tried and ye shall have
[1:56:51] tribulation
[1:56:52] ten days be thou faithful unto death and
[1:56:55] i will give thee a crown of life
[1:56:57] now for me in verse 10 i get excited at
[1:57:00] the part right there that says and you
[1:57:01] shall have tribulation
[1:57:03] 10 days and the reason i get excited
[1:57:05] about that
[1:57:07] is because it says 10 days it's good to
[1:57:10] know that before i
[1:57:11] get in the situation
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:17] before i get into the situation it
[1:57:19] already has a scheduled time for me to
[1:57:21] come out
[1:57:26] you know the song we singing trouble
[1:57:28] don't last always
[1:57:30] yeah we sing that song but then when we
[1:57:31] in our mess
[1:57:33] oh man when it's going in
[1:57:36] you know your trials have an end date
[1:57:41] the trials have an end date that's the
[1:57:44] part that gets me excited
[1:57:45] is it says 10 days when i look at that i
[1:57:48] start thinking i wonder what day i'm in
[1:57:50] i feel like i'm in the ninth day brother
[1:57:52] jack i'm excited that's the way i
[1:57:54] worship god when i come to church
[1:57:56] you gotta worship him like you on day 9.
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:00] some of you are worshiping them like you
[1:58:01] on day two
[1:58:04] oh help me lord jehovah
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:10] you got to praise them like you on day
[1:58:12] nine everybody should be trying to
[1:58:14] figure out what's wrong with you
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:18] i'm on the ninth i'm always on day 9. i
[1:58:21] i don't i don't want to always live in
[1:58:22] dayton because i feel like if i'm in day
[1:58:24] 9 then i have something to look forward
[1:58:25] to
[1:58:31] god has a watch remember
[1:58:34] he has a watch he has a calendar he has
[1:58:38] his own
[1:58:38] he knows it in from the beginning we
[1:58:40] already said that but also remember
[1:58:42] there's a time
[1:58:43] and season as paul said for everything
[1:58:46] right so that means that nothing is just
[1:58:48] running around
[1:58:48] chaotic all right it's not just chaos
[1:58:51] happening
[1:58:52] we look at what's going on right now and
[1:58:54] uh the government and with the
[1:58:56] uh covert it seems like it's all just
[1:58:58] kind of chaotic right now
[1:59:00] you know everybody's trying to figure
[1:59:02] out what's going to be the next move and
[1:59:03] things of that nature
[1:59:04] but do you know that this was all on
[1:59:06] god's calendar
[1:59:08] he already had it planned out and then i
[1:59:10] got something else for you do you know
[1:59:12] that there's an end date for this
[1:59:16] some of y'all think it's a vaccine but i
[1:59:18] think it's the rapture
[1:59:20] hey praise the lord you can stand get in
[1:59:24] line for the vaccine i'll get in line
[1:59:25] for the rapture
[1:59:26] how about that glory be to god i mark
[1:59:30] that on my calendar
[1:59:31] ah i ain't against the vaccine you go
[1:59:34] get it but i'm looking for the rapture
[1:59:36] amen amen you gotta you gotta make sure
[1:59:40] that you
[1:59:40] you don't put too much focus on one
[1:59:42] thing and forget the other that's right
[1:59:45] i think that's what john said he said
[1:59:47] come back to your first love
[1:59:50] amen let me keep going here so we got
[1:59:53] god is
[1:59:54] has already created everything
[1:59:58] that is required to be in his plan
[2:00:00] everything that's on the
[2:00:01] earth right now has an appointed time of
[2:00:04] which it is to come
[2:00:05] so god created specific things first
[2:00:08] watch now
[2:00:08] he's so smart he's so infinite he
[2:00:11] created specific
[2:00:12] things first for a specific
[2:00:15] time exact time 1958 brother brown says
[2:00:18] uh and you must be born again
[2:00:21] he says now we'll have to use a
[2:00:23] imagination here
[2:00:25] as to make a drama then the great holy
[2:00:27] spirit went forth and spread forth his
[2:00:29] wings over the earth
[2:00:30] and began to brood for a purpose and
[2:00:32] that was to bring forth something to
[2:00:33] project what god was
[2:00:35] as i said the other night which was
[2:00:38] first
[2:00:39] a sinner or savior i want you to pay
[2:00:42] attention to this this is very important
[2:00:44] because god is so infinite that he's
[2:00:46] already put things in your life ahead of
[2:00:48] time
[2:00:50] to help you get through the trials that
[2:00:51] are on the way
[2:00:53] so he says which was first a sinner or a
[2:00:55] savior he said what's this
[2:00:56] about any anyhow he said which was first
[2:00:59] a healer
[2:01:01] or sickness he said why certainly a
[2:01:03] healer
[2:01:04] well why did we ever become sinners then
[2:01:07] it had to be that way if god
[2:01:11] is a savior he had to have something
[2:01:15] to say so there's nothing wrong
[2:01:20] it's just all working his way
[2:01:24] so there's nothing wrong right now
[2:01:25] what's going on with the
[2:01:27] with uh biden and kevin uh uh camelot is
[2:01:31] it kamila
[2:01:33] mrs harris there's nothing wrong with
[2:01:37] with uh them being in office some people
[2:01:39] are oh my god we got a woman person
[2:01:42] there's nothing wrong it's all working
[2:01:44] his way
[2:01:46] calm down take a deep breath put your
[2:01:49] shoes up put your feet up
[2:01:51] he said now uh i don't i couldn't say uh
[2:01:54] this to sinners
[2:01:55] i'm saying it watch to ministers and
[2:01:57] children of god i wonder how many
[2:01:58] ministers and children of god we got
[2:02:00] here this morning
[2:02:01] he ain't talking just to the people out
[2:02:03] there he's talking to you and i this
[2:02:04] morning amen
[2:02:06] he says it's all working all right no
[2:02:08] matter what we do
[2:02:09] or do not do it's going to come out all
[2:02:12] right
[2:02:13] because what god foreknew he ordained
[2:02:16] now notice then as it's moving around as
[2:02:19] it is
[2:02:20] it's coming out all right there's no
[2:02:22] need of us worrying
[2:02:23] because it's going to be
[2:02:27] that's why i don't worry about kobe
[2:02:29] brothers
[2:02:31] i decided i said i said my wife she said
[2:02:34] what are we going to do
[2:02:35] you got newborn and you you know you go
[2:02:37] out there you work out there in the
[2:02:38] field and you come in contact with
[2:02:39] people
[2:02:39] you know what are we going to do i said
[2:02:42] it's going to be okay
[2:02:46] i said listen i'm i'm one of those
[2:02:48] believers who believe
[2:02:49] that if i was to get kovacs god is
[2:02:52] obligated to heal me
[2:02:54] amen amen
[2:02:57] i believe that do you know why because
[2:03:00] if he don't heal me then he's got to
[2:03:02] take me into
[2:03:04] eternal life so if i'm here if i'm going
[2:03:07] to be present in this body he's got to
[2:03:09] heal me
[2:03:10] i know if it's my time if you take me
[2:03:12] home i'll be ready to go home with the
[2:03:13] lord
[2:03:14] there's some people that said my brother
[2:03:15] joe practice wisdom now you know
[2:03:17] i practice wisdom i wear my mask when i
[2:03:19] go out and different things of that
[2:03:20] nature
[2:03:21] but i'm not afraid of no code
[2:03:25] i walk in the presence of kobe the same
[2:03:27] way i walk in the presence of other
[2:03:28] demon spirits
[2:03:29] like those spirits that you go to when
[2:03:31] you're at the south florida fair
[2:03:33] yeah you go right out there you just
[2:03:34] walk around and you do what you got to
[2:03:36] do get on your ride and go
[2:03:37] home it's the same thing i do when i go
[2:03:39] out in the midst of colby it's the same
[2:03:41] demon it's a demon
[2:03:43] lord brandon said every sickness is a
[2:03:45] devil
[2:03:46] that's all it is it's the same devil
[2:03:48] with new tricks
[2:03:50] [Applause]
[2:03:52] new clothes same devil
[2:03:55] some of y'all realize i'm the same joe
[2:03:57] i'm just 30 now i'm not
[2:03:58] five years old anymore you probably
[2:04:00] realize that sometimes
[2:04:01] up there go joe again that's him i said
[2:04:04] yeah
[2:04:05] that's a little joke he's still a joke
[2:04:07] i'll be 50 years old that still be
[2:04:09] calling me little joker
[2:04:14] what happened ain't nothing changed it's
[2:04:16] going to be all right i'm still joke
[2:04:19] amen he's still god hebrews 13 tonight
[2:04:23] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[2:04:25] today and forever
[2:04:27] if he healed leprosy why he can't heal
[2:04:29] cody
[2:04:32] amen all right
[2:04:35] i didn't mean to go so deep in there
[2:04:40] [Laughter]
[2:04:43] so before there was a sinner the first
[2:04:45] thing was there was a savior
[2:04:46] the savior had to be first you imagine
[2:04:49] if you were
[2:04:50] in your sinful condition and there was
[2:04:51] nothing nobody could do about it because
[2:04:52] there was no savior
[2:04:54] oh man can you imagine being sick with
[2:04:56] covert but there was no way to be healed
[2:04:57] from it
[2:04:59] oh man that's eternal sickness
[2:05:02] so there had to be a healer first
[2:05:05] they had to be a savior first they had
[2:05:07] to be a deliverer first
[2:05:09] before covert 19.
[2:05:13] powerful powerful thought so before
[2:05:16] man's opinion there was god's word
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:19] catch it now before the doctor could
[2:05:21] diagnose that was jesus
[2:05:24] he was the discerner right he knew the
[2:05:26] situation so
[2:05:28] we got to bring our focus back to what
[2:05:31] came
[2:05:31] first otherwise there's no way for you
[2:05:34] to overcome because you have your focus
[2:05:36] in the wrong area
[2:05:37] right so some people are spending more
[2:05:39] time uh evaluating
[2:05:42] you know what's wrong than simply
[2:05:44] thanking the lord for the promise
[2:05:47] the solution to the answer now i want to
[2:05:48] read this quote this is uh let me see
[2:05:50] here
[2:05:52] this is 1961 expectations i want us to
[2:05:55] paint it this is a fairly long quote
[2:05:56] i'm going to read the whole thing i want
[2:05:58] those who here is believing god for
[2:06:00] something supernatural
[2:06:01] by raising hands i want you to pay close
[2:06:03] attention very very close attention to
[2:06:05] this quote
[2:06:05] brother says it says god still remains
[2:06:08] god
[2:06:09] he lives today he's just as much alive
[2:06:11] as he ever was
[2:06:12] he's god now when the priesthood was
[2:06:15] done away with
[2:06:16] then we got the new priesthood and now
[2:06:19] there has a new urum thumbin
[2:06:21] that also with this priesthood and that
[2:06:23] is god's word
[2:06:25] god's word is god's urem thumb and we
[2:06:27] believe that
[2:06:29] so that means now we're not just talking
[2:06:30] about the bible now we got to bring this
[2:06:32] all
[2:06:32] all the way around god's word is his
[2:06:35] message
[2:06:36] in the bible you cannot separate the two
[2:06:39] because if you do that you're going to
[2:06:40] make a mistake it has to flash before
[2:06:43] the year i'm thumbing
[2:06:44] all right so we're all on the same page
[2:06:47] he says then if god promises
[2:06:49] anything in the bible and you can accept
[2:06:52] it with all your heart and believe it to
[2:06:54] be so
[2:06:55] notice here in this this little piece
[2:06:57] and you can
[2:06:58] accept it with all of your heart
[2:07:02] and there's a conjunction word believe
[2:07:05] it to be so he said you'll see the
[2:07:08] supernatural of god's word
[2:07:11] take place and manifest the thing that
[2:07:14] you have believed for
[2:07:16] but see if you believe in brother jack
[2:07:17] for the wrong thing then that's what
[2:07:19] will be made manifest
[2:07:22] so if you don't believe that you'll
[2:07:23] receive then you won't that's right
[2:07:26] amen no matter what it is if you believe
[2:07:29] it
[2:07:30] the word of god is a seed it's sold in
[2:07:33] the human heart
[2:07:34] and if there's some uh nothing there to
[2:07:36] hinder it just like when god makes a
[2:07:37] decision
[2:07:38] it's his ultimatum and if you have an
[2:07:41] ultimatum that god's
[2:07:42] just the same when them two comes
[2:07:44] together
[2:07:45] something's got to happen it just can't
[2:07:48] keep from happening see
[2:07:49] and if your ultimatum is the same as
[2:07:51] god's then something
[2:07:52] must take place if god makes a statement
[2:07:57] it's got to be that then when you take
[2:08:01] your stand that that is true
[2:08:03] something has got to take place
[2:08:06] so if god says something watch now not
[2:08:09] just here
[2:08:11] if he said it on the tape oh help me
[2:08:14] somebody
[2:08:16] then it's got to take place
[2:08:24] i don't know i don't know i don't know
[2:08:25] if you get it i remember
[2:08:27] my grandfather told me he was listening
[2:08:28] to a tape in the church
[2:08:30] uh and he heard uh i don't know was it
[2:08:33] was it
[2:08:33] is it rachel i can't remember somebody
[2:08:36] had heard
[2:08:36] his name on there and began to rejoice
[2:08:40] when brother branham had uh mentioned
[2:08:42] his name because they said
[2:08:44] well brother wesko he was sending to
[2:08:46] that person on the tape
[2:08:47] but we was in church listening to that
[2:08:50] tape
[2:08:51] and therefore he was saying it to you
[2:08:55] so if he makes a statement you can
[2:08:58] receive it
[2:08:59] in real time because remember now god's
[2:09:02] time ain't like ours
[2:09:06] the lord knows when his time is perfect
[2:09:10] we can be listening to messages from
[2:09:13] years ago and experiencing the same
[2:09:15] anointing from then
[2:09:16] right now
[2:09:18] [Music]
[2:09:21] he says it's got to he says and men
[2:09:24] in all ages watch this when they have
[2:09:27] heard the voice of god speaking to them
[2:09:31] they have seen the supernatural and they
[2:09:34] have
[2:09:34] expected watch and live their life
[2:09:38] expecting this to happen and it never
[2:09:40] did ever fail
[2:09:42] never did it ever fail why because they
[2:09:44] lived their life under that expectation
[2:09:47] just off of what they heard the voice of
[2:09:48] god saying now watch abraham
[2:09:51] expected that baby to come even down to
[2:09:53] 25 years after it was promised to him
[2:09:56] he was still expecting it just the same
[2:09:58] way when he was 100 years old
[2:10:00] as he did when the promise was made at
[2:10:02] 75
[2:10:03] and the bible said that he never got
[2:10:06] weak
[2:10:07] but he got stronger all the time i
[2:10:09] wonder how many of us
[2:10:10] our faith increases the longer we wait
[2:10:12] on the blessing
[2:10:14] you know that's hard to do you know
[2:10:16] because as time goes on you start to
[2:10:17] kind of be like
[2:10:18] who come on already you know but abraham
[2:10:22] as time went on the prophet said but he
[2:10:24] got stronger all the time believing that
[2:10:26] god would do it could you imagine an old
[2:10:27] man now 75 years old
[2:10:29] and a woman well i says of 65
[2:10:32] she was barren and he was sterile
[2:10:36] ain't no way no baby coming out of this
[2:10:38] well hold on hold on hold on a minute
[2:10:41] you mean abraham could not conceive and
[2:10:43] neither could
[2:10:44] how did they have children you know
[2:10:46] because see now you look at the story
[2:10:49] between abraham and uh hagar and now
[2:10:52] you notice there's a there's two
[2:10:53] miracles happening here
[2:10:55] because abraham the prophet said was
[2:10:57] sterile
[2:10:58] so how the heck i get pregnant
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:02] oh we paid a lot of attention to the
[2:11:03] story of abraham and sarah we didn't
[2:11:04] catch that part where i go
[2:11:09] so now we keep going it says and here
[2:11:11] they went now
[2:11:12] was going to go down to a doctor at the
[2:11:14] hospital to make arrangements for a bed
[2:11:17] all right they're going to have a baby
[2:11:19] yep did i skip
[2:11:20] did i go too far no um they're going to
[2:11:22] have a baby yep 65 year old woman
[2:11:25] 75 year old man what would the doctor
[2:11:27] say the poor old couple
[2:11:29] little off their head you know that i
[2:11:30] got told that a couple of times
[2:11:32] oh joe's a little off y'all he's i am a
[2:11:35] little off
[2:11:36] i really am a little off you got to be a
[2:11:37] little off to believe the message
[2:11:40] just a little bit you have to be you you
[2:11:43] can't be completely sane
[2:11:47] you believe that the prophet really
[2:11:49] caught those conditions out in the
[2:11:51] prayer line you have to be a little off
[2:11:53] you believe that the red sea was part of
[2:11:55] you have to be just a little
[2:11:57] right come on now you got to be a little
[2:12:00] off
[2:12:01] you believe that daniel slept in the
[2:12:03] lion's den you just have to
[2:12:04] you can't be completely sane to believe
[2:12:06] that can't be
[2:12:08] so he says well now anybody that really
[2:12:10] takes god's word at face value
[2:12:12] is considered a little off at the head
[2:12:15] because
[2:12:16] it's so supernatural the natural world
[2:12:18] doesn't know
[2:12:19] anything about it he says it's it's
[2:12:22] foolish to the carnal mind
[2:12:24] so you'll never understand it he says
[2:12:27] but abraham
[2:12:28] believed it he said it's true and he
[2:12:31] believed it was
[2:12:32] i can hear him as he would say to sarah
[2:12:34] now we're going to have this baby honey
[2:12:36] it's settled because god said so she
[2:12:39] brought up the bird eye and the pens
[2:12:41] and got everything ready and made the
[2:12:42] booties and was already now listen to me
[2:12:44] if you're saying lord i'm believing you
[2:12:46] for a child you should be doing like
[2:12:47] what sister rebecca did
[2:12:48] she had uh had me buying uh baby
[2:12:51] blankets baby booties
[2:12:52] we had so many clothes for zeke before
[2:12:54] he was born and he ain't even had a
[2:12:55] chance to wear anything
[2:12:57] all right you gotta get the booties
[2:12:58] ready get the pins the bird eye
[2:13:00] y'all with me this morning some people
[2:13:03] say they believe they're gonna get
[2:13:04] healed or they believe that they're
[2:13:05] gonna
[2:13:05] this is gonna happen and you ain't even
[2:13:07] prepared for it
[2:13:08] you don't even have the room ready we're
[2:13:10] gonna put it
[2:13:12] you gotta have a room ready i'm all
[2:13:15] right
[2:13:16] he said uh and after the first so many
[2:13:18] days 28 days
[2:13:20] how are you feeling dear no different
[2:13:22] honey praise god
[2:13:23] we're going to have it anyhow my god
[2:13:27] first month pass no different second
[2:13:29] month first year
[2:13:31] second year how you feeling darling no
[2:13:33] different glory to god
[2:13:35] it's gonna be a bigger miracle than it
[2:13:36] was two years ago
[2:13:38] it's two years older now amen and when
[2:13:41] 25 years had passed
[2:13:42] he still had the same attitude
[2:13:46] just the same why because god says so
[2:13:50] how do you know cause god says so how do
[2:13:53] you know you're gonna be healed because
[2:13:54] god
[2:13:55] says how you know you're gonna be
[2:13:56] delivered because god it's been 50 years
[2:14:05] amen so that settles it if god says so
[2:14:09] there's no more to be said about it see
[2:14:11] he said so
[2:14:12] and at a hundred years old he still
[2:14:15] believed god that god would do it you
[2:14:18] know
[2:14:19] i wonder how many people was mad at
[2:14:20] abraham you know because he was like
[2:14:22] little king in the in the city there
[2:14:24] i wanna you know he go walk up like
[2:14:26] brother solomon you know
[2:14:27] 25 years of this all i'm in oh he giving
[2:14:31] me

[2:14:33] we're gonna have a baby i need your help
[2:14:35] uh building the crib you know uh at the
[2:14:37] house you mind coming by this weekend

[2:14:48] don't want to waste my time building a
[2:14:50] crib you know putting that critter
[2:14:51] together like four or five hours you
[2:14:52] know i wanna
[2:14:54] imagine you know some people were
[2:14:56] probably upset with him say oh you know
[2:14:58] what i want a bigger tent for the baby
[2:14:59] you know what let's have our workers
[2:15:01] build a bigger tent
[2:15:02] build a bigger tank let's make a little
[2:15:03] uh like a little toy for the baby
[2:15:06] it was probably like abraham's 20 25
[2:15:08] years abraham
[2:15:10] let it go man let it go
[2:15:15] it's all right it's all right you can
[2:15:18] you can call our kids your kids you know
[2:15:20] you call our kids they're your kids
[2:15:23] that's what god meant
[2:15:26] that's a good point that's good yeah
[2:15:29] you know my brother did that to me you
[2:15:31] know because he had like five i think
[2:15:33] starting five now and so uh he was like
[2:15:35] man you know joe my kids your kids
[2:15:38] i said lord i'm gonna have my own they
[2:15:41] mine
[2:15:41] and i'm having mine
[2:15:45] amen nothing wrong with that then for
[2:15:47] the better you're going he said now
[2:15:49] the bible said in hebrews 4 that abraham
[2:15:52] staggered
[2:15:52] not at the promise of god through
[2:15:54] unbelief but with strong
[2:15:56] giving praise to god and we are supposed
[2:15:59] to be
[2:15:59] abraham's seed for we who are dead in
[2:16:03] christ are abraham's seed is that right
[2:16:06] the holy spirit makes us abraham see
[2:16:08] abraham was not a jew abraham was a
[2:16:10] gentile
[2:16:11] but it wasn't jew nor gentile it was his
[2:16:14] faith in god's word
[2:16:16] was what made him to be an heir of the
[2:16:18] promise
[2:16:19] and we being dead in christ watch this
[2:16:21] we being dead in christ
[2:16:23] our abraham's seed and our heirs with
[2:16:25] him according to the promise
[2:16:27] i'll tell you that's true we are but
[2:16:30] sometimes sometimes brother jack
[2:16:35] we don't act like it you ever seen
[2:16:38] someone who's supposed to believe the
[2:16:40] message not acting like they believe
[2:16:45] that's why it's so important to follow
[2:16:47] the instructions
[2:16:49] because there's moments if you're not
[2:16:51] careful
[2:16:53] you'll begin to act like
[2:16:56] all right sometimes we go and say well
[2:16:59] i'll go and be prayed for i'll see what
[2:17:01] happens well i don't feel a bit
[2:17:02] different
[2:17:03] abraham see he says oh my he said
[2:17:07] that's a poor excuse even for a church
[2:17:09] member
[2:17:11] let alone being abraham seed abraham see
[2:17:14] don't look at no circumstance
[2:17:17] it looks at the word of god amen

[2:23:14] the promise is mine if it's a one-man
[2:23:17] invasion
[2:23:18] it's mine come on somebody
[2:23:32] you know i think i think i think brother
[2:23:35] jack when you do that fast i think we
[2:23:36] should times the church
[2:23:38] i think we should challenge the church
[2:23:40] i'm not gonna be here i'm not gonna be
[2:23:42] fasting with y'all i'm gonna be real
[2:23:43] keep it real 100. that's what they say
[2:23:46] y'all going fast i'm not
[2:23:47] um i will intermittent fast but i'm not
[2:23:49] going dang it fast tried that i almost
[2:23:51] lost my wife to it one time
[2:23:54] um i thought it was times the church was
[2:23:57] that
[2:23:58] you know if we remove all of the carnal
[2:23:59] things out of the picture
[2:24:01] when we fast because see fasting is
[2:24:03] supposed to be spiritual
[2:24:04] but a lot of times we occupy our minds
[2:24:07] with things
[2:24:08] and we're not focused on what the the
[2:24:09] fast is for we're just
[2:24:11] eating meals in a different way
[2:24:15] that's carnal but i wonder if we could
[2:24:17] change the church so you know what
[2:24:18] church
[2:24:19] how about this how about we don't watch
[2:24:20] no tv during that timeframe
[2:24:22] turn the sports off how about we get in
[2:24:25] prayer church
[2:24:26] you know what it's a funny thing i was
[2:24:28] told by uh the owner of my company one
[2:24:30] time
[2:24:31] he he said uh joe if you show up to work
[2:24:34] on time
[2:24:35] for a certain period of time i give you
[2:24:36] an additional thousand dollars
[2:24:39] just to show up on time i wonder if we
[2:24:40] challenge the church but jack
[2:24:42] church if y'all show up on time 10 30
[2:24:45] start the service on time
[2:24:46] at 10 30. start on time i wonder if god
[2:24:49] don't give you all the land that y'all
[2:24:50] looking for
[2:24:52] i wonder if god don't open up the doors
[2:24:54] and the opportunities
[2:24:56] i ain't nobody special i'm just a little
[2:24:57] joe
[2:24:59] but i wonder i wonder if we challenge
[2:25:03] the church
[2:25:04] to be sincere that's all it is
[2:25:09] it's justin said i ain't nothing ain't
[2:25:12] trying to take your phone away from you
[2:25:14] and all that
[2:25:15] i'm asking you to be sincere i i wonder
[2:25:18] if we ask the church to be sincere
[2:25:20] if god don't do like what he promised
[2:25:22] and malachi opened the windows
[2:25:25] and pour out blessings that you don't
[2:25:28] even have the room in this building
[2:25:31] because i heard there's been growth
[2:25:32] going on but i wonder if he'll pour out
[2:25:34] blessings that you don't have room
[2:25:36] in this building that you have to get
[2:25:40] another building
[2:25:42] in order just to contain the blessing
[2:25:45] amen amen
[2:25:52] don't know when brother jack but the
[2:25:53] lord knows when
[2:25:56] i don't think zacchaeus knew when but
[2:25:58] the lord knew when i don't think
[2:25:59] elizabeth knew when but the lord
[2:26:02] knew when mary didn't know when but the
[2:26:04] lord joseph
[2:26:06] didn't know when but the lord
[2:26:09] amen hallelujah
[2:26:13] thank you lord amen god's timing is
[2:26:16] perfect isn't it
[2:26:20] lebron said god's timing he said it
[2:26:22] doesn't just miss a tick
[2:26:25] he's right where he needs to be but we
[2:26:27] have to be right where
[2:26:29] we need to be now i've seen people
[2:26:35] they have gone through struggles they've
[2:26:37] gone through crying times and musicians
[2:26:38] you can come
[2:26:39] i've seen people go through struggles
[2:26:41] trying times i've seen people go through
[2:26:43] a season of struggle
[2:26:44] i've seen other people go through
[2:26:45] seasons plural
[2:26:48] of heartache struggle trouble they just
[2:26:51] couldn't seem to figure out
[2:26:52] how am i gonna come out of this thing
[2:26:54] and it's easy for people a lot of times
[2:26:56] to say you know
[2:26:57] uh just do this when you're going
[2:26:59] through that problem and you'll get
[2:27:00] through it and things like that it's
[2:27:01] easy for us to say that
[2:27:03] but it's hard to do it at times however
[2:27:07] this is why your faith must be built up
[2:27:09] and who you know
[2:27:11] which is jesus christ i identify with my
[2:27:13] father
[2:27:14] i am a son of god
[2:27:18] i am abraham c i believe
[2:27:21] i receive we sing these songs i believe
[2:27:23] i believe i receive i receive
[2:27:26] you know but do you really really really
[2:27:29] just
[2:27:30] ask yourself evaluate your own self do i
[2:27:32] really
[2:27:33] really believe it like that i mean this
[2:27:36] is a different level of faith this is
[2:27:37] like that faith that i'm taking into the
[2:27:39] rapture
[2:27:39] do i really have the faith to believe it
[2:27:42] like that
[2:27:44] the bible says there's a time for
[2:27:46] everything under the sun
[2:27:48] i believe we're in a time now this
[2:27:51] pandemic period this
[2:27:52] this cove at 19 i believe that god's
[2:27:55] purpose for covet was to try the faith
[2:27:56] of the believers
[2:27:59] to see will you really believe
[2:28:02] or will you back up in fear will you
[2:28:05] back up in doubt when you back up and
[2:28:06] unbelief
[2:28:10] my auntie tends to sing us all uh he may
[2:28:13] not come when you want him
[2:28:15] but he'll be there right on time
[2:28:18] right in the nick of time he's on time
[2:28:21] god
[2:28:22] yes yes galatians six says let us not be
[2:28:24] weary and well doing
[2:28:27] for in due season we shall reap
[2:28:31] you sell but you've got to go through
[2:28:33] that season
[2:28:35] that appointed period of time and
[2:28:38] you're going to probably ask me later on
[2:28:40] so
[2:28:41] i've been going through this how do i
[2:28:43] get through it
[2:28:44] um we i preached a sermon at uh my home
[2:28:48] church
[2:28:48] titled how to overcome a crisis
[2:28:52] and the answer was very basic the only
[2:28:54] way to overcome a crisis
[2:28:55] is to live through it just don't die in
[2:28:59] it
[2:29:00] just live in it that's how you overcome
[2:29:03] it
[2:29:04] because it ain't going away if it's a
[2:29:07] crisis it's there you only got one thing
[2:29:09] to do
[2:29:10] live and not die right take another
[2:29:13] breath
[2:29:14] i asked a 92 year old i said man how you
[2:29:16] how you
[2:29:17] how you doing this man you standing
[2:29:19] alive is youthful
[2:29:20] he said oh i'll tell you the secret to a
[2:29:22] long line so how he said take a breath
[2:29:25] he said if you stop breathing that's the
[2:29:27] end
[2:29:29] and while these things sound simple
[2:29:31] sometimes it's hard to take that breath
[2:29:33] but you got to take that breath you got
[2:29:36] to take that message
[2:29:38] you can't go around that message my
[2:29:39] brother i don't care if you you got some
[2:29:42] little bit of unbelief in your mind
[2:29:43] you've been questioning things in the
[2:29:44] message
[2:29:45] get that out as quickly as you can
[2:29:47] because the devil he'll try to take you
[2:29:48] on a detour he'll try to he'll try to
[2:29:50] make you take a shortcut you think it's
[2:29:51] short
[2:29:52] but really that's a bypass of your
[2:29:53] blessing the lord's saying go all the
[2:29:56] way
[2:29:57] to the very end y'all believe
[2:30:03] that's that right this song says the
[2:30:06] presence of the lord is in this place

[2:53:17] appreciate the word of the lord
[2:53:21] oh this day
[2:53:25] my god how appropriate amen
[2:53:29] the word is and brother joe was talking
[2:53:32] about how he walks into
[2:53:33] meetings now and everybody's looking at
[2:53:35] him like what we gonna do
[2:53:37] you know joe what we gonna do what are
[2:53:38] we gonna do well they don't understand
[2:53:41] they call him
[2:53:42] job because that's short for something
[2:53:45] amen that's short for joseph
[2:53:48] and there was a joseph in the bible that
[2:53:50] they was also asking what they were
[2:53:52] supposed to do
[2:53:54] amen because only joseph had the answers
[2:53:57] amen glory to god so we we thank god for
[2:54:00] these things and
[2:54:02] and and and and and i um you know that
[2:54:04] the rest of that scripture
[2:54:06] uh brother brother joseph uh focused on
[2:54:09] when
[2:54:09] the lord turned so the lord knows when
[2:54:12] but the other thing in that scripture it
[2:54:14] tells us that uh we're gonna sow in
[2:54:15] tears
[2:54:17] come on somebody we're gonna sow some
[2:54:20] things in tears but there must come a
[2:54:22] season when we begin to reap enjoy
[2:54:27] and i don't know about you but i stepped
[2:54:29] into my joy season
[2:54:32] glory to god i'm stepping into my
[2:54:34] reaping time
[2:54:36] amen i've been sowed in tears but now
[2:54:38] it's time for me to reap enjoy

[2:55:06] amen amen amen
[2:55:10] amen i tell you what i
[2:55:13] i am i'm i'm walking in this
[2:55:16] my victory is attached to my purpose
[2:55:20] amen uh i like brother jose i'm a little
[2:55:24] off so y'all just excuse me
[2:55:27] amen if a man i'm a little off because i
[2:55:30] believe the word of god
[2:55:32] and i'm not ashamed of who i am amen i'm
[2:55:35] willing to follow the instructions
[2:55:38] i ain't taking those shortcuts amen
[2:55:42] glory to god and i'm responding with a
[2:55:44] praise to a prophetic word
[2:55:45] [Music]
[2:55:47] i said i'm responding with a praise to a
[2:55:49] prophetic word
[2:55:52] lord jesus i thank you for your word
[2:55:55] here
[2:55:56] amen on this day this is this is all
[2:55:58] right
[2:55:59] brother joe made a comment that i think
[2:56:02] we all
[2:56:02] need to just reflect on he said we ought
[2:56:05] to issue
[2:56:06] a challenge to the church a man
[2:56:10] during this season of fasting and and um
[2:56:13] that certainly that was something that
[2:56:14] the lord just put in my spirit and
[2:56:16] i meant to mention it but uh you know we
[2:56:19] there's
[2:56:19] other things and this is it's probably
[2:56:21] the only day
[2:56:23] in all of history that we've had
[2:56:26] so many distractions
[2:56:29] uh you know back back in you know
[2:56:32] brother branham's day they didn't have
[2:56:33] all the distractions that we have
[2:56:34] nowadays before that time you know tv
[2:56:36] was just coming out back then
[2:56:38] radio was just coming out some of the
[2:56:41] snakes in here remember when they got
[2:56:42] their first radio in their house
[2:56:44] right and uh you know and how they just
[2:56:46] sit around just listen to the radio you
[2:56:47] know those
[2:56:48] those things were that was new new
[2:56:49] technology so they didn't have all the
[2:56:52] distractions that we have today so we
[2:56:53] have to we have to
[2:56:54] when we're fasting it's not just the
[2:56:57] food
[2:56:58] it's not just changing our diet and some
[2:57:00] will eat no food at all that's
[2:57:01] perfectly fine but i think another
[2:57:03] challenge is let's let's separate from
[2:57:05] social media
[2:57:07] let's separate from all the things that
[2:57:08] just kind of keep us
[2:57:10] so busy let's get to a spot where we can
[2:57:13] just sit and just listen to the lord
[2:57:15] hallelujah even if he don't speak sit
[2:57:18] and listen anyway
[2:57:19] glory to god but you sit down and just
[2:57:21] read your bible and
[2:57:22] listen to a tape or listen to a service
[2:57:25] do something
[2:57:26] just to stay in the presence of god but
[2:57:27] let's let's take the next 21 days when
[2:57:30] we start
[2:57:30] we got next week but after that we're
[2:57:32] going to be entering into this
[2:57:33] corporate time of fasting i believe god
[2:57:36] gonna do something for us i was also
[2:57:38] thinking that
[2:57:38] if we would just really put a man the
[2:57:41] church in the school on the top of our
[2:57:43] prayer list during that time of fasting
[2:57:45] let's see what god does for us let's
[2:57:47] just see what god does for us i got i
[2:57:49] got a confidence
[2:57:51] that our god is about to move do
[2:57:54] something supernatural
[2:57:56] amen something that blows our mind
[2:57:58] something that we're gonna have to give
[2:58:00] him glory and praise for
[2:58:02] hallelujah oh glory
[2:58:08] praise the lord let's just bow on a word
[2:58:11] of prayer
[2:58:12] amen dear god we are grateful
[2:58:17] for the word of the lord that has come
[2:58:19] forth to our hearts
[2:58:21] on this day god truly you know when
[2:58:25] and god we want to approach it father
[2:58:27] with the faith
[2:58:29] god knowing that you are turning things
[2:58:32] amen
[2:58:33] around you're turning it around
[2:58:36] and uh lord we have sowed in tears but
[2:58:39] now the time has come for us to reap
[2:58:41] enjoy lord i pray that
[2:58:44] amen this would just not just be a word
[2:58:46] spoken but father to be something that

[2:58:53] atmosphere of worship

[2:59:08] greatest thing we could ever ask for
[2:59:10] father i pray that lord as the people

[2:59:14] meditating
[2:59:16] on the things that they've heard here

[2:59:19] i believe somebody god there's maybe a
[2:59:23] promise that they've been holding to
[2:59:24] i believe lord the the seeds of
[2:59:27] manifestation
[2:59:29] lord were birthed today i believe that
[2:59:31] old god
