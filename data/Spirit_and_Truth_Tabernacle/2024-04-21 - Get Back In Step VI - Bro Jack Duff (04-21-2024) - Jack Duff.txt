thought you stepped into eternity [Music] brother I want to give you a mission report this morning okay um just wanted to um just show you what we've done um in um over the period of just um the latest update let me just put it that way and um and so the first thing we do next slide um these are the areas that we um supported as a church um let me stop back sorry these are the areas we supported as a church uh pakist s Jamaica uh we do Vision books on a regular basis as well and then I'm was going to show you um just um as it were relates to Vision books and what they have done some areas they they do um so for Pakistan um we got a request from a u Pastor s ego Fellowship group and they needed some Bibles right and so it's a lot of um um countries out there not I guess um third world countries you would to say that needs um Bibles so they send in requests and we sent them $175 for some Bibles next slide and we got a request from a Jamaica Pastor who asked help to complete their Church floor they building a floor and I think we've helped them in in before can you play that CLI flip Force see not working you click on this side on this the um the picture okay well you see it you hear it too sorry there we go can you hear the volume it's not on mute does not come through the computer either okay okay all right well you can see they're trying to they're building you know the putting in the floor and this the concrete they're pouring the concrete hopefully the other one will play this one's kind of okay next slide um in this one I wanted to um let you hear on the why Vision books right and what's the impact and this is Brother coffee talking hopefully that will play MH no oh my I'm sorry well basically he's he's talking through um the need for um message books um being published because um in countries that um don't have access to message books and as a result of that um message um Vision books was started right because there's a need for for books in remote areas in those remote areas don't have um access to well maybe even electricity or digital means of playing it on your phone or tablets and stuff those kind of things so as a result of that Vision books was created to fulfill that need and also there's needs for um there was a story he was telling about a uh a pastor who had he did have um a phone but he did not have a a Bible actual Bible so he would kind of use his phone um and but just to have a Bible to preach from he did not have it so um as a result of that um he asked us to help him with some Bibles and stuff so we send um 300 a month uh for uh support for vision Vision books and so we contribute to the overall mission of vision books we do um um the we print the books in English and in m multiple different languages um for like for Zimbabwe you would have it you have a Pakistanian language you have India you have AOS um so it's a whole different um um experience when you get actually get the message printed in your own language um they also uh we also do um um pictures like there's a Hoffman head of Christ we send um that picture over as well and we also are a um a repository in terms of um individuals who have a a burden to support other countries and we have those individuals but they don't have the means to print and so in one instance there was u a brother he was printing um I believe it was uh message books or a Bible and it cost them $9 a book but through um Vision books we're able to print the same book for 38 cents a book so we have that c c u capability um and sources to use to uh be able to do that and brother Barry talks about that in this in this video that we can't hear okay so the next the next slide um I don't know if they can play this one this is actually uh um a group of Believers in um Uganda who were receiving their Bibles and they were very elated just a whole I mean we sit and we have Bibles all over and we can go to different stores and but in these countries it the they don't have that right they don't have that um that access so when they get those Bibles and we just send them you know by you know people donate to Vision books and we just able to use those funds to um send Bibles we send a lot of Bibles to Zimbabwe as well um so but this is just one here of people praising the Lord for being able to receive um Bibles I think that's the last right yep praise the Lord amen come on give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen amen we ought to be grateful that we have to give and when you see where you're giving is going to and how it's helping other brothers and sisters come to the Lord and see the people re joing over receiving Bibles that people won't even pick up anymore you ought to be grateful I don't care what circumstance any of us are in sometimes we're not in circumstances like that it's the grace of God that he allowed us to live where we live to sit where we sitting and be in the condition that we're in and we ought to be grateful and happy to give hey give with a joyful heart you're giving unto the Lord praise the Lord amen sister Shalom will you come this [Applause] morning and thank you brother Quint [Music] thank you for the [Music]

mercy of the Lord Jesus amen amen my my I'll tell you what uh while you're standing uh I'll go ahead and read the scripture but I did have a couple of things to just mention uh I want to thank the um be grateful for the the the youth Fellowship that happened on yesterday I appreciate um those that work that out amen I I heard it was turned out really really nice so happy about that I appreciate the specials this morning from uh sister Abby and sister Shalom praise the Lord God bless you and and uh the wonderful um update that we have on what we're doing in missions um it's just a it's a blessing to be able to kind of see how other people benefit uh from things and just if you're not a part of Missions what what we ask is that you try to give $25 a month towards that right and $25 a month some sometimes supports a whole family to be able to do Mission work and uh so if you wouldn't mind amen and just think about half a tank of gas amen just give it to the Lord and uh let somebody be blessed all over the world with that $25 amen musicians I'm I'm I'm done I'm going let y'all be seated uh I'm going back to Joel uh this morning and um I think I had oh oh um uh brother Troy I I did need to mention you know he was telling a testimony to me on Friday night he was um at work and had a um it was uh almost a a tragic accident uh and so they're still you know he's there this morning just trying to take care of some things but he they had this big big job planned and and he said there was like 13,000 vots or something like that coming through and uh they were going to be shutting it down to be able to make some changes but one of the guys decided he wanted to start a little early on the project before they could actually shut it down and uh brother tro walked into room and saw what he was doing he's like well okay that you can do that you know just to get prepped and ready and brother tro walked out the room and when he walked out the room he heard a a great explosion and uh and he saw the man running out of there you know and he was just just on fire his arms got you know burned and and uh just just a a really bad thing and and had he not walked out uh he would have been inside the room and uh and the other thing he says that there was 13,000 votes coming through here says but they were it's a transform in that room that kind of steps it down to about 480 and this man got hit on the 480 side rather than the 13,000 side because had he got hit on that side he might not be living uh to tell the story and then had the 13,000 side uh blown to then brother Troy would have been affected by that even on the outside and uh so I told Brother Troy I said see the scripture tells us that the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them from all their troubles and I say that man got protected by your angel Hallelujah that's yeah that that man was protected because you were there had you not been there who knows would have happened but because there was a greater power than 13,000 votes your angel was there to stop that so we thank the Lord for watching over our brother amen and and bringing him through praise the Lord and I don't believe it was his coworker it was a a vendor uh that was doing the work so uh we want to pray for that that gentleman that God would just touch him and bring him uh healing to his body and may he come to realize that it was nothing but the grace of God Amen uh that kept him from that moment praise the Lord so continue to keep brother Troy in prayer uh we'll we'll read here uh Joel 1 and uh verse 4 it says that which the palom orth left hath the low conceit and that which the Locust have left have the cankerworm eaten that which the cankerworm have left have the caterpillar eaten and uh over at Joel 2 praise the Lord uh y'all y'all probably going by the time this year is over y'all going to know the scripture by heart I want you to know it by heart too cuz I was telling some of my brothers there's so many little things in here and we going to take our time and get every one of them out of there every little nugget we can and we're going to polish it up but I I I I am one that believes that it's not just something on the pages of the Bible but we are living it right before our very eyes amen it's being expressed uh right here in our midst so we thank God uh here in in Joel 2 and uh verse uh 23 it says be glad uh then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten uh the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God uh that have dealt um wondrously with you my people should never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be asham amen let's just uh have a brief word of prayer praise the Lord father we are again grateful for the privilege and opportunity we have to open scripture but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to make the word live uh for the time in which we're living so God take control over our thoughts may you present what you want to your people and God we uh just ask that you get all the glory we thank you for watching over brother Troy uh on the job it could have been another way but God you protected him and and showed Lord that you are uh Jehovah nii and um God we just ask that uh the the man that was impacted by this that you would bring healing to his body not just to his body but also to his soul uh we thank you for all things that have happened and uh uh God pray that you bless the remain of this service and you get all the glory and all the honor in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated uh so good to have my grandson uh in the house of the Lord on today amen Elias is is with us and the Lord has blessed him he just celebrated uh his fifth birthday amen amen amen amen growing up but we uh we we give God glory for him Amen Let me just get my timer here set and um we will continue our journey this morning and get back and step praise the Lord all right so so um I read the scripture and uh the last time we were together I started on a little journey that I want to continue uh uh today praise the Lord and um this I want to go forward I read this other scripture here in Joel and and you know it was a blessing i was um after we we kind of shared this we were talking about the the the sign in the heaven uh that was going to happen with that eclipse and uh brother um Frankie had sent to me a uh clip after the service he said that uh that Eclipse was running through uh Seven Cities that had the name ninova uh and uh you know and and I'm like wow that so I you know you have to fact check things so I fact checked it and and it was right it was seven seven different cities um that was you know that that that Eclipse was passing through that had the name Nineveh and uh you know and I don't think those things happen by chance or by accident you know we know that um um that's the city that the prophet Joel was supposed to go to uh um not Joel the prophet Jonah was supposed to go to Nineveh but he chose to try to go to Tarsus uh but nonetheless he did make it to Nineveh he got there by the mouth of a fish or the belly of a whale but he made it to Nineveh uh uh just like God uh ordained for him to go now I'm going tell you something you can either either do it your way or you can do it God's way but ultimately it's going to get done praise the Lord amen you can run but you can't hide amen and and and and and and and and Jonah learned that lesson and uh I believe we got a lot of Jonas today glory to God Amen trying to get the tarses but you better get yourself to Nineveh you better catch a boat or a plane or else you're going to go through the belly of a well but you're going to Nineveh amen but we we thank the Lord for that but uh but uh I wanted to just kind of bring this in we read this scripture uh the last time and it shall come to pass afterward this is the continuation of the Book of Joel uh chapter 2 and it shall come to pass after that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see Visions now let me let me just uh pause I want you to understand verse 28 is a part of the restoration Oh Glory to God brother we come here on Wednesday night we was not expecting that brother to pass through but they called me and then we said we made a quick decision say let them come and my God uh what an anointing struck this little place here on Wednesday night and I left here with an expectation that God's word is going to be made manifest right here in our midst uh but I need to help you to understand that before these things can be fully released amen there are some things that must be handled right because all we're doing is hindering the the the the presence of God and the spirit of God uh when we don't handle these little things amen but but here's a promise from God it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy amen your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmades in those days will I pour out my spirit amen and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and the Jerusalem shall be deliverance and let me just add this and in spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call I believe that if you got a problem you can't solve amen bring it to Jesus cuz he can fix it glory to God I believe that so these are promises that we have and uh we're holding on with everything we have this is all part of the restoration now I'm going to go real quick at the beginning here because this is um uh just reminding you some of the things that we have talked about so we we talked about the four stages of ezekiel's dve bones and and also when we're looking at the scripture uh of uh our restore sayith the Lord the death Messengers were the palmerworm amen ate the brotherly love and the fruit of the spirit amen the Locust ate the leaves of divine Fellowship praise God the cankerworm uh attacked the the doctrine or the religion or the bark of the tree the covering of the tree that's what the cankerworm attack uh the caterpillar goes in and he sucks the very life out of the tree it just looks so dead it looked defeated it looked like uh there's there's nothing on I mean you might as well just prepare it for fire but brother and sister you need to know that inside the roots of the tree amen there's a predestinated root and life has to come back out through that predestinated root praise God hlj Amen so in in ezekiel's Dry Bones the four stages uh God told him uh told Ezekiel he says I will lay senu upon you and this senu was the tendons Amen in the body this Valley that was full of dry bones a hopeless situation this but he says I'm going to lay sin you upon these dry bones and these are the tendons or the natural cords to hold the body together and not not also this and to form the means of feeling you know because what happens in churches when the pomor comes in and takes the Brotherly Love out amen we lose feeling one for the other blessed be the name of the Lord but the Holy Ghost has promised amen that he's going to restore and that feeling one for one for another will come back into the church amen I'll lay senu upon you amen the next thing he does is he brings flesh upon us right and uh and that's the soft part of the animal body and we need a heart of Flesh to be tender-hearted towards God as well as when we're tender-hearted towards God it makes us tender-hearted one to another uh he says I'm going to cover you with skin and this is the natural covering of our flesh which is the same thing the cankerworm took it took the bark the natural covering for the tree but God said I'm going to cover you with skin and give you n natural covering for that flesh and the last thing you're going to do is put breath in you and your breath is your life Hallelujah the caterpillar sucked the life out but God putting the breath back in put the life right back in all right let's go on now amen so here when we talk about this heart of Flesh that we need amen this is what we're really dealing with Ezekiel 36 amen uh 24- 28 for I will take you from among the Heathen gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land amen then will I sprinkle clean water water upon you and ye shall be clean amen from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you amen and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh what a promise from almighty God and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people amen and I will be your God so this is a promise that we're looking at uh in this rest season of restoration getting a new heart a new spirit as well as the holy spirit in the middle of all of that now I read this quote to you amen um uh last time we were here but I want to just bring it back around again cuz when we look look at Ezekiel and the scripture that we just read in Ezekiel 36 brother brandham tells us now Ezekiel was prophesying or foretelling what would take place in a age to come so this wasn't even for his day but this was for our day not in his age but a prophet is a Seer and is referred to in the Bible as the eagle who goes way high in the air and higher you go the further you can see now not only is Ezekiel prophesying about a age to come let me go a little further Joel is also prophesying about an age to come amen it's something that's supposed to happen in our day not just on the day on the day of Pentecost it it did happen there but it said in the last days will I pour out my spirit so this is something that still continues until this day Hallelujah he says so he says so the eagle Soares up much higher than than any other bird there's no bird can go with the eagle and there's no I like the eagle the Hulk hasn't got a chance in his sight and the Hulk cannot stand the altitude to where the eagle can so he would die see he hasn't got the makeup that the eagle has now it goes a little further it says and God liken the prophet to the eagle that would go in the makeup of a prophet he's a he he uh he is a sear that is in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion of the church I just love that statement he climbs beyond the emotions of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that God brings him up into a real alone alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see things that is a come then he brings them back down among the members of the body to forell them of what is in the making and I'm telling you what's in the making I'm telling there's an outpouring of the spirit of God that is in the making for spirit and Truth Tabernacle I'm talking about a great outpouring oh Hallelujah and you want to be in church on the day that the outpouring happens you don't want to be streaming on that day you want to be present brother would you would you have wanted to stream the day of Pentecost not me I want to be in the room amen glory to God so I'm telling you there's a great outpouring amen that's a part of the restoration amen that we can look forward to he says so God had took the eagle that God had took Ezekiel higher to took Ezekiel High far up and let him see around about 2600 years now watch this amen and it says uh now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and it would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and F gospel people has been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his spirit that is your spirit amen God got to give you a new spirit and that's not that's not the spirit of God you even recognize the change and some other people even recognize the change but that's still not the Holy Ghost yet amen the reason that he got to give you a new spirit says he says uh then I put my spirit in you I give you a new spirit and then I put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and you think you got the Holy Spirit trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't divy up to that now he said that's that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth now the reason you have to get the new spirit is because when his Spirit comes along your spirit will agree with his spirit amen oh my my my my my my my let me keep going here now we we going we going a few places uh it says many people that spirit that new spirit God has to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit Well some people so mean and we stopped there and I'm glad this at the beginning of the sermon I won't stop here cuz I got more to say but I am just going go going to highlight this a little bit some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if he come in now now what this mean I I I just did a a quick quick uh definition um you know look at look at the definition for this and and what mean is it's an you're unwilling to give or to share you're unwilling to give you so mean you unwilling to give or to share things come on I'm going say that again you un willing to give or if they doing it I don't want nothing to do with it you so mean all right hello somebody I'mma step into your living room amen that that that's a mean spirit let me just see I think I got something on this in a second let me let me just see something real quick before I before I give it away [Laughter] uh oh my my my my my my I might have not brought it but if I didn't it's okay I can I can tell it to you all right but uh you know brother Brandon was making a statement here that I was I was reading you know and I was going to I I don't think I inserted but but when we talk about mean uh and and and let me let me two things I'm I'm going say on this it's it's it's it's a unwillingness to give or share things now and this I'm just reading the definition especially money unwilling to give or share especially money some people mean with their tithes mean with they offering mean praise God and and let me let me preach to the young people y'all going to let me talk here a little bit God done bless you with a job huh you're making good money praise the Lord but you so mean with your money that you can't even offer to pay one bill in the house mer you just spend your money up like I don't know what but you mean you're unwilling to give or share things especially money we trying to get rid of that Spirit see this mean Spirit you got to understand um it don't come from God no sir anything evil like that don't come from God it came from Satan right and and and when you recognize that you are being anointed by something like that you know you're not being anointed by the Holy G ghost that's why you got to pray to get that thing off of you amen this me means unkind spiteful or unfair in all your dealings you're unkind you're spiteful and you're unfair all right we want to get that mean Spirit brother random say so so some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves let Al with God if he come in that's right so doubtful and there's there's the other one so doubtful an up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes and and notice now he say so ding up and down you can't be like that as a Christian sir amen and and and and sometimes uh things will happen and uh and and and we can kind of get into this Gloomy mode but you got to choose not to go there you got to choose not to allow that that cloud of Doom to settle on you amen so doubt and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes amen I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his holy spirit in there Amen to dwell with you and abide with you thank God for that now I wanted to um just kind of drop this little thought in here because I was thinking about this being mean and everything um I I I put this in I don't know why I put it right here but it's here so let me read it he say that's what the that's what the the uh that's what the church needs today is a hidden let me just make sure I ain't got nothing out of place here because I I want I want okay that's all right all right it says uh that's what the church needs today is a hidden consecrated life you can't be didd uh diddle dabbling along with the world and impersonating and acting like them and hear it with Christ because you're trying to Fashion After the world you're trying to live like the next Church you're trying to belong to a better organization we better clothes do so and so that's not comply with Christianity Christianity is a sacrific life hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost amen all right let me just go a little further these are quotes that I I had um when we were together last and I'm just re repeating that but we're going further says that's what the real Christian Life consist of not of how well you can do this or how well you can sing that's all right how well you can preach that's fine but that isn't it it's a hidden life consecrated the veil curtains dropped around you and you're dead and you're buried and you're hid in God through Christ and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost amen this is what we're looking for as as being real Christians I mean the world has no nothing to offer us we realize that the only thing that we need is more of God and when you get hid behind the veil with him you ain't thinking about nothing that the World got to offer amen church we we some of us live like we going to stay here forever but brother we we getting ready to leave here there's a Rapture that awaits us praise God a changing of the body that awaits us so let's get ourselves prepared now let me um let me just inject praise God this little statement I want to um I I I I I just thank the Lord all right here we go brother Brandon makes the statement the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another you can't call yourself having a Holy Ghost and you misbehaving with it sir right the Holy Ghost don't misbehave itself in one person behave itself in another see that that new spirit amen a new heart new spirit Holy Spirit when you get the holy spirit it's going it's going to form your life into its character yes sir you going to do the things that Jesus did you going to walk the way Jesus walked you're going to talk the way Jesus talk why would you do that because you got the same spirit in you that Jesus had in him so the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and and behave itself and another it'll make each person come into its character Oh Glory to God the Holy Ghost will make each person come into its character because it's a spirit that leads you amen and makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and not only live but love to do it watch this now he says oh how you love to give up them things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in amen amen how it cleanses you and washes you and and and and puts a desire in you to follow him and a thirst and a Hunger for More of it just bathing yourself he brings realities amen see I I I I I like this I I like this you know I don't know about you but I I I I I feel like just the devil just always got a little something that he trying to get me wrapped up in this and wrapped up in that and I want to be wrapped up in God I want to be wrapped up in God and I and I and I want to just love to do it right am amen it's not it's not something that I'm forced to do that somebody makes me but I I want to just love to do this I want to love to be in his presence amen uh uh uh that's that's just my desire he brings these realities now we're talking about this new spirit and amen this this the the the the the the the new heart new spirit Holy Spirit but now let me just kind of go a little further because we we want to just bring out something here in in in a second um brother random says this in the message enticing Spirits people people can jump up and down and shout all night long and speak in tongues like pouring Peas on a dry cide walk right out the next morning with enough temper so mean with enough temper to fight a buzz s see we got to get rid of that amen with enough temper to fight bu go right on out and tell something in the church that'll cause the whole church to be broke up amen somebody tell something in the church and I'm I'm going read another quote on that in in a little bit but you tell a lie in the church and you cause the whole church to be broke up over a lie hallelujah amen cause the whole church to be broke up it's nothing in the world but an enticing demon Spirit brother random said we want to come back to the word for God is Purity purity holy amen that's right enticing Spirits versus the word of God you know now you if you tell a lie on somebody and that thing get spread like that through the church you know you got to go back to that person and make that right praise the Lord not only you have to go back to that person to make it right you got to go back to the person that you lied to and you got to make that right hello somebody this how we keep the devil at bait and I'mma tell you when you when you when you uh when you get to the point where you're going back and making things right then you real you watch what you say make sure you got facts do some fact checking sir come on somebody before you just go out releasing stuff cuz somebody can't a lot of us can't wait to get information we take that information just run all over the world with you got to go back and make them things right clean that up we're trying to get Revival flowing through the church let see I you know let me let me just kind of put it this way so we're we're very clear you know there's let me let me I got a let me just say a lot here let me let me just let me let me just kind of take my time here um you know in in marriage in marriage I'm going use this example if a husband and wife is having a disagreement and the wife decides that she going to go and her Mama tell her sister tell everybody you know her good friends about what's going on in her house praise the Lord now now what happens is that at some point in time the husband and wife they make up glory to God they get the thing straight and then you go out amongst your family in at some family gathering and then everybody looking at your husband funny cuz all these people you done told but see they didn't get a chance to make up with your husband they still holding on to everything you said and you and all you say oh no no we beyond that now well you never told him that you was beyond that and see had you not said anything in the first place you wouldn't have to go back to them some stuff you just need to keep close to the vest people don't need to know everything that's right hello somebody people don't need to know everything especially something bad about your brother well I want to be the one that say this but but you know no no you do want to be the one that say it that's why you saying it but fact check things before you just release it cuz it could be a lie from the devil coming and try to block the church Spirit get inside the church over a lie I ain't shaking your hand brother because somebody told me a lie about you Lord I don't want nothing to do with you but somebody told a lie about you brother and and now who who who really in the wrong you believe a lie it been proven to be a lie and your AC still show that you believe the lie I'mma keep preaching you know when I when I bought my house I never had a a pool before I I know nothing about no pool and I remember um going you know one day and I'm seeing this pool when I when I moved in the it was blue pool was blue and looking real good all a sudden start turning green so I went to the pool store and start telling them everything I was going through said hey you going to need to put this chemical in and put that chemical in put this chemical and and I I I throw a little this and I throw a little that I'm throwing everything in there boric acid and and yellow out and and and and chlorine and tablets and I got all kind of stuff and that pool getting greener and Greener and Greener and I'm something is wrong here sir I don't know what's wrong with my pool I was thinking I needed a uh to get somebody to come in and fix it you know because I was I was out of ideas looking at everything on YouTube that I could find but then it was one little piece that I was missing Hallelujah if you want to get the green out the pool you had to get to the filter of the pool and the filter is the heart Hallelujah you see the heart is what what everything their blood passes through that heart and pumps that and keeps your body clean come on somebody so so just like the all the water that was coming it was going through a dirty filter when I got the filter clean when I got the filter replaced then the pool went blue again and what we're trying to do is get the filter replaced get get the heart changed God has to give you a new heart a new spirit and then put his Spirit on the midst of that that's how you keep the church clean Hallelujah we don't want you to come in here and shout and speak in tongues and then be mad enough to fight a buz off you know something wrong with you you got a bad temper yes sir all right I'm reading a quote but I don't want you to pull this up I'm just going to read the quote you can just pull up the picture I'm reading from the the the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride so you know where I'm pulling this quote from but please don't pull the quote quote up just leave the picture brother brandom say let me take this board just a minute brother brandom walks over and he draws on the board he says now here's a human heart you look to the left you can see a human heart he says and here is a human heart look to the right you see another human heart so now this one over here has a snake in it see the snake heart to the left praise God he says this one this one over here has a snake in it that's sin so that's why we put sin there underneath the snake the snake heart here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it and that's why you see the dove heart it says um which is the holy spirit here he has a life where this one here just press next one time for me this one here he has malice hatred Envy but he said that's what's causing it this fellow here and when he's saying that's what's causing this fellow here I'm going need y'all brothers to be with me on this on the cameras cuz I'mma uh move a little bit so y'all y'all stay with me am amen and and make sure the shock keep me on the screen praise the Lord I got to make sure my brother's on top of that uh so so so so what what he's saying here it says um it says um uh this one here has malice hatred Envy this one has malice hatred envy and it says what's causing the malice the hatred and the Envy is this snake in the heart glory to God Amen what causes the malice the hatred Envy is because there's a snake there sin that's there now he goes on he says now uh well this one here says this one over here has love hit next and joy and longsuffering and that that's what does it down here so this one got love joy and longsuffering and what does it is because there's a dove there in the heart which represents the Holy Spirit Hallelujah glory to God Amen now watch this he says now when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sins you only done this press next Hallelujah now when you ask and you forgiven of your sins you only done this you taken that away what she did was took all that away how ever the thing that made you do all of that is still here and until you get a new heart on praise God it won't change from these things to these things you got to have a new heart you got to have a new spirit then you got to have his Spirit yes sir here next again for me brother brandom says you're forgiven of your sins you've only done this taking that away but in the thing that made you do it is still there that that's the old root of evil is still there then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave your gave you of your sins notice so now and all he was telling us is that when you when you repent it just take these things away but the thing that made you do it is still there what we trying to do is not just take these things away we want this to be changed so that this will manifest all the time it'll it'll manifest amen the fruits of the spirit remember remember the canker worm comes in he takes away the fruits of the spirit sir we're trying to get that back into the church we got to preach it back in cuz and and and there's a promise that I will restore so this is what's coming back I told you look for it in our church we preaching we putting it in seed form because this is what's got to come back into the church ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah glory to God you know T typically when a farmer is planting seed it's not an easy job it's not a fun job the fun job is going out there picking and and it's already done grow uh it come to maturity and uh you get to you get to enjoy the fruits of your labor but sometime you got to actually labor first before you can enjoy the fruits of your labor amen amen right oh I I I I I I I I I know what we're doing here now let's go on a little further here glory to God glory to God glory to God brother random say prophesying is good speaking in tongues is right let me let me let me let me let me let me y y'all y'all heard that freeing statement the brother was telling us on on on on on uh on Wednesday night how uh often times gifts are quenched in the church sometime it's quenched through preaching I'm going say that again gifts in the church can be quenched through preaching gifts in the church can also be released through preaching sir however what we want to preach is how to properly align the gifts yes sir because this is all part of the restoration right but but here speaking in tongues is right oh my God now now what happens though sometimes a person might have the gift of tongues and there are afraid to speak in tongues because they don't think that there's an interpreter in the building to interpret their tongues so they'll just stop they won't they won't they they they they'll quench the spirit but what the brother told us on F on Wednesday night it my it was we it was just very lifegiving it says when you read the scripture in the book of Corinthians amen that's right Hallelujah Corinthians 14 it says when the spirit kind of come upon you and you feel like I just and I I saw this happen I saw this happen uh in brother Smiley one time we were out praying for my Beth and brother Smiley was sitting there and you know he was he wasn't thinking about speaking in no tongues he would just sitting there and all of a sudden just hit him and you I'm like what he up and and he he he just couldn't hold it he just let that tongue go I say brother ain't nothing wrong with that and and often times we we have things like that happen in church and we just kind of afraid you can feel the spirit of God on you right come on somebody so so so rather than think like well ain't nobody here to speak in Tong I mean to interpret the tong so I'm not going to say nothing it says know what you're supposed to do according to scripture if God puts that unction in you to speak in tongues what you're supposed to do is pray that he would give you the interpretation yes sir oh my god father if you given me this unction to speak in tongues pray God God please give me the interpretation or give somebody else the interpretation now if God don't give give interpretation and God don't give nobody else to get the interpretation don't give you the interpretation or give somebody else to get the interpretation then you just okay next time that come up upon me I'm going just keep quiet in this service in this service I'mma say that again I'mma keep quiet in this service now the next service come up that that that that unction come again Hallelujah on glory to God Amen you pray for an interpretation praise God and if you don't get that interpretation then okay God I'm going just keep quiet I'm not going to do this no more Hallelujah cuz I don't I don't I don't want to be seen in the wrong light I want my gift to be subject to the prophets and God I I mean this is the gift that you gave me you're going to have to manifest a whole part of it because it's not just the speaking in tongues the interpretation got to come too now Lord I'm going to be obedient to you but I I need you to show up God right amen now now I'm going tell you just just my own person uh issues that I had that God had to help me with I was always concerned about a person speaking in tongues and then also interpreting the same tongue I always had a problem with that but the Bible actually say that that person supposed to pray for an interpretation and then on the natural that's right on the natural brother H way can speak in Spanish hello hello and also interpret it to English I got Saints in here can speak in Creole and also tell you what they said in English so if it can happen on the natural why can't it happen on the spiritual amen amen prophesying is good speaking in tongues is Right interpretation is Right shouting is right but you can do those things without being first fundamentally baptized into Christ those are those are only fruits not fruits of the spirit that's gifts of the Spirit it says like what if uh what if I go out here today brought down some of the Great Northern wine sap apples tied them onto a palm tree I I took some apples from somewhere else and tie brought them down here to Florida and tied them onto a palm tree and said now look here what a fine apple tree I got it's true there's there's a tree and apples are hanging on it but it isn't the product of the tree so we don't want to tie things onto the tree we we want this to come from the inside to manifest on the outside hallu oh we we ain't got to tie love onto the tree we ain't got to tie joy and Longs suffering onto the tree if if you really got the spirit of God dwelling inside these are the things that come out automatic and remember the Holy Ghost won't behave itself in one person and then misbehave itself in another person amen it's the same Holy Ghost it's the same Spirit of Jesus Christ all right all right let's go on a little further there you are through faith you can do great things and yet not be born again of the spirit of God this is what we talking about here we don't want we don't want that in the church where we got all the manifestation and gifts but people so mean after they finish preach I mean speaking in tongues prophesying giving giving uh interpretation but then they can't shake my hand after church Lord running from me run I'm running from you I don't want to see you I don't want to look at you I don't I wait a minute we Brothers and Sisters in Christ you know I'm close the all and I am to many people in my own family this is my family right here and you mean I can't Fellowship my I can't I can't come and hug your neck and really mean it brother I love you sister I love you God bless you and really mean it man I've been I the whole week I didn't get a chance to fellowship with you I'm so glad I got a chance to see you on today I'm I'mma give y'all a chance turn around and tell your neighbor so good to see you so good to see my God feel good to just shake a brother hand you don't know what a person been going through and when they just see another believer it just means something to them you don't know what what type of struggles they had even at home with their own families and how the family done ridicule them and put them down and criticize them and and told them they crazy but they see somebody dressed the way that they dressed and look the way that they look they they just feel like I I got a kindred [Music] spirit who was that the man used to say you yet holding on yeah I'm yet holding on well keep on keeping on there are through faith you can do great things and yet not be born of the spirit of God be careful there it's a danger line Pentecostal people don't claim everything you hear of God I just talk about you know the the the the gifts and you waiting on and you pray that God to give you an interpreter but now you also don't want to be like the lady brother brandom told us about we watched that too now all y'all already know if you know your message you know the [Music] lady this lady every time brother Brandon would finish his sermon get ready to go into altar call huh Hallelujah she get her hat then she reach down and pull up her stockings and she just got herself prepared for the moment it wasn't the Holy Spirit actually coming upon her she knew she was going to do this no matter what so she she she get her her hat fixed and her stocking prepared and the first night she just let out that tongue no interpretation they said okay and here here's the thing I'm going to tell you something about this it wasn't only brother Brandon recognizing this lady's Spirit other people in the congregation recognize her spirit they recognize her spirit was wrong and and and and brother brother B brother Billy Paul told us that say daddy that lady coming back in here tonight that sister coming back tonight and they already knew they they didn't have to know know her name they knew who what sister they was talking about cuz she did this all the time next night he preached at the exact moment that he closes his text cuz she knew not to do it while he was preaching that was out of line but as soon as she closed his text and then they just they just sitting there looking at her and she rise up again to let out Tong no interpretations well the third night come brother Bram brother brandom brother Billy daddy that lady here okay no worries preach his sermon he watched again cuz she had the same routine you knew what she was getting ready to do up and she start speaking in tongues well this time she got a little a rude awakening the other time she thought she was being received but she was being watched every time now don't come in here and get a root Awakening we really wanted to be the spirit of God we believe in it but we also know people can get in their flesh so this time she did it the third time she did it she heard word the prophet say sit down from the pull pit yes sir sit down she say yes I'm talking to you sit down she sat down but was on fire you want to talk about getting mean now here's the other thing about her she had other people working with her and we found out who her team was once she got called out because the team got upset yes sir why brother Brandon hand it like that oh he grieved the spirit he quenched the spirit oh oh no he quenched The Spirit Well they had to put him back in the word her pastor stand up to say cuz the pastor's on the team brother Brandon the spirit wasn't on you at the time the spirit was on her Spirit was on her God was finished dealing with you now God was dealing with her and you shouldn't have quenched Spirit say brother you don't I'm surprised you say that about that because the B I was actually going into altar call three times I tried to go and talk call she interrupted it every time and and you know the Bible say the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets so if your if your spirit can't get subject to the the word we don't want your spirit you need a new heart you need a new spirit and you need the Holy Spirit sir amen I hope I brought a balance on that hallelu through faith you can do great things and yet not be born again in the spirit of God be careful there it's a danger line Pentecostal people don't claim everything you hear of God I hope you don't get any angry with me when you get angry then you get mean brother R say I just love you you put a real old father loves his children he he sees that they're going to get hurt if they don't watch he's not a real daddy and what he's saying that if I if I know that you're G to get hurt you can actually get hurt by gifts and if we don't keep a balance on it you'll get hurt by and like the brother said we don't want we don't want to where like no gifts at all the gifts are supposed to be in every local body but it's got to be done according to order exactly right oh I I the promise told us that you know your your your your your uh young men will dream dreams and and and see old men see visions and upon my handmades I pour out my spirit and they will prophesy I done seen that happen right here in in our church I seen people that weren't even living right prophesying Holy Ghost comeing there and and and and and they turn around prophesying to somebody else and telling them what you know God going to do this and God going to do that and they not even living right but see that's what happened when anointing get brother Bram say anointing can get so great even a drunk man even a drunk man will feel it he' be impacted by it oh my so my I can't have this happen but my uh computer crash I got the the slides there so it's okay we're we're we're going to be all right we just going to take our time and get this back to where we need to be and um we're going to keep preaching so maybe God wanted that point just to soak in so we'll uh all right just give me one second I got to restart this happened to the brother on on uh on Wednesday too but the de when the devil the devil know we got something boy he going to fight us all the way through but he's liar he's a liar we know how to wait him out amen we know how to wait that devil out just go me go go to next here and I just let me just kind of see here all right so be careful don't look at Great high things great crowds don't look at Great demonstrations or great healings or great things like that look up at the great savior the Lord Jesus the fruit of the spirit is love what is God love and look look at this now if you can't love your enemy now first of all first of all before we go too deep in that let me just announce if you did not know this already your brother and your sister in Christ is not your enemy if you didn't know this I'm going help you understand your biggest enemy your biggest enemy is you right so you got to overcome you amen praise the Lord he says if you can't love your enemy no matter what he says about you let me just stop and and just just pause on you think the reason I don't shake the hand because they said this the reason I don't do it because they said that no matter what they say if you can't love them your neighbor no matter what he says about you if from your heart not with your lips my God not with your knowledge that you should be doing it as a Christian but something in your heart makes you love them anyway I told y'all before brother brandom had a now everything that people did to him and it wasn't right but brother brandom had such a way that uh people knew you could not tell his enemies from his friends that's the type of uh relationship we want to have with God you can't tell my enemies from my friends Something in Your Heart Makes you love them anyway regardless of what you say then it's time to come to the altar again you just never quite got what you thought you or what what what what what really you shouldn't should have had amen see you probably you just didn't get what you thought or what you supposed to get you didn't get it so this this love has to come from the heart and the only way it can come from the heart is that the spirit of God has to dwell in you to produce this amen Church all right I got some things I I I I I got to make sure I say so that's why I'm waiting on this computer to come right on back amen go on to the next slide for me and and uh what what slide am I own okay yeah this now this is important we're talking about the uh the fruits of the spirit the that that old that first insect just started out he just took this Brotherly Love from the church he took the took the fruit of the spirit from the church now uh I want to just read this scripture because this is what the fruit of the spirit we're going to get into what this is all about here in a second but before before we talk about the fruit of the spirit we got to talk about this this works of the flesh bear with me oh yes thank you Jesus I'm back I'm back I'm back right where I want to be I am back and I'm cuz I I just have a feeling that this going to be one to set somebody free and that's why that's why that's why the devil's Frighteners he a want you to hear this one oh oh yes God gave me a part of this this morning so I had to I got to put this in here look at this The Works of the flesh which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings and such like anything like that of the which I tell you before as I have told also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God you ain't going to heaven living like this is you can come to church you can jump and Shout in church you can speak in tongues in church but if you keep this stuff in your life you ain't going to heaven right and let's just let's just break some of this down let's break some of this down I'm starting with with that word variance in verse 20 VAR variance when it says um The Works of the flesh are Manifest this variance is is it's Strife it's contention it's debate if you always look in a try to debate something something wrong with your spirit you know what emulations is is jealousy hey when you allow the spirit of jealousy to come into the church hello somebody and you try to outdo everybody else all right jealousy and jealousy is something that came from from Satan because he anointed came with that same Spirit that's where we saw he was jealous of his brother's offering amen can I go a little further sometimes we can be jealous of somebody else's special or the musicians can be jealous of somebody playing Hallelujah you get all kind of spirits on you well I I think I could do that better I should have did no you got the wrong Spirit on you pray for them that they'll be able to do it better amen hello Church we got to get rid of the works of the flesh preachers get jealous of one another ah brother Jack should have let me preach I would do this and I would do no no get rid of that jealous Spirit emulations you know what wrath is and this it's it's it's it's angry anger it's Heat and the other other thing they said is anger forth with boiling up and soon subsiding again sometime the devil just get you all boiled up on some situation you get all the way up here and oh you don't know me you don't know me I hope I don't get to know you if you anger just get them all the way up here and then they come all the way back down but you want to know why that pot stopped boiling again because that thing is still there yes sir and until you get that out of there you won't be talking like that all the time brother I just pray for you sister I just pray for you and really mean that right but just boiling up and simmering down boiling up and simmering down and sometimes you look for things so you can just Show Your Colors you look for situations that you can just step in and just really just show yourself Christians don't do that you know what s itions is in that scripture verse 20 seditions is division you look for things that cause division now this word variance also mean Strife but why would Paul put Strife in if they mean the same thing because this Strife means something different you know what that Strife means a desire to put yourself forward you can't have a desire to put yourself for I I I'm going just put this like this I learned this a long time ago the Bible declares a man's gift will make room for itself you ain't never got to put yourself forward let me tell you like this also don't put yourself forward but always be ready to go now I'mma say that again Lord Jesus don't put yourself forward but always be ready to go don't sit there well you know you know I got to be humble I don't want to put myself out there and then somebody call you to come who else am I pointing to get on up here and help us out trying to be humble no be ready not humble not that's not the time to be humble be ready that's it so there Strife is a desire to put oneself forward and and this heresies here is dissensions arising from diversity of opinions and aims so maybe the church going in a particular direction but you don't like the direction that we going can I go a little further I know brother Jack showed us a church but I don't like that church so you're going in a different direction hello we trying to we trying to all be in one mind and one Accord so God can have his way so we got to get rid of seditions and hear it CE right and then he had to set envying all this actually connects right back to some of the other words drunkenness and ring deal with drinking Christians don't drink Christians don't do that praise the Lord and if you do that and expect to go to heaven you're not bottom line but this murderers now we know Christians don't kill people thou shall not kill but is that what Paul is talking about I think Paul talking about something different and you people with these saw blade Tempest you mean and you need to be delivered you people with these saw blade Temple that mean brother brandom had people like this in his church yes sir yes sir that's always can can can I put it this way your name always come up in the middle of something right keep your name out of stuff they say it say a good name is rather to be had than riches keep your name out of stuff avoid it completely you people Des blade temples that's always spouting off in the mouth at somebody can't put up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right like I told you earlier you done told a lie on somebody but ain't made that thing right go tell people you sorry for the lie that you told and if somebody come to you and apologize you ain't got to go around tell everybody you know so and so came to me and apologize to me you ain't got to go around doing all of that that's between you and that person right amen you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right if it's not just you go around and tear down it now look at this you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him that's murder but this what Paul talking about cuz you know I told you Paul was a bookend messenger and then brother Brandon's the other bookend messenger he says you can break his character and kill him a lie can break a man's character and people don't want nothing to do with the man because of your lie now now two people need to overcome that the one that told a lie and the one that was affected by the lie you shouldn't let a lie affect you and your behavior and your reactions towards a person when it's been proven to be a lie you got to drop that you can break his character and kill him kill his influence now I I I should have just took the rest of this off cuz all the pastors we like to read read the rest of it I should have just took that off but the rest of us say speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shot him you know there was 42 children in the Bible that died because Bears attacked them and the reason that the Bears attacked them is cu and now I don't think all these children lived in the same house I don't know how many of them lived in the house but all the houses that they was living in there was a group the parents were in the house talking about Elijah right they were in the house talking about the leader talking about the pastor they they just had all these disagreements with the pastor well you know what they come out one day and and them kids didn't know no better they was products of their environment sometimes your children are acting based on what you saying in your house sir and it's not just the way they acting with a pastor it might just be with another brother or sister some conversations kids don't need to hear you don't need to have you don't need to share everything about what's going on in church leave that between Grown Folk kids don't know how to handle that information now they done took on a spirit amen and now these little kids got a spirit they come out and they see the prophet go up oh Baldhead didn't even call him brother elij Elisha brother is a brother no old ballhead Lord go up old ballhead now where did they hear that at they heard it at home this is what their parents were saying about a prophet who you think he is old Baldhead something I don't know what they saying nowadays who who he think he is who he think he who she think she is she don't know me now and I just be wondering what you going to do who you think you are and see now the devil going to push you into the flesh you're going to sang and get swung on I heard a I heard a brother say somebody gonna lay hands and feet on you but the devil them push you out there because you trying to hold on to that old nature you got to die to that type of stuff we Believers around here speak against your pastor here say something bad about him just might as well shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it what Jesus said i i i there's different ones I can appreciate their Spirits you know people will come to this church for all kind of reasons and and and and typically I will always try to sit down and talk to the person kind of hey what's going on what happened I know you was a part of this church and you know what what happened and I watched people how they respond to questions like that sometimes some people can't wait to tear down another Ministry you got to watch that you know in in in in in in the um in the Scripture it was uh man I can't think of the guy's name but I know David was the king and um Abner Abner wanted to come and be a part he and he come over there he just David we GNA do this but abna didn't want to be corrected and where he was so he come over there to David knowing that he had this Spirit on him and then want to be corrected he didn't want to be corrected over there what what you think G to happen here with David he ain't going want to be be corrected and David just took him in but joab say uhuh uh-uh no no no goab shouldn't have did this but he got ad taken care taken care of people come sometimes in the wrong Spirit you want to watch are you trying to tear down another Ministry are you trying to tear down another Pastor it's okay if if we just differ but we ain't got to tear each other down things happen and we going to differ told something that wasn't right about him well it kills his influence with the people and things like that and your guilty of it what Jesus said murder is killing a person's influence we don't want to do that anymore brother I'm sorry for what I said about you sister I'm sorry for what I said about you I was feeling this way about you and I really shouldn't have been feeling that way but what what was it what was it sometime you don't need to be ask all them questions just accept apology and move on well so and so said this and I believe them now you now see it's just most stuff you don't need to do all of that just I'm sorry I don't want nothing between us I got to move on that's right oh I know this is ain't this ain't nothing but the truth I I appreciate it I I know that when I preach this the first time different ones tell me say yeah and Pastor you was telling the truth because I had I knew I had had to make some things right there and and and if you just feel just feel like the devil might be trying to put something there just call and get that thing out I appreciate saints that have done that I I told you last time I was preaching say this even for me there's there's certain things that I have to intentionally do in order to try to rebuild Bridges praise the Lord because I know the devil tried to tear these things apart but I got to do intentional things to try to rebuild Bridges and it ain't easy when you dying after of yourself there some things you just don't want to do but I just I want I want the I want the passage way to be so clear that the Holy Ghost can just flow right through here and nothing hindering us God knows I want that the gifts in the right place and man speaking in tongues and and and and gifts I mean the gift interpretation going forth I mean just oh we want to see God and now I know some people try to use their gifts to control churches I know that too now people they they dream want to control they dream the dreamers want to control the church let me tell you something before you get started the dream will never control this church what's going to control this church the word of God and if your dream don't line up with that word we ain't announcing it here and and and and people you know praise report prayer request I had a dram don't send your drams through no praise report get the dream to me first Amen Let me let me decide whether that's going to go for it or not then you get mean and hot with the pastor he won't let my dream go cuz if I don't see nothing in it then I got a team of people that I think are gifted to be able to interpret these dreams and I put it before them said y'all see anything in this we don't see nothing it ain't going nowhere true and now I'mma tell you God going to allow that to happen to you to see if you're willing to subject your gift or you want to go somewhere else where they just let you do whatever you want to do true can I say something about spirit and Truth we going to have some order we going to have order Bible [Applause] order if you get if you get mad and want to leave we already know where you at saw blade temper let's keep on going the fruit of the spirit this is what's coming back into the church boy that that that that that old insect took it all out but we we bringing it back amen the fruit of the spirit is love it is Joy God it is peace I got peace with my brother I got peace with my sister I got peace with God it is longsuffering and I remember a preacher saying one time why does God say long long suffering and not shorts suffering but he uses the term longsuffering as Believers as uh Christians with with with the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we have longsuffering and the question is how long is long see you don't have an answer to that that's why you just got to keep bearing with one another until the rapture we bear with each other longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust that mean you got to take your own your own uh your your flesh and crucify it not physically but spiritually you got to get rid of this guy put that guy put that that that other nature in a grave if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit and look at this last one I want to I just want to leave you this let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another that vain Glory That's goes back to that jealousy vain glory is you want your name to be called just like everybody else name but I'm going tell you something you're get into situation where it seem like nobody would call your name but you're not doing it for that the reason I'm doing this is because I want to make I want to make God happy and if nobody ever call my name as long as I hear him say Well done thou good and faithful servant right enter into the joys of the Lord that's why I do what I do because I want to hear him say that amen if you don't never say Pastor I appreciate you Pastor thank you for that sermon yes it cut but Pastor I if you don't ever say that it's okay I'm not doing this for vain Glory I'm going tell you something though when you doing things out of the right heart out of the right motive people will call your name but when you ain't doing it the right way you ain't your name GNA get ain't gonna get called I said don't don't try to force your gift on to somebody just just be patient and wait but always be ready always be ready oh I just love the Lord Church i i i i i this this this this this this this this this this this type of sermon is what's bringing back the brotherly love we can't shout over that we can't jump over that we can't speak in tongues over that no this has got to be manifested in our life we not tying these fruit to the tree and say oh look at this this tree no no no if coming from the roots all the way up and bearing out we don't want it let me um close right here I I got a few more y'all got y'all got five minutes okay he gave me five minutes he gave me five minutes let me let me just let me read this and then uh I'll I'll that'll that'll that'll just finish me up go to the next slide United under one head United under one head listen to the title we're trying to be United under one head that head is Christ that's the way it is with the true Born Again experience of God man says there's no such thing as the baptism Holy Ghost it shows he hasn't got it he trust his Creeds We Trust what God Said not what happened you can't stand neutral you got to be filled with something to survive notice you might be filled with one thing over another you say brother brandom I'm kind of on the fence no you're not the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost received the mark of the beast all that didn't have the Seal of God in their forehead had the mark of the beast you've got one of it now I'd like to test it just a little bit to see where we're standing he says this you might be filled with a bunch of malice you might be filled with a bunch of prejudice so full that you can't even sit and hear one sermon preach you might be filled with a lot of hatred you despise everybody that don't agree with you you might be filled with a lot of nonsense too you might be filled with a lot of Arthur Godfrey's dirty jokes and so much that you think uh too much so much of that you won't go to church on Wednesday night or something you might be filled with Elvis Presley's rock and roll now we know people ain't listening to Elvis Presley nowadays but it's other stuff these young people listen to you might be filled with all of that parents sometimes you need to just take their earbuds out and put it in your well close to your ear just put it close to you try to hear what they listening to what's that you playing what's that you got cuz they they've been they've been they've been uh Spears just coming all in all all into them you don't you got to stop that stuff that's true but you're filled with something and your own life Bears you record of what you're filled with by their fruits you shall know them you're filled with something you might be filled with a bunch of laziness you're just too lazy to do anything about it well you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleansed from all those things you might be filled with a bunch of Creeds you might be filled with a bunch of denominations but God don't want you fill with that God made a place in there to put himself in that's in your heart he made a place in there to put himself in God wants you to be filled with himself a new heart new spirit then his Holy Spirit what takes place when you're filled with with God when you're filled with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with the power you're filled with love with joy with peace with longsuffering with goodness with meekness with gance with worship you're filled with joy Hallelujah and he says David said my cup runneth over and if David had a cup running over before the Holy Ghost come what would it be now you're filled with something and when you're filled with man's ideas if you're filled with church anity if you're filled with Creeds you're only building yourself a Babylon that's got to fall if you if you fill yourself up with a modern world if you fill your up with lust if you fill yourself up with pride if you feel fill yourself up with your denominations you're lost there's only one way to endure and that is to put the original thing that God made that compartment in your heart to be filled with and that was the Holy Ghost he promised according to his word a new heart will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and it shall come to pass afterward after what after you get this new heart new spirit and his Spirit it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and it shall come to pass that who whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord have said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call let's pray father I'm
