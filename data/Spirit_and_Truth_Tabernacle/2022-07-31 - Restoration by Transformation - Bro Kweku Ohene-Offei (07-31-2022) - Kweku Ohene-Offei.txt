be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god has wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in the earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess to jesus christ as lord to the glory of god the father wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do his good pleasure do all things without

glory glory my god thank you jesus amen you can be seated in the presence of the lord um [Music] sometimes you sing songs that are prophetic and that's one i'm i'm walking into the season of prophecy on that one and it's not a sometimes you can look back in your life you see god has done so many great things and there are other times you look forward in your life and you see what god is getting ready to do amen say lord you made a way i i don't know how but you did it you made a way i don't know why but i'm grateful you made a way blessed be the name of the lord and you know i just i thank the lord for the specials amen and i believe amen uh sister tina's son was also prophetic he went went way back and pulling out the closet on us a man today but i'm looking for a miracle and just you got to catch the words as well i expect the impossible hey expecting god to do things that only god can do [Applause] amen adam put it all in his hands and i'm just i'm just expecting it the sky is the limit to what i can have not your bank accounts but the sky is the limit to what you can have in the other words say just believe [Music] and receive it and it's after you believe and receive it that god will perform it [Applause] oh thank you jesus amen you know i was uh we we were just on the expectation um i think some of you all were here a few wednesdays ago and just just i just felt like it was just god just just speaking through our brother steve coming all the way from london england and preaching on the influence of the spoken word and um and as he was just preaching that and just just the way the lord was just lining up things there i i just knew i'm like this is god and he just began to read a a quote about a prophecy that was given years ago amen to a man a doctor that was looking for a building and um and as he was a you know looking for the building he had a specific spot in mind and then the prophet said now forget about that spot because god is giving you this spot over here and uh he said wait a minute it's just almost impossible for me to get that that's locked up by for 25 years ain't no way i can get it he says i don't care what they say about it being locked up god gave it to you and he said uh he called the prophet the next day he said you know i'm i'm freezing and now you got to read between the lines and what he's saying about he frees him because there's a statement that people make amen it's a statement that people make about hell freezing over before something come to pass and that they say i'm freezing right and that's right god will make you eat your words and i love god he overrides your unbelief hey i love god even if you doubt it god god will override your unbelief and still bring it to pass and make you eat your words in the process you ain't dealing with man you're dealing with god [Applause] but he told the process he said i'm freezing he see they had a special meeting last night and they changed everything and the adam bought the building already this morning praise the lord and as he was reading that you know just his whole sermon the foe lepers and you know we had the very next day uh playing for four brothers to go see a piece of property and um and and we were on our way and i say well i think god is all in this and when he got to the quote talk about the the the color of the building and and it's on the corners i told him everything that everything that was in the court was about this building that we were looking at and uh so church we are expecting a miracle every day god will make a way out of nowhere and you know i'm just be honest we called about it we went looked at it on saturday i mean thursday and then uh friday well i think few a few days later we'd be called about it and they said you know y'all came thursday but friday somebody put in a cash offer i said okay [Music] now i i was you beat me to it uh and i'm glad you said it like that sister cicinelli because sister nelly went through the exact same thing sometimes people have to share their testimonies you know what god has already done and i just begin to remind god say god you did it for sister nelly and brother calvin and you the same god today i don't care what they say if you've given it to us then you've given it to us praise god maybe god got something else for somebody else but i know what he got for me and what god has for me it is for me [Applause] so i just refuse to doubt i expect a miracle every day god will make a way out of nowhere hey you don't scare me i don't heard i don't heard about him you can't scare me with that now you you can't scare me with a testimony like that hallelujah glory to god hey so i i i want to say this um i thank god for amen um i don't want to just call him sister brown family i'ma say the family my family my family i'm so happy to see y'all this morning [Applause] amen and um you know it's just it's you know sometimes we we we go through seasons and life and and um you know people may look at this season of what we're going through and you may sometimes uh when when people go through i think i put a quote out there on social media where sometimes when job was going through man just seemed like uh he was just man like like god one with him anymore [Music] all right but no that's a purge in time and during the purging time what god is doing is getting ready to produce more fruit and the other thing that that i found out is that you don't doubt god in the midst of what you're going through because when you doubt god you frustrate god actually you provoke god you make god mad when you doubt him when you're going through something i think this is just part of my testimony part of my story glory to god and and i'm happy i'm gonna be happy to uh to write this chapter come on somebody i'm gonna be happy to write this chapter but i know this chapter gonna turn to another chapter [Applause] and i'm under expectation so we thank god for all things uh as it was said brother and sister robles have returned home and amen we're so happy to have them back in florida the lord sent them a a buyer for the house and brother let's say the man came and bought his house and his car so he had to come here and buy himself a new car but god is good that's that's the god that we serve right amen he does double double oh my blessed be the name of the lord amen well i i know that um uh i promised a man this morning for the morales amen family we wanted to dedicate uh the baby amen uh today uh last sunday we were there and we we thank god for the weekend meetings and everything there uh with brother wesko uh i want you all to remember brother wesker and prayer he he was supposed to have a um like an outpatient type surgery but they were going to keep him in the hospital just overnight he's supposed to do that on thursday but um just something occurred there his body just didn't respond to something that he had taken uh and um so they weren't able to actually have the the surgery on thursday i heard it's been rescheduled until this wednesday we want to remember to keep god's servant in prayer at 80 years old and you know going under surgery it's not not easy you know i mean i'm i'm in my 50s and i'm realizing that just little things that i used to do and i would heal just like that nah it seemed like it's taking forever for healing to manifest itself but but we want to remember amen our precious brother west go in prayer amen uh remember that just put on your calendar as he's going there on wednesday amen for uh the surgery just just remember that god would just go before him and uh and just just just bring him out with with no problems i also got a praise report from um sister irma she had called and wanted prayer for her son he had to go to the hospital but she sent me a text this morning saying they're releasing him from the hospital today so we thank god for watching over him amen you know raphael amen so we thank god for all things amen so as the uh we'll have the morales family prepare to come and then we will dedicate the baby amen on this this morning praise the lord amen [Music] praise the lord amen as um [Music] they are coming just wanted to mention just a a a couple of scriptures here that i want to read uh luke 18 uh verse 15 through 17. amen because it says they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of god it says verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein amen so we don't um that's believe here in baptizing babies we dedicate them back to the lord realize amen that there's a responsibility on the parents to live godly lives amen in front of the children to teach them the ways of god the bible tells us to train up the child in the way that they should go and when they get old they won't depart so there's a responsibility for the parents a man to raise them children the proper way that the children would come to a spot at some point in time they realize they recognize their sinners and they need to be saved by god's grace amen and it's the parents job to make sure they're living a life before them amen to make be be salty so the kids get thirsty amen so and as they raise them up bringing them to the house of the lord and they hear in the word of god we pray god will prick their hearts at some point in time amen and that they would serve the lord with everything they have here at the church we dedicate all babies here brother makes a statement says we bring them and dedicate them any mothers any church any creed any color anything else we dedicate all little children to the lord jesus christ amen and as a little josue is coming you all can come and just stand here brother josue says amanda amen i just want to read two scriptures over him amen uh today man he's really really growing my goodness amen amen praise the lord let me just read these scriptures over josue psalms 127 and 3 says low children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward amen and also jeremiah 1 4 and 5 and i just was thinking a man on the um the the the pregnancy just even before the pregnancy many things that sister amanda went through the lord touched her the lord healed her the lord has blessed her and given her a son and even during the pregnancy just different things that was popping up here and there and just satan just trying to just cast doubt but this morning they stand here victorious amen over everything that satan put in their path glory to god he's already clapping huh amen uh jeremiah 1 verse 4-5 i want to read this over josue elias ramon morales uh then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations amen let us pray [Music] so [Music] let's pray [Music] father we thank you for little josue elias ramon morales god what a blessing uh he has already been to this family so we bring him back to the house of the lord today to dedicate him to you for your service we've read the scripture over him and father we just believe that you have purpose for this child god so much the mother went through before he was born but god we believe a man that as she's you've given her the victory over every circumstance every issue in our body you gave her victory and father this child has come forth we axel god lord that you receive him back as we dedicate him to you lord jesus for your service for your glory that you god would just use them all the days of his life that his parents would be a wonderful example in front of him oh god of how to be a christian how to love the lord how to serve the lord lord we just trust that you had just blessed your home and father may just be a admit continue to unite them in love and made a spirit of peace to sell in the home may you meet every need that this child would have all the days of his life oh god coming into a world where we're so concerned about different diseases i pray that you'll be a hedge of protection around this child that you would keep lord all sickness away that his immune system would develop properly father there'd be no issues in his body everything every doctor's report that is giving lord let it make be negative and may the word of god continue to manifest in his life lord god we give him back to you today lord we dedicate him for your glory it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen amen

i think it's a place called lorraine ohio and uh so i'm supposed to be there brother brother browning amen ministering there so uh we'll do that and it just my heart is a little heavy and going and

be a teacher in this room so they need us to after every service we got to take these chairs and put them up there on the rafter and then we also got to take all of our equipment out and they don't want us to store it here anymore and they want us to take it off site so we're just being squeezed a little bit it's what we call the tinder hand of jehovah and what he wants y'all to know this ain't your sanctuary [Applause] this this this this what we call temporary and all we're doing is just passing through so we we we accept the squeeze so next week i know that a number of us will be away and my heart is heavy because i just don't like to put a lot of weight just on just a few people uh so i'm just asking everyone that can help in whatever way we can please let's just do that um we got to take everything out they want everything god that's what they told us so it's no problem we'll do it and um and then you know in the meantime we expect a miracle every day amen god will make a way

we want to speak on restoration by transformation and i would like to share testimonies of the colombian trip that occurred in june 2022 so if you can give me the slide please that would be great you want to look as few scriptures god bless you brother jack i like when he was giving scriptures of dedicating children unto the lord we want to give some few scriptures about missionary and the ministry of the apostles so we want to take a look at matthew 28 19 to 20 which we are all convicted with when the lord said that go ye into the go there go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lu i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen act chapter 1 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy spirit after that the holy ghost is come upon you and it shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all judea in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth amen the church was inaugurated in jerusalem israel and the church that was the east this is a type of eternity and outermost part of the earth is the earth amen wherever sons and daughters of god are found the gospel will reach them amen that's why we are here because somebody spoke the gospel to us and brought us in and it's our duty eternal duty to speak the gospel to those who are not in yet amen act chapter 13 verse 2 and 3. and that was about poland bana and saul as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work where unto have called them and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they send them away to pray the gospel amen and so i would like to go through a watercard in colombia just about a month ago so let's go to i'll have to cut this shirt because i've got someone to preach as well amen and another testimony of how the missionary all began uh in south latin america south and central america so let's go to the first picture the first picture is brothers that brother brother uh gabriel i think some of you know him he has a our food pantry they call it a our community table and in spanish they call it orange orange can be introduced prayers changes all things and these we are stationary in this they have to go and chase them and give them their food majority of them come to downtown but some of them they have to go to even their workplaces on the street corners traffic light homes and give them food but one thing that i love about those people is that their heart is so open for the word of the lord they don't just go for the food you don't just they give their food they want to hear the word of the lord and as long as you want to tell them they are ready to listen so brother gabriel a witness and he's got 35 people out of their food pantry out of their food pantry so he's got a special service for them and uh because they are new people they are newbies so monday i think it's got about three or four days that he ministers to them in their homes they gather and then teach them and the lord is doing wonderful things in the armies and i'll share some peculiar testimonies with you let's go to the next slide this is uh people that work in recycling plants they're about together they're about 20. so we go there and give them their food and then we share just before you get there they're already in the front of the door waiting for the word of the lord they hear the word and it doesn't matter they were working they hear the word as long as we are preaching they will hear the word and the manager is in tune with it it's just wonderful so that was a recycling plan people some of them are immigrant from venezuela who migrated to colombia and some some are colombians let's go to the fed the next slide yeah the same people so we took a picture with them let's go to the next one i met this young man go to the next slide and yes this uh two young men i met this one this is david he's about 18 years old when i saw him go back to the previous slide his countenance looked very sad and i discerned that there was something not going on well with him so i greeted him and asked him for if you like some food and he said he doesn't need food and i said can we pray for you he says so we pray for for him and right after the prayers he was smiling from the inside out prayers changed everything i didn't ask him what was going on but i know things were things were not going on with him he's an immigrant a young man he's learning a trade he's from venezuela but because of economic crisis political crisis he has to move to another country probably where his parents are not there just 18 years old and he's starting life on his own you never know how much you bless until you see some of those situations amen let's go to the next slide please yes that's uh david these are the people in downtown i think that day we had about a saturdays we had about 150 people so we to begin with we went to we came to downtown and they were waiting for us and i said wow early morning they were waiting to get their food and hear the word of the lord and be prayed for and these are the street people and i will tell you more so we went to distribute food to people in their homes traffic lights and when we came about 150 people i said brother do we have food for them i mean i don't want us to people come and wait and you don't have separate that we have more than food for about 400 people so they are good that's okay glory hallelujah and all of them want praise they want to be prayed for i hadn't prayed like that after the prayers i felt like a paper i was feeling very light and by the gibberish the testimonies of that is so surprising it rains but it never rained when we are having a community table he gave that testimony before we left uh for the food pantry and right after we left we pray for them some of them are in colombia we have people who are color people just like us a lot of them i mean indigenous people and they come in they want to hear the word and you pray for them so right give us a brother there are more more people to pray for so cut is shorter let's move on so you pray and keep on and they want to hear the word and they want to hear and what i was doing was that i took their numbers those who have got whatsapp i took their numbers and gave it to brother gabriel i said you don't catch a fish and throw the fish back into the river you catch it and eat a fish so we don't want to just give them food and pray for them and let it be a one-day wonder we want to track them and see what the lord has for them eternally amen let's move to the next slide please yes this has the same place downtown this is i want to share testimony about these two little girls luciana 11 year old and a little sister mariana nine years old and this before the appearance but gabriel's wife this is brother camilo and his wife go to the next slide i think i have the picture of the wife yes this is the myra then go back now this people were strict people in colombia one of the commonest issue is drugs children young elderly people drug is common i was in mexico one time and i didn't i didn't know spanish so the brother that went with me and his wife were going to walmart to buy he wanted to buy something for his dad so they were in the ken i was around the vehicle outside and this guy came on a bicycle and he said droga and i didn't understand i said maybe he's talking about truck maybe he thinks i need a cab a taxi so but david was laughing said do you understand what he meant said no he said you want you want you to know do you want cocaine if you want to buy cocaine he's got something for you i said wow that's amazing so cocaine is not they don't arrest nobody for possessing cocaine the police don't waste that time chasing people cocaine is everywhere it's not a it's not it's common even more common than than cigarette it's everywhere cocaine is nothing kids they're dealing cocaine so one of the problems is drugs people are addicted so people are on the streets and god knows his children regardless of where they are the lord can allow the enemy to create a contrast take them to the deepest of hell put whatever spread drugs prostitution god will bring them back because he's the one who created lucifer just to create those contrasts so this brother and his wife uh separated and the brother went this way and the wife and the kids went another way but these two little girls lucy um luciana 11 year old girl took upon herself to fast the whole day with a younger sister so they fasted prayed without food with our water and praying their lord bring our father and our mother together 11 year old and 9 years who told you god cannot use children amen and they prayed and the lord gave those kids the desires of their heart their father came back and then when he came back brother gabriel met them on the streets and give the word to them they receive the word they've got baptized in fact they rededicate their marriage just a couple of weeks ago and luciana wanted to be baptized and a little girl no they all that all that want to be baptized so two girls pray stood in the gap and the lord restored their parents back amen [Applause] glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide yes that is brother and those brothers and this is a service on the sunday and these people are all the people that they got from the streets and they do have home services and we had a prayer that was not a sunday that was the monday we had a prayer sorry questions and answers and i was just marveling how little kids could ask spiritual questions it was just amazing let's go to the next slide please this is brother gabriel his wife sister carolina and his father we call him a grandpa archangel he said he's archangel gabriel you know i'll share his testimony this is 88 birthday and the first time i went that was the same of this the last december his father is a staunch catholic and he's a jewish white if you know the jesuit is one of the highest order of the catholic they are more like the freemasons so gabriel said when i received a message my dad said i have two sons and one of the worst thing that happened to me is one of my children has become my son has become a christian and we mostly a minister so his father has got nothing to do with the gospel but when i went last time he speaks english he speaks german he's lived in the u.s and germany before so we chat and one thing i realized that some time many people when you're witnessing don't just go straight to the gospel be a human being find common grounds things that you relate to as human beings and then the pillar of fire will move away for you so when jesus christ met the lady at the same area on the other well he didn't just talk about the gospel he didn't first talk about the gospel he said give me water you know that's an easy thing to do give me water because you're in the world and through that he was descending the holy ghost was paving away and hoping the lady began to talk and as they were talking the lord the peel of fire open the door where jesus christ could channel in and give the gospel so be a human face don't just bombard people with repent the coming of the lord is here change your life repent no sometimes it doesn't work you push them away just be a human being greet them talk to them and you'll find a common grounds and it works well even in interview when you go for interviewing don't be nervous just look at common grounds sometimes people have talked to the people before you when they've talked to people they are bored so they don't want to hear about you or sometimes your long resume and stuff like that look at something that you find in common maybe you've lived in certain places before oh i used to live in new york really i was in new york i'm an athlete i run you run too amazing it's no longer interviewing now you take control over the interview so sometime what i do is that you talk and open a channel open it away and they go there and now you detect the interview they don't interview you anymore they just you know what we want you here so so in giving the gospel be a human first and then the lord will pave the way don't go on the emotion and just bombard people with repent repent repent sometime it doesn't work sometime it works sometimes it doesn't let's go to the next um oh so back to you by the gabriel's father sorry see right there when i went last time so he spoke a new only and only one word in germany good morgan which is good morning that's all i know so we talked german we talk english and we chat and uh but gabriel was in the room he translated the message from english to spanish so he's working in i was talking to his dad we were chatting and i asked him can i pray for you he said sure we prayed and then he was giving double and triple a mean amen amen i mean i mean glory are yours and but the gibberish said brother quick what did you do to my dad i said this one is a jesuit he doesn't like nothing for the gospel he doesn't hear it so this time again we went and give him the word we chat on the gospel pray for him but the greatest brother i think if you if you stay there for too long my dad is going to get converted and as i said we believe that so that was his father the lord loves you our loved ones the lord do not let you pray for somebody to be converted preach and then your loved ones will go to the origin of the lost no the lord before you you thought about praying for your loved ones he already thought about them before he's just meandering through you and doing the works of salvation amen let's go to the next place yes this is another city from fusagasu that's where by the gabriel is we went to this place is called santa mal santa marta which which means saint martha and that is a dominant colored people so this is brother franklin but a gabriel and a new believer brother lewis we went to the hotel we got around 12 midnight and we we we sat at a hotel lobby and fellowship for three and a half hours it was just the lord in the missing speaking and doing things and testimony the brothers were crying and and give us we need to go and sleep we've got to start the word of the lord tomorrow and just restart another topic and just talking about the lord so 3am and i remember i went to bed around 5 a.m got up around 9. just keep going so it was wonderful and this place they don't really have a message church and so this brother has got a congregation brother franklin in his house and we're telling that brother i think it's high time you have to make it a full-blown church because the lord is using you let's go to the next slide this is santa marta beach so you may ask preacher man what were you doing at the beach well what's your mission at the beach all right i'll tell you hold your breath glory hallelujah so the brothers were telling us that they have nice around so they want to take us there so okay that works you know after preaching we need to just you know release tension and get all the stress out you know be human being so we went but the lord had a greater purpose than what we were thinking so we went and i was exhausted tiredness was wasn't it i just like want to lay down and sleep that was i was surrounded i was exhausted so we were there and you know and me and brother gabriel they put us there and they went back and then we're there walking around and by the gabriel we found two ladies they were talking giving testimony and we went to sit down around them and then they were talking about the gabriel listen and they were listening and i was actually sitting on the floor just leaning against the street because i was so tired so we were listening to them and i was not even paying too much attention and i the sister was giving some testimony very powerful testimony to her friend and she had a disabled son so we're talking and we're chipping in their conversation and started talking to them and we prayed with them and they received the word of the lord i to their numbers i connect them with but gabriel in fact i started there about three months ago about prayers with the hispanic people in some of them from mexico colombia bolivia ecuador paraguay in different countries and they have joined in and i've sent a church book word document form to them brother gabriel i'm in connected with them and invite them for their services in fact they believe their word and the lord is working in them so we are praying that the brother will set a check that those two sisters can go to church actually so so let's let's say the lord will put you a place that you didn't want to go the lord let the prophet took a seek a cigarette is a cigarette right right just to have a same one uh thank thinking mass falter right let's go to the next slide yeah so i'm going to give you a little prelude before this uh brother quentin junior where you are god bless my brother when sister vegeta invited us invited us to a home but a quentin junior asked about a quick i mean what makes you go to colombia and these places is it is it the lord call you to do or you just love to go there and say brother you are taking my sermon i'm gonna i'm to call on you to preach if i tell you why god bless you by the quentin junior so i was in there let me go back to the uh the story i was working in walgreen 2009 and then there were a lot of puerto rican elderly ladies there they speak perfect english but then when they come to pick their prescription they they ask me can i speak to somebody who speaks spanish and most of my hispanic co-workers used to work in the morning at a pharmacy and they go to their second job so in the afternoon when they come to pick their prescription there was nobody there to translate spanish and then so i was i have to call my manager and call them sometimes it takes like five minutes so i decided to know what i need to learn some spanish so i asked but i will say the first spanish i learned was su medicina esta estella listed manana your education will be ready tomorrow so so i pick one and then i it made my job a little easy so i decided you know what i think i have to go further to get a book and learn so i went to barnes and noble and bought me this book five minutes in spanish and so i bought this book with a cd and i came out of the the bookshop and i was just flipping through the books and a voice a strong voice came you will be dealing with hispanic people someday i said well lord if it's you it will happen if it's not you it's just a voice so i just continue my life and then i landed in san antonio texas 2010 that is when the whole thing began to unravel a lot san antonio is about 65 percent hispanics mexican because they share they are closely about el paso and ego pass and warehouse and in nuevo laredo laurel texas they are bordered to mexico in fact most of the lands are mexican land yes body from mexico so there was a time the lord put upon my heart to pray what i was praying about and why i was praying brother smiley i didn't know a thing why i was praying it was about a span of about two months all i do was go to comanche park after work even sundays after first service we used to have two services in between the first and second service i go to the park and go and pray and pray and pray it's all of my heart why i didn't know i'll just pray so right after that a brother approached me one time said brother i feel it in my heart to invite you to mexico to preach i said well let's pray and if it's the will of the lord so we prayed and i go with her brother to the same word to pray command checkpoint comanche is a word from the old indians means enemy go to the enemy grounds and possess your inheritance so i went to the brother and he goes to one side and i go to one side we pray whoever finish first we have a trail come and wait for me here so we prayed and now the lord put upon my heart so strongly to go so my first trip we went to a mexico and before then i remember one of the prayers the lord told me that he was going to do something supernatural in mexico my very first trip so i remember my co-worker said a friend never we couldn't go out there i was born in mexico but i will never even get to the border let alone going to mexico because it's very bad out there some of my co-workers were crying even some believers say brother your color and the car you are going with the cartels that's what they want i said well if the lord put something on your head it's a different story amen not that i was a brave person but when the lord imbibed something in your heart it's just you can't help it it's not you it's the lord so the first trip i went let's go to the next scripture please the first trip i went i met this elderly man is called pastor pedro he's going to be with the lord i think he was 85 but when i met him 2011 he was 77 and i was my house in ghana number is 877 and when i was going one brother gave me an offering he went to he got married to a mexican and he went to minister in a they called san luis potosi they gave him an offer of 77 pesos said brother i'm not going to use this money in the u.s so go and want to go give it to the minister so i had 77 pesos with me pastor pedro was 77 and i was my house in ghana was 877 so when i went the pastor said i think it was friday said brother you're not going to preach tonight we're going to share testimonies so all the almost all the church came to his house and said brother i think a couple so many years ago i told the law that i wanted him to send one of my colleague brothers from us forever to come in i mean visit me but i'm a poor man i'll never be able to i don't speak english and i'll never be able to go to us to see my colored brothers or to africa but i want a lot to send me a minister before i leave this earth he said i prayed for many years i think brother joseph brahma and billie paul abraham went there they gave him contact to many ministers said brother i contacted them and never went nobody visited but two weeks before you came he goes to mountains to pray those plain monterey they call the city of mountains and ramos arrested just closed there and he said i go to the mountains to pray and it's a very he was a very spiritual man the lord showed him vision said i saw you exactly two weeks ago your face and everything the lord revealed you to me i knew you two weeks before you came here and you are the uh the answer to my question and he shared with me a lot of things so we prayed for that we did prayer and we ministered i think his wife had a broken arm we prayed for him just the evening she was sitting at the back praising the lord so i prayed sorry i ministered and then me and brother david this is his son-in-law it's called juan flores and then i we came back to us about a month and a half one brother he's called he's a voice of god representative called francisco uh francisco vera montes he came to become a very good friend of mine so he came to san antonio and said brother i want to show you something when you came to ramos a respite to preach one brother ricardo took a picture with his cell phone and this is what was on the surface go to the next slide please is that this is what appeared on the cell phone a fire coming from your mouth and a light on your chest and i could remember that the lord showed me that in san antonio before i went so the lord is here with us amen the same god that was with our our eldest of old the prophet the women of god william abraham paul hannah sarah mary the same pill of fire is in you amen glory hallelujah and i've seen the simple of fire in me one night in san antonio in a dream a demon was coming to attack me at a very high velocity and before i could wake up and pray i saw a roundish ball of fire coming out of my chest going to father spirit i didn't have to wake up i didn't pray i didn't call jesus and that was it and i've seen in ghana where i was born i used to pray we used to go to hospital when i was in cali to go to the hospital pray for the sick and one night i designed a spirit on a lady and i caught and spread out and the lord told me that you're gonna have an attack so i knew i went back to my campus and a spirit came speaking in in a language clear english i am going to kill you and i was fast asleep and i saw another being coming from me at an angle of 45 degrees saying how can i die and desperate that being the true you amen you might not see physically with this eyes but there's a being in you and that being is the lord jesus christ he's the captain of who's that fight your battle amen do you know some people die in their sleep and you never know they knew that battle they went through desperate the demons attacked people in the night demons even attacked children sometimes children will cry and cry and nothing could pacify them food mother's breast smoke nothing it's a spiritual attack and you have to pray for the child so the devil comes in different forms to attack that is his duty to to steal your joy to steal what we plant to steal your virtues to steal your peace and to destroy and to kill you but thank god jesus christ came to give what life eternal and give it an abundance amen glory hallelujah so now let's go to i think i made some okay let's go to the next one yes now let's i want to pick the main salmon and i trust you just round it we won't keep it long amen we want to we're speaking on restoration by transformation and want to start with dimensional analysis i think some of you might be engineers and computer scientists are you going to teach is it in science in calculus no the natura is a top of the spiritual amen we want to analyze the dimension we want to have a basis of restoration all right if you want to restore something then there's something sure what you want to research you have been in a position where it's not there at this time so before we could be restored we have to find out where we were before and what this launch is to our current position and how can we be restored amen so let's look at quickly i analyze the dimension the realms that we are living in what is the dimension the physical atmosphere that we see here is a dimension let's go back to the slide oh sorry the physical atmosphere is the space that we live in the universe you can travel go beyond the earth go to moon go to the stars they are universe beyond what you can imagine so that is the first dimension we call it a space universe is the dimension of occupancy place of existence so the volume that we occupy is the first dimension because the lord wants to teach us from break things down when you go to medical school they do dissection they dissect even human beings dissect animals now before they started the guinea pig it was a whole guinea pig one but for you to study and to know the intricacies of the anatomy of of the of the guinea pig they have to break it down amen god bless you you are right there in the channel the frequency break it down to learn it but when you when you finish you're not going to treat them in isolation you're going to treat a human being and i remember where i work in uh wellington hospital the doctors tell the junior doctors that when you go to the patient is that some of you are trained in a computer age so you don't admit you don't use your mind look at the patient it's going to give you a clue don't just look at numbers and his potassium and numbers look at the whole patients look at how he looks like you're gonna see a picture of what is going on and then you start from there don't look at not don't use computer don't be a computer doctor so now you want to be a reductase and see what the problem came in so the first dimension is peace second dimension is what the matter the earth the terrestrial that we live in whatever you can touch your human body the building the concrete is air gas is solid they are all part of the second dimension the third dimension is time as we know now we have two types of time we have eternal manifestation of god and then we have uh tempera attributes be manifested in time so time is what we are living in now we are preaching so we are in eterna time now eternal manifestation somebody's on drugs somebody's fighting somebody's chasing somebody's again what's going on isn't a temper attribute he's also in time but not an eternal attribute attribute he's living in temporary attributes then the fourth dimension is communication or science what the ether was the computers that we use the broadband the internet the radio worldwide whatever web and what have you they are all part of the fourth dimension it's a dimension where the the lord uses it the devil uses it human beings uses it amen michael jackson used microphone to project what was in him ever specially used microphone to project what is him but a jagdaff uses microphone to project a christ in him but using microphone to project what is in him so is a christ in you that makes a difference amen we use science we use science it's all over people are listening in online is true science is the fourth dimension but we are using it for eternal manifestation eternal benefit amen now let's look at the dimension of contrast the fifth dimension that is where it all began amen that is satan we can call it satan lucifer dimension of contrast is the fountain of all temporary thoughts it's death it's hell demons where the origin of the laws agony suffering disease was please cancer was just name it it's just dimension of evil torment unbelief doubt is death grief i mean you can go on and describe it and that is this dimension don't live in isolation they live in human beings and the the the other diamond let's go on the sixth dimension is the celestial dimension it's a dimension of peace it's heaven it's where the saints live is the logos is the theophany is the angels where the origin where the angels are is the origin of the redeemed is where you are now sins of god is the pill of fire is the pillar of light is the lake of fire the look of fire is just the holy ghost one is consuming the devil we call the lake of fire what else can consume the devil is the lord himself is the same holy ghost that consumed the devil in me and consumed the devil in you that is destroying the enemy satan that he will never exist no more amen then the seventh dimension is elohim we say god himself christ with his eternal attribute in him they thought their mind realm their thought ram before he began to even express their such dimension it was a thought and the thought of god is not like my thought and your thought the thought of god is real that's why when job was going through the trials he was going through amnesia and the lord tried to remind him job where were you when the sons and daughters of god sunk in glory so before you came to his mother's room god god blessed were the jack for your scriptures jeremiah before i formed you i know you baby josue before you were formed the almighty knew you and ordained you to be a prophet to be a preacher amen before you were born before even you knew what is causing you existed you didn't exist with gray hairs no you didn't exist as a baby but you resisted between like age of 18 to 22. young beautiful young men beautiful young lady your teeth white as crystal your eyes shining like the sun and that was a brilliancy of christ but now for us to experience redemption they needed to be this con the fifth dimension to bring their contrast amen the lord manifested this attribute okay i have another name finished the eighth dimension say where did you get it from eight dimension that is a good old pentecostal music songs of worship where god lives glory hallelujah that is the a dimension glory to the lord god bless you the singers that those who bring the instrument of joy remember they saw when someone was going through problems once attacking him david will sink and you take him back to the eight dimension where god is amen maybe let me read the quotes let's go to the next slide read the quotes to pacify maybe some offense will think brother are you adding to the word no is writing the word amen so let's read the message expectation before i go on i'm going to speak the first part let's go to the uh paragraph 12. so we have to go we have to give the pentecostal people credit for one good thing many of them there's one good thing is those real good old-fashioned songs it just takes you out somewhere in fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth dimensions somewhere wherever it is out where god lives amen and this morning we went to the eight dimension uh brother brother capes and sister sister tina and the singers and the instrumentalists you two guessed those dimension amen and eight dimension is nothing but eternity in us eternity in manifestation glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so let's go back our lord is marvelous glory to the lord so back to go back to uh back to the dimension now the lord had his eternal attribute in him want to just within two or five minutes find out where we were before and how we ended here how sin came in and why sin came in before the foundation of the world we were in the mind of god the man of god is not a human mind the mind of god is real in other words it's a real existence of real human beings but not human beings with with a blood system but human beings with the holy ghost amen when you live here you're going to still be a human being you're not going to be an angels with wings no you're still going to maintain your human form your human shape your nose your eyes you're not going to have gray hairs no you're not going to be a baby you're going to be like 18 years to 20 years old but that's that was what you were before the foundation of the world but without an earthly experience you didn't know what sin was no sickness child having a fever and headache he never existed so we needed to come to earth to manifest those temper eternal attributes and for us to manifest those eternal attribute the lord had to bring a contrast and that contrast was lucifer he was created as one of the angels and he had all the power and the glory of the lord but in him was coded all the tempera thought of the lord in him was to bring forth sin remember sin is what srn satan in your nature in him was we're supposed to come with the spoken word of the lord come just like jesus come like adam be born by the word as people have been born this morning but now for the contrast contrasting satan came in to bring birth through what sex scx satan if cross that is what satan introduced to the human race and the lord permitted it that's what is called the permissive will of god god permitted for 46 000 7 000 years but is so not eternal purpose of god that's why human beings are born a certain time and we die a certain time because it's still the temperature of god it's not a tenor but then before the himala midakuda was created there was a human being who cannot die who couldn't die and he's the one that we are being restored to right now amen they say being in you there's a supernatural being in you beside your earthly realm that is the true you and that is where the lord wants us to operate from many times we will pray from the human spirit the human realm when there's a situation we quickly look at the situation we're going to cry like jack said that we're going to doubt the lord but the lord overrides our own belief and doubts and he goes forward to what manifests what he's ordained to manifest amen because you know the fragility of your human frame that you're a human being amen so you override our own beliefs and our doubts and our thoughts and our limitations and he goes on to manifest his word elaborate i said we eat our weight back amen the lord will let you know that he's god and he has you in his hands nothing can take you from his hands amen and you cannot even take yourself out of the hands of the lord it doesn't matter how far you can go your name is written in the palms of his hands [Applause] it doesn't matter how far the word will take you to the code the genetic code eternal code is in you you can go sing so low to the deepest of hell there you hear the voice of god sounding amen glory hallelujah to the lord so a child of god is a child of god so the contrast came in to bring the loss we came into sin and quickly the law became a redeemer in fact before the lord descended adam begin to exhibit the attribute of redemption he tried to clothe himself and his wife with what with fig leaves that was a type of christ clothing you an eye with the holy ghost baptism amen he did in the natural which couldn't do it your human mind cannot do it but you need the holy ghost baptism jesus preaches someone ye must be born again the new breath takes away delete the fifth dimension out of your frame and i begin to operate all the dimensions are part of you but this one is not the eternal part of you we got we inherited that because we were born through sex because we came through the civilization of satan but god for knew you before the foundation of the world we came through amnesia where we forgot our identity but the pillar of fire didn't forget you and the right time at appointed time he calls you by by your name amen and brings you back to who you are glory hallelujah to the lord the lord he is good when adam and his wife were lost and they couldn't save themselves the lord himself came killed the lamp to type christ jesus because the lord has got only one mind that is christ jesus eternity has got only one mind them that are in christ nothing can separate them from those that are in christ so he doesn't look at your condition that you are in when the lord met gideon and gideon was looking at circumstances how the media knights have overcome them and they plant their corn and wheat and they have to go in the night and with the sacks and go and harvest the corn per adventure they will encounter the midianites and the malachites and then here is gideon talking to the lord himself and he came as a human being and said lord we heard about your promises what you did in the past you did wonders in egypt but lord you have sowed us into the hand of the egyptians sorry in the hand of the midianites because of because of our sin and the lord said the almighty man of valor he didn't look at the mighty man of allah he looked like a defeated person but the lord was not looking at the circumstance of gideon he was looking at what is in gideon amen on the outside you might be as wretched as richard can be you might be as lost as lost can be but the lord is looking at the seed and the poor water and sunshine of the seed and the seed will come out of you and overtake the outward circumstances glory hallelujah to the lord so the lord was preaching to gideon the inner man gideon remember there was a time that when the law started before before man came to earth the lord had the attribute of worship in fact before the man came to earth the angels were worshipping him so that attribute was manifested but there was another attribute of redemption that was not manifested yet and the law said that who will go and open the redemption story and adam and eve says adam said lord here we are send us and they step in earth step insisting element put flesh around them and begin to manifest and we know how their sin came in their blast system and now quickly the lord began the redemption story amen there's nothing out of kitten before the lord there's nothing i can overtake the lord that the lord doesn't know that happened to you is this sickness the lord can heal it amen is it cancer yes it will be a dread to the doctors but the pill of fire can consume that crap that demon out of your life whatever sickness is in you whatever plague and woe the lord jesus christ can set you free right now only believe all things are possible just give it all to the lord amen believe in him and receive your healing don't look at your circumstance the lord doesn't see you as a sinner he's you as his daughter and as a son and when you yield yourself to him he takes away the sin out of your life amen things that you cannot do he will do it for you amen habits that you cannot overcome he overcome them for you it doesn't matter the lord jesus christ will do it for you amen glory hallelujah only believe all things are possible glory hallelujah to the lord [Applause] and that was happening in time of gideon they planted their corn that was a type of what is happening now you give birth to your child you plant the word of the lord in your children and they go to school and they uproot everything from them and they teach them to be a woman should marry a woman a man should marry a woman they teach them all kind of evil they teach them how to have sex how to test their sexuality and all kind of evil and that was what was happening in time of time of gideon but the lord jesus christ came because gideon and the sons of children of israel were were ordained to be god's children god came and defeated the amalekite and the jebusite and all the other sin it doesn't matter the demons yes we know millions of demons are on the earth and those demons are living in people trying to captivate young old babies whoever they can captivate but there's a pill of fire that is welling around glory hallelujah like a magnet that is absorbing catching his children even whilst their bodies are not falling asleep in other words before you die not when you are dead in the grief side but when you are living in your sisting element the lord is calling you speaking to your heart my daughter my son where are thou this is not where you were before the foundation of the world you to me son and daughter give your holy note to my heart to me and i'll change your heart amen and we know when gideon if you read uh judges chapter six gideon was a defeated person but judges seven gideon was fully restored and argued wasn't speaking like a defeated person anymore he wasn't look talking to circumstance but he was talking to the people that i'm going to blow trumpet and you blow after me and tell see that the sword of the lord and the sword of gideon why they saw that the lord gideon has realized christ in him juva god is his portion so there's the jehovah who was distanced from him now has become married to him he's become mr jehovah and you are message jesus christ by the holy ghost baptism do you know what is the most important thing in your life is the new breath that's why the enemy will do everything to keep you away from it you occupy you with the things of the world the devil doesn't care if you come to church it doesn't care if we're a preacher it doesn't care if we're a pastor it doesn't care if we're a prophet if we're not born again he so overcome you he can use you and that's why we have to teach the children you must be born again don't stop baptizing the name of the lord jesus christ is good and dandy but that will not do their job what to do the job is the new breath and what is the new breath is deleting the third dimension the consuming fire of god consume the nature of satan in you consume the devil literally out of you supernaturally and then they'll see that is a new pillow fire jesus christ taken over your flesh and you can see that the life that i live is no longer but that's smiley it's no longer about a jack it's no longer about a cuicu it's no longer sterica it's no longer starting now this is the cat but it is jesus christ living in you bringing his life out of me glory hallelujah and jesus christ is not limited he can raise the dead amen i've seen him raise the dead once in mexico in my own little ministry the lord is not there's nothing he can do amen i saw 18 year old boy preach in the morning i didn't have a translator so i said the pastor has so much he said brother preach and we can ask the discipline because the lord can let you you preach in english we can hear in spanish but his faith his faith was way high here and my faith was now here so i said okay let brother israel preach the young brother preached and after that the pastor's mother and father invited us to their home to give us uh we're eating dinner or lunch or something and the brother just fell see what the devil can do with food in my mouth i said what's going on here the person saw what was going on in this sea so i went to just get the food out of my mouth in the sink and the brother we started praying for the brother he called the family about 15 sisters they came praying for 15 minutes he was gone the sisters stopped praying and they were crying like so bitter like never seen people crying like that before and they were sitting there they they were not even praying anymore and their brother's head was on my lap and the pastor's mother the pastor was trying to massage his chest to get some oxygen and blood into his brain and the process mother was shocking him with tao israel israel no response and i was thinking lord if it is time to go he said son of god is preaching he's a young minister he's preaching simon but if it's not it's time to go i call it spread back into him and right away the brother open his eyes and begin to look here looking at the sisters crying and mourning and he came back and we told him what what went on he didn't know what went on [Applause] the lord has given that power in you all that we need to realize it the devil is just a scared crew he's defeated but when we know our position that you are a daughter of jesus christ you are jesus christ in flesh you are message jesus christ amen and when you speak your word is not your word it's your husband speaking amen when sister naomi speaks is brother solomon speaking when's his terrica speech but brother jack speaking and that is the word amen and when you speak the word your husband the enforcer will enforce the word amen like esther and king are even an earthly king he wasn't a believer but the lord put upon his heart to love his people and he said esther why are you sad what is you even half of the kingdom i'll give it to you and he granted him the sword of kin ahesaros the lord is this our giving you he's already given it to you the sword of the lord and put your name there and brother solomon amen the sort of the lord and sister jemima the son of the lord and brother robles they saw that the lord and brother quentin amen and go in that might my brother my sister nothing can stand before you because you don't fight by your strength but it's he that is in you he's the one doing the fight glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord just like i gave a testimony in my rotation wellington were doing rounds and a lady about 70 something to 80 years old was declared hopeless stage 4 cancer in the in the lungs and something to me told me that no she's not her place so that the team went to the next room we were standing in front of the door and she was sleeping looking at the wall facing the wall i see there was a divine appointment when they left i pulled off my mask and she looked at me and i couldn't i didn't speak a word but he that is in me amen he that is in you i transferred the healing i transferred the power of the almighty me to the lady and she smiled we didn't have to speak i didn't have to see a word but there was a frequency that the lord channels said in that frequency the frequency of the holy ghost where all things are possible whereby they thought amen just think about it and believe it and speak it and it will be done amen glory hallelujah to the kingdom of kings blessed be the name of the lord that is the thought there's a coming of time as brother jack was in the squeeze even here we are being squeezed isn't it the squeeze is helping us we already have the hair returns if you are too comfortable you're going to stay here forever but when we get uncomfortable we already have our church building we have the school we have whatever we need the lord gave it to us before the foundation of the world [Applause] amen and when the lord is about to do something he created condition uncomfortable condition thank you brother uncomfortable condition for you to go into your inheritance amen remember israel they were scattered all over the world but their homeland was jerusalem naturally speaking and the lord wanted them to return to their homeland what did the lord do brought out of hitler brought a stalin brought a is what the other one are for india and all those detectives and they killed slaughtered israel and then they were forced to go back to their homeland because jews like dinero money so what will bring them it has to take something to put them back to where they belong to amen as long as they see their money they will stay with money go to wall street but the lord wanted them to take to their homeland so the lord creates uncomfortable situation in your family that there's something in you that you have not exercised there's a virtue in you that you have not put to practice just like you don't gideon never knew he was a judge he didn't know anything like being a judge he only needed trying to be a family man trying to provide for his family but it was more than just providing for his family he needed to provide for the whole israel and the lord met him at a crossroad where things were tight where he has to go in the night and when harvest the corn that he planted himself in his own land go and steal his own crops and bring it back home and feed his family and when it gets tight that is when he that is in you comes to this comes comes on display amen the holy ghost is in you amen is there all the time but then when the situation arise then the holy ghost will manifest the attributes for that day glory hallelujah let's go to the next um well let's go to the next thank you that is um fat abraham the father of faith he was restored he was abraham an adult worshipper in one of the babylonian countries but he didn't know anything about god he knew his father's idols he didn't know he was a prophet but the lord ordained him like jeremiah to be a prophet unto the nations and when the time come the lord said abraham leave your kindred and go to the land of our should not even tell him where he was going to and sometimes the lord let you let us walk by faith we may not have all the money for the building you may not have all the money that you need but you go by faith amen you speak into creation amen who created the purpose that was used to make money the trees that was used to make the dead president the dollars the lord created their trees so who created the gold the coins the lord created the metals so the lord can give you money amen if he has to renee from heaven he can do it if he has to test somebody to give it you can do it he can give you exactly what you need he can give you more than what you need and abram said that when you ask the lord something he gives you always gives you more than what you ask for [Applause] because when we measure our height we measure only our hard i'm 5 8 5 11 6 foot but the lord is looking something beyond that amen you look at your finance what you have in your bank to make budget but the law doesn't look at your bank statement there's a bank statement in heaven that doesn't run dry it's like just like the ocean it's just like a little fishy drinking from the ocean it's not it's infinite smile it's not even you can't even measure you have taken nothing out of the out of the out of there out of the ocean if the lord gives you one billion it's nothing bank of heaven is the bank of heaven amen if the lord gives you ten houses it's nothing the law doesn't like the brother preacher doesn't is his company doesn't go bankrupt it's always this abundance for us and we have to ask big ask more than your job before amen if you're a son of god and you have said the lord like abraham if you are a daughter of god and you have given your life to the lord like sarah then ask for not only celestial blessing but ask for treasure blessing amen because they have all of them are for you the lord gave our father abraham he came himself when abraham you know what should always show forgiveness and she'll laugh one of the secret to god blessing is forgive it doesn't matter how somebody has hurt you your family god can let somebody closest to you hate you so bad your children your parents your pastor your minister the lord can let it happen to test what is in you are you going to leave a chat because because i step on you on your toes or by just step on your toes no you have to show forgiveness amen and when you show forgiveness that is when the big blessings come to you the lord abraham forgive his nephew what's the name lot because his blessing lord took his blessing but when lord was in trouble abraham wasn't the military man his seventh were not trained soldiers but he picked sword i don't know whatever sword that they picked but he went in the strength of elohim and went to deliver his nephew lord who has despised him and the king of sodom and brought them back and let's see who came to welcome abraham when you forgive and you leave things to the lord say brother i can't forgive let me show you how you can forgive stop praying for the person [Applause] you can never hate someone that you pray for [Applause] whatever the temptation the devil put on you preface even if we're a thief a robber who robbed with guns if i'm going to rob pray lord i'm going to rob the bank i'm going to rob chase bank or wells fargo when you pray the lord will anoint your heart and go and tell the word of the lord to wells fargo that i plan to rob you but i love you i don't want to do that the lord will change your heart amen praise changes everything glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ abraham was always praying for lot regardless of how lord treated him he loved him he wasn't looking at what allah did he was looking at his promises because he saw himself as elohim he was represented elohim on the earth as job was representing lord on the earth so he went to fight and guess who met him the lord hadn't done that before the first time the lord placed himself in flesh puts his element on him and he called two angels they drop into existing element and brother that is the power that is in you we are four i believe you have experienced the thought in one point in our time there are certain times that you don't have to you don't even have the opportunity to pray but what you desire it comes from the inner man the holy ghost in you and enforce your mind and you project it to whatever you need projected to the situation i've seen at one time i saw two people fighting and i felt like it wasn't them i was looking at it dimensionally i said it's not them fighting it's the devil trying to destroy them and i couldn't go to separate them but i projected peace let them stop fighting and why did they stop fighting i didn't have to go separate them tell them that i don't fight but he that is in you let that thought project it from your heart is the same as the spoken word and it will manifest to the glory of the lord amen and that's what abraham did he wasn't a military he wasn't like a a military trained person he didn't have ak-47 but the thought of delivering a lot his nephew filled his heart and the pillow of fire in him defeated those people that were fighting against that had already captured a lot and brought them back and the lord he said mercy the king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was a priest of the most high god which i love the verse 19 and 20. and he blessed him in other words the lord blessed abraham and said blessed be abram you know by then he hasn't changed yet when you forgive the lord will bring your your desire to come to pass blessed be abraham of the messiah possessor of heaven and what and earth so is earth your inheritance yes you may not need a white house but whatever you need the lord gives it to you for the glory of his name for you serving him for you giving your life to him the lord will give you the desires of your heart amen and he said he blessed and he said blessed be the messiah which are delivered thine enemies into the hand and he gave him tithe of all now the lord blessed himself in abraham blessed be the messiah when you do something that pleases the lord don't think that you know we always look at the lord as supernatural he's like this pillow of fire and he doesn't have a human feeling no the bible said that jesus christ is what is a high priest who can be touched by what by the feeling of our infirmities and i want you to keep the ascription in your heart jesus christ is rule the high priest who can be what touched by what by the feeling of our infirmity so when you are sick don't imagine god far away our human senses sometimes limit us but see him in you that lord this is the flesh that you use to preach this is a flesh that you used to wear long skirts to display your attribute of holiness this is the flesh that you use to pray for people now this flesh is not feeling good this flesh is down this face has got blood pressure this place has got arthritis this pressure has got whatever it is headache and you just name it migraines and let the pillow fire in you heal you from within out let the consuming fire consume the demon of headache the whatever diabetes blood pressure let that pillow fight in you consume those demons consume those irregularities in their body and line their body up amen and when you speak those things will line up for you there was a time back in ghana a minister pastor invited me to go and preach and i was sick i was coughing sneezing and everything else so my assistant partner said you know what let's call brother oscar and let's make it another time say no we got to go so the next sunday the morning he said let's call him in let's call it off i don't know let's go so i went and i was sitting at the waiting room the church are praising they're having prison worship and as soon as i went to the pulpit i give the introduction i felt like something running through my body all the headache the sneezing whatever i just named it everything the fever was gone right that way and i gave a testimony before i preached in the brothers church the lord he is god and the lord is you are you married to jesus christ are you message jesus christ do you have the wedding ring the holy ghost in your heart then put a wedding ring you see how our sisters are happy when they marry first when they are walking they want you to know that they are misses if you've seen a newly awaited sister they wanted to see that hey i'm a sister and so so they kind of swing their arms to let you know that hey i've got this ready ring here sisters am i lying it's true in the natural types of spiritual if a natural woman is happy so happy with the husband she wants to display that hey i'm a sister and so what about the lord jesus christ when you are walking display the holy ghost that i'm wearing i may see jesus christ and i've got a wedding ring not just on my finger in your fingers somebody can pull your diamonds and you'll go that way and go and sell it at the pawn shop but now the holy ghost in your heart they wear the ring in your heart even if you take this flesh the holy ghost is still displaying amen it's never done say amen glory hallelujah it's a tenor amen and that is who you are blessed be the name of the lord let's go to the next scripture i'd like to run it off let me see have i read the scripture okay let's see [Music] glory hallelujah to the lord faith is a substance this is the very first message that abraham recorded 1947. so now the pentecostal restoration of the divine healing of divine healing now pentecost people have been praying for the last 30 or 40 years for a gift of healing we are living in the days when we've got the best medical science we ever had we got the best hospitals we ever had we got the best doctors we ever had we got the best drugs we ever practiced with and we got more sickness than we ever had there's thousands and hundreds of thousands of precious sins of god suffering tonight and i'll say this after this afternoon there are god sins that are suffering of sickness and they are crying and crying and cried for years for god to restore the gift of divine healing to the church and when god moved the orbit i love this one to me my best bible is the zodiac god bless you by the jack for this zodiac teaching because the zodiac is what the lord himself wrote with the paper bible humans can interfere we can have king james version we can have this version but with the zodiac and the pyramid nobody can can interfere with it it's god's own bible amen he said god moved the orbits 37 years ago look at where 1947. abram was born in 1909 so he was talking about when he was born that's when the lord chained the orbit he was born under the uh the star of aerys he was a ram just like the lord jesus christ and he came for give one of the greatest divine healing even more than what jesus did on earth it wasn't willie abraham no it was jesus christ hiding in the flesh of abraham manifesting divine healing upon the earth amen he said hendries even now god's children are sick he said and when the and when god and when god moved the orbit 37 years ago in other words when he was born and fought ordained and sending many hundreds of gods people are passing by without recognizing their friends but you have recognizing it recognizes that healing is you it's part of you it's just a bread and butter you take an eat believe don't worry about time don't look to the circumstance tell yourself i'm healed tell your family and he's healed tell your children they are saved tell your loved ones that they are covered they are full to the holy ghost don't look at them when they are doing drugs don't see them as drug dealers don't look at them as us as sinners don't look at them as fornicators but look at them as sins worshiping the lord and you place the token on them and let the thought in your heart project to them and they will follow right now don't worry about time when it doesn't matter the lord will take about when and how your says what believe think about it speak it and it will come to pass glory hallelujah to the lord [Applause] is there any more scripture i think probably the last one i guess any more quotes the church of the living god wow that's more than i thought i don't have it here god bless you let me see yes this is where we need to exercise some patience he said when you sow a seed you don't dig it up every morning to see the seeds come to pass if you do that your seed will never come up oh lord i pray for my heard they cannot have the headache do you even exist i pray for my children and my children are even doing worse it's a good sign that they are saved remember that the man that prayed for a blind man and was so blind and the man said but abraham i don't see you pronounce me hill but i'm not here that i so can't see he said what has it got to do with it because he's looking at the sixth dimension and he's seen a man with eyes open and the man is looking at the circumstance that i cannot see now this one has to have the faith to bring the diversion of him that sees from the sixth dimension to the second first second third and fourth dimension and what you pray for look at the dimension there's sometimes only the the feet that means they'll not allow the barrier so that you can what practice your faith because it's put something in you as a daughter of god that you have to bring it to pass he's not going to do it he's already in you that's why when moses was crying the lord came up from him and said moses why christ speak because he was hiding the moses just do i'm the one do moses don't cry don't look at yourself don't look at it people the military don't look at the two thousand people you are leading look at me in you and then moses came to himself and then said he pointed to the red sea and the rest he gave way and that's what we have to what restoration is coming to our self restoring our mind back to where we are let's let's really quickly what did i get to he said it's it's it's up to nature god so god is nature to water it and to see that it produces is that right is that true so that's the way you do it the word of the lord accept it in a good heart already fertilized and all the creepers and the rocky places and the stony doubts taken away and in good rich soil of what faith glory and believe it committed to the lord and walk away what do you say walk away another one one don't get yourself bothered with it just walk away speak it and walk away amen oh my goodness but i give them the offer that we have and we walk away let them battle with it amen [Applause] and walk away testifying that you've received what god has promised you and he's the high priest of your confession because he has got feeling in him just like your mother to make right anything that you confess that he has done that that's the gospel now the gospel isn't only the word could you imagine people freezing to death and i'll paint i'll paint them a picture of fire and i'll say look at this fire burning isn't it warm look at the people standing around warming but that's the only picture of something that has been you freeze you freeze just the same looking at the picture what it takes is that the fire to be reproduced again for your warmth the gospel fire and the gospel that was in that day it's written in the word as a history all that we read from the bible is a history that was recorded now he said a painted fire of what was so if you only look to the old examples in the bible then it's going to be just a painted fire that's why people read the same king james in many puppets but they don't see an ounce of supernatural in in their lives but look at this see the penis accept the same seed that they accepted and it will be a living reality in you that will bring you into the same experience that they had amen and i just don't want to go further let's go to the next next scripture i love this one roko in heaven god is calling names now put your name there amen it's not me i may not even know your name but god is calling you right now to who you are amen and this was the same one preaching that seven churches he said i'll confess his name before my father and his angels wrote call in heaven if a man die shall he leave again all the days of my appointed time will i wait so my change come thou shall call and i will answer thee thou will have a desire to their works for their hand this way i love it the great shepherd is calling his sheep by name the creative voice of god is calling them from forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they have not fallen asleep it is the rapture there's a great marriage supper of the lamp and it's bright amen the lord doesn't wait for you to die to call your name no he's changing your atoms by the holy ghost baptism remember brother stephen's testimony that when he went to the other side he saw even the same one that his pastor preached he saw that someone that he preached is what we are doing here is not brother jack it's not better quicker it's not that smiley it's not bad but but jerry is not brother troy it's not a solomon it's not any of us as a human being i didn't even choose this i wanted to be the best i had intellectual mind and i wanted to be a doctor or i wanted to be a scientist and discover things that was what i wanted to do but my father above chose this for me before the foundation of the world and he took me from amnesia and brought me to what i'm supposed to do on this earth and your father what you may not be the calling god that's for you

righteously amen the judgment of god is not to destroy you but to judge you and forgive you what is forgiveness forgiveness is god taking it away completely from you that your sin does not exist no way in any dimension how many desire to have the holy ghost baptism my brother myself that's the most important thing in your life there's a saying in my country that when you have to sell your mother to buy power sell your mother to buy power and when you get a power you redeem your mother back and have all the power in other words whatever you do to get the holy ghost let everything go from your life let go everything your friends whatever relationship that is illicit that is preventing you from christ taking full control of your life let it go completely in your life and this day because this may be the last day you hear such a same one the lord is calling you this might be your last time because you don't know where life is going to take you to so when you hear his voice the great shepherd calling you my daughter come you unto me surrender all your life unto me and i'll make you a fountain of living waters why don't you work as god why don't you be recognized in the kingdom of god that i am a daughter of god i am a son of god i possess my inheritance why do you wander in darkness in hunger in peril when your father is the richest man on earth amen the holy ghost baptism is the greatest things and if if you don't have it in your heart if i'm not sure whether i have it or not today's the time start receiving lord i don't want to go on in life because i don't know what may happen to me you might end up in a fight gunshot you might end up in somewhere that you never dream you're going to be friends will take you where you don't want to be it's not their friends it's the devil in them luring you to destruction gangs drugs sex and other addictions that devil can put upon you drinking on history partying but if you can receive him in the fullness of the word everything
