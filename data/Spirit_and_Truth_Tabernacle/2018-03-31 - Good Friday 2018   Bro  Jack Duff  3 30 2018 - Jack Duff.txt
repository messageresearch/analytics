Lord amen we're gonna tell you what I want to do this would happen I want to open the flow for testimony I want you to tell what God has done for you now if he ain't done this often for you then you just sit there and maybe tonight he'll do something but if he done anything for you anything come and testify will they be one will they be true I know he does something so - am i ashamed down anybody he done done for nobody - come on sister praise the Lord he done so for somebody a man I know he does something buddy in here everybody should have rushed up you amen [Music] I make this coupon I just wanted to take the opportunity to give God praise and glory he's done so much for me even know where to start but I guess the most recent thing I would say I thank God for the job that he blessed me with just came out of nowhere I really really love it it's a really important job I didn't realize it was that important till I got to it but for those of you don't know I work for the government and I'm a case manager so I'm in charge of keeping tuberculosis out of the community basically but I really love the job and it was tailor-made for me because while I was off for two years going through therapy you know I was praying to the Lord I need to get back to work I want to get back to work but I knew I couldn't go back doing patient care in the hospital because I can't lift the patient's so lord I need something that I can do well I don't have to lift patients but at the same time I don't have to sit all day because I can't sit for a long period of time either okay lord I don't know what kind of job this is but you know so I just was a plan you know I have no recollection of applying for this job in Fort Lauderdale I have no idea of how they got my resume but nevertheless they called me so and you know and it's just been a blessing ever since I've been there and I don't know why he has me going down there but you know I know it was for a reason so and I just pray that God will help me to be a light and just get myself out of the way that he may use me for a tool to be a blessing for somebody amen amen wonderful Savior amen I know sister Birds just walked in and but she has quite a testimony similar to that Amen about how to go Lord just blessed her with a a really a really good position I wonder honey if you want to give the testimony a man claims glory to God [Applause] I have been working for this agency it's a senior citizens AG's agency and their main purpose is to help seniors get back into the workplace and the positions that they send you out on they're not permanent he's supposed to constantly be looking for a job for a real job so I have been doing as they wanted me to do wasn't really looking for too hard but that was what I was supposed to do but anyway I have been going on a quite a few interviews and some of them really looked promising sounded promising but I guess once I got there to the different abuse they saw no matter what my qualification they told my age when they saw me and that really worked against me there really is age discrimination and it's kind of hard to swallow sometime but uh I came upon this ad for a position and Hospice about a couple of months ago and that's kind of half-heartedly said well I'll try that and I did one day at work about two weeks ago I got a call from a recruiter there at hospice and asked me if I was still interested in the position and I said yes yes I am so she explained all that it was to be for me and she says well you look like you know you have all the qualifications and I'm pretty sure this would be a good position for you now the position is for a clerk within the bereavement department that would assist the different counselors in meeting with families after their loved ones have deceased as part of the position and and it's something that really struck to my heart heart because when I was a volunteer for host hospice a couple years ago I really had a desire to become an employee there and different times I looked at positions that were open us maybe one day I'll I'll try that so I did try it so the recruiter called me on a Thursday then she called me back the following that know she coming back to a couple days and she said well I'm really gonna push your resume and your application through to the HR department she said just kind of want yours on top of everything else that's it well sure I thank you there kind of looked out of my heart I said once they seated a little old lady they may not worn it so they arranged for the interview I went to the interview last Monday and it went very well really really well I felt good about it they interviewed me like 10 o'clock that morning and I knew that they had some more that afternoon didn't know how many more they would be doing but they did have some more so about 3 o'clock I got a call from the recruiter again and she was a sister she said well how did it go I said well I thought it went well she said you should you sure you want the job here I say well I said yes I would I said I think it would be a good fit for me is something I deeply desire and I believe I'd be a good real good for your team so she says well I call you to offer you the job [Applause] she said yes they want they want to give you the job say yes I will take it I will take it so I will be starting with them on Monday and it's a part-time job that's that's as much as I want it I really didn't didn't want a full-time job it's a part-time job working 9:00 to 4:00 I mean 9:00 to 1:00 Monday through Friday just what I want and it's just the type of position that I want dealing with the people that I wanted I you know I I pray that God can use me there because it's a time when people the most vulnerable when they're going through their pain and and I just want to be a a light a blessing I'm Elena I truly thank the Lord for this to all the positions that I tried for I didn't get and I'm so glad that I didn't because that would have closed the door for this when so God knew what he knew what I wanted and he knew what he was preparing for me and I'm just so thankful really thankful for that and you'll keep me in your prayers amen hey man ain't God good wonderful Savior anybody else amen her standard I just want to thank a last semester I found out that this this current semester I was gonna have to take an internship through my English Program at school and there was a certain amount of hours that I have to work on my internship every week in order to meet the requirement and with my job and with school it was gonna be really hard for me to meet that requirement so I just worked it out with my schedule but it was a very hectic schedule sorry there were days I would go to work and then go to my internship and then go school or whatever it was just a lot going on every day and and I was getting extremely worn out by and I was sitting at my desk one day at the internship just thinking like okay I need to talk to my professor and just tell her I don't think that this is working out this semester maybe I hope to save it for the summer or something I just I don't know if I can handle all this and that day as I was getting ready to leave the lady who was training me at the internship she walked me outside and she never did that like she always just say Oh bye I have to let myself out type of thing so she walked me to the door and she took me outside with her and she was like I know you said you have a job but we're looking for a full-time writer here and you have been doing a really great job and we were wondering if you're interested and I have been there for a little less than two weeks and I had a lot to learn very very interesting position something I've never thought about but it definitely uses my degree and and she said you know we'd like for you to quit chick-fil-a so you can work here and I kind of like about quitting my job now know y'all yet so but but the more that I worked there and interned there I realized that I felt I felt like I was really supposed to be there especially because I've been kind of wondering what I was going to do when I graduated I knew I wanted to do something in my field of study but I wasn't quite sure what and and as I was just kind of working through it I was trying to figure out what I should do just some different things started changing on the job at chick-fil-a to where I I just honestly felt like it was time to leave and I didn't quite know what to do but I just prayed about it and I you know I one thing that I really needed was flexibility especially because I'm not done with school I really want to finish school and I don't want anybody to or anything to take away from my studies especially because I'm so close to the end and so I told the internship I told them I said you know I I do want to finish school and I do have classes that I'll have to take next semester as well and I'll need to be able to do that and she said well well let me talk to you let me talk to the owner and we'll see what he says the owner and his wife had to sit down with me and they said well what can you give us I told them the hours that I could work and they say well what we'll do is we'll bring you on and you work whenever you want to work you can work from home if you need to we'll pay you for that just make sure you tell us what hours you do and at the end of the week just send us a log of what you've been doing throughout the week and you'll be fine and whenever you graduate let us know and we'll put you will put you full-time and so I I am so thankful for that because these people don't know me at all they don't know if I'm gonna be honest with my hours and all of that but they told me I don't care what you do as long as you get the work done you know if you need to just take your work home and you can't finish it here just do that and if you don't have time to work at home that's fine do what you can in the office and and they they told me you know that basically whatever I needed from them I could have and I'm really really thankful for that so I thank God for a new job hey man my god my god when I we just had three testimonies and all three testimonies was how God gave people jobs that fit them perfectly made it around to what they need so you don't have to take what the devil give you trying to take you out of church God give you exactly what you need three testimonies they weren't even looking for these jobs he just said here's what you mean and gave it to him

tonight we have the grand privilege of honoring you for some 2000 years ago an act that had already occurred in heaven came to earth and it was before Calvary that's where you died to save sinners like us how grateful we are Lord to just reflect on that moment that's why we come to worship tonight we we think about Calvary and God as we've already felt your presence just a little at a time that we want to spend in your word here tonight pray that the Spirit of the Lord would just speak to us through the word of God it draw us closer to your God that's what we desire to draw nearer nearer and nearer blessed Lord to the cross where you dived may we always keep it in view no matter what it is that we're facing and we keep the cross in view it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen they gave the Lord another hand of praise [Applause] please the Lord can be seated thank you musicians I appreciate amen your service tonight my heart is a man just a little torn with a number of things that I have to minister own but I feel that it is most important for us to just go back and read what is Good Friday all about and then what what is what is Good Friday all about and the Gospels amen tell us the story and I chose a man to read from the book of mark 14 I'm gonna just accent you remain seated because this is a very lengthy a man scripture that will read and I don't want to have you standing all the way through it but I don't want to shortcut it either a man so I want to read from there and I had a couple other things that I had but maybe the Lord might turn that and will go a different direction we'll see what the Lord has but when we talk about Good Friday a man as Christians Amen this is a very important date just one of the greatest days to the Christian faith a man and and if there is ever time to go to church this is the weekend that you go right Amen then it an honor of what our Lord and Savior did for us nobody else could do it no no but nobody amen no no great preacher no profit no apostille no disciple nobody else could do this but the Lord Jesus Christ a man and and brother Ram said that God made the penalty so great that nobody could pay it only he himself could pay this price for us so if he is he is worthy of the glory he's worthy of the honor he's worthy of the priests and and and we need to give it to him Amen because he he he's done so much for us Amen but here I want to just pick up a man out of mark 14 and I am starting at verse 32 and this is the Lord has just had communion with the disciples and actually a start at verse 26 after after communion the Bible tells us this that when they had sung a hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives jesus saith unto them o ye look at all the disciples all ye should be offended because of me this night for it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered but after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee the Peter said unto Him although all shall be offended yet will not I write and this is Peter you know now Jesus has said everybody but Peter want to stand up and say not me I'm not gonna be offended in three sets verse 30 says and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto thee that this day even in this night before the crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice so he's prophesying and telling him every everything that's gonna happen but he spake the more vehemently if I should die with thee I would not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all but he's already told them what was getting ready to happen a verse 32 says and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit ye here while I shall pray and he taketh with him Peter and James and John and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him Amen if it were possible the hour might pass from him now if I can I pray the Lord will help us you know get in there but I want to just drop this but I was listening to this sermon that day on Calvary and and brother Branham made a comment there he said that not just it wasn't just Jesus a man that had a Calvary a man but he says that every Son of God must have their day at Calvary and and what that means is that there'll be some things that's gonna come in your life the way that this came in the Lord Jesus life and you're gonna be praying and asking God to remove that thing from you but you're gonna have to get to a point where you're gonna have to humble yourself to the will of God and say Lord not my will but your will be done amen you got to have your own Calvary something that will shake you down hallelujah it will try your Christianity right but we all as believers have to have our own Calvary a man you can't run from it all right but he goes on to say this it says verse 35 and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away there's cut for me nevertheless not what I will but what thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon sleep is down could it's not thou watch one hour watch II and pray the less she enter into temptation the Spirit truly is ready the flesh is weak and again he went and went away and prayed and speak the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for the eyes were heavy neither whist day what to answer him any Kenney and he cometh the third time I said unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hours come behold the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand and notice now it says and immediately while he yet spake cometh Judas one of the twelve with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same as he take him and lead him away safely so when we come into church especially on this Good Friday night this is the event that we have in our hearts and in our minds this what happened to the Lord Jesus you know so going let's go into says and they they laid their hands on him and took him did I skip verse 45 all right it says and as soon as he was become he going straight way to him and said master master and kissed him and they laid their hands on him and took him and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear and jesus answered and said unto Him are you come out as against a thief with swords and with stage to take me I was daily with you in the temple teaching and you took me not but the Scriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled this is what he just told them they would do they all forsook him and fled and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young man laid hold on him and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked and they led Jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and Peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sent with the servants and warmed himself at the fire and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death and found none for many many bear false witness against him but their witness agreed not together and there rose certain and bear false witness against him saying we heard him say I would destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days I will build another made without hands but neither so did their witness agree together and the high priest stood up in the midst in axe Jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest acts him and said unto Him aren't thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed and Jesus said I am and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rented clothes and saith what what need we any further witness now according to scripture the high priest was not supposed to tear his clothes like that he actually broke the word by doing what he just did alright so you have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death and some began to spit on him think about this this is our Lord and Savior a man on Good Friday this is what this was the treatment that was given to him some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buff it him and to say unto Him prophesy and the service did strike him with the palms of their hands and as Peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the midst of one of the maids of the high priests and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also was with Jesus of Nazareth but he did not say I know not and I don't understand I what thou sayeth and he went out in the porch and the crew any animate saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to Peter surely thou art one of them for thou are a gal aaliyan and thy speech agree there too but he began to curse and to swear he changed this language because of the situation but he began to curse and to swear saying I know not this man of who you speak and the second time the crew and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him before the crew crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice thrice and when he went and went and when he thought there on he wept now if oh my y'all just stay with me I want to keep reading here going on the chapter 15 in a straight way in the morning the chief priest held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound Jesus and carried him away and delivered him to Pilate Pilate acts him are without a king of the Jews and and and he answering said unto Him thou sayest it and the chief priests accuse him of many things but he answered nothing and Pilate acts him against answering saying answerest thou nothing big bow behold how many things they witness against thee but Jesus yet answered nothing so that Pilate marvelled now at the feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired and there was one named Barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection and again many of you all know Barabbas first name was Jesus they meant his name was Jesus Barabbas and you know the problem here is that they chose the wrong Jesus how they lose you a man they chose the wrong Jesus so they wanted Jesus Barabbas which was a murderer rather than Jesus to Christ which was a redeemer and a savior look at this verse verse 8 and you know even today we're still choosing the wrong things right we need that we need that we need to choose Christ a man don't choose the world choose Christ and the multitude crying hallelujah choose Christ amen you know oftentimes young people they get to a certain age Amen in life and they feel like once I cross this threshold I can do whatever I want to do when you get to the threshold choose Christ's a man don't don't choose the world choose Christ amen some do it at twenty-one some do it at 18 but choose Christ's when you get to that threshold choose Christ praise the Lord don't choose the world choose Christ alright verse eight and says that and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them and but Pilate answered them saying will ye then I release him to you the King of the Jews for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy he detected their spirit right but the chief priest moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas unto them and Pilate answered and said again unto them what will you then that I shall do unto him whom he called the king of the Jews and they cried out again crucify him this is this is Good Friday then Pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him and so Pilate willing to content the people released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus when he had scourge him to be crucified and the soldiers led him away into the hall call Praetorian and they called together the whole band and they clothed him with purple and planted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and began to salute him hail King of the Jews and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him they were mocking our Lord and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him and they compared one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross and they bring him unto the place called Gotham which is being interpreted the place of a skull and they gave him to drink wine mingled with mirth but he received it not and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting Lots upon them or whatever what every man should take and it was the third hour and they crucified him and the superscription of his acuse was written over the king over the king of the Jews and with him they crucified two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his left and this and the scripture was fulfilled which saith he was numbered with the transgressors and then and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroys the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself and come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him revived him and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and see there was never a day like this day brother Branham say there was never day like it and there never will be a day after that was like this day says that look at the Sun Sun went down you know in the middle of the day here the Bible said when the six hours come live darkness over the earth the whole land the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice ting LOI LOI lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my God my God why hast thou forsaken me now it's being interpreted they don't know what he actually said now I have a statement hopefully I can get to it here in a little bit but they don't know what he said they're saying it's being interpreted okay it's being interpreted my God my God why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood by when they heard it said the holy calleth Elisha and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink saying let alone let us see whether your logic will come to take him down and Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghosts and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and whether its interior which stood over against him saw that he's so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son god I want to just hit a couple things here if I can I'm gonna read from the sermon that day on Calvary and I'm gonna start here at paragraph 66 and if you all bear with me we will go as far as we can tonight I got I got something else that I wanted to present on Sunday but we'll just see what the Lord what the Lord does I'll go as far as I can tonight and I might have to pick up some of this and bring it in and bring it into Sunday amen as well but we just give it to the Lord but tonight being Good Friday we just want to just take a little time and just just just focus on amen on that tonight the Prophet says this and and this message that day on Calvary says Abraham don't have to wander no more cross the country seeking a city it says the sinner don't have to wander anymore whether he can be saved or not the sick man doesn't have to wonder whether he can be healed or not right because of what happened at Calvary we don't have to wander about saying when I have to wander a man about about sickness amen all those things were taken care of at Calvary he says the opening veil on that day at Calvary revealed the way to total victory God give us the powers of his spirit to live triumphantly over all of these things ask only access to do access only to believe it that happened on that day at Calvary there never was a day like it there never will be one like it it is not necessary no more the price is paid and we are redeemed thanks be to God we are redeemed he said there's no way you have to wonder about there's no more guessing about it it's all took away the veil pulled back the curtain and we're set on a highway not to wander anymore but to believe and just walk right on we'll walk right into the into God's very presence Amen everything was settled at Calvary now it makes it I'm gonna just hit some comments here a man that we pulling from that del cavalry it says if this day being so important one of the greatest days he says let us look at it three different things that that they meant to us let's look at it we're going to look at three different things as to why you know you say there's thousands of things we can look at but he chose three things and he said let's focus on those three things to show what that day actually means to us the first thing he says it's settled the same question hallelujah Calvary settled the same question the reason it's a good Friday to me right because it's settled the same question right sin started in heaven and you can you can get ready from the revelations twenty and ten see it don't pull it up yet I'll tell you when to pull it up but but sin started in heaven the privacy when Lucifer was given the preeminence is to make his choice he wanted something better than God and that started the trouble he says but the Bible said the soul that sinneth it shall surely die not the man that sinneth but the soul that sinneth and he goes on the city says so so Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed hallelujah it's settled the same question he says Satan must surely die to be completely destroyed uh saying we found that in Revelation 20 and 10 look at this a and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever Satan will come to an end a man Satan started this unbelief Satan started this sin and Satan's gonna have to die for it now you can see what Satan was trying to do he knew that you know what his penalty was some but he also knew that there was a penalty for sin in the garden oh y'all y'all stay with me here tonight the penalty with sin was death God established that in Genesis 2 and 17 hallelujah y'all just go with me on journey tonight through Scripture God a step if with the penalty for sin was death Satan established it Satan sinned in heaven Satan will die for his sin hallelujah amen if since he knows that he's going to die he's trying to bring some other people into it with them now imma tell you something when people get involved in seeing they don't like to go down by himself they like to try to bring other people into a rhythm and Satanist ROM that brings some people into it with them but count early set you free from that you ain't got you ain't got a joint Satan's gang you can follow Jesus Christ hallelujah Genesis 2:17 this is where God establish the penalty for sin says by the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die right so if they if they if they disbelieve the Word of God they come from behind the Word of God it will produce death amen I understand that law that God just gave Adam a man that law always existed their law didn't just come into coming to come into place when God put it in Genesis - oh I hope y'all with me now let me just let me let me go back a little further Moses is the one that told us what happened in Genesis but now how did Adam know that law when Moses it was not even written in Scripture we didn't have a Bible before Moses come along and wrote these things that law always existed in God's mind and not only did the law existing God's mine for the earth that law existed for Satan in heaven that's why the purpose said that he has to die as well he was the one these are one that committed sin in the beginning he has to die for his sin but you ain't got a time for yours because Christ went to Calvary and died for yours oh you don't know what Redemption means a man you don't have to worry Church it meant you in a good spot tonight but Satan got a lot to worry about and he's trying to pull some people in with all glory to God look at that the penalty sin was death now that we just read here in Genesis 2:17 but let me get Romans 5:17 amen it says this for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ amen I'm no longer under Amen just just because of what Adam did when he sold us out to sin amen and yes he's certainly I mean death settled in for the for humankind and Satan probably thought man I got him down because death is sudden but Jesus took the keys of death hell and the grave right so we don't have to fear death anymore the same question has been settled amen the bill has been settled with God that's what Jesus did at Calvary look at this and in our wrong and in Psalms 51 and five and I just got a few scriptures that I want to read to you a man to show you that it has been settled and first of all we got to acknowledge that we are sinners amen we are sinners and we need at this price to be paid Christ paid that price Psalm 51 and five establishes behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me hallelujah we have to establish that we are sinners and Romans 3:23 also tells us this for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God even if you were born on the back peel of the church you still a sinner and you needed a savior hallelujah calimary produced the Savior amen Romans 5:8 tells us this says but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us a man what a beautiful picture right while we were yet sinners Christ already died for us now Satan don't have their testimony but I got that testimony that's what Calvary means for me that cry took my place before I was even born before I knew what he had done for me all the sin that I had a meant that I had committed it was felt and God's account it was already settled hallelujah glory to God I came from God and I'm going back to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah look at this he also says this and Isaiah 1:18 says come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool see Calvary it's settled the same question we can approach God Amen we can come to God because he wants to watch us from our stands brother Branham also said the second thing Calvary provided a deathblow to Satan he says Calvary provided a deathblow he also say it broke the Devils back now i'ma tell you when your back is broken a much you can do it's pretty hard to get around it's been pretty hard to do anything you can't get up when you got problems with the back right and the Devils back has been broken Calvary broke his back ain't no sis's not sparing a gavel to broke back he can't even fight ain't nothing he can do right and Calvary broke the Devils back Oh glory to God they want one thing I tell you Calvary did it released us from the fear of death no longer are we afraid to die as believers actually we come to understand that we don't die we sleep Oh glory to God thank God for Calvary can we pull up 1st Corinthians 15 verse 55 halleluiah look at this he said Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast amen when you get a revelation of Calvary this is the way you're gonna be PE stay offense always do something God look at this unmovable come on somebody it's the way we need to be as Christian I'm move away nobody gotta beg you to come to church I'm still an unmovable always abounding in the work of the law for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord hey he is coming after a while glory to God amen the Devils back his broke church a man it's not our backs but his back is broken be working for the Lord Calvary produced that if there's a quote that I want to just read here out of that day on Calvary I'm at paragraph 69 hallelujah and now this goes back to what we were saying a man when Jesus was on the cross and he began to scream I LOI LOI lama sabachthani and the scripture says it was being in which is being interpreted my God my God why hast thou forsaken me now the Prophet introduces something says that that was a deathblow of Satan's power - Satan's power he says it ended everything and I can see him there he was Eden's lamb from the very first shadow that come of it when Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than King he must have tied a grape vine around a lambs neck drugged him up to the rock took a rock in his hand for a lamps and pulled this little head back and chopped and hacked him until he died and his wool bathe with his own blood he wallow in his and in his blood it was a shadow this is how about Abel and Abel offering God a lamb he spent but on that day at Calvary there wasn't a lamb of this earth but it was a lamb God that was dying wallowing in his own butt blood he what he has he was hacked and chopped and beat and and spit on and slammed and and smacked and everything by the world and the blood dripping off of his locks when Abel's lamb died it died speaking in a language that Abel cannot understand it was bleeding and when God's lamb died that dead Calvary he spoke in a language that no one understood him my God my God why hast thou forsaken me it was God's lamb hacked to pieces chopped up he was a very lamb that Abel had in mind when he seen the promised seed of the woman he was the Lamb that Daniel saw that was hewn out of the mountain without hands he was the wheel in the middle of the wheel for the Prophet all they had foresaw was meant on that day at Calvary that brought the great thing in that broke the back of Satan see when when Abel's lamb start bleeding Athy was f he was there on the altar there in Genesis brother Branham say he spoke in a language that they're able could not understand and say the same Lamb of God as he was there on the cross when he cried out ello ello ello by loi suboxone he spoke in a language that nobody understood because the same Lamb he was a type of the same land that Abel offered hallelujah he was that same he was that lamb for us oh my that's why he that's why he spoke those words lol oh by soo bahk Denis Amen a perfect landing you all remember you remember there was a skull do you remember there was a skull at gum Gotha right and and that that skull happened to be able swather come on y'all Abel's father had his skull so when that when that blood a man began streaming down it redeemed not just Adam but redeemed the entire fallen race of Adam thank God for Calvary the brother brother Branham goes on a little further here it says when we you know understand what Calvary is all about a man needs two things first it's settled the same question and secondly if it broke and delivered a deft load of Satan's power it delivered a death blow i'ma tell you there's just no area in our life where Satan should be victorious not even in death can the devil be victorious to a believer death is a buggy that pulls us into the presence of God right we're not even afraid of death as believers Calvary gives us that type of confidence no fear because of Calvary he says but the last thing here is that now we should do some things in return for the great sacrifice of Calvary and one of the things that he said and line me up a couple scriptures here the first one I'm going to hit is John 1719 and then I'm gonna go to Romans 6 verse 6 through 13 but these are some things that the prophecies say you become because of Calvary you become sons and you take the place of Christ you become sons and daughters of God and you take the place of Christ and he also said every Son of God not and becoming a son of God becoming a daughter of God say every son of God must have their day at Calvary glory to God like there's gonna be a death to yourself alright and and the last thing you said is when we get there and we've had a mint our day at Calvary then what it should do is he says eternal life a man is something that we give to others and eternal life is living for others eternal life is living for others eternal life living for somebody else you know that's that's what Christ did when he went to the cross when when he went when it when he was there on the cross and he yelled out Father forgive them for they know not what they do that was life being lived for others oh my god all this all the spit and all the hitting all the chastisement that he went through he did that because he had to do something for others oh my god you're gonna have to go through some things and you're doing it for somebody else not for yourself you're having your personal Calvary oh Jesus and when we have that personal Cavalry it strips us it really it really shakes us down amen we and we all got to have it church we can run from it this is the hour where we need to understand that great trial you're going through some personal Calvary you dime to yourself Oh hallelujah look at this and it says eternal life is living for others now reach something a little bit about that but I want you to try to get some of these things that he makes mention of oh my John 1719 says this and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth oh you can't live like a devil you got to live like Christ you're gonna have to sanctify yourself oh yeah you came talking to when they talk if they letting all kind of curse words fly their mouth you can't talk that way you got to sanctify yourself for their sake Oh hallelujah hey man you have to sanctify yourself for the sake of others amen they get round up you get calm down praise the Lord somebody but this is what this is what uh you know this is this is what we get back to Calvary we're grateful for what Calvary gave us but now what are we giving back to Calvary look at this he also says this in in Romans 6 verse 6 through 13 Paul says knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin but he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God and this is the verse that brother branham's referred to it says likewise reckon you yo Rick and you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness understand but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God see every son of God you got to have your own personal Calvary now there's a statement that it makes here that ties right into what we were talking about on Wednesday night and I want to read this this is out of that day on Calvary paragraph 79 says this then when he died at Calvary he made a way he gave up the spirit the holy spirit that sent it back he gave up the spirit the holy spirit that sent it back to the earth for you and I to live by that's what Calvary means to us to follow him first look look into it see what it did for us and how and now what must we do in regards to int what must you and I do now we say well I appreciate that that's very fine but we've got to accept him and to accept it is to accept his person Christ in our heart then we are free from sin therefore there's no sin shackles hanging on us at all God just like we had never sinned you see that there's no sin shackles hanging on us it's just as if we never sinned Calvary wiped it all away Calvary settled the same question Calvary placed it in the sea if a gift for this think about it since but we got takes tipped and to accept it is to accept this person Christ in my heart then we're free from sin there's no sin shackles hanging on us at all got just like we had never sinned the perfect sacrifice the perfect sacrifice made us perfect so Jesus sent being therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect then there's no more to be done but we are perfect we are made perfect in the presence of God he goes on now there's where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what what we was and as long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice means nothing to us I wanna I wanna I just want to hang out there I want to hang out there I can I'm a just I'm gonna tell y'all it's some pictures that you don't need no more some pictures you need to just go ahead and get rid of I just want to see where God brought me from no as you if you keep looking back right if you keep looking back like brother branham say if you don't watch we try to look back to what we was as long as we look back then the sacrifice don't mean anything so what we need to get rid of what happened in the past and we need to move forward into the future brother Willie told us that last last Friday say that that they said the young man went home told dad said son so say you you did this daddy you did this you used to do this used to that's that's that's not no I know I didn't so dad as the man said you did it said no I didn't do it he said he say well you say without what you need to just tell that man that toy you tell him that guy died that man dead there's no history of him anymore he's gone and saying and tell him I'll let him know if he want to know let I let him know how the man died I give him my test on how that man died but we need to get rid of the pass let the past stay in the past and move forward in the future [Music] hallelujah because sometime the past keeps us there right God trying to bring you forward but you keep looking backward and what was that somebody sent to the brothers little group we look at in a rearview mirror we'll crash we don't want to do that life you'll crash looking in the rearview mirror hey you gotta stop allowing that devil to bring up your pass if you know you cook you're not confessed it then it's underneath the blood and tell the devil if he keep on swimming he gonna drown in the sea of forgetfulness my God my God amen we got to know what the blood means to us alright Church come on I'm going further here Amen he says now Oh glory to God he says if you if we don't watch it we try to look back to what we was and as long as we look back to what we was that sacrifice means nothing to us Oh can't you see a church I wouldn't I would not try the job I can't and neither Nathan neither can you there's no need of trying you're lost to begin with as long as you look at what you've done but don't look to what you've done look what that day o Calvary did to you it paid your price it's settled the question your sins be as scarlet there's white as snow red like crimson white like wool then you have no sin what you have no sin that's what Calvary did it wipe your sins out none I mean you know they had all the same how the the it's not Jesus in the going through a filing cabinet this person saw Jesus going through a filing cabinet he would look at the filing cabinet and pull out an Aldus record you know of all the sins that a person didn't just look at my own mind my mind this person walks up and say Oh Lord that he when he found my file Oh God 25 my file and when he goes and he looks to just a bunch of blank white papers there's empty papers and they all Lord Jesus no I ain't gonna make it in because all that and when Jesus pulls the paper out it says forgiving it was wiped out the slate was clean and there was nothing there in the file you need to know there's nothing in your file there's nothing against you that's why that's why we celebrate Calvary that's why we celebrate Good Friday to the world some might think it was a really sad day that our Lord had to be crucified the way he's crucified but no what he brought to us makes it a good Friday and there's never been a day like it and there never will be a day like it thank God for Good Friday can I go on you have no sin you have no sin I told y'all God don't waste this time giving y'all words like this there's other churches you might go to you'll never hear nothing like that you have no sin listen you are perfectly sinless can I go further no matter what you done perfectly sinless no matter what you've done and what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior your sins are forgiven anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition his spirit to follow him and do as he did for others who was following on let's go on he says he was just one man the perfect man He gave His life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say Jesus never live for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life for others you have you have but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others my god and so now when it when we're taught live others he said as many churches that were to they haunt about we went into this city and we we did this for this group and we did that for this group we fed this many poor people in this many you know people we get clothes or whatever there's many homeless people they say you know when you're doing that you actually missing the point when you got a two-tone horn you missing the point it's like what it should be is like if you were thirsty and you're going you know to get yourself something to drink and you knew your brother was thirsty or your sister was thirsty all you would do is go to the refrigerator and get them a drink as well if you're getting one for yourself you get one for them and when you give it to them they don't even have to say thank you right you're not trying to get your horn Tooting right for them to say thing it was just something that was natural and that's the same way it should be when you serving God and doing something for somebody else you don't do it to get your horn to dit you do it because it's natural eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive your eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others let me go on it says someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names look at it you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man huh y'all not getting this yeah I'm not getting this you allow a person to say all kind of stuff treat you any kind of way because you're trying to redeem them oh my see this girl's deeper than what he did at Calvary now is what you're doing in your personal Calvary you become sons and the trouble of it is that Church has forgot they were sons you assumes you're taking Christ place now everybody want to talk about the caste mountain Delos Park but no in order to get to that part you got to go through this part listen you're taking Christ place your sons so don't live for yourself live for others Amen well brother branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who kill you if they could you know how to say looks Coquille live for that person look at it they say he says live that person who kill you if they could that's what they've done to him they killed him and he did that he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you get that's in your bosom your face in heaven then you know remember the Braniff say he went to the other side and say he can really describe what happens right but he said it's perfect love perfect love and we can't wait to get there to have it so you can have your perfect you're gonna have your personal Calvary here you can die to yourself you can learn how to love like Jesus I'm going further when you get that that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like sheep give its wool you look on tourists Calvary he says we're not and I got another statement we'll stop there on that quote he says we're not just becoming church members see we're not just coming to church just to be coming to church we're not becoming church member but we're becoming sons and daughters of God and I just want to just share a couple other things with you amen a couple scriptures in there now I'll close it out for tonight Matthew 5 we go back to that because brother Brown just quoted it about being perfect as I'm perfect and look at it says you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but I said to you love you and he miss bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you see this is a personal Calvary right and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven this is this is what makes you like like Christ right this is that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust verse 46 for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same he says and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect see Calvary otta produced this type of life out of us he goes on in a couple other scriptures that I want to bring to you John 14:12 so we're taking the place of God the priests place with Christ on the earth it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father now I want you to understand the greater works that brother Branham was I mean brother Branham brought to our attention in that scripture say the greater works was not just a man healing the sick or casting out Devils that's not the great works that's where a lot of people leave it but on that date Calvary say the greater works was to impart eternal life he says he had this he says what does he turn a life the life that he lived the life that was in him and part that to others can a man do that he said a son of a son of God can and he quoted this scripture when he said a son of God can impart eternal life John 20 verse 22 through 23 I'm telling y'all Calvary takes us a little further than where we've been we talked about his death but I wonder if we're ready to come to our own person to death at Calvary John 20 verse 22 and 23 and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost and notice this this is what imparting eternal life is all about whosoever since year Ament they are remitted unto them and whosoever Sanji retain they are retained you have the power to either remit it or retain it now you know that that if you go back in scripture did not Joseph have that same power when they come to a place of authority there in Egypt and his family showed up they thought for sure Joseph wouldn't forgive them but Joseph actually told them God meant it for good he had the power to impart life Joseph had that power and you as sons and daughters of God had that same power tonight Lord I tell you who service says here admit there a minute but who services he retained their retained brother Brandon when that when that couple came to church and they was hugging in the church they were back there hugging in the church now you need to understand that's not what church is for church is not for cuddling churches for worshiping right but they were cuddling and I went from cuddling to kissing and while they were in the church that started all this kissing and brother em say uh please don't do that so that's that's very you know disrespectful to the Spirit of God please don't do that so they say they wouldn't stop the kepco has it please don't do that and you know and they they just kept going kept going so finally you know the Holy Spirit says whatever you say they are in your hands right now whatever you say will be done so brother Brandon like well what do I say and they say he looked at him and and and the Holy Spirit told him days before he said I'm sending a big test your way they call it a big test and he never told him what the test was and if the test was that couple in the presence of the Lord doing something that they weren't supposed to be doing and he said he said he said uh it says well he said whatever you say to him if you tell the drop dead they'll drop that right now my brother branham say I don't know what to say he said whatever you say it could happen and he looked at him and said I forgive you and the oldest Pierce a I'm pleased with that that was a big test how you handled it and it had every right to come down on oh my come on yo yeah I'm not y'all not with me tonight he had every right to come down on them because of what they had done he had every right but to sacrifice that to forfeit that to give that up is a Calvary Oh whoever says here emit they're emitting and who service sins you retain they are retained and brother and Peter for the branch that was the one that gave us a prescription for remission so how do we remit sin how do we impart eternal life it's not like we just walk up and give it to somebody but it's the way that we testify to him and lead them to Christ and the one Scripture when we want to remit and we want to show somebody how to get their sins we admit it we tell them acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call Calvary had a couple things that the Prophet looked at one of those was what what happened there is settled to send question the second thing is that it it delivered a death blow to Satan's power and with those things in mind now we should have something that we do in return for the great sacrifice we are here to carry on where Jesus left off and in order for Jesus the character of Jesus to be expressed the way it was that same character has to be expressed to us but in order for that to happen Church we got it down to ourselves and we got to be willing to go to a personal Calvary hey man it ought to be a good Friday for you now if you got some things that you've been holding on to that you need to let go of let the let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart so you can get rid of it maybe it's people that you need to forgive amen we talked about it on Wednesday night how you can you can't you can't go to the president Lord and pray amen for somebody as a mortal and and hold things against them while you're praying for what you need to do is go and kind of kind of enter to you know think the way that they would think act the way they would act and try to understand why they might have did what they did get into their channel right and as you get into that maybe to show you a few things about them so then when you come out of that then you can just kinda shake the hands and God bless you and never say a word about it say calibre is when you can just give up when you can just quit you can lay it aside say Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing that's a true gallery we all need that we all need that I want to end there we'll have a time of Prayer here and maybe I'm Sunday there's some other things I have here but I'll try to slip that in on Sunday father we are grateful for Calvary and when we really think about these things and what would occur there some 2,000 years ago we wouldn't be sitting where we are had it not been for that Lord your prophet helps it challenge this isn't lets us see that it goes further than just what you did but now it's what we need to do we got to die to ourselves divert our thoughts down to our feelings our flesh we got to die to it so yes there are things that would be that'll happen things that'll be sad things have to be done and it'll hurt that's what happened to you God those things that were said the people spitting on you and hitting you and my turnin on you we just talked about last suddenly how you you wrote in to the city and Lord into Jerusalem and all the people yelling and screaming Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord but within one week's time those same people had turned and now they're saying if if if this be the Son of God then let them come down off the cross but they didn't understand that had you come down off that cross then these things that we talked about tonight wouldn't be settled so thank you for paying the ultimate price thank you for doing what nobody else could do there was no man worthy nobody could take the book and loose the seals thereof only the lamb can do it so we think you got and help us Lord to to constantly be reminded like the prophets the addition just be a one day a year thing that we think about this but every day should be a day of Calvary every day should be a day where we're dying to ourselves every day should be a day where we're thinking about giving more to you we want to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of Lourdes not compromising in any way but giving you everything we have you deserve it is in the mighty name of Jesus that we pray [Music] amen let's just singer a little bit of this so just think about these just what Calvert means to you goddess a deaf to myself help me God I lay myself on the altar tonight let me be crucified let me die out to Who I am come alive to who you are let that be your a personal prayer [Music] my hallelujah belongs to my hallelujah

that's Jesus yeah sing it again my heart yeah [Applause] come on give a lot of have the phrase at this place tonight thank you Jesus man if you have the opportunity on tomorrow let's go back and listen to that sermon that day on Calvary the Prophet just brings in so many things that just challenges our our spirits a man we just appreciate that I wanted to once again just thank everyone for those that participated during this time of fasting technically last night would have been the last last night of the fast today it would be over for myself I wanted to go through this Good Friday amen and thought that it was just very appropriate that it was ending on this Good Friday and just kind of make it right through and at 12 o'clock tonight the fast will well actually and but I wanted to thank you all for participating amen and whatever way you did certainly appreciated it's not many churches today that even do any of these things but we're under expectation for God to do great things and I miss amen and one of the one of the greatest things is to be able to see Souls delivered and their lives changed amen and as we have prepared for Sunday morning a lot of time to get visitors you get people that you've never seen before a show of the church but we want God to do something and then walk God to speak to their hearts and let the Holy Spirit just kind of come and just flood souls and just just cause a change and I just believe God will honor a man our faith in and honor our position in the fast so I pray that whatever you might have had in your heart that God would even grant that to you and man as you were going through the fast may God grant that may you see not many days hence but I wanted to thank you all once again for participating you know the day of Pentecost did not come until they were all in one mind and in one Accord amen and that's what we need as a church to get in why my in one Accord and we'll see God do mighty things amen in our bids and then let's have a word of Prayer before we prepare to dismiss you on today tonight father we are once again grateful for all that you have done we can never take Calvary lightly Lord so much that you suffered so much that you went through is the worst death that any man could ever die you did that for us and I'm selfish enough to believe tonight that had there not been anybody else God to go to Calvary for you would have went just for being and God I'm grateful for that love that that you were demonstrating that you would show I'm grateful for amen the struggle that you had there in the Garden of Gethsemane and brother Adam told us that that was where the death really took place was in the Garden of Gethsemane oh by Calvary was just an act but but when you died to your thoughts you died to your ideas you died to your your desires you said nevertheless not my will but your will be done God that's where Calvary took place and God let that be our testimony let it happen tonight that we would come to a place Lord not my will but your will be done that we went yield completely to you and allow you God to be manifested in us Oh God our sins have been forgiven we are perfectly sinless there's nothing held to our account God we're grateful for what you've done nobody else could do it but you Lord Jesus as we are bringing ourselves Lord to a close and this time of fasting lord I I pray your blessings upon each and every one that has participated more than as fast and God as we've entered ourselves out Lord now may you come and fill us up we pray that the spirit with God just continue to deal with us throughout the day on tomorrow and Lord as we prepare to come back for Easter Sunday look we don't know who adopt those doors we don't know who walk in but God we pray they come in one way that they would leave this place different God that they would not remain the same they might be coming out of tradition God but may the Holy Spirit get a hold of hearts made a holy spirit get a hold of lives in this place and God may eternal life be imparted got their mothers that are holding on for their children their father's holding over their children God may they see change take place on Sunday God made a resurrection take place in the lives of people Oh God we AXA to remove by your spirit and made a holy ghost just have its way in this place Lord we trust we trust Lord that you will honor every request in every desire you know what's in the people's hearts you know what their needs are so God ministered to each and every one of them meant minister to each and every one of them fathers our prayer as we leave this place but not your presence bring us back at the point time for prayer on Sunday morning for Sunday School for worship and God just by your grace Lord that this Sunday also happens to be communion sunday so so much Lord that we can be grateful for thankful for we we we want to show that we want to express that and everything we do for you
