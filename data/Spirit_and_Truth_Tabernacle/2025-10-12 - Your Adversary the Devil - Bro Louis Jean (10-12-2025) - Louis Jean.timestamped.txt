[40:52] let me set up how we're going to do it.

[41:33] got to say amen. That's the word of God.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; That's the will of God. So understood. I
[41:39] don't mind if you don't say amen. But
[41:40] when the word will of Lord, say amen for
[41:43] the word,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; not for the man, but for the Lord. Amen
[41:48] for the Lord.

[42:16] what a precious day this is, Father.
[42:19] Oh God, this is the portion of the
[42:21] service, Lord, where the word meets the
[42:24] word.
[42:25] And Father God, we thank you, Lord, that
[42:28] the ground has been prepared, Lord God.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; The foundation has been set, oh Father
[42:33] God,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; and Lord, we just ask that you would
[42:36] speak one word to us, Lord.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; One word will make the change, Lord. One
[42:40] word will make the difference, Father
[42:41] God.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; So, Father God, anoint our brother even
[42:45] now, Lord God. Have the preeminence in
[42:47] him, Lord Jesus. And Lord, may you take
[42:50] over, Father God. That every spirit in
[42:52] this place would be under your
[42:53] subjection, Father. That every word that
[42:56] will come forth, Lord, will bring forth
[42:57] life.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Father God, I pray that you would have
[43:01] your way even now, Lord. And God, we
[43:03] thank you for your word. In the name of
[43:05] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Amen. We first Peter
[43:14] 5 verse 8.
[43:21] just one verse only.
[43:24] I can see that.
[43:41] He says,
[43:43] "Be sober, be vigilant,
[43:47] because your adversary, the devil, as a
[43:50] war lying, walked about seeking whom he
[43:54] may devour."
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be seated.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Our subject this morning is your
[44:03] adversary, the devil.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Do you have an adversary? Do you have
[44:09] one?
[44:10] &gt;&gt; You think so?
[44:12] Sometime Jack brother and sister lives
[44:15] there on the millennium.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; So I mean they thought Satan is bound
[44:20] for thousand years. So that mean hey I
[44:22] can do whatever I want. There's no
[44:24] devil. No.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; So
[44:29] the Lord want you to be be vigilant.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Be sober.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Because Leody at church is is lukewarm.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; They're not hot, no cold. They come to
[44:40] church. Yes. Listen to the preacher.
[44:43] Sometime they say, "Amen." Sometime they
[44:45] done.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; So they don't care sometime.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; But the Lord want you to be vigilant.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Be sober.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Because we have an adversary.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Sometime I always told my young brother
[45:01] and sister in the church, don't think
[45:03] your mother, your father is your
[45:05] adversary.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; You have an adversary too. Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; You have an adversary too.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Have to be mindful of adversary that we
[45:14] have.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Most of the time they say, "Well, mommy,
[45:17] daddy, you always nagging at me. You my
[45:19] adversary." No, not just your man.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Not the pastor, not the minister.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; We are not the adversary.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; We there to work with you.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; So that's why we're going to find out
[45:31] who the adversary.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Uh like I said, we working together.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask question, you answer.
[45:38] So you can move on.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; When God
[45:42] created heaven and earth, the Bible say
[45:45] that uh he create the angels. You know
[45:48] all that.
[45:52] Uh I don't know if you read that but
[45:54] sometime I read the Bible but I never
[45:56] see where somewhere where the Lord says
[45:59] God created a devil. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; The word of God say that
[46:04] &gt;&gt; God created a devil
[46:06] &gt;&gt; or Satan.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; No, let's from the word of world see
[46:10] where on the Bible
[46:13] the adversary began because he had to
[46:15] have an origin somewhere.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; All the angels that created were
[46:20] perfect, were great, come to humanity
[46:23] first, second day, on the sixth day,
[46:25] everything was good.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible say God create a
[46:29] devil.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Wicked demon. He never say that. But
[46:35] &gt;&gt; where did it come from?
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Where that devil come from?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; So let's uh let's go to let's go to
[46:45] Ezekiel 28.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Let's run out that first.
[46:53] Ezekiel 28. So you're going to read with
[46:56] me also.
[46:58] Uh
[47:00] I don't know if they can project it for
[47:01] us. I don't know how this works. But to
[47:04] make it eases,
[47:06] Ezekiel 28:12
[47:13] &gt;&gt; uh what do you want to say with that?
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. Yeah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:27] All right. You all follow with me. Son
[47:29] of man, take up the lamentation upon the
[47:33] king of Tyrus. But say that when the
[47:37] prophet was talking about that king,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; it wasn't the man you see physically,
[47:43] &gt;&gt; it was the spirit,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; the spirit of that man.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; It was talking. It says verse 13. No,
[47:51] no. Thus say the Lord God that seal us
[47:56] all the full of wisdom and perfect in
[48:00] beauty.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; That angel was perfect in beauty.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; He says that uh verse 13 that has been
[48:09] in Eden the garden of God.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Nowhere we find Tyrus in Eden
[48:15] &gt;&gt; but we see the devil
[48:17] &gt;&gt; and the serpent.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We see that. So when God create that
[48:22] earth that being he wasn't like um many
[48:27] time you saw a picture with a long tail
[48:31] &gt;&gt; frogs make you afraid of the no the
[48:35] death frog
[48:35] &gt;&gt; it's not that ugly
[48:37] &gt;&gt; the B say it was a beauty
[48:40] &gt;&gt; beauty itself
[48:41] &gt;&gt; so don't to attract people distraction
[48:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[48:46] &gt;&gt; but when he create that
[48:49] He wasn't called the devil.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; No, he was called the devil. Now,
[48:55] how can become the devil?
[48:57] &gt;&gt; How can we become the devil?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you uh with the
[49:00] message in the Bible that Abraham said,
[49:04] uh let's go to Isaiah 14.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Uh we see that beauty in that angel, he
[49:13] was perfect in beauty. It wasn't like
[49:16] ugly like sometime we ping the devil
[49:19] ugliest person. No, it was beauty
[49:22] perfection in that angel.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; But now what happened?
[49:28] I come from that position. He came down
[49:30] on earth.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Now let's go to Isaiah 14.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14. We're going to see something.
[49:38] Follow with me. We all going to be in
[49:39] the same page together. Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[49:43] Uh Isaiah 14.
[49:46] Uh
[49:48] okay,
[49:50] let's go way to to verse 12.
[49:54] How are
[49:56] the fallen from heaven? Oh, Lucifer.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Lucifer.
[50:02] The reason you see that King James use
[50:05] the word Lucifer in the other version,
[50:08] they use the morning star, the boy
[50:11] morning star. They don't use Lucifer
[50:13] because
[50:15] the Bible when there was first
[50:17] translated from uh Hebrews
[50:20] &gt;&gt; there was uh and in Latin
[50:23] &gt;&gt; the Latin. So they use the word Lucifer
[50:27] that mean looks mean light fur mean bear
[50:31] I mean light bear lightbear Lucifer.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So that mean they keep that word Lucifer
[50:38] &gt;&gt; from that version and they use it. So
[50:41] that mean that angel was the angel of
[50:45] light.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; He was perfect.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; He wasn't the devil like oh no.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; So
[50:54] &gt;&gt; and also the prophet says uh let me see
[50:57] in adoption
[50:59] uh everything every angel God created
[51:03] them with the free will.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; They have the choice
[51:08] &gt;&gt; to choose. Now let's see in adoption
[51:10] what he says that Lucifer had the same
[51:12] choice.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; That's why he come from heaven and down
[51:16] on earth the human being when he create
[51:19] Adam and Eve he give him the same right.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; You have perfect freedom. I mean I mean
[51:25] uh uh free will you can choose right
[51:28] wrong whatever you want.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Same thing as Lucifer and the angels.
[51:32] They have a right to choose.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; God didn't force them to worship force
[51:37] them. No, no, no. You have a right.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Same thing for our believers.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; We have a right this morning.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; If you want to worship, fine. If you
[51:45] don't want to worship, just watch. Hey,
[51:46] watch.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; But you have a right.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; You can do whatever you want. But you
[51:52] know that there's some beings created to
[51:54] worship the Lord. We worship
[51:57] &gt;&gt; because we are worshiper. We don't come
[52:00] to watch and see what's going on. No,
[52:01] no. We don't come to watch. We're not
[52:03] spying nobody. No, no. We come to
[52:05] worship the Lord. Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; No, you don't do that. Spying people or
[52:10] I saw you you wasn't what worship the
[52:13] Lord.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; What were you doing? Take your time
[52:16] watching somebody.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Watching somebody not praising the Lord.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you came to to the church for
[52:23] &gt;&gt; watching people.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Come on. You wasting your
[52:27] time.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to watch what people
[52:31] do. I've come to worship my Lord. Sing
[52:34] to the Lord. Now let's go to uh adoption
[52:38] uh 60518
[52:41] uh adoption 2 paragraph 84ise.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, you're going to see that they have
[52:49] uh uh
[52:52] the same
[52:56] uh free will that we have today to
[52:58] choose. Satan has that also.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. belly me a bit because I'm not too
[53:05] text
[53:07] [Laughter]
[53:09] but sometime okay that's 1960518
[53:15] paragraph 84
[53:18] uh we're going to see that together and
[53:21] I will show you where the prophecies
[53:23] devil also I mean I mean Lucifer he has
[53:27] a right to choose right and wrongowmen
[53:31] That's every human be at the same right
[53:33] also
[53:35] &gt;&gt; paragraph 84. Let me find exactly what I
[53:37] want to go. Uh
[53:42] okay. If you go down to
[53:46] that code, what the prophet say that God
[53:52] at the beginning
[53:54] before the angel was even made
[54:00] going down. It says that Lucifer
[54:05] no before that. Okay.
[54:08] God infinite mercy. He saw that Lucifer
[54:12] would do that if he created this. He'd
[54:17] put them onto a free moral agency. That
[54:21] basis
[54:22] &gt;&gt; and you still there. That's right. The
[54:25] tree of right and wrong said before
[54:27] every one of you. Of course, you make
[54:30] your choice that come on earth to Adam
[54:32] and Eve. Lucifer was the first one to
[54:37] take the wrong word.
[54:40] was the first one.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; He had a choice. He see this is my
[54:45] choice. He use it but it take the wrong
[54:48] word.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And uh but let's go back to the Bible to
[54:54] see what he did
[54:57] that that being Lucifer was never called
[55:01] the devil. He called the light angel of
[55:05] light. But how can you become Lucifer?
[55:08] to kick him out and we find out that
[55:11] let's go to back again to
[55:14] Isaiah 14
[55:17] was called Lucifer verse 12 or Lucifer
[55:21] then had cut down to the ground which
[55:25] did weaken the nations but back in
[55:28] Ezekiel
[55:30] uh 28 the Bible said that he was in
[55:33] heaven until there find iniquity
[55:38] iniquity
[55:40] that sin that kick him out. But now
[55:44] Isaiah going to explain exactly what he
[55:46] did that the reason that God put him
[55:48] down. Let's go to verse 14. No, verse
[55:52] 13.
[55:54] Oh Lucifer
[55:57] 13. For thou said in thy heart, this is
[56:01] the problem now. for the harsh enter.
[56:04] I will ascend into heaven.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; We don't find five things he said that
[56:11] kick him out. Only that for me. First
[56:13] thing, I will ascend
[56:16] into heaven. That's one. Second, I will
[56:20] exalt my throne above the stars of God.
[56:24] Three, I will sit
[56:27] also upon the mount of the congregation
[56:30] in the side of the north.
[56:33] Verse 14, I will ascend above the high
[56:37] of the cloud. That mean four, I will be
[56:41] like the most high
[56:45] yet that shall be brought down. yet that
[56:48] shall be brought down to hell
[56:51] &gt;&gt; to the side of the pit.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Glory
[56:56] sir.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That's why they put kick Lucifer out.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He was there as the angel but now he
[57:05] became so proud.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; See now we are a high kingdom. He start
[57:12] making uh recruitment in in heaven.
[57:14] Angel. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Same thing you see sometime in church.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody got a little revelation.
[57:23] Got a funny revelation. Find somebody
[57:25] doors on the side. Talk to them
[57:27] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden recruiting
[57:31] recruiting in the church. But
[57:34] &gt;&gt; this is what happened after recruiting
[57:37] all the angel. I mean most of the angel
[57:39] with him. The Bible say oneird. But now
[57:44] God say well you cannot stay in heaven
[57:47] but you got to go down. He said me and
[57:51] no way I'm not going. No way.
[57:56] Call his angel say where going to fight
[57:58] today. I mean they call some you know
[58:01] when you live in the house they ask you
[58:04] you don't pay your rent you have to kick
[58:06] out call for eviction. You said no I'm
[58:08] going nowhere. The shave has to come to
[58:11] bring everything outside,
[58:13] &gt;&gt; kick everything out.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; What happened to Lucifer?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to leave.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Nowhere. Stay there. I said, "No
[58:21] problem. Let's find to uh uh go to uh
[58:26] Revelation chapter 12. See how they kick
[58:28] him out from heaven."
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to leave. He said, "No,
[58:31] I'm going nowhere.
[58:35] I will stay there.
[58:38] I tried to overthrown the kingdom of God
[58:41] to make my own kingdom.
[58:44] Want to be a kud in heaven.
[58:49] Yes. In uh Revelation 12.
[58:54] Uh
[58:57] let's read verse three.
[59:00] And there appeared another wonder in
[59:02] heaven, and behold, a great white dragon
[59:05] having seven heads and 10 horns, seven
[59:08] crowns upon his head. So, we're not
[59:11] going to talk about that. Let's verse
[59:12] three. And his tail drew the third part
[59:16] of the stars of heaven, and it cast them
[59:19] to the earth. And the dragon stood
[59:22] before the woman, which was ready to be
[59:24] delivered for to devour her child as
[59:27] soon as it was born.
[59:29] going to skip that. Go to
[59:34] verse
[59:36] uh
[59:38] uh verse uh 7.
[59:43] There was war in heaven. Can you imagine
[59:46] that?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; In heaven there's war in heaven. But
[59:52] &gt;&gt; who
[59:53] who was in charge of do the party? war
[59:58] in heaven.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Michael and his angel fought against the
[1:00:03] dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:00:05] angel.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Lucifer say I'm going nowhere. Nobody
[1:00:09] can kick me out.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to find out. Michael army
[1:00:14] soldier. He said you leaving.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; You got to leave.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Say no.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not leaving. Frightening.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible say yes. No. No. They fight.
[1:00:26] Yes, sir.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, they use trust him.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever they use them
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; to kick him out.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Uh, Michael fought against the dragon.
[1:00:39] Dragon fought and his angel and
[1:00:42] prevailed. Lord, see that you're not
[1:00:45] stronger. Satan,
[1:00:48] he been defeated in heaven.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Preven. Neither was their place found
[1:00:54] anymore in heaven.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And the great dragon was cast out that
[1:00:59] all certain certain called the devil and
[1:01:03] Satan. That's why he got his name.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; When he was in the rebellion against
[1:01:08] God, they kick him out. You Satan, you
[1:01:11] the devil.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; But before he was Lucifer,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; they lied. But now since you are uh uh
[1:01:22] conceive iniquity in your heart,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; you rebel against God, you rebellion,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; you a devil.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You're a Satan.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But you rebellion.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's why brother and sister, if you're
[1:01:36] in rebellion with God, you sat with the
[1:01:39] devil. Yeah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Rebellion.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Rebellion with God.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And uh from now on
[1:01:47] he give this name of Satan the devil.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; But in the beginning it wasn't Satan. It
[1:01:54] was Lucifer
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; the lie.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; But now it was a kick from heaven. He
[1:02:00] came down on earth. He says now war onto
[1:02:04] earth.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wage war now against earth.
[1:02:09] Because when he knew that God has some
[1:02:10] creature on earth, he said, "Well, even
[1:02:14] angel I fought with them in heaven." How
[1:02:16] about human beings?
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; It going to be easy.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; He thought it going to be easy. It could
[1:02:22] be easy.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; See, therefore, the purpose that he has
[1:02:26] in heaven, he doesn't fully uh
[1:02:29] accomplish that. He said, "Now on earth,
[1:02:32] I'm going to find some subject."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I have my kingdom too.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Wow. I cannot have the kingdom upstairs,
[1:02:39] but now on earth
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; can have my kingdom.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; there be war.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Fight.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; God in heaven and Satan on earth.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He say I establish my kingdom.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Two power.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Every one of them are recruiting. God
[1:02:59] want people to follow him. Satan also
[1:03:01] want people to follow.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; So what Satan use? He use tactic. He use
[1:03:09] rules. He use any kind of um of of trick
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; right
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; to get you started.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ come
[1:03:21] take the form of a man
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; to fight the devil.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You know that Calvary, he beat the devil
[1:03:30] at Calvary. Right.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Go down and under the earth.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Beat him again.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Swimming everywhere from heaven, earth
[1:03:39] down.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Victory all over.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Victory all over.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:03:49] Satan say, "Huh?
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm not done yet."
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not done yet.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Because remember, Satan is spirit.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:00] You come and the body of flesh.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; So that mean that the reason Paul say
[1:04:06] we're not fighting against blood and
[1:04:08] flesh.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; We wrestle against spirit.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; In heavenly places.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; So that's why Peter said be sober,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; be vigilant,
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; your adversary with the devil.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; But imagine that with your flesh you can
[1:04:24] fight the devil. Say no.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; No. What the Lord did, he became man,
[1:04:31] human. But inside that man dwell the
[1:04:36] fullness of the spirit of God.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the spirit of God.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; When Satan thought, I'm going to hit
[1:04:43] that man. He didn't know he was God in
[1:04:45] flesh.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; He didn't know he was God in flesh.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; God says, Satan, I got something more um
[1:04:54] to to to hit you back because I'm not
[1:04:57] done with you. That's right.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not done with you.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going but I coming back.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; How you going to come back? Watch say
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; he tell he's coming back.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; But what he did at Pentecost, he came
[1:05:09] back in the form of the pill of fire,
[1:05:12] the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And that the reason today, brother and
[1:05:17] sister,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; you cannot fight that battle with your
[1:05:22] blood and flesh with the physical part.
[1:05:24] That's why the prophet says that you
[1:05:26] have to get the Holy Ghost in your life.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you already lost the battle.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; But now to be an overcomer,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; to be an overcomer,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; you got to get receive something.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dr. Theresa Paul I mean Peter said
[1:05:43] in second Peter 2
[1:05:47] Peter chapter 1 verse
[1:05:52] 2 Peter chapter 1:3
[1:05:59] Peter said according to his divine power
[1:06:04] at giving unto us
[1:06:07] all things that pertaining unto to life
[1:06:11] and godliness to the knowledge of him
[1:06:15] that had called us to glory and virtue.
[1:06:17] In other words, the battle is not yours
[1:06:21] is the Lord. But everything you you you
[1:06:24] need, God already gave it to you.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; in you. That's why don't when you go and
[1:06:34] full of something you don't have to
[1:06:36] worry we all what I'm going to do just
[1:06:39] depend on the Lord
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; because without me you can do nothing
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; right where I've been I raising the
[1:06:45] message I know what the prophet says all
[1:06:48] the quotes you fight battle you already
[1:06:52] be defeated
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; all the way
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; let the Holy Spirit come
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; and now
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; according as his divine power has given
[1:07:02] us all things. Verse four, whereby
[1:07:07] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:07:10] precious promise
[1:07:12] that by this you might be partakers.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You're not assistant you partakers
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; of the divine
[1:07:21] nature.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:07:24] the world to los. So since we have an
[1:07:29] enemy the de devil at the beginning he
[1:07:32] wasn't called the devil like you know
[1:07:35] that he was Lucifer but because he sin
[1:07:39] God said not not only he sin he say oh
[1:07:42] God I'm sorry I pray no he fight against
[1:07:45] I'm not going nowhere
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; have you ever seen that when somebody
[1:07:49] doing wrong try to go to talk to that
[1:07:52] person he become a rebellious
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; fight with you the When your body in
[1:07:57] sin, don't approach him like that.
[1:08:01] He might kick you back. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[1:08:04] Yeah. You anointed with the spirit of
[1:08:06] the devil. The same thing in heaven.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Don't tell me that. No, no,
[1:08:14] no. That's the reason when you're born

[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Try to reconcile your brother.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; He's not listening to you. Don't fight
[1:08:23] with him. Get the brother one or two. in
[1:08:26] love. Go talk to them. If he doesn't,
[1:08:29] bring it to the church. That's it.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to f post him on

[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Even God imagine and and Cain when he
[1:09:12] killed Abel the Lord said
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; where's that brother?
[1:09:18] My brother keeper

[1:10:18] because if you're there. But when you're
[1:10:21] front of that situation, how are you
[1:10:24] going to defend?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Not what to overcome, but how to
[1:10:31] overcome.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Remember that David when the king uh
[1:10:37] they burn to the king is the enemy,
[1:10:41] David in his mind said, "Boy, they're
[1:10:43] going to kill me today." What he did? He
[1:10:45] played like he's a fool. He prayed like
[1:10:48] he's incin
[1:10:54] see that he know how to go overcome.
[1:10:57] He's not going to pray the Lord say Lord
[1:10:59] help me out. No no no no. He use he
[1:11:01] deser say if I do that that will kill
[1:11:04] me. He pray like he's squeezing.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; What did they say? Ah, this
[1:11:18] I got you.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I got you.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Got you.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; How to overcome,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; not what to overcome.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:43] Lord, we all together. Are we?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let's move forward. Now,
[1:11:49] he wasn't calling the devil. He wasn't
[1:11:51] called Satan. But what he did give him
[1:11:55] that name.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; That the reason when he's uh doing uh
[1:12:02] the series on demonology, he said that
[1:12:05] the a demon is a tormentor.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; A tormentor.
[1:12:11] That the reason when you brother you
[1:12:13] torment your brother and sister you a
[1:12:15] devil demon.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; What it is is a tormentor.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; You create problem for your brother and
[1:12:22] sister.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You just always turn at your brother and
[1:12:24] sister. No. No. Leave me alone.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; There's something bad. God will take
[1:12:28] care of that.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; All you have to do pray for your brother
[1:12:31] and sisters.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Do the step of Matthew 18. Go to him
[1:12:36] first or her first.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Just listen to you. Take two three.
[1:12:39] That's all. Yes. Yes. Yes sir.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; All the time negative. But now it's
[1:12:43] worse.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong, it be posted
[1:12:46] online. Posted
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; on social media.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So the whole world can see that boy is a
[1:12:53] bad boy. The sister is a evil person.
[1:12:56] Why you do that?
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Why you do that?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; So we have to be vigilant.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; We have to be careful. what you do.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Because the devil is working.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; I mean is is world on this earth.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Seeking who you might devour.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; But remember that the devil not looking
[1:13:23] after denominational. No no the bride.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Because you know that you know who you
[1:13:28] are.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; You're not the f of the devil. You can't
[1:13:34] do nothing to you unless you open
[1:13:36] yourself. As the prophet said,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit
[1:13:41] is covered the earth. He can't do
[1:13:44] nothing unless he find a body.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Spirit find a body, he can
[1:13:50] work through that body.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; The same thing too, the devil looking
[1:13:53] for body.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; When he find that body, he going to work
[1:13:56] through that body. Right.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And uh I was uh doing a study for the
[1:14:03] young people in the church and I tell
[1:14:05] them then that the age that we now is
[1:14:10] compared to the time of the judges. So
[1:14:13] when the children of Israel left
[1:14:16] the Lord says let's let's read that in
[1:14:19] second Judges 2 verse 10.
[1:14:24] Judges chapter 2 verse 10 because
[1:14:30] the devil is not um a new devil is old.
[1:14:39] Excuse me. Judges chapter 2
[1:14:45] verse.
[1:14:47] And also all the generation were
[1:14:50] gathered unto their fathers, and there a
[1:14:53] wars in the generation after them, which
[1:14:58] knew not the Lord, not yet the work
[1:15:01] which he had done for Israel.
[1:15:04] I was telling the young people, I said,
[1:15:06] I will be on time.
[1:15:10] Uh
[1:15:12] young generation of my time. We used to
[1:15:14] go to all the kept meeting there. He
[1:15:16] there we fire. Yes.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Kept meeting driving 8 hours, 10 hours
[1:15:24] driving back and forth. Yeah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, I saw you over there. I saw
[1:15:28] over there. Yeah.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was back that time. Right.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But now,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; but now
[1:15:38] you see that.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And um look at what what the Lord says
[1:15:46] the same chapter 2
[1:15:50] verse
[1:15:51] 19. And it came to pass
[1:15:55] when the judge was dead that they
[1:15:58] returned and corrupted themselves more
[1:16:00] than their father and following all the
[1:16:03] gods to serve them and to bow down unto
[1:16:06] them. They cease not from their undoing
[1:16:10] nor from the stubborn way.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And the anger of the Lord was heart
[1:16:15] against Israel. And he said, "Cause that
[1:16:18] these people had transgresses my
[1:16:20] covenant which I commanded their father
[1:16:23] and have not hearkened unto my voice, I
[1:16:26] also will not henceforth drive out any
[1:16:30] from before them of the nation which
[1:16:33] Joshua left when he died." So that mean
[1:16:36] the Lord tell him there is seven nations
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I left.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I left the seven nation but I give you
[1:16:43] the land.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. But I left. Imagine somebody stay
[1:16:48] in the house or the Lord tell them to
[1:16:50] kick you out to take your house. You
[1:16:52] think you know stay like that watching
[1:16:54] you. But the Lord tell them the Lord
[1:16:56] tell them the Cananan the Hites the
[1:17:00] Jubicide all this pagan
[1:17:03] kick them out take their land their
[1:17:06] position. Right. Right.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; You know that okay now I'm leaving easy.
[1:17:11] He said no they're going to fight
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; to kick them out
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; those nation. So at the time of Joshua
[1:17:20] the Lord didn't put every everybody out.
[1:17:23] He left a number of nation. What what it
[1:17:27] say? It says that chapter 3 now verse
[1:17:31] one. These are the nation which the Lord
[1:17:34] left to poor Israel by them even as many
[1:17:38] of Israel had not known all the wars of
[1:17:42] Kenyan only that the generation of the
[1:17:45] children of Israel might know to teach
[1:17:48] them war.
[1:17:51] In this end time we live in there are
[1:17:54] certain thing that the Lord lived that
[1:17:57] purposely
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; for the young generation.
[1:18:02] to have their own experience with the
[1:18:04] message
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; because remember that you have to go
[1:18:08] fight all the way in the convention keep
[1:18:11] meeting but now he send you your devil
[1:18:17] I'm only in the middle a few of them
[1:18:21] I remember back in the um 70s used to be
[1:18:25] uh uh
[1:18:28] see uh hippie Afro and the bell papa
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; bell baba. Everybody walking to that
[1:18:37] platform.
[1:18:39] Everybody have speaking in the pocket.
[1:18:42] Wow.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; But now that was a demon of time.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But now everything changed.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Everything changed. Yes sir.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And I was telling the the young people I
[1:18:55] back then uh it was a no cell phone. the
[1:18:59] whole uh landline you have to
[1:19:04] all you know young people know nothing
[1:19:07] about that.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see what they call you in the
[1:19:13] year you have to one I miss that call.
[1:19:16] There's no way to find who called you.
[1:19:20] There's no way to find who called you.
[1:19:23] But sometimes you have to wait by the
[1:19:24] first how they going to call back the
[1:19:26] second time. No they call back. You go
[1:19:27] back. Oh,
[1:19:30] I miss it again.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; I miss it again. That was our time.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; But now,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; you can be anywhere. Your phone, you
[1:19:38] know who call you. Okay, I call you
[1:19:40] back,
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, technology,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; but that should make us closer to God.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Uh said and this time he was wrong to go
[1:19:56] to the movie to uh uh
[1:20:00] that was wrong.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He said well the devil bring it in the
[1:20:06] house by TV but not is worse than TV.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You put the hand of palm your hand
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; the phone.
[1:20:17] You have to go to a movie. You can have
[1:20:19] your own movie at home.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Anywhere you go, you can watch whatever
[1:20:23] you want to to that.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Now that you're on demon, you have to
[1:20:28] fight. Now
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; you have to fight.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I I told young people there was a time I
[1:20:36] mean they call me all the gay people was
[1:20:39] in the closet. They come in the closet.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; It was wrong to say loudly I'm gay. I'm
[1:20:46] this. It was wrong.
[1:20:48] You have to be brave enough to say that
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; nally.
[1:20:52] But now with time with time,
[1:20:57] I will listen to uh a song
[1:21:01] was doing the group of LGBT in uh uh San
[1:21:05] Francisco. They make a song. I want to
[1:21:08] convert your children.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I'm after them.
[1:21:18] I make them tolerant
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; and make them I mean fair
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; why because the doctrine they have they
[1:21:27] taught us we uh that Christian we hate
[1:21:32] them we don't like them
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; so what they say they try to teach the
[1:21:36] young people don't be hateful
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; love us the Bible say love your neighbor
[1:21:42] you
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; but there is something beh behind that
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; behind something. There is something
[1:21:49] behind that. Now imagine in school uh
[1:21:53] you send your your kid to school, but
[1:21:55] now they're not for this. Well, I'm gay.
[1:21:57] I'm lesbian. Even this message,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; the demon demon on this earth now scared
[1:22:05] no church.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Scared no church.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Mr. Church, they enter the messages.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Wow. That's the truth.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; That's why I have to be vigilant brother
[1:22:16] and sister to be under God all the time
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; because that spirit is there
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; right
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; spirit is there.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I was telling my young brother and
[1:22:24] sister. I said well uh so there's a
[1:22:28] limit. But if you there
[1:22:31] talk to the sister don't say all the
[1:22:33] time men no come on show me that you a
[1:22:36] man.
[1:22:39] I
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:43] don't see
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:51] [Laughter]
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; I see that I don't see to be a butterfly
[1:22:57] or no I don't see that but at least show
[1:23:00] me your man talk to your sister
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; he there 25 30 about to 40 here working,
[1:23:09] got a good job. Say, "Hey, what's going
[1:23:11] on?
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:13] What's going on?
[1:23:18] What is going on?" No, no, no, no, no. I
[1:23:20] have to watch your spirit because I
[1:23:23] don't say to do wrong thing, but do the
[1:23:25] right things. Yes. It's time for you to
[1:23:27] get married. You got a sister.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Sister, don't sit there all the time
[1:23:31] popping your muscle. Just
[1:23:35] that's all you do. No. No. No. No, no,
[1:23:38] no, no. Glory.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Come tell them. Yes.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; We see that spirit
[1:23:47] um and this end time take different
[1:23:49] forms.
[1:23:51] You see this different form and now with
[1:23:53] the gay community now they open now.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I was telling the church I said you know
[1:23:58] what they do they're so brave they use
[1:24:01] the rainbow as their sign.
[1:24:05] But we know that spirit because they
[1:24:08] call their same pride.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; We know pride was in heaven. That demon
[1:24:12] it was cast down to earth.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; When I see that I said that the that
[1:24:17] Lucifer, that Satan, the devil that
[1:24:20] encountered those uh flesh, they call
[1:24:23] them pride.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That was the spirit of pride that kick
[1:24:28] lucifer out from heaven.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; And now you come on earth now establish
[1:24:33] kingdom. They have they burn they
[1:24:35] flooded they say pride
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; they're not ashamed because I'm pride
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; but you know our prophet Jesus pride
[1:24:45] from the devil
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; say humble humility
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Christian has to be humble not pride do
[1:24:52] something no humble
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; humble yourself before
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; before before the Lord
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; now we see that
[1:25:02] the Lord left uh Because demon in every
[1:25:06] generation
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; even on our time we are to fight the
[1:25:10] young people also
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; they have the demon the devil to fight.
[1:25:15] I was telling this I said that's the
[1:25:17] reason sometime
[1:25:19] you don't know what it your kids going
[1:25:21] through going to school
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; they facing the demon
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; they facing the demon I said that's
[1:25:28] important to talk to them
[1:25:32] I said how you feel brother and sister
[1:25:35] if you find out your your son or
[1:25:38] daughters
[1:25:40] has come orientation for different
[1:25:45] for same sex
[1:25:47] for how you feel about that. Are you
[1:25:49] going to call so and so? Everybody to
[1:25:52] tell them well I be careful
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; have to be careful
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; because is a spirit. We are dealing with
[1:26:00] spirit.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; If we deal with spirit you have to know
[1:26:03] the right way to approach that.
[1:26:05] Otherwise we do more damage then we
[1:26:07] bring
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; more damage. Amen sir.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Even in our church if you know a bother
[1:26:15] sometime just working
[1:26:20] call him to the side. Talk to that
[1:26:22] person. Don't expose him. Don't expose
[1:26:25] them. Especially a minister don't expose
[1:26:28] him on the pulpit. No no no. Call on to
[1:26:32] the side. Sisters you see them have the
[1:26:35] wrong orientation. Call them to the
[1:26:37] side. talk to them because we are
[1:26:39] dealing with spirit.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; You are dealing with spirit
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; not that person.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; That person is a good person.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Sometime they use the scripture and the
[1:26:52] wrong way.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Christian the wrong way. You see that
[1:26:56] they all hate us. We are Christian of
[1:26:59] God. The Bible say to love everybody.
[1:27:03] But we love you but you don't love what
[1:27:05] you did wrong. We have to call right,
[1:27:08] right, wrong, wrong.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, we compromising our rights.
[1:27:12] No, we not compromising with no
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; we love you. We have to tell you the
[1:27:16] truth.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; We're not going to force you to change.
[1:27:20] No, no, no. We tell you the truth.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Then we find that the devil has the free
[1:27:27] will.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; He has a choice.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But he use that to be against God.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; You see, I will raise my throne. I will
[1:27:35] raise my kingdom. I will do this, do
[1:27:38] that.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I
[1:27:40] thought you was an obedient angel, but
[1:27:42] now you rebel against me now. You're
[1:27:44] going down."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; The worst thing is they I'm not going
[1:27:47] nowhere. I said, "What?" He said, "No,
[1:27:51] we had to fight me to kick me out."
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. Call Michael. Call
[1:27:57] Michael. Michael, come. They said they
[1:28:00] fried. They fried. It wasn't easy.
[1:28:02] Remember, it wasn't easy.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy. It was a war. Wow.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Finally with a kicking man. Okay, don't
[1:28:09] worry. But woman to the earth. I'm
[1:28:11] coming down. I'm coming down.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Your people downstairs should be ready.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Like what? God come and the human body.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Angel the devil
[1:28:23] their battle ra going to be rushing
[1:28:26] because
[1:28:28] you're not going to see them are going
[1:28:30] to be inside them. people
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; are going to be inside dwelling inside
[1:28:35] them like the reason brother and sister
[1:28:37] I told the church respect anyone
[1:28:41] might not agree with somebody but
[1:28:43] respect that person because God dwell in
[1:28:46] human being now
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; the holy spirit
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; you might take wrong about the person
[1:28:52] then it was the holy spirit and that
[1:28:54] person even though they do some mis
[1:28:58] respect that because nobody you not say
[1:29:02] because you want the message. That's
[1:29:04] wrong.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I'm the message. I'm saved. No. What you
[1:29:07] want to do there?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I baptized because the message. No, no,
[1:29:11] no. You say because God by for knowledge
[1:29:15] before the foundation of the world, he
[1:29:17] know you. You were predestinated for
[1:29:19] that.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Not because you baptized your mom, your
[1:29:24] dad was in the message. Oh, I'm born. I
[1:29:27] told young people I'm born in the
[1:29:28] message. There's nobody in the message.
[1:29:30] Nobody.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Nobody is born in the message.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; We all has to go to the same experience.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; As your dad,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; We still got the same devil, the same
[1:29:43] demon.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; To fight.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; If you think that, oh, I'm not worried
[1:29:49] because hey, I'm a million. My dad is
[1:29:54] fighting the devil, but I'm not fighting
[1:29:55] the devil. No, no, no, no. We still
[1:29:58] fighting the same devil.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody is on different level.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; The kids at school, you at work,
[1:30:07] everywhere you go, you find the devil.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But like I said, not what to overcome,
[1:30:12] but how
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; how to overcome the devil.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; To overcome. Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; When we look at at at Paul and Acts,
[1:30:24] when Paul was preaching, there was a
[1:30:26] young uh woman was following Paul,
[1:30:28] calling Paul, "Oh, you the servant of
[1:30:30] God." But she didn't say anything wrong.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Physically, she said anything wrong.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; That was a demon. But after a while,
[1:30:38] they said Paul was tired of that spirit.
[1:30:40] You see, he cursed out that devil
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; and found out there was the devil, a
[1:30:45] python serpent spirit.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; You never know that.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; But he find out that that spirit is not
[1:30:52] the right spirit.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Even though he didn't she didn't say
[1:30:55] anything wrong to show that wrong
[1:30:58] spirit. But sometime you have to be
[1:30:59] careful
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; with what you let go. Be vigilant.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Be vigilant. But now
[1:31:09] be sober. The devil as a war lion.
[1:31:14] Sometime when you are watching
[1:31:16] documentary
[1:31:17] you never see a lion attack a group of
[1:31:21] buffalo in the front. No no no you go by
[1:31:25] back

[1:31:31] uh but mention that uh
[1:31:35] systematic well I'm going to single out
[1:31:37] I'm going to say I'm not going to have
[1:31:39] fellowship with nobody. I've been by
[1:31:41] myself. Oh yeah, you'll be by yourself.
[1:31:45] Uh, let's see that.
[1:31:50] Everybody say, "Yeah, you want to be by
[1:31:52] yourself?" Oh, that's good.
[1:31:55] Stay by yourself.

[1:32:21] attention because the devil know how to
[1:32:24] fight the bride that's why you think God
[1:32:28] we have a perfect messenger. Amen.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Given all the tactic overcome is to
[1:32:34] recognize the devil
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; in all his tact
[1:32:39] overcome.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:36:06] You see that uh you cannot do it because
[1:36:11] like I'm hungry but I never go to a
[1:36:14] table
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; just I never eat. I said I ain't going
[1:36:18] to do it. You got to go and feed on the
[1:36:22] word of God in fellowship with one with
[1:36:26] one in order.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; 172.
[1:36:30] See, we need one another more than we
[1:36:35] ever did need each other is now.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; We need one another now. When you get
[1:36:42] yourself sing out from the rest of them,
[1:36:46] make yourself just literally different.
[1:36:50] Why you want to be super Christian?
[1:36:55] Make yourself super Christian. Sometime
[1:36:57] you can see the message that the brother
[1:36:59] sisters
[1:37:00] they use the attitude separate themsel
[1:37:03] from all the crowd from the brother and
[1:37:05] sisters well I'm not going to take part
[1:37:09] with what they doing or I'm this no you
[1:37:12] nothing
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; with something by the grace of God
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; nobody saved by your own merit nothing
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; the Bible say you are saved by grace
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; if you go by merit I say well I'm saved
[1:37:27] because because of what?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; What have you done? Nothing
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; by grace.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Through faith
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So he says that when you get yourself
[1:37:38] single out from the rest of them, making
[1:37:41] yourself just a little different. You
[1:37:44] don't want to associate with them
[1:37:46] because they believe this and don't want
[1:37:48] to associate with that. You're getting
[1:37:51] on dangerous ground.
[1:37:55] getting on dangerous ground right then
[1:37:58] keeping away from church.
[1:38:02] Say well
[1:38:05] sometime notice in this end time
[1:38:08] um many time brother and sister pick and
[1:38:10] choose the day they want to come to
[1:38:12] church.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Pick and choose pick and choose the way
[1:38:18] they come to come to church.
[1:38:20] Today's prayer meeting and coming
[1:38:29] Bible study.
[1:38:31] Okay. I don't know. Sunday morning. Yes.
[1:38:34] If I stay home on Sunday, they might
[1:38:36] think I'm a pagan. So I have to show
[1:38:38] them I'm Christian. Hey,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; you better stay home. You better stay
[1:38:41] home.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Better stay home. For a sister, you
[1:38:45] don't come to show us that you
[1:38:46] Christian. Right.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; you don't show nobody nothing because
[1:38:50] you're Christian. I will come to church
[1:38:53] so I can tell them I'm a Christian. I
[1:38:55] can worship. You're bluffing yourself.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Be be will be be will.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; This is uh
[1:39:07] uh keep you from church.
[1:39:10] Find the one of your choice. Yes. and
[1:39:13] remain there and be a Christian border
[1:39:16] to all of them. That's the way to be a
[1:39:19] real Christian. Then we got fellowship
[1:39:23] protection. That the word we got
[1:39:25] fellowship protection.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; When we together, we got a protection.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because as we together,
[1:39:36] somebody say, you know, brother John,
[1:39:38] I'm having some problem. The church know
[1:39:40] about that. Everybody be praying for
[1:39:41] you. They call you the protection.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; You are protected.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; By the prayer of the sin.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; But you single out.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; They call you. I I'm fine. Close. Close.
[1:39:54] I'm fine. Don't call me. I'm fine.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; I'm fine. Don't call me.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I'm fine.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Protection.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; People love you and pray for you.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we have fellowship.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; That's why our fellowship.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. By fellowshipping we know each
[1:40:13] other more because sometime somebody by
[1:40:16] going through something because you
[1:40:18] never have fellowship explain why so and
[1:40:21] so never come to church on Sunday on
[1:40:24] Tuesday or Wednesday Thursday why by
[1:40:27] talking to that person you might find
[1:40:28] out there's a problem going on you know
[1:40:30] why I don't have gas money
[1:40:33] [Laughter]
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; the money I have I used to go to work
[1:40:39] but I can't come You understand that?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Because we are at the same level of
[1:40:44] faith because myself I tell the church
[1:40:49] um I usually tell I said the Lord if you
[1:40:51] give me money to go to church give me
[1:40:53] money to come back because I'm not going
[1:40:55] to stuck on the word. No otherwise I'm
[1:40:58] not coming.
[1:41:00] I said Lord I'm not coming.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Sure I'm not. I said I believe it. I
[1:41:06] said I'm not coming. Well, it gives the
[1:41:09] money to go to come back. I said, "Oh
[1:41:11] Lord, thank you. Thank you." If I have
[1:41:14] to go to bank to put some money, I do
[1:41:16] it.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; I going to say I got no money when I
[1:41:18] have money in the bank. That line is
[1:41:20] Joseph.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Christian be.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; You got money in the I have no nothing
[1:41:25] to put gas in my car. What you going to
[1:41:28] do?
[1:41:30] You going to leave it for who? When you
[1:41:31] die, when you pass away,
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; the Bible say that.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Who you going that for? Right.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Everything you have, use
[1:41:39] it for the kingdom of God.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Use it.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, gas money should not be
[1:41:46] impediment for a Christian that come to
[1:41:48] church. No,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; go use your card. But sometime you use
[1:41:51] your cash for for for things that
[1:41:53] nonsense.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amazon all the time. Amazon all the
[1:41:56] time. F this all the
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; for no reason.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Save something to put gas in your car to
[1:42:02] come to church.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; 173 that the success of my meeting is
[1:42:10] because will godly people pray for me.
[1:42:15] Uh I'm going to show you something
[1:42:18] when I come in and introduce this thing
[1:42:20] about the vision thing. There's a many
[1:42:23] our mother and dad, sister and brother
[1:42:27] sitting out there that believe that with
[1:42:31] all their hearts, the Holy Spirit
[1:42:33] dropped right down on them. If they
[1:42:36] didn't do that, I have no way of doing
[1:42:38] it. No matter how great it would be for
[1:42:41] myself, he had to be for you the same.
[1:42:44] We have to be a unit, two of us together
[1:42:47] to make the contact with God. You as
[1:42:50] believer in myself. So that mean you
[1:42:54] don't there to just to assist. You're
[1:42:57] partic
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; for the ministers.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you why God give you
[1:43:08] the Holy Spirit. Sometime I told brother
[1:43:11] and sister you the way you you worship
[1:43:14] the Lord, you think that the Lord give
[1:43:16] you the Holy Spirit just to come to
[1:43:17] church only.
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:19] [Laughter]
[1:43:22] to come to church only. That's why God
[1:43:25] give you the Holy Spirit.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; That's the wrong idea. My B give you the
[1:43:30] Holy Spirit that come to church. Uh
[1:43:33] let's see the message called what the
[1:43:35] Holy Ghost for.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You give the Holy Ghost just to come to
[1:43:41] church. Come to church when you feel
[1:43:43] like coming. Everything fine, I'm
[1:43:45] coming. He went outside and I'm coming
[1:43:48] today.
[1:43:49] What kind of Christian is that?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; What kind of question is that? Okay. Uh
[1:43:58] 59 121 17. What was the Holy Ghost given
[1:44:02] for?
[1:44:05] Um
[1:44:08] okay. I will p of 29
[1:44:14] but
[1:44:16] uh
[1:44:18] okay let me see par of 30
[1:44:24] in the cool of the evening he would come
[1:44:26] down and commune with them and there he
[1:44:29] lost that fellowship because sin would
[1:44:32] you remember that said that before sin
[1:44:35] Lord would come down and talk to Adam
[1:44:37] and Eve but after um they sin I mean the
[1:44:43] mar from God they were blocked there was
[1:44:46] no communication between them and God
[1:44:48] there was separation
[1:44:50] so God what he did Adam Eve leave kick
[1:44:53] him out kicked him out God don't sin in
[1:44:57] his prison even in heaven he kicked the
[1:45:00] devil out on earth also uh Adam and Eve
[1:45:03] sin god leave the garden and leave it
[1:45:06] now
[1:45:08] But he give him protection. He kill a
[1:45:10] lamb and close them with that. He kill
[1:45:12] you in protection. But God always want
[1:45:15] to have communion fellowship with his
[1:45:17] people. He and then he was made flesh
[1:45:20] and dwell among us in order that he
[1:45:23] could come back again to men and live in
[1:45:27] man and restore man to still a communion
[1:45:31] with him again and give him back his
[1:45:34] god-given right. Yeah. is god-given
[1:45:37] right.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; That's your god-given right.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That the right to get in good health,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; right? To uh to raise your family, wife
[1:45:47] for your kids, God-given, eternal life.
[1:45:51] 21 31 That purpose of the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:56] the father again. God the Father
[1:46:00] dwelling in you working out his plan to
[1:46:04] finish his plan of redemption.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Even though Jesus
[1:46:09] Christ went on Calvar's cross, but they
[1:46:13] still got some sinners. We had to talk
[1:46:15] to them.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; We got to talk to them. Bring him back.
[1:46:18] We have to go after the Lord's soul. He
[1:46:21] says that continue
[1:46:23] though working through you making you a
[1:46:26] coworker with him. See that Satan at
[1:46:29] that job that position he was a coworker
[1:46:32] whatever said with God but he se kick
[1:46:34] him out but now you are a coworker with
[1:46:37] God.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; You partnership with God.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Giving you a place
[1:46:45] giving you a part for your fallen lost
[1:46:48] brother and sister. giving you his
[1:46:50] spirit and his love to go hunt the lost
[1:46:54] as he did in the garden of Eden. So you
[1:46:57] see that the Lord didn't give you the
[1:46:58] Holy Spirit just to come to church.
[1:47:00] Amen. No,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; you have a job to do.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; You got a job to do. Either brother and
[1:47:05] sister, you got a job to do.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Because many time the service come after
[1:47:11] the service. Well, sometime I ask
[1:47:14] brother and sisters, how about the
[1:47:16] service? Well, there was a good servant
[1:47:18] that's all.
[1:47:19] That was a good sermon that all I said
[1:47:23] what was saying in the sermon that you
[1:47:24] think that you are
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; taken from that but it was a good
[1:47:30] sermon.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; You defeated the purpose.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; When you come to church to find out what
[1:47:37] he did not talk to me
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; because when you come to church it's
[1:47:41] like you come to the courthouse.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Come to plead your case.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; The Lord say that you guilty on this,
[1:47:47] you guilty on that. Now I say oh lord oh
[1:47:50] lord yes I'm guilty what I have to do
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; one time he went to the church he
[1:47:57] preached he preached after there was a
[1:47:59] sister come he said praise the lord but
[1:48:02] he did touch me wow that sister I be
[1:48:05] close to the kingdom after she left he
[1:48:08] go tell me about that sister she the
[1:48:10] chief gossiper and the
[1:48:15] she the chief gossiper but that I you
[1:48:19] didn't talk about gossiping
[1:48:22] should have been you touch me brother
[1:48:24] I'm untouchable
[1:48:28] but no matter what you are God find
[1:48:30] something to touch your heart
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; to make you think about why I'm coming
[1:48:35] to church for because nowhere in the
[1:48:37] Bible you say we come to church to
[1:48:39] become worse no
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; better not best but better
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; better Christian, better neighbor,
[1:48:48] better better better come to church.
[1:48:51] Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; So that mean when you come to church
[1:48:54] because uh show that he says the the the
[1:48:58] the minister the prophet uh the preacher
[1:49:02] is a prophet in the old New Testament.
[1:49:04] Why? Sometime I was asking why because
[1:49:07] when the preacher is preaching many time
[1:49:09] they don't know nothing about your life
[1:49:12] but when he speak you say man but how
[1:49:15] you did somebody talk to you
[1:49:18] somebody tell you about my life you see
[1:49:20] that you go exactly
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; while going through that person life is
[1:49:23] a preacher
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; just a preacher because he got the gift
[1:49:27] of a prophet also when he's preaching to
[1:49:30] go exactly in your life do something
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; pray to you
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; so didn't even know what he's saying.
[1:49:36] But the Lord tell him to mention certain
[1:49:38] thing
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; that when you find out oh this man is is
[1:49:41] preaching on me I coming back again
[1:49:46] coming back again that show you that you
[1:49:49] rebellion with the word
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; the words when you come to church the
[1:49:54] Lord want to talk to you to change your
[1:49:56] attitude because he want you to be
[1:50:00] um as a service like he say that you are
[1:50:04] a partner working with him to work out
[1:50:07] this plan of redemption.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; You didn't just come to church just uh
[1:50:11] feel I have the Holy Ghost just tell the
[1:50:14] world where I have the Holy Ghost to do
[1:50:16] what?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost you here have do what?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Do what?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; All the believers they can lay hand on
[1:50:26] the sick all the Bible say this they
[1:50:30] follow you. You before they follow you
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; they're not in front of you. No they
[1:50:33] follow you. Right?
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And you come in, you can say to do that
[1:50:37] because you believe it. But now in this
[1:50:41] time that we live in, we see that this
[1:50:44] Satan, the devil, he's working away,
[1:50:47] making his way in heaven. He want to go
[1:50:51] take over control of the kingdom on
[1:50:54] heaven. But down on earth, he said, "Now
[1:50:57] I'm going to mess up your life, God.
[1:50:59] Your children, I'm going down to mess
[1:51:01] their life. I'm going to like like Jo
[1:51:04] I'm going to make him curse you.
[1:51:07] No, Lord said no. Never. I know who is
[1:51:11] job. He's my servant.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Because sometime you might be going
[1:51:14] through some test not even know it.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; The Lord purposely live that
[1:51:20] don't think anything happened. Oh, it's
[1:51:21] the devil. No, don't blame the devil for
[1:51:23] anything. Oh, it's the devil. No, don't
[1:51:26] blame the devil for anything. Because
[1:51:28] the Lord says why he enjoys he lives
[1:51:31] seven nation to test you.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Sometime in church you might think
[1:51:38] outside well it might be somebody inside
[1:51:41] the church.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody close to your brother and
[1:51:44] sister do something to you that you
[1:51:47] never imagined that will do that to you.
[1:51:49] Right.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Now we have the devil. We have now you
[1:51:54] know something stay with you and that
[1:51:56] person you going to be online everybody
[1:51:59] going to see that.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; When somebody had a disagreement with
[1:52:02] you they go whatever chat they have
[1:52:04] posted let the whole world know.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And there are some people discernment.
[1:52:09] They say hm there's something wrong with
[1:52:10] that person.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; They can leave in between the lines.
[1:52:14] They know that what you posted what you
[1:52:16] did there's something going on. What
[1:52:19] they going to do? They're going to magic
[1:52:20] something, change something. But then be
[1:52:23] careful what you post online.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you post because that
[1:52:27] the sound of distraction at this time.
[1:52:30] The devil wants to distract you from the
[1:52:32] real thing because the prophet says
[1:52:34] there the spirit of the last days. The
[1:52:38] spirit of the last days. Distraction
[1:52:42] keep you distracted from the real thing.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When you distracted from the real
[1:52:47] thing, you didn't have a purpose. You
[1:52:49] didn't have the objective. You just want
[1:52:52] but no be vigilant, be sober,
[1:52:57] watch because the your adversary as a as
[1:53:01] a as a war line
[1:53:04] which is divor. Be careful how you talk
[1:53:07] your brother and sisters because a
[1:53:10] brother might do something to you. So
[1:53:12] that God can permit allow the brother
[1:53:15] and sister to do something wrong to you.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; You're not important is not brother and
[1:53:20] sister is not important what the body
[1:53:23] says to you to the Lord. There's a
[1:53:26] reason for that. But you is important
[1:53:28] your reaction.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; God is control your reaction.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Why son be that to me? Why to me? Oh
[1:53:37] keep asking why. Keep asking why. You
[1:53:39] going to find why. Keep asking why why
[1:53:42] that to me? Why is that to me?
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Imagine David when he was dethroned and
[1:53:49] walking to the hill of Jerusalem and uh
[1:53:53] shimmy how the guy's name. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:53:56] He came to walk.
[1:54:00] One of the soldier soldier pul said King
[1:54:04] David to call this dog ahead. M
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; you call him a dog.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Even he does s armor weapon. David said
[1:54:14] no no no no that not your battle. This
[1:54:16] my battle. He said the Lord allow him to
[1:54:20] do that to me to see my reaction.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Sometime the Lord permit something say
[1:54:28] on the purpose to see your reaction.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody did something to you to do to
[1:54:34] hurt you to do to see your reaction.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not important what the person did
[1:54:39] to you because God said to me Avengers
[1:54:41] God going to take care that person.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; He did the wrong to you. God going to
[1:54:44] take care of that person. But your
[1:54:46] reaction is important.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I will treat your brother and sister.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; I I will tell
[1:54:55] the whole world
[1:54:57] many time I said well Jesus Christ said
[1:55:01] he was a green tree. You all know that.
[1:55:03] You see you happened to the green tree.
[1:55:05] Jesus Christ. What about you?
[1:55:08] I never heard anybody there been
[1:55:10] somebody in church slap them, spit in
[1:55:12] their face, all this thing. I know that.
[1:55:15] But I wonder that if somebody ever slap
[1:55:18] you and spit on your face, that image
[1:55:20] will be une
[1:55:24] so did that to me at the church. Look at
[1:55:27] what don't believe me what they did to
[1:55:30] me.
[1:55:34] that happened to Christ,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; it can happen to you too.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Always be under expectation. Anything
[1:55:41] can happen to one and sister. But be on
[1:55:44] your guard. Be vigilant.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Be vigilant.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Your reaction is important to God.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Because because God want to u lead you
[1:55:54] to carving.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; He want to lead you to car. He said take
[1:55:58] up your course. Many time we say that
[1:56:02] even that I don't know how you with your
[1:56:04] verse but some Bible my Bible say take
[1:56:07] your cross daily
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; but I know yours take your course I mean
[1:56:14] or every year or
[1:56:19] every six month
[1:56:22] take your course every Sunday or
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; daily
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; take your course daily and follow
[1:56:30] So that mean unless I know you live in
[1:56:33] this country there are some obligation
[1:56:35] you got to go to work do something it's
[1:56:37] fine but if there is no obligation

[1:56:54] didn't see you in church no it's your
[1:56:57] duty if you're not coming to church to
[1:56:58] call somebody to tell them.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; I tell the church many times about that
[1:57:04] who's working in a place when they're
[1:57:06] not showing up to just stay home and
[1:57:09] come back the next day. Tell me.

[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; There's some place even uh I don't know
[1:57:16] two hours before or or a day before
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; to call them tell them I'm not coming
[1:57:21] today. I need a day of something.

[1:57:26] church, hey, you take off whatever you

[2:02:36] right started with Lucifer the bearer of
[2:02:39] light and but when he stepped into obed
[2:02:41] a disobedience
[2:02:43] uh this is where he gets a name change
[2:02:45] and now he's called the devil so anytime
[2:02:47] we see ourselves walking into
[2:02:50] disobedience
[2:02:51] to this,
[2:02:55] we see we're following the wrong
[2:02:57] pattern. And what God is asking us to do
[2:03:00] is come back in line with what my word
[2:03:01] say. Not not I'm not talking about what
[2:03:04] everybody else saying, but what does my
[2:03:05] word say? And uh and and I was just
[2:03:08] listening. I think I don't know. I mean
[2:03:12] he left no stone
[2:03:16] unturned.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; I mean he dealt with everything today.
[2:03:21] And and you know I was talking with my
[2:03:23] wife uh before service and she was you
[2:03:25] know talking with somebody and they were
[2:03:27] saying um you know they go to church and
[2:03:31] usually they're out by 9:30. And my wife
[2:03:33] said well what time y'all start? She say
[2:03:35] 8:30. We got be out by 9:30. She's like,
[2:03:38] "Wow, that's man, that's fast." So he
[2:03:41] said, "Better not come to my church cuz
[2:03:42] we going to be there a little bit longer
[2:03:43] than that." And so the lady was like,
[2:03:46] "Well, what what is it that the pastor
[2:03:48] be saying with all all that time? What
[2:03:51] is he saying?" I mean, how can he say
[2:03:53] anything? I He's saying too much. I
[2:03:55] mean, I just can't take all that. I
[2:03:57] said, "See, they never dealing with
[2:03:58] nothing." That's right.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; But today, if you didn't I mean,
[2:04:02] everybody in here,
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; those here, those that's online
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; should have heard something from God.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; And what happens when you come to the
[2:04:11] house of the Lord, the Bible says
[2:04:14] judgment begins at the house of the
[2:04:16] Lord. So something to cause you to draw
[2:04:18] a little closer to Christ should have
[2:04:20] happened right here today.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; I was sitting there, I say, "Well,
[2:04:24] praise God."
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about everything.
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:31] everything.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; I better not recap the brother message,
[2:04:35] but I I I heard a lot.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; I I hope my my prayer cuz you know I for
[2:04:42] me I hate when a preacher come and do
[2:04:44] something like this and then everybody
[2:04:45] just act like God ain't said nothing.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; You are You got to be kidding me. Did
[2:04:50] you not hear that? That was directly to
[2:04:53] you. God know your email address.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God brought you some mail
[2:04:59] today.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; God brought you some mail today.
[2:05:05] And let me tell you something. Don't you
[2:05:07] delete that too quick.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; You better put that on save.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; And go back and look at it again. I tell
[2:05:15] you, I I I know God spoke in this place.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Jean, we we heard from heaven.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. You were very
[2:05:23] obedient to the spirit of the Lord. We
[2:05:26] heard from heaven. We heard from heaven.
[2:05:29] I I I thank God. I thank God. I thank
[2:05:32] God. I Somebody was asking, you know,
[2:05:34] about uh why do pastors ask other
[2:05:36] pastors to speak for them when we got
[2:05:39] all these evangelists out here that
[2:05:40] don't get a chance to speak? I say,
[2:05:42] look, a pastor know what his church need
[2:05:46] and different gifts do different things.
[2:05:48] So when he invites a pastor, he realizes
[2:05:50] that that pastor has the ability to say
[2:05:52] things that he might not have a chance
[2:05:55] to say.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Evangelist come in and be
[2:05:58] gone. But a pastor just going to take
[2:05:59] his time and just a missile hit here. A
[2:06:03] missile hit here. A every statement a
[2:06:05] miss. Woo. Glory to God.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Boy, I said thank God. Thank God. I'm I
[2:06:14] don't know about you, but I'm I'm
[2:06:15] leaving here a better Christian. I I'm
[2:06:18] leaving here encouraged. I'm leaving
[2:06:20] here strengthened by the word of God.
[2:06:23] And uh and I and I'm happy I came to
[2:06:25] church.

[2:09:12] Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] Thank you, Jesus. Let's bow in a word of
[2:09:17] prayer. Father, we thank you for all
[2:09:20] that has been spoken in this place.
[2:09:24] Lord, your servant just came and got
[2:09:27] himself out of the way and allowed you
[2:09:28] to use his lips. And God, there were so
[2:09:32] many uh situations that was hit here
[2:09:35] this morning. We thank you that you're
[2:09:37] concerned enough about us that you would
[2:09:40] talk to us, you would speak to us, that
[2:09:43] you would call us a little closer to
[2:09:44] you, Father, through your word. And
[2:09:47] Lord, uh and and and I'm reminded of
[2:09:49] what what one preacher said. We're we're
[2:09:51] not picking on anybody, but we are
[2:09:53] picking off because we are the the
[2:09:55] battle that started in heaven. We must
[2:09:58] realize it is now here on earth. And
[2:10:01] father, we're fighting daily. Uh brother
[2:10:04] Brandham told us that the battleground
[2:10:05] that that was chosen was the mind of
[2:10:08] man. So Lord, we we ask that you would
[2:10:10] help us, Father, to have uh victory in
[2:10:13] our lives. Lord, we thank you, Father,
[2:10:15] that it's not it's not what what we have
[2:10:18] to overcome, but it's how we overcome.
[2:10:22] And it's we must use the word of God the
[2:10:25] same way you use the word of God to
[2:10:27] overcome the enemy in this hour. Lord,
[2:10:30] we pray your blessings upon uh Pastor
[2:10:32] Lewis Jean and his family, his church.
[2:10:35] Oh God, thank you that he just took the
[2:10:37] time just to share a thought with us on
[2:10:39] today. Lord, we ask that you return the
[2:10:41] blessing back to him. Bless the saints
[2:10:43] as they prepare to leave this place but
[2:10:45] not your presence. And may we go
[2:10:47] meditating and thinking on the things
[2:10:49] that you spoke to us, Father. All of us
[2:10:52] should have got something out of this
[2:10:53] service. And I pray Lord that we would
[2:10:56] have a fellowship and conversation
[2:10:58] around that that our hearts would draw
[2:11:00] closer to you, Jesus. We carefully give
[2:11:03] you all the honor, all the glory, and
[2:11:04] all the praise. Bring us back at the
[2:11:06] appointed time on Friday on Wednesday
[2:11:08] night. And may the spirit of God meet us
[2:11:10] in a special way, God, is our prayer.
[2:11:12] Thank you for all that has been done in
[2:11:14] this place today. Jesus Christ's name we
[2:11:17] pray. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[2:11:21] hand of praise just once more.
[2:11:24] Hallelujah. You can be seated. The
[2:11:27] brothers will come at this time and they
[2:11:30] will dismiss you. Amen. God bless you
[2:11:32] church. Amen. God bless you.
