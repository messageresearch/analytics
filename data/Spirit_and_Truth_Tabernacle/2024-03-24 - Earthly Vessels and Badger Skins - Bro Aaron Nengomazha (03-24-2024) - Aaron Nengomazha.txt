tears God sees everything that happens in our life let us pray Heavenly Father we come to you this morning we are so thankful father for your presence and for coming in our midest and Gathering us together your word says where the Cass is there the eagle shall be gathered tonight this morning Lord we are gathered as your children knowing Lord that there's no other better place we could be this morning there's no other institution we can turn to there is no other man we can look up to but we are looking up to you because you are able you are more than able to do the exceeding abundant above all that we can ever ask or imagine because you El our RAF Jehovah Nish our provider you are all sufficient uh and you are able to give us all of our needs father as we raise our hands uh we are believing Lord drawing down the benefits of Calvary for we know that everything was paid for whatever we need was paid for our healing was paid for our Salvation was paid for all our needs were paid for on Calvary we thank you father in Jesus Christ we pray that Lord you'll be with us through this service move the minister aside and speak to your children in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you Saints you may have your seats for a little while thank you so much musicians that was some really wonderful worship I plan to retire in Florida not because of the weather but because of the spiritual weather hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and we bring you greetings from our pastor brother Barry coffee amen from Hickory Bible Tabernacle it's our joy to be uh here amen uh you know the ministry texts you to different places some places you enjoy going some places you have to go because of the gift you know Jonah was told go to tashes right that was a rough place for him right but sometimes you don't get to choose you have to be led by the holy spirit because God has his people everywhere but but when we are here we are home Hallelujah we love to be here Hall I I gotta be honest with you there are places that people that we have to talk to it's a gift and you have to love people to be able to minister to them you have to go beyond differences you have to go Beyond little politics you have to look at the bigger picture Hallelujah can you say Amen because the prophet says this the tent stretches a little bit amen let's stand upon our feet and read the scripture this morning glory you say brother Aaron what do you believe I believe the whole word hallelujah every scripture every book every quote I believe in that hallelujah amen 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 to 10 you are such a privileged people to have brother Jack we enjoyed him when he came our way last week oh my that was some really wonderful preaching but we have this treasure in aan vessels that the Excellence of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken right we are cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be you may manifest in our body you may have your seats for uh a little little time today we want to talk about Earthly vessels and bjer skins we know that this church is a well taught church and um it's uh I believe that we be pulling the word with your amens all right remember you are half of the gift when when brother Jack is preaching you half of the gift but when I'm preaching you are 80% you got to remember that amen I want to talk about ether vessels and benjes skins now from the scripture that we read Paul is saying we have this treasure in Ethan vessels and and and and and the natural wisdom of man would think why would you put your your Treasures in in ethn vessels come on you know if if if if it was a modern day people they would buy a lock box they'll buy like a gun safe you know with with all kinds of you know codes and you know something that cannot be broken and that's where you put your diamonds that's where you put your gold that's where you put your your Rolex watches that's where you put your gold bars you know you have to find something somewhere secure and you don't just put it maybe in a kitchen or a dining room you get find a men's den somewhere in the basement and there you put your safe Hallelujah but here the Bible is saying this treasure is in Earthly vessels and that's where the mystery is and that's where we want to dwell on this morning that God chose to put Treasures in Earthly vessels and if you a natural man that that is a bit comp you know perplexing right right but you see God's wisdom is not like our wisdom God's way is not like our way but he said I'm going to send my word and you shall forsake your way and you shall take my way and God's way is beyond understanding he does things that are beyond our imagination and if you want to work with God you got to put away your imagination put away your understanding lean not un your own understanding but look to Jesus because he's able to do above what we can ask or imagine hall hallelujah sometimes we have desires in our hearts how is my son going to receive the Holy Ghost how is my daughter going to receive the Holy Ghost God knows how he's going to do it all we have to do is to pray all we have to do is to believe all we have to do is to accept and apply the token sometimes we try to work things our way oh if he goes to this Camp maybe he might receive that's fine but God works in mysterious ways there was a man at at the Tabernacle his name his name was brother Charlie Cox I believe it was and he was a very good friend of brother bham and he loved brother bham loved to go to his house and he became a deacon and you know he wanted to receive the Holy Ghost but he could not receive it in the Tabernacle when the prophet was preaching believe it or not and the and the wife was praying for him and he had an experience whilst he was home playing the tape and brother B I'm talking about it you would think that wowow the prophet was there preaching naturally he's going to receive the Holy Ghost right there but what what I'm trying to show you is that God works in mysterious ways in his wonders to perform one time someone came on the prayer line and the prophet says your condition you need an oldfashioned Country Doctor he's going to operate on you and you're going to be healed so how God does it it's not our business our business is to believe our business is to accept whether he uses medication whether he uses a miracle we say Amen to the word we say Amen to Jesus we say Amen to his way Hallelujah sometimes we try to make things our own way right we Minister sometimes we try to make everyone be like us now if you want everyone to look like you or be like you then you'll become God we are different friends some are cut this way some are cut that way but we are all God's children amen and sometimes we try to convert our own families sometimes we try to convert our our spouses our duty is to pray God's duty is to convert my duty is to teach my children it's the holy spirit's duty to convert them to Jesus Hallelujah you have to know your portion and God's portion but sometimes try to do both right we try to do both I I enjoyed the good singing God bless you Sister oh draged cross oh my I could I could I could I could feel the anointing wonderful Singing Glory and it Blends well with what we are talking about right and here the Bible says yet it says it says it says here we are troubled on every side not on some side but on every side because the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver out of them allu all of them God delivers out of them because you know what trials are part of the journey sir because if you don't have trials how are you going to overcome if you don't have trials how are you going to wear a crown if you don't have trials how are you going to have a testimony you must have a testim morning of your own Hallelujah and we all have different crosses that's right you can't judge someone by what they're going through just because it's different from what you're going through some of us wear spectacles that's our cross some wear dentures that's our cross some have to work out lose some weight that's our cross but we have different situations but it's the same cross Hallelujah some of us have to deal with our children that's our cross some have to deal with our wives That's our cross we all have a cross to carry some of us have to deal with our finances and that's our cross some have to deal with our health that's our cross but there's a cross for you there's a cross for me Hallelujah and sometimes you might think why is this brother like that you just pray for him God will take care of him why is this sister like this you pray for him God will help him out Hallelujah glory be to God now we are troubled on every side now trials are part of the journey right and and I want you to know that God designed it this way the Bible says this is the stone that the build has rejected and it has become the head of the corner and the Bible says this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes it was God's doing to choose a man who had great seven education it was God's choosing to choose a man who was not eloquent it was God's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes and whatever family set up you came from it was God's doing the angel told the prophet your peculiar birth and your misunderstood life was for you to bring a gift to the world and sometimes we try to to to blame our background God designed your background like that because he knew the gift that he was going to give to you and how you were going to have an impact on people God Hallelujah the prophet always wondered why was I born like this why am I messed up like that it was God's way of bringing a prophet up the mother was Indian the father was Irish you know and and his father you know how many know that he killed a man and that's why they to to to to move from where they were living and they went to live near a city called New Albany right Hallelujah and they a b name wherever you would go he's a br oh is that that that that those vagab bones but you know what that was God's program and some of you may say oh if I if only I didn't grow up somewhere in the project or you know as they call it or somewhere you know in the high density God designed it that way and if only you say Lord show me where you want to place me God will use that for for his own Glory say oh brother why did I come from a broken family God knew you were going to come through that you did not surprise God when you came up to him to give your life and God was like oh this one has come God knew all about you he chose your parents he chose your father he chose your mother he chose your state he chose your city he chose everything about your life sir Hallelujah sir it was God's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes right all right so don't spend your day trying to regret may maybe I made the wrong decision you did not make a wrong decision God made it like that you know Moses had a wife who had a lot of temper her name was uh Zapora but the Bible says Moses was the meekest man upon the Earth who knows maybe the wife contributed to that he was a prophet but yet Z poer and the prophet says there was a lot of fighting in the in the wilderness that's he hallelujah amen that's not in my notes that's good Exodus 39:33 and they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses the tent and all his furniture his te is his boards his bars and his pillars and his sockets and the covering of ram skin died dreed and the covering of bener skins and the veil of the calvary now I want you to know that the glory of God in the Tabernacle of Moses was hidden behind bener skins now benjer Skins are animal skins how many knows that small it's not even a lion or some fancy animal it's just a a tiny small animal that is very very Fearless a type of the believer that God would reveal would would hide his glory behind Benes skins now the the the Scrolls of old they would be kept in in in in clay pots how many knows that that's how they found the lost you know the Bible you know they they would they would go into you know archaeologist would dig up things and they will find a a clay pot in there they would find maybe the book of Jeremiah because there is nothing better that can keep something than an Earthly vessel if you put a paper in an Earthly vessel you seal it up it can it can last for hundreds of years it might it might look vulnerable but that's the best way to keep the cross so Paul is saying that when God gave us this treasure he put it in our hearts and we are Earthly vessels we are just people of the earth we come from the Natural Earth that's why we live by the natural substance of life because we come from this dirt and we go back to this dirt but inside of us though we are dirt on the outside but inside there is an eternal life inside of us there is God who is greater than all of our problems yes sir amen hallelujah amen and here it's saying that the glory of God was hidden behind bener skins now the prophet says in the Mighty God unveiled before us he says we notice another thing in the Old Testament I have the scripture here in in Exodus that the old benjes skins what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people the bener Skins even people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it the skin the glory of God was was was was was behind the skin and he says now and now the glory of God is behind your skin that's it yes sir the glory of God is behind your skin so when we talk to our neighbors when we talk to our to other people we are giving them an opportunity to receive Christ all right because we are veiling the glory of God and the closest that other people are going to see God is through your life that's why the Bible says let your light so shine before man let your light so shine before your neighbor let your light so shine before your coow wakers because you are God's agent to the Earth and you are holding the mercy seat and the prophet says the mercy seat is in the hearts of the believer that's what he said right we yes it's in heaven but it's also in the hearts of the believer that's why Jesus Christ said I give you the keys whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever sins you remit Earth shall be remitted in heaven the church has the power Hallelujah because the church was empowered by God to give life and the prophet says one time the Greater Works was to impart eternal life that's why when we baptize people we lay our hands on them to receive the Holy Ghost they may not receive receive it right there but we are placing them under the promise that somewhere down the road God will work with them and they receive the Holy Ghost we are not the ones to give the Holy Ghost we obey the scripture and upon the basis of the scripture God works on his word if any of you is sick let him call the Elder Hallelujah and the Elder will lay hands and he'll be healed but we are Gentiles and sometimes we don't even need our hands to be laid on we just believe the word right where we are say I believe God I believe God and that's nothing but the truth when you believe God like that something is bound to happen Hallelujah sometimes people go run after you know people with special gifts there's no such thing as special gifts all gifts come from the Bible and the thing that heals you is your faith your faith heals you and faith is a gift from God I've seen people go from Camp to Camp they switch churches every year that is not going to make you a Christian you become a Christian when you believe God when you come under expectation that I am going to meet God today whether it's this brother preaching or that brother preaching I'm going to receive something from God but when you follow personalities you going to have problems because you know what men changes but God Remains the Same you may follow brother Aaron today the next moment you hear that is preaching another funny Doctrine so what do you do stop following man and follow the word follow the word follow the Bible stay with your pastor stay with your church uh stay with your husband GL Hallelujah and you don't have to wait for another Camp to receive the Holy Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost today you can receive the H ghost this morning you can receive the Holy Ghost right now if you have faith in Jesus GL because when the Holy Ghost was given in on the day of Pentecost it became available to everyone right now because from before the day of Pentecost they had to wait for the day of Pentecost to fully come when the day of Pentecost fully came it was available to everyone amen amen amen which means that if you need it God can give you now James chapter 5 verse 17 let's open this one I I love this verse now the Bible says El lias which is Elijah now I like the Book of James because it's a book of wisdom and it's like the Book of Proverbs wisdom is practical you know the Book of Proverbs is very practical it will tell you if you're lazy you're not going to S succeed it's very very practical amen says is the door turns upon the hinges so is a lazy man who turns in his bed Hallelujah so wisdom is practical and I recommend young people to read The Book of Proverbs amen Elijah was a man Elijah did did was an angel did you say that it said Elijah was a man am I reading it right Elijah was a God no Elijah was an archangel no Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are it wasn't different but as we are talking about Elijah of of of old and this is where there's a bridge and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth for the space of three and three three years and six months the Bible says that though he was a man subject to like passion yet he prayed and this is the mystery friends though we are man though we are subject to the same elements that people go through but our consolation is that there is a power in us that if the weakest of the Saints can pray then Jesus can hear from heaven and is able to intervene on our behalf Elijah did not have a different blood type than everyone else Elijah did not have different eyes than everyone else he also had headaches like anyone else he had stomach aches like anyone else he had anxiety like anyone else but he trusted in Jesus Hallelujah so sometimes when we read about the men of the Bible we think that you know their life was significantly different to ours they the same life that we have it's the same road my friend there it's the same Rob that we wear some come through the water some through some through the fire but we all go through the blood we all go through the same door Glory so Elijah just like the prophet right he had his own complexes he had his moments when he was up there were moments when he was down I'll read you the quotations but yet he was a man of God Amen yet there was a hidden power inside of him now the Amplified version just to give you an understanding I I read the King James version unless someone will check me on that one but for your understanding people some people get into a lot of trivia so brother I'm a King James person yes but sometimes you need to study Elijah was a man with a nature like ours the here it says with the Fe physical mental and spiritual limitations and shortcomings and he prayed intensely for not for for it not to rain and it did not rain on the earth for 3 years and 6 months so because you as long as you are a man the word man means you are limited you're not going to be able to do everything by your own self you're not going to be able to do everything by your own power you need something higher Hallelujah First Corinthians chap 1: 26 let's open our Bibles so it's going to be a very simple teaching this morning so you know opening your Bibles and reading for you see your calling Brethren how that not many were wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many Nobles are called so here he's saying that when God called us he didn't really call the brightest and greatest that's what the Bible is saying here sometimes we know we look at ourselves and we say oh look at the people in the world the Bible says Jesus Christ says the children of this world are in their generation not not all the time in their generation in their time wiser than the children of the light that's why you see unbelievers they Prosper because God has given them that because they have no inheritance Over Yonder how many knows that that the the seed of SE they were humble Farmers but the seed of Cain were the nimrods they were building cities they were Building Bridges they were building roads but they were not God's elect so natural things do not necessarily show the blessing of God although we need those things but the blessing of God comes from election election is part is the is is the expression of the love of God right hallelujah it's like marriage you can't say this man loves me because he bought me a car he bought me those things are fine and brothers you have to do that if you can but love is election right you know when you elect someone you choose to be with them you choose to spend the rest of your life with them you marry them that's love and then in the course of that love you express that love you buy them chocolates you buy them flowers you know you give them AMX to go shopping and all those things are fine and the sisters say you take them on vacations Hallelujah you buy them dresses every month and the sister say Oh Glory technicians let's cut that part from the seron now not many were wise after the remember the Bible saying after the flesh not after the spirit because when you have the Holy Ghost of course you are wiser than someone who does not have the Holy Ghost when we talk about the wisdom of God but naturally worldly wisdom right says after the flesh not many were Mighty not many were Noble are called but God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and the prophet says sometimes our problems that we are too strong perfect strength by Perfect weakness and he says God is looking for people who are weak God is looking for people who are who are who are broken God is looking for people who are sheep God is looking for people who are saying Lord lead me Lord show me the way Lord show me where to go God is not looking for people who know everything waterheads intellectual God is looking for people that can be led God is looking for people that are vulnerable before him I went to to my eye doctor the other time and I had problems with my eyes you know and he said there's nothing thing other than of course I wear glasses but it says the challenge with your eyes is that they're too dry cry you're not crying so I'm going to give you some I'm going to prescribe you some artificial tears and that's what they call eye drops eye drops are just artificial tears because your eyes it's not supposed to be too dry it's not good for you then I thought wow so sometimes it's normal to cry but you know what you have to cry before the Lord it's normal sometimes to weep that doesn't mean you are weak or you are weakling it means that you are a human being But You Weep to God hallelujah weeping can last for the night but joy comes in the morning those who plant with te with tears they will come reaping rejoicing Hallelujah when you when you s in tears in prayer you you you reap with joy how many scriptures how many times that the Bible say I cried out unto the Lord how many times that David say I cried out unto the Lord one time he said this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and he delivered him this poor man cried and the Lord heard me Hallelujah I know where I come from I know what I've been through and this poor man cried and the Lord heard him hallelujah praise be to God sometimes we try to make ourself too strong for nothing sometimes you need to lay before the Lord and Lord I have no idea how I'm going to get through this month Lord I have no idea how I'm going to hold this together Lord I have no idea how I'm going to keep my job I have no idea how I'm going to keep pay my bills when you do that he will come on the scene he will come on the scene he will come on the scene call upon him call upon him uh call Upon Jesus and he will come upon the that's why he is called the god of the fatherless the god of the widows he chooses to identify himself with the vulnerable right he's the god of the blind he's the god of the those that are vulnerable he is the god to those people and he is very sensitive to their prayers yes sir so when you are vulnerable that's when God is sensitive to your prayers when was David the most spiritual those who study the Bible they will tell you when he was running away from Saul when he was in the palace he was a kind of man that's what they say you know he had problems when he was in the palace you know everything was okay but when he was running away from Saul that's why he wrought a lot of good sounds sometimes God lets us through go the through the valley when we go through the valley then we can sing something from the inside and say God is able Hal Hallelujah because you are singing from in experience there's some there's a difference between Theory and experience that's why you can never be a general in the Army unless you have physically fought battles that's right for you to be a general you have to have gone through the battles that's why when I when I look to at men like brother Jake Duff I I I learn a lot from them cuz as a young man you can study the Bible the message you can all know about it with your mind but this man have experienced they've been in the field for a long time they know something that you may not know they've seen something that you have not seen so as a young man you want to stay with your elders because you know what an elder can see further when he's sitting than when a young man can look when he's standing Hallelujah the Bible says in the Book of Proverbs the glory of the of the of the old man is in his gray hair his wisdom but the glory of the young man is in his strength but you know strength without wisdom is very very dangerous strength without wisdom is very dangerous that's why when you go to the army they have to teach you discipline because if you are powerful and you have no wisdom you are a danger to yourself [Laughter] Hallelujah and I I see young men on the field they just floating around they have no Pastor they have no church they don't pay their tithe they just going around say brother where do you come from I'm just an evangelist you have to come from somewhere you got to have a church you got to have a pastor W my pastor is online he doesn't even know you you will not be able to give an count for you oh my that is not the apostolic way you have to have a home church we have we have homeless people naturally and we have homeless people spiritually today they are on this street the next moment they on that street they on this bench on that bench oh come on Church help me preach this morning you got to have a church you got have a pastor you got to have a home you got to have a wife you got to have be in order Hallelujah you need to be accountable you have to be accountable if you don't know the Bible says if you don't know something ask your husband if your husband doesn't know something then you can ask the pastor that's God's order that's the and the pastor has to be checked by the by the spoken words by by other ministers in the fivefold ministry you have to be accountable you this this attitude of you know this modern day attitude where I I I'm just going to be myself that's not scriptural that's a rebellious Spirit glory to God I I I just got to be me who who are you you don't even know who you are God knows who you are God tells you who you are you cannot be who you are unless God tells you who you are hallelujah hallelujah young people when they get come to an age where they want to marry sometimes you know it's like when people hunt deer there a season which they call the rat when deers come to meet they lose their mind they they drop all their defenses because of that season that's the easiest season to shoot deer and the devil knows the easiest season to shoot young people is during the marriage season you got to stay with your pastor during that season because you don't have a mind something is happening inside of you you don't know what it is the elders know what it is they can help you Hallelujah and people get under pressure they become they start advertising why are you advertising if you not selling something Instagram Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] may God help us this morning may God help us this morning they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as the eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not [Applause] [Music] [Applause] faint you know why the Bible says that because the verse before that says the young men shall fail says the young men shall fail but those that wait upon the Lord those that wait upon the Lord Shing you their strength and when you do it right God gives you a goodly wife the prophet would go every year and he would go in the woods and pray just to thank God for his wife sir because when you marry a daughter of meis EDC you become a son-in-law of meis EDC but if you marry a daughter of Bello you become the son-in-law of what Hallelujah we don't have to wait for for camp we have to preach these things Revelations chapter 4 part 3 now we are living in another age Glory oh I love this age don't you God has has a mercy seat today today to be guarded so so he says you believe that where is the Mery City found in the heart of a man so we have this Mery seat in Earthly vessels but he's saying that the mercy seat had to be guarded how many knows that in the Old Testament the had shakina glory and they had they were the way they were camping they had three tribes on this side three tribes on that side three tribes on that side three tribes on that side and the Levites would also be the same because they were different types of Levites right if you you the me meites and and the different ones and Judah would be the leader of the Eastern tribe right and he would have a burner of a lion and Dan would be the leader of of of of the tribes in the North and the bner of an eagle right how many knows that and these were guarding the shakina glory they were guarding the Throne of God and to and then the prophet is saying but now the mercy seat is in the heart of the believer and because The Mercy Seat it also has to be guarded by the anointing of the liion by the anointing of the eagle by the anointing of the man and the anointing of the ox that's why proverb says 4:23 guard your heart for out of it comes the issues of life because if your heart is The Mercy Seat that's why Paul says can I take Christ's members and unite them with a harot you have to guard your heart because it is The Mercy Seat am amen amen and when you are on the internet guard your heart when you are going through the websites guard your heart Hallelujah when you're going through the streets guard your heart be careful what you're looking at be careful what you're seeing and some people have become perverted men becoming women and they don't know where they got the spirit from websites of spirits got your heart you think it's entertainment the devil is not there to entertain you friends these things are spirits the devil is no business entertaining you you think the devil can bring a billion dollar industry just to entertain people no sir no no he's a businessman he's a smart businessman got your heart young manen say oh brother it doesn't affect me I'm married that's what's affecting your marriage it's a spirit getting in the spirit amen 106 the other night as I was preaching on the subject on the news flash greatest in history John his eyes got was it was filmed over he was he was like Yeah The Spirit of Elijah and Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree and sometimes as Christians we go through a breakdown we're not always high up on the mountain sometimes we are down in the valley sometimes you don't feel like going to church but you go anyhow some sometimes you don't feel like praying but you pray anyhow sometimes you feel like things are too hard for me I can't pay my tithe but you pay anyhow we have high we have high moments we have low moments but we remain Christians we Soldier on we keep moving forward amen and the Bible says in the Book of Ezekiel that the living creatures they tend not where they went if they would move this side they were going forward if they were moving this side they were going forward and a Christian does not go backwards it's always always moving forward when you get a raise you're moving forward uh when you get a retrenchment you're moving forward uh when you're in an apartment you're moving forward when you buy a house you are moving forward when you lose your job you are still moving forward in Jesus Christ Glory Glory Hallelujah you are always moving forward God knows what he's doing that's why Paul says everything all works together for good he says all things not some things all things all things work together for good even the boss that is giving you a hard time he's working together for good the teenager that is giving you a hard time he is working together for good hallelujah praise God Bible says in the book of Isaiah who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him and a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form or kindliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him that's Christ is the message of the hour there's no Beauty in the message of the hour for people to desire it it sounds different right it looks different it's different from the other denominations but you know what that's Jesus Christ amen and the Bible is saying who has believed our report to whom is the arm of of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is revealed the prophet preaches this sermon it's revealed you find the answer in Isaiah 28 right says says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and to whom whom should we explain the message it's just those that are wied from the breast those taken from the breast those children if you are converted like children then you can enter the kingdom if you want to see the power of God you have to be children if you want to enjoy your marriage be children there's so much bitterness because you've become too adulty oh you did this to me in 2015 6 December at 2 p.m. if you would apply that memory in school you'd be a doctor right now but the devil is very clever he he will make you recall things that are negative but the bad the good things he will never show you so he doesn't love you he forgot about this he forgot your your birthday in 2016 you know what that's nothing my brother have be like little children I have a three-year-old old daughter I can say I don't like what you're doing you know she cries and after after 10 minutes she comes back to Daddy that's a little child and our relationship become very toxic when we lose that child like faith and child like attitude when we become too legalistic when you become too hard and too tough be little children if you want to enjoy your home be little children that's the difference between when you just got married and when you stayed in marriage you lost that but God is saying go back to that go back to being little children because you know what we attach a lot of emotion and that's okay we have emotions but we we have to offload our emotions in prayer because prayer makes us sweet and the reason why women remember a lot of things because they are naturally emotional creatures that's why you never forget something that happened to you you know like maybe let's say something bad that happened to you because because there was a lot of emotions involved it's always Vivid in your eyes how many knows that that so women because they emotional they tend to remember things a lot it's not their choice right their weaker vessels so so Brothers we have to be careful when you deal with women's emotions don't promise them something that you can't do because you're messing with her emotions be careful how you speak to her cuz you're messing with emotions Hallelujah because a woman will grab on that word because she's a type of the church as soon as you see a promise in the Bible you grab onto it Hallelujah and you say Lord you promised me and God is faithful Glory don't just brush it aside honor your promise we man we are not very emotional so that's why we we forget things easily we get emotional once in a while maybe when we buy a new truck or something you know oh when our child scratches our car say John remember how you scratched my my my my my my shave Cru I didn't like that all right Glory right sometimes you know we minister to families we want people to come into church and enjoy church we don't want to be too high people don't Lear hear anything right amen but the prophet says but to be willing to die for us he gave freely his blood at Calvary that's right he was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he made a public testimony so what I'm driving at is is that the humanity side of Christians that we are not always going to be strong we're not always going to be smiling don't get it confused when you say I'm walking with God I'm doing everything I'm paying my tithe but things are not working out you have to remain faithful and keep holding on to God because that's part of the journey it's not a it's not like a Christianity is not like a how can I explain this it's not like okay something that you can just put your card in a slot and then money comes out it's not automatic like that you walk with God because you love him and because he loves you he is able to do these things naturally God is able to provide our needs because he loves us but that's not that's not the reason why we follow him just wait until you become a billionaire you find people looking for you that you have never had an idea that they they'll ever look for you because you know what they're looking for something and it's not you looking for something just let a young man buy a nice car you know they'll start coming but the Bride is a real woman we are not running after gifts we are running after Christ because we love him but when gifts come we appreciate it but our coming to church is because we love God Amen that's worship when you love God from all your heart you say no matter what I go through no matter what's happening in my life I love Jesus and I'm going to go to church I'm going to worship God hallelujah even if your mortgage payment is behind you say thank you jesusall Hallelujah Glory we love him because we just love him yes even if Lord you slay me I worship you even if he cast me to hell I'll still love him am oh my amen we're not trying to you know find some tricks you know just to draw something from God we actually love him from our hearts amen now because Christianity is based on love and relationship should be based on love if you base your relationships on physical things you're going to have problems because those elements change and you know what no matter how much you love something if it's given to you after some time you won't like it you want something different so if you love if you base your relationship with God and with Man based on elements you're going to have problems you'll be wanting to shift all the time because our desires are not constant because because of this Fallen nature yes you may may say ah I love Chick-fil-A that's my favorite restaurant after 3 months you say ah their their fries don't taste the same you know they nuggets they not the same you know that's why the prophet says if you marry a woman because she looks pretty there'll be an end to that but if you just something inside of you by Revelation you don't know and you marry that woman then that's an eternal me that's what the prophet says hallelujah if you go if you come to church because you've got a new job one day you're going to lose that job if you come to church just because you've got new shoes one day they're going to weigh out if you come to church just because this happened well some people say well the pastor didn't make me a deacon so I'm going to switch church then you know the right person for the job oh they didn't acknowledge me this they didn't do this it's not about you at the end of the day it's about Jesus Christ the Bible says that all things were made for him and all things were made through him and all things were made for him which means that we don't have anything right everything belongs to Christ and whatever we have it's stewardship when we have families we are just stewards when we are fathers we are stewards because you know what if you're a father you're going to give an account is a father how you raise your children if you are a mother you're going to give an account because we are stewards and the prophet says you're going to give an account of your time and he says don't judge the prostitute in the Bible because you can also prostitute your time that's a quote the time that we have we are stewards of the time we are stewards of our finances we are stewards of our resources that's why we don't waste our our resources God God and when we pay tithe we are redeeming that money because it's all supposed to belong to God because everything belongs to God but God is saying you can redeem it by paying a 10% Hallelujah can you say Amen I'm preaching types I'm not preaching about man friends don't that's good brother I'm giving types say we don't want want the brother to come back here amen hallelujah so because everything belongs to God whatever we have we are naturally stewards the job that we have we are stewards that's why the Bible says work as if you are working unto the Lord and sometimes the reason why we don't have success is the way we are working you come to church dragging your to work dragging your feet you're always complaining that's not a Christian attitude if you are a Christian you give all your heart the UN Believers must say there's something different about Aon we love Aon we love his attitude you know what I had a performance review one time and I I I vowed in my heart I said Lord I want to mess up anything technical but something to do with like coming to work early saying hi to people I must pass that with flying colors all right because that's that that's easy for a Christian to do and and the the grace of God they say we love your attitude you're a positive man yeah there's just something about you that's what that's the starting point right true and when you do that and you come here we pray for you then God is bound to bless you but when we pray for you and then you go out there you forget who you are and you join the complainers and the memor and you have an attitude towards your your boss and you have an attitude towards your work that's not the attitude of a Son of God when you are a son of God when you do something you do it well if you a farmer you do it well if you're a painter you do it well if you're a photographer you do it well if you're a doctor you do it well Hallelujah you do it because of passion not because of money you do it out of passion but because you do it passionately God is bound to give you the finances because adoption is not just preaching you can be adopted as a farmer you can be adopted as a doctor when you are a Doctor by adoption you are different from someone who's just chasing the dollar you know there's something about you when you wake up in the morning say Lord lead me I'm going to work Lord I'm going through a surgery show me how I'm supposed to do this when you have that attitude God is going to bless your hands when you have that attitude God is going to bless you even if you are driving a truck do it with passion even if you're walking working on a drive-thru do it well and pray for your job until people will say I just love that drive-through there's something different because you are a Christian and before you pick those fries you pray for them you anoint them Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah I have a friend in Canada his name is Timothy you went there you know being an immigrant you said I'm just looking for a job you know you know was able to get a tracking license and everything so first day supposed to start work they give him a truck they spoke to him and the owner said I know you can drive a truck I know but I just there's something different about you you're just a nice person you know what I'm going to I'm going to move you from being a truck driver if you don't mind I'm going to make you a manager of my all my restaurants says but but I've never worked in the restaurant industry says I'll teach you because I love something something about you he was a Christian when you are a Christian God opens doors for you when you have the right attitude God is able to open doors for [Applause] you sometimes we close doors for ourself and we blame the devil the devil is not even involved in your situation sometimes it's our attitude that close doors for us am exactly right when you tell someone I'm going to send you an email tomorrow morning do it if you can't do it tell them I apologize I'm not able to send you tomorrow morning can I give you on Monday that's what a Christian does people should rely on you depend upon you say this man is honest this man is honest you know everyone wants to be associated with something like that that's what Joseph heard that's what what what Joseph heard and porer would say you know what I can trust this man with all my household he would even leave and leave Joseph with his wife but some today the unbeliever say oh this one I can't leave him with my family oh Jesus oh well I'm going to I'm going on vacation but since my wife going to be here you can take some days off now Brothers I'm not saying be alone with a woman don't be alone with a woman that's what the prophet teaches I'm I'm just trying to illustrate something glory be to God even ministers you can't just trust everyone with your church you got to be Dependable a pastor should say if brother so and so comes even if I'm way I have TR confidence in him that he's not going to bring a funny Doctrine from somewhere you have to have that stability as a Christian sir amen that's good Psalms 82:6 I love the sound of the B the Turning of Bibles all right and the scrolling of iPads of course just don't bring Vision PR to church when you know I see a day when people are having Vision Pros in church say let's turn our Bibles they going I hope the Rapture comes before that Psalms 82:6 I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high now people stop here and they Rejoice oh we are God which is fine and I do that too but verse seven is what brings the balance but you shall die like all men and fall like one of the princes you have covid like everyone else and you go to the hospital don't say we are bright we are bright no you are bright but you can get Co you are bright but your check can bounce you are bright but you you can be sent to collection though you die like all men and fall like the princess but I have saved your Gods you say you know what though I'm a human being though I'm going but there's something in me there's a God inside of me now I'm not saying this to discourage you I'm I'm trying to show you that don't look at what is surrounding you because remember Jonah the Bible say in the Book of Jonah that those that observe lying vanities they forsake their own Mercy that's the prayer that Jonah prayed when he was in the belly of the of the well and there was you know it's so graphic you know the belly of the well everywhere that Jonah was looking and touching it was slimy but yet he prayed to God it says those that observe lying vanities they forsake their own Mercy in other words I'm not going to pay attention to what's happening around me I'm going to look to the temple I'm going to look to Jesus I'm going to say my help comes from the Lord my help comes from Jesus my help comes from above my promotion comes from above my finances come from above my health comes from above hallelujah salvation comes from above peace comes from from above Joy comes from above uh all the good things come from above my help comes from above woo [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah but you shall die like all man you shall fall like like some of the princess you also make sometimes get into arguments just like everyone else you can get frustrated through traffic like someone else when somebody cuts you on the interet you say why do they do that but you know what there is a life inside of you you say you know what but I am different and God wants us to have that mindset I'm about to close in the next 10 minutes or so now in the Old Testament the Jews were under the priesthood of Aaron and the Bible says that they were under the law because the law is for servants and slaves because remember the prophet says Jews are always God's servants but we the the Gentile bride we are Kings the Bible says he has made us Kings and priest that's right and our priesthood is not the priesthood of Aaron we receive the priesthood of melchisedek because meis was a king and he was a priest yes sir because our covenant was to walk not by the law but by grace and not disgrace but by grace and because of Grace we have revelation my skirt has to be long but if but before you become mature you are under the law because Galatians says that the law was a was a was a school Master to bring us to Christ when you live with dos and don'ts can I do this can I do this can I put my hair right can I do this you are living by the law but when you have a revelation when there's something inside of you you know where to go you know which websites to click you know which channels to watch you know which friends to hang out with you know what to do you know which places to go amen amen but if you are have a bunch of rules and regulations and everybody has to check on you and the deacons have to ask you why weren't you in church last last weekend we have not seen you in three weeks oh brother is everything okay you are still at the seventh level but when you become a Christian and you are baptized by the Holy Ghost then you are walk working as a king like that slave right who was different and they asked him do you feed him different they said no what what's different about shim he say I wondered the same until I learned that be where he comes from you as a son of a king and he conduct himself as a son of a king Hallelujah though everyone else might do this way he will go this way because remember we are in an age where people want to do things in groups everyone is doing this we call it Trends right and algorithms this is the trend this is the trend but you know what as a Son of God you always don't have to follow every Trend sometimes you need to go your own way because God deals with Jews as a group but with Gentiles he deals with us as individuals and salvation is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you when you have a personal revelation even if my wife stops coming to church I'll go to church even if my family stops coming to church I will go to church even if everyone criticizes me I will stay with the word I've been invited to dinners where I know that you know people are going to like a just a drinking spray being the only one to say no and I've been happy about that because you know what I'm a Christian I know where to go and way not to go I don't have to follow the crowds I follow Jesus you have to have your own personal revelation when somebody asks you why do you long you wear long skirts don't say our church church don't say our church say the Bible says the Bible says the word of God says the prophet says why don't you drink you don't even drink wine why it's like you know our church it's it's complicated it's [Music] complicated I was in college one time and I met a sister I said and we had a conversation and I said sister would you want to receive the Holy Ghost we can you know go to some of these prayer meeting I think it'll be good and she said I'm not ready to receive the Holy Ghost I only wear long skirts because my dad dad prays for the sick I said wow what an what an answer you know you could say that there's some nothing had happened to this person but when something happens in you it's no longer my parents it's no longer my mother it's no longer my husband it's about a personal revelation Hallelujah that even if your husband would backslide and say I want you to wear this you say no honey I can do anything for you but I cannot wear this there's something that happened in the inside of the inside there's an anchor in your heart there's an anchor in your spirit there's an anchor anchored in Christ Jesus Hallelujah doing all right yes sir 1 Chronicles chapter 4:9 this is a different version so you have to bear with me the Bible says jabz was more honorable than his brothers but his mother named him jabz saying because I gave birth to him in pain in other words his name was let's just call him pain jabus let's say his name was pain brother pain life was just rough for brother pain the neighborhood that you grew up and wasn't good but you know what he never played the victim you never called for a py party Bible says jabz cried out to go the god of Israel saying oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my my borders my property in enlarge my my my property Hallelujah take it take it the way it's written enlarge my property huh yes enlarge my bedrooms enlarge my family enlarge my finances enlarge my joy enlarge my health oh if you can bless me Lord jabes was an honest man when you go to God don't try to play religious say Lord please bless me bless me Lord and bless me indeed uh bless me Lord and bless me indeed uh that's what jab prayed he was honest before God yes sir sometimes we we think people are praying they're trying to preach God a sermon just pray my brother just pray my sister say Lord help me Jus prayed oh that thou would bless me indeed and enlarge my my Border in my territory that your your hand may be with me that you would keep me from Evil so that it does not hurt me because you know what his name was pain and I like what the Bible says and God granted his request that's right I believe this morning God will grant our request I believe God will grant our request our request for our families our request for our children uh our request for our church uh God will grant us this morning uh because we ask in in faith we ask believing we ask in love uh God will grant you this morning uh do you believe it my brother say I receive uh I receive can you believe in my brother say I receive I receive hallelujah what is bothering you this morning is your job bothering you God will granted this morning what you what is your need this morning what is your want God is able to Grant to you this morning this hour right now Hallelujah there is no one that came on the prayer line and brother brah says your problem is too hard there I have never seen a quotation like that sir the prophet will just tell you what you have need of some people would have one need you're you looking for healing some people come with three needs some people come with four needs and the prophet says you're looking for healing also you have a burden for your child to be saved another thing also your husband is not coming to church and say Go On Believing Jesus has never begged away from a desire he would ask you what do you need that was the question that Jesus would ask what would you that I do unto you and he's still asking that this morning what do you need church what do you need child what do you need my brother Give It All to Jesus yes sir Glory some people try to make it a peace meal to say ah to today I'm just going to ask for something small or something very spiritual just be honest with before God say Lord I have a need for this I have a need for that I have a need for that and you know what he's going to he's going to he's going to turn away all your captivity praise God I want to say this in closing friends God loves us and God has given us the greatest message to ever come on the horizon of the earth and the prophet says when God provides he provides the best it says always when God provides he provides the best the best thing for a baby is the mother's milk God always provides the best may he give you the best marriage may he give you the best job may you give you the best finances may he give you the best children may he give you the best Church may he give you the best property may he give you the best all the desires of your heart may he give you the best because God provides the best may he give you the best clients Hallelujah may he give you best health uh best parents uh everything that you need uh may he give you the best uh God bless you Church uh may he provide your needs uh provide your health uh provide your Joy provide your peace may he give you the best hallelujah thank you brother Jack Hallelujah do you receive it tonight uh come on rejoice Church uh accept it by faith uh come on stand upon on your feet uh

the sick and God does the rest and we also know that uh spoken words uh uh just by believing the word you know one can be healed we realize that but um I believe it was a confirmation amen when brother Aaron just begin to mention just we lay hands on the sick and they recover so we want to want to lay hands on our brother and we know that uh no matter what he is facing is not too hard for God I love the way he he in the sermon say there was never anybody come to the prayer line that was told by the the prophet your your Situation's too hard no no no no no no no if you had faith enough

blind man and everyone was saying that he was blind because uh his parents had sinned or something that they had done and I was looking in the word and Jesus said it's not because of his parents right it's not because of Any sins of anything that he had done he said but this man is blind for the glory of God and I looked up the word Glory um in the Greek and it mean it's uh the word is doca and it means weight or nature and I begin to think that our situations our problems were given to us to prove the weight and nature of God all right to prove the glory of God Amen so whatever you're going

close to leaving and then the devil will try to the plan but it don't matter how many times he cripples a plan it won't be long I don't know what your church is going through I come to tell you it won't be long so you seeing me here this morning this might be the last time in this place amen amen cuz I serve a God who stands by his promise the Bible says his promises are yes and amen so when I came this morning I was so glad I could be here I probably more excited than everybody else cuz I said we arrived all right just in time you know because after this brother Jack you have your own building and come on man the Bible say if just two or three touch an agree you don't need I'm with you brother Jack I'm with you brother Jack Amen I with you brother just two or three amen and here comes brother Aaron Aaron Brother Aaron was striking on faith it took me back to Joseph amen Joseph in those trials you know God was training him the whole time training him to be humble hallu Amen to be responsible with the little bit that he had even when he threw him in prison he still had to be responsible amen and then God took Joseph from prison to power all right there some people you know we you know it's your attitude while you on that job y you at the same spot you asking God to promote me promote me promote me you know I worked a job brother Jack and my boss she used to say derogatory terms to me every single day and my wife would hear her on the phone my wife said you don't let her talk to you like that let me talk to her she used to say call me out of my name she uh would bring up like slavery times and my mentality was like slave thinking but I was humble Lord Jes and I was was quiet and I was faithful and I paid my tithe Amen brother Aaron amen I paid my tithe and offering there's a conjunction there it's not just 10% you see when you just give God just enough he'll give you just enough oh come on Amen you got to watch your attitude you can be paying ties and still not paying [Music] ties amen the Bible say says he loves a cheerful Giver amen he wants you to give with the right attitude amen and so I I was doing that for four years brother Jack four years and God said because you were faithful with that I'll take you from working for people to working for yourself that's not just for me sir that's for you amen but you got to believe it the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise shall bring it to pass amen so let's change our attitude amen don't just come to this church and be satisfied having a seat where you sitting you pray over that seat God I need you to transform this condition I need you to transform this this uh building transform us from here and put us in another place amen so that we can worship more free so that we can run circles around the building amen how many believe that this morning I I want to run circles around the building amen I want to see sister cop shout around the church amen sister Birds March one more time glory be to God Amen y'all got to forgive me my cheese is a little bit off my cracker amen but I still love God Amen so again I I just want to thank brother Jack Amen um let's slow it down just a little bit amen uh let's just sing that Gyra you are enough amen amen and then I turn it back over to brother Jack but brother Jack I'm so happy to be here amen we love you we appreciate you appreciate you taking all my phone calls all my text messages amen appreciate your prayers well I told Brother Jack I said you know the doctor said that my son have uh autism I said but I don't believe that he said brother Jo I don't believe that either he said because God gave you your son he don't give you no halfway blessing so he says start calling him Miracle amen because that's who he is is amen he's a miracle amen I believe that God shall supply all of my needs amen not some of them you know I was preaching I say this last thing and when we'll sing it I was preaching uh a word about the uh man at the pool of Bethesda Bible says he tried 37 times to get in but when Jesus came he asked him would he be made holy said every time I try to go and get in the water somebody just kind of jumps ahead of me amen you know what the prophet said he said you know there was nothing wrong with that that man he wasn't crippled he said he wasn't crippled you know when we read it in the Scriptures it looked like he was crippled but the prophet of God said he had a disease he said he had something in his mind that was preventing him from believing oh my help somebody I don't I don't want to preach behind the preacher but sometimes what we think is the problem is not the problem what the problem is is our faith we don't really believe like we're supposed to believe and that is causing a condition in our mind and we think it's our legs but it's our faith because see I've learned through my life that the impossible with you is an opportunity for God to do the possible let me say it again the impossible with you is an opportunity for God to do the possible because nothing is impossible for God Amen so he provides I believe it this morning he provides I believe he heals I believe he opens doors that no man can shut amen I believe he's a same God yesterday and today and forever amen amen how many believe that oh you are J BR you are enough wo you are child wo you are

headed to London uh for Easter and um there is quite a few saints that are going uh I think the numbers are correct about 207 or something like that uh so it's a pretty good crowd that's that's going and brother Joe just mentioned they uh he and sister Rebecca be going uh with uh their baby daughter and uh we're looking forward to that um I know that um brother Steven and sister Rachel joining us and brother Aaron and sister Rebecca they already over there they in Paris or something like that with that's that's why Sarah and shice they met him up in Paris I said Lord look at y'all but I was praying for them as they were leaving I said I thank God that when you all serve God the way that you serve him then these are the blessings that you can look forward to and see if the Holy Ghost can keep you in West Palm Beach then the same Holy Ghost can keep you in Paris and keep you in London it'll keep you in Sweden you ain't trying to get somewhere where you can get off to the side and do something that you're not supposed to be doing you're going to let the Holy Ghost keep you wherever you go praise the Lord but when you serve God he's able to bless you in ways that go beyond your expectations and I like to just say while they was there enjoying themselves we was right here enjoying ourselves and we we looking forward to the meetings but uh and I and I like I touch and agree what brother Joe said uh it's it won't be long amen we'll be leaving here uh I don't I I you can't even put the verse count the years as months I'mma just skip that part but I'm say but count the months as weeks and then count the weeks as days because any day now we be moving glory to God glory to God brother Aaron we appreciate you God bless you so much and um let me go on record this was your first time preaching here but this will not be your last time preaching here hallelujah praise God we love the word [Laughter] brother [Laughter] Hallelujah and that was nothing but the truth we thank God for everything you said brother that was just right on time exactly what we needed last last night he was preaching on maturity and how we just do some some things that we allow the the devil to do in our life that we have not matured from and we got the Holy Ghost and it's been 30 years and like he say sometime the devil give you elephant memory you remember something that happened 5 years ago the exact time that it happened and and refuse to let it go come on somebody we got to get free from that I remember one time somebody did something to me and I knew that it was wrong they was wrong and um and but I I I I I I pretty much said Within Myself whether they come to apologize to me or not I'm going to forgive them and I'm going to keep moving on and when I would see that person I would greet them God bless you and they know what they said to me they send an apology through somebody else so don't worry about it somebody else didn't say it you said it but you ain't you

Lord to grow up in you you're you're expecting that you're not expecting us to be the same that we were uh 20 years ago it's like when a mother has a baby the baby has to mature it has to grow that is normal process for that child if that didn't happen we wonder what's wrong what's wrong with this child same thing in our spiritual walk God I I just appreciate uh Lord all that was shared here thank you for brother Joe and sister Rebecca the three children that you have blessed him with oh God and uh we know how the devil want to try to take from their testimony but God we know that um God you

say if if he have to lay them flat on their back that's what he said and uh he said but God will work it out and he say he'll he say they'll be saved anyhow that's what he told us so we we we we believe what the Holy Ghost said through the prophet that they'll be saved anyhow and the Holy Ghost also told us that we weren't wondering about our future and we're concerned about this and we're concerned about that but the angel of the Lord showed up and took a blank piece of paper threw it up in the air and it and it came down and said your future is clearall we receive it father our future
