indeed a privilege for us to be here tonight those that are watching online I greet you in the name of Jesus Christ we won't take much time we'll turn into our scripture I want you to open your Bible with me to the Book of John I'm sorry Matthew The Book of Matthew I was blessed by that song brother Jack uh I want to see him too and I hope that's your desire tonight praise the Lord so Matthew chapter 15 is where we want to go to we're going to read the first nine verses just say Amen when you're there yeah now it reads then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he curseth he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus ye have made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for the doctrines the Commandments of God the Commandments of men may the Lord add a blessing to his reading let us bow on the word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you in this hour that you have allotted us this time this time that you've ordained predestinated that we should be here to hear you speak to us Lord father God you know every need of every heart that is in his place Lord and father we come here in an expectation because we know you have a word for us Lord God I pray that you would meet every need and that you would have your way that you take control of every spirit that is in this place and have your way thy Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen may have your seats again it is a privilege to be here before you I wanted to take as a title tonight true worship the essence of the heart now you see the Jesus was having this conversation with the disciples and the verse I want to focus on this Mo this afternoon and Jesus told them that this people drive nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men now I think worship is a very essential part of our life as you see the title there the essence of the heart now if you if you if you look at the word essence it is the intrinsic nature or indispensable quality of something especially something abstract that determines its character that'll be the third slide now it's important that you realize that worship is the essence of the believer's heart in this hour that word is indispensable I like because it means absolutely necessary worship is absolutely necessary for the believer today now I don't want to get ahead of myself but I did have seven key statements I wanted to read all right I got that from my pastor now the first statement here says just take my word if you believe me burn every bridge of the world behind you the second statement says and you watch you follow God's direction there's only one key to each door that's right and no other key no matter how much it looks like God has no skeleton key just got one key God has a provided way this evening and no other key will work he is the door he is the key next statement says God has two laws the two laws one of them is disobedient to the word and die and the other one is obedience to the word and live if you want life this evening amen you must be obedient to the word the SEC the the next statement says it must not be your choice but it must be of his choice yeah next statement says every little jot everything you must be faithful in it's always the little fox that spoils the vine sometimes it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone I think that's very important because you can do more damage by not doing what God has called you to do when you are obedient to the word of God you allow God to have preeminence in your life the next statement says you have you've got to get in that right place before he will receive your sacrifice see you've got to come into it then the last one says here the right kind of unadulterated faith in that word will bring that seed to its life praise the Lord I want to read something the prophet says here and a message show us the father and it suffice he says there's something in the human heart that calls out of for worship somewhere no man is on Earth without worship he worships something now worship is not all we desire there is a provided way of worship did you know that see there's a way to Worship in a way in a right way to worship and the wrong way to worship I'm not trying to tell you which way to worship but I'm telling you there is a way that you have to approach God and if you do not come that provided way you certainly cannot come to God you see there's a lot of in our society today we we we find that man wants to bend the rules men wants to find these different outlets and avenues to to to worship God right but what happens is God has one provided way and one of the definitions of that word essence that I I want to go back and read There is it says one that possesses or exhibits a quality in abundance as if in its concentrated form you see your worship is not to be diluted your worship is not to be hybrid your worships to be pure true according to the word of God and it says equality in abundance when you are a possessor of the word of God you have an abundance amen amen now there's a lot of things true worship is when we see the conversation Jesus was having with the the Pharisees we we can see that they were worshiping the wrong way right we don't have to see we don't have to have an intelligent mind to realize they were worshiping the wrong way right their transgression of of men made them to transgress the Commandment of God and when you're sold out for God you will transgress your family you will transgress the traditions of your own life you have to be sold out man now one thing that worship is if you go to the next slide or maybe the next two slides but true worship is obedient true worship is obedient now the first time that I found the word worship mentioned in the Bible is it was associated with obedience now worship we know is also associated with an offering of sacrifice the first time I saw the word Worship in the word was associated with obedience if we go to Genesis 22 we find that God has approached Abraham after he's given Abraham a promise he's told Abraham this promise that I've given you I want you to go and take it and offer it as a sacrifice now if we can go there we'll read a few verses thank you brother Genesis 22 and it reads and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou love is and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he saddled his ass and took two of his young men and with him and Isaac his son enclaved to the wood for the burnt offering and rolls up and went into the place which God had told him Abraham is operating in obedience now the next verse verse 4 then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place so far off and Abraham said unto his young man abide ye here with the ass and I in the light will go Yonder and worship and come again and I thought that was striking to me because Abraham never said I ain't allowed we'll go and offer upon offering he said I and the lad will go in worship Yonder see Abraham knew what he possessed and he knew the God he worshiped his his purpose in his heart was to go worship His purpose in his heart was to accomplish the purpose of God in his life now Abraham's obedience to the word overrode his son being sacrificed and I think that's that's very key because when Abraham was getting ready to slay his son God had a perfect Ram in the bush whether that Ram come from well God already predestinated that Ram to be there Glory true worship is obedience to the word amen amen now another thing that worship is worship is diligent worship is diligent if we look at the the story of Job we can see how God had such a confidence in job Joel was there and Satan comes and and God comes and confronts Satan Satan says well you have a hedge of protection around him that's why he's worshiping you that's why he's he's he's he's he's here with you but you see God knew the end and he knew all that was going to happen God told him go ahead I'll I'll loose him to you that's right you you can have him for a season now I like this because after all that Joe went through after all that job lost the Bible says in verse 20 the first chapter of job he says then job arose and rent his mantle and saved his beard and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped and said naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return and dither and the lord gave and the Lord has taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and all this Joe said not nor charged God foolishly Joel worshiped job had Worship in him he worshiped in every circumstance the worshiper today is diligent worship is diligent right Proverbs 13 4 says the soul of the Slugger desireth and hath nothing but the soul of the diligence shall be made fat Hebrews 11 verse 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I encourage you Saints be diligent in the midst of such a way circumstances that are not favorable be diligent because God will provide a way of Escape another thing that true worship is true worship is present tense and forfeits your rights true worship is present tense a present tense worship will bring a present tense God on the scene every time now you want to you want to know and when you need something from God is when you're desperate for it right when a man comes before God in complete desperation God is obligated to move and I believe that I've experienced that God will move on your behalf when you have the right attitude God will move on your behalf when you are expecting God to move amen true worship forfeits your rights to his amen another example we can see here of true worship being present tense we go to John chapter 11 verse 20. and I love this story here because I can only imagine what it was like verse 20 it reads it says then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee you know brother Branham says when she made this statement she still didn't get in line yet she there was still something that she didn't catch yet when she made that statement and I thought it was astonishing because that statement paved the way for the supernatural now verse 23 says Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and he whosoever liveth in me whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth without this verse 27 and this is where she caught the vision she said unto him yea Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world and when she has said so she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master has come and call is for thee as soon as she heard that she was a rose quickly came unto him now true worship is present tense amen we know the story God Jesus Christ Rose Lazareth from the dead he could have called anyone by name the saying goes if he just said rise the whole grave would have Rose but he had to call Lazarus by name he knew Lazarus by name before the foundation of the Earth and he was able to he was able to respond to the need of that day now brother Branham says here in the message God's only provided place of worship he says now actually she had that right like you say about your short hair I'm an American citizen I can wear shorts do anything I want to do it's not illegal that's your rights but it's a sheep's right it's but the Sheep always forfeits his rights you if you are a lamb you ain't got nothing but wool he forfeits that all right that's his God's given rights but he forfeits it I have a right to join any denomination that's exactly right but you forfeit that right she forfeited all she had rights suing recognize the word of God manifested right before her he said I am the resurrection into life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth in me liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this see there was one more little she hadn't come in line with yea Lord believe I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God oh brother everything was ready to spark off then where have you laid him and you know what took place see you've got to get in the right place before God will receive your sacrifice you have to get in the right place before God will receive your sacrifice and I believe the atmosphere is what still breaks the Yoke today I still believe that God's anointing can Prevail over every situation now God's provided his place of worship is his chosen place of worship he's chosen a specific place and only one place to worship one place to put his name that's the only place of worship that has not changed now the the Pharisees and the in the scribes of those days they they try to go by their Traditions you see they were preaching a message that was out of season they were preaching a message that was past due but you know what makes it so what makes what we have today everything to us is that it's by revelation what makes what we have today everything to us is that we have the word for our day God has placed in us the gene seed to say Amen amen now as I move forward we go to Deuteronomy chapter 16. verse 2 it says Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there that's where God has placed his name the place that he hath chosen now you can sacrifice in any altar you can sacrifice in any place in any church but God has chosen a specific place to put his name and a place to worship the prophet says here then the father put his own name which is Jesus in the son and he's the way he's the door he's the house he's where God chose to put his name God never put his name in me he never put hit in a church he never put it in a Methodist or Baptist or Catholic but he put it in Christ the anointed Emmanuel and the name is the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down see when you are in God's provided place of worship no situation no trial is ever too big in the midst of your trial you can worship in the midst of your blessings you can worship in the midst of your ups and downs you can worship and I believe the true worshiper though the enemy may try what he will but God will always be pleased with the true worship brother Branham says here in paragraph 33 of the same message it says my action and the Vindication of God's word in my life shows whether I'm a Child of God or not now there's God's only place see it the only place that God will receive your sacrifice I don't know I don't care how sincere you are is in Christ and remember you say well I believe I come into remember the Bible says well the Bible whosoever believeth in Jesus Christ is the Son of God is saved shall be saved it says that but remember it also is written no man can call Jesus to Christ but by the Holy Ghost see you might say he is but he isn't until the Holy Ghost itself which gives life to the word proves it by Vindication that you are the Son of God that's the scripture that's the place I chose to put my name you shall not worship in any other gate but in the gate I put my name in then will I receive you unto my to my family God has to be your place of worship Christ is your provided place of worship the place he split his name now brother Brenham in this semester said the the son takes the name of the father but the bride also takes the name of the husband and you see as the Bride of Jesus Christ you bear the name of Jesus Christ that makes you the sacrifice the difference between your sacrifice and the unbeliever sacrifice is that your sacrifice turns into life you are the Living Sacrifice today you see our pastor been reading that present yourself as a as a Living Sacrifice daily Glory true worship also brings perfection true worship brings perfection obedience to God's word Christ was able to override all the place of sin in your life through obedience in God's word Christ had to come to a place where he fully surrendered where he fully obeyed what God's purpose was for him in his life now true worship I have here is God's desire embedded in you it's not your desires but it's God's desires living through you and I believe that worship is not something you give but something you live you live and worship every day you don't live and you you don't pick and choose when to live in worship the the True Believer wakes up in worship the True Believer goes to sleep in worship the True Believer closes his eyes and that do everything in worship that's true worshiper the true worshiper doesn't look back at what happened or what is going to happen but what is the true worship of this day now if we go to Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11. it says and every priest standard daily ministering and offering oftentimes the sacrifices which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin after he had offered one sacrifices for sin forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified and I think that's very important because God didn't need anything from us to make him better but we needed his sacrifice to make us perfect I was having the conversation a few weeks ago with a Jehovah's witness that came to my home and I was in the middle of work and they came they had a few questions they were looking to witness to me and and and and there was no doubt that there was a beautiful atmosphere it was me and two other young men and you know after well they want young men they're a lot older than me but it felt like I knew a lot more than they did but after we finish our conversation maybe it was almost an hour long and I thought I was gonna get in I thought I was gonna get in trouble about my job they're going to ask for me but we got into the word in such a way where they begin to pull and I began to just tell them what the word says the gentleman walked away he says young man I've never seen uh someone with as passionate as you are about the word and that says well I thank God for it and he says you know I've never felt like I had to feel different about John 3 16. that God sent his only son and he told me that you know that scripture still means everything to me today because God would send his only son to die for me and I know he believed that literally but I told him you know it means more to me because God didn't just send anybody but he came and took my place and I believe God has come and took our place today you see when we are in true worship we can identify with the same sacrifice God dwelling in US and we in him amen now I have here when you have so much of the world in your life it numbs your heart towards worship now what is it that we have to get rid of unpack like the word says now again when the word when the world is so when you're surrounded by the world it numbs your heart towards worship our attitude towards worship is is what makes the difference well you used to get from worshiping you don't get anymore but the worst but the more you worship the more of God he pours into you the more of God himself he pours into you now the word says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he see your heart is the nature of of of your worship how much of a surrendered heart you have towards God towards his word and in closing I have this the enemy the enemy may try to get you out of worship but he can never get true worship out of a real believer he may try to get you out of worship but he'll never get you worship out of you if you believe his word if you are grounded in this word then you'll realize you are born to Worship You Are Born to praise God and we know um I couldn't speak of worship without reading this verse says book The Hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and as I close here I would like to say that when Jesus was having this conversation with the with with the woman at the well there she tried to make worship a tradition he said our fathers worshiped in this mountain our fathers Worship in this mountain so she was following a tradition but Jesus by being there and and Discerning her heart she got to a place now we could read it together here now it says this is John 4 19 it says Jesus said unto her woman believe he believe me the hour cometh we need shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he present tense Jesus Christ was revealing to her that true worship was present tense that she had to believe her the word not for her father's day not for her grandfather's day but the word for her day she had to believe the word for her day and by operating in true worship It produced something out of her that was uncharacteristic and her began to flow the Fountain of Life and her began to flow the desire to want to others uh uh tell others about the word and her with all these things it goes to save and as the disciples came and Marvel that they were that he talked to the woman yet no man said what seek is thou why talk is without with her the woman then left her water pot you forgot what she came there for and went her way into the City and said unto the man come see a man which told me all things that ever I did it's not this to Christ she went from saying that are are you the prophet to are you the Christ now it allowed her to be separated from her Traditions she went from tradition to Revelation from denomination to Deliverance and I believe that's what the word has called us in this hour to be in in a place where we can worship the father and spirit and in truth to have true worship and I say this the enemy try to take me out of the pulpit but he can never take the pulpit out of my heart God bless you [Applause] oh praise the Lord uh certainly appreciate that uh sermon tonight there from brother Jerry uh true worship the essence of the heart and um you know that's that's just just many many points that he brought there it's not something you give but it's something you live and um no matter what you're going through you still Gotta Have a Heart of Worship um I just I just I just I just I just I just love God I love God and as he said there the enemy tried to take him out the pulpit but he couldn't take the pulpit out of him you know when when you were going through God will still speak to you and uh he will he will minister to you in ways that you never thought and sometimes you don't realize how God's going to use that uh but God always going to get Glory amen amen God always going to get Glory so brother Jerry God bless you amen tonight
