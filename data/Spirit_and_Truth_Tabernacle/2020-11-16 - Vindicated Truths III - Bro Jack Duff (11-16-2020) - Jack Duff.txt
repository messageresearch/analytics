make two quick uh three three things that i'll mention i want to thank god for having brother brother aaron and brother joe crease with us amen this morning good to have them in from uh indiana kentucky amen we certainly appreciate uh them coming to visit and um and i told you all before when brother aaron comes he's on business got business to handle so amen it's good to have him here um i also want to say uh thank you for everyone that gave towards the turkeys um you all uh exceeded expectations and uh and i want to just say thank you i believe some families are gonna be blessed uh by what you all uh have decided to do and and amen i feel like the lord is already working uh there is a um a gentleman there that came to assist us this week and and um you know it was so good all the saints that came out to help this week it was a real blessing just made things go a lot smoother and now there's a gentleman that just came out and he says uh you know i just really like what y'all doing they say i'm coming to church and you're supposed to be here today amen but that's all right we're going to keep showing up and uh and just let the let them just keep getting poor just getting pulled just getting pulled we still got to reach people right amen and i think one of the primary reasons why we are still here we haven't taken a raptors because we haven't found the last seed so we have to do our job to get out there and find that last seed that god has and we don't know if they're right here in our city but let's do it we can amen for the for the lord so thank you for your giving of the turkeys amen for the turkeys i really appreciate it and also uh next month um december 12th and 13th i have been invited to come to go to um house of fellowship in um mayaka or sarasota area but brother danny asked me to come for a saturday night and a sunday morning service there on next next month and we went to celebrate sister sister brown betty brown her birthday she turned 90 years old on yesterday and uh you know just uh you know he saw me there's like brother jack you know we got things scheduled looking forward to you to come say but just let me know how many saints are gonna come as well so i said okay brother i'll i'll make mention of it and we'll see you know what what what happened so if you desire to go and be a part of that it'll just be one night of hotel stay it's just that saturday night but if you desire to go he's not having like a really big meeting uh you know you understand with the the the the conditions of the pandemic a lot of people just not having big meetings but uh still want to have some fellowship right and uh you know so we uh you know he asked me to come and and i felt that well you came for us in february right so we have to return the favor praise the lord and and i do want to let you know he actually came here during the pandemic now we just it wasn't announced by the media and and everybody but the pandemic was happening on way back then pandemic probably started actually you know it's 2019 it started well it's called covet 19. it started in 2019. amen so and we was worshiping even in the midst of it only thing changed is when the media start propagating right that that's when things really got that's when we started doing all kind of different things you know because the media had you never heard nothing you'd still be going on doing what you were doing right and it's okay i mean it's good that they give us something but sometimes you got to be careful because they do want to control you with the information that they decide to give you all right amen but we got something greater than what the media got we got the word of god amen and we we're going to do that so if you desire a man to go and be a part please let me know i'm gonna have to try to let him know this uh this week just what our plans are so if you desire to be a part of it just pray about it and um you know if you feel a spirit to to go and be a part of it let me know if you don't it's quite all right we have church here too you know so uh either way but we we thank god and i know that we're gonna be having a lot of visitors passing through here and everybody like to come south during the during the winter so we're going to have a few visitors passing through i know brother john i'm sorry brother paul lafontaine he's planning on passing through sometime soon and amen and i'll be looking forward to that brother trevor be passing uh sometime soon we'll be looking forward to that and god just uh god is good god is good so uh just keep those things in mind if you don't mind let's go back to our scripture here in john chapter one i trust today we will be able to bring a close to just this portion of our journey a man uh we've been stepping into a vision and you know i've been uh praying uh share with you all uh about the uh dream that a precious brother had there in um uh brother carlos uh there in south america and you know that that dream um you know of him not being able to pick up uh the rhythm and then um sister birds went to the piano that that that's god right and and i know that the the enemy is gonna fight those that were part of the vision but the the thing of it is if you are part of a vision you can't get out of it and let me put it this way if you're a part of the vision there's no substitutes right it's your place it's your part and if god said that you were supposed to be there then you've got to come to it i don't know how it's going to happen but you are a part of the vision right so i want you to pray for these families that were part of that vision god know what he's doing right amen and and now it said they that he initially couldn't catch the rhythm right initially he couldn't catch it right but he's a musician and eventually that musician gonna get it glory to god somebody all right eventually eventually musicians gonna get the rhythm so you know i'm just praying that god will just you know let those that that's a part of his vision come into uh their place that's that's what i'm looking for so keep those families in prayer amen uh this has been a supernatural year amen a supernatural year and we're still dealing with supernatural things last sunday was supernatural praise god oh lord let me try to read this but uh uh i i mentioned to the church i said now the devil ain't gonna like this and i said the devil gonna fight some of y'all as soon as y'all got out of the church y'all had a fight all right and some it came later in the week but i hope you realize that we didn't just stop at the fight i said we also expecting victory and i need you to understand one of the greatest weapons you got brother troy told us come in here and reload reload your weapons right so so so and last week we were given a weapon and i hope you used it when you came into contact with your trial the weapon that you were actually given was to open your mouth so when the thing come against you you come against it how with your mouth your mouth will change the situation what you allow to come out of your mouth and what the lord told us is open it wider and wider and wider oh god there's a lot in there i i there the scripture hit me you know and i'm gonna get to my message here in a second i got y'all standing up i'm sorry uh but but uh but but the scripture hit me uh i believe the prophet told them told the king say now uh shoot some arrows out the window come on somebody say shoot the arrows out out the window you know cause it's gonna represent something and they say now get the arrow and after you get it break it on the ground just break it and so the man took his he struck it they say break it as many times and get upset and break this thing man so he took it he struck it struck it uh twice and i think he got it three times and then he just stopped he just just stopped or the prophet looked at him man you should have broke the thing more than that say this was representing something you didn't catch it and what i'm trying to say is you should have spoke more than that it was representing something and you didn't catch it church hallelujah somebody amen open your mouth wide and wide and wider [Music] i mean the devil came at me with a little trial there this week and i said lord have mercy and and as i was driving back from uh saying augustine yesterday it just the holy spirit hit me said they say i told you open your mouth water yeah you got this trial yeah but now speak to the trial speak to that trial i started speaking under the anointing i'm speaking according to what god told me this told me to say right he said open your mouth why did he say that's what he want to do i'm speaking to it now how every coming line has just come in line when god said let there be light that there you go that's it's just that simple how light got there ain't my problem i ain't even trying to figure it out all i know is that there was light [Applause] and how god gonna turn this around and how god gonna turn that around brother ain't got time to figure that out i'm just speaking that it will turn [Applause] amen church glory to god [Applause] hallelujah so i'm just i'm i'm just blessed and i know the devil don't like me and i don't like him so i got mutual feelings [Laughter] all right so let me try to read a man uh here i want that john 1 is where we've been reading from um we've been on a portion of our journey of stepping into the vision uh this year god has given us this series and we're coming to the end i didn't know it was going to last the whole year i didn't know that when i started preaching in january but god knows all things and and he's just been giving us the inspiration and we've just been following it and um i mean i think 2020 was a perfect year for a message about vision all right so i'm grateful uh for that uh here i'll just pick up um verse 29. you know they were asking john these questions while he was baptizing wanting to know if he was the elijah um that prophet you know and he answered no and they're like well who are you say i'm the voice of one crying out in the wilderness as as spoken by isaiah now he's telling where to find it that in the words uh but they're they're having a problem with um just being open to that scripture they're looking at the other ones but that scripture they didn't want to be open to so uh here you know we we have similar issues today people don't want to be open to certain scriptures uh but uh but nonetheless is being fulfilled and um uh here i'm picking up in verse 29 uh you know it says the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world now i want to tell you something jesus came to take away your sin praise the lord amen if you are here today and you living in sin jesus came to take away your sin all right behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit this is what john said now i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it'll bold upon him that's john's testimony right and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on praise god that's so that's so critical to me i thank god for the dissension of the spirit last week but it's got to remain it's got to stay already god said and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost amen if you've been baptized in water that's great but we want to see you baptized with the holy ghost right and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray oh glory thank you jesus father we thank you for the uh privilege of coming into the house of god thank you that we can hear uh the word of god we can enter him to fellowship uh and end him to worship thank you for these these great things it's just something about coming to church that changes uh whatever we're we're going through and what we're facing what we're dealing with it's something about just being able to get into the presence of the lord you just feel like everything um just work out just fine and uh god i just appreciate that um i can fellowship with saints of like precious faith i appreciate that lord we can gather in this little place and and just enjoy your presence but god we realize that as we come there are different burdens and different hearts there are different things different trials that the people face since last week we realized that and lord that that weight comes into the house of god but lord we are making an effort to lay aside every sin and every weight that so easily besets us and sometimes lord it might be a push to say amen it it might be uh it might be a sacrifice to lord just to persevere but i pray that you give strength to the people god that they would break through the barrier that the enemy has put before them lord these are nothing but scarecrows amen uh scarecrows are trying to stop us from going into the field and getting the beat have been planted but oh god we press beyond the scarecrows and we're going to enjoy the presence of the lord hallelujah father we just trust that you would just take control over every spirit and father your holy spirit would have the preeminence and this service god we release you to have your way satan you are not welcome here hallelujah you're not welcome here and amen before we even get started in the sermon we are serving you your eviction notice praise god amen it's time for you to leave amen you're not welcome here lord so we just invite your very presence to have the preeminence amen in this place even now god in jesus name we pray amen and amen the lord bless you you can be seated in the presence of the lord amen we are continuing our journey with vindicated truths vindicated truths uh praise god um and you know we just want to just uh uh get into this just a little bit uh uh last week the lord just kind of put in my my spirit just to really put a lot more emphasis on the lord jesus and how he was vindicated his his birth was actually spoken of in scripture uh his death and what happened at the cross i didn't say this last week but his death was even spoken of in scripture right in the book of isaiah it talked about him dying between malfactors right so here they thought it was um you know just happenstance on the day that jesus actually died and he goes and there's two thieves on the cross now isaiah didn't call them thieves isaiah called them malfactors right amen right so so here these two thieves on the cross they are they're actually fulfilling the word of god by dying right next to jesus on that day it was not happenstance it was not amen by chance but it was the fulfillment of god's word sometimes things happen in your life and you don't realize that all you're doing is manifesting what has already been written amen that's why you have to look at your situation i don't care what it is i i say i don't care what it is amen it's it's categorized as a thing right right and since it's categorized as a thing we put things in buckets you understand amen we put things in buckets and the bucket that i have on my desk is all things work together for good to them amen that love god unto them who are called according to his purpose so we have to we have to rise up above our things amen praise god my thing does not control my praise i'ma say that again my thing does not control my praise my problem does not control my praise my situation does not control my praise hallelujah amen only he is worthy of my praise glory to god church amen i didn't come to church to glorify my problem come on church i come to get something from god something that'll change the problem something that'll change the situation hallelujah all right church amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah glory i mean if if there was ever a service that the whole church should be on fire amen it should be this service especially after what your eyes witnessed especially after what you experienced if there was ever service for people to be on fire it's this service right here hallelujah church all right all right all right so we found out a man a few weeks ago god always vindicates the truth amen always vindicates the truth i find it quite amazing that we're preaching vindicated truths and god comes and vindicates his truth right here amongst us amen uh when when god vindicates something he is actually clearing all suspicion amen uh i mean there should be no more questions uh when god amen vindicates it it just it settles everything glory to god right amen uh we found out truth will stand the test of time truth will never change uh truth will gain strength under pressure hallelujah glory to god so so you know we're just kind of going back over a couple of things that we uh that we hit uh here in our journey and i just want to kind of bring us forth we put some emphasis on the lord jesus on last week we the first week we talked about john the baptist and you know when and as we read this scripture here in john chapter 1 uh when when jesus came to john praise god it was actually jesus vindicating who john was glory to god it was a vindication because uh here we got the word which is the lord jesus himself coming to the prophet praise god amen so so when jesus shows up at john's church amen it's actually vindicating john's ministry that the day before john had all kind of questions from all these other religious leaders said who you are what is this and i mean what ministry that you uh that that you have what is how do we identify this in scripture give us an answer well jesus comes along and vindicates who john is and by john having the privilege of baptizing jesus john actually and also seeing a vision that who he sees the spirit rest in a bottle that is the son of god john amen vindicates who jesus is oh i love this church i love this so let's go on a little further amen in this i want to pick up a quote my maybe a couple quotes here uh just to just to uh set this up this this first one is gonna come out of uh pergaming church age and um um uh this is the vision where we're still in uh where the angel was told uh the angel told the prophet pick up your pen and write we're still in this vision so this is a portion of it uh brother branham says this this is what he wrote that the angel told him to to write said the last day messenger uh will appear in god's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for israel is in the homeland glory to god amen uh it says and any time now he will come according to malachim at 176 2. so he will come according to malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated which means pointed out uh pointed out in the word revelation 10 7. so here we all if it's indicated it's in the word then we just got to look for this to be manifested because it's it's it's a promise right so it says pointed out in the word revelation 10 7 and god will vindicate his ministry i like that statement yeah here's here i want you to get this this is something to underline god will vindicate his ministry that means that means god will settle all suspicion look i don't have to settle the suspicion i don't have to answer your questions right if you got questions ask god because god is the one that indicated in the scripture that he was coming oh hallelujah amen i'm not the uh the the the the the lawyer of the message i just happen to be a believer hear the quote i mean the angel the lord say pick up your penis right now angel's telling the prophet god will vindicate i love it god will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did elijah and be ready for the mount zion showdown now i want you to catch that because hey man when you read that same quote over in uh uh um uh uh my the spoke words original seed he called it the mount zion rapture [Music] so what i want you to get is that the showdown like it was in the in the days of elijah when it came in and said uh you know the god that answered by fire let him be god that was a showdown hallelujah and elijah found himself standing alone amongst all these uh uh make-believe prophets all these uh jazzy bell-raised prophets oh i can go on that you coming out the denomination system your jesse bell raised prophet praise god amen it's the truth any high amen but here he stands against all them and at the showdown god proved whose side he was on when elijah laid out that altar and put his sacrifice up there and god came and answered by fire amen it god vindicated elijah now how are we going to get right here here this this this prophet is coming and he's got he preached the truth as did elijah and be and be ready for the mount zion showdown which is the rapture this message is preparing us for rapture now let me also go a little further i read it to you last week i won't i'm i'm gonna go back to that real quick in a second but i read it to you last week uh we we are living in a time of vindication justice the last election was actually a vindication that something that the prophet spoke 87 years ago and i know there are some people that just ain't ready to accept it i understand that and and and let me just preface this i'm not on either side i mean i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm just that's just the way the lord did me this is the way he made me when i had the the opportunity at 18 years old i'm in my 50s now well 18 17 18 and i had the opportunity to register to vote even back then i didn't know what i know now but i did not register as democrat or republican back then i registered independent and i'm still independent so it don't bother me either way praise the lord i won't i've got to put that that disclaimer out there it don't bot whoever come to the white house is actually fulfilling scripture so i got one prayer even so come lord jesus and i and i'm gonna tell y'all something i'ma just i'ma just have to put jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so before jesus returns again it has to be like it was in the bible amen and i'ma go a little further your vote can't stop a prophecy [Applause] even if you don't vote you can't stop prophecy so for me i look at prophecy above anything because prophecy has been vindicated right before my very eyes and hear a prophet come along and tell us now these are seven things that's gonna happen before the lord returns he goes on uh he actually gives us a magnifying glass on top of what jesus said praise the lord i'm watching what the prophet saying i i look i ain't watching nothing else but what a prophet saying all right church so if six of the seven have been hit then where how close are we then how close are we praise the lord i mean we're close enough for you to stop sinning we're that close for you to stop sinning praise the lord amen get your life right with god i'm going further in this quote many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth right when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called god's truth by deceivers so here's the aim to tell us that we got to be careful that we got to watch these two spirits in the framework of the church you know and and and the other thing when you're watching this now um when you're kind of watching satan you got to look at them from a religious angle right come on church right and when we look i mean don't look at no devil with no no no pitchfork and two horns that that that's a that's a nursery rhyme or something that i mean this devil is slick praise god amen he gets involved in church so you got to watch him from that angle hallelujah hallelujah people want to go to church amen where the pastor won't say nothing to to come against the i mean to come against what's going on in their life they they want to church that it's just love let me tell you if your pastor called out your sin it ain't love [Applause] amen amen praise god because love is corrective all right all right and it's not just a pastor any minister to come up here and call something out amen it's correct of love supposed i mean the word supposed to do that all right let's go on a little further yes yes the word will get all up in your feelings yes it will but it's only to help you that's all that's all that's all it's just to help you i'm going further later to see a church age i got to try to get to something if i can here today let us see in church h um we see john in scripture we see jesus in scripture uh but we also i was telling you all on last week and you can just line this quote up and later see in church age paragraph 3 3 27 1 i'm coming to it uh i was telling you all last week brother branham said now when uh john and jesus were actually standing there in um in the water and john was baptizing jesus say here was the two most important people on the earth standing there at that time greater than the king greater than the the priest the high priest the two most important people on the earth was standing in the river at that time the jordan river praise god right and here god was vindicating john's ministry and john is also vindicating jesus because he said the the same god that sent me out here and told me the one that you see the spirit descending on and abiding that's him that's the son of god john got a little discouraged after he went to prison praise god hallelujah that's the way some of us we you know after we went through a little trial this week we got a little discouraged hey man we got a little discouraged with the mystery with the trial don't get discouraged get encouraged get encouraged glory to god that's the time to give god your best praise i mean when when praise demands a sacrifice i'll worship them it's it's easy to worship god when everything's going well amen crazy i mean it's just so easy to have a big smile but when you're on the stream when you're under struggle a little bit a little pressure on you and i'm gonna tell you something a man a man is what he is and a woman is what she is when they are under pressure [Applause] the devil found out a long time ago about me when i'm under pressure i praise oh come on somebody when i'm under pressure i praise glory hallelujah all right now uh i'm going i want to go a little further here let us see in church age this quote says now this message of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 so now he's supposed to be identified in the word we're finding him in the word malachi 4 says it revelation 10 7 says it all right now this message of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so that's brother branham's ministry turn our heart amen of the children to the father to he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10. and he also tells us what it is which are the revelations contained in the seven seals so if you want to know what the seven thunders was go back and listen to the seals every seal amen was revealing uh what god was trying to say in those thunders my god each seal was revealing that all right it says so there he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so now he goes on a little further in this in this in this quote and i just want to keep reading he says i want to make one more comparison hallelujah between the latest in prophet messenger and john the prophet messenger now remember i read to you amen out of scripture on last week how um the when when john got a little discouraged he sent his two disciples to jesus and he's and while he's in prison he's saying just go ask him are you he or should we look for another and here they come and and jesus already knew what was on their what was on their mind and i'm giving you a prophetic view of this scripture because brother branham tells us that jesus told them just sit in service and watch what happened in service then we'll talk about it after service hallelujah so here they come and amen and jesus has a prayer line glory amen and then elaine began to walk the blind began to see amen the dumb began to talk people were healed and at the end of the service it goes to john disciples say just go tell john i know y'all got this question am i here should you look for another he didn't even say yes or no to the question he said go tell john hallelujah to the lamb of god go tell john the blind see the lame walk the dumb here amen i mean the deaf hear the dumb speak he said just go tell john that why because the manifestation is the interpretation and the vindication amen glory to god go tell john what you saw and john got a peace in his heart on his way to dying but got a peace in his heart that this thing was settled this is the one i just introduced the messiah now let's go a little further here let's go a little further amen here the the uh in this statement amen is being made it says uh uh the the i want to make one more comparison between the lattice and prophet messenger and john the prophet messenger who preceded jesus's first coming oh the statement that i want to tell you there my god the scripture actually said that there was none greater than john there had been none greater than john jesus said there had been none greater than john and brother branham say until that time hallelujah i read that for you last week yeah there had been none greater than john until that time now the reason we can say until that time is because john's ministry even though he never worked one miracle in all his life john's ministry was to introduce the messiah hallelujah if he had an elijah introduced him at the first coming then he's gonna have an elijah introduce him at the second coming because he's the same yesterday today and forever so here we get a uh we're getting a comparison of these ministries look at it now he says uh uh i want to make one more comparison between the leadership and prophet messenger and john the prophet messenger i meant uh 3 28 2 says in john the prophet messenger who proceeded jesus first coming the people in john's day mistook him for the messiah oh my they did the same thing for the prophet it says john 1 uh uh john 1 19-20 he says and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confess i am not the christ now this last day prophet messenger will have such power before the lord that there will be those who will mistake who mistake him for the lord jesus now brother branham telling us this and it's exactly what happened and i told you last week brother branham said a spirit will come into the land and cause people to act like this oh y'all better y'all better watch this i want to say that again a spirit will come into the land and cause people to act like this now there are spirits in the land that actually say that you don't have to have a pastor anymore there are spirits in the land that say we don't need evangelists anymore there are spirits in the land that take everything out of the bible when it comes to ministry and only leaves it at the prophet now brother branham never did that but you got to recognize the spirit when it comes if it's against the word then it's against the word it don't matter who's saying it your name don't matter your title don't matter amen if it's against the word it's against the word so watch out for these spirits there's a spirit of land that try to make brother brandon more than what he is brother branham was not jesus did not die for our sins praise the lord amen didn't rise again come on amen that's not that's not who he was he was a prophet according to scripture and it stops right there we don't worship brother branham here [Applause] he told us is that when you read the bible if you don't see christ in every scripture he said go back and read it again so we worship the lord jesus christ but i i'm trying to bring you forth so that you don't just get stuck at what happened in john the baptist's day god been moving ever since then all right now now look at this look at this it says this now this last day prophet messenger will have such power before the lord that there will be those who mistake him for the lord jesus and look at it there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this spirit make people believe that so when you see it rise up oh oh oh the prophet already warm he said the spirit was coming to make people do this i ain't gonna get caught up in that spirit hallelujah hallelujah all right he says matthew 24 verse 23-26 it says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect i tell you i'm dropping my weight on that one i i i am elect i can't be deceived says behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall send you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not it says but don't you believe it he is not jesus christ now the prophet is saying this about himself he is not jesus christ he is not the son of god he is one of the brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of god he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that what john received when he was the voice that cried i am not he but he is coming after me [Music] oh i just love it church so here we have a man a comparison the life of john the baptist who was the first uh uh he would be the prophet to the first coming of the lord jesus and here we have this layer to see a messenger which we believe was william aaron branham he is also considered a man uh the the messenger at the second coming of the lord jesus hallelujah we're not just following something crazy amen we uh we got we got purpose of what we're doing this is in the scripture can you point your denomination out in the scripture if you can't you better come out of her my people praise the lord amen all right so i want to just tell you something god always vindicates a man his his truth god always vindicates and i i want to say this i've got a couple statements i want to make god can speak god can write god can hear amen god can taste god can smell praise the lord amen i want to show you uh just here because uh when god speaks he's actually vindicating uh one of the statements that that i won't ha i won't i don't think i have time to read today brother branham said the old testament alone two thousand times the prophet said thus saith the lord so when a prophet is using thus saith the lord that is god speaking to the prophet and the prophet bringing it to the people when a prophet says thus says the lord it's not his thoughts it's actually god's thoughts so you want to take heed to what when a prophet uses stuff saith the lord hallelujah i'm talking about a vindicated prophet i know we got other people rise up and say that they prophets and some they give us thus saith the lord and the thing never come to pass according to scripture you supposedly been stoned amen you better thank god for grace hallelujah but the old testament say 2 000 times the prophet said thus saith the lord that's god speaking amen when it came down to adam in the very beginning in genesis 3 9 it says adam adam where art thou that was god speaking to adam hallelujah sometime you come to church and the word to be preached is god speaking to you as well amen i was also thinking here uh um uh how god spoke there in the beginning let's see here i got something that i want to i want to read here in a second uh on the back of your page get get the looking at the unseen get that ready for me uh another another place in at the very beginning where god himself spoke is when he came to king and god began to tell cain about an offering that he was making god began to talk to cain and say now you know if you offered me the same thing that your brother offered me i would accept it now i need you to understand something when god was speaking to king god was actually vindicating the offering that abel had made that when god spoke the king it was vindicated look look abel offered me blood if you would give me the same thing that abel gave me amen i'm vindicating that i accepted what abel would give me i'm clearing all suspicion you ain't got to try to figure this out you ain't gotta wonder what's gonna be acceptable you ain't got to worry about any of that kane i'm telling you exactly what i'm going to vindicate and accept but because he's serpentine he can't even accept vindication brother when vindication happened it settles everything i'm telling you ain't got no more questions i ain't got nothing to figure out when vindication occurs and i'm telling you when i'm when your brother just gave me this all you got to do is offer a sick go get another lamb and bring it here don't bring me no fruit from the ground i'm not taking that but but can't get mad he said he and then didn't even god told him he said now look if you don't want to give me this offering sin lies at the door sin is lying at your door no not now ain't that something that's that's that that's that's discernment i'm telling you what's already in your heart kane sin is lying at your door and maybe he's trying to figure out what is he telling me i don't know i know what i'm telling you and that god could have stopped what was getting ready to happen but he allowed it to happen the sin never lying at his door that cain said you know god won't take my uh god won't take my offering he told you what he gonna take and he still got upset god ain't gonna take my offer well i tell you what he gonna take my offering because abel ain't gonna be here to offer nothing [Music] and he went and slayed his brother and then god began to talk again but i'm let me say let me save that point oh jesus god begin to talk again hallelujah and this is where this is where uh um you know when oh let me just let me save that i want i want to just uh drop a little quote in here just for a second because i want to compare brother branham's ministry how god talked to vindicate his ministry as well god talked looking at the unseen e60 i'm sorry go back to e60 i write like a doctor amen uh here you know the brother the prophet says this praise him with all your heart get up out your chairs everywhere be well and healed in the name of jesus christ god bless you brother step out of these step out of the step out of there and go home make you well while you're standing on your feet and praising god how many wants you that raised your hand a while ago believes that god will hear my prayer for your salvation of your soul come walking down here now as we sing i will praise him i will praise him come on walk right down the aisles here now write down uh to receive jesus keep your hands up keep looking at the unseen that little pulsation in your heart come moving right on down is he pulsating to you and right in the middle of him saying all this his voice begins to change i want to tell you god can talk [Applause] and when god talks he is vindicating [Applause] i am the lord that raised up christ from the grave i am the one that sent the holy ghost i am the one that give the promise brother branham has nothing to do in this he surrendered his life to me i'm using his spirit i'm talking through his lips that's me i'm the lord come down come down come down and it goes right back to him having an altar call god was speaking vindicating his prophet borrowing his lips borrowing his life but it was all god in the midst of it that's why we worship god look here i ain't got to vindicate the message it's already been vindicated god himself has vindicated this truth moses went up into the mountain y'all gonna let me preach just for a little bit god can write i'm talking about god can write yes moses went up into a mountain for 40 days and god gave him the stones god don't use paper stones hallelujah hill right on your stony heart glory to god remove that stony heart but he gave him stones he just began to write the ten amen the ten commandments on these stones written by the thing of god moses come from out of this experience i mean just wow 40 days like this and and i just got stones that were written by the thing of god you would have thought that once the children of israel saw these stones they would have stopped doing what they was doing but here moses come down with stones vindicated vindicated writing from almighty god and the people are wrapped up in sin god so are so bad that you know uh moses let me just oh this devil he's a liar amen amen moses got so upset watching what the people's doing these same vindicated stones that he had in his hand he actually throws them down breaks the vindicated stones you want to know why because he had a temper problem and actually that's what some of our issues are we got a temple problem brother branham saying your bad temper is what's going to produce that cancer in your body it's what it will bring sickness on you your temper does it the doctor can't find amen what the cause is but a prophet tells us your temper brought that on you that's why you can't let the devil give you no temper and you know temple only happens when we talking to our spouses it's the truth and how when you get around the saints you all god bless you praise the lord god can see through that if you want to practice controlling your temper stop saying what you saying in the house [Music] come on somebody oh you got it down when you come to church you got it down when you go to your job you got it down when you're talking to your customers you don't let that side come out but god can see that [Applause] your best place to overcome is at home [Music] all right church praise the lord see we take each other for granted too much that's why we do that we just take one another for granted brother branham say remember that is that's that's that's that's she's the daughter of a king sister remember he's the son of a king that's that's god son and god's daughter that you're handling like that can i put it this way that's not your personal property it's god let me just drop this in i'm here now i might as well drop it in the brother uh one time shared a dream that he had and in the dream uh you know his wife wasn't saved and he was he was a christian and he was always trying to get her to do certain things and you know the lady won saved that's why she wasn't doing it praise the lord so he was just getting frustrated right and uh so one day he had a dream and in the dream he saw this sword come down in the dream he said the sword went at his wife and just began to cut this and cut that and cut this and cut that and then he said when he saw what the sword was doing he got so excited he reached up and grabbed the sword and he started helping the sword cut this and cut that and when he grabbed a hold of the sword he got pushed then he heard a voice god can speak heard a voice say that's my job it ain't your job to do the cutting it's my job and the sword represents the word of god as she reads the word she'll come in line with the word but that's my job not yours when you try to use it you make a mess you actually end up cutting the wrong parts praise the lord [Music] lord have mercy do you know god god designs us certain ways he gives us certain qualities for a reason and and we i don't like that quality than you who are you did you design me did you make me god made me oh lord had me born under a particular sign [Applause] now i ain't read no horoscopes but i'm telling you that you're even being born on a particular side got something to do with your character you didn't pick the time that you was born god knew what day you was going to be born and god put you here gave you certain characteristics for a reason [Applause] now yes you sometimes get out of control with your characteristics we all do you know some some people are built to just say whatever need to be said some people built that way others others just can't do it but some people just i'll that's it it's gonna come out god got folk in there in order to shape some of the other folk these stones got to come together come on church we building something here glory to god the stones are coming together and sometimes god give you a spouse to help shape you help mold you help make you praise god amen you the one said i do now you can't i don't know you said i do ain't no going back now praise god you in it till death do you part [Applause] [Music] i'm trying to get over here somewhere god can write he wrote on those tablets with moses moses threw him down and destroyed the tablets but god said i still can write moses now this time i'm not gonna even carve out the tablets i'll write on them but you're gonna cover my mind so now you know what he's doing he has to take the tablets up the mountain and bring them back down god wrote on the tablets in the days of daniel god wrote on the wall can i read a quote here out of questions and answers uh part four because some of y'all message believers already know where i'm at but let me just give you one because you might not know this one so let me let me just give you this one it was asking a question the other day we know why you first went to arizona was them angels appeared why did you return the second time you remember that question read it says how many remembers when i come back after uh out come back after that was was sitting there before dr level i believe he's in the building somewhere my wife and i was talking about arizona and about us staying here in jeffersonville and there come a hand on the wall and light and wrote with lettuce return back to arizona so the people asking why you come back the second time let me ask you a question if god wrote if god happened to write on your wall come back to arizona if god rolled on my wall i'd be first thing out of here going to arizona [Music] i would stop to answer no questions because i just heard not just heard from god i saw god right on my wall how many remembers that that's why i'm back there that's why i'm back in arizona god wrote on the wall come on back to arizona so that's why i'm here amen it says not knowing why i went back and when i got there didn't reveal what i should go back for and if i tell it then satan would block it sometimes you can't tell everything keep some stuff to yourself but that's how the devil get involved in it right it says if i tell it then satan would block it but he don't know my heart he he's not the word so he doesn't know my heart but if i speak it then he hears it see so now remember that so now here we got god writing to the prophet he said brother level was there his wife was there all these people witnesses amen that were there god writing on the wall hallelujah glory glory i got something here that i i need to just get i thought i put this in my in my notes but uh let me just grab something really really quick oh my lord my lord my lord um because god wrote again in brother branham's ministry is that right yes i got it here um brother branham taught these seven church ages that you got that we got on the wall right here i got a quote that i can read it but i don't i don't yeah let's read it let's read it let's read it the evening messenger let's read it we got time says uh says by the way has anybody ever heard them tapes on the church ages on the last time i had those ages drawn out there on the blackboard and the heavenly father knows this is true when i completed it with the best i could so after he taught it right he completed the teaching of the church ages i told you god come and vindicate god do his own vindicating you know what what what minister can can stand up here and and proclaim that brother branham's faults i got one question has god wrote anything on your wall after you finish preaching amen i mean show me how god vindicated you praise the lord amen all right he says uh it says uh the heavenly father knows that this is true when i completed it with the best i could under the inspiration that god would give me that angel the lord that you see in the picture many have seen that picture having you that light it came right down in the room before about 300 or 400 people this is all witnesses right it went right over on the side of the wall as a light like that and draw those church ages by itself we all stood there looking at it watched it draw the first church age the second the third and fourth fifth 6th and 7th amen it says now there's people sitting here that's a witness of that raise up your hand if that's so the bible says in the mouth of two or three witnesses everyone's sitting there screaming and everything else like we was doing last week everyone's sitting there screaming everything else uh as i said there now you wanted to see it everybody can look right at it 11 o'clock in the day now and i'm gonna tell you something that that quote is especially me brother jason watkins i've just happened this week you know i i was telling y'all last week the lord wanted me to go a particular direction last week and god blessed it and um uh i'm glad that i waited because i was listening to something brother jason watkins said he he grew up in the tabernacle went there for a number of years and he said when this happened when the angel lord actually drew the seven church ages on the wall this this this very thing that we're teaching right here we teach it in sunday school and i'm i'm not just teaching a man some some somebody got some sunday school lesson together i'm teaching something that's already been vindicated hear the angel lord come and write everything that you see on this chart brother branham wrote in was teaching to the people but then the angel lord after he finished preaching goes to the back of the wall 11 o'clock in the day and writes on the wall now you know after after that happened people said it was some of the lights from somebody's car that flashed on the wall 11 o'clock in the day you telling me somebody light splashed in the car on the wall and well if they you took now i'm gonna tell you take more faith to believe that somebody's call lights could actually throw out his chart it takes more faith to believe that i i'm good enough with the age of the lord wrote it out on the wall this uh brother that was sitting there in the church that day it says uh when it happened you know everybody's screaming and and and john he said but i was there he said but brother branham made a statement it's not here on this in this quote i'll finish reading this in a second it says uh he said brother brandon made a statement he says uh actually i know y'all see that on the wall but if you want to know where he is he's here with me he's here with me where i'm teaching this and they say and what he did was just project it [Music] he said all he did was just project it on the wall for you but i got it here and wait if you wanna if you wanna know where christ is he's here standing right by my side while i'm teaching this god vindicating it by projecting it [Music] i'm sitting here reading the quote from my ipad but the sisters in the back actually projected where's god god is up here not on the projector amen that's just to vindicate what is being spoken to you come on church oh 11 o'clock in the day standing right down the wall and draw it off off those church ages just with which uh just which just which much spirit uh and then the darkness to show that the spirit was smothered out and went through the dark age and come right back down again i want to say that i want to say that because some of y'all in your life you've gone through dark ages but you know the spirit could not keep amen i mean the the the darkness or the depths of satan could not keep the saints from coming out the dark ages you had your own personal dark age but you can't stay in the dark age you got to come out if you go read revelation 2 you'll see the whole depth of satan was all through the revelation 2. amen uh what was starting ephesus and then went to smyrna and pergamos and then thigh tear that dominating female it reached its full potential the depths of satan was there and that and also that thing of thy tear it was a thousand years of dark ages seemed like nothing was happening say but god began to give a confidence god began to give an anointing in that age that the saints began to rise up they rose up so much that luther got a hold of that anointing and that's when things began to change because revelation 3 it starts talking about luther's day luther wesley and then to get all the way down here to our day but here we reach the end just like third tier was the end of the first three ages hallelujah we're not leons we have reached the end of laodicea where are we we are the prize hallelujah somebody amen amen amen we're here we're here i want to just i want to say this they went through the dark age and come right back down again just the way i had it draw and we got it pictures of it and everything drawn hanging on the wall and there it was just exactly it must have been that spirit of the lord it must have been the spirit of the lord was satisfied that's why i was vindicated because the spirit of the lord was satisfied that that was completed because he come back and vindicated that that was right so when we're studying the church ages we're studying something that's vindicated amen this is not somebody's interpretation of somebody's you know uh just thoughts but this is vindicated truth that god has given us can i go a little further god can hear amen i told you you know when when when uh god spoke to cain say cain now look if you just give me what your brother gave me i'll be satisfied with that god vindicated what when god spoke he was vindicating the offering that came i mean that able offer so he said i i'll be satisfied i can't say um i got a way of fixing this problem i'm gonna get rid of abel and then god got only one church that he can come to we're gonna force god to come to his church and accept his offer my lord so here he goes and god told him saying i send life at the door god already knew what he was getting ready to do send life at the door and like i said he could have stopped it but he didn't he just let it go right on right play right on out so here uh uh kane gets up and he rides up and he kills his brother because of his offering i want y'all to get that some folk will kill the influence of this church because of what because of the fruit that's been produced from it i'ma say something people never throw rocks in bottles and sticks at trees that don't have fruit so if you're getting hit by a rock a bottle a sticker whatever somebody picked up it's because you got fruit in your life [Applause] hallelujah folk love to try to bring up your past that person died i can't live there no he don't live there no more don't live here no more don't let folk bring up your past amen go forward in your future praise god so god can hear so here you know he he's talking to kane and and uh and kane decides i'm gonna kill my brother i'm gonna kill him i'm gonna make god come to my church and accept my offering so then um kane kills him and god comes down again and he asks king he's talking again because god can talk it's like cain um where's your brother abel i don't know am i am i my brother's keeper say well i hear [Music] i hear his blood crying out from the [Applause] ground you telling me you don't know i know where he act you trying to bury this thing i know exactly what you did to abel and i hear his blood crying out from the ground i told you sin was lying at the door this murdering murder and spirit that you got came from your daddy amen god can hear because elisha is telling the king of israel secrets that the king of syria had in his bed chamber and the king was ready to kill everybody where despised that they said no no they got a prophet over in the land and he's telling them the secrets that you talk about in your bed team who was telling the prophet god can hear can i tell you something else god hear what you're talking about when you leave here oh my goodness we had a prophet in the land that told us uh the reason that them 42 bears killed them kids right them bears kill them kids he said because what the children what the parents were talking about hallelujah amen in their house the parents were talking about the prophet the parents were desperate disrespecting the prophet they didn't they didn't disrespect him in person but when they got home the things that they were saying about the prophet caused their kids to grow up with a disrespect so some of the manifestation that we see in your children is because of what you were saying when nobody was around when you thought nobody was around god can hear god can taste he went down there to abraham's house praise the lord and abraham said uh uh sarah get this together and get that together we got three visitors here and abraham called them my lord and when he came he showed up he got some some uh some some some meal together and he also got a calf get it get a calf real quick and dress it so i want to tell you god ate meat [Music] he ate calf god god can taste and he also told him in revelation 3 16 i wish you were cold or hot just lukewarmness i'm going to spew out my mouth so either live for god or don't live for god but don't be in the middle with this thing because god can taste god can smell genesis 8 verse 20 through 22. i'm coming home i'm coming home uh noah offered god a sacrifice after the flood and this sacrifice please god here in genesis 8 verse 20 says and noah building an alt unto god unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean file and offered burnt offerings on the altar and the lord smelled a sweet savor amen there in in genesis 8 21 and the lord smelled a sweet savor and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will i against might anymore everything living as i have done while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease so verse 21 told us that the lord smelled god can smell the lord smelled a sweet savor i want you to see another one ephesians 5 and 2. glory to god amen ephesians 5 and 2 let's just read that really really quick ephesians 5 and 2. there's another uh sweet savor that god smelled and he was very pleased with amen here in ephesians 5 um says and we and and walk in love as christ also have loved us and have given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor so the sacrifice that christ brought on the cross god could smell and it please god hallelujah how we thank god for this now i want to just mention a few things here i read to you early that the the prophet said amen and pick up your pen and write what he wrote down said god will vindicate this ministry of malachi for this ministry revelation 10 7. both of those scriptures pertain to brother branham's ministry amen um oh my my my my i love the fact as we read the scripture how jesus came to john while he was in the water and when jesus came to john while he was in the water jesus was vindicating john's ministry by john having the ability amen to not only just baptize jesus but see the spirit descending and abide on jesus john had the ability to identify and vindicate who jesus was the son of god i told y'all there was one standing amongst us whose shoes i'm not worthy to even lose this is the one that i was telling about notice where it happened in the water you already know because in 1933 brother branham was standing in the ohio river hallelujah baptizing people in the name of the lord jesus christ and when he got to the 17th person here comes the lord jesus down himself in a pillar of a fire and he spoke he says as john the baptist was sent before run my first coming your ministry your message will forf forerun my second coming here in in the water while baptizing the same way jesus did it for john the baptist is the same way he did it for his prophet that's that's representing the second coming of his amen the second coming of the lord the same way in the water it was vindicated amen they got articles all over the place saying mystic light follows this minister praise the lord when you're baptizing is there a mystic like following you see we talk about what god did even at his birth when uh when uh when uh the spirit lord came into the room and i think a dove or something like that flew into the room it was god vindicating his ministry glory to god can i give you another one one time hallelujah like elijah had to stand against him 450 prophets of baal glory to god brother branham went to chicago come on somebody and while he's standing there in chicago angel lord began to tell him say now uh they got a trap set for you and they're gonna do this and you know this room that y'all supposed to be in you're not gonna get that room hallelujah you're gonna have to go to another room he say but what they they got a trap and what they want to do is is try to uh pinpoint you on your on your on your doctrine or back baptism they want to try to tell you that you're wrong and they got a trap set for you brother ramsey said okay now notice not an angel could have told him that before he accepted the invitation but he went on down praised god to uh to to chicago and when he got there the brother that was hosting him just going through all the most he said brother i want to tell you something say brother the room that y'all got we're not going to be able to get what you mean we're not going to be able to get it we don't have this thing planned for you he said that room going to get canceled you're not going to get the room say no brother brandon i'm sorry brother you're wrong brother got about the day before the meeting got a telephone call i'm sorry we double booked the room we y'all gonna have to move the brother say uh oh my and he said he said so brother branham kept him saying i look him he said i told you wasn't gonna get it because the angel lord told me that you weren't gonna get that room he said but also the angel told me that y'all got a trap set for me i'm gonna come to the trap the brother say what he said he'd say okay okay he said he went got up there and got before the brothers and say okay i know many of y'all got uh some things you know in your heart about brother branham and and all this but uh i just need to let you know everything that he said was gonna happen has happened he told me that we weren't gonna get this room we didn't get the room he said he was gonna have to change it certain things gonna be laid out a certain way he took everything he said has happened he even told me that we had a trap set for so now i don't know about y'all but i believe everything this brother just said i believe it no no no don't sit down yet don't no no brother i'm coming with my bible brother brandon i'm grabbing this bible still to say now i know that y'all got this trap sent me for y'all got a question about baptism somebody take one of your bibles and come up here and disprove it i don't want to hear about your thoughts i want to hear about what this will say get your bible and disprove it little brother set their 400 i'm going to tell you if god is for you who can be against you see it's one thing to be talking behind somebody back it's one thing to be but when vindication comes it settles all the questions it's they said that 400 say you know what um first they didn't believe it now they say we're going to come to get baptized in the name lord jesus christ they never showed up i already told you the prophet was vindicated when he preached the seven church ages angel lord drew the same thing on the back wall that was god vindicating this prophet uh before brother branham preached the the seven seals another vindication he went up into the mountain by a dream and while he's up there in the mountain amen he was just up praying praise god and while he praying a sword struck his hand and he says oh a a sword brother adam said he said i've always been afraid of saying and he's hearing a voice because god can speak it say not a sword but the sword the king sword he said it's the king so he said oh that it was represented with something has that happened to you while you were praying praise the lord i mean we're trying to settle all this right i mean this this message has been vindicated praise the lord so here he's get the sword and before he preaches the seven seals so god god showed him and that when he had the sword the king sword he knew was the word of god he the prophet was carrying the word to the people god vindicated him also while he was there a man um preparing to preach the seals seven angels came out of eternity and uh made a picture a cloud in the sky life magazine packed a picture praise god and uh and when they got it they got it at a certain angle and they just blasted it all over the world it's this magazine article and brother branham come back because he's only talking to the bride he says now i'm not going to tell them but i'm going to tell you if you take the picture turn it to the right say you'll see christ and when and when the church turned the picture to the right that's exactly what we saw we were supposed to see christ not the prophet and the prophet said turn the picture you'll see christ hallelujah um amen we've been fellowshipping around this world that god brought us since that time god vindicated his prophet there's a brother that say oh god ain't in in this ministry god don't do these things he called himself dr best they got the best one they could find dr best guarding in this so brother brother uh brandon sir i'm not gonna argue with you all right brother bob's gonna say i i'll take it on 80 something years old say i'll take it on but the ball's worth brother brown said i promise me that you won't argue brother i won't argue i won't argue i just got a few questions for him and here uh dr best just standing there with his fisting in the prophet's i mean and in bob's word face and say i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna show you god ain't in this god ain't witness god so man you come too late too many baptists already been healed you too late doc the best said dr best i got one question for you it says uh the seven compound names of jehovah that are in the old testament do they apply to jesus brother random say that one question shut down the whole argument the man couldn't say nothing one question so brother bosworth said well i know brother branham's in the audience and if he wants to come up here and greet the people he can but there is no more argument it's done it's settled right doctor best had nothing dr bess hired a photographer to take all these pictures brother brandon come out the the the balcony come on down to the platform so god bless you saints just greeted the people didn't really say much but while the photographer was there he said i'ma just take pictures took all these pictures went back to his room to develop the pictures all the pictures he took of dr bess empty nothing on it but the one picture he got a brother branham was the pillar fire above brother branham's head can i tell you something god does his own vindicating is the pillow fight above your head do you got a picture like that not only got it can you send it to washington and they i mean they've got it for years they say people come to that that room there i've been there they come in that room and people wanted to uh we looking for this all over the world people want to know whether it's there i went it's there amen i know people trying to come up with well brother branham said it was going to be in hall of hall of critics you realize in order to get into what's the name of that place again library in order to get in the library of congress you're going to have to go through some critics so don't go to don't don't go to washington looking for the hall of critics and then say the message ain't right because you can't find the hall of critics what you need to just go get get connected with brother mike walsh he's a pastor up there he can take you right to where it is god vindicating his prophet i'm gonna line up this uh quote out of uh the anointed ones at the end time i got one more vindication because i got seven of them i got one more but i'm i'mma read this quote then i'm gonna give you the seventh one the anointed ones at the end time i want you to know this is sure it says and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declare to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man so when i come up and i say brother branham said brother branham said you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray now this last thing to prove that god vindicated the prophet let me read this scripture first corinthians 9 2. first corinthians 9 2. this last thing i want to say it right just like this paul said this if i be not an apostle unto others everybody ain't gonna accept me if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless doubtless you can't doubt it all the questions have been settled the truths have been vindicated he says yet doubtless i am to you he goes on to say this for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the lord and i want to say it just like this because your heart has been turned back to the word the message has been vindicated [Applause] amen let's pray lord we worship you in spirit and we worship you in truth vindicated truths how you've just been bringing us on this journey and lord we can just see your mighty mighty hand scriptures being fulfilled in the days of john scriptures being fulfilled in the days of jesus the first coming of the lord scripture is also being fulfilled in this day and this at the second coming of the lord we see it you have vindicated it you have proven it we can't leave hear god and and doubt it all we can do is leave here and live it god you are you're doing something in our midst and i'm grateful for what i see you doing i realize this is not the work of a man but this is a work of the holy ghost got my prayers that you would complete the work that you have started that you would get the glory and the honor lord from um from all that is going on here we want you to have the preeminence we want you to show us all how much you love us god you did so much at the cross but god you still continue to woo us you still continue to talk to us and you are the lamb of god that comes to take away the sins of the world you keep calling us out of sin calling us out of darkness and satan has tried to take many of us in and place us in a place of darkness where we just couldn't see any hope at all but he couldn't keep us there there was something in us even when we cried out for wrong even when we did wrong there was still something in us that knew that you called for us to do more so god i don't believe you'll be satisfied until more is actually given to you i want to take this moment while our heads about and our eyes are closed i am not going to take these services for granted i'm not going to take it for granted when we come together there's coming a day when we will not be able to gather here in this church because we preach truth these doors will be locked we realize that's coming it's been prophesied by prophet we realize that so while we're here and we can hear the voice of the lord i want to keep this altar open for anybody that wants to come and be prayed for that wants to repent lord i'm sorry for my sin i want to get right today god knows you god sees you god offers to you one more time an opportunity for you to make things right don't leave this church don't leave the presence of the lord going back to live the same life that you used to live you
