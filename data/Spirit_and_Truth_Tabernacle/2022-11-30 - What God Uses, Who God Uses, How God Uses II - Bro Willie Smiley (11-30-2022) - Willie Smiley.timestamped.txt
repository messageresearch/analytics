[0:00] foreign
[0:03] [Music]
[0:16] this evening I appreciate him tonight
[0:21] uh we want to start second second
[0:24] Corinthians 12
[0:25] from the a first it says
[0:28] for this thing I besought the Lord
[0:31] Thrice that I might depart that it might
[0:34] depart from me and he said unto me my
[0:37] grace is sufficient for thee
[0:40] for my strength is made perfect in
[0:43] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[0:46] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[0:49] power of Christ May rest
[0:51] uh upon me therefore I take pleasure and
[0:54] infirmities and reproaches and
[0:57] necessities and persecution and distress
[0:59] for Christ's sake for when I'm weak then
[1:03] I'm strong
[1:04] amen may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:07] reading of his word tonight
[1:09] uh we're going to be using our same
[1:11] topic that we use uh on on Sunday
[1:15] morning uh what God uses who God uses
[1:19] and how God uses and uh you know I think
[1:23] the more that you at least for me the
[1:26] more I look at a subject the more that
[1:29] that a subject kind of kind of opens up
[1:32] to us and you know as we we get started
[1:36] one of the things that we're just trying
[1:39] to buy this little thought encourage us
[1:42] uh because we we have we have thought
[1:46] patterns and things that we grow up with
[1:49] uh and mindsets and everything and uh
[1:52] and uh those things a lot of times it's
[1:55] just contrary to the things of God uh
[1:59] the minds the mind of God and the
[2:01] mindset of God uh when we look at
[2:04] scripture uh the greatest example that
[2:08] we had in Scripture it was Jesus Christ
[2:10] the work God coming down and manifesting
[2:13] himself in In the Flesh and by by
[2:16] looking at Jesus Christ his ministry
[2:20] uh and his life
[2:22] you don't see what he had the same type
[2:24] of thought patterns and mindset as we do
[2:28] as as as as human beings is that right
[2:31] and I think his life uh serves as an
[2:35] example for us uh the believer with the
[2:38] baptisms of mother holy ghost that you
[2:40] know we we supposed to be redeemed and I
[2:43] believe we are how many could say we
[2:44] redeemed tonight we we've been redeemed
[2:47] by the by the blood of the lamb and we
[2:50] we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[2:52] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think
[2:55] that the scripture is is bringing forth
[2:59] for transformation
[3:01] just holistically in our life I like
[3:04] that word
[3:06] holistically because uh scripturally I
[3:10] believe God wants us to be
[3:12] a scriptural Christians living a certain
[3:15] type of Life operate in a certain kind
[3:19] of way having a certain kind of mindset
[3:22] if if if we're going to be true
[3:24] Witnesses and I think that you know we
[3:27] we know that God God has never left been
[3:31] left without any kind of witnesses and
[3:34] so if we're going to be the right kind
[3:36] of witnesses uh we have to have the
[3:38] right kind of uh mindset we we talked
[3:42] about uh soundness of Doctrine a little
[3:46] bit on on Sunday morning
[3:49] um and having a basis for our stand
[3:52] right
[3:54] um like I often say I say things for a
[3:57] reason a lot of times and sometimes it
[3:59] rubs people the wrong way but sometimes
[4:01] you still gotta say it uh for me in in
[4:06] 30 years of preaching you just want for
[4:09] the church to be to be sound you want
[4:12] the church to be settled and and you
[4:15] don't say things I think some sometimes
[4:17] and maybe this will help because a lot
[4:19] of people may not know me a lot of
[4:21] people seeing maybe seeing me for the
[4:23] first time uh on YouTube and internet
[4:26] and probably say well that guy's a rough
[4:29] guy
[4:30] but but realistically I'm not uh uh I'm
[4:36] just trying to bring a message that I
[4:39] think that'll help us and stabilize us
[4:41] because I think if people would have
[4:44] lived in the days of Jesus Christ they
[4:46] probably and that's probably why a lot
[4:48] of people walked away from him because
[4:51] you know he said things sometimes that
[4:54] was real cutting sometimes he said
[4:57] things that were real hard could you
[4:59] imagine being Jesus's mama
[5:01] and that day when when she she lost
[5:04] Jesus and and and when she caught up
[5:07] with him you know after a while she said
[5:10] your father and I
[5:12] and and so he he stopped real quick
[5:14] right and said well wait a minute wait a
[5:17] minute you changing your testimony now
[5:20] you your testimony in the beginning was
[5:23] uh what was conceived in you was of the
[5:26] Holy Ghost and now you making Joseph my
[5:28] father he's he's like woman what you
[5:31] talking about you know I'm what I'm
[5:33] doing right now as a young boy I'm about
[5:36] my father's business is that right and
[5:40] could could you imagine you know how
[5:43] cutting that was to her flesh
[5:45] right to think that you know what I I
[5:48] bought this seed
[5:50] I you know he he he nursed and and and
[5:54] and all of this and then you know uh
[5:58] before people he would make a statement
[6:00] like this but what what what it was was
[6:03] the word was correcting the era
[6:07] right amen and I believe that with what
[6:10] we've been taught it the the word the
[6:14] words sometimes don't feel good even for
[6:16] me when when I'm not you know measuring
[6:19] up to the word of God and I hear certain
[6:21] things it troubled me but but I have to
[6:25] heal myself to it is that right and just
[6:28] ask God to help in areas because you
[6:31] know we're we're human beings and things
[6:33] of that nature right right but but it's
[6:37] not something that you know
[6:39] the word is not here and we're not here
[6:42] as a Ministry like we're we're attacking
[6:46] the people
[6:47] and and we're beating the people
[6:49] it's just that you know we all built
[6:52] different y'all know me I'm I don't
[6:54] teach the same way I I get noisy and
[6:57] loud and all of that and I'm a big guy
[7:00] uh and so sometimes people misinterpret
[7:03] that
[7:04] right
[7:05] instead of really uh entering into the
[7:09] spirit and trying to comprehend what
[7:11] what is brother Smiley really trying to
[7:13] say what is he trying to uh get over to
[7:16] us right uh they they look at all of
[7:20] those things and be like man that man
[7:22] going crazy oh ain't going crazy if
[7:26] that's the case you probably wouldn't
[7:27] have lasted in in the days of John the
[7:30] Baptist
[7:31] in the days of Jesus we you know what
[7:36] would it what what would it have been in
[7:39] the days of the Apostles these you know
[7:42] the the word of God just comes to
[7:45] transform us
[7:48] bring about bring about change not it's
[7:51] not an attack it's not to be offensive
[7:53] blessed is he does not offended it's
[7:55] totally impossible for me to be offended
[7:57] at the work right
[8:01] My Flesh might squirm like everybody
[8:04] else but I can't be offended
[8:06] because it's it's the preaching of the
[8:09] Gospel it's the thing that that uh
[8:12] uh uh that settles us right uh and so
[8:18] when we when we we're been talking of
[8:21] kind of talking about weakness right
[8:24] and so with with this thought I was
[8:27] thinking on on my drive over I was
[8:30] thinking you know we we gotta have
[8:33] something because it's just the way
[8:35] we're wide sometimes uh well we're we're
[8:39] this and I'm I'm weak and I'm
[8:43] insufficient and I can't do this that
[8:46] was that was the same mindset and
[8:48] attitude that Moses had is that right
[8:51] when when he met the pillar fire in the
[8:54] burning bush right and and God was
[8:57] giving him his commission we talked a
[8:59] little bit about this uh on on on Sunday
[9:02] morning right hey he felt like well you
[9:06] know what and I'm quite sure
[9:09] uh as a man realizing the first attempt
[9:14] at bringing Deliverance he probably was
[9:17] like man I bitterly fail
[9:19] and and I I was intellectual I was
[9:22] educated I was a military man right hey
[9:26] man I was I was in a place I was in such
[9:29] a he felt like he was in such a position
[9:31] that he could deliver the people through
[9:36] education and and Military might and and
[9:40] things of that nature is that right but
[9:43] uh all he did was accomplish is getting
[9:46] one dead Egyptian that right when he he
[9:51] was read he knew that from from uh a
[9:55] youngster up that he was a proper child
[9:57] he was special
[10:00] right and and that and that he was born
[10:03] to be a deliverer according to promise
[10:06] right but through human ability and
[10:09] human efforts he failed he failed
[10:12] miserably so I could have I could
[10:15] imagine from a humanistic standpoint you
[10:18] know uh uh you know you you meet the
[10:22] pillar of fire and and God starts
[10:25] speaking to you and and trying to
[10:27] commission you and you like bad listen
[10:32] you know who made man to speak
[10:36] right but like we were saying God wasn't
[10:39] really trying to listen to his excuses
[10:42] right it's like God God had
[10:47] predestinated chosen him Amen to build
[10:51] delivered is that right and see the same
[10:54] thing in this age that we're living in
[10:55] this this layout of sin age God has
[10:59] predestinated us
[11:01] right to be Overcomers
[11:04] to be different yeah to to live
[11:08] different to respond different to things
[11:11] right glory to God glory to God and so
[11:16] and so you know uh
[11:19] in the little message of perfect
[11:21] strength by Perfect weakness I think it
[11:24] it serves as something to to settle Us
[11:28] in in the Holy Spirit right
[11:30] uh give us a answer for the thing that
[11:35] plagues us right because we're emotional
[11:38] creatures come on Church
[11:40] right we're emotional creatures and and
[11:43] a lot of times we allow our feelings and
[11:47] our emotions to overcome us
[11:50] right
[11:52] you know I the little things even even
[11:55] in the scripture you know uh great man
[11:59] of God the Apostle Paul he was
[12:01] struggling because he had eye trouble
[12:04] right and and he he wanted Deliverance
[12:08] right he was like man I don't pray I you
[12:11] know Lord you know if there's any kind
[12:14] of way you know you'll do something for
[12:15] me right he was he was looking because
[12:18] he you know sometimes we look at those
[12:20] things and we feel like well if this is
[12:23] hard for me to get the job done
[12:26] but one of the things that even me I
[12:28] fail to realize sometimes when I'm in
[12:30] something man I'm part of a promise
[12:35] and I serve I serve a
[12:38] supernatural God
[12:40] you know my little mccoying cutting up
[12:44] it is cranking but I went to drive it
[12:47] over here I was all happy on the job boy
[12:50] why
[12:52] told me this morning she had a mechanic
[12:54] and uh
[12:55] he called me back in 20 minutes man I
[12:58] got your car cranking while he's ready I
[13:00] thought I'm like I'm on the job shouting
[13:03] around
[13:04] man I get in that thing
[13:06] it wouldn't go past 40. I was
[13:09] I was discouraged
[13:12] I was I was kind of discouraged but you
[13:15] know what God knows all things you know
[13:18] I was I was appreciating the brother
[13:20] what was his name Sunday
[13:23] Darren okay there I should remember that
[13:26] I got a cousin name there uh
[13:29] I will hold my I said if that brother
[13:32] could lay hands on on a on a vacuum
[13:34] cleaner
[13:35] I go lay hands over my car
[13:39] I went ahead I went ahead you know
[13:41] because you got to be crazy to do
[13:43] something like that
[13:45] right but if his wife vacuum cleaned
[13:47] still running in but uh and also I said
[13:50] well Lord you know the next person who
[13:52] works on my car trusted they find a
[13:54] problem they found that problem but now
[13:56] I got another problem
[13:58] right but you know what God God no God
[14:02] knows all things is that right God God
[14:04] is uh in charge of all things I had to
[14:08] drive my dirty dirty work truck but
[14:11] that's okay
[14:13] I ain't dirty I don't smell y'all
[14:17] I did baby put all the love
[14:19] you know a little clone so we're gonna
[14:21] be all right
[14:22] all right so let's let's kind of move
[14:24] forward right
[14:26] um because like we say uh
[14:30] by this it gives us some information
[14:33] to to settle these things when when when
[14:37] these types of thoughts come we got
[14:40] something to combat
[14:42] right these thoughts and in in the age
[14:46] that we're living in we need a man's
[14:49] spiritual information to combat cause
[14:51] we're in a real battle church this this
[14:54] this is the worst age of them all
[14:57] everything from the time of the fall all
[15:01] the way down through the entire New
[15:04] Testament uh uh uh history everything is
[15:09] right here at the end time fighting
[15:12] right two hundred thousand thousand
[15:15] demons been loose from the river
[15:17] Euphrates to fight against us is that
[15:21] right
[15:22] amen and so we we thank God that we we
[15:26] have information
[15:29] right to combat these things because I
[15:33] know different than anybody else I I
[15:34] have my struggles in in areas but when
[15:37] you look at these things it it's the
[15:40] thing that helps to to settle you settle
[15:43] your spirit right to keep to keep us
[15:46] just from being emotional wrecks
[15:50] keep us at the doctor's office
[15:53] right
[15:55] amen because when when your emotional
[15:59] these things affect your body and all of
[16:01] that so so I think by the information
[16:04] that we get from the word it it keeps us
[16:07] it keeps us settled
[16:10] right amen
[16:13] um the problem here in in a statement in
[16:16] perfect uh
[16:18] perfect Faith by Perfect weakness he
[16:20] says like there's so many of us likes to
[16:24] testify
[16:25] or to think that we're insufficient
[16:28] right
[16:30] and therefore we make that an excuse
[16:34] well I'm insufficient
[16:36] I have no education
[16:39] I have no ability
[16:41] I'm able to do this
[16:44] right I'm a sidebar here if if God has
[16:49] called you something to do something the
[16:51] ability was predestinated
[16:54] amen uh in you before you ever got here
[16:59] you you think about every prophet in the
[17:02] scripture they were ordained before they
[17:05] were ever even you know uh Jeremiah said
[17:09] he told Jeremy before listen before you
[17:12] was ever even in the water of your
[17:14] mother I ordained you to be a prophet
[17:18] and the prophetic ability was already
[17:21] there whether you can comprehend that or
[17:25] not the prophetic ability was already
[17:28] there
[17:29] right glory to God and so uh with with
[17:35] these things when we when we say well
[17:37] I'm I'm insufficient and I have no
[17:40] education you know and I I'm a living
[17:43] witness how I remember my early days in
[17:45] Ministry I was like Lord what in the
[17:47] world are you doing
[17:49] right what in the world are you doing
[17:52] I'm a high school dropout I'm not
[17:54] educated I don't have no formal training
[17:56] I haven't been to any Bible school and
[17:58] then you know only a few years into
[18:01] preaching with no real no real grasp he
[18:05] said okay I want you to take over Church
[18:07] you want me to do what
[18:09] no it's got to be somebody else and then
[18:11] you look around and you realize ain't
[18:13] nobody else
[18:15] this bill is set up all the time what
[18:17] why you know and then you want to
[18:20] question God why me God said you know
[18:22] what before you ever before you ever got
[18:25] here when you was in the streets running
[18:27] crazy
[18:30] I had already ordained for you to do
[18:32] something supernaturally in the
[18:34] Supernatural Realm right and and despite
[18:38] and despite your deficiencies right or
[18:43] your
[18:44] insufficiencies uh
[18:46] you're going to do the job because the
[18:49] the ability is there already
[18:52] by the spirit right it's it's already
[18:55] there
[18:57] sometimes I I remember this and I ain't
[18:59] no great saying good or nothing like
[19:00] that but I can't hold it to him
[19:03] [Laughter]
[19:08] the holy tune
[19:11] this time I ever I ever sung a special
[19:15] shocked myself
[19:17] now like you mean to tell me that was in
[19:20] me all the time when I was out there
[19:23] smoking blunts
[19:25] God said I hid it
[19:27] I hit it I hit all that
[19:30] right amen see so so when when we think
[19:36] when we think we're insufficient it just
[19:39] takes God to reveal to you what's really
[19:43] land there it shocks us sometimes the
[19:47] ability I'm quite sure sister Burrows
[19:49] never thought she'd be a songwriter
[19:52] right
[19:55] and look look at look at what
[19:58] songwriting has done and what singing
[20:01] his songwriting and the places that is
[20:03] taking up
[20:04] right but probably during the days of
[20:06] Peace was lying she probably ain't wrote
[20:08] nothing down on a piece of paper
[20:12] right but but but in the right season in
[20:15] the right time under the right
[20:17] atmosphere
[20:19] all of a sudden
[20:21] you you just writing you just writing
[20:23] songs that they singing around the world
[20:26] is that right glory to God
[20:30] amen so he he says so many of us likes
[20:33] to testify and to think that we're
[20:36] insufficient therefore we make that an
[20:38] excuse I have no education I don't have
[20:40] no ability I'm ability to do it uh do
[20:43] this and if you keep that up and do that
[20:46] in that way and keep going on like that
[20:49] then you can't amount to anything
[20:52] see
[20:53] it what is it what is he trying to do
[20:56] here change our mindset
[20:59] change the way that we think
[21:03] right change the way that we think
[21:06] see not not constantly going on I'm
[21:09] insufficient I ain't no good you know I
[21:12] ain't this because some there's there's
[21:14] people that lives a lifetime with that
[21:17] type of mindset real real negative
[21:22] right and and it's and it's real easy to
[21:25] do especially when when you you know you
[21:28] might be looking at other people
[21:31] right amen you you're looking at other
[21:34] people and them growing and they're
[21:37] cheering it and other ministers churches
[21:40] blowing up
[21:42] right and and you know sometimes you
[21:45] look around like but I'm struggling with
[21:46] 20 people where rich sometimes that
[21:49] might be all God gives you
[21:53] right amen he he might give this man you
[21:57] know because because much is giving much
[22:00] is required and and everybody don't have
[22:03] the same measure so so you you can't
[22:06] look at what somebody else got because
[22:09] you know those things that mess up your
[22:12] spirit right man he traveling around the
[22:15] country
[22:17] you know he's going he doing this and
[22:19] he's doing that just focus focus on what
[22:23] what God has ordained for you to do and
[22:27] the ability because see with what watch
[22:30] this with what God has ordained for you
[22:33] to do you're sufficient enough to do it
[22:36] right see you know like like uh people
[22:40] used to tell my wife
[22:43] what I don't know how you do it with six
[22:45] kids
[22:47] really see God knew some people couldn't
[22:50] handle no more than two
[22:53] yeah some people couldn't handle no more
[22:55] than one you see people you see people
[22:57] sometimes they got one child and they
[23:00] about to they about to lose their mind
[23:02] huh
[23:05] and and you know she she got six
[23:10] it's kind of like you know uh brother
[23:12] Banner he tells the story about the
[23:14] shepherd and walking through the
[23:17] marketplace with all of those sheeps and
[23:20] folks standing back like boy I know this
[23:23] feeling to be chaos no it's not no it's
[23:26] not they train they just gonna follow
[23:28] the shepherd right through dang I'm
[23:31] bothering that Daniel right you know I
[23:35] mean she was just built
[23:37] she was just built to handle six kids
[23:40] and come here children and her her
[23:43] quirky way of dealing with them and we
[23:46] could go we could go places we I
[23:49] remember times we would be sitting up in
[23:51] Golden Corral and little kids be tearing
[23:54] up this gummy bears all over the place
[23:57] and you know cake crumbs all over this
[24:00] like this and they just sitting there
[24:03] like little Troopers they just eating
[24:07] and the people around us be like when
[24:10] they leaving they dragging in Little
[24:13] Johnny like ma'am how do you do it just
[24:16] that and the other man man they made
[24:20] enough well they know better they ain't
[24:22] always like this I used to have them
[24:24] myself you know all six of them we are
[24:27] eating right hey but now when they go
[24:30] home that's a whole other ball game that
[24:33] home now is
[24:37] foreign
[24:42] you know it's the works
[24:44] but but it but in public but it's how
[24:49] you raise them y'all know what I'm
[24:50] talking about you know when when we was
[24:52] coming up you know all you needed was a
[24:56] look
[24:57] they ain't even have to speak
[25:01] that that looked terrified you
[25:04] like it because if she look again it's
[25:08] on and popping from there she might do
[25:10] it right in church
[25:13] didn't I tell you
[25:18] right I think I think we we get away
[25:21] from we get away from scripture and we
[25:24] intellectualize it and that's why we got
[25:27] all of these kids running crazy and and
[25:30] killing one another I mean you know we
[25:33] was talking today on the job because I
[25:35] worked with another pastor friend of
[25:37] mine and uh you know we we talk about
[25:39] our upbringing and and we were in the
[25:42] streets and things but you know you
[25:45] might get a dust up
[25:47] but you ain't really have to worry about
[25:48] dying
[25:50] but but
[25:52] here's the thing that I realized right
[25:57] um
[26:00] my mother's generation and her you know
[26:03] my mother's mother
[26:05] you know a lot of those a lot of those
[26:07] folks their parents took them to church
[26:10] if Daddy didn't go Mama went
[26:13] right I remember growing up in church in
[26:16] Jersey and um not the men didn't hardly
[26:19] go unless it was Mother's Day
[26:21] my dad and my uncles and all of them
[26:24] they didn't go I thank God my my daddy
[26:26] baby brother he he he he in church now
[26:29] you know but but when they were coming
[26:31] up they was not going to church but but
[26:35] you would see you would see my
[26:38] grandmother
[26:39] her daughters
[26:41] I mean cousins Galore we we raised up
[26:45] going to church you know uh the Bible
[26:48] said train up a child in the way that it
[26:51] should go right and so they did their
[26:54] part and but see what what has happened
[26:57] every generation has gotten away from
[27:00] Biblical principles so it it don't
[27:03] really hardly give the kids what's
[27:05] needed
[27:07] amen for them to survive in this age and
[27:11] then then you know you because it wasn't
[27:15] cute back in the day
[27:16] for young girls to have babies
[27:20] that wasn't cute
[27:22] huh it went it was those things weren't
[27:26] cute back in the day that's fine it's
[27:29] cute everybody got babies you you know
[27:33] and then and then with with no
[27:35] upbringing and babies trying to raise
[27:38] babies and and and
[27:41] look look what we got
[27:44] look look what we got and then without
[27:47] the only I'll say this the only thing
[27:50] that really I think saved save saved me
[27:52] uh
[27:54] is because I had something that even
[27:57] when I was in the streets I knew better
[28:01] I knew better because my my mother my
[28:04] grandmothers they they took me to the
[28:06] house of God and I went to Sunday school
[28:08] I sang in the choir I was on the junior
[28:10] Usher board right and so you know even
[28:14] though I was out there something way
[28:16] deep down you know in the back part of
[28:19] my mind you know when I was really
[28:21] starting to do the silly silly you know
[28:24] it's like boy Lord have mercy boy your
[28:26] Grandmama boy love you know and those
[28:29] things those things dealt with me I
[28:31] think
[28:32] well I'm I'm kind of getting off a
[28:34] little bit and but I think that you know
[28:37] uh if we if we could get degenerations
[28:41] to get back in
[28:44] to get back in God and the pandemic
[28:46] ain't did no no better cause it's less
[28:49] people not going to church than it's
[28:51] ever been in the property of the history
[28:55] right
[28:56] amen let's let's go a little further I
[28:59] got about 30 minutes
[29:01] amen but we we through our excuses we we
[29:07] want to see where we are sufficient
[29:11] and we're sufficient where God wants us
[29:15] we're adequate
[29:17] right in the areas where God wants us to
[29:21] be we have just enough
[29:24] to get the job done
[29:26] right whether y'all think so or not
[29:30] sometimes
[29:31] I think to live in this age we have what
[29:35] it takes to live in this age and be
[29:37] victorious
[29:39] to to be the standard right to be the
[29:43] light of of this age is that right glory
[29:46] to his wonderful name okay so so
[29:50] here uh
[29:52] he says we make the excuses and by
[29:54] excuses watch this
[29:57] wow see watch this God God knows who we
[30:01] are
[30:02] we're fearfully and wonderfully made
[30:04] right
[30:06] and and God knows
[30:08] our weaknesses and all of that right but
[30:12] God looks at those things in a way that
[30:14] we don't look at those things sometimes
[30:16] right see I I like this next statement
[30:19] it says God uses those very things to
[30:23] tackle the job
[30:25] he said what
[30:31] no no God knows us right we we're
[30:36] fearfully and wonderfully made can we
[30:38] say Amen to that right amen and so and
[30:42] so
[30:43] when when we're when we're just you know
[30:46] this efficient and and this and that God
[30:49] God looking at that thing and we can see
[30:51] it scripturally
[30:53] we could see several several Brothers in
[30:56] the scriptures when when when God called
[30:59] upon them to do to do things bye look at
[31:02] here man I can't get the job done I I
[31:05] can't do it you know
[31:08] the church was so in such a bad shape at
[31:11] one time that they wouldn't even they
[31:14] were ordained of God to be victorious
[31:17] right in the Book of Judges they they
[31:20] were ordained to be Victorious and and
[31:24] and to to fight battles and and overcome
[31:28] but they would they would they were so
[31:30] messed up in their understanding that
[31:33] they wouldn't the men wouldn't even go
[31:35] out and fight unless Deborah went with
[31:38] them
[31:40] come on
[31:41] that's messed up
[31:44] right soldiers
[31:47] ordained of God to be Victorious and
[31:51] they were like but we ain't going unless
[31:53] the prophetess go with us what
[31:59] could you imagine that
[32:05] I'm glad I went in that group
[32:07] I don't have much y'all like y'all ain't
[32:10] going to battle
[32:11] unless the prophetess go which is
[32:14] the judge of whatever her calling was at
[32:18] that time I know she was a judge right
[32:22] man that's
[32:24] that's backsliding to me
[32:27] right when a man won't
[32:30] want to step up and
[32:33] take his place
[32:35] right
[32:36] oh my okay he said God uses that very
[32:40] thing to tackle the job with he waits
[32:43] for us to get in that condition so that
[32:45] he can use us right
[32:49] we take the excuses and say well I can't
[32:53] do this I'm insufficient can't do it God
[32:56] takes the very thing to do the job
[32:58] that's true he says that's the reason
[33:01] why he chooses us God chooses us because
[33:06] God knows exactly what we can do
[33:10] right God knows exactly what we it ain't
[33:14] it might shock us the things that we do
[33:17] in God but but it don't it don't it
[33:20] don't shock God
[33:22] right it don't it don't shock God when
[33:25] you when you see somebody raise up and
[33:27] and accomplishing things uh for God the
[33:30] god ain't shocked I I I I watch I watch
[33:33] uh our Deacon brother Troy uh and and
[33:37] when he comes up
[33:41] that's so good brother Troy preaching
[33:43] the gospel in the years that that you
[33:46] know
[33:47] me and brother Jack Rose up and had
[33:51] churches and and doing meetings together
[33:55] you know all over the place uh you know
[33:59] you you it just never even crossed your
[34:01] mind and then in the right season
[34:05] right in in the right season you know he
[34:10] quickened brother Troy bring him in
[34:12] Anchor him in the face in the faith
[34:14] right and then after a few years you see
[34:18] what was it God saw that that ability
[34:22] was there all the time
[34:25] right I'm quite sure when he looked back
[34:28] he was like well I never saw that I
[34:31] never saw that coming
[34:33] I mean
[34:34] I've been I've been a Christian is 1988
[34:37] we all come up together
[34:39] we all I knew he could sing some and and
[34:44] and and operate and hold down officers
[34:47] in church
[34:50] well I should have said it like that but
[34:54] praise it out
[34:57] y'all don't make me tell a joke now
[34:59] let's leave that alone now I mean he has
[35:03] an ability he can he can hold up
[35:05] uh audience he can bring in atmosphere
[35:08] right
[35:10] amen amen
[35:13] now now I will say this
[35:16] Detroit and I told him this I won't say
[35:19] that I won't I don't already see it
[35:21] something happened to his voice
[35:24] over the couple of them years of spans
[35:27] of doing this thing
[35:29] because because Troy I call him Troy
[35:33] that's my brother-in-law so if I call
[35:34] her by his first day y'all forgive me
[35:36] but but deep really
[35:39] you could hold a note and really could
[35:41] do some things back in the days
[35:43] you've quieted in Okeechobee
[35:48] yeah
[35:50] but I'm gonna leave that alone y'all
[35:54] but I'm just used he don't mind if I use
[35:56] him as an example
[35:58] right amen you know just just to show
[36:02] you how how things can come full circle
[36:05] and and you know you you might look at a
[36:09] thing or you might look at yourself and
[36:11] feel like well I can't I can't do this
[36:13] job
[36:14] this this is this is just too big for me
[36:18] uh
[36:20] I'm quite sure brother Jack did probably
[36:23] in the early days never thought he'd be
[36:25] running a church
[36:27] right
[36:28] but God God knew that the ability was
[36:32] there all the time
[36:35] and I'm quite sure when he started out a
[36:37] lot of criticisms
[36:39] right but 20 years has passed and it's a
[36:44] constant climb
[36:46] right it's okay
[36:48] let's face it but when you start
[36:51] preaching boy it's difficult I remember
[36:53] I remember man my first my first sermon
[36:56] boy look at here I remember the time I
[37:00] told Brother James that I cause I ain't
[37:02] want to preach really after I stopped
[37:05] preaching that brother was I won't
[37:06] preach no more I want to try to sing a
[37:08] little bit I ain't went and man I used
[37:12] to have spasms so bad my wife used to
[37:14] say are you all right your show garlic
[37:16] trying to I don't know I don't care I
[37:19] ain't preaching I ain't never preaching
[37:21] right but after months and months and
[37:24] months of that
[37:25] you know and then get into a place where
[37:28] I felt like God was going to kill me I'm
[37:30] like okay all right Lord if you don't
[37:32] kill me this service I'm gonna go talk
[37:34] to the pastor and and you know brother
[37:37] James he was so nonchalant about things
[37:39] sometimes uh but but I I need to talk to
[37:43] you uh okay come in the office man I
[37:46] said I feel I think I feel a call to
[37:48] preach oh yeah oh okay all right all
[37:52] right that was it I walked out the
[37:54] office so I said Lord okay I went I kept
[37:57] my end
[37:59] man that brother wait till I got home
[38:03] my brother
[38:05] hey how you doing
[38:10] you think you can handle Tuesday night
[38:13] my mouth couldn't say no but I sure
[38:16] wanted to
[38:18] man my stomach boy
[38:23] first sermon you know I made it through
[38:28] I made it through by the grace of God
[38:30] and then brother van he said boy it
[38:33] ain't always going to be like that my
[38:35] second sermon I preach
[38:37] man I don't know my mind went blank
[38:41] hey I just lost trainer thought I
[38:43] struggled I want to leave the pulpit but
[38:46] I couldn't God came in he was just
[38:48] showing me something see here's the
[38:51] thing you got to come to a place where
[38:53] you recognize it's got to be God
[38:58] if it's gonna if it's gonna work if
[39:01] you're going to accomplish anything amen
[39:03] it's got to be God and then my third
[39:06] sermon I preached in New Jersey and I
[39:10] preached the and it wasn't even me I
[39:12] know like brother brother uh Birds used
[39:15] to always tell me
[39:17] by the way I know that when you boy I
[39:20] know you
[39:21] I know you
[39:24] that wasn't you I know it wasn't I
[39:27] trusted in him right man we preached I
[39:31] preached so
[39:33] I scared myself
[39:35] I said did all that come out of me and I
[39:39] wasn't even paying third message and
[39:40] that's when I got prophecy about
[39:42] pastoring and all that kind of stuff
[39:43] like that right and here I've been
[39:46] almost 30 years
[39:48] right no no training no no nothing but
[39:52] being trained by the Holy Ghost right
[39:55] amen
[39:57] okay so he says uh that's the reason why
[40:00] he chooses us because we're in that
[40:03] condition now that sounds strange but
[40:05] just a few minutes and we'll get to the
[40:07] reason that's on 45.
[40:10] um
[40:10] if God's willing he said we find out
[40:13] just as we have been reading that
[40:15] weaknesses and rejection we find out
[40:19] that those people who are the weakest
[40:23] right the weakest and rejected by the
[40:27] outside world
[40:30] is God's Heroes
[40:32] that conquer up in the front lines take
[40:36] takes those who are feel themselves
[40:39] unworthy right watch watch what God uses
[40:44] right watch the the weakest and rejected
[40:52] drunk
[40:53] smoke everything at the bottom of the
[40:57] barrel God said boy you right you just
[41:00] right you right right now
[41:03] right cause if it was me
[41:06] when I had my wits and and going to
[41:10] school and and
[41:11] semi-educated and all of that you know
[41:14] why did I stand that no because you're
[41:17] the man he got like you'd have made a
[41:19] mess you're the pro you know you'd
[41:21] approach the thing just like Moses from
[41:25] an intellectual standpoint amen and you
[41:28] never would have really been able to be
[41:30] effective
[41:32] right you never you know we don't have
[41:35] nothing against education we don't you
[41:37] know I I'm for people going to school
[41:39] and things of that nature but you know
[41:42] you can you can educate yourself
[41:45] Ministry wise don't you mean you gotta
[41:48] call it
[41:49] right
[41:50] amen that don't even mean because you
[41:52] got a school you got degrees that don't
[41:55] even mean you got a gift
[41:57] and and you go and you go sometimes in
[42:00] places and the first thing they want to
[42:01] do is send you off to some school or or
[42:05] you can't preach you can send a man off
[42:08] to all the schools you want if he ain't
[42:10] got a calling on his life he'll never
[42:12] really be able to uh uh function in this
[42:15] capacity he won't be able to do it you
[42:18] won't be able to do it it's it's got to
[42:21] be what's been predestinated amen by God
[42:25] before the foundations of the world
[42:27] see look at look at what because look at
[42:31] the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul you
[42:34] know with all of that education and and
[42:37] and back in that he had he still didn't
[42:40] even fully know the scripture
[42:43] come on he really he couldn't he
[42:47] couldn't see the unveiling of the Mighty
[42:50] God
[42:51] he couldn't see the unfolded because the
[42:55] the thing that he should have been a
[42:56] part of that was the thing that he was
[42:58] persecuting
[43:00] right
[43:01] and he was educated talk taught by the
[43:05] one of the the greatest professors it
[43:08] was of his time
[43:10] right he had he had the the backing amen
[43:15] of the ministry
[43:18] he didn't know what he was doing
[43:21] right he didn't he didn't know what he
[43:23] was doing
[43:24] and he had to get himself he had to get
[43:27] himself to a place where where he
[43:30] realized you know what
[43:32] why I gotta count everything I got is
[43:35] nothing
[43:36] as as dumb so so so that I can get a
[43:40] clue about what I'm doing right and and
[43:44] once he got knocked off with that horse
[43:46] and got filled with the bat cause all he
[43:49] had was education
[43:51] right but amen once he got the true
[43:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:55] right amen and then he sat under the
[43:59] feet of Jesus
[44:01] then he was able to teach look what he
[44:04] look what he he did by being
[44:06] predestinated to be a man the one of the
[44:10] eyes to the body
[44:12] come on
[44:14] right
[44:16] one of the eyes to the seven eyes to the
[44:18] body
[44:20] right can y'all say Amen
[44:23] yeah I don't believe you say what
[44:26] seven ah you
[44:29] spiritually
[44:32] it's Seven Seals Seven Stars in his
[44:35] right hand right
[44:37] glory to his wonderful day
[44:39] amen but he had to get to that place and
[44:42] then look
[44:44] he got to a place where you know I'm
[44:48] quite sure he he he felt he felt weak
[44:52] could you because you gotta you gotta
[44:54] imagine something a man that a man that
[44:59] Once Upon a Time
[45:01] had real real education
[45:04] real real intellect even petering them
[45:07] Peter them testified you know that you
[45:11] know Paul different
[45:13] come on right y'all know y'all
[45:17] Peter peace Peter testified Paul
[45:20] different
[45:21] Paul Paul don't Paul Don't Preach like
[45:24] us
[45:25] right Paul Paul is on another level
[45:29] and that's why that's why you know what
[45:32] Peter could respect Paul
[45:36] when Paul rebuked him
[45:39] right for acting one way with the Jews
[45:43] and when the boys come around here
[45:44] another way
[45:46] Paul Paul Paul was like bro Peter bro P
[45:49] I could imagine that conversation there
[45:52] brother Peter what you doing man bring
[45:54] it up to 20 20. bro Peter come on bro
[45:58] come on bro
[45:59] try to call them dog come on dog no I'm
[46:02] just kidding
[46:03] come on you y'all know how folk talk
[46:07] come on bro how do you expect these
[46:10] people
[46:11] Amen to live up to a certain standard
[46:15] when when they see you compromising you
[46:17] acting one way you know when the people
[46:20] you know the Jews ain't there and when
[46:23] they come you know you act like you
[46:25] don't know them y'all know what I'm
[46:26] talking about
[46:28] done that you know be you know everybody
[46:32] laughing and green and then didn't act
[46:35] like they only want to be identified
[46:36] with you
[46:38] right
[46:40] amen and I'm quite sure you know Peter
[46:43] was probably looking at Paul like Paul
[46:44] different
[46:46] right
[46:47] because you know what it it took
[46:50] something
[46:51] right it took something
[46:54] from Paul to be able to take the word of
[46:57] God
[46:58] right and and correct the error
[47:03] to bring a different kind of mindset a
[47:06] soundness because if he didn't right if
[47:10] he if Paul wouldn't have said nothing
[47:12] Peter would have went right on
[47:15] being one way
[47:18] when the people ain't there and be in
[47:20] another way when he right
[47:22] amen sometimes you know what you gotta
[47:26] say you gotta say difficult things
[47:29] right
[47:31] because because if you don't if you
[47:34] don't correct the error right if you
[47:37] don't set the things in order what
[47:40] happens Trends in different things
[47:43] follow after things
[47:45] right because see you one of the things
[47:48] you don't want to be doing God of
[47:49] service without it being his will
[47:51] right I'm I'm gonna give you something
[47:54] because sometimes sometimes people think
[47:57] well you harsh and and you know you well
[48:00] you shouldn't have said nothing well
[48:03] somebody got to say something
[48:06] right amen uh in order to place
[48:10] everything in line with the scripture
[48:14] right look at it look at that the the
[48:17] the the the the time when uh
[48:20] uh uh Vesta
[48:23] right when when when the king called her
[48:26] and she said well I'm doing my thing I I
[48:29] understand it man please
[48:31] many girls we over here we getting it in
[48:34] I ain't coming
[48:36] right
[48:40] question King like well I built it up
[48:42] boy my wife
[48:44] bad but she just dished me
[48:48] right
[48:50] and then and then and then one of the
[48:53] one of you know the spiritual men like
[48:56] wait a minute man you better get a hold
[48:59] of this thing because if if you don't
[49:03] right if you don't all because she's in
[49:06] leadership position
[49:09] and and if you if you don't say nothing
[49:11] then all the way
[49:15] all the women gonna be dishing their
[49:16] husbands
[49:19] right come on look look what look what
[49:23] look what uh
[49:25] prophet of God he talked about watch
[49:28] watch we just had uh Barack and and
[49:32] Michelle Obama
[49:34] they were trendsetters
[49:37] you you find whatever she did
[49:41] most of that's what they want to do
[49:44] right you you you find people find
[49:47] examples of people to to follow
[49:52] right and so it's just important that
[49:55] people in headship positions Ministry
[49:59] ministers young ministers right to have
[50:04] to have the right foundation to do
[50:07] things in order
[50:09] right
[50:11] um
[50:11] I'm I'm a little bit different y'all
[50:13] know y'all know this uh and not to be
[50:17] mean or anything right but but y'all
[50:21] know as Shepherds and and things you
[50:23] know uh we we different we think
[50:26] different we suspicious we we look we
[50:30] look at things
[50:32] on a whole nother level from a whole
[50:34] nother mindset than everybody else
[50:38] right when when everybody else when
[50:41] everybody else is applaud knit and happy
[50:44] with it
[50:45] be like
[50:48] I'm sorry you missed the scripture
[50:52] right
[50:54] you you missed the scripture and that's
[50:56] that's see you you're looking at this
[51:00] but you're not looking at all of this
[51:03] right
[51:04] amen you're not looking all of this to
[51:07] follow because because now you you set
[51:12] uh uh uh some sort of standard
[51:17] right
[51:19] right and so okay they got by with that
[51:23] and then you'll see this another group
[51:25] popping up
[51:26] and a lot another group popping up and
[51:29] not another group popping up but the the
[51:32] the Autumn because listen listen when
[51:36] the order of a thing is broken
[51:39] you got chaos
[51:42] right let the stars of one of those
[51:44] things move out of those heavenly hosts
[51:47] move out of this position we got chaos
[51:50] if the moon stopped doing this job we
[51:53] got chaos if it decides it wants to be
[51:56] the sun we got a mess on our hands
[51:59] right
[52:00] amen God God placed everything
[52:04] positionally in order
[52:06] so so that everything could function the
[52:10] way that it's supposed to be
[52:12] and so if we start breaking the order of
[52:16] the scripture we got chaos we don't have
[52:20] God now
[52:21] right we don't have God no matter how
[52:25] much Quivers no matter no matter he's
[52:28] left the building ichabag is over the
[52:31] whole thing we
[52:33] see and that that's the way that I look
[52:35] at things right
[52:38] I look at I look at things from a you
[52:41] know I look at it and like no
[52:45] I I know see
[52:48] people that's not as spiritual might
[52:50] think that that was okay but then you
[52:53] find a a god-called man a Shepherd look
[52:56] like that
[52:59] and it's not that you're trying to be
[53:01] offensive are you trying to hurt
[53:03] somebody you know they won't let me do
[53:05] nothing
[53:07] we want you to do what God has ordained
[53:09] for you to do
[53:11] in the will of God
[53:14] in line with the scriptures
[53:17] right glory to God in line with the
[53:20] scripture you ain't never going to find
[53:22] God outside of but my time up you ain't
[53:25] but I'm just feeling starting to feel
[53:27] good
[53:28] you're never going to find God outside
[53:31] of his word
[53:32] God ain't operating God ain't doing
[53:35] nothing outside of his word
[53:38] right that that's why we had uh a man to
[53:42] preach doing God a service without it
[53:45] being his will
[53:47] right it's showing us the musts
[53:50] the must the must not look dislocate the
[53:53] must not do this you must not do that
[53:56] right
[53:57] you can't look at the initial
[54:00] you you got to look at what the sea will
[54:03] produce
[54:07] what what the scene of that right right
[54:10] come on look look at look at look at God
[54:15] two minutes and I'm gonna go cause I'm
[54:17] finna get stirred up now
[54:19] but I feel good
[54:21] you you could see God started the church
[54:24] a man in the book of Acts on the word
[54:28] right right
[54:29] baptism in the name of Jesus right
[54:34] repent and be baptized and every and and
[54:37] given the Holy Ghost is that right
[54:39] that's a requirement
[54:41] to produce change
[54:43] right come on
[54:45] right but then after so many rounds of
[54:49] the Apostles this historical they they
[54:53] went up to nicaea and and they brought
[54:55] they brought in a Doctrine right that
[55:00] was so contrary from the original Bible
[55:03] doctrine that they that they got a man
[55:07] uh in the beginning
[55:10] right and so instead of a man the name
[55:15] they took the name out
[55:17] see the devil know there's still power
[55:19] in the name of Jesus
[55:21] but and then they brings in titles
[55:25] a father Son and Holy Ghost
[55:28] s
[55:30] and then
[55:31] it it looks see when when the white
[55:35] horse rider started out man he started
[55:39] out with a doctrine of something that
[55:41] looked so in inoffensive
[55:44] right something that you know it won't
[55:47] hurt nobody this won't hurt nothing
[55:50] right right then and there because it
[55:54] was in his seed form
[55:56] but look what happened amen when it got
[55:59] on the red horse
[56:02] hmm
[56:04] right
[56:05] then you start seeing some blood
[56:09] at first it you know that's just like
[56:11] sin it's so insufficient when it starts
[56:14] out and it sees form
[56:17] right well I smoke a little joint
[56:21] hey Kiki last you get the munchies
[56:24] that's seed form
[56:27] huh and then next time you find yourself
[56:29] out there on on ecstasy and crack and
[56:34] and and
[56:36] right come on I know what I'm talking
[56:38] about I'm not now this ain't getting no
[56:39] book I'm just talking about I'm talking
[56:41] about me see it starts out so innocent
[56:45] you sneaking in the bushes and your deck
[56:47] your mom and them don't know they're
[56:49] gonna know it all after a while you just
[56:50] keep on going
[56:52] mm-hmm
[56:54] yeah everything starts our innocence the
[56:57] first the first time you said a bad word
[57:01] huh then next time you know man you
[57:05] cussing like a sailor you see any any
[57:08] seed form it looks it looks harmless
[57:11] insufficient
[57:14] you know like this ain't gonna do much
[57:17] but once the thing amen uh get roots and
[57:23] start to grow and take on a life of his
[57:25] own
[57:26] and start producing its full potential
[57:30] then you know what you got
[57:34] then you know what it is
[57:36] and so this is why uh you gotta cut a
[57:41] thing down a man before it gets uh time
[57:45] to be Warden and grow
[57:49] and spread
[57:53] well praise the Lord
[57:55] amen I feel good now I'm ready to go to
[57:58] Arizona
[58:01] this idea I feel I feel all right now
[58:05] hey man as long as the Holy Ghost come
[58:07] down
[58:09] right
[58:10] but but it it's a lot don't ever think
[58:13] that we Mad Men
[58:15] could we not
[58:17] right it's it's just that you know the
[58:20] Watchmen in the tower he sit up way
[58:23] higher than than everybody around and
[58:27] the people that's on the ground should
[58:29] be depending on the Watchmen to
[58:33] recognize and understand a man what's
[58:36] coming after them watch me one of the
[58:38] night
[58:39] right
[58:42] because they train
[58:44] that's dangerous that's Danger
[58:47] right don't open the gates and then
[58:49] that's danger you can tell how you could
[58:51] tell how they're coming in and how they
[58:53] ride right
[58:56] okay
[58:58] they coming in peace that's good
[59:00] right
[59:03] you ought to just say Lord I Thank you
[59:05] for a good Watchman
[59:08] because he could recognize something
[59:10] that I can't recognize because I ain't
[59:13] up on the tower
[59:14] and I don't have the ability so that's
[59:17] why that's why we we have to appreciate
[59:20] uh our pastor uh for his diligence and
[59:25] and the word that he bring not that he
[59:27] want to be offensive it's things that
[59:29] you don't even want to say you know
[59:31] you'd be like man uh why don't you make
[59:34] me say that
[59:36] I didn't want to say that if people
[59:38] start texting and calling and this and
[59:40] that you'd be like man I you know what
[59:43] you built for you'll be all right
[59:46] you'd be all right but but I say things
[59:49] and I just trust that y'all understand
[59:51] y'all understand me you know I
[59:54] appreciate brother Jack because I
[59:55] understand brother Jack
[59:57] by being a Shepherd it's a heart it's a
[1:00:00] hard job
[1:00:01] because it's so much
[1:00:03] we we in different places when you know
[1:00:06] different mindsets and man you're trying
[1:00:07] to find the mind of God and you don't
[1:00:10] want to be offensive and all that but
