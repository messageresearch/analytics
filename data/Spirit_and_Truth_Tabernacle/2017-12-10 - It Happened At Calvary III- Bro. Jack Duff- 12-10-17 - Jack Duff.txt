[Music] it's kind of hard to believe that we sit and and dissembler this the years really gone by pretty fast and so much is happening right before our eyes and I'm just but just I was just on Friday night talking a little to the church about some events that took place this week it was very to me the story with what President Trump did regarding making is making Jerusalem the capital city of Israel and you know I'm not one that that really deals too much in politics but I do follow Scripture and you know brother Branham told us that if we want to know what time it is then we should look at our watches or look at a clock if you want to know what day it is then look at a calendar and if you want to kind of get what time it is according to you know God's calculations he said watch Israel they've told us to watch Israel and you know the the thing of what happened there there was a statement made I was reading on CNN and they were saying that it's been seven decades since you know something like this has happened I spent seven decades which would amounts to 17 years and you know you'll start looking at the 70 years then you have to go back and look at the 70 weeks Daniel right so these are some things that we need to go back and listen to from the profit but as you start looking at you know some of those things there it just begins to kind of show you or just help you kind of line yourself appropriately with with the events so not only is it 70 70 years since something like this has occurred next year 2018 Israel will be celebrating 70 years of being a nation okay and they just receive you know that that status they have been dispersed into so many different nations and lands some of that because of you know some of the things they did that they as they just did not uphold the Word of God they would get dispersed but God would always bring them back while I was there I told y'all about this guard and I went into and this man had a he just got every tree in the in the Bible you know that you could find in fact these trees he put them inside this garden he tells the story about every tree so he had one of the young man say not get up in this tree right here and just just lay there just lay in the tree and he called a group together and said anybody know what tree this is and I looked at I said that's the sycamore tree I ain't ain't seen no sign only sign I saw was the boy laying in a tree and I say this is the sycamore tree and they said okay that's good that's good I say well he said do you know that the sycamore tree is not native to Israel the sycamore tree actually came in from Africa it was transported here he said but why would Jesus you know use allow that to be there and then Zacchaeus to go in the sycamore tree and and then that that story happened according to Scripture why why would it happen like that I don't know he said well the sycamore tree there's something you need to know about it the sycamore tree is a tree that even when you cut it within a certain amount of time it's going to sprout back up and saying and the sycamore tree everything on the tree always goes up or it never goes down when it's everything it just it sprouts up and it should just might take a few years but it's gonna come up again I don't care how low you cut it and he's saying that types Israel because no matter how many times we get displaced from our land we coming back again say where that type de bride - no matter how many times we fall we gonna get back up again so you know we were just you know he was just going over some of those things and you know in 70 years 70 years has been for Israel that says they have been accepted as a nation but it was only 50 years ago that they were in a position they they had the Land of Israel but they didn't have Jerusalem so in 1967 there was a war that was fought it was a six-day war and they went and they reclaimed Jerusalem you know but when Israel got Jerusalem it still was not recognized by everybody as their capital not Israel's fighting for this and they got it in six days but but people don't recognize it as a capital you know somebody sent me a quote yesterday where brother branham college ruse in the capital of Israel multiple quotes that their brother ramsley Jerusalem is the capital Jerusalem as their capital right so you know when you start looking at these things and and nobody would with sign this agreement to acknowledge you know Israel I mean Jerusalem as Israel's capital President Trump goes out very bold statement in the face of everything that he's going through but he goes out and he actually says that this is the capital and we want to move our embassy here and I said that was a very very important move you know and very very important move certainly it could trigger some things you know as far as uh prizes and things that nature because there are many actually let me let me do y'all a favor young and I won't have y'all play yeah let's go be seated yeah we'll just give me that picture that I was talking about on Friday night now I'll preach you since we didn't have that many specials I can talk a little bit longer praise the Lord if y'all gave me a little bit more time so I'm I'm grateful I just want you to count understand I've did this on on Friday night now just I won't go through the whole thing but I'll just give you a little bit but just understand what was triggering the up risers or what could trigger the up risers is the vicinity you know Jerusalem is a very very important City to three groups of people it's important to the Israelis of the Jews it's important to the Arabs or Muslims it's also important to Christians all right a very very important city so much has happened there in Jerusalem Jerusalem is where our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that is where he rose again right next to Jerusalem City right next to this Bethlehem that's where he was born right and I mean when I was there going through his life Bethlehem was like going from Riviera Beach to West Palm Beach you know something like that it's very very close but what triggers you know the issues here with with this signing a man of this or this declaration if you can just look on this picture here this is the Western Wall where people go in they pray you know and I showed the pictures some of the brothers that once this thing was announced by the president this whole area was just full people I mean people everywhere just just singing and praising and thanking God before the declaration that was made by President Trump now so this is this is the you know the western wall here this is uh you know just you know pretty much the city of Jerusalem but this particular area is extremely important if just to help you understand this is Mount Moriah if your Bible reader you understand what I just said this is where Abraham brought Isaac right this this is the area this is the area where Christ died just outside the city gates he was outside the city gates this is where Christ died this is where something else we'll talk about today happen and then but the problem is this this Dome of the rock or mosque of Omar is a holy site for Muslim people of Muslim faith and so they don't want to lose this they have Mecca now they do have Mecca right they got that but but Jerusalem mean a lot more to them so that the Muslims would want Jerusalem to be considered that capital but by President Trump said no we gonna call it Israel's capital that was big because now you know there could be an uprise with the Muslims you know against this but I tell you that the Jewish leaders are already kind of saying look now if I can just use modern terms if y'all don't start nothing it won't be nothing right that's that's what he's saying hey saying look we're not Israel I mean we're not we not kicking nobody out of Israel we just wanted to be known that Jerusalem is ours right it's always been ours our prophets we're here our kings were here it's always been ours and now we're so happy that the u.s. is acknowledging that they're the first ones that come out of acknowledge it so he said that's always says that we're not trying to get rid of you know everybody we accept everybody's faith and all that y'all can continue to do what y'all was doing but but we just wants to know the Jerusalem among us right so you know when it comes on it says that they say they'll defend themselves if they need to but what we're praying and this is where the scripture tells us to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem that's in Psalms 122 we want to continue to pray for this area you know but but understand you know the significance of what happened here with President Trump sign that agreement and the other thing that is there's coming a time church where scripture talks tells us that there will be two witnesses that will go back to the Jews and I read the quote on the other night they're gonna get the same message that we got oh my I read on Friday night the Jews are gonna get the same message Oh Lord don't I don't want to go all in there yeah I've just shared a quick testimony that we had a our our our tour guide being Jewish a couple things he did we had a service inside of Garden of Gethsemane first time this man in 37 or 38 trips that brother George is taken the same tour guide first time this man has ever actually sat in on one of the services because him being a Jew he has the service that he attends right so they don't really go to the Christian Church they just they go they do what they do but it's oh brother George don't want to sit in on y'all on y'all discussion and like yeah come on so brother George sit there in the garden because seemingly just kind of going through some things and and he began to share testimony about this this tour guide and the tour guide one thing that happened he said there was a sister that had a dream she saw on the dream a man with white hair and and and as she was looking at this man with white hair you know she couldn't understand what was going on but uh in the dream some kind of way I think either brother branham came to her some kind of way she was told a dream don't worry he's one of us that man don't don't be afraid that man he's one of us so she you know she took that to heart a few months later she ended up in Jerusalem on the tour and she sees the man with white hair that was in her dream it was our tour guy right and when and when she saw him but he's one of us well he's he's Jewish how could it be one of us right but but the but in the dream said don't worry he's one of us well this man that's the tour guide he had been watching the brother George bring these people for years they all coming over there and the way that they dress they look a little different they dress what they call it like the Orthodox Jews you know and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know like man wasn't what is it about job he just you know kept going kept talking and you know brother George took him back to something because the Jews have a belief that Elijah is gonna come that's day belief they have a meal at their table they do this routinely every household they do this routinely they leave an empty chair and they're at the table and then they'll send the youngest boy to open the front door the house and say now we're under expectation that Elijah don't come sit in that chair and join us for this meal so you go open the door and we'll wait for Elijah and they'll sit the baby doing it for years and still doing it waiting on the Elijah to return the Jews are waiting for Elijah they're waiting for so brother George begin the tongue say now you know how y'all leave that chair and y'all waiting on a larger to come he said yes and what's the difference about us say well you know we have received our Elijah brother brother branham happened to be the Elijah promised according to revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 you know various scriptures in Matthew 17 and say he was the Elijah that was promised I say so we have received our Elijah and he came forth with a message and you know and turning our heart back to the faith of the fathers and he said it said another thing is that Elijah happened to be my father-in-law when I ran say oh wow so he said brother Joseph to hear the tape you can listen to it you know from him just you can check it out yourself so the man listening to brother branham's tape and brother Branham just begin to explain some things about Israel just just talking about it on the tape the man heard it and came back to brother Georgia State has this man ever come to Israel they say no not one time he said well he's explaining Israel exactly the way it is he caught it by vision and he begin explaining right and it's in stand and just just just you know sometime the prophets speaking you got to watch it right because sometime he just preached you just thank you preach and that's why you know thank God he know preach that grab his ear to get our attention it's gonna take a little bit more than that right I mean yeah y'all anybody know about grabbing the ear I think I don't lost somebody you know when we come up the preacher when he and he say I feel my health care I'm glad hmm he got a grab well he starts singing that sermon late and they're all everybody get up and see when you start listening to the problem if you grew up in that type of environment and you start listening to the Prophet like oh man that just don't at that that's see you is going to church for entertainment you want to go on for the word but when you start going for the word you stop you stop worrying about something Jesus didn't have to grab his ear to get his point across Jesus just said what he needed to say you say a man don't say man don't matter right but but you know I mean when we went when this man heard it he's like he's like yeah this man he got to be a prophet the way that he's sharing these things so this tour God eventually had a situation come up and he went here the West Western Wall it actually goes underneath you can go underneath it like this and walk alone and you get down to like this area and and on the other side of that would have been the holders of Holies so many of the Jews would go to that area because they can be caught up here cap I mean Jews or Christians cannot be caught up here only Muslim Muslims can go here you go up there you might not come back now so they know to stay away from there the Jews know that so they go underneath and they go right where the homes of holders would have been and they would they pray right there in that spot so this man you know would go here they would offer prayers and he had a one of his daughters was going through little something and then while she was while she was while they were at home cream the man had a dream and in the dream brother branham came to him in the dream and and told him certain things you say you know how you do this it's gonna be all right and and he saw brother branham's house so he when brother George came a few weeks after man had a dream he acts brother George what was brother branham house slit lang what does this house look like he said it looked like this to look like that he said I saw the house in the dream I saw brother branham he told me it's gonna be alright and the situation that he was going through with this daughter it was alright that man said he believed that brother branham was a prophet I was I was there on the Sea of Galilee and heard the man say it I tried to record it but I was too late with my camera but I heard him said I believe brother Brandon was a prophet and we got folk over here it just it just blows me away yeah you know you you over here try and let the Lord help me God III mean it just don't make sense and some of the things that we use to try to prove that he's not a prophet uh you the devil can sell you anything I mean come on right so it ain't got nothing to do it no fair I'm sorry yeah well ii-i've gotta take a lot I mean take a stronger win than this no they keep me from my promises y'all y'all got y'all gonna have to y'all got to come up with a lot more than that and my question always now okay you gonna take the profit from it man we know that God say he was sitting somebody who is the person you even have nobody to give me what you gonna take this from me tell you what i'ma keep this until that comes so you know it's just you know you hear these things and and you know just just so much it's been prophesied but what happened with it being 70 years the key thing I want you to get there that 70 years it's very very critical it was 70 years of captivity for Israel when they were in Babylon and they came out but now Dan you and Daniel chapter 9 he began to study the time there's a countdown that was on and Dan begin the study like and what Danny was Dan was doing the Bible so he went back to the books what books the books of Jeremiah he went back to study the Prophet he want to know what the Prophet sent oh my and we're doing the exact same thing we want to know what the prophecy I don't want to know what you saying I don't want to know if it's just your fault keep it but we want to know what the prophecy we eat we eat food from heaven that's what our diet is right so tell me what the prophecy because he has understanding of these things glory to God Church but you know we were you know as Deng was going back to study Jeremiah go in your line you'll see it all in there but he was going to study Jeremiah to see you know what she'll be looking for you know what the thing is gonna be like and as I'm saying this church this this this this this decree that was signed you know and and this being recognized as the capital of Israel is going to trigger some things but but the ultimate thing is that before God sends the two witnesses of Moses Elijah back to the Jews the Gentiles must be caught away in a rapture so if this is the beginning of it if this is the beginning my question is where are we and if we're that close how should we be acting what should be our response and and the thing that moves me the most when you really go back and look at Daniel as he begin to see things happen brother man of singing with that year 68 year 69 year 70 Daniel began to enter get into a place of Prayer oh my god now you see why the prayer beans are so important and and the thing that he began to in turn to prayer not only did Daniel do that but but uh Abraham when he recognized destruction was coming to southern Gomorrah Abraham began to intercede so so so so what should be happening now the prevenir should be the most cool service there is when I'm talking about when you really got an understanding of what's going on right now it's the demos job to get your eyes off of what God is doing and he'll use anything here use anything family issues sharp issues you name it the devil will use it that keep your attention off of what God is doing you have to fight you have to fight but I tell you what I'm doing everything I can my brother branham said in the quote he say you know Daniel began to pray and he begin to confess his faults in the people's faults and just get themself prepared for the return of the Jews we're trying to get the people prepared for the return of our Lord and and we got to be ready Church if there's ever a time this is a time that you do not get your lines tangled up the Prophet said that please don't get your lives tangled up in times like these don't do it it's difficult it's too close to the coming of the Lord so I just want you to understand it was very significant I can't go through all of that paid man today we'll put the tape out there so you can go and listen to it and and and and if I could just say this don't be a lazy Christian lazy Christian wait for the tape to go up and they try to catch up don't do that if you can make it to church you need to be in church it should be a it should be abnormal when you've missed Church not normal abnormal praise the Lord and you everybody's got something they going through y'all got it we all got trials we all got to press through something you know if you got a job that hinders you pray that God will give you a different time anything wrong with that right Lord give me a different job I want to I want to be in service I want that I'll oh I need this right and we just we just want to be we want to be ready Church that's that's the that's the bottom line all right so I'm a I'm a pick oh let me announce this the tonight Oh Wednesday night man we had a preacher from Nigeria brother Gideon Lord Jesus that man was breaking some brain up up here and we had it we had a wonderful time you know with him and we're so grateful for the Westco I want y'all to understand what happened there they shut they serve his down and they came here that was the second time brother what's gonna done that shut they service down and they came here to fellowship with us that was a blessing Saints from brother of James Church came Saints from Brother smile his church was here then we had a time and and so I knew he was I forgot to announce to everybody on Thursday that he was gonna be preaching that just brother James Church on Thursday night I went back on Thursday man he start breaking into some other stuff he was preaching on you know the Aaron's rod laying in the presence of God and and he said he said how overnight that thing began to bud and God was God was showing because people were coming against the prophet in that day too they always come against prophets but but he said God was showing and identifying who he was with right and and when he went when Aaron's robbed he say they had that identified a Ross put him in there with a names on it so we'll know whose is whose you can't go claiming somebody else write the name is on it alright so here here come this you know and overnight not only it does it does it does it bloom amen it starts blossoming and budding right so Aaron's rod and God God God vindicates they said we were like Aaron's rod they said we were cut off from the tree of life say but when we came back into the presence of God overnight we began to blossom and we begin to punch I said man that was all right so we had church there

that'll start in January that second and Sunday will give you the time and everything that never start it'll be for the married couples that we'll be meeting and it'll be a few weeks of meetings that we'll be going through call we call it two haven't a whole so just keep that in mind we're certainly looking forward to that a man so praise the Lord I think that's all that I need to make mention of and I will ask you all to turn in your Bibles with me to second Samuel 24 and second Samuel 24 praise the Lord a man and I'm this is a rather long passage a man let's stand all that can't stand and I'm so I'm gonna just take bits and pieces and read it to you and hopefully that would just be enough to give us a a background here on second Samuel 24 we'll start at verse 1 says this and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say go number Israel and Judah for the king said to Joab the captain of the hosts which was with him to go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to bear Sheba and number ye the people that I may know the number of the and Joab said unto the king now the LORD thy God Adam to the people how many so ever they'd be a hundredfold and that the eyes of the Lord the King may see it but why does my lord the King delight and this thing and those that's a key word that he David is delighting and a number of the people that's that's very critical here it says verse 4 notwithstanding the Kings were prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the hosts and Joab and the captains of the hosts went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel I'm skipping over to verse 9 a man says and Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in Israel 800,000 diet man that drew the sword and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men and Davis heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and David said unto the Lord I have sinned greatly and that I have done and and now I beseech thee O Lord take away the iniquity of that servant for I have done very foolishly for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the Prophet guy David see you're saying going saying the David thus saith the Lord I offer the three things choose the one of them that I may do it unto thee so God came to David and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come into unto thee and thy land are worth doubtfully three months before thine enemies will Wow while they pursue they pursued thee or that there be three days a pestilence in thy land now advised and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me and David said unto God I am in a great straight let us fall now into the hand of the Lord for His mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man so low so the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed and their died of the people for then even to bear Sheva 70,000 men and when the Angels stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the Lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough staying out on hand and the angel the Lord was buy the threshing place of Aruna the Jebusite and David's bacon to the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo I have sinned and I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let down hand I pray thee be against me and against my father's house and GAD came that day to David and said to him go up rear and altar unto the Lord in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite and I'm skipping over to verse 22 says and aruna said in a David let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him the whole here the oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the Oxford for wood all these things did Aruna as a king give unto the king and a ruler said unto the king and the Lord that God accept thee and and the King said unto Aruna nay but I will surely buy it of the at a price and neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver and David built there an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the what was entreated for them for the land and the plague was state from Israel the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a brief word of Prayer thank you God for the ability to read the scripture thank you God that the Holy Spirit comes to also give us enlightenment on the things that we've read so we pray God that as you have been a part of our worship now God you'll be a part of this going forth of your word continue to quicken understanding the revelation to our hearts the Bible tells us that the gates of hell won't prevail against the revelation that's in our hearts O God help us to have we if revelations beyond the ship prophet told us to look up and to ask you for so god I prayed it should help us to see things that we need to see today forgive us of every sin every shortcoming look beyond every fall to see every need may we got pushed to the side the issues that we're dealing with all that matters now is going into the presence of God and receiving from him so it's the devil's job to try to sidetrack us and do all these other things but help us to keep our attention on thee if Peter would have kept his attention on him on you he would have kept walking but Lord so help us father not to sink but going to keep our eyes on the in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated in the presence of the Lord we will continue our journey a man it happened at Calvary a man this is part three of our journey here and I'm kind of going back into some statements that I made last week and then we'll go forward I want to read just two quotes that go along with some of the statements that I made last week here from the message why it had to be Shepherd why it had to be Shepherd the Prophet makes a man of this this statement says when those seven mysteries back through those seven churches there were seven hidden mysteries said I'm right in the book of it and a great theologian said to me not long ago said brother Branham see how Satan will try to jerk you off the road you said brother Branham you know what I believe the Lord will reveal to you what we're to do next is it he says it'll be some great secret that's hid in under the under these seven seals I said no that isn't it brother he said it'll be something that's not even written in the word it sounds so spiritual it'll be something that's that that's that's not even written in the word I said no no you forgive whosoever shall add one word or take one word away see it's already in there but the Reformers has failed to see it they didn't live long enough to see it and the ages is over now we're right here at Laodicea and remember the latest year age he was on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in Eve had put her Adam out like that Eve had put her Adam out god help us let us go beyond the camp to find him let us suffer without the gates with him let us go to him in his death in his burial and in his resurrection for he's the same yesterday today and forever and we were using Amen description last week Hebrews 13 verse 11 through 13 where it says for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate so you know the scripture tells us very plainly when they were offering that burnt offering the burnt offering had to be given outside of the camp outside of the gate so when I when I was telling you all along that it was certainly the same heel but not the exact same spot where Isaac was offered and where Jesus was offered Jesus had to be offered outside the camp Amen in order to fulfill other scriptures right so he was outside the camp as a whole burnt offering for our sins and verse 13 and Hebrews 13 says let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach a man we got to go unto him outside the camp bearing his reproach and imma just tell you something to be a message believe in this hour it's almost a reproach Amen amongst them it's a reproach but for God amen it's the glorious thing that he got some people that will follow his word amen glory to God so let me read something here this message going beyond the camp he says we are invited to go beyond that camp Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go beyond let us go to him beyond the gate watch bearing his reproach what was he reproachful not because he was a Methodists or Baptists I'll assure you that not because he was there a theist a Jassi because he was the vindicated words a man that's the reproach because he was the vindicated word bearing his reproach for what the vindicated word that's right that's what he did he said if I do not the works of my father don't believe me if I'm not the answer to all the scripture questions says Jesus and I love this brother Solomon just said it here this morning Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the Old Glory got exactly right I believe as I was telling you here now some time ago uh somewhere in a meeting it might not have been here Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new said when I was us going squirrel hunting that morning and there it was them three big stems running to run into one out there right on the mountain me standing there looking at it and I drew up close and took off my hat lay down my right but got up there and a voice shook the woods that Jesus of the New Testament it's Joe who love the old remain faithful and if I could just tell you to do the same this morning remain faithful I don't care what you're going through Church just remain faithful hallelujah keep your eyes on Christ remain faithful so right below there is well the squirrels amen right below there is where the squirrels appear then coming to existence when there was when there was none there see that's the truth see is true so God knows me for who I stand is the truth of it that's right it's the truth it's right down to Kentucky and there's people sitting right here tonight was present when it happened again the same thing yes we know it's the truth Jesus of the Old Testament now he's explaining the situation there where you know brother Branham was out hunting and as he was hunting he was hunting the squirrels and he could not find him he couldn't couldn't couldn't get anything and you know when I went you know he's out there and the Lord acts of saying I what you it says uh it's remind them of description if you say to the mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and dumb down the heart you can have what you say and the Lord said now do you believe that and it says yea Lord I believe it and you say yeah you you sure you really believe that so yes yes yes yes I believe it it says okay what you hunting for who says I'm the squirrels so you know if you say to the mountain be thou removed don't cast and and be Casso see don't doubt me heart you can have what you say okay say how many squirrels you won't I want three you said where you want a map okay I want one to do this I wanted to come off this limb and do this and do that and then i'ma shoot it right there that squirrel come from out of from spoken word it come across that limb he shot it dropped it picked it up and said man this he say this came to a vision because visions don't bleed they say he say he says God if he said it's got to be real so say he say they say tell me what the next one gonna come from me see you know I'll care what he said he acts what to do something impossible things that squirrels don't do say I want this one to do it like this like that like that and i'ma shoot it over there that squirrel come up shot it Wham so he he say Lord we said man this is just really something I said I ain't never had no experience like this before and he saw the two squirrels and you know didn't say ok where you want to throw it with that he said how you want the third one well it didn't come in the time that he thought it should come so he got the two and say lord I thank you but my to squirty begin the walk away say no no no no no no no no no no you said three and if you said three you got to sit down wait on the third one so here you know why he's sitting there waiting that third one finally shows up and he shoots it and and when it and when he when he shot it I believe he went to go find it and confined it right and and then he had some you know some some situations there where he went back to the camp and begin to share it with the brethren share the testimony and one of the brothers you know he prayed that night before they went to bed and the brother prayed a prayer and his pray saying Lord ain't brother branham telling the truth then let him find the third squirt let him find the squirt amount and brother branham went to bed with a mind battle he said I just shared poured out my heart and and this man know that I've never told him anything wrong why would he say if I'm telling him why would he say something like that so he said he said he said just he couldn't understand why the brother said that but it wasn't fun for everyone for the man him some brother branham let's see if he was gonna doubt in his heart so the next morning he went out there and he's like lord I don't know why I said that and it came back to him again stay now you speak where it's gonna be and when he spoke there that squirrel was sitting right there you know where it where it was supposed to be you know and he found the squirrel but also in that same spot brother Branham said that's where it was revealed to him in that same area that's where we revealed to him that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the old what that did was just start discrediting truth Trinitarian teaches amen it made us understand that Jesus was not just the Son of God Jesus was God that oh my lord I just love saying it you know that's why I when people just you know that the church has been so hooked on telling the story how God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son I said no no one this God gave his son don't stop right there let him know that God became the time and I was there twelve Chancellor's that right so you know but we had to get that type of that type of teacher that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah the old and you know what to accept that type of teaching today you're gonna have to go beyond the campus you got to go outside the camp and you got the better approach of this word hallelujah I'm willing to bear the reproach of this word you're gonna be criticized you're gonna be looked down upon a man you gonna have to go through some serious things in order to hold true to this word but let me tell you something your Lord and Savior went through a lot more than you'll ever have to go through a man and he did it outside of the camp all right all right all right let's not let's keep going here a man today praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord all right I want to go here to this message the revelation of Jesus Christ I want to kind of shift gears here a little bit a man and bring us into some something else it all happened at Calvary a man it all happened at Calvary glory to God we we have brought to your attention over the last weeks how Abraham offered Isaac Amen on Mount Moriah and Mount Moriah happened to be the same he'll wear or same vicinity the same he'll brother branham say ah the same Hill that Isaac walked up was the same Hill that Jesus walked up right and Barrett carrying that would the same Hill so you know Jesus was offered in the same spot that Isaac was about to be offered a man we also told you how when when Jesus was offered outside the camp it was a place called Golgotha which meant a heap of skulls right Calvary meant the place of skull right and and here he's dying in this place and there were some skulls buried there Alleluia and not hurt brothers talk about how Goliath skull was buried there not thank God for that but Goliath was not redeemable so I appreciate that but he wasn't redeemable butBut when I found out and brother branham told us you know he was there reading a book and you know when I found out that not only was he said there were many discussive but the main skull that happened to be there was a skull of Adam that was there at the place of skulls Shem brings it through the art and places it there at Moriah at Calvary at Golgotha so here the second Adam dies in the same spot that the first Adam is buried sure that Redemption had been completed what Adam failed to do in the beginner it was it's ok Adam we not hold against you Jesus Christ had completed it he did it all at Calvary see I mean that everything everything means something everything every word means something you know even in the Bible their names meant something that's why you when you having kids you need to be careful what you're naming them hello somebody everywhere and I old glory to God and ain't no no message believers should ever name they son Ricky if you listen to the message ain't no way you're gonna end up with a son named Ricky like like you know and there are people uh brother Brown said it mean rat right you know and not only that you got people today you just pick up the Bible one time I'm gonna find me a name Ida pop and I'm gonna name my shot don't just do it like that read the story about that person before your name on that some some some mama thinks she got a good revelation I'm gonna name my daughter Jessie Bale do you know who she was she wasn't even a dawn of Israel don't just leave your kids anything just putting stuff together you got to know what them names mean come on somebody I mean they're spirits that go along with the name all right all right all right so you know here you know we're just trying to bring out how you know these various things that happen at Calvary and now we want to just go a little further here today if we can this message here the revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet makes the statement it says oh if you can only any man can see the spiritual application of the scriptures and could say that they wasn't inspired your your very action the very mode of the very objectives of the people why it proves that the scripture is inspired to see how God applies those things just just what you do here's a type of something since like Abraham offering up Isaac his only son a type of God giving his son hundreds of years later how that Joseph was sold and in prison hated of his brothers and loved it loved of his father Jesus in type how the Spirit worked through Joseph a man and simply typed the life of Christ perfectly how David the son of David sent on the same mountain when Dave was rejected as king and went up over the hill Mount of Olives looking back we can as a rejected King a few hundred years after that the son of David climb the stain he as a rejected king and wept over Jerusalem the spirit in tight inform and when you have the opportunity you know to go and I'm speaking of some of my whole congregation when you have the opportunity to go to Israel you'll see how close the Mount of Olives was to Mount Calvary you'll see how close a man these things were so when you when you read or you hear that a brother and I'm talking about that it just begins to it begins to make a little bit more sense to you David was a perfect type of Christ there were some other things that brother branham said you know he said did you notice one time there was a bear run in and got one of his sheep and he killed that bear and a lion running and got one and he caught the lion by the beard and took a knife and kill that lion see it was sacrifice sacrificing for his sheep David being a shepherd was sacrificing his life for his sheep a man he was willing to go against a bear he was willing a men that go against the lion what I'm trying to say is David was willing to put his life on the line oh my god David David David knew he had been taught by his father that it's a shame for a shepherd to lose a sheep so as a young boy he that was instilled in in his day I'm not gonna let her land get one of these sheep I'm not gonna let a bear get one of these sheep and I can't remember exactly where this but I've know in Scripture what I want one of the Old Testament scripture say even if the lion got ahold of one achievement of all that Shepherd to do is bring back their ear he was gonna fight just to get the ear of the sheep back put his life in danger for the Sheep if that's not a perfect type of Christ because he went to a cross so put his life on the line the sheik and he is the chief shepherd of our souls thank you Jesus he says he was a sacrificing for a sheep and if he was willing to lay his life down for the Sheep he was a type of the good shepherd brother branham also says look at David the son of David Christ was the son of David Christ in David hated despised rejected of his own people the throne went up over the mountain looking back weeping because his own even beloved children that turned on him down and he thrown him says and he wept over Jerusalem as he went up now it was the Jews that Yael crucify him crucify him you know let his blood be on us and on our children they yelled that but now and for them to do that God had to intentionally blind them so that they were not recognized - Messiah was God had to intentionally blind them and by intentionally blinding them that gave the Gentiles we are the Gentiles that gave us an opportunity to understand who Christ was praise a look but there's coming a time where the Jews are going to hear the same lessons that you hear right now and they're gonna very hearts are gonna be open to receive who Christ was and you know the Bible say that they'll actually questions of where you get their wolves in they say in the house of my friends and they're gonna realize the very Messiah that they've been praying for looking for all these years that already come and they crucified there on the side say they'll go what the Bible said I'll go into mourning before that happens the bride has it get ready for a rapture look at it it says the son of David setting on mountain Olives rejected by his own beloved and set up their weeping over Jerusalem said how off would I have hovered over you as the hen does her brood but you have not now i'ma read something here out of a wild little Bethlehem just showing how David was a perfect tight amen on the Lord Jesus wild little Bethlehem's that David here is a type of Christ Bethlehem because christ is david's son here he's standing there crying for a drink of that water and his desire was a command his desire davis desire you understand davis desire was a command if Davis desire was a command what about God's desire it should be a command to us right his desire was a command I sent to those who loved him three of those men pulled their swarms in 15 miles all David when it was just was just water from a particular whale and because he actually spoke his desire men fought through the Philistines that go get David just a cup of water from that from that from that we'll just test a little water from that way we're gonna bring this today I mean it looked and seemed like any water would have satisfied but David said he wanted from a particular place in those men they threw in lies down in order to bring that water to leave it look at it he says it was desire his desire was in command I said to those who loved him three of those men pull their swords and fought 15 miles of men down to that city while others fought keeping their men were gallant fighting men those Philistines twice their size some of them but they were men gallant who could fight one of them slew still stood alone handed and killed eight hundred men right around him in one day they were great men they trusted God they had faith in their leader and they cut his way down through down through until while some of them some of them cut and the other one got a bucket of water and they cut their way back through another 15 miles of men and brought that up to David so he could drink it now David didn't know that they were doing that now the other thing about David wants to gots the water and realize that these men at play took their took their lives in our hands David just pour the water out as a drink offering to God so that I can't drink this I mean these men have laid their lives down just to me so I came I gotta I just gotta just pour this out to God as a drink offer right and look at this says here Christ is represented here in this both King and warrior because he cut his way through he broke the enemy's lines of death he broke the enemy's lines that will we might have eternal life the waters of eternal life he come through even to death and took death upon himself and died the death and come back we might have eternal life he's both King and warrior we didn't conquer it's already conquered we never conquer death he conquered death forest he is our David of this day he conquered death Bethlehem's bread and water we thank God for that what our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ did for us he had to conquer death for us see the last enemy that had to be destroyed was death but that was the last enemy that had to be destroyed and and now it's believers you know we don't even fear death because of what Christ did at Calvary a man that lasts intimate is gonna be on our feet was death now we look at death of different ways believers we call death the Buckey and and it's the budget that actually pulls us into the presence of Almighty God hallelujah Church time I'm excited about that I thank God for it let's look at this you know Jesus a man was the one he's out David for today he conquered death a man he's the one that did that he's both King and warrior now there was a time where Jesus was debating on whether to take the route of death that was in the Garden of Gethsemane now I want to pick up something I want to go back they man to our scripture and but we're at 2nd of Samuel 24 but we're going to pick this up in first chronicles 21 so stay with me here now I want to say this ahead of time for my Bible readers I got if I got any Bible readers in the house all right but my Bible readers that in the house if you were to read 2nd Samuel 24 and you were to read 1st chronicles 21 you would find multiple multiple discrepancies I wanna I want to just make it very clear because that way you know if you if you to read it you come back brother Jack why I say this is why I say that I'm letting you know ahead of time before you read it you will find multiple discrepancies now here is my faith regardless of the discrepancies Amen I still believe the word and if I can do that with the Bible no matter what you find in this message I still believe it oh my God my God my God my God all right just stay with me here we're gonna pick this up and and the first chronicles 21 and I just want to bring out a couple things to you we can today thank you Jesus just pick this up the first round says I'm gonna go to verse 18 I'll leave it for you to read the rest of it but verse 18 is where where I want to read from it says that then then the angel of the lord commanded gat to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar unto the Lord and the threshing floor Ford and the jebusite and and David went up at the saying of gat which he's fake in the name of the Lord and Orrin and turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hit him hit themselves now Orrin an was threshing wheat now let me just kind of break in here a little bit there here and there as we're just kind of picking up this I want I want to give you just a couple things if I can before I go further I'm stopping at verse 20 just remind me that I'll come back to it if I could why you're why you are there at a man first Chronicles twin just go to the first verse and I want you to just notice something here Wow while we're there while we are there because when I read for you second Samuel 24 and one it said and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say go to number Israel and Judah now let's look at first guarana khals chapter 21 verse 1 it says and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel now wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I Steve discrepancy here all right because first kilometers telling me that Satan did this amen but but but in second Samet 24/7 God did this we gotta try to make these things make sense now you know I'm just looking at a little note here amen Bob and I love the way they put this set in every vent and every vent garden Satan are often involved in everything oh my god and every in the same event you got both God and the devil involved in it me Jesus amen I don't care what it is that you're going through you go find both opposing forces in the same events do you understand whether women wear this up let us get the job you go find the God and the devil right there miss to the top hello somebody God could be making a way by the devil will try to get in there somehow unless that thing up relationships God and the devil you name it whatever it is you gonna find them Bo let me just give you like what the Indian chief says Whitman is warning us since they see see see see see you know brother and I will talk about the Indian chief and the Indian chief was you know was there had just become a Christian now God is involved in saving the man you can see God saving the man but the devil is never try that man salvation say you know say uh say say chief how you getting along and they say uh pretty bad pretty good say pretty bad pretty good what kind of answers that seems I can't say yet pretty bad pretty good he said well could you break it down a little bit move on me I believe it was a missionary talking to the Indian chief and he was sharing his story over brother branham he's the same say you say pretty bad pretty good he said he said well help me understand a little bit more he says like Oh one shoulder I got a white dog and then on the other shoulder I got a black dog then he said both dogs are just talking to me all the time so sorry they say they say well I thought they say cheaper which which one of the dogs win cheap which which one other which which which dog is winning in your life is it is it the white dog that a black dog if they say said well the one that's winning is that it depends on the one that I feel the most that's the one that wins see no matter what an answer in every bit of life you gonna have evil and do it you know have the devil trying to pull you into one direction with God leading you to go somewhere else everything you do is gonna be that way look at it they say God and Satan are often involved in the same event but for different causes they said God is involved so that the believer might be instructed to grow but Satan is involved so he can try to discredit the believer and also discredit God himself so so so when we look at this situation we can see a man there's something that happened here we and we want to understand David's trying to number the people and he delighted in this oh god y'all work with me here just for a little bit he delighted in this what he was doing trying to count his warriors he wanted to see how big his army was there you go he wanted he was his heart was being lifted up and he wanted to see how great his army was how much he had accomplished you all remember you know brother Felix I was talking to brother Felix one time and I was just blessed by his answer I said brother he had a business that he runs and I said brother Felix I say how many customers you got he said brother Jack I don't count my customers I say huh every business owner knows how many customers they got like how come you only say he said you remember how David was counting that army I don't say I didn't want to count my customers because whoever God sent me and blesses me to you know bless me to do work with thank God for that but I don't ever want to count them and try to get my heart lifted up I said brother I appreciate that see there anything we do we got to stay humble see because cuz this is where this we're gone a Satanist where that battle because you know here you might be doing something God but the devil gonna be right there to try to elevate you and when Satan kind of gets your heart lift it up just a little bit God got to do something to bring you right back that you got to watch your heart and everything and sometimes be so humble you just be missing it oh my god I be you know oh lord help us you know sometimes people have that that fake humility yeah I know what that is they taught real self I mean so some mouse can't even hear they talk so soft that faith humble humbleness that's not it based on what's coming up children laugh we know what's in your heart it's not half soft you talk just get that stuff up at your heart glory to God to some things you don't even need to say no matter how soft his b instead still don't need to be seen it come on church glory to God so Davis heart was being checked in this situation his heart was being checked now now now now I want you to understand I'm the notes that you know I got from my Bible here they said this that's taking a census was not wrong he want the number two people taking the census was not wrong because God had already done that if you go back in the Book of Numbers just think about the title numbers God is actually telling them the number the people right so it wasn't it wasn't taking census God had done that God himself had previously ordered Moses to make to censuses that's the numbers one chapter 1 and also numbers chapter 26 however in this case Satan seized upon the growing pride of David's heart and to incite him into taking a census right so the King might have ground of boasting God is the control of all things he allowed the deed to be done as to bring David to a place of humility he and reality so that's why when you look there in the scripture and once one script of Sam Satan did another Satan script of saying God didn't know God allowed Satan to do it that does that clear up one of the discrepancies God allowed Satan to do it and sometimes God allows Satan to do things a see how we gonna respond how are you gonna react alright that's just one of the discrepancies now let's Colt let's go on back to the scripture here and read a actually I'm gonna give you a few few more before I break into something else and another discrepancy in this is they record in one chapter one book only eight hundred thousand valiant men that Druce wart along with five hundred thousand from Judah the the scripture says 1,100,000 from Israel and four hundred and seventy thousand from Judith our numbers are off here alright you'll find these I'm just pointing them out for you one of them say seven years of famine and the other one says three years of famine which one is it now i'ma tell you that give use of this references I'm not putting my Bible down I'm still gonna be reading it there's reasons for it and if you want to study it you can it's all not there on the internet you can find why the discrepancies I mean people have given a life to try to prove why the discrepancy there I'm not focusing on it I was just some church on Friday night I said you know there's people I could show you quotes on where brother Branham might have brought in seven years of tribulation verses three and a half years of tribulation I can show you quotes on both sides Alleluia right but the quit but my thing is I don't have time to show you quotes from that they try to prove which one is it the reason because I'm not gonna be here I'm not gonna be in the tribulation so I study the tribulation here's the lovely well I said David paid 50 shekels in second semi 2424 but first first chronicles 21 25 says that David paid 600 shekels for the same property right so we see some differences here now one of the one of the reasons why they said it said what David paid for in chronicles was the entire area not just the threshing floor right so the the the the the 50 shekels might have been just for the threshing floor where he built the altar but he also had he paid for the entire area the entire area David bought the entire area now just stay with me here just a little bit now there's reasons for all of that and let's just look at this let's go back to description first chronicles chapter 21 verse 20 now for me I believe the devil desires that we focus on discrepancies I'm not doing that I just brought it to your attention I did that intentionally because in this message people are focused on discrepancies right some of the people focus on discrepancies but here in this story amen I'm bringing you some of the discrepancies and I think Satan's desires that we focused on the discrepancies rather than the element of truth and what I see in this story is a scarlet thread I don't want us to catch that there's a scarlet thread a thread of redemption here don't look at the description see the discrepancies look at what God is trying to bring to your attention through this Oh Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm at verse 20 so so now we understand you know David actually chose the Prophet gasps told him that you got to choose what what it's going to be and David shows that it would be you know a plague that God was sending plague amongst the people and he wanted he didn't want to pretty much be running be running from an enemies he to know that he just put his put his faith in God on whatever God decided that's what he was gonna allow to happen now let's let's pick this up it says an aura and turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves that awning was threshing wheat and as David came to Orin am born and looked and saw David and went out of the threshing floor and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground then David said to Orrin and grant me the place of this dressing floor that I may build an altar there in unto the Lord thou shalt granted me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people and oil and said to David take it to thee and let my lord the King do that which is good in his eyes lo I give thee the oxen also for Brunt offerings wait a minute that word out of me something to y'all now run off remember that it's gonna be the whole sacrifice and where you have to put the burnt offering outside the camp oh my hello can I give you out something can I have that picture here this is what or nan-oh this is what orden and home this is what David wanted right here in Jerusalem right here in this whole despot this is what big was this is what this whole story is all about right here and if Orden an onus and notice now the angel Lord told David to go to Ornan and purchase this not no no don't go anywhere else in the State of Israel I want you to go to or Nan's house see just like I say it looked at you told Abraham go to Mount Moriah specific places to go and do things they that had to go right here and get this from Orlan and I notice he had to purchase it because Orlan wanted to give it to him but he had to purchase it can y'all y'all just y'all bear with me just a little bit just a little bit longer I'm just dropping these things up he had to purchase this spot not have it give it to him all right I'm just stay with that's keep that thought now let me go back to the scripture let me go back to the scripture I'm going back where that stop that I'm verse 23 I believe or dad said on a day that take it to thee and let my lord the King do that which is good in his eyes though I give thee the option also for burnt offers and the threshing instruments for wood and the week for the wheat offerings I give it all and King David said to or nay but I will verily buy it for the full price for I will not take that which is that that which is dine for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings without cause David say I came off of this without a cause can I just break into that keep me at verse 24 I want to break in that because I was reminded of something that happened in scripture over a matthew chapter 4 and also in Luke chapter 4 Jesus would faced with three great temptations hallelujah brother branham calls it the three major assaults Matthew chapter four verse through three through through four he was told to turn the stones into bread Satan come and won him to use his own power on his self to feed him want to feed himself he was hungry and man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal he'll rob he'll beg he'll borrow anything see he had that appetite and Satan used his first great major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome outcome with and used it on himself he didn't use it on himself no he used it on others that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't for him though amen he could have done it he certainly could have done it I'm reading here a man out of other message how can I overcome I'm just reading bits and pieces so don't try to pull this up brother branham also says in Matthew four or five through seven Jesus was tempted to be a show-off right says now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on the temple jump off sheet I'll give you a skip before because it's written he give his angels charge over thee lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone he barely up to make him a show up to show his authority and no true servant of God ever does that they don't want to be show off now this was the last thing that happened in this way and this great temptation is made your salt the third assault was found in matthew 4 verse 8 through 10 and what was happening here is that he was trying to get Jesus he was going to give him the kingdoms if he would just bow down and and and and and worship Him see just like David couldn't take this land from or land and now I love you if you if you caught it there's two different names that was mentioned in Scripture one was Aruna and one was Ord and there's a reason for that I'll get to it in a second but but he was he was trying to get him to - by I mean he say I'm going to give us you said no no I need the bike because I can't offer anything I can't offer burnt awful without a cost so here here Matthew 4 8 through 10 we said I'm gonna give you the kingdoms of this world if you just bow down and worship me brother Branham tells us that what Satan was doing was trying to get Jesus to take a kingdom without a Calvary you can have the kingdom without a Calvary say Satan want a Christ to take the kingdom without the cross Satan wanted to give Christ a kingdom a man without having a cavalry right because see because of Calvary hallelujah the price of sin had been paid and if he had not taken Calvary we wouldn't be able to sit where we're sitting at right now so so the same way David had to pay stop there for the same place that Jesus would died on Jesus had to pay something in order to redeem us Oh church is so beautiful it's so beautiful when you just look at these things I want to I just I just I'm I'm just blessed by I'm absolutely blessed by seeing Christ how he just his store is just all throughout the scripture and say the devil wants you to focus on the discrepancies but to miss in the scarlet thread brother Ram said he had a he won a kingdom without Calvary says remember he was trying to get him to forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost it says he could have took the kingdom but he must he must come back he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me Satan he didn't do it Church I'm so glad that our Lord and Savior did not take the kingdom without the cross hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I I just I just I think God for him let me uh let me let me just finish up this aid man the scripture glory glory and I'm gonna bring you in you know just just bring your attention to a couple of other things if I can look at this says in verse 24 first group first chronicles 21 says and King David said to or Dan made but I would barely buy it for the full price but I will not take that which is dying for the Lord nor offer burnt offerings without costs so David gave - or Dan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight and David built there an altar unto the Lord and offered and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering God answered from heaven by fire now I want you to understand let's go on saying the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sport again into the sheath thereof so what was happening is that this dis death angel because Davis heart got lifted up the death angel begin to go all throughout Israel going all throughout his room and dying everywhere pestilence it dropped I mean and pretty much God wiping out his army see the Lord gives the Lord that's what David should have been thinking about but but here God's wiping out everybody and as the angel orders approaching Jerusalem he comes to Jerusalem and when it gets there they see the angel lord give me they just strike right there and that's where they begin to crime and begin to repent but why was it stopped in Jerusalem Oh My Jesus I want you to think about it why did it stop right there in Jerusalem why why why why did they find the angel or at and right above a right of a horn and stretching floor because God knew that that's where amen the penalty for sin would be pain is intrusive l'm at the spot where horn an old that's where Calvary was gonna be it happened at Calvary stay with me stay with me this are diverting up here in this verse verse 26 David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord and he answered him from heaven by fire from the altar of burnt-offering and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his floored again into the sheath thereof at that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite then he sacrificed there for the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at Gibeon but David could not go before it to inquire God for he was afraid because of the sword of the Lord of the sport of the Ange of the Lord now the tabernacle was in Gideon but the tabernacle was moved to Jerusalem we'll get him to that a little bit later can I tell you a little bit about a ruler or an an this man had two names in one chapter in 2nd 2nd samuel NT for his his name is recorded as a ruler but in 1st 1st chronicles 21 his record is borning now here's the thing Orlan meant light of the sun light of the side he owned the property where we were gonna see a dual sunrise the SU in WA tries one day but because of Calvary and Jesus rising from the grave the s o n also rose and gave light to mankind that's why the man's name was Orlan I just the other thing about his name Aruna man arc song or curse I thought about curse it came to my heart Galatians 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree where did that happen that at a ruler's threshing floor so I'm not I'm not getting caught up on the discrepancies cuz there's a scarlet thread going right through all the discrepancies and that's what I'm keeping my eye on these are the things that happen at County go to rule us by his threshing floor and not just expression for but by the whole territory about a whole territory and where that mosque of Omar is that was the territory of Aruna let me fit a shot that day on Calvary that day on Calvary listen to this the one great important thing that Kaveri means to us and the world is it it's settled the same question once for all see that's why that's why I would you know Jesus in Matthew 4 and Luke 4 he couldn't take them propositions of the devil he had to go to Calvary he could I mean if he had not going to Calvary we would all be finished he says Calvary it's settled the sin question once it's wrong I love that that's why when he went to Calvary you understand Calvary being the place of skull Calvary been Mount Moriah caliber being a rule of stretching floor Calvary all this happened at Calvary and here you know he goes to Calvary and by going there to this place of skull and atom skull being there blood drop him down there right through the cracks hit atom skull pretty much saying the sin has been settled Adam it's no law against you know more the price has been paid it all happened at Calvary that's why the devil could not divert him all this had to happen here listen the same question settled the same question once a for all man was found guilty of saying that sin was a penalty that him that no man could pay the penalty was so great until there wasn't anyone that could pay the penalty says I truly believe that God ordained it that way that the penalty would be so great that no man could pay it so he could do it himself see there was a penalty paid for david numbering those people but here God himself knew that where when it went when it was settled when it when he ceased he taste I'm actually there's another scripture I mean I didn't go all the way through it but if they got repented himself he would he say I've seen all the the the the the shedding of blood I'm repenting myself since you can stay your hand told her that thing just kind of stopped right there don't slay any more and where the death angel stopped that gallery you know what I tell you I told the Lord that I wanna I wanna fall more in love with him and I want to preach to help people fall more in love with Jesus you can just see him all through the scripture nothing nothing is in the Bible by chance of my accident everything was very specific everything was very specific he did all the time in Calvin I mean a room have probably didn't know he didn't know his main met curse people got a rune up they don't know it and maybe tell them don't call me that call me horn an both names that mean oh my lord not Lord now the penalty stand was death and we were all born in Staunton shaped and they could come to the world speaking last therefore there wasn't none of us that was worthy or they could find no one on earth that was worthy let me let me go on to justice one other quote here out of God hide himself in simplicity than revealing himself at the same this is just this is just beautiful the one thing I did I want to tell you we all know that David himself said too much blood and it could not build God a temple but God did allow David to build an altar on the very same spot that he would be offered an altar to offer burnt offerings you know David did this David it but David did build an altar here let me I'm God hot in himself Lisa didn't reveal himself the same these little places data could not build a true tavern a tavern I forgot because he wasn't prepared for doing there was nothing he could do he was immortal and shed life so is it today to us we're not prepared to build the truths have an act of God there's only one can do that and it's big it's being in its construction now but this little Tabernacle along with the temple that Solomon built him and along with the others are only temporary places of worship until the time comes when the real tabernac will be set up upon the earth and the righteousness shall reign from Sky to sky and there will be no more sorrow there will be there will be no funerals preached than that Tabernacle thank God for that there'll be no more weddings so the wedding will be one great wedding for eternity what a time that will be searched I just just go back to that picture and just finish this off I just want to show you a man just what all this meant this is why people fighting over this land and everything like that but this means so much to the Jews that means so much to the Muslims and this is why the Muslims this is what I I think if I'm not mistaken this represents about 37 acres of land this is on top of the mountain this is on top of the mountain one of the things I found out there you know we we we we look at a mountain in like man that just big you know but we went to Masada and when you look at it just in this big rock mountain just a huge rock mountain and you wonder how in the world we got a call the cable car we went up to the top when we got up to the top you get up on top of that all the flat land just acres of land they built multiple they took to put two palaces there and you wonder how did they lose the place right but uh you know but here you know when you get up to some of these mountains here it's just all this land on top of the mountain and this spot it means so much to the Muslims it means so much to the Jews it also means so much to we Christians because this is where our Lord and Savior this is where he went this is where Abraham went this is where aruna own land the all of this is at the same spot thank God thank God for what happened at Calvary I just I just appreciate more I appreciate the Lord I'm just I'm blown away so I'm already I've already led you into something else if David could not build an altar here but he made preparation for his son to build a temple here this is the same spot where as Solomon's Temple Stewart so Solomon stood with Calvary is his temple stood where Calvary is so that's the next sermon I'll talk about that but Turk I'm grateful for my Lord and Savior did at Calvary let's give the Lord a hand the priests mine let's pray father I'm I'm just blown away when I look at the Scarlet thread of redemption all throughout scripture stories that we've read for years but God now you quicken these things to us you help us to understand what this is truly all about why it was even recorded in Scripture what would be the purpose then we see the recordings in both 2nd Samuel 24 1st chronicles 21 with CDs Berry's recordings and some of the things are a little different the numbers that are listed are a little different and it's Satan's job in order to try to give us the focus on the differences but it's the holy spirit that helps us to follow the scarlet thread not the differences does it really matter how many men what really matters is how many men were counted or lured or whatever whatever else might have happened there what what really mattered is that that place the ordinance on place where a ruler on there the same man Aruna Ornan father had the names have different meanings that same place where the plague of death will stay and there are significance there because mankind Adams race we've been plagued by death one thing that they all would go all the way back to the beginning thy seed shall possess the gate of this of his enemy Lord the one thing that they all had a problem that was death because of what you did there at Calvary we no longer have to fear death Paul said death where is your sting grave where is your victory thank you Lord for gallery a pray Lord that this means so much more to us we need to fall more in love with you Satan tried to divert you you try to get you to take another path no no you see even though it was tempting for you to receive the kingdoms and everything he tried to do that without Calvary Calvary you knew was said of the same question Calvary you knew Adams skull was sitting right there Calvary you knew these things just as in Davis day the plague of death was stained because of the altar that was built and the sacrifice that was accepted by God answer my fire also Lord we know today that the plague of death is stained and we can come bowl into your presence because we have accepted what happened at Calvary Lord we praise you we thank you and we glorify you we exalt you for who you are sin Jesus name we pray amen amen I encourage you if you don't know Jesus get to know him get to know him as soon as possible give him all your heart the Bible says that as many as believed on him to them he gave power to become sons of God I encourage you believe on him serving with everything you got if you've never repented of your sins you find yourself a place where you can just repent be be real with God ask them to forgive you of your sins servant of everything you got it's worth it it's worth it but the Sodom would you come and close us out on today amen god bless you Church God richly bless you amen Jesus came and did it just for me anybody believed that we were there in the in Jerusalem and I can't remember exactly where it was but I was asked to just leave in a word of Prayer I think I might have been right there at the garden tomb and when I opened my mouth and a word of prayer acidic is either garden tomb the Garden of Gethsemane I can't remember exactly where but my prayer was God I'm a little selfish right now as I stand here in this place that I come from I'm selfish selfish enough to think that you would have came all the way from glory to bring redemption story if it was only me if I was the only person that needed it you would have did it just for me and I've just told God how much I appreciated him I appreciated that Lord that he what he would leave his front he would leave his throne and come down and just do something like that just to me Church I believe this morning there some others that are in this place this afternoon you feel the same way that he would have done just for you I encourage you whatever you do fall more in love with Jesus just love him more everything love the Lord Jesus as much as you possibly can he loves you he loves you dearly just for me stand to your feet and he'll be singing Jesus came and did it just for me [Music] [Music] just Jesus came you sustained [Music] [Music] so much more today means
