the presence of the Lord's man so good to be in the house of God this morning just a couple announcements that I wanted to make mention of before we go into the word of the Lord we want to wish our precious brother Jeffrey a happy birthday amen today I have another year here man we just appreciated the Lord we are certainly monitoring all the changes that have be coming forward to the next couple couple of weeks we will be communicating to the church once we will just kind of change our schedules but for right now we want to kind of continue to go the path that we have been going until we get all the information I know that they're starting to open up some of the non-essential businesses and things like that so look like we're trying to get back on on don't schedule but as we get more information we'll certainly let you know but for right now let's just kind of keep going with the path going the path that we have it going and we'll continue our virtual service so Wednesday at

couple of weeks and we will communicate that to you so regarding giving as you know we have it we're actually doing something that's very biblical you know in the scripture what they would do with with giving they actually had a little box that they were taken for they they their money in remember Jesus told the story about the woman that casts our two pimps into the Treasury it was a little box that they would put their money in so that's where we're going right back to Scripture when we do things like this and so we have the little box amen there for those that are inside the sanctuary you can put it inside the box either when you're coming in and when you're going out it might be something that we might continue to do cuz it kind of helps you know move the service along as well so we'll keep you informed but those that are online they menu actually have two options now there used to be one option but as of this week you got two options you can give either through PayPal or you can give through cash I believe that that I need right you cannot you can give through cash happen if you want to and as you can see there on the screen Church cash up account appears I don't know dollar sign but spirit and truth teeth the spirit chief Tabernacle you can give through that also when you're given if you want to give through PayPal we also just changed the the email address that you are sending to it used to be pastor at John four to three that over but we're actually changing it to giving at John four to three dot org so if you would use that as the friend that you're donating to your you know make sure you to PayPal transaction has to be sent to a friend and use the email address of giving at John four to three dot org a man praise the Lord so let's just pray over our giving way man at this time and then we'll go on in the service father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity that we have to be able to give you have blessed us through this this this time of distress and trouble we're not just in our nation but all over the world but God you have sustained your people you have proven to be Jehovah Jireh you have proven to supply all our needs according to your riches of glory and father we just we just appreciate all that you've done people's businesses have been blessed even during this time and Lord you have just done so much so we trust o God that you would bless our giving even now and that you Lord would just continue to meet the needs of this church of me the needs to get people we thank you in advance for the new church in the new school that you have already blessed us with them God we know that we're gonna walk right into it and so God we just give you all the glory and all the honor and all the praise for Jesus name we

somebody giving it to us but it does have some things that that key creates a few problems so we want to get something we want to get something nice a man so we're still taking out donations there are some envelopes on the table if you wanted to I'll open it's right before the piano you can do that if you want to put it in cash up if you want to put it in PayPal just say for the p.m. but we are still taking donations for that a man as we want to purchase that next month is our desire to have that here in the church amen praise the Lord all right well let's turn a man in our Bibles Thank You musicians amen appreciate you all this morning amen let's just turn the first Kings 19 I'm gonna read just one verse out of this chapter and and then from there we will just start a path of a thought I don't feel like I'm gonna be able to get all of this thought out today so we'll go as far as we can and and then we'll just let the Lord have his way so here in 1st Kings 19 verse 15 and the Lord said unto him go return on that way to the wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint has al to be king over Syria and let me just keep going and jehu the son of nimshi shalt our North to be king over Israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abel Mahalo shall darlin ought to be profit in thy room and it shall come to pass to him that escaping the sort of has a ljj who slayed him that escaped a--the from the sword of Jehu show Elijah's Lee yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Bale and every mouth which have not kissed him ain't man a man a man praise the name of the Lord let's just bow in a word of Prayer father we thank you for the privilege to read the Word of God but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to help us understand what it is that we're reading and not only understand it but to apply it in the day in which we live so god help us to catch by revelation the things Lord that must be known to us so that we could position ourselves for [Music] overcome to overcome father in this hour and now Lord we just pray that you just take control over the thought I thank you for the Saints that have gathered here in the sanctuary those that are joining us online thank you for them as well and pray father that you would get all the glory and all the honor from our thoughts today in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated praise the Lord so as you are aware the Lord has us on a journey here this year being twenty twin it is perfect for stepping into the vision and we've been just kind of dissecting and taking different parts of the Angels words to the Prophet when he told him to pick up his pen and write and we just been trying to bring the church through that because that the angel spoke about us the angel was writing writing to us right and and I think it's it's very important for us to understand you know what what's going on and and where we are I believe just as Mary was predestinated by Almighty God to fulfill the scripture of a virgin conceiving a man and how the Word of God had to wait for Mary to come on the earth Mary was not born by accident if you all study the life of Mary you would know it was even difficult mom had a problem even you know I think conceiving and the parents were old and and and when Mary finally was conceived and I think her father had already passed away and you know just a lot of difficult things but yet married was ordained by God to come through that union and to be here to fulfill Scripture Amen for that for that time I believe the angel the Lord wrote things I mean spoke to the Prophet the Prophet became a scribe he wrote these things down and he knew that there was a people coming that would and offense what was being written so I can tell you that your birth was not a mistake a man your I don't care who say you know you shouldn't have been here whatever not another that none of that matters when you recognize who you are and according to God's plan that none of those other things matter right so I'm trying to help the church see that we are we're coming into something a man and I believe this is a perfect year for us to kind of look at this so I'm going a little further in our fault now I'm not using the title of a step into the vision a man that's my inspiration so we're gonna be in that inspiration for a little bit but the title for today is rejecting the word in your day right rejecting the word in your day all right hallelujah all right so just just bear with me a man I read this scripture here in 1st Kings 19 because it goes along with what the angel spoke to the Prophet in pick up your pen and write and this is another section of just a continuation of where we have been I'm going to start off today by reading from spoken words original seed part 2 but this is this what I read to you is what the angel was saying to brother Branham the original time that he gave this thought to us is out of the message spoken word as original seed then he took it later on and I took the thought and put it inside the church age book as well so in the church age book is dressed up a little bit more but but I wanted to go back to the original time when he was under inspiration in the very first time and brought it to the Turks Oh hallelujah I hope y'all with me hey man so here he says this in spoken words original seed Part 2 it says like Elijah and and just just so that you you know when he spoke spoken word his original seat if I recall correctly this was a six-hour sermon hallelujah it was so long they had to break it up into two services like what we doing eight man right now we were breaking things up in two services but but you know it was it was necessary and needful for the Bride of Christ to hear this spoken word is the original feat even there's there's a message in the title of the sermon right so so here the Prophet is telling us something says like Elijah after that mighty vindicated prophet that the Word of God came to have finished preaching his message to the modern American groups of the first lady with their Bob hares and Jezebel paint groups right God confirming his prophet every time he prophesied hallelujah we even have a prophet that wasn't missing preface it hit the mark glory to God and I know people trying to find all kind of things a man that he missed hearing he mr. muoi studied the message that's one and you just take it what somebody else you need to go back and see what the message says the reason people get all confused and messed up is because they are they leaving today old understanding how study the message for yourself glory to God don't just take what somebody put out on the Internet anybody can put anything on the Internet I was telling somebody you know I'll take that down this for a second I'm coming back you know even without with with all this going on right now with with you know this justice just covet 19 right now somebody could go to the Internet and they can say brother Jack got Cohen 19 just like that and you know what folk will be calling folk would be texting phone said brother Jack October night night night they haven't checked the information they just spread it like like wildfire without sure and this is what's happened with people coming against the myth somebody just come up with something that they begin to spread you know why spec because you had a spirit [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] it's a spirit that causes people to do this amen and that's why I don't come against a person I come against the spirit I got a faith for the person so my god alright let me just kind of keep going on because I look at what the the angel sings hallelujah glory to God so you won't find it like this and in the church textbook that's why I had to go back to spoken word is the original seed and I'm reading again a man it says like he larger after that mighty vindicated prophet that the Word of God came to have finished preaching his message to the modern American groups of the first lady with their bobbed heads a man and Jezebel paint groups God confirming his prophet every time he prophesied it was for truth amen look at this now God had to call him off the field until he played that generation with mighty please very early at a young age and a young age God called a prophet all right all the field amen yeah leave that generation with my tea please and if we not experiencing one of the mighty plates of any generation the whole world was shut down entire world that's a plague a man if said Julia playing that generation with mighty bleeds for rejecting the message of its profit Oh hallelujah you know this thing that's just it's just I can't help I'm looking through prophetic insight we know the role that that Rome place a man according to Scripture we know that brother Branham brought things out to us they may had a quarter in revelation 17 18 and all that we know we're wrong place and earlier we were watching how they would just tell us that up smoke cases of kovat and and and Italy there there was anywhere but for somehow a man they stopped talking about that because you want to know where no we're not aware of where the most cases are found in your country and the Prophet told us that there was a hope that would come from your country hallelujah we better watch these things a man the Catholic Church is very involved in health care all right let's just keep our eyes on some things a man not not to not to be in fear glory to God but but understand prophecies about to be forfeit son the brother Branham spoke about somebody put out a quote just yesterday showed up brother Branham talked about we're gonna walk around with masks on our face in a quote he said the planes were coming to people you're walking around with Mac's with masks on the face are we doing it the brothers saying we would do it Oh hallelujah glory to God alright let's keep going hey man he says God sent him into the wilderness and hiding not even the king could call him out and them that tried to persuade him against the will of God died for doing so he says Oh God that's what the prophecy say since but when God spoke to his faithful prophet by a vision this is it out of the wilderness he come with us says the Lord what did he do straight to the word back to the word he went but brought the 12 stones and rolled them together now there's a lot that was staying in that particular quote that over time we're gonna try to work and get it all out a man but but I just want to just kind of go look at this desk that's the let me just put that that's the foundation of my thought that particular quote is the foundation of my thought but let's go on a little further we're talking about rejecting the work in your day now let's go to this next quote out of the unpardonable sin hey hallelujah glory glory glory glory since now we know one thing now look here he says here's the whole captain off of every verse in the Bible we'll just take it in a few minutes to show to show you that every place it was spoke of of the unpardonable unpardonable sin it says the power comes over here to cap it off percent if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin now you need to understand that that that verse that brother branham's quoting here Paul said if we sin willfully after receiving knowledge of the truth now we got it we got to inject here you don't even have to receive the truth watch in onesearch read to say the profits a knowledge of the truth and if you reject that you're in a dangerous position all right let's keep going let's keep going it says if we sin willfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin then that's got to be the unpardonable sin it's sinning willfully you know coz back then you know they would say uh you know if you murdered somebody if you if you had an abortion or something like that that was the part unpardonable sin but uh I mean my lord how some brothers put out a statement yesterday you know there's so many things that we we quantify as they're part of the stand now brothers put up some quote on on a baby being born out of wedlock right and we would say that's not a pardonable and brought out of us see when he had preached about it because the scripture tested a baby that's born awake for ten generations they not supposed to be able to come to the house of law can you imagine that Tim generate that child cannot come to the house of God there are children's children didn't even do anything wrong could come to the house of God but ten generations it was that way he said for the RAM said he didn't have nothing to get rid of that scene he said by the blood of Jesus Christ don't don't leave us in that conditioning more that's why don't transfer it on this blood that's right you don't realize how this black this black this black second generations free right to the races been set free by the blood one mistake has a Pentecost in generations not to be able to come a church right but the blood crisis that set us free from there I say well I what a blessing when we really begin to think about this you know but they was going on trying to find out what was the the sin that was done partible right but brother Branham say the sinners are partners when we sin wilfully they met after receiving miles of the truth and then we turn it down we stand in willfully now watch this he comes over says it says then that's got to be an honorable standard sitting willfully is that right he next steps will flee now what is then the next thing you have to find out what sin is look at what they say sin is disobedience sin is rejecting I love that you know I am I am watched people walk away from the words amen but even in there and I want to put a dismemberment I want to use this term in their so-called sinful condition amen they weren't going to church they was doing whatever they want to do they so-called sinful condition but yet on the inside of them they still have a respect for the message [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I'll bring them out of their conditions - hallelujah you're gonna be surprised what God does watch this he says sin is disobedience sin is rejecting now looking at a person now here's because normally says since I have a place here I want to show you the first place of this Scofield here when he wrote in the footnote here I believe it's found in Romans the third chapter and this verse that he's referring to a Roma Street says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God right all have sinned and come short of the glory of God that I nobody can point a finger and nobody else amen every one of us have sinned and come short of the glory of God and that is the descripton as he that is referring to it and if Scofield knows he says I believe miss found in Romans 1/3 Chapman he said here as he interpreted through western course in the footnotes he said sin sin is rejecting the revealed will of God Oh glory to God sin is rejecting the revealed will of God when we're seeing is in its initial form if to reject the revealed Word of God Oh will of God when God has revealed something as his will and to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject God do you understand you got nothing to the truth you got knowledge that God to the Prophet but you men you own determination to reject it that's blasphemy now you know and I'm gonna go a little further you can still keep going to church you can steal amen jicama side hallelujah you can still come outside I wanna see all right amen so so so Vincent this is very serious what we're talking about here says you might even have signs and wonders for your ministry but you still have black speaking rejected his revealed wheel and rejected his revealed word now watch this it says what was the first scene let's look at it says you go back here in Genesis 3 you may read it when you get home if you want to Genesis 3 when God with the Garden of Eden but Adam and Eve in there he told them things that that was his word that they could do with things they could not do so it's now watch when Satan come to Eve he said God hath said thou shalt not eat thereof but surely thou shall not die see ya then Eve willfully you can eat willfully doing something that she knew God said not to do is that right now look at it when Eve willfully the first sin that was ever committed is that right he willfully knowing the will of God and review sir doing is that right that's the first scene now you know I just I just kind of wanted to just stop there on that particular quote because brother Branham has laid it out the first sin that has actually hit the earth is when Eve willfully disobeys the revealed Word of God God says don't eat up this tree don't do this don't do that it's saying the very time that eat actually when I guess the reveal Word of God this was not this one this one mr. e can I put it that way this was not something that was hard for her to follow what happened is that Eve took another revelation read except that somebody else's interpretation and if I can Amen we can just be honest many folks today have accepted somebody else's interpretation of the world Oh hallelujah man I was I was looking at a scripture just yesterday just kind of meditating on this you know when Jesus died and rose again there was two stories that went out amen one was through the disciples that Jesus was risen a man and they began to go from disciple to disciple expressing that Jesus was risen and he would appear to those that had believed he was risen but you know they are the leaders religious leaders of that day the Pharisees the Sadducees they came up with a story and not only did they come over the story they paid soldiers to tell the story disciples stole the body from the - and we know secured you with that story [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] people like that influence and I'm keeping my eye on the Word of God the reveal worked Eve got mixed up because she walked away from the revealed Word she made a decision based on somebody else's interpretation hallelujah and so you can get our mixed up if you listen to somebody else's interpretation can actually question what has God shown you si si si si si can you do one mixed up only everybody else interpretation when Jesus asked him a question specifically he said first a good question who do men say that I am a son of man him now though Jesus student been talking about Jesus to death the disciples were hearing against some other reports in the length jesus knew all that he said who wouldn't mean say Oh some say Jeremiah no no imagine this if you if they're in conversation they hear one person say he chair your mind they heard somebody say he is a witch somebody that they got all types of conversations going I saw it wasn't say forget about what they said who do you say that son of man and when it got down to a personal question they had to give a personal answer Peters say that what the Christ the Son of God is saying let's start last time on my own flesh and blood your conversations didn't reveal this to you what you've been talking about a man in the chat room reveal this to you [Music] [Music] no can take it from glory glory stay with me here glory to God watch this now I want you to understand something since the beginning of creation the revealed word has been presented and people have an opportunity to accept it or reject it now remember amen my scripture my foundation is here on the first Kings 19 because in that day when God said the property lines on the scene they had no they had the opportunity to accept the revealed word or to reject the revealed word now I want you to understand something this is really bad for these people because uh I'm read to you out of first King 19 but to understand how they got that you need to understand first Kings 18 and the first James 18 there was a mighty demonstration where God answered by fire enlightened champion he said God answers by fire let hear me God they challenged the search Oh God glory to God but I mean this right between to peace when we say look we top of this young server would turn to bring our back to the one true Living God I'm here by this saying and say say don't answer my father to be gone okay y'all set up yet altar first now you can do that we do know God don't show up because otherwise if you went first we wouldn't even get a chance to see what the other ones are gonna try to do he let them go first I want to show you all that what you got is nothing I want to show you that you ain't got nothing a made you worshiping you praise it you got a brain service you've got a good organ [Music] a word for your name freeze team going they got an army put it just it just it just got this thing it'll be like I said not when your garter answered by fire you see we've got we're not just here just for the atmosphere we want a God says too much man y'all been going all day oh Dave nothing yeah I got nothing tell you what y'all move out the way and he started up it's in that coolest thing he got 12 stones brother Ed say he repented the Bible say he he he he repaired the altar and took a stone for each tribe and he put he put the halter back together to say now now he said I put some water down there grit to it water say put water down there game do it a third time make sure that by getting up I mean if I you getting extra water usually water gonna put it out but I said do it a third time I'll show y'all that my dog and say Lord now I've done things at your work it's my vision you showed me to come here do this now that you work now God show them that you are the God of Israel and I mean it when he said a man fire King and consume not only evil actions altar but it also consumed their all time it was proven that this was a God of Israel but you know other people even after agreeing turned and walked away I want to destroy you some I'm coming back to all that destiny with me that's our that's our foundation the revealed Word of God has been given to man since the very creation of man Adam had it he had it he projected it the reveal wheel and word of God he projected it a man Adam himself took on what you gave him and protected it and it created all the problem that's why we're dealing with Kovac right now a little bit because of what they need at the beginning but we can't just leave it on our leave we also all have sinned and come short of the glory of God so we all have something to do with this right now now that revealed word was given to Adam revealed Word was given to Eve I even looked at the days of Noah the revealed Word was given a man here they had the opportunity to get into the ark God God giving it and I want to tell you I've got a little hole here that I was sharing you know God brought Noah after 120 years of preaching the revealed word hallelujah and then the will of God for that day was get in this boat because Amen hallelujah and if you don't get it destruction is coming if you're not in the book everybody outside of the boat go die so the review of God get in the boat 120 years of preaching the same sermon over and over and over again now you know when Noah this famine finally got above God sealed it up now at that time it took seven more days before the rain came now what we call that is a lapse of time and then the lapse of time what God is doing is still trying to give grace to somebody do you realize the rapture it's already past I mean it should have happened a long time ago for the relative but the reason that has not because God is trying to give crazy to somebody I said Lord let it be one of my family members walked away from from the Word of God Jim Gray sokar's Amen if there's ever a time to pray that time is right now Church the revealed Word was given in North State they had it they rejected it they tried the revealed Word was given in Moses day and those that did not apply the blood amen the way the Prophet told them to apply it I want to make sure we got that now you know what and Moses takes somebody else coulda came up and said you know I know Moses said put it on the on the top of the door ain't man on the size of the door it on the top of the door but the Lord showed me just put a bucket at my door hallelujah and not now now if it was not according to what the Prophet said you don't listen to it I hope you church and the revealed Word came in Moses day they had to do it exactly the way homes are said do it otherwise there was gonna be death to the firstborn son how the revealed word came in John the Baptist day how where he's calling the people to repentance amen and what they need to do is be obedient to what John's message was and if they were being here can I put it this way if they will beat into John's message it was gonna be very easy for them to receive Jesus if they disobeyed it could not receive John's message how would they be able to receive Jesus can I go a little further how you gonna make a rapture itacare receive the message for this thing Oh hallelujah somebody the reveal word has been given and every day the revealed word was presented in Paul's day Paul was trying to get the people to see this Jesus was a manifestation of Old Testament scripture the things that they have been holding on to for year after year after year the sprinklers that they were problem hearing Jesus has manifested he's living out the scriptures and Paul trying to bring them to the revealed Word for their name they rejected it Paul said we call to the Gentiles can we go a little further the revealed Word was given an Iranian state the revealed Word was given in mark's dan colombo luther wesley and the revealed word has been given in our date the legacy in church ain't hallelujah people and every age have had the opportunity to either inject the reveal work i didn't say the word I said the reveal worked there's a difference there because see their search scriptures that I promise for your day hallelujah in the days of Jesus there were certain scriptures that Jesus was fulfilling but the Pharisees and Sadducees was missing the fulfillment but but history has a strange way of repeating itself because people are still missing scripture for their day Oh glory glory glory people have the opportunity either reject it or accept it now let's let's go a little further here I want to say Eve but the Prophet just told us that Eve willfully no wonder whether God refused to do it she rejected she fell in scene now she rejected the revealing word the Lord just kind of gave me this no thought the spirit of rejecting revealed word passed from Eve to her son because Cain was not Adams son I hope you whip in church the spirit that II manifested extra passed down to us on the Bible say she was the mother of all living but it did say that about Alan now there's so much more we can say that hallelujah they did not eat a banana they do not eat an apple and get pregnant Cragen's the Lord somebody a man I don't know what after you eating that got people pray amen so let's stop teaching that in the church hallelujah Amen we know how people get pregnant glory to God thank God he sent us a prophet to share the truth with a man you better hear now was not an apple and man it was a toll tree that adultery occur with the serpent and with Eve the surface stood on two feet praise God a man before he was Kirsten but on his belly he stood on two feet and when you read Genesis 3 you can see the star would have the ability to reason but yet he existed and cops what we had happened in the beginning that's why God gave out the punishments the chakra was included yes you think God just peaked on the surface no he was included Satan I know I didn't the serpent to do what he needs hey man all right praise the Lord and that's why the Bible said Cain was up that wicked one first job 3:12 who was the wicked one it was Satan in the serpent serving to have a serpent even Jesus Jesus [Music] [Applause] Oh give me the desires of my heart hallelujah but then pigs did not even have a choice was that they're doing that matter the old business no no no did an actual don't know don't know possession or nothing but here they got possessed by demons and women jumped off a cliff so the devil take over whatever he came you're getting a dog you're getting a cat sometimes you got to find praise the Lord somebody you got to bind the enemy you don't know how to double jump into that Hanuman did they're trying to bring home to you as a son of God you got authority over the environment that you eaten Oh stay with me please look at look at this I want to see this I want to see this so the spirit of radicular be a word passed from E to us Thunder came it went the can a man and we see it clearly because Cain had the opportunity when he was bringing his sacrifice to the Lord and I got some things here I can read it for you but maybe I'm trying to just share it brother Graham said Cain was a believer I got a call on him y'all need me to read I read it's been the message fellowship through reconciliation Cain he said was not an infidel give a give me a paragraph he 35 then he 35 I'll make sure that because somebody might say yeah he was a believer Oh hallelujah there's a lot that can be said look at this with the prophecy he says right there if only belonging the church is all God requires of a sinner to do penance belonging to the church God would be unjust to receive Abel and to reject King so see your worship ain't it discs of man we got a we got a powerful worship experience what about the word glory said to receive Anglin to reject cain both of them had a church came and ate my hat searches look at this it says then I'm not only that but can come and offer the sacrifice if sacrifice was all that God required us see that means you'll say well I'm gonna pay my tithes with my often required spirits it says I've sacrificed with all the other parts he'd be unjust to condemn Cain not only that but Cain was not a infidel Cain was a believer he says he was trying to find a reconciliation witness and Cain now honey you got to get this in your mind and then came to sit that is all to kneel down humbly trying to get God to come on the scene he wanna feel the Spirit of God came into him everything that he needs to do look at this now there I'm humbly raised up his hands oh yeah it sprays sincerely wrong churches amen it might be sincere but it sincerely wrong God look at people sincere he does he certainly does and you know what if you'd really that sincere God will bring him out of that situation not only not just bring you out he will present truth to you now here's another thing God ain't gonna force you to accept truth all he does is present it to you and you have to be the one to see that I'm gonna take it i'ma reject it now Canaan all this in Syria rejected truth since it leaked out he was trying to find wreckage this came down humbly raised up his hands and worship the Lord he was not a communist neither was he an infidel he was a believer but he didn't have the spiritual revelation look at that look at that says it when Abel I can imagine seeing Cain decorate the altar fine little isn't making it pretty all dolled up as we call it that's the way people think to think if they can build a great big church that I outshine the rest of them plus the seats put a $10,000 pipe organ in it and a crucifix all around it all over it they think that God will be pleased with that God ain't pleased with the works of the hands of man they're shifting sands now here Cain had the opportunity at this time because you know when he realized God was not accepting the sacrifice I mean audience with God direct communication with God God coming up said King you know how everything like this is not what I'm looking for King but maybe just give me the same thing your brother just gave me I'll take that king okay I'll be so happy with that all I need you to just keep in the same thing your brother this game rather than King just get up and give the same thing his brother game man blood all over me you're gonna take these proof these vegetables I know how can you accept my offering you know I'm gonna get you to accept my offer my brother will not be going to church anymore what I'm gonna do is kill his church so so that spirit still exists because you know your arcade what he did was rise up and actually killed his brother physically but today you ain't gotta kill physically brother branham said you can take a knife and stabbed in your brother's back just by talking about him if you kill his character you guilty of murder Laura my god right hey man we gotta be careful you know we can't we can't lose respect for how God has sent his foreigner can I put it that way we can't lose respect for that you know in the days of Elijah you want to know why children died she bears coming ate them up then we're calling the Elijah Oh ball head going up yeah your master winner why don't you go on up relevant upset and reasonable kids was in this condition is because of what they parents was saying in the house now you don't read that in the Bible but it is houses welcome to them kids they were under the influence of their parents can I tell you something some kids right now all messed up because of their parents parent delete a lot of the young people that's messed up today if you first if you really see them talking of them young people they have problems with their parents that's where the issue was it wasn't the message there wasn't a message they having a problem to message now they blame it on the message but they had a problem with their parents sometimes you know things are not explained properly I know many of people that's been told brother ran up said that's why we do it can you show me where he said it and then they got nowhere to produce where you said it they just heard a preacher say it so you're not listening to the message for yourself but if your parent a big cookie somewhere said we're right here where he said that's why we do it right here is where the Bible said that's why we do it right if you can if you can do that with my kids they don't have a problem receiving them well you just kind of making it up as you go see now you what you're doing is using the message as a tool to put somebody under your thumb and you just quote things and they ain't even gotta be there brother Adam said just show me where soon you see it's a whole bunch of men just either show me where it said I'll just play me to take anything give me anything but what happened is that we don't use that so long then the kids will not see n say what you say before he ain't saying the way you say rise up with rebellion can I tell y'all my god every billion caused it and reject even even wider worship even one day they going to church they doing all kind of stuff it is a lot of helpless say they get to a spot where they they just don't know where to go and I'll start because parent delinquency alright so let me go a little further here you know the word was given in everything we look at was we could see the revealed word was given every day and you had the opportunity to accept or reject a king did not accept the reveal where he rejected it and that created more problems for him a man a man but even then came rejected it I mean the grace of God just some powerful okay so you know when I leave the garden I got this mark on me and everybody I mean I said they say no you say everybody don't know what I did and they go they gonna come and kill me now put a mark on them so that they wouldn't kill that Greece was still covering pain y'all can now get this grace was covering a serpent seat if grace can come up a serpent's seat don't you think grace don't coming up I don't care what they've done grace can pull them out of wherever they are oh she uses let's go on let's go a little bit more in history Israel rejected the message for their day they rejected their messenger and they had to wait for deliverance and what brother Brett was saying says you know and I want to read this this coming up out of water from the rock but what he was saying is that when Moses came on the scene and Moses killed at one Egyptian it was time for deliverance at that time God was ready to deliver but because when Moses stepped out the Nexen killing Egyptian next to each son brothers argued and frightened and maybe one was given Killian Tracy say brothers don't do that the fella that was get rid of killing his partner he say uh-oh you're gonna kill me like you did the Egyptian he say who who made you God all of us and they take they begin to reject Moses at that time which caused Moses to leave Egypt and they had to wait 40 years because of rejection I wonder if we've been waiting because of protection look at what the prophets say here water from the rock it says so Moses this great warrior in the time now that God had promised Abraham that in this great long-suffering that somebody the people would search on for 400 years of strength left so when Moses was born he was actually stepping into a vision God gave Abraham the vision gave him the promise Moses was born to fulfill that promise glory amen the people was so drunk for 400 years in a strange land and during this time remember there there was a lapse of time listen right close a minute there was a lapse of time it wasn't exactly 400 years it was 420 years because the condition of the people Moses came in the right time to bring the people out but they rejected the messenger I love this I love this quote I love the thought behind it they rejected the messenger but you know what that's a message that they rejected came right back around for them to receive can I say it like this there's many to think that I rejected the message but that message is coming right back for them to receive oh so I tell you another 40 is a lapse of time which made it run over four hundred and twenty years the same thing it was in an antediluvian world the time was already set in hand but through the long-suffering some of Noah got into that art in them seven days was there that was the long-suffering of God went to somebody all they had to do is come knock on the door they waited too late they waited for the rain to fall before they came but if they just came before the rain for I believe God would open the door the lone suffering amen God's not willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance see the lapse of time in the end of them enter the Libyan destruction see the lapse of time in the delivering of the children Israel so I want you to catch it close down listen now give him a worse treat don't say brother Branham said Jesus should have come but I believe that the coming of the Lord Christ the Lord the coming of Christ is past dude way past due after all the theologians and everything knowing it must be in a certain time I think well after the prophets could set and say it'll be sometime within within that period of time and they missed it the reason that they missed it it's because of the long-suffering of God rather random said in 1977 he says I predict not prophesy 1977 and people say the message is wrong because brother predicting their coming past no no this is not wrong it's the long-suffering of God y'all didn't catch that imma have to say it a different way i'ma have to say it a different way it may look like a prophecy didn't come to pass and the reason it looked like a prophecy didn't come to pass is because of the long-suffering of God i'ma just inject this before I read this quote I read to use some scripture out of first Kings 19 let's go back and just read it because those that have a problem with looking at the message that God sent through his prophet wait umbrella as the weather some things he said came to pass tonight if you have a problem with that then you also shouldn't have a problem with the scripture that I'm reading look at this first Kings 19 verse 15 and the Lord said unto him now who said go return on our way to the wilderness of Damascus now got called into the wilderness right and when thou comest I know it has yelled to be king of Assyria now I need you to understand that that Elijah was told by God to North has yelled to me king of Assyria but when it came time for has he other receivers of Norton Elijah did not he like jump how come this prophet listening I see it's a way that you look at it if you've got an intellectual understanding you're saying this was the Bible's wrong but we got a spirit to understand he see the anointing that was only like Jo carried over to Elijah it takes spiritual revelation to understand I see Scripture not a choice questions with it see I'm just I don't have time to read it all but you can go read it just just take these scriptures and trace them you'll find that has he yell it he can t like shot he likes shut told him I was give it half not only when I launched October said say you know it was it was it was something they like she was there and then a king of Syria I believe at the time sent to your life to say I'm not gonna get over this disease they knew where God was they came here I should say I am I gonna get over the seas and say uh said yeah he don't get over you like to say yeah he doesn't get over they'd like to just start crying and then I believe his name was I think that's what it's name I'll forgive and get all that I but you can get it his name he come he say stay up so why are you crying because I know what you'd be ready to do to the children of Israel how did I do something like that man Emma you say I know what you get ready to do they say God showed me that you're gonna be king of Syria when he first sent in my dog don't do something like that and he'd make it right back to the king of Syria he said What did he say did the prophecy ever get wasted yeah you don't get well the Prophet said you're gonna get with that broth do it to the man but you know what this man did when he found out he was gonna be king he helped God out he actually took a rag and put it on the Kings faithless mother the man to death so he could he could take over the kingdom if you got to get it like that you ain't gonna keep it long but it was Elijah that I'm going to have you not Elijah Elisha is already dead it's another one in there it's another one let's keep reading because if anybody tell you that brother Branham did fulfill at all let's go back to the life of a light can we go here's another and Jehu verse 16 and jehu the son of nimshi shall valinor to be king over israel now who told him to anoint table if you read your mama you realize that he lied jump did not anoint Jingu guess what Eli shut did not anoint Jehu but he like sure had one of the sons of the prophets wonderful one of the boys in school if they take this oil and go down there and North jinwu so see us how we look at things hallelujah amen when I see this message I see Christ and what I also see is the revealed word for my day and I'm just walking in the revealed Word for my day I refuse to reject the revealed Word I malunion all right I'm gonna leave that there y'all go back and read it yourself and you'll see exactly what I just said but I'm saying to this I'm sent to this point because there many people have want to know but brother Branham seemed like some things didn't come and come to pass if you can still believe the Bible after what I've just read then you ought to be able to leave a message praise the Lord because God told you to do two things and they were never done by the Elijah all right now I would say if that throw you if that throw you then though you have to start questioning yourself because Cain was thrown God gave them specific word and it just threw him time to grow these things I have a sincere heart and grunt I will stand on myself when these come to a fruition I am going to give these to the Lord I'm taking in the church I'm gonna dedicate them to the Lord just what I'm gonna do get dipped to the Church of God's I don't want after all the time and effort and energy that put it you know what I don't want it and what would your brother game brother coming up here with a plea deal and look at the way look at the way he's dressed for the church I don't want to dress like that cover the church hey man Casey would do the same thing I don't want to wear a dress going to church I want to wear pants furniture too used to be time they didn't think about wearing no pants in the church sister's a truth in their brothers put on your pants sisters put on your dress a man but here at Kings Island God gave him exactly what the Duke but he rejected the reveal word but his day he thought he killed his brother they did not come down with safe see that's what happened you start you killed you started lying and I mean everything come up right I don't know with you see your brother's blood is crying up to me from the ground you know I kill your brother and all I told you to do and this was all over worship worship the revelation that he had he end up dying for his revelation God came rejected never feel worse now look at this it's rail rejected the word in their day and they rejected not only when Moses was coming to them God in the late time but even when they got to the wilderness they rejected the revealed word for their day now let me I got a couple more quotes that I think I want to read here and then I'll bring this home I tell you I'm not going to get all the way through this I got motive to share but we'll go as far as what want us to go for the day in the wilderness God had given them the opportunity to go into the land see the land that they went for forty days and here they come back with this report and I mean they're carrying evidence from the land on these shoulders coming back into the camp with evidence showing the people that this is a bit like the people saw them grapes never seen grapes that big start plucking them Greeks giving some whatever and it was so big two brothers had to carry a cluster put it on I mean it was dishes them this was some serious bling in so so so here the people not anything enjoying the blessings of the land they see the fruit of the land they're hearing the report of the land but went went off the to the two spots come with a negative report yeah we got evidence but we got this but we got back but yeah brother branham did this but yeah he said that but no we don't want any of that amen judges I mean give us what God promises that's why I say this comes out I'm gonna say it again I don't believe the message just because it was william branham that came on the scene now I'm not probably message just becomes blinking friendly I'm following the message because in scripture I see that God said here we've got city lights of the Prophet before the coming of the dreadful day Lord so I'm gonna get that also seeing scripture revelation team that the mistress of God would be revealed amen by the second angel I see that I can see a man revelation 3:14 in the condition of church as it as a potential innocent I see no say so according to the scripture God private something I believe God from my question isn't from the brand was not the wonderful feel that you need to give me the person that revealed and let me tell you something I told you I am rainbow trout I need to know that I ain't even know that dinner proper told me that you know a rainbow trout is they do not go after signs wonders and miracles y'all didn't get it rainbow trout are not moved that gets their attention but they ain't coming out the water for that you can't catch rainbow trout just for the side 1 the me otherwise I'd be gone from this church to that truck this one for the sign that word is that ain't doing none of that I said praise God they got him to judge the praise God what church what what's the name of your denomination think I praise God because a rainbow no Justin unjust what move rainbow trout word review word get the rainbow trout every time if you ever want to invoke an aid man did you ever need 110 give me the words you're gonna get to a mess the revealed word just give it to now you're gonna get a man for me I must a man what I need alright alright alright this they think they had the opportunity they rejected it and here so here's the problem when they realized they rejected it they tried to make it right by going up the next day oh god we'll go what we sorry are you presuming that you're going up that you're gonna do gonna die and they went chasing them chasing up the mountain they end up down because they went in the wrong time you can't go in your time right you have to go in God's time can I just read this let's try to bring it home here this is our message speak to the rock and it shall give forth its water so then when when they come back they brought this brief bunch of grapes and they all gather before the congregation of the Lord and they brought a report Oh God has told the truth the land is flowing milk and honey it's a good land as the land of seed and it'll it'll grow anything I've been there and I know what the promise that he is exactly right I saw I saw palm trees growing in in the desert I mean like a whole like like a you know I have these these nurseries a nursery date-palms in the desert desert layin it was almost like hi in the word they get that to grow like that but they got some type of way they've done the aeration irrigation system and they have made things grow in the middle of nowhere it didn't look like a land flowing looking honey but they made it that way look at this says the neighbor on the report says a good land it's Atlanta C it'll grow anything oh it's a wonderful place we got plenty of water and rivers and irrigation and everything to make a great nation but oh the amorite and the hittite all the others are there some of them are giants and we we look like little grasshoppers is what you how do you perceive yourself right God see you as a mighty warrior you see yourself as a little grasshopper amen amen and when they begin to say that oh the strength left the children of Israel they begin to cry and the stream so you got to watch what report you give it you know any little negative things will just send some people to downwards that's why some people don't need to watch the news on the news that will just have you in misery all they talked about is death do you know no people have been have gone home from the hospital than actually died in the hospital with this thing more people have recovered the next day they do not talk about their recoveries they only talk about the deaths they don't talk about the miracles amen that's where I got to be so careful which is what your life is feared to get faith in it it says we look like little grasshoppers when they begin to say that oh the strength left it to me vivianne the crime screen they left Egypt and come up and all these things that have taken place but there was two out of the hobo I don't know whole 12 of them there where two had that that had confidence rest of them said we can't do it just we just can't go in further it's impossible for us to meet that kind of people like Kingdom and Joshua said we got more than able to take it why what was it the other ones with the intellectual park was looking at what the Giants look like but Caleb and Joshua was looking at the promise that God had given not all depends on what you're looking at I'm still looking at this word all right this last Pope that will will in here out of where has that strength going Simpson and will stop for the day here but I will come back and finish this a man and do die a man he says oh my in Israel when they got settled down and here's the problem praying when they I set it down when they was on the move all right as long as they on the move is all right it was all right as long as they were moving but when they got to Palestine and got settled down then they begin to want to act like the Philistines and the Gentile world get ahead of myself yeah I'll just I'll say this because this meatman to my next point but I'll just I have to stop it here they begin to want to act like the villas two times in the Gentile world so yes that's when people get a little bit too stuck on yourself god bless them a man you got this you got that you getting spiritually fact now you get settled and when you do that you just dude ever stay in a place where the devil you just kind of anything that you watch it says they want to act like the film stars in the Gentile world they've wanted a king and when they accepted solids at King they deny God as their king and when we accept denominational barriers and handshakes and classical things instead of the Holy Ghost well then we're denying God our kingdom what happened to finally led them to an a half to a total backslide and they failed to recognize their real king when he come and that's the thing the churches have done today they've accepted all this father philosophy and doctrine and psychology and all these different things and instead of receiving the Holy Ghost and now the king is in the mists of the church and they don't know it they rejected it just exactly the way they rejected Jesus their source of church rejected him today why because they accepted an earthly king you're accepting preaches with education instead of man who knows God to Pastor the churches I'd rather have my family go to hear preaching that didn't know his ABCs if he know Christ amen then they have them with all their education they go to school to get that but the church is not in an educational program that mean the church is not competing from an educational perspective for it is for the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost that's what the church needs tonight that's right get away from these things but hold on Delilah first thing you know steps and ought to have made steps Epson oughtn't to have made his first stop when Delilah Firth and her eyes at him he ought to have turned his head and walked on can I just inject this when we go to that their web sites believe it's time now don't believe it's time and all that speak you the truth we go to the websites we're flirting with Delilah Sampson got in trouble for flirting with the latter there you go and now you got to go to a website maybe go sit around people that's actually studying stuff on that website and you sitting in it elicits him you're flirting with the line you keep flirting with him shouldn't get to its secret all right praise the Lord somebody that I don't even entertain man ain't no sense of sending me the link I will not look at it graves alone and you send me some quotes I look at that and actually you know you don't have to answer everybody question you not you not the one to have to defend the message I just believe it I got a defendant God didn't make me the lawyer of the message the Holy Ghost is the lawyer you got questions go to him praise the Lord well can you just answer this okay no can you just leave me alone why you want me to answer it you you go get the answer I'm good I got peace so so you know if you need you go you've got a guy to give it to you the same way you gave it to me did I come to you asking you know I manuscript it for the Bible state policy avoid foolish questions let me run from it don't even sit them try to engage it foolish questions you supposed to get out cuz there's a trick behind that just like Eve did God say not to even that frig not any what he really meant that's what we got rejecting the word let me keep going when Delilah fertilizer him he ought to have never turned his head and walked on e stop just for a moment and she got in trouble Sampson stop for a moment and got in trouble and when the world presents something to the church or individual don't stop Church don't stop keep moving on that's what the church needs to tonight is don't stop of these intellectual classical prize is keep moving on and only those two just keep pressing on going on I encourage you to do that don't don't don't put yourself position where you could end up rejecting the word for your name and each day it was rejected Kanan rejected the children of Israel rejected no one they rejected Moses day they rejected hey man just I did you just mean it day after day after day people have found themselves rejecting God's reveal work we don't want to be in that position today I'm gonna stop there but I'm gonna pick this up a man the next time I come before you trust that up the what we're just kind of curious we can go back and pull out that quote a little bit more than we started out on but I pray this would just help us on our journey amen the Lord bless you let's pray father we're appreciative the Word of God that has been given to us Lord and it's so so precious so precious we look at it it's one thing to read scripture the Lord and just kind of see something in history but oh god help us to apply it for where we are right now that that's that's what's most important if we get this fire on the examples and look at it study all of the examples in Scripture but what people have done Lord we can avoid the same mistakes and the Lord the same errors we can avoid the same outcomes this is why you sent through your prophet that there will be a second Eve that a common she is ordained not to follow that that's who we are we are that second eyes on the words as it has been reveal we're giving you exactly what you have asked for we're not questioning and wondering and Lord just trying to figure out a better way to do these things we're doing what you have access to do so lord help us just to continue to give ourselves to your perfect plan and perfect wheel and then you get glory and honor out of our lives Lord our prayer is even for those that may be consoled by this spirit that's all it is it's a spirit just like a person could be consuming the spirit of lust or a spirit of alcohol or drugs or anything of that nature Lord and they can become sulphide but Lord they can be delivered as well and Lord of Tears one that may be their eyes have kind of gotten off the word and got them just misfits and Turkish and thing he has seen as presented in the wrong picture Tobin they've accepted god I pray that you would open up the eyes of ever understanding that you God as you said in your word you've come to it to recover the sight of the blind there's somebody when they were able to see it once before but God now they can't see it you said you recover this magnifier you say the spirit Lord is upon me and as not to me Lord to bring recovery of sight to the blind Lord let your spirit do it speak to them through dreams and through visions God whatever method or a mode that is needed in order to get them to be settled God there's many of us sitting here in this place today because your SPO Tusker the same man you've given us dreams you've given us business you give us understanding as we read the Word of God Lord I pray you do the same for your people let it be sincere we're coming here for your acts these are let it be so College fight you may hear we love you Jesus we praise you we thank you we've been able to gather Lord some Jesus thing we pray [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but always hold fast [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
