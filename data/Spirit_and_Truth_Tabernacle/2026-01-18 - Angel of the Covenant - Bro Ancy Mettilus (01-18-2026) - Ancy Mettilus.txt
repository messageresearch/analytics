And that's only for the members of the church. Um and uh we'll be looking forward to just sharing uh just information regarding the church um on that at that business meeting. Amen. uh our corporate fast that we usually do once a year. Uh that will start on February 16th and go through March 8th, uh the corporate fast for the church that we usually do once a year. So, uh put that in your your calendar. Amen. And and and I want to just make mention as as we're kind of going to this time of fasting, uh one of the things I want to encourage us to do, and I'm not I don't want to say how we fast. Everybody got different ways in the way that they fast. But one of the things I want to encourage you to do um uh I had given you all a book uh for um uh just a little token of appreciation at Christmas time and um it was the book that brother Solomon had written and I thought it'd be very very good during our time of fasting to take time and digest that book. Amen. And it it certainly fits with the theme that we have this year as far as preparation for a manifestation. And uh with us kind of starting to fast at the beginning of the year, I thought it'd be good kind of go through that. There are some very practical things in that book that just kind of uh help you have a shift in your mindset. Amen. Because in order for you to see manifestation, you're going to have to have a paradigm shift in the way that you think about things. Hallelujah. Right? Because if if you if you think right, you'll speak right. &gt;&gt; If you think wrong, you're going to speak wrong. If you you think I'm broke, you're going to keep saying I'm broke. &gt;&gt; But if you you start thinking, I see I told you in the first sermon, I saw myself as a $50,000 man. I that was years ago. I saw myself as a 50. But now I I'm beyond that now. &gt;&gt; I see higher things. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. So, you got to release things out of your mouth in order for it to be manifested in your life. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Amen. It was. &gt;&gt; My God. My God. I tell you, let me get out the way. Uh but we uh Oh, I forgot. I I got my my daughter and my son-in-law here, too. Uh, brother Aaron and Sister Rebecca. Amen. I I heard her say, "Come on." And I forgot. I forgot she was sitting here. Amen. We thank God. Uh, so so uh, next Sunday we like I said, we got a lot of U ministers coming through and Oh, so next Sunday, Brother Dale Smith uh, is coming to us from Flagstaff, Arizona. He's pastors out there now and uh uh used to live in in South Carolina, but he's passing through on next Sunday and uh we're looking forward to having him. I don't know if y'all remember one time he came and preached a a sermon about the restoration of the dance and he was talking about how the the Indians they took their dance from them and uh and and they knew that if they could just get back to dancing uh victory begin to happen in their midst. So, say once that dance was restored, us and brother brother Dale preached it and started dancing a little. I said, "Hello, somebody." But, uh, but we had a wonderful time. Amen. I think it's my um I don't know what it is. But we'll we'll get through it. Kathy is coming uh on Sunday, February 1st uh from Kentucky area. Uh he'll be with us. Him and his family will be with us. So, we'll be looking forward to that. Uh, so I'm I'm getting a a little little time off. Amen. But I'll pick it up again in February. And uh the other thing that's going to happen in February that that I'm going to do a little different uh brother Keith Brown up in um uh St. Augustine, Florida. He does something every fe February that I just when I first was a partaker of it, I was like, man, this is pretty pretty I like this. So he changed the name of February to Faith. uary and uh and what he does is he have a minister every Sunday come to his church. He don't preach in the month of February on Sunday mornings. He has somebody come to his church and they always take a subject take the subject of faith and uh and they preach, you know, preach that subject. So, you know, I I I couldn't do it on Sunday mornings, but we're taking Wednesday nights in the month of February, and it's going to be different ministers that's going to come forth and preach on the subject of faith. Amen. Praise the Lord. And and I believe I got three of the four ministers lined up. I'm waiting on the fourth minister to get back to me. I sent him a message. Amen. And he has not got back to me yet. So maybe he'll check his message. Amen. But we thank God. We're looking forward to uh February Fuary. Amen. On Wednesday nights. So, Amen.

And I trust that you come to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we believe that God will bless us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand &gt;&gt; as we read a few scriptures. &gt;&gt; Exod Exodus chapter 23. &gt;&gt; Exod Exodus chapter 23 verse 20. can read it. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll go ahead and read it. Exodus 23 verse 20. It says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessings to the word. Let us bow our heads for a word of prayer. &gt;&gt; Blessed heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you allowed us to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you once again that we slept last night and we woke up this morning. We're not at the beach, Lord, cruising or hanging out. &gt;&gt; But Lord, we come this morning in your presence, Lord. Lord, for the purpose to be changed, Lord, to speak to our hearts, Lord, to get a closer stepper until the rapture. &gt;&gt; We ask you, heavenly father, &gt;&gt; take control of our the minister and me and the interpreter, all the beloveds who came this morning who made this service possible. Lord, speak to their hearts. Bless them, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, in the scripture that we just read, &gt;&gt; Lord, the the same way you multiplied bread and fish, &gt;&gt; Lord, you gave many people to eat, Lord, we take this eternal life word that this morning, Lord, that you can give the people the food that you want to give them food. Lord, the same way the disciples on the road of Mayas had said our hearts was burning within us while he was speaking with us. &gt;&gt; Lord, let it be that so this morning. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Uh the subject that we have this morning will speak of the angel of the covenant. We'll read reread that verse again. It says, "Behold, I send an angel before thee &gt;&gt; to keep thee in the way. &gt;&gt; And to bring thee in the place which I have prepared." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the place that I have prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that Jesus Christ has made a promise as well this morning. &gt;&gt; He said that he has gone to make a place for us. &gt;&gt; So that where he is, we will be there also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I put the Joshua back there as well. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning, the the God that you have, that you serve has not lost strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is always alive. He's always powerful. &gt;&gt; And there's nothing that is impossible with him. &gt;&gt; And that's what I come to tell you this morning. When the Lord said, "I will send an angel." &gt;&gt; It is he that came down, &gt;&gt; he's the one that came down. &gt;&gt; Many people outside don't understand. &gt;&gt; John 3:16. &gt;&gt; They think that it is a old man with a long big beard that sends a young man &gt;&gt; to die. No, that that's not the way it's done. me that I'm speaking to you right now. I was in a house. I'm living in Miami. Midnight or so around 1:00 a.m.ish. &gt;&gt; I heard somebody begging on the door. Oh. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, this person can help you pay the rent." I close the door. &gt;&gt; I didn't send Brother Henderson, my son. you know, he's a you know, he's a young man. &gt;&gt; You know, he wasn't married at yet at that time. &gt;&gt; No, I didn't send him to the door. &gt;&gt; I went outside to the door to go see that person. Are you going to help me pay the rent at 1:00 a.m. in the morning? Do you come to disturb my my sleep? My wife is right here. You can ask &gt;&gt; also the same way for the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. God would not send nobody else. &gt;&gt; That God himself came down. &gt;&gt; God himself came down. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 35 said, &gt;&gt; he says, &gt;&gt; that I will come &gt;&gt; I will come. Amen. &gt;&gt; That God will come and deliver his people. &gt;&gt; It is the blood of Calvary that was shed for us at the cross. It's not a blood of a man like prophet. &gt;&gt; It was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; That's why this morning you are precious this morning. This morning you are precious this morning &gt;&gt; the way same way brother Brandon has said &gt;&gt; that when you go to the marketplace &gt;&gt; the money that you give to buy from the the product is more than the money that you brought it with that is why &gt;&gt; that you are very precious of God just as san of Israel are &gt;&gt; that they were precious in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; Let me show you Exodus chapter 4. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 4, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Exodus 3. &gt;&gt; Let us look at C and verse one. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law. the priest of the Median. &gt;&gt; And he led the flock to the backside of the desert, &gt;&gt; and he came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; appeared unto him in a flame. I'm going to show you who's coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. out of the midst of the bush of verse three. And Moses said, I will now turn aside &gt;&gt; and see this great sight. &gt;&gt; Why the bush is not burnt. &gt;&gt; Verse four. And verse two, it says, "The angel of the Lord." &gt;&gt; In verse four, it says, "The Lord." &gt;&gt; So you see who came down. So, do you see who came down? &gt;&gt; God can take any form he wants to. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that is impossible with God this morning. &gt;&gt; He take any form he wants to. &gt;&gt; But the Brandham said in the time of Lot, &gt;&gt; what did God do? &gt;&gt; What did God do? &gt;&gt; He made three statues. And he entered into one &gt;&gt; and he made two other angels. &gt;&gt; Gabrielle, Michael, who knows? &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a theophony. &gt;&gt; God made three different statues. He entered into one and the other two angels went to their own statues as well and they were walking towards Lot &gt;&gt; that it was not just in their theophony. Abraham &gt;&gt; because Abraham called Sarah, &gt;&gt; made food for them &gt;&gt; and they ate. &gt;&gt; You see the God that you serve &gt;&gt; at the cross when he came to save us. &gt;&gt; He came the little blood cell that came into the womb of Mary. &gt;&gt; That there's nothing impossible for God this morning. He can take any form he wants to &gt;&gt; to come and save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant is the Lord. &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Is that so? &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Israel had nothing else to do. &gt;&gt; Just believe. Let's look at Exodus chapter 23. I don't want to tell you nothing else this morning. &gt;&gt; God asks you to believe his word, &gt;&gt; to obey his word. &gt;&gt; That's all God requires this morning. &gt;&gt; Everything else that God will take care of that is only he asks you to believe obey &gt;&gt; and obey &gt;&gt; and submit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Exodus 23 verse 20. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way. &gt;&gt; To keep thee in the way, and he will tell you how and thee into a place which I have prepared. Now, this is an exhortation that God gives. 21. Be beware of him. &gt;&gt; Verse 21. Beware of him &gt;&gt; and obey his voice. &gt;&gt; Provoke him not, &gt;&gt; for he will not pardon your transgressions. &gt;&gt; Listen now carefully. My name is in him, &gt;&gt; an angel. &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning that angels do not forgive sins. &gt;&gt; Angels do not forgive sins. Angels do not forgive sins. That means in the old covenant, &gt;&gt; there wasn't no grace. Once you sinned, &gt;&gt; they made their judgment. &gt;&gt; They destroy you. &gt;&gt; Angel, angels do not forgive sins. &gt;&gt; God in that form of an angel did not forgive sins. &gt;&gt; But you will see later on the angel of the covenant &gt;&gt; because we say he is the Lord. &gt;&gt; That the Lord became Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ became a man. &gt;&gt; Man can forgive sins. &gt;&gt; I want you to capture that this morning because when Jesus took the form of a man, he understands what you go through. &gt;&gt; The word said that he was tempted in all manners. &gt;&gt; He knows your problem. But the angels don't have no human feelings. &gt;&gt; That means the angels just destroy and condemn. &gt;&gt; But God in a form of a man. He understands what you go through. He knows your problems. He knows that your situations. &gt;&gt; That is why he came down. in our time &gt;&gt; to bring us deliverance. &gt;&gt; Listen what he says here. &gt;&gt; First of all, Israel should obey his voice. &gt;&gt; He said, "Do not resist because he would not pardon your transgressions." Many times that you see that people put emphasis on signs. &gt;&gt; Signs are good, &gt;&gt; but what's most important &gt;&gt; is the voice is the voice. &gt;&gt; And if you look and see in the same Exodus chapter 3 that you see, let us turn back. Exodus 3, we'll see that the people believed. &gt;&gt; Let's look at verse 30. I want to make this clear for you this morning. Exodus chapter 4 verse 29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord has spoken &gt;&gt; unto Moses. You see what what happened? &gt;&gt; They uh executed the signs before the people. &gt;&gt; They showed the people signs before them. &gt;&gt; Verse 31. &gt;&gt; Verse 31. &gt;&gt; And the people believed. &gt;&gt; They heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel. The people believed. &gt;&gt; Later on, you will see &gt;&gt; that those same people perished. &gt;&gt; I come to tell you this morning, &gt;&gt; do not stop believing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Don't choose what to believe. &gt;&gt; Believe the entire word of God. The bride must be a word bride. &gt;&gt; So that's why God took us from all the different denominations that we were spread out all over the world. &gt;&gt; But God came down that he made this last exodus that he called us out &gt;&gt; to for us to be his bride &gt;&gt; that are from all traditions. from all cultures that he places in this message. &gt;&gt; You must be sure that you believe every word &gt;&gt; that you'll be realized that when a mighty angel came down that he came met the earthly angel he gave him a little book. &gt;&gt; You will see that John said you must swallow and eat the book. Not just eat and chew. &gt;&gt; When you eat and chew &gt;&gt; that you will taste, &gt;&gt; that you'll spit it out. &gt;&gt; But when you swallow it, &gt;&gt; once it comes from God, &gt;&gt; you must just swallow it, reason with the word. &gt;&gt; That means to say they seen the signs and they believed. &gt;&gt; But when the voice was speaking, &gt;&gt; which was the teaching, &gt;&gt; right? They they re rejected it. &gt;&gt; God didn't cause to just be a Pentecostal church. &gt;&gt; No. No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We believe in signs. &gt;&gt; That is part of the word. &gt;&gt; But the most important &gt;&gt; is the doctrine, the teaching. God sent brother Brandham to to manifest the latter rain that the latter rain that is teaching rain that is to say that as a bride of Christ that we must believe the signs of God but what's most important the signs must follow the voice of God. What's most important &gt;&gt; is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; What did God tell brother Brandham to you? &gt;&gt; That is the key. &gt;&gt; Let us look and see. &gt;&gt; Let's turn back to Exodus uh 23. &gt;&gt; To see what he says verse &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:22. Why? &gt;&gt; If thou shalt indeed obey his voice &gt;&gt; and do all that I speak, &gt;&gt; then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies. &gt;&gt; Adversary adversary &gt;&gt; and an adversary to unto thy adversaries. &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear? &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear it? &gt;&gt; What a great promise. What a great promise &gt;&gt; that I will be an enemy to your enemies &gt;&gt; and I'll be an adversary to unto your adversaries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you have any enemies? &gt;&gt; It's not your brothers your enemy. &gt;&gt; It's not your sisters your enemy. &gt;&gt; All the demons are your enemies. And brother Brandham says William and the greatest enemy is William Brandham yourself. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; That it means to say &gt;&gt; that God want you to obey his word. &gt;&gt; You can't be an unbeliever and manifest the word of God at the same time. &gt;&gt; No. No way. &gt;&gt; What you believe? &gt;&gt; That is what manifests in your life. What do you eat? That's will be expressed. That is why that God took us from all traditions and he brought us the revealed word because once Jesus Christ was a veiled word &gt;&gt; but in a time of Apostle Paul &gt;&gt; it was a time of partial revelation &gt;&gt; in the time of Paul &gt;&gt; in in our time today &gt;&gt; that we have a complete revelation today. &gt;&gt; Revelation makes you serve God even more &gt;&gt; because the the will of God is a mystery. But when you know the will of God, it helps you to serve God better. That's why in our generation today, we have no excuses. The devil is completely exposed that he's naked. &gt;&gt; However, also through the ages, &gt;&gt; God also veiled that God was veiled through the church ages, but now he's unveiled himself completely that he showed himself, he revealed himself unto the bride. Why? &gt;&gt; So you can be just like him. &gt;&gt; But let's go ahead and return back. &gt;&gt; In verse 23, &gt;&gt; for my angel shall go before thee. Now who will lead you? &gt;&gt; Was it Moses? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it No, it was &gt;&gt; it was the angel. &gt;&gt; The angel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God was the angel. &gt;&gt; How can the angel bring me to the enemy's land? &gt;&gt; You see what direction the angel? The angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the Amorites and Hittites and Persites and Canaanites. &gt;&gt; All those were enemies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's not you that is fighting this morning. &gt;&gt; It is God is fighting for you this morning. It's not you fighting this morning. &gt;&gt; It's God that's fighting for you this morning. &gt;&gt; All he asks you to do. &gt;&gt; Obey him. &gt;&gt; That's all he asked. &gt;&gt; All he asks is obey him. &gt;&gt; Why they take a different road with them? &gt;&gt; I want to remind you this morning. that it is the overcomers that will reign with Christ. &gt;&gt; It is the overcomers, &gt;&gt; that people who overcome the enemy, &gt;&gt; overcome giants in their lives, &gt;&gt; those are the people who will reign, the people who go into Canaan land is not for the weak, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cowardism. &gt;&gt; Amen. the people who overcome. &gt;&gt; That is why &gt;&gt; once you believe that you are a beloved of God &gt;&gt; in every situation you find yourself in. &gt;&gt; It is an opportunity for God to show you to that you can overcome. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the problem &gt;&gt; but look at the promise of the word. What does the promise that the word says that I will take you from Egypt and I'll bring you to Canaan land that is mean to say whatever obstacle that I found on my way that God uh reproached them rebuked them. &gt;&gt; He rebuked them. &gt;&gt; Why they got before the Red Sea enmy? &gt;&gt; We have four enemies. First they had the Pharaoh behind them. &gt;&gt; They had the Red Sea before them which was another enemy. On the other side was a mountain. They could have overcome. There's another mountain on on the opposite side. They were before the Red Sea. But God told them they must go through that way. I want to say trust in God. &gt;&gt; He will make a way for you. Where there is no way, &gt;&gt; he will make a way. &gt;&gt; And that way is only for the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh thought that it was their way, too. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, &gt;&gt; no, no, no, no, no. It was only for the children of Israel. They went into the Red Sea. They all drowned. Amen. that way is only for the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Trust in God this morning. &gt;&gt; That's what I come to tell you this morning. &gt;&gt; Trust in God this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 24. &gt;&gt; More exhortations. &gt;&gt; Thou shall not bow down to their gods. He means the god of the Amorites, the god of the do not bow down to those gods. No, nor serve them nor imitate or do their works &gt;&gt; and their conduct and behavior. &gt;&gt; He says, "But you shall utterly overthrow them, &gt;&gt; who will destroy them." &gt;&gt; You before who said who would do that? &gt;&gt; The angel. &gt;&gt; That means to say &gt;&gt; that God is with you. &gt;&gt; So why should you be afraid of? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If God is with you, &gt;&gt; what are you afraid of? What is in us &gt;&gt; is greater what's in the world. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; But let's continue to keep going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you shall utterly overthrow them. &gt;&gt; That is why. God has no other hands but your hands. He has no other mouth but your mouth. &gt;&gt; He came down truly, &gt;&gt; but he needs a body. &gt;&gt; Yes. But the Bible said the Holy Spirit covers the earth. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit is looking for people to obey him. &gt;&gt; People who believe, &gt;&gt; people who obey, &gt;&gt; to serve him. &gt;&gt; He came down truly. &gt;&gt; However, he can't do nothing &gt;&gt; that he needs a body to use. &gt;&gt; Moses must believe the message. But the people also must believe the message to go the same way that you shall utterly destroy them. &gt;&gt; Let's continue verse 25. You shall serve the Lord your God. One thing I remind you this morning &gt;&gt; that Israel had to do &gt;&gt; was just believe. &gt;&gt; What does a person need to be successful in life? &gt;&gt; Just to live in life. Do &gt;&gt; you need food? &gt;&gt; You need water? &gt;&gt; You need security? &gt;&gt; You need clothes? &gt;&gt; Right? God promised he would do all those things. &gt;&gt; Look and see here &gt;&gt; in verse 25. &gt;&gt; He said he he shall bless thy bread. You are making your mind work just to find a way to eat. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. God will take care of you. &gt;&gt; That is mean &gt;&gt; that he will bless your business. &gt;&gt; That he'll make a way for you. &gt;&gt; God is jealous of you. When when God sees that you're making you're trying to make a way to survive, &gt;&gt; that irritates God. God wants you to depend on him &gt;&gt; in everything. God wants you to depend on him on everything &gt;&gt; in every situation. One thing he asks of you, &gt;&gt; believe his word and obey him. You don't have to do three or four jobs. You don't have time to come to church. &gt;&gt; You don't have no time to come to service. You don't have no time to pray. &gt;&gt; All that time you spend in the world, &gt;&gt; you forgot about God. &gt;&gt; The power of God, the power that he has &gt;&gt; to take care of you. &gt;&gt; Food. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the bill the the food bill wasn't on the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; The water bill. go to the city to to pull water from the city. &gt;&gt; It wasn't like that for Israel. &gt;&gt; Are you here this morning, beloveds? &gt;&gt; The light bear wasn't on Israel, God in a pillar of fire that in the night. &gt;&gt; That means to say &gt;&gt; that they saw everything even though there was darkness everywhere else. electricity, &gt;&gt; but they had electricity, &gt;&gt; which was the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; They wasn't paying bills for light bill. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; no way. &gt;&gt; Today that as the times have changed, &gt;&gt; the disposition have changed. &gt;&gt; That means to say, &gt;&gt; you don't have to compromise. &gt;&gt; You don't have to sell your birthight. No, no way. &gt;&gt; God will take care of you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to sell your birthight. &gt;&gt; I will tell you something here. They they weren't going to the mall to shop for looking for clothes. The Bible says the clothes &gt;&gt; the clothes that they wear never was worn out. &gt;&gt; Every day that they wake up, &gt;&gt; the clothes got more newer. &gt;&gt; Every day that they got up, &gt;&gt; the clothes got newer that the clothes got newer every day by day. &gt;&gt; The shoes on their feet &gt;&gt; was never worn out. &gt;&gt; Shopping for shoes. They weren't shopping for shoes. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The Bible said they were never worn out for more than 40 years. &gt;&gt; Their shoes were getting renewed every day. &gt;&gt; That is the God that you serve this morning. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, &gt;&gt; and forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There wasn't no Red Cross or hospital. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 25. &gt;&gt; You shall serve the Lord your God. &gt;&gt; He shall bless thy bread and water &gt;&gt; and will take away sickness. &gt;&gt; Okay. There's nothing that man needs again. Man needs health insurance. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you something here. &gt;&gt; Jesus said &gt;&gt; that when I come, &gt;&gt; will I find faith on earth again? &gt;&gt; Jesus said that when he comes, &gt;&gt; will he find faith on earth again? &gt;&gt; Or do you really trust God this morning? Will he find faith in you this morning? Not find church. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of churches. He find say find schools. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of schools. &gt;&gt; He said if I find science has evolved everywhere. He said will I find faith. &gt;&gt; The just shall live by faith. That was the word saying the just &gt;&gt; not just by the eyes, &gt;&gt; not by science, &gt;&gt; but by faith. &gt;&gt; That is why that God came and rose up a president in this country right now. You know why? You know why? I believe &gt;&gt; is to make the bride to to pick up their step. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; he cut off every social services program? &gt;&gt; You know the reason why to exercise your faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; There's a reason for that. &gt;&gt; It is the entire world. that is affected right now at this moment by the decision that Trump has been making. Reason why &gt;&gt; God is trying to remove the thorns from the eagles so the eagles can fly. Isn't that right? So the just as the bride of Christ &gt;&gt; that we can trust in God completely. Amen. Let us take a pause. Let us look at the mark that I want to show you something. &gt;&gt; You would you cannot be pleasing to God until you experience persecution that if you don't have a squeeze that you won't be uh developed, you won't grow. You won't be able to exercise your faith once you in uh that you everything that you &gt;&gt; that you won't be able to develop your faith. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, show you an example from the Bible &gt;&gt; and I'll show you what I say. Let's go to the book of Mark. There's a reason &gt;&gt; that the social assistance that we get from the government &gt;&gt; that they're being cut off, &gt;&gt; you must depend and know that God can heal. &gt;&gt; How would you be able to manifest the third pool? &gt;&gt; That if you're not squeezed, &gt;&gt; that means to say when you can't see high or low. &gt;&gt; You see how God came down in in the days of children of Israel that they got to the point where they just couldn't do nothing for themselves again children of Israel in Egypt. They were crying out. God said, "I heard their cry. I saw their oppression." Let me show you that verse. Let me check &gt;&gt; in Exodus 3. We were just in verse &gt;&gt; verse 7. &gt;&gt; Exodus 3 verse 7. &gt;&gt; The Lord said, I'll surely seen the afflection of my people &gt;&gt; which are in Egypt, &gt;&gt; and I've heard their cry. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? They were oppressed. &gt;&gt; That they were not comfortable. &gt;&gt; They were not comfortable. &gt;&gt; As long as you're comfortable, &gt;&gt; then you can find all that you need. &gt;&gt; You won't be able to be pleasing or be developed before God. &gt;&gt; You won't be able to exercise your faith. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. and I &gt;&gt; verse eight. And I come down to deliver them &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; There was a woman in the Bible, &gt;&gt; the woman of the blood issue. There's something sometimes we miss to capture. I will give you book of Mark give you &gt;&gt; there's something that she said &gt;&gt; that God want us to completely depend on him Mark chapter 6 no five &gt;&gt; Mark 5 of verse 24 and He's giving you the history that the uh Jarius had a uh daughter who was sick. This woman here, &gt;&gt; her faith &gt;&gt; that just did not came through the area. &gt;&gt; Her faith brought Jesus to the area. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Because she didn't have enough strength to go anywhere else to worship him. &gt;&gt; She didn't have no more strength. The Bible said that all her money, her funds were used to doctors and physicians offices. Now &gt;&gt; she has no money insurance. &gt;&gt; She don't have no health insurance. &gt;&gt; She don't have no health. I mean, she don't got no job. She &gt;&gt; look at verse 26. &gt;&gt; What do you see here? that the doctors took all her money and gave her no solutions. &gt;&gt; Is that what you see here? &gt;&gt; Now you see she has no money and she can't go to the doctor's office but but she need to do something but her faith at that time now she put her faith in action. She she pulled Jesus into the area &gt;&gt; while Jesus was going to go heal somebody else. &gt;&gt; And she said, "If only." &gt;&gt; That was her faith. &gt;&gt; That if only that I can see him and I will touch the hem of his garment that I will be healed. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. What? What happened to know that she had a revelation of that? &gt;&gt; When did that revelation come? &gt;&gt; When she had no other help. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Are you guys here this morning? &gt;&gt; That is why &gt;&gt; we need &gt;&gt; we need persecutions. Brother Brandham said &gt;&gt; persecutions at Pentecost &gt;&gt; that what makes the third P to be active. There was a lot of healing many miracles. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church was being oppressed. &gt;&gt; I will show you that I'll show you. I'll read this quote unto you. in the message returning Jubilee uh November 22nd, 1962 where &gt;&gt; paragraph 25, we need to go back to a power of God. &gt;&gt; Something that can do the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that can do the same thing today. Although in our numbers, &gt;&gt; persecution always gives strength to the church. &gt;&gt; To the church. &gt;&gt; What? What gives strength to the church? &gt;&gt; What gives the church strength? &gt;&gt; Persecution. &gt;&gt; Persecution. &gt;&gt; Persecution. &gt;&gt; It's not being uh comfortable. Relax. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. True. persecution you for persecution gives you a strong assurance of faith &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; I'll show you a biblical example before before we read the quote &gt;&gt; David &gt;&gt; when David was persecuted &gt;&gt; he was very spiritual &gt;&gt; that he was very inspired that he wrote many songs he wrote many songs he was very close to God but when he got to the palace that he got comfortable. That's why he fell &gt;&gt; and also &gt;&gt; he should have went to battle. &gt;&gt; But he said in the palace, &gt;&gt; God didn't call to be in a picnic this morning &gt;&gt; that he called you to be in a battlefield, &gt;&gt; battle against the world, &gt;&gt; battle against sin, systems, &gt;&gt; battle against all these systems. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God called us to be in a battle s when he got to the palace he got too comfortable &gt;&gt; and that is where he fell by the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Persecution always gives strength to the church. &gt;&gt; What gives the church strength? &gt;&gt; Persecution. &gt;&gt; Persecution. We've had it too easy. You see, that's it. We got it too easy. And that way we don't really trust in God anymore &gt;&gt; because we find everything. &gt;&gt; No, it shouldn't be that way. &gt;&gt; We should depend on God, &gt;&gt; trust in him that God can heal without any surgery. Yes, sir. That means when you're sick, &gt;&gt; the first thing that you must do, &gt;&gt; pray to God. &gt;&gt; First thing that you should do when you're sick &gt;&gt; just to go because it's a hospital. &gt;&gt; However, &gt;&gt; that if God tells you &gt;&gt; to go to the hospital, &gt;&gt; you will see that &gt;&gt; that God will enter into the doctor temporarily. that God will operate on you. &gt;&gt; There won't be no medical malpractice. People leaving items in body or or giving you medication that gives you side effects. You pray to God first because God can do miracles. &gt;&gt; But God can heal in different ways. &gt;&gt; There's divine healing. There's miracles. miracles, you know, no medical device to be uh, you know, be to be healed. &gt;&gt; But, however, God can't want you to go to the doctor's office to get a but however, in any way, there is promises in the word of God. He said by his stripes, we are healed. That's why this morning Don't say that. Oh, you have a sickness. &gt;&gt; I heard a radio show on one time broadcast. &gt;&gt; And the doctor said &gt;&gt; who was doing a radio broadcast, a radio show, &gt;&gt; he had a patient of his that said, he said, "How are you with the diabetes this morning?" &gt;&gt; How are you with the diabetes this morning? &gt;&gt; Person said, Me and the &gt;&gt; my diabetes &gt;&gt; diabetes are the best of friends. &gt;&gt; That is a means to say &gt;&gt; that I take my little pills. I do my diet. I do everything here that it don't bother me anymore. Christians don't speak that way. Christians don't speak that way. Sickness this morning that God cannot heal. &gt;&gt; Whether it be cancer What is kidney problems, &gt;&gt; heart problems, what any kind of infirmity God can heal all sicknesses. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; I shouldn't be okay with, oh, I have a sickness. I'm okay with my sickness. No. No way. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You must have faith this morning. But when I say if you don't have faith to be healed, &gt;&gt; how you be have faith to go into the rapture? &gt;&gt; How will you have faith? &gt;&gt; I come to tell you this morning &gt;&gt; that God heals again &gt;&gt; that he saves again and he will deliver again. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. I get it. Thank you. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's look at this quote. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We get sloaf. &gt;&gt; We get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything's just handed to the uh to us. It takes sorrow. &gt;&gt; Listen carefully. It takes sorrow. &gt;&gt; It takes It takes what? &gt;&gt; It takes It takes sorrow and tears &gt;&gt; and sweat &gt;&gt; and prayer &gt;&gt; and faith &gt;&gt; and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what God expects for you this morning. Easy. &gt;&gt; It's not an easy life. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; That we will be raptured. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; That it must be a bride that has faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What kind of faith? &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll repeat again. Perfect faith. I'll show you an example of perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Some people think that they have faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, the 70 disciples said they could have um faith as well. &gt;&gt; That they shake the kingdom of hell. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I Satan coming down as a light. that when they get the report of the missionary trip &gt;&gt; and one time Jesus was preaching a sermon &gt;&gt; Jesus said if you don't forgive your brother 70 times seven how many times in one day &gt;&gt; now the disciples thought they had faith They said, "Lord, we're not ready for that yet." &gt;&gt; They said, "Lord, help our faith. Help our unbelief. Increase our faith. &gt;&gt; Increase our faith." &gt;&gt; That is why. The third, the third pool walks with faith and forgiveness and grace. that if you say to this mountain &gt;&gt; be thou removed but if you don't doubt &gt;&gt; and it continues though &gt;&gt; that he said also as well &gt;&gt; when you pray make sure you have nobody in your heart that means to say &gt;&gt; the third pool is connected directly &gt;&gt; with forgiveness &gt;&gt; amen is connected with forgiveness. That's why brother said that that is perfect love that will get you there. &gt;&gt; People who manifest perfect love. &gt;&gt; I'll even go even farther. &gt;&gt; The Bible says to forgive &gt;&gt; to love your enemies. Even the brother in your own church, you can't even love them and forgive them. &gt;&gt; And you want to forgive your enemies. Huh? You can't forgive your wife &gt;&gt; or your husband. You can't forgive your husband, the people right next to you in church. You can't forgive them. &gt;&gt; And you want to forgive your enemies. &gt;&gt; Come on. Listen. Work on that some more. &gt;&gt; Work on that some more. &gt;&gt; Work on that some more. The disciples realized that forgiveness &gt;&gt; that it was a dimension of rapturing faith &gt;&gt; uh forgiveness is a dimension of faith of of a higher level faith. &gt;&gt; You can have faith to cast out demons to do miracles, &gt;&gt; but you can't forgive. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No way. the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; There's no barrier. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith has no uh obstacle. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Faith has no obstacle. Faith to forgive. &gt;&gt; Faith can to uh cast out demons because love and faith walk together. &gt;&gt; Love brings faith. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? That is why &gt;&gt; that the bride must be a br a forgiving bride. &gt;&gt; Let us go back. &gt;&gt; I'll read this again. It takes sorrow &gt;&gt; and tears &gt;&gt; and sweat &gt;&gt; and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I always say in my home church, &gt;&gt; don't uh make fun of Christians who are crying. when they're going through certain situations, &gt;&gt; Jesus cried al as well. &gt;&gt; Did you guys read that when he got to Gethsemane? &gt;&gt; I think maybe Hebrews 12 that Jesus also cried as well. But as a bride of Christ, we can't cry all the time. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; They just got before the tomb of Lazarus. His friend had died. &gt;&gt; As a human, he cried. &gt;&gt; That is a a human compassion. &gt;&gt; But as he was crying, &gt;&gt; a revelation came unto him. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; That you are God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Speak. He said, &gt;&gt; Lazarus, &gt;&gt; Lazarus, &gt;&gt; come out. You might have times of weakness where you're crying &gt;&gt; that you're sad. &gt;&gt; It's also in your spiritual walk. &gt;&gt; Also, the prophet said here there's sorrow &gt;&gt; and tears and sweat and prayer and faith and all those things. But however, we can't spend all of our time crying. We that we are a revealed people that we know how to approach God. We know there's nothing impossible without God. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. &gt;&gt; That is why I see the time is moving. I'm going to wrap it up some. Give me five to seven more minutes. &gt;&gt; I'll read one more quote. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh gifts and callings are without repentance. &gt;&gt; I forgot. You see, &gt;&gt; listen to what he said. doesn't have the paragraph uh preach uh March &gt;&gt; I think 1950. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It says Moses did nothing. &gt;&gt; It was the angel of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; What did it look like? The red led Israel &gt;&gt; a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day. I believe he's still leading on. We know that was the angel of the covenant. Is that right? It was the logos or the Christ. He's still the same leading the people today as he was then. &gt;&gt; Who did he say was the angel of the covenant? &gt;&gt; Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now that the pillar of fire became a man. You will see Matthew chapter 7 &gt;&gt; that he said that that what the angel said before that he will repeat the same thing all over again. Uh let's go to Matthew chapter 7 &gt;&gt; and we'll uh get ready to close. Matthew 6. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 25. Matthew 6 vers 25. &gt;&gt; Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than meat, and the body than reignment. &gt;&gt; You see what he tells you here? &gt;&gt; He told the same thing to children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Now, because the angel of the covenant is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's here to do the same things. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He's here to do the same things. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 31. &gt;&gt; Therefore, take no thought, saying, "What shall we eat or what shall we drink?" Or what with all shall we be clothed? &gt;&gt; For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things. &gt;&gt; Who who worries about those things? Gentiles. Gentiles are the one that seeks after those things. &gt;&gt; I don't believe if I have my kids that I have to pray to give them food. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Responsibility. It is my responsibility. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That every day that they have accessibility, it's my responsibility to give them food. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But he says also in uh 23 before I read that verse 23 that I'll read this I want you guys to leave with this before I close. Uh uh he says the angel of the covenant which which was Christ the son of God. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. uh the angel of the Lord uh July 18th, 1951, paragraph &gt;&gt; 49 &gt;&gt; 49 &gt;&gt; in the middle he says &gt;&gt; and I believe &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; is leading the church today and it's the same Holy Spirit. Same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember, same Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And anyone knows the angel of the covenant was Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This same angel that I'm speaking of here isn't five feet from me right now. &gt;&gt; That I don't believe when brother Brandham left that the angel also left with him as well. &gt;&gt; The angel is right here &gt;&gt; to take care of you. to deliver you. &gt;&gt; What happened at Pentecost &gt;&gt; in the disposition of of our time? &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and separated itself in multiple peoples &gt;&gt; and it came into the 120. That means to say &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 verse 23 or sorry 33 &gt;&gt; 33. &gt;&gt; This what you look must look for. &gt;&gt; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; What is the kingdom of God? It is the Holy Spirit in you. &gt;&gt; It is the power of God in you. &gt;&gt; The creative power of God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the healing of God in you. Is a comforter of God in you. &gt;&gt; That a brother doesn't call you on the phone. &gt;&gt; That nobody calls you on the phone. &gt;&gt; But you still have a a spiritual booster inside of you. You still have a comforter inside of you. &gt;&gt; You have your songs inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you always are happy. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God, &gt;&gt; it is the angel of the covenant that in our dispensation &gt;&gt; that it works in different individuals. Not the same way it was in Israel where Israel was under the same uh light. But today, &gt;&gt; individually, &gt;&gt; this morning, &gt;&gt; this morning, &gt;&gt; I say look for the Holy Spirit this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It is the kingdom of God. It is the righteousness of God. If you have the Holy Spirit inside of you, you also have the creator inside of you. If you don't have no food, &gt;&gt; what do you do? that when you go to the marketplace that you write, you know, uh uh one day a sister rose up, she had no money, &gt;&gt; you know, she did what she used to do &gt;&gt; and when she go to the marketplace and she made a list and she prayed over the list, before that day was over with what she put on the list that everything came to her. &gt;&gt; That is the God that we serve. Don't sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; God is alive and forever more. &gt;&gt; He is powerful this morning. &gt;&gt; He's also here this morning &gt;&gt; and he's the one that's leading the church. &gt;&gt; You are his church that you must be in security. He owes you all these things &gt;&gt; and every material blessing &gt;&gt; that you need that he will give it to you. The spiritual blessing that you need to go into that place he prepared for you which is the rapture. &gt;&gt; He will give you all those things that you need but you must be using by faith. &gt;&gt; He gives you faith and not just by grace you're saved but the way of faith and he gives you faith first. &gt;&gt; That faith will call virtue. They call patience or temperance until you reach until adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe this morning he's the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and forever more. &gt;&gt; Continue to keep battling. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Resist temptations. Resist against all those things because you are the angel of the covenant which is the Holy Spirit. It is in you this. May God Jesus Christ bless you this morning. May he watch over you. Whatever need that you whatever need that you need, if you're sick, if you don't do like other people do it, but through the preaching of the word that us Gentiles, &gt;&gt; we only people to really lay hands on us, &gt;&gt; we just seize what we need during the preaching. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? this morning. If you're sick this morning, put your hand wherever you're sick at, whatever need that you have. &gt;&gt; Because the word said, "By your confessions, &gt;&gt; that will be your possession. What do you what do you say with your mouth? What you say with your mouth?" What you said with your mouth, &gt;&gt; what you said with your mouth. Someone say, "I am healed this morning." Isn't that right? If you have a need this morning, &gt;&gt; if you need money this morning, say, "Lord, I need money in the name of Jesus Christ. We have light bills. &gt;&gt; I show the angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; He took care of all their bills. &gt;&gt; The angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Whatever you need, &gt;&gt; grab it this morning. &gt;&gt; Receive it this morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, may I richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, let's give the Lord a hand of praise. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need cash. &gt;&gt; Lots of cash. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. My my my my I'm blessed church. &gt;&gt; Absolutely blessed. &gt;&gt; Woo. My God. My God. My God. &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate brother Medalist. Amen. On today just allowing the Lord to use him. &gt;&gt; You know th this this this quote that he brought the first quote that he was reading. Um, I was just, you know, just really processing that one. Uh, it talked about persecution having to it's necessary in order to strengthen &gt;&gt; the the church. Uh, the prophet said persecution always gives strength to the church. &gt;&gt; And it goes on and says, "We've had it too easy. &gt;&gt; We get slothful." Come on. &gt;&gt; This ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; We get slothful. &gt;&gt; We get slow in the way that we serve God, &gt;&gt; right? And and so he says we get to a place where we don't want to move on because everything's just handed to us. And then it goes on to say it takes sorrow. It um it takes tears, &gt;&gt; sweat. &gt;&gt; Come on y'all. This and that's when it's not it's not easy. You know, that was the right quote. But it that's when the thing, you know, you start questioning your experience when you're going through moments like that. Like, Lord, what did I do wrong? You ain't did nothing wrong. This just this just amen. the the growing pains of grace, &gt;&gt; right? And we got to be willing to go through this. And you know, it it says to take the tears and sweat and prayer and faith and and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit. And and I say, Lord, I I mean, I I know that many of us have come through processes like that and uh some might be still in it, but I can tell you if you just remain faithful and obedient to God in times like that, you will see God move on your behalf. He never fails. He never fails. This is all a part of the Christian experience. You know, it reminded me of a sermon that I preached some years ago. Pressure produces power. &gt;&gt; It's only when you go through things like this that that the that the attributes of God can be expressed in and through you. Right? You'll never see God in these ways unless you had some trials. You'll never know him as a healer unless you were sick. &gt;&gt; You never know him as a deliverer unless you were bound. &gt;&gt; Right? You have to you have to be in some situation in order to experience one of the attributes of God. I tell you what, I just I just appreciate it. I am encouraging. And I don't know, I mean, um, you know, often times, like I say, whether you're a Christian or not a Christian, everybody going to have trials. Everybody going to have something they're going through. It don't matter. Uh, people that don't serve God end up in hospital rooms. People that do serve God end up in hospital rooms, right? People that don't serve God end up sick and people that don't serve God need money sometime. I mean, it's I mean, and no matter whether you're serving God or don't serve God, you're gonna have some trials. It's just good to have God on your side when you're going through trials. &gt;&gt; And you also have his promises. &gt;&gt; What was that? Say, I mean, he went went all the way back to Exodus. say, "I'mma I'mma I'mma I'mma I'mma bless your your water. &gt;&gt; I'mma bless your bread." Now, see, you got to you got to watch that because, you know, in in scripture, we understand he would have been talking about their food there. You know, you weren't going to be without food. &gt;&gt; But we live in a society where bread means different things. Hello somebody. &gt;&gt; Bread has a dual meaning in our society. &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. So when I read that, &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the food on my table, but I'm talking about the money in my bank account. I will bless your bread. &gt;&gt; I receive it in Jesus name. I receive it in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; I tell you, as believers, we we have these things we go through, but God gives us promises and and even in the midst of whatever we're facing, he told us to count it all joy. Amen. Count it all joy. Don't don't be discouraged. Don't be downtrodden. God is in control and he's never lost a battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he won't lose yours. Let's give the Lord another hand of praise. Praise God. All right, let us just bow in a in a brief word of prayer. Amen. Father, we uh just thank you for your word, Lord, how you have uh ministered to our hearts today. And thank you for brother Mealis just getting himself out of the way that you could use him to say something to strengthen and encourage this portion of the bride of Christ. Thank you for the saints that have come Lord with him just to be in service his family brother Paul and and and sister Debbie Lord the family Lord we just thank you father for for them being with us. We ask oh God Lord that you would bless us as we leave this place but not your presence. And we ask oh God that you would just help us to meditate on the things that we heard here today that it won't go in one ear and out the other but Lord that we'll really really focus and hone in on what you were trying to speak to us. Not complain about the trials and tribulations but to realize that it takes this type of persecution in order to bring the best out of us. So Lord, we count it all joy and we rejoice in the midst of all that we are enduring. We ask God that you would keep us as we leave uh this place, go our respective ways. Keep us Lord until we're able to return again. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. I forgot to also mention we thank God. It's so good to see Sister Lois. Amen. With us on today. We thank God. Amen. For her. We miss her. We miss her so dearly. Amen. But we thank God for Amen. All right. Y'all ready to go? I know we're going to have to leave, but these musicians got something cranking. Amen. And I figured we just sing a little bit of it. Amen. As we're leaving. All right. It makes no difference what you're going through. You're going to make it. God's going to see you through.
