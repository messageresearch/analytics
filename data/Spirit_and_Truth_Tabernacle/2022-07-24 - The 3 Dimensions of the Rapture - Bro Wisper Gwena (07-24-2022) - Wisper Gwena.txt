heavenly father it's with joy upon our hearts father that we come back again into this house father so grateful for this weekend so grateful father for this father brought us lord father god almighty we want to thank you lord father for everything that is transpired in this place and what lord father a time it has been for each and every one of us we acknowledge your greatness we thank you lord father for visiting us we thank you lord father god almighty for being the principal theme of our fellowship lord as we now come to this last service oh great jehovah we pray that you can just step in yet again father we'll be careful in all to give you the honor the glory and the praise for you are the only one that deserves it father lord we honor you we acknowledge you we worship you we adore you there is none else that is worthy of it lord father you are worthy of a double owner and father we give that to you tonight lord as we come to this spot we just want to surrender all things to you in jesus christ wonderful name amen praise the lord god bless you saints we may be seated amen [Music] how many are grateful to be here how many are grateful to be here amen amen amen praise the lord we've come to the last service it's so strange our time just flies isn't it it looks like we we just about to start and then we have come to the end of the meetings but we thank god for bringing us this far amen we thank god for everything that has happened in this place we thank god especially for the saints from this church let's just give it up for them amen opening the doors allowing us to be here god bless you pastor wesko and god bless you brothers and sisters for everything that you have done amen praise the lord what about the singing amen that's one thing that sets south florida apart it's the type of worship amen we just love it amen and we thank god for it the specials that have been sung we thank god for every one of them and what about mishawaka [Music] for the first time in florida amen that's how they did it in the days of brother branham when he went to that place in mishawaka amen he says they would just pick up some preachers and they would come and they would just preach from anywhere amen that was misha walk and remember that is the time when brother branham went and there was this old man that came and he was just called up and he was called up brother branham said you know i felt sorry for this man and i said how can they call such an old man and he came up there a man the prophet says he had a velvet caller with a cortender round and brother branham says he was just feeling sorry for him and when he took to the pulpit he says he took his scripture out of the book of job where were you when i laid the foundations of the world when the sons of god shouted for joy and brother branham says he never spoke anything about this world every other preacher was talking about what jesus had done but this old man he started from way back tens of thousands of years before the beginning of the world and he said he took him amen and he brought him down the horizontal rainbow and when he brought him down the horizontal rainbow then at a certain point he clicked his heels and he shouted whoopi and he says there is ain't not enough room for me to preach and he went and he sat down that was misawaka glory amen praise god in the eyes amen and what about this morning the testimony of our brother amen we know our brother we've been with him for many many years but after that experience something changed in his life and we are all a witness of it you can't be the same after something like that happens to you something has to change and i trust that you were blessed with the testimony but what it shows us saints what it shows the saints is that this gospel is a reality these things that we are taught are a reality there is a heaven to go to and there is a hell to run away from whatever you do don't miss that place and that is why we are here it is because that has been revealed to us and when something like that happens to somebody that you know you can indeed testify and say this has touched my heart because it means so much to me as well we appreciate that testimony now coming to the last service i was just wondering so what am i going to bring to the church amen normally many times when i come to preach i've preached quite a lot of last services on many meetings and most of the time it's it's really just evangelical and we just approach the gospel from that perspective but tonight god has laid it on my heart to look at it a little differently and this is really coming from the testimony of the morning and the lord has just laid it upon my heart that we can just approach the message from a different perspective maybe looking at something that complements what went in the morning so my sermon tonight amen god giving us grace i'll be looking at things that are to be i'll be looking at where we are going to be i'll be looking at the rapture of the bride amen that's what i want to speak about and i trust that that is going to be a blessing to somebody a little teaching type of a message amen but i'm not that much of a teacher i don't have teaching manners amen shall we stand to our feet praise god how many love the word are you tired wonderful in the book of acts chapter 1 the bible says and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye man of galilee why stand the gazing up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manna as you have seen him go into heaven first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 and 17 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord and then first corinthians chapter 15 51 and 52 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed we may be seated as we bow our heads yet again father we thank you for the reading of your word we come yet again lord father to this scary part that no human being can handle how can we handle you because the word we learn is you it takes you and you alone therefore father lord god almighty we commit the ministration of the word back to you and we ask you father that you can have your own way lord we are only your children unable feeble lord but thou art strong thou are able and father lord god almighty we therefore come to you the able one and we say in the name of the lord jesus christ father please do what you do best which is to show us your ways father you said your ways are not our ways but lord we desire to leave our ways to come into your ways speak to our hearts tonight in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord for a title tonight i want to speak on the three dimensions of the rapture [Music] that's rather a very strange title and maybe let me also say maybe a confusing title but i trust that it will make sense by the time we come to the end of the service now let me say when i say three dimensions of the rapture i'm not talking about the dimensions in the realm of the dimensions as in the seventh dimensions that the prophet teaches us of i'm talking about the dimensions here as in realms as in stages but each being a different perspective a different dimension now what is the dimension a dimension is the way you see things it is the outlook at your given vantage point that's the definition of a dimension it is the way you look given the vantage point that you'll be in three dimensions is because we are in these three dimensions and we are limited to these three dimensions that's how we see things seventh dimension amen it is the highest and it sees everything the prophet says these are separated by speed but i'm not talking about that i'm just talking about the way that you look at things in different stages amen now let me also start by telling you how this inspiration came to me i have a good friend of mine a pastor friend his name is brother lincoln he's in charlotte and we we exchanged so much in terms of doctrine he's a man that just loves to study the word and he's always firing questions at me and you know asking what about this and what about that and over the years we have dealt with so many different aspects of the message so one day he sends me a question and this is how this message came about by god's grace i want to talk about the three dimensions of the rapture as i said it sounds a bit strange but i trust that you get where i'm coming from now let me just start by saying the rapture is the greatest expectation that the bride has in this hour how many agree with me it is the highlight of this age it is what sets this edge apart this is the only age in which there is going to be a rapture to think about it sayings that there is gonna be a people that shall exit this earth not by the way of death but in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed oh what a promise that is and what an expectation that ought to give to the believers in this day and in this hour and the reason why i'm in the message it is because the message gives me the greatest preparation for that rapture coming i'm in the message because the rapture promise is in the message my prophet tells me oh that we need for the rapture it lies in them tips and in them books oh that we need to be prepared for the rapture a preparatory message stored up food with rupturing vitamins it lies in them tips and books allow me to just remove my jacket praise the lord amen hallelujah and let me say right here saints that when we talk about the rapture the rapture is not just for the living but the rapture is also for those that are asleep in christ is that right in fact those that are asleep amen they take priority somebody came to brother branham and he said you know i'm so worried about the rapture brother branham i want so much to be in the rapture but i don't know whether i'll be alive at the time of the rapture and brother branham being the sober prophet that he is he tend to this person and he says hey don't worry about whether you are alive or you are gone because the rapture is not just for the living even if you are gone the rapture is gonna be for you as well so i'm not talking about something that will be just for those that will be our life i'm talking about something for everyone that has been in christ praise god in the eyes now let me get to first thessalonians chapter four now many times when we speak of thessalonians chapter four our focus most of the time it is actually on verse number 16 which is the scripture that talks about the rapture the rapture process in that scripture is described by the shout the voice of the archangel and the trump of god take me to the next one for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first so right there we find the rapture process and many times when we look at the scripture we are looking at it amen from the perspective of verse number 16 and little do we ever put emphasis on verse number 17 and the reason for your church is this vest number 16 is very fundamental to the message why because the scripture in verse number 16 amen we find the seventh seal in there the seventh seal is the coming of the lord is that right and first thessalonians chapter 4 16 is the coming of the lord is that right now if the servant see you is the coming of the lord and first thessalonians 4 16 is the coming of the lord then it follows that we must be able to place the seventh seal into first thessalonians 4. oh place first thessalonians 4 into the seventh seal but i'm not talking about that tonight amen hallelujah but because of those things amen we always find a great attraction to speak on verse number 16 and hardly do we ever look at verse number 17 and many of the times when we look amen we read the scriptures coming to verse 17 we just read it in passing but today by god's grace we want to focus on verse number 17 the prophet comments about this scripture and the prophet in commenting about this scripture he says in the messenger of ajiri and then remember if we go before he comes we will be up and in his presence or raised before the others are changed the trumpet of the lord shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air now the prophet in that statement he's mixing first thessalonians chapter 4 and he's also bringing in the element of first corinthians chapter 15 which is the other scripture that i read but it's all talking of the same thing but then watch the prophet then says look at the order of the resurrection in other words in there we see the order of the resurrection he goes on and he says so god knows that we long to see our loved ones and if we go there to meet him first we'll be looking around to see if mother or dead and the rest of them was there but see how the holy spirit in his wisdom we meet one another first [Applause] and then when we get there and sing amazing grace that's when they are going to be a time of worship you think i act funny now watch me up there it's going to be a wonderful time for me and all of us when we get there [Applause] but the prophet says look at the order of it see the holy spirit in his wisdom we meet one another first that's the order of the resurrection now that looks simple and that looks like we all understand it is that right but when you begin to look at that a little deeper then you begin to realize it's deeper than you thought and this is where this brother's question was and he asked me so what exactly then is the order of the rapture if we meet one another first now we know that there's gonna be that period of about 40 days in which the dead shall rise first amen and they will appear unto us but in this this is not the meeting of one another that the prophet is talking about why do i say that this is not the meaning of one another that the prophet is talking about because he says in this message i said well it says in ii thessalonians the fifth chapter and we know he actually means first thessalonians the fourth chapter and the prophet says in another place and make them type of mistakes so many times amen that's a direct court and if you're gonna hold the prophet to say that he said ii thessalonians chapter five when he met first thessalonians chapter four therefore i will take it to the second thessalonians chapter five it means you just don't understand [Applause] glory to god so he said it said we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent that means hinder those that are resting asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound and those who are asleep or resting shall wake up first to take on immortality then we wish our life at that day at that time after they have done raised up then we shall be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye and meet with them now i want you to follow saints he says then we which are alive at that day that time after they have done raised up so those have risen up and then the next thing that happens then we shall be changed then we are also changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and we meet with them in other words that meeting it is coming after our body change then we go to meet the lord in the air be caught up together with them so this is not a meeting that is happening before the body change [Music] glory so the question is getting deeper so what then is the exact order of the rapture preacher man and by god's grace i want to look at that now god in his wisdom and in his grace he played this out for us and he gave us a clue of what this is all about we find that now in the book of acts 9 of chapter 1 starting from verse 9. the bible says and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and the cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said he men of galilee wise and he gazing up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manna as you have seen him go into heaven right here the bible gives us a clue on the order of his second coming and where is that clue preacher man he says he shall so come in like manna in other words what he has done here he shall repeat why jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever malachi 3 6 i am the lord and i change not so if god has done something he will be obligated to do it again and the prophet of god says god is infinite he cannot change man changes times changes kingdoms changes worlds changes churches changes but christ remains the same yesterday today and forever and can never change he's just like he was at the beginning so the unchanging god hallelujah working in an unchangeable way at the time hallelujah of his coming he's going to repeat what he has done amen and x tells us in like manner he shall return but i want to say looking at that like manner that like men are amen the way he went it did not start in acts chapter one it actually starts from matthew chapter 27 because in matthew 27 we then read and behold the veil of the temple was random twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quirk and the rocks ran and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now this was the order of his first ascension what happened at that time amen the grace opened and the saints of old that slept they arose amen after that he had resurrected and they went into the city and they appeared unto many now in like manner he shall return so in like manna what shall happen it is coming the dirt shall rise first hallelujah and paul picks that up and he says in thessalonians the dirt shall rise first because it's got to be in like manner as it was in matthew chapter 27 that's exactly the same way that it will repeat again now for how long are these going to appear the bible tells me in the book of acts to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god so we know at the time amen when christ resurrected he was showing himself to his disciples for a period of 40 days and in that period of 40 days something else was happening the likes of abraham and sarah were taking a stroll in the streets of jerusalem not only was it abraham and sarah but the prophets of ode the likes of ezekiel isaiah elijah jeremiah amen you name the saints of old they were also walking in the streets of jerusalem appearing and disappearing in the same period and the prophet dramatizes this and he says i can see abraham grabbed sarah by the arm and here they come right out in matthew 27 when he came out i can hear them make a little stop around jerusalem there and the first thing you know i can see caiaphas and them standing on the streets saying they tell me that guy rules say who is that guy going there that young fellow and that young girl not old no more that was abraham and sarah and they vanished they looked somebody's watching us they could vanish just like he went through the wall the same kind of body hallelujah right so abraham and sarah young now amen walking in the streets of jerusalem here requested lord can i just take a stroll through that city because i said i'm a pilgrim and i'm a stranger i'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is god and god granted father abraham the ability and the time to walk through the streets of jerusalem amen as the foretest of that real city that he was looking for and the prophet says he is all the prophets and them walking around looking around the city so it wasn't just for the abraham it was all the prophets they arose at the same time with the lord jesus christ and they appeared unto many for a period of about 40 days so the order of the resurrection is going to be the dead will rise first then they appear to us for a period of about 40 days is that right because in like manner he shall return amen so i believe according to the teaching of the prophet and according to the teaching of the bible that when that hour comes amen those saints that have gone on to be with the lord they will rise first and i believe the reason why god allows them to rise first is because god has ordained them to become the final preachers to bring the final message with a rapturing faith how do you mean it preacher man hallelujah they are not coming i believe to preach a ceremony as i'm preaching a seminar i believe like they are appearing it is a ceremony in his own right because to us who are taught to ask that no praise be to god brother when you see them appearing you can almost tell in 40 days from now in less than 40 days i'm gonna get my own body change i don't need anyone to preach to me just seeing a saint that has gone on to be with the lord think about it saints we are sitting in church as we are sitting now and then on your side you look and you see say hey who is this and then you begin to realize actually it's brother so-and-so who went to be with the lord some 20 years ago and the moment you recognize it then it disappears through the wall brother think about it what that would do to your gastronomics your spiritual gastronomics it will blow out every fuse hallelujah inside of your fibers it will pump you with a true rupturing faith brother i say to the church one day that on that day when i see a sudden brother sitting in the church and i recognize him i said on that day if you want my car you can take it because i won't be going home with it and it's not that we'll be going into the rapture i will still be going home but i will not go home in my car because by that time i'll have such a faith that i walk home like the speed of a thought just like philip my faith will be boosted oh glory to god at that time all things will become possible not that they are not now all things are possible now but our faith has not climbed to that level but rather when that begins to happen glory to god in the highest amen what a faith boost that would be and god has allocated 40 days according to the like-manner pattern to give us the rupturing boosting faith and god achieves that in 40 days and god knows praise be to god that in 40 days i'm more than able to even convert that message believer that does not have faith 40 days is enough oh and i love this 40 days it is enough for god amen to give a person a rapturing faith that in 40 days amen witnessing that things can change oh i can tell you right now saints of the living god that 40 days is enough for you to see a visible change even in your own circumstances you might be in church right now and you might be wondering what am i gonna get and how am i gonna get it let me tell you it has already happened but you're just waiting for the manifestation but i'm saying 40 days is enough for the manifestation to begin to soar [Applause] a mother can conceive like today and she will not know about it but give you 40 days within 40 days diets will begin to change appetites will begin to change there will be some morning sicknesses here and there there will be this and that beginning to happen that begins to tell you that what happened without you not knowing it this is the manifestation of it oh let me speak to somebody right here to say what has happened this weekend you might not know that it is actually taking place but i'm here to announce that something has changed in the spiritual realm or do i have a believer here start counting from tonight and count your 40 days and see whether god is a liar yet 40 days and there's gonna be a visible change something must take place who believes it oh i believe in the power of the ministration of the word that when the word is spoken the word hallelujah is god's thoughts for our day oh i believe saints of the living god that 40 days is enough for anything and god knows about it when he sent jonah to nineveh jonah was sent with the message yet 40 days why just 40 days god knew that in 40 days he could convert a serious city that was destined to the peace of perdition hallelujah they could end up believing and jonah got there and he started preaching yet 40 days and within that period ninifa believed and when nineveh believed god spared nineveh let me tell you tonight if you believe god is gonna spare your life if you believe god is gonna grant to you your heart's desire if you believe there's gonna be a change if you believe there's gonna be hallelujah something takes place in your own home who says yes i believe yes i believe or start counting tonight yet 40 days brother sister and a visible change a visible transformation or i don't know who has the faith i don't know who he's saying you are talking to me i've been waiting for this thing for a little while i'm here to announce it is just about to happen glory to god hey amen praise god in the highest hallelujah hallelujah yes yes you can declare watch me in the next coming 40 days yes yes you can begin to declare oh old man devil i'm declaring it tonight watch me hallelujah my manifestation will begin to show yes yes somebody believe a belief [Applause] let me come back to my subjects [Applause] these that rules in matthew 27 they appeared unto many for 40 days but i want you to watch things they were not appearing to those whose bodies had been changed and in like manner he shall return so in other words in these 40 days we have not yet had a body change are you with me and the prophet of god says then we which are alive at that day at that time after they have done raised up see then we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and meet with them so they are raised first they appear for 40 days and then in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed to go meet with them and then go up to meet the lord in the air be caught up together with them a different type of a meeting he says here but that won't hurt the rapture now see no they come first then them a privilege that's gone on they come first see see we which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord will not hinder or prevent those that are asleep the trumpet of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise first then when our eyes behold our loved ones then we will be changed glory in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and with them shall be caught up together our eyes behold them and when our eyes behold them it gives us a rapturing faith and when it gives us a rapture in faith then we shall be changed and then after we are changed then we shall be caught up together with them the ones that goes first are privileged above those that are leaving so the body change happens first before we go to the meeting days they are appearing which gives us the faith to have the body change but after that when we have had a body change then there is a meeting are you following me saying he says we don't meet him first we meet one another first the order of the resurrection the bible said ephesians the fifth chapter we know he says he means first thessalonians 4. glory to god it said for we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord down here shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep them precious ones that seal their blood sealed their testimony with their blood not prevent or hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet shall sound something will take place the gospel something will sound the announcing of his coming and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive remains shall be changed then the prophet says standing in philly change come on you the gray hair go out the wrinkles fall away be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye oh church of the living god what an expectation this is that when you are sitting there when you are standing there then you start to feel a change come inside of you and the gray hairs disappearing the wrinkles disappearing you changing to a young man in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what an expectation that is oh church of the living god that ought to incentivize everybody to live a christian life to say whatever i do i can't miss that opportunity to be able to be a part of it to be able to witness a body change that is coming into my fibers but watch he carries on and he says and we shall meet our loved ones first today's mama there is papa there is my body oh hallelujah we are ready and then together with them that were dead says the scripture we will be caught up in the air to meet the lord the order of the coming look at the older sayings there is a change of body and after there is a change of body then we go to meet one another we meet one another first and we shall meet our loved ones first there is mama there is papa there is my body amen hallelujah glory to god in the highest and this is not happening in the air all right and the question then comes so where is it happening why is it happening in the message the ten virgins the prophet of god says oh to see that old daddy of mine oh my see them old loved ones that went down in the faith you wanted to meet them see the sweetness of god knowing if we met him first we would wonder was mama in it did mama finally make it we have preached so hard and we tried was she here so his uncle joe here is the brother here he saw and so lord we love you we love you but first we are going to meet one another no wondering about it when we are all there what the prophet of god is saying here is the sweetness of god he knows if we would go to meet him he will become the principal team of our focus he will become the principal theme of our worship we supposed to just focus on one and him and him alone we shouldn't be wondering at that time did mama make it did my daughter make it did my son make it so god gives us an opportunity that we can meet first before we go to meet him and do a roll call somewhere oh did mama make it oh did my body make it did my sister make it and when we have accounted for everyone glory to god in the highest when we have accounted for everyone then we go to meet him in the air whoa glory to god in the eyes so there's going to be a meeting hallelujah and in this meeting that is where we are going to take stock of one another stocktek glory to god in the eyes but watch how are we going to know one another in that meeting oh i just love this prophet how are we going to know who is who in this meeting the prophet of god says he that was lost will be first and he that was first will be lost that's accounts right first in first out how many have done accounts all right is that right correct praise the lord he that was last to be first and he that was first will be lost how can he be that way stoktec that's the order of the resurrection i won't know nobody in the generation before me or the generation after me i will know those in the generation of this and every generation will come successfully right as it went down they which were last will be first sure it has to be i will know my people the next fellow my dad will know his people his grandfather his people on down like that or do you get what the prophet is saying what the prophet is saying is when we get to that meeting we gotta have some introductions but we don't know who is who but i know the people in my generation because i saw them growing up i know what they were like when they were about 19 20 21 when they appear i'll know who they are but those that went before us they will know their generation and that generation that went before it will know its generation and it will carry on the prophet says wave after wave after wave after wave and the saints are rising from everywhere won't that be wonderful oh that makes the old people feel young again oh come on saints of the living god when you start to think about that that boosts your fibers hallelujah [Applause] will be some introductions this generation will know the next generation and that generation will know the next generation and that generation who know the next generation until finally we will be introduced this is brother paul because if you go to meet brother paul you will not know brother paul you will not know saint peter the pictures that we may be seeing on the internet that this is saying peter after all they are of old people he won't be that old he will be a young man about 2021 i need somebody that lived in his generation to be able to introduce me and that's what the prophet is saying here that this generation will know that generation and that generation will know their generation until finally this is irenaeus this is saint martin and you have a picture with him with the ring and you're looking for that ring on the picture that's not what you would be like this is saying marin this is columba that edge messenger this is john wesley oh glory to god oh glory to god give god some praise somebody and the prophet of god says that ought to make an old man hallelujah get shouting get to feel excited glory oh church of the living god when i think about that meeting i can almost say even so come lord jesus it makes us want to leave this earth to say let that rapture come let that day amen now come for the church to go for that meeting that will be in the air now the question that is their saints is but we are changed first and where are we going to meet when we are changed where exactly are we going to be are we going to be walking on this earth oh in what realm are we going to be and this is really what brought the brother lincoln and he wanted to find out so this meeting where is it going to be because when you read the quotations it is very clear that this is not the appearing of saints before our body change this is a meeting that is coming after our body change and where is this meeting going to be and when you go to reading the message the prophet the way he puts it the prophet of god says the bible said we shall meet one another first now if the prophet did not say the scripture said i would not have been bothered because i would say he's a prophet of god if he says we meet one another first that's enough for me i will take it as his at his word but that's not what the prophet said the prophet said the scripture says and i wondered where does the scripture say we shall meet one another first where do we find it in the bible and the prophet said first thessalonians chapter 4 says we shall meet one another first before we go to meet the lord and i kept on wondering and i say to myself but if the prophet says the scripture it has got to be in the scripture but i was looking for it in the scripture and i couldn't find where we meet one another first then one morning in the early hours of the morning i times just wake up to go and pray and i remember very well it was on a thursday in the early hours of the morning everyone is asleep and i like to go and pray at that time and i went down amen into my study and i was just gonna start to pray and then i thought let me just start by reading the scripture and when i went to my bible to start reading the scripture i was just going to pick another verse but immediately it went straight to first thessalonians i did not choose first thessalonians but i just found myself right on first thessalonians god reaching mercy he knew i'd been worried and bothered about this and he wanted to show me the revelation that was lying right in front of me so i said well let me start by reading this and then i'll go to something else that i want to go to before i pray and when i started to read first thessalonians chapter 4 there was my answer and i said lord i've read this scripture so many times and i've never seen it are you ready for a church we sure had a prophet and i never cease to get amazed at the depth of this prophet how did he conclude that we are going to have a meeting first with our loved ones before we go to meet the lord in the air how did he conclude it are you ready for a church and that brings me now to the three dimensions of the rapture or somebody says just tell me what it is preacher man i'm zooming in now onto first thessalonians 4 that verse number 17 that i said we don't take real look at we just passed through the verse are you ready for a church look at first thessalonians chapter 4 chapter 4 it says and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them in the to meet the lord in thee and so shall we ever be with paul gives us three distinct places and the bible does not play with words so the first thing that happens we will be caught up together with them in the clouds so the first meeting it does not happen in the air the first meeting it happens in the clouds and then after the clouds then we go to meet the lord we're in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord now i give you to understand the clouds and the air are not the same place these are different dimensions if he wanted to say he would have said we will be caught up together with them in the air to meet the lord in the air but the bible does not read like that the bible said we will be caught up together with them we're in the clouds and then after the clouds into the air and then after the air into where the lord is [Applause] and those are the three dimensions of the rapture praise be to god in the highest so the first dimension of the rapture amen it is in the clouds we shall be caught up together with them in that realm of the cloud hallelujah and when we go there that is where the first meeting is going to be praise be to god now where is this level of this cloud in what dimension is this we shall be caught up together with them that are asleep who would have resurrected at that time in this church these are six dimension beings is that right because they are in the sixth dimension right now and i give you to understand that god is not going to demote them to come to the three dimensions glory to god hallelujah in another quotation the prophet of god says imagine you were once a pig and then god changes you to become a human being you would never want to go to become a pig again and the prophet is talking about when you have died and when you have gone beyond amen and then somebody says you want to come back you want to experience humanity again then the prophet of god says it's like comparing a pig life with human life now these have been living in the sixth dimension these they know what it is like in the sixth dimension there is no way that god is gonna demote them to come back to the three dimensions so what happens we are to be caught up to get to their level they can come down all glory i'm reminded of nehemiah nehemiah and gosham they sent unto him a message one time and they said come down so that we can deal with this and nehemiah send the word back and he says i'm doing a great work and i can't come down and i can hear the saints in the sixth dimension want to pull me back onto three i can't come down and god says i would rather raise them that are in the three dimensions and take them to the same level that these ayat so we shall be caught up together with them and where are we going to be caught up together with them in the clouds and watch sayings how scriptural paul poets and it brings me back to acts chapter one because in like manner things must repeat and in acts chapter 1 verse 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and the cloud received him what is the mystery of this cloud glory to god verse 11 which also said he men of galilee why standing gazing up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manna it shall repeat a cloud received him what was this cloud that received him i give you to understand that this cloud was the cloud of witnesses it was the cloud of the old testament saints it was the cloud of them that had resurrected them that were walking because the bible does not tell us when they ascended can i bring some scripture to it hebrews chapter 11 paul begins to tell us of another cloud and he says in hebrews 11 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and then hebrews 12 1 we're foreseeing we are also compassed about we so great a cloud of witnesses what was that cloud of witnesses it was the cloud that paul had been talking about in the book of hebrews chapter 11 and that cloud of witnesses he starts with it with abel the one we looked at yesterday he moved from abel he gets to enoch he moves from enoch he gets to know he moves from nowhere he gets to abraham he moves from abraham he gets to sarah he moves from sarah or praise be to god he gets to a joseph from a joseph he gets to a moses from a moses praise be to god then we get to the rap oh god read libraries 11 if you think i'm wrong [Applause] praise god in the highest and then after here's gone hallelujah then he comes on praise be to god and he says amen time fails us to speak of gideon to speak of baraka to speak of simon to speak of jephthah to speak of david to speak of somehow these are the cloud of witness [Applause] and that very same cloud of weakness it was representing hallelujah them that resurrected when christ rose in matthew chapter 27. in that very same cloud it is the same cloud that we now find in acts chapter number one and in acts chapter one amen and a cloud received him what was the cloud it was the cloud of weaknesses it was the old testament saints that we're now going together with him and the prophet of god gives us this same people in psalms chapter 24 when he begins to talk of psalms 24 he says when christ was now ascending the prophet says then the scripture says lift up your heads oh ye gates and be lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the question comes from the insider and then from the outside of the gate the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your head or your case even lift up the even lift them up the everlasting dose and the king of glory shall come in and the prophet of god says these were the saints of the old testament who went up with the lord as he was going back up after his ascension they are the ones that screamed or lift up e gates the everlasting case that cloud glory oh god that cloud that ascended with him it is the very same cloud hallelujah a man of the saints that are shouting these words [Applause] so we shall meet up together with them in the clouds seeing we are campers about with such a great cloud of weaknesses and i give you to understand that cloud did not stop with the old testament saints that one went with them but after that the dead in christ have been accumulating they without us cannot be made perfect where are they now they are a cloud of witnesses and they are the very same people that shall return onto earth in the 40 days to pick up their glorified bodies and then after the 40 days these are the ones we shall be caught up together with them in the clouds we shall be promoted glory to step into the cloud of witnesses to become a parent parcel of them and when we step into that praise be regarded that is where we are going to be asking his mama made it this papa made it is my body made it is my daughter made it you are checking everyone and if god gives you enough time to check whether everyone has made it how long a time is going to be i don't know but the prophet says we are going to be given a time to check if our loved ones have made it and after we are satisfied that they have made it after we have reconciled after everything is done then we go to the next stage the next dimension of the rapture which is a meeting in the air can i bring you to scripture oh i love the prophet one of these days we will stand out yonder we will stand out beyond the earth beyond the ring of the earth out yonder somewhere in space and we won't be in heaven yet we will be caught up to meet him in the air we won't be in heaven yet remember it was in the evening time and rebecca writing on the camel eliazer said there he comes now so we are given an example of this meeting in the air and the prophet says and rebecca jumped off the camel pulled the veil from her face she had never seen him didn't know that was her husband but she had never seen him she was going to meet him by faith i don't know what he looks like but oh when i see him out there when she seen him it was love at the first sight and he had never seen her so he seen her laugh at the first time and here they come to meet one another in the fields and he took her in to be into he in to be his father's kingdom over there and marry there so the meeting in the air is given a type amen in rebecca meeting isaac or gloria or god in the ten virgins the prophet says that's the way the church will be caught up in the air in the middle of the air and meet the lord on his road down oh what in a faith will be love at the first sight and when we stand there upon the rings of the earth and rising them and seeing them songs of redemption oh my how will sing and praise him for the redeeming grace that he has given us when angels will cover the size the circles of the earth with bowed heads not knowing what we are talking about them angels wasn't lost they won't know what it means to be saved we was the ones who was lost we were the one we will understand then what a horrible thing laid ahead of us and he redeemed us by his blood out of every crindle tongue and nation what a day of rejoicing that would be oh i'm looking forward to that day when angels cannot join in the song that we will begin to sing and where is that happening saints we will meet our lord fest thessalonians in the air and this is not yet in heaven the prophet says praise be to god hallelujah and then after that that is when now he will take us praise be to god to that marriage supper so it's a meeting that happens in the air where did isaac meet rebecca he met rebecca in the field it was not in his father's kingdom he took off from his father king's father's kingdom and he stepped into the field when he was in the field that's when rebecca looked and he says to eliasa who is that that is coming under and elias has said that is my seventh that is my master son and immediately she failed a face and the meeting happened in the field can you say amen it did not happen in the father's kingdom and eliasa was the one that then said behold your husband and i believe it is at that meeting in the air that is when malachi falls shall say to the bride behold your husband [Applause] o glory to god in the highest he will introduce us as the eleazar of our day and he will say behold your husband at the meeting in the air praise god in the highest amen so we have moved from the clouds and we get to the air and then after the meeting in the air then he takes us to the father's kingdom give the lord a hand of praise there is your dimensions of the rapture [Applause] there is the cloud dimension there is the air dimension and then there is the kingdom's father's place dimension those are your three dimensions church of the living god we are a blessed people let me say to you you might not have money in your pocket but you are blessed because those that have money they don't have this privilege you might not have the house that you want to have but you are blessed you might not own a mansion but you are blessed you might not the daughter you might not be the daughter of a donald trump but you are blessed you might not live in the white house but you are blessed you might not be the daughter of the queen of england but you are blessed oh count your blessings begin to name them one by one what god has in store for you it is far greater than you can ever imagine can you say amen brother sister to know that there is a rapture that is coming there is a meeting in the cloud that is destined for me and there is a meeting in the air that ought to make everyone walk with their chest out and say yes i'm a son of a king i'm a daughter of a king this world is not my arm i'm just a passing through i have a land that is up beyond that i have a place that god is destined for me so let me tell you church if this life has dealt you a thorough blow until you don't want any of it there is a better place that is waiting for you and that is what gives us great comfort until paul says wherefore comfort one another with these words there is another better place better than here where we are there is another better place a heaven that we can make too glory to god amen and amen so those are our dimensions of the rapture let me now summarize it and put it in diagram form so that it can stick with you and you can never forget it those are the three dimensions of the rapture there is the cloud dimension there is the air and then there is the seventh dimension heaven is that what paul calls them amen in first thessalonians chapter four here on earth we are still in these three dimensions that is the realm where you and i are dwelling and if we look into where we are where we are dwelling we have here all sorts of people we have the unsaved people those are going nowhere then we have the foolish virgin so near yet so far but we have the wise virgin praise be to god and the wise virgin she's the one that the rapture is coming for she's the one that is destined to be taken up hallelujah and then together with that we also then have them that are asleep in christ but at the time of the rapture what is going to happen first amen these will start to appear to us amen for a period of about 40 days but in their appearing we are still here in these three dimensions are you following me church are you following me church so they begin to appear and that is what gives us a rapturing faith the final rapturing faith the prophet of god says when we behold them when we see them hallelujah then it gives us the faith for the change of our bodies and then hallelujah the voice of the archangel amen it is what has sounded it is what has brought these amen and they begin to appear but after the voice of the archangel then comes the trump of god and when the trump of god comes then it calls us for a gathering a gathering way a gathering now into the clouds and it is in this cloud that is where we are going to ask his mama made it as papa made it his sister made it we are asking god gives us an opportunity in the clouds give god some glory [Music] we are not yet with the lord just the meeting in the clouds oh glory to god in the highest after the meeting in the cloud then what happens amen eliazza is already with us in the cloud then the king he steps from his dimension and he comes into the field he comes where ready hallelujah to meet his bride he knows she's just about to come so he steps down and he comes into the [Applause] and when he comes in there then the next thing that happens we are then caught up to go a little higher to go away to go meet the lord in the air oh give god some praise somebody hallelujah after we meet him in there then the final thing is we go to the last part then he takes us into the father's kingdom he lifts us up hallelujah from this dimension from this interaction of dimensions and he takes us now to go away to the seventh dimension where now the table will be spread praise be to god we have now arrived the rapture process is now being completed oh come on church of the living god what god has in store for you it is amazing it is amazing it is amazing oh glory to god things that are to be where we are going to be the rapture of a bride that is where i am going to that is what i'm waiting for that is why i'm in the message of the hour that is why i'm a believer of

again after kovitz when it looked like it was impossible but we've been together again just in the service of the lord and i believe something good has happened something good has happened to somebody how many can testify i want us to go out of this place with the shout of the king hallelujah whatever it is that you want to just shout we just want to go in a time of worship and praise amen that we

easter let's make an appointment for london god bless you florida hallelujah amen [Music] praise the lord let's give the lord one more time to handle praise [Music] [Applause] just before we fully dismiss we wanted to thank everyone for coming out these meetings would not be a success unless you brought your lick of fire together that we might bring the presence of god down amen so before we dismiss we would like to hear from brother wesker himself [Applause] [Music] i'm getting on off this i need some help to get up the steps there praise god oh what a night what a meeting oh my god west palm beach the next one that's that's i believe that's the lord all right to do that [Music] amen how many lives at west palm beach [Applause] amen amen oh were you blessed this weekend i tell you these brothers my god amen i've been rejoicing amen i've been kind of going through something on my body but god touched my body during this meeting all right thank you lord amen for that amen so hello amen my friend my friend my [Applause] how many appreciate brother westco a man of faith amen [Applause] we want to be dismissed on fire you dismiss when you want to dismiss we're not going to dismiss you tonight brother joe's here but the tax here but the joke from london is here so we have all night amen just a quick announcement to the local church remember service at 7 30 this wednesday coming up in prayer at 8 p.m amen we certainly want to thank the lord and how many appreciate brother jack [Music] amen [Music] amen and i just want to say one thing i think after these many wonderful word of faith from god we have enough to face that devil i believe we have enough to face the devil until he comes god bless you but attack [Music] praise the lord amen um i i just wanted to express my sincere thanks for rapturing faith opening the doors to have this meeting amen and i believe it was worth every sacrifice amen that the saints made to to be here and i know we had many from the uk but there was a you know we didn't we didn't publish anything we didn't send out any announcements y'all know sometimes we have meetings and we have chairs all around and everything like that but we didn't want to do it that way this time it says just fellowship between two churches and um you know and we included a couple others one of them would be amen uh brother joe underwood in the church from ocala and i think you can understand why they would be here amen you know brother joe underwood is brother wesco's son-in-law amen so many of the saints from ocala amen came to be and we're so happy to have them amen here and and then um spirit and truth is represented as well and and i think you know why that is because i assisted a little bit with this praise the lord so i should be welcome to come we had some saints from indiana south carolina north carolina amen and i think there might be something else i'm missing here um what other state i'm missing i'm not sure but nonetheless we just thank god for everybody coming and just making these meetings uh what they what they have been and and as brother whisper said we want to do it again and brother wesko confirmed west palm beach so amen i'm gonna agree with him on that so hey man let it let it happen again here uh tonight i just felt that the word that the lord gave us was a very prophetic word and something to encourage us if you go back and listen to the sermon things that ought to be brother branham preaches a sermon there that just really encourages you when you when you're going through something if you've lost a loved one or something like that that's a sermon for you to go back to to listen to it just really really just gives you a different perspective but i was just very appreciative the other thing i felt tonight a man um and and and and being a minister i know sometimes it's very difficult to bring certain sermons certain places but i felt like brother gwen had a liberty here in south florida and and you all have created that type of environment a summer like that can't be preached everywhere but somehow god said it can be preached right here so we're grateful a man that we could we could hear such words and and one day amen you'll see how how much this really meant how much this really meant just just everything after the sermon just some of the songs that were being sang it was a special moment very special moment i'm glad we got it on video blessed be the name of the lord so um i know that brother mike say we will um let you be dismissed so i'm what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say a dismissing prayer because some of y'all don't want to leave i know i understand i understand he said you got to go to work in the morning and all of that my god but when you in the world you ain't think like that now you serving the lord you all worry about work god the one bless you with the job come on somebody amen you'll be on time to work don't worry about it uh but i wanna i wanna at least just say a word of prayer and then uh after that we're just gonna worship a little bit i have a song that i was requested to sing and amen and you know sometimes what i find is that uh some songs the song leader like some song the congregation like and there are some songs that the musicians like so we're gonna try to sing a song that the musicians like amen let's have a word of prayer father we thank you tonight for all that has been done what a wonderful weekend this has been lord i i just appreciate amen uh all the saints here at rapture and faith just opening and amen and allowing these services to happen we starting with the pastor and his precious wife and lord and brother mike and brother fredo lord all the other brothers brother john brother stanley brother gene uh so many that were involved in in the decision-making process we thank you for how you let them uh people have been changed once again by services that have happened i believe that and i believe testimonies will come forth oh god for for what had happened in this place during this weekend father we ate we pray that as we've come to a close lord of the service services we pray god for your divine protection as we believe go on our respective ways many will be on the road tomorrow going back to the respective homes some even on the road right now heading back home some lord leaving out later this week going back to the uk lord whatever wherever the saints are going we ask that you just go with them that you would keep them until we're able to meet again father we uh ask that you continue to touch your servant brother weskel continue to strengthen him in his body and lord uh we just believe lord the impossible and uh father any others that might be here tonight lord that that might be going through something we believe that you would touch them as well i believe the word of god has has uh accomplished what it was supposed to accomplish here so a lot of i just trust oh god
