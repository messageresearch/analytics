you know kind of tough on us uh kind of cool up in our land I seen where yesterday was 101 down Miami so you know that's a little bit tough but I just like to say you know uh it's no secret what God can do you know I can testify about that because I'm standing here tonight 81 years old and by the grace of God still something on my heart to say about the things of God yes sir amen he's still a Healer he's still a deliver that's right whatever you have need of God remains to be the same I still see it going on actually I see more healing and I do salvation that's the truth God's word cannot change we're living in a day and hour when the powers of Darkness everywhere is around the children of God we're like the IND dangered species tonight the devil's out trying to put all your light out trying to put you to the ground that's right but that's not God's plan for you now they got a little church next door but they don't know what you know huh they don't know what you know and they can't know what you know and except God reveals it to them is that right but we're going to look to the word of God tonight just good to be here and I just thank God that brother Jack has asked me to come by this way again and I'm here for one purpose I just leave Le it out and tell it like it is not trying to win no popularity contest amen we come to church it's life and death amen we when we come what we hear what we do with it you're going to be held responsible for it amen and so that's the way it is but if you got your Bibles turn with me this real familiar scripture to Matthew the 16th chapter and I got a little something here tonight just want to try to get along to people and get us to understand something maybe a little bit deeper than what you would think it is and so God uh we're in there when the mysteries of God has been made known there is not everybody can even preach it anybody would hear God's voice in day that we're living in be hearing the same thing you're hearing but because they turn down God's voice God's Prophet they cannot hear what we're saying in this hour Matthew 16 let's look at the 13th verse down through 20 when Jesus came unto the coast of cesary of Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am they said some say that there are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am in other words they they're guessing about this thing they're just wonder who you are huh he said but whom say you that I am what do you think who do you think I am and Simon Peter and said there are to Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said to him blessed are thou Simon bar for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven he could Peter could not have known him except it was revealed to him by revelation God gave him a revelation of who he was amen now let me just say it like this Jesus could be right among you matter of fact brother BR said you better watch who you're talking about you might be talking about Jesus amen and so you got to watch that my brother and sisters because he is here amen now but I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it now and I will give unto thee the keys to the kingdom of heaven now because he had a re revelation of who Jesus was God said I'm going to do you got that Revelation I'm going to do something for you huh I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven huh right so he he because he had a revelation exactly right he re he realized what his responsibility was amen amen and what's there thou sh bound on Earth shall be bound in heaven one there thou loosen Earth shall be loose in heaven then charge he to the disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ let's just bow our heads great Eternal God we're grateful of this privilege we can gather together in your name again the seeing dear God come and thank you Father Lord for calling us out of a life of sin to serve a living God not a God that's out here a stone or wood or something like that it man is rejected dear God but a very present help in a time of need dear God so we heard song on the presence of God tonight and you're here present tonight you're right amongst us you said where two or three would be gathered together and hear your name and you promis to be there and your words are Eternal God they cannot change and father you're here amongst us tonight Lord Desiring to speak to us Desiring to bring us up onto a higher position in Christ Jesus so by little thought tonight as you're seated is true identification for the day that we live in true identification you've got to be identified now let me just you know if you bear with me tonight because you need to hear this because the Natural Things type the spiritual things I see things going on in the world we got people today that want to be identified with some ball player right some rock blop huh they want to be identified with somebody come on we got them out here got blue hair green hair orange hair they got all kind of hair because they want to be identified you got people with tattoos all of them they want to be identified anytime you see a 80 or 90e woman walking around tattoos all of her you wonder what's what's wrong with that woman and she lost her mind what What's happen but she want to be identified amen if somebody a hair style comes out nowadays amen the women want their hair I don't care if some movie star comes out a certain way somebody else some sister come cut my hair the same way that because they want to be identified that when you seen one you seen all of them because amen they're just identified the same old thing amen so if a woman want to expose her breast or something amen next one do it the next one do it amen it's just all flesh yes it h you can hide it or you can reveal it whatever you want to do but you're just being identified as flesh amen huh amen amen we can pretty we can do all these things but it's still flesh yeah that's right huh but thank be unto God tonight if you've been born again you a new creation huh not an old creation but a new creation in Christ Jesus amen there somebody else I I'm living in another creation amen not this old creation this this one that sin and done wrong and sin and done all these things that man died so I'm living in a new creation amen I I've done already pass from Death unto life amen and if you're been born again amen you can't die you died a long time ago amen and the devil can't defeat you amen because God done already give you the victory that's right amen now we can be talking out about anything one of the big things today I'm just going with the way the Lord lead me one of the big things today is people scam you huh that's right the devil cometh to steal kill and destroy right huh but Jesus said I've come that you might have life and have it more abundantly so when you don't have no joy you don't have a peace the devil has scammed you he's robbed you the devil is robbed and take away what God has of you amen that's right come on now glory to God we need to wake up and Shake ourselves and see what's going on are we living in a bubble all right are we living in Dreamland all right amen glory to God or are we adding time my brother and sisters amen look amen I've been back up you go 81 years back and I've been trying to live with the Lord for 53 years yeah huh by the grace of God Amen so I I I've seen churches when he used to preach just a message on Heaven and Hell and he would feel all up you're crying out all right then I've seen them you know and people lay up here over half the night 11 12:00 W the Holy Ghost now as years back but now we live in an age of huh it's total huh everything is in an uproar everywhere you go not only in the United States you got England France you got Russia you got everywhere you look it's the same thing because it's a spirit that's right behind everything is a spirit so now we're living in a Time amen that everything that can be shaken is going to be shaken amen but Prophet God said we belong to a kingdom that cannot be shaken and that kingdom is in me and you tonight amen if we've been born again it cannot be shaken it cannot be moved so God come down and put something in me and you it can't be moved I don't care what the devil says I don't care what anybody your neighbor says amen there is something in you it's another creation it come from God Amen and God is here living in his creation glory to God hallelujah amen amen let me read a few quotes to you I want because I want to build up and show you this tonight all right in a message called spiritual Amnesia preached in buring alw B brother Ram said you know now I want to said you must be identified somewhere you must show your live shows tonight where you're identified whether you huh well you been born again or well you haven't been born again there's no such thing as a drunk Superman there's no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you're either a Sint or a sinner one of the other now watch listen this real close now brothers and sisters and your spiritual attitude toward God's word identifies you your spiritual attitude towards the word of God identifies who you are amen exactly where you're standing God's word vindicate proed that the baptism Holy Ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of Pentecost or any other time and Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and your attitude toward that identifies whether you have spiritual Amnesia or not huh all right that's right no matter what you whether you're a deacon preacher it doesn't make no difference you get it so we find out it's contagious and hits the whole thing all right now uhuh spiritual Amnesia you don't know who you are now you don't know where you came from that's exactly right huh right who are you amen who are we tonight right huh right where you at come on identify yourself yes sir oh I can say Jack Duff right but he been born again that that don't identify come on huh come on that don't identify uh the man for this age all right now huh Glory when you forget who you are right huh come on you got spiritual Amnesia you don't know where you come from yes huh where you going you don't know why you're here amen we still have people to doubt that there is a Creator there are still people are still wondering their minds is because they've stud they people study all kind of books and things come on people trying to find out hey well we got uh we got all this warming going on this is going on Amen everything's going on and people don't know who they are there's people going to colleage tonight amen don't know nothing about uh politics all right they've T they've took God out of the schools that's amen I'm talking about colleges amen and the Bible said the Nation if it gets God God spiritual Amnesia amen I'll be turned into hell come on now that's why you're seeing what you're seeing let some college professor some college deny God put him out the school and and when they do that brother amen it brings death and destruction to that place amen amen it's a sicking air will even in huh a man don't know whether he's a man or a woman huh you got to be be identified by restrooms man woman are in between huh are part I'm part man part woman amen where am I going to go brother it's insane for them pass laws like that right that's exactly right at least they got sense enough most places if you go to the restroom at a restaurant or something they got a woman with a dress on all right now that's exactly right uh so if there's one with a dress and you have to presume that that next one belongs to the man all right huh so a woman be identified with a dress on can you say amen amen we live in in this day and our people are in Total Insanity they don't know who they are where they come from or anything else like that amen amen h say what amen this thing gets better every day hallu still still on this quote on spiritual Amnesia he said whatever Christian has been whatever believer has been every believer now is identified with that same person huh whatever he was whatever it is you must see he's saying You must be identifi he said don't forget that amen huh right wow you forget you're identified okay are you identified by God or Satan I know I gets down a little deep right amen but you must be F don't forget that when you do you got spiritual Amnesia you have forgotten who you are now identifi with him with Moses when he crossed the sea he said I was with Elijah in the days of Ahab and when they had to make a choice who that would serve God or bam we was with him on Mount carnal when he had to make his choice so we are identifi in the body of the same God that he was identified in so if we are identified in that body then we must remember we were there with him right we were identified in m mes Elijah huh the prophets because it's Christ was identified in every one of them that's right amen and we are uhuh we are identified in Jesus Christ amen so if we were there when he died on the cross we were there when he rose up and now we're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus as we are identified with Christ here tonight already pass from death of Life EXA and you know what church I'm just kind of challenge you a little bit tonight amen God has given us power and authority over the devil and why we're afraid to take what God's already given us and use it I don't understand it praise the Lord amen well God's good anyway amen let me read here he said this yes now if you now how are you identified with that oh have you some spiritual Amnesia that you find out you don't believe that signs feel father the Believers right see if you don't believe it then you have spiritual Amnesia amen amen if we don't believe tonight huh right gifts of the Spirit yes huh yes if we don't believe he's the same yesterday today and the sign shall follow the those that believe they're still casting out Devils they're still laying hands on the sick amen can you say amen amen it's got to be God started a certain way and it's got to end a certain way is that right now he said if you forgot that you got spiritual Amnesia see you've forgotten that God promised he said these signs shall follow them believe don't forget it you can't forget it and be a Christian you miss you must be identified with that you've got to believe that you can cast out Devils you got to I don't take just a preacher you sisters amen you baby get sick or something don't have to call a preacher you go down there and cast that devil off that child amen these signs shall follow them that believe not him or her but them amen we need our faith to raise up and take a hold what God's already done and be identified of who we are in this day and hour brother amen we don't know who we are we're just going to church and come by this is a good gather here tonight but brother we're here for a purpose God wants to identify himself in us we're his hands his feet his eyes amen we're the automobile God gets around in amen amen God's not floating around out here somewhere he's got a body he lives in and he can direct that body you go left you go right amen you go to Tamper you go here you go to or land amen yes sir hallelujah amen prise God now I want you to noce something here Peter with the keys to the kingdom now boy you think boy he God put in him a position so he is identified by having the keys to the kingdom huh and that's that same Peter when huh when they Jesus and the disciples back on the mountain side huh and there comes udas with a whole multitudes coming up with swords and staffs one of Jesus discip cut one of them ear off and he put it back on now listen Jesus said this he said why do you come up with swords and sa what I daily with you in the SAG how come you didn't do anything then he said but I know you couldn't huh but you got to do it now because the scriptures have got to be fulfilled huh that's right amen now listen real close because I'm I'm talking to you tonight you stay with this message you going to to go down some roads now all right brother Bram said huh there was three three crucifixions come on he was crucified at the cross who was being crucified the word that was made flesh huh yeah 1963 the prophet of God come on the scene although he was a prophet amen he hadn't stepped into office until 1963 huh to preach those seals now the message called uh Feast of the trumpet brother Bram made this statement that he said the holy ghost was bound not at the river of Euphrates but at the doors of Creeds and doctrines and ideas of man but the Holy Ghost was be loose by the end time message Malachi 4 so there the prophet steps in huh now he'd been a time that people thought amen he was certain thing but now he steps into the VA to that office and God's going to identify him amen according to Malachi 4 Luke 17 and3 amen Revelation 10:7 he is going to identify him here hallelujah amen his identification God Vindicated amen that Ministry even even done more than what Jesus Christ done himself right because Jesus said I can do nothing except the father show me amen amen but the prophet God was responsible amen for five people ra from the dead amen and it's not it's not the man it's the office he's in can you say amen yeah Jesus said I know you got to do these things now they're taking him they're taking him and go to they going to crucify him you know and and Peter made the rags now listen for yourself they said now we ain't going to forsake you we're going with you all the way all right I don't care what to do I I'm with you all of them said the same thing yes but Jesus said you know Peter said four clock crows twice you going to deny me three times yes sir huh now Jesus said Peter you know one I prayed for you said the devil desired to sift you as wheat now watch what I'm getting ready to say to you he said I prayed for you that your faith or your Revelation faith is a revelation fail you not what do you say brother Walker when the pressure comes down huh regardless of what comes amen your faith cannot pay you God has prayed for you amen that that revelation of who you are huh now watch this amen and when the day of Pentecost come and they were waiting for the promise of the father in The Upper Room amen and the Holy Ghost fell amen Peter stepped up fire and having the keys to the kingdom and he said hey I'm going identify what this is this is what the prophet joah spoke about that how in the last days God pour their Spirit oh men uh dreamed dreams and young men see visions and these things in other words this is what it is now listen he is a dentify the scriptures that joah had talked about it might been hundreds of years but there was a certain people that was in a certain position that was going to receive the word of God Amen can you say Amen there are things that people could not do listen the church there was people could not do the same thing today if we went back to Luther he could only come so far Wesley could only come so far Pentecost could only come so far but the people of that day were identified with the move of God for that day but God was calling for something else amen because the Catholic church has got them away from being uh of the casting out devils and healing the sicks amen they had got them way to just having a form in a fashion but brother God had to restore back that church can't start one way and end some way amen they were all of One mind and one Accord when the church started and they all had all things in common hey but when Peter and John went by the gate called Beautiful after they had received the Holy Ghost they were be identified as somebody else that lame man that lame man L there uh you know arms for the poor arms poor and they said silver gold have we nuh but such they're going to identify something people going to identify such as I have come on now give I unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk he reach down lift him up brother that's the place we ought to be in right now that God ought to be identifying hisself in me and you yes amen God's not on a journey God just waiting for us to come to our place of being identified as Sons and Daughters of God it's time brother that we come on up higher amen I don't know about you but brother I I I'm not crazy about staying here amen amen and we find that James said a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways if you don't know who you are

listen real close I want you take it home with you he said we just seem to see that there's no satisfaction among the people what what makes them do it but it's a it's for a cause huh it's a nature God give them that nature uh that makes them want to be to have something to identify themsel with God calls this people want to identify theirself with something they must have something or they want to be like an object in life huh now you think what do you want to be well I'm a wife I got children I'm okay children leave home huh and you ain't got nobody you and a husband there what if you accomplish in life but just raise kids H we're here huh identifying Jesus Christ in eternal life that's our purpose bit we're not here to do our own thing amen huh amen what if he a billionaire probably God said you live in the three room house kitchen Liv room bedroom how how big house can you get how much money can you have huh Solomon said you know he he had all kind of wisdom he had 500 wives or so he had everything and he come down he said you know all of this is just B ination of spirit you can have all of that not have Christ and you still ain't got what you need that's right Amen brother B told that little thing about marrying them two different couples one of them lived in a uh on a railroad track in an old box car didn't have nothing other mured they was rich so he went by you know to visit rich ones huh so he come up you know and he heard him screaming some and being throw hit the wall you know but when he come up they come door oh brother Brandon oh everything is so good huh and then he goes by down by the railroad track just just kind of see how things are going and up in that box car huh just a little old table box Bo or something one year and there was the wife sitting on the husband's lap and he's tell about buying her dress or something like that you know folks let me tell you God promised to meet your needs not your wants all right and when you when you go over and begin to desire something else it puts you in another position that you really don't want to be in I have seen people that was worth a lot of money wi the lottery and got billions or Millions rather and it wasn't long their whole fames messed up see the kind of what we see now they got too big for the PRS stay what God Made You amen don't try to be somebody else right they can't take your place you can't take their place amen now listen here so they want to be like somebody some of them want to be a movie star or Cowboy or something on that idea yeah just I told this before you know when I was a kid uh8 nine years old we could go when I live in West Virginia go to the theater there in Princeton give a quarter ride the bus over and stuff stay all day on Saturday watching movies cereals and go through all that so they was a back in them days y'all too young to know what I'm going to talk about huh they had to hop along chasty had lash Laro last R he was good with the whip so my dad worked in the mine so he had some tape for home me and my brother got back home so I told him I said put my dad's head on get standed over and put that stick in your mouth so I watered up that tape made me a whip so I backed off there I'm going to whip that that stick out of his mouth and it hit him across here now huh but that's what I wanted to be I want toidentify lash of root but I wasn't last root amen amen brother I just made a fool out of myself trying to be somebody else I [Music] wasn't I know why y'all laughing you mind not tried what I tried but you tried something else he said I heard on the radio coming home and some great Italian man at Denver was going to try to play Hopalong Cassy something with a loaded gun instead of that he's going to be a Chester the rest life he shot his kneecap off there you are they're trying to find something to identify thems with and the reason they're doing it is because there's something in them that God made them that way listen but God made them to be example to be identified with and that was when he made Jesus Christ to become Our Savior there's the example that's what people should want to be as a identify g with Jesus to be like him to be have that kind of identification anybody can be a churchgoer that's anybody can claim anything but there just a few that can produce the life of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen now let me let me skip this because I want cut down a little bit on something but I want hit you with this in here because it's just it's so plain in Christ is a mystery of God reveal brother Ram said the new birth is Christ it's a revelation amen now I want to tell you what the prophet said he say you ought to pray for Revelation more than you pray for anything else and if I ask you to show uh how many pray for Revelation today would hold your hand up I wonder how many else hold up her hand but he said you ought to pray for that more than you pray for anything else huh okay that's just a little smack huh on the hands for all of us huh we either going to do it or not do it that's right brother Bram said there Rapture in faith in this message huh something put you out of here you want to be identified with this brother this is going to take you out of here now it's a revel God has revealed you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressed it through his word but the same action the same thing that he did make the word manifest oh if the church only knew his position it will one day then the W will go when it knows what it is yes and he says here you know now you see there's therefore there's no school no Theologian no teaching of the Bible among any school that know anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it God has hid the senses of knowing it from ever elected teachers and everything else it's a personal individual prayer with that person that Christ has revealed to them and if you say he has been revealed to me in the life of Jesus Christ produced here in that Bible the same life was in him doesn't produce itself in you in you then you got the wrong Revelation all right all right amen God's word can out fa brothers and sisters amen what kind of appetite we got those in hunger and thirst after God will be filled huh now I know we like to fend OU men you know we eat e eat and uh sometimes he get bigger and bigger now if we eat the spiritual things you going get bigger and bigger too is that right no now we got all those people down here now everywhere you got to have ID for this driver's license you got to be identified everything you go at now it's got to be identified years ago when I go to a motel uh I just sign in but now I got to show them my driver M you know why things have got down they want to know who you are that's right and they not only know where you at they want your phone number at home huh they want to know all about you just cuz you going to motel huh amen now listen brother I want tell y'all something I don't know what you keep up with the news everything but about 10 days ago in Russia the Jehovah Witnesses had 40 churches in Russia had about 170,000 people they took every bit of those churches away from them it was it's on was on the news why why did they do that because they said they was the only one that had the truth now where's that going to put me and you come on now come on now talk about it you don't think pressure coming well you better get your head out of the sand Prophet said back years ago he say already on the books to close up these little churches with strange ideas all right and it can't get much stranger you know than to speaking a squirrel into existence brother huh all right you believe that brother Ward I sure do because I handled them all right amen you can't get them a stranger that uh but the pressure brother BR says you know when The Squeeze coming down you're going to see that third pole you're going to rise up you know amen amen you're going to come on up higher amen so but he's coming I'm trying to Lord just put it on my heart I'm trying to let you see who you are and you got to be identified you got to believe God's right with you right now right now he knows the very thought and intent of each and every heart here tonight my Lord folks this this is great you may not look at it like but it's is still great you know we've had all that had the women movement on there uh with Trump I'm not in politics I voted for Jesus Christ and it's you know not in politics but I'm just saying if if there's anything going on a crowd out here on anything people will jump in they don't know why they're even doing it you know why because behind everything is a spirit yes sir look how crazy it is they're fighting on an airplane amen something can H crash that plane and kill everybody they get fighting over their seat that's right brother that's exactly right what stupidity am huh but see where we at and you want to stay here if it's that way now what's it going to be tomorrow go God said years ago he said this thing going to raply get worse and worse and worse he said it and we're living right now in what he said you know I'll tell you how great this is you know your identification as a star from Heaven did you know you're identified as a star praise the Lord huh absolutely and you know that star is identified on Earth in you ask about Joe Where Were You Joe huh when the sons of God shouted for Joy huh in the morning St who are we we're a star from heaven don't want to be don't be be Elvis Presley cuz I think he's looking up from being down but hey man we're up looking down huh all right because we' represented in heaven now you said well this is strange yeah it's a mystery it was to be revealed where I came from where you came from and if I know where I came from then I know where I'm going back to w we well we're being identified in this day and there for sure you know and so brother B said in every Church age the people were identified with the messenger and his message now look at Paul he's brought under G camea educated know the law from A to Z but when he when that pill were far come to him the God spoke to him brother Paul said you know I count it all done he's brought up G all all that education I got all that what good has it done me and I just count as a bunch of dung that I might know Christ so he was willing to give it up what he knew didn't mean nothing to him he wanted to know Jesus Christ amen amen so even the people in that day would have plucked out their eyeballs and give it to him he was so much like Jesus Christ huh and look here what happened in our day people thought brother Brown was Jesus Christ because of the life that he manifested they seen that life that a identification that was in them and they know that identification only God could do those things can you say Amen now we are supposed to be identified with that same God living in us we're not prophets or anything but the same life should be in US Lord instead of letting the devil trample on us we order be trampling on the devil a little bit amen now we find here Revelation 3 and and 20 said Jesus said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man this is to the age now they were Rich had need of nothing but if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will SE with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne now talking about overcoming brother Bram said that God overcomes for you all right all right now what to go when I was talk about the three crucifixions I never La I never mentioned the last crucifixion but there's three crucifixions amen when When They Crucified the word of God when the opening of the seals where's the last crucifixion that brother W in me and you right because it's a word that's going to be crucified all right now huh you know I hate to be tough on you but it's you know right they of your own households you enemy is what the Bible [Music] says how many of of a family you know how many you know you might had a family of 20 25 you know but how many of that family that knows anything about what you know about what makes you different huh and what they'll do now I know you get F them but what they do I'm down the road tooo I'm in the same same thing they don't like to get around you because they don't hear what you got to say come on now because if you're children of light and they of Darkness huh they don't want that light to show in where they're living at right exactly right it's just like brother Jack was telling me about the church next door and the pastor come to him and said said you know I I told my people I want you sister dress the way those sisters over here dress amen the way you talk the way you dress and everything it identifies you my brothers and sisters so there is something to it I I mean it goes beyond the flesh because the only thing we're leaving here is with our character it's got to be a a Godlike character my brothers and sisters amen now so we we're we're come to this a certain place that we got to recognize when he died we died with him we're either identified out of Christ or in Christ you must recognize you have the body of Christ and what part of the body you are see you have to recognize your position your place you have to realize all he name and brother BR said when you realize who you are it makes the devil maduh all right good you know why it gets mad when he recognize who you are and you got power and authority over the devil no wonder he gets mad H he's not going to beat you around too much you know why anybody ever go through any mind battles oh everybody in here and the devil trying to make you believe somebody said this against you and you listen to that and it's like a seed at seed starts growing you say well old sister so and so said this about me you know boy I could give her a fivefold Ministry you know you know and that seed begins to grow now don't look at some of these other sisters I don't want to point out nobody amen you know that seed begins to grow and after a while it gets so big you remember that sister I know you ate me I just feel like bust you in the mouth what I've been praying for you a long time why you want to bust me in the mouth listen to everything the devil tells us and the Bible said to cast down every vein imagine everything would Exel it above the word of God bring those salts into subjection to the word oh Lord amen you I say that's all right it said the demons recognize Jesus Christ the demon recognize Christians they recognize Apostle Paul huh see we need to recognize we're heir to All Things ex that in Christ but as long as Satan keep you afraid to claim your inherence he's got you oh you got inurance God gives you in he died for you to have inurance God want you to have something amen now I guarantee you say you had an aunt or Uncle out in California died and left you a million dollars man you talking about tearing out of here you be down there get give me a ticket to California I done somebody done di left me in h left me a million dollars let me get on that plane right right they ain't got room for me I'll just ply myself I'll just wack my wings and get on out there cuz I want to get that million dollars right huh I know it may seem funny but that's the way the flesh is amen but the devil can talk you out of everything God died to give you in hers that you can have something amen amen turn with me to Psalms 93 please Psalms 93 amen amen I'm we look at something here amen Psalms 90 no 92 now just come on down with me forgive me yeah I got 92 here Psalms 92 look at verses 12 and 13 the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in livon and those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God you know what Flor is is to
