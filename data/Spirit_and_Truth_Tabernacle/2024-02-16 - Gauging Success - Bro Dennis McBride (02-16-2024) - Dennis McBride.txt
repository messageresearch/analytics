[Applause] people and uh Brother Joseph who is Brother Joseph amen praise the Lord God bless you amen amen uh I thank the Lord for his prayer that he offered up and I I thank the Lord for the song Amen cuz uh that's my opening scripture for tonight praise the Lord amen so I was like uh-oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen but it's it's good to be here um I thank God for granting us traveling mercies amen um I I I was thinking on my way up here brother Jack cuz I'm not I'm not a driver like that uh if I can fly I'll fly I I like to get there all right praise praise the Lord but uh sometimes you have to drive all right Amen to to go to the service of the Lord to to be of a service to God's people so it's a worthwhile drive in that respect sir but um during my military time I was stationed in California and the plane tickets for me and my wife was Sky I think for us to come home round trip it would have been like $1,600 or whatever and we didn't have much at that time you know young couple young in the military and what have you so we would have to drive but whenever we did that I would always make sure I had a 30 days uh period of time cuz I'mma take up about six days driving you know uh but it was one thing that I knew for a fact wasn't wasn't my lot in life and that was to be a truck driver I told my wife during those days I said I'll never be a truck driver I couldn't do it but for the ones that can do it praise the lord we need you and God gave you the makeup to be able to satisfy that need amen but God bless each one of you God bless brother Jack we really enjoyed him and his wife on last week uh weekend um as always I just he's always been a blessing to me his ministry and all and and so it's just good to have contact with genuine people real Christians you know the more experiences you have the older you get certain things become more and more valuable amen so I really appreciate uh I really appreciate him and I thank God for the opportunity to come uh when I got to the place that I'll be staying um I noticed how spotless it was was everything was properly placed I said whoever this is they clean like me and then he came to get his truck I saw it was brother quinnn I said now it makes sense all the washcloths and towels just fold just right I said man who is this had to shake their Glory hey man I just I even before the military I was kind of like in that mode I I don't know what it is but all right Amen Let Us stand together I don't want to keep you long tonight uh okay so let's let's go to Matthew chapter 6 and then from there we'll go to uh Matthew 8 and then we'll go to Psalms 85 4 Matthew chapter 6 and uh let's start at verse 24 everybody feeling okay tonight amen I just asked that you already sound like it so I enjoyed how you enjoyed the worship all right amen I'm not I'm not as get out in front as brother Jack and brother Diggs those are those brothers are real worshippers sometimes I got to fill in and I do it we have a good time I don't get out and do all the dancing and stuff I ain't as animated as that but I can hold a tune pretty good there so amen uh all right so verse 24 it says no and and this really caught me Saints as I was reading this scripture because the Lord is tying verse 24 in with the rest of this and I I never saw it like that before he says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other he says or else he will hold to the one and despise the other he's saying it can't happen like these are the only options good right right he says ye cannot serve God and he calls it Mammon then he goes into verse 25 therefore I say unto you so he's tying this in with that verse therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life right what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet yet for your body what ye shall put on it says is is not the life more than meat and the body than rainment behold the fowls of the air he says for they sow not neither do they reap neither gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them he says and are ye not much better than they verse 27 says which of You by taking thought can add one cubit unto your stature he says and why take you thought for rainment consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon and All His glory was not AR raay like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clove you and notice what he it's on the end of this he says oh ye of little faith right he says in verse 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink uh or where with shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things and he comes to this main point he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you how many believe he knows what we need yes brother and he knows what we don't need can we say praise the lord we don't we don't know that about our own selves right we think we know we don't even know that about our own selves that's right we need somebody like God to tell us all right the last verse says Saints he says take therefore no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself SS sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof Matthew chapter well yeah Matthew chapter 8 two verses verse 19 and 20 and then we're going to go to Psalms 84 that's one verse Matthew 89 and 20 it says and a certain scribe came and said unto him master I will follow thee with so ever thou goest Jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man have nowhere to lay his head and Psalms 84 and11 brother how you going to tie all this together I'm not I'm just going to lean on God I'm just saying what's on my heart just to lay a foundation and I believe he'll bring it together for us okay 84 and 11 of Psalms it says for the Lord God is a son and shield it says the Lord will give Grace and Glory it says no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly amen let's pray heavenly father I'm very grateful Lord God that you granted me traveling mercies Lord it was my prayer and Lord just how things unfolded events and things of that nature Lord I I I believed in my my heart it was your will for me to be here Glory but now that we're here Lord God please help us not to get into in your way Lord to hinder the flowing of your spirit these are your precious people Lord you know both The Young and the old Lord God you care about each one of us father you know us in particular you know our needs Lord and that's why we've come tonight Lord God to hear from you that you might help us in this area this phase of Our Lives this part of our journey Lord give us our day give us this day our daily bread Lord and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine art the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen amen God bless you sints you may be seated praise the Lord I feel good I'm tired but I feel good praise God the traffic coming here yes sir I said I should have did like I thought before I should have came earlier cuz I would have missed a lot of that traffic but I learned I learned am but by the grace of God we're here so now I want to just for a portion of time here want to work with this particular subject or topic um and I pray it be a blessing and I I pray that the young people are able to capture something from it um gauging success right gauging success depending on your upbringing you know where your roots are where you grew up at and what have you what school you went to what family you were born in right as you begin your days in this earth you begin to hear words at first you didn't know all of us right we didn't know what we heard we just heard noises yes and as we grew and as we matured we begin to understand through teaching right that's it words right and when we begin to understand words then as we mature and begin to understand more now that things that were being spoken to us we were able to understand them yes and once we reach the point of being able to understand the words that were spoken to us no matter where you were it begin to have an impact all right come on you begin to make decisions concerning what you're going to keep and take on to your like your environment begin to shape your perceptions of life and based off of what you were exposed to right that became your perspective right and you chose what you wanted to keep and hold on to and what you wanted to Dish aside that's right isn't that right right so your environment heavily laid into your makeup yes yes right so for instance if and I don't believe anybody here is in that situation but if you have a young person that's brought up in a a home that was racial they didn't know anything about that at one point right but the more they begin to understand concerning the things that were spoken around them and going on around them yes they begin to take on those same perceptions yes that's right right and they begin to look at life through that particular lens isn't that right so that's how each one of us are right amen I'm going to say maybe I could say were because I know all of us now we've been introduced to Christ but that that that that was a major shock to us all right because we had learned all these ways of the world perceptions of the world from people on right that's right and if you didn't grow up in a Godly home you you you you learned a lot of ungodly ways amen and then you comeing now now you come into the time of your life where now Christ is introducing himself to you and he literally has to deprogram us yeah that's right everything we ever learned our perceptions the people that we esteem the things that we esteem our priorities in life right amen right as Christ introduces himself to us through his word by his Spirit it begins to challenge our thought processes am amen so as a part of that from a young child no matter what age what grade or whatever there are certain things that are it begins to kind of communicate to you what success is in that stage and phase of your life all right all right yes sir yes the word success itself it means favorable or desired outcome it says a favorable or prosperous termination of attempts or Endeavors the accomplishment of one's goals so when you a young kid I got five then Young no more my oldest is 26 my youngest is 16 and I got in between there of course all right but I remember things they went through as they were coming up listen now even in church my God my God cuz young people are young people yes brother until they're born again they're going to think like young people that they're impressionable they're they're influential you understand what I'm saying like and I can I can I just be real like transparent right there are a lot of things that are said and done that parents have no clue yeah cuz amongst kids or whatever they got this code amongst them too depend depending on what it is they ain't going to tell you what's really going on right right so it's things that are happening and unless by chance one of them just are affected to such a degree that where they say I got to tell my mom or my daddy you will never know what they're actually experiencing you don't know the pressures that they're under wow wow even at that young age because even at a young age amongst the peers there's there's a pressure to conform to be accepted and to an adult or older per and I hate I mean even even amongst older people amen yeah that that that that thing is there to where it's like they want to be included they want to be accepted you understand they don't like the feeling that comes along with with being rejected or or or or or kind of you know moved outside of circles right so now they want to kind of try to take on what or change themselves to fit the mold of what's needed for that group or that particular person my one of my sons I ain't going to call his name but he uh you know all the young young Brothers around the church began to get Michael Jordan's he didn't have a pair and they would make fun of them brother now I didn't know that this was going on but it got to a point to where it's so bothered him and he wanted to belong he wanted to fit in right so he came to me and he said dad he said the kids they they picking at me at church that hurt me sir so you say but you got to give Grace though because when there's not a conversion that's there I mean evil spirits are able to come in they don't understand what they're being moved by they don't understand what's what's causing them to have these mindsets and to handle other little kids like that God so he was hurt and I saw the hurt in his eyes and he just wanted a pair Jordan so that he wouldn't be picked at so to him at his age in order for him to be successful at that phase of his life he had to have a pair of Jordans because his peers molded that definition of being except aced into his little mind sir wow wow now I'm going give a testimony cuz he ain't get the Jordans I ain't paying on $200 I pay $2 for myself reach my brother oh we had to pray about that that the Lord helped him to leave him alone but it's a testimony Saints this this this real life like this really happened so Air Force Ones right that's another popular shoe right he couldn't get Jordans but I told him I said son I said you can pray about it I said and see what God will do for you he said well Dad I'd like to have a pair of Air Force on I said well pray about it son I said God is able to come and answer your prayer if it's his will right how about we walking through the flea market and we passed by this table and the guy had all the Air Force Ones laid out and my son of course you know he he stop at the table he look up at me and I look at him but he prayed about it so then the guy asks him he says young man you want to try on a pair and he looked at me I said go ahead so he said yeah said what size he told him his size the guy gave him the shoes he tried them on when he tried them on he like how they look he looked at me and he smiled you know and I'm like okay not that I'mma get him at that moment cuz we hadn't walked around the whole flea market yet might be a better deal on the other side good you know how it is you can negotiate right so now now we we you know he look at me and I'm like okay you know we'll hold off right now whatever so he good a good attitude right [Music] right when you have a good attitude you see listen I'm talking about gauging success now sometimes you might not have the car that you want to have you might not have the house you want to have you might not live in the neighborhood you want to live in but your attitude toward what you have if it mean that much to me a man how much more God and sometimes God allows the he allows you to have those those those those pre- blessings you don't know what all God God has in store for you you understand what I'm [Applause] saying so even though I'm talking about what I'm talking about I seen God give me things and it leaves me sitting wondering I'm like Lord you had this in your mind for [Music] [Applause] me I mean the very thing I wanted and I'm sitting there like Lord you had this in your mind for me you actually thought to give me [Applause] this now one thing that left me thinking like that is when we first got off Mercedes at SUV it's a older model now but when my wife first talking about G I said man what you talking about a Mercedes we a no you know how much some things cost but how about Saints the Lord had one packaged up right for us that was at a price that was amazing it up couldn't couldn't pull it out on the hood right away listen listen the guy sold it to us for 11,000 this was years ago he paid 84,000 for it listen now he still owed 13,000 all we had was 11 he said you give me that and I'll put the other 2,000 with [Applause] it praise the Lord all right so back to the Air Force Ones so my son with a good attitude like it it it touched me now just to think about it he's my 26 year old he put it back in the box and he gave it to the guy he's smiling he's about to walk off and the guy said um hold on young man and he got a bag put the shoes in the bag and gave it to my [Music] son he saw that with his own eyes he knew he prayed for it and he saw God answer God cares about the young children so you can pray see I'm a witness you can pray you understand the truth and if God be pleased he'll give it to you amen exactly right praise the Lord hallelujah he's a good god oh man okay all right glory to God so I'm just kind of going according to how I feel led here all right when it comes to amongst you know you know some of the older people right young adults to older adults there's this there's this saying that I I I I've heard multiple times now don't get on me now cuz if it's something that you believe in and you you now this just me I'm just just brother McBride now but it just didn't set well with me right cuz you know how it is brother it's like you would hear certain people say things when all of a sudden scriptures come into my mind I'm say well that don't line up with that SC ain't trying to do that but it just happens like that and the thing of it is that I'm talking about is concerning you know your level of success your income level they say your income level will tend to be within a certain amount concerning the group or the your Associates that you hang with so if it's 50,000 your income level would tend to kind of fluctuate above or below 50,000 yeah right and that sounds good right but what they're doing is they're saying now you want to make sure that you make your circle if you want to make more money you want to make sure your circle has a high average income and in that way you can actually climb to those Heights as well isn't that right so now the scripture that we read here [Applause] here Matthew chapter 8 again uh verse 19 and verse 20 verse 20 is my focus he says and Jesus saith unto him the foxes have hes and the birds of the air have Nest but the son of man have nowhere to lay his head what so if you applied that mentality on right like you said who better to have in your circle right they ain't even have enough money to pay their taxes but that didn't matter right he said go fishing sir and the first fish you pull up you listen now you go get the money out of there for me and for you super he sent them out two by two that's right don't take nothing with you that's right that's right that's right brother now if you go by that Cal and say what would you would have missed out on you you would have missed out on so much and I'm saying that to say in this hour you got to be careful with that right brother it sounds good you know it's going out there in the everybody want to make more money right Lord have Merc who don't want to make more money in here raise your hand my hand ain't rais I want to make more money right but there some things that we need to come to grasp I'm going call it a balance if you got a six figure income praise the Lord but you only got it because God gave it yes sir but what happens too often I'm talking about gauging success the Bible says they that compare themselves among themselves are not wise the Bible talks about covetousness yes sir amen come on Amen this is way too much brother way too much okay bear with me for one moment Saints Hebrews chapter 13 it says in verse 5 let your conversation be without covetousness but notice how it says this it says and be content yeah with such things and ye as ye have for he ha said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee in verse six we understand that it's talking about a promise he said be content with whatever you have for he ha said that means your provider the one that's able to make things happen he have said I will never leave you nor forsake you see Satan is always always trying to get people to be dissatisfied always want more Never Satisfied and then your life becomes plague your thought process becomes plagued with always trying to calculate how to get more Jesus and if you're not careful it moves into a perversion to where now that becomes a consuming thought that's why he said with said in in the in the opening scripture of Matthew that we read in Matthew 6 he's saying you can't serve two masters you can't he say you can't serve God and Mamon right wow now he say seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all this will be added but he don't want us to put the cart before the horse Glory isn't that right listen now even amongst a lot of the younger adults and whatever right when it comes to making decisions in life oh Lord please bear with me right there are there are many that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen and they're going out trying to find husband and wives you understand what I'm saying but they don't even have the very core they just did a Mar a marriage uh Workshop now and man while you guys were talking that was just ringing in my spirit God has to be first in each individual's life he has to be the center he has to be really there cuz if he's not really there things can break out of control he's that Governor that helps to bring into check each partner yes sir you understand what I'm saying the word they go to marriage counselors and things of that nature that stuff ain't going to work like that you dealing with [Applause] Devils ain't no psychology no well put together statements it's going to reminy situations in the home you need the Holy Ghost you need God at the core he brings Harmony he brings peace right he gives Direction amen he softens hearts he helps he helps the husband and the wife to say forgive me amen he helps the husband and the wife to admit when they're wrong he cast Pride out so that real love and humility amen can abide in that home and that's where real power is right there amen amen amen amen amise God but when you try to go and Attain things you see the world put pressure on you it tells you what success supposed to look like so now everybody trying to go out and get the same kind of bags that got the same names on it the same kind of clothes that got the same names on it huh and unless you have that somehow people don't feel that they have come up to a successful level in life and it puts pressure on people to try to look like something that's really not there people that can't even afford it going and getting credit cards and whatever so that they can look like it because Society is painting a picture of success that people want to fit into exactly right so now these young Brothers some older ones too I ain't want to tap you on I'm I'm sorry brother I'm here but but I ain't here I'm sorry but they want to get these belts and because they pay so much money for it they want to make sure you see they got one on so they they can't wear the shirt out a shirt that's made to be out they can't wear it out they got to tuck the front in so when they walk around you got to see that you can see that Buckle cuz it means something to them for somebody to identify what you have on and give you props come on pre what is that in the sight of God has foolishness everybody all right I don't mean to yell Saints I I get excited sometime Lord have mercy GL to God Amen watch this Saints brother brandham says he endure the door inside the door he says and I always tell my young couples like this that happiness does not consist of how much the world's good you own but how contented you make yourself with the portion that's lotted to you that's the point I want to bring it to right there don't get upset with me now everybody ain't ordained to make six figures amen amen but it's nothing wrong with wanting six figures but it has to be put into its proper place so it's not taken into a perversion to the point to where if you don't get that now all of a sudden it's affecting you or it's causing an individual to put God out into a second third or fourth place because you trying to obtain this Mamon he said you can't serve two masters no sir we know that when we get too headr strong too locked in into a particular thing we're trying to achieve something suffers yes sir God truth and what normally ends up suffering especially when you done put your hard-earned money into something hold on now I done took out a loan I done invested $50,000 in that payment coming around this thing got to work Lord you can't even sleep good oh my you know that's the truth yeah real brother right am and because now you got this loan and them payments coming you know how much they all would have you you something got to happen oh God so you dedicate yourself oh God to making sure you do whatever necess necessary and I hate to say it like this but it happens like that sometimes we forget that God is the one that makes it happen Sira right meaning that's how we go about it we trying to connect this and pull this and do all this and that there and running ourselves ragged sir and our prayer life begins to suffer you ain't reading a word like you need to you understand yeah even if you read the word or listen to the message it's like quick quick quick quick quick hurry up and get something in just to try to appease your conscience but it's no real quality time yeah that's true Lord for those that are married what if you see your your significant other become distracted they with you but they ain't with you you in the same room you in the same in bed and you talking right and they're listening enough to be able to repeat what you said if you stop and say you ain't listening to me I heard what you said and they catch those last few word you said po [Music] po but you're not there now if we pick up on those things as PE as humans a't God aware of how present we are when we say we're spending time with him amen that's good praise the Lord Saints praise God we make plans right and like I said once it reaches that point then God begins not to be as much of an emphasis or a priority we somewhat put him there but we don't really put him there and consider him in the way that we should right he says lean not to your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge Him He said he'll direct your paths you might be running yourself raging and God got a easier way it might be his will to give you the very thing yeah but if you go about it the wrong way if you don't include him in the way you make things harder far more difficult amen praise the Lord Saints he says go to now James 4:13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor amen he says that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away he says for that ye ought to say if the Lord will how do you even know it's God's will just because we have something that we want to do yeah yeah who's to say that that's what God wants us to do but sometimes because you feel so strongly about it we try to make it God's will I really feel led about this Lord and if you ain't careful everybody listening yes sir if you ain't careful you'll go in the way of balum God gave an answer but because it wasn't quite the answer that he wanted and because of the desire that was already there you got to be careful how strong you allow your desires to be TR cuz it'll make you not be satisfied with God's initial answera and then you'll go to God again and it'll be a balum situation where he told balum it seemed like God was okay with it he go ahead go it's okay go ahead and balum could have said clearly God told me but what was the end result Saints you understand those things happen they're happening right now the truth sir even when it comes the partners with young with single people the Bible is very clear very C it says you you if you're single and you want a husband or a wife the Bible pretty much the Bible say you shouldn't even be thinking about that right off he said you should attend upon the Lord without distraction yes you understand because that Foundation that relationship with God is not there you will make wrong choices and how many of us know for a fact that those things have happened and are happening right now being led by the flesh through demon powers through carnal lust right amen amen well man they look just like I want them to look that's exactly like they got the eyes the eyebrows the hair the bill look how much money they make they got they got six figures B everything this young man right here is prime like Prime selection look at this sister she got everything everything in place amen and you ain't even listen it's so in place and so up your line you ain't hardly praying about nothing you you you feel you acting like you done got dust say at the Lord is't that right but brother Brandon watch this Saints Lord have mercy I'm getting ready to close brother brandom he said he married several young couples and it's two in particular he pointed out the first one he pointed out they had 14 karat gold door knobs is't that right bro that's right their weedding was magnificent and right after all that fluff and flush and all that stuff brother brandom said he went to go and check on them and while he going to check on them they carrying on and fussing and everything why were they fussing like that cuz the foundations wasn't righten you understand what I'm saying it was built off of the wrong things so when trying times come in when situations arise it just resorts to a carnal frame of mind and everything just happening just being carried out all In the Flesh controlled by demon spirits but then he said what they had was pretty much a facade it was a fake show cuz once he knocked on the door and they came they came holding hands they didn't know that he had already seen them in their fight and he asked them how is everything going oh everything is going good brother Brandon he said there are a lot of couples that are just like that but then the one that didn't have that I'm talking about gauging success they had all the material wealth 14 karat gold door knobs you understand what I'm saying Accord to the world man they were successful they got everything they ever wanted to their fingertips Fest doctors anything they didn't have real love they didn't have God so were they really successful but this poor couple he said the young man couldn't even afford to get a preacher to marri them so his friend his dad knew brother brandham and so he married the young man didn't charge anything or whatever but he said where you going to take him at young man take her at young man I'll find something and he found a box car yeah their walls I think were you know set up with newspaper right and their table was made out of cardboard boxes so brother Brandon went to visit them and it was a totally different story they had real love sir they had something that was genuine watch what he said about this and I stood there and turned around this way and looked up on the top of the hill and I could see the home of the other the Steeples top of the house I thought which is the rich man which one he says would you rather take Billy if you were going to take your choice let me have a real true wife one that loves me let me live down here in a box car for I tell you happiness and content money cannot buy money cannot buy love that's the real things yeah praise the Lord Saints I'mma leave you on this note I got other things here that I could touch on but I'm I'm going kind of omit those things for now for time sake and I'm going come down to this one little thing here that that there's certain things and I'm not saying it's intentionally done but I just don't hear it a whole lot because most people really want to have nice things and whatever and there's nothing wrong with having nice things right but you don't want to be consumed by you don't want to lust after you don't want to be Covetous right to the point to where if God don't want you don't even you don't even think to ask God about it you just want it and you do whatever you got to do to try to get it right but on that note bringing a balance watch what brother brandham says here in the exposition of the seven Church a samran church age he says the people of God are not Material minded he says they are christm minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy right right everybody hearing this I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm kind of slowing down here for a reason because there are a lot of people that are not satisfied with their present State you can want to do better but watch how you allow your thoughts to run CU it can move you into covet covetousness it can move you into ungratefulness exactly right now what you have you begin to look down on it you look you look at somebody else's car you say my car ain't like that now all of a sudden you begin to treat your car different the car that God gave you because you're not as into it you don't want to wash it you don't want to do the maintenance on it you let it be dirty but God gave you that car and God is watching how you're handling what he gave you he's watching your attitude toward it because he may have something more he want to bless you with but if you ain't taking care of the little things seemingly insignificant things you understand what I'm saying sir I've heard people tell me brother if the Lord bless me with a million dollars man I'll help the bride I'll do this and that and I sit there and I look I'm like well what you doing right now kind of is a a precursor to tell what you would do if you had more you can't fluff God up Sir speak all these sweet things in God's ears and oh yeah oh son I know you will do God already know us I'mma hit one more thing after I read this actually let me move that in right now all right everybody okay yes sir I want to slip this in here really quick quickly this is the message doors inside the door brother brandom says I'm so glad that he supplies our every need he promised he he promised he says he promised he would do that he says now he never promised that he would Supply our wants he didn't promise that but he still does it at times you don't even know when it's coming yeah but when it comes you just rejoice in that moment you thank him for what he allowed to what he gave you what he allowed you to have and you be grateful for it sir right cuz he didn't have to do it he says he never promised that he would Supply our wants but it was it was our needs that he would Supply I'm so glad of that because there's many times that we want things that's not good for us you may think you really want something or need something I'mma read on down he says I was thinking just uh I was thinking of that he says the other day when I was trying to shave with a straight razor and I was very awkward with it and I had never undertaken it before and my little boy Joseph was saying Daddy let me do it he says 5 years old he says and I thought now and he cried he actually cried because I wouldn't let him have the razor but you see I knew better than to do that and that's the way God is he said sometimes we think we we must have a certain thing and we'd only hurt ourselves with it there was a job I thought I wanted I was done wrong with it I should have got the job at least in my mind I trained the person that got the job how I train you and you got a higher paying job than me now I'm just going to be real with you to make sure he was a white guy now I don't have no racism mindsets like they ain't none of that in me at all but I made you what you are and you going to get put in that and I what so I was bothered listen my name Dennis right his name was Dennis nice guy good guy but I I had problems like how in the world it's going to happen I'm just getting off throw out of sorts and whatever and the Lord rebuked me Saints because there was another job that opened that was a job he intended for me to have once I got that job and I was in it I realized it was a better job than the other job was amen and you know what the Lord did for me he gave me a message to preach thou shall not covet I did I went to the church and I preached I was he taught me a lesson yes sir all right wrap up this last one here he says the people of God are not material- minded they are Christ minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above and it he says it's absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side side he says it was so in jesus' day it says and he says it was true in the day in Paul's day and it should be true today everybody heard that yes sir that's not brother McBride I just thought it was interesting cuz many people are not satisfied with where they are and they find themselves being discontented Paul said I've learned to abase and to abound no matter what state no matter what hand God allows me to be dealt I've learned there with to be content can we say praise the Lord he says rather they are on the Poor Side it was it was so in Jesus day it was so it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not too true today for the layer de seean agees one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit what happens is people begin to run after these things it begins to consume them and their inner man is suffering all because they're being led by what's being impressed upon them as the meaning of success they're running after these things trying to obtain trying to satisfy this life with all kinds of material stuff that's not everything everybody but there are some people that that applies to that's right and their relationship with God is suffering God doesn't even have real Fellowship Fellowship is very important to God you understand what I'm saying like we haven't even attained the levels listen that God is calling for everybody in this room I believe all of us are bride you feel the pull of God he's calling you to a deeper prayer life he's calling you to get into your word more meaning to spend time he want to reveal things to you he want to one onone time we make sacrifices for everything else you understand what I'm saying it can be something new pop on the scene and we'll make time for that depending on the value that we feel it holds and God is patient and he's a gentleman and he's having to deal with things and he shouldn't even have to deal with isn't that right Saints all of us can stand and have a closer walk with God he's calling for it it's going home time he's putting finishing touches on his bride you understand I ain't telling you anything you don't already know I'm just bringing to the remembrance certain Needful Things praise God that maybe we can consider re-evaluate kind of see where we are and then give God cuz he want to have the preeminence cuz when he has that preeminence d man we he going to take us places brother brandom said that I'm the one that get in God's way he said when I get out of God's way God can do things that William Brown don't even know nothing about God want to take us to level Saints we're used to living on certain levels but there is higher levels higher ples there's gifts in this church Supernatural spiritual gifts amen amen how many believe that there's Eternal purposes Eternal occupations that God wants us to invest in put the work in so that we can see results we're more than just whatever our natural occupation is but even within our natural occupation Eternal purpose is are serve cuz there are people that are there that God ordain for you to cross paths with and he's going to use you to help to bring a witness to no matter which way it falls sometimes it's a witness for their Grace and sometimes it's a witness that'll be a condemnation to them in the day of judgment the voice of many Waters sir amen God bless you thank you for your time I pray something was said that was just help that would help just a little bit right it's helped me it's helped my focus I want to put God first I want to give him what he deserves and I'm seeing results in my personal walk with God my personal relationship is being enhanced yes it and I feel so bad Saints I'm Ser I feel so I say Lord forgive me for all the wasted time cuz it's things I gave myself to that came up to be nothing and that could have been given to God who can take us places that we can't even imagine you talking about happiness you talking about fulfillment you talking about real satisfaction all that's in God Amen if you ain't happy right now you know where to go yes sir amen it ain't in some man or some woman amen listen Saints it ain't in your husband or your wife Christ said unless you love me more than your own spouse he said you ain't even worthy to be my disciple amen he is the supply for every one of our needs God bless you let us Stand [Applause] Together amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for these moments just a few words shared father according to the flow that I felt in my heart to go with Lord and I felt it was fitting God and you are the gardener so for seeds that are planted Lord you further work with the environment you work with the grounds Lord you nurture that seed Lord God you bring everything necessary to bring it to a full growth a full bloom so I pray that you would take these few things that were shared father and you would further Minister it to all of your children Lord and may it grow to become Lord just fixed parts of our lives and we always put you first Lord for those that needed to hear these things father God may you bless and strengthen those hearts Lord you know our needs even as we read today in your word help us to be f focused on the right things and everything else will be added to us it'll relieve us of all sorts of heartache and strain and stress and tension it'll help us to be more relaxed even as your word says father it'll give us peace in the midst of adversities may we take full benefit Lord full advantage of the benefits that you've laid before us father we love you we love one another Lord help us to love one another more help us to love you more have your way in our lives in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask all these things and we pray amen God bless you Saints appreciate you we thank the Lord for brother McBride uh on tonight and sermon I believe all of us amen got something out of and how we are gauging uh success um the um quote that he was reading there at the end out of the church age book where brother Brandon was just kind of um saying that we uh determine how blessed uh of God we are by the things that we have attained or the things that we have achieved and you know even when you think about uh social media uh it pushes us in a place where we have to try to achieve what the next person just achieved and uh all of it's very very uh natural we're going after this and going after and people always showing what we call their best life amen it's not their real life it's the life that they want to have uh sometimes s people posting pictures of things that don't even belong to them somebody gave it to them and using their influence right it's the truth anyhow using their influence and they don't own it but they going you going to try to own it because they got it right and and we keep running after these things and running after these things and don't realize that uh it's leading us further and further away from God uh I thought this was a perfect sermon and and young people praise the Lord if if there's nothing that you get out of it I I want you to always remember seek first the kingdom of God put God first in everything you do put him first when we were when we were coming up we made sure that we got jobs that did not take us out of church we sought first the kingdom of God and and if you if you start out that way when you go through life and the other pressures that are come in life you always keep got first nothing come before God and not just going to church I mean brother brother McBride even took it a little further how much time after church do you get a chance to spend time with God sometimes we have so many things that's just cloud in us and God can't speak to us we actually clogged it up God didn't clog it up decisions that we made clog us up where God can't speak to us right we got choices to make amen seek seek first the kingdom of God all its righteousness and everything else will be taken away from you everything else will be subtracted from you now ain't what the Bible say if you put God first God will add to everything you got I I I got a little something in my Bible I remember when brother chendi came here and preach and he say write some things down put in your Bible that you want God to to do and and stick it on a certain scripture there in the book of kings and and one of the things that that I I got in my Bible and I'm just waiting on the Lord to add I want my house paid off now now now I'm I just took it and put it on put it on a scripture I'm not going to do nothing else outside of what I'm already doing and I believe my house going to get paid off the other day I got a a check in the mail for $180 thank God for that check in the mail for $180 I wasn't even expecting it they said some type of lawsuit that I signed up for and I won and I I I I thank you for it and now now you know what it might be M of that lawsuit and I don't even know right but I I ain't going to do nothing else outside of what I'm already doing God will take care of [Music] that yes sir I love the Lord amen let's sing a course to this song before we go amen I want to give my best to you want to do what you as me

hand of Praise Jesus father we're grateful for the word that we heard tonight Jesus we know it's the holy spirit that sent the minister to bring father these thoughts to us each one father could uh gain from what has been shared here tonight Lord I as the young people I pray Lord that they would understand just the the simple principle of seeking you first God and not allow anything else in this world to become a distraction it's so easy for it to happen but God if we keep you first you told us everything would be added every need would be supplied sometimes it might not be in our timing but it'll always be in your timing so help us to just be patient and to wait on you God and so we're saying even as single people our foundation has got to be right the Holy Spirit Lord at the center of our Lives governing and guiding us and directing us so important father without that no matter what we say no matter what we do Lord we just won't have enough to make it but Lord we trust that father our Attention our Focus will be more on you as we as we put our mind on you then you'll send the mate at the time that you have for us to have that mate but Lord we want to keep our attention on you
