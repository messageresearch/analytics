better by and by but dear friend of mine and amen i just appreciate him and i'm so happy that my daughter is going to be a part of a man his ministry if i had to brag on him just a little bit he is one of the most balanced preachers you will ever hear and i thank god for that because there's a lot of fanaticism in our message i might as well say the truth there's a lot of fanaticism in our message so i thank god for somebody can keep it right in the middle of the road don't move too far left don't move too far right statement what the prophet said so i thank the lord for him and on top

never stop working praise the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen amen god bless you musicians and thank you it's good to be in the presence of the lord this morning [Music] amen [Music] so brother jack said 19 or 21 years ago i was 19. 21 years ago i walked through those back doors the church was packed folding chairs everywhere and i heard a guy singing up here and he was singing it won't be long soon we'll be leaving and then he's saying i went to church for a very long time but i feel it changed in my life and his wonderful wonderful meetings wonderful presence of the lord [Music] and we saw the supernatural done we'll maybe look at that in a little bit but saw god move in a mighty way i appreciate these brothers from florida appreciate brother west go open in his pulpit this morning and see brother smiley back there remember preaching at the storefront years and years ago there for him and see all of us back in one building for service together i believe the lord is pleased and that he'll he'll do something for us this morning amen i had a scripture i was going to read this morning i'll get to that in a moment but when brother jack was singing there a little bit ago and brother solomon about our blessings i believe he's got a blessing with your name on it this morning so let me read you a couple of scriptures from psalm before we go to prayer psalm 103 and verses 1 through 5 and then we want to go over to psalm 68 and read one verse there what an honor and a privilege it is to be assembled together with saints of god brother branham said if he had a a little vial of the physical blood of jesus christ how careful that he would be with it but he said i have something greater than that i have the purchase of his blood before me that he thought more of you than he did of his own blood and so what a wonderful thing it is not only are we blessed to have the purchase of his blood we're blessed to have him with us in our midst because he promised wherever two or three were gathered together that he'd be here so we just want to remind the devil our lord is here this morning and whenever wherever he is good things happen i just want to say before we read appreciate my family being with me my wife sister rebecca my oldest son phillip and nathaniel and ruth and brother fuhrman and sister april's behind them is my song leader at church and i was telling brother jack yesterday when they they came out of the amish brother fuhrman's family did and and when i was about a four-year-old boy they'd come and visit us in our home and they were traveling about two hours to church and and i felt a call on my life even at that young age and my cousin had built me a little bitty pulpit and i had a tape recorder that my uncle had given me and and i would preach and brother fuhrman would lead songs and 30 something years later not much has changed but gifts and callings are without repentance brother jonathan and sister sarah and their two daughters are with us as well from indiana brother joe crease he's there locally with us as well and just wonderful to see the saints of god what will it be when we get over there and it won't just be south carolina florida indiana uk but all the saints from all ages from all geographic locations brother graham said the angels will have to stand with bowed heads because we'll be singing a song that they can't relate to amazing grace how sweet the sound psalm 103 verse 1 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities even the sins that make some people uncomfortable yet his blood was strong enough to forgive all our iniquities who healeth all thy diseases some doctors will tell you well this is incurable and that's incurable they just don't know my god who healeth all thy diseases i like when the scripture says all like all things work together for good that means everything's included nothing the devil can throw at you there's no disclaimer except for covet except for cancer except for diabetes all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things that thy youth is renewed like the eagles and let's turn back to uh psalm chapter 68 and just want to read one verse there verse 19 blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation so we recognize there's some benefits to this when brother jack was talking about those packages being delivered it reminded me brother hoover preached a sermon from our church on that one time about daley loading us with benefits he said just imagine one of those big trucks backing up and you can hear it beeping as it backs up beep beep beep to your front door with your benefits every day he daily loadeth us with benefits you know you may have came in with the frown on your face and discouraged but i hope by the time we go out of this building you'll realize you're blessed we are blessed and i just want to make mention as well i didn't realize it until last night i we've got a brother chris cathy from our church that's ministering up in washington state at brother john andy's church this weekend and i caught just the very end of that service when we got back to the hotel last night and brother john got up and he made mention that today is the first day of spring and i watch little things like that brother branham watch little things like that we had a wedding this weekend there was a funeral this weekend and it's the first day of spring and god begins to move in his nature and we know the spiritual types the natural and so i believe you know it's not separating time it's uniting time and the bride of jesus christ he's not looking at the color of your skin he's not looking at your race he's not looking at your city or the name of the church above the door he's looking at is the blood applied and if the blood is applied then we can have fellowship under the blood of jesus christ praise the lord let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father lord what a privilege it is lord to be gathered with brothers and sisters of light precious faith lord to hear the songs of zion saying lord from from hearts that you can tell lord they believe what they're singing about and lord we've seen you move lord even in this very building that we're in but not in just this building but we've seen you over the years move in supernatural ways and grant deliverance grant healing grant victory grant restoration to families and lord even grant resurrections and lord we we believe that you're that same lord jesus here this morning that that same jehovah jireh that would thunder off of mount sinai is still jehovah jireh for our needs this morning and lord we just pray lord we know that you're here because you promised in your word that you would be but lord we just want to make you welcome in our midst this morning to do whatever you would lord be pleased to do lord move in any way that you would want we'll give you the glory and the praise may you have the preeminence we commit it to you bless these brothers and their ministries that are represented here lord brother brother jack and brother wesko brother smiley lord brother whisper the different ones lord assembled from different countries in different states and lord each one of us father may you just anoint may you lead may you guide our steps father in jesus christ's name we pray and the church said amen god bless you can be seated turn with me if you would again to genesis chapter 6. we want to read a few verses there this morning genesis chapter 6 and verse 13. a very familiar story even the sunday school children are familiar with it but god's word is eternal right and so no matter how many times we hear his word yet there's things that we can glean from it that maybe we never caught before and that's because his word is eternal and it just keeps unfolding and unfolding genesis chapter 6 and verse 13 and god said unto noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch you notice it's not just enough to look like a christian on the outside but it had to be pitched within and without and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it 50 cubits the heights of it 30 cubits a window thou shalt make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it we want to look at this thought with the help of the lord this morning on spiritually prepared spiritually prepared you know when god does something god doesn't do it haphazardly god doesn't do it randomly but god is very specific in his details and in his actions god did not just say mos or noah go and build a boat but he gives him specific dimensions to build the ark he gives him specific structural instructions how many stories where the window is going to go where the door is going to go god was very specific in doing this and what he was doing was he was making preparations for an oncoming storm that would be hitting the earth as brother adam preached about the memorial down here from the storm of 28 how there was an oncoming storm and there were some people that prepared for it and there were other people that didn't make preparations yet god sent warnings brother branham said in every age god sends a warning before he sends a judgment and in every age there's a message of deliverance that goes forth but that very message of deliverance if it's not received will become a message of judgment to others the very message that came to send a prophet into the land to set the children of israel free it was a message of deliverance but it became a message of judgment to the egyptians because they turned it down the very message of deliverance and noah's day that god sent a message to save noah and his family that very message became a message of judgment to those that rejected it but there was a group in every age that was being spiritually prepared for what was coming down the road and so god is very specific in his details to noah and he says build it in this dimension well maybe somebody could come along and look at it and say noah why are you building this boat so big why your family is so small your congregation is so small why do you need a boat this big we've got boats noah but our boats aren't this big i went down to the store and bought a boat and it's floating out here on the lake but it's never rained you're not going to need a boat that big you're not going to need a boat to that's how many years you've been building on this thing 80 90 100 years why do you need a boat so big because god said so because god said to do it this way but we've got a better way i don't care what your way is i'll do it god's way because he was spiritually preparing his family for the judgments that were coming hebrews chapter 11 verse 7 says by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his household by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith he was making preparations something about it if you've really got faith in the word of god you won't just talk about it but you'll actually go into action and you'll begin to make preparations for what the word of god said oh my god somebody said we're expecting a baby well have you bought any baby clothes have you painted the baby room have you went out and got the crib well no well i don't know how great your expectations are if you have expectations you'll go and it put you into action to make preparations brother nathan i'm going to marry a wife and you're out here in debt and don't have a house to bring her to and don't have a job that'll provide for i question if you're really concerned enough to be making preparations that you may not have the faith to put into action what's your words say if you are if you are looking for something you make preparations for if you're looking for a blessing to come you know if i was looking for for a truck full of gold bricks to back up to my house tomorrow and just deliver all this millions of dollars in gold i would make preparations brother jack i would take the money that i had i would buy the biggest safe that i would find or i'd take out the biggest safety deposit box at the bank what are you doing brother nathan i'm making preparations because i have a blessing coming many times we don't prepare well i believe god will do this and god will do that but we don't make any preparations to put into action our faith i believe we should exercise our faith you know if you want to go out here and get her an arm wrestling contest or a muscle building contest you have to go and actually exercise those muscles if you want to stand a chance at whatever it is that you're trying to achieve if you're going to be a high jumper or a basketball player or a football player you don't just walk out there and say give me the ball i'm going to throw it farther than anybody has ever thrown it you have to practice you have to exercise and so we're going to have rapturing faith how can we have rapturing faith when we're not even exercising our faith for healing and for the restoration of our family and for prodigal sons to come back for deliverance of our own things that we go through he said i got addictions brother nathan i'm tempted and i'm just you know what'll overcome it your faith brother man said overcome those things a few times and watch how much sweeter it is to you he said the greatest thing samson could come up against to that point in time in his life was that lion but when he overcome it that honey out of the lion from his victory was the sweetest honey he'd ever tasted looking at the unseen 1959 but noah because that god said it's going to rain he saw the rain coming a hundred and twenty years before one drop fell and made preparations to get away from it i'm so glad that by faith we can see afar the coming of the lord jesus and make preparations to get out of this old world that's going to be burned sometime with unquenchable fire the scripture says in proverbs 29 verse 18 where there's no vision that people perish where there's no vision now we've seen this in every age that men would come along and and you know there would be reformations that would rise up and they'd begin to walk into a little bit of light and a little bit of truth but then they wouldn't look ahead down the road at what was coming and there would be a dispensation change or there would be a changing of church age or there would be a changing of pressure from from one age to another from the lion age to the ox age to the man age to the eagle age and those who weren't prepared they got caught behind in an age that a dispensation that no longer was and they failed to recognize the changing of the dispensation of god brother bam said any man can build a brick wall and just go along and lay up bricks but when it comes to turning a corner it takes a real brick mason to be able to do that and so in each age a corner was turned and there would be a group of people who were spiritually prepared to see there's something taking place we're rising to a higher octave to a higher plane to a higher level and they recognized the changing of dispensation and walked in that light because they were spiritually prepared but yet there were others that remained back and didn't follow on to the move of god of what he was doing in that age and so we recognize brother branham said the only way we'll make it in this age is by a spiritually prepared church by a bible a scripturally trained church scripturally trained so we want to make sure that you know we're not just haphazardly trying to cut and paste things together that don't match but we want to make sure that scripture lines up with scripture line up online precept upon precept if you bring your doctrine and it doesn't come through this word then paul said let every man's word be a lie but god's word be the truth he said if any man come and teach any other gospel than what we've brought you then let him be accursed even though it be a minister or an angel from heaven so we want to go back and make sure that what we believe is lying upon line precept upon priesthood well brothers so-and-so is teaching it this way and this group believes it that way this group's doing it that way but what does the word say what does the word say the only thing that is going to get us out of here is the baptism of the holy ghost and you can't have a birth on a false word because the holy spirit will only honor his word why would he give his word and then come and change it and say well that was for another day no he honors his word so where there is no vision the people perish so we want to be people of vision people who can look down the road like noah did and see that the rain was coming and make spiritual preparations we by faith look down the road and we see there's a rapture coming there's a coming there's a resurrection of the dead that's coming there's a body change that's coming and so we want to be spiritually prepared that when that time comes we don't miss out matthew 24 and verse 15 if you want to turn with me this morning we'll read a few verses there they asked jesus three questions here and brother brahman said he answers them the three answers back to it and he's warning them about when when uh titus would come and and attack jerusalem he's giving them spiritual preparations for the judgment that's lying ahead now this was not the great white throne judgment this was not the great tribulation period but this was a judgment that would strike in israel there in the early church age and and jesus tells them in matthew 24 15 when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoke of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place do so readeth let him understand then let them which be in judea flee into the mountains let them which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are without child unto them that give suck in those days but pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day now he's spiritually preparing the believer that there's a there's something coming there's a persecution coming there's a destruction coming but i'm going to give you warning signs that when you see this begin to take place and when you begin to see that to take place remember what the warning was and make sure that you're out of this city by that time to where the histories tell us that there wasn't one christian that was remaining in jerusalem at that time uniting time in sign 1963 brother bam said there wasn't one of them christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved all right notice it's not just enough to see the sign but you have to see the sign and move you have to see the sign and recognize i believe the sign so i'm going to be put into action it's going to put me into action not just to not just to intellectually be smarter than the methodist or the baptist or the presbyterian well i have a greater understanding of the word but what did that great understanding do for you well i i know what the seals are but what did it mean to you personally well i don't know brother nathan what does it mean to you it means to me that i'm redeemed that because he came and took the book of redemption that now i know like john did john began to rejoice we looked at it a little bit and he got so happy because he recognized that his name was on the book and there was one worthy that had come to redeem it the seals aren't just something to make us intellectually smarter than the denominations it's something that brings revelation that brings quickening power that brings stimulation of revelation to recognize what we once were and what god's called us to wasn't one of them christians caught in there for they saw the sign and moved see they said let them that's on the housetop come not down or him that's in the field go back take not his coat but flee into judea and pray that your flight be not in the winter time or the sabbath because in the winter time the hills would be full of snow and on the sabbath day the doors would close the gate and they'd be caught in that conditioned sea we want to get on that pretty soon about how god does those things if the lord willing so we believe god still does those things he still gives warning and makes preparations now in the mark of the beast and the seal of god brother branham goes on to say in 1961 but those jews they all went into jerusalem and they said now we'll gather to the house of the lord and great jehovah who's always been with us will come down and he will drive away the armies of titus that's what it will do but what did they do they had sinned against the holy ghost they made fun of the power of the holy ghost in operation and they came in there expecting god to come on the scene but god had already come on the scene and they failed to recognize it and because he had already come on the scene he'd given them instructions and warning but they failed to recognize it so one group was spiritually prepared and bypassed the judgments and another group was caught right in the midst of it exodus chapter 23. i remember i was probably sitting right about where brother fuhrman and sister april are and a couple of sisters got up to sing 21 years ago and one of them would say i'm still still still pressing my battles 20 years later 21 years later sister birds we're still pressing our battles aren't we and another would would get up and from this scripture she would sing a song that said little by little all right little by little exodus 29 23 rather verse 29 i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and by little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land so we look sometimes and think we think well why why this god and why that why did you bless brother so and so he's got 10 more square feet in his house than me and he's got 10 more dollars in his bank account than me and his car costs 10 more than mine it's one year newer and it's this is that and we begin to compare with one another why this and why that why didn't you bless me with that and why haven't you taken this sickness away and why haven't you done that remember he said in his word he's not just going to give you everything at once because we wouldn't be able to handle it if he gave us everything at once but little and by little little by little and we look back down life's path brother jack and we see the hand of god moving and sometimes we're right in the moment and it's so hard for us to see his preparations and his blessings and all that he's doing for us but look back in the last 10 years and think of the testimonies in your life think of the healings that you've seen think of the miracles of god think of the financial blessings and the things he's done for your family and times where you didn't know how he was going to make the house payment but god showed up [Applause] what was he doing he was preparing you [Music] he was preparing moses in a desert for 40 years and maybe after about 39 years moses thought well lord i'm just out of here and i'm just hurting these sheep and i don't feel like i'm doing anything for you lord but god was preparing him for something that was coming along he was making him he was training him a shepherd a sheep herder to the egyptians was an abomination it was something filthy so you can imagine how it must have humbled moses when he'd been raised in an egyptian culture his whole life and god says come here a minute moses i'm going to make you a shepherd for 40 years and here he is in training and god training him all these years but he had a he had a opportunity and he had a commission coming where he was going to shepherd 2 million people in the wilderness and god knew this man was going to need some preparations you know we look at moses and we think goodness moses losing your temper and throwing down the tablets and smite in the rock couldn't you keep your temper my you try pastoring two million people for two days and let me know how your temper is he did it for 40 years my goodness he must have been a man of great patience and god is preparing moses because there's a group of people crying and praying for a deliverer and maybe they would go to their prayer closet at night and they pray god send us a deliverer and brother ben talks about how amram and joshua have been praying there and seeking god and god doesn't send him a captain he doesn't send him a warrior he doesn't send him a king he sends them a baby well this is going to take a while all right this is the deliver we're going to be a little wild but god was making preparations see we get impatient we get ahead of god and god hurry up god hurry up and do it but his timing is perfect [Applause] amen i'd imagine this couple right over here can testify to you his timing is perfect brother bam said the wheels are moving just right the wheels are moving just right we just have to get in the turn don't get ahead of his timing don't get ahead of his will by little and by little but brother nathan i feel like i'm doing so little just just look for opportunities and be spiritually prepared you know god can't do anything with you until you're in a condition that he can use you and so maybe he's just waiting on you to get into a condition to where he can use you first samuel chapter 17 and verse 37 david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine now i know we've heard the story of david goliath 500 times but we're going to look at it again just briefly and david here david is he's off hurting his father's sheep and puts yourself in david's shoes he was probably sitting there like a lot of us do thinking why me lord why couldn't i have been the oldest son why couldn't i have been the one out there in the army why couldn't i have been the one out there doing this and doing that and here i am stuck back here with the stinking sheep and so he'd sit down and tune up his guitar and he'd write another song nobody even out here to hear these songs why am i writing these lord why do you keep giving me these songs there's not even anybody but these sheep for me to sing it to oh don't worry david there's some people coming that are going to need those songs for their strength and their encouragement they're going to need somebody to tell them that to bless the lord and forget not his benefits to remember that he loadeth us daily with benefits and david's out there right and away i don't understand god why me poor pitiful me out here and somebody come by and hear him play and say goodness gracious what a talented young man why are you back here on the back side of the desert you should be here and you should be there well this is just what my father told me to do for now and one day a man that was in leadership a king and a ruler would get so angry and he'd say i need somebody to come and play some anointed music to get this spirit off of me and a man said hey i was traveling through the desert the other day and i happened to hear a man who was talented and and my he was cunning with the with the instruments i'll bring him and he'll play for you god was placing david at the right place at the right time and he may have been discouraged and he may have wondered how and why but god was spiritually preparing this man and maybe he talked to some of the other shepherds brother job and he'd say you all been having any any wolf problems no we had no will i hadn't seen no wolf in three years well what about you brother fuhrman you've been having any bear problems no i've seen a bear i've only heard people talk about well it seems like every time i turn around a wolf or a lion or a bear something's coming up against my sheep and oh my we've had some tight circumstances where i thought for sure i was going to lose some of my daddy's sheep and all of a sudden a little bit of anointing began to kick in and i grabbed that little sling and i got me a rock and whammy i let her go before i even knew what i was doing you know me i'm not even that good of a slinger but something struck me and i took after that line and i brought back that lamb and i took off after that bear and i got that lamb and i brought them back i don't understand why me why am i going through these things god was spiritually preparing him for something and one day he walks into camp just bringing his brothers some food and he says well you know i'm just running an errand for dad here look at all these other men and my they've got on armor and shields and spears and helmets and here i am in a little shepherd's uniform with a little leather sling in my pockets and a man happened to make a challenge on the wrong day you know he'd been making this challenge every day for day after day after day nobody took the challenge so brother troy i imagine old goliath was pretty confident that day well as he put on his helmet and his breastplate and he picked up that big old spear stepped out there he began to make his challenge he was pretty confident nobody's taken me up on it yet why should the day be any different than any other day well david was probably feeling the same way just another ordinary day no david this is the day that you become a giant slayer this is the day [Music] now i know we've got some good message trained bible trained people in here how many can recite to me the name of all of david's brothers you mean brother whisperer brother jack brother west go all these years we've been in the message and we've read our bibles i've read this book over and over and over again i can't quote you all of his brother's name but i'll remember one brother's name because he was an overcomer he was an overcomer you know the scripture says in one place there when jesus entered into jerusalem that there were two men sitting there begging two men uh oh is that a mistake in the scripture because another gospel just says it was one man but that scripture names this man so i believe there was something different about him he became a believer where this other man the other gospels don't even mention he was there something about it people remember you if you're an overcomer people will remember you if you're an overcomer this is the day that the direction of david's life would begin to change and he walks up there and this man makes a challenge and he says today i'll feed you to the birds david said goodness my that's a great prophecy well i've got a prophecy for you today i'll take your head from you now both of these prophecies has gone forth and one has to be true and one has to be false and brother brahma said when he stood there in portland oregon and that maniac charged the platform he said the that demon inside of that man made a challenge and the holy spirit accepted his challenge the thing i find interesting about that story brother solomon here this man so possessed of the devil that he comes in and he's making threats to brother branham and doesn't even realize what he's saying or doing because he worshipped that devil that he was serving and he comes and he makes this challenge on the platform the devil speaking through one man he was so anointed that the devil could speak through him you know legion was so anointed that the devil could actually speak through him didn't say my name's bob my name's joe said we are legion for we are many and he had so surrendered his life to the devil that the devil could speak through him so you mean in this age that people actually believe that the devil has more power than god that the devil can still speak through a man but god can't because trust me there's people out here that the devil are speaking through maybe you work with them maybe you go to school with them but you know what there are people that are so surrendered to the holy spirit that he can speak through him as well and this man would come to the platform and make this challenge not even knowing what he was saying and brother braham said before i knew what i was saying i said because you challenged the holy spirit tonight you'll fall at my feet so here are two men having a conversation and neither one of them are doing the talking i believe god can still move like that david makes this challenge and he goes down and gets him five little stones and he puts him in his back and he gets out one he begins to sling it and the scripture said didn't say he ran and hid behind the biggest rock he could find didn't say he asked for some help from some some bigger guys some more experienced military men it said he danced and he ran into the battle oh my he ran towards his giants you see there's something about it when god gives you a revelation you can run towards your mountain like it's not even there you can run towards your giant because you know it's going to fall you don't have to be afraid well the doctor said this and the doctor said that brother branham said even if you had cancer and didn't fear it you wouldn't be in too bad of shape it's fear is what makes the problem so we find that hebrews 13 8 says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's always the same brother bam said he's the same in his nature he's the same in his action so he's the same if he was back there in moses's day and noah's day and and david's day he's still here we've got you know we've got some proofs of his resurrection sitting here this morning we've got the proof of his resurrection but detroit's sister tanya here brother troy's wife she came to our church a few years ago and had a cancer on her head about the size of a buckeye and us brothers prayed for and prayed the prayer of faith and in 24 hours it was gone completely same lord jesus where'd brother joe underwood go brother joe underwood jr he's got two children now don't you they tried for seven years and in a prayer line they came through and was prayed for and they've got a child now two children a double blessing i was sitting about where this brother whose wife just passed away was is sitting in a service that same weekend 21 years ago and i heard a commotion and a sister layton from our church was asking somebody to help her and her husband had went into a diabetic shock and had dined and brother wesko and brother billy paul and brother ferguson went off the platform went back and prayed for him and he came back to life [Applause] and then satan tried to take his life again and he was out for i think five minutes and they went down and prayed for him again and he walked up to this platform and dismissed in prayer same jesus yesterday today and forever you say brother nathan i'm up against a battle i don't know any way around it or over it or under it brother said that's when god shows up and takes you right through the middle of it these testimonies paul said are for our examples or examples that that we have examples that we can look back not just to the days of the bible not just to the prayer lines of the fifties but we can look back memories in this church and my church and brother jack's church and these other churches represented we can see the miraculous that god has done and then a trial comes up and we begin to panic and to worry and to fear what about ukraine what about russia what about the economy what about cryptocurrency what about biden what about this what about coronavirus well god's brought us safely thus far through many dangers toils and snares i have already come his grace has brought me thus far and it's his grace will lead me on i remember riding in a car with brother jack's daughter zandy and and with caleb wesko and and i can't remember if rachel was with us or not but brother trevor and i we were going following you all to brother danny's to preach a youth service years ago and they got to talking about dr martin luther king jr speech and we actually listened to the audio of it and i'd heard portions of it but i'd never heard the thing in its entirety and something jumped out to me brother wesco that i'd never heard before you hear all these quotes from the speech but dr king in that speech he said makes this statement that you know for the uh for the the human rights movements and things like that that was wonderful but to a believer it means a little more to us he made this statement he said 1963 is not the end but 1963 is a beginning well and the the bride of jesus christ today amen [Applause] when brother banham came and preached the seals in 1963 that wasn't the end he said it became a new book to him amen it was just a beginning for the bride of christ it was when we begin to recognize you know what this is more than a sign but there's a voice that's following behind the sign [Applause] amen that voice was not just to make us smarter than the denominations you know i asked our church recently i said you know down through the ages now saint paul being a prophet setting the church in order in the first church age he was a prophet messenger then for five consecutive church ages we never had another prophet messenger there were reformers but there were no restorations they were just reformations and there was no prophet that would come so why in this age why in the last stage the seventh church age when there had just been reformation reformation reformation why would we need a complete restoration there were good people in those ages there were good people in luther's day and wesley's day and yet many of them baptizing and tidal still many of them smoking cigars and pipes and things and yet yet they were they had the word for their day and they were walking in the light that they saw why would we need a restoration in this age because this age would go the way that enoch went the way no other age had gone this age luther's age didn't need rapturing faith they were going to go the way of the grave and take a resurrection wesley's age didn't need rapturing faith nor did martin or irenaeus or columba they didn't need rapturing faith but this age needed a word that would take us back to the original that would produce a rapturing faith that would literally turn our hearts back to the pentecostal fathers oh i'm thankful for eyes to see it revelations chapter 5 and verse 4. john he's speaking here if you go back a few verses one of the one of the angels spoken and said who's worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and they looked through all of heaven and through all of earth and the seas and things under the earth and there wasn't anybody that was found worthy there was no prophet there was no priest there was no pastor no deacon no king that was worthy to lose this book and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and he begins to weep much but one of the elders comes up and says john don't weep there's a lion that's gone forth to conquer and he looks around and he's expecting to see a lion but he looks around he sees a lamb as though it had been slain from the foundation of the world and says he's worthy this one's worthy and verse 13 says in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i sang blessing and honor and glory and power being to him that sitteth upon the throne hunting to the lamb forever and ever people get a little worried if you get too loud in church but john got loud enough that everybody in heaven everybody in earth and everybody under the earth everybody in the sea heard john say blessing and glory and honor he was excited because he recognized there was one that was worthy to come and take the book of redemption that he couldn't be redeemed unless there was one worthy but he saw a lamb verse 8 says the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that means before you needed redemption god was already making spiritual preparations for your redemption ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 says according has he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world means before you had a need before adam ever fell god didn't have to get the angels together and have a conference and say gabriel michael wormwood we need to get together and have a plan we need to have a conference so we can get a plan of redemption he already had a plan of redemption and not only that but he had chosen you in him if he was ever part of him he chose you and him before the foundation of the world we were having a little fellowship with a few brothers a while back and don't get me wrong i'm not saying this to make grace a disgrace i don't believe i believe if you love the lord you should live for him and that if he's if he saved you and gave his life for you that you ought to love him and respect him enough to live for him but if you was chosen in him before the foundation of the world but the realm said if he could do that before you had any choice in it what can he do through you now that you have a choice in it and i asked this question because you know we see sometimes maybe somebody will go the way of the grave and we're not really certain well what were they ready were they prepared uh what takes place and we try to play judge and jury and all of that but i asked this question if he came at my worst if he came at my worst would it change my election if he came at my worst brother jack you say oh you just don't know my worst brother nathan but but look at where you're at now look where god's brought you from so if he chose you and brought you that far then then no matter what time he came or what time he took you it couldn't change your election brother ram talked about brother ramsey you know the minister brother there that he said he said he he said i don't love him anymore i don't love the lord anymore and brother bam said oh you don't mean that brother rams he said no i don't i don't serve him anymore if i if i loved him i'd serve him and he had a little boy going run across the river and buy him some alcohol because he couldn't buy alcohol on sunday and he died brother branham said god took him home [Music] so if you want to be mad when you get over there that brother ramsey's there you get mad but you know what there's nobody that the lord could give eternal life that i'd be mad about no if he's if he saved me in my condition anybody he wants to save is fine with me brother wesko i won't be standing there at the gate saying nope you're not worthy nope you're not worthy [Music] because you know what paul's testimony went out will be when i get there and i say paul how did you make it here what's your testimony unmerited grace and when i asked brother branham and moses and noah and david and they turn around and ask me how did you survive how'd you overcome in laodicea unmerited grace just his amazing grace so anybody he wants to save is fine with me nathaniel saith unto him saint john verse 1 48 or chapter 1 verse 48. nathanael sayeth unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree i saw thee he knew you when you were under your fig tree maybe maybe he would say it this way to us before somebody gave your parents that tape or before your sister talks you into going up to new york or before somebody invited you to rapturing faith tabernacle or the spirit and truth tabernacle before you they before they invited you before they called you i saw you in fact before the foundation of the world i saw you and i knew where you'd be i knew what your fig tree would be i knew where i'd find you maybe it was on a bar stool maybe it was in an alley maybe it was covered up with man-made traditions and denominational dogmas he knew where you'd be when he'd find you and he was making preparations for you spiritually prepared believe us thou this 1950 brother branham talks about you know i've got a i've got a tree in our front yard that the developers of our of our neighborhood they they planted a tree in the front yard of each of each house there in our neighborhood when they built them and and on ours they planted an oak tree and so it began to grow up and it's got to be a decent sized street now almost 17 years later after we bought the house and and every every fall you know there'll be trees in our in our back behind our fence there that they'll they'll begin to drop leaves everywhere but this old oak tree it'll drop maybe a few leaves and then all winter those leaves will just hang on there and you'll think goodness there's something wrong with this tree doesn't this tree know that it's fall doesn't this tree know that it's winter all the leaves are still on it but brother mama says old oak tree you have around here holds its leaves all winter long spring of the year comes you don't have to go pick the old leaves off just let the new life come in and the old leaf drops off that's the way it is let christ come into the heart the rest of it will take care of itself that's right just get jesus in the heart it'll take care of the rest we go around we tell everybody what they got to do what do i have to do to be saved we tell them what they don't got to do don't do this and don't do that don't cut your hair and don't wear your skirts too short and don't wear this and don't wear that and don't don't don't drink this and don't smoke that at all but when the philippian jailer came and said sirs what was we do to be saved paul didn't tell him all the don'ts he told him the dues repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you and your house will be saved and he didn't have to come along and check oh my philippian jailer my no still got some leaves there my goodness oh my oh look at that right in that ear can you believe that don't you know what that's a sign of brother don't you he didn't have to go along and do that but when the life of christ came in those old dead leaves begin to push off on their own you see we try to we try to paint holiness on the outside and say look just look like us and you'll be a christian that's a pharisee but when the life comes on the inside you don't got to go pick off the old leaves and say i don't like that leaf and i like you can't come to church with that leaf but the life of christ spiritually prepares the believer and it begins to push off those old dead things of the world and new life comes on praise the lord i'm trying to close we sang longer than i was expecting but i'm going to try not to preach longer than we was expecting that's all right i love good stephen singing you know what there's going to be can you imagine how much we're going to sing in heaven people that don't want to go to church but say they want to go to heaven i think do you know what heaven is has anybody explained to you what we're going to do in heaven oh but i don't like going to church well you probably won't like heaven very much expectation 1961 brother batman says there's only two elements in the world that control the world tonight that's fear and faith now once you notice this is 1961. this isn't 2022. but listen to his next words russia is trying to get everybody to fear them and we're trying to get everybody to have faith in god sounds like this morning's newspaper don't it that's the difference that two elements controls the nations controls the people controls all churches controls individuals is fear or faith so when you go to do something when you walk in these church doors you're either living by fear or you're living by faith i don't know about you i want to walk by faith i tell my brother all the time i drive by faith not by sight but russia is trying to get people to fear them and you know what we look at we can you can look at the news you can pick up a newspaper you can listen to the radio and you hear the tone of the voices the fear in the in the reporters voices you recognize they haven't been prepared for what's taking place but this isn't something new to the believer this is something that a prophet got up in the 1930s and shared seven villa visions in jeffersonville a little block tabernacle and said watch russia the king of the north watch russia watch russia watch russia but you know what he never said fear russia go ahead and type it into the message type it into the bible type it in wherever you want i never find those words fear russia but watch russia he told us about an earthquake that would take los angeles under he told us about atomic bombs he warned us about diseases and viruses and pandemics and plagues and natural disasters and the economy and bailouts and crooked politics and sodom conditions well i asked you was he wrong and more people leaving the message now than ever and i look around think mine these are vindications that what we've been following is the truth [Applause] if you can read a newspaper you can recognize we have been spiritually prepared for what is coming in this age and so it gives us a peace because jesus said in matthew 24 verse 6 ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and divers places and saint luke 21 verse 25 says and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall you they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory will i ask you have we seen it amen and when these things begin to come to pass then look up didn't say look down and get discouraged didn't say when when you see these things come argue get together and have a big debate with a bunch of ministers and argue about quotes and scriptures and fuss and fight didn't say get discouraged didn't say blast everybody else in the message said when you see these things look up lift up your heads for your redemption draweth night all of these things that are taking place they're not things that make us afraid they're things to make us recognize that we've been spiritually prepared and now we see the signs and it's not time to sit home and criticize or or to get discouraged and give up and quit it's time to lift up our heads and recognize our redemption is drawing nine recognize that we're blessed because we've been spiritually prepared for what god is doing in this age amen let's bow our heads together lord jesus lord we thank you for spiritual preparations lord as you've done it in every age lord you never left to one of them without a warning you never left one without a message of deliverance and you've done the same in this age lord that you sent a message to spiritually prepare our hearts and lord as we look around we see scriptures fulfilled we see quotes fulfilled we see signs and wonders lord we see you moving in the miraculous we see you doing the supernatural we see lord that you've protected us through colvin you've protected us through all kinds of upsets and worries and political uproars and domestic disturbances and lord yet you've brought us safely through to this point father if you've brought us this far lord why wouldn't we trust you to take us on further lord we're looking for a day where there'll be some that won't go the way of the grave but they'll take a step and they'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye lord will take a rapture to be with you in glory oh lord we're longing for that time lord if there's any that haven't made preparations lord if they're not prepared if they haven't been saved if they haven't been filled with the holy ghost lord if they don't know you as their personal savior father may they point back to this moment in time and say from that time from that church in west palm beach i was standing there one morning and the presence of god came sleeping in the room and i recognized i wasn't ready that i needed to make spiritual preparations and god came and dealt with my heart and from that time those old leaves of the world began to push off and i've been a different person since that time lord may it be this morning lord may it be a time of rededication for each of us lord if if we failed you all of us have lord but father may it be a time that we come out of this building more more determined to serve you than ever before more encouraged than we've ever been to keep pressing our battles lord we thank you for these brothers represented lord that are standing here as lighthouses in in florida lord of this message of the glorious gospel that you've given us lord we give you praise for it thank you for their testimony thank you for their stand lord may you give them strength lord may you help them to lord keep pressing the battle here lord may you just protect us as we go our separate ways we commit it to you father in jesus christ's name for your glory lord amen and amen god bless you richly [Applause] praise the lord certainly appreciate the word of god on today so brother nathan was just kind of winding down and pointing out so many of the prophecies that uh brother branham told us and we're just watching them be fulfilled right before our very eyes not for us to be fearful uh in this hour but to a man be prepared to be prepared i was just having a conversation with somebody um recently and they they asked me a question you know we're talking about the message and the ask me questions say uh is there anything that i could bring to you that would cause you to reconsider what you believe in the message and um i knew it was a trick question so uh my answer you know to that was uh i mean based on what i see and what what has already been manifested you know through brother random's life really you can't say anything else it's it's it's done it's proven but uh but i made this statement i say you know especially for those that are walking away the bible says that behold i send you elijah before the great and terrible day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts to the fathers to the children hearts of the children to their fathers that say if brother branham is not that elijah what you need to do for me is show me who is that elijah that's all i need if you want to change my mind show me elijah so another thing i want to you know point out you know this is this gonna help somebody right jesus said that elijah was gonna come and restore all things and it says i say unto you elijah's already come and they did unto him as it was listed and it says the bible the bible says they understood that he spoke to them of john the baptist however in that statement two different verses uh jesus was speaking of two different comings of elijah so one was representing john the baptist and a lot and the disciples understood but who is this elijah that's supposed to come and restore all things somebody says well that was john the baptist good answer now tell me one more thing what [Music] did john restore find it in the scripture what did he restore if you don't have an answer for that then you got the wrong answer to the question church we got a message that has been proven we got a message that has prepared us that's why we're not shaken by anything that happens whatever comes whatever goes we remain confident in our god to whom shall we go [Music] i feel like peter to whom shall we go you want me to go where brother stanley told you this morning stay out of them big churches to whom shall we go only you have the words of eternal life i thank god that i had an ear to hear what the spirit was saying in this hour and i have been made spiritually prepared oh hallelujah god bless you brother
