[24:06] [Music]
[24:27] god bless you saints it's a blessing to
[24:31] be in the house of the lord this morning
[24:36] brother jack has been on the theme since
[24:39] the beginning of 2020
[24:41] of catching the vision and stepping into
[24:44] it
[24:46] and uh god has unfolded many visions
[24:48] that i missed
[24:51] there was there's one that's especially
[24:54] precious to me
[24:56] uh as we went into the lockdown
[25:00] earlier back in march one of my
[25:04] co-workers contacted me and said the
[25:07] lord had inspired her to
[25:08] [Music]
[25:10] just have a saturday prayer
[25:13] time of sad saturday prayer and to
[25:16] pray for the nation and the issues that
[25:18] were going forth
[25:20] and she asked me if i would be a part of
[25:21] it it was just going to be a small group
[25:24] of the three of us
[25:26] and i prayed about it and i said lord
[25:28] yes
[25:29] yes i'll be a part of it
[25:32] so as we begin to meet
[25:36] we all kind of put forth what we were
[25:37] praying for
[25:39] and one of the things that i was praying
[25:41] for
[25:42] mainly that god would deal with this
[25:44] church
[25:46] that he would deal with his church and
[25:47] deal with his people
[25:50] in churches that they were really not
[25:53] being fed
[25:54] but they were just there
[25:57] and uh i
[26:00] i just thank god for how he moved than
[26:02] that
[26:04] and realized it would touch me so
[26:05] closely
[26:07] and as we met week to week we bonded
[26:10] more and more and we talked more and
[26:12] more
[26:13] and my heart it was in my heart to
[26:16] really
[26:17] share more with them but i didn't think
[26:20] that they were in a place that they
[26:21] could bear what i wanted to say so i
[26:23] wanted to be careful
[26:25] very careful how i how i spoke to them
[26:28] but
[26:28] the things that i would share they kind
[26:30] of hung onto the words
[26:33] and one particular friday night out
[26:37] i was praying and i was really longing
[26:40] to
[26:42] get into a deeper fellowship with the
[26:45] ladies
[26:46] and i was just talking to the lord i
[26:48] really want to share
[26:49] i want to share this gospel but i don't
[26:52] want to go before you
[26:53] because i don't want to lose them i just
[26:56] want to be careful i want to know
[26:58] it's you before i launch out and say
[27:01] anything and
[27:02] as we met the next day
[27:05] we talked and talked and the
[27:07] conversation
[27:08] changed and i began to see that there
[27:11] was a longing and a hunger in their
[27:13] hearts for more
[27:16] and i was just kind of following the
[27:18] conversation i said lord
[27:20] is this the time is this the time for me
[27:22] to step up
[27:24] and one of one of the ladies she started
[27:28] talking about the book of revelations
[27:29] and
[27:30] she wanted an understanding of the
[27:32] rapture and the tribulation
[27:34] and she was going to do a personal study
[27:36] on it and i said lord
[27:39] i'd hate for her to go through all of
[27:40] this effort and come up with the wrong
[27:43] conclusion
[27:45] so i began to just talk about my
[27:49] understanding of it
[27:50] according to my teachings and they were
[27:54] pretty much spellbound and as we talked
[27:57] more and more
[27:59] they were very receptive to the
[28:01] conversation and i told them i said you
[28:03] know
[28:04] one of these sanities i'm going to
[28:07] share you all with my testimony
[28:10] my walk with the lord what has been the
[28:15] success of my walk i said i want to
[28:18] share that with you
[28:19] and and just let you know where i
[28:21] started from and where i
[28:22] am and the ministry that i'm under today
[28:26] well it didn't wait till the next
[28:28] saturday
[28:30] we went right into it and we were on a
[28:32] zoom call
[28:33] [Music]
[28:35] so zoom ended
[28:38] we got back on zoom again i went further
[28:42] just opened up so many things in the
[28:44] word
[28:45] and uh we went through three zone calls
[28:49] still weren't finished so we'd say well
[28:52] let's make a phone call
[28:53] and we talked and we talked and i my
[28:56] heart was overjoyed because i
[28:58] longed that long to share these truths
[29:01] those
[29:02] ladies i was just so excited so
[29:06] i called brother jack a little later and
[29:08] told him about what had happened and he
[29:10] says well invite them to church
[29:12] invite them to church so i did i sent
[29:15] them a text and and invited them and uh
[29:19] blanca the one who's been coming i'm not
[29:21] sure where she is today but maybe she'll
[29:23] be late
[29:24] but uh she said right away that she
[29:27] would come
[29:29] and we were doing the two services at
[29:31] that time and
[29:32] concerned about the numbers so she
[29:35] texts me back and asked me could her
[29:37] daughter come
[29:38] i said yes for sure for sure blanca was
[29:41] a part of a
[29:42] a very big church and she was very
[29:46] active in that church
[29:47] and i i didn't imagine that she would
[29:49] want to leave it
[29:52] now her daughter was not her daughter
[29:55] hadn't found any place that she really
[29:57] wanted to worship
[29:59] so she uh blanca was very surprised when
[30:03] she said
[30:04] she wanted to come so she was
[30:07] dressed and ready dressed and ready to
[30:10] get here
[30:10] from the moment they came in they fell
[30:12] in love
[30:14] they fell in love with the fellowship
[30:15] they fell in love with the ministry
[30:17] the people and i just thank god for what
[30:21] i see
[30:22] to see the growth in them and what have
[30:23] you got is speaking to them in there
[30:26] you know they're walking in obedience i
[30:28] i
[30:29] truly think that's that was a part of a
[30:31] vision that i didn't know about
[30:33] i did not know about that but she
[30:37] she just loves being here and she says
[30:40] it reminds us so much of a
[30:42] church similar the atmosphere to when
[30:45] she lived in new jersey and she couldn't
[30:47] find anything like that down here
[30:49] so she settled for a big church and just
[30:52] got involved but
[30:54] she wasn't really being fed and the
[30:56] other young lady we
[30:57] talked about her too and she hasn't come
[30:59] yet but she's still in tune
[31:01] uh just pray for that you know god will
[31:04] set her free that she can
[31:05] come she and her husband and their
[31:07] children
[31:08] but anyway this song step into the
[31:10] vision it's
[31:12] to me it's very appropriate for this
[31:14] season that we're in

[44:07] some years ago um that song was given to
[44:10] her
[44:11] and we were
[44:15] song leading at the time amen
[44:19] and i still sunglee i realized
[44:23] as a thought came to me years ago that
[44:26] when david was
[44:27] made king he never lost his ability
[44:30] to write songs amen and when the lord
[44:34] called me to the pastoral ship he never
[44:37] took the song leading away from me so i
[44:39] still do that
[44:40] a man when uh it permits uh but i was so
[44:44] leaving at the time and
[44:46] and uh her pastor at the time
[44:50] they come for fellowship and pastor went
[44:53] back and
[44:53] they was having church and the pastor
[44:55] just made a statement say that brother
[44:56] jack he done stepped into the vision
[44:59] and that's that's that's what he said
[45:01] and um
[45:02] mom caught inspiration you know from
[45:05] that statement and she wrote that song
[45:07] and
[45:08] and who knew that years later i'd be
[45:10] preaching a whole series about stepping
[45:12] into the vision
[45:13] right amen and and this this series has
[45:16] been taking us through the whole year
[45:18] and i got
[45:18] i want to say just
[45:21] my outlook i've got about five most
[45:23] sermons that that i i want to bring
[45:25] amen that that's going to flow with this
[45:27] thought and and i trust that the lord
[45:29] would just bless us but um
[45:31] 2020 has been a a very um
[45:35] special year man a lot has happened here
[45:37] this year but
[45:39] but i believe it's a year that we're
[45:40] stepping into the vision that god has
[45:42] for us i believe that with all of our
[45:44] hearts so
[45:45] i'm under expectation for great things
[45:47] that those words hit me a little bit
[45:49] different today
[45:50] i overcome my faults and i'm gonna
[45:53] manifest every thought that you had
[45:56] amen i'm not looking at my failures and
[45:59] mistakes
[46:00] the blood covers all that man i'm gonna
[46:03] manifest the vision that god has for me
[46:06] praise god i'm here to say the devil is
[46:09] still a liar
[46:11] and the blood is against them
[46:14] the blood is against them hallelujah
[46:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:19] i remember somebody saying a long time
[46:21] ago i believe the prophet said it said
[46:23] you know
[46:24] satan if you're going to get me you're
[46:26] going to have to come through the blood
[46:27] to get

[50:40] i want to uh it's good to see sister
[50:43] carol again god bless you amen good to
[50:46] see you sis
[50:47] um and and i was you know we were
[50:50] talking about
[50:51] that um i was just thinking that when
[50:54] you are
[50:55] a part of a vision there's nothing you
[50:59] can do
[51:00] to get yourself out of it
[51:03] right if god has placed you in a vision
[51:07] right there's no one else can take your
[51:09] place right you all remember
[51:11] uh the the time that the prophet went to
[51:15] the house
[51:15] to pray for the little boy um
[51:19] and you know the man came in and picked
[51:21] them up and
[51:22] and as they were on the way to the house
[51:24] to pray for the little boy
[51:26] brother branham said uh does your house
[51:28] look like this
[51:29] and do you have this you have wayne
[51:30] scouting here and you got this you got
[51:32] that
[51:33] you say yeah brother brown that's
[51:34] exactly what my house looked like he
[51:35] said how do you know
[51:37] when had you ever come there you say i
[51:39] just left
[51:41] i just left your house right in a vision
[51:45] all right so uh so when brother branham
[51:47] went to pray there was
[51:48] supposed to be a certain man there amen
[51:51] and
[51:52] and uh certain things were supposed to
[51:53] be in certain places and
[51:55] and he went to pray and he got ahead of
[51:58] the vision
[51:59] praise the lord right and when he prayed
[52:01] the boy almost died
[52:03] and uh you know but i thank god that
[52:06] even though he got ahead of the vision
[52:08] it didn't change
[52:10] the vision oh come on church
[52:14] [Applause]
[52:16] it didn't change the vision that's
[52:19] because you got out of place
[52:21] in the vision it don't change the vision
[52:23] you might have failed here you might
[52:25] have failed there you might have did
[52:26] this you might have did that
[52:28] it does not change god's vision
[52:32] all right so what we what he ended up
[52:34] having to do is sit there and wait
[52:36] because as he looked around he said wait
[52:38] a minute wait a minute they say this
[52:39] brother here that brother their
[52:41] hat supposed to be over here but there's
[52:43] a woman that has not walked into the
[52:45] room yet
[52:46] and he had to wait for that lady to come
[52:50] he couldn't tell anybody what he was
[52:52] waiting on
[52:53] right he was waiting on the lady to come
[52:55] and she had to be in a certain place
[52:58] right he couldn't put the people in
[53:00] their place now you stand here and you
[53:02] stand there
[53:03] no no god don't do it that way right i
[53:06] mean but but by predestination
[53:08] he knows where each one is going to be
[53:09] standing
[53:11] i'm getting ahead of myself i have not
[53:13] even read a scripture
[53:16] [Music]
[53:20] but you you you can't stop the vision
[53:22] from manifesting
[53:24] and when the lady walked through the
[53:25] door the first uh brother graham was
[53:27] great getting ready to leave he said oh
[53:29] don't let him leave the lady just showed
[53:31] up
[53:31] he said please don't lord please don't
[53:34] let him leave and
[53:35] in some kind of way it's god allow
[53:36] something to happen to graham walk back
[53:38] through the door yeah
[53:39] he said oh not everything in place and
[53:41] say the lady wiping her glasses the
[53:43] hat's sitting over here
[53:45] and now here comes uh graham sitting
[53:47] over there everybody in their place they
[53:49] say now brother do you believe me to be
[53:50] god's prophet amen say i got ahead of
[53:53] the vision the first time
[53:55] he said but now everything is in place
[53:57] and if you believe
[53:58] bring your boy to me
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:03] and and praise god i guarantee
[54:07] your boy amen is gonna be made whole
[54:10] and he'd say i believe you brother
[54:11] branham brought his boy brother brandon
[54:13] prayed for him and within three days
[54:16] the poor was made completely whole
[54:19] [Applause]
[54:20] i want to tell you when god has
[54:24] ordained for you to be a part of the
[54:26] vision
[54:29] ain't nothing you can do to get yourself
[54:33] out of the vision
[54:36] and and i'm i'm i'm trying to go a
[54:38] little deeper because there's a greater
[54:40] vision
[54:41] that god has called you to be a part of
[54:44] an
[54:44] angel told a prophet to pick up his pen
[54:48] and write
[54:49] and he wrote things about you before you
[54:51] were even born
[54:53] [Music]
[54:56] let's read the scripture
[54:59] lord lord lord we got to read the bible
[55:03] now

[55:30] commandments
[55:32] unto the apostles whom he had chosen to
[55:35] whom also
[55:37] he showed uh himself alive after his
[55:40] passion
[55:41] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[55:43] them 40
[55:44] days and speaking of the
[55:48] things pertaining to the kingdom of god
[55:50] and being assembled together with them
[55:53] commanded them that they should not
[55:55] depart from jerusalem
[55:56] but wait for the promise of the father
[55:59] which saith
[56:00] he uh ye have heard of me for
[56:03] john truly baptized with water but ye
[56:06] shall be baptized with the holy ghost

[56:47] obligated for
[56:48] john truly baptized with water but ye
[56:50] shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[56:52] not many days hence
[56:54] when they therefore were come together
[56:56] they asked
[56:57] him saying lord without this time
[56:59] restore again the kingdom to israel
[57:01] and they said to them it is not for you
[57:03] uh to know the times
[57:05] or the seasons which the father have put
[57:08] in his own power
[57:09] but ye shall receive power
[57:13] and if i can put it this way you shall
[57:14] receive dynamics
[57:16] amen after that the holy ghost has come
[57:19] upon you
[57:19] and you shall be witnesses unto me both

[59:32] this um and
[59:32] some of this seed is prophecy uh when
[59:35] i'm when i'm reading to you some of the
[59:37] quotes that i'm gonna read to you these
[59:38] are prophetic quotes
[59:40] and uh some of the prophecy by you even
[59:43] walking into the church today
[59:45] you might not realize you fulfill the
[59:47] prophecies
[59:48] you are fulfilling the prophecy amen
[59:50] your life is fulfilling this prophecy so
[59:53] uh things that were written about you
[59:55] were spoken about you it might not have
[59:57] called your name
[59:58] but it knew your condition you know even
[1:00:00] in scripture
[1:00:01] uh you know we think about the woman
[1:00:03] with the issue of blood we don't know
[1:00:05] her name
[1:00:06] we don't know her name amen but the
[1:00:08] scripture identified her
[1:00:10] as a condition glory to god
[1:00:13] and there's many others that amen we
[1:00:15] might not have known their name the man
[1:00:17] at the pool of bethesda
[1:00:18] amen we didn't get his name but we had
[1:00:20] his condition
[1:00:22] glory to god and and sometimes when god
[1:00:24] is speaking certain things he don't have
[1:00:26] to call your name
[1:00:27] let them call your condition and you can
[1:00:30] identify with that
[1:00:31] come on somebody hallelujah amen so
[1:00:35] i want to just uh uh pick up a few
[1:00:37] things say man just to lay our
[1:00:40] background
[1:00:41] uh here i want to read from um
[1:00:44] uh oh my my my my
[1:00:47] let's let's go with uh it's the rise of
[1:00:49] the sun but just go
[1:00:50] um nope just i want to start at
[1:00:54] paragraph 103 on that and this derives
[1:00:56] in the sun
[1:00:57] uh we read this last week we were
[1:00:58] talking about how you can have two cars
[1:01:01] amen to cadillac cars uh but if you
[1:01:03] don't
[1:01:04] amen both of them can be filled with gas
[1:01:06] and they can have plush seats and all
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:08] say but uh if it doesn't have a spark in
[1:01:11] order to light it
[1:01:12] then it's no good for you right so uh so
[1:01:15] that that spark is what we call the
[1:01:17] dynamic power
[1:01:18] amen and we're not just interested in
[1:01:20] having people come to church
[1:01:22] amen just to say that they go to church
[1:01:24] we're looking for god to give people a
[1:01:27] spark
[1:01:28] in inside hallelujah the spark in the
[1:01:31] car takes place on the inside you can't
[1:01:34] see it
[1:01:35] amen but you know when you put the key
[1:01:37] in there something happens
[1:01:39] glory to god and we're expecting that
[1:01:41] when amen that this key of faith will
[1:01:43] unlock something inside of god's people
[1:01:46] we're expecting something to happen
[1:01:48] amen it might be a different experience
[1:01:51] for everybody
[1:01:52] glory to god but something should happen
[1:01:54] on the inside where you're being changed
[1:01:56] from glory
[1:01:57] to glory now the prophet says this no
[1:01:59] matter how much theologians
[1:02:02] a man claim how well you got your church
[1:02:04] set
[1:02:05] how much education you got how much you
[1:02:08] like the bible
[1:02:09] until that wave sheep until the holy
[1:02:12] spirit comes upon
[1:02:13] that person to quicken that word
[1:02:16] the gasoline represents the word it's
[1:02:19] the truth but without the spirit
[1:02:21] it won't move glory he says we have put
[1:02:25] too much stress on the mechanics
[1:02:28] and nothing on the dynamic
[1:02:32] it needs a dynamic power of god the
[1:02:35] resurrection power of jesus christ
[1:02:37] upon the church to manifest and bring to
[1:02:41] pass
[1:02:42] that this is gasoline it might be in a
[1:02:45] gasoline can
[1:02:46] could still be water see but only the
[1:02:48] proof of it is
[1:02:49] put the life on it it'll prove whether
[1:02:51] it's gasoline
[1:02:52] or not so we want to continue to put
[1:02:55] stress
[1:02:56] amen on the dynamics he said we put a
[1:02:58] lot of emphasis
[1:02:59] amen on the mechanics but not nothing on
[1:03:02] the dynamics so we want to continue to
[1:03:04] stress
[1:03:04] the dynamics hallelujah i've been
[1:03:06] praying that god would just send his
[1:03:08] dynamic power into the church
[1:03:10] if i want to tell you this morning as
[1:03:12] the song service was going i was feeling
[1:03:14] some of that power i was feeling some of
[1:03:16] that anointing
[1:03:18] hallelujah amen why can't we have that
[1:03:21] every time we come here
[1:03:22] we don't have to wait for a special
[1:03:24] service amen in order to experience the
[1:03:26] power of god
[1:03:27] every time we gather you bring your
[1:03:30] liquor fire
[1:03:31] i bring my liquor fire amen everybody
[1:03:34] bringing licks of fire before you know
[1:03:36] it
[1:03:36] we'll see the pillar of fire
[1:03:40] breathe god something that'll change
[1:03:42] people from the inside
[1:03:44] i'm not talking about something that
[1:03:45] just get on your flesh i'm talking about
[1:03:47] something that produces a change

[1:05:00] everybody got some kind of vision
[1:05:02] amen many churches had visions that
[1:05:04] crumbled
[1:05:05] amen because uh the the the pandemic
[1:05:08] coronavirus brought their vision to a
[1:05:11] halt
[1:05:12] hallelujah amen they had a vision for
[1:05:15] this and we're gonna grow the church
[1:05:16] this way and we're gonna do this and
[1:05:18] we're gonna do that
[1:05:19] and it brought her to her almost lost
[1:05:21] the church in corona virus
[1:05:23] amen by see we have something greater
[1:05:25] than a man a business vision
[1:05:28] we had something greater than a personal
[1:05:31] vision
[1:05:31] we had something greater amen than just
[1:05:34] any old kind of vision
[1:05:36] we have something greater than 20 20
[1:05:38] vision
[1:05:39] praise god we have heavenly vision
[1:05:43] and glory to god amen we're not
[1:05:46] limited by what's going on on the earth
[1:05:48] amen we're rising up to a higher
[1:05:51] plane a greater atmosphere
[1:05:54] glory to god church amen we thank god
[1:05:58] for the natural things but we talk about
[1:06:00] spiritual things
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:03] glory to god so here the angels say pick
[1:06:06] up your pen and write and brother
[1:06:07] branham
[1:06:08] wrote down all these things i want to
[1:06:10] say roughly two and a half pages
[1:06:12] and now what i've done by the holy
[1:06:14] spirit just leading we've taken
[1:06:16] paragraph by paragraph and we've just
[1:06:18] been preaching
[1:06:19] a series of sermons from that vision
[1:06:22] and here we are amen in another
[1:06:24] paragraph and we're just
[1:06:26] we're we're trying to find where the
[1:06:27] holy spirit is going to
[1:06:29] actually lead us to amen and and here
[1:06:32] i've already preached three sermons
[1:06:33] really from this one paragraph
[1:06:35] this my third sermon now look at this
[1:06:37] amen
[1:06:38] he says the statement in spoken words
[1:06:40] original seed part two
[1:06:42] it says how can you tell them
[1:06:45] now now what he's saying here uh let me
[1:06:48] just leave
[1:06:49] before before i say it what he's saying
[1:06:51] here is that there's two spirits within
[1:06:53] the framework of the church
[1:06:55] amen there's a false spirit amen and
[1:06:58] there's a true spirit let me
[1:07:00] take it down again i'm i got to explain
[1:07:02] these things
[1:07:03] amen there's a false spirit and there's
[1:07:05] a true spirit now i need to understand
[1:07:07] both spirits are anointed by the genuine
[1:07:11] holy ghost bull spirits will have
[1:07:15] manifestations by the genuine holy ghost
[1:07:18] because when the rain falls it falls on
[1:07:22] the just and the unjust
[1:07:24] i was talking last week about those
[1:07:26] weeds that got around
[1:07:27] amen the things that i planted in my
[1:07:29] front yard amen
[1:07:31] the rain when it's coming i want the
[1:07:33] rain to grow
[1:07:34] those trees that i planted but somehow
[1:07:36] weeds get in there
[1:07:38] and the weeds start growing right along
[1:07:40] with my trees i didn't plant those
[1:07:43] weeds where did they come from the devil
[1:07:46] brings that in
[1:07:47] and the devil liked to bring stuff into
[1:07:49] the church but the holy ghost
[1:07:52] is here to pull every weed out
[1:07:58] amen the weed is there to try to take
[1:08:01] the life from the seed
[1:08:03] but god will pull them weeds out
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:08] hallelujah glory to god so so
[1:08:11] so so he said you know that there's
[1:08:13] these two spirits within the framework
[1:08:15] of the church
[1:08:16] and by god's spirit you got to be able
[1:08:19] to discern and withstand
[1:08:20] what is happening in the church by god's
[1:08:24] spirit you got to be able to discern it
[1:08:26] because it looked it looked real it
[1:08:29] looked genuine
[1:08:30] it looked like the real thing hallelujah
[1:08:33] glory to god
[1:08:34] they teach those those those tellers at
[1:08:37] the bank how to spot a fake dollar
[1:08:40] how to spot a fake 20. they have certain
[1:08:43] things they have to do
[1:08:44] amen maybe they take a little uh pen
[1:08:46] that they get
[1:08:47] and they just draw a little line on it
[1:08:49] and and if it doesn't
[1:08:51] produce a certain effect they know this
[1:08:53] thing is fake
[1:08:57] glory to god you got to amen you got to
[1:09:00] be able to give it a specific test
[1:09:02] and when it comes to the word of god
[1:09:05] when it comes to discerning
[1:09:07] whether it's the true spirit of god or
[1:09:10] not
[1:09:10] the way you discern it is by giving it a
[1:09:13] word
[1:09:14] test can you
[1:09:17] find it in scripture not find it in your
[1:09:20] feelings
[1:09:21] not find it in your flesh but can you
[1:09:24] find what i'm talking about
[1:09:26] in the scripture if it passes the word
[1:09:29] test then it's from god
[1:09:36] now let me read this it's got to pass
[1:09:39] the word test
[1:09:40] watch this now it says how can you tell
[1:09:43] them
[1:09:44] give them the word test how can you know
[1:09:46] it
[1:09:47] speak the word see what they say about
[1:09:50] it
[1:09:51] my god there's a lot that i can say
[1:09:53] there see what they say about it
[1:09:56] amen give them the words amen when i'm
[1:09:59] talking about god sending prophet i'm
[1:10:00] talking about malachi 4.
[1:10:02] all right let's talk about revelation
[1:10:04] 10. yes
[1:10:05] i'm talking about things that god put in
[1:10:07] scripture
[1:10:09] and hallelujah if we can believe john
[1:10:11] the baptist what's the fulfillment
[1:10:14] of certain scriptures then we got to
[1:10:15] believe amen just like god had a a full
[1:10:18] run at his first coming he would have a
[1:10:20] forerunner at his second coming
[1:10:23] all right church all right all right all
[1:10:25] right it's give him the word test
[1:10:27] glory to god and i always ask people
[1:10:29] saying now if you say brother brand i'm
[1:10:30] not the fulfillment of malachi
[1:10:31] 4 just tell me who is that's all just
[1:10:35] tell me who he is
[1:10:36] you can you can tell me a lot about i
[1:10:37] don't think it's him well who is it
[1:10:40] amen i need to know because that promise
[1:10:43] was sent to me
[1:10:44] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[1:10:48] before the coming of the dreadful day of
[1:10:50] the lord that's a promise directly to me
[1:10:53] so you need to tell me who he is
[1:10:56] amen all right all right glory to god
[1:10:59] let me go
[1:11:00] it says now speak the word see what they
[1:11:02] say about it
[1:11:03] if they don't believe the word they have
[1:11:04] no seed germ
[1:11:06] in them if you don't believe the word
[1:11:09] what's already written in the bible you
[1:11:11] have no seed germ in you
[1:11:13] it says they are of the evil one and
[1:11:15] deceive you
[1:11:17] my god think about it now amen there are
[1:11:19] the evil one and deceive you
[1:11:21] as the first bride was deceived
[1:11:24] and the second bride was deceived
[1:11:28] they are deceivers of the third broad by
[1:11:31] high reading the word the third bride of
[1:11:32] you the first bride was adam and
[1:11:34] amen and uh and uh eve
[1:11:37] amen he was deceived a second bride amen
[1:11:40] would have been jehovah
[1:11:41] and uh and in israel nation nation of
[1:11:44] israel
[1:11:45] the third bride would have been jesus
[1:11:46] and the bride amen
[1:11:48] and and i want to tell you that church
[1:11:50] was deceived when they allowed the
[1:11:52] catholic
[1:11:52] the dogma to kind of get started after
[1:11:54] the 19th encounter they with the
[1:11:56] council they were deceived the church
[1:11:59] was deceived
[1:11:59] but there is a promise amen there's a
[1:12:03] promise that i will restore saith the
[1:12:06] lord
[1:12:06] that is a vision
[1:12:10] and you are walking in that vision
[1:12:14] you're part of joel's prophecy glory to
[1:12:17] god
[1:12:18] all right let me let me keep reading it
[1:12:20] says uh as
[1:12:21] a bride as the first pride was deceived
[1:12:23] and the second bride was deceived they
[1:12:25] are deceivers of the third bride
[1:12:27] by high breeding the word or trying to
[1:12:31] god never placed signs ahead of his
[1:12:33] words i
[1:12:34] like that statement because people get
[1:12:37] confused amen
[1:12:38] with the anointing they can see the
[1:12:41] anointing on certain things
[1:12:43] and they say there's got to be god know
[1:12:45] the rain has fallen on the just in the
[1:12:47] unjust
[1:12:48] if they can't stay with the word then
[1:12:50] it's not of god
[1:12:52] amen you know moses was anointed and he
[1:12:55] got worn out the rock when he hit it
[1:12:56] twice
[1:12:57] right but he he got away from the word
[1:13:00] of god and missed going into the
[1:13:01] promised land
[1:13:03] so we're not just looking at the
[1:13:04] anointing hallelujah
[1:13:07] we want the word with the anointing
[1:13:08] that's right in other words we want
[1:13:10] spirit
[1:13:14] amen we want spirit and truth
[1:13:19] brother don't give me spirit only that's
[1:13:21] what many of them had
[1:13:22] they had the spirit only and no truth
[1:13:25] and then some had truth only and no
[1:13:27] spirit
[1:13:28] we want them both together
[1:13:33] mechanics and dynamics all right let me
[1:13:36] keep reading says god never play sounds
[1:13:38] ahead of his wording man that's a
[1:13:39] scorcher
[1:13:40] god never played signs ahead of his word
[1:13:42] they were added for proof of the word
[1:13:44] but the word is first and that's what
[1:13:47] we're saying here right now we're
[1:13:48] storing the word
[1:13:49] first it says to prove it elijah said to
[1:13:51] the woman bake
[1:13:52] me a cake first and then watch the
[1:13:55] miracle happen come to the word
[1:13:57] first and then watch the miracle the
[1:14:00] seed word itself
[1:14:02] so once it's sown hallelujah the c word
[1:14:05] itself
[1:14:06] is what the holy spirit energizes
[1:14:09] that's where we're getting our thought
[1:14:11] from amen the the the the
[1:14:14] the the c word is energized by
[1:14:17] the spirit i believe that but we got to
[1:14:21] sew we got to take time to sow some
[1:14:22] things
[1:14:23] amen i want to sow dynamic seed in order
[1:14:26] for dynamics to come forth
[1:14:28] amen i want to get people on the
[1:14:29] expectations for dynamics now
[1:14:31] don't you be don't you be alarmed don't
[1:14:34] be alerted
[1:14:35] amen when you just walk in here in the
[1:14:36] presence of god just moving all over the
[1:14:38] people
[1:14:39] don't be alarmed what you supposed to do
[1:14:41] with that when the angel come and
[1:14:43] trouble the water your
[1:14:44] your your job right is not to sit back
[1:14:47] and and and spectate right watching who
[1:14:50] gonna get who gonna get it this time who
[1:14:52] gonna get
[1:14:52] what's gonna no no no your job is to
[1:14:54] jump in
[1:14:56] [Applause]
[1:14:58] and you want to know why those people
[1:15:00] were jumping in
[1:15:01] is because they realized they needed
[1:15:04] something
[1:15:06] whether the doctor might have had
[1:15:07] mechanics the doctor might have been
[1:15:10] giving out medicine
[1:15:11] but these people need a dynamic power of
[1:15:14] god
[1:15:15] the spirit of god to move upon the water
[1:15:18] and when the spirit moves they jumped in
[1:15:21] and they got
[1:15:22] everything they could on it and realize
[1:15:24] now
[1:15:25] the first person that jumped in
[1:15:28] was the one that got their miracle
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:32] i'm here to tell you today amen god got
[1:15:35] enough of this going around
[1:15:37] that if everybody would jump in
[1:15:40] i said if everybody would jump in
[1:15:44] everybody will receive their portion
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] whatever you need god's got it
[1:15:51] hallelujah if you need deliverance god's

[1:16:29] part of that word amen you are
[1:16:32] part of the word you know there was a
[1:16:34] quote i read recently
[1:16:36] amen where uh uh the scripture said that
[1:16:39] uh
[1:16:39] in the beginning the word was made flesh
[1:16:42] and dwelt among us but brother branham
[1:16:45] said
[1:16:46] yes the word became flesh but now the
[1:16:48] word has become
[1:16:49] your flesh
[1:16:54] i want you to think about that we can
[1:16:56] see it in christ
[1:16:58] we see the word manifesting itself in
[1:17:01] christ
[1:17:02] but you got to see the word manifesting
[1:17:06] itself in you because you are part of
[1:17:10] the same word
[1:17:11] amen amen i'm here to tell you scripture
[1:17:15] is gonna be
[1:17:16] repeated again the word will become
[1:17:18] flesh
[1:17:19] and dwell among us
[1:17:23] you're gonna be a manifestation of the
[1:17:25] word
[1:17:27] all right all right let me let me read
[1:17:29] something else to you this is not
[1:17:30] authoritarian church h
[1:17:32] now as i read this i'm letting you know
[1:17:35] this was a prophecy
[1:17:37] and uh in this prophecy by you coming
[1:17:40] into the church
[1:17:41] you're fulfilling this you that are
[1:17:43] watching online you're fulfilling this
[1:17:46] all right watch this stop starting
[1:17:48] church h
[1:17:49] the prophet amen is speaking in the
[1:17:51] section
[1:17:52] uh sentenced against the harlot past and
[1:17:55] anybody that want to study
[1:17:56] amen in the book of revelation give them
[1:17:58] a church age book
[1:18:00] it talks about the first three chapters
[1:18:02] of revelation
[1:18:03] hallelujah glory to god if you can catch
[1:18:05] them first three chapters it also takes
[1:18:07] you deep into some of the other chapters
[1:18:10] amen but give him a church age but a
[1:18:12] prophet reveals
[1:18:13] it amen here he's talking about this
[1:18:16] verse revelation
[1:18:17] chapter 2 verse 22 through 23
[1:18:20] behold i would cast her into a bed
[1:18:24] and them that commit adultery with her
[1:18:26] into great tribulation
[1:18:28] except they repent of their deeds
[1:18:32] look amen it says and i will kill her
[1:18:35] children now there's a lot here i could
[1:18:38] i could take a whole sermon and just
[1:18:39] preach about who it's her that he's
[1:18:41] talking about
[1:18:42] all right hey man this this is the
[1:18:44] church that he's talking about
[1:18:46] glory to god i mean out of the catholic
[1:18:48] church came some children
[1:18:50] that's why the catholic church is called
[1:18:51] the mother of
[1:18:53] harlots the catholic church in scripture
[1:18:57] is considered the mother of harlots
[1:18:59] that means there were children born from
[1:19:01] her
[1:19:02] other denominational churches that were
[1:19:04] born out of her
[1:19:06] glory and that's why and then eventually
[1:19:10] a man a daughter gonna find a way right
[1:19:12] back to a mama yeah
[1:19:14] amen and that that's why that's why you
[1:19:17] got all this
[1:19:18] uh the catholic church the pentecostal
[1:19:20] church the
[1:19:21] presbyterian church the baptist church
[1:19:23] all of them can agree now
[1:19:25] because the mother the daughter don't
[1:19:27] found her way back to mama
[1:19:28] oh man y'all gonna say her name again oh
[1:19:31] man
[1:19:32] i told y'all i see i'll say his name so
[1:19:34] i might as well say man uh
[1:19:36] i believe it was kenneth copeland
[1:19:39] praise the lord amen a great charismatic
[1:19:42] minister
[1:19:44] amen had an agreement going with the
[1:19:46] pope trying to bring
[1:19:48] amen the charismatic church is back
[1:19:50] underneath the pope
[1:19:51] and there was a guy that called himself
[1:19:54] amen he called himself the fulfillment
[1:19:57] of malachi 4.
[1:19:58] but the man went claiming that he died
[1:20:00] within weeks
[1:20:02] of his claim hallelujah god didn't have
[1:20:05] but one person to fulfill that
[1:20:07] his name was william marion glory to god
[1:20:11] but kenneth copeland was the one that
[1:20:12] kind of started bringing some of these
[1:20:14] things back together
[1:20:15] on the pentecostal amen our teachings
[1:20:18] he's bringing them back to the catholic
[1:20:20] church
[1:20:22] because they were harlots according to
[1:20:24] the scripture
[1:20:28] amen i hope you're getting out now i
[1:20:30] don't know what god did amongst the
[1:20:32] pentecostal churches was from god
[1:20:34] but when they went into organize or
[1:20:36] organized religion
[1:20:37] that's when they left god
[1:20:41] that's when god left him and that's why
[1:20:44] it's in the condition that it's in today
[1:20:46] hallelujah but don't worry i got
[1:20:48] something else i'm gonna just read this
[1:20:50] let me just read this let me read this
[1:20:52] it says uh and i will kill her children
[1:20:54] with death and all the churches shall
[1:20:56] know that i am he which searches the
[1:20:57] reigns and the hearts
[1:20:58] and i would give unto every one of you
[1:21:00] according to your words
[1:21:02] what this woman has children
[1:21:05] he says and she was a she a and if
[1:21:08] that
[1:21:09] is uh if that is the case that she had
[1:21:11] children by her whoredoms
[1:21:13] then she must be burnt with fire as the
[1:21:16] word has said
[1:21:18] that is exactly true that is her and and
[1:21:21] for her
[1:21:21] and for she will be and that is her and
[1:21:24] that is her end for she will burn with
[1:21:27] fire her
[1:21:28] end is the lake of fire but stop and
[1:21:31] think about these children for a moment
[1:21:34] it says a woman is the one out of whom
[1:21:36] the children come
[1:21:38] it is evident that the woman had
[1:21:39] children that came out of her
[1:21:41] but they did the same thing she did
[1:21:45] show me one church that ever came out
[1:21:48] of organization see
[1:21:51] that's the problem that the catholic
[1:21:52] church was the first one to organize
[1:21:54] and anything that came out of it goes
[1:21:56] right back into organization
[1:21:58] this message was not organized
[1:22:02] and it's still not organized today
[1:22:05] anytime
[1:22:06] the denominational spirit rises god does
[1:22:09] something to destroy it
[1:22:12] amen we don't have no headquarters here
[1:22:16] we don't have nobody we got to report to
[1:22:20] amen the only person that leads this
[1:22:22] church is the spirit of god
[1:22:24] amen glory to god i thank god we ain't
[1:22:28] got no headquarters
[1:22:30] nobody tell us what to preach nobody
[1:22:33] tell us when to preach it
[1:22:35] hallelujah somebody the holy ghost is
[1:22:39] what leaves this church
[1:22:40] and the holy ghost always wanted
[1:22:42] preeminence in the church
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:46] look at this now it says uh uh
[1:22:49] uh it's evident that the woman had
[1:22:50] children come out of her uh
[1:22:52] but they did the same thing she did show
[1:22:54] me one church that ever came out of
[1:22:55] organization
[1:22:56] that organization that didn't go right
[1:22:57] back into it there isn't one not one
[1:23:00] here's a statement the lutherans came
[1:23:03] out
[1:23:04] see luther when he went to the the
[1:23:05] catholic church store with his 95
[1:23:08] thesis and knocked on the door and said
[1:23:10] these things are against the word of god
[1:23:11] i can't stand with the catholic church
[1:23:13] no more
[1:23:14] oh i love luther i didn't even know he
[1:23:17] was a messenger
[1:23:18] but when i heard his story in school i
[1:23:21] was just
[1:23:22] just going to school when they they
[1:23:24] talked about luther something in my
[1:23:25] heart struck there's something special
[1:23:27] about that man
[1:23:28] didn't even realize he was a messenger
[1:23:31] when i came to the message
[1:23:32] saw brother branham identified him as a
[1:23:34] mess i said no wonder i identify with
[1:23:36] that fellow
[1:23:36] even in school when i didn't even know
[1:23:38] the message
[1:23:43] i said something about this fella it
[1:23:45] says when he knocked on the catholic
[1:23:46] church store say
[1:23:47] these things i just can't stand with no
[1:23:49] more the lutheran reformation began
[1:23:52] hallelujah coming against the catholic
[1:23:54] but probably problem was is they went
[1:23:56] right back underneath
[1:23:58] the organization again hallelujah what
[1:24:01] happened next he says the lutherans came
[1:24:03] out
[1:24:04] and then organized right back and today
[1:24:06] they are hand and glove with this
[1:24:07] economical move
[1:24:09] now what happened see god god was with
[1:24:11] luther but when luther went back god
[1:24:13] left
[1:24:14] luther and then god raised up somebody
[1:24:16] else the methodists
[1:24:18] right amen came out when god started
[1:24:20] dealing with the methodists you know
[1:24:22] what they did that came out
[1:24:23] they didn't stay with luther they came
[1:24:26] out
[1:24:27] praise god the methodist came out
[1:24:30] what happened they organized right back
[1:24:33] and so when when the method is organized
[1:24:35] and went back just like
[1:24:37] luther did then the pentecostals came
[1:24:40] out
[1:24:42] lest it be the name of the lord god was
[1:24:44] with the pentecostals
[1:24:47] they came out they couldn't stay with
[1:24:49] the methodists
[1:24:50] they couldn't stay with the lutheran
[1:24:51] they couldn't stay with the catholic
[1:24:53] they had to come out that's right
[1:24:56] praise god if you don't find christ you
[1:25:00] got to leave where you act
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:06] glory when mary and joseph were looking
[1:25:09] for jesus they had to leave where they
[1:25:11] were
[1:25:12] and they had to go back and find christ
[1:25:14] where he was
[1:25:15] and where we gonna find him in his words
[1:25:19] look at this the pentecostals came out
[1:25:21] here's the problem
[1:25:23] and they organized right back
[1:25:26] now we might as well be truth and honest
[1:25:28] about this it was a time where the only
[1:25:30] people you found with them white collars
[1:25:32] was catholics
[1:25:36] only ones you found within them white
[1:25:38] college was catholics
[1:25:40] that's how they identified themselves
[1:25:41] but the pentecost has now got more white
[1:25:43] collars than anybody
[1:25:45] they look just like the catholics
[1:25:48] oh we ain't gonna say it man it's the
[1:25:50] truth and it happened
[1:25:52] amen and spiritually they don't even
[1:25:54] realize what's going on
[1:25:56] they trying to carry a certain look but
[1:25:58] they don't realize what they're doing
[1:26:00] they're identifying with their with
[1:26:02] their mama
[1:26:05] um
[1:26:14] glory to god anyhow look we had a
[1:26:17] prophet that went to rome
[1:26:20] had an invitation to see the pope
[1:26:24] and when he got his invitation he said
[1:26:26] okay what do i need to do
[1:26:29] say when you go in make sure that you uh
[1:26:32] um you know you you back up don't don't
[1:26:35] turn your back on him just back away
[1:26:36] like this bow down and kiss his ring
[1:26:40] and say oh i said wait a minute i gotta
[1:26:43] do what he said yeah bow down and kiss
[1:26:44] his reading and say
[1:26:45] that's out he said can so
[1:26:52] i mean we got we had a preacher in this
[1:26:54] city that had a visit with the pope
[1:26:57] and he didn't cancel nothing he bowed
[1:27:00] down he did everything he could
[1:27:02] so he can take that picture with the
[1:27:03] pope hallelujah but we had a prophet say
[1:27:06] cancel my appointment and i'm gonna tell
[1:27:09] you i think it's some people that follow
[1:27:11] that prophet
[1:27:12] that if they had an invitation to go see
[1:27:15] the pope they would do the same thing
[1:27:17] cancel
[1:27:19] my appointment i ain't bound down to
[1:27:23] kiss
[1:27:23] no man reign oh my praise and glory
[1:27:27] gonna go to jesus
[1:27:33] he said if you want to be called
[1:27:34] reverend i call him reference he want to
[1:27:36] be called preacher i call him preacher
[1:27:38] he said but i i am not bowing down and
[1:27:40] kissing no man's ring
[1:27:43] tell him i'm canceling my appointment
[1:27:46] hallelujah thank god for a profit like
[1:27:48] that it shows
[1:27:50] us how to conduct ourselves if we find
[1:27:52] ourselves in the same situation
[1:27:58] pentecost came out and they organized
[1:28:01] right back
[1:28:02] now this was three great moves the
[1:28:04] lutheran amen the wesleyan which was
[1:28:06] which is a methodist
[1:28:08] and the pentecostals these were three
[1:28:10] very special moves that god used god
[1:28:14] did it praise the lord but when they
[1:28:17] organized god
[1:28:19] left it right now let's look at the rest
[1:28:22] of the quotes
[1:28:23] oh glory amen see this is this is this
[1:28:26] is

[1:29:54] hallelujah it represented luther who
[1:29:57] broke free from amen denominational
[1:30:00] barriers
[1:30:00] underneath the catholic church
[1:30:02] hallelujah buddy went and laid

[1:30:29] the philistines be upon you and this
[1:30:32] time he broke he rolls up he rose up
[1:30:35] and he broke free that represented
[1:30:37] wesley breaking free

[1:30:42] but wesley organized and laid right back
[1:30:45] down
[1:30:46] in delilah's lap again hallelujah
[1:30:49] now this time it got a little closer
[1:30:52] this time he says uh she said now you
[1:30:55] don't lie to me two times
[1:30:57] tell me where your great strength lies
[1:30:59] sampson she said
[1:31:00] if you weave the seven locks
[1:31:03] of my head with the web then i'll be
[1:31:07] just like any other man
[1:31:09] hallelujah glory to god and this time it
[1:31:12] looks
[1:31:12] it look i mean he was getting real close
[1:31:14] to where his strength was
[1:31:16] i want to tell you something amen the
[1:31:18] church was getting real close
[1:31:20] amen to where god amen wanted them to be
[1:31:23] hallelujah but this time amen when he
[1:31:25] laid down she said samson
[1:31:27] the philistines being he rose up and
[1:31:30] broke three brother branham say that
[1:31:31] represented
[1:31:32] the pentecostal church
[1:31:39] now the fourth time he goes and lays in
[1:31:41] our lap
[1:31:42] and when he lays on the lap this time he
[1:31:45] said he finally
[1:31:46] gave up the secret if you cut my hair it
[1:31:49] may not be just like any other man and
[1:31:51] this time she cut the hair
[1:31:52] and he and he's laying down and laughing

[1:31:59] hallelujah
[1:32:00] samson the philistines are pointing she
[1:32:02] said she said she
[1:32:04] he tried to rise up this time and break
[1:32:06] free but he had no strength
[1:32:08] that's where the church is now the
[1:32:10] church has no strength to break free
[1:32:11] from the things that they found
[1:32:12] themselves in
[1:32:15] but i'm so glad it didn't stop there god
[1:32:18] used the lutheran church god used the
[1:32:21] methodist church
[1:32:22] god used the pentecostal church but all
[1:32:24] of them went back into
[1:32:25] amen denominations denominationalism
[1:32:27] organization
[1:32:28] and that's why they lost their strength
[1:32:31] but let's look at this quote let's look
[1:32:32] at this quote let's look at this quote
[1:32:35] glory glory glory glory glory
[1:32:38] amen the lutherans came out
[1:32:42] amen and and then organized right back
[1:32:44] and today
[1:32:45] they are hand in glove with this
[1:32:47] ecumenical move
[1:32:48] the methodist came out and they
[1:32:49] organized right back the pentecostals
[1:32:52] came out and they
[1:32:52] organized right back but look at this
[1:32:55] there is going to be another coming out

[1:36:30] four messengers of dog must kill the
[1:36:33] tree
[1:36:34] but all but the roots it killed the tree
[1:36:37] but it left the roots
[1:36:39] that's that's good right there amen
[1:36:41] because if it left the roots and that's
[1:36:43] an
[1:36:43] opportunity for the tree to sprout again
[1:36:48] and that's why the devil couldn't take
[1:36:50] you out he took this and he took
[1:36:52] that but he could not take the roots
[1:36:57] the roots remain planted church
[1:37:00] and at the scent of water the roots will
[1:37:03] sprout again
[1:37:08] it says if four messengers of death kill
[1:37:10] the tree four messengers of the life
[1:37:11] restores the tree
[1:37:13] do you get it he says amen for god said
[1:37:16] i'll restore it
[1:37:17] he's going to restore how by four deaths
[1:37:20] five by four death messages killed it
[1:37:23] therefore
[1:37:23] life messengers will restore what was
[1:37:26] the first
[1:37:27] life messenger what was the first martin
[1:37:29] luther
[1:37:30] amen with justification what was the
[1:37:32] second john wesley
[1:37:34] amen by sanctification glory to god what
[1:37:37] was the third
[1:37:39] pentecost with the restoration of the
[1:37:43] gifts
[1:37:46] let me go a little further but it didn't
[1:37:48] stop there
[1:37:49] glory to god there was four life
[1:37:51] messengers pentecost was the third one
[1:37:54] but not the fourth one hallelujah
[1:37:57] amen glory to god deliverance is is in
[1:38:00] the number four
[1:38:01] right watch this it says pentecost with
[1:38:03] the restoration of the gifts
[1:38:05] the holy ghost baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:08] what was the fourth
[1:38:09] oh hallelujah this is what we're talking
[1:38:13] about
[1:38:13] the not just of the gifts of the spirit
[1:38:17] floor
[1:38:18] but the word with the gifts
[1:38:21] what happened is that the church took
[1:38:23] the gifts but fight forgot the giver
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:27] but what we want is to give up with the
[1:38:29] gifts
[1:38:31] amen what was the fourth the word what
[1:38:34] the word
[1:38:35] the there were four great prophets
[1:38:38] now now who brought the word back to us
[1:38:40] that's what that's why
[1:38:41] malachi 4 is so important because the
[1:38:44] bible says that he will turn our hearts
[1:38:46] to the children back to the faith of the
[1:38:48] fathers
[1:38:49] so his of our hearts turning back to the
[1:38:51] faith of the father simply means
[1:38:53] our hearts will turn back to the word
[1:38:56] the church has
[1:38:57] left the word the church does a lot of
[1:39:00] things in their feelings
[1:39:01] the church does a lot of things in their
[1:39:03] emotions a lot of things in their own
[1:39:05] thinking but what we need to go
[1:39:06] go back and do and see what the word
[1:39:08] says about it
[1:39:10] our hearts have come back to the words
[1:39:13] now i want to be i want to be very very
[1:39:15] um a man specific here we're not
[1:39:18] we don't want to be a church that's just
[1:39:20] built solidly on mechanics mechanics
[1:39:22] mechanics mechanics
[1:39:24] we must have dynamic power of god
[1:39:27] we must have the dynamic power of god
[1:39:30] now what does this
[1:39:31] energize the c word be energized by the
[1:39:34] spirit
[1:39:34] i gave you this last week energized is
[1:39:37] is an action word
[1:39:38] amen it's a verb it's an action word
[1:39:40] it's amen

[1:39:44] it's it's live enough it's animate
[1:39:48] praise god it's vitalize invigorate
[1:39:52] amen energized means to perk up
[1:39:55] and energize mean to excite

[1:40:33] see energy is contagious
[1:40:36] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:40:39] we we love to see the presence of god
[1:40:42] come upon the people of god
[1:40:44] it brings that energy into the church
[1:40:47] i want to tell you another thing that
[1:40:48] brings energy into the church when new
[1:40:50] faces show up
[1:40:54] when new faces show up it brings an
[1:40:56] energy into the church
[1:40:58] hallelujah but the greatest thing that
[1:41:01] can give us
[1:41:01] energy is when the holy ghost himself
[1:41:04] pours
[1:41:04] out inside the church
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:08] see we need to be invigorated we need to

[1:41:50] he says we need we need to get the
[1:41:52] church stirred up
[1:41:53] hallelujah we need to get the church
[1:41:55] fired up
[1:41:57] glory to god we need to get the church
[1:41:58] to move we need the church to drive
[1:42:03] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:06] how can the church drive how can the
[1:42:09] church drive
[1:42:10] i think about this story amen in
[1:42:13] scripture
[1:42:14] where um disciples were with jesus
[1:42:17] and there was a man amen that had his
[1:42:20] son that was
[1:42:21] that was uh you know this this young boy
[1:42:24] was bound
[1:42:25] glory to god and he had a dumb spirit
[1:42:28] amen his father confessed that my boy
[1:42:30] has a dumb spirit he said i brought him
[1:42:31] to the disciples
[1:42:33] and i tried to get them to to lay hands
[1:42:35] on him but they couldn't get
[1:42:36] nothing done they couldn't get it done
[1:42:38] it says uh jesus i want to bring my boy
[1:42:40] to you
[1:42:41] if if if if you got any compassion would
[1:42:44] you just please touch
[1:42:45] my boy and have have mercy on us and
[1:42:48] jesus told a man say now
[1:42:49] if you can believe all things are
[1:42:52] possible to you
[1:42:54] if you believe now jesus already knew
[1:42:57] what he could do but he said
[1:42:59] all things are possible to you if you
[1:43:01] believe
[1:43:04] man confess and say lord i believe but
[1:43:07] help my unbelief
[1:43:08] amen oh hallelujah lord i believe but
[1:43:11] help my belief and i believe that's the
[1:43:13] that's that's the the place where most
[1:43:15] of us are lord we believe these promises
[1:43:18] god we know what your prophet said is
[1:43:19] yeah and amen but help
[1:43:21] our unbelief what's stopping this thing
[1:43:25] up
[1:43:26] jesus brother said bring the boy here to
[1:43:28] me and as he brought said he said
[1:43:30] he prayed for the boy they said he said
[1:43:32] our death and dumb spirit
[1:43:34] leave this boy and never come back to
[1:43:36] him again now see any sickness that's
[1:43:38] attacking your body is a spirit
[1:43:43] see the church needs to be driving the
[1:43:46] church need to be in control
[1:43:48] amen the church need to get out of the
[1:43:50] amen the the the
[1:43:52] passenger seat the church needs to start
[1:43:54] driving
[1:43:56] jesus said i go away but but i'm sending
[1:43:59] my comforter to you
[1:44:00] he's saying he's saying the works that i
[1:44:02] did shall ye do
[1:44:04] also he says and greater works than
[1:44:06] these shall you do
[1:44:08] for i go unto my father the church needs
[1:44:10] to start
[1:44:11] driving can i tell you take your
[1:44:14] driver's license test
[1:44:17] go out there and get your certificate so
[1:44:19] you can start
[1:44:20] driving devil's eye
[1:44:25] hallelujah it was
[1:44:28] it was the disciples responsibility to
[1:44:30] take care of that
[1:44:31] because they approached it the wrong way
[1:44:33] is why they did not get results
[1:44:36] if we could ever get our focus right
[1:44:38] church i believe god gonna do some
[1:44:39] things here
[1:44:41] that we never thought the church needs
[1:44:43] to be driving with there's so many
[1:44:45] so many calls of sickness so many
[1:44:48] so many uh uh people coming to us i got
[1:44:51] this problem i got that problem
[1:44:52] and sometimes all we do is just bring it
[1:44:54] and make it a prayer request
[1:44:56] and when it becomes a a common thing
[1:44:59] that we do we pray over all the prayer
[1:45:01] requests
[1:45:03] is that all we want to do is just pray
[1:45:04] over him
[1:45:06] or do we want to see god manifest
[1:45:08] himself
[1:45:10] we ought to be expecting god to answer
[1:45:12] the prayer
[1:45:14] if we ask anything in his name
[1:45:17] amen amen it says he's going to do it if
[1:45:20] we ask
[1:45:21] anything in his name so it don't matter
[1:45:22] what the condition is if we come
[1:45:24] according to the word of god we ought to
[1:45:26] see
[1:45:26] dynamic structure mechanics i'm trying
[1:45:30] i want to sow these i want you to be in
[1:45:32] power church

[1:45:35] brought into your life hey man they're
[1:45:36] saying the person's sick they asking you
[1:45:38] to pray for
[1:45:38] yeah well i'm gonna tell my church no
[1:45:41] you stop and pray
[1:45:45] and watch god answer your prayer and
[1:45:47] then come back to church and share the
[1:45:49] testimony
[1:45:50] when you share the testimony you know
[1:45:52] what happens the church is energized

[1:53:05] the holy ghost he was on the phone
[1:53:07] talking about the words amen as he was
[1:53:09] talking about the word at home
[1:53:11] the power of god came into the room
[1:53:14] where he was
[1:53:15] and he was out for hours don't even
[1:53:16] realize when he when he stopped talking
[1:53:19] that's what i'm talking about the power
[1:53:21] of god moving like that
[1:53:23] [Applause]
[1:53:24] amen just enough holy ghost to try to
[1:53:28] satisfy the pastor
[1:53:30] oh but ain't what we talking about here
[1:53:32] we got to talk about the holy ghost to
[1:53:34] satisfy
[1:53:34] anybody the only reason we speak in
[1:53:37] tongues is try to
[1:53:38] try to try to imitate what somebody else
[1:53:41] is doing
[1:53:42] if god ain't giving you that gift find
[1:53:44] something else that he can give you
[1:53:46] to work with but we're not here to
[1:53:48] imitate
[1:53:49] nobody we're here to be who god has made
[1:53:53] us to be to step
[1:53:54] into the vision that he has for our life
[1:53:58] but i'm talking about a real holy ghost
[1:54:01] a holy ghost that can tell you
[1:54:02] no the holy ghost had to give you a
[1:54:06] check no you shouldn't be doing this
[1:54:09] no you shouldn't go there with this
[1:54:11] person
[1:54:12] the holy ghost had a taste and no that
[1:54:14] ain't no uh don't say that
[1:54:17] the holy ghost said go back and
[1:54:18] apologize
[1:54:20] i'm talking about a real holy ghost not
[1:54:23] one that step over this and step over
[1:54:25] that go back and apologize
[1:54:27] make that thing right
[1:54:30] [Applause]
[1:54:32] i'm talking about the holy ghost there
[1:54:33] to get all the sin out because when you
[1:54:35] bring
[1:54:36] sin into the camp you stop the revival
[1:54:40] your misbehavior amen will stop the
[1:54:43] revival from blowing in this church
[1:54:46] i want to i'm trying to get all the
[1:54:48] weeds out praise god lord help me get
[1:54:51] all the weeds out
[1:54:53] because we want the real holy ghost to
[1:54:56] flow through the church
[1:54:58] we want everybody to be filled the same
[1:55:01] way it was on the day of pentecost
[1:55:04] 120 souls everybody was filled with the
[1:55:07] holy ghost
[1:55:11] we want the real thing we want the real
[1:55:13] dynamics
[1:55:15] i i there was a time amen i i'm
[1:55:18] let me just stress a little bit just a
[1:55:20] little bit i'ma get back to this quote
[1:55:23] but there was a time i remember taking
[1:55:25] some of the young people to some of the
[1:55:26] meetings
[1:55:28] amen and and and we went to a meeting up
[1:55:30] in in south carolina
[1:55:32] holy spirit was moving in that place
[1:55:35] such a way
[1:55:36] the one young man fell out under the
[1:55:39] power of god now you can tell when it's
[1:55:40] the power of god and when it's flesh
[1:55:43] when it's flesh people get hurt i'm
[1:55:46] talking about physically
[1:55:48] hurt amen but this brother fell out
[1:55:51] underneath the power of god
[1:55:53] and start rolling on the floor just
[1:55:55] rolling back and forth
[1:55:57] and as he was rolling the chairs was
[1:55:59] moving by themselves
[1:56:02] chairs just moving by themselves getting
[1:56:04] out the way so he didn't get hurt
[1:56:11] the holy spirit was moving so so so
[1:56:13] mightily
[1:56:14] you know god came down and and brother
[1:56:16] caleb had
[1:56:17] he he still has a gift
[1:56:22] i want to know why because god gave him
[1:56:24] the giving god
[1:56:26] well
[1:56:30] don't give a gift and take it back god
[1:56:33] don't do things like that
[1:56:35] but gifts and columns are without
[1:56:36] repentance
[1:56:39] but underneath the anointing brother
[1:56:41] caleb began to go and just
[1:56:42] speak different things to different
[1:56:44] people yeah
[1:56:45] i mean things that only they knew and
[1:56:48] god knew was in their heart
[1:56:50] he was speaking right out i mean
[1:56:52] underneath the power of the holy ghost
[1:56:54] it was happening now see what the devil
[1:56:58] has done is tried to kind of uh put
[1:57:00] water on all this
[1:57:01] yeah yeah the devil tried to snuff it
[1:57:04] out
[1:57:05] but satan as you put water on it you
[1:57:07] don't realize
[1:57:08] it's seeds underneath all this
[1:57:13] and when you put water on
[1:57:16] seeds
[1:57:19] you understand satan didn't realize he
[1:57:23] thought he was putting the fire out
[1:57:25] but underneath all that was seeds
[1:57:28] and when you put water on seed water
[1:57:31] causes the seed
[1:57:32] to sprout up watercolors to seed to be
[1:57:36] energized
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:42] see i'm putting stress on it i know what
[1:57:44] god already has in the church
[1:57:46] and i know why the devil fight what god
[1:57:48] got in the church
[1:57:49] but like i said at the beginning when
[1:57:51] you're part of a vision
[1:57:53] ain't nothing you can do to get out the
[1:57:55] vision
[1:57:56] you can't go nowhere you can't you can't
[1:57:59] try to hide
[1:58:00] amen if god is ordained for you to be
[1:58:03] part of the vision
[1:58:05] you're going to be part of the vision
[1:58:07] amen
[1:58:08] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:58:11] i remember services here amen we we had
[1:58:15] uh back in the old church we had a
[1:58:18] service one time
[1:58:19] and uh the power of god come down just
[1:58:22] on the words
[1:58:23] see we don't have to make this happen we
[1:58:25] don't have to work this up

[1:58:29] real thing you go if you've never seen
[1:58:30] it you're gonna see it here
[1:58:32] because if the word has been sown right
[1:58:35] yes
[1:58:35] the seed word will be energized
[1:58:40] by the spirit we're just preaching the
[1:58:42] word and

[1:58:45] out amen in the service and

[2:01:39] nothing that was normal for them they
[2:01:42] were in the presence of men
[2:01:44] and that's what they did all the time it
[2:01:45] was very very normal for them so here
[2:01:50] they come to the service like this

[2:01:54] out over the audience and different
[2:01:55] things
[2:01:56] different healings and everything taking
[2:01:58] place and as the holy spirit began to
[2:01:59] move over the audience

[2:07:07] digging out and some pulling some weeds
[2:07:09] out we got to
[2:07:10] we got to get ready for what god getting
[2:07:11] ready to do the uh
[2:07:13] the i remember in in the scripture
[2:07:17] where uh they went to the prophet elijah
[2:07:20] they said you know uh we we elijah they
[2:07:22] went they like she said look we
[2:07:24] we in this battle we don't and they got
[2:07:26] to a situation where
[2:07:27] they they shouldn't even been there here
[2:07:28] they don't took a seven days journey
[2:07:30] with a compass and can't find no water
[2:07:32] how about they going to fight a battle
[2:07:35] no water for that for themselves no
[2:07:36] water for the men the water for
[2:07:38] uh for the animals no water nowhere how
[2:07:40] are they going to fight about it they
[2:07:41] would die of a thirst out there
[2:07:44] so they say they found said we got to go
[2:07:46] get the prophet we got to go to the
[2:07:47] prophet
[2:07:47] now i'm going to tell you something when
[2:07:49] the church needs to realize they die on
[2:07:50] a thirst
[2:07:53] the church is dying a thirst seven day
[2:07:56] journey ain't got
[2:07:57] nothing right we need to go back and see
[2:08:00] what a prophet got to say
[2:08:03] it went and said say elisha we need you
[2:08:06] please get a word from the lord from
[2:08:08] us he say look you know what if it
[2:08:09] wasn't for jehoshaphat being with y'all
[2:08:11] i wouldn't even come out here and try to
[2:08:12] prophesy
[2:08:14] he said but get me a a minstrel give me
[2:08:16] somebody can get me in the spirit
[2:08:19] give me somebody that can that can play
[2:08:20] some anointed music
[2:08:22] all right don't just bring anybody get
[2:08:24] an anointed musician
[2:08:26] bring them here let them start playing
[2:08:28] and as they start playing now i can feel
[2:08:30] the spirit of god coming upon me
[2:08:33] it says now y'all y'all get ready it's
[2:08:35] not gonna be
[2:08:36] any rain right it's not gonna be it's
[2:08:39] not gonna be that he say but there's
[2:08:40] gonna be water in this desert
[2:08:42] he's saying the way that you need to get
[2:08:44] ready for the water is start digging
[2:08:46] ditches
[2:08:47] praise god amen you're gonna have to
[2:08:51] start making preparation for your
[2:08:53] manifestation
[2:08:54] glory and maybe it's time for you to
[2:08:56] start digging some ditches
[2:08:58] maybe it's time for you to bury some
[2:09:00] stuff
[2:09:01] praise god amen but it's time to get
[2:09:04] ready for the manifestation of dynamics
[2:09:06] start digging ditches
[2:09:11] and and the deeper you dig the more
[2:09:14] water you'll get
[2:09:22] the more water you'll get the more
[2:09:24] ditches you did
[2:09:26] the more water you get
[2:09:30] start digging them ditches next morning
[2:09:33] they woke up and didn't know how it came
[2:09:36] there was water all over the place water
[2:09:39] all over the place and god provided a
[2:09:41] miracle they needed
[2:09:42] dynamic power of god in order
[2:09:46] to get that water we gonna need the
[2:09:48] dynamic power of god
[2:09:50] in order to sustain in this hour
[2:09:53] the mechanics don't run the church
[2:09:56] the dynamic power of god does but i'm
[2:09:59] not just talk about something just make
[2:10:01] you
[2:10:02] shout for a little bit that's what we
[2:10:05] talked about last week them seeds
[2:10:06] falling in certain
[2:10:07] certain atmospheres it caused you to
[2:10:09] shout but brother if it ain't if it
[2:10:10] ain't taking root
[2:10:13] it'll never bring forth and you're gonna
[2:10:16] have to bring forth impatience
[2:10:21] i'm gonna tell you right now god is the
[2:10:22] god ain't no magician
[2:10:24] god ain't doing things like that what
[2:10:26] god's trying to do is work character in
[2:10:28] you
[2:10:30] so some things you have to do right now
[2:10:32] and then wait for your miracle
[2:10:36] let me just finish these a couple of
[2:10:38] these quotes and i'll
[2:10:40] i'll close for the day that looking
[2:10:42] under jesus
[2:10:43] the mechanics don't run the church it's
[2:10:46] the dynamics
[2:10:47] the holy ghost that gets into this word
[2:10:49] it's not a seminary that teaches you all
[2:10:51] the theology
[2:10:52] and the greek interpretations but it's
[2:10:54] the dynamics of the holy ghost and there
[2:10:56] to set that a fire and to bring it to
[2:10:58] pass and to make it live
[2:11:00] just exactly what the promised word is
[2:11:02] for this
[2:11:03] hour not the mechanics the dynamics it
[2:11:06] takes
[2:11:07] mechanics and dynamics the word and the
[2:11:09] spirit they are
[2:11:10] the one that gives life all right
[2:11:14] um oh jesus
[2:11:20] jehovah jireh
[2:11:24] the prophet says this now the vine
[2:11:26] doesn't bear fruit
[2:11:28] does it who was he talking to
[2:11:31] says the church i'm the vine you are
[2:11:34] the branches the branch is energized
[2:11:38] by the life of the vine therefore jesus
[2:11:42] has no lips tonight on earth but mine
[2:11:44] and yours
[2:11:45] he has no eyes but mine and yours
[2:11:48] he has no hands but mine and yours he
[2:11:51] energizes us and we bring forth his life
[2:11:54] as he brings it through us whether it's
[2:11:57] preaching the gospel by lip
[2:11:58] or it's seeing vision by eye whether
[2:12:01] it's whatever it is
[2:12:02] laying hands on the sick whatever it is
[2:12:04] it's christ working through the branches
[2:12:07] of his church
[2:12:08] every office literally electrified
[2:12:12] by his presence i like that i say every
[2:12:15] office
[2:12:17] if you if your office is uh
[2:12:21] lay member still lay member needs to be
[2:12:25] electric
[2:12:28] preachers electrify deacon
[2:12:32] electrify song leader electrify
[2:12:36] musicians electrified
[2:12:42] bro joe don't stop saying amen
[2:12:50] last week brother joseph coming here he
[2:12:51] was electrifying
[2:12:54] every week you got to come with that
[2:12:56] same fire brother joseph everybody don't
[2:12:58] let the devil take your fire
[2:13:00] uh yeah i say i'm preaching long he said
[2:13:02] preach as long as you want to
[2:13:04] amen brother joseph you don't know what
[2:13:06] that does for a preacher
[2:13:09] one day he'll experience it
[2:13:17] praise the lord amen
[2:13:20] uh every office literally electrified by
[2:13:24] his presence
[2:13:25] isn't it wonderful how how how we are
[2:13:28] now either told the truth or a lie if i
[2:13:31] told a lie god would never have nothing
[2:13:32] to do with a lie
[2:13:33] you know that if i told the truth god is
[2:13:36] obligated amen
[2:13:42] amen
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:53] now it's not me working it up i ain't
[2:13:55] gonna do nothing
[2:13:56] but just lay the seeds in there and as i
[2:13:59] lay the seed i know what to expect
[2:14:01] dynamics to the mechanics
[2:14:05] one last question what shall i do
[2:14:09] with jesus call christ church i'm on the
[2:14:13] expectation
[2:14:15] and i'm telling you i said it's it's
[2:14:18] good for you to
[2:14:20] uh prepare yourself by listening to the
[2:14:22] mechanics or read the mechanics when
[2:14:23] you're at home
[2:14:25] so when we come together that we can
[2:14:27] expect god to do something
[2:14:30] hallelujah glory to god we we we're
[2:14:33] facing a a a society where people need
[2:14:35] to see
[2:14:36] god this just this this this corona
[2:14:40] demon just came out came from the pits
[2:14:43] of hell
[2:14:44] that's a major attack people don't know
[2:14:47] what to do
[2:14:48] people afraid now they talk about
[2:14:49] forcing people to take um
[2:14:53] i mean we don't we you know we don't
[2:14:57] know what we what we're in for
[2:14:58] we we have no idea we need to be
[2:15:00] protected by almighty god
[2:15:04] and you need to know that you can you
[2:15:05] can get see some dynamics in your life
[2:15:08] praise god stand like them hebrew boys
[2:15:11] if god don't deliver
[2:15:13] [Music]
[2:15:15] [Applause]
[2:15:18] my confidence is that he's able to do it
[2:15:21] now if he don't choose to do it through
[2:15:23] me
[2:15:24] or to me he's still able to do it and
[2:15:26] since i know he's able now you realize
[2:15:29] that
[2:15:29] they were standing on his able yeah
[2:15:42] or he has but he's able
[2:15:45] can you stand on he's able
[2:15:49] [Applause]
[2:15:57] standing on he's able i know what he's
[2:15:59] able to do
[2:16:00] if he choose not to do it that's okay
[2:16:02] somebody else gonna see the dynamics
[2:16:05] but i know he's able to do dynamic
[2:16:06] things for me
[2:16:08] man he need to fire up seven times
[2:16:10] hotter that's fine they
[2:16:11] ain't gonna make me change my mind
[2:16:17] tied all up running into a fire
[2:16:20] and when they got in there somehow the
[2:16:23] fire
[2:16:23] loosed them and they just in there
[2:16:24] praising and jumping and shouting
[2:16:26] and nebuchadnezzar's like what in the
[2:16:28] world i'm happy now wait a minute wait a
[2:16:29] minute i know i
[2:16:32] i know i you know i i can count
[2:16:35] i put three men in but i see four
[2:16:40] and the fourth one look like
[2:16:44] the son of god can i put it this way the
[2:16:47] fourth one
[2:16:47] look like the dynamics
[2:16:53] that's what we're looking for church
[2:16:58] what shall i do with jesus call christ
[2:16:59] this is the last one the dynamics
[2:17:02] of this church
[2:17:08] i told you it's prophecy
[2:17:12] the dynamics of this church
[2:17:16] will be a refilling
[2:17:20] of the holy spirit and many of us
[2:17:23] need refillings now it's not not that we
[2:17:27] haven't been
[2:17:28] filled yes we have been filled but our
[2:17:31] experience has dried up
[2:17:33] we need a refilling of the holy ghost
[2:17:36] and the dynamics of this church
[2:17:40] will be a refilling
[2:17:43] of the holy spirit now we have worked in
[2:17:46] a small
[2:17:47] measure while the headstone is coming
[2:17:49] down to unite with the body
[2:17:51] but when the head and body unites unites
[2:17:53] together the full power of the holy
[2:17:56] ghost
[2:17:56] would raise up just exactly like that
[2:18:00] even in the dead say that again
[2:18:04] even the dead that's dead in christ
[2:18:08] for hundreds of years ago we'll rise in
[2:18:11] the beauty of his holiness
[2:18:12] and take a flight to the skies the
[2:18:15] dynamics
[2:18:16] is the holy spirit
[2:18:28] god knows the seeds have been planted
[2:18:31] i believe this is the season for it
[2:18:35] i'm under expectation in church i'm
[2:18:38] encouraging you
[2:18:40] look for god to do just exceeding the
[2:18:43] abundant above all you can ask or think
[2:18:46] i'm talking about a holy ghost that make
[2:18:48] you jump every sunday
[2:18:53] i'm talking about the holy ghost and
[2:18:54] make you say amen to the word every week
[2:19:02] see that that's how you water the seeds
[2:19:04] with your a amens
[2:19:06] and see if you listen to the word at
[2:19:08] home if you read the word at home when
[2:19:10] it comes back across the pulpit you can
[2:19:12] say man
[2:19:14] that's god speaking back to you you
[2:19:17] asked to hear god's voice
[2:19:18] and and he just wants a response

[2:19:28] you hear me
[2:19:30] say something you want to make sure that
[2:19:33] they hear you say something to me if you

[2:19:38] speaking to you say something
[2:19:42] don't just be nod now oh no
[2:19:45] say something to him amen

[2:20:01] you need god to do something for you
[2:20:05] hallelujah
[2:20:06] [Applause]
[2:20:12] we need god to speak back

[2:20:53] the right way
[2:20:55] amen hallelujah you might as well get
[2:20:58] ready
[2:20:59] i've read the prophecy the dynamics of
[2:21:02] this church will be
[2:21:04] will be you gonna get your refilling
[2:21:08] if you ain't been filled you're gonna be
[2:21:09] filled but you're going to get a refill

[2:21:20] service anytime we come together we're
[2:21:22] on the expectation

[2:22:04] the spirit on the piano
[2:22:08] well the holy spirit wants the music to
[2:22:11] keep going
[2:22:12] so the holy ghost kept playing the piano
[2:22:16] [Music]

[2:22:57] the holy ghost to take over the service

[2:26:20] are things that you promised
[2:26:23] and lord i just trust oh god that as the
[2:26:26] promises have been
[2:26:28] relayed to the people that you will
[2:26:29] bring it to pass
[2:26:32] help us to see lord this the way that
[2:26:35] you have moved
[2:26:36] lord throughout the ages
[2:26:39] how you started with the church on the
[2:26:41] day of pentecost but how they they
[2:26:42] organized the catholic church comes some
[2:26:45] years after they started the first
[2:26:47] organized
[2:26:48] church and it calls lord the beginning
[2:26:51] of denominations that's when you began
[2:26:52] to leave
[2:26:54] luther rose up one day and realized that
[2:26:56] no this is not writing
[2:26:57] nailed this 95 thesis to the church door
[2:27:00] and he stepped out by faith he came out
[2:27:04] god but he eventually the people that
[2:27:07] followed luther went right back
[2:27:09] into denomination systems again
[2:27:11] organized and that's when you left and
[2:27:13] then met
[2:27:13] the methodist with john wesley rose up
[2:27:16] again and said no no no no no
[2:27:17] there's there's there's great there's a
[2:27:19] greater work sanctification
[2:27:22] father they began to to live and declare
[2:27:25] that gospel
[2:27:26] lord the day after wesley died many went
[2:27:29] right back into organization again and
[2:27:31] you left him father
[2:27:32] but lord the pentecostals were looking
[2:27:35] for the restoration of the gifts they
[2:27:36] were praying for it
[2:27:38] father you moved by your spirit
[2:27:42] 1906 god a tremendous move of the spirit
[2:27:46] there in the southern street
[2:27:48] god and and and and the gifts broke
[2:27:50] forth
[2:27:51] the anointing broke forth but father
[2:27:55] after many of the leaders
[2:27:56] died the people went right back into
[2:27:59] denominationalism again
[2:28:00] organization and the spirit of god left
[2:28:03] it but father you promised that there
[2:28:04] would be another coming out again
[2:28:07] this is where we are
[2:28:08] [Music]

[2:35:41] amen you know
[2:35:47] ministers we also like to hear a good
[2:35:50] message
[2:35:52] amen amen and you know there's so many
[2:35:56] things that were said uh
[2:35:59] today that's
[2:36:02] it's been been on my heart for for quite
[2:36:05] a while
[2:36:06] and uh let me just i just want to
[2:36:11] kind of prove it to you a little bit
[2:36:14] this was a
[2:36:15] you heard this uh
[2:36:18] today during the service
[2:36:22] and the lord had had me prepared this uh
[2:36:27] back in 1993 and i
[2:36:31] had to wait until today to hear it
[2:36:36] just kind of let you know that there
[2:36:39] might be
[2:36:44] but a jacket myself are two separate
[2:36:47] individuals but there's still one spirit
[2:36:50] working within us
[2:36:52] amen and so the holy spirit said today
[2:36:57] there are four
[2:37:01] for for death angel i mean dead
[2:37:03] messengers is that right
[2:37:05] that killed the tree amen i mean the
[2:37:07] whole thing is right here
[2:37:08] all right you know so when you when
[2:37:12] it was red amen i was saying i said oh
[2:37:14] my god
[2:37:15] i'm in the right place today amen
[2:37:19] and to let you know that even though
[2:37:22] that these the the locus and the the the
[2:37:25] palmer woman the cankerworm you know i'm
[2:37:27] now i'm paraphrasing
[2:37:28] trying to you know not to prolong it
[2:37:32] let you know that even though the
[2:37:35] killing
[2:37:36] brought it right down to the roof
[2:37:38] there's still a restoration
[2:37:41] it's a restoration and
[2:37:44] you know and so but in that restoration
[2:37:48] he was saying he said that
[2:37:52] uh he said that one day
[2:37:56] that you would begin to see yourself
[2:38:01] saying that you say you may not
[2:38:03] recognize
[2:38:05] well let me let me just let me just read
[2:38:07] it it's recognizing your day
[2:38:09] and his message say listen his word
[2:38:12] which he is
[2:38:13] has begun to be risen his word that is
[2:38:16] down
[2:38:17] uh through the aids of luther and wesley
[2:38:20] you know see
[2:38:21] it has begun to raise up in power
[2:38:24] talk about dynamics now is that right
[2:38:27] then it begins to move
[2:38:29] then move a little more amen is coming
[2:38:32] into what
[2:38:33] identification amen
[2:38:37] you say you might not you say you you
[2:38:40] might find yourself identified here
[2:38:43] in the world as a believer one of these
[2:38:46] days
[2:38:47] you all you you may not know him but you
[2:38:50] may come to know
[2:38:51] yourself like the prodigal son did
[2:38:54] and find yourself amen
[2:38:58] identified in the scriptures
[2:39:02] amen so what he's what malachi 4 was
[2:39:05] saying
[2:39:06] amen that you're the sign of the
[2:39:08] resurrection
[2:39:10] amen there's the same god yesterday
[2:39:13] in malachi 4 we'd have to be the same
[2:39:15] god to you
[2:39:16] today is that right maybe because
[2:39:20] because what we're looking for is like
[2:39:21] you said is the dynamics
[2:39:24] is that right but the thing about it is
[2:39:26] this
[2:39:27] amen oh hallelujah
[2:39:30] oh my see sometimes
[2:39:33] you gotta understand that your soul
[2:39:38] amen is connected to god
[2:39:41] a matter of fact it is a part of god
[2:39:45] but it's buried in your subconscious
[2:39:48] amen
[2:39:49] but one day now when the holy ghost
[2:39:53] says one thing to ask for the holy ghost
[2:39:57] and the holy ghost could come on your
[2:39:59] flesh you don't want that
[2:40:01] the holy ghost come in your spirit you
[2:40:04] still don't want that
[2:40:05] you want the holy ghost to come in your
[2:40:08] soul
[2:40:09] it energizes the soul and what it does
[2:40:13] it bro
[2:40:13] it brings up the contents of your soul
[2:40:16] to your
[2:40:17] to your conscious mind and that's when
[2:40:20] the mind of christ entered into you
[2:40:22] to know what he was done with the world
[2:40:24] amen that's when you step
[2:40:26] into the vision and then you begin to
[2:40:28] make his thoughts
[2:40:30] manifest the thoughts that he had a bit
[2:40:32] of you
[2:40:33] before the foundation of the world and
[2:40:36] i'm going to prove it to you a little
[2:40:37] while ago
