found was blind but now [Music] see amen God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord another day I know a lot of us are very very tired and uh the week's been long but it's always good to hear a word from the Lord and I find that um when I was a younger guy I used to complain about coming to church on Wednesdays and then as I began to grow in Christ I began to find out that God actually answers your questions on times you may not expect it so when you're missing church on Wednesday you might be missing your answer so I've learned to be thankful uh that I'm able who attend church on Wednesday and on any other day so so we are going to get straight into the message um uh if we stand up for the reading of the word uh everyone can turn to Genesis uh 126 and we're going to read verses 126 through 127 all right and it reads and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and of the over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen uh let us bow our heads in word of prayer Lord Jesus Christ we come before for you Lord God we thank you oh lord for another another opportunity oh Lord to come before your throne oh Lord God to receive from you oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we know Lord God that our sacrifices are not in vain oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord the Angels there are angels right there before your throne oh Lord God crying holy holy holy holy oh Lord God every second every minute every hour oh Lord God without fail oh Lord Jesus Christ so we know for a fact oh Lord God how much more is our sacrifice oh Lord God for you didn't create us to be Angels oh Lord God to worship to worship you like that but you created us to be Sons and Daughters to have a relationship with you oh Lord God meaning that Lord Jesus Christ oh God when we call upon your name oh Lord God there's an action that follows oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord in the beginning oh Lord God the relationship that you had with Adam oh Lord God he would speak the word oh Lord God and you would agree with it oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you're trying to restore us oh Lord back to that position oh Lord God through the end time messenger that you brought to us oh Lord God so Lord we ask you oh Lord in our sacrifice oh Lord God answer our prayers oh Lord God answer our please oh Lord God there are so many needs that we have oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord you prophesied that the needs would be there oh Lord God so you could answer them and fulfill them oh Lord God so he we are Lord Jesus Christ vessels yielded to you oh Lord God be with us oh Lord God bless us and help help us get ourselves out the way in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen all right you may be seated I know I let y'all stand for a long time but I got in my mind now so the title of the message uh that God gave me was um knowledge in The Godly pronouns all right so what's important in this day and age because it's it's during a time where the where the the prophet didn't have to worry about that Spirit of gender identity and stuff it wasn't as heavy as it is today with a lot of kids in school having to deal with these uh uh different identities and labels that people are trying to put on them and I have to confess that when I first heard about all of these identities and stuff I was against all of them I was just I just didn't believe any that I thought it was all of Satan until God kind of had to you know slow me down and say well hold on a second Satan doesn't create anything it's only a perversion of stuff right so that means if there are pronouns out there that are being perverted there are pronouns out there personal pronouns out there that have a Godly purpose behind it and so today what we want to do is go through and see what those are so that we can know where God has placed us because you're not you're not a he a she because you choose to be but it's because of what God made you and that was before the foundation of the world right so the uh the uh the original P purpose of pronouns and it's specifically personal pronouns was to show your position in a relationship or and how you're supposed to operate in that relationship right and so as and we'll go through the Bible to see these things to make sure it's scriptural because they've come up with different kind of pronouns like Z and z and Zim and all that stuff that has no scriptural backing right but there are three personal pronouns that we see in the Bible uh and those are he him she her they and them right and as we go through and uh and we're going to uh turn uh you can pull up verse uh uh Genesis uh 27 and we're going to take a little journey through this verse because it has a lot of information in that we want to unpack all right so um I just keep keep reading all right so it says here so God created man in his own image so this is the first place we see a personal pronoun which is his and it's God referring to himself so God refers to himself as a he a his right the masculine part that's what God refers to himself so that's why we when we call on him when we call on him we call on him we say him Marvin sap has a song that says Praise Him in Advance you know there's a song out there that I never listened to but I but I saw the title of it by one of the popular uh secular artists out there that said God is a woman and it's it's it's it's partly true and partly false and the prophet used to preach he would he could he would say that you can be you can have some truth right but it depends on where you fall on whether it's Truth Or Not truth right so it's partly true because as we read further on it says in the image of God in the image of God created he him so now we have a man which is an image and he's also referring to that man as a himm as well right masculine right it's a masculine side and then there's a semicolon and we take a pause then it says male and female created he them right so now we have a he and now we have of them but there's no she or her yet right and this creature is completely finished right God has completely finish this creature it's perfect we if you read further on uh it says that God said it was good after the seventh day after they created everything everything was perfect right so we see our second pronoun here which is them right which referred to these two components inside of a man which was a male and a female and we we love that uh and I'll get to it further because it's the reason why we have the victory because we're hidden behind the blood we're hidden behind the blood of Jesus Christ and we never come in our own name right there were some people in the Bible that saw Paul casting out devils and demons and they were doing it in the name of Jesus Christ and they saw him and they tried to imitate and the demons looked at them and said Paul I know Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you you see they weren't hidden behind the blood right in order to be hidden behind the blood you have to have your will completely surrendered to God so these gentlemen were living a life that was not completely surrendered to God they weren't behind the blood which is why when they used the name it had no power but this female right here which we know her name is Eve later on but God didn't give her a name because her name was already in this creation which was him Adam right and we have a name when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we accept Christ in our lives we receive a new name as Mrs Jesus Christ so we no longer come in our own name we come in God's name and with that comes power right and so we want to we want to also not only just find these pronouns in the Bible right we also want to see the purpose behind them so why did God call himself a he and why did God call this creation that he created Adam a him and not refer to any her or she parts that will take us to uh 2 Genesis uh chapter 19 and I'll just read that so 2 Genesis chapter 19 yep oh yeah 2119 yeah 219 yep and it says and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them now that's very very powerful and that's and that's when you read the scriptures you really got to read with a revelation because here is God saying he created all of these beasts and he's bringing them to Adam to see what Adam's decision on what the name is going to be he's not telling Adam what to name them he wants to see Adam what is your thought on this God had so much confidence in this creature that he would that he knew he would speak the very word that God was already thinking about the animals right and that one creature what he called him so it was God him God talking to another hymn right so what we see in this hymn pronoun is that there's a Dominion there's a a um a dominating uh not a dominating Spirit but a spirit that is in control of creation right so when godam when God brought Adam a creature he said that's a lion and God actually said amen right normally we say Amen to God but this this creature that God had created in his own image he had so much confidence inside of him he brought him another creature and Adam said that's a bear and God said you're right amen God brought another creature out there he saw the bird flying he said Adam said that's an eagle God said amen Adam said you know what I want to I want that mountain to move to the left God said amen it's done God and Adam also said I want this uh River to move through the jungle empy out into the ocean God said amen it is finished God has so much confidence in this creature which was identified as a he that the authority had on he knew for a fact that he would speak the word without compromising right so before and and I like this because it's a beautiful type because before Eve came on the scene Adam had everything in control Adam had the whole garden under subjection there was still a serpent in the garden but he wasn't causing any problems because go because Adam God had full confidence in Adam that he knew how to handle every situation right before Eve came on the scene and I love this because it's a beautiful type of job right when job was going through his trials God had called him the most righteous person in the land right that's what God Said from he Heaven he was confessing that to Satan right and and he allowed Satan to go and tempt job and so Satan went of course we know the story he took everything from job took his family took his riches and everything and and the thing that he feared most he put on which was a cancer I believe it was sores and cancer God allowed all that to happen and the Bible says job never never sinned against God never did he charge him but the prophet said he still needed some purging because job said he wish he would have never been born he never complained to God but he said he wished he would he would have never been been born and God had to come down and had to check the attitude of job by saying where were you when I formed the uhuh when I laid the foundations of the world you see job and uh and just to kind of take a break in this a lot of times when we say he and she and we and we uh we try to say male and female we tend to talk about husbands and wives but when you say you are a Christian when you say you are the bride of Christ you are taking on the female you're taking on the her representation which means you don't have a will which means we're all under subjection to God a lot of times people say oh yeah the husband's in charge no the husband is not in charge the husband has to be Le of God because the Bible says that when Adam was in the garden there were two trees and God said there's there there are two trees in here the tree of life and the tree of knowledge you can eat from one of them the other one you can't you can't have nothing to do with it and that tree of life represented Christ so even Adam had a head in the garden that he had that he could only communicate with to and that's the same way a husband is so a husband's not just in charge just because he's in charge he's being led of God to be in charge amen amen man all right and so and and so in this situation with God and J J began to get a little bit out of his personal pronoun by saying he wish he would have never been born because God was the one that created him God was the one that brought him to be right God was the one that brought him into that situation he had to come and tell job hold on a second now where were you when I laid the foundations of the world when I created the galaxies when he spoke the word for a star and it didn't appear for trillions of years and job's um circumstance lasted maybe 3 5 years God had to wait trillions of years in order for one light to come when he spoke his word right so he had confidence in it and not only that even before all of that God had already had a fight with Satan in the rebellion in heaven and had cast casted him down to Hell so God already had confidence God had already had everything in order before job went through his trial right when God gives you a fight God's already handled the hard part yes sir right God has already handled the hard part which is why and a lot of times we like to blame the children of Israel in the story of David for fearing but they knew their place they knew they couldn't go up against Goliath because it wasn't they weren't called to do it right they were not called to do it they weren't the king and God God had already anointed a king during that day and that was David and when David went out to face Goliath knowing that he was the head of Israel right was able to slay the Giant and after that a lot people may not read the Bible verses but that gave courage to the rest of the children of Israel to chase the Army off am right after following their head right making sure that they were following the head right so and that's what and that's what uh um job was trying and that's what God was trying to let job know he wasn't picking he wasn't picking on him by saying you know who were were you when I laid the foundation of the world he was trying to let job know that job I've had everything under control control before you went through anything before any sickness touch your body before your UH your wife turned against you before your friends turned against you before your kids die I had everything under control am everything under control right and so Adam in a similar situation before Eve came onto the field uh uh Eve came on to the garden and stuff Adam had everything under control Adam had the garden running smoothly the serpent would come to him he' tell the serpent move and that serpent left right but the problem came is when um Adam uh uh uh begun to uh uh Adam well God made the woman from Adam and we're going to actually pull up another verse um we're actually going to pull up another verse to uh because we're getting to our final pronoun which is she and her right she and her we're going to see how that came came about to be we're going to put we're going to uh turn to Genesis uh 2:21 all right and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the next verse and the rib which God had so now back in this verse just kind of back up now God this this this creature that he that God had created which was Adam which was a perfect creature God is now performing an operation on him that was not in the original plan all right so God had to close up the flesh that he had already C God had to open up a flesh and close it up on flesh that he had already called perfect so now God then he takes out a rib of a perfected creature right and then and in verse 22 he says and the rib which the Lord God hath taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man so now we see the pronoun her reference referencing uh uh his wife Eve his wife right uh Adam's wife uh which is our reference of the bride and it kind of It kind of It kind of It kind of struck me when the prophet said that God doesn't need us and when I see this Bible verse I can agree with that right even though we are the even though we are the bride of Christ when Eve sinned right God Adam had a choice Adam was perfect and but Adam knew that if he would have not sinned with Eve that God would have took Eve's life so because of that he uh sinned with as well in order for uh for them both to be safe but we don't but God doesn't need us we need him we need to depend on him right and a lot of times it's knowledge which is the second part of what we're going to talk about that gets in the way of us uh um uh being uh doing what God needs us to do so going back up to verse 218 uh Genesis 2:18 now we have defined we've seen where all these pronouns have come from the Bible so we know they're scripture we know the definition of a he and a him is to be in charge is to be in command is to make decisions right God is confident when he when he places uh his word in a man because he knows it's going to speak exactly what he wants it to say right so now we see here in verse 18 it says and the Lord God said it is not good that a man should be alone I will make him a help meat right so now we know the definition of a she is a help meat for him and we can kind of see that in the in in the next verse When God had created all the Beast he created all the fowls and he brought them to Adam to see what he was going to call him Adam ain't try to change the animals they was already created Adam didn't try to change nothing right Adam just gave them a name that God already knew he was going to name them and that's because he came from him right and that's how we know we're Christians is because we speak the word that's how we know we're Sons and Daughters of God because we speak the word right so this pronoun she the definition of it was to be a help meat for him and that's our job with God that's all God wants us to do is help him not by trying to do anything because a lot of times God just needs us to believe and in that situation with job he didn't need job to try to go find the cure for cancer he didn't need job to try to go find a new job he didn't need job to go uh try to do counseling with his wife he didn't need job to do any of those things but just to believe that he was a redeemer and he would come and help him on the situation I can imagine when Eve came into the field uh and Adam had seen his helpmate and I and I bet you it just brought joy to his soul because he was lonely right he was lonely and so he I know maybe he brought some flower seeds and started to flower them and then he told Eve Eve go and water those flowers right then he got some apple seeds and planted some apples and told Eve go and uh go and water the uh uh the seeds are there he got some orange seeds and planted those and said e uh Eve go water those seeds right and then when as she watered them following the command of Adam right uh uh those seeds grew and she saw the flower and she loved it right she loved the flower so in all that toiling that Adam did it was for her and then he took her to the apple tree and she took a bite of the Apple she never tasted nothing like it right all that toiling was for her so all she had to do was just water the seed that Adam had already put she didn't need to change it she didn't need to say oh well why don't you put it over there why don't you put over here all she had to do was listen and water what Adam had planted and that's exactly what God was trying to get job to know because God saw a double blessing in job God saw a restoration of his family God saw a double portion of his kids God saw a double portion of his health right and all he needed job to do was water it with praise no matter what he was going through and it brought about a blessing for job God had already saw it whenever you're going through you might be sick right you might have Financial issues you might look at your bank account and zero dollars but even through that praise God for it right God's Got a Blessing coming for you if you're sick you know if you're sick I don't care what the sickness is and how sick you are praise God through it God's one one of the things is God God needs your help God needs your help to show he's a Healer and that's why we're a helpmate it's not our job to try to figure it out ourselves it's not our job to try to heal ourselves it's not our job to to deliver ourselves out the situation no God needs help to bring about who he is and he's a savior he's a Healer he's a provider and he needs our help to show that he is that that's why the king and Esther the uh he wanted to show the Queen off to show that hey this is my wife and when she rejected him he had to kick her out right because she wouldn't bring up bring his word to pass and God is looking for a wife like Esther that will come humbly Before the Throne and when the King asks of something you come through it without complaining like the children of Israel and that's why and I always every time I I read about the children of Israel I don't ever want to be in that mindset and it's hard to be in that mindset when you're going through something and you don't want to complain because if the children of Israel would have seen that God was the one that hardened the heart of pharaoh to come after them it wasn't him wanting to come out of his own will but God wanted to show them that he was a deliverer God wanted to prove to them that out of the in uh out of the impossible he could make something possible right God wanted all God wanted them to do in that situation was to water the word to say God you're able I've never come against this thing before but God you're able God you're able to bring nothing out of something oh Lord God Amen God wanted to show them and so God's looking for a help me not to try to figure things out or complain to the person but trust that God Will Make A Way Through the situation amen amen amen and that's why we're identified as a she that's why even uh uh uh even as a minister I'm not I'm not up here saying whatever I want to say I'm not as a as a uh as a brother in Christ I'm not just living any old kind of life that I want to live right we have to be submitting to Christ and whatever his idea is we say amen because he needs our help he needs a vessel that's surrendered in order to show that his word is true yes sir amen amen right so that's what the uh the definition for her a pronoun was it was to it was to reference uh um her as a help me to know that we're here not just doing we're not we're not we're here not just trying to do whatever we want to do but we're here to help the Lord bring his word to pass and he already has confidence in us because he placed the word there that's why God had confidence in job that's why God got upset with Moses when Moses cried to him cuz God had already placed the Word of Deliverance inside of him and he said what are you talking about I already seen you as a deliverer amen so um but now we have people in the world today that are trying to twist up all the words they're trying to twist up all the pronouns you got you got guys wanting to be girls wanting to be her you got girls wanting to be he and stuff like that but they don't understand what comes with that right they don't understand what comes with that placement of a pronoun amen they don't understand so and that's why I I would never call a woman a he I can't do it I would never call a man a she right right that man was made in the image of God Amen I it doesn't matter what the government says and that's why and and this message came out of a topic that we had at when are you for treat where brother I think it was brother Barry coffee was telling us like how will we help somebody that's struggling with identity issues because the thing about it is it's a huge problem today in brother brandom's time he didn't really worry about these things right cuz they were hidden but in our day we need a message and a word to help people that are struggling with their identity and so brother Barry had brought this brought this question and he said how would you help someone know their identity and a lot of people brought a lot of physical stuff and in my mind I'm thinking if people are already struggling with the physical identity you can't use anything physical to help them right right you can't use anything physical to help them because what the Bible says is that when God made man uh made a male and a female there was no body created it was already done in the spiritual World which means that the position and the identity and the pronouns were already established before there was a body created trth if you can get someone to understand that everything else will take place every other change would take place right and the reason why woman's wanting to be a man there's some pride there going on and that's why I won't call a woman a he I can't call it because then she's going to come at me like a he right she going to come at me like a he you call a you call a man a she he's going to come at you like a she I don't want none of the nonsense amen all right so we got to stick to the pronouns that God has given us because it's not just a physical thing it's something in our spirit and that's why when God placed Adam's spirit inside of his physical body and God asked him to name the animals and Adam knowing that he was a him and he was a he and the authority that he had by the word he could say that's a lion and God could say Amen right because Adam already knew who he was right with the Dominion that God had given him and I'm telling you right now you have to have identity when you're going through a trial you have to have identity when you're going through a sickness you have to have identity when you're going through a problem right because you can't come to Satan with a identity that's not your own and a lot of times we like to speak about the physical people and transgenders and stuff like that but there are some people in the spirit come on that's supposed to be a she and it's a he and there there people in the spirit that's supposed that's a she supposed to be uh that's he trying to be a she right at a spiritual standpoint that's why a lot of times you see women trying to get behind the pulpit God never ordained it God never created a woman to come behind a bullpit and preach right God created a woman to to help her husband which is it's it's it's not a lesser position or nothing like that it's still a part of God and that's why when Adam when Eve sinned Adam Adam said you know what I have to make a way for her her because she's a part of me because if God would have wiped her off the off the scene of the earth that was God and God can't wipe himself right she already had eternal life right so that's why we want to make sure uh that we know what our personal pronouns are and and also there's also the personal pronoun a lot of people talk about the gender fluid and the being agender and all that kind of stuff and they want to call themselves them and they and I didn't understand that one until I read the Bible and and in the Bible it said there was a semicolon there a pause it says male and female he created them right so there is a them pronoun and if anybody wants me to call them them I need to see your husband if you're a female and if you want me to call you they and you're a man I need to see your wife that's right praise God that's right I need to see those things before I give you that identity all right based off of the word I'll call you them and they all day as as long as I see the Fulfillment of the scripture praise God all right so now we want to dive into the topic now that we've kind of got a foundation and I'll be closing in a little bit but we'll try we'll get a little bit on this topic of knowledge because this is where the problem of confusion comes when someone's trying to be another identity than what they are another personal pronoun is what than what they are is by knowledge right it's always by knowledge so if we turn to Genesis 2:9 we're going to start getting to this this realm of knowledge and how we have to be very very careful with this that it doesn't give us the wrong identity right and it says here and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now I want you to notice something right because this tree of knowledge it's only identity is represented by knowledge but when you see the tree of life it's called the tree of life and if you would you know if you would turn to the um the pyramid that I uh that I put up there cuz we want to pull up the statue of a perfect man right we know by Revelation from the prophet that the statue of a perfect man was Jesus Christ and we also know by Revelation from the prophet that the the who the tree of life was in the Garden of Eden was Jesus Christ right so if you would look at the attributes of this tree of life in the Tree of Life knowledge already existed right you already have knowledge but you also have Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness love Faith right that tree of good the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil didn't have any of these other attributes which is why God didn't want them to partake upon it because if they partook upon that tree yes they would receive knowledge but they wouldn't get love they wouldn't get patience they wouldn't get godliness I mean we live in a world today where people are I mean it's it's information overload right people are so focused on uh uh statistics and uh uh stats and everything no patience right getting to work honking their horn just ready to run people over all the knowledge in the world and no patience and that's why God didn't want his children partaken upon that tree because he saw that they wouldn't have faith they'd lose faith and that's why you have humans today right and it's it's sad to see it worried about sickness right all they're only focused on coid numbers kill 2,000 kill killed 3,000 that's all they're looking at is the knowledge and the know and they have no faith to know that God's already overcome it all amen amen right so we live in this world today where it's all it's just a state of knowledge knowledge extraction and they say personal information and stuff is the new Gold Rush of the day right because people want to know who you are they want to know your habits they want to know your perks your your your your your characteristics the things that you like and the reason why it's called the tree of Good and Evil is because some people want to use that knowledge for good and some people want to use it for evil and you got to be careful to discern why uh someone is trying to get information from you right but I'm not preaching against knowledge because we know that it's good and I'm going to go through some Bible verses here to show that knowledge is good depending on where it originates from and I'll read through these pretty fast because they're pretty short so we have Proverbs 15:14 that says the heart of the man that have understanding seeketh knowledge but the the mouth of fools Feth on foolishness right we have Proverbs 2:6 that says for the lord giveth wisdom out of the out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding we have Proverbs 1:7 that says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but for fools despise wisdom and instruction then we have over here first uh um oh Proverbs hold on let me pull it up then we have over here 1 Corinthians 12 8-10 it says for about for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit so that shows that some people God has given the gift of knowledge too so there's nothing wrong with knowledge the problem comes when one The Vessel that's using the knowledge and how that knowledge is is used it can be used to bless and it can used to curse it's like a double-edged sword you can use the sword to attack but if you're not careful and you pull back you can hurt yourself right and in closing we kind of want to look just a little bit on this knowledge piece uh but in the beginning when we look at the fall with Eve uh which is Genesis 3 and I just kind of read through it read through there and kind of paraphrase some things it says now the serpent was subtle than any beast in the field which means he had a lot of knowledge he had a lot of information but he didn't have any love he didn't have any faith he didn't have any good intentions right which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman ye have God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden and the woman said unto the serpent this was her first mistake cuz when you have a head when someone's asking you a question go get your husband right when you got a question in your head go talk to your husband and that is that's a spiritual indication for us that whenever we Face something we should go and talk to Jesus we don't just take every job offer someone wants to give us like hold on a second let me talk to Christ about this one right oh you may have gotten a good job a a good job offer in Miami right not knowing that there's a lot of sin that'll pull you from church and when you talk to your husband Jesus be like no not that one I already see where it's going to lead you right so that's the first thing she should have done was uh go and talk to her husband because Adam already handled the serpent before the the the garden was in peace and Harmony right and she said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the tree of the fruit which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of neither ye shall touch it least ye die and that's good because she was quoting a word back and the serpent said unto her ye shall not surely die for God do know that the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit and did eat and here's a here's the verse when and gave also unto her husband and I can imagine in that moment Adam Adam knew Eve Adam knew her characteristics and when he saw Eve come up there and give her fruit like take this fruit Adam he said hold on a second I have never seen you talk like that before I ain't never seen you act like that before to me something must be wrong right something must be wrong and the day that we believe that God owes us something the prophet said one time he was trying to uh heal this girl and God wouldn't do it and we got it in the brother's chat and he started complaining to God and why ain't you doing this and the prophet said God left him alone the day you start complaining God will leave you alone in your thoughts right getting out of place that that day the prophet which was a she in the relationship with God tried to take on a he say God why' you do this God said hold on a second I'll leave you alone so you can figure out who you are and then come back to me amen and so that's how Eve that's how Eve got out of her place Adam knew something was wrong because Eve never acted like that before Eve never acted like that before and and in the closing statement I want to say she was deceived and I was thinking about when she was was deceived and the uh the serpent has was telling her that she could be like God I was thinking you know she was already God she was already God God had already created her to be God what is God God is eternal life she already had eternal life and still has eternal life right and I thought well she was going to get knowledge she had knowledge in the tree of life if she wanted knowledge she could have gone to Jesus the tree was there for her to eat of as much as she wanted but God began to talk to me and he said that um the problem wasn't her desire for knowledge because she had knowledge in Christ she had knowledge in her husband she had knowledge in God God in the cool of the evening every day came down and talk to his children there was a knowledge there she had knowledge her problem was her desire to have knowledge without a headship she wanted to know things without her head right she wanted to be a big God instead of a little God but God didn't create her to be in that place amen so in closing uh we have to we have to recognize the place God has placed us because that is the place that gives us power because in my Christian walk what I'm beginning to learn is that it's not our job to fight it's not our job to fight Satan it's not our job to try to try to argue with him and try to prove if you know prove the word of God to him and this and that it's not our job to do any of those things it's our job to rest God Rest in God and let him do the work because he is the masculine and the thing about it a lot of males a lot of females I see they have these disagreements with God that they don't just understand men men just like to get stuff done and that's something that I realize I've been reading this book um it's kind of like the Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus book kind of a variation of that and I began to realize these things and look at the relationship with my mom and my sister to realize how different we are a man just wants to get the solution solution done he just wants to get it done he don't want to hear nothing else where did he get that Spirit from he got it from God cuz God just wants to see what can he do in your life and get something done and just wants you to yield yield yourself in your being to him so he can accomplish it and uh bring about those desired fruits amen all right let us bow our heads um and go before God Lord Jesus Christ Christ we thank you oh Lord God for the word you've given us oh Lord God and uh um the fruits oh Lord God and the seeds that you've planted in us oh Lord God lord we ask oh Lord God that you give us the strength to water them oh Lord God to know oh Lord God that the battle is not ours oh Lord God but it's yours oh Lord Jesus Christ it's not our job to heal ourselves oh Lord God it's not our job to deliver ourselves oh Lord God it's not our job to save ourselves because we couldn't do it in the first place oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord God The Battle Belongs to you oh Lord God you are the mighty conqueror and the champion oh Lord God help us yield ourselves to you oh Lord God and praise you through the hard times through the ups and downs oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord help us not complain oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we know Lord God that in the worshiping in the waiting oh Lord Jesus Christ that it's we don't let the thought come to us oh Lord that you're not doing nothing oh Lord God oh lord your servant Daniel Lord God was praying one time and he needed a word from you but he was being delayed oh Lord because in the spiritual realm there was a fight going on oh Lord God so that means that even though we're waiting and suffering oh Lord God you still fighting to get your uh Deliverance to us oh Lord God you're still fighting you're still putting in effort you're exerting Force oh Lord God to come and help us oh Lord God Lord help us oh Lord to keep our eyes on that spiritual that Faith sight to know oh Lord God that your word will come and accomplish what it needs to do oh Lord God oh Lord we thank you for all that you're doing in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen [Applause] amen amen thank you brother God bless God bless amen praise the Lord that young man did a good job tonight amen amen gave us a lot of things to to think about amen uh make our efforts not in vain amen when we can come amen and hear the word of God Amen speak to just what we need just exactly what we need I hope we don't take these things for granted amen because it you know one thing he was saying he said about the man you know as being the head no we're not the head we're father following him and it's important for us as men to understand that if we're not following him then we're out of place and if we're out of place the woman is not obligated to follow a man that's out of place but if that man is in place amen amen so you know we just have to just it's just a continuation one of the things I recognize in that we know what kind of um uh uh Miss on the pastor's heart and how Sunday the brother came and just picked right up on that thought and then brother Quinton come in and preach this this is not a man right this is God speaking yes sir amen so you know one thing that I was just kind of studying uh and and from Colossians uh 1 chapter 16th verse says uh for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether there be Thrones and dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by and by him all things were created so when he created the animals and everything and he gave gave uh uh Adam the responsibility of naming those each the name comes with the characteristic of that animal exactly right so when we got out of the place we lose our identity and we lose the characteristics of what you're being called so what you're being called identifies your character yes sir amen right amen it identifies your character and you get out of place then it's not perfect you lose your character you lose that identity he called an eagle an eagle and look how many many times in the scriptures referenced an eagle and how and what it means to us today yes sir he created the flower we called it a lily then Christ came as the lily of the valley so everything that was created was for by him and for him to identify him yes sir amen and when you get out of that it identifies something totally different amen you love the Lord amen amen listen uh they not just giving this stuff out that's the truth no they they're not just giving this kind of word out I'm telling you so we appreciate God and we count it all joy Amen to be sitting Amen in a place where we can be fed Eagle food in this hour to be fed Eagle food one not too long ago my wife showed me a little thing now they call it a church I can't call it a church but they have churches that have received the spirit of Satan and have allowed things to come in and call it a homosexual church and you ought to see the filth but they think they worshiping God and they feel a real anointing feel a real anointing and in there just Lord have mercy what a mess what filth but we ought to thank God that we are in a place where we can be edified that we can be taught truth our children can sit under the umbrella of truth yes sir amen that's just a wonderful thing amen let us have the uh announcements [Music] amen um service this

some difficulties with uh our streaming presence but um we have identified the problem and we're continuing to identify to make the experience a more pleasurable experience um one of the things is you know the the internet service that we were using amen was sometime glitchy but we think we've come up with a uh solution where we won't have that problem um any longer it's going to be much better once we get in our permanent facility much better once we get in our permanent place and we can we can kind kind of uh design things to fit our needs specifically right right now we're just barring an internet amen we're we're in the hallway so in the hallway sometime we don't have the amount of right things that we need amen and we can't modify things because we're here in the school and we can't um adjust it according to our needs but once we get into our own facility amen we'll be able to do things and the beautiful thing about it we'll be able to leave it set up that's right we won't have to take it down throw it in the car come back and then set it up again and see in that kind of CAS sometime we forget to push one button yeah oh that's the problem but see when we get to our our uh permanent location we'll be able to leave it there and everything will go a lot smoother so just bear with us in this time but we have identified uh some of the issues and the brothers are working diligently Amen to uh make that presence uh um more pleasurable it is important and we care about our online presence amen that this this the the the words that is coming from this platform can reach
