see everybody out I just been enjoying myself enjoying the singing I wish my voice would act right but I I guess just get to say I'm getting older son and I ain't gonna do what you wanted to do but nevertheless I'm glad we got a scripture that says Make a Joyful Noise at least hopefully it's joyful amen not like you know rubbing two Nails on on a washboard or something but we happy to be Amos chapter three this morning uh let's remember the other part of the Saints and um uh Indiana this morning with brother Jack and and uh they're having a meeting this weekend and um quite sure everything has been going going according to what God's plan has been for it and man it's good to see uh have brother kwaku back with us hey man um this morning amen we thank the Lord for just taking him overseas and and bringing him uh back uh to us I'm always encouraged when I look back then I see him in the back when the pastor's not here you know you have to kind of look to the ministers sometimes to give you a little strength and courage amen so uh we appreciate him just got a wonderful spirit and we just like to say how much we appreciate um brother Quinton Junior's message I might just kind of tie some stuff in uh this morning I call Brother Troy on Friday and I said man that young man I tell you what I'm really appreciating the the young core Ministers of the church and and their uh Outlook and their input and the things that they see in scripture and and uh just their dedication I appreciate that um for myself as somebody that's been around for a good little minute I'm always encouraged to hear them preach I ain't know I ain't always here when they preach so though I hope they don't get you know discouraged but uh I live an hour and a half and things happen my job is not like everybody else's job sometimes I have to spend time on the job in order to be able to make it because them bills don't stop somebody out to know what I'm telling mine every month they keep on rolling rolling rolling rolling amen so but I do get a chance we thank God for um for social media that uh uh I and one way is I can't stand social media but on the other hand I thank God for the internet so I'll be able to tune in and fellowship okay let's let's kind of get into it Amos chapter three uh verse 3 it says can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no gen is for him shall uh one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing and at All Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people be Not Afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord have not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants the prophets amen um let us look at Luke chapter 4. before we have our seats yeah I'll pray for me this morning I'm normally comfortable but this morning I feel a little bit jittery uh it says uh and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiahs and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives to recover the sight to the Blind and to set and Liberty them that are bruised and to preach to acceptable yeah the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all of them that were fast where in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day this scriptures fulfilled uh in your ears let's just buy his this morning Grace's father we just thank you and we praise you o God this morning for allowing us this opportunity to be here and uh we just trust that we could move the human Spirit to one side so that the Holy Spirit can speak to his people this morning just anoint us Lord as as just uh speakers and hearers of the word of God this morning may you Quicken something in the hearts of your people we want to just remember the Saints that's in Indiana uh this weekend and the Brethren and we just thank you for all the things this morning in Jesus name amen amen may be seated um this morning we like to just use it we appreciate our visitor also and uh good to see uh uh sister wisdom with us uh this morning um we we just like to uh use it as a topic this morning a scriptural absolute and uh y'all just give me a minute or two to just kind of draw a little background from uh where where we we kind of uh wanted to preach this a couple of weeks ago but uh we preached something else and uh so we're here this morning and uh you know brother brother Jack brother Jack made a statement a few weeks ago maybe about a month ago and uh he was just talking about the younger generation and coming up and and uh wanting to try to make sure that they're established in the word of God and uh when I heard that just you know my wheels always gets to turn in and I get inspired I just try to by the grace of God you know uh try to follow the inspiration and the leading of the Holy Spirit I'm never here to just try to show y'all how much I know about the Bible uh it's it's I'm not in a preaching contest or anything of that nature I would prefer to just kind of sit in the back and listen but you know uh when when the pastor called on you you just kind of come up and just try to be a feeling but but I'm I'm always I'm always trying to be spiritual and and watching the the the leading of the holy spirit because the the Bible says that sons are led by the spirit is that right the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and so you know uh brother Browner makes a statement he talks about getting getting in the spirit and see if you don't come to church in the spirit you you're going to miss the the leading of the spirit of God for the church and I don't know about you you know I I always want to be in tune a pastor like I say and y'all know that for some years and I'm I was always just trying to find out Lord you know I might have my thoughts and my ideas and my perspectives and things of that nature but but what's beneficial Amen to to the people that that you got here for me to Shepherd and so I'm not the shepherd but as as one of the ministers with like we say we're not here to show off knowledge because we haven't opened book The Mighty Angel descended with the book open we we understand that that we we have we have a lot of things that can make us seem like we're smart come on church but but what what good is all of that what good is all of that if if the people are wayward if the people are unstable if the Young Generation is unstable they don't know who they are they don't know where they stand well I'm coming to church because my mama bring me you know and and and and we've seen this over the years and we do things and and and you you could see that in the way that people approach things in the way that we come to church right and and right and an attitude towards things it's a real indication that people are not a Man stable and and I think according to the book of Ephesians God gives us a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the church so that we're not tossed to and fro with every wind and Doctrine right see God's objective for the fivefold ministry is that we are stable right that that we're stable and the messages that that I preached are things that are being said to Quicken us and to Anchor us uh in the things of God glory to God amen and like I say you know uh we had the opportunity to Shepherd and it's it's troubling for a servant to preach a hundred messages a year and then you still realize they're not getting it come on somebody they saying amen but they're not getting it glory to God see when when you get it it it's the thing that transform Our Lives it changes us we we gonna preach this morning I'm starting to feel good right um now let's let's look at this word absolute uh it in the dictionary Webster according to Webster and if we read any quotes it'll be coming from the absolute 1962. um this is this is verse 59 if they want to pull it up but he says uh according to Webster this is what it means it's it's perfect in itself right it's Unlimited in his power it's primarily an ultimate an ultimate is a final concluding uh uh I've got this road back uh bad terminal in I guess that's right glory to God y'all help me right and and I was thinking about this and and just thinking about just and you know as as uh a student of scripture you know a lot of times I take things and and I Ponder them and I meditate on them and and I'm not perfect but the word is come on somebody I'm not perfect you're not perfect and that's not where when we're we we are we up let me rephrase that I'm gonna take that back I am perfect Hallelujah but not in a way that people see perfection I'm perfect by being in Jesus Christ can we say Amen right but out but outside of that and just my you know everyday Walk of Life and living I know that I do things that's that I probably should be on such a a level now where uh some of the things that I do like we used to say things I used to do I don't do nothing but that's not the case because sometimes we we constantly do things and and I know it takes it takes God to bring us to this place of growth and maturity but we we all should be at a at a spot where some of the things that we're doing we shouldn't be doing now I'm not here to dis-christianize us right I'm just here to step up to you with the word of God right and preach Christ to us but but you know pondering these different things and just looking at my own self from a personal standpoint uh we we all have to have something that's in our life that's that's final that that speaks of finality an absolute because if we don't we're going to be we're going to be wishy-washy we're going to be coming to a building and going out of a building and coming into a building and going out of building and then we're gonna come three weeks and miss a hundred weeks come on and and the reason we and the reason why we do that is because uh we don't really have an amen we don't we don't have something that speaks of uh finality this this is final right I you know when we think about brother Jack as our pastor you know we we gotta have an amen come on when when we when we think about the things that that the ministry is trying to relate that's got to be an amen to it all right because if if if there's one uh little bit of of Speck of doubt you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of struggle you're gonna have a lot of you're gonna have a lot of struggle with it right with because when when certain terminology and certain things are said you're gonna draw back come on church instead instead of Amen in it and see this is not about personalities this is this is not about who's preaching if Little Brother Joseph was preaching right it's not about your favorite preachers and your favorite uh people and that's nonsense to me I've been around too long for that we've seen a lot of that right amen uh God God God God has a five-fold Ministry and and everybody has has their has their portion and their approach in the way that they look at things and and and everybody you know when I started seeing people trying to act like other people I was like bro you gotta grow up you guys just kind of find out who you are as an individual right but but you know we know that brother Jack his uh God has called them and ordained them and we see the fruits we we see the fruits amen of his labors and things of that nature so we can we can you know from a scriptural standpoint have uh uh uh absolute come on Church now I know brother what brother Quakers say but I ain't that kind of preacher so I'm gonna pull y'all if y'all ain't coming with me come on I'm still old school life if you ain't with me I'm gonna pull you along you'll get it later we'll trust that God or but but we we gotta have something in our life finality no matter where you're going you're going to the church over there you're going to the church up the street wherever you're going as an individual the thought behind the preaching has got to be to you and amen you got to speak speak of finality but I'm gonna say something here if if it's not if it's not speaking of Christ you guys are wrong you because you can't you can't amen anything outside of Christ no matter no matter how good it sounds right you know and and I'm I'm one I look at different things and you know sometimes I I be on uh the podcast and this is the day of podcasts everybody and their Grandmama got a podcast and and everybody and everybody has something to say so-called and and that makes it so deceptive right because everybody has something to say and here's the problem I have with a lot of things when I sit there and and I analyze it I realize that a lot of things that's being said are merely secular and for secular people and it might be good and it might not be good right but but but everything in the word of God is good everything in the word of God is yea and amen is that right I miss a lot of these things you know uh and like would say we we got some some guys that's out there there's ministers they're saying some good things and like brother Jack read a quote uh the other week and I thought and I was good if it's if it's if it's scriptural and it'll help us you know you just have to say Amen to it but but a lot of things I listen to and I listen to a lot of conversations and different things and how how you realize a lot of things are not scriptural right I'm Gonna Keep labor on on that a lot of things are not scriptural and if if they're not scriptural you'll never have an amen in your life right and see this is this is the reason why um um we we appreciate according to scripture the sovereignty of God and I read your description Amos chapter 3 for a purpose uh God says listen because see you in studying scripture you gotta be able to follow God come on Church you got to be able to follow patterns right because if you can't follow the patterns you'll never understand your Bible come on and I appreciate God sending us amen uh brother Branham uh in this this evening time with a with a a Ministry to show us how to look at the Bible not how to look at personalities not to point to this and that but how to approach scripture and study scripture and see the word unfolding right constantly slowly unfolding right go back to Christ the mystery of God reveal he have he was trying to help us to see how the scripture has been slowly unfolding down to this time we can see in this hour that we living in because of the this ministry how the scripture has been unfolding prophetically hey man right because he says I'm not going to do nothing except I reveal it to my servants the prophets first God anoints a man right and that man is only the mouthpiece of God that's it that's it he speaks for God one time God God brought the people uh uh uh up and and in the days of Moses and God stopped thundering down from heaven they were like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa nope nope we don't want God to speak to us like that that was that was just too much for the people is that right y'all know the story God God wanted to talk to the people man we don't want to hear from God you know and it's weird because you always hit folk talking about you know how much they hearing from God God ain't just talking all the time like we think he talking I'm giving a word and this and it's like man scripturally come on now God don't God is not speaking like that right amen God God catches a man and anoints that man and that man speaks a prophetic word amen uh uh from God and and sometimes it might take generations for that word to be a man fulfilled but if it's God if it's God it's going to be fulfilled Isaiah listen Jesus Jesus came on this scene based upon the scriptures and the scriptures alone right amen Isaiah in the spirit was quickened Behold a virgin shall conceive and and that that word went out from the prophet's lips and it took so many generations now y'all smart people with good memories y'all know how many generations it took I can't remember today but eventually in the season in time amen uh uh God had his appointed person predestinated right predestinated to fulfill and regardless of what people's thoughts in regardless of what people's feelings was about it right amen that scripture had to be fulfilled right right and so when that went out one day here come this this young lady that was a spoused to a man named Mary she was it could have been Susie right it could have been Jane but God had predestinated Mary before the foundations of the world amen she was God's choice predestinated by God to fulfill that scriptural prophecy she was the manifestation of God's word just like genesis will let that be went out let there be light light was the very manifestation of the spoken word of God and Mary was the very manifestation of the spoken word of not not a man but of God right and see watch watch what watch what the angel had to do for Mary in order in order to stabilize her and anchor her right amen he had to work with her because because you know when he first came and said well you know you highly favored amongst women and all that that was hard for her to to kind of conceive right go back to the scripture and read it it that was a little that was a little difficult for her because she probably you know looking at herself like just a simple person and how could this be and and you know but but the the prop that the the angel worked with her watch this right in Scripture having to point her back to scripture right now this is what I'm talking about this morning it's it's important for us right see he had to make sure that she was tired of something not just some emotions a sensation or something of that next and I love that but she had to be tied to this scripture right be because once she conceived in in her womb amen this this uh this this this egg and blood right and and you know bringing this bringing this to her husband and your husband know what I'm talking about you know because if you walk on the United day now ain't one but one scripture in the Bible that was spoken right I guess you could we could look at that a little bit prophetically too I guess but but you know you'll have a hard time you will struggle with that right and and I can imagine because even Joseph was mindful to put her away and then then you know uh the angel had to speak to Joseph right and then then not not not only that you know Mary having to walk around uh nine months and and people knowing they hadn't had the ceremony so without the ceremony how could you know what I'm saying because that's order the things come on there's protocol that's and people that's boundaries right and we don't like it right right amen we we want to do what we want to do you know it's like scripture in this hour where you know uh uh and and this prophetically and naturally where women want to take the man name and do whatever they want to do I'll go I want to go I'll do what I want to do I that don't work like that what a what about protocol what what about what about boundaries see amen no that's that's an order there's things that's been been set up from Genesis right y'all don't mind if I deal with this for one second I feel something from from Genesis right after the fall God God brought a second Covenant in but then God also bought order right God put the man in the headship position right right glory to God and it don't it don't make the man uh a tyrant or anything of that nature but but you know God just don't want us out here right God want a stable God wants us anchored amen all right and see this this is the thing that I watch I I just watch uh attitudes and motives objectives and I watched everything based upon scripture and you can tell me what you want to tell me and I probably won't even argue with you about it but if we if we really get down to where the rubber meets the road at and and these things are not lining up with scripture and we say that we've been tied to Christ then I kind of start having a problem I may not argue with folks about nothing right but in my mind and in my heart I'll be looking at it like you can say what you want to say right amen uh uh your actions and this goes for me too now your actions and and your motives and your objectives and everything is not passing through a thinking of man's filter I'm not sure what you're calling uh your amen or what's final but your actions and everything else is speaking of something that's just not speaking of scripture right you you don't because you don't see a scriptural manifestation of things or it'll take me a year to really preach what I'm talking about come on Church come on Church see our attitudes and our thoughts and things of that nature and and just for the young people let's let's touch this a second this for a younger generation that that really do not have let's call it what it is really do not have an absolute right and You Gotta Have It it's it's it's uh brother Quake who was preaching the last time he was up and he was talking about the new birth and it's and it's got to be something that's personal right personal to you come on Amen amen glory to God it well my mama got the Holy Ghost and my daddy got the Holy Ghost and my uncle got the Holy Ghost I ain't got nothing to do with you though see uh we used to say I got just enough oil I feel like it just enough see my oil won't do you no good because I got just enough for myself and see God God God don't have no grandchildren right so so you can't come in like that and then we try to use we try to use the quote now I'm gonna be touching a little bit right here you know all that that he ever loved yeah and get the Holy Ghost that's right brother he could love you but but but God cannot change the scripture come on that's touchy but y'all know I ain't scared it's touchy right because because scripture cannot be broken for nobody right because when God set this thing in motion who could could God look to for the kind of knowledge and understanding that was needed to give us hope in this life to give us stability in this life to to bring us back to this place of uh Eternal Bliss there was no body there was no knowledge I mean the greatest uh intellectuals that ever lived didn't know the plan even Even Adam Even Adam didn't know the plan of God he did not know what it was going to take to bring themselves back into a fellowship and Harmony and Oneness with God after it was broken amen at his best attempt at at kind of sawing a fig Leaf around he realized oh this is not working and see um we're we're not trying to preach religion because religion is the same thing that Adam did is made a covering but really it's it don't work we're preaching Redemption we're preaching Christianity and I got notes but I I'm feeling good right we're preaching Christianity we're not preaching religion we're not preaching tradition see the sin of man Ministry came just like Jesus watch the parallels when Jesus Christ coming according to scripture through the wound of aversion with a Ministry according to scripture he preached and taught down tradition he told him he said listen because of your tradition because of all of this stuff it makes the word of God of not a fact see Jesus realized just how far from truth which was uh brother Trevor preached truth come on preach with me somebody how far away from truth that the people had drifted and a lot of what they had when when Jesus came on the scene with a lot of tradition mixed and all they had was a hybrid religion right they had a hybrid religion and a hybrid religion it's a it's a better looking something but it ain't got no life in it come on come on go back to spoken word it's the Original Seed see and so we needed somebody to come on the scene right and this is why I appreciate I appreciate the ministry right and the sovereignty of God watch this now y'all keep following my my thought right the sovereignty of God before the foundation of the word world God's choice right to fulfill uh Matthew 17. right to fulfill Matthew 17 I think I got that right huh because that the the disciples asked Jesus I'm gonna show you something here scripturally from from Matthew 17 show show you that people miss the unfolding of the word of God all the time right right people do the disciples were looking for something right and that's something amen had come and gone and they were still looking for it right they couldn't grasp it they couldn't see it right you got to thank God blessing in your eyes blessed in your ears come on glory to God to be able to see how God by scripture uh uh predestinates and unfold scripture right under the nose of the intellectual right glory to God because even when Jesus was on the scene and he had gathered a group calling them out of traditions that was predestinated before the foundation of the world Amen and he said you know what father I thank you I thank you that you heard the revelation of the word of God from the eyes of the wise and prudence and revealed it to babes right such as we'll learn glory to God see this this unfolding is is and you can be smart that's not what I'm saying but in being smart you gotta learn how to be humble and I say something you cannot approach the gospel from from an intellectual perspective you'll miss everything that God is is doing and has done amen amen is that right amen Jesus when he was on this scene uh he he his disciples like well wait a minute wait a minute you got to thank God that something quick and they're like it's something that we missing it's it's an event that we're missing right Elias must first come I could imagine Jesus perk up a little bit like wow y'all finally trying to see something right but he had to help him to see now y'all go back when you get home and read it in Matthew 17. he had to help him to see he's already come and y'all did what what with him whatever uh you wanted to do right but also in the same breath he was talking about another coming of Elijah because you know there's five comments right another coming Amen to restore turn the hearts right and see you know if if you look at if you look at John the Baptist's ministry right glory to God his ministry was a introductory Ministry according to Isaiah 40 and 3's prophecy a Ministry to introduce Christ right a Ministry to introduce Christ glory to God is that right see when you go back to Saint John chapter 1 when when when John was on the back on the scene and we know he had a six-month Ministry um the religious men religious people right they they approached John about his ministry because they couldn't understand it that's right right they couldn't understand it but John had a scriptural Ministry see God don't do nothing outside of the Bible come on cherish well God is doing a new thing you better show me show it to me in the Bible now I don't really want it come on Church come on church I know we ain't got a church full but that's the truth God does not leave his word and so when they came to John amen uh they were trying to find out well who are you and what like what are you doing right see and here's here's the thing just like with Mary the the scrutiny right and the things that you have to endure when when you're standing for scriptural truth come on see could you could y'all imagine being married I'll back up a second then I come back right be living in an hour and and watching people turn their nose up at you realizing that people wheels are turning right realizing that people are not uh with you in your testimony glory to God but yet and still you still gotta walk come on you still gotta walk and the only way that you can do it is because you're tied to an absolute you have a scriptural absolute you know right at the end of it said she told him she said build unto me according to the right amen under me according to your work right see it was the word that anchored her it was the word that carried up through all of the scrutiny in and all of what she had to go through and all the talking and no doubt even after Jesus came on and said y'all mothers know what I'm talking about folk talking about your baby and all that you know how we get we get funny about our children I'm real funny about mine right glory to God daily Dave they don't understand they daddy but they ain't got to I understand who I am folk may not understand me but I understand who I am it don't matter what your people's feelings are and what people think when that don't bother me you're entitled to your thoughts and your feelings but that don't bother me but I know I know who I am I have uh uh uh amen in my spirit I have an amen when it comes down to my children right and and and why why I do and why I have done either either we believe the Bible although we don't believe the Bible come on church and see when when you standing for the word of God you're gonna you're gonna be scrutinized how many people been scrutinized we all going over here and y'all believe in this and y'all under y'all letting brother Jack deceive y'all no I could see scripturally by by Revelation and inspiration of God well God has quickened right that something in me has an amen right brother Quakers say the a manner is in here if you're born again right because because me and the world are the same right and and and and here's the thing right brother Brown preached a message right uh uh the false anointed ones at the end time right and and taking the scripture to show us that people will be anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost anointed and still be false teachers of the word huh that ain't far fetched look at look at look at Balaam Balaam was anointed right caiaphasis was anointed right Balaam was anointed and balak knew that he was anointed and and he went to him right glory to God because whatever he said came to pass come on man right that's right glory to God but then he went to God and better I said wait a minute man come on we try to we try to build you up we won't give you a bigger Ministry give you a bigger following and everything like that well when in praying God says God says no don't do that now do my people bailac had you know what watch this watch the spirit the spirits don't die balak had took a man bailiff and showed him the hind parts of the church what he did he showed him all of the bad parts right all of the mistakes when you see that that's the wrong Spirit on a person come on let me come on over here let me let me come on over here let me show you this that's the wrong it's the it's the same Spirit Spirits do not die right glory to God hey glory and Bala came and said boy look at here I can't curse what you know if God don't put it in my mouth I can't do it he couldn't curse God's children God let him go and all he did was spoke a blessing on him right because you can't curse what God ain't cursed is that right if God is blessed a person that person is blessed I don't care what you say what you think about it is that right Oh Glory to God but you know we we've appreciate it because you know we're living in an hour where where there's so much access to information but all information and good information right and see and see when when I see this age that I'm living in and and and I go back to the thing that I've heard over the years right I I be like amen right I have an absolute come on I have an absolute I I realize um I realized something I've been pondering this all week I have a lot of thoughts so y'all forgive me I I I I I I I'll read the quote if y'all need me to but if not can I preach just like to preach sometime right you know all week you know I was I was thinking about I was thinking about the ministry of the son of man and uh just his testimony of of not having a lot of education and things of that nature and that kind of lines up with scripture because in the book of Acts those brother and they weren't very schooled right but you had to take note that they've been with God Amen is that right glory to God and I was thinking either brother Brandon was the biggest deceiver of the world has ever known or that that was God inspiring amen the thought and the perspective that we have come on y'all still with me either either see we got a attribute it to the intelligence of a man which I'm smart enough to realize it don't work like that it cannot be the intelligence of a man because a lot of times we miss God a million miles amen by simplicity right we we jump over the top of God because of the way that God unfolds and reveals himself is that right so then we when we look at a Ministry you you realize it couldn't be a man to to be able to identify himself in Scripture right even when you look back at John the Baptist it took something that was greater than John the Baptist to place him in his ministry in scripture and show him what he should be doing in his ministry that was far beyond a man right see the prophets know that his ministry was so great and being at the line that he came up of the priesthood God sent him out amen uh to the wilderness right and when he come back he wasn't some smart skilled verse man right talking proper he's just calling you a bunch of Snakes in the Grass that's right you're watching Devils you bought your Snakes in the Grass wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute see if he had a stayed in that that that lineage in that line he would have some sort of big you know how y'all smart folk are I ain't that smart but I'm not dumb either but you know he would have come with some word it's like hold on a minute let me go Google what that means you know but he come he come and identifying the characteristics of people by nature and what he saw the craftiness right of of a snake and he's seeing that kind of spirit being identified see even even when Jesus was on the scene Jesus could look back because they wanted he they wanted to take Jesus life in the book of Saint John and Jesus said you know what you are your father the devil right and they was probably sitting there dumbfounded right but see Jesus he was the absolute amen he was the author he was the finish of the faith he he was the one that you know from the very beginning that could identify from from from Glory this Spirit right y'all with me because brother Trevor just preached on the serpent sea so can I preach see he could identify the spirit after you know the one Heaven Satan was kicked down to earth into eating right and and and and found a vessel that he could blend with right and and bring forth his agenda reproduce Sons after his own kind amen Y'all Gonna Make Me preach the serpency but I ain't coming to do that right but it's the truth huh the only the only thing that could do that watch the serpent see in in Mass Humanity's understanding now they put him on his belly but he wasn't on his belly back in Genesis before the fall he was a reptile he was upright he was close to Adam right he had a place for a soul come on he could he could reason he could talk huh he wasn't some slithering right that that his that snake that never would have blended with with right Humanity it was so close to humanity that his secret blend and Satan could reproduce after his kind yes sir amen glory to God and then Jesus following the characteristics right this is why the prophet could preach uh identification and and and you know uh identified by its characteristics right see that's characteristics that we manifest as sons of God Amen and Daughters of God and then there's other characteristics that's there too come on glory to God glory to God see Satan has characteristics see Jesus knew that the characteristics of God would not want to kill him right glory to God see Jesus was able to follow the characteristics all the way from Genesis right when Cain slew his brother and hit him in in the dirt right where did jealousy come from God jealousy come from amen uh Lucifer because Lucy was for was jealous of of Michael and his kingdom and he deceived the third part of the Angel right and took him to the size of the north and tried to build a bigger better looking Kingdom right wrong amen Micah had no reason to be jealousy is that right amen of Lucifer glory to God the Creator had no reason to be jealous jealousy never come from God if you got a jealousy Spirit on you that don't come from God I come from the Devil glory glory to God amen amen see and so Jesus could watch that when when Cain when Cain you know they were offering up uh the different sacrifices and everything and and and you know Cain can't put a lot of work you know not a lot of work he put a lot of work the whole time was you should say put a lot of work into you know tilling the soil and bringing forth this fruits to the field and everything and all of the efforts he put forth and he brought that to God said boy look at what I've done oh what by look at what I've done God looked at it say well that's not going to be accepted y'all know I can imagine giving him to give him that side side like huh y'all know what I'm talking about when you hear something that ain't quite right you'll be like huh okay you don't ask me when there's something wrong like huh okay whatever but I'm not going for that and then Abel Abel comes out amen by inspiration dragging a lamb right dragging a lamb and then putting them on the Altar and then ain't no good way to say it just hacking it I know he ain't had no uh Sharp you know knives to cut him just oh see we won't we want religion beautiful non-offensive don't hurt my feelings right man will you ever seen that in the Bible a non-offensive god he only he you know blessed is meat is not offended how could how could you even be offended in God see but he he hacks it and and God said that's it right see here's the thing and we don't want to come to grips with this because of our reasoning right that that there's a way that seeming right unto a man right there's things that God accept and there's things that God ain't gonna accept see in the minds of people in today's society and that's why I liked it uh my brother Quinn's in his message on pronouns and stuff we we got all of this stuff that Humanity wants us to accept see but then you know God anoints a young man and takes him in the scripture back to the original right and shows him that that the pronouns are there but you gotta keep them in line with the scripture right you got to keep things in line so and and see 30 years ago I wouldn't have had to preach on pronouns come on Church I could preachers to the team she come up with me right oh and sister Shonda some of them see we was we was the young people back then now I'm at retirement age thank you Jesus came retired but you know I'm getting there I remember when we were in our 20s I was 25 and they were 2019 and 18 and all of that but we're still here right but we we we wouldn't have been confused about this gender identity I'm I'm identified no your girl if you got girl parts you're a boy if you got good parts and God don't make no mistakes all it is you got a spirit on you that's all that is that's all that is somewhere I can't grasp it I don't fully understanding but I realize if you come with male parts you're male God didn't make no mistakes just somewhere a little something got on you right come on come on some kind of spirit got on you and eventually you just manifesting that Spirit nobody was able to get that thing up off you but you can't be you can't be oh uh he her she they you can't be all of that you can only be a woman or a man come on y'all know what I'm talking about we we we didn't have that problem right and then it's a real struggle that they're fighting for these things right glory to God and and see here's the thing Satan has Unleashed [Applause] all these things upon the Earth this one the sovereignty of God we needed somebody to come on to see and inform us before these things actually took place amen and see some of the things that we couldn't quite grasp now we look at and say Amen thank you Jesus right amen Satan's Eden the goddess evil age to identify right right scriptially amen that we could travel a serpent grape silly so that we can have an absolute in this age that we living in see when we look at his ministry God had to take him back to Malachi 4. right and show him here's your scripture that you'll manifest right Amen on the Earth this will be your scripture this will be what you stand on right and this you'll take this and this will be your approach to the Bible especially your ministry would be to turn the hearts of the people right according to Malachi 4 turn the people back to God back to the word back the scripture back the Pentecost that's why he could preach all of that right because he identified himself amen with Malachi 4 and now the second part of what Jesus said in Matthew 17 right he was he go come and and and and he'll turn things back is that right see this is the time where uh you got so much tradition so many things that so contrary to Bible that that we we need it right we needed the correct interpretation right of scripture see if you build in something you gotta build it according to the blueprint amen come on if you don't could you imagine what you're gonna have right when you get to the end of that thing now I'm in construction now you'd be like great day hi in the world am I gonna make this work you not you're not gonna make that work because because you decided to do something in your own now you're not gonna be able to fit that you're gonna have to tear that thing right back down to the foundation right and see I take for instance you know what as a young man I probably was baptized by at least three times I was baptized in the Baptist Church and and titles a father-son and the Holy Ghost I was baptized twice like that once in New Jersey and once in in uh Riviera Beach and it wasn't until I came to the word that I was baptized correctly you say baptism don't matter that ain't what giant talked because because when John the Baptist uh when Paul came on the scene the the people the people had been baptized under John's baptism right and and they didn't even know nothing about no Holy Ghost right glory to God and so when when when Paul came first the first thing Paul asked him how was you baptized do you got the Holy Ghost well bad we'll do it about the Holy Ghost that one preached well then how was your baptized unto John's baptism see Paul commanded them to be rebaptized not entitles but in the name right not one in no titles it was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right and when they did they received the Holy Ghost is that right come on Church come on Church people I think people are afraid of of Truth and I know a lot of ministers are afraid of a meal ticket right yes Jesus did say go ye therefore Matthew 28 19 and baptize right in the name right hey but then when when Peter and them at the day of Pentecost which was the start of the New Testament Church and Peter them were the ones that Jesus was talking to that he gave the initial commission to right when they received the Holy Ghost and and they they came out and and Peter was preaching and and he had his Amen Corner right first and foremost if Peter was saying something that was contrary to scripture Revelation the Brethren that was with him when they was given the commission would have stopped and first and foremost come on he wouldn't had no witness he wouldn't have had no Amen Corner no preachs no preach be to preach come on preach with me somebody uh y'all know what I'm talking about because if somebody come up in here and they say something contrary to what you know y'all know to be true be like oh well I know it's been times boy back in the days of barbecue Tabernacle boy well I really folks come up in there with that stuff just get real quiet I'd be like oh you're not gonna pass that one over on them they've been taught a little bit better than that right glory to God Amen you know so so they they amended because they knew that it was quickened he had a revelation of what Jesus was talking about not titles but names see I I got titles right I'm a grandfather now thank you Jesus huh I'm a father I'm a uh those are my titles but those are not my names right my name is Willie Arrow smiley right that's my name I can't go put on my check Daddy not unless that's my literal name on my birth certificate and and and driver's license and I'd have to be looking at my mother like I don't know what y'all was on when y'all was thinking about me Daddy huh now that could be a nickname daddy boy or something like that but real name no but they had a revelation right amen and then so here's the thing the son of man Ministry was to tie up the Loose Ends do it do away with the unscriptural uh traditions and things that are not truth right because see if if you build something right that's not according to the blueprint what you got come on see so so we need it in the evening time because uh uh God was restoring spiritual Eve right bringing her back to the original word we needed a word church I'm gonna go in a second we needed a word church and the only way that we could produce this we had got to get back to Sea right we had got that we we had to get back so that we'll understand what his coming Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 what this ministry because God could not do anything outside of his prophet right but what showing us if you study if you study his ministry he was just trying to show us in the early stages uh uh scripturally why he's here and and and by this scripture this is my Ministry come on bodies I'm not just out here doing something by these scriptures constantly elude pointing back to these scriptures right because if he could get you to see his ministry according to scripture and you can understand why he's here and what he's doing he knows you won't have no problem when he starts to break down the word do away with tradition straighten up water baptism straighten up the godhead you won't have no problem because you'll understand scripturally why he's healed why he's here and what is Ministry entails right his ministry was going to take us back to the book of Acts right back to the Bible back the Pentecost that's why I could say earnestly contend for the faith in order to do that you gotta go back to the beginning back to the original thoughts and plans of God right see by being a prophet he could go all the way back to Genesis come on and see the first and perfect acts then when he gets to the New Testament Amen to Booker acts he can go back to the first and perfect acts the first and perfect teachings amen right amen glory to God realizing that in this age when when everything has been turned loose he realizes that you know what uh uh the people has has been turned back to the original and tied right there make it make a knot and I'm tired there that when the storms of life get the Raging and everything is coming against us and we're being tossed but we're tired oh y'all don't talk to me we're being tossed greatest battle ever being photos in our mind but we tied [Music] huh glory to God young people your mind that's why you got a cast down reasoning cast down Imagine It cast down things is that right be tied to Christ be tied to the word want to know more about the word because the word shows you who you are exactly right brother amen when everything is going on in school and and everybody's doing their thing I was 15 a long time ago right and I had my struggle in school I was an athlete and I played basketball and you know you get all the pats on the back and you know

just talking about things based upon the description quotes I'm just talking like look let you call it down let's get out of the lab eat some chicken and and and and fellowship good clean company good clean company nothing vulgar none dirty sometimes being able to sit with these guys and and and impart in part knowledge right and a Godly bit by the way because when I get out of the pulpit you know I ain't all that you know I'm just your brother you ain't got to be scared to approach me cause I ain't all that sophisticated and all that maybe the suit and the glasses might make me look like something but when I get out of the pool here man I just your brother I like to laugh and cry if you know anything about I like to laugh and crack jokes and and and and just have a good time right not all that superficial deep don't touch me I'm the man of God man boom get away from here with all that we be so deep we should be so heavily minded we ain't no Earth we good people don't know how to approach you they even saying the prophet told jokes and told about man tell me a joke I mean you ain't got to be I mean you know that's boundaries right [Music] see y'all I like these guys Nehemiah

to my sons the same way I have to break myself down you know I'm their daddy and I I I I I have to get into this house today what's up boy what's up bro I you know I had to break it to make them comfortable to make them comfortable with me because they've known pastor daddy they don't want that they they know that they they know that Rod of iron they don't want that right see so I gotta learn to come down just a little bit and and and get in there and act like I know where they at a little bit I do because I ain't always had no suit or not hey hey I grew up in a good home my mother my mother uh I know I'm taking up too much time my mother raised us right we she took us to church we had I had a good upbringing I made bad choices but I do know what the streets is like I know what all that stuff's like I don't want no parts of it so I learned when I when I see these guys you know I just hey what up why you know I know all y'all can't do that but I'll tell Mommy I got a little Swagger y'all might not like that but it's the truth you know out cause I don't want to be starchy and when the young people see me they they have a liberty and a freedom brought a smile it was sad no not I'm I'm unapproachable I want to be approachable I want to be you know here to I don't go so far with the young men because that's brother Jack job but I I just you know like to be able to help them to see that you know what brother Smiley all right he is servant of God but he all right he ain't all starchy like a lot of these preachers no no because I know what the life is all about you can't tell me I sold drugs I did drugs I I did everything but put a needle in my arm well I'm glad that God saved me amen let's get a lot of Handy praise we'll turn it back over the bus stop [Music] praise the Lord how many appreciates brother smiley [Music] one thing about brother Smiley he's always going to be transparent amen he'll tell you about the things of his past and the Lord brought him through that for us he brought brother Smiley through those things to keep our young people from going that way all these Servants of God what they go through in their lives is for us we want to talk about predestination and you look at what brother Jack he'll get up and preach I went through this I went through this I went through this brother Quentin brother Quaker brother Troy brother smiling I went through this God made allowed them to go through that so that they can bring and get to our level to help us to come up higher so that we don't have the same pitfalls so when a man of God stands up here and brings a truth to you like that you have to sit back and look at your life re-evaluate your life and say okay this right here will not be a stunning Stone but a stepping stone I want to draw closer to my Lord look at the man of God and where he is now I know where I've been where the Lord brought me from and I can Rejoice with my brother amen let's give our God another hand clap of Christ man he said some mighty good things and I was just thinking of when he was talking about his mother and I see all young people sometimes and you just pray for them it's hard to be alone it's very hard to be alone and I was thinking back to Genesis when God kept saying it was good it was good I created this it was good it was good and Satan's sitting back watching everything is good then God said it's not good for man to be alone Satan said that's where I get in right there it's not good so when people are alone Satan always comes and that's when he tried to attack he'll make you think bad things about yourself when you are alone when you're with other believers you feel powerful but when you get alone that's when the enemy comes amen so pray for one another always amen let's stand to our feet let's sing this little song I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I lift my hands I bow my knees as I worship at your throne I need you Lord I need you right now come on oh I
