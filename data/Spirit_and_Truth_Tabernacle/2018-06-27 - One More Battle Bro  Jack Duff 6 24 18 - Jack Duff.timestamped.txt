[49:40] [Music]
[49:44] a man he makes away when there is no way
[49:50] I just want to share a little experience
[50:02] that I had yesterday before I get into
[50:04] this song I went to a memorial service
[50:07] of a man that I knew what known him most
[50:11] of my life and he was a man that loved
[50:17] life his always does his own way he he
[50:26] had no belief in God and he wasn't
[50:30] ashamed to proclaim that there's no God
[50:33] he everybody met he he he resisted any
[50:38] kind of conversation about the Christian
[50:41] walk our belief in God as a creator in
[50:44] any way whatsoever he used to come by
[50:48] our house over the years it was a
[50:51] brother of my brother-in-law so I knew
[50:55] him for a very very long time and and
[50:57] after I got married he was dropped by
[51:00] not necessarily to visit us but to visit
[51:02] the fruit trees that I heard baby come
[51:06] along and you see evidence that Jerry
[51:08] had been there but it was his memorial
[51:14] service yesterday that his children the
[51:16] informant it was a very sad thing very
[51:20] sad thing the different his talked about
[51:23] a lack of relationship with the dead
[51:26] they had nine he he had a lot of
[51:30] different women a lot of different
[51:32] babies from different women what
[51:33] happened didn't wasn't bothered to any
[51:36] of them but they loved him he was still
[51:38] dead
[51:39] none of his bodies sharing what had
[51:42] happened in the hospital as he was going
[51:49] he had had colon cancer I believe it was
[51:53] and as that progressed they had that
[51:56] force him to go to the hospital and in
[52:00] those last moments of his death his son
[52:05] one of his sons of minister he he had
[52:08] continually tried the witnesses that
[52:10] over the years and that would always say
[52:13] something ugly you know if that is God
[52:16] then I'll do this and see if I could
[52:18] live that's an ugly thing that was
[52:20] disturbing really terrible focus on
[52:23] heart but he still kept trying the
[52:25] witness to his dad and as they death
[52:29] began to approach they all sitting
[52:33] around and and he found he lost
[52:36] consciousness but he was in a state of
[52:39] being between life and death
[52:41] he wasn't communicating I have a niece
[52:45] was a nurse practitioner she happened to
[52:47] be in the room with them and she kept
[52:50] with the doctor about giving him
[52:52] something that would speed things up for
[52:55] him because they knew he wasn't going to
[52:57] me and he they did they gave me whatever
[53:02] this medication was and my niece told
[53:05] that the other kids said it won't be
[53:07] long and it just be two minutes in two
[53:10] minutes you'll be gone two minutes
[53:12] stretch down to ten minutes and a half
[53:16] hour or an hour and they said that their
[53:21] most of the day he hadn't communicated
[53:23] but as death began to approach him he
[53:27] started making sounds and the sounds of
[53:31] thinking eating eating they went on like
[53:38] that for close to an hour and Madison
[53:41] was the nurse she said that that doesn't
[53:43] happen usually two minutes the person is
[53:46] gone but he laid there and he suffered
[53:50] and he was tormented to the very end he
[53:53] was resistant and it was just so sad it
[53:58] just broke my heart
[53:59] we try witnessing to him so many tries
[54:03] but he it was Adam and he I think he got
[54:06] pried out of big rebellious in that way
[54:09] and at that last moment he had his own
[54:12] demons he had to face and it was a very
[54:16] pitiful situation I didn't know that the
[54:21] signal today it just didn't know what
[54:23] but when I woke up this morning this

[1:23:03] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:23:06] Lord a man and in the power of his might
[1:23:10] put on the whole armour of God that ye
[1:23:15] may be able to stand against the wiles
[1:23:19] of the devil
[1:23:21] Amen these uh attacks from the enemy
[1:23:26] sometimes they they sneak attacks right
[1:23:30] or and in this particular instances
[1:23:34] esteems
[1:23:35] schemes you have to be able to be
[1:23:38] mindful of schemes that that was using
[1:23:42] a man and one at one of the schemes that
[1:23:45] the devil uses is sympathy you
[1:23:49] understand that sympathy is a scheme
[1:23:53] right that the devil likes to use and if
[1:23:57] you can just get you to empathize or
[1:24:01] sympathize a man with some things that
[1:24:05] you know you just be moved by your
[1:24:07] emotion right and and you know one
[1:24:10] another sermon a man that's in my bag
[1:24:13] I'm not gonna preach today but you know
[1:24:16] we we make decisions based on how we
[1:24:20] perceive something and and your
[1:24:23] perception might not be right
[1:24:26] all right but but we make decisions
[1:24:28] based on what we see it and and and you
[1:24:30] know people can look at situations and
[1:24:32] somebody might see you know one thing I
[1:24:34] might you know they tell me you know I
[1:24:36] look at somebody maybe
[1:24:39] can I pick on you brother Mia - okay for
[1:24:42] me to pick on him okay he said okay so
[1:24:45] you know he you know he came to church
[1:24:47] and somebody might say well yeah brother
[1:24:49] Nehemiah you know he was there with the
[1:24:51] the the checkered jacket right and
[1:24:54] that's that's what I saw but somebody
[1:24:57] else they know he was a brother dressed
[1:24:58] up with a jacket but also had sneakers
[1:25:01] on right and they're there based on what
[1:25:04] they see right and then they might keep
[1:25:06] rain I know he had a jacket but a little
[1:25:08] thing on their own you know so but
[1:25:10] people are looking at the same thing but
[1:25:12] see different things and you making
[1:25:16] decisions based on what you see that's
[1:25:19] not my sermon I'm reading for we wrestle
[1:25:23] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:25:26] principalities against powers against
[1:25:27] the rules of darkness of this world
[1:25:31] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:25:33] places
[1:25:34] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:25:36] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:25:37] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:25:39] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:25:42] gird about with truth and having the
[1:25:44] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:25:45] feet shot with the preparation of the
[1:25:47] gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:25:49] shield of faith wherewith you ye shall
[1:25:51] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:25:55] the the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:25:57] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[1:26:00] which is the word of God praying always
[1:26:02] with with all prayer and supplications

[1:27:45] him amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:28:00] so we I wanted to hit this last week and
[1:28:07] I ended up changing the sermon the
[1:28:08] Father's Day but we'll we'll try to get
[1:28:10] to it today one more battle and man one
[1:28:14] more battle we want to just tap title at
[1:28:17] that amen on today how many know we are
[1:28:19] in about I don't know about you but I
[1:28:25] find that my Christian walk is that
[1:28:26] after I get out of one I walked right
[1:28:29] into another one right and and and it
[1:28:32] just goes to show that uh you know this
[1:28:35] is a you know no matter what we are in
[1:28:37] life it's going to be a battle it's
[1:28:39] gonna be a man of trial it's gonna be a
[1:28:42] man you know a test of our faith all of
[1:28:46] these things have to happen and and it's
[1:28:49] and it's all part of the shaping and
[1:28:51] molding process that we're going through
[1:28:53] as believers and God is bringing us to a
[1:28:57] place of perfection so I just want to
[1:28:58] kind of talk about this a matter a
[1:29:00] little bit this morning I'm gonna read a
[1:29:03] quote out of latency of church age just
[1:29:05] to get us started but uh you know there
[1:29:07] was a statement that the Prophet made it
[1:29:09] says we'll have trial after trial and
[1:29:12] we'll have test after test a man until
[1:29:15] the life of Christ is reflected in us so
[1:29:17] you know to try to run from our tests
[1:29:20] amen we are not we're not accomplishing
[1:29:23] much amen because as a believer you
[1:29:26] gonna go through some things a man and
[1:29:29] you have to be willing to go through
[1:29:31] some things a man God God will never put
[1:29:34] more you than you can bear and and if
[1:29:37] you know I feel kind of like George
[1:29:40] Washington a man this morning there was
[1:29:43] a time a man in the history of the US
[1:29:47] where the British were coming in and and
[1:29:49] and the British were trying to you know
[1:29:51] reclaim this territory and you know you
[1:29:54] had people like George Washington who
[1:29:56] was serving in the military at that time
[1:29:58] and and
[1:29:59] man he was a general of a depleted group
[1:30:02] right and and and and I was told that
[1:30:05] you know this army that he had they
[1:30:07] didn't have food you know they were one
[1:30:10] one meal I think they they had you know
[1:30:14] just I don't know like some beans with
[1:30:16] vinegar something you know it was it was
[1:30:18] a really really bad meal but this is all
[1:30:20] they had in order to to get strength and
[1:30:23] and not only that you know George
[1:30:26] Washington was facing a time where you
[1:30:28] know these guys in the army knew they
[1:30:30] time was up and he was trying to get
[1:30:32] them to read reenlist he said because
[1:30:35] you know if we just keep fighting we're
[1:30:37] gonna overcome these guys and and and
[1:30:39] have they not done what they did that
[1:30:41] America wouldn't be what it is today and
[1:30:44] what George Washington did in order to
[1:30:47] get the people to a spot to believe him
[1:30:51] George Washington jumped in the middle
[1:30:52] of bullets blind and he rode out there
[1:30:55] on this horse I was reading a little
[1:30:57] something that he had about three or
[1:30:59] four horses get shot but he didn't get
[1:31:01] shots and he's out down his horse trying
[1:31:03] to encourage me come on let's keep
[1:31:05] fighting right come on let's let let's
[1:31:07] keep let's keep taking this you know to
[1:31:10] the enemy don't retreat don't go back
[1:31:12] let's keep fighting you know and that's
[1:31:14] where I'm approaching this this morning
[1:31:16] I want to tell the church let's keep
[1:31:18] frightened we might have one more battle
[1:31:20] let's write that up a less cheap
[1:31:22] frightened don't give up now write that
[1:31:25] quick now whatever you do keep pressing
[1:31:28] the battle hi Mimi
[1:31:30] a man in the cuz joins Washington was
[1:31:32] able to encourage those soldiers to keep
[1:31:35] battling
[1:31:35] they overcame the enemy forces a man and
[1:31:39] by them overcoming we get to enjoy this
[1:31:42] land to freedom today because they can't
[1:31:44] fight now I mean I have to have my
[1:31:47] forefathers not fight what have what
[1:31:50] would have been our destiny and then if
[1:31:52] you're gonna keep fighting
[1:31:54] what's going to be your children's
[1:31:56] destiny right come on so and then
[1:31:59] they're dependent
[1:32:00] you generations are depending on you
[1:32:04] glory to God enough talking spiritually
[1:32:07] you've got to keep fighting I don't care
[1:32:11] what you come up against you've got to
[1:32:14] keep fighting
[1:32:15] don't you think about throwing in the
[1:32:18] towel right don't you think about
[1:32:20] putting down your sword not top pick up
[1:32:23] this rules if you brighten the enemy hey
[1:32:26] man I won't I want you to see something
[1:32:28] here let's just let me start here in
[1:32:30] this disarming Laodicean Church age and
[1:32:33] the Prophet is quoting a man from
[1:32:35] revelation in 321
[1:32:37] he says this it says I'm at paragraph
[1:32:41] 360 - 1 he says revelation 3:20 went to
[1:32:45] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:32:48] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:32:50] overcame in a set down with my father in
[1:32:52] his throne and this is key you know it
[1:32:55] is to him that overcometh so that means
[1:32:57] you got to have something over come amen
[1:32:59] listen hold glory let me tell you can't
[1:33:03] pick your trials right God knows exactly
[1:33:06] what to give you right so so is to him
[1:33:10] indifferent us you're gonna have to have
[1:33:11] some overcome so don't complain about it
[1:33:13] Amen thank God put the trial that you
[1:33:16] got especially designed a man to kick
[1:33:20] kick brownie out of your life this
[1:33:23] person is on just for you and God knows
[1:33:25] you can handle it that's why he's
[1:33:28] sitting in your direction
[1:33:30] your neighbor might not be able to
[1:33:31] handle it but you can handle this just
[1:33:36] help or your neighbor and said you got
[1:33:39] this you got this you got this come on
[1:33:44] let me let me go says now now what we
[1:33:46] what do we know overcome this that is
[1:33:49] them that is the normal question to ask
[1:33:51] here but that is not the actual fault of
[1:33:54] this verse for it is not so much what we
[1:33:57] are to overcome but how we are to
[1:34:01] overcome now this is logical flip up it
[1:34:04] doesn't matter much what we are to
[1:34:07] overcome as long as we know how we can
[1:34:10] overcome listen
[1:34:12] now a quick look at those pictures which
[1:34:14] involved the Lord Jesus overcoming will
[1:34:16] bring out the truth of this proposition
[1:34:18] in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is dipped in
[1:34:22] of the devil he overcame the person some
[1:34:25] tasted the Satan by the word and by oh
[1:34:30] hold up hold up hold up hold up
[1:34:33] you ain't gonna overcome with emotion ya
[1:34:37] got overcome with feelings you've got an
[1:34:40] only only only overcome with the words
[1:34:43] and I can't help but inject this just
[1:34:45] hold it there for me for a second you
[1:34:48] know we were when we when we just went
[1:34:50] to Israel you know this this time we had
[1:34:54] an opportunity to go to mount temptation
[1:34:57] and I don't see that the first time I
[1:34:59] went but you know we were we were
[1:35:02] standing pretty much we didn't go up on
[1:35:03] top of but we were standing right in
[1:35:04] front of it and and I'm sitting and I'm
[1:35:07] looking at Mount temptation and I begin
[1:35:10] to think about you know Jesus up there
[1:35:12] in the wilderness and he's and how to
[1:35:15] devil for 40 days just bring in test
[1:35:17] after test after test you know and Jesus
[1:35:20] just sitting there and didn't use any
[1:35:22] supernatural power right but all he kept
[1:35:25] telling the devil it is written when the
[1:35:27] devil bring and this is why you got to
[1:35:29] know the word because when you fightin
[1:35:32] the devil the devil don't bring you the
[1:35:34] word y'all will get that you only get
[1:35:37] the devil will preach to you the word
[1:35:40] you wanna know who the first preacher in
[1:35:41] the Bible was the devil he took the word
[1:35:46] David Eve I am his own interpretation to
[1:35:50] it and should begin the video next right
[1:35:55] and if you're not careful don't allow
[1:35:58] the death to bring scripture to you you
[1:36:02] get confused and don't know what you

[1:37:00] of the pictures I'm just imagining in my
[1:37:01] mind Jesus on top of this mountain
[1:37:04] overcoming the devil without his
[1:37:07] supernatural power oh I don't know if
[1:37:12] y'all been asked this question but
[1:37:14] recently I was asked this question if
[1:37:15] you could have if you can have one
[1:37:19] supernatural power one if you could just
[1:37:25] have one which one would it be if you
[1:37:32] could have one Superman which one with
[1:37:35] it because you know everybody into these
[1:37:37] uh these superheroes right everybody I

[1:37:44] be Batman do you want to be who these
[1:37:48] little guys together huh
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:07] who else see that we got us looking at
[1:38:57] their own things but let's keep my eyes
[1:39:00] on the work notice this notice this what
[1:39:03] he says it says he overcame the truth of
[1:39:07] this proposition in Matthew for wearing
[1:39:09] Jesus is tempted to the devil he
[1:39:11] overcame the personal temptations of
[1:39:13] Satan by the word and by the word only
[1:39:15] it says in each of these major trials
[1:39:18] that correspond it exactly to the
[1:39:20] temptation of the Garden of Eden these
[1:39:22] are major trials is that what everybody
[1:39:25] facing the lust of the flesh brother
[1:39:28] Jack I just can't overcome yes you can
[1:39:30] if you committed to God you can overcome
[1:39:33] right the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:39:37] the eye the proud of life these are
[1:39:39] three things that we that we have to
[1:39:41] overcome Jesus overcame by the word Eve
[1:39:44] fell to the personal temptation of Satan
[1:39:46] by failing to use the word Adam fell and
[1:39:50] direct disobedience to the word but
[1:39:53] Jesus overcame by the word and right now
[1:39:57] let me say this is the only way to be an
[1:39:59] overcomer also it is the only way that
[1:40:02] you can know if you are overcoming
[1:40:05] because that word can't fail so you want
[1:40:09] to know if you overcome it let's see if
[1:40:10] you apply the word alright Amen not
[1:40:14] feeling any motion about I'm already
[1:40:15] telling you hear anybody talking to you
[1:40:17] and fill us any motions you already know
[1:40:20] they defeated they already know that and
[1:40:23] the only way you can get them back is
[1:40:26] you got to give them the word don't
[1:40:28] answer today the emotions they start
[1:40:33] crying you start crying right and you
[1:40:37] are you you knew does love but then we
[1:40:44] got you that that's where you wanted you
[1:40:46] right there
[1:40:47] right sometimes you got to have a what
[1:40:50] we call a face like flint right they
[1:40:54] crowded it there's no mean if you don't
[1:41:03] care is that you're not getting involved
[1:41:05] in emotional side of this because we
[1:41:08] can't let that devil trick us with our
[1:41:10] emotions we're the battle church right
[1:41:13] we have a real battle you know George
[1:41:15] Washington when you got the fellas that
[1:41:17] they say now I know the way he
[1:41:18] eliminated emotion they say he said look
[1:41:23] I'm gonna make sure that y'all didn't
[1:41:24] leave before it's time to leave if you
[1:41:27] if you travel II shot in the back and
[1:41:32] then if somebody's sitting around
[1:41:34] talking about leaving so you're gonna
[1:41:35] get lashes I mean it's gonna get a
[1:41:38] whipping grown man grown man right he
[1:41:42] had that he had the scare fear out of
[1:41:44] them now we ain't gonna do none of that
[1:41:47] y'all know that I got happen here but
[1:41:48] but what I am Telling is that we got to
[1:41:50] be ready for this one more battle and
[1:41:53] what I'm trying to do is get you
[1:41:54] prepared you know at a time of peace you
[1:41:56] need to prepare for war alright let me
[1:41:59] let me go a little further cuz I got to
[1:42:02] bring this in says uh now remember this
[1:42:04] church ok I'm actually I'm skipping to
[1:42:09] the next quote here this is revelation
[1:42:11] of Jesus Christ paragraph 15 three it
[1:42:13] says now remember this says Christ in
[1:42:16] the church
[1:42:17] in the true church is a continuation of
[1:42:20] the book of Acts but the book of
[1:42:23] Revelation shows how that the Antichrist
[1:42:25] spirit would come into the church
[1:42:30] now y'all gotta just y'all bear with me
[1:42:33] as I just take time to read these things
[1:42:34] I know we've read them many many times
[1:42:36] before but but where does the Antichrist
[1:42:38] character spirit come to the Spirit
[1:42:43] comes into the church right and this is
[1:42:47] why you got to be so careful because if
[1:42:49] you can't recognize a spirit the devil
[1:42:52] get you right the Antichrist spirit will
[1:42:55] come into the church amen and defile it
[1:42:59] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:43:02] and expose this thing revealing us works
[1:43:05] tempted instruction of God's people and
[1:43:08] look at this
[1:43:09] and the discrediting of God's words now
[1:43:13] we have seen that as soon as you see
[1:43:14] somebody's trying to spit in the words
[1:43:16] you already know something wrong right
[1:43:17] here and it don't take a rocket
[1:43:19] scientist right you already know you're
[1:43:22] in a battle so if you are ok I got this
[1:43:25] one I got it and the first thing I would
[1:43:26] say I see you devil I see I see exactly
[1:43:31] what you trying to do
[1:43:32] I'm not even entertaining the
[1:43:33] conversation listen he say he said so so
[1:43:36] the attempted destruction of God's
[1:43:38] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:43:40] Word look at this now now look at how
[1:43:43] long this gonna happen right down to the
[1:43:46] time he is cast into the lake of fire
[1:43:48] so this battle that I'm trying to get
[1:43:51] you to see the devil don't keep fighting
[1:43:52] until he's cast into the lake of fire
[1:43:54] and I just say you'd be cast into the
[1:43:56] lake of fire but until he is cast into
[1:43:59] the lake of fire he gonna keep coming
[1:44:00] against you look at he fights that he
[1:44:05] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:44:07] people get the true revelation of the
[1:44:12] true church and what she is and what she
[1:44:16] stands for and that she can do the
[1:44:18] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:44:21] army listen if they get a true
[1:44:24] revelation of the to spirit
[1:44:26] and notice where the spears are notice
[1:44:29] well yeah that's two spirits within
[1:44:34] within the framework of the Christian
[1:44:37] Church and this what you'll need by
[1:44:39] God's Spirit discern in Winston oh it's
[1:44:43] one thing to discern it but it's a whole
[1:44:49] nother thing to a standard so this is
[1:44:53] why I'm reading you put on the whole arm
[1:44:55] of God
[1:44:56] right because you're going to need that
[1:44:57] to be able to withstand but the enemy is
[1:44:59] actually doing in this out
[1:45:01] amen oh god oh god oh god church you
[1:45:05] know you know as Jesus ministry was
[1:45:07] coming to a close
[1:45:08] his sermons got tougher and tougher read
[1:45:12] the book of John read the book of John
[1:45:15] you'll start seeing as this vicious guy
[1:45:16] did their mean he starts saying some
[1:45:18] things that they hadn't heard before you
[1:45:19] of your father the devil you know what
[1:45:21] they never heard words like that from
[1:45:23] any preacher in a pulpit but the things
[1:45:26] going to get tougher and tougher and as
[1:45:28] it you know for us as ministers we have
[1:45:30] to deal with spirits you know and and
[1:45:32] and my job man I'll tell you when I'm
[1:45:34] trying to encourage the people to keep
[1:45:36] fighting and it's now don't give in to
[1:45:38] this stuff I've one more battle one more
[1:45:41] one more
[1:45:41] all right let's keep going I got I got
[1:45:43] some things to say here all right since
[1:45:45] doubt spear disorder withstand amen
[1:45:48] the Antichrist spear Satan will be
[1:45:49] powerless before he will be definitely
[1:45:52] thought of today as when Christ was
[1:45:53] stood his every effort to gain power for
[1:45:55] him in the desert yes take the hates
[1:45:57] revelation but we love it we're true
[1:45:59] revelations in our lives the gates of
[1:46:01] Hell cannot prevail against us but we
[1:46:03] will prevail over them now I took you to
[1:46:06] numbers 30 and I read this a man about
[1:46:11] Moses I just noticed something here
[1:46:13] first one says Lord spake unto Moses
[1:46:16] saying of hims the children of Israel of
[1:46:18] the Midianites afterwards shut down be
[1:46:20] gathered unto thy people now if I
[1:46:26] understand correctly Moses was you know
[1:46:30] about forty years a man raised up in
[1:46:33] Egypt forty years on the backside of the
[1:46:36] desert and then his last four
[1:46:38] he's used to bring the children visitor
[1:46:41] out so wrap roughly around 120 years old
[1:46:43] Moses is before he dies roughly 100 120
[1:46:47] years old and if we notice the scripture
[1:46:49] it says now you know and we can focus on
[1:46:52] what happened with the meeting like this
[1:46:53] was when you know Balaam got introduced
[1:46:56] and all of that God didn't like that the
[1:46:57] way that got introduced to the amongst
[1:46:59] the people and he was telling Moses
[1:47:01] going to benjin but when I come here a
[1:47:03] man when I looked at it just before
[1:47:05] Moses died God said now you're going to
[1:47:09] be gathered to you people this mean that
[1:47:10] Moses is about to die but just before he
[1:47:13] dies God says I've instituted of Israel
[1:47:17] of the many nights afterward shalt thou
[1:47:19] be gathered unto that people what he
[1:47:20] said Moses get ready for one more battle
[1:47:24] and I read it in 20 right gets pitch
[1:47:28] yourself prepared not only you but give
[1:47:30] the people prepare for one more battle
[1:47:33] right now I know you're all Moses I know
[1:47:36] that you know you might be a you might
[1:47:38] be even a little sick in your body I
[1:47:40] don't know what's the conditions but I
[1:47:41] want you to get yourself prepared for
[1:47:44] one more battle all the way down to the
[1:47:46] Thompsons Manas get ready lead the earth
[1:47:48] he has to battle and what I'm trying to
[1:47:52] get you to see is that it's never gonna
[1:47:54] get easy but we have to we have to
[1:47:57] govern our minds we have to govern our
[1:48:00] spirit to note that we are enter into a
[1:48:03] battle desert in which there is dead let
[1:48:06] the spirit of the enemy and I wanna you
[1:48:08] know kind of talk about these battles
[1:48:10] here I wanna I want I want you to
[1:48:12] understand something that the devil

[1:48:52] 17 the verse 8 through 10 this is a man
[1:48:57] of Goliath this is a big devil right and
[1:49:02] he's coming out against the children of
[1:49:03] Israel and notice what he says here in
[1:49:06] 1st Samuel 17 verse 8 he says up and he
[1:49:10] stood and crowd up to the armies of
[1:49:11] Israel and said unto them why are you

[1:49:20] of Philistine and ye servants of Saul

[1:56:53] six fingers in and on every foot six
[1:56:55] toes for and 20 and number and he also
[1:56:58] was borne to the Giant and when he
[1:57:01] defied Israel Jonathan the son of
[1:57:03] Samaria the brother of date
[1:57:04] David slew him these four were born to
[1:57:07] the Giant and Gath and failed by the
[1:57:09] hand of David and by the hand of his
[1:57:11] servants we found him roughly four to
[1:57:13] five battles just in these few
[1:57:15] scriptures shows you that the devil is a
[1:57:18] liar and he will not stop fighting he's
[1:57:22] gonna fight until he's cast into the
[1:57:25] lake of fire
[1:57:25] and since he's gonna fight I'm here to
[1:57:28] encourage the church get ready for one
[1:57:31] more battle and after you overcome this
[1:57:33] one you get really have to overcome
[1:57:35] another one and after you overcome that
[1:57:37] one you get ready to overcome another
[1:57:39] but it's not it's not it's about what
[1:57:42] you have to overcome
[1:57:43] it's how and you want to know how to
[1:57:47] overcome use the same word that you're
[1:57:51] using to beat the first temple that same
[1:57:53] word would defeat the nextel it is
[1:57:57] written it is written you don't need a
[1:57:59] superpower you just need the words you
[1:58:03] got more than enough when you got the
[1:58:05] word can I go in a little further look
[1:58:09] at this just I was I was looking at
[1:58:13] there and another another I won't read
[1:58:14] all of the scripture here but I'll just
[1:58:16] tell you the story you want to know
[1:58:17] somebody else later on the scripture
[1:58:19] that came in came up against the
[1:58:20] Philistines a saying Phyllis time's
[1:58:22] right that you know actually this was
[1:58:25] earlier early in scripture these same
[1:58:27] Phyllis times but at one time they
[1:58:29] fought Sampson had a fight with him
[1:58:32] and Samson you know he the Bible said
[1:58:35] that he slew 30 Philistines and took
[1:58:37] thirty changes of garments and this was
[1:58:39] after he pressed his wife to give them
[1:58:41] an answer to a riddle that they couldn't
[1:58:43] figure out and you know they pressured
[1:58:45] his wife and she got she got the ants
[1:58:46] out of Samson and she gave the answer to
[1:58:48] it to these men all right
[1:58:51] hallelujah now notice you know you got
[1:58:55] to watch things like this because a
[1:58:57] woman and the scripture represents the
[1:59:00] church hallelujah now first of all
[1:59:03] scepter should have been married to this
[1:59:04] particular woman right
[1:59:06] his dad even facto said not is there any
[1:59:08] other woman amongst to Phyllis I mean
[1:59:11] muster Israelites that you might want to
[1:59:13] marry why are you going down amongst
[1:59:14] these Phyllis times to try to marry one
[1:59:15] of them and he
[1:59:17] but she keys me daddy please
[1:59:19] just-just-just make it happen his daddy
[1:59:21] went on do you know what what he wanted
[1:59:23] and it got down there and its first
[1:59:25] encounter with this lady she done
[1:59:27] tricked him into something he married
[1:59:31] thought he was in love and he uh she'd
[1:59:34] come and get the secret from what you
[1:59:36] know why don't you tell me what what
[1:59:37] happened here you know and what's the
[1:59:39] real what's supposed to mean in this
[1:59:40] riddle so he gives her the secret and
[1:59:42] and next to another guy showed up on the
[1:59:43] seventh day and they had the answer to
[1:59:45] the riddle and they just bloody they
[1:59:46] they thought they did it Sampson got so
[1:59:49] upset he got up and he went and the
[1:59:53] Bible said he went and found 30min
[1:59:54] because he said I'm gonna give you
[1:59:56] thirty changes the garment if they'll
[1:59:57] get the riddle he went and found 30
[1:59:59] pills times and killed them all
[2:00:01] took they took that garment and then
[2:00:03] gave them to the other Philistines well
[2:00:08] he didn't stay with his wife after this
[2:00:11] battle Sampson got up went back to his
[2:00:13] father's house and and the Bible said
[2:00:16] after some time he showed back up to his
[2:00:19] wife's house and when he got there this
[2:00:21] is why he was full to be down there
[2:00:23] messing with her in the first place what
[2:00:24] happened when he got there did that but
[2:00:27] daddy said I thought you was never
[2:00:28] coming back so I gave her to somebody
[2:00:31] else
[2:00:32] now you don't gave my wife away what are
[2:00:37] you doing came away what is this Samson
[2:00:40] got mad again look at what happened the
[2:00:42] Bible says this and it says he took
[2:00:46] Fox's tied their tails together and then
[2:00:49] he burned down all the fields of the
[2:00:51] Philistines now you know that messed up
[2:00:53] nesting up and I see and you know
[2:00:55] the field times got a little upset then
[2:00:57] food was destroyed so now you think
[2:00:59] they're gonna stop messing with Samson
[2:01:00] no guess what happened in the Bible the
[2:01:03] Bible said he wanted to retaliate and it
[2:01:05] states that when they came against a
[2:01:07] person you know from retaliating for for
[2:01:09] burning a fields the Bible says Samsung
[2:01:12] slew them with slew them hip and thigh
[2:01:15] with a great slaughter we don't know how
[2:01:17] many died but a lot of felis times died
[2:01:19] when Samson got upset I won't try to
[2:01:22] read this verse with me
[2:01:25] Genesis 15 11 just read this with me
[2:01:30] these Devils just won't stop and since
[2:01:33] they won't stop we not gonna stop we're
[2:01:38] gonna keep getting ready for battle
[2:01:39] so just 15 just read this bit me hey man
[2:01:49] I think I want to read I starting at
[2:01:51] verse 11 here if I can
[2:01:53] judges 15 11 the Bible says this then
[2:02:04] 3,000 men of Judah went to the top of
[2:02:07] the rock eat them and set the samson I
[2:02:14] think I might have the wrong script you
[2:02:16] let me just keep reading
[2:02:17] sister rock it and set the samson north
[2:02:20] style not that the Phils time to rules
[2:02:21] over us what is this that iris done it
[2:02:23] to us said them as they did unto me so
[2:02:26] have I done to them and they said unto
[2:02:28] Him we are come down to Bondi that we
[2:02:31] may deliver thee into the hands of the
[2:02:32] Philistines in the census that to them
[2:02:34] swear unto me that ye will not follow up
[2:02:38] unto yourselves and they spoke and they
[2:02:40] spake of damned stand no but we will
[2:02:42] bomb the fast and deliver thee into
[2:02:44] their hand but surely we will not kill
[2:02:46] thee and they bound him with two new
[2:02:47] cores and brought him up from the rock
[2:02:50] and when the and when he came unto Lee
[2:02:52] ha the Philistine shouted against him
[2:02:54] the spear Lord came mightily upon him
[2:02:56] and the core core is that were whereupon
[2:03:00] his arms became as flex that was burnt
[2:03:03] with fire and his bands loosed off from
[2:03:06] his hands and he found a new job own
[2:03:08] oven a stand put forth his hand and took
[2:03:11] it as food a thousand men therewith and
[2:03:13] Sampson stamped with the jawbone of an
[2:03:15] ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an
[2:03:17] ass having slain a thousand man now you
[2:03:21] think after Samson was going through
[2:03:23] this experience with these Philistines
[2:03:26] that this would be enough this one man
[2:03:31] justly 1000 men by his self and you
[2:03:37] would think that they would leave this
[2:03:38] fella alone
[2:03:40] you think the battle would be over I
[2:03:43] mean and I don't know I don't know about
[2:03:45] y'all but some of y'all made maybe you
[2:03:46] better might not be like Samson we don't
[2:03:49] slayed a thousand a Devils that I mean a
[2:03:51] thousand people at one time but a
[2:03:52] thousand don't make maybe you haven't
[2:03:54] done it but but there's some things that
[2:03:56] you have overcome there are some big
[2:03:58] things in your life that you have
[2:04:00] overcome and you would think that the
[2:04:02] devil would stop fightin happen it
[2:04:12] didn't happen and this is what I want
[2:04:14] you to know just because you get a
[2:04:15] victory don't mean it's over just for
[2:04:23] you you you go you're gonna get yourself
[2:04:24] you're gonna get some mighty features
[2:04:26] hallelujah God deliver you bringing out
[2:04:29] the hospital with you go get some great
[2:04:31] things I think but the devil gonna be
[2:04:34] right there with another battle oh my
[2:04:38] God my God my God look at this the next
[2:04:42] thing that happened to that is that the
[2:04:44] Samson is that he got tied up with the
[2:04:46] light and you know what I'm saying
[2:04:49] Devils come back around working with his
[2:04:54] wife now again his second wife Ellen
[2:04:58] catch that it was the second wife and he
[2:05:01] again he should not have been married to
[2:05:02] these women in the first place but here
[2:05:04] down here
[2:05:04] he should have learned from the first
[2:05:06] wife but now he'd come right back down
[2:05:08] and get married to a Delilah and now
[2:05:13] then his first wife give away the secret
[2:05:15] what you think the second wife of the
[2:05:17] Philistines going to do she gave away
[2:05:19] his secret of as to where his strength
[2:05:21] was and when them Devils got ahold of
[2:05:24] that information they took sensing put
[2:05:26] him and and and it was so bad church
[2:05:29] date they took his eyes out they plucked
[2:05:31] his eyes out the man ended up in a
[2:05:33] really really bad spot but you know
[2:05:35] here's a good thing that I find was Sam
[2:05:38] since that why he was dead he knew he
[2:05:39] was still in Bali he was in prison he
[2:05:41] had no more eyes and and maybe it looked
[2:05:44] like he didn't have any more strength
[2:05:45] but the one thing about Samson he had a
[2:05:47] he had a prayer in this state
[2:05:49] and his prayer was God let me be
[2:05:53] advanced you know of what the enemy has
[2:05:56] done to me and he cried out once more
[2:05:59] Lord hallelujah and what I'm saying
[2:06:02] sometime in the mists of your one more
[2:06:04] battle you might have to cry out once
[2:06:06] more Lord if you pout you do before then
[2:06:10] is a way to put you through again one
[2:06:13] small little whatever you do don't give
[2:06:17] up on the devil Andrus Ansip late that
[2:06:19] place at La Villita ah mrs. Willis Pam
[2:06:23] he was where he was going to say Phil
[2:06:26] Spector's that was his old job that was
[2:06:29] just that was his his reason for testing
[2:06:32] was to kill pilasters
[2:06:35] but hear you say Lord I will fill you so
[2:06:37] many times but I'm willing I'm willing
[2:06:39] I'm willing right now to die with these
[2:06:41] Philistines he acts a little boy should
[2:06:43] just lead me to the pills lead me to the
[2:06:46] pillars and they say when I get here to
[2:06:47] the pillars they say he said he's a loop
[2:06:49] once to have man where he wants to just
[2:06:51] to do pillars that's keeping a building
[2:06:52] structure up just leaking right down
[2:06:54] between everybody want over just
[2:06:56] laughing and giggling watching the
[2:06:57] weather what is this guy doing he knew
[2:06:59] exactly where to be and he prayed that
[2:07:01] prayer and put his hands on the pillars
[2:07:02] and when he prayed my god the strength
[2:07:06] began to come back in his body his hat
[2:07:09] begin the gruel again Oh somebody need
[2:07:11] their they spiritual hair the gorillas
[2:07:17] can and something they naturally had a
[2:07:20] girl again - as a sister you're not
[2:07:23] supposed to cut your hair you need your
[2:07:26] how to grow again hello somebody the
[2:07:31] virus they don't cut now the Bible tells
[2:07:33] sister not to cut the hair but it also
[2:07:35] tell the brothers you're half man not
[2:07:39] supposed to be walking around looking
[2:07:40] like a woman and a woman not supposed to
[2:07:42] be walk around looking like a man
[2:07:44] all right now somebody there's a
[2:07:47] difference in the sexes

[2:07:53] so woman not supposed to cut her hair
[2:07:55] and a man is supposed to cut is there if
[2:07:58] you don't cut your hair you might want
[2:08:00] to pray light sense
[2:08:01] once the lords and it began to pray and
[2:08:04] the strength they say since I say them
[2:08:06] them locks begin the girl here and the
[2:08:09] strength came back in the Samson he
[2:08:10] pushed a man them pillows down and and
[2:08:12] at his death more Fela Styles died at
[2:08:15] his death then those that died while he
[2:08:20] was living I can tell you right now you
[2:08:23] can kill Moe Devils when you're ready to
[2:08:25] die to yourself and why don't you kill
[2:08:31] him
[2:08:32] they got cousins they got brothers they
[2:08:36] got nephews they got nieces and they all
[2:08:40] coming right back to try to attack again
[2:08:43] but be ready for one more battle can I
[2:08:48] go on a little further this is something
[2:08:51] that I want to read a man about Abraham
[2:08:54] Oh glory to God look at this this is out
[2:08:58] of possessing the gifts that the enemy's
[2:08:59] gifts this is a about Abraham since God
[2:09:02] had been testing the patriarch because
[2:09:06] he had given him a promise and when God
[2:09:09] makes a promise he wants to be sure that
[2:09:11] this person is worthy of the promise
[2:09:13] before he fulfills what he said or what
[2:09:17] he promises so Abraham had been promised
[2:09:20] that through his seed the whole world
[2:09:22] would be blessed that he have a son and
[2:09:25] this son out of him should come forth
[2:09:28] the seed that would bless the whole
[2:09:29] earth and Abraham when the promise was
[2:09:32] given to him was 75 years old and
[2:09:34] staring his wife was 65 years old but
[2:09:37] the Bible tells us that Abraham
[2:09:39] staggered not at the promise of God
[2:09:41] through unbelief but was strong giving
[2:09:43] praise to God and God
[2:09:45] time after time tested him but he come
[2:09:49] to that final test before the blessing
[2:09:52] was going to happen and that's what I
[2:09:54] want to kind of bring to your attention
[2:09:55] how do you know you're not at your final
[2:09:57] test and if you're there in just a
[2:10:02] couple questions if you're at your final
[2:10:05] test God is watching your actions and
[2:10:09] your reactions now once you understand
[2:10:13] when Abraham
[2:10:14] after his final test God asks him to do
[2:10:17] something that was just ridiculous if
[2:10:20] something that had never been done
[2:10:22] before right
[2:10:23] here God gave a promise now imma give
[2:10:27] you a child in Euro age he got the son
[2:10:29] and he said now through this board
[2:10:31] through his lineage you know the horse
[2:10:33] is going to be blessed Ruth used to
[2:10:35] promise them Isaac was now here the here
[2:10:37] the promise God tells him to take the
[2:10:39] same boy that he gave to him all for him
[2:10:42] as a sacrifice I want you to I want you
[2:10:45] to get this because this was something
[2:10:46] you know Abraham went through a tests
[2:10:49] that he thought he'd never seen before
[2:10:53] and I'm gonna tell you something today
[2:10:55] you all have gone through some tests
[2:10:56] that you thought you've never seen how
[2:10:59] many of when you look around saying our
[2:11:01] Lord I was not expecting nothing like
[2:11:04] that my family I wouldn't expect a
[2:11:10] nothing like that I Lord I wouldn't I
[2:11:12] mean you know maybe if it's if it's a
[2:11:14] sickness that hits but I wouldn't expect
[2:11:17] it nothing like that if it's a person
[2:11:19] that backs last I wasn't expecting that
[2:11:22] I thought for sure this one was strong I
[2:11:24] thought for sure you don't expect these
[2:11:27] things but it's just the test now my
[2:11:32] question is how do you know it's not the
[2:11:33] final test if it is the final test how
[2:11:38] are you gonna react
[2:11:39] how you gonna respond to it if it's the
[2:11:43] final test because I wonder if my
[2:11:45] question is if it's the final test you
[2:11:48] give up now
[2:11:50] but you persevere through this how do
[2:11:54] you know it's not the final test right I
[2:11:57] mean because you know you know I mean
[2:12:00] here here here God you know what will
[2:12:01] send something away to see whether you
[2:12:03] know sympathize or empathize with it are
[2:12:05] you gonna stay with his word Abraham had
[2:12:07] to prove that he was gonna stay with his
[2:12:08] word like my brother Jules say ain't no
[2:12:10] way Abraham told his wife what he was
[2:12:13] get ready to do he didn't get up that
[2:12:15] more say now Sarah this morning you know
[2:12:20] the Lord spoke to me and the Lord told
[2:12:22] me to take Isaac and offer him at this
[2:12:23] mountain he gonna show me the mountain
[2:12:25] to eat he'll show me where to go
[2:12:26] ain't no way
[2:12:27] Sara would have let abraham get out the
[2:12:30] house with a revelation like that so he
[2:12:33] couldn't tell her yeah and not only did
[2:12:37] he not tell her he didn't even tell his
[2:12:38] service what was giving happen but God
[2:12:41] was using that to test Abraham's faith
[2:12:43] now I want you to know Abraham
[2:12:44] publication Abraham persevered through
[2:12:47] that Abraham made it and because he made
[2:12:51] it look at this let's read this let's
[2:12:55] read this III got this in Genesis 22
[2:12:59] verse 16 through 18 see I'm used to
[2:13:05] seeing different people backsliding and
[2:13:08] come back to the Lord I'm used to seeing
[2:13:11] new types of things I don't you know I
[2:13:13] backslidden you know and just and then
[2:13:16] the lord have to get my attention you
[2:13:17] know I've seen that happen but but but
[2:13:20] this is a different test this is a
[2:13:23] different trial right that this trial is
[2:13:25] not just backsliding but it's denouncing
[2:13:30] don't get that it's not just bad spot
[2:13:33] it's actually absolutely coming out and
[2:13:35] denouncing the faith I've never expected
[2:13:39] that how many I can say up oh I saw this
[2:13:43] coming you didn't see that coming when
[2:13:49] it happens
[2:13:49] can I just preach can I just talk to
[2:13:53] y'all because we all affected by some of
[2:13:56] your closest friends it happens to your
[2:13:59] family members it happens too but God is
[2:14:02] watching your reaction and the midst of
[2:14:05] it are you go simple fast are you gonna
[2:14:08] stay with the word cuz it's only one way
[2:14:13] to overcome not with a superpower don't
[2:14:17] all the way you can overcome is with
[2:14:18] word and you say well what work cuz
[2:14:21] that's why so you gotta know cuz they
[2:14:23] can use the same word it gives you and
[2:14:25] if you don't know if you don't know that
[2:14:28] you might have a just conversation
[2:14:29] sometimes sometimes you might not have
[2:14:31] the answer there's been times I've been
[2:14:32] in situations I just did not have the
[2:14:34] answer right then and since I don't have
[2:14:37] the answer you know mass is I get back
[2:14:39] to you
[2:14:40] when you're gonna get back to me when
[2:14:42] God give it to me I give it to you I get
[2:14:45] back to you but I'm not gonna stay here
[2:14:47] and go tit for tat with you
[2:14:49] hallelujah something about it so you got
[2:14:52] you got you know that you know sometimes
[2:14:54] your look is like you know well because
[2:14:56] it's everything change the conversation
[2:14:57] change everything changes now our
[2:15:00] dynamics change we can't talk about what
[2:15:02] we used to talk about anymore right
[2:15:04] we're gonna talk about the weather
[2:15:06] but when it comes to this word is
[2:15:07] different you might as well say man but
[2:15:13] when you look at all of this my question
[2:15:16] is is this the final test is this the
[2:15:20] final battle is this what is this what
[2:15:24] we come down to right and if we gotta
[2:15:27] overcome it's not gonna be through
[2:15:29] sympathy we can't sit and cry together
[2:15:34] about our hurts and pains look you ain't
[2:15:37] no only one been hurt all that's been
[2:15:41] hurt Oh Lord you don't hold me pull them
[2:15:43] into something now I was thinking this
[2:15:46] and the Holy Ghost disappears
[2:16:04] Jesus tears well they'll say we
[2:16:23] Christians not dead our plants they have
[2:16:27] to be pet it a pipe airplane you always
[2:16:31] got a worries
[2:16:32] but a real Christian air like that a
[2:16:35] Christian know how to encourage their
[2:16:37] self when everybody
[2:16:40] yes he's gonna get him you realize even
[2:16:48] even even in the dates of the murders
[2:16:51] fellas knew how to stand for Christ if
[2:16:54] it lived my life I'm giving up my life
[2:16:57] for this then I want a women that
[2:17:00] started babies put the back sorry babies
[2:17:06] put the death almost and police work and
[2:17:09] then back down in their face and we're
[2:17:15] people standing with testimonies like
[2:17:17] that god help us to stand in this hour
[2:17:20] we gotta face one more battle it might
[2:17:24] be the hardest when we have a face but
[2:17:27] don't you talk about right now something
[2:17:31] you've never seen before
[2:17:34] well I mean ten years ago we would have
[2:17:36] never even thought to even talk about
[2:17:38] things like this 20 years ago when we
[2:17:42] come into this message we no no no no we
[2:17:44] would never thought nothing like this
[2:17:45] that's why I said that the spirits are
[2:17:48] with him discern and whisk damn from
[2:17:51] within not only outside everybody you
[2:17:53] know we've always talked about well I'm
[2:17:55] not worried about denomination I'm not
[2:17:56] where we already knew what they had but
[2:17:59] we did not know what was happening on
[2:18:01] the inside people I mean you this close
[2:18:06] to go Touhou I mean when the meetings
[2:18:11] together you share a room together you
[2:18:13] know you know we eat together we we do
[2:18:17] you like my grandma say we sleep
[2:18:19] together I like about it it's a
[2:18:24] different time be careful it works like
[2:18:27] that
[2:18:33] but but we have you have so much expel
[2:18:36] ship right but but you know here here we
[2:18:39] get to this point where you know and and
[2:18:42] I'm gonna tell you I'm just I'm this is
[2:18:44] this is this is my feeling most of the
[2:18:47] people that get into this situation
[2:18:49] they've been hurt somewhere they've been
[2:18:52] hurt somewhere and that hurt the devil
[2:18:55] anoints it and when it gets there behind
[2:18:58] that heard he just forgive it just work
[2:19:00] and love anomaly how they been hurt but
[2:19:03] they refused they refused to allow God
[2:19:08] to heal the hurt how you know that
[2:19:12] because they're still talking about hurt
[2:19:14] that happen years ago the other person
[2:19:18] move alone but they still stuck they
[2:19:24] stuck and they refused to me and this is
[2:19:28] my people wheel you've got you got you
[2:19:39] got allowed God to heal you see the
[2:19:42] reason the reason you got to see it so
[2:19:45] he can prove to you that he's a healer
[2:19:52] the reason you got a little discouraged
[2:19:54] so he can come in just just just showed
[2:19:58] up next thing you show you how he
[2:19:59] kidding I'll walk with you see it's not
[2:20:02] just a summer walk with me Lord welcomes
[2:20:04] no no you have to actually experience
[2:20:06] that but because of hurt people make
[2:20:10] decisions people make they do things and
[2:20:14] and I'm looking at all of this you know
[2:20:15] just happen there right before something
[2:20:17] like that like I saw you when you start
[2:20:20] listening to the hurt watch it did you
[2:20:23] start the sympathize and they didn't
[2:20:25] want to you oh no and you're making a
[2:20:29] decision based on the information you
[2:20:31] have
[2:20:32] can I tell you about something else any
[2:20:36] story any story you hear is two sides to
[2:20:43] it
[2:20:44] and if you only listen to one side
[2:20:47] you're making the wrong decision and
[2:20:49] sometimes you know let me just put it
[2:20:52] this way you are not a mediator Jesus is
[2:20:58] so you don't need that well let me get
[2:21:01] these two together no no no no what you
[2:21:04] need to do is tell them if you got the
[2:21:06] Bible tell us what to do I'm trying to
[2:21:12] get us back to the river if we go I
[2:21:15] become we gotta overcome by the way if
[2:21:18] somebody's a pigeon what does the Bible
[2:21:20] tell you to do we posted we let
[2:21:37] everybody know that we offended right we
[2:21:42] do everything against the word and then
[2:21:45] we expect somehow to stake the work out
[2:21:48] I'm going to tell you something about
[2:21:50] your posts you can delete them you can
[2:21:55] but they already been they already been
[2:21:58] seen and the thing of it is is once it's
[2:22:02] been seen you can't delete that can I
[2:22:09] just talk a little bit to this woman lad
[2:22:15] on the pastor
[2:22:18] Pasteur was in town and doing a good job

[2:23:18] sister I forgive you I forgive you but
[2:23:20] if you don't mind follow me follow me he

[2:23:25] walked up to the top of the of the roof
[2:23:27] of the other of the other church and
[2:23:30] they had a bail up there and you know a
[2:23:31] little opening and everything where they

[2:23:40] pillow and then he just he just he just
[2:23:42] it just let the fellas go out to the
[2:23:44] wind he said sister would you go pick up
[2:23:49] all them feathers and bring them back to

[2:24:03] what do people think about me you come
[2:24:04] back to me and see you sorry but the
[2:24:08] damage has already been done see the
[2:24:13] Bible tells us how to handle stuff if
[2:24:16] we'll follow biblical principles and I'm
[2:24:19] going to tell you this right now a lot
[2:24:21] of what we got going on is because full
[2:24:24] did not follow biblical principles then
[2:24:30] follow so we get ourselves up for one
[2:24:36] more panel it won't stop
[2:24:42] it won't stop til you die it's going to
[2:24:46] be battle after battle after battle can
[2:24:49] I just read about Abraham and I let it
[2:24:53] go I'm in Genesis 22 oh my god I have a
[2:25:02] question for you do you love God more
[2:25:06] than you love your friend do you love
[2:25:10] God more than you love your family do
[2:25:16] you love God more than anything else
[2:25:26] Genesis 22 verse 16 Abraham was stood as
[2:25:35] I said by myself I've sworn said the
[2:25:37] Lord for because thou has done this
[2:25:40] thing and has not withheld thy son not
[2:25:42] only son he took him final test he took
[2:25:44] that boy up there to be offered and God
[2:25:47] made a way for Abraham he had a ram in
[2:25:49] the bush for Abraham and God said God is
[2:25:52] coming down down he's he said Abraham I
[2:25:54] by myself I have a sworn said the Lord
[2:25:56] for because thou has done this thing and
[2:25:58] has not withheld thy son and only Son
[2:26:00] listen is that and blessing I will bless
[2:26:05] thee say I have the spot right there
[2:26:08] right after Abraham have proved his love
[2:26:11] to God and this is where you you this is
[2:26:14] where we are right now we have to prove
[2:26:15] our love to God look I love you I love
[2:26:19] you I love you and I love you but I love
[2:26:21] God so much more and after he proved his
[2:26:24] love to God notice this the Bible says
[2:26:28] and blessing I will bless thee and when
[2:26:30] I looked at that I said you know I'm not
[2:26:32] gonna worry about whether my job don't
[2:26:34] come through I'm not gonna worry about
[2:26:37] whether one of my family members gonna
[2:26:39] come through God is the one that
[2:26:41] promised to bless me after year prove
[2:26:44] themself in blessing I will bless thee
[2:26:49] listen says I will multiply that seed as
[2:26:53] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[2:26:56] which is upon the seashore and this is
[2:26:59] the other part Abraham because you stood
[2:27:02] your seed vast eat shell possess the
[2:27:10] gate of his enemies
[2:27:13] you know what that tell me that in my
[2:27:16] one last battle I got a promise
[2:27:21] you know why because I'm a seed of
[2:27:23] Abraham and all of Abraham's seed is
[2:27:26] supposed to possess the gates of their
[2:27:31] enemies don't look at the trial don't
[2:27:35] look at the trouble don't look at the
[2:27:37] situation look at the promise you
[2:27:40] already know how this thing gonna work
[2:27:41] out that's why I can tell you that just
[2:27:43] in cursive um you got this you got this
[2:27:46] don't be afraid of this battle you got
[2:27:49] this it's gonna be all right it might be
[2:27:54] the last battle Church it might be one
[2:27:56] that we've never seen before
[2:27:57] it might be the last one but somehow
[2:27:59] this thing will work out and when I pray
[2:28:01] I pray that that statement out of
[2:28:04] Mother's Day for the prophecy is somehow
[2:28:05] majestic fingers will begin to untie all
[2:28:09] the night and that's what my friend Lord
[2:28:12] let majestic fingers come in and untie
[2:28:15] fall into every question that somebody
[2:28:17] might have let majestic fingers come in
[2:28:19] and untie the knots bring peace to the
[2:28:23] midst of the storm but I'd say what I'm
[2:28:26] gonna do I'm not gonna compromise I'm
[2:28:28] not gonna sympathize I'm gonna stand
[2:28:31] with this word I'm preparing myself but
[2:28:35] just one more battle let me finish
[2:28:40] reading that quote possessed it if the
[2:28:42] enemy's gates the prophets said it
[2:28:44] God time after time tested him but it
[2:28:47] comes to that final test before the
[2:28:49] blessing was going to happen and that's
[2:28:52] the way it is with all the seed of
[2:28:54] Abraham God gives us that final chest
[2:28:57] just before he gives the promise and if
[2:29:02] it was possible I'd like to see
[2:29:03] something in person but I would hold
[2:29:04] that that final test to see how you
[2:29:06] react upon it and when he give when he
[2:29:09] had gave Abraham this test he found
[2:29:12] Abraham just as true as he was when he
[2:29:14] started are you still just as true as
[2:29:18] you were when you started see what a
[2:29:20] blessing it would be this morning if we
[2:29:22] who take his promise of healing will
[2:29:25] stand just as true as we did when we
[2:29:28] stood here and accepted it no matter
[2:29:30] what the doctor said
[2:29:32] stand just as true no matter what you're
[2:29:37] going through church stands just that's
[2:29:40] true I encourage you take on the whole
[2:29:42] armor fella that's the only way you
[2:29:45] don't be able to stand get you get your
[2:29:47] feet shod with the preparation of the
[2:29:50] gospel of peace peace
[2:29:52] take the sword of the Spirit put on the
[2:29:56] breastplate of righteousness put on the
[2:29:59] helmet of salvation and when y'all leave
[2:30:01] here today get ready for battle this is
[2:30:08] not a picnic this is a war and I feel
[2:30:15] like David David had a another battle
[2:30:20] what would the Phyllis time you know
[2:30:21] when he was when he was going get ready
[2:30:24] to join up with the feel it's time to go
[2:30:27] fight you know the Phyllis Don said no
[2:30:30] no he's gonna turn in the battle and
[2:30:32] he's gonna probably join right back up
[2:30:34] with you know with the Israelites so we
[2:30:36] can't use him so they still him back you
[2:30:38] know what David went back he found that
[2:30:40] he doesn't left get ready to face the
[2:30:42] power you know he just left and went
[2:30:43] back home and found all his stuff was
[2:30:45] gone
[2:30:45] wife children everybody go when he got
[2:30:48] there he like Lord what is this and not
[2:30:50] only was he discouraged for the men that
[2:30:52] were with him got discouraged they got
[2:30:54] so discouraged a look that they've said
[2:30:55] maybe we don't kill this fellow what
[2:30:57] kind of leader is he
[2:30:58] we don't lost everything the Bible say
[2:31:00] David encouraged himself in the Lord and
[2:31:02] now was that David encouraged himself in
[2:31:04] the Lord David begin the pre any like he
[2:31:06] acts God should I pursue we need to stop
[2:31:15] an ex-con the same question should I
[2:31:17] pursue cuz some things you don't need
[2:31:19] assume he said should I pursue and and I
[2:31:23] don't let will I recover oh and God got
[2:31:26] responses they were say say pursue and
[2:31:28] thou shalt recover all church David went
[2:31:35] looking for his family and God's just so
[2:31:37] happened to happen one guy get got sick
